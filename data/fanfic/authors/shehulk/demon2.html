<p>The first rays of dawn were edging over the foot of the bed when
Kellem rolled over and studied the face of the young woman beside her. Pale
blonde hair curled in pleasant disarray around a face that reposed
peacefully in slumber. Kellem resisted the urge to brush a stray strand
away from the Slayer’s cheek, knowing that the touch would not be welcome.</p>

<p>The Slayer had yielded to the need to maintain the bond but she
did so in an almost clinical fashion. In public Buffy was distant and
reserved with her. It was only in the heat of passion did she let herself
show any kind of emotion towards the demon she was bound to. Kellem tried
to rationalize her behavior but was honest enough with herself to admit
that it hurt.</p>

<p>A slim arm slipped around Kellem’s waist and she felt the press of
soft lips against the side of her neck. At least there was one person who
seemed comfortable with the situation. She glanced at Willow and smiled
sheepishly.</p>

<p>Willow’s answering smile was sympathetic. She knew how much Kellem
loved Buffy and how much Buffy’s rejection of that love hurt the demon. She
nodded towards the door and mouthed the word ‘breakfast?’</p>

<p>Kellem nodded and they got dressed quietly, not wishing to wake
Buffy. As the door shut behind them, Buffy opened her eyes and stared up at
the ceiling, wondering how her already complicated life had gotten even
more so.</p>

<p>Because you wanted to save a demon…</p>

<hr>

<p>"I don’t know how much more of this I can take, Willow. She hates
me." Kellem’s tone was morose as she idly stirred her coffee.</p>

<p>Willow was quick to reassure her. "She doesn’t hate you, Kell.
She’s just having problems with this whole sharing thing. Not many people
could be expected to you know."</p>

<p>"You seem to be handling it."</p>

<p>"But I’m special."</p>

<p>Willow’s grin was infectious and Kellem laughed despite her somber
mood. "Yes you are. I don’t know of anyone else that would risk what you
did to save someone you didn’t even know."</p>

<p>The reply was soft. "I know somebody who would…who did. She just
needs time. The Slayer gig has pretty much guaranteed that Buffy’s life
falls into the bizarre category, but add a demon binding on top? She’s
trying to deal with a lot right now."</p>

<p>Kellem set her coffee cup down with a snap. "And I’m not? You’re
not?" She reached out and took Willow’s hand. "Willow I love you. I love
Buffy. I have a strong desire to please you both, but what Buffy wants just
isn’t possible and it’s tearing me up."</p>

<p>Willow frowned slightly. "What does Buffy want?"</p>

<p>"For me to disappear."</p>

<p>Quick to disagree, Willow gripped her hand tighter. "No she
doesn’t. She’s just-." Willow broke off as Tara appeared beside them. The
other girl looked at their clasped hands and seemed to pale. "Tara! What
are you doing here? Or were we supposed to meet?" Willow frantically tried
to remember as Tara began to back away from the table.</p>

<p>"S-s-sorry to interrupt." She turned and fled, leaving a very
confused Willow staring after her.</p>

<p>"Tara?"</p>

<p>Kellem pulled her hand away and groaned. "Looks like I’m not the
only one who with unrequited love issues."</p>

<p>The blank look that she received in response made Kellem roll her
eyes. "Willow, she was upset that we were holding hands."</p>

<p>"But Tara doesn’t-." She stopped suddenly as realization dawned.
"Oh no!" Willow slid out of the booth and raced after her.</p>

<p>"Bye Willow. Have a nice day." Kellem grimaced and pushed her
coffee away as she stood up. Time to get to class.</p>

<hr>

<p>Willow knocked on Tara’s door, knowing that she was there. "Tara
please! Can we talk?"</p>

<p>Tara pulled her knees closer to her chest and stared at the door,
refusing to answer. After a few minutes the knocking stopped and Tara
sighed in a mix of relief and disappointment. She jumped as the door swung
open with the unmistakable tingle of magik.</p>

<p>Willow saw Tara sitting on the floor beside the bed and frowned
slightly as she stepped into the room. The door closed of its own accord
and Tara blinked. "How d-did you do that?"</p>

<p>Her smile wry, Willow lowered herself the floor beside her friend.
"That’s part of what I wanted to talk to you about."</p>

<p>Tara shook her head and shrugged, but the gesture did not have the
nonchalant air that she hoped. Instead she appeared exactly as she was; hurt.</p>

<p>"Tara there’s a lot of stuff that’s happened lately that I, I just
didn’t know how to tell you, or how to handle it." She wondered where to
start and decided that the beginning was the only place that might hope to
make any sense. "I fell in love with Buffy a long time ago." Tara looked up
at her in confusion. That had not been Buffy in the café. Willow understood
her questioning look and held up a hand. "I’m getting there. It’s just a
really tangled up tale, okay?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded and let Willow continue.</p>

<p>In the end it had taken only an hour to explain everything and
Willow was amazed. While it was happening it had felt like time had slowed
to a crawl, but know for the first time she realized that it had only been
two months since they had first seen Kellem.</p>

<p>Halfway through the telling Tara’s expression had changed from
hurt to disbelieving and in the end to sympathetic. She uncurled herself
from the floor and began to light candles, needing something to do as she
took time to digest this.</p>

<p>Willow watched her closely, wanting her to understand and afraid
that she wouldn’t. She spoke softly. "So how mad are you?"</p>

<p>Tara sighed and rested her head against the wall near the candles
she had just lit. How was she supposed to answer that? She turned around
and met Willow’s eyes. "I don’t know if I am mad. We…we didn’t exactly have
that kind of relationship, b-but I had hoped…" She trailed off.</p>

<p>Willow rose and crossed to her. "I know. So did I." She saw the
barely concealed hurt in Tara’s eyes and acted instinctively, hugging the
other girl to her. "I wish…"</p>

<p>Tara pulled back. "D-don’t w.. worry about it. I guess you should go."</p>

<p>Willow shook her head and caught Tara’s face in her hands. "No. I
don’t want to leave you." The first tentative brush of Willow’s lips
against Tara’s made the other girl gasp, but she continued the caress,
intensifying it.</p>

<p>Tara felt her head swim and part of her cried out that this was
wrong, that Willow didn’t love her. She pushed Willow away and stared at
her in hurt confusion. "You don’t love me!"</p>

<p>Touching her lips with a shaking hand, Willow shook her head. "I…
I don’t know what this is." She did feel something for Tara and that
realization sent the fragile house of cards that was Willow’s world
tumbling down. A sob exploded from her and she found herself on her knees
in front of Tara.</p>

<p>The storm of tears continued unabated and Tara couldn’t stop
herself from kneeling beside Willow and taking her into her arms. She
rocked the redhead gently, murmuring soothing words of comfort and
wondering how the tables had turned.</p>

<p>Finally, after what seemed like forever, Willow quieted. She made
no move to leave the circle of Tara’s arms. Her voice was tremulous when
she spoke. "I’m sorry."</p>

<p>Tara pressed her lips to Willow’s forehead without thinking.
"Don’t apologize. You… You’re hurting."</p>

<p>Willow laughed morosely. "Not as much as you." She raised her head
from Tara’s shoulder and swiped at the moisture in her eyes. "I do wish
that…" She trailed off as her gaze was drawn to Tara’s lips once more. "I…
Oh God…I think I do love you." Willow buried her face in her hands and
laughed, the sound touched with hysteria.</p>

<p>Tara felt something inside her blossom at Willow’s words and she
had to forcibly remind herself that Buffy was definitely in her life and
not going away. "B-but… Buffy?"</p>

<p>Willow sighed deeply. "I love her too." She ran her hands through
her hair and barely managed to refrain from pulling. "I don’t know what’s
going on anymore."</p>

<p>"Maybe it’s the demon?"</p>

<p>"I… I don’t know. You can’t love this many people…. can you?"</p>

<p>Tara had no answer and as Willow’s lips claimed hers again, she
let herself be swayed by the steadily burning desire that flared between them.</p>

<p></p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem opened the door without looking through the peephole. She
knew very well who was there. She could feel Buffy’s presence, could smell
her scent. "Hi."</p>

<p>Buffy stepped inside and closed the door behind her. Kellem bit
her tongue to keep herself from speaking and waited for the Slayer to make
the first move. She knew she was hoping for the impossible but maybe this
time Buffy had come here to talk. As she watched Buffy cross the room and
enter the bedroom she chided herself for being foolish. Kellem began to
unbutton her shirt as she went to join Buffy, trying not to think about how
much this was going to hurt afterwards.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem heard the front door close and stared at the ceiling,
willing the tears away. She wondered if she would ever adjust to being
used. The strange pattern her life had fallen into was beginning to wear on
her. Buffy stopped by several times a week to have sex with her before
patrolling and it hadn’t taken long for Kellem to realize that she was
being used as a pre-patrol power up. And it was always sex. Not since the
first time had the Slayer made love to her and Kellem pressed her clenched
fists into her eyes as she forced the images away. Why was she letting this
get to her?</p>

<p>Of all the beings she could have been bound to, Buffy was definitely at the
top of the list. She shouldn’t expect anymore than what was required for
the bond, but… Kellem rolled over and buried her face in the pillow,
inhaling the Slayer’s scent. But she was in love with Buffy. Perhaps the
worst curse that could befall one of her kind was to be in love with a
master that did not love her in return.</p>

<p>She tried to rationalize the situation. Willow loves me. And the
witch did, but it wasn’t enough. Kellem had given her heart to both the
Witch and the Slayer, but only one was willing to accept that gift. She
could feel the distance that Buffy put between them in every word and
action. Like a moth to the flame, she kept trying to get closer only to be
burned again and again. "I shouldn’t care, damn it!"</p>

<p>The front door opened again and Kellem stiffened for an instant,
and then relaxed. Willow’s presence filled the room and swept over her like
a soothing balm. She didn’t roll over, but instead waited for her witch to
speak.</p>

<p>Willow knew instantly what had happened and she cursed Buffy for
dong this again. "Hey."</p>

<p>Kellem raised a hand and waved slightly.</p>

<p>"You still want to study for that calc exam?"</p>

<p>The laugh that escaped Kellem was a bit hoarse, but was filled
with genuine humor. "Sure, why not?" She rolled over and sat up, ignoring
the fact that she was naked. "You want pizza or Thai?"</p>

<p>"Thai."</p>

<hr>

<p></p>

<p>Kellem gasped and waved her chopsticks at Willow. "Damn it, Will!
I said mild!" She grabbed her soda and drained it in a few gulps.</p>

<p>Willow ate her own Khao Phat Naem, enjoying the heat that seared
her mouth. "I did. That is mild. Next time I’ll tell them to fix it for a
baby, Miss Demon." She wanted to tell Kellem about Tara, but she didn’t.
She couldn’t this soon after what had happened with Buffy. Once again
pushing her own worries aside, Willow focused on Kellem.</p>

<p>"Funny." Kellem shifted into her demon form and selected another
bite of Sa-Te. "Well you’ll have to put up with this form while I eat this."</p>

<p>Willow shrugged, not willing to admit that she found the Jauda’s
true form extremely arousing. Maybe she had forgotten to order Kellem’s
dish mild. She couldn’t remember.</p>

<p>Kellem continued to eat, wondering if she should mention the scent
that lay thickly along Willow’s skin. The blonde witch’s feelings had been
obvious to the Jauda and she could truly sympathize with her plight… but
Willow was hers. Hers and Buffy’s. Her fingers clenched around the thin
sticks and the bamboo splintered.</p>

<p>Willow jumped at the sound and looked at Kellem in concern. "Are
you okay?"</p>

<p>Kellem shook her head and dropped the pieces onto the carpet in
front of her. "Not really." She reached up and grabbed the collar of her
shirt, ripping it off with a quick motion that made Willow gasp. The blue
skin beneath glowed faintly in the lamplight and Willow saw the flash of
power in the demon’s eyes.</p>

<p>"Kellem? What, what’s wrong?" The redhead scrambled backwards
until the dresser stopped her.</p>

<p>Kellem rolled onto her knees and dropped her hands to the floor,
never breaking eye contact with Willow. She began to crawl across the floor
towards the witch and Willow swallowed hard at the strange expression on
her face. "K-Kell?"</p>

<p>Kellem saw the motion in the redhead’s eyes an instant before she
actually moved and she couldn’t stop the growl that tore free as Willow
pushed herself away from her. Her muscles bunched and she sprang, her arms
encircling Willow and tumbling her to the carpet.</p>

<p>Willow cried out as she found herself flat on her back, an enraged
Jauda demon over her. She pushed against Kellem’s chest but it was like
trying to move a wall. Angry now, Willow glared up at her lover, "What are
you doing?"</p>

<p>Kellem bent her face impossibly close to Willow’s and inhaled. The
low rumble that was emanating from her chest vibrated across Willow’s flesh
and she could feel the sound deep inside her. The demon took her time,
carefully sniffing Willow’s face and neck before she met the witch’s eyes
again. "You kissed her."</p>

<p>It was not a question but Willow’s flinch gave her answer. A
pained growl ripped from the demon’s throat. "You slept with her!"</p>

<p>Kellem vaguely heard the sound of something tearing and she looked down to
see her hands tangled in the shredded remains of the carpet. She freed her
fingers and then eased them into Willow’s hair, ignoring the small whimper
that escaped her captive, which only made her blood heat more. Kellem ran
her tongue down the side of Willow’s neck and tasted Tara. "Why? Why did
you touch her?"</p>

<p>Willow was shaking so hard that she could almost hear her bones
rattling. "I-I…don’t know."</p>

<p>Kellem’s eyes were green fire and she stared at Willow in equal
parts confusion, desire and anger. "You love Buffy. You said that you loved
me. Why would you do this?"</p>

<p>How could she answer that when she didn’t know herself? Willow
thought back to how she had felt with Tara and tried to form a response.
"I… she needs me."</p>

<p>Kellem froze. Needs her? Don’t I need her too?</p>

<p>"I do love you, Kellem and I love Buffy. I don’t know how to
explain this thing with Tara. She fills something inside me that I didn’t
know was missing."</p>

<p>Kellem rolled away from Willow and to her feet in a quick motion
that startled the witch. She didn’t look at Willow as she stood, instead
choosing to stare at the wall. It offered a safer target at the moment.
"You’re in love with her."</p>

<p>Willow shook her head. "I don’t know."</p>

<p>"I do." The Jauda demon’s reply was harsh. "I can taste it in you.
It mixes inside you with the power of the triad."</p>

<p>"M-mixes? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Kellem drew a deep breath and forced herself to resume her human
form before she turned to Willow. "I’m not sure myself. I can feel your
power. I can feel Buffy’s. But now I can feel Tara’s connection to you."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>Kellem shook her head. "I don’t know. We’re in uncharted waters
anyway. This… I have no idea."</p>

<p>"Here there be dragons," Willow whispered.</p>

<p>Nodding in agreement, Kellem stepped closer. "I’m sorry I
frightened you."</p>

<p>"I, um, I’m sorry about… Tara."</p>

<p>Kellem grimaced and reached out to thread her fingers through the
scarlet strands that framed her lover’s face. "I just wonder how for this
connection goes." She bent her head and brushed her lips across Willow’s.</p>

<p>A low moan filled the small space between them and Kellem shivered
at the sound. "Willow? Do you still love me?"</p>

<p>Knowing what she was asking, Willow answered by reaching out and
cupping Kellem’s breast.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy felt the desire spreading through Willow and Kellem and
smiled grimly as she prowled through the graveyard looking for her next target.</p>

<hr>

<p>Music, soft and sexy flowed over the bed as Willow found herself
pressed back against the tangled sheets. She threw her head back restlessly
as Kellem raked her teeth over her breasts and a small cry escaped her as
the demon caught a nipple between her sharp teeth. Kellem laughed huskily
and moved down Willow’s body. "I’ve finally figured it out."</p>

<p>"Wha-AH! What?"</p>

<p>"You like this." She ran her claws across Willow’s abdomen and was
rewarded by her delighted shiver. "Don’t you?"</p>

<p>Willow was having trouble focusing on what she was saying. "What?"</p>

<p>Kellem touched the point of one claw to the hyper-sensitive flesh
between Willow’s legs. "My demon form."</p>

<p>Willow arched up off the bed as Kellem withdrew, trying to follow her
touch. She opened her eyes and stared into the jade depths of the demon’s
gaze. Willow licked her lips and whispered, "Yes."</p>

<p>Kellem dropped her hand to cover her heat, making Willow sigh in
relief. "Tell me."</p>

<p>"I’d rather show you." Willow lurched up and caught Kellem by
surprise. She found herself laying flat on the bed with a naked redheaded
witch straddling her. Willow bent over her and fused their mouths together
in a scorching kiss. Kellem was gasping for breath when the kiss ended and
she stared at her lover mutely.</p>

<p>Pleased with the stunned expression on her face, Willow pressed
her advantage. She reached out and cupped her face, tracing the shape and
dipping her fingers playfully into Kellem’s mouth. "I love you like this. I
love you the other way too, but this," She bent low and nipped at the blue
skin that covered Kellem’s throat. "This is sexy in a naughty kinda way."
She stroked the length of Kellem’s horns, knowing what it did to the demon.</p>

<p>Kellem couldn’t stop the low growl that rumbled from her chest but
then, Willow didn’t want her to.</p>

<p></p>

<hr>

<p></p>

<p>Buffy jerked the stake back an instant before it would have
pierced Kellem’s skin and scowled at her. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>Kellem swallowed audibly and took a step back. "Uh, trying to
help?" She pointed behind Buffy, who swung her arm backwards without
looking. As the dust settled behind her, Buffy began to berate the demon
for interfering. "I don’t need your help. I don’t want your help. Understand?"</p>

<p>Ignoring the pain that swept through her at her mistress’ words,
Kellem nodded. "I’m sorry. My mistake." She turned to leave and then looked
back. "Tell me something Buffy. Did you ever care? Even for an instant?"</p>

<p>Caught up in a confusing tangle of emotions, Buffy shook her head
and walked away, leaving Kellem staring hopelessly after her.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem unlocked the trunk and shifted the stack of folded clothes
to the side, revealing the large book underneath. She lifted it out,
feeling the tingle of age race up her fingers. The book had belonged to her
mother’s mother and before that it had been one of the last created by the
now dead council of Succubae. Kellem settled the book on her lap and
shifted into her true form before opening the latch. The book was
spellbound to keep non-Succubae out and would kill any that tried to open it.</p>

<p>She flipped through the pages slowly, remembering the few times
her mother had read to her from the book before she had been bound to a
Torment demon. Kellem had learned the rest on her own and knew where the
ritual was, but she took her time getting there. What she was contemplating
was not something to be done on impulse or in the heat of anger and she
wanted to make sure that she was calm before she began.</p>

<p>Kellem drew a bracing breath and turned the page. The script was
ornate and written in the blood of Succubae to give it power. She traced
the ancient words with a clawed finger; the slight scratching the only
sound in the room.</p>

<p>Did she dare? Was it really so bad?</p>

<p>She thought of the sleepless nights she spent, afraid to sleep
because she dreamed of Buffy. Of the cold indifference that Buffy displayed
in public and her periodic visits for sex. Kellem thought of Willow and the
friendship that had blossomed between them. That alone was almost enough to
stop her, but now there was Tara and she was unsure of her place. Knowing
that Buffy was only tolerating her presence in Willow’s life finally
decided her.</p>

<p>Kellem noted the supplies she would need and tried not to look at
the spell name as she wrote.</p>

<p>Per Dividere il Legame e Concludersi la Vita</p>

<hr>

<p>The demon’s cry was cut off as his body exploded and several
headstones were suddenly coated in green blood. Buffy looked down at her
boots and moaned. "Darn it! I just bought these!" She started back across
the cemetery, deciding to call it a night. Buffy stepped around a marble
statue and froze as a trickle of unease skittered along her nerve endings.
Years of fighting had taught Buffy that different demons came with
different feelings, but this wasn’t the sense of a nearby badie. This was
Kellem. "What’s she-?" Buffy staggered as her mind filled with images and
she saw Kellem lifting a long knife to her wrist.</p>

<p>Buffy ran.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem finished drawing the runes within the circle and rose,
tossing the bloody brush of sage leaves to the side. She picked up the
potion and held it up, staring at the dark fluid a moment before stepping
into the spell. Her skin prickled as she crossed the magikal threshold. The
spell was very simple really and as she began the litany that would sever
the bond, she wondered if it would hurt to die.</p>

<p>The room seemed to darken as the power built and Kellem uncorked
the bottle of poison. Her life force, her energy and powers would be
divided between Willow and Buffy at the instant of her death. She drew a
deep breath, closed her eyes and raised the bottle to her lips.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The bottle exploded as it smashed into the wall beside her. Kellem opened
her eyes and stared at Buffy blankly. "Wha-?" Buffy grabbed the front of
her shirt and yanked her from the magik field. Kellem jerked away and
glared at her. "Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>Buffy moved close, backing Kellem into the wall. "Why! What were
you trying to do?"</p>

<p>Kellem lost her temper, shoving Buffy back. "I was trying to give
you what you want!"</p>

<p>"What I want? When have I ever said that I wanted you dead?"</p>

<p>Kellem laughed harshly. "Every time you look at me, Buffy." She
ran her hands through her hair in agitation and groaned. "Damn it! Why are
you here? Forget something? Need a little stress relieved? Want another
power rush?"</p>

<p>The underlying pain in her words was obvious. Buffy’s eyes
narrowed. "What?"</p>

<p>Kellem began unbuttoning her shirt. "You only come here for one
thing Buffy. Come on Slayer, let’s get this over with." She pulled her
shirt off and was reaching for the snap on her jeans when Buffy gripped her
wrist. Kellem growled and grabbed Buffy’s arm, knowing what would happen
and almost relieved when it did. Buffy’s fist struck the side of her face
and sent Kellem spinning across the room, through the open door of the
bedroom. She crashed into the side of the bed and slumped to the floor.</p>

<p>Buffy looked down at her clenched fist in disgust. Kellem eased
herself into a sitting position, ignoring the blood that seeped from the
corner of her mouth. She spoke quietly. "Thank you Mistress."</p>

<p>Buffy froze. When she spoke, Kellem had to strain to hear. "Why
are you doing this?"</p>

<p>Kellem drew her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around
them. "I love Willow. I love you. But you’re the one who makes me feel that
it’s wrong." She closed her eyes. "That makes me feel like a whore."</p>

<p>The raw pain her words held made Buffy flinch. She opened her
mouth to deny it when a strange roaring sound filled the room. Buffy had a
split second to wonder and then the area around Kellem seemed to dissolve,
taking the demon with it.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem staggered out of the remains of her apartment building and
clutched her head as the world tried to right itself. Nausea made her
stomach roil and she swallowed hard, determined not to give into the
sensation as she struggled to fasten her shirt.</p>

<p>The bright sunlight streamed around her and Kellem squinted at the
chaos she saw. Charred corpses of things that could not have been human
littered the ground and she gingerly stepped around one, looking for her lover.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and sent out a call. Buffy? Willow?</p>

<p>Kellem rubbed her head and tried again, focusing on the strands of
power that connected her to her lovers. Willow?</p>

<p>There. It was very faint but she could just feel the witch’s
lifeforce. Kellem started walking.</p>

<p>+ + +</p>

<p>Willow stood in the cemetery wondering how long it would take for
the reality of this to set in. She read the words that had been carved into
the tombstone, and bit her lip as a sob tried to escape. Tara’s arms
wrapped around her from behind and she turned to bury her face in the
taller woman’s neck.</p>

<p>Tara rubbed her lover’s back and rocked her as the tears came
again and she silently prayed to the goddess for Willow’s pain to ease.</p>

<p>Kellem entered the graveyard at a slow run, feeling Willow’s
presence getting stronger. She pulled up short when she saw the embracing
couple. What the hell? Taking a firm grasp on her temper, Kellem approached
them. Can’t kill her. Will loves her. At least Willow has nice taste.</p>

<p>"Willow?"</p>

<p>Willow heard the unfamiliar voice and raised her head, meeting a
pair deep green eyes. "What…I’m Willow."</p>

<p>Kellem smirked as she moved closer, her relief evident. "That’s
for sure. Where’s Buffy?"</p>

<p>Willow blinked and her expression hardened into a glare. "Who are
you?"</p>

<p>That made Kellem freeze and she forced a laugh. "Not funny
Scarlet. What’s going on?"</p>

<p>The nickname made Willow bristle and she pulled out of Tara’s arms
and fully faced the intruder. "I don’t know you, but my name is not
Scarlet. It’s Willow. Now unless you want to feel what its like to be
thrown across a cemetery, I suggest you leave."</p>

<p>Okay this is getting weird. Kellem held up a hand and shook her
head. "I’m sorry. Look something strange is happening here. I think we need
to find Buffy and head to Giles’ for Scooby meet, okay?"</p>

<p>Willow shook her head at the woman’s words and pointed to the
grave. "Buffy’s dead."</p>

<p>Kellem looked at the headstone and paled, her knees giving way.
She hit the ground beside the grave, shaking her head wildly as she
muttered, "No way. Not possible. She can’t be dead. She.." Kellem rose
quickly and gripped Willow’s arms. "This isn’t possible! She can’t be dead,
cause we’re still alive! What happened?!"</p>

<p>Willow jerked away and her eyes went black. "Away!" Kellem soared
backwards several yards and crashed into the side of a tomb. Willow felt
the power surging at her fingertips and resisted the urge call a fireball.</p>

<p>Tara had stepped back and was watching her lover warily. "W-Willow?"</p>

<p>Kellem got to her feet and began speaking. "I don’t know what’s
going on here, but let me tell you what I remember, alright?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded shortly and Kellem began to tell her everything she
knew.</p>

<p>Willow listened quietly until she got to the part about Willow and
Buffy being lovers. "What? Buffy and I aren’t…"</p>

<p>Kellem grimaced. "In my memories you are." She shook her head.
"You and Buffy met me and found out what I am. Giles decided that I had to
be killed but you and Buffy didn’t want to do that."</p>

<p>Willow interrupted again. "What are you?"</p>

<p>A sigh. "I’m a demon."</p>

<p>Willow tensed automatically. "And we didn’t want to kill you? Why
not?"</p>

<p>Kellem ran a shaking hand through her hair. "A lot of reasons, but
mainly because I’m not a evil. I’m a type of demon that can boost another
demon’s power. I was just doing the whole college thing. Trying very hard
not to be noticed by any demons."</p>

<p>"So you and Buffy decided that it would be better if I were bound
to someone safe. That way I wouldn’t become a threat later and you wouldn’t
have to slay me."</p>

<p>"Bound?"</p>

<p>Kellem grimaced. "You and Buffy magically bound me to you both.
We’re connected. Or at least we were. I can’t feel the bond the way it used
to be. It’s weak, distorted. But I do know that you and I should not be
alive if Buffy is truly dead."</p>

<p>Willow glanced at the grave and then back at Kellem. "What do you
mean, truly dead?"</p>

<p>Kellem knelt beside the grave and placed both hands on the ground.
"Help me. If we can feel her essence then there might be a chance."</p>

<p>Willow mimicked the demon’s position and followed her
instructions, reaching out on an intangible plane, searching for that which
was Buffy Summers.</p>

<p>She didn’t recognize the tiny spark until Kellem murmured a
startled exclamation. "There! Catch it! Hold on to it and try to gather it."</p>

<p>Willow could feel herself embracing the spectral form that swirled
around her and Kellem.</p>

<p>Kellem began to curse as the energy began to dissipate. "Too weak!
We need more power!" She opened her eyes and looked at Willow. "We need to
re-seal the bond. We need blood to call her forth."</p>

<p>Willow nodded. "How?"</p>

<p>Kellem grinned and dug a folded knife out of her jeans pocket.
"Blood to blood summons. Not as pretty as the formal ceremony but it’ll do
in a pinch." She paused and stared at Willow. "Do you realize what this
will mean?"</p>

<p>"We get Buffy back?"</p>

<p>Kellem nodded. "Yes, but we will be bound again. The last time it
happened you guys didn’t know what that entailed. I can’t let you go into
this blind again." She detailed the exact nature of what the magikal bond
would be.</p>

<p>Willow paled at Kellem’s words. "Oh."</p>

<p>Tara spoke for the first time. "But Buffy will be back, right?"</p>

<p>Willow looked up at her lover and shook her head. "I can’t do
this, Tara." She stood up and embraced her. "I love you. I just got you
back and I’m not going to toss that aside."</p>

<p>Tara swallowed back the knot of tears in her throat and summoned a
weak smile. "But the world needs Buffy."</p>

<p>Kellem cleared her throat and the witches looked at her. "Um…Don’t
take this the wrong way but why doesn’t Tara join the bond?"</p>

<p>Willow blinked. "Is that possible?"</p>

<p>Nodding carefully, Kellem continued. "It won’t be easy but in
truth we’ll need the extra power to pull this off."</p>

<p>Facing the taller girl, Willow asked a silent question.</p>

<p>Tara bit her lip and considered the ramifications of this. She
could lose Willow and Buffy would be back…or she could share Willow and
Buffy would be back. Or she could knock Willow out and let the dead stay
buried, keeping her lover for herself….nope, not going to happen. Damn
Scooby stuff wears off on you after awhile. "Alright."</p>

<p>Kellem was surprised by the woman’s answer. She wondered if the
Tara or her memories was so understanding. Perhaps she had judged too hastily.</p>

<p>They knelt around the grave and Kellem dug a shallow space in the
dirt. She held her hand over the cool ground and raised the knife to her
palm, speaking the ancient words of the ceremony and drawing the blade over
her flesh in a quick motion. She passed the knife to Willow and coached her
through the spell as the black drops of blood seeped into the hollow.</p>

<p>Willow winced at the pain, but gamely held her own hand out to
clasp the demon’s. The crackle of magik filled the air and she passed the
blade to Tara. The crimson flow mixed with the darkness and dripped into
the earth.</p>

<p>Tara forced her hands to steady as she spoke, not noticing that
she didn’t stutter once through the process. She gripped the other’s hands
and the level of energy increased exponentially.</p>

<p>Kellem waited until the magik was at its peak and then gave the
command to cast the spell. Surging into the ground, the power sought out
that which had stilled and filled it anew. Coaxing the spirit back into its
abandoned shell, the power then healed.</p>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes, gasping as her hands struck out blindly in
the darkness. Her scream of frustration was heard above and Kellem shifted
into her demon state and began to claw through the dirt that separated them.</p>

<p>The lid of the coffin shattered under the force of Buffy’s blows
and she cringed as dirt began to rapidly fill the coffin. She drew a final
breath and began to dig. Upwards.</p>

<p>Kellem had managed to get about three feet down when she
encountered a hand on its way up. She grasped the flailing limb and pulled
the slayer from her grave.</p>

<p>Buffy coughed wildly, shaking the dirt from her hair and trying to
focus on the people around her.</p>

<p>Willow peered back at her through her tears and Buffy realized
that Tara was brushing the dirt from her clothes. "Wil..Willow?"</p>

<p>Willow laughed joyously and wrapped her arms around her best
friend. "Buffy! Thank the goddess!"</p>

<p>It was several minutes before Willow calmed down enough to even
begin to try and explain. Buffy listened quietly, not realizing that she
was being held by strong arms. Strong blue arms.</p>

<p>Kellem buried her face in the slayer’s dusty hair and grinned as
she felt the connection between them all. So close. She had almost lost
everything. Kellem still didn’t know what had happened to make them forget
her, but for now it didn’t matter.</p>

<p>Buffy rubbed her face and grimaced at the layer of dirt that
covered her. "Um..where’s Dawn?"</p>

<p>Willow explained that she was staying with Giles and Buffy sighed
in relief.</p>

<p>Kellem spoke softly. "Who’s Dawn?"</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy and then at Kellem. "She’s Buffy’s sister."</p>

<p>Kellem felt her world tilt and she shook her head slowly. "Buffy
doesn’t have a sister."</p>

<p>Buffy pulled away from the demon’s arms and looked up at the woman
in surprise. She stiffened as she took in the skin color and the small
horns that sprang from Kellem’s forehead. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>Standing shakily, Kellem staggered back, trying to make some kind
of sense of this. "I don’t think I’m supposed to be here." She willed
herself back into her human form and looked at the others. "I don’t
understand this."</p>

<p>Willow’s expression was thoughtful. "When Glory opened the portal
between worlds a lot of weird stuff got pulled into this one. Maybe you
were too."</p>

<p>Kellem laughed harshly. "I seriously hope not. That would mean
that my Buffy and Willow were still bonded to me."</p>

<p>Buffy frowned at the possessive wording. "Yours?"</p>

<p>"We are bonded, mated…lovers." She ignored the slayer’s flinch.
"Without me then the bond will weaken and the three of us will die."</p>

<p>"What about the bond you just made with us?" Tara asked shyly.</p>

<p>Kellem focused on the magik binding them and for the first time
realized that the passion was missing. "It doesn’t feel the same. I don’t
think I’m really a part of this."</p>

<p>Willow closed her eyes and tried to feel Kellem with her mind. She
was there but it was as if she was on the other side of a curtain. Buffy
and Tara were sharp and clear in her mind and she grinned a little at the
feeling of closeness. She opened her eyes. "You’re not within the bond. It
feels like you just mixed the ingredients so to speak."</p>

<p>Buffy got to her feet, swaying as her body took a moment to adjust
to the new position. "We…should find Giles. Maybe he can tell us what’s
going on."</p>

<p>+ + +</p>

<p>Giles watched Dawn stared at the wall in front of her and once
again tried to think of something, anything to draw the girl out. Since the
funeral two days ago, Dawn had not spoken more than a few words and Giles
was at a loss. The doorbell rang and Giles almost smiled in relief. Thank
God! A distraction.</p>

<p>He opened the door and stared at the group in front of him, not
recognizing their leader at first. Giles blinked at the familiar eyes that
were laughing at him and then he knew no more.</p>

<p>Buffy watched Giles hit the floor in amazement as Dawn screamed
her name and hurled herself into her big sister’s arms. "Buffy!"</p>

<p>+ + +</p>

<p>Buffy sank onto Giles’ couch with a relieved sigh and hugged Dawn
close to her. The younger girl had been unwilling to let the slayer out of
her sight and had stayed right outside the bathroom door as Buffy had
showered and changed into a thick robe that Giles had lent her. She still
hadn’t let herself think about that fact that she had died. There would be
time for that later. Buffy watched Xander trying to pull off the man thing
and not give into the tears that simmered just beneath the surface. Anya
had stared at Kellem until the demon had sighed and then shifted into her
demon form, causing the ex-demon to snap her fingers. "You! I know you!
England 1885. You were running from a chaos demon."</p>

<p>Kellem wrinkled her nose and nodded. "Yeah that was me. Got to
hand it to you, though. You sure set one hell of a curse on that guy. I
didn’t even know it was possible to turn a chaos demon into a pig."</p>

<p>Anya grinned at the memory. "Well vengeance was the name of the
game and the woman he scorned could have given me lessons." She shook her
head. "You know she ate him later?"</p>

<p>Kellem grimaced. "Oh yuck! Thank you for an image I did not need!"</p>

<p>Giles cleared his throat and tapped the page he was reading. "I
think I may have found a way for you to return to your reality Kellem."</p>

<p>He outlined the process and Kellem gave him a thumb’s up. "Sounds
solid. So when can we cast?"</p>

<p>+ + +</p>

<p>They made preparations at the Magic Box and Kellem stared at her
surroundings in surprise. "A shopkeeper huh? I’ll have to suggest that to
my Giles."</p>

<p>Giles paused. "Oh? What does he, um I do in your world?"</p>

<p>Kellem shrugged. "Not a damn thing apparently. Buffy says you’re
not her watcher officially but she still treats you like one. After all
this crap with ADAM is over I think you’re planning on heading back to
jolly old England."</p>

<p>Buffy froze and stared at Kellem in surprise. "ADAM? But we nailed
him last year."</p>

<p>"Not in my world. We’re ducking the Initiative flunkies and trying
to stay one step ahead of Soldier Boy."</p>

<p>"Riley? I don’t understand. He’s on our side."</p>

<p>Kellem shrugged. "Um, not since he banged the bad girl in your
body. You sent him on his way and got it on with Willow."</p>

<p>Buffy wasn’t sure how to respond to that. "But that wasn’t his
fault." Why she was defending Riley now she had no idea, but she didn’t
like what this demon was telling her about her other self.</p>

<p>"Look, I wasn’t there. I don’t know why things went down that way.
All I know is that in my world ADAM is still on the loose and you, me and
Scarlet are a very happy thriple." Okay that wasn’t completely true, but…</p>

<p>The blush that bloomed on Willow’s cheeks matched Buffy’s and
Kellem grinned, unrepentant. "You do realize that now Willow, Tara and you
share a similar bond?"</p>

<p>A small choking sound escaped Tara and she stared at Willow in shock.</p>

<p>Giles cleared his throat. "Um, yes. Well let’s continue, shall
we?" They loaded up the supplies and headed back to what was left of
Kellem’s apartment. She wondered where her other self was in this world as
Giles and Willow began to construct a magikal circle in a small area they
had cleared of debris.</p>

<p>Buffy met Kellem’s eyes and pointed outside. ‘Can I talk to you a
minute?"</p>

<p>The demon followed the slayer until they reached the burnt remains
of a large tree that used to shade the building.. "What’s on your mind?"</p>

<p>"There are some things I want you to warn the other Buffy about."</p>

<p>Kellem nodded, but her face showed her doubts. "You realize that
there’s no guarantee that what happened in your world will happen in mine?"</p>

<p>"I know, but just in case…." She pulled a small black book out of
her back pocket and handed it to Kellem. "Consider this the Slayer’s guide
at a glance. I really hope you’ll be able to prevent some of the needless
pain that was caused in my world."</p>

<p>+ + +</p>

<p>A short while later they reentered the building and found the
others waiting for them. Kellem stepped into the circle and waved at
cheerfully at Willow. "If something goes wrong then I want you guys to know
that I’m glad I got yanked into your world. I’m happy that I could help you
get your Buffy back Scarlet."</p>

<p>Willow smiled shyly and lit the first candle. Giles began to
recite the spell as the tapers were ignited and Kellem could feel a tug.
The feeling increased and she didn’t need to look behind her to see the
swirling void open. Her last thoughts were scattered as she felt herself
being separated from this plane and swept into the next.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem groaned as her body protested in a chorus of aches and
pains. She slowly opened her eyes and found herself staring into angry blue
eyes. " Buffy?"</p>

<p>Buffy glared at her as the demon got to her feet and then jabbed
an accusing finger into her chest. "You scared the hell out of me!"</p>

<p>Kellem ignored her tirade and gripped her head, pulling her into a
deep kiss. She ravished the smaller woman’s mouth, knowing that the Slayer
wouldn’t understand, but not caring at that moment. Kellem reluctantly
ended the kiss and sank back down to her knees, waiting for the explosion.
It didn’t come.</p>

<p>Buffy made herself calm down and focus on what had just happened.
Kellem had tried to kill herself. Then the demon had disappeared, scaring
the Slayer badly only to return an instant later. Obviously there were some
questions that needed answers, but one look at the pained expression on
Kellem’s face made Buffy rethink her priorities.</p>

<p>Sensing Buffy kneeling in front of her, Kellem opened her eyes and
saw the chaotic emotions that raced through the Slayer’s.</p>

<p>Buffy reached out and brushed the hair from Kellem’s forehead, not
meeting her eyes. "I’m afraid. I want you so much, but at the same time I
want Willow. I’m afraid that I can’t tell the difference…" She trailed off
and Kellem, remembering where they had left off, finished her thought.</p>

<p>"That you can’t tell the difference between what you feel for her
and what you feel for me."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded and Kellem sighed. "Does there have to be a
difference? I love you both, but I love you in different ways. Willow’s
compassion and warmth fill me with a hope that I didn’t know I needed.
Loving her is soft and sweet, an extension of the friends we’ve become.
Your strength and passion make me want to storm Hell beside you. Loving you
is fire and storm and it hurts, but it’s the kind of pain that makes me
return to you for more."</p>

<p>Buffy felt heat rise in her cheeks and was shocked to realize that
she was blushing. "It’s not that easy for me either."</p>

<p>"Easy? What the hell is easy about being in love with two people?
I feel torn in different directions all the time now. I want to be with
you, to watch you train, to help you slay. At the same time I want to be
with Willow and watch her practice her spells and help her study, not that
she needs help. What’s easy Buffy? When has anything in your life or mine
been easy?" Kellem reached out and slid her hand into Buffy’s hair, cupping
the side of her face. "Do you realize how much I love you?</p>

<p>Buffy sighed deeply and nodded. "Yes." She caught her hand and
pressed a kiss to Kellem’s palm. "I do. I think that’s what frightens me most."</p>

<p>Kellem blinked as she realized what Buffy was saying. "You feel
guilty."</p>

<p>Buffy didn’t answer but she then didn’t need to. Kellem rolled her
eyes in exasperation. "I should have guessed. There’s nothing to feel
guilty about, Buffy. I’m exactly where I want to be."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and took a few steps away. "Because of the bond
Kellem. It’s taken your free will." She met Kellem’s dark gaze
unflinchingly. "I took your free will."</p>

<p>Kellem buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking. Buffy
frowned and started to move to her when the demon’s head whipped up and she
realized that Kellem was laughing. "It’s not funny!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is! Buffy I may be bound to you, but my will is my
own. If it wasn’t then I wouldn’t have been able to attempt the dissolution
ceremony." She got up and absently dusted off her jeans. "You think because
I’m bound to you and Willow that it means I have no choice? You couldn’t be
more wrong. The loving isn’t necessary for the bond Buffy. It’s an
unexpected bonus." Kellem reached out and caught Buffy’s hand, pulling her
to the side of the bed. She pushed the confused Slayer down and then
straddled her before Buffy could react.
 Buffy
was still frowning and Kellem brushed her fingers over the lines in her
forehead. "Don’t you see? I was already falling for Willow before the
ceremony." She ducked her head and nipped at the soft underside of Buffy’s
throat. Her voice dropped and her words rolled over Buffy’s skin like warm
honey. "But when I woke up and found you standing over me…well then I
really had a problem, because all I could think about was how much I wanted
you to take off that robe. And then you did." Kellem’s smile was salacious.
"You could have skinned me alive at that point and I would have enjoyed it."</p>

<p>Her teeth bit a little harder this time and Buffy caught her face in her
hands. She saw the truth of Kellem’s words and could feel the desire
building between them. She warred with herself for an instant before
gripping Kellem’s hair and using it to pull her closer. The kiss was deep
and biting, a silent battle of tongues and teeth. Moments later they broke
apart, breathing heavily, only to attack again. Buffy felt the cloth of her
shirt rip under Kellem’s claws and realized that she had shifted into her
demon state. She instantly gave up the tenuous hold she had been keeping on
her control and gave her desire free rein.</p>

<p>Kellem found herself on her back, but had no time to wonder how that had
happened before her shirt was torn away and a passionate assault was
launched upon her breasts. Kellem’s strangled scream did not slow the
Slayer in her task, but instead spurred her on and soon Kellem’s cries
filled the room.</p>

<p>Willow silently slid into the chair across the room and watched their
stormy lovemaking. Called by their desire and an incredible flare of magik,
she had known that something extraordinary was about to take place. She
resisted the urge to join them, knowing that they needed this time to
themselves, but feeling no need to leave.</p>

<p>Buffy was overcome with the need to make love to Kellem. Not sex,
but making love and as she rolled the hardened tip of the demon’s breast
between her teeth, she realized that she understood the difference now. She
slipped her hand along Kellem’s body and unsnapped her jeans before pushing
them down to reveal her goal. Buffy smiled slightly as her fingers
encountered no underwear and she released Kellem’s breast long enough to
mutter, "My my. What have we here?"</p>

<p>Kellem was given no chance to answer as Buffy ducked her head and ran her
tongue around the hollow of her naval. The demon arched up off of the bed
with a delighted gasp, but Buffy wasn’t finished. Her teeth scrapped along
the flesh of Kellem’s abdomen and she shoved the denim further down, then
off completely.</p>

<p>Willow gripped the arms of the chair tightly and found herself leaning
forward slightly as Buffy pushed Kellem’s legs apart and knelt between
them. Now she’s getting the idea.</p>

<p>The wood of the headboard creaked under the pressure of Kellem’s
hands as she tried to twist away from the intensity of Buffy’s
touch. Strong hands gripped the insides of her thighs, anchoring her in
place as Buffy used her mouth to devour her lover. Kellem cried out when
she felt the slayer’s teeth close over her clit and her claws dug into the
wood.</p>

<p>Quivering in response, Willow shifted restlessly. The room grew
darker as the few lighted candles began to die and she absently lit more
with a wave of her hand as she watched couple on the bed intently.</p>

<p>Buffy felt Kellem trying to twist away and chose that moment to
push her tongue inside her.</p>

<p>Kellem screamed as her body surged, sweeping her into the
maelstrom of sensation that her mistress had created. Violent tremors swept
over her, but Buffy continued her caress, driving the demon higher until
she felt her pleasure crest again.</p>

<p>As the shudders began to fade, Buffy rose onto her knees and
looked at Willow. The smile that slowly spread across her face made Willow
swallow hard. "B-Buffy?"</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and peeled off the rest of her clothes as she moved
across the room. She dropped her panties to the floor beside Willow’s chair
and then gripped the arms as she bent closer. Her breath stirred Willow’s
hair and raised goosebumps across the young witch’s skin. "Now it’s your turn."</p>

<hr>

<p>Willow opened her eyes with a low moan and heard an answering
sound from Kellem. She lay perfectly still in the large bed, unable and
unwilling to move at that moment. In truth she was a little afraid to. The
night’s and the morning’s activities had been…. strenuous. Willow licked
her chaffed lips in a futile attempt to moisten them and then spoke softly.
"Is she gone?"</p>

<p>The pillow she had her face buried in muffled Kellem’s reply, but
Willow heard. "Yeah. I think she left a little while ago." She lifted her
head and stared at Willow through weary eyes. "What the hell was that?"</p>

<p>Willow laughed quietly. "A Slayer. That was definitely a Slayer."</p>

<p>Kellem groaned as she rolled over and joined Willow in
contemplating that. "I thought so. It sure feels like I’ve been slain."
They lay in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she’s coming back soon?" Willow’s tone was mild.</p>

<p>Kellem grinned broadly. "I sure hope so."</p>

<hr>

<p>When the Slayer returned a short while later, she came bearing
food. The rich scent of Chinese made Willow’s stomach do the happy dance
and she started to get up, only to be gently pushed back by Buffy. "Stay
put. I have a plan."</p>

<p>Producing a folding tray, she laid it over Willow’s lap and
unpacked the food cartons onto the small surface. Once everything was laid
out, she stripped of her clothes, much to her audience’s delight, and
climbed back into bed.</p>

<p>They munched contentedly for a time and then Kellem brought up
what had happened before. "I have to tell you where I went when I disappeared."</p>

<p>"Went where?" Willow knew nothing of Kellem’s brief vanishing act.</p>

<p>"I got pulled into a different world. It was like this one but…
Buffy was dead."</p>

<p>Not sure how to respond, Buffy motioned for her to continue. The
story took some time and in the end no one was sure what to say. Willow had
blushed wildly at the mention of her and Tara’s relationship, something
that was not lost on the Slayer. She filed it away for further study.</p>

<p>"The other Buffy warned me of some stuff that was going to go
down. She gave me a notebook full of stuff." Kellem stretched mightily and
the bed moved alarmingly.</p>

<p>Buffy felt herself at the edge of the bed and sighed. "You know we have
another problem here."</p>

<p>Willow turned to look at her as Kellem rose up on her elbow to
see. She peered over Willow’s prone form and laughed. "You mean Willow’s
unfair hogging of the egg rolls?"</p>

<p>The accused’s reply was to playfully shove Kellem and almost upset
the food covered tray that was perched precariously over her lap.</p>

<p>Buffy steadied the tray and nodded. "That too, but I mean this
bed." They looked at the full sized mattress and knew what she meant.</p>

<p>Kellem shrugged. "Sorry, but the room won’t take anything bigger."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded again as if expecting that response. "Uh huh. This is
a seriously tiny room. So’s the apartment for that matter."</p>

<p>Feeling defensive and not sure why since she had to agree that the
place was small, Kellem was a little hurt. "Is there a point to this or are
you just trying to make me feel bad?"</p>

<p>Startled by the accusation, Buffy quickly explained. "Oh no!
That’s not what I-. Let me start over. I think we should get a bigger
place. All of us…. Together."</p>

<p>Willow clapped excitedly. "Oh yes! That would great!" She was
genuinely happy about this but knew that it would never work with secrets
between them. She wondered how to explain, where to begin.</p>

<p>Kellem was astounded. "You’re sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes Kell. I’m very sure."</p>

<p>Willow cleared her throat and looked at Buffy. "We… Buffy I have
to tell you something…. About Tara."</p>

<p>Something in her voice alerted Buffy to the seriousness of the
coming revelation and she tensed. "What is it Will?"</p>

<p>Helplessly Willow stared at her best friend and lover, trying to
make herself form the words that would reveal her betrayal. Silent tears
began to slide down the witch’s cheeks and Buffy’s tension increased.</p>

<p>She set the tray off of the bed and pulled Willow into her arms,
despite the girl’s protests. "Come on Willow, tell me what’s wrong. You’re
scaring me. Kellem?"</p>

<p>Buffy’s eyes asked her what was wrong but the demon only shook her head.
"It’s Willow’s place to explain."</p>

<p>Willow sniffled and climbed out of the bed, leaving Buffy staring
after her in confusion. She tugged her shirt on and grabbed her jeans,
dressing hurriedly. She couldn’t do this naked. "Buffy…. I …I… I slept with
Tara." She immediately winced at the way the words sounded. That makes it
sound cheap, but it wasn’t like that….</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head a little, positive that her ears were playing
tricks on her. It almost sounded like Willow said she slept with Tara. But
that wasn’t possible. "Um, what did you say?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t want…no.. I did want, but I never planned for this to
happen, Buffy. I didn’t expect…" Willow trailed off and waited for Buffy to
speak.</p>

<p>Buffy’s face was stony. "You… slept…. with… Tara…WHY?" Buffy came
off the bed in a burst of movement that made Willow jump and fall back
against the closed bedroom door.</p>

<p>"B-Buffy?"</p>

<p>Kellem stiffened, prepared to step in if she had to.</p>

<p>Grabbing the redhead’s shoulders, the naked form of the Slayer
pushed her against the door and growled, "Why did you do this?"</p>

<p>Willow’s anger sparked and she shoved Buffy away. "I didn’t do it
to hurt you! I did it because.. because.. damn it Buffy… I love her."</p>

<p>Buffy froze, at a loss for how to respond to the quite declaration.</p>

<p>"I never meant for this to happen. I don’t know how to explain
what I feel for her."</p>

<p>"Are you leaving me?"</p>

<p>Buffy’s quiet question made Willow flinch. "No. I… I don’t know
what to do, Buffy! I love you! I love Kellem! But now… there’s this thing
with Tara and it feels as strong as what we have together. Its not supposed
to be this complicated! I don’t know what to do." She buried her face in
her hands and began to cry softly.</p>

<p>Kellem watched the Slayer gather her clothes and slip out of the
bedroom.</p>

<hr>

<p>The current inhabitants of the cemetery found themselves summarily
evicted in a rather permanent manner that evening as Buffy cut a path of
rage through their ranks. She left no headstone unturned and when there
were no more enemies to be found, Buffy went to the next graveyard and then
the next.</p>

<p>It was an hour before sunrise when Kellem found her standing in a
circle of ashes that had once been vampires. She made sure that she was
seen before approaching the Slayer, very much afraid that the woman might
strike blindly.</p>

<p>Buffy dropped the broken tree branch she had been using and nodded
curtly at the demon. "Kellem."</p>

<p>"Buffy." Kellem leaned against a gravestone and sighed heavily.
"Want to talk?"</p>

<p>"I guess we should." She studied the dark haired woman closely.
"You knew."</p>

<p>Kellem nodded. "Yeah, I, um, smelled Tara’s scent on her the other
day."</p>

<p>"And you didn’t tell me this why?"</p>

<p>"Hell Buffy! I thought you knew! I felt it the minute I saw her,
didn’t you?"</p>

<p>From her bewildered expression, Kellem realized that Buffy hadn’t.
"She’s in the mix somehow, Buffy. She’s part of our little gang now."</p>

<p>"But how is that possible?"</p>

<p>Kellem shrugged as she motioned Buffy closer. "Not sure. We could
run a little experiment and find out though."</p>

<p>Buffy stood next to the demon and nodded. "What do we do?"</p>

<p>Kellem took her hand and directed her to close her eyes. She did
the same. "Now focus on me and I’ll focus on you. Try not so much to see me
as to feel my energy."</p>

<p>A few moments later Buffy spoke. "I have you."</p>

<p>Kellem grinned. "I know. I can feel your energy surrounding me.
It’s very comforting. Now let’s find Willow."</p>

<p>Buffy tensed but did as instructed. Soon they were both entangled
with the witch’s essence. Buffy watched the swirl of energy for a moment
and then realized what she was seeing. "What’s that?"</p>

<p>The faint connection that was now winding it’s way through the
trio’s knot of power seemed not so much out of place, but rather it
appeared to be lost, aimless… alone. On the outside.</p>

<p>"That’s Tara."</p>

<p>"She’s… its not what I expected." Instead of trying to pull Willow
away, the energy seemed to be trying to join them.</p>

<p>"No, its not."</p>

<p>Buffy frowned at the drifting force and as it began to slip away,
she impulsively reached for it. Tara was pulled back into the knot,
surprising Willow and Kellem. The unexpected warmth that Buffy felt from
the other girl made her smile.</p>

<p>Tara’s voice echoed through Buffy’s mind. I’m so sorry. I never
wanted to hurt anyone.</p>

<p>The loneliness that filled Tara was evident to Buffy as was the
depth of emotion that she felt for Willow.</p>

<p>Do you understand what joining us will mean? Buffy’s question
shocked Willow and Kellem.</p>

<p>I know… I… I can’t walk away from this.</p>

<p>Willow? Bring Tara to Kellem’s. Buffy reluctantly released the connection
and opened her eyes. She found Kellem watching her. "Looks like we’ll need
to find a really big bed now."</p>

<hr>

<p>When Willow arrived that night, she had to all but drag Tara
inside with her. The shy blonde was terrified that the Slayer and the Jauda
demon were going to be angry with her. Willow had assured her that this was
not the case, but Tara wasn’t listening. "M-maybe I s-s-shouldn’t…"</p>

<p>Buffy pushed the door closed behind the girl and smiled
reassuringly. "Calm down Tara. I don’t bite."</p>

<p>Kellem snickered. "The hell you say."</p>

<p>Glaring at the demon, Buffy motioned the pair towards the couch.
"I think we all need to sit down and talk about our options."</p>

<p>They did and Kellem found herself staring at the nervous young
woman before her. The tousled honey blonde hair that fell to her shoulders
always seemed to shout, ‘just been laid’ and Kellem smiled a little at the
thought. She dropped her gaze, taking in the bee-stung lips that begged to
be kissed and then lower to the marvelous display of cleavage that the
witch so obviously tried hard to hide. Her hips were soft, gently sloping
into gorgeous thighs and it struck Kellem that Tara was a beautifully ripe
young woman. And that she was getting aroused.</p>

<p>Willow cleared her throat and glared at the demon, who shrugged
innocently. "I can’t help it Scarlet. You brought her into the triad,
connecting her to us. I’d have to be blind or stupid not to notice her."</p>

<p>Tara blinked in confusion and then blushed furiously when she
finally got it. Willow patted her hand and glanced at Buffy who had
remained quiet during this exchange. "What happens now?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea. This isn’t exactly in the Slayer’s manuals." Not
that I ever read them. "What do you suggest Kellem?"</p>

<p>The absolutely devious grin that crossed the demon’s face made
Tara gulp and Buffy laugh. "Oh I think we should let the power lead us.
Whatever the bond needs, it’ll let us know."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and leaned close to Willow, whispering in her ear.
Willow nodded and took Tara’s hand, leading her into the bedroom. Joining
Kellem on the couch, Buffy pulled the demon into her arms. "I thought they
should start without us."</p>

<p>Kellem was astonished at the Slayer’s casual acceptance of what
was about to happen. "I didn’t expect you to be so… open to this."</p>

<p>Buffy kissed the flesh of Kellem’s throat above the collar of her
shirt and began to work the buttons loose. "I read the rest of that book
you brought back with you." She pushed the cloth off of her shoulders and
tossed it aside.</p>

<p>"Then you know about Glory."</p>

<p>"Yes. But that’s not why I’m doing this." She caught the tip of
Kellem’s right breast in her teeth and the demon groaned.</p>

<p>"Then, ah! Why?"</p>

<p>Buffy released her prize and met Kellem’s searching gaze. "Dawn."</p>

<hr>

<p>Tara couldn’t seem to stop shaking as Willow kissed her way down
her body. Arousal swelled through her and her mind had lost the ability to
verbalize a while ago. She never heard the bedroom door open or the other’s
entrance. It wasn’t until another mouth caught hers that she realized they
were there.</p>

<p>Kellem plundered the sweet mouth under hers and knowing that Buffy
was watching them only inflamed her more. She raised her head and held out
her hand. "Join us, Mistress."</p>

<p>The bed protested faintly as the weight increased but no one was
listening. Buffy smiled at the pale face that was staring up at her with
nervous eyes. She reached out and brushed her fingers across the swollen
lips that Kellem had just released. Tara couldn’t stop the sigh that
escaped anymore than she could contain the cry that followed it when Willow
reached her center and began to do things to her that she had never dreamed of.</p>

<p>Kellem eased behind Willow and began to touch her, sliding her
hands over her skin and making the redhead’s temperature rise. Buffy moved
her arm under Tara and lifted her upper body into her arms. She stroked
planes of Tara’s face, memorizing the way her face changed in passion and
then began to rain tiny kisses across her face and shoulders until Tara was
gasping. Buffy carefully breached the threshold of Tara’s lips, almost
timidly exploring the tempting depths.</p>

<p>Willow’s shout of pleasure announced Kellem’s success in making
her lose control and Buffy smiled against Tara’s lips. She pulled away and
beckoned Kellem closer. "Touch her Kellem. Show her what’s waiting for her."</p>

<p>Kellem’s smile was the personification of sin as she lowered
herself next to Tara, who tensed as the demon shifted form. Tara felt the
light skritch of claws tracing her thigh and began to shudder.</p>

<hr>

<p>Tara slowly moved Willow’s arm from around her and slipped from
the bed, reaching for her shirt. She pulled it on as she watched the
figures sleeping in a comfortable tangle. Willow mumbled in her sleep then
rolled over slightly, her arm sliding around Kellem, who was spooned in
behind Buffy.</p>

<p>She left the bedroom and wandered into the kitchen, still trying
to sort her jumbled thoughts. Tara took a coffee cup from the drain and
opened the refrigerator. She filled the cup with milk and then set it into
the microwave to heat. Round and round the cup turned and Tara could
sympathize with it: she was just as turned around.</p>

<p>Stopping the machine before it beeped, she carried the mug to the
couch and settled in to contemplate what she had done. Images whirled
through her mind and she closed her eyes in reflex.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the night she had forgotten just why it was she was
doing this. It wasn’t until she found herself being held by Willow while
Buffy thrust into her did she remember. Oh yeah. I’m in love with Willow.</p>

<p>Still, she was unsure of where she stood now in all this. She
could almost taste the metallic tang of blood on her tongue as she recalled
the moment the demon had bared her throat to Tara.</p>

<p>Unaware of the glow in her eyes, Tara had not understood what was
being offered until Kellem she had reached up and drew a single claw over
her throat, leaving a trail of ebony blood in its wake. There was no time
to consider what she was doing then, as the bloodlust swept through her and
Tara found herself on top of the demon, sucking greedily at the wound.</p>

<p>Tara shivered at the memory but it was not in revulsion. The
bedroom door closed and she glanced up to see Buffy watching her. Not
knowing what else to do, Tara remained quiet.</p>

<p>Buffy curled up on the couch and smiled. "You okay?"</p>

<p>Tara shook her head slightly. "I don’t know. It doesn’t seem real,
you know?"</p>

<p>Laughing softly, Buffy nodded. "Oh boy, do I! I thought I had lost
my mind the day after we bonded with Kellem."</p>

<p>"I don’t know what to do now."</p>

<p>Buffy understood. "That’s up to you for the most part. I’m not
sure how this is going to work myself, but I do know that I love
Willow. She, Kellem and I are going to be moving into a larger apartment
soon. You’re welcome to join us."</p>

<p>Tara wasn’t sure what to make of the offer.</p>

<p>"The only thing I can assure you of is that I am not giving Willow
or Kellem up. You can be part of this or you can continue to stand outside."</p>

<p>The slight quaver that shook Tara’s cup made Buffy feel bad about
her tone and she reached out to steady the woman’s grip as she tried to
ease her words. "Don’t think that Willow is the only reason we’re making
this offer, Tara. I like you. And despite what you may have heard about me,
I am not the diehard bitch that everyone seems to think. Besides, you’ve
tasted the blood now. It’s not easy to walk away from. Even if you do,
you’ll probably have to return to us periodically to renew the bond
anyway." Buffy smiled brightly. "Why not stay and help us fight the good
fight?"</p>

<p>Willow had to smile at that, but she was on edge as she waited for
Tara’s answer.</p>

<p>"I want to join you… but I’m not… I’m not sure what good I’ll be."</p>

<p>Willow made a startled sound, revealing her presence. She moved
across the room and knelt on the floor beside Tara. "Don’t say that. You’re
a seriously talented witch!"</p>

<p>"No, I’m not. I’ve read a lot, but I don’t have anywhere near the
power that you do."</p>

<p>Kellem staggered into the room and glared at the threesome, bleary
eyed. "After last night, I’d say that you could hold your own with Scarlet,
Baby." She headed into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. No way were
they doing the girl chat thing without caffeine. She tried to focus on the
wall clock and groaned when she read the time. "Christ! It’s 4:30 in the
morning!"</p>

<p>Tara wasn’t sure what she meant by her previous comment but she’d
ask her later. Right now Willow was giving her the ‘puppy eyes’ look and
she could feel her heart melting. "So now what?"</p>

<p>"Food." Kellem grabbed the cordless phone and hit number three on
the speed dial. "I’d like to place a delivery order. I want three large
pizzas…."</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem snarled loudly as she charged forward, making Giles jump as he
watched from the corner. Buffy’s only reaction was to duck the swinging
claws and roll forward, bringing herself into position behind Kellem. A
quick snap kick that should have brought her down swept harmlessly through
the air as Kellem was no longer there. Buffy felt rather than heard the
rustle of cloth that warned her of the demon’s strike and she dodged the
blow easily.</p>

<p>Kellem kept pressing the attack, moving in and out, working Buffy
back towards the corner. Out of the corner of her vision she could see the
balance beam behind the slayer but didn’t take her eyes off of her opponent.</p>

<p>Buffy blocked a flurry of punches and then suddenly launched
herself backwards, coming to rest atop the thin rail. "You weren’t trying
to corner me were you Kellem?"</p>

<p>Her tone was playfully reproachful and Kellem responded in kind. "Me
Mistress? Of course not." She leaped onto the beam and struck a defensive
pose. "Why on earth would I do that?"</p>

<p>Buffy crouched low to avoid a high kick but it was only a dodge and she
felt herself slip off the wood as Kellem’s foot dropped to hook around
hers. She hit the floor with a thud and Willow winced in sympathy.</p>

<p>Buffy stared up at the ceiling for a moment before flipping herself up and
to her feet. She smiled ruefully at Kellem. "That was my bad." The
explosion of blows that followed had Kellem retreating quickly.</p>

<p>When she felt herself flying through the air, Kellem knew that the match
was about to come to an abrupt end. The sound of breaking wood filled the
air and hid the sound of the door opening. Buffy and Willow were at
Kellem’s side instantly, helping the demon to sit up. Willow could feel the
pull of magic and ran her hands over the deep bruise on Kellem’s shoulder.
"It’s just a bruise. You’ll be fine."</p>

<p>Kellem laughed, but she was touched by their concern. Maybe things were
going to be all right after all. She grinned impishly and leaned forward to
kiss Buffy lightly on the lips. "Nice shot lover, but I’ll be prepared for
that next time."</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes and returned the caress. "Then I’ll have to think of
something new. Gotta keep you on your toes." She stood up and helped Kellem
to her feet before turning to Giles…. and her mother. Oh hell. "Mom."</p>

<p>Joyce Summers shook her head as Buffy started to speak and held up a hand.
"No. Me first." She looked at Willow and then at Kellem, then back to
Buffy. "Just answer me one thing Buffy; who is it that you’re… involved with?"</p>

<p>Willow blushed furiously and Kellem shifted uneasily. Buffy took a deep
breath and answered her truthfully. "Willow…and Kellem…and I guess Tara now
too."</p>

<p>Joyce blinked. "I…see." She took in Kellem’s demon appearance with a calm
she did not feel and forced a smile. "Um, Kellem? Just what…. are you?"</p>

<p>Kellem swallowed hard and shifted her form back to human. "I’m…" she
glanced at Buffy, silently asking for permission. A slight nod and Kellem
faced Buffy’s mother again. "I’m a demon."</p>

<p>Joyce swayed slightly but stayed on her feet. A demon! "A demon?
How…interesting. Buffy? Can I talk to you a minute? Alone?"</p>

<p>Buffy grimaced and nodded. "Why don’t we head home and I’ll explain on the
way?"</p>

<p>"Fine. You’re driving."</p>

<hr>

<p>Joyce drained her wine glass and resisted the urge to refill it. Buffy’s
explanation had been completely reasonable if you ignored certain facts
about what she was saying. "So you and Willow are… bound to this demon."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "So is Tara but we’re not sure how strong that is yet."</p>

<p>"How long will this last?"</p>

<p>Buffy was slow to answer. "Well that’s the thing. I’m not really sure…" She
saw the impatience growing in her mother’s face and blurted it out.
"Forever. Or until something kills us. Which won’t be easy because the bond
makes us almost impossible to kill now."</p>

<p>"But Buffy, how do you know you can trust this…demon?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Kellem. And I know I can trust her because of the bond. She
can’t hurt us Mom." Buffy averted her eyes. "She’s in love with us."</p>

<p>"Us? Buffy do you hear what you’re saying? You can’t be in love with three
people!"</p>

<p>"That’s what I thought. I was wrong. Besides I’m not in love with Tara. At
least not yet anyway. I hardly know her."</p>

<p>Joyce closed her eyes and counted to ten. Then to twenty. It was no use.
She opened her eyes and focused on Buffy with a determined frown. "Buffy
I’ve just managed to accept that fact that you’re a Slayer. I was still
working on you and Willow being together, but now this?" Joyce shook her
head wearily. "I was ready for teen dating. I was ready for possible
experimentation with alcohol and/or drugs. I had the ‘Talks’ all planned
out in my mind." She refilled her glass and drank half of it in one gulp
before turning to face her daughter. The vampire slayer. The lesbian…. "How
am I supposed to react to this?"</p>

<p>Buffy shifted uneasily on her feet. "I don’t know. But there’s no way to
change this. The bond is unbreakable."</p>

<p>Joyce swallowed back the sharp words that sprang to her lips. "I just want
you safe."</p>

<p>"I am safe Mom. Kellem would never hurt me."</p>

<p>"She’s right. I’d die before hurting her Mrs. Summers."</p>

<p>Kellem stepped into the kitchen and Buffy saw Willow and Tara behind her.
"Sorry to interrupt, but we kinda figured you could use a hand explaining
things."</p>

<p>Willow nodded quickly. "And since this concerns us too…"</p>

<p>Joyce Summers did not appear too happy to see them and Kellem knew that
this was going to be more difficult than she had originally thought. "My
name is Kellem Duivel, Mrs. Summers. I know that you have absolutely no
reason to trust me. Why should you? You don’t even know me. I pop up in
your daughter’s life and suddenly she’s doing things you never would have
imagined. It makes perfect sense that you’re worried and suspicious. I
can’t stop you from worrying, but I can tell you who I am and just what it
is your daughter has done." She paused and then leaned back against the
counter. "I was born Florence Italy in the year 1786. My mother’s name was
Genevieve. I don’t know who my father was, she never told me."</p>

<p>"I am a Jauda Demon, which sounds fiercer than it is. Outside of strength
and a long lifespan, there’s not much power within us. My kind is the
rarest form of demon in existence. You see, when we’re bound to another
demon or being of power we become generators for the master," She glanced
at Buffy and grinned. "Or the mistress that bound us. We’re servants."</p>

<p>Willow made a sound of protest and Kellem shook her head. "I know you don’t
think of me like that, but stripped to the basics that’s what I am. I serve
you both because of the bond." She met Joyce eyes. "But I love them both
because I choose too." Kellem laughed shortly and shook her head. "That’s
egotistical. I love them because I can’t not love them. They’re each too
special in their own right. I was lost long before I was bound."</p>

<p>She was looking at Buffy as she spoke the last and Joyce could easily
hear the strong emotion in the demon’s voice. "I see. But what about Tara?
I don’t understand."</p>

<p>Buffy grimaced at the thought of the coming explanation but gamely plunged
ahead.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem leaned forward and poured herself a cup tea, earning a smile from
Giles. None of the Scooby gang seemed to like tea, but Giles had
steadfastly continued to prepare it for their meetings in the vague hopes
that one day they would realize what they were missing.</p>

<p>She sat back and Willow patted her thigh, whispering, "Good move."</p>

<p>Giles hadn’t been too thrilled at first with Willow and Buffy’s insistence
that Kellem and Tara be included in the meetings, but even he had to admit
that having another demon and another witch’s knowledge to call on might
prove extremely useful.</p>

<p>Kellem responded to Willow’s unconscious desire and let her hand drop to
the witch’s thigh, where it began to move in small circles. Not realizing
what she was doing, Tara began to toy with the strands of hair at the back
of Willow’s neck. The slight sigh of pleasure that escaped Willow went
unheard by everyone but Buffy and Kellem.</p>

<p>Forcing herself back to the matter at hand, Buffy willed herself to stop
watching her lovers and ignore the tang of desire she could now smell in
the air. Time enough for that later.</p>

<p>Xander blinked rapidly and swallowed several times. He opened his mouth but
no words would emerge, only a strange gurgling sound. Anya smacked the back
of his head and he seemed to recover, but was still unable to form speech.</p>

<p>Willow sighed and pushed Kellem’s hand off of her thigh as she
reached up to catch Tara’s hand in her own. "Down girls. Xander’s brain
will melt."</p>

<p>Buffy bit back a smile and continued with her report of last night’s
patrolling. "So it was a pretty tame evening all things considered."</p>

<p>Giles filled his teacup and began to pace around the room. "Have you run
into any members on the Initiative?"</p>

<p>Buffy grimaced and shook her head. "Nope. Not a one."</p>

<p>Kellem held up a hand. "Actually I had a little scuffle with them several
days ago."</p>

<p>Stopping in front of the window, Giles sipped his tea and studied the group
behind him in the window’s reflection.</p>

<p>Buffy was not pleased to hear this. "What happened? And why didn’t you tell
us?" Her voice had altered slightly as her agitation grew and power crept
over the room like a vibrant wave.</p>

<p>Kellem straightened, setting her cup on the table. "I’m sorry Mistress. I
hadn’t realized that you wanted to know."</p>

<p>The room shrank to the two of them as Buffy focused on the demon with
barely restrained emotion. "I want to know anything that happens to you."</p>

<p>Kellem nodded slightly, resisting the urge to fall to her knees. "Yes
Mistress." The erotic promise in Buffy’s eyes almost undid her and she felt
her heart begin to thud almost painfully.</p>

<p>The air was filled with sexual tension and Xander was wheezing as Giles
cleared his throat. "What, um, what were they doing? The Initiative I mean."</p>

<p>Kellem shook her head, breaking eye contact with difficulty. "Uh…what?"</p>

<p>Giles repeated his question and mentally counted to twenty in Sumerian as
he felt his body reacting to the situation. Obviously there was a danger of
fallout from their bond.</p>

<p>"I was coming out of the library and they jumped me."</p>

<p>Willow was puzzled. "You were in your demon form?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I had been studying. Oddly enough the librarians frown on
blue skinned demons in the building."</p>

<p>Tara giggled as Willow stuck her tongue out and Kellem smiled seductively.
"I warned you about that."</p>

<p>"And I thought me and Xander talked about sex a lot."</p>

<p>Anya’s snide remark was ignored and Buffy clapped her hands. "Okay people!
Back to the point. What happened?"</p>

<p>Kellem shrugged. "I came out and found myself surrounded. We fought a bit
and I left them lying on the sidewalk. Alive, but lightly pummeled."</p>

<p>"I wonder how they knew you were a demon?" They discussed possible reasons
for a time and then Buffy announced that she was heading out for her
nightly rounds.</p>

<p>Kellem held up a hand and whipped a small black book out, thumbing through
it. "Um, I have some stuff here on what the Initiative is doing and where
ADAM is holed up."</p>

<p>Buffy blinked in surprise. "And you were going to share this when?"</p>

<p>"Well you didn’t seem to want to know before. I said that the other Buffy
told me about some stuff that was going to happen. Did you think I meant
who was going to win the Superbowl?"</p>

<p>Kellem flipped to a particular part that had concerned her and focused on
Willow. "Apparently in their world healing spells don’t work right for some
reason." She met Buffy’s eyes. "So when your mom got sick there was nothing
that could be done."</p>

<p>Buffy paled at the implications. "Mom?"</p>

<p>Kellem was quick t reassure her. "Don’t worry Buffy. Willow can easily fix
the brain tumor before…" She trailed off as Buffy leapt forward and grabbed
Willow’s hand.</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<hr>

<p>Joyce stared at the group that had just burst into her kitchen in
amazement. "What’s going on?"</p>

<p>Buffy wrapped her arms around her mother and held on for dear life. Joyce
returned the embrace, but her confusion was evident. She looked at Giles.
"Giles, what is this?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well that’s rather difficult to explain."</p>

<p>"Okay, Buffy. Let her go so I can check okay?" Willow placed a comforting
hand on Buffy’s shoulder. "Could you sit down Joyce? I need to make sure
you’re all right."</p>

<p>Once seated at the table, Joyce watched closely as Willow drew on her new
abilities and laid her glowing hands on the older woman’s head. The warm
energy sank into her and Joyce closed her eyes at the wonderful feeling.
She felt calm and well, the day’s tensions had disappeared, leaving her
relaxed and content.</p>

<p>Willow found the tiny imperfection and swiftly dealt with it, knowing that
left alone, it would grow until it took the woman’s life. She slowly
withdrew and released Buffy’s mom as her legs turned to jello.</p>

<p>She didn’t fall though. Tara and Kellem were there to steady her and the
demon swept the exhausted witch up into her arms, holding her easily.</p>

<p>"Willow?" Buffy went to her lover’s side and reached for her hand, frowning
at the cool touch. "Are you okay?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded sleepily. "Uh huh. So’s your mom, Buffy. I fixed it."</p>

<p>The tears that escaped from her daughter’s eyes alarmed Joyce. "Buffy? Will
someone please tell me what’s going on?"</p>

<p>Kellem jerked her head towards Giles, Xander and Anya. "You guys tell her.
We’ll take Scarlet to the couch in the living room."</p>

<p>Giles tugged off his glasses and began to polish them briskly as Xander
started rifling through the cabinets for munchies. "Well you see, it all
started when Kellem was pulled into a parallel world…."</p>

<hr>

<p>Xander set the box down in the large living room and looked around
curiously. The kitchen was off to the left where Tara was busily unpacking
foodstuffs and he could see the dismantled parts of Willow’s computer in
the room in front of him. Xander walked down the short hallway, passing the
bathroom and a small closet. He pushed the last door open and stared at the
mammoth four-poster bed that dominated the room.</p>

<p>Kellem dropped a stack of boxes behind him, making him jump. "Something wrong?"</p>

<p>Xander swallowed and glanced at the bed again. "Nothing’s wrong, just
looking at the uh, view! A nice view of the uh," he looked out the window.
"Of the parking lot. Yeah."</p>

<p>Kellem threw an arm around his shoulders and grinned. "Nice isn’t it? The
uh, view I mean."</p>

<p>He nodded mutely and Kellem leaned closer, whispering, "That’s why we chose
this place, you know? Had to have a bigger... view."</p>

<p>Willow cleared her throat and Xander sprang away from Kellem as if they had
been doing a lot more than standing there. She set her box on the king
sized bed and then turned to them, her hands firmly on her hips. She
marshaled her sternest look. "Boxes people, boxes!"</p>

<p>Unrepentant, Kellem winked and followed Xander back downstairs. They past
Buffy and Giles on the stairs and she debated giving into the urge to goose
Giles as they passed.</p>

<p>Buffy noted the twinkle in her lover’s eyes and shook her head slightly.
"Play nice." Sometimes she was just a little too playful for her own good.</p>

<p>Her disappointment evident, Kellem let the opportunity pass.</p>

<p>Giles waited until she had gone and then looked at Buffy inquiringly.
"Problem?"</p>

<p>"Not really. Just a frisky Jauda demon. We’re finding out that they really
do take after their cousins…. a lot."</p>

<p>Giles ignored the sudden flush stealing over his face and started climbing
again. Well he’d asked for it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem smelled Spike before she saw him. The distinctive mix of cigarette
smoke and graveyard dust weren’t clues in themselves, but added to his
horrible taste in cologne, well… She waited until they had moved past a
couple strolling along the street and then ducked into an alley to wait for
him.</p>

<p>Spike smiled evilly and pitched his cigarette away before stepping closer.
"Out for a stroll?"</p>

<p>"What do you want Spike? I’m in a hurry."</p>

<p>The smirk that crossed his features irked Kellem and she shook her head as
she turned to go. "Fine."</p>

<p>She was unprepared to feel his arms wrap around her, jerking her off her
feet. The world tilted wildly and she found herself looking at the ground
as Spike gripped her hair, exposing her throat. "It’s not nice to walk out
during dinner. Especially when you are dinner."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Spike chuckled "Got it figured, see? I may not be able to snack on the
walking happy meals around here, but you’re a different sort altogether."</p>

<p>Kellem twisted frantically but the hold he had her in allowed her no
leverage. She felt a flash of pain and cursed as the vampire began to
drink. Her vision began to cloud and she let herself go limp.</p>

<p>Spike shifted to get a better grip on the now dead weight and that’s when
Kellem moved. She rolled forward and up, causing Spike to lose his balance
and fall to his knees. He looked up as she delivered a brutal kick to his
face and sent him flying backwards. She didn’t stop, following him as he
tried to scramble away, landing blow after blow to his retreating form.</p>

<p>"Hey! Ease up! Can’t you take a joke?" Spike protested as she grabbed his
booted foot and swung him towards the steel dumpster. He hit the upraised
lid and fell inside. Kellem slammed the lid shut and bent the latch so that
he could not escape. "Bloody Hell! This reeks!" He shoved on the lid, but
it didn’t yield. "Hey! Come on! Let me out!"</p>

<p>Kellem could still hear his faint cries as she crossed the street and
headed for home.</p>

<hr>

<p>Whatever greeting Joyce might have made was halted when she saw the wound
at the girl’s throat and the dark blood staining her clothes. "Buffy!" She
closed the door and guided Kellem to the couch. Buffy appeared and a
wordless exclamation escaped her.</p>

<p>Kellem smiled, trying to minimize what she knew had to be a gruesome
picture. "I’m sorry about this."</p>

<p>Buffy touched her lips, halting her words and making Kellem sigh. "Don’t
be. What happened?"</p>

<p>Kellem shrugged as Joyce returned with a large medical kit. "I feel silly
saying it, but I got jumped by a vamp."</p>

<p>Buffy cleaned the wound with an antiseptic soaked cloth, making the demon
wince. "Sorry."</p>

<p>The front door flew open and Willow and Tara entered in similar
states of alarm. "Buffy? Is she all right?"</p>

<p>They looked at them in amazement. "How did you know she’d been hurt?"</p>

<p>Willow knelt beside Kellem and cupped her face with her hands,
tilting her head so that she could see the wound clearly. "We just knew."</p>

<p>Kellem glanced at Buffy and shrugged. "Don’t ask me. This three-way binding
thing had some unusual side effects to begin with. Now that we’re at four
strong it’s anybody’s guess." She stopped speaking as Willow touched her
throat and magik filled the air.</p>

<p>The flesh seemed to flow together like liquid and a moment later there was
no trace of the bite. "All better."</p>

<p>"You have got to show me how to do that." Tara smiled shyly.</p>

<p>Kellem chuckled at Willow’s words and leaned forward to kiss her lightly.
"Thank you, Mistress."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled fondly at them for a moment and then grew serious. "Now, who
did this?"</p>

<p>Shifting nervously, Kellem hesitated. "Is it really important? I feel
stupid enough for letting my guard down in the first place." The unshakable
look on her mistress’ face was answer enough. "Um, it was Spike."</p>

<p>"Spike?" Willow’s tone was amazed. "But Spike can’t do that anymore!"</p>

<p>Kellem let Buffy field that one. "He can’t bite humans, Will."</p>

<p>"Oh. I guess he can do that then. But why would he? I mean, besides the
whole bloodthirsty killer thing."</p>

<p>"Did I ever mention that Succubae blood could be consumed by vampires? And
is considered to be something of a delicacy for them?"</p>

<p>"No, strangely enough that slipped your mind. Anything else you’d care to
share?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think so." Kellem shrugged slightly. "A lot of things are just
automatic. I don’t realize that I’m the only one that knows about them
until they come up."</p>

<p>The timer on the oven pinged and Joyce was grateful for the
interruption. "Why don’t we talk over dinner?"</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy shoved the stake into Spike’s chest, just missing his heart. "Now
let’s see if you’ve gotten my point Spike. Kellem is not a numy treat for
you, understand? You touch her again and I won’t miss next time, got it?"</p>

<p>She jerked the stake out and Spike fell to his knees gasping in pain. "I…
got it, Slayer." He slowly got to his feet and donned a sneer. "Nobody
snacks on the bint but you, right?" Spike groaned as she punched his wound.</p>

<p>"Please remember that the only reason you’re not cavorting with the dust
bunnies is because of that chip in your head. All I need is a good reason,
Spike. And believe me, Kellem is more than good enough." She tossed the
bloody stake at his feet and strode out of the crypt.</p>

<p>"God I love it when you go all butch." Kellem fell in behind her as she
moved across the cemetery.</p>

<p>Buffy scowled fiercely. "Oh shut up."</p>

<p>"Make me." Kellem danced out of range and called tauntingly, "Big, bad
Slayer can’t catch me!"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah? Watch me!" She sprinted after the demon and the chase was on.</p>

<p>From her perch on top of a nearby tomb, Willow watched them play and
smiled as she returned to her studying. Tara peered anxiously over her
shoulder as she read. She had gotten the spell to get her and Willow up
here to work. Now they just needed to figure out how to get themselves down
again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kellem froze as she scented something familiar on the breeze. Her voice
dropped to a whisper. "Buffy? I think those Initiative guys are around."</p>

<p>Buffy moved closer. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I smell gun oil."</p>

<p>"Neat trick. Any idea where?"</p>

<p>"Um, they’re probably after the three vamps that just emerged from that crypt."</p>

<p>Buffy watched the trio coming towards them and nodded. "That’s a Duh!"</p>

<p>They walked out to meet their foes with a casual stride. "Good evening
gentlemen. Care to save us some effort and fall on a picked fence?" Their
ferocious snarls answered Buffy’s question and Kellem laughed.</p>

<p>"I really do love your job Mistress."</p>

<p>"It’s a living." Buffy pulled a crossbow from her pack as she spoke and
took out the closest vampire. The other two looked at their fallen friend
and then at Buffy who was reloading.</p>

<p>They ran in different directions and Kellem shifted form. "Bet I can bag
mine before you get yours."</p>

<p>"Loser buys ice cream?"</p>

<p>Kellem’s laugh turned wicked. "And the winner gets to lick it off."</p>

<p>"Deal."</p>

<hr>

<p>Riley saw the vampire burst from the bushes and charge towards him as he
calmly sighted the creature. It leaped at him and then was gone. He blinked
slightly and heard something behind him. Riley whirled to face Buffy.
"Buffy!" A pile of dust lay at his feet, Buffy’s crossbolt having pierced
its heart. "I could have handled it."</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged and reloaded the weapon. "I’m sure, but that’s what a Slayer
does." Her smile was anything but humorous. "We slay." She saw the bruises
on his face and one eyebrow rose. "Been wrasseling with the boys?"</p>

<p>Giles, Willow and Tara, now officially known as the leaders of the research
team, had been searching for the spell that the other Buffy had used to
stop ADAM but until they were ready, Buffy had decided to keep up her
normal patrols and pretend that she didn’t know where the mechanical
nightmare was at.</p>

<p>Riley started to respond but froze as his eyes caught a flash of movement
behind Buffy. "Behind you!" He raised his gun as Buffy whirled to see Kellem.</p>

<p>Buffy had no chance to explain before Riley fire two quick shots, sending
the demon reeling. "Kellem!" Buffy’s leg swept out in a sharp snap kick,
sending the gun spinning into the bushes. Riley stared at her in surprise
as she hurried to Kellem’s side. "You idiot! She’s with me."</p>

<p>The sky overhead was crystal clear tonight and the stars were sparkling.
Kellem absently pointed this out to Buffy as she knelt beside her, but her
lover ignored her weak attempt at humor. "How bad is it?"</p>

<p>Kellem reached up and stuck her finger in one of the holes in her chest,
making Buffy wince. "Well I’m not going to die, but it hurts like hell.
When did hunting season for Jauda open anyway?" She pulled the blood
stained shirt away from the wounds and swore faintly. "Damn, Willow gave me
this shirt."</p>

<p>She tried to sit up but Buffy held her down. "No. Lay still. Willow is on
her way." She stood up and glared at Riley. "Well that was a wonderful
display of testosterone. Want to go kill a harmless animal now?"</p>

<p>Riley stared at Buffy in dismay. "She’s a demon!"</p>

<p>"No kidding! What was you’re first clue?"</p>

<p>"She took out an entire squad Buffy. She’s dangerous."</p>

<p>Buffy realized then that he must have gotten the bruises when they had
attacked Kellem. She shoved him back and he went flying. "You were one of
the goons that jumped her the other night."</p>

<p>Riley slowly got to his feet. "She’s a demon. We catch demons. It’s what we
do." His tone was mocking and set the Slayer off.</p>

<p>Buffy stared at him, her fury evident. "You stay away from her Riley. Keep
the goon squad away from her, understand?"</p>

<p>"I can’t promise that."</p>

<p>The air seemed to crackle as Buffy stepped closer. "I don’t think you
realize what I’m saying. If anyone attacks Kellem again then they’ll regret
ever laying eyes on her. She’s with me. So tell your men to back off and no
one will get hurt. Is that clear enough for you?"</p>

<p>Thunder rumbled and Riley could have sworn that the earth trembled as she
spoke.</p>

<p>He didn’t answer and Buffy resisted the urge to strangle him. Instantly
Riley clutched his throat as invisible hands gripped him. As he fell to his
knees Buffy managed to rein in her temper and release him from her mental
hold. He began to cough wildly, but Buffy felt no desire to aid him.
"Serves you right."</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow’s tone was admonishing. She smiled down at Kellem and
quickly placed her hands over the wounds, only to have the demon catch them.</p>

<p>"The bullets are still inside, Mistress."</p>

<p>Willow cringed but nodded. "Okay, then we need to get you home first." She
looked at Buffy, ignoring Riley’s sputtered questions. We need to go.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. Willow hadn’t spoken but she had heard her clearly. She
helped Kellem to her feet and they propped her up between them, beginning
the walk back to the apartment.</p>

<p>Riley watched them go, wondering why he suddenly felt afraid.</p>

<p>Buffy looked around and glanced at Willow. "Where’s Tara?"</p>

<p>Willow blushed slightly. "Um, there was a little miscalculation in the last
spell we tried."</p>

<p>"Is she okay?"</p>

<p>Mumbling under her breath, Willow answered. "Oh yeah, if you ignore the
fact that I sort of teleported her back to the apartment."</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy settled Kellem on the couch as Willow went in search of Tara. The
calm knocking was a good clue to her whereabouts and Willow unlocked the
balcony door to let the other witch inside.</p>

<p>Tara grinned at the embarrassed blush staining Willow’s cheeks and teased,
"You need to work on your aim, Honey."</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you open the door yourself?"</p>

<p>Tara shrugged. "And miss the look on your face when you realized just where
you had beamed me to?"</p>

<p>Kneeling beside Kellem, Tara held her hands over the first bullet wound and
formed a picture of the projectile in her mind. She felt the magik pulling
at the metal and slowly it began to move, retracing the path it had torn
through Kellem’s flesh.</p>

<p>A cry of pain escaped Kellem as the bullet left her and sweat broke out
over her body. Buffy immediately gripped the demon’s hand and smiled
reassuringly. "Almost done."</p>

<p>Kellem laughed shortly. "What is it about me that makes the men in your
life want to kill me?"</p>

<p>Buffy pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Green-eyed envy of course."</p>

<p>"Hmm. You owe me ice cream."</p>

<p>With the last bullet removed, Tara moved aside and let Willow do the actual
healing. It had turned out that the healing ability that Willow had was not
common, but then neither was Tara’s manipulation of inanimate objects.</p>

<p>Kellem ran her fingers over the newly healed flesh and smiled. "Thank you
Mistress."</p>

<p>Willow didn’t blush at the name, much to Kellem’s disappointment.</p>

<p>Buffy was frowning thoughtfully at Willow. ‘Will/ Why is that healing Mom
wiped you out, but two bullets holes don’t even make break a sweat?"</p>

<p>"Actually I’ve been wondering about that myself Buffy."</p>

<p>Kellem sighed and shook her head. "Isn’t it obvious? It’s not the what but
the who."</p>

<p>"Okay, that needs go through some kind of filter, Kell so that it comes out
in English." Buufy ducked the pillow thrown in her direction.</p>

<p>"I mean that your mom isn’t part of our group. I think it takes more to
heal an outsider, no matter how serious the injury really is."</p>

<p>Willow agreed absently with the theory and then excused herself to go in
search of Tara, who had not returned.</p>

<p>Tara tossed the bloodstained cloths into the washer and stared at the knob
until it depressed and the cycle began.</p>

<p>Willow slipped her arms around her and kissed the back of her neck, making
the blonde shiver. "And you said you weren’t powerful."</p>

<p>Tara turned around and met her lover’s eyes, words lying heavy on her
tongue but unable to release them.</p>

<p>Seeing the look, Willow rested her forehead against Tara’s. "Tell me."</p>

<p>Tara dropped her eyes and spoke softly. "I… I want to be yours."</p>

<p>Knowing that there was more to her statement than the obvious, Willow waited.</p>

<p>"I... I’m jealous of Kellem."</p>

<p>"Honey, there’s nothing to be jealous of. I love you."</p>

<p>Tara shook her head. "You don’t understand Willow. She says you’re her
Mistress." She blurted out the words. "IwantyoutobemyMistress."</p>

<p>Willow slowed the sentence down and replayed it at normal speed. She wants
me to… The grin that spread over her face made Tara blush furiously. Willow
held her tighter and caught Tara’s earlobe between her teeth. She felt the
thrilled shudder course through Tara and laughed huskily. "I already am."</p>
