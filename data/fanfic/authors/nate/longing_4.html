<!-- Longing With a Cherry Tomato on Top \ Chapter 4: The Pros and Cons of Romancing Paris Gellar -->

<p>There are those who are in the love 'industry' that will tell you
that an attraction can start at the oddest and most inopportune time
possible. The romance novelists, writers for soap operas and romantic
comedies and those analysts running those dating sites on the internet
seem to live on this theory and try to convince everyone who buys their
ideal that Cupid is always hovering over you and that significant other,
ready to release the arrow at anytime and start the gears of attraction
into motion faster than Jessie Spano's Vivarin overdose on <i>Saved by
the Bell</i>.</p>
<p>Let's just say I don't really believe that. In my own opinion, Cupid
stuck his arrow into me two years ago, but instead of being fast acting,
the effects of it have been slow to take root, like a cancer or
Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Okay, eww, fine, that's a bad example, but apply that analogy to a
more positive situation and you'll see what it means when it comes to my
attraction to Paris.</p>
<p>It seemed innocent and such a throwaway line two years ago that
fateful Parent's Day when I found out that my mother was having more
than parent-teacher conferences with my <i>Lit 201</i> teacher, Max
Medina. Paris had found out as she passed by that they making out in his
classroom, and her attitude then being sour towards me, spread the
gossip like wildfire across the school, I never saw it coming. After I
found out she had poured the kerosene on the rumor, I had nothing but
hate for her. I wanted her to feel as if she was the weak one in our
little rivalry, and I was actually prepared to use fists to achieve it.</p>
<p>I had thankfully calmed down by the time I decided to make a truce
with her. I approached her eating her lunch with Madeline and Louise
after she made some offhand comments about Mrs. Gellar sleeping with a
teacher, and told her we needed to talk. The other two girls seemed to
draw their claws out before she called them off, and it was just Paris
and I.</p>
<p>Everything else about that meeting is just a blur besides the fact I
gave her an opening that if she ever needed an ear to listen to her
problems, she had it in me. She was kind of off-hand about it, but I
knew she would come around eventually, thus the state of our friendship
today.</p>
<p>But the little joke she made before I took her to task for spreading
the gossip about Lorelai and Max caused me to become disturbed for a
moment and brought me off my train of thought.</p>
<p>"You're not going to kiss me are you?" she asked, with a wide smile
spread across her face. If it wasn't for the fact my mother was becoming
a sexual being for the first time in years with someone who could play
with my grades, I probably would've brushed it off, which I did on the
outside, and went on to call her on her crap.</p>
<p>Before I did, there was this weird flash in my mind of dropping my
book bag to the ground, taking her by the hand and into my arms, and
just planting a nice big smacker right on her lips. My shy reserved
little self was pretty shocked by what my mind had just come up with,
and I was strangely not repulsed by the image planted within. I had
remembered a month before at the Formal her own reaction to me
accidentally finding out that her date was her cousin, and her anger at
me finding out about that fact. Her forehead was completely scrunched
and she had bent down right to my face level to go off on this odd
tangent that I was going to ruin her because of the small information
that Jacob was her cousin, when really I felt so much empathy for her
because I had hoped Tristan would've bought a clue, along with a ticket
to the dance for a girl so smitten with him instead of that vapid Cissy.</p>
<p>I hadn't ever really looked at her before then as another girl, just
as a classmate. But she had on this Kermit-green formal gown which went
down to her ankles, yet on top was cut so that a lot of skin was exposed
in her front. She just had so much cleavage showing on that dress, and I
took in everything in front of me and wondered why she would ever be
stuck with taking a relative to the dance. Paris looked very cute, and
as I remembered her anger at me for finding out about her odd dating
arrangement, I realized something I wouldn't have expected to ever
happen to me; I was having thoughts about her like I had Dean! I also
had offered her an opening in my heart, no strings attached.</p>
<p>So I did what I do best when I feel like I have a problem; denial. I
put a wide gulf between that weird 'Paris is cute' feeling and those I
did have with Dean. With Tristan involved with my love life back then he
became the backup defending Paris from sliding into home position. Even
when Dean let me go after I couldn't say those three words, I obscured
that in a wild move of abandon by trying to bury it in a honey-do list
for myself and Madeline's party, where kissing Tristan seemed like the
best way to end that conflict. Unfortunately, my love for Dean came back
with a string of tears, and along with it a feeling of betrayal against
Paris. I had promised myself I wouldn't touch Tristan, and just like
that I felt if she found out we'd never have a friendship.</p>
<p>The Bangles concert came through my synapses as his lips touched
mine, and Paris' declaration as her friends abandoned us for some party
that <i>Eternal Flame</i> was her favorite song. In the context that it
was in, seeing it third person, it didn't look like anything abnormal.
But the timing of her words, along with the smile she gave me and the
eerie green sheen coming from the spotlights creating interesting
shadows on her face, to me, it seemed like something out of a romantic
movie. Dean was nowhere around, my mother was far away in the back edges
of the balcony with her best friend, squinting to see what seemed to
barely look like Susannah Hoffs, and there Paris and I stood, her
friends gone, making such a cute declaration.</p>
<p>At the time, I put on a face of indifference and sighed, knowing she
was just over-stimulated from being taken from her comfort zone of
studying and into the own little happy world Mom and I inhabited. Then
when she said this was the best night of her life, in addition to seeing
her friends eviscerated by Lorelai, I continued to attribute it to her
abandoning her competitive drive temporarily and wanting to finally
start a friendship.</p>
<p>Of course you know the see-saw that happened after all that, with me
hooking her up with Tristan and then her misconstruction of the PJ
Harvey tickets. I then spent most of the summer after Dean had
successfully reacquired my love in the courtyard with Tristan watching
basking in nothing but heterosexual feelings for Dean. Paris didn't even
enter my conscious as we built the house together, and we kept up our
childish fighting.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Shakespeare project though, there were signs
that the innocent little joke she made in the heat of an argument was
actually begging to be answered realistically. Tristan had pulled all
his crap, and she started finally rubbing the Vaseline from her eyes and
seeing him for the jerk he was. She was distracted, and the flame she
had for him was snuffed out, so she put 130% into the project. Which
meant she projected a lot of anger towards Tristan, and I got a little
more of a taste of her passionate side.</p>
<p>Her life <b>became</b> the last scene of <i>Romeo & Juliet</i>.
She'd call in every script revision she made, every little change in
scenery, and then the fact we were going to rehearse on my home turf.
Little did I know that the whole situation would make me see the light
when it came to men.</p>
<p>That when two men who have the hots for me got into the same room,
they become total assholes. Paris and I seemed to be the only one with
our hearts in the project at all, while Tristan was using the situation
as a big transparent excuse to get into my corset in front of Dean. I
thought my boyfriend would be the mature one, but instead he acted like
an overprotective jerk. Until that moment, Dean seemed to be the one
with the most pull on my soul.</p>
<p>Then I kept finding myself looking for help in Paris' eyes. Her
commanding demeanor and push for me to be Juliet no matter what seemed
to affect my performance a hell of a lot more than Tristan could ever
cause. Dean certainly wasn't helping his case by acting like my personal
bodyguard. I actually thought 'fuck you Dean' so many times during that
whole thing I didn't want to touch him, much less look at him.</p>
<p>I thank God every day now that Tristan robbed that safe and got sent
down to North Carolina. Without his stupidity I would've been buried in
some soap opera-ish love triangle thing, and with that, I didn't have to
face those artificial 'feelings' that flared up after the piano kiss.
With him leaving, Paris was free to come in like a bat out of hell and
get my focus off the devastation of losing a familiar teasing face. She
put on the Romeo wig and told me to get ready to reenact like I never
had before, and in her own joking way, suck on an Altoid. She didn't
kiss me and faked that last move during the 'thus with a kiss I die'
spiel, but it seemed more in fear that Dean wouldn't take it too well
than in revulsion. I think that because her head seemed to lie on my
chest just a little longer than usual, and I swore she smelled me. No
matter, her adrenaline was probably piqued from actually getting to earn
our grade, and just was breathing a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I just would've loved to tell Dean when he asked in the diner if we
did rehearse the kiss "Of course Dean, and let me show you the big ol'
hickey she planted on my left tit before she slid three fingers between
my folds and screwed me 'till the cows came home, we did way more than
kissing backstage." Too bad I wasn't thinking of her that way when he
asked, the reaction would've been fun.</p>
<p>I've had so much time to recall those little things Paris and I have
shared over the last two years as I sit in a class that I'm only taking
for the shiny gold seal under 'English and Literature Merit' I get on my
diploma, <i>Russian Novelists and Their Works 401</i>. When you're in a
class that even Paris hates (and trust me, she loves every class),
that's not a good sign. I've had to read some of the dullest crap ever
to come out of a pen and printing press, when the evaluation comes up
after the final exam where I have to write down what I thought about
this class, I'll be creating my own long-winded and boring novel
describing how draining Mr. Mercurio and his love for Russian literature
has been on my will to learn. This is the only class I half-ass,
reading the Cliff Notes and doing whatever it takes to get an A without
actually putting an effort into the class at all.</p>
<p>I have to admit however, it's helped me on one front. Whenever I
don't have to read yet another dull Tolstoy plot point that has nothing
to do with either war or peace, I've been adding on entries to something
I keep hidden from everybody and deep in my backpack, and since Mr.
Mecurio never goes past his own desk, I'm free to write whatever I want
in a project I've been working on for the last two weeks. I like to
call it 'Pro and Con; Romance with Paris Gellar'.</p>
<p>I started doing it on a whim one night when I was bored and all my
homework was done, and my mother was working at the Inn. I turned to the
back of my notebook, drew a line in the middle of the page, and wrote
pro and con in big bold letters on the top line of the sheet. I also
made up a sheet for Dean, in the case that Paris' cons outweighed her
pros, thinking that because I loved him I'd have filled up the left
side with reasons to keep him and knew for sure my little lesbian crush
was just a phase.</p>
<p>Dean, I'm sorry, I stopped your list a few days ago when the pros
were soundly defeated by cons 35-12, and even more sadly, in a
college-ruled notebook. Yes, the things that attracted me to him at
first were right in the pros, like the fact I loved him, he's a good
kisser and he built a car for me, the obvious things. But those were
taken out of commission by the cons that he dumped me for awhile because
I didn't feel the same, his kisses no longer turn my knees to jelly,
and his car is back in the junkyard, proven unsafe by Grandpa and fated
to become a scrap metal cube when a little squirrel ruined things
between me and Jess for awhile, and Dean's attention to safety was
lacking since I had my arm in a sling for most of spring. Also not
helping his cause was a big con that he distrusted me around anything
else with a penis, he'd probably beat Brad to a pulp if he told me my
hair looked cute in a ponytail!</p>
<p>With that list finished, I was free to concentrate on the girl who
gave me a summer to remember. I honestly tried to drive everything she
did into the cons column, scraping my mind for anything. But I only have
about five items under the cons list right now, even those are little
things.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li>She doesn't like Luke and thinks he runs a brothel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paris was trying to get the Oppenheimer and hoping for a bite that
there was a dark side to my town, so Luke became the victim of her
drive. Once I can get her to know him though, I'm sure he'll relent. She
does like Jess as a friend, helping her cause plenty with Luke. I'll
also clue her into his long time crush on Lorelai and reveal him as far
from depending on revenue from prostitutes, everyone in town already
knows about their mating dance.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li>Paris abhors my diet and keeps trying to make me eat healthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once she gets a good taste of Luke's cooking and I can pull away from
her health freak of a mother, she'll take it up. Though it's cute that
she likes tofu and drinks soy milk.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li>Stars Hollow is too stifling and all the people are too wacky for
her liking, she thinks most of them are hicks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could make the same argument that she doesn't know one person on the
cul-de-sac she resides on, and some of the high society matrons of
Hartford are way too doped up on Paxil to be considered sane. At least
Kirk is good for the occasional juvenile laugh, and Taylor's an
interesting enigma.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li>She talks in her sleep, keeping me up at night.</li>
</ul>
<p>I live with Lorelai, who acts like a ten-year-old when she really wants
something and wakes up to the sounds of either mooing or meowing. I
already get woken by my mom at least twice a week for some little
unimportant thing and am used to it. Paris just talks in her dreams,
which I eventually tuned out in DC when it became clear she wasn't going
to get herself off in one again. Plus, it's cute and something I'd
recall as such when I'm old and in a rocking chair. If I can't get to
sleep, I have two choices, NyQuil or getting myself off so I eventually
pass out, it isn't as if she's a loud snorer.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li>Paris would break my heart when she found someone else, or might
disassociate from me if I admit I like her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not such a little point there, but it's definitely possible; I can't
talk myself out of this con. I only have small clues to guide me towards
what she feels for me, so she might not be lesbianic, not even bisexual.
If she did feel the same for me, I might just be a gateway towards
someone cuter, a Gina Gershon or Sheryl Crow-type woman later on, I
don't know. But if I'm just her schoolgirl crush, at the very least I
have to take a risk and hope it can last longer than these last few
months at Chilton. I don't want to keep this silent, marry a guy I'm not
in love with, and see her at the altar with the man or woman she used
to dissolve her crush on me if she held one herself, and have to think
'what might have happened if I had told you I liked you Paris?'.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's all of the five reasons, all lonely on the right
side of my notebook. Over to the left however, I've pro'ed so many
things that on the surface might seem like cons, but upon further
reflection I've erased and put on the the other side. For example;</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li>She owns medieval hardware and isn't afraid to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To any boy who might have found this fact out, they might think Paris
is some kind of whacked Xena nut and flee from her screaming bloody
murder. When she brought out her sword as a prop for the project it
freaked the living daylights out of me at the time. But when I thought
about it in conjunction with my crush, I kind of found it arousing. If
her family has passed down weapons to her, it has to mean she has enough
interest in them to train on how to use them, I've fenced her in class
before and she was a very worthy competitor. I've imagined her sleeping
with me, and a burglar decides to break in through the window, trying
to start some trouble. She'll unsheathe some dagger she has under the
bed, and with her training the guy'll be too scared to mess with her
unless he has a fetish for flesh wounds.</p>
<p>Oh, and I had a <i>Buffy</i>ish fantasy about Paris slaying demons
in a graveyard a few days after I came home, and woke up in a cold sweat
due to what she did to my dream self to 'exhaust the energy'. For that
alone, weapons usage goes on the pro list.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li> Our arguments would be passionate and arousing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll talk more about that later. Moving on...</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li> I'll see the world with her at my side.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still plan on backpacking with Lorelai in Europe when I graduate, but
unless Grandma springs for my own private jet, I won't be leaving the
States very often after that. Paris however, I remember her trying to
get me off Washington's beaten path and tour much more than the area
around the Mall. We actually went into the city and Georgetown and she
went into detail about things I didn't know about our nation's capital.
She knows the hidden little things about cities, states and countries I
would have never known if she hadn't turned me on to reading beyond the
tourist brochures. Touring Fez would be the trip of a lifetime if she
could come with me, and I'm sure she'd spoil me rotten giving me a
vacation to remember.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li> Paris understands the way I think.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to dumb down things to Romper Room level when I talk to Dean
about anything that doesn't involve a hemi or transmissions, and when I
argue book talk with Jess I try to keep opinions from the real world out
of the debate since Jess isn't heavily invested in current events or
topics that bore him. With Paris, I can talk at her level and she'll
never go 'huh?' at any of my responses, arguing right back in a smart,
cultured and witty way. Discussions that would end up like Fox News
pundit segments with the boys would be much more like an enlightened
conversation with Bill Moyers if I and Paris were a couple.</p>
<ul class="page">
 <li> Lorelai could become her second mother and be much more
supportive than her real mom.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not all about me; though Lorelai would keel over once I exposed my
secret, in time she'd relish the fact she could turn Paris from the
automaton that Mrs. Gellar groomed her to be, into an actual girl with
thoughts besides those that are academic. At first those two getting
along all the time will be an iffy proposition, but I certainly never
predicted that Paris would wind her way into my heart from her first
impression two years ago. She currently talks above my mother's level,
but I think she'd definitely take her in the complete package that comes
with me, who wouldn't want to have Mom as a mother-in-law? She'd love
it and finally have a shoulder to cry on that isn't paid for by her
father; Francisca's been more of a mother figure than Sharon Gellar
ever will be, and she's just Paris' nanny. I've heard her say nothing
but positive things about her father so I'm not as scared of him as I am
the woman who borne her; she even has a little humanity for her
paternal side and calls him Daddy rather than the ever-unchanging and
groaned out 'Mother' used to describe Mrs. Gellar.</p>
<p>I've been building this list from scratch and continue listing at
least one new pro about her daily. But I have to admit, I've been trying
to come out of my shell and looking for new things I don't know about
Paris to list. So I've started doing things to try to subtlety clue her
in that maybe I do have an interest in her. A controlled experiment you
could call it.</p>
<p>I started out small with simple wardrobe changes that wouldn't
startle Lorelai before I left for school. Instead of hosiery covering up
my legs, I've been wearing short socks beneath my school shoes. Very
few other students in the halls have noticed the change, and Louise
hasn't started calling me a slut for losing them, but Paris seemed a
little more distracted in the life sciences class I share a table with
her in. My legs have accidentally brushed up against hers more times
than when I was wearing the hosiery and I'm honestly sure that's far
from a coincidence. With the issue of the hemlines approved by
Headmaster C, I had Mom raise my own hem at least an inch and a half.
It's enough to remain conservative, but just enough to expose a little
more thigh.</p>
<p>I've also become more hands on when it comes to the <i>Franklin</i>
and she's been giving up some of her editorial power to me and letting
me get my hands a little dirty. That's meant I've been pounding the
pavement and trying to get advertisers like banks who wouldn't even
consider a high school newspaper to give us a try, the acquisition of
the new printing press has certainly helped when it comes to circulars.
We've also been cutting out any of the student writers who want to
pander down to the base level by writing nothing but 'Administration,
yay!' and 'Go Blue Demons!' stories. Paris has become much more
impressed with my work ethic, and really appreciates what I've been
doing to help with the <i>Franklin</i>, even finally thanking me for
the help on that damned curtain story that won us the Oppenheimer. That
means that attribute is in the pro column again. I'm still embarrassed
about that whole debacle to this day, how do you explain to some
teenager you hardly know whining that he couldn't rent <i>Nude Bowling</i>
that I'm the one to blame for Stars Hollow Video being more chaste than
certain places in Utah?</p>
<p>So basically what it's come down to on finding more Paris pros is
becoming an instigator to probe deeper into her. I didn't feel very
comfortable in the new role I put myself into; I've always been more of
the follower, especially where Dean has been involved. She's always been
shy around boys however, more so than me despite Madeline and Louise
giving her inappropriate sex hints whenever they can. There had to be a
way outside of an academic setting to draw her out and find out how she
would tick in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>Then it came to me in gym class last week; I'd suck up my usual sour
feelings for physical activity and try to prod her into competition.
Usually I only get physical when it involves running for the bus when
Mom put my pop tart in the toaster a little late and there was barely
time for it to cool before I ate it. I totally sucked fulfilling my
intramural competition requirements for the Blue Demon golf team a
couple years ago, finishing last in the entire Charter Valley Conference
out of eighty other golfers from ten schools my sophomore year.</p>
<p>Still, I psyched myself up when I heard we were going to do a field
hockey unit in class and were going to play a full head-on game in
Wednesday's class. Monday, we learned the skills and strategy of the
game, and Tuesday was when the class went over the rulebook. I got my
regular coffee from Luke's those days, but dumped it down the sewage
grate before I got on the bus (if Lorelai found out I'm sure she wept,
but I had to sacrifice to the cause here!) and drank Powerade from the
dining hall's vending machine before gym class in order to keep my
energy strong. I researched some stretching exercises from the internet
to keep myself limber in case my arm decided to refracture or I pulled a
muscle in the match.</p>
<p>The worst sacrifice of all; I drove myself to have seductive dreams
for those three nights about Kirk, and his mom in the same room to kill
my sex drive until Wednesday morning! That's right, I dreamt of the town
bachelor's form of romance in order to gag any temptation to touch
myself to the sounds of Paris' voice, and abstained from making out at
all with Dean so the sexual energy that built up in those three days
would instead flow up my stem to hit that part of my brain where
adrenaline flowed from. I still thought of her in that tight gym t-shirt
and those shorts, but this time instead of us staying relatively clean,
I was going to get down and dirty with her, and she'd never be the
wiser by the time she realized it. Competition is her fuel, and I
hypothesized once she got the idea, we'd be at each other's throats in
a different arena than usual for once.</p>
<p>10:00am had finally come, and I thought myself up a little pep talk
as I dressed in the locker room. If I did find something up with Paris,
I was going to know right away. I was also convinced that we were going
to get dirty that day, since the evening before the skies had opened up
and left the field outside a little soft and muddy. <i>Perfect</i>, I
thought to myself as I stood next to Paris, awaiting the eventual whine
from the team captains that they were stuck with the class geeks to pick
last.</p>
<p>This time however, they were going to get much more than our usual
small efforts to the cause. I felt very nervous as I took my stick and
ran with Paris to our forward position just a little far from the goal.
Technically we should have most of the shots on goal, but the strategies
of both the teams pushed us back towards the center line away from the
shooting curve so that the others wouldn't have depend on our usually
pathetic athletic skills to win.</p>
<p>We went out to our positions, and Paris of course, looked
immaculate. Her gym clothes, like mine hadn't been dirtied in at least a
couple months, and her eyes were rolled as Ms. Paschke went over the
rules and told the class she expected all of us to give 100% effort.
There's just something about looking at the girl you have Sapphic
feelings for and knowing in just a few minutes things between you and
her were about to get a lot closer than before.</p>
<p>I didn't let her onto my plans at first, lulling Par into a false
sense of security. I'd occasionally get the ball passed to the zone I
was assigned to with her and quickly see it off to one of my more
aggressive teammates. She'd get the ball occasionally and do that same
thing, and I'd challenge her very lamely. I was definitely filling my
role well as Rory Gilmore, sports wallflower.</p>
<p>Around seven minutes in though, her team had taken a two-goal lead
from mine, and I found myself with the ball against my stick. Looking
down at the sphere and using my head to compute the trajectory and the
angle of the shot, I aimed and prayed that it would somehow make it past
everyone and the keeper. I shut my eyes, and heard a yelp from one of
my teammates as the ball crossed the goal line and made a little
'swoosh' sound as it hit the back of the net. I smiled and raised my
fist, happy with the result as I heard the cheers from a couple of my
teammates. 'Good shot Gilmore,' and the somewhat complimentary 'So nerds
can play sports, nice attempt'. Yeah, some things about the plan, I
wouldn't have minded tuning out.</p>
<p>Paris gave me a surprised look as we got back into our starting
position, and asked why I'd want to participate. I told her not to be so
stubborn and to have some fun for once, and slowly she got into the
game. Based on my good goal I started getting the ball more often from
my team and instead of taking a shot right away, tried to goad Paris
into defending for her own team. At first her strategy was lame, trying
to knock at my stick or shimmying around me to try and catch a pass I'd
make and avoid my reaction. Eventually I had to start trying to prod her
vocally. I reminded her of past victories in exams and tests, along
with that PSAT score that almost drove her into a mental institution
because I didn't reveal it until two weeks after the fact. "Come on
Gellar," I'd yell at her in my roughest voice as we scrimmaged, "You
call that defense? Brad could play better than that!"</p>
<p>After awhile, she started becoming a little more aggressive and I
was finally able to see the results of my effort put into action. She
started bringing out that energy she reserves for class and challenging
me when she could for possession of the ball, our sticks clashing
together at every opportunity. I felt the soles of the Cons I bought for
gym class heavy with mud, and noted that though they look and work fine
when you're far from athletic, purple Chuck Taylors really can't handle
the stress of an aggressive field hockey game.</p>
<p>But besides that, things were working out well. I was playing good
defense, but Paris occasionally got a shot passed me and into the goal,
giving me a taste of my own medicine with an utterance of "In your face
Rory!". I was so out of my element and I'm sure she was too, but we both
loved every moment of it. Something had been building in our protests
against gym class for the last two years and we were starting to kind
of...like it.</p>
<p>Though to be honest, it was more about the physical contact between
Paris and I that was spurring me on. When she got in position to take a
pass, I tackled and brought her down to the ground, trying to stay legal
within the rules. Then she did the same to me. One scrimmage she even
grabbed at the back of my shirt and I could hear the seams tearing from
stress as she gripped it for dear life preventing me from reaching my
stick out to intercept the ball. That not only got me angered from her
aggressive play, but it was turning me on! I felt my breasts tighten
against my sports bra and my heartbeat speed even further than the
adrenaline and exercise was already doing to it. Every little touch,
grab, grope and shove from Paris' hands and body caused me to become
disorientated as I tried to make hay of the situation the ball was in,
and I couldn't take the fact that my plan was working out much better
than I originally had expected!</p>
<p>She had attempted to pull my hair a couple times in the heat of
competition to bring me down to the turf, so I had to tear out the
rubber band the braid was in and unfurl it before she could bring me
down again. With that move though, Paris seemed to get this look on her
face like she was an untamed animal. I was so aroused by the way she was
playing the game I didn't even notice my teammates anymore; they were
there just to pass the ball and start another session of untamed
groping and collisions between Paris and I. I kept forgetting that phy
ed was only a 75-minute class and kept losing track of time; Paris had
also truly got into the game.</p>
<p>Geeze, I was becoming so dirty! Everything on my person seemed to
either turn brown or red; the red being blood shielded by my socks once
Paris had taken a swipe at my ankles with her stick, I wasn't about to
let the teacher know that though; she couldn't put me back on the
sidelines if she tried. I heard yelling and cheering whenever Paris and
I fought for the ball, and there was just something so hot about getting
a chance to grab at her waist during a skirmish and not being yelled at
for it. She wasn't objecting at all, things seemed to start working
themselves out well.</p>
<p>Just before the end though, is something that I can't stop but think
about each time I go to bed at night. The score was all tied up and my
team was starting to tire out, my body seeming to finally realize that I
was being physically active instead of sedentary for once. All that
energy saved up from dreaming of Kirk was dissipating and one of Paris'
teammates had passed the ball hard towards her so she could attempt the
go-ahead goal. Her face seemed to take on a look of shock for being
trusted with such a tough proposition, and she was just barely aware
herself. Her soaked shirt was tight against her frame and her eyes
struggled to stay open, as I nagged myself for not telling her I
intended for her to be so active.</p>
<p>Still, something stirred up within as her stick touched the orange
plastic sphere, and all I could think was I needed to not only save the
game for my team, but find one last excuse to get aggressive with her
before we left the field and resumed our pretty much solitary
existences.</p>
<p>I untangled myself from the grip of a guy keeping me back from the
ball and ran for the other side of the field and towards her. She was
pretty much open to make the shot, but when I grunted she turned around
and I found my vision clashing with hers.</p>
<p>I had an opening. She was looking down somewhere else (where I
couldn't tell since my vision was a little blurred from a drop of
perspiration in one of my eyes), and before her or I knew it, I had
stretched my stick out and hooked it around her left leg. She stumbled
around and regained her footing, keeping the ball in check.</p>
<p>That didn't work, so as other teammates congregated around both of
us in anticipation of the ball popping out, I rushed towards Paris and
grabbed at her arms, causing her to yelp. I then found myself with very
little footing since the rubber of my sneakers was totally caked with
mud, and tried to steady myself by grabbing onto her other arm. I
failed, and Paris and I tumbled to the soft turf of the athletic field
together as the momentum of my crashing into her was far from over.</p>
<p>I heard the sound of Paris' stick being dislodged from her hand, and
the butt end rubbed up against the bottom of my stomach as we went down.
All the other students saw the ball pop up from our small heap and down
the field, and immediately raced to catch back up to it, our little
predicament quickly forgotten in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>My teeth maintained the growl from before, and the front of my skull
hurt from bashing into Paris', but I was still somehow conscious. Paris'
eyes darted back and forth, a good sign that she was fine, but I noticed
that she was kind of stunned. Her mouth was opened and I felt a drip of
sweat fall off my bottom lip and down into it between her teeth.</p>
<p>But what I really noticed was the inopportune fact that her right
knee was right between my legs, and was dug right into my crotch. That
same fragrance she had when I watched her fuck herself in the dorm was
in my nose, and I could swear she was clenching her legs around my
thigh. Her eyes were transfixed to mine, and there was this little
moment where I felt her breath in my mouth and just wanted nothing more
than to kiss her and wonder if all this physical contact was all worth
it in the end.</p>
<p>But then the gym teacher got our attention and wondered if we were
all right. The moment was lost, and we complimented each other on
putting so much effort in the game, got up and dusted ourselves off. We
had to take it easy for the last few minutes of the game per the
teacher's orders because she thought we were getting a little too rough,
and finished the game rather unexceptionally. Someone on my team scored
one more goal and we won 9-8. Paris didn't seem broken up, but it was
such a great match I had to congratulate her.</p>
<p>I shook her hand and thanked her, and she gripped it pretty strong.
In turn I tightened up my grip on her hand. I let go before she could
catch on, and she started to trudge back towards the gymnasium building
while the teacher complimented me on my effort and decided to give me a
little extra credit for the way I took my academics and placed them into
game situations. She then let me go, and I prepared myself to go back
to class.</p>
<p>It was about at the threshold as I got back into the building when I
remembered the real reason I hated gym class. I looked down at my
muddied and dirtied self, and had forgotten in the rush to build up that
Paris pro, that I was going to get all messed up and I was going to
stink for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>"Shit, Rory!" I cursed to no one, and realized that I was going to
have to jump in the shower for once, lest my A for the unit and extra
credit was revoked. I had been in the stall many times before, but those
times I rushed in and out because Hartford's water supply doesn't agree
with my hair or body, at least in shower form. Also one day after class
a couple years ago, Summer had teased me about my nakedness and whipped
a wet towel at my backside to intimidate me. That pretty much killed my
excitement for communal showers.</p>
<p>Worse, this time I was going to probably see Paris nude and all wet
as she cleaned off her own grime. The analytical side of my brain told
me to ignore any feelings I might get from sharing a stall and ignore
her state. <i>Relax, she might even be gone by the time you get in
there, you got in late</i>, my conscience tried to assure me.</p>
<p>But as I got into the locker room and started to take off my gym
clothes, desire had taken over everything as I looked over the results
of my endeavor. My socks were soaked with a thin line of blood from
Paris' stick slash, and I thanked myself for deciding to bring along an
extra clean pair just in case that ever had happened. I took off my grey
gym shirt and shorts, and didn't expect much from the game.</p>
<p>Thank God I decided to change in a stall that day instead of out in
the open! My breasts were fully aroused in my sports bra, nipples peaked
and one of them had almost wiggled out of the cup, I could see the
underside of my right one. I felt all flushed upon seeing that, but that
would end up looking tame compared to when I pulled down my shorts.</p>
<p>I looked down myself, and couldn't believe my eyes. Usually when I
wear underwear they stay stubbornly opaque, and I wear panties with as
much cotton covering the front as I can. But when I looked down that
day, they had soaked through so much, I could make out the outlines of
not only the area down there, but where the hair down there ended, and
bare skin began. I brought a finger to the large wet patch, and could
tell that wasn't just rain and sweat soaking them! All that competition
had gone up to my brain like planned, but I guessed that with my thighs
rubbing up against each other as I ran, along with all that lust of
seeing Paris in such an aroused and competitive state and our collision
where Paris' knee ended up against mine, those factors combined together
to make me drip like a rusty spigot.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!" was all I could utter as I took my clothes off, my
lust-filled brain trying its best to not succumb to temptation, I wanted
to rub myself off so bad! Somehow I shook off that feeling, and wrapped
myself in a towel, grabbing my soap as I headed for the shower. I could
easily remember the only other time I had gotten that wet; in that dorm
room as Paris and I individually got ourselves off. My fantasies had
been refueled, and I crossed my fingers, hoping that Paris took her
time showering. Talk about killing all those showering fears!</p>
<p>Let's just say the shower was sort of interesting. Paris was in
there and I struck up a conversation with her about this whole field
hockey thing we did. She was kind of jarred by it all and I hid it
behind the cover that if I'm not active Ms. Paschke is going to be iffy
about giving us an A in the class. I couldn't help but feel her eyes
dart onto my body several times during the shower, and though it seemed
light-hearted, there was a sort of pall over it. She didn't know my
motives for the whole thing, and I couldn't gauge her reaction all that
well.</p>
<p>So thinking at the time it was a good idea, I decided to ask her a
question that was so out-of-character, so unlike me, but that could make
her mind spin for an answer. I just up and asked it without any
hesitation.</p>
<p>I asked her if my chest was too flat.</p>
<p>Not a question you'd normally hear being asked by a girl to a girl;
almost like if Jess dropped his pants one day and wanted Dean's opinion
on his size. But it would certainly get Paris' attention away from the
usually droll questions asked in school.</p>
<p>Even through the spray of the shower, I could tell she was blushing
and looking down towards me to solidify her response. She then laughed,
and somehow I took offense to that and almost backed off, embarrassed.
Thankfully she clarified that my breasts were perfectly sized.</p>
<p><i>Damn, she firmed up on me</i>, I thought to myself. So I then
concentrated my eyes on hers, pointed at them, and faked a whine by
wondering why her's were larger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it didn't have the effect on her I had been expecting,
she turned back into her shy self, made up something about genetics
being to blame, and Paris fled the shower before I could say anything
else. The way she frowned before she turned around and left me in there
stunned, I could tell there was something underlying that caused the
casual conversation we had to come to a sudden halt. I felt horrible,
but I had to get to the bottom of it all.</p>
<p>However after the incident she seemed to start to ignore me, and I
thought she was starting to catch on to my hints too much and was
getting ready to give me the cold shoulder. Whenever I got within arm's
reach of her the next few days, she either moved over, took the next
seat or walked away. I wanted to apologize for the question but she
would change the subject so fast there was nothing I could do but get
back into the comfortable yet harsh groove we had been in before she
asked me to be vice president.</p>
<p>The worst thing was she claimed she had a headache she needed to
take care of, and wouldn't drive me back home because of it. Maybe the
whole thing was a bad idea, and as I got on the bus to school Friday
morning, hoped that I could get some dialogue with Paris so I could
clear things up without revealing the underlying reasons behind the
whole situation.</p>
<p>Too bad the situation felt like a nagging mosquito bite. Her silent
treatment continued, even through a project we were assigned to do
together in life sciences. The pit of my stomach felt like a stone, and
I ended up throwing out my whole lunch salad because I couldn't even eat
it, afraid it would come right back up. After school didn't get much
better, as student government seemed to fit the mold of 'typical
meeting' and she disallowed any attempts for me to debate or bring up
issues. Francie continued delivering me dirty looks and hinting that her
little plan to offer Atkins substitutes in the ala-carte line despite
the harsh opposition of the school nurse and foodservice staff should
really pass without opposition. <i>Yeah, enjoy your lettuce-bunned
bacon cheeseburger Jarvis</i>, I thought silently to myself as I gave
her a bitchy look, <i>Can't wait to see until you become a fat cow
with arteries clogged like downtown Boston during rush hour!</i></p>
<p>Working on the <i>Franklin</i> that night seemed to feel like we
were closing the paper permanently, and Paris wouldn't even comment on
any corrections she had made to articles before I rewrote the stories
and posted them to the printing network. There was a dark pall and
everything about the situation was bothering me. So once all the other
staff and Ms. Peters had left for the night, leaving me and Paris alone,
I decided to try to get Paris to say anything to me.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about Wednesday," I told her, smiling. No response.</p>
<p>"Come on Gellar, where did those witty 200 WPM comebacks I'm used to
fly off to, you've been Marcel Marceau'ing it lately." She quirked an
eyebrow and groaned in response. Having a one-sided talk with her wasn't
exactly what I had in mind.</p>
<p>I reached over and tried to grab her hand in a reassuring manner.
"Look, whatever I said I take it back, it's nothing to be embarrassed
about--"</p>
<p>She reeled it back and got up from her seat violently, not looking
at me in the eyes. "I have to get notes from the conference room." She
then turned her back, and I gave chase as she walked out of the office
and across the hall to the conference room, I couldn't leave this thing
going all weekend.</p>
<p>I caught the door to the conference room, and noticed she had pushed
the lock on the door in. She must've really hated me because things just
seemed to tumble downhill from there. "Paris, please talk to me, I don't
understand why you'd act like such a question is--"</p>
<p>"It's not about the question at all Gilmore!" Fuck, she was back to
the last-name-as-a-slur thing from last year. "You don't ask that kind
of question in a locker room!"</p>
<p>"Well I was just curious about what you think and you seemed to have
fun--"</p>
<p>"Which you pushed me into involuntarily; you know how I feel about
gym class!"</p>
<p>"God forbid I get some exercise and try to help you!" I whined. "I
just wanted to know what you thought about yourself."</p>
<p>"You see the coat?!" she chastised, pointing at her jacket as she
moved towards me in a confrontational move. "I'm not Louise; I don't
crop my uniform so that I look like a raging whore! I don't give a shit
about 'body image' or Ophelia or any of this other bull the media tries
to shove down my throat to convince me that I'm homely and dull!"</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean you have to clam up on me when I ask, come on
Par! There's a feature about yourself you have to like!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, my brain. I'm here for one reason and one reason only Rory;
to learn and get into Harvard, nothing else." Her voice and treble
seemed to get louder as she moved closer to me. "When I walk these
halls, I could care less about the hot guy walking past me, and I've
been hoping that you've been doing that too. Wait, I forget, I'm
speaking to a girl who's been mind-fucking two men since she came here!"</p>
<p>She was getting more vicious by the moment and I felt powerless to
stop her ranting. "Don't you dare bring Dean or Jess into this, they
have nothing to do with--"</p>
<p>I felt my figure shrink as her eyes became darker in mine as she
went on. "You string Dean along even if you don't feel anything with
him, and played with Jess like he was a pawn while you were trying to
figure out whether to go for it with him or not. Meanwhile DuGrey was
just your lapdog while he was here, I bet you miss him and want to pitch
woo the moment you find out wherever the hell he is!"</p>
<p>Seriously, I wanted to slap that angry grin off her grille because
she was getting me so pissed off at her when I just wanted to say sorry.
But I took the bait anyway. "This coming from the girl with no sex life
to speak of!"</p>
<p>"Whatever, at least I'm happy without companionship!"</p>
<p>"I'm sure you are, God forbid anyone gets into that cold little rock
beneath your ribs you call a heart!"</p>
<p>"DO NOT TEST ME!" she cried towards me, her face flushed with blood.</p>
<p>"You know, I like you a lot Paris, I respect you, but I guess trying
to get to know you if it doesn't involve a textbook is almost next to
impossible, sorry I even try."</p>
<p>"It's a waste of energy Gilmore, besides I bet you need that energy
to get Dean to second base before revealing the ball behind your back
and tag him out, leaving him with a stiff dick between his legs as he
goes home unsatisfied, again!"</p>
<p>I felt my teeth grit with anger as she made that assumption, and
couldn't believe her gall. I wanted nothing more than to punch that
commander-in-chief in the teeth. I tried to breathe in and out, but
didn't feel any dissipation of my mood. I had to get her back.</p>
<p>"You know what's fun Gellar? That I even have a boy to lead around,
you bitter little bitch! All I wanted to know is if you like your body
the way it is and why the hell you hide it under so many layers, I'm
sure a guy would kill for you!"</p>
<p>"I don't want a guy to kill for me, and like I said before. I.
Don't. Care!" We were so close that in another situation it would've
been a turn-on sexually. All I wanted to do then however was one-up her.</p>
<p>"I care!"</p>
<p>"Fuck off Gilmore, your compliments do little for me!"</p>
<p>"Well it's no matter Tristan never gave you more than a kiss, with
an attitude like that I certainly wouldn't fuck you!" I shot back, and
almost immediately wanted to take that insult back. She looked at me
coolly, and made me feel really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Take that back, right now!" she commanded to me, and for some
reason or another I didn't back down.</p>
<p>"I won't, because it's true. You just don't want some guy to sweep
you off your feet and tip you off that high little pedestal you put
yourself on. You're just too chicken to admit that you could be a lust
object, and you're becoming just like your mother."</p>
<p>She pointed a finger towards me and her monotone became even deeper.
"Don't go there--"</p>
<p>"Get a clue Par, she makes you ashamed to be yourself, and it's
turning you into this sour little hag who, at this rate, might have to
settle for some 'nice Jewish guy' on the Upper East Side with a small--"
I didn't get the last word out as she finally got me to allegorically
cry out 'Uncle' in such a way it almost broke my heart.</p>
<p>"I might be a prude," she started, "But at least I don't have a
chastity electric fence around my person preventing my fucking boyfriend
from doing any more than heavy petting--"</p>
<p>Then she tacked on the hated 'Mary' nickname at the end of her
sentence, adding on 'Stone' to hammer home that I was nothing but a 60's
sitcom girl who played with boys like building blocks. I lost it right
there, and felt my jaw drop as the argument had its exclamation point
tacked on to the end. I was too shocked to respond, and almost felt
like crying as I left the room in a huff, made a beeline for my locker
to retrieve my things and got out to the bus before Paris could catch
me. I heard her apologies echoing in the hall, but ignored them. She
brought up my most sensitive subject she could and smashed hari-kari
through those boundaries I set aside. Not only that, it hurt for
someone I thought I could love so deep to say such hateful things about
me.</p>
<p>But it was true. I didn't truly love Dean anymore, yet kept him
along. I felt too distraught to think of anything else except the
argument as I watched the headlights of Friday rush hour pass by in the
northbound lanes, and I looked out of the bus window in despair. My
phone rang in my backpack, but I didn't even bother to take it out. A
couple minutes later I heard the chirp of my voicemail, and pretty much
assumed it was Paris begging for mercy.</p>
<p>Maybe it had been my fault. I was bringing her out of the shell too
fast and perhaps being a little too forward. But I didn't expect to be
perfect when I pursued the pro and con list since it was my first time
playing the seductress. I needed to regain control and her trust, and
hoped that putting space between us to calm down would put us back on an
even keel.</p>
<p>Once I got back home, I had to vent to Lorelai my frustration about
Paris (leaving out all the girl-crush details, along with plenty of
edited language) as we both got ready for Friday night dinner at
Grandma's. I don't remember what I said, but it must've been a long
tirade because I was still going strong about her as we got in the Jeep,
and only stopped once we were midway between the Hollow and Hartford, I
went on about almost the whole summer and most of the new school year.
I didn't let Mom know about the field hockey stuff, but even with that
as we pulled of the I-84 exit towards the mansion, she seemed to figure
out something I hadn't been noticing as she glanced in my direction.</p>
<p>"Whoa, calm down there kiddo," Mom told me as she put a hand on my
knee, "The way you're talking about Paris I swear you're acting the same
way you did before you and Dean got together, ranting on and on without
an end because you like her more than you let on. Just breathe hon, she
isn't here and the only evil forces in your sights tonight are Emily
and Richard trying to steer you towards Yale."</p>
<p>I swear when she told me that, I immediately turned white. Not at
the whole college situation of course, but that she saw through my anger
and towards my arousal unwittingly. I have my mother to thank for the
rest of the night, because instead of stewing in my anger over being
called Mary Stone, my body woke up to the fact that the whole argument
had left me aroused and wet since it began.</p>
<p>There I sat during Friday night dinner, a time I usually enjoy
because my mother's quippy nature becomes mixed with the older, yet
refined humor of my grandparents and things always get interesting
between the two generations, and all I was thinking to myself was, <i>I'd
rather be upstairs in that NSYNC'ophied bedroom scratching that damned
itch Paris irritated</i>. I sat in my seat, legs tightly crossed and
reanalyzing the entire argument and Wednesday's third period over and
over in my mind, trying to find out where exactly pleasure had been
triggered in Paris' responses because I sure wasn't noticing before Mom
noticed my rant-track. I ate that evening slowly and deliberately, and
tried to time my responses to any queries Grandpa and Grandma sent my
way so that in the end my answer was satisfactory, they wouldn't ask a
follow-up and I was free to go back to thinking about Paris.</p>
<p>Several times that night I wanted to ask if I could either use the
bathroom, or take a nap upstairs before I left, but I held my tongue
since that would have caused Lorelai to become ever more paranoid about
the intentions of her parents. That, and the thought of masturbating
with all those frilly covers below wasn't exactly conducive to any
fantasies I've had of my classmate.</p>
<p>So I waited until I came home, and after watching some late-late
movie on channel 20, went to bed after wishing my mom a good night. By
then however, the only thing I was feeling was tired, the turn-on from
anger seemed to be fading, but I really wanted to get that tension out
before I began my next beg-a-thon for Paris' forgiveness Monday in
school. Thinking about that, I felt like crying, but I had to focus on
the positives of the situation. I could do this with a heavy heart, or
try to keep the flame strong. I silently read my pro-con list to myself
(at the time it was a 28 pro-3 con tally), and got my cell phone out so
I could listen to Paris' messages. I turned on the phone and noticed
that not only did she leave about four voice messages, but a couple of
text messages later after the voice mails.</p>
<p>The voice mails were as devastating as I expected, her voice
strained and subdued as I heard in the background soft classical music.
The last one, left around nine seemed the most apologetic. "I know in
the past Rory, I've told you that I hate you, especially after Tristan
revealed our date was set up." Her composure seemed artificial as she
went on, she was definitely on the verge of tears. "I do sort of hate
you, but not for any negative reason. It's just that sometimes I feel
like you're way too lucky in your life, and I envy that about you. Your
mother speaks in your primary language and is your best friend as you
say, and there's just this part of me that wishes I could go up to my
mother and she'd act like Lorelai. But I know that's never going to
happen, and though I know you didn't mean it, she is a bitter hag."</p>
<p>That's when she started crying, full on. I've never heard her voice
so desperate and sad, and it just broke my heart to hear her. "If I ever
get like Sharon, I want to know so I can back off that track, because
today, there was no doubt I was carbon-copying when she fought with
Daddy and accused him of some affair that was impossible with his
schedule and everything else. Anyways, please, I beg of you to call me
back Gilmore, today we went too far with our fighting. I'm so sorry, and
I'll get off the phone before I crumble apart here. Goodbye." Paris
then hung up, and I read her short text messages, asking me if I was
back home yet.</p>
<p>I knew there was one thing I shouldn't do, so I decided just to go
to bed and not think about Paris sexually that night since it wouldn't
do any good to fantasize about her when our friendship was fractured.
Instead, I went to sleep thinking about all I could do in order to patch
things up with her. I knew she'd be sorry, but I was scared that the
next time we'd find something to argue about we'd actually come to
blows. The simple fact was, there was an untamed lover beneath Paris'
fa&ccedil;ade, but that self was heavily guarded by so many conflicting
emotions, problems, and guilt for not going with her mother's planning
that she couldn't help but keep herself sealed off. That part of her was
so much in her blood that the formerly carefree seven year-old she was,
who ran around the playground not worrying about her image or how she
came off to the trustees of Harvard or Hartfordian society was trapped
beneath her iron bitch self.</p>
<p>Really, that's the first time I really truly knew how my mother
felt, and the reason she had to run away with me after my first
birthday. Mrs. Gellar had definitely done so many things to screw with
Paris' mind up to and including making everyone who didn't support 'The
Plan' miserable. I remembered Paris' housekeeper almost dragging her out
by the ear the night of the initiation. <i>Definitely hired by Mrs.
Gellar</i>, I thought, remembering the times she spoke in animated and
happy Portuguese to 'Nanny' on her cell phone. I never understood what
they were really saying, but her attitude was so much different than it
was whenever Mrs. Gellar had come to school to 'check up' on her
daughter. There was also the clear sign that whenever Paris and I were
paired up for a project, we'd only go to the Manor if Mrs. Gellar was
at one of her club meetings or on a business trip. That woman just
makes me so angry that she can have this bright girl she foaled, but
could ignore all the positives in her life and hammer home the negatives
so hard, Paris can't help but have a bitter front surrounding her.</p>
<p>That night, I didn't have a passionate, sweaty, and
porn-without-plot dream with Paris, but instead I just thought of her
and us, sitting at a table at Luke's talking for hours on end about
anything and everything we could come up with, a true wild card night
over a plate of chili cheese fries and endless coffees debating
endlessly without interference from the guys or our mothers. When I woke
up from it in the morning, I recalled all the good times we've had, the
study sessions and the constant quizzing that never stumbled or ended
awkwardly. There was nothing more that I wanted to do but resettle
things down with her.</p>
<p>But I had remembered the many times I had made peace with Paris,
only to see it break and it was on my shoulders to make peace once
again. There was a big part of me that wanted to drive out to the Manor
and patch up things. However, this time I felt it was Paris who had to
come to me since I did still hold some anger over the way she went off
about my treatment of Dean and Jess.</p>
<p>So I decided to wait for her to get off the phone and make her
amends in person. I did my usual Saturday things, homework, studying,
working at the Inn for a few hours, hoping the next person to walk into
the front foyer would be a 5'3" blonde hellfire with deep, dark brown
eyes. She didn't come by though, and though Lorelai noticed how anxious
I was, I avoided her queries and blamed my worry on homework and the
whole situation. We had a late night with a taped copy of the MST3K
version of <i>Space Mutiny</i>, and I went to bed at two thinking that
the Paris stalemate would continue to fester for the next few months,
continuing in that three months friends/three months enemies cycle we
seemed to always be on.</p>
<p>I was asleep and not dreaming, when suddenly I heard this strange
rapping on the pane of my window. "What the--" I mumbled as I struggled
to look at the green numbers of my alarm clock on the nightstand. It
read 4:34 and it took me a bit to remember the little dot in the corner
meant AM rather than PM. I sighed in relief that I hadn't slept fourteen
hours accidentally, but was kind of scared about who was trying to get
in the house.</p>
<p>I grabbed the closest thing I had to a weapon nearby, Colonel
Clucker (Yeah, I'll beat that burglar into a coma with a stuffed
chicken. Stars Hollow isn't exactly known for a high crime rate, OK?),
and slowly crept towards my window. I mumbled a tired hello and awaited
a response as I wiped the sleep out of my eyes.</p>
<p>"Rory?" the voice asked, and I could immediately recognize its
owner. I clutched the string of my window shade and pulled it up to
confirm who it was.</p>
<p>Paris had driven all the way out to my town on an early Sunday
morning on a crazy whim, and I could tell this wasn't well planned the
way she usually did before we talked. Her hair was barely done, and her
choice of a Harvard sweatshirt with dark sweatpants was an ensemble so
unlike her. But what really hurt as I turned on a bedside light and
opened up the window was seeing her face.</p>
<p>Her usually spare makeup was gone, and in its place was a face full
of worry lines, a frown, and eyes that were so forlorn and tired I was
shocked that she could make a forty minute drive to my house, she was in
a distraught condition that I never would associate her with.</p>
<p>At first I felt bad about what we had done each other to create a
rift in our friendship. Then my mind reminded me that she had called me
a teasing prude who could care less about sex. Upon that thought, I
opened the window and asked why she was there when she had made the
assertion I never thought about sex, being extra harsh about my
response.</p>
<p>Instead of a heated argument ensuing like I had expected, Paris just
asked meekly if I could let her in so she could tell her side of the
story. The way she asked me, with a hoarse and sleepy voice, I couldn't
deny her. So even though I was apprehensive, I let her in my room and
listened to her carefully.</p>
<p>I was expecting her to stall somewhat, but she went right into
answering my question from Wednesday, in more detail than I could've
hoped for in the shower.</p>
<p>Thank God, because she only confirmed what I had expected; her
mother controlled her body image. I didn't know what to say as Paris
explained sitting at the desk that she had so many problems being proud
of herself because her mother made her feel ashamed of her figure. When
she said that she was forced to consider reduction surgery on her
mother's behest though, I didn't know what to say. <i>No wonder she
stays hidden</i>, I thought to myself as she relayed to me that no
doctor around here would do the surgery as long as she was 17, <i>her
mother's too obsessed with her schooling to even consider her wants</i>.</p>
<p>As Paris went on, there was so much seizing up in me that wanted to
drag her over to my bed and prove to her that her body was perfect in my
eyes. I continued listening to her relay her mother's insane plans for
keeping her the dullest and least interesting girl ever, and couldn't
understand Mrs. Gellar's motives at all. Why would she want Paris to be
almost like a robot?</p>
<p>Then I found out how her mother plans dates, by IQ and how good the
boy's genes were. No wonder she kept her heart locked away; she was a
hopeless romantic who was unlucky to have a mother who seemed to think
courtship was like those Valentine's love surveys the student government
used to hand out a few days before the 14th (and was one of the first
things Paris and I outlawed, how can numbers and computers create the
perfect match? With them in the mix, girls attracted to girls aren't
even in the equation!). My anger over her remarks had faded completely,
and I invited her to lay with me on my bed as I explained my side of
things.</p>
<p>"Par," I started, the words coming slowly, "you were just getting to
me in the worst way possible and there was just a lot of baiting going
on in that room, there's no justifying calling you a bitter bitch, just
as I don't think you could explain why I could be called a tease. I pull
away from Dean because he has to get the picture that I'm far from ready
from doing that with him."</p>
<p>"I understand that, completely, and I certainly don't frown on you
staying a virgin." She lay down and started making amends with me. "You
have my word from this moment on that I won't be making any more cracks
about our sexual statuses, and I'm sorry I even asserted you were on the
level of Louise. Not that's she's a bad girl, she's been my friend
since kindergarten."</p>
<p>"Hey, she isn't bad, just goes about things a different way than us
two, and at least she does things in a safe way."</p>
<p>"Thank me for that Gilmore; I just about drilled an entire sex-ed
curriculum into her blonde little head before her first time."</p>
<p>We both laughed and got off that whole messy subject of Friday
night, and she went on and on about her relationships with Harold, her
father, and her nanny. She explained that though Mr. Gellar wasn't
always there, he was a true father in her eyes and she wasn't ashamed of
him, and how Francisca had just about raised her up to her teenage
years. Of course lots of details were left out about her mother, and I
could tell she was trying to swerve around the topic as much as she
could.</p>
<p>So I made her an offer that if she had anything she needed to talk
about or find a second opinion, especially about her mother, she could
come to me, no questions asked. I wouldn't judge her, nor would I make
fun of her.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" she asked me with some reservations. "What if it's a
topic that would make you squeamish, like my love life? Sure, you aren't
exactly Caroline Hax, but you know Louise, she's a little extreme, and
Madeline, anything more taxing on her brain than fellatio and she needs
a picture book--"</p>
<p>I cut her off kindly before some icky mental pictures of Madeline
were planted in my brain and took her left hand into my right, rubbing
around her knuckles so I could calm her down. "Par, honestly I've
already given you more dating help than those two, so what's a little
sex talk between friends." I laughed and we turned to face each other.
"I don't exactly know how to do much, but in some weird odd little way,
you're the closest thing I've had to a kindred spirit since I came to
Chilton. We fight and debate endlessly, but at the end of the day we're
still two smart young women both vying for the big H and the
valedictorian's slot, and probably bound to each other for life in some
karmic plan."</p>
<p>"True," she mumbled, and I noticed her grip on my hand become a
little tighter, "Fine, I'll come to you for help, but don't expect me to
give you advice about Dean, I'm kind of inexperienced."</p>
<p><i>I think you have nothing to fear</i>, I thought to myself as I
acknowledged her and smiled back. From there we forgot all about
everything and fell into one of those deep, thoughtful conversations
that pop up at the oddest times. Paris and I talked about anything
besides the way we think our bodies and families were, including some
things about the newspaper and Francie. I had gotten just a little more
dirt on the Puffs leader since I became her 'lackey', but nothing yet
that would prove beyond a doubt that she was using me for a puppet. I
kept silent on that front, but couldn't wait until I had so much taped
and written evidence she would be a goner. I'm sure Paris would be mad
at first for going behind her back, but she'd commend me later for my
resourcefulness.</p>
<p>By the time six had rolled around, I was starting to feel really
sleepy, but also very comfortable. My bed was feeling awfully tight
since Paris' body took up the right side of the mattress, but I didn't
want her to go. She yawned kind of softly, and seemed so drowsy that I
couldn't see her going back to Hartford when she was already sinking
into my pillows.</p>
<p>Paris tried to lift herself out of the bed and see herself off, but
I kept my hand clasped in hers, and held her back with my open arm.</p>
<p>"You're too tired to get back on the road, stay here." I gave her a
pleading look, but she was still unsure.</p>
<p>"Sharon might not be happy to let me stay, and really I just came to
apologize, you need sleep, right?"</p>
<p>"I don't mind Par; you're not a bad bed partner." I laughed.
"Besides, does your mother <b>really</b> care at all?"</p>
<p>I won her with the emphasis on that word, and she kicked off her
shoes and brought the covers on her side of the bed over her frame. "I
guess you're right, I'll stay."</p>
<p>"Great," I said, and shortly after wishing each other good night
despite the sun rising over the horizon, we fell asleep. Not in each
other's arms mind you, but close enough that her body heat lulled me
into a deep slumber I didn't think would've been possible without her
sharing my bed. We brushed against each other a few times, but my senses
were cooled and after all that talking my only focus was on recharging
my mind.</p>
<p>I didn't have the good sense to set my alarm for my regular 9:30 am
wakeup time so that I could get up and work at the Inn however, and
forgot all about Lorelai in the rush to set things straight with Paris.
Mom knocked on my door around ten, and was surprised to see that there
was someone else sleeping next to me.</p>
<p>"Rory, it's time to--" she flicked on the light, and saw the back of
Paris' head, misjudging its owner at first. "Dean, what are you doing in
my daughter's bed?"</p>
<p>I rubbed the sleep out of my eye and for a moment thinking that it
was indeed Dean in my bed, shook her awake vigorously.</p>
<p>The long blonde hair I felt against her shoulder however gave me
much-needed relief that everything about last night wasn't a dream, and
I had made up with the girl I had such heavy feelings for her. "Mom," I
mumbled, "that isn't Dean, it's Paris."</p>
<p>As I roused her awake she was mumbling something about a guy named
Milt and his radio show, and when she came to, she was surprised by the
fact she was in my bed and in my room.</p>
<p>Mom wanted to know everything that lead Paris to sneak into our
house, so I told her about yesterday and how we were both feeling
depressed that we tore ourselves apart, though instead of 'the flat
question' I made up something about editorial differences with a <i>Franklin</i>
story, and Paris was only too happy to go along with the cover. That
seemed to appease Lorelai, and Paris got up from her side, straightening
her hair crudely by running her fingers through it.</p>
<p>Perfect timing of course, for Lorelai to resume acting like the
sixteen year-old girl she always would be in spirit.</p>
<p>"So, you wanted to seduce my daughter by sleeping with her you
harlot? I must say you're doing quite a good job," she joked, making
Paris' eyes bug out, my eyes roll and both of us take on that familiar
shade of red that's becoming familiar between us on our faces.</p>
<p>"Mother!" I cried in an Emily-ish tone, and she laughed at my
reaction.</p>
<p>"What, I'm just saying that you have excellent taste in women my
darling daughter." Paris laughed at my misery along with Mom, but I
guess when you get into a situation like that, you're asking for it.</p>
<p>I got up and secretly held out a glimmer of hope that Paris might
decide to have a day of fun with Mom and I, even if it involved some
work at the Inn. However looking at her in full daylight...yeah, her
shirt and sweatpants certainly didn't scream out 'outing ensemble' at
all. So after a quick breakfast she said her goodbyes and I watched her
drive off, I got back into my regular Sunday routine, quite pleased that
Paris and I had patched things up, maybe even permanently.</p>
<p>This week, I've started to become a little bolder, and losing the
excuse of trying to find things to put on the pro/con list. Madeline and
Louise were off to troll around for guys lucky enough to be dates for
their Halloween shindig and Paris' side of the table seemed a little
lonely, so I've taken to sitting next to her at lunch. I sit a little
closer than Louise has and can proudly note that Paris doesn't think
I've invaded her space at all, and I've been able to brush against her
arm a few times as we ate.</p>
<p>I am feeling kind of depressed though. My dad decided to invite me
up to Boston for Halloween, and with Sherrie being much more demanding
as her pregnancy progresses ("What do you mean I have to take a lighter
caseload Chris, I can handle six clients in one day!" she whines, and I
so want to tell her gory details of what wrath I wrought gestating
inside of Lorelai starting in February 1984), it's up to me to keep them
both sane as they drag me off to some lame gathering where there are
sure to be few girls I relate to, and I can't turn down my dad no
matter how ridiculous the request. I know Paris really doesn't celebrate
the holiday and it would've been fun showing her how October 31st in
the Hollow was, but I better show some respect to Sherrie seeing as
I'll have a sister from her soon.</p>
<p>Also, it hurts that she ruined a perfect costume match-up with Paris
being Roxie, and me playing the role of Velma. That dream kept me wet
the night after Mads suggested it in jest. Paris could pull off Roxie,
she was a top ballerina when she was younger and before she...filled out
and became so voluptuous.</p>
<p>A couple things make me feel better though. For one, that she's
starting to become a little more cautious and unhinged around me. The
other thing is Monday morning I met Paris at her locker, and was pleased
beyond belief that the little pep talk I gave her in my bed convinced
her to ditch the uniform jacket permanently and go with the blue
Chilton sweater instead. It looks so much nicer and flattering on her
curves, and makes her in class and extra-curricular activities so much
more approachable to others. I steal a glance occasionally in her
direction, and my mouth almost waters at being able to look at her in
such a way.</p>
<p>I lick my lips as I remember she almost swerved off the road on the
way back home Tuesday night because I was reaching over to retrieve a
book from my backpack sitting on the driver's side of the backseat, and
my hand brushed up against the top of her shoulder. I don't know if I'll
be doing that again though, Paris usually pushes 75 on the Wilbur Cross
and is a very aggressive driver, managing to swerve in and out of
traffic, even during the heavy jams we occasionally run into on route
84.</p>
<p>Though I have to admit, the way she drives? Also a big
turn-on...ahem, I should say pro. Yeah, I keep trying to convince myself
that I should up and give up, renaming the list 'turn-offs and
turn-ons', but if someone happens to glance and see Pro and Con on top
instead they'll be less likely to read it if it does get in the wrong
hands.</p>
<p>Speaking of hands, I think I'm going to run mine through Paris' hair
right about now. She looks like she wants to bite Mr. Mercurio's head
off, and I don't blame her because once again, this class is boring! Her
shoulders are all hunched up and from behind, it looks like she has
this imaginary weight stressing her upper body. I remember what happened
when I calmed her down before the date with Jamie and hope that this
works too. Thank goodness the boy in back of me is too much of a
Russian geek to care about what I'd do with the girl in front of me,
he's freakishly into bad Russian fic and keeps raising his hand and
butting in with these facts that no one gives a damn about, it's like
going to class with a Trekkie!</p>
<p>Wait, that would be an insult to Luke, oops. How about <i>Battlestar
Galactica</i>? Yeah, few fans supporting that fandom, I feel better
now.</p>
<p>At first, I comb through her hair with my fingers, then when I
notice no one's attention drawn towards me, I part the middle so I can
rub right near the back of her neck, noticing the thin gold chain that
her Tiffany & Co. Star of David necklace consists of. I've never
seen it up close (she usually keeps it concealed beneath her shirt
because of her conservative dress), but she told me that Sunday morning
it was a gift from her father for her bat mitzvah, and that it had a
beautiful brilliant blue topaz stone in the middle pentagon that denoted
her birth month of December, and said it was in the same blue shade of
my eyes. When she told me that I thought I heard her voice try to
flirt, honestly. Hearing her repeat that in my mind sends shudders up
my spine as I play with the chain and a couple of my fingers rub
against the sensitive skin beneath her hairline.</p>
<p>She starts to ease up a little and relaxes her shoulders as I go
along, and then I feel a piece of paper jab against my knee. She passes
me a note, and I wonder what it says. I sneak it slowly against my body
until it's high enough to hide behind my <i>War and Peace</i> copy, and
I open it up.</p>
<p>Paris isn't blunt about her disappointment with this class, and when
she compares it with having oral sex with Boris Yeltsin you can't help
but laugh. In her own little way she makes it clear she hates the class
but loves my 'stress relief', so I'm very pleased.</p>
<p>I hear her unsnap the end of her pencil, which means she wants me to
respond. I scribble down a joke about getting drunk on that Russian
favorite, vodka, and on a whim I decide to include a little flirtatious
overture in the postscript. Surely she's getting my hints as I make them
more obvious, and as I pass the note back wrapped around a sharpened
pencil, I make sure that I brush her fingertips and linger the touch
longer than needed, very obvious to just her.</p>
<p>I can't see her reaction to the 'pleasure' I added on towards the
end, but I can feel it. Her pulse is apparent, and I can feel it race oh
so slightly, along with a sharp intake of breath that's unnoticed to
anyone else but me. Seems like everything is slowly going according to
the plan I'm making up as I go along.</p>
<p>"Miss Gellar, can you read from page 337 all the way to page 353 for
the class please, you seem engrossed in this story so much."</p>
<p>Damn it Mr. Mercurio, why did you have to call on Paris, she's all
tensed up again and I have to back off my little mini-massage! Everyone
looks towards her, and I pull my hand back so I'm just touching her hair
as she starts reading in a voice that suggests she'd much rather be
reading something of substance, say a Hot Topic catalog. I frown on the
outside, but turn to the back of my notebook and write <i>she loves a
good back rub</i> under the ever-growing pro column.</p>
<p>I'm still nervous what everyone's reaction to my news would be, and
still a little bit unsure of exposing my crush on Paris to her. But it
seems that with her candid answer about her breasts when she apologized
and the shedding of the jacket, I might have more than a kindred spirit,
as I told her on Sunday, she might really be my soulmate and feel the
exact same way I do. She is letting me touch her in class without trying
to shrug it off, isn't she? That's a good sign.</p>
<p>She's reading, and right now I'm curling a couple of strands of her
hair around my index finger, retaining just enough of the words she's
saying that I'll get out of here unscathed and my love of books won't be
warped from reading this crap. I should be soaking it up like a sponge,
but instead I'm sitting in this hard wooden desk chair trying to keep
the fragrance of her hair out of my mind, and keeping my fingers
relatively in control so they don't end up south of her neck. There's
so much spinning around in my mind, and the only thing that makes sense
is that she's a wonderful person to sleep in the same bed with, our
fights pump so much blood around my body where it shouldn't be, and
doing more things with Dean to try to dampen these feelings I have for
her has lost its intended effect, since I'm now imagining her lips on
mine instead of Dean's.</p>
<p>I know one thing though; I'll break up with Dean before I do
anything with Paris, because I'm certainly not keen on cheating on him,
I'm sure she wouldn't take well to being a side project as Dean and I
stayed together.</p>
<p>Although there's never been anything said about fantasizing about a
girl while you're still with the boy, so I'll try to keep those thoughts
on a speedy boil. Hmm, there was that one I had last night where we were
at the point of the Mary Stone crack again, I wonder what I could do
with that if instead of stomping out, I shoved her on that big and
spacious conference room table and let her know that the 'chastity
electric fence' system I wore failed on girls, when it came to her I
wanted to do much more than heavy petting, and that I lied about not
wanting to fuck her back to fifth period that Friday?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can work with that, and best of all as long as I keep my
eyes on the book and occasionally change the page, Mr. Mercurio won't
notice a thing. That's the great thing about having a very high IQ and a
fast WPM figure (and lusting for the same); you already know how to get
yourself off without arousing the attention of anyone, not even the
girl in front of you. I better get started then; Paris is down to
fourteen pages and she reads a page every twenty-five seconds, not a lot
of time to get the friction going down there...</p>
