<chapter title="Chapter 6: Endings, Beginnings, and New Legends">
<p>There seem to be milestones to your life that you always go back to in
the chaos that is your photographic memory bank, and though you don't
remember most of the surrounding details, say the weather, day of the
week, type of dress and what may have been spoken before that moment
took root, more often than not, you can easily imagine what the actual
event is, and maybe even an extraneous item that helps you recall when
the event might have happened. </p>
<p>For example, my first day of school when I was five. My mother had
been a big fan of <i>Twin Peaks</i> as mocking material, so she taped
all the episodes off channel 8 and we had a marathon of it the night
before I walked in the doors of Stars Hollow Elementary to begin my
academic career. I couldn't even tell you what the heck the show was
about then, nor can I tell you today because I was too buried in <i>Ramona
Quimby, Age Eight</i> to really pay attention. But I can still tell you
I know my first day of kindergarten I had strange visions of this Laura
Palmer lady and her mystery. Knowing that instead of that boys are gross
and/or cute probably set my wallflower path in stone instead of being a
social being. </p>
<p>Then there's my first kiss with Dean, that's what we'll go into
detail about. I almost didn't to Chilton because of him, and for that
I'm still kind of bitter about, since without Grandma and my mother
yelling back and forth about supporting my education, I may have pulled
out, simply because of a boy. That's another tale for another day
though. All I know is I can't even remember the details before it all
except for an argument about regional cola terms, and that he asked me
to pick the hand out with the soda. I was nervous as I chose, and then
when Dean bent down and kissed me sweetly, I found out that it was all a
ruse for him to finally express his feelings for me. I ran out of the
store at eighty miles an hour immediately after with a stolen box of
cornstarch in tow, and couldn't believe the sparks I had felt. I was
shocked that my body has responded to his kiss, and in such an odd way. </p>
<p>For Dean, I've always remembered the large, grandiose gestures he
made for my love. I recalled the bracelet, the perfect 1/4 year
anniversary dinner, the car, and the heavy makeout sessions. I'll
remember always with reverence those things he did. </p>
<p>What I won't remember happily however is that he always treated me
like a china doll. </p>
<p>I guess the fact I'm the product of a teenage mother, and my own
innocent looks played into the stereotype that I was the living
equivalent of a china doll to Dean, meant to be browsed, examined and
looked at with his eyes, but never to be touched. There were so many
times I tried to give him signals that I wanted more than a replica of a
relationship in the 1880s Victorian period, but he was too much of a
wuss to take the bait. </p>
<p>The night I dressed up like Donna Reed, for example. Beneath that
damned cursed TV mother skirt I wore the thinnest underwear I could
find, and decided to go with a strapless bra, hoping for God's sake my
brainstorm wouldn't only prove that women should be equal to men, but
that I wanted to use that rare opportunity of being alone to have him
initiate more than chaste French kissing from me. He never took the
bait, and I left that night still in like (note the absence of love,
we'll get to that in a bit) with him, but with a huge sexual knot inside
of me yearning to be released. Dean then ruined the opportunity
presented during our 1/4 year anniversary with his demand I tell him
that I loved him in that wreck of a car he was building, and it took
even after we reconciled on the last day of Chilton for my sexual
feelings to become renewed again. </p>
<p>Strangely, even after Paris had put a stop to our friendship with
that ticket mess, I wondered if she was watching as we made out in the
front drive. </p>
<p>I seriously thought that the second chance for Dean would lead to a
renewed and arousing love, but by July of that year with my charity
obligations for Harvard, he had renewed his bellyaching again that I
wasn't there enough for his liking, and backed off from touching me in
any way that might cause a minor arousal in my system. He was always so
boring, pedestrian, and as he got even more into the car building with
Todd and his buddies, I could sense all those damned fumes he dealt with
in building it eating away at his IQ. </p>
<p>Instead of talking about books, he'd talk in Detroitese about how he
needed a converter or SAE wrench head or some other kind of crap that I
had absolutely no interest in at all, and also talked ad nauseum about
that stupid robot boxing show he thought was the height of Western
culture. The only thing I thought when I voluntarily watched an episode
was the robot controllers were definitely using their machines to
overcompensate for a certain reproductive part of their anatomy that had
to be smaller than average. </p>
<p>Thank the Lord Jess came in just in time and I started realizing I
was thinking of Paris as more of a rival around last November, because
if he hadn't come in and I kept thinking of Paris as just a friend, I
seriously think Dean would've gagged my intelligence, he's that dull!
Did I forget to mention that Clara, his sister, is the only child I've
ever wanted to give a nice, hard slap to because of her annoying,
prattling attitude and diamond-cutting voice? I'm nothing but glad to be
rid of any member of the Forrester family in my life. </p>
<p>That's right; I'm now a single woman, at least for now. But
hopefully in about an hour, I'll be starting to make progress with Paris
. For now though I'm sitting in my bedroom at five on a very early
Saturday morning, bleary-eyed as I try to look for the right things to
go along with the look I'm trying to perfect. </p>
<p>Why did I just say Dean is a footnote in history? Probably best to
turn back time to Tuesday morning so I can explain everything up to this
point, to when I was watering Dwight's garden. </p>
<p>When that bachelor left me in charge of his plants and everything, I
had expected things to be easy. Of course Lorelai pawned everything off
on me since she had Inn work in the mornings, so for the next few days I
went over to his house after my stop at Luke's, watered his plants and
made sure everything was in order, then left on the 6:50 bus on the loop
around Hartford. It was a routine that was going to be easy to fall
into, at least I thought at the beginning. </p>
<p>However, I failed to account for a few things as I woke up on
Tuesday morning around 5:45 . I got out of bed and made sure that
everything was in order for my Chilton uniform, and took a shower before
my mom, keeping my mind from wandering to the fact that in my sleep I
had an interesting dream about the girl I had my eye on, and also about
how I would go about breaking up with Dean beforehand. I was still
undecided about cutting him off so abruptly, and my conscious was
telling me to wait for an opening, which in our snooze of a relationship
might take months. </p>
<p>I got out of the shower and prepared to put on my lingerie, when I
found that there was absolutely nothing in my bra drawer, and Lorelai
was nowhere to be found. I still found a pair of panties buried in the
bottom of my shirt drawer, but nothing to support my breasts. Throwing
on my robe, I ran out of my room, and found a note on a plate with a
couple of pop tarts on it telling me the whereabouts of my brassiere
collection.</p>

<blockquote class="page">
  <p>Kiddo,</p>
  <p>Decided to do all of our laundry together at work today before I
went to Nashville tomorrow, so combined it in one pile before I left for
the Inn while you were showering, you'll get it all back tonight. Have
a great day at school :)! </p>
  <p class="sig">Mom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I forgot to set aside at least one before bed to shove in my blouse's
breast pocket like I usually did, and I hit my head on the wall for my
stupidity! How could I forget that Mom was going out to Tennessee for a
hotelier's convention until Sunday and decided to give me as little to
do as possible while I was home alone? I blame the long two-hour
conversation I had Monday night with Paris about the tests we would be
taking on Tuesday, along with some brainstorms about the special <i>Franklin</i>
edition we were printing later in the day about the football team's run
to state. Lorelai had shouted something about laundry, and I probably
yelled back 'yeah, go ahead' so fast I didn't realize the topic my mom
was bringing up because I was too busy swooning to the sounds of Paris '
voice. </p>
<p>I cursed God out, and quickly figured that if I just kept on my
normal tank of an undershirt beneath the blouse and sweater, no one
would notice that I was as free as a hippy beneath it all, thank
goodness for my B cup that wouldn't be too noticeable beneath all those
uniform layers. So I put on my clothes, ignoring that lovesick little
voice in the back of my head that told me Paris might be taking more
interest in my chest that day than usual. <i>Come on, nothing can get
any worse today, can it?</i> My mind thought as I finished dressing,
organized my backpack, did my hair and prepared for the day ahead. </p>
<p>You all know that after you say or think that, you're cursed, right? </p>
<p>Seems in the panic about my bra, I forgot to realize that the
sprinkler timer at Dwight's was timed to water his annuals every Tuesday
and Saturday at 6:45. I went into the house to get the watering can,
and within moments of coming out of his home, I found myself in a
nightmare that made my day even worse. </p>
<p>The sprinklers came up from the ground, and on full blast, the water
came from all directions, basically covering the entire property with no
little dry space along the front walk for me to escape their wrath.
Since the timer was set to water for ten minutes, and he had locked the
back door in the kitchen with a deadbolt lock he failed to leave me the
key for, I was stuck in a very wet pickle. </p>
<p>I found the manual shut-off and tried to turn it closed, but it
seemed to slip in my wet hands and I couldn't get a very good grip on it
since it required a wrench rod I wasn't able to locate. Trying to save
my academic day and thankful I decided to get a watertight bag two
years ago, I threw my backpack past the picket fence and onto the
sidewalk in order to keep my books dry, I wasn't ready to owe Chilton
$600 for wet texts! It landed with a thud against the street's curb, but
everything stayed in. My work was safe. </p>
<p>My own self, however, was getting totally soaked. I wasn't about to
bring out my cell phone to call Dean lest it be destroyed by the soaking
water, and the fact he'd be whining and making jokes about my stupidity
for the next eight days because I couldn't turn a simple fucking
sprinkler off! So I continued to struggle with it, my socks becoming
soaked and my sweater swiftly becoming a glorified sponge from all the
water being soaked in. I could feel the liquid seethe into the blue
blouse above, and into the only other layer, my undershirt. Since it was
cold water being sprayed all over, I started shivering in seconds. I
cursed at Dwight for having such a screwed-up watering schedule, and I
wasn't willing to go further in his front yard since the sprinklers in
the front were on a higher jet setting than the ones towards the back,
which would cause me to become even wetter. </p>
<p>Jess happened to walk by then on his way to walk Shane from her
house to school, and with him being a guy who could probably remedy the
situation, I yelled for help. As he made some snide crack about me being
perfect for the cast of <i>Blue Crush</i>, I told him I needed him to
turn them off, and now. </p>
<p>"Why didn't you call the bag boy?" he asked snidely as he found the
control rod to turn shut the spigot hidden in a crack along Dwight's
front walkway. </p>
<p>"I don't want to bother him, I thought I could do this myself," I
screamed over the loud spray as he jumped into the situation and put the
rod into the plate containing the watering controls. "He'd probably get
this big superiority complex in his head for the next week and rub in
my face that I was Periled Pauline and he saved me from the big, mean
sprinkler!" I added on with a bitchy and bitter voice. </p>
<p>He laughed at my situation and Dean as the water started to finally
stop flowing. "How about me saving you, isn't that the same?" </p>
<p>"No, because you're totally nuts about Shane and you're just a
friend helping a friend out, and you have nothing but friendly
intentions for me. There's a big difference there, it's too bad Dean
can't get over the fact that boys can be friends with girls." </p>
<p>He finally got the flow of water to stop, and him also soaking,
brought the control rod out of the plate, brushing off my complaints
about my boyfriend. "See, all you have to do is apply a little pressure
next time." </p>
<p>"Uh, thanks," was all I could say. I decided to take this
opportunity of Jess wet to test out my sexuality a little as we looked
at each other wet. In a perfect world, I'd be swooning over him and
seriously considering taking him away from Shane. </p>
<p>But immediately my thoughts inexplicably drove me towards an
alternate universe where Paris was the one who came in and turned off
the sprinklers, getting her own self wet in the process. Let's just say
with her breasts and her legs, within moments that thought of her damp
body, had I not shaken myself back into reality, would have wandered off
into a late-night pay cable track that would be very embarrassing. </p>
<p>Looking at Jess, I saw nothing but a loyal and trustworthy friend.
Yeah, he kisses well, but Shane deserves those lips much more than me,
especially when I'm smitten with someone else and considering my mom's
unsaid feelings for Luke. We're already making progress in getting my
mom to like Jess, so we both weren't about to ruin that, along with the
hope she'd finally hook up with Luke by getting into more than a
platonic relationship. Besides that, he admitted his love for his
girlfriend Shane on the bridge Saturday night after a romantic dinner,
and she's keeping him out of trouble, helping him a lot with school. </p>
<p>All right, so they got one ticket for lewd conduct on Taylor's watch
because they almost had sex in his car parked next to the town square.
They're in love dammit, give 'em a break old man! </p>
<p>Jess helped me gather everything back up and I took my soaked
sweater off, hoping by wearing my jacket over my blouse it would dry off
on the way in. We said goodbye to each other and wished good luck with
our days, and he told me he'd take the sweater to the inn so my mom
could throw it in the wash. I handed it over, and just barely made it
to the bus stop and got on with a soaked head of hair and still
shivering. </p>
<p>As we got on the expressway, some smart guy figured that on a
52&#176; day, he was still hot. So him sitting in front of me, he opened
up his window and on the way up to north Hartford (I get off towards the
tail end of the route on the south side of the city, because of transit
cutbacks they don't have direct service to Chilton this year), I ended
up even colder than before with the 55 mph wind blowing right in my
face. My hair was drying a little, sure, but everything else was
staying stubbornly still, or making me freeze even more. I could feel
that my breasts were hard in my shirt, the rough cotton undershirt
rubbing harshly against my nipples, and I shut my eyes trying to
concentrate on some answers for one of the tests. It wasn't happening,
and even closing the coat to build up body heat failed to do anything
but bring the damned shirt closer and make me even colder. </p>
<p>Oh, and he occasionally took a glance back as I read my book, trying
to peek at my breasts through the wet shirt. I got out my huge <i>Advanced
Economics</i> book and hoped that would be enough to deter him. He still
looked however, the idiot. </p>
<p>I was about ready to give up hope and grin and bear the entire day
through chattering teeth and snide Chiltonians commenting on my sheer
blouse's state, when I realized where in north Hartford I was. Gellar
Manor was only a few blocks away from Simsbury Road, and the bus was
traveling south on its way to Main Street, where Chilton was along. I'd
have to walk along a few gravel shoulders, sure, but I could find a
place to at least dry off and... </p>
<p><i>I could borrow one of her blouses,</i> I thought to myself, and
suddenly there was a brilliant flash of light going off in my brain, and
I started smiling. Suddenly, Dwight's evil sprinklers didn't seem to be
putting a damper on my day. </p>
<p>As the bus came within a quarter-mile from the intersection with
Auer Farm Road, things started to take shape. I, Rory, was wet, along
with my blouse. She, Paris was probably dry and would never bring
herself down to the level of a gardener. She also happened to be at my
school, wore the same uniform, and was my current object of lust. Paris
also was hinting at those same feelings lately, and though I couldn't
confirm them 100%, certain little things I was doing to probe her
sexuality were hinting towards the fact she had some thoughts about me.
The neck and back massages, and lingering touches back and forth between
us. Don't forget that we also shared a bed one morning with no argument
and I'd found myself wanting to leave my current boyfriend for her. </p>
<p>As for my state at that time, it was almost perfect for a little
seduction. With my mother's sudden whim to throw everything but the
clothes on our backs into the washing machine at the Inn, I had no bra
on, and was shivering cold. Every time I took a step or the bus went
over a dip or bump, the tips of my nipples would rub against the fabric
of my shirt, and I had to think of things that were unsexy in order to
calm them down and numb them. Say, the effect of Dean's tongue against
mine lately while we kissed. </p>
<p>I was already seeing it in my mind; I'd walk into her room, she'd
hand me a shirt, and I'd take it off, revealing the thin shirt that fit
my body like a glove. I could almost see her eyes drawn down, and her
interest piqued. Paris would probably be thankful I was in that room,
and hand me a shirt right away in order to calm her own nerves and her
hormones... </p>
<p>Which meant even when she was out of the room I was in, she'd be
with me all day long in that blouse, wrapped around my arms with her
scent and essence in my nose, and feeling her own small, yet voluptuous
form all over me. The shirt would definitely be larger than mine, and I
could run my fingers along where the swell of her breasts would usually
be, thinking of my own fingers in the real world against the bottom of
her ample tits... </p>
<p>If not for my clothing and own well-being since I'd catch a cold
staying in this shirt all day, I had to get that blouse with Paris in
order to calm myself down, since thinking all those thoughts seemed to
cause another liquid that wasn't water to seep onto my panties. If I
didn't get off that bus I'd be having an Herbal Essences moment right in
public! That, and once I was off the bus, Paris couldn't turn me down,
she'd be concerned about getting me to school on time to keep our
perfect attendance records going. </p>
<p>The bus speeding along at about 45 mph, I pulled the stop cord,
heard the bell, and gathered my stuff together. At first, the driver
thought it was a prank chime and started to speed up. </p>
<p>"Whoever did that, it's not funny!" he yelled into the bus' PA
system. Apparently not many people took the bus from that upper-class
part of town. </p>
<p>So I got up and yelled his head off. "No, I want to stop here! I've
had a bad day so far and you better pull off to the side and let me off,
don't forget my $40 a month pass is paying your salary buddy!" Boy did I
sound like a prattling housewife. </p>
<p>Everyone on the bus looked at me, but I could care less. The driver
grumbled out "Whatever, here you go girlie," and stopped, and I made my
way to the front. I still felt a little bitchy though, so I thought I'd
give Window Guy a piece of my mind. I bent down to his eye level and let
him have it good. </p>
<p>"By the way you undersexed idiot, next time you see a very wet girl
get on the bus and sit behind you, you might want to consider keeping
your dumb window shut! It's warm, but not <b>that</b> warm!" I then
gritted my teeth and finished off my put down. "Oh, and you're not my
type, sorry to say. Next time take your eyes off my boobs and try to <b>TALK</b>
to a girl, you might get somewhere!" </p>
<p>All I received was a pair of rolled eyes, and I got off the bus
wondering if it was worth it to have a ride like that every morning,
when Paris' car was much warmer, drove over bumps like a monster truck,
meaning I couldn't feel them at all, and had a much better driver. A
luscious looking speed demon one at that... </p>
<p>Uh yeah, I got off the bus and took out my cell phone from my coat
pocket, scrolling through the entries until I found her number. She
picked up, and seemed to be struggling a bit with something. I didn't
know what, but I figured she might have been getting dressed. Ignoring
the thought, I started a long ramble about Dwight and his stupid
sprinkler system, and before I knew it I was only two blocks from her
house. I was about to go into a whole rant about horticulture, when she
interrupted me. </p>
<p>"Gilmore, I know you love rattling off every detail about something
like a monkey on speed since those tapes you bought improved your WPM,
and I'm sorry you got soaked this morning, but I need to know what you
want before the first snowfall of the season." </p>
<p><i>Me on top of you</i>, my inner vixen screamed out in desperation
to mute Paris' annoyance, and I blushed red as yes, that exact thought
got planted in my mind's frontal lobe since I was probably going to be
in her bedroom. I shook that dirty thought out and asked for one of her
blouses and promised to take good care of it, revealing the state of
mind I was in since I was literally down to the clothes on my back. </p>
<p>Though she was a little surprised by my early morning appearance,
she said yes without any hesitation surprisingly, and gave me
instructions to get in. "Ring the buzzer at the front gate and I'll have
Fran let you in, she'll guide you right towards my room through a
shortcut past the kitchen and living room. I don't want you to have to
run into my mother and have her question the reason you're visiting." </p>
<p>Things were still unclear between her and Mrs. Gellar, but at least
she was starting to warm to the idea of me in her bedroom, much less her
house. I hung up with her and finished walking towards her grand house,
and Fran greeted me at the door after I got in the gate with a happy
greeting. </p>
<p>"Hello Mistress Gilmore, Paris said you'd be coming by." Francisca
looked very young for her age, and I could tell why she was one of the
few lights in Paris' life. "Follow me upstairs. Did you want anything to
eat or drink?" </p>
<p>Paris' nanny seemed sincere with the invitation, but I didn't want
to make her feel like I was being an inconvenience. "No, thank you
ma'am." We both headed towards a back patio in Harold Gellar's study and
got into the house through there. I could make out the arguing voices
of a richie-voiced woman and a younger man with a very fake British
accent, three rooms away. </p>
<p>"So are we going to San Diego this weekend Sharon? I'd like to show
you around the yacht I'm planning on using to tour the South Seas," the
man said, and I could immediately deduce that the Sharon he was
referring to was Paris' mother. As Fran guided me through the study
door, I eavesdropped to Sharon's response, and couldn't believe the
audacity she had, cavorting around with that guy and ignoring her own
daughter. </p>
<p>"We should, my daughter is starting to become a pain in the neck
again. She keeps asking me about moving out of the house and into an
apartment near my ex, but I'm not having it. As long as she's under my
roof, she's under my control, and I'll use her however I want." I
blocked out the rest because it turned into a disgusting woo of him. I
couldn't believe that Paris was only here because her mother was using
her as a bargaining chip. December 25th couldn't come soon enough;
because that's the day she turned eighteen and could finally get out of
what clearly was Sharon throwing tens of thousands of dollars towards
the judge a couple years back, and getting at least the custody
arrangements and use of the house weighted her way. </p>
<p>We stopped near the stairs, and Fran noticed my clear anger at
Paris' mother. She turned around, and I admitted I had been listening
in. </p>
<p>"Paris is going to use part of the opened trust she'll get on her
birthday to buy out the house, throw her mother out and take it back for
her father, there's at least $15 million coming for her from her late
paternal grandmother," she told me, honest and open. "Sharon is living
off that man and Harold's alimony and that's basically it, the house
hasn't become a wreck because the judge refused the throw out the staff
for upkeep since Paris' father pays all of us, along with the fact he
had a landmark status put on years back just in case everything that
ended up happening, did, that way there would be big fines levied on
Mrs. Gellar if she let this place fall into disrepair." </p>
<p>It saddened me to hear all these details about the inner gears of
Paris' family, but it brought my heart closer to her empathy. Her nanny
would have married Paris' dad had she not had a love of her own already;
they had a relationship just short of Tracy and Hepburn, despite the
fact they were employer and employee. </p>
<p>"Is Paris happy in this house?" I asked Fran as we climbed the
stairs. </p>
<p>"She grew up here at the Manor with many positive memories, though
the bad have outpaced the good in recent years." Fran smiled, and gave
me that look that said she knew I was loyal and trustworthy. "It's only
been recently however that her lost <i>felicidade</i> has came back,
despite all of this." The woman set a hand on my shoulder, and rubbed my
cheek. "Somehow, I think you may have a lot to do with that. When she
came back from the <i>Distrito</i> where you accompanied her, she was
in a mood she never had been since before she was forced to quit
dance." </p>
<p>Louise had told me about Paris' days as a top dancer in Connecticut
when she was younger, and showed old videos of her performances one day
while we were over at her house studying for a test. Sharon had tried to
destroy the videos, but Louise snuck them out before she could locate
them. Paris tried to ignore them and went in the other room to study as
Louise and I watched her smaller and more petite nine year-old self put
Jennifer Grey and whoever the body double in <i>Flashdance</i> was to
shame with her moves. I could still see her beauty, even through the
haze of eight-year old VHS tape and the occasional shaky camera. She was
on stage, and as she strutted her stuff to tunes from old Broadway
musicals and 70s rock, her eyes told the story as well as her moves.
Learning that Mrs. Gellar had choked Paris' dream the moment she needed
a training bra and being told by her husband that he would not allow
Paris to starve herself in order to save her dance career on her
suggestion, it made me sick. She still had a bright career, and it was
but another thing snuffed out by Sharon's dream of putting a 'My child
attends Harvard' bumper sticker on her Audi's bumper. </p>
<p>I came back to normal time, and tried to shrug off Francisca's
insinuations that I was the one who gave Paris her best summer yet, but
she treated me as if I was the best girl ever to come in her life. We
went down the grand hallway and finally arrived at the doors to her
room. </p>
<p>"This is it, of course," she told me. "Are you sure you don't want
anything, maybe a leaf blower to dry you off?" She smiled, and I
couldn't help but laugh at Francisca's joke. </p>
<p>"No, I'm still fine, thank you; she's letting me borrow a shirt for
class today." </p>
<p>The woman nodded back at me, and bid me a good day, turning around
and headed towards the grand staircase to resume her duties in the
Manor. </p>
<p>I opened the door, my inner pervert getting it's hopes up that I may
be able to catch her in an undressed state. Paris was at her dresser
almost fully clothed though, and I wanted to pout. Despite that though,
she still looked cute, watching her out of her usual element. She was
buttoning up her blouse and turned towards me. </p>
<p>"Hey Gilmore," she said, and I was thankful that my last name had
retaken the playful nickname status that it had before the whole shower
incident. She seemed to pause for a couple moments as she looked over my
condition, as if she was trying to gauge the amount of water and
freezing all over my person. </p>
<p>"Hi," I said back, my voice a little shaky from the cold permeating
my skin. "I'm actually OK--" </p>
<p>"Nonsense, you look like you're in the first stages of hypothermia,
that coat isn't helping at all. Sit on my bed, take off your jacket and
wrap yourself up with that afghan," she told me in a maternal tone,
though it was more warm than nagging. "I'm going to call downstairs for
a cup of coffee so you can get some caffeine in your system to cause
your mind to think that it's warmer." </p>
<p>Though once again I appreciated the offer, I tried to turn her down.
"No thank you Paris, I don't want to seem a bother in your morning
routine--" </p>
<p>"I don't mind Rory, really, now sit down and warm yourself up while
I give you a dose of your favorite drug." She pushed a button next to
her bed and asked for it as I sat down, suddenly warming to her motherly
instincts. "Charles, I need a coffee bowl full of Maxwell House up here
as soon as you can, straight and black, I have an urge for it this
morning." Apparently the kitchen staff was pro-Sharon, but I didn't
care, I was getting a chance to warm up in Paris' presence. </p>
<p>As I thanked Paris and she told me I'd get my wet laundry back on
the way home from school, I took a look around her room, sort of dim in
places, but in most having bright sunlight bouncing on and off the
violet-colored walls. I wrapped the blanket around myself, and with
Paris concerned about getting ready for school, was free to think to
myself. I brought the blanket close to my body trying to dry the blouse
so I wouldn't have to borrow hers, but I could tell it was a lost cause.
Seeing Paris in her natural habitat was interesting to say the least. </p>
<p>She walked around her desk gathering up her books and complaining
about the speed of the Manor staff getting my cup of coffee up there. It
was as if I was watching that episode of <i>The Jetsons</i> where Rosie
the robot went all insane perfectionist on the family because of a
malfunctioning microchip. <i>A place for everything, and everything in
its place,</i> I thought to myself, there was no place in the room that
was cluttered up or out of order. Maybe her corkboard above the
computer desk that was just as packed with crimson-colored pennants and
materials as mine, but that was one of the few exceptions. </p>
<p>As I watched her get ready for school with her back turned and I
tried to warm myself up, I found myself with a chance to look at her in
a way that I thought she wouldn't notice. Paris bent over a little to
pick up a book off the ground, and my eyes were drawn towards the back
of her legs. Her skirt rose up a little, and I found myself stunned in
place, part of her upper thighs exposed. My breath caught, and suddenly
I had yet another perverted thought of 'accidentally' getting up a
little too fast, and slamming into her so I would get an even better
view of the back of her legs...and maybe her rear. </p>
<p><i>Stop it, stop it right now!</i> My monologue admonished. <i>You're
not here to ogle her, you just need a shirt. You're going to be wearing
her shirt all day and you won't think a single dirty thought about it...</i> </p>
<p>However, it was too late. As her servant handed her my coffee in the
door and she gave it to me, I could tell she was going all out to make
me feel so comfortable, and that I should be appreciative for the
gesture. </p>
<p>At the same time however, there was a sexual buildup flowing through
me as the warm and familiar aroma of the boiled coffea arabica plant
went through my nose. She certainly knew by now that the way to my heart
was through my caffeine addiction, and I appreciated that Paris didn't
take it to an extreme level. Starbucks would've been nice, but as I
sipped my coffee at a moderate clip, I started warming up, slightly. </p>
<p>The scent of her afghan alone was getting to me, canceling out the
coffee altogether, and I found myself bringing the blanket even closer.
I read the clock over on her Mac's screensaver. It read 7:24am, and I
would usually be in one of my large shuffling panics, hoping I'd get to
school on time. But being in the room of the girl I was falling for,
something inside of me made me want to stretch out that time out to an
infinite period. My mind analyzed what she might have been doing on the
other side of the line as I called her; something like dressing or just
coming out of the shower, maybe something besides those things entirely.
It wasn't like she had a webcast to her bedroom, but whatever she was
doing was certainly distracting to my subconscious as I set the
groundwork for the events for that morning. </p>
<p>I kept sipping the coffee, though I was sure I wouldn't finish the
cup. Sitting on her bed was really getting to me, stirring up some
strategy in my brain. My wheels were turning, and there was a golden
opportunity being presented at the moment. I had on a wet blouse, and
she was getting hers for me. Beneath my blouse, an undershirt that was
causing me to feel more exposed that usual. And in my eyesight was
Paris' ass, hidden to a point by her flared skirt, but towards the top I
could make out her form. She put on her sweater in front, and I deduced
that she was ready to turn around. </p>
<p>My chest is smaller than most girls, yes; but it's still enough to
lure. I moved my eyes towards Paris' nightstand, noticing the golden
antique hairbrush sitting on the top. Paris had probably used that
multiple times; if I could get those bristles in my hair, there would be
another connection to me right there. </p>
<p>Then suddenly, I had my most erotic brainstorm of the day up to that
point; her hands would be all over the back of my neck, and my actual
back as she tried to brush my hair. She would have to touch me, and I
had a completely justified reason for it. </p>
<p>I closed my eyes, and my analytical self took it and tried to make
it a reality in my brain. I could already feel Paris' breathing in my
ear, her body heat against my backside, and her hands drifting all over
the place. It would be only be a few minutes' time I could enjoy it, but
I was going to stretch that moment as much as I could. </p>
<p>I took one last sip from the coffee bowl, and Paris turned around
and handed me a shirt. </p>
<p>"You can go ahead and change in the bathroom," she told me off-hand,
then turned back around and walked towards the corner of the room where
she kept her shoes. </p>
<p>My usually shy side was taking a nap however. I kept on staring at
the girl, and I brought her blouse up to my nose, despite the 97% chance
that it probably had nothing but the scent of Downy and Martinizing. </p>
<p>After I smelled it however, I was intoxicated and thankful that the
3% chance it was Paris' unique bouquet was in play instead. It was a
little wrinkled, probably straight from her hamper, but that certainly
wouldn't be noticed beneath the spare sweater I kept in my locker at
school. There was a small hint of vanilla perfume around the collar and
her usual melon shampoo, and her own pheromones everywhere else. I just
can't describe her scent without fragrance in words, I don't know, but I
do know that it was sort of calming my mood down from bitchy and angry
earlier, to something resembling lovesick and lustful. </p>
<p><i>There's something here,</i> I thought, looking at the hairbrush,
down towards Paris' shirt, then down at my wet shirt. I found myself
connecting a seductive set of dots and finding another place to get in
some touching with this whole situation. I had wet hair that needed to
be dried. Thus, Paris would use the hairbrush on my head. I was also
cold. I'm sure she had a hair dryer, and that her touching could do more
than chill me for once. I also had fifteen minutes to go before we
really had to leave. I smiled to myself and looked towards Paris,
slipping into her socks. <i>If this doesn't distract her attention,</i>
I thought to myself, <i>I don't know what else will.</i> </p>
<p>So with her eyes on her shoes, I went for it. I shrugged the afghan
off and took off my blouse, still very soaked and completely damp, I
actually wrung out little droplets of water with each button I unhooked.
I could feel the effects of desire start to take over as skin was
exposed in the front; I never had noticed how much space there was
between the bottom of my neck and the neckline of my low undershirt
before. I undid the last of the buttons and the cuffs, and got out of
the drenched article of clothing. It was time for the plan to go into
effect. </p>
<p>Paris turned around just as I got my left arm out of my blouse. "OK
Rory, grab your backpack and let's get down to the--" I dropped the
shirt to the floor, and held her shirt protectively. She paused, but
somehow completed her statement. "...Go downstairs to the, uh, garage." </p>
<p>She was caught unguarded, and I knew it. Her deep brown eyes had
turned from an unaffected look to something that could be defined as
part lust, part scared shitless that she was facing her rival and
friend, wearing nothing but a newly hemmed up skirt and an indecent tank
top that almost showed off my entire upper body. The exposition of a
little more chest to nothing but air caused my nipples to firm up even
more, and I really woke up as I straightened the shirt over my chest
and felt the cotton rub against the tips like sandpaper. I almost
gasped, but bit my tongue so I could continue the slow and painful
seduction of Paris. </p>
<p>I told her in a low voice that was about a fourth-generation copy of
Louise's dulcet tones, which I always thought would make her a top
phone-sex operator, that I wanted her to warm me up. Before I finished
saying 'warm me up' though I realized I was being a little <b>too</b>
forward, so I tacked on the excuse that I didn't want her shirt to
become wet in turn. </p>
<p>She muttered something that sounded like 'sure', and she sat next to
me on the bed. I immediately felt everything within firm up and on high
alert, and my nose could certainly sense her presence. We hadn't even
touched, but I already felt things inside that never happened with Dean
right up against my chest when we made out. My pelvic muscles seemed to
want to do involuntary Kegel exercises, tightening and releasing, as if
wanting to tell me to screw this whole ruse and just take Paris onto the
bed and let her have her way with me, if she was thinking that way. </p>
<p>There didn't seem to be any doubt though. Her look, usually stone
cold and hard or as relaxed as a girl like Paris could be, was instead
in that same gaze I remember her giving Tristan back in sophomore year
whenever she was giving him a loving once-over, admiring the body she
knew he was hiding in that uniform. I couldn't see her eyes, but I could
feel them. The gaze she was giving me felt like it was all over my
upper body, from the freckling all over my shoulders and arms down to
what was obscured by the undershirt. </p>
<p>I smiled and let her know that I knew she was going to ask about
where my bra was, so I was honest and told her laundry day stopped me in
my tracks. Then, I made an unsettling comment that had I not found
those stray panties somewhere in my dresser, I'd have nothing beneath my
skirt. </p>
<p>That got me going, as I felt her stare even more. I felt not only
internally giddy, but very stirred up. I had partaken in my feelings for
her again a couple nights ago during a very unsettled sleep, and I
craved...no, I demanded any contact I could muster with her. </p>
<p>I reached over to her nightstand, and not saying a word, watched the
movement of her eyes as I felt my hand grip the cold metal handle of her
antique hairbrush. Touching that alone gave me tingles, and I handed it
to her, though it seemed like her brain had a sudden seizure and was in
carnal state of mind instead of that of the average teenage girl. She
seemed distracted with her sweater, and asked if I wanted her to brush
my hair. </p>
<p>I gave her a good excuse that I didn't want my hair to soak her
shirt, and Paris took the brush from me. This time instead of a lonely
linger on her fingers, she took her time getting a grip on it from me,
her hands almost seemed to grab mine. I released it, and she stretched
over and grabbed a hair dryer from her nightstand drawer, plugging it in
on a side outlet at bed level. </p>
<p>At first, she had the dryer on high, and it seemed like she was
trying to find a way around brushing my locks. However, the sprinkler
water had done quite a number on my style, so eventually she relented,
and within about a minute, I felt the stiff bristles of her hairbrush
deep within my scalp. Mmmm, just remembering how smooth that brush went
through my hair, and comparing that to my crappy pink Goody from the
beauty shop, there's no comparison, I'd get together with Paris just to
have the right to use hers anytime I'd like. </p>
<p>Judging from how I envied her hair, I knew Paris wouldn't disappoint
with brushing mine, and that's what she did. She alternated between fast
and slow strokes, hitting all those right spots. She'd slow down for a
bit, I think trying to get a feel for what was in back, and then start
back up again, running the hair dryer down and over, then smoothing it
back straight. </p>
<p>Then, she stopped suddenly, and turned off the hair dryer. I
couldn't feel any heaviness against my skull anymore from water, but my
head was feeling dizzy. The heel of her hand had barely grazed my head a
few times, and I was wishing for more touching. I felt my heartbeat
rush up, and then she spoke. </p>
<p>"I'm going to part your hair so it doesn't tangle up in the brush,"
she told me as she started running her fingers through in an innocuous
way. OK, nothing at all suspicious or with an ulterior motive there,
Paris wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. It was an expensive
brush after all... </p>
<p>"Ror, would you mind if I brought down your shirt a little?" </p>
<p><i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop this train!</i> My mind immediately reeled
as my ears took in her words. They weren't in her normal monotone at
all, there was a bit of a smile in her voice along with a
little...flirting? Can Paris do that? </p>
<p>"I want to warm you up," she tried to clarify, but now it was
obvious, she was trying to use this opportunity as much as I was. I
hadn't even let Dean see anything more than my bare shoulders, and what
should be, in a normal dull completely heterosexual world just a girl
borrowing another girl's shirt, was becoming much more than that in the
confines of Paris Gellar's bedroom. Despite the situation, I agreed
without argument, and stretched the neck out so I could get as much as
my back exposed to her as possible. </p>
<p>She parted the hair slowly, and I watched the time tick up on her
computer clock, trying to keep my concentration on things other than her
fingers against my back. I thought about a safe topic, like the <i>Economics</i>
test. <i>7:31 and thirty-four seconds, 7:31 and thirty-five seconds,
7:31 and thirty-five seconds, the concept of supply and demand. Yes,
perfect example! New Coke sucked, everyone demanded Old Coke back in
1985, but the supply was dwindling with the demand...I'm demanding
Paris' touch and I hope she'll supply me and satisfy my needs...</i> </p>
<p>Oh yeah, I did a real good job of distracting myself once I found
out how exactly she'd warm me up, uh huh. Her brush not only smoothed
out my hair, but she was deliberately bringing the tips of the bristles
against my back, and it was feeling so good. It was like heaven having
her do two things at once, and I never knew that she could distract me
to that state. I thought the morning couldn't get any better. </p>
<p>That however, was before she brought her free hand to my upper back
and began scratching the other side as she brushed each of the parts she
created with my hair. I felt myself stiffen as her fingernails scratched
against my skin, and I felt myself respond to her touch. Involuntarily I
felt my legs sort of part a little and my back relax even further as I
felt her trace patterns with both the brush and her hand, I swore I felt
her signing my name and hers into my skin with her thumbnail. The
fingers in her hand she was using to brush would occasionally tickle
against my scalp, and all those erotic and tingly feelings in my head
were being sent down my spinal column all the way down to where I could <b>really</b>
feel it! I started struggling for both breath and thought, my lungs
filling with the air she breathed and all the innocent and negative
notions of her disappearing into the ether. I tried controlling the
arousal wanting to leech onto my panties; nothing was helping and I was
sure by the time I left I'd be dealing with much more than a damp
undershirt. </p>
<p>I then tried to start conversation about the test to the best of my
ability. I used my vocabulary to attempt a block out of every erotic
feeling Paris was sending through, being purposefully wordy so that my
brain had to concentrate on academics instead of sex. I rattled on for
two minutes about Albert Greenspan's economic policy, and hoped that
would do the trick. </p>
<p>It did, at least until Paris' index finger decided to trace around
each one of the vertebrae along my spine up to just above the fringe of
my tank top, she dug in her tips pretty deep. I was lost after that, as
my arms developed full goosebumps, and my lower body started to tingle
with what I can only describe as what felt like my groin becoming very
hypersensitive to anything in and around my walls. The arousal was
building down there, and I was seriously thinking of asking Paris if we
could be late to Chilton just that once so I could choose from one of
two things to scratch that nagging itch; solitary care, or...well,
convincing her to try and 'cure' me of the problem she wrought. </p>
<p>I shut my eyes and couldn't think straight; my breathing was even
more labored than it had been previously. Paris was killing me with her
idea of scratching my back. God, Dean had never done that before. Yeah,
he massaged my back, but over my clothes and in a way that suggested he
was less than enthused with the idea. I was putty in her hands, and if
her next words were for me to commit some kind of crime, I would've done
it if that were my reward after. I smiled serenely, and intended to
keep this morning all to myself. </p>
<p>When I opened back up my eyes, I found that those ten minutes had
sped by in a blur, it was 7:40, and Paris had told me she was done and
that it was time to go, we had a pretty tough commute to navigate in the
next twenty minutes in order to get into class before 8:05. I brought
myself out of my turned-on state, and got up from the bed, really not
wanting to move, but ready for the day ahead. What had been a crap day
the moment I got out of that shower, had with being so close to Paris
quickly become a day where things were changing at a rapid pace into
something wonderful. </p>
<p>"Thanks for brushing my hair, and the massage," I told her in
appreciation, and she didn't vocalize it, but was just as thankful for
everything. We raced out to the garage, got in the car and immediately
peeled out, the rush of trying to make it on time fueling us onto the
road to Chilton. We had a wonderful conversation on the way down as she
peeled in and out of the rush hour traffic along Main Street at a pretty
good clip, I was surprised when we passed a couple of police officers
and saw her speedometer display reading fifty in a forty zone. Her
father must pay off them off in order to let her indulge her inner
speed freak. </p>
<p>I don't know how the hell she did it, but I found her Jaguar going
under the familiar wrought iron gate of Chilton Academy with about six
minutes to spare. Thank the Lord that Charleston gave her a close
presidential parking space right next to the front doors, and we got out
of the car before the engine cooled down after she turned it off,
rushing our way into the hall and stopping off at the twin set of
lockers Chilton seemed to curse us with. We threw both our unneeded
books in and I grabbed my sweater, putting it on in a hurry like I did
that one morning I hit the deer a couple years ago. </p>
<p>Paris and I got into the <i>Advanced Economics</i> classroom with
fifteen seconds to spare, and with the policy being ass in chair at
bell, we avoided tripping over the threshold of the classroom together
and made it in our seats just as the first trill of the bell denoting
class was in session rung. Thank God Madeline and Louise don't take that
class, because with all that running we both did, I could feel that I
was flushed, and Paris' face was shaded red from the exertion. If they
did take the class, I could picture Louise bending down into my ear and
asking me "So, did you both get lucky before school?" as both of us
tried to refute the rumors. </p>
<p>I don't know what Paris did to me that morning, but my concentration
was sort of shaky through all four of the morning periods. In the two
classes in-between that we didn't share (gym's bi-weekly so this week
was all academic), I went over the scenes in my mind all over again as
the instructors thankfully gave us silent book work to mull over for
those classes. I kept imagining the person in the seat in front of me
was Paris, but thankfully I kept the urge to play with their hair
bottled up. I read silently one passage in my <i>AP Honors Journalism</i>
class as 'When you want to make an interview subject less intimidated by
your presence, try to touch their inner selves.' I immediately thought
of Paris, and my fingers doing exactly that. Flushing red, I shook that
thought out of my head, and read it back in reality as 'try to get in
touch with their inner selves.' Her damned shirt was getting to me in
the worst way and I found myself trying to bury my neck within so I
could get more of her scent. The teacher called on me a couple times and
I almost didn't respond to his queries from the distraction. </p>
<p>By the time I got into fourth period and my seat behind Paris in <i>Russian
Novels</i>, I was convinced that this day was going to be far from
boring. Instead of waiting for me to come to her, Paris splayed her hair
across my desk as she sat down in a way that was far from an accident.
Usually she'd keep it tucked behind her chair so that it wasn't a
distraction and I'd have to pick out the strands, and for almost the
entire class period, I found my fingers and pencil winding around
several strands whenever a student in the back got the lucky reading
duties, and when I got up my courage to play with her necklace, the
moment I touched her, I received yet another flash of arousal. </p>
<p><i>OK, you can keep this in control Gilmore,</i> I tried to think to
myself as I kept one eye on the dull reading material and the other on
the back of Paris' head. Mr. Mercurio was far from attentive towards the
middle of the room, and as the midpoint of the class period neared, I
found myself recalling each and every touch, sound, scent and taste from
the morning in Paris' room. </p>
<p>My brain's pleasure center started to create interesting scenarios
as my eyes wandered around the room, uninterested in the translated
literature assigned to me. The classroom had a window into the
courtyard, so it wasn't hard to imagine having interesting conversations
with my row-mate in front of the school's fountain. I shut my eyes,
trying to will any non-scholastic images out, but it was for naught.
Paris' hot breath against my bared shoulder, her hushed flirting voice
and her untamed emotions from when I walked into her room all the way
up to five after eight, all those things were stirring up emotions I
thought I could control within the stone walls and hardwood floors of
Chilton. </p>
<p>I hated to think it, but with her gold necklace chain in the ridge
of a couple of my knuckles, her luscious hair tickling my hand and
remembering her at her most seductive? I was becoming aroused within
that class. Unlike the last time I secretly partook in my feelings
during, I suspected I wouldn't be able to get away with silently coming
with no one the wiser. My clit was throbbing, every shift in the seat I
made was done slowly since I could feel friction each time I moved, of
course the only pair of underwear I could locate was indecently thin and
meant for when I wore a pair of jeans that was just that much tighter
on my waist. I felt my heart beat at a double pace, and ignored any
words coming from the teacher as he discussed yet another boring plot
point. </p>
<p>My eyes opened up wide as I looked out the window towards the
courtyard, and had this image of being backed up inches away, my skirt
pooling on the surface of the water as Paris gave me a hot, passionate
open-mouthed kiss and ran her hands up my legs, trying to get at my
crotch. Even from inside, my ears could pick up the dripping of the
centerpiece of the beautiful open-air quad surrounded on all sides by
the four walls of Chilton's upper classmen building over the lecture and
hum of the overhead projector, where Mr. Mercurio was circling points I
already knew from my Cliff Notes book. I was losing the will to stop
the fantasy, and with the lights turned out so the class could see the
notes better, there was getting to be a huge temptation to cool my
feelings within that classroom, or pray he'd let me use the bathroom
pass so I could finish myself off in there before lunch. </p>
<p>Problem with both of those things however, as I said before, I'd
definitely be loud since my entire body was on overdrive, so no secret
pleasures of the flesh at my desk. The bathroom wasn't safe either,
since Francie had been using her study hall to congregate her
newly-organized secret society to replace the Puffs in there to make
plans behind Charleston's back. Jarvis was the last person I wanted to
find me out and expose my secret. So I gulped it all down, cooled my
libido down by ending my massage of Paris' neck and hair, and thought of
how dull and complicated sex was in French Revolutionary and Napoleonic
times. That stopped all thoughts, with all the layers of petticoats and
dirty French and Russian men and women becoming possible partners, so
the rest of the class period went without nary a dirty thought of
Paris. </p>
<p>Finally, the bell rang, and I got out of my seat, ready to eat
lunch. You'd think the threat of hunger would kill my sex drive,
wouldn't you? </p>
<p>Well, when Paris got out of that seat in a different way than usual,
my thoughts, instead of food, went to eating of a different kind. </p>
<p>Yeah, that other one. Let me set up the scene; </p>
<p>I switched over to the desk on her left for a bit to talk paper
strategy and wondering if I should get a couple different interviews
during my other classes with the faculty to see what they thought about
the run for the championship. She told me she had what she needed and
we'd be ready for layout the next afternoon. Paris was about to get out
of her seat, when it seemed like her right foot's shoe didn't get a good
grip on the hardwood floor since the polishing job the school does in
August had faded away, leaving sort of slippery floors, which caused so
much chaos with the compulsory saddle shoes. It slipped, and I never
expected what I saw next. </p>
<p>She rose up a little from the seat, but with her shoe not getting a
good grip on the floor, she started to do this weird sort of sideways
split. She tried to regain her footing, but it was too late. She fell
back into her desk, and unexpectedly, her legs went into the air a few
inches. She did something that resembled a spread-eagle, but thankfully
there was a metal safety bar between the chair unit and desktop so she
didn't fall through that space and bash her head into the next desk
over. My mouth dropped open in shock, and I thought she might have been
actually hurt. </p>
<p>That was before I saw a slight patch of white. The downfall caused
her skirt to rise up a bit into the air, and as she came back down, my
eyes, usually looking at her face where they were, were drawn down with
the distraction, getting a nice complete gander at Paris' legs, all the
way up to her junction. In the short space of thousands of nanoseconds,
my mind went crazy as it got an unexpected view of her silk panties. She
landed in the seat and the skirt came down, but it was of little
comfort. The photographic portion of my memory had taken a mental
picture of Paris beneath her skirt, and as I panicked, I was afraid that
her eyes had met where my gaze was directed and the last three weeks of
progress would be quickly forgotten. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, my inner vixen did a dance of joy to the tune of <i>I
see London, I see France, I see Paris' underpants!</i>. I really, really
wanted to ignore anything being sent down the sexual pipe by that side
of me, so I put on my innocent face as best I could, and quickly
offered a 'Are you OK Par?", a hand, and some assistance getting on her
feet again. </p>
<p>She took it easily, and with a tight grip on my hand, got up from
her chair steadily, cursing Mr. Mercurio. </p>
<p>"You know, the janitorial crew would come in here and rewax if he
just asked," she told me, and something told me that my little sneak
peek indeed went unnoticed. She ranted a little bit as I suddenly became
newly aroused. I couldn't hear a word she said as a fantasy started
building within my mind without my permission unexpectedly. God, I knew
what she looked like nude already, but in such an unexpected way, that
little slip was turning me on. Beneath I felt the floor beneath my feet
take the texture of wheat bread as thoughts of my face between said
other girl's legs shouted loudly over my regularly academic conscience. </p>
<p>Oh God, the way she was looking was absolutely cute. She had raised
her own hemline at least a couple of inches as I did, and as Paris
rambled on, I did my own interpretation of how the adults in Charlie
Brown's world talked and thought of her saying completely different
things. "Don't you agree that we should campaign Charleston for a
compulsory polish and wax for all classrooms Thanksgiving weekend?"
seemed to turn into "Ror, don't you think the surface of Mr. Mercurio's
desk would be a great place to get between my tanned legs and eat me
out?". </p>
<p>I had to get out of there, before I vocalized that I wanted to do a
different kind of buffing on her than floor waxers did! </p>
<p>"Yeah, it's a great idea Gellar," I told her honestly. I wanted to
say 'Let's go to lunch' and resume the day from there, hoping I wouldn't
think about her slip for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>Leave it to my busy mind however to decide to go on a different
track, and I said something completely different as I felt myself become
even more turned on. "I think I need to refresh my mind a little before
the Life Sciences test, so I'm going to go do some studying in the
library for the first half of the period." I then extended a branch,
hoping she'd take it. "Care to join me?" </p>
<p>"No thanks Gilmore, I have the material pretty memorized," she
answered as she got up and regathered her books. "Want me to save you a
plate of food?" </p>
<p>"Sure." I smiled at her and we said our goodbyes as she went towards
the dining hall and I went to the library despite not having anything to
study. </p>
<p>I intended to stop at my locker on the way to the library to pick up
some of my materials and go over them alone in a carrel until about
12:25, when I'd leave for lunch. I was trying my best to distract myself
from what I had just seen in the classroom, ignoring the powerful vibes
being sent from my mind and my body. Every time I took a step, the
process started anew; everything rubbed up against each other and I
thought again of what would happen if Paris were able to keep going
with her hairbrushing and backscratching past 7:40. </p>
<p><i>Stop it! This is school</i>, my conscience chimed in, but my body
was seriously having problems dealing with all these lesbianic thoughts
of Paris. My feelings for her were hardly dissipating; Tuesday morning
alone they seemed to build even further. Now I was walking down the
halls of Chilton having dirty thoughts of her. Denial again, seemed the
best course of action, so I blocked them out, thinking of Dean. <i>Wonderful,
cute, dependable, boring, safe, asexual, settling for less...</i> </p>
<p>I'm afraid thinking of him didn't help; it only made me recall my
entire Paris pros list, which I went over with fervor as I headed down
the corridor. A minute had passed since the end of class, where I found
the hall traffic surrounding me fading, and my eyes looking up at the
plastic slate above the door that read <i>Franklin Offices</i> passing
me by. </p>
<p>Now in a normal unisexual and completely academic situation I may
have walked right past, heading towards the library, studying like the
good little girl everyone thought I was, then heading to lunch when I
finished. </p>
<p>All the sudden however, I was getting this strong and nagging urge
to demean the privileges vested in me when I took the oath of office for
Chilton Vice President and Paris' assistant editor at the paper. In my
backpack's front pocket, sat the master key to almost every door in the
school, given to both Paris and I as a reward and a privilege for
earning our titles by the vote of the student body. </p>
<p>In front of me, stood the door to privacy. No one ever did <i>Franklin</i>
work at lunch, so I'd have the entire office to myself for the next
forty-five minutes. </p>
<p>I usually hate to be blunt and profane when it comes to my sex life,
but I can't think of any other way to say it; I was overly aroused,
horny as hell and the entire morning had caused my mind to go haywire.
It flashed one of my most sexual dreams between Paris and I, getting hot
and very heavy in the paper's darkroom. I paused in front of the door
and felt my body excite as the mirage of eerie and haunting red glow
from the light bulb above the developing area cast a glow on our prone
bodies as we made love to each other on the table in the middle of the
room. </p>
<p>Who was I kidding? I could've snoozed through the entire year so far
and still gotten at least a 97 on that life sciences test, I wouldn't
forget the material that easily. Considering whose shirt I was wearing,
and how my right hand was against my thigh, craving to make its way
above the hemline of the skirt, I'm sure I wouldn't be caught getting
myself off in the office. Everything on my person felt so sensitive, and
my pussy was begging for attention. </p>
<p>60% of myself didn't want to go through this whole perverted
situation, but the other 40% consisted of my pleasure lobe, the thoughts
I had of Paris and all my sexual parts. I certainly couldn't ignore all
those parts. I recalled the way she had rubbed and scratched my back
hours before, the soft and somewhat calloused feel of her fingers
against my spinal cord, that breathing in my ears, her voice, sounding
very sexy in a hushed whisper. </p>
<p>Not to mention the extra item that was the blouse that fit her
curves quite perfectly residing on my body, and looked very cute and
oversized on my form. I could still smell her scent within, and there
was a voice in my head nagging me to pay her back for her generosity. I
was losing all my hunger for food, and in an extreme mood to sate my
appetite for her. </p>
<p>Paris' blouse seemed to be the next best thing to her warming body
against mine. "Here goes nothing," I whispered to myself, taking the
keychain from the clip in my backpack pocket, and unlocking the door to
the newspaper. </p>
<p>Once I got in and after locking the door behind, I noticed how quiet
and desolate the room was when the paper wasn't being put together.
Desks stood empty, the hum of the 24 monitors in energy-saving mode
seeming to be the predominant sound in the sort of shoeboxed office. I
set my backpack down on a layout table, threading my fingers through my
hair as I brought down the shades on the outside and inside windows,
hoping to God there was no one around. Even in my aroused state, I was
paranoid someone was watching me, so I checked to make sure there were
no security cameras killing my urges. None to be found, and I tiptoed on
the hardwood floors towards the room with the eerie red glow, thinking
about Paris' current overtures all the way over in the twenty feet
between the backpack and the door to the darkroom. </p>
<p>I shut the door, and what might have been a hot place in my dreams
to fuck Par turned out to have some problems. Namely, the drying
photographs hanging from clothesline around the room, moments from all
of Chilton frozen in place. I started unclipping each one from their
individual clothespins, and turning them around so that their eyes
wouldn't see me and throw off the entire fantasy that was being
brainstormed. After about three minutes, I finished turning all of them
around, seeing nothing but the genuine Kodak paper logo staring me in
the face from almost all four directions. </p>
<p>There was a part of me that really hated planning out the seduction
of myself into an orgasm, the same little voice that keeps nagging me to
grab Paris in the hall Francie-style, push her up against the wall and
kiss her numb. However, I couldn't, because I like taking time on my
fantasies. Slowly, I unbuttoned the sweater over her blouse, trying to
watch myself be seductive in a mirror that stood just off to the side of
the sink. My hair was still somewhat flat from the sprinkler incident,
and as I opened the sweater and took it off, I finally got a good look
at myself in the mirror for the first time since I put her shirt on. </p>
<p>"She chose the right shirt," I told myself as I untucked it from my
skirt, trying to muster up something sexy. Then I smiled at the way I
look. I know it pisses Paris off when the moment I get in the car I
strip myself of the tie and untuck the shirt, but lately she hasn't been
commenting on that. She's been even more concerned about the road than
usual, and I can tell there's something inside that tells her I've
become as much of a distraction as a phone call from Sharon asking her
twenty-one questions on her anytime minutes. </p>
<p>I smiled to myself, and with nothing stopping me, inhaled the scent
of her blouse with my nose as I sat down on a hard metal stool. I spread
out my skirt so I wouldn't sit on it and for easier access. Honestly, I
thought I'd be able to keep myself under control. </p>
<p>Watching my eyes trail my hands, I undid the pesky Chilton tie that
I usually felt like would choke me, and unbuttoned the two top buttons
on the shirt, exposing some skin on my front. I could feel myself flush
as my shy self realized the gravity of the situation, but the sort of
thrill of being caught despite the two locked doors in the way of the
catchee spurred me on further. </p>
<p>I brought my hands to the front of my shirt, stroking the material
in a slow and wanting manner, imagining my palms on Paris' waist,
bringing the material up her body and getting a small glimpse at her
stomach. I could feel the cold steel along the edge of the drafting
stool against the bottom of my thighs, and already felt myself wet with
desire at what I was coming up with. I moaned her name as I undid a
couple more buttons on the shirt. So far, so good, I wouldn't mind
sending one salad to the trash that day, because I was going to take my
time bringing myself to orgasm before 12:50 with the fantasy that was
brewing in my mind...</p>

<blockquote class="retro">
  <p>Instead of thinking of a future situation with Paris, I
decided to dredge up something from our past where we may have been able
to fit in our relationship. It's the night of last year's Bracebridge
Dinner, and I changed around a few details to fit my needs. Instead of
lying down to fake a buss as Romeo, Paris went ahead and gave me a kiss
that was so full of love and wanting, that I wanted more. After the
curtain was drawn on the scene, we started making out backstage,
knowing where everything was going from there on. We didn't quite get
to second base that night, but we were both hooked on each other from
then on. So I broke up with Dean citing his jealousy, and started
seeing Paris behind everyone's backs. Whenever we could get a moment,
at the <i>Franklin</i>, girl's night outs in Springfield, Mass.
restaurants that were far from the Chilton and Hartford gossip mills,
sleeping over at each of our houses and getting close and intimate once
either Lorelai or Mrs. Gellar went to bed, we were slowly building up a
relationship behind everyone's backs.</p>
  <p>Then, my mother got the idea for the Bracebridge Dinner. She'd
invite everyone in town for a free supper, sleigh rides and a night at
the inn. I didn't know whether or not to invite Paris since she
technically wasn't a citizen of Stars Hollow, so a couple days before
the day, I dropped a hint to her as we had a tryst in my mom's Jeep that
she might want to drop by with some newspaper work so that she had an
in. With that, Lorelai was sure to tell me to share her room, and we
could consummate our relationship with no one the wiser. Of course she
said yes, and we put the plans for the evening in motion, knowing that
Madeline's writing style somewhat resembled Usher's, who in turn stole
it from Prince, who originally took it from ee cummings. Seriously, is
there any originality in publishing or music anymore? </p>
  <p>I couldn't wait for her to be mine finally, wholly and fully, as I
looked myself over in the mirror and put on a green dress made out of
silk-like material. It slid over my form, and I really felt sexy as I
walked out of the room and my mother told me that I looked like I was
ready to turn heads. There was only one person who I wanted to have all
of her attention; and Paris fit that role wonderfully. </p>
  <p>I did my usual Inn stuff once I got in; the place settings and
things like that. I also do some room service by putting mints on all
the pillows, and getting a look at the register beforehand, I saw the
only room that had a blank spot under it was the Presidential/Marriage
Suite. I thought that was perfect and fortunate; my mother would have to
give a room like that to her if she stayed; Paris would technically be
an invited guest of mine, and with that she did need a room. I
knowingly smile innocently as I walked in the room and place the mint on
our pillow. I just had a feeling I'd forget about that later as we
ached to make love to each other. </p>
  <p>Finally, the time had neared, and after putting that final touch
on each of the rooms, I go downstairs to the front desk and start
checking the townspeople in. I do my best to keep my face unexcited each
time the door opened and instead of Paris, someone like Gypsy or Miss
Patty walks into the front room instead. </p>
  <p>Dean comes in a few minutes later, his hand being held by a girl
I'll kindly say was just a little less whorish than Summer, and who
would be fit perfectly later in life into his 'subservient little
housewife template' he had made up in his head. He regards me with all
the enthusiasm an ex-boyfriend can muster for his former love (read;
barely any), and they go off and join everyone in the dining room to
prepare for the event. </p>
  <p>Thirty minutes later, she still hasn't arrived, and I get worried
because there's some snow starting to fall outside and she may have spun
out on the road down. I start pacing the room, hoping that she's OK,
but there's not much to fear, as moments later she walks into the inn,
her hair covered by a cute brown knit cap and with a bright smile on
her face, her jacket hiding the body I've gotten to know so well over
the last couple of months. I want to smile back, but we have to keep
the cover going, so we both settle for a non-sexual handshake and snuck
blown kisses as she goes over the Franklin stuff we have to look over
during winter break. </p>
  <p>Thankfully, it's not long before we can find an opportunity to be
together, because there's a couple of horse-drawn sleighs in the town
square that go around a couple times, and at a slow clip. We both decide
to go after we go through the little mirage of I inviting Paris to
dinner and Lorelai giving her the Suite since the snow is starting to
come down a little, and we get into the sleigh together, wrapping
ourselves together in the comfy woolen blanket over our bodies. </p>
  <p>We watch the scenery together, and I just love looking at Paris'
face in the cool December night. Her eyes are wide as she looks into
mine, cheeks flushed and rosy, wanting to be warmed by my love, and her
lips&#8230;well it doesn't take long before we're able to sneak in a soft kiss
as we hit a dead spot along the makeshift trail. </p>
  <p>I'm thinking I won't be able to do all that much with her in the
sleigh, seeing as it's so public. But all the sudden, she starts talking
about some obscure book she had just read and how much she loved it to
me, when I noticed her hand hardly at her side, instead it was drifting
up the skirt of my dress. </p>
  <p>I intake a sharp breath and thank God for blankets, as I try to
control her wandering hands. She uses the talking as an evasion topic
all the time in order to get into my pants in my fantasy. </p>
  <p>"Paris," I admonish her as I grip her wrist. "Not until we get
into the room! Geeze, I thought you were going to be more well-behaved
than Dean." </p>
  <p>She gets this cute guilty smirk on her face. "I guess you're right
Ror. After all, I'm just a repressed private schoolgirl with a high
intelligence quotient and lesbian tendencies trying to seduce the same
type of girl, namely you, how can I help it though? I'm repressed and
you're making me come out from my cocoon." Then, she gives me this
serious hovering look that makes me want to either slap her or bring the
blanket even higher against our persons. </p>
  <p>I get an evil idea, and start to play with the buttons on her
jacket, trying to get it unbuttoned so I can get at her breasts above
her full cashmere sweater. At first she resists, until I decide to
relent and let her move her hand higher up my thigh. So we end up
spending the entire sleigh ride not taking in any scenery, and instead
building ourselves up for later in the night, playing with each other
beneath the blanket wearing all our clothes. When we get off the sleigh,
my mother is there to see us in, and notices that Paris' jacket is open
and my dress has seemed to develop a sudden case of static cling in the
front.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"You two better straighten your clothes up before you get in, Taylor's
going to be grumpy if he sees you two at the dinner table like that." We
both laugh nervously and straighten out our clothing, hoping that no one
noticed what we were doing as we made the double circuit around the
gazebo. </p>
<p>My eyes glazed over as I got into the fantasy further, and I loved
the slow burn I was causing to myself. By about that time I'd unbuttoned
the blouse a couple more buttons down to just below my breasts, and
felt the warm air of the darkroom against my undershirt, straining my
nipples right against the cotton. I felt the tank top shift a little up
towards my bellybutton and could see the fringe of my panties under my
skirt. I used my other hand to hike up my skirt a little for easier
access to my clit, massaging it through the blue material. I could
already feel myself wet with desire, and moaned out with each slow
agonizing and teasing stroke. </p>
<p>I could taste Paris in the air as I started to sweat a little, and
could sense her scent. I wish I could've gotten a peek at her bathroom
to at least get a hint of what kind of toothpaste she used. <i>Probably
Tom's peppermint, she's the kind that goes all natural,</i> I thought
weirdly to myself. Why did I suddenly fixate on how Paris' mouth tasted?
I knew she went for something off the pop culture radar when it came to
a mint choice, because when she needed to fill up her gas tank on the
way to Stars Hollow occasionally, she'd pull into the 7 Eleven and
along with the gas, bought a tin of vanilla mint Velamints... </p>
<p>Sorry, I got a little off-track there. Sense my excitement here?
Anyways, I was starting to feel pretty hot sitting on that stool getting
myself off, and could feel the thin wood board that padded the metal
seat start to soak up. I ran a finger slowly against my pantied slit as
I went further with the fantasy...</p>

<blockquote class="retro">
  <p>I fast forward the fantasy through the dinner, where even
though Paris sat next to me, not much happened except for the occasional
hand against a thigh here and there or my foot against hers. Sadly, she
couldn't dress fancy because of our little Franklin work scenario, so
she had to wear loafers instead of dress shoes, but I still was able to
coax Paris to brush her socked foot against mine here and there.</p>
  <p>She loved the dinner (and the company that came with it), but
nagged at Lorelai for some specific problems with the believability of
the activities, including the servers wearing shirts not made from
cotton, or wool. My mother just laughed off the complaints, and I could
tell Paris was being playful with her words. Of course I found her
attention to detail something I loved in her. Especially when it came to
our long talks with each other and going over everything in our
relationship with a fine tooth comb. </p>
  <p>Finally, after some more fun pomp and circumstance, it was finally
time, Paris and I could go up to the hotel room, and we could finally go
farther with our relationship than the occasional backseat groping and
cramped coupling sessions that so far had defined our secretive dance.
As much as I loved her lingerie, I wanted to feel Paris' fingers inside
of me. If her handwriting was that beautiful, imagine how'd she make me
come with those hands. </p>
  <p>We linger in the front room for a bit, talking with my mom about
what we were going to do over the winter break. It was idle conversation
Paris and I really weren't getting into, just enough to keep us in
control until we got up the stairs. The last person climbs the stairs,
and after we hear the door shut, we look into each other's eyes, filled
with lust and want and smiling at each other. Thank God Lorelai's still
under the assumption that we're good friends. </p>
  <p>Paris and I run up the stairs and into the suite, our hands
intertwined as we locate the 'do not disturb' sign and she hangs it
outside on the door, hopefully no one is on to us, but I doubt it since
the townspeople should know how exhausting Chilton's curriculum is and
that I'm thankful I get such a long two week break. </p>
  <p>The door hasn't even clicked before Paris has wrapped her arms
around me and starts playing with the back zipper on my dress. She eases
me into a luscious and cute open-mouthed kiss, and that awesome feeling
of her lips against mine sends a chill up my spine as we slowly
navigate the space between the door and the bed. </p>
  <p>"Don't you think we should light a few candles, get some romantic
atmosphere in here," I stumble out between kisses. "I mean it's our
first time&#8230;" </p>
  <p>She shushes me up with a finger to my lips, my eyes following the
digit as she brings it from my lips and into my hair to run it through.
"We can do candles and flowers and chocolate kisses on Valentine's Day,
right now all I want is you Ror." She kisses my nose softly, and I
almost want to tear up, that she wants only me, not the other things
that surrounded it. "Though that bowl of chocolate ice cream with peach
slices I had for dessert probably has something to my sudden craving for
you." </p>
  <p>I laugh, as I run a hand against the bottom of her breasts through
her red speckled sweater and try to muster up a seductive tone. "I
suggested that for the menu just for you, I read once that they're
sensual aphrodisiacs and I know from experience that you love peaches." </p>
  <p>She moans out, the whole seduction is working so perfectly.
"Would've been a better dessert if you would've been feeding me though."
I move my hand down and into the shirt, and she brings me down with her
onto the bed. </p>
  <p>There are no words as she starts to bring down the zipper holding
my dress together, and I try to move her shirt up so I can get a hold of
what I really envy about her, God I love her breasts, they're like
pillows that I've ended up sleeping on a few times when I got Mom to let
her sleepover after one of our meeting of the minds where I'd bounce
paper ideas of her, and Paris would return some more. I knead them
through her bra sensually, running my thumb against where I guess her
right nipple is. She gasps out and cries my name as I find just the
right spot. </p>
  <p>"Oh God," she says, and Paris is distracted from her task for a
moment as I hear the slight sound of a rip coming from the back. She
finishes unzipping my dress, but the shock of my touch apparently made
her grip the material, causing it to tear below the end of the zipper. </p>
  <p>"I'm sorry, I guess I got a little too wild there, I'll pay--" Her
apologies are muffled as I kiss her again, trying to bring her focus
back to the task at hand. I decide not to get revenge on her by ripping
off her sweater, and she lifts it off and throws it off to the side. I
look at Paris' chest, covered up by her bra, and still think she's
wearing too much. </p>
  <p>I slide out of the shoulders of my dress, and I can see the
giddiness in her eyes as she finds there's nothing between it and my
breasts. I decided to go without intentionally just so I could see her
reaction. Her mouth drops open, and she somehow finds words to comment
me on my gutsy move. </p>
  <p>"I thought I had the shy one," she gasps out, and she looks at my
naked front with this reverence that's usually reserved for an article
or a well-produced debate argument. "I'm going to die young if you keep
on shocking me like this." </p>
  <p>I muster a sexy smirk and wind my arms around her back, her body
hovering over mine as I get a deep view into her cleavage inside of her
bra. "I am Mary you know, puritan and clean on the outside..." I trail
off as I stretch out the bra hook and release it, hearing a satisfying
snapping sound as Paris' tits are freed, "But inside I'm yearning for
you." </p>
  <p>We tangle together, and we get more intimate as the minutes wear
on. Shoes, socks and hosiery get kicked off, and I manage to make
surprisingly fast work out of stripping Paris of her corduroys,
revealing her wine red-colored undies, already damp with building
arousal. With her watching me, I brought my nose down to just above her
stomach, taking in her fragrance. There was nothing in there but untamed
wanting and longing for me, my body, and my heart and soul, looking
down at me as she released her hair from an uptight, conservative
ponytail. </p>
  <p>Foreplay with her is amazing; I can tell though she's never had to
do it before, she's been reading plenty of books on the subject of sex,
and trying to learn from the mistakes her mother and father made in
their years together. She's harsh when needed, but there's this side of
her that's just happy someone loves her. She plays with my breasts and
kisses down my torso just as much as I do to her, and I love the slow
torture that she's giving me. I reward her with the same attention she
deserves, taking a hold of her body and showing her I may have been a
sexual slouch when it came to Dean, but that was only because I was not
only with the wrong guy, but the wrong sex altogether. Somehow, my oil
and her water mix perfectly when we're together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shut my eyes and go with the flow of the fantasy as it continues. I'm
not even watching the clock as the blouse Paris lent to me was fully
open, I took my right hand and brought it beneath the undershirt, trying
to tease my breasts. They're both firm and hard, excited beyond belief
from not only the mixed signals, but what I've been dreaming about;
imaging Paris giving each one attention. I slipped a finger in my mouth,
coated it with saliva and moan erotically as I run it against the outer
circular areola; the tropic temperature of the darkroom heating my body
so much I had to keep myself from fainting. </p>
<p>My other hand was just as occupied, loosening the snaps of my plaid
skirt as I dreamed Paris was doing that instead. I opened it up and ran
the hand against the blue waistband of my underwear. Because of the dark
color of the room I couldn't actually see how damp I was, but from the
sense of air flowing beneath my pussy, my lips were quite damp. I
couldn't take everything off obviously; so I had to make do, trying to
shove the skirt as off to the side as possible so I could access my clit
and get myself off. I could hear the unbalanced stool shake beneath me,
the feet not properly aligned with the floor, so I started to be scared
I was going to fall off the chair and onto the hard linoleum floor
below. </p>
<p>Thankfully, I was able to be somewhat enterprising and find a
perfect position to screw myself in the cramped space. I stayed on the
stool, but moved it to between the photo-sorting island table in the
middle of the room and the side counter. I then reclined up against the
front of the counter, my back resting comfortably and used my feet to
brace against the island, thankful that Chilton was an expensive enough
school to afford a high-quality darkroom like that. I spread my legs a
little, and pulled the skirt down my legs just enough to mid-upper thigh
so I could see my groin. Then I brought my undershirt up just so it was
exposing my navel, and prepared to jump back into the fantasy,
literally, as my right hand traced the faint outline of my wetness and I
renewed my makeshift fantasy...</p>

<blockquote class="retro">
  <p>Paris and I are under the sheets and blankets of the large
king size bed, very comparable to her bed, and though I think she's
going to try to initiate cunnilingus on my first time, she tells me it
might be a lot easier on me if we just did hand-to-pussy with each
other. We're completely naked, and hoping that no one ignores the sign
on the front door and tries to unlock the door and walk in on us.</p>
  <p>She seems a little nervous, as do I, and we take a little break
from pleasure in order to calm our fears. </p>
  <p>"Did you...um, would you want to be on top?" she asks me, biting
her lip as her doe eyes look into mine, trying to decode the answer
straight from my mind. "Because if you wanted to, I wouldn't mind being
bottom, at least that's how I was taught in the books since the--" </p>
  <p>I take her hand into mine and try to calm her down, she's almost
scared. "Par, those situations are with a man and a woman, they
certainly don't apply to us at all." I bring her close, and kiss her as
I bring my hand up to her inner thighs. "I respect you and I've taken
most of the initiative trying to keep this hidden, so I feel like you
should be on top." </p>
  <p>"You're sure?" she asks, sort of with a frown and her voice
strained. "I don't want you to feel inferior to me, you know we're
equals in this--" </p>
  <p>I couldn't take it anymore, what with her left thigh right up
against my apex, her chest on mine and both of her hands on each side of
my rear, so with all the strength I had, I caused her to roll over so
that I was on the bottom, and Paris was right on top. I move my hand
from her side, and towards her crotch, and though we were both covered
with the blankets and sheets, she knew what I was trying to do. All I
had to do was vocalize the confirmation. </p>
  <p>"Paris," I said firmly, her eyes never leaving mine. "Fuck me." </p>
  <p>I think that basically shut her up, hearing her girlfriend use
profanity so freely without regards to her usual puritan virtues. I hear
her voice gasp at the shock of the F word from the girl below her, but
she still moved down and we started to kiss heavily as she tried to
reassure me about what she was about to do. In the fantasy though, I
thought of myself as already broke for some reason or another, so I
assure her I wouldn't feel a thing but her hand inside of me. </p>
  <p>"You know I love you, right?" I coo, and she smiles at the warm
words. </p>
  <p>"Yes, and I love you too Rory." With that, I eased my left hand
into her slowly, and she slips her right into my wetness, careful to
make sure I was ready to be filled. Within moments, I feel dizzy with
desire as without trying, she hit a very sensitive spot within my walls. </p>
  <p>"Oh God!" She firms up as I scream, thinking I was in pain. I use
my free hand to grip her wrist, and my smile said it all; I wasn't in
much pain. A little bit from the stretching out hadn't been done before,
sure, but it was easily replaced with a wonderful dose of relief called
ecstasy. She resumes her slow strokes, experimenting all over and
trying to find just that right spot to give me pleasure anew. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile, I don't know how Paris was doing as my hand strokes in
and out, but whatever I was doing, though not as shocking to her as my
screams, it was working. She sighs and moans, content with my pace so
far, though I haven't hit a sensitive nerve yet, I think of her as sort
of uptight, so I expect to take a while to figure out just what makes a
Paris Gellar orgasm tick. Her hair is against my shoulder and I feel her
breath quicken with each push and pull, movement in and out. We seem to
find a rhythm, and I calm down as the stress past my lips seems to numb
from the pleasure of her fingertips. They feel comfortable and
passionate, the ridges of her prints seeming to treat my insides like a
finely-tuned engine, trying to find that right place for me to make a
certain sound. The heel of her palm is against my clit, and I feel fully
and truly whole. The "Oh God!" cry of earlier seems to be reduced to a
murmur of contentment with my schoolmate as her idea of pleasure is
something I'm quickly starting to agree with. </p>
  <p>She eases each finger in slowly, and from two to three, I start to
feel very content. My pelvic muscles tighten up against her digits and I
feel my hips involuntarily rise up and down as Paris' hands, not to
mention her well-manicured fingernails <i>(Mmm, another thing I love
about falling for a rich girl)</i> find all the right spots. On her end
meanwhile, Paris seems to be just fine. I'm a little more awkward and
tentative with my strokes, but she doesn't seem to mind my more
experimental nature of things, because she's trying to get more of my
hand inside of her with each push in. In my hand, she feels so warm and
open, she's definitely a hidden sexual being. </p>
  <p>I decide to push a little deeper within, and we're looking into
each other's eyes, gazes never wavering. I can tell Paris is loving the
deeper push because all the sudden she bites her lip and whines, which
with her mouth open would have certainly been a scream. We're still
kissing so much that I can't even count each time her lips have touched
mine or my cheeks, and my hand is cradled against the small of her back
as I nuzzle against her nose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know what it was about being alone that was causing me to be a
little more adventurous, but I was doing more than rubbing myself as the
fantasy went on. My legs were spread even wider and I used my left arm
for leverage against the back of the counter to stay steady. My panties
are about halfway down my thighs and I'm feeling very damp as I work my
clit over, thinking of Paris' hands. God, it felt so good, even moreso
than when I thought of her in the dorm closet months before and any of
the times I've thought of her in my own bed. I felt the tangle of fluid
and hair around my fingers, and it made me feel ever more untamed. I
was ready to foam over soon, bucking against my hand as the dream of
Paris and I went forward. I looked up at the clock to get an idea on
time; only fifteen minutes left! I had been so into the fantasy that
there was no way I'd be able to finish, clean myself up and eat. </p>
<p>My fingertips were glistening with my cum as I drove them in as deep
as I could without tearing through, I was almost crying as I begged
myself for a release, basically gasping for air. My exposed skin was
covered with a light sheen of sweat as I continued on, and I tried to
resist the high temptation to stop and cool off in the office. I knew my
hair was basically done for, and it was too late to realize that
several of my fellow peers would take one look at me when I got back
into the halls and deduce that I got laid during the lunch hour. </p>
<p><i>Screw 'em</i>, my usually conservative conscience chimed in. <i>They
don't even pay attention to you and Paris in the first place, they're
all about the QB anyways lately, he's the big man on campus.</i>
Remembering that I have no interest in any of the males on any of
Chilton's athletic teams, I decide to go into the homestretch and
conclude my fantasy, what with Paris' shirt becoming close to soaked in
the underarms...</p>

<blockquote class="retro">
  <p>I can tell Paris is starting to tire and her energy is
fading as we almost come to the point of satisfaction. She's wavering
and her grip on my body is starting to loosen, and I think I'm getting
to that same state of exaustion. I feel my lips becoming numb from all
that stimulation and she's told me the same thing with hers, so we're
stroking each other's in a flurry of activity, we can feel the bed
beneath us creak as our sex is coming to fruition. She's still caring in
the rushed lovemaking, kissing my forehead as she beckons me further.</p>
  <p>"Come on hon, come on," she pants out. "I'm almost there--". She
groans in pleasure, and I see her eyes roll back in her head as she
tries to drive herself further into my hand. I think I've finally found
her spot, so I leave it where it is and ask if where my hand works for
her. Paris sighs "Yes!" aloud, and we're both starting to get to our
peaks. My body is writhing up and down, and I can feel my boobs bounce
up and down on my chest with each stroke of my pussy into her hand. I'm
smiling deliriously, and I can feel the beginnings of the orgasm
building. </p>
  <p>Paris' strokes are coming at me in rapid succession now, and I
feel her fingers pound against my walls like a drumbeat. I didn't think
it would ever feel that divine, but I'm starting to see stars from her
attention. Noticing my body is starting to shake and it's almost time,
she starts tugging at my clit in order to hasten me. Almost, almost... </p>
  <p>"Paaaarrrrr, ugggghhh," I scream as I try to will the O further. I
want her to see that she's the one true person that I love. We push into
each other, trying to find our way into a combined euphoria. Our teeth
are gritted, foreheads scrunched, and our bodies are as tight as rubber
bands as we ride out those last few movements in each other's arms.
This night has been even better than words could ever describe. </p>
  <p>Finally I feel release and I shriek at a high decibel as I cry out
Paris' and God's names together as I feel my muscles contract tight
against Paris' hand. My mouth is wide and I swear I can't breathe as the
orgasm she gives me makes me see literal stars in my eyes. It's
sensual, beautiful, raw, and everything that I ever dreamed of for my
first time with her. Somehow I manage to find just that right spot
within her, and a couple minutes later Paris is reversing the process,
even if she was a little late, but I blame my inexperience for that. In
my eyes, she becomes more than my academic rival and girlfriend; we
share everything together, and I hope this night shows her that I'm
nothing but thankful that she breached that barrier between romance a
few weeks ago on that stage. </p>
  <p>It takes us both quite a while to settle our bodies down, damp
with sweat, tears and our fluids, but I wouldn't have it any other way.
After she comes down from the high, with me being the taller one in the
relationship, Paris spoons into me and gives me an intimate hug, smiling
as she plays with my hair, and I in turn flitter around with her locks.
She looks at me with her wide enigmatic eyes colored the same shade as
a walnut, and finds nothing but reverence. </p>
  <p>"So earlier," she says, "when you asked for candles and all that
other stuff? Much safer and sexier in just the dim light, isn't it Ror?" </p>
  <p>"Very," I affirm. "We both have long enough hair anyways, candles
would've been a fire hazard to this entire evening." I nuzzle her nose,
and listen to the sound of her breathing. "I really did want to feed you
peaches and chocolate ice cream though, think it's too late?" </p>
  <p>"It'll make a delicious breakfast at the very least; right now I'm
too full to eat, physically and spiritually." She kisses me, and I start
to feel the situation start to lose a little steam, albeit with some
nice closure. </p>
  <p>"You're not turning down a session of lovemaking in the shower
when we get up then?" </p>
  <p>I watch her smile curl even further as we cuddle into each other
and get ready to fall asleep. "I told you I loved you today already,
right Gilmore?" </p>
  <p>"You did, about five times," I say as I feel her chest press
against me and sleep coming fast. "Of course, it's not too late for you
to tell me again to make it number six." </p>
  <p>"Then I love you Rory," she confirms in her best seductive
monotone. "How was that?" </p>
  <p>"Just what I was hoping for again, for I love you too Paris." We
fall asleep in each other's arms, knowing the magic of the snow outside
falling on the streets and lawns of Stars Hollow has once again worked
its unique magic on two lovers, undiscriminating about whom loves whom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dream ends just as I started the last strokes of my hand against my
clit and I bucked against my fingers, feeling satisfaction seeping from
my pores. I was so a total mess and going to need a trip to the bathroom
on the way in, but as I came all over my hand and a towel I had placed
over the seat of the stool so I could catch any arousal dripping from
me, I felt so content and full, dreaming of Paris that way. I was about
half-naked, but I had fulfilled a sudden fantasy that I loved carrying
out. It took a couple minutes for the orgasm to go through me so that I
could regain my footing as I got out of the painful position I was in,
though the sexual feelings numbed any extra back pain I was sure to be
carrying around for the rest of the day. </p>
<p>I looked up at the clock and found it reading 12:43pm, which meant I
had seven minutes to get ready to get to the classroom before the class
I took started. Since it was in another building, I started rushing
things a little, toweling myself off with a paper towel and intending to
flush it down the toilet as I struggled to rebutton up my blouse and
straighten up my shirt. I was in a panic, and it took at least a minute
to find the discarded tie within the pitch black area along the bottom
of the darkroom's floor. </p>
<p>As I bent down to pick it up, I remembered that I hadn't pulled my
panties up quite yet. I picked up the tie and was prepared to pull them
back up, when as I rose, I felt this blissful rush of cool air rising up
beneath my skirt and breezing across my numb mound. I shuddered at the
shock, and suddenly my devilish conscience, the one who in my mind wore
a slutty low-cut top with a high-rise red leather skirt, seemed to have
tied up Good Rory temporarily, because I got an idea that made me
smirk. </p>
<p><i>If you don't have the top,</i> I reasoned with myself, <i>why not
forgo the bottoms? Isn't like anyone's going to notice the school's good
girl without a certain something beneath, and it'll certainly make the
paper work and ride home <b>very</b> interesting.</i> </p>
<p>I recalled Paris' reaction to my not having a bra on earlier that
morning, and I swore I remembered her pouting because I still managed to
find a pair of panties despite the laundry situation. It wasn't like
they were ruined at all; some drops of arousal in the crotch but
certainly something I could keep. But if I didn't, my skirt was still
long enough to hide the fact I was taking a couple lessons from Louise.
I still remembered her description of trying to unnerve a teacher last
year by grabbing a convenient front seat and spreading her legs open so
the teacher was lured into giving her A's, and thinking at the time what
were to happen if I tried that same thing with Paris around, only
instead of grades I wanted gratification. I did happen to do that as we
took the Acela train down together from New Haven to Washington in June,
but since I was wearing jeans on the train, everything was basically
negated so there was no chance to gauge her reaction. </p>
<p>I smirked as I spread open my legs and let the blue cotton drop to
my ankles, then picked it off my legs and threw the incriminating
skivvies into the deep, deep section of my backpack. I put back on my
school sweater and cleaned up the darkroom a little to hide what had
happened in the last half hour, and gotten out of the Franklin office
and into the hall just in time to blend in with the crowd coming from
the dining hall. </p>
<p>Then I stopped at my locker, and found Paris at hers, digging for
her texts for the next three periods. She looked so cute, if only she
had known how I just thought of her minutes earlier. I grabbed my books,
and said hi to her. She looked towards me, and suddenly got this
disapproving frown on her face. </p>
<p>"What?" I questioned, shrugging. Did she know I was-- </p>
<p>"You might want to make a trip back to the bathroom before class.
Charleston's going to stop you and make you sing the spirit song
backwards in Klingon if you don't straighten yourself out there
Gilmore." </p>
<p>Looking down at myself, it seems in my rush, I forgot to tuck Paris'
blouse back into my skirt, and one of my socks was askew, not to mention
I had to be wearing that nature-made color they call Afterglow Pink all
over my face, judging from my messed up hair. </p>
<p>I rush out thanks for her looking out for me, and clean myself up in
the bathroom, making it to AP Calculus just before the bell trilled and
thankful she didn't notice anything else or comment on my absence during
lunch. The rest of the day seemed to strangely speed up after lunch, but
probably because my adrenalin was on overdrive. It was such a rush to
sit in each of those classes and sit there learning, reading and testing
like usual, knowing that you're getting a kinky little thrill from
having nothing on beneath the Chilton tartan. </p>
<p>My mood was a mix of giddiness and disappointment at the same time
as Paris and I took the test in <i>Life Sciences</i> seventh period.
Though I could sense her ankle up against mine and what seemed like
accidental contact, I could tell she was hiding something as the hour
wore on. My libido was seriously pissed however, since because I was
taking a test, I couldn't gauge any reactions by looking towards her
because I didn't want to look like I'd be cheating off her paper. I knew
the material and the teacher knew I did, but better to keep eyes
straight and thoughts on the chemical compounds within molecules and
just let myself enjoy what went on underneath the table. So close to
footsie that day, but it kept my flared-up hormones under control at
least. </p>
<p>A couple hours later after school as we did the work on the paper, I
felt nervous that someone on the photography staff would discover that
someone had been sleeping in their room and they'd discover that I was
the Goldilocks in the scenario. I kept looking nervously towards the
room as I organized my thoughts into a profile about the team's trainer,
about the only person on the Blue Demons I'd write about since the team
itself intimidated me. Paris organized it all and there was a general
sense of bedlam in the room I'd usually associate with a busy scene in <i>All
the President's Men</i> as Paris and Ms. Peters organized us foot
soldiers into a lean, mean, reporting machine trying to focus all our
energy on this one special edition. Sports, News, Photography, Layout
and Entertainment seemed to be able to work well, and I respected my
girl for managing to fit all of this stuff into thirty-two pages to be
handed out by third period Thursday morning. Even Madeline and Louise
worked diligently, scanning the results of an unscientific poll they
had taken throughout the day asking who the five cutest guys on the
team were. I didn't vote of course, but they respected that despite. It
was a rush to go from Paris' original idea on Friday, the staff getting
stories all weekend and Monday, then drafting through last night into
today until around 4:20, all of the staff was in the conference room
looking at the projected computer layout of <i>The Franklin, Special
Edition - The Blue Demons' Run to State.</i> </p>
<p>Paris was proud of all of us as she went through each of the pages,
pointing out something on each page and giving a personal thank you to
each of the contributors and photographers. For once, she had nothing
negative to say at all, though she did tell poor Brad to maybe not put
that he wanted his mommy and was very scared as he interviewed Cornelius
DeMateo, the 345-pound defensive back that easily tore through the
front offensive lines of most of our rivals. He managed out a "Sorry,"
and Paris gave him a smile as everyone laughed with him. He's a good
kid, and even Paris, who lives to torment him, is taking it easier on
the boy since he came back from a successful run on Broadway as a
character in a top musical over the summer. I might be seeing things
also, but Madeline is flirting with him at times when Louise's back is
turned, sort of like the dance I've been initiating with Par lately. </p>
<p>She praised my article on the habits of the team trainer and told me
I had come a long way since my poetic prose on the parking lot
resurfacing I started my high school journalism career with. By the time
the meeting had ended ten minutes later and everyone was dismissed, I
was on cloud nine as Paris and I got into her car and she started the
drive back to the Manor to pick up my dry clothes and was thankful no
one made a comment on the darkroom. She pulled up to the front drive,
Fran handed her my blouse and jacket, and within a few minutes we were
on the expressway out of Hartford. </p>
<p>I was hoping that I could get home in time so that I could change
into regular clothes that my mom had dropped off, get in the shower and
clean up so I could meet Jess and Shane around 5:15 so we could discuss
an Austen book I had recommended they read together. I thought with the
school day over, I could get home unscathed and not have to face up to
any more awkward situations. </p>
<p>Oh, how wrong I was. The usual smooth commute turned into a
nightmare as the traffic reporter on WTIC broke into the talk show Par
was listening to with a loud boisterous traffic alert. </p>
<p>"91 at the Cross is currently closed due to a jackknifed semi
blocking all lanes, CDOT is out cleaning the wreckage and traffic both
directions is absolutely jammed. The state patrol is currently
redirecting southbound traffic onto the 691 west..." </p>
<p>"No!" I cried out, and Paris rolled her eyes as she prepared for the
bottlenecks ahead. Route 691 usually added twenty more minutes onto my
ride home because we had to take a whole bunch of surface streets and
two lane highways once Paris reached the exit for the road we needed. </p>
<p>Paris huffed annoyed, mad at the unexpected delay. I took this as a
bad sign and got out a book from my backpack, trying to stay out of her
way as she navigated the heavy Tuesday gridlock. I couldn't concentrate
however, because she kept cursing to drivers in other lanes once we
merged onto west 691. </p>
<p>"C'mon!" she complained angrily, pushing down on her horn and
directing her bile towards some jackass who merged across three lanes of
traffic and right in front of us.<i> Thank goodness for soundproof
material</i>, I thought to myself as she went on and on with her
complaints about idiotic Harford drivers preventing her inner speed
demon from playing on the expressways that afternoon. </p>
<p>Her forehead was scrunched up and she was gritting her teeth. I have
no idea why a thought like that came to my head, but I thought asking
her for rides was starting to become a hassle. She was trying to use
conversation to distract me from the jam, but it didn't seem to work as
her Jaguar was crawling along the road at a glacial speed of fifteen
miles an hour, her face becoming redder with annoyance by the moment. </p>
<p><i>She needs a little boost, or perhaps a little distraction</i>, I
thought to myself as I turned the temperature down on my side because my
mind usually can't handle a small space like a car more then necessary,
causing me to think I was hot. I brought my eyes down to the book in my
hands, but my gaze was directed down towards my breasts. I loved
unnerving her during that car ride a couple weeks before with nothing
but the open road ahead of us, surely I could help her decompress what
anger she had at the situation. Plus it would only be natural for me to
change back into my own blouse and give hers back. </p>
<p>So I went with my plan, taking off her blouse and throwing it in the
back. Usually when she saw the Chilton uniform unkempt on anyone else,
even after school, she'd go off on the unsuspecting person with a tirade
about how could they ruin the integrity of fair Chilton's uniform, your
shirt should stay tucked in, blouse or shirt straight and starched and
skirt even on your legs, it went on and on. </p>
<p>I must've been a big exception though, because lately she hasn't
been making a negative comment towards me. So I lay back on the seat,
straightened my undershirt out and untucked it from the skirt, knowing
that she might bring her eyes towards my waist to glimpse at the skin
exposed. I was also feeling a little hot despite the temperature, so I
turned the climate control on my side even lower. Nothing like a little
gratuitous in-the-shirt nipple exposure from a cool air conditioner vent
to drive a certain blonde up the wall. </p>
<p>We talked as we got into the thick of the quagmire, Paris' mood not
improving as time passed. The minutes ratcheted up on the clock, from
4:40 up to 4:50, my hope for getting to Luke's on time at 5:15 fading
and my annoyance along with Paris at the traffic rising. I read the
book, sort of aware of her eyes on me. I judged her look to be more <i>I
could be home studying by now instead of chauffeuring Rebecca here back
to Sunnybrook Farm</i> than of carnality; her mood seemed to be
unreadable. We tried broaching conversation, but it just wasn't
happening. I honestly that it might be a hell of a lot better for both
of us if we took separate cars home, that way she'd never have to drive
me back to Stars Hollow again. </p>
<p>She was finally able to make conversation by asking if the traffic
would clear, so I complained that Luke would be 80 by the time I got
home, and that it wasn't my day. </p>
<p>"So this day was bad for you Gilmore, big deal. Suck it up and think
ahead to tomorrow, the forecast is for sunny and 63&#176;, as Annie says
it's only a day away." I didn't see any humor in it though. I still had
seven hours to go on Tuesday, and she was getting in a bad mood that I
thought I caused. I asked her why she'd give me a ride when it was a
clear hardship on the time she spent on her studies. I talked about how
much better it would be if I was on the bus and she was on her way home. </p>
<p>What happened next just about made it clear that Paris was far from
annoyed at me. </p>
<p>As she started to tell me that I was no hassle to take home, I saw
her right hand move towards my legs. I then gulped as she set it down on
my left thigh, just above my knee. If I had been tuning out the fact I
wasn't wearing underwear for the last couple hours, I had just found a
clear signal since the moment her palm made contact, my clit responded
immediately. </p>
<p><i>Oh God, oh God, oh God, her hand is on my thigh!</i> My touch
senses relayed to those certain parts, and since the seatbelt was
cinched tight around me, I couldn't move, or evade. It seemed completely
innocent, a reassuring technique as she reminded me about the fact her
mother paid for her fuel. </p>
<p>I bit my lip, thinking that it wasn't going to go beyond that; she
kept looking at the road talking, not noticing that my other leg was
shaky and I felt so underdressed! Then her hand started shaking my leg. </p>
<p><i>Oh Paris</i>, my internal dialogue gasped out, her simple touch
wearing my mind thin. There was really nothing I could do; I was putty
in her hands since as her aversion tactic to take my focus of my
complaints was working, maybe a little too well. I could feel my legs
part involuntarily and I tried to keep my mind in control, despite the
fact I was wetting the rear of my skirt with my arousal. </p>
<p>I tried to speak to argue back against her pols-on-the-bus point,
but my scholarly mind seemed to regress back to kindergarten as all my
brain power went to processing the fact her perfectly-manicured
fingernails were now scraping against the inside of my leg and were
rising at the rate of a millimeter a second! <i>Damn you Paris, damn
you and your evasion techniques</i>. I forget what I said back to her,
that's how distracting she was. </p>
<p>I felt everything stir and respond and my line of vision fogging up,
breathing become heavy and my heartbeat speeded. The book was losing the
battle for attention, and as her fingers trailed above the hemline of
the skirt, I became very aware of what was happening. I set the book
down and listened to her explaining why exactly I was not a pain in the
ass, wondering if it would be bad form to grab her wrist and shove her
fingers into my wanton pussy since that's where she was probably headed
anyways. </p>
<p>The only thing I could decode from her words in my lust-fogged mine
was "I'll be there for you always, no matter what". At least my romantic
side got a little numbing and a little swoon, but the primitive animal
never aroused within me took that as an open invitation. God, I wanted
her so bad, her hands in me, getting me off through the traffic jam as I
admitted I was interested in her, my fingers crossed that she'd be open
to experimenting with fucking me and giving those tinted windows and
soundproofing some great use on one of Hartford's busiest expressways. </p>
<p>Her hands wandered ever further, my eyes shutting as she came that
much closer to realizing her friend and rival had nothing stopping her
from sliding elegant fingers up into me, and making my wildest wishes
come true. I watched the traffic, starting to pout as I saw it start to
clear up. Paris' digits drifted up into virgin territory, scratching my
skin with the same enthusiasm as my back hours before. I remember the
times I had gotten off just imagining her hands fingering a pencil
within my bed, thinking at the time it was such an odd thing to dream
of. I guess my mind got ahead of my touch though, because her fingers
against my thigh, shaking it too and fro? I could die a happy woman
right about there. </p>
<p>Though I would die a virgin, not knowing the pleasures of Paris'
tongue. Yeah, morbid thought I'm so not thinking again! </p>
<p>She was getting closer and closer, what would she have thought if
there was no trace of cotton and instead she ended up feeling the tangle
of the dark curls on my mound? Would she smile, laugh, cringe, and
think I was crazy for going without? Be appreciative that my natural
hair color was indeed brown? </p>
<p>"Uh, thank you Par, I appreciate all the rides you give me--and, uh,
those in the future," I spat out, feeling my crotch become slick and
wet. A few more inches and she'd know what her hand alone was causing in
me. "I promise I won't abuse your offer." </p>
<p><i>I certainly wouldn't mind giving <b>you</b> a ride Gellar!</i> I
suddenly thought, and it took all I had in order to gag what I felt was
a very loud moan forming in my larynx. What was up with us that
afternoon, me fucking myself in her shirt in the sacred space of the
darkroom and deciding that a pair of panties was wearing too much, then
Paris with her hands, it was like I was living some kind of romance
novel where we teased each other crazy! </p>
<p>I felt like I could come right there in her car and onto my skirt,
the heat from her fingers drifting up into my slit. I heard her say
there were no thanks necessary for the lifts home. She was so close to
my core I could almost taste it and sense the oncoming orgasm, I started
straightening myself up for the inevitable reception of her fingers
within as I imagined she whispered 'Let me show you how much I
appreciate you as more than a passenger Ror' into my ear, then closed
the distance between us and kissed me... </p>
<p>Then I saw her hand recede towards my knee. I was shocked and
struggling for breath as I lost her contact, almost on the verge of
tears. The traffic started speeding up and we had finally found an
opening, so Paris had no choice to bring her hand up from my thigh and
back onto the steering wheel, drifting down my leg towards my knee until
she wasn't making contact anymore. I was at the absolute edge of giving
it up, the balls of my feet right on the cliff and ready to fall into
her, but had been saved just in time no thanks to the help of the
Connecticut Highway Patrol in clearing up the rush hour mess. </p>
<p>I'm serious; I was ready to admit right then and there my interest
in her. But I had to keep it silent as the speedometer made it's way
back to a speedy 55. My virtue was still intact, though as I looked at
Paris keeping her eyes on the road, I honestly wished it wasn't. I never
thought my breasts could be so hard and my pussy so wet and wanting for
more, but I sat in the bucket seat, wet as could be and wishing I'd
have taken the risk. </p>
<p>My brain stirred into action the rest of the way, trying to figure
out ways to lure Paris into finishing what she started. Sleeping over at
my house? Not a good idea on a school night, and I don't know if I'd
want her and I to go back to school the next morning. Maybe I could take
her to the bridge and we could just talk? Judging the fact I would have
a sudden urge to shove her into the freezing cold water and ravish her
beneath the surface, not the best course of action. I knew I didn't
want her to leave, but I had to let go sometime that day. After all, I
still had to see Dean and Jess and get some last moments with my mom
before she went the town of Music Row and the Grand Ole Opry until
Sunday evening. Oh, and I still was bound to Dean. Probably wouldn't
appreciate seeing me make out with Paris when I still had his bracelet
on my arm. </p>
<p>She finally pulled into my driveway around 5:40, and I didn't even
realize it. My body was cold and numb from the air conditioning and
thoughts enflamed, and I had made an indent in my lower lip from biting
down on it so far. Not to mention I was sure the back of my skirt
probably had a slight dark spot in back that would show off the effects
of Paris' almost-fingering of me. </p>
<p>"Rory," she said, shaking my shoulder. "We're home." </p>
<p>I widened my eyes and saw the familiar blue abode I've come home to
for six years. "Sorry," I said, trying to normalize my thoughts, "I was
really into this book." </p>
<p>Paris then smirked at me, and my excuse fell apart like a popsicle
stick bridge with a sumo wrestler crossing it. "So into it you've been
reading the last page for fifteen minutes, I think you've analyzed it to
the point of exhaustion." </p>
<p>"I guess, I'm just tired, stupid traffic," I lied, and she didn't
seem to press. I seemed to lose my attention. </p>
<p>"You're OK then?" she asked, and I felt words on the tip of my
tongue that would invite her to come into my house. I didn't want to get
up, but I unbuckled the seat belt anyway, despite the fact I didn't
want her to go. </p>
<p>I was falling for her, her voice sounding so sweet to my ears, and
her nose, I just wanted to bend over and give her a kiss goodnight right
on the tip of it. I wasn't even out of her sight and missing her. But I
got out of the car and grabbed my things, ready to be alone in my
unhappy relationship with Dean once again. </p>
<p>I told her I'd see her tomorrow, hopeful she caught the hint I
wanted to see her at 7:35, the moment I walked into that building. She
then joked about what got me into that whole situation, Dwight. She
laughed when I said I'd wear a raincoat while I watered, and it caught
in my ears. It's rare to hear her laughing at a joke, she's usually a
Daria-like cynic who usually keeps her giggle to herself. When she
laughs though, it's more of a nervous guffaw, and doesn't sound like her
voice at all. She smiles too, and I recycle her sexy laugh into my
memory banks, hopeful that I'll get to hear it from her in the future
many more times. </p>
<p>The way I feel about her is something like I've never felt before.
We say goodbye and I walk onto the porch, turning around just in time to
see her squeal her tires and peel out of the driveway back onto Cherry
Lane, as I watched her car fade on the gravel road leading to downtown.
I squint and still make out her HVD-BND license plate as she stopped at
Peach Street a block down. She turned on her right turn signal, and my
heart tightened up as she turned towards downtown and out of my life
for the next fourteen hours. </p>
<p>"Goodnight Paris, and sweet dreams," I whisper to myself as I walk
into the house and get into my usual afterschool routine. Thanking God
that Lorelai dropped off an entire clean outfit with bra and panties so
that I wouldn't have to stay without, I jumped into a very cold shower
and got back into my pedestrian 'I love Dean, he's the only one for me'
mind track that was so hollow I could hear a woodblock in the background
signaling what I really thought about him. Certainly after going
through an afternoon like that where thoughts of Paris made me come one
and a half times (half for the almost-orgasm in her car), Dean's record
was truly pale now. </p>
<p>Speaking of whom, when I went to Luke's, came in once I got settled
in and immediately when on this insane streak of accusations that I
struggled to explain away as a total accident. He started out with the
fact his friend had seen everything going on between Jess and I when we
were trying to turn off the sprinklers at Dwight's. I tried calmly and
rationally to explain that no, I didn't decide to suddenly have a wet
t-shirt contest with Jess as the judge, and we're going to be friends
and nothing but that. </p>
<p>He got overly defensive then, and Dean was seriously starting to
scare me. As I kept my cool, he kept making all these accusations that I
was a whore and going behind his back and dating Jess. Trying to point
out the fact I felt it was bad form to date someone who already had a
girlfriend proved fruitless, and Shane and Jess came downstairs to
wonder what the ruckus was as he tried to assert his ownership over me.
He kept calling me his, and the worst of the tendencies that kept me on
my toes when we were in the courtship and renewal phases of our
relationship were out there for me to see. </p>
<p>I also made it clear that I was very unhappy with him because his
idea of romance was so boring it put me to sleep. Telling me that he was
afraid my mother would kill him wasn't a valid excuse, and considering
my burgeoning feelings for Paris, he certainly wasn't making a good
case for why I shouldn't change teams. </p>
<p>Finally, I had enough. I told him I was sick of all the accusations
and his Lifetime movie boyfriend imitation, so I felt that it was time
to end the relationship. I told him we were through and if he couldn't
handle the fact Jess was my friend that he could have a nice life
without me. Losing his girlfriend to whom he thought was in his words 'a
homewrecker', he made his way around me to try to get at Jess. Cesar,
who had brought my supper out on a plate, leaped over the counter and
restrained Dean just in time, and Jess kept his cool, nary making a
movement towards my now ex-boyfriend and telling him that if he
couldn't behave, Luke and him would be more than happy to beat him up
for me. Before Dean left, he tried one more time to explain his side of
things, but I was overly pissed off at him about the reaction he had to
the sprinkler incident. Until he matured and set his priorities
straight, I told him not to see me anymore. I was so mad in fact, I
swore at him and told him to fuck off, and then called him a dickhead in
the heat of the moment. I would like to say I'd like to take it back,
but for right now he needs to stay away from me as I try to build this
thing up with Paris, I'm not ready to get into a love triangle with
Paris, a girl who's building towards becoming my true love, and Dean,
who was my first love, but ready to move on from. </p>
<p>As he prepared to leave, Jess got Dean's attention, and made me
laugh as he reminded Dean that Shane and he were in love and that he
should've taken my sexual cues and ran with them even though we wouldn't
have sex. </p>
<p>"If I had a girl like Rory," he claimed "I would've already made her
come so many times you'd be nothing but a silly childhood fling. You
missed out man, and now she's leaving you, just as I've always predicted
she'd always do. Idiot." Jess shook his head and Dean bit his lip,
somehow controlling himself from saying something he might regret. He
turned around, walked out of the door, and out of my life as I had knew
it before then. </p>
<p>After talking to Shane and Jess in the diner for just over an hour
and a half about things not involving fighting robots and cars, but
instead what we knew well, books and music, I walked home and got into
my relaxation mode, feeling not one bit guilty about my actions that
evening, nor did I want to wallow. Dean was fine as a first love, but in
the end, he just wasn't a good enough boy to become my one and only. I
changed into my pajamas shortly after getting back, and did my
homework, waiting for Mom to come home. She did around ten, and once she
walked in, I could tell that she knew since she brought in a gallon of
vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. </p>
<p>"Hey hon," she said as she leaned against the door. "Need to do some
wallowing before you shove off to bed and I leave you all alone to fend
for yourself the next five days?" </p>
<p>I turned around and smiled at her, appreciating her gesture despite
the fact I didn't need it. "I'll take the ice cream, but I won't be
wallowing, this time it's for real. I'll be burning the Dean box one of
these days and there will be no more tears shed over him." </p>
<p>I then came out to the living room and cuddled on the couch with my
mom with a big bowl of hot fudge as she vented about how horrible
hotelier's conventions usually are, while I told her about what led to
the end of Dean as my boyfriend (again, no details on my love for Paris,
got to keep those hush-hush for now). We had fun discussing the good
and mostly bad of the relationship, and it felt good to finally talk
out my frustrations over the last two years. Mom seemed to be more
relieved than shocked, though a side benefit of our relationship was to
be totally lost. </p>
<p>"There's only one thing I hate about this Rory," she told me
seriously, frowning. </p>
<p>"What's that?" </p>
<p>Lorelai faked a cry. "We're never going to drink water again, are
we?" She looked forlornly towards the water cooler, formerly changed by
Dean in the kitchen, and I laughed at what she was getting at. Even if I
could get Paris, there was <b>no way</b> she'd ever change the Culligan
bottle. She couldn't even try, what with her 'jugs' and all getting in
the way of the water jug. </p>
<p>I immediately had a brainstorm. "We can always buy a Brita pitcher.
Or you can hire Luke for the water-changing duties, either's fine."
Taking care of my mother's love life by adding on chores to Luke's list
seems like a good idea. But my mom's still not taking the bait. </p>
<p>"Brita pitcher it is, I think I've favored poor Lukey out." We then
had a nice 'evil boyfriends being murdered in cold blood by
ex-girlfriends out for revenge' theme night thanks to Lifetime's movie
channel until I finally got worn out, and we both went to bed around two
in the morning. </p>
<p>I only had four hours of sleep that night, but they were all
wonderful hours. Without the complications of a boyfriend in the picture
now, my dreams were free to go a lot further with scenarios with Paris
and I. That evening into morning, I had a very wonderful dream where
Paris and I sat down together and read through our old yearbooks,
getting to know each other and what we did as we grew up. I have read
through the yearbooks of our class from all the way back in their
Chilton Country Day days all the way to junior year. It's sad to note
that each year starting with kindergarten, Paris' cute six year-old
wide-toothed grin seemed to fade to a flat frown as she grew up, it was
like watching a flipbook of love being sucked out by her mother's
influence. </p>
<p>When I got up the next morning, I was in a fine mood, but wondering
how I'd bring up the fact I was now loveless to Paris that day. I wanted
to tell her as soon as possible, but I couldn't just say 'Hey Paris, I
dumped Dean.' After I watered Dwight's garden (with Jess keeping a close
eye on the sprinkler system to prevent a repeat of the day before), I
got on the bus and spent all of it thinking about what to do. The driver
was still pissed about my conduct Tuesday morning, but Window Guy was
thankfully very absent, and I was grateful that I was back in my
regular underwear, not about to have a temptation to repeat the
lunchtime orgasm of the day before. </p>
<p>There was also the issue of the dance marathon to think about for
Saturday into early Sunday morning. Winning the trophy has always been a
goal of my mom's, and as the years passed in turn, it became de facto
for me to try to win it. Though last year Dean didn't last five hours
(there's a reason we never went to a dance after the 2000 Winter Formal,
and that's because he's awful at the fast dances), I really wanted to
win the trophy and beat Kirk. When she heard that the convention fell
on the same weekend as the marathon, she was mad and trying to talk
Michel into going instead. After about the fifteen iteration of a
profane French sentence from her co-worker however, Lorelai realized
that it was going up to me to represent the Gilmores this year all by
myself. </p>
<p>I stayed silent throughout the day, miming it up except when Paris
asked me something as I imagined what it would be like to spend an
entire twenty-four hours with her in my arms, dancing at all speeds.
There was the hormonal challenge of keeping my feelings in check going
on, and the added factor of dealing with the fact she usually shied away
from public activities. She was supposed to come out the night I did as
a debutante, but never came because as I found out later, she hid out
at the Harford library claiming that her debutante dress had caused a
rash to develop on her back and she had a sudden case of laryngitis
onsetting. Mrs. Gellar gave up on her daughter coming out, and that
left a burning question unanswered; would Paris have brought a flask of
bourbon with her to the bash and tried to outdrink Libby in order to
avoid the whole experience, yet still participate? She's a very light
drinker, yet I know she would've soaked herself in booze I feel in
order to keep the memories of the fan dance out of her head. </p>
<p>From her old dance tapes however, I knew she still had some talent
within her languishing for six years, and even if she wasn't at peak
form she could still probably outdance Kirk. I was about average when it
came to dancing, but then again I did play a pretty aggressive field
hockey game the month before, surprising myself. Surely Paris could help
get me into the swing of things. </p>
<p>Neutrality was the order of the day. I was already worried that if I
did ask her, she'd come out against it right away and wonder why I'd
invite her to a dance a day after I broke up with Dean. Not only that
she'd probably analyze the fact that a girl was asking another girl to
dance with her for twenty-four hours. </p>
<p>That made me chicken out for a bit. <i>You don't need the trophy,
this is too much too soon,</i> I thought to myself realistically. I was
just coming from an off-on two-year relationship and trying to make
Paris fall for me would confirm that I was a sucker for commitment. </p>
<p>Then again, as I looked at her in lunch (fixating on her ear, don't
ask), when did I ever think about boys before Dean, if at all? I
remembered back to when I was ten, and discovered the pleasures of
masturbation and sexual attraction in general on a very hot July night
in my bed. The air conditioning was broke and all the fans in the world
couldn't keep the house cool, so I slept in my bed nude but for my
panties. I had gone to the pond earlier that day to cool off with Lane,
and saw a girl I remembered from my fifth grade class, Tracy McCarran. </p>
<p>Looking back, I had no ideas of the boundaries between boys and
girls, that girls were meant to mate with boys and were expected to
never have a sexual thought about another girl. Tracy however...it made
me flush and feel funny when I saw her jump into the pond and come near
me to say hi. She was an early bloomer, so she took advantage of her
growing body by wearing a two-piece that was conservative enough for
Stars Hollow,</p>
