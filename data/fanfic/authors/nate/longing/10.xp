<chapter title="Chapter 8: And Then Rory Kissed Me... - Part 2">
As I tried to analyze my chances with Rory to death, I suddenly heard
that sweet voice that made me go weak coming into the kitchen. Apparently
she was back from wherever she went and had noticed one of her notebooks
had gone missing.<br/>

<br/>

The notebook was in my hand, clutched in a death-grip, the smudges of my
fingerprints from running it through the print all over the pages. I
gasped in horror, like I was afraid she was going to find out about her
dark secret. <i>She probably doesn't share any actual feelings for
you</i>, I thought to myself, trying to cover up the lust I had with
denial once again.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Paris?&quot; She called my name again, her voice seeming to sort of
strain. I figured I couldn't just escape out the window and flee with her
notes, so I got up from the bed and walked out of the room, showing my
face to her.<br/>

<br/>

I had the notebook by the end of the spiral, trying to decide whether to
let her know I knew about the list. I put on a face of indifference,
trying to clue her in that I did not know a thing. I figured she might
want to tell me first.<br/>

<br/>

<i>If ever</i>, my cynical conscience nagged. I came out of the room, to
the sight of Rory in that same tank top she wore to bed, only on the
bottom, blue jeans trimmed to her slim figure instead of the pajama
pants.<br/>

<br/>

Without much aplomb I handed over the notebook and asked where she had
been. She told me she had been up after one in order to get a bite to eat
and called into Joe's for some subs and food, explaining how the food had
appeared on the kitchen table when I got up, also asking the guy from
Joe's to pick up those Sunday newspapers.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;When I finished my lunch though, I was still kind of tired, so I
wanted to get a couple more hours of rest. But you looked to be so
comfortable in my bed alone, I didn't want to disturb you. Instead of
crawling back into my bed and waking you up, I slept upstairs in my mom's
room for the last two hours.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Oh, OK.&quot; I was happy to hear she hadn't left the house, but
kind of distracted. <i>Oh dear, that exposed belly, why God, why did you
have to make her look even more sexy than she usually does? </i>Why was I
thinking those thoughts about her, I was more intelligent than this. For
the love of Pete...<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You OK?&quot; She seemed concerned about my lack of wordplay. I was
keeping myself on short sentences; scared I'd say the wrong thing.
&quot;I know it was shocking winning the dance marathon,
but...&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Somehow after this we sat at the kitchen table, and had a conversation
about the dance, and how my feet still seemed sore from the endeavor. I
tried not to look at her, but couldn't help it because the soft vanilla
perfume she wore the day before was still barely detectable around her
neck. Her luscious and slender neck, which was fully exposed for me to
take in. We were separated by four feet, so there were no temptations to
befall me.<br/>
<br/>

But oh God, still no bra to be found, and the height of the Gilmore
kitchen table was lower than most I was familiar with. She made an
animated point about what Kirk and Carrie did wrong in their performance,
and to tell you the truth, I wasn't listening. My eyes were drawn towards
her chest, and as her hands waved around, her breasts seemed to sort of
bounce. Not bouncing like an exotic dancer mind you, but with the
thinness of those straps holding the barely-there shirt on her, I was
imagining that after a couple more sharp movements of her arms up and
down, the strap on one of the sides would break from the stitch holding
it together, fluttering down and giving me more of a view of Rory than I
expected. My thoughts continued to drive towards impureness at a good
clip, my eyes wishing the Gilmores spent extra for a glassed-top table so
I could get a good look at her legs. Ever since she shunned the hose I
can't help but gape at them out of the corner of my eye when I'm driving
her home. Not as smooth as mine are, but they still felt good in my
hands.<br/>

<br/>

The conversation almost seemed to be an afterthought as I realized as I
was doing to Rory with my glances in her direction, she was doing the
same to me. I was wearing a big flannel shirt, but it still exposed alot
of skin in the front from being unbuttoned. As I said something about
Mrs. Kim's unegged sandwiches, her baby blues seemed to cut a laser line
down from the bottom of my chin, her mouth opening in amazement as I bent
down a bit. She was staring at me so blatantly, but once I noticed the
movement of her pupils...She switched right back to booksmart innocent
Lorelai Leigh, with not a smutty or lesbianic thought in her body.<br/>

<br/>

It seemed like we were doing a dance once again; only this time we were
sitting down and had three feet of an oak-walnut mix separating us. She'd
look, I'd look. Occasionally my bared toes would find her ankle and brush
up against it, and then within the space of a couple minutes I found one
of her feet, nails painted bright red and signifying the legend that
underneath that ing e fa e she kept at school there was a bad girl
lurking within her, against the bottom portion of my shin. It took all I
had not to pray that damned foot would happen to find its way between my
legs and end up against the red wine-colored silk of my already dampened
panties.<br/>

<br/>

My breath shortened and I felt like my heart would take leave of my
chest. I just looked at her with so much want I wanted to throw that
table into a corner and show her that I knew what she had in the back of
that notebook currently in the center of the table. She had set it right
back down and we went right back to talking, so I was wondering why if
she needed her notes so bad, she wasn't getting to work.<br/>

<br/>

I was scared to come right out with what I had read in the book, and to
let her know that. There was just this nagging feeling in the back of my
head that she would take that as an invasion of her privacy and never
speak to me again, and I wouldn't want to lose her friendship in that
sort of abrupt way. We kept up the nervous chat throughout the remainder
of the afternoon as the sunlight in the living room started to fade out
and become overtaken with twilight.<br/>

<br/>

We had moved to the living room after I finished my bag of chips, and I
had made sure to bring the notebook with me, her attention to it lost. I
felt myself shake with each look she directed towards me, and I felt
guilty, like I was reading about the dark lesbian-crush holding side that
Rory had never shown.<br/>

<br/>

She stretched out across the couch in a laying position as I sat in the
chair with my hands having a death grip on the blue notebook. I had never
been so scared to bring up something in my life, and I debated with my
conscience whether to let her know what I felt. My stomach was
somersaulting from the girl two feet away from me, curled up in an afghan
and making my mouth dry at how much I could imagine a scene of both of us
under that blanket in the future...<br/>

<br/>

I was ready to burst out my feelings for her right then and there. But I
didn't need a scared Rory on my hands, God forbid I have a repeat of
Dean's first 'I love you' scene where she scurries away from me in shock.
<i>Just ease your way into it Gellar</i>, I told myself. <i>Just think of
it as flirting that doesn't end because you don't want to reveal
anything</i>.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Ror?&quot; I started out. I smiled at her and tried to ease her
into a conversation by asking if she was interested in any men lately.
This would give me a good clue into her intentions, as I was sure her
breakup with Dean wasn't something abrupt.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Not really, with all these tests and quizzes there's really not
much time to find time to date.&quot; Considering Rory had strung along
Caveman for two years and kept her GPA above four despite, her quote
seemed like a bullshit excuse.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I mean is there any guy out there you've had an inkling
about?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Nope, not really. Every other girl's fawning over the guys on the
football team, but I can't stand them. As for the other boys in
Chilton...&quot; she faked a yawn. &quot;Boring seems a proper term to
describe them.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Really, not one guy?&quot; Now I felt I was on the right track.
&quot;What about Brad?&quot; Yeah, like she'd want him, but it would cut
any tension that was in the questioning.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;With the way Madeline moons over him, she has dibs on him. Besides,
he's not really my type by any means.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;So you've noticed the looks she's been giving him?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Looks? Par, when we came out of fifth period on Thursday she
stumbled over a trash can looking at Brad with googly eyes! Plus have you
noticed how many times he passes our lunch table on Maddy's side every
day, I'm thinking some brushing of the shoulder with his hand is involved
there.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Uh, not really, to be honest,&quot; I answered. Really, Madeline
and Brad's dance had gone unnoticed to my eyes, considering Rory's close
proximity to myself everyday from 12:10 to 12:45pm at the lunch table.
Nothing could take me out of the catatonic state of eating and occasional
staring I was in at that time of day, not even if those two unknowing
lovebirds took everything off and mated right on the table, I'd probably
still be mooning over Rory.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;There was that one boy in Lane's band you told me about yesterday,
Dave Rygalski? From the way you describe him he sounds
perfect.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Yeah, for Lane. He's also not my type, I don't usually have a thing
for musicians.&quot; Again with the mystery surrounding her. &quot;He
seems dead set on her anyways, I can tell by the way he's trying to
impress Mrs. Kim by playing the Jesus card.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Impression through religion; sounds like Kim has herself a
keeper.&quot; We both laughed for a bit, and I asked her again if she was
interested in anyone, just to make sure. She nodded vigorously a no to
this, but I did notice she seemed a little distracted by something,
namely the wide expanse of skin along my neck.<br/>

<br/>

I was starting to get even more butterflies fluttering through my belly
than I did when I discovered the list. There was a building sense that I
had to tell her, and though I wanted to tell her after about a week of
rehearsal of going through the motions, maybe invite her out to dinner,
there was no better opportunity then that moment to my mind. It was
blunt, usually unforgiving, and took no prisoners as I would suddenly say
something to throw a competitor off track.<br/>

<br/>

Leave it to my unbalanced self, with Sharon's chromosomes floating around
inside, to just lay everything out on the table.<br/>

<br/>

I called for her attention, and she probably expected me to bring
something up like a school subject.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Rory?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Hmm?&quot; She was still cheerful and at ease.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You know how I said that I wasn't interested in Tristan
romantically anymore last night, even if he were to come
back?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

A nod. &quot;Yeah, I remember.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Then did you notice why I didn't really take to Jamie like you
thought I would back in Washington?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Another nod. &quot;Yes, I'm sorry you didn't match up well--&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I interrupted her, and made my way over to the couch, asking her to move
over and continuing to hold the notebook. She seemed a little nervous
about why I was dragging it along like a teddy bear, and I prepared for
the worst.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Well, there's sort of a reason those things didn't end up working
out in the end, especially with Jamie.&quot; My mouth was drying as I
watched Rory and her body language start to tighten, which took me out of
the element of the conversation.<br/>

<br/>

I remember thinking there that I couldn't do it, admit that I was the way
I was. I looked into Rory's eyes, nervous about what to say. So many
parts of me were telling me to back out of this and just lie through my
teeth. The portion of myself against this was already formulating
something involving a kissing booth at the Winter Formal with both of us
as the paid prostitutes...ahem, receivers of $1 kisses for the entire
night, hopeful I'd find a spark with one of the guys in Chilton.<br/>

<br/>

No matter what I tried to think though, I couldn't lie to Rory. There was
no way in hell I was going to keep the fact that I feel electricity, not
just mere sparks, when she's near. Another reasoning is that even if it's
just a hand to her hand, my day isn't complete with at least one instance
where we touch each other. In years and years with Tristan I never felt
anything close to wanting to touch him to fill a void.<br/>

<br/>

Once I'd admit to her, she wouldn't be just an innocent girl I lusted
after. She would know that I was interested in her, and she could
construe the reading of my notes as an invasion of her privacy. It might
be just a phase to her even if I did admit and within days she'd be
pining for a new boy coming into Chilton, just like those twists that
happen in teen dramas all the time...<br/>

<br/>

Lo and behold, the boy would take her away from me and I'd be forced to
relive the images of Rory kissing someone other than me. If Unknown New
Guy got her, I wouldn't have her, and that next relationship she might
have just might be the one where she decides it's time to truly rid
herself of the Mary label she's held since her first day.<br/>

<br/>

<i>You could be that one Paris</i>. There was that same voice who
challenged me in screaming my like for her aloud in the bathroom the day
before, just as Ms. LaCosta came into the room. <i>She thinks of you as a
challenge, and if you were to share this want for her, that might set up
more possibilities. You know you use the small bits of anger she displays
as a guide to her emotions, and that part of her along with the innocent
tease...you wouldn't keep your hands off her.<br/>

</i><br/>

My face started flushing red, it was always tough imagining a wanting
Rory when she was right in front of me, looking at me wide-eyed and
asking me what was wrong for not saying more.<br/>

<br/>

She took my hand, threading her fingers between mine and telling me that
whatever was on my mind, I could tell her.<br/>
<br/>

I sucked all the willpower I could, took a deep breath and spread it
through my lungs, and just went full tilt after putting on a strong face
betraying my emotions.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I need you to keep this in complete confidence Gilmore,&quot; I
told her, sternly. &quot;I've only trusted this to Fran so far, and she's
kept what I have to tell you to herself for so long I'm surprised she's
been this resilient. If you do find yourself uncomfortable with this,
please just go to your room without any vocalized judgment, I'll leave
quietly.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

A pause, then a soft OK from her. I had already thought about this long
enough, and with her hand in mine, I didn't want to essay my coming out,
summarizing it like a review from <i>People </i>seemed to be the best
course of action. Another deep breath, and here it went...<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I, I...uhh, well you see...&quot; So much for copying Ellen's
simple declaration that 'Yep, I'm gay', because those words weren't
coming. I found myself iced and not able to spit it out, afraid of the
impact of the words on the girl in front of me. It seemed like I'd never
be able to say it, and I'd fall back on the 'set me up with a guy
excuse'.<br/>

<br/>

In the paralyzed state I fell into however, what I couldn't say with my
words, could easily be vocalized with my body. I found my other hand
taking Rory's free one, and her concentration seemed shaken. She was
putting on the same strong front as I was, and inching a little closer to
me on the sofa.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Whatever it is, it's OK,&quot; she said with a soothing voice, her
jeaned leg almost seeming to press up against my bare one. She released
her grip on one of my hands, and started moving it up my arm, leaving
goosebumps in the wake. I saw something in her eyes I had only seen
precious few times within.<br/>

<br/>

Determination.<br/>

<br/>

Her hand moved up and up the flannel of the shirt, but to me it seemed
like a layer of heavy cotton wasn't between her fingers and my skin. She
seemed to suck her lips back into her mouth, and though my eyes were
concentrating on those deep blues of hers, I could feel all my senses
going off.<br/>

<br/>

Her soft, angelic face wasn't like it ever had been before, so close to
mine as that hand brushed against my shoulder. Her eyes were moving
closer and closer towards mine, and I couldn't help but feel a
shudder.<br/>

<br/>

I weakly tried to ask what her motives were with a strained out
&quot;Rory?&quot;, and felt like my brain state was reverting back to
infancy as I lost all thought. Her index finger in my hand ran against
the curve of my lifeline. I looked down, the intimacy of the gesture
becoming clear as I clung to the blue book as if she would find out about
what I was going to tell her involving my sexuality.<br/>

<br/>

My fear was unfounded as the distance between us, which seemed to have
been inches, turned into centimeters. Rory was so close to me that I
could smell a sweet mix of that same Aqua Fresh she always brushed with,
combined with the taste of a toffee vanilla cup of coffee.<br/>

<br/>

One last chance to vocalize, let this blue-eyed, small town girl know
that I'm interested...<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Um, never mind actually.&quot; I thought I was confessing, but I
was freezing up on her instead as I didn't tell her a thing. I was
looking at her with all the reverence I could muster, and instead of
stating that simple two or three word declaration, I was shying away,
turning myself stone cold once again.<br/>

<br/>

I expected Rory to back off, move onto awkward banter revolving around
the topic 'So how 'bout those Blue Demons?'. Not like I know how they
were doing, I was too focused Friday night on preparing to wow Rory to
the dance marathon title rather than chilling my fingers off in the
bleachers of Archauer Stadium hoping the football team would get into the
CIAC playoffs and keep circ numbers up for the next two weeks.<br/>

<br/>

I didn't look at her, staring down at my hands like a little girl lost. I
knew how Rory felt, and how I felt for her, but she probably would
consider the relationship an experiment instead of taking it seriously.
She was her mother's daughter after all, and said mother bounces between
so many guys in a year you can tell she still hasn't found that <i>a
</i>in the 18 years since she was sixteen.<br/>

<br/>

She kept her hand in mine however, and said my name to bring my attention
back towards her. Rory was in no mood to have me back off, and made that
clear with her firm tone of voice.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Paris, no.&quot; I brought my gaze up towards her, and found her
eyes take on that stern unflinching look that was but second nature to
me. &quot;If it's serious enough that you'd want to keep it secret from
everyone else, I want to know. I promise I won't tell anybody, because
that's what friends do.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<i>But this friend is about to shatter your entire view of her</i>, I
mused to myself with my heart picking up its rhythm. I remained stubborn
and told her it was something small that didn't need to be
microanalyzed.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I don't care if you're about to tell me you slept with Jamie and
you're pregnant with his child, I want to know what's bothering
you!&quot; She was still firm, and what she said just about shocked
me.<br/>

<br/>

I flared red and immediately denied that I wouldn't have bedded that
boring dullard if I was <i>Indecent Proposal</i>'ed by him with a large
cash payment involving a suitcase to do so.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Well thank God for that.&quot; She kind of smirked at me, running
that finger through my lifeline. I felt my forehead coat with a layer of
perspiration and my face flush. Everything wanted me to yell that I was a
lesbian, but I didn't want to. My heart needed to remain shielded from
the eventual torrent of vitriol that was sure to come from her if I
admitted my feelings. &quot;You know me though, whatever it is I'm a
lousy gossip, so I won't spread this through the school,
promise.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

It was then explained to her that she would never understand my
confession, and that it was too wrenching to let out. I couldn't let her
know that I wanted her hopes and wishes in that notebook to come true
because that would be weak.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You don't think I'd understand?&quot; Rory's voice picked up a
little. &quot;You don't think that I would ever understand your little
problem. For crissakes Paris, I've lived a life that I would love to give
you myself, yet I'd love to be able to edit out certain parts, like the
first three years where my mother, fresh out of her sophomore year at
Hillside was shamed out of Hartford and the lives of my grandparents
because she didn't take the trip to Planned Parenthood like all good
little pregnant Hartford upper-crust teenage girls do!&quot;<br/>

<br/>

She stood up, and in a way that made me want to keep notes on how she'd
ad-lib in a debate, continued. &quot;You know what my first address after
I turned one was? There wasn't one because my mom raised me until after
my terrible twos in a garden shed at the Inn, next to the pond! It was
heated, it had a TV, a bed, a couch, and a bassinet, but not much else.
Then we went from apartment to apartment over the next seven years in and
around Stars Hollow, as Lorelai worked 14 hour days at the Independence
trying to earn just enough so we could buy this nice house in a nice
neighborhood and I wouldn't have to ever worry again about having to
explain to my few friends why I lived upstairs from a bookstore! Those
friends abandoned me once junior high started once they learned in sex ed
that teenage pregnancy was something to be ashamed of, and that despite
my mother getting her own house at the age of 27, she wasn't to be looked
at as a good role model. That when I learned that Lane was a true friend
and would never, ever judge me for what I am and what I've come from. I
had no friends except her though seventh until tenth grades, you know how
that felt?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Oh God, I was making her break down; this wasn't a Rory I was familiar
with, being human and infallible. &quot;One of the reasons I kept putting
in an application for Chilton year after year was that everyone at Hollow
Jr. High and the high school always made me feel that no matter what I
did, no matter how much I kept my grades up, I wasn't to be spoken to, I
was the child of shame. Yeah, the older people in this town I grew up
around think I'm the best thing to ever happen to this hamlet, but the
schools here are as cutthroat, if not more, than Chilton ever could be,
kids are so ass-backwards in this town when it comes to tolerance. So I
did the schoolwork as hard as I could, poured my energy into everything,
kept myself up through their taunts, just so I could have a shot at going
to your school. And when I was able to attain it, I was relieved, so
damned happy I could escape that school and stop being so shy and
withdrawn. But when my mom learned she'd never had enough for tuition,
she went kicking and screaming back to her parents, desperate for any
help. I wouldn't want to have to ever be in her shoes, hoping for the
best and the least contact possible with those two whose wishes she
defied for so long.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

She slid back onto the couch and held my hand tight, continuing to vent,
and I was powerless to stop her. She poured out two years of frustration
of who I was and how she's been trying to figure out how I can have such
a kind heart at some times, but most of the times act like such an iron
bitch to her and everyone else. She told me it was fine to do it to
fellow Chiltonians; they were just as bad, if not worse than those in
Stars Hollow towards her. She kept asking about why I'm so vexing when it
comes to our friendship. God, just seeing Rory in this condition was
wearing on me. I understood Rory the Scholar, Rory the Golden Child just
fine. But as I know too well, it's hard keeping up a fa e for such a long
period of time, and there was still facets of her that not even her
mother, and in turn best friend, has no idea about.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You don't know how much I hold in at times Paris,&quot; Rory said
to me as our eyes met again. &quot;When I broke up with Dean on Tuesday
night, there was so much I wanted to say and call him on, he was never
the right one for me. I mean I kept this thing up for two years that we
had, and I did love him for a time. But really, since the play a year
ago, I stayed with him more out of the necessity of saying 'I have a
boyfriend' rather than being unhitched.&quot; She crimped her forehead
and seemed frustrated as she inhaled and exhaled deeply for a bit.
&quot;I never, ever took a risk with him, and my mind kept trying to
think of ways to say I want more from Dean. I just could never feel
comfortable around him and his life, and to be honest, I never could
picture lasting through college with that guy when I couldn't even think
about him watching me from the spectator's section at
graduation.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Her hand wrapped around mine tighter as I tried to reassure her that
things would work out, and holding my tongue, told her that she'd find
Mr. Right eventually.<br/>

<br/>

I thought the talk would move on to droller subjects after I said that,
and that we'd move on from the topic not brought up yet about my sexual
orientation.<br/>

<br/>

Well color me pink and call me Piggly Wiggly, because that wasn't how
things ended up at all. She looked up at me, eyes wide, as her other hand
moved towards the one I was using to hold the notebook. There was that
determined look on her face, along with a bit of caution in her features
and tightened body language.<br/>

<br/>

Rory spoke softly, trying to slowly bring back up the discussion.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I understand there's probably a Mr. Right for me out there
somewhere, and at Chilton, a Mr. Right Now.&quot; A smile and a laugh for
both of us for the nervous joke. &quot;The problem is...&quot; She took
the notebook from my somewhat loosened grip, set it in her lap, then took
my left arm by the wrist. &quot;What if wanted a <b>Miss</b>
Right?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<i>She didn't say that to me, did she?</i> That was my reaction as I
found myself strangely surrounded by her words.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;A Miss Right?&quot; I repeated for her, numbed.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Yes, a Miss Right,&quot; Rory parroted back. &quot;Over the last
few months, I have fallen out of love with Dean, but at the same time,
found myself in a strange predicament where my dreams revolved around
another woman rather than him. After a few more of those, and trying to
compare and contrast this seemingly unnatural feeling, I connected the
dots, crossed the T's, and weighed all the evidence of my relationship
with Dean with that of my past encounters with guys. Looking at all that,
I realized there was no spark to Dean and I, and in turn I never found
myself drawn to boys in general.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Trying to stay in denial mode that I was that 'another woman', I tried to
keep the debate strong. &quot;But Jess, you were interested in him for
awhile, I mean you skipped school that one day to be in Manhattan just to
see him after the accident.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;There was lust there Par, but never love. When I kissed him at the
wedding, there was nothing there, no urge to go further than that. He's
more than a friend to me, but just in the male best friend sense. There's
too much there with him to deal with and I'm not going to pursue a
relationship with him just because I had a couple of sex dreams with
him.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I was nervous as I asked her to confirm her sexuality, with her hand
still in mine, and making me anxious and jumpy as all get out.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Well, that's the problem. I think I am...that, but maybe I can
still find a spark with a guy.&quot; She flailed her other hand out and
widened her eyes. &quot;What if it's just a phase, and I'm just thinking
this way because I figure I can't keep a boy in my life, so why don't I
rope in a girl and see how that goes. I mean I haven't shared this with
anybody, and I'm scared as hell because I'm expected to be the pride of
Stars Hollow and make 'em proud. The older people in this town revere me,
and what happens if I let them know that they'll have to lock up their
daughters instead of their sons, and I'm not this supposedly innocent
girl, because I have so many corrupted thoughts floating around in my
head, and oh God...&quot;<br/>

<br/>

She was starting to go on a babbling track that was starting to make her
seem unhinged, and I was saddened to see that my refusal to let her know
my secret was doing this to her. In this blur was the fact that she was
saying she was gay herself. My mouth was drying and words weren't coming
out because I didn't have any idea how to tell her that I was in the same
predicament, at least the way she was. Her hand seemed to be permanently
bonded to mine, and I saw her start to cry.<br/>

<br/>

<i>I don't want to see her sad</i>, I thought to myself. My heart was
breaking for her; only hours before we were celebrating a well-earned
victory. Now we were both on that couch, in the same boat, with about 95%
confirmation on my end that it was me she had been thinking about me in
those dreams she was having. It was that other 5%, the worry that she was
thinking of another girl altogether that was getting to me.<br/>

<br/>

It was time to get blunt and stop letting emotions cloud things up. I
felt the beating of her heart in her wrist, like Rory was running on
adrenaline. My throat tightened as I said her name and she brought her
attention back up, wiping the tears from her eyes with her fingers.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;These dreams you mentioned...&quot; My voice wavered, but somehow
stayed on track. &quot;Was I that other woman? Have you been uh, thinking
of me in more the terms of a lover than just a good friend?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

There, it was all out on the table for her to analyze. I was putting my
heart in the pot and hoping that the gamble would be worth it. She looked
into my eyes for a moment, trying to gather a smile, but failing to as
she expected the worst from me. She sort of blushed and then bit her lip
as her voice took on a soft timbre.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Paris,&quot; she told me. &quot;You've been carrying around the RN
notebook for the last forty-five minutes. I know your mind and how it
ticks, your curiosity is something I like about you.&quot; She then let
me know she put it on the bottom on purpose and hoped that I'd look at
it. &quot;I started that list all the way back in the beginning of
October, and it's far outpaced what I've ever liked about Dean. I kept
denying and denying my feelings, and I started feeling this way heavily
when we shared the Howard dorm through the summer. But it first took root
so long ago last year in a very small way...&quot; Rory wandered off, and
I was left in a stunned state.<br/>

<br/>

She had just told me that she was thinking about me in a way unlike what
I thought she did for at least a year. That I had been reading her
feelings perfectly for the last three months, was starting to bring me
into a euphoria I could've never believed I was feeling.<br/>

<br/>

I kept putting the words 'Rory' and 'gay' together in so many ways in my
mind as I felt my heart pound. I had many pictures of how I'd come out in
my mind, and some of her doing the same thing, but this situation, this
reality was so much different. This was us, the comfortable blank
silences, our minds filling those blanks with opinions and hope. This
wasn't something that could be rehearsed, because it was so raw and from
the heart.<br/>

<br/>

My eyes locked with hers one more time, and I felt so many conflicting
feelings float through. Do I tell her and go through with it, letting her
know that I feel the same? Or do I brush off her interest with a 'no
thank you', remaining in my own personal hell having to watch love pass
me by once again and hope there's another Rory Gilmore out there for
me?<br/>

<br/>

But there wasn't a chance I'd ever find her mind twin anywhere in this
world. The nervous mannerisms, unique coffee addiction, tendency to
ramble, along with her unique model-like looks in that body, I knew I'd
never find such a combination of wit and beauty anywhere else, excepting
132 Cherry Lane in Stars Hollow, Connecticut.<br/>

<br/>

My mind set things right before I could relent. <i>You're not going to
turn this down, right? I know you're a little afraid of things right now,
like reactions and getting used to calling Rory 'honey' instead of 'bane
of my existence', but this is so right, you know it. Just look at her
right now, those eyes raking you up and down like she wants nothing but
your lips on hers. Then take a look at what you're doing, between all
these moves to keep it all in, almost drooling mentally at her attire and
body.<br/>

</i><br/>

Which was true, I still was looking at her with lust through her
confession. That Rory was willing to take my heart and explained things
so rationally, gave me much more reason to fall for her. She wasn't just
in it for the curiosity; she actually thought of me as in tune with her,
understanding how she ticked.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;So,&quot; she mumbled out, again looking down at her hands.
&quot;Never tell me I'd never know how it feels to be you. I want to know
what you wanted to tell me, and even if it's something negative, I'll see
it through your viewpoint. This is a give and take friendship we have
Par, and I just gave the confession that I think of you as more than a
friend. I just hope you don't shut me out now that I said
that.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

More tears and sobbing from her after that, I couldn't handle seeing Rory
like this. I had to admit what I felt for her to keep any more pain from
befalling her.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Ror,&quot; I said calmly. She looked up as I brought my hand out of
hers and moved it across the bare freckled skin of her arm. She looked at
me with what seemed to be a mix of loss, hope, innocence and lust, her
blue eyes widened at my touch, mouth parted open.<br/>

<br/>

We were at the line, ready to breach it with my next words.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You just knocked me over with a anvil, because since last
year,&quot; I paused to wet my throat with a sip of tea. &quot;I've felt
the same way for you. Rory, I like you, in that romantic
sense.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I felt Rory stiffen immediately, sort of in shock and going into Willow
Rosenberg mode, where speech was slow to come and much stuttering ensued.
&quot;R-r-really? You, uh, do like me err, like that?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

That caused me to laugh, and I let her know that I had read every page of
that pro and con list, surprised as hell, yet elated, like I'd received a
G4 Mac with a 30&quot; monitor and 60GB iPod for a Hanukkah gift from my
father, that this was the best news I had ever read.<br/>

<br/>

It was time to confess; yet I wanted to keep some things secret so we
could have talking points later, so I didn't let her know the first hints
of the crush came at the Bangles concert or a few other things. I told
her how much being the emergency Romeo had affected me, and that there
were so many times I wanted to admit but events in both of our lives
interfered. I told her how I never even considered anyone else to be my
VP and that the summer in Washington to me was meant to find out if I
could handle living with her day in and day out, and in turn that she
might. I found it to be a success, and she told me the affirmative,
though letting me know that sometimes the sleep talking was a little odd
but in an endearing way.<br/>

<br/>

When I got to the night where I went out with Jamie from Princeton, I let
her know that I had no desire of continuing the relationship from the
moment we greeted each other, that I was thinking of her the whole night
and had the sense I was cheating on her despite no vocalization of our
feelings. Rory tried to assure me that she thought she was doing the
right thing, but I couldn't be mad at her for the setup. I took it as a
last gasp at falling for a boy, and the results of the experiment; a
dismal failure. She then told me she felt so alone that night, unable to
think of anything else while she kept her like for me hidden and tried to
use the setup and ensuing date to gag her feelings for another
girl.<br/>

<br/>

I admitted to being pleased with her wardrobe modification after the
hemline issue passed and that I enjoy every brush, touch and sly move to
get my attention, and I want more, much more than that.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;When I'm around you, I can't handle myself, academics are second to
you,&quot; I implored her. &quot;The moment I hung up the phone Tuesday
morning, I went from 'I can't wait to tackle that AE test', to 'I can't
wait to see Rory'. That's what you do to me Gilmore, and though I try to
push away, you've done all you could to show that you'll pull me back in.
I like your tenacity and your courage to pursue this further, and this
morning when we won...&quot; I wandered off again as she moved closer to
me, her hand resting on my thigh. My breath seemed to quickened, but I
continued on anyways &quot;When we won, there was a sense of
accomplishment that even with all our issues, we can come together and go
through something that in the minds of others, might seem amateur. I felt
good last night winning, and I loved it even more that I won with you at
my side.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Everything seemed to come together after that. Rory and I became
comfortable with the idea that we were attracted to each other as we
talked on and on about things such as the field hockey match and the boat
trip in Baltimore where she said she may have admitted had Jamie not
arrived on the scene.<br/>

<br/>

When she said that, I thought about how I may have reacted then. Probably
because of how public it was, it would've been ugly because we really
didn't know each other in the way we've been for the last three months.
Sure, I would've been happy, but back in July we would have acted on lust
instead of an actual foundation for a relationship. There was no bedrock
there; the bond we shared was still tenuous, like the cinder block
anchors of a mobile home in the eye of a hurricane. We <b>had </b>to know
each other more, become comfortable with inching out of our comfort zones
before Rory and I could even start thinking of a relationship.<br/>

<br/>

I know it in my heart; a relationship in Washington would've been a
catastrophe, an experiment gone wrong. No matter what storybook allusions
I held in those eight weeks, admission of my feelings at the foot of the
Jefferson Memorial or hers on the Inner Harbor ferry would have ended up
in disaster. She was still with Dean; I was still undecided on my
feelings.<br/>

<br/>

And that left another question on the tip of my tongue. Did she break up
with him, for me?<br/>

<br/>

Simple question asked, simple answer said. With a small smile, she
confirmed a suspicion that I had been thinking of since she asked me to
the marathon.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;The opportunity presented itself at the diner, and before I could
talk myself out of it with my usually large guilt complex, I broke up
with him. I didn't even plan to ask you to the dance marathon before
then, but once I got home, things started to fall into place.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I smiled back at her. &quot;Just to make sure of one more thing. The
sprinklers, that was totally unplanned, I mean that wasn't part of you
trying to tease me more, right?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

She shook her head no and grinned. &quot;That, my friend, was a happy
accident.&quot; We were unconsciously moving closer to each other, and
both feeling like the tension that had wound around the conversation was
gone. I was feeling sort of flirtatious, so I decided to correct
her.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Don't you mean girlfriend?&quot; I said, curling my finger across
the pulse point of her neck. We were both smiling like those sappy
couples you see in TV commercials, and I felt that way. She took it a
little seriously, as she should, but still was playful.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Is that what you want Par?&quot; She was smiling at me, and though
usually I'd analyze a life decision like that until I was blue in the
face, remembering that first entry in the pro/con list, there wasn't any
need for second-guessing.<br/>

<br/>

<i>I want her</i>, the list said in her cursive.<br/>

<br/>

<i>I want her</i>, my mind was telling me, Mother, my fellow students,
friends and family be damned.<br/>

<br/>

I told her that yes, I wanted things to be that way.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You're sure?&quot; she cautioned. &quot;Because once you and I
pursue this, nothing is going to be the same again. I just want to make
sure you know what you're getting into by getting into a relationship
like this.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Rory had a valid point; I had to make sure that this is what I wanted. I
wasn't just, as with a guy dipping a toe in the water and running far if
things didn't work out. This was my friend--no, my best friend that I was
pursuing. As she said in her notes there's a chance I could break her
heart or fall for someone else, male or female if things didn't work out
between us. Combine that with the volatile past we had, then what happens
if one of us finds some jealousy issues and tries to make too much out of
it. We'll fight, and the next time it might not be with anything but
wordplay.<br/>

<br/>

I looked at her for what would later be the last time as just my
'friend'. Her hand was intertwined between my fingers, and her face was
about 8&quot; away from mine, her lips glistening in the sunlight
filtering in from the windows. Her eyes were opened wide, and when I
brought my gaze down, her chest was looking very delectable to me. She
was curled up in the corner of the couch as if she was ready to read a
good book. That is, if she held one; the only thing she was reading with
her eyes was the realization that things were changing between us, and
that I wanted to be a willing participant.<br/>

<br/>

<i>Go for it</i>, my conscience implored. <i>You want to show Sharon that
you can face up to a challenge; this is a high five on the difficulty
scale! Sure, you like her, but to keep a relationship with a former enemy
so long, you're going to need more than luck to get this right.<br/>

<br/>

</i>I brought my free hand up to her face, finding a couple of stray
hairs hovering above her eyes that bugged a little. I used my fingertips
to brush sensually against her cheek, and then started to descend towards
her in expectation.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;100% sure of this Ror. If you knew how I thought about you over the
last few months, you might faint from an overload.&quot; I smiled at her
and her face lit up like a fully lit set of menorah candles, eyes widened
and following that hand on her face from below her cheek and towards her
right.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Well, uh...&quot; distraction again was working in my favor,
fragmenting her words. &quot;I bet my dreams match up pretty well,
considering all of what I told you and how it affected me.&quot; That
elicited a laugh from me, and I was curious a little bit, I felt my face
flare up in embarrassment.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;What am I like in these dreams?&quot; Unconsciously, I didn't even
know that Rory was moving closer to me and coming out of her little hovel
on the couch as I slid further down the sofa from her.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;The usual,&quot; she told me, the sensuality no longer covered up
as it had before by nervous hiding. &quot;You're dominant, assertive,
very territorial...&quot; I was jarred by the left arm of the sofa
hitting my upper back. Strange how Rory is somewhat the same in my
dreams, but in a more soft approach than I thought I was in hers.
&quot;However, you're still very sweet, concerned and dare I might
add...&quot; she brought down her voice to a soft whisper and her arms
started to wrap around my back. &quot;...cute.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<i>Stop making me blush, stop making me blush...</i>Pleas to myself to
keep things calm weren't working well and I started to feel like such a
sap. I told Rory that I don't do cute, never have, and never will.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You are right now though, and I'm not afraid to see it. Yesterday
you looked cute; two days before you also looked cute, and right now
you're too cute for any words.&quot; The way Rory was looking at me; like
a very tender steak. I started feeling warm and on edge, as if any sudden
movements would bring us into a passionate embrace of my doing.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Thanks, I guess.&quot; Her mouth was now mere inches from mine, and
my breathing reflex seemed to lose its ability to combine the task of
speaking with bringing oxygen to my lungs. &quot;You're the same, always.
I might even, uh, fathom to say...&quot; Another stilted deep breath.
&quot;...you look hot right now Rory.&quot; God, look at me there,
talking like I was describing the cute lead singer of the next great
band. That is if that singer happened to resemble Sheryl Crow. See, even
shallow with my secret crushes on women here!<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Hot?&quot; She questioned with a uncharacteristic smirk. &quot;I'll
take that as a compliment then, along with perhaps--&quot;<br/>

<br/>

She started closing that distance between us, the countdown in my head
down to single-digit inches. <i>Six inches, five inches, four... </i>My
mind seemed to turn off and the only thing keeping me from flatlining
into a coma was my hormones.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Yeah,&quot; I barely gasped out as my hands nested within her hair.
&quot;That would be nice.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<i>...Three to get ready, two for the show, one last chance to close your
heart.</i> Rory's hand touched my cheek; I did the same for her. Her blue
eyes sparkled in my gaze, and she must have thought my pupils were
crackling with a fire not even Tristan could start.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;It would be nice,&quot; was the last thing she said before the inch
became fractions, those fractions became smaller fractions, then decimal
points going from tenths to hundredths to thousandths, all the way down
to millionths as my year-long pursuit to make her know that I wanted her
ended.<br/>

<br/>

0.00&quot; is equal to Rory kissing me, and though I could describe it in
droll and completely silent terms, I'm going to be girly here and say
that, wow, it took my breath away. It was a soft kiss, something that
started fairly benign. Being the unprepared portion of the couple I just
went with what she wanted, her soft lips against mine and trying to
imitate what she was initiating with me.<br/>

<br/>

Within moments however, that shy and reserved girl that usually defines
Rory seemed to drift from her body, and she started gripping at the side
of my neck, wanting to heat up the kiss. I also did the same on my end
and tried to keep up with her, afraid somehow that I was going to fuck it
up. There was nothing to fear though; as her actions with her mouth
indicated that she wanted more than just 'smack-smack' pecks. I easily
agreed to her wishes and it didn't take long for those soft pecks ended
up long, insistent open-mouthed kisses.<br/>

<br/>

Mind you I wasn't ready to bring it up to frenching, and Rory's body
language indicated she wasn't either. This was us proving how we wanted
this relationship to start. We couldn't go into this with 100% lust, we
still had to have our wits about and make sure that one or the other
wanted this or that. Though it took me a bit, I finally recalled the
advice I had read on a website that I wrote in shorthand onto an index
card for that date with Tristan about how to kiss goodnight. I used that,
and though for a different purpose, as in saying hello to my girlfriend
named Rory, it seemed to work. I found my head against the armrest of the
sofa, Rory above me and her legs across mine, doing well to stay out of a
sexual position.<br/>

<br/>

We said barely anything through this first kiss; just enough to say
whether we liked what we were doing to each other or not. I was more
focused on things going haywire with my senses. I could smell nothing but
Rory and her light flowery body wash scent mixed with faded vanilla, and
heard nothing but the insistent pounding of my pulse in my ears, along
with the sounds of kissing and our shifts on the couch. She was still
kissing me with vigor, and I was starting to reciprocate with all the
passion I've had in reserve for so long.<br/>

<br/>

My hands in her hair, keeping her soothed, I just kept myself on her
lips, trying to keep this thing between us heated up. Our noses touched a
couple times, and everything about this situation, it seemed right.
<br/>

<br/>

After months of want, weeks of sly flirting, days of want, hours of close
contact, and minutes of desire, things had finally come to a head, with
the result being both of us having this kiss on her couch. Never in my
dreams could I have thought this moment would end up this way.<br/>

<br/>

I was surprised with how aggressive Rory was since I expected her to be
sort of vanilla and plain when it came to passion. She was far from that,
giving me some teasing hints of what to expect from a relationship with
the occasional lip-nip and her body weight atop of mine. It was
wonderful, some of it was so dizzying I forget details, and I felt like I
would lose all my breath; whatever kisses she ever gave Dean, they had
very little passion compared to this one.<br/>

<br/>

I felt myself beyond aroused, trying to be careful that she didn't sense
my nerves and the fact my legs were tightly crossed. I panted for breath
with each chance I got, Rory's arms wrapped around my back, seemingly not
ready to let me go. I felt so underdressed, for only the shirt was in the
way. My face was flushed to a dark crimson and my lips were numb from the
kiss, I couldn't dare imagine what would happen if the kiss continued on
from what it was. Rory's legs were a little too close for comfort, and
feeling her chest against mine, though I would have loved to heat up the
kiss, she needed a slow build-up. I wasn't just going to leap into bed
with her, and she was probably thinking the same thing towards me.<br/>

<br/>

So with more hesitation than I had turning in my Harvard application, I
pushed her back gently. I made sure to smile, reassuring Rory that her
courageous move to be the one to initiate was for the best. She pushed
over to the other side of the sofa, our gazes never retreating as I
looked over the results of my side of the kiss.<br/>

<br/>

Her hair was sort of disheveled from my fingers' tendency to have
something to do since I'm a rabid multi-tasker even in the throes of
passion, and her face was a dark pink, dampened from perspiration
dripping down her forehead caused by our closeness. She was just sitting
there, smiling and breathing heavily, and all I could think to myself
was, <i>I did this, I caused her to lose her bearings</i>. I smiled,
still nervous and sort of on edge. My longtime dream had just come true,
and I didn't want to ruin it.<br/>

<br/>

Despite the fact I seemed to get everything out, there were still a
rabble of butterflies floating around my belly. <i>Did I do it right?
</i>was the question to myself as I tried to gauge Rory's reaction to
that first kiss. I analyzed it in my head, the timing, technique, whether
I should've done a flick of my tongue against my teeth in or to tease her
a little, also whether I tasted fine, because the mint of the tea may
have been a little overpowering.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;That, that was really nice.&quot; All the thinking in the world
couldn't stop that first reaction from coming out of my mouth, in a
nervous stammer. &quot;Geeze Gilmore, that was, wow--&quot; From there I
started a ramble that would make me feel right at home over at the
Institute of Living. Looking back at my reaction, I really need to
improve not only my kissing description skills, but also my
conversational skills in general. I was flighty and prone to getting
off-point, asking her things such as if I kissed too wet or had too much
pressure against her lips, even if my nose was too big to nuzzle.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Paris, calm down.&quot; She set her hand in mine. &quot;I liked the
kiss, and the way you kiss, it was just right, and because it was you, it
felt nice.&quot; She looked at me in a way that was reassuring, and sided
closer to me. &quot;As long as you won't start talking to me using index
cards from now on, things are starting off pretty well.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I had to laugh at that; only I would go into a date armed with more
questions than Art Fleming and Allen Ludden combined together. &quot;So I
was...fine? I didn't seem like an amateur when I kissed, because you
know, Dean and you together, you got pretty heated at times--&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Before I could get out another word, she interrupted me. &quot;Never as
heated as <b>that</b>. Trust me, you're a good kisser, I should be
recovering from that for days.&quot; She gave me that smile that weakens
my defenses and I couldn't help but agree internally.<br/>

<br/>

However I was feeling my inner vixen come out to play, and I was a
willing participant. So I slid one of my hands across her face, and put
on the most seductive smile I could imagine.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Actually,&quot; I let her know, using a soft and seductive, yet
firm treble to lure her in. &quot;I could hypothesize that the kiss was
good. However Gilmore, I'd just like to make sure this isn't a fluke and
that it was a pretty nice kiss.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I shifted closer to her on the couch as my index finger traced the extent
of the hairline on the back of her neck. A sensitive spot I was thinking
since the scalp seems to have plenty of nerve endings to give her more
funny feelings in the pit of her stomach, not to mention make Rory feel
like her gray matter dripped out of her ear from the elicited
feelings.<br/>

<br/>

I heard her moan just a bit, then bring up her composure again as she
noticed I was watching her. I came closer and closer as she slitted her
eyes and puckered her lips together.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Mm-hmm, the results of the first kiss were inconclusive.&quot;
Rory's blues met my browns, and she was giving me that secret 'I like you
smile' one more time. &quot;We need to conduct some further testing in a
closed lab environment, like this living room, for instance.&quot; Her
words elicited a very uncharacteristic laugh from me before I moved in
for the kill, telling her we'd be one of the oddest gay couples in
history with the way we flirted.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I guess that means I'm Oscar then? You're the one who's always
organized while my locker's a mess--&quot; I cut her off with a quick
peck on her lower lip, and decided to give her a taste of her own
medicine.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I hate to say this Gilmore, but you better let your mouth get
occupied with something else.&quot; We kissed again, and she moaned into
my mouth as I did a little nipping motion with my teeth on her lower lip.
&quot;And don't call me Felix, 'cause the older men? They just plain
creep me out, if I ever get it in my head to date one, you may shoot me
at four paces.&quot; I then kissed Rory Gilmore breathless with all I
had, leaving her speechless but for a forced out 'duly noted' in-between
breaths. I could tell when her eyes closed shut and she tried to shuffle
back away from my body things were really starting to come together for
the both of us.<br/>

<hr/>

The rest of the day was happily uneventful, and though we finally had to
separate off the couch after about an hour of slow meandering
conversation about what this was going to do for everyone that we knew
(and OK, maybe a little more kissing), Rory and I were far from in a
panic. There was a certain calmness about her as she let me know that she
thought long and hard about the reaction people would have to all of
this. Everything on both our ends had seemed to come together to form
this thing we have. My sly physical flirting and her using the English
language and events to shift the momentum this way like the field hockey
unit and the dance marathon, along with our conversations that seemed to
take a more soft tone over the last few weeks, everything had come
together almost perfectly. Some things were unplanned (Dean being let go
and the fight in the conference room), but all these events, they had
solidified our bond and were helping to spark this relationship that I
never thought would be possible at this rate.<br/>

<br/>

Time ended up passing way too fast, and before I could fathom it, 2=
hours had passed, and I had received a phone call from Francisca
wondering where I was since she was a little worried. I took it in the
kitchen and with Rory watching explained that I had caught a nap at
Rory's and there was more to the story, but I'd have to tell her later. I
smiled, finally able to not look one way or another to make sure Rory
didn't hear anything that would prejudice her. I swear since those kisses
happened we never took our eyes each other through the afternoon, but for
trips to the bathroom and my changing into a pair of sweatpants I had in
my car since the temperature was in the low 40s and there was a small
threat of flurries in the evening.<br/>
<br/>

After assuring Fran I'd be home soon, I ended the call and looked at Rory
with an apologetic look.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;It's uh, 6:50,&quot; I told her, trying to justify the time.
&quot;I'd better get home, because I have some spare editing work for the
<i>Franklin </i>I put off for the weekend.&quot; I played with the cuff
on my buttoned flannel, looking nervous to Rory, and both of us were in a
mood where separation was the last thing we wanted to happen. We were in
the slow burn, honeymoon phase and I wanted to find out more about how
Rory came to the conclusion she wanted me. However, there's plenty of
time for that in the days and weeks to come; it's not as if we were at
the end of <i>Casablanca </i>and I had to take off for points
unknown.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Yeah, I have about an hour before my mom comes home, the house
could stand for a clean-up.&quot; Rory smiled as we both looked around
the living room at what five days alone had done to this household. Pizza
boxes and takeout bags piled in a corner, some of the pillows were either
on the ground and astray, and there was still a blanket spread out on the
ground from Rory practicing the nights and day before the marathon.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Well at least you can proudly say you didn't have to resort to
cooking at any time,&quot; I told her as we walked out into the front
foyer. &quot;I just hope Lorelai loves the surprise you're springing on
her.&quot; I gave her a look upon realizing something. &quot;You are
going to tell her that I was your partner, right?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

She nodded and said that I would get a nice long boast about how much ass
we kicked on that gym floor together, which left me relieved. Why would I
have anything to fear in the first place, it was common knowledge we won
already.<br/>

<br/>

I was still worried about something else as I leaned back against the
front French doors and I prepared to let her go after 37 hours with her
in my arms' length.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Ror,&quot; I said nervously. &quot;I'm a hundred percent sure I
want to try a relationship with you, I just want to make sure that from
earlier, when you said this might be a phase, were you being
truthful?&quot; I looked into her eyes, expecting to see her scared and
trying to explain things. But she's thought about this a lot, which much
I'm sure of, because she was sliding her hand into mine and trying to
keep me reassured.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;If it's a phase, it's a phase,&quot; she answered truthfully.
&quot;But we have to take a risk here, there's an attraction between us,
and from what we talked about this afternoon, we can't sweep this under
the rug. We can't give up on this because it looks bad to Hartford
society, and if it does, we'll support each other.&quot; She looked up at
me, giving me an easy smile. &quot;I really do like you Par, and
everything I wrote down in that notebook is the complete truth, I've felt
more of a pull towards you than I ever did with either Dean or Jess, and
I must be into sadism to have lasted this long trying to get in your good
graces.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Man, she had a pretty nice point there; how many times did I belittle
her, only to have her bounce back up towards me like a jack-in-the-box.
So many times I could've lost her, but each time she stayed attached in
the name of friendship and competition. I have to admit, she's managed to
stretch the very definition of loyalty to its absolute limit.<br/>

<br/>

I made eye contact with her, and after thinking over her words, let Rory
know that I felt the absolute same way about her, and that I'll do
anything to keep her, even though I'll have to keep this entire secret
for now. I don't feel comfortable having to deny all that's happened
today and in the last five days besides the dance marathon, but I want to
get to know Rory through the old-fashioned courting dance, and the only
way that can happen is if we keep this hush-hush.<br/>

<br/>

She was being shy, I was being shy, yet I didn't want to leave.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Thanks Paris, for everything this weekend,&quot; she said to me.
&quot;You went above and beyond what I was hoping would happen these last
two days, and I'm relieved I don't have to hold back things
anymore.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You're welcome,&quot; I said as I found myself drawing closer
involuntarily. I didn't know why, but my hormones must feel like they've
been released from a stronghold I kept them in for so long. I don't feel
shy and self-conscious around her anymore, so I felt comfortable taking
her by the hand. &quot;I never want to do the whole-day dancing gig
again, but this being your girlfriend? I'm dedicated to you now, so if
you need to call me, you know the number and the email.&quot; I smiled
towards her, and Rory seemed to sigh as we both leaned in at the same
time another soft, warm and longing kiss. I was glad not to be wearing
any lip makeup, for the feeling of Rory's lips on mine is something I
want to get very used to. By the time the kiss ended, we were both flush,
and smiling like idiots. Idiots in the first stages of love, but one time
I don't take that word as an insult.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I'll see you tomorrow when you get to school,&quot; she told me in
a voice that seemed a little too cheery for a goodbye, &quot;otherwise
I'll contact you somehow tonight after Lorelai and I are all talked
out.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I'm not going to be up at 12:30 in the morning,&quot; I joked, and
Rory rolled her eyes and said my name in that 'I can't take you
sometimes, but I'll take you anyways despite' tone.<br/>

<br/>

Just then, I got this flash in my mind of Rory waiting at the town bus
stop across from the town square, Dean no longer there to see her off for
the day and seemingly alone in her Walkman-soundtracked world, watching
the world pass by her as she sipped from the foam cup of Luke's finest. I
could tell from her attitude on Tuesday that she was starting to loathe
the bus, and in conversation during the dance, let me know that the
driver was a real jackass to her when she rang the chime at my corner.
There was also the guy who sat in front of Rory who leered at her like
she was jailbait. Not to mention she's still pissed two months later
because cuts in the CT Transit budget means she has to do a loop through
North Hartford that's miles from her final destination of Chilton because
they're too stingy for a dedicated route between the southern part of the
county and south Hartford.<br/>

<br/>

I also thought back to Tuesday where I was able to have her in the front
seat on the way into class. It was a lot less lonely driving south
towards the school, and though we were both in a rush that morning,
imagining the half-hour of bonding and deepening our relationship I could
have with her, Rory's mood in the morning could improve if I extended my
ride offer to the morning. I thought about the extra cost and maintenance
of another 35 miles a day on the Jag to myself, and found it to be a
small price to pay despite the extra fuel. Driving her myself would also
take the worries of depending on the whims of the bus driver to find out
when my now-girlfriend would get in. Before, I barely trusted them with
her safety. Now though, I couldn't fathom her taking that bumpy and
wearing trip to Chilton on a bus each day.<br/>

<br/>

Not to mention the brownie points I'd score with the elder Gilmores.
Lorelai wouldn't cringe at seeing the $40 she had to give Rory for a
monthly bus pass put to much better use (or to pay for some of my gas),
while Emily, her grandmother would be overjoyed to see her granddaughter
finally getting along well with a classmate well enough to get a lift to
school from her each morning. Never mind that said classmate has
completely shallow intentions for giving her grandchild a lift to
school.<br/>
<br/>

I let her know this new plan I had, and of course, she started trying to
shy away from my plans immediately.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I couldn't do that to you, your entire morning routine would have
to be changed, you'd have to get up earlier than you do now,&quot; she
argued. &quot;What about your servants and Fran, they're not going to be
happy about having to get up early, and your car in the winter! The road
into town here isn't exactly friendly in driving snow...&quot; Aww, I
just like it when she gets all rambly and tries to stop me from spoiling
her.<br/>
<br/>

So I shut her up again with another slow lingering kiss, which I'll have
to take in mind from now on as a good strategy to use to beat her when we
mock debate. I broke it up and explained that I could go to bed at 10:20,
an hour earlier from now on, and that the servants are already up and
awake by 4:30am, long before my then-current wakeup time of 6:15am. Fran
would be cool with everything, and if the roads didn't seem to cooperate,
Rory forgot that I have a Range Rover in the garage I drive in the snow
that has a high center of gravity and snow tires that wouldn't get stuck,
even on the two-laner that goes into the Hollow.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Oh yeah, you're rich, of course you'd have an SUV just in
case.&quot; She laughed nervously towards me. &quot;Are you sure it's not
a hassle? You're very kind for offering, but--&quot;<br/>

<br/>

Time to get into strict authoritarian mode about then. &quot;I'll be here
Ror, and I will drag you off the bus if you try to get on it! I want that
extra half-hour alone with you so much, so just take the rides, I'm not
going to take a no for an answer.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Fine.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Just don't be late and watch out for
the bumper-attacking deer on the way down.&quot; I grasped the doorknob,
we both headed out of the house, and we walked down from the porch, to
the gravel driveway my car was sitting on. It was a dawdling kind of
seeing-off, both of us just taking in the silence of the early evening as
I took my keyring out of my pocketbook and deactivated the alarm system.
We both looked left and right, hoping we were truly alone. The seemingly
limitless time we had before was gone; it was time to leave her for the
rest of the night.<br/>

<br/>

Rory held her arms close to her chest because of the cold weather. The
tank top seemed to be a bad idea out there, but my mind still found
something positive about it, namely her chilled breasts aroused by the
cold. I kept my eyes on the car so I wouldn't be caught looking at her so
blatantly...<br/>

<br/>

OK, I did look, twice. Hey, you'd do it too if your girl didn't dress
well for the weather. She didn't seem to notice, though she gave me a
knowing look as I went into the car and started up the engine. Before
that point, saying goodbye to Rory was something that was inevitable.
After this Sunday though, I can never say goodbye to her again without
feeling sort of melancholy.<br/>

<br/>

I brought the window down, and she bent down to my eye level.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Thanks again for the wonderful weekend, I'll try to get a smaller
replica trophy from the town shop as soon as I can for you.&quot; She
smiled, and I couldn't help but do it too. Knowing that this was Stars
Hollow and the neighbors next door could be watching from beneath their
blinds, I gave Rory one last kiss, in a friendly way on her cheek that
wouldn't arouse suspicion.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I won you hon.&quot; I let her know, turning into a full-scale sap.
&quot;No trophy or ribbon has the same significance as being able to say
that you Rory, are mine.&quot; It was unexpected and something I never
expected to tell anyone in my lifetime, but with Rory, I can let my guard
down with her.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;And I'm yours Par,&quot; she let me know once more. &quot;Until
tomorrow,&quot; she started to back away from the car. &quot;Goodnight,
and I hope things go well for us tomorrow.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Me too Rory, goodnight.&quot; With one more longing look, I watched
Rory walk towards her porch in the rear-view mirror, as I reveled in the
fact that girl, she was mine.<br/>

<br/>

<i>I feel...content</i>, I thought to myself as I turned on the radio to
one of the all-news radio stations out of New York to catch up with
current events. It was mere background noise however, for I was still
wrapping myself around Rory sharing the same feelings that I had for her.
Suffice to say, the shock won't go away for days, and I'm sure when I
awake at 5:30 tomorrow morning, there's going to be a pinch on my arm to
confirm this fact, that we're both smitten with each other in such a deep
way.<br/>

<br/>

I pulled out of the driveway and onto Cherry Lane, leaving this weekend
of November 9th and 10th, 2002 for history to decode. Rory's figure
seemed to shrink in the rear view mirror with each new foot of road, the
strain on my heart from missing her already starting to take root. When I
reached the intersection of Cherry and Peach, which went towards the
square, the small glow of her porch's light was all that was left of the
view. I flicked on my right turn signal, stopped for as long as the law
required me to, and turned right, back towards Hartford and an existence
I'm not sure I want anymore.<br/>

<br/>

Things are going to change from hereon out for both of us, I know this
and Rory probably has this front and center in her mind. Over the next
few months we're going to learn who are our true friends, that accept us
for all we are. There's going to be people we'll find out can't stand the
sight of two girls holding hands intimately, or worse, want us to
'renounce' our gaiety and try to cure Rory and I of this 'sickness'. I
haven't read my friends or most of my family yet; right now it's about
50-50 that Madeline and Louise would accept us for who we are; Louise has
some morals in her somewhere I'm sure.<br/>

<br/>

My paternal (read; Jewish) side is going to be that way too, so really,
I'm more afraid of my mother and anyone else on her side I share genes
with, because they won't take well to this. If Sharon keeps ignoring me
now in my asexual and fiery bookworm guise, what's to say she'll put a
curtain of silence over me if she finds out I like a girl, and even
worse, a frugal and non-rich girl from Podunk who comes from a woman she
loathes? It's something I'm dreading, but thankfully thanks to Mohegan
Man, will remain an open question for a long time to come; two weeks at
the least. I'll only see her for five minutes after school each day, and
then it's off with her on another whirlwind adventure to yet another boat
dealer's lot in southeast Connecticut. She has this newfound obsession
with yachting since Mohegan introduced her to it a few days. God, I hope
Mohegan Man has all the piloting and captaining skills of the star
character in some bad 90's flick I saw once on overnight TBS, <i>Captain
Ron</i>. A flying leap off the starboard side might do Mother's mental
fitness some good for once.<br/>

<br/>

The ride home was silent the rest of the way, save for the catching up on
the news and those thoughts, and I pulled into the garage next to the
Manor about 8:15pm. I took the dress out of my emergency grooming bag and
was thankful to find it unwrinkled and still in mint and vintage
condition. Fran trusted me with this heirloom of her mother's, so I took
all the precautions I could to make sure she received it back the way I
found it. God, I love her. Without Francisca, I'd be such a sour girl and
yearning in desperation for any kind of attention. She's kept me sane
throughout the process of wooing Rory, and without her advice, I would've
ruined things between Rory and I months ago.<br/>

<br/>

When I came into the kitchen and went through the first floor towards the
grand stairway up to the second floor, I found the house empty, but for a
butler dusting a dining room china cabinet and the maid bringing up some
wash and spreading a lily-white tablecloth across the dining room table.
I was able to go upstairs without so much as a 'hello', since Mother has
seemed to taken employment advice from Rory's grandmother and fires staff
she controls whenever they don't meet her standards, which means often. I
swear, that neat freak and etiquette Nazi, Hyacinth Bucket from that
Britcom would tell Sharon her turnover is beyond crazy. But as I've said
in the past, as long as she never touches any of the staff members hired
by Daddy, especially Francisca, I could care less if a convicted felon
was making my breakfast or cleaning my shower.<br/>

<br/>

It felt so weird coming into that house wearing Lorelai's shorts beneath
my pants, and her flannel instead of my usual high-quality wardrobe, and
as I stepped on the second floor landing from the stairs, suddenly
everything around me seemed too large for me. The large windows along the
sides of the hallway, 8 foot tall paintings of my ancestors and the high
double doors all down the hallway, this mansion, Gellar Manor, has been
where I grew up for seventeen years.<br/>

<br/>

After experiencing the cramped, yet cozy environs of the Gilmore house
for twelve hours, things seemed too large to me. Although I keep a small
bedroom of 15' x 18' (by upper-class Hartford standards), I could
probably live comfortably in a middle class-house's bedroom just fine. My
bed is the largest thing that I own, and I've taken advantage of the DVD
and digital media era by turning my desktop computer into a do-all,
radio, TV, stereo system and all around media system in addition to my
schoolwork and web work. Everything I have in ones and zeroes is backed
up four times over, with two of the backups offsite at Chilton and in a
hard drive I safe deposit in my bank. My wardrobe is small, making my
walk-in closet almost a sleeping-in closet. The only thing I could say
clutters up are books, magazines and paperwork, and that I have
meticulously filed downstairs in the library.<br/>

<br/>

It's odd, I'm so lucky to have been born into a wealthy family. I have a
room any girl would dream of, with lots of blank wall to hang limitless
pictures of Justin Timberlake, Usher, and the other male effigies of this
lifeless media generation. I could have a large vanity on one side of the
room that could easily fit the entire makeup department of Bloomie's in
with space to spare, and enough room in the closet for more than 1,500
pairs of shoes, giving Imelda Marcos a run for her money.<br/>

<br/>

Thing is though, I'm simple. I live simple. The walls are bare, save for
hanging art and the corkboard above my desk, along with embellishments my
mother insisted on making and I didn't turn down, sadly keeping her from
a nervous breakdown and a trip to the sanatorium. I don't care to get
into those, but mostly they involve a mural on one wall that's supposed
to look like a blue sky with clouds, but ended up having the appearance
of an incomplete drywall project with the 'clouds' horribly done and the
sky blue far from the correct portion of the spectrum; it's more dark
blue.<br/>

<br/>

About the only abnormal thing in the room is a mini-fridge in a corner
off to the side with diet soda and cold ice tea on hand, and I only
purchased that so I could stay out of Sharon's hair for as many hours in
the day as I can. With the private bathroom and some smart shortcuts, I
could survive at least a year without seeing my mother if I ever felt
compelled to shut her out completely.<br/>

<br/>

Ahh, the private bathroom. With a $10,000 Kohler shower unit in one
corner with about 15 separate showering and massage settings including a
waterfall, and a massaging bathtub in the other, along with a large sink,
I'm lucky in that regard. I can bathe in absolute privacy without fearing
anyone barging in or worrying about running out of hot water since each
bathroom has it's own hot water heater. That was my first stop after
getting into my bedroom, as I quickly disrobed and kicked off the
underwear I had been in for almost two days. It was a very enjoyable
showering session, and though I didn't partake any kind of fantasy
situation with Rory while I cleaned off the sweat, tears and dirt that
built up from the dance marathon and the stay with Rory, it warmed me to
know that I didn't have to be afraid to from this point on. Rory made it
clear I was in her fantasies, so her having marquee billing in mine would
not cause me to feel guilt anymore.<br/>

<br/>

The time seemed to pass quickly after I got out of the shower. I changed
into light silk pajamas, colored a baby pink, and sat down at my G4 Mac
to catch up on the news about Chilton I missed over the weekend. That's
where I learned to my chagrin thanks to a good recap article by Davidson
Banfield, my #1 sportswriter that Chilton's football team was dealt a
heartbreaking loss to Seth Thomas Intermediate in their regional final
playoff game Friday night, 40-38. No one in that entire stadium though
that STI's placekicker would hit a last-second 55-yard field goal with
the wind blowing into him since his personal best before that was 36, but
his foot was strong enough to force the ball between the goalposts,
leaving the Blue Demons, the Demonette cheer squad and all the students
and alumni wearing Chilton blue stunned and leaving Archauer Stadium
wrenching that their season ended so anti-climactically. It was sad to
read, and I couldn't bear to edit the article, since Dave articulated
what the average Chiltonian had felt the moment the ref's arms raised in
the air signifying the successful try. It's going to be a
down-in-the-dumps day in the halls tomorrow, I know that already.<br/>

<br/>

The other teams from the school had won their matches/games though,
numbing the pain of the football loss somewhat, and some scholarships
were given out, so though there would be no boost from a state semifinal
edition of the <i>Franklin</i>, I'd still be able to get together a nice
edition to put out.<br/>

<br/>

Of course, with Rory's help. I smiled to myself, thinking of how
interesting brainstorm sessions would be after tonight. Why do I have a
feeling that this is going to be like an office romance? Things will be
done eventually, but only after plenty of groping, sweet nothings and
snuck kisses in the broom closet. I share two big student group
responsibilities with her, so to have my partner also happen to be my
debate compatriot, student VP <u>and</u> assistant editor for the paper;
I'll have to be careful to make sure that we both are on the same page.
It used to be a hot-button issue would just cause some disagreement
between us; being in a relationship with her now could be a traumatic
blow to how things are going. I have to stay opinionated, but also won't
be able to alienate or bully Rory into agreeing with me anymore.<br/>

<br/>

Though I could always start a hot make-out session with her if all else
fails and blow her mind into going with my agenda. Noted for the
future...<br/>

<br/>

I eventually caught up on Chilton news and with Madeline and Louise over
the phone and instant messaging respectively, telling them I'd tell them
about my weekend tomorrow. I want to get a good story formed so that I
can keep in the excitement of the dance while blurring out the intimacies
of Rory and I and how we're not just friends anymore. I hate to keep them
in the dark for now, but I have to come out of the closet cautiously,
lest it ruin my rep at school and in the social circles, not to mention
Rory would be thrown to the lions with the kids finding out 'Mary' isn't
all she seems.<br/>

<br/>

There was one person I could trust with the news however; I went upstairs
to Fran's quarters and knocked on her door, holding the vintage dress on
a hanger and sort of nervous; this was the only woman who knew my
interest in a certain girl, and I was hoping I had done her proud.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Fran, hello?&quot; I said nervously after she told me to come in,
as she tended to a sewing project for a grandchild with a birthday coming
up. She turned around and gave me a once-over as I handed her the
dress.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;<i>Minha menina</i>, how was it,&quot; she asked with a smile which
warmed my heart. We shared a hug, and sat down at her materials table. I
had a smile a mile wide as Francisca hung the dress in the closet and I
told her what had happened in a simple way.<br/>

&quot;We won the competition,&quot; I started. &quot;It was tenuous at
times and there was a point where Tristan came up and I took it the wrong
way, but after that, things seemed to get more comfortable and...&quot;
after that I summarized the dance the best I could from memory, which was
filled with so many of them I felt like there was an overload. I let her
know about all that touching and conversation, along with competing and
Kirk and Carrie. Strangely, I can still recall the taste (or lack
thereof) of Mrs. Kim's eggless egg salad. There was never a time before
that I was more excited to gush about a victory like this, usually I keep
reserved and bottle up my enthusiasm. When I got to the part were Rory
had to take me out of a hyperfocused state to let me know Kirk and Carrie
had fallen, I had Fran laughing and happy for me, and then trying to hold
back tears as I described like a storyteller the <i>Eternal Flame
</i>dance, and how content I felt in Rory's arms.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;So what happened after? You didn't come back here, so I'd right
that you were over at Mistress Gilmore's home?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I nodded. &quot;She said it would keep from falling asleep on the way
back home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

&quot;I see.&quot; She shook her head knowingly, and gave me an unnerving
look.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;What? That's what she told me and Rory was right, I would've fallen
asleep on the way up.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Henrico was on call, you forget dear. Even if Rory had to bring
your sleeping body out to the town car, he still would have picked you up
and brought Bryant down with him, who would have driven your Jaguar
home...&quot;<br/>

<br/>

..Which I had remembered from Fran's last-second rundown Saturday
morning of how I could get home had I ended up the way I did, my drivers
Henrico and Bryant being on my beck and call to take me anywhere if I
needed to, ready to be dispatched. All my bases had been covered, and as
I had been trying to explain this backup plan to Rory, she had taken the
initiative to bring me into distracting conversation and pushing one of
her hands beneath the plunge of my dress, thus fogging my mind with
sorority nonsense and hoping her hand wouldn't distract me further. By
the time I had said yes to sleeping with her, Henrico and Bryant were
forgotten and the only thing on my mind was winning the contest and her
admiration.<br/>

<br/>

I blushed red, telling a little white lie that I forgot and was sleepy
instead of that Rory was screwing with my mind so she could put this
entire chain of events in motion, and hoped Fran would understand that I
didn't mean to worry the guys by not letting them know I made other
plans.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;No, they were fine and happy to get some sleep, the GPS showed you
were at the Gilmore home so they assumed you were sleeping over there.
Nothing to fear, you're not in trouble.&quot; Fran smiled at me and I
sighed in relief, thankful that the dealer installed a constant GPS
beacon in my car that they could monitor on the computer in the garage
just in case a nutjob tried to carjack me and think he could lose the
cops. &quot;How did that go, were you a good guest?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I told her about the day, which was uneventful before I woke up, save for
the spoon, which I kept out along with the unzipping. Once I got into the
afternoon though, I seemed sort of uneasy, fearing I'd say the wrong
thing and trigger something in Francisca. She accepts me, but there are
times I think she's scared about my well-being. I explained about the
lunch and studying Rory's notes, but started to fade my voice out once I
arrived at the point of the Russian Novels notebook.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Paris, what's wrong?&quot; Fran's voice conveyed concern towards
me, but before then, it had been to her, an unattainable crush to me,
something I would never have. It wasn't an illusion anymore, and if I
told her, she might try to talk me out of it.<br/>

<br/>

Still, she knew me better than my mother ever could. She was the one to
watch my first steps, listen to my first words (Fra-noo, proving here I
wasn't exactly reciting Keats at 10 months), and who has seen me grow up
from a child into the woman I am now. She was basically my mother in all
but name and blood, and what Fran thinks, that influences me.<br/>

<br/>

Her warm, timeworn eyes looked into mine, and I knew that whatever her
reaction was, she still loved me, no matter what. Our bond is something
you can find only rarely, and even Rory understands that. She even told
me while we talked she wasn't afraid of my nanny; she was someone who
sort of reminded her of Miss Patty, her defacto grandmother figure until
her and Emily reconciled in the funding of her Chilton education.<br/>

<br/>

I smiled towards Fran, and told her the truth as simply as I could.
&quot;I found Rory had been keeping a list of things she liked about me,
a romantic list of things. Some of what has happened over the last couple
months, she did that on purpose, to tell me she was interested. When I
found that evidence, and told her not with my words, but with my eyes and
my body language that I knew, she latched on and told me that she liked
me-liked me in that way. We talked a little, and after trying to make
heads and tails of this, we figured out that somehow in this weird way,
Rory and I had good compatibility.&quot; I laughed nervously, and tried
to gauge Fran's reaction to this news.<br/>
<br/>

She was stunned a little, but soon recovered and asked me something
important.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;Did you and Rory kiss?&quot;<br/>

<br/>

There was no hiding the rush of feelings flowing through my bloodstream;
for even now as I think about this, I still feel dizzy from each time my
lips touched hers. I could feel myself blushing as I admitted I indeed
locked lips with her at quite a few times after 4:30pm.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;This weekend for me was just exactly what Rory and I needed,&quot;
I confessed. &quot;When I danced with her, and we were up on that stage
holding that trophy together, that told me that we need each other, no
matter what. We might both disagree at times and get a little bitchy when
we're pissed at each other for what might be a little thing, but we both
have soft sides for each other, and I'm her impetus to strive to be
better, whether it be at school or in her eyes. In turn, she thinks the
same thing; that's our competitive fuel, and somewhere in the middle, it
ended up becoming passion. You saw me that weekend after we fought at
school Fran; I was a wreck without her.&quot; About this point, I started
trying to hold back tears as Fran told me I wasn't my same ferocious
self. &quot;God, I'm so glad you talked me into this dance, because I
haven't felt so happy since before I went out with Tristan, only this
time though, I know the feelings aren't one sided.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I then got up, met Fran in the middle of the room, and had a
mother-daughter-like hug together as she assured me in Portuguese that
she blessed Rory and I, that she had hoped that the weekend ended up this
way, with Rory as my girlfriend. I felt wonderful confessing that Rory
was my world and I was going to do my damndest to make this all work.
Fran promised me she would run interference with Sharon, but then she
cautioned me.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;You're going to have to tell her one day dear, and it will end up
more soon than later. I know it's going to hurt her, but she's your
mother despite.&quot; I bowed my head, thinking of Mother and how she'd
react. In my mind, it's going to be horrible, and I can already sense
that almost seven years of frustration and anger against her will be
released as I tell her I'm gay.<br/>

<br/>

<i>You're going to disappoint her</i>, my rational side reasoned, and
sadly, it's most likely correct. I'm already leery and scared of her iron
rule over my life, and can only imagine what kinds of things she has in
mind. She's never wanted me to associate with Rory, and that was the only
reason I used anger to defend against her push for friendship. I love
Rory, though I'm not ready to tell her that because it takes time to say
those three words to each other.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;I will tell her, but not for the next month probably,&quot; I said
to my nanny. &quot;We're in the experimental phase, and I want everything
to go right.&quot; Fran looked at me, and nodded her head in
understanding.<br/>

<br/>

&quot;It will, I promise you.&quot; She rubbed circles counter-clockwise
around the top of my hand in a soothing motion. &quot;Now after a night
like that, it is time to sleep, you need to refresh and recharge, you
look like you've had a long day.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;A long day, but also a good day.&quot; Both of us smiled, and I
hugged her one last time tightly before I left her quarters.
&quot;<i>Obrigado</i> (thank you)<i> Francisca.</i>&quot;<br/>

<br/>

&quot;<i>Quando caro, eu te amo, boa noite. </i>(Anytime dear, I love
you, good night)&quot; I returned the love, and left her quarters,
walking back to my bedroom feeling much more lighter than I did when I
left this home at five in the morning on Saturday.<br/>

<br/>

That brings me to where I am at this moment, laying in bed beneath layers
of heavy blankets, an old dog-eared romance novel in my grasp, the
literary equivalent of junk food. The story doesn't have my attention
however, because as I lay here, I keep flashing back in my mind those
intimate moments of interest Rory shared with me through the last two
days. Those close touches, her hands against my back, as we guided each
other to the slow beat of the music. I close my eyes and set the book
down, my mind thinking of her undressing me and undoing Ms. LaCosta's
tight knot. Teeth nip against those sensitive hairs beneath the rope of
my Jewish star necklace, her lips soft against my nape as her hands run
all over my back.<br/>

<br/>

I feel a knot tighten up beneath as I imagine Rory at first undoing the
knots, then her nervous voice in my ears, confessing her love for me. The
name Lorelei (spelled with an 'e' in actuality instead of an 'a') comes
from a Germanic legend about a sea siren on the banks of the Rhine, and
though I only know her by her nickname of Rory, the name that's listed on
her birth certificate, the meaning of it is fitting her behavior around
me perfectly. I think of her undoing the knot, then having me turn
around, where she whispers my name softly, then brushes her lips against
mine softly. I let the front of the halter dress go, take her into my
arms, and tell her how much she means to me as I cradle her ass into my
hands, and while both of us softly kiss and tease, back her through the
kitchen and into the bedroom, where we fall onto the bed in a heap, both
of us starting to find our faces messed up with desire and want. I can
still taste against her lips the familiar bitter tang of her own personal
addiction, a hint of vanilla and brown sugar seeping in from the gloss
against her lips.<br/>

<br/>

My eyes tighten closed, and I find myself glad to have rid myself of the
matching pajama pants I wore upstairs as I slide a hand up my thigh, the
skin beneath the heel seeming to overheat with each thought of my
favorite brunette as I think of myself trying to shrug the red dress she
cut a rug in off her slim body. I moan Rory's name softly into the chilly
air of my bedroom and my hand meets the bare skin of my side above the
waistband of my panties. I feel ready to slide in a finger beneath the
leg and spark a fantasy sure to cool my hormones and at the same time
expend that last energy I have that's keeping me awake and fall asleep in
a soothing ecstasy--<br/>

<br/>

And now what is that tone that just jarred me out? Oh, it's just my
iBook, which in a stroke of relaxing genius is within arms' length of my
bed on the left side. I have it set to tone whenever I have an email from
a good friend or Harvard (Hey, they could admit me at 12:01am tomorrow
morning, you never know. Now that would be the ultimate great day!). I
feel so comfortable in the position I'm in, but I never receive an email
on a Sunday night.<br/>

<br/>

That is unless there's some <i>Franklin </i>trouble. Oh dear, I better
look at it. Thankful that the only wire that's connecting it is the AC
adaptor plug, I grab it from its resting place and open the lid,
expecting the worst as I Open-Apple+E into my email client and watch the
messages filter into my main mail account, set up through the cable
company. A few pieces of junk filter in, along with one of Louise's
famous forwards I'll never read. I'm about ready to attribute this tone
to a false-negative that snuck past my spam filter.<br/>

<br/>

Wait...I gasp out as I see that name that now will turn me into a sap
each time I see it or hear it. I smile a little as I double click on the
message, and let the words spill onto my screen;<br/>

<b><i>From: LLGilmoreIII@snet.net (Rory Gilmore)<br/>

Subject: Good Night<br/>

<br/>

Par,<br/>

<br/>

I'm here in my room, trying to think of what to say while my mom runs to
the video store for candy and movies (a school night yes, but it's been
five days and we've missed each other so much, time to bond) and before I
get to tell her that you and I are the dance marathon champions, when my
mind and my heart are still numbed because of what happened this
afternoon. I'm still stunned, but don't worry, in a good way. I mean
there have been first kisses I've shared, but Dean and Jess were never on
the same page with me. That you've been thinking of me this way for at
least the last five or six months, it made the kisses even better in
hindsight. I promise you I have no regrets about this, and even though
we'll have to go incognito on being together for now until we come up
with a telling plan, I want to be closer to you, no matter the
cost.<br/>

<br/>

Also, I'm sort of looking back on our first two years when we were at
odds, and though it may not seem like it, all that fighting brought us
closer. I could be thinking a little too forward about this, but after
all that fighting, I feel like we can survive anything. We're both
fighters Par, and we've both shown that so much. Though we've never
resorted to fists, our words are strong and they fly fast, and with both
of us in a romantic relationship like this, we can overcome anything, I
think. You kiss like you fight; strong and never wavering...lol.<br/>

<br/>

I also think that if we fight, making up will be sort of...passionate.
Though I'm not thinking we'll be like that just yet, I have to admit that
after I fought with you in the conference room, my mom made this
observation to me as I ranted on the way to Grandma's that I was talking
about you like we were already sparring partners, and not in the boxing
sense. I'm not saying that I want to fight again just for that positive
side effect, far from it (God, I hope not). It's just that even when
you're pissed off at me, and I'm wanting to tear out all your hair in one
swift motion from your scalp because you're pushing my buttons, well
let's just say that the 'I want her so bad even though she's poking me
and drawing blood with a pointy stick' button is big, red and blinking
compared to the smaller keys I could push.<br/>

<br/>

I kept everything back from you for so long, afraid of what you would
think of me wanting you, I don't exactly scream out lesbian from the way
I act. But there was always something about you Par. From that first day
you told me not to forget that you owned Chilton, I wanted to figure you
out, find out what made you tick, be the way you are. That's why I kept
trying to stay in your good graces; you were interested in me even if you
did loathe me, you paid attention to me when others in Chilton weren't.
Over time that because a curiosity, and then a mission, until I finally
realized, I think I want you. I don't know if it's going to be the
relationship of a lifetime, but I'm bored with guys. I'm done being
auctioned off and fought over like a talented ball player or something of
that sort. I want to have a relationship on my own terms, without having
to worry about going too far or fucking up because I let passion get in
the way. I'm not interested in guys anymore; I don't think I ever was,
and had Dean never introduced himself to me at SHH, I don't know if we'd
be at this point Par, becoming partners, or even in the deepest part of a
relationship. Things may have been different, but I do know if things
have happened like they did and I had a second chance at making changes,
I wouldn't change this one bit.<br/>

<br/>

We're perfect together, in sync, simpatico. Maybe we're even soulmates.
I'm going to convince you, that falling for me is the best risk you ever
decided to take. I like you as not only one of my best friends, but you
know how it feels to be under all this pressure. I'm not scared of
anything, and I hope you're not either, because from this night forward,
you're my girlfriend, and I'm committed to you. Never, ever doubt that,
for those sparks we share are real as can be.<br/>

<br/>

I'd like to write more Par, but I just heard Lorelai barging into the
house with bags in her hand and she's making a rather loud cowboy yelp
that's really distracting...oh God, not another cowboy phase, I swear
sometimes I should be running the Inn and my mom should be at Chilton
:-p. Gonna end this message, and I'll see you outside Luke's tomorrow at
7am sharp, I thought it over and you'll be my ride to and from school
from now on, I'm sending my Ralph Kramden-like driver to the moon
permanently (or at least passengerless at the Stars Hollow stop). Let me
know if you want anything for the trouble and I'll have it ready. Sweet
dreams honey.<br/>

<br/>

Ror<br/>

<br/>

P.S. - Uh, just in case you thought about this, the kiss? To me, a good
sign I didn't cry or run, because I was thinking about that all day,
thank God I didn't. Take that as a sign that I'm ready for this, because
I sure wasn't ready for Dean or Jess!<br/>

</i></b><br/>

I look over her message, feeling even sicker for her with each and
every word. She's putting a smile on my face and I'm sure she's sitting
with Lorelai in the living room right now, listening to her mother
describe an Elvis Presley haunt, while at the same time, thinking of me
in bed, reading this and getting emotional over it. Yep, I'm a wreck as I
read her kind words and what basically reads like a mission statement,
that I'm coming into a not just a relationship, but a 24/7 commitment
with her. It's something I've been ready for since last year, and it's
finally true.<br/>

<br/>

Her line about getting aroused after the fight? I smirk a little. Though
I was a wreck myself afterwards, she had seemed to already forgive me for
my overreaction, and was wound up from it? I didn't know that I was
<b>that</b> good! My breathing shortens, and I have to get a thought of
pushing her against the rail of a blackboard in the heat of an argument
out of my mind.<br/>

<br/>

It's clear from her thought out words though, that she's ready for this;
the pressure and problems that come with having a relationship with
another girl. She's not going to care what others think, as long as I
make her happy, all is well with us, and I'm going to stone myself into
trying to keep her as happy as she possibly can be. I write a reply just
as long to her quickly, depending on the auto-correction for once in my
client to get through the message. I respond to her point about anger
becoming lust, and maybe love succulently, and let her know I feel that I
have the same feeling about us; we're right for each other, no matter how
much we might seem like an odd couple. I confess a few more things, and
feel pleased as punch that she'll let me drive her to school.<br/>

<br/>

Finally, hearing that she didn't cry because the kiss seemed so right,
that was such a cute thing to include in the message. My worries about
her crying and running were high, but once she got deep into it, I knew
she was planted on the couch and upon my lips until she was out of
oxygen. I'm on top of the world as I click the send icon, and close the
laptop shortly thereafter feeling as if nothing can go wrong with this
relationship. Now we just have to build a strong relationship on top of
good kissing. It's a challenge, but I feel like we both can overcome it
and any others that get in our way.<br/>

<br/>

I'm about ready for bed now, my eyes seem heavy with sleep, so I undo the
silk pajama top and throw it off to the side as I settle myself in
beneath the covers. Before I do however, I reach out and open the drawer
in my nightstand, pulling out something that I've been hiding whenever
Mother or Rory have been in the room before. In a smooth dark maple
frame, a 4x6 of Rory and I smiling towards the camera, both of us
standing in front of the Supreme Court. A 16 year-old aspiring politico
from northern Kentucky was also at the same time honing his photography
hobby during the Washington trip, and told us to stand and pose together
in front of the tall and broad steps of the heart of the nation's
judicial branch so he could test out his abilities. Because his camera
was digital, at that luncheon Jamie asked me out, he handed out printouts
of the pictures he took to everyone who wanted them. He only had one of
our pose, but Rory didn't mind if I wanted it.<br/>

<br/>

The day after Rory and I arrived back home, I put it in a frame, and
would take it out of the drawer whenever I felt I missed Rory. The
picture was wonderful, a shot where we were both smiling widely and
looking towards the camera, both of us happy in that moment in time. I
can still remember the boy asking us to smile, and her arm at my side,
cradling me and bringing my body towards her. Her blue eyes seem to
sparkle in the picture, and those dimples she displays during a wide grin
make me weak. It was just one picture, one small picture.<br/>

<br/>

But what was in it encapsulates all the hopes and dreams I have of her. I
look at this photograph of us, this window to the start of what changed
this relationship we have from a rivalry to infatuation. I don't have any
idea yet if I'll be looking back with her ten years from now at this same
picture in a photo album and saying 'remember that summer of 2002 in
Washington, and then the autumn we fell in love? It's just wow, I can't
believe it's been that long, almost like that was a few days ago.' All I
know is that with the distance between our homes, I do miss her next to
me, her warm body against mine as we sleep together in bed. It's already
a feeling I want to have back, but I know that for now, it's going to be
a rare event.<br/>

<br/>

What I can do is look wide-eyed at her picture, and smile at the fact
that all that was hidden in our minds when it was taken, the crushes,
hopes and longing looks we were giving each other and now know for sure
we were each doing, it's now out in the open. I kiss the glass above
Rory's face softly and wish her goodnight, as I set it back onto the
nightstand, where it will now have a prominent and permanent place and
not be hidden again, and in all likelihood since I end up on my right
side when I wake up, she'll be the first thing I see every morning.<br/>

<br/>

For now though, I have an appointment with her in my dreams. What she
told me today, and what she did is so fresh in my mind that I shouldn't
see a problem falling asleep. One last look at her picture, and I can
imagine her lips drifting higher from my neck, Rory wrapping her arms
around my midsection possessively, then her teeth nipping at the outer
shell of my right ear, whispering heated innuendos and obvious flirting
to have me slip out of my dress and slide one of my hands against her
thigh, drifting up her pale skin slowly and with agony...<br/>
