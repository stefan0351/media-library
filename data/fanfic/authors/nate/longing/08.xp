<h4>7:59pm, Rory's POV</h4>

<p>I remember when I had those feelings for Jess before I kissed him at
Sookie's wedding, how conflicted and disloyal I felt to not only my
mother for ditching her graduation to see him, but how crappy it must've
been to Dean that I was going behind his back to pursue something with
him. I look back on that now and think of myself as crazy for doing
that, skipping school and jeopardizing everything just so I could risk
my life to see that boy. It was crazy back then, and it still is now. </p>
<p>But an infatuation was guiding me, that maybe, just maybe I wanted
Jess instead of Dean. His brown eyes, rebellious demeanor and his
dislike of authority was the reverse of the way I led my life, and I
found myself in bed sometimes thinking about him and how he would do
things. That's why I went down there, love doing something funny to my
system and making me think that for one day, I just needed to be in his
gaze and see if he felt the same for me. Jess caused things to happen
within me Dean never stirred, and I became a cat, curious as to what was
on the end of that string dangled before me. </p>
<p>Once I kissed him though, I felt...what should have been happiness
and fulfillment from obtaining my goal of kissing Jess, but instead
turned out to be far from that. A sense of nothing took over my body in
front of that pond on the Inn grounds, and from there, I realized a
conclusion my brain had arrived at nine months before, but I refused to
believe. </p>
<p>Jess and I; like Mac and DOS, we'd never work together. I had the
bright outlook on things, the many open windows leading to different
programs and images along with the bright colored cabinet holding my
thoughts and dreams. Jess ended up being the C-prompt; an empty shell
who was stubborn, always needed to be told what to do, and with thought
processes that could use a few more megs of memory, he'd always stay in
that leather jacket, a 'beige box' if you will. He never expanded his
horizons, always expecting to be bailed out of trouble. He was always
unchanging, sour, and unreliable; pretty soon he'd break and lose it
all. The kiss got my attention alright; and it screamed out in a blue
screen 'Danger! Danger! Turn back now, you might be in for a world of
hurt if you go beyond this.' </p>
<p>So as I comfort Paris, what term could I use to describe her in an
electronic device sort of way? And how the heck did I get on this mind
track in the first place? Oh well, I got it now; she's like a cell
phone; at first she seemed to have only one purpose in talking, that is
in living out her dream of attending Harvard. As the years go on though,
she loses the extraneous weight and pressure that came with the first
mobile phones, and every six months she gets a new feature. Let's just
say that when I came to school two years ago, she was the basic model
that did little more than was supposed to. Now with me in her corner,
she's developing new features, like actual emotions, thoughts and
feelings, able to have empathy for others and communicate her feelings
in more ways than she ever though possible. Use the cell phone analogy
with text messaging, a camera in the handset, instant messaging and
that chirpy walkie-talky thing you find on some of them, and it fits
perfectly. </p>
<p>Enough of that though. My point is, Paris is really surprising me
tonight. She runs away by using her yellow card and for ten minutes I'm
stuck in the bleachers, praying she'll come back. In the meantime Jess
and Shane had come over to check up on me before they left on a date to
see some band in a grungy New Haven dance hall. They both looked very
nice, and as more days go by, I can't help but think I made the right
decision in letting Jess go. He's pleased with Shane and starting to
occasionally smile, while the wild blonde seems to have reined herself
in around Jess, who carries on the proud Danes monosyllablotic
tradition. I talk to them for a bit, trying not to mention where my date
was. I got into some quick music conversation with them before they had
to go, and I appreciate that I can be myself around Jess without having
any romantic feelings interfere anymore. </p>
<p>I watched the clock on the scoreboard nervously, counting the
minutes before Paris and I were called out. She was talking a long time
in there, and I saw Taylor almost salivate at getting to throw us,
couple #131 out of the event. There was only so much I could do, so I
could only hope she was straightening herself out. </p>
<p>By the time 7:46:53 hit, I gave up hope. There were less than thirty
seconds to go, and even she had no way of making it from the bathrooms
at the far end of the gym wing and back into my arms in that small
amount of time. <i>Not with her shoes and body type</i>, I thought to
myself as the lighted number switched from 6 to 7. 13:47:23 was good
enough for 56th place; at least we'd get in the top 60... </p>
<p>Never count Paris Gellar out until zero hour though. Ten seconds
later, I heard a rough shove of the gym door, and saw a flash of black,
blonde and red tomato rush through it and into the room again. My eyes
widened at the sudden tornado and her rough, yet formal shoving through
the crowd to get to me. </p>
<p>Down to seven seconds, and I finally heard her confirm who she was. </p>
<p>"RORY?!" </p>
<p>Her voice was rough and strained, I couldn't stand there and hope
she came to me; we had to come each other. So desperate to keep myself
in the game, I ran through the crowd, counting down the seconds in my
head. <i>16, 17, 18, 19...</i> </p>
<p>We were headed for a collision course at the 131 'X' on the floor as
the end digits on the board lit up and changed to 20. Three seconds,
fifteen feet between us, a lump in my throat forming. The skirt of my
dress was rising in the air, and I'm sure quite a few contestants got a
quick glance of the back of my legs as I stretched out my arm, I could
hear the click of the electric circuitry of the wall board in my mind as
that end digit went to 1... </p>
<p>My right hand was taken by her long and svelte left, time seemed to
stand still as we locked eyes again. </p>
<p><i>Click, 21 becomes 22.</i> </p>
<p>I felt her slide towards the tape mark, and my back fall towards the
gym floor as she shoved me down a little. Paris had something planned as
I felt her body move close to mine. She stretched me out, causing me to
spin about 450&#176; and then bringing me back towards her, only to
overshoot on purpose, where I found out her right arm was ready to brace
my back. She caught me, and I found myself with quite the eyeful of her
cleavage... </p>
<p><i>Click, 22 becomes 23...</i> </p>
<p>Her smile matched mine; we were again Paris and Rory, dance
partners. She brought me back up and into a regular kind of dance as we
didn't hear the expected 'Airhorn of Elimination', but a disappointed
Taylor instead cursing out Paris for making it on time. </p>
<p>We both laughed at this, and as she explained that yes, she was
sorry and she didn't mean to turn Tristan into an issue again, I didn't
expect much more than that, just an apology and a resumption of the
dance. </p>
<p>Once again however, she surprised me, and just like that, she
admitted what my heart had been hoping for since those first days this
summer we spent straddling the Mason/Dixon line in that Howard
University dorm room. Tristan was just a friend, always going to be just
a friend to her, and she had no intentions of resparking the crush
again. My heart was relieved and relaxed... </p>
<p>Until she admitted that the kiss I shared with him? She knew about
it from the day after the dance, thanks to Madeline's spying...I mean
security system, which had a hidden camera placed on a high shelf in the
room somewhere, directed dead center at the piano bench. From there, I
expected her to lecture me about my stupidity and why I'd be so weak
and do something like that, along with the inevitable 'you knew I
wanted him too, I don't care if your hearts were broken, I have first
dibs' speech. </p>
<p>Paris relieved me though; she knew I didn't go in there hoping to
seduce Tristan, that I was just trying to forget about what happened
with Dean the night before and that my mind wasn't all there, I was
looking for comfort. She knew I didn't enjoy the kiss and the feelings
that came with it, so I tried to reassure her by telling my side of the
story before she stopped me and told me she knew exactly what I'd say,
and she was right. </p>
<p>I felt relieved to say the least, along with a growing respect for
her. She didn't use the tape for blackmail material, and refused to use
it to bring me down, rather she'd compete against me for her grade
rather than win by a knockout blow. Coming from a girl I associated from
day one with bringing me down, Paris' sportsmanship when it came to our
grades was another thing I had learned about her that day. </p>
<p>We kept talking about Tristan for a bit, asking why she still had a
problem with the date with Tristan I set her up on, yet burned the tape.
Of course, the crush won out, for awhile at least. As DuGrey started on
his downward spiral, her heart, filled with his love previously, was
being wrung out. </p>
<p>But when she admitted that during that date, she didn't feel a
damned thing for him at all, even in a deep kiss, I didn't know what to
say. I wanted to celebrate that fact, but doing that would be rude and
idiotic. My mind wrapped itself around an image of Paris and Tristan at
her door kissing, watching her from a third person point of view and
seeing Paris remaining unresponsive to Tristan's apparently 'magic
mouth'. </p>
<p>She had never felt sparks for Tristan when they kissed. To Paris,
the swirling in her stomach, shaky mouth, loss of all rational thought
and feeling, heightened senses in her fingertips, that sudden response
to stand on one foot and lean in closer...that was still an alien
feeling to her. She was admitting as much to me, and for her to say she
felt nothing for the boy she chased for years and years, I realized
something. </p>
<p>I had experienced all of that when it came to Dean. She was wise
beyond her years when it came to book learnin' and the mannerisms she
acquired by being a part of Hartford society. When it came to love
however, she was still a relative novice. What advice I had told her
when it came to that date with Jamie was light and might as well have
been a mulligan. She had never experienced real love, hell, Paris had
never even been kissed. </p>
<p>I mean sure she had been kissed, technically. But not a <b>real</b>
kiss. The kind of kiss that makes you crumble to the ground, lose your
breath, yearn for more. As she talked about the way the date with
Tristan really went, I had this long look at her full lips as we danced,
my lashes lowered so she wouldn't clue into my gaze. My yearning to
show her how to kiss started to build up, and though I wouldn't do it
in such a public place, things became even more clear besides the crush
I was holding for her mind, body, and heart. </p>
<p>I wanted to show her how to really love, not just infatuation. If
two years with Dean has taught me something, it's what mistakes not to
make in the course of a relationship and how to keep the flame burning.
There were times I stayed with him only because of a sudden sweet
gesture he made, but I don't want to have to depend on those when I
pursue this. When she's around, like right now, just her presence
changes my thought processes from far from normal. I compete to not only
complete a goal I set for myself, to facilitate Lorelai's wishes, but
to gain Paris' respect. </p>
<p>There was a part of me that knew Paris wasn't brain-dead when it
came to showing love; but it wasn't her forte, and while she'd excel in
a few places, most of her idea of romance was a large question mark. A
part of me feels that my role is changing from seducer to teacher, and
Paris' is going from seductee to the student. </p>
<p>God, Rory Gilmore, the Sapphic Love Instructor? Imagine if I put
that on my business card later in life! </p>
<p>As I thought of this, the conversation seemed to be fading, and
Paris seemed ready to break down in my arms. As she said she was
thankful I was in her life, tears started falling and her grip started
to fade, so I propped her back up and had her rest her head against my
shoulder. Paris started crying, and moments later, I found my hand on
her back, massaging it as I tried to help her let out all her tears.
Thankfully she had rubbed off her eye makeup during the six o'clock
break so she wouldn't have dark streaks down her cheeks, so anyone who
looked in would think we were just dancing close. </p>
<p>There were a few couples around us looking at me funny for letting
her lean against my shoulder, but an eyeroll and a shift towards a far
corner of the gym remedied that so I could ease Paris back into a calm
mood in relative quiet. </p>
<p>I soothed her with words, my voice taking on a maternal treble.
"It's OK Par, it's fine," I told her, trying to resume the conversation
stopped from her breaking down. "It's good to get this out, I'm not mad
at you at all and don't think of you as weak. You're a very tough girl
and I'm just as thankful for you in my life." </p>
<p>"Really?" she said through a sob. "This isn't a fib, you're not
using this as an opportunity to try to find my Achilles, my weaknesses?" </p>
<p>"I wouldn't lie," I told her honestly. "You don't know how nervous I
was after you left on the date, hoping you'd get those cues right and
ease off the index cards, and I was hoping that Tristan would see you as
more than a classmate for the first time. I enjoyed helping you get
ready, and the reason I helped you was because I felt extreme guilt over
the kiss. I mean I had good luck with Henry and Lane, so I thought I
could work the same magic with you and Tristan." Her chin felt so soft
against my shoulder, and the dark corner of the gym, still visible to
Taylor, made our surroundings somewhat romantic. The gym lights around
the periphery of the gym floor were turned off with only the middle
bank of lights on, spotlighting tracks on each side of the gym. We were
behind one of the riggings, so very little of the light came towards
us. </p>
<p>I swayed her back and forth, giving her a little more of a break to
calm her down. With <i>Unchained Melody</i> playing, the scene felt
romantic. I kept telling her softly things were OK and I was relieved
she knew about the piano room kiss, not thinking of the boy who used to
be in between us at all as I had her wrap her arms around my back as I
did the same. My fingers were in line with the plunge of her dress, and
she found the courage again to place her hands in line with my waist. It
took a few more moments for her to take her head off my shoulder, but
once she did... </p>
<p>My breath caught, and I was overtaken with her beauty. Her
expressive browns glistened from the cry and little light flowing into
her pupils, and they were wide, looking into mine and forming this
moment I'm not about to forget anytime soon. Her lips glistened in the
little light, and her skin was subdued. I just loved how her mixed
heritage of German and Spaniard genes, along with her Jewish heritage
came together to form such a beautiful girl. She has the Germanic
features in her nose and mouth, the full lips, nose and subdued ears,
but her mother's Spanish ancestry was good for at least one thing; her
skin is so smooth and perfect, so dark. I admit, I love it when Paris
tans, because her body is made for it and she doesn't burn easily.
Madeline and Louise have admitted as such; they tan at a booth and still
have much envy for Par's simple beauty regimen and how she can go from
pink to olive in but a few half-hour sessions. </p>
<p>I can't help but look at her; my mouth dries as the slow guitar and
violin from the current tune pick up at the bridge. She's looking at me
with this look of longing I've never placed before, and she mouths out a
thank you for my caring words and action. It feels like 'the moment',
the time to slowly go in and bring her closer. </p>
<p>I do, pushing her closer towards me as she does the same, we're
becoming drawn to each other again, the magnetism that's given me the
cues before off the chart as her breasts press against my chest, and I
can feel her abdomen deflating and inflating against mine. We're so
close, in dimmed light, her face perfect. </p>
<p>"You look beautiful tonight, Paris," I whisper to her, my lips plump
and needing. I struggle to regain my breath; it's almost as if I needed
her kiss to go on further. </p>
<p>She nodded back at me, her own mouth opening. I haven't felt this
way before, this is so right. I don't want to rush into this, I just
want the moment to carry itself, because I want this to be perfect.
Fireworks, oohs, ahhs, a swooning soundtrack in the background. </p>
<p>"Sometimes you're very peculiar Gilmore," she tells me in her
seductive monotonic murmur, as her nails play with the material on the
back of my dress. "I have to admit however, when I'm with you, I do feel
the way you say I am." Her face moves closer and closer, the moment is
so perfect despite there being ten hours left and my surprise if we win
possibly being ruined if I go through with it. </p>
<p>I wanted it, I wanted it so bad I could almost feel orchids digging
into my back, her perfume getting to me and making me remember back to
Mr. Medina's marriage proposal. Only instead of daisies, I visualize
Paris and I in the middle of the Inn lobby, bunches and bunches of
purple, pink and yellow orchids all over the place. I prepare to bring
her into the kiss slowly, my tongue against the ridge of my lower lip,
she didn't seem scared to move closer and closer. </p>
<p>I could hear her breath, heartbeat, the flow of her blood through my
system as we continued to sway. We were but mere centimeters from each
other, the moment was perfect, nothing had to be acknowledged and we
were about to breach that bold white 'friends and lovers' line that
shouldn't be crossed unless we both thought it was the time, the place,
and the moment to do so... </p>
<p>Then just as I was about to close that last distance, I found my new
arch-enemy at 7:57:15pm in Taylor Doose, and his need to torture us
until the cows come home. All the sudden, the loud scoreboard horn went
off, and where moments before I would have been claiming Paris as more
than a dance partner, the moment that fucking horn went off, she jumped
about four feet backwards in the other direction. </p>
<p>"Oh, now what?!" I complained as she yelled "For the love of God!"
towards Taylor as I got a quick grasp on her left hand to not only keep
her from falling down, but keep us in the contest. The moment was lost,
and though I wanted to shed tears, I couldn't because I had just helped
Paris settle down, I didn't need to go through her having to take care
of me. </p>
<p>Besides, it was time for the one thing every year I dreaded... </p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, get into a single file line along the
basketball sideline behind the red tape, it's time for the Runaround!"
Crap on a cracker, how in good conscience could he do this right after <i>Unchained
Melody</i> and my almost-kissing Paris?! </p>
<p>"Runaround, what's that, what's a runaround? Rory, I need to know,
please tell me, does it involve sudden death?!" The poor guy had made
Paris panic like a chicken in the yard right after it has its head cut
off, and as we raced to join the building crowd at the red line, I
quickly ran it down for her. </p>
<p>"He promised us all he wouldn't do this again this year, but
basically he has us run around the gym for five minutes in a game where
all the couples dance around to one of those bad school square dancing
record songs. If we don't make it past the red line when the horn sounds
we're out of the contest, I'm so sorry, and I would've warned you if I
knew he would've sprung it on us!" I held her hand tightly for dear
life as we got behind Kirk and his partner, and Paris wasn't above
holding back her feelings. </p>
<p>"What a prick!" she shot out. "I thought I liked him, but you're
right Rory, he's an old anal freak." </p>
<p>Kirk looked towards us and tried to defend his former employer 7-10
times over, I forget the exact number. "Hey, that anal freak hired me
when he didn't have to and he organizes this marathon every year young
lady, so show some respect--" </p>
<p>The anger over not kissing Paris at a brim point, I cut Kirk off
before he goaded Paris into a shoving match. "Whatever, put a sock in it
Gleason, you're gonna be here late anyways so what do you have to
complain about, we're trying to beat <b>you</b>!" </p>
<p>Thankfully this shut Kirk up, and we heard the needle drop as Taylor
prepared to start the runaround. A horrible and awful song came out of
the speakers, the kind you find buried way down below in the record
racks at the Bethesda store because no one knows who composed or played
the song because they were embarrassed to play it for infamy in the
first place. </p>
<p>"Everyone, ready on your marks...get set...and go!" </p>
<p>So that's where Paris and I are now, in the middle of the crowd
trying to stay on our feet as we both try to will time faster so this
whole stupid ordeal ends. At least I'm doing it with her and still in
the game, and in retrospect, kissing her in a public venue, be it in a
dark corner of the gym, was better stopped in the long run than if we
had gone through with it. If I do it in privacy later though, we'd be
able to talk it out rather than have some awkward things go down in the
aftermath. Paris is struggling to stay on her feet, and she's hopped on
one foot for a bit, then the other so she could take off her shoes and
chuck them towards the bleachers since they were hurting her feet, she
wasn't prepared for this at all. Thankfully there's no rule against
barefoot dancing, so the only thing I'll have to worry about for the
rest of the night is not stepping on them. I only hope she respects me
in the morning if we get through this all. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, if we do get past 4am, there's now way she's
going to drive home to Hartford in her car, I will not let her go drowsy
and with sore feet. This of course, sets up interesting possibilities
for Sunday morning into the afternoon, keeping her in Stars Hollow.
Looks like I have some more motivation to keep her in the game... </p>

<h4> Paris' POV, 1:40am</h4>

<p>I've always hated the slumber parties that Mads and Louise throw
occasionally, and after a begging session and an impassioned plea to
Sharon to force me to go, I ended up attending. Yes, I like my friends
and I'd wear the bridesmaid dresses for both of them, even if it will
end up being multiple times (And in wedding announcements, Louise Shelby
Grant, followed by multiple other surnames we can't possibly fit in
this article, 65, of Hartford married her 17th beau this Saturday
afternoon...), but I hate slumber parties because they've never done any
slumbering at all. They'd keep me up and by the time Monday rolls
around, I have a heavy sleep hangover that can only be cured with a
triple-shot espresso with a few drops of Jolt cola to spike the caffeine
grammage to a triple-digit level. </p>
<p>I don't take well to routine being interrupted. I usually go to bed
every night except Saturday at 11:20pm or earlier, right after the
channel 3 weather segment on their 11pm newscast (Wiseass sportscasters
and water-skiing squirrels insult my intelligence). On Saturday I get a
little wild and stay up until 12:45am, just before the last two skits of <i>Saturday
Night Live</i> start and kill the rest of the show. By midnight on
Saturday my eyelids are heavy, begging to be rested, and it takes pure
adrenaline to keep my eyes on my computer screen as I put the last
completing touches on my schoolwork, and in the background the
wonderful comedienne Tina Fey sparkles in her <i>Weekend Update</i>
segment. </p>
<p>As I was saying though, something out of the ordinary, and my
sleeping schedule takes a few days to readjust. After a Madeline/Louise
slumber party, I fall right into my bed when I get home and sleep until
my mother yanks me out of bed and forces me to accompany her to whatever
social ego-stroke she's found to hobnob with the Hartford elite, where
she hopes my interest in a boy gets piqued and I set up a date with one
of them. </p>
<p>Never has happened of course, you should know that from Vance
Beardsley II's four-year sojourn to get into my pants. Of course, the
odds that it will happen are pretty slim right now, considering I
outright admitted my infatuation with Rory suddenly to Ms. LaCosta a few
hours ago. </p>
<p>I'm still feeling wide-awake tonight though, completely aware of my
surroundings. It's as if karma is again at work trying to make me see
how important Rory is in my life, keeping my eyes wide open. It could
have something to do with having to dance barefoot though, since I
chucked my shoes off into the bleachers during that Roundabout thing
Taylor roped us into. Rory and I came within moments of being eliminated
at the end of it and only by widely striding across the line with my
feet before that infernal horn went off again and 52 couples behind the
line got taken out of the competition, did we stay in. Please tell me
what I saw in respecting Taylor Doose the few other times I visited the
town. I thought he was a good authority figure, but nineteen hours into
a contest he's warding over, he's become a pain in my side. </p>
<p>Rory however...is single-handedly keeping me sane. I would've left
long ago if someone like Brad was my dancing partner because we're
always at each other's throats, and not in that David/Maddie <i>Moonlighting</i>
unresolved sexual tension way either; I just don't like him. There was a
part of me who thought I'd be inexperienced and wouldn't make it through
the evening, but there I was, still on my toes, relatively awake. </p>
<p>I was also still spinning from almost giving into temptation and
kissing Rory before the horn went off for Roundabout. We were both in
this dim corner of the gym, and after I finished crying myself out from
admitting she was so important to me, I found myself looking at her and
finding the right moment to silently let her know my feelings. I thought
she looked at me the same way, as I felt my body attract against hers.
Her slim form against mine, hands lower against each other than any
point in the endeavor; everything about the scene was perfect and I
could feel her ease into me, until Taylor's horn shook me back into
reality with a huge shock in my system. I jumped back abruptly from
her, and though I really, really wanted the kiss, maybe it's better to
wait. </p>
<p>For one thing, it was in a gym packed with people, and for another,
I don't know how she feels. If I kissed her then, she might be
embarrassed and run away. Or worse, I'd end up her newest Georgia
Porgie, making her bawl as past memories came to mind and she fled from
my grasp. Every first kiss it seems with her, she runs away, confusing
the heck out of the recipient, and it takes a bit to make sure that the
kiss was for better or worse. </p>
<p>I have a feeling I'll kiss horribly, so I better not. I want her to
stay with me, and if she doesn't want to kiss me, I'll have to accept
that. So I just try to get out any information through the dance I can
push out of her, and in turn, she probes me for more answers to my
mystery, my life, what makes me tick. The artificial barriers we've kept
up around each other, the distrust in the past that can be compared to
the epic battle of AT&amp;T vs. MCI to keep things secret so one
doesn't get an unknowing leg up on the other, those are gone as the
night goes on, and we find more space with every half hour to spread
our dancing out on the floor. At 7pm, we were still stuck in our
intimate box above the three point curve. At 1am, we have almost the
entire east free throw circle to ourselves. In the last hour the town's
ambulance crew has been bouncing back and forth between the town clinic
off Constellation Circle on the north side of town and the high school
as several couples couldn't take the stress anymore and fainted to the
ground below. A few did it gracefully, but more often than not a hard
thump would be heard as a head, nose, or rump hit the hardwood and Ms.
LaCosta asked out the paramedics once again to bring them to the clinic
and treat them for exhaustion and/or dehydration. </p>
<p>The thing with Rory and I however, we conserved our energy and
didn't try to do too much, only going for the risky moves when Kirk was
trying to hard to impress the crowd. In the meantime, we kept on dancing
with the pace of the music conservatively as we kept talking and
talking to make the hours go faster. It felt so wonderful, and the
Tristan topic opened up a whole avenue of possibilities. </p>
<p>"Who really was your first kiss?" I asked her, and though she tried
to play coy and avoid the question, eventually she relented and told me
that back in third grade, a boy in her class named Ty Verona had a huge
crush on her, and it was Valentine's Day. Her box, being the class
smartie, had enough valentines, but not enough to be considered a big
haul. </p>
<p>"Ty was different though," she remembered. "He made this homemade
card with elbow macaroni, lace borders, practiced cursive, and multiple
layers of construction paper, for a boy his age it was well put together
and he did it all by myself. So I thanked him after school, and because
I was in a giving mood, I decided why not, I'll kiss him." </p>
<p>"Was it a nice introduction into the world of boys?" </p>
<p>"He wanted to only give me the valentine, not anything more. I
kissed his cheek, and he ran away screaming 'Gilmore just kissed me,
ewwwwww, yucky!' I tried to apologize, but I guess since I got what he
wanted wrong, he decided he didn't like me anymore. It wasn't really a
kiss to remember, but a nice and funny memory." Her eyes darted towards
me, and I became the deer in the headlights. "I have a feeling your
first kiss wasn't Tristan though, you never said he was Gellar." </p>
<p>"Yes I did, I--" A few moments later, I remembered that I had never
said that. "I guess I didn't." I rolled my eyes and prepared for my
humiliation. "I'm warning you now, you laugh and after this is over I'll
be wearing a Stop and Shop bag on my head to school Monday morning." </p>
<p>"I will not," she insisted. "Can't be any worse than my story." </p>
<p>"It's awkward though." </p>
<p>She smiled at me. "I felt awkward telling my story, so go ahead and
spill, you have a fellow weirdo dancing here." </p>
<p>"Fine," I said, sighing and relaying the details of my first kiss.
"A boy I used to know, Clarence Norwood was playing doctor with me when
we were five at my home. We were good friends back then and were, let's
just say curious about how things ticked. He had the stethoscope, I was
the patient, and well...you know how patients are dressed with doctors." </p>
<p>"So a nightgown?" She answered. I nodded back. </p>
<p>"Care Bears, I had a phase where I liked those infernal toys back
then." I rolled my eyes and continued. "We were in my playroom, and he
was asking if I was hurting somewhere, so I said I had a painful tooth.
My first teeth were starting to come in and push out the baby teeth, so
I was raking it in with the tooth fairy. Instead of playing dentist
though, he asked me if it really hurt. I said yes it did, and then he
told me, 'My mom kisses boo-boos and it makes me feel better'." </p>
<p>"A few days earlier I had seen a movie on television with French
kissing, so I was interested in how it felt, which is why I said my
tooth hurt. Moments later, he was bending down, and I told him to rub my
sore tooth with his tongue. So he did that, we started kissing..." </p>
<p>"Even back in your younger days you were smart, suckering a boy into
Frenching you." She laughed, and I finished the story. </p>
<p>"We did that for a couple of minutes, and it felt really good. At
least until Mrs. Norwood came in and saw her son on top of me, his hand
on my leg trying to brace himself and my cries of 'More please Clarence,
cure my pain!'. You can only imagine how it looked to Mrs. Norwood, and
after tearing Clarence off of me, she lectured him and told him not to
copy his 'lecherous daddy'. I cried that I started it and we were just
playing doctor, but she had none of it. After that, I never saw the boy
again and got grounded by Mother for three weeks. Figures that I'd get
the only boy I really ever kissed in trouble and lose him." </p>
<p>"Paris, you little harlot!" she said to me, a bright beaming smile
and hearty laugh coming from in-between those lips. "I can see it now, a
little you in pigtails...'Clarence, my toof hurts, kiss the pain away
and make it feel better!'." She went into hysterics, and I had to admit,
though I was flushing a beet red shade after sharing that tale, it felt
good to do that. "Oh my God, that story just made my year...and I just
thought of a new nickname for you." </p>
<p>"Four year-old whore?" I thought aloud. </p>
<p>"No, Par-Bear, because you like the Care Bears, and Bear rhymes with
Par, and it rolls off the tongue so nice." About this point I wanted to
be in a hole somewhere because my respected and beautiful name was
turned into a rhyme on par with that of a nursery rhyme. I mean
Par-Bear? My first thought was of utter disgust with the name, it
sounded like something Puff Daddy came up with for his newest discovery
to add to his stable of rappers, it sounded so dumb coming from other
voices in my mind. </p>
<p>Leave it to my imagination to turn a joke from Rory into a quick
flash of something that made me remember why I was in this damned gym in
the first place. Us, together in her bed, talking like a couple of
girls in love in very subdued voices, her hand playing with my hair as
she told me "You're my Par-Bear." Then me closing the distance, saying
something really romantic and wouldn't be caught saying at my locker to
her between classes, with the thought degenerating into something dirty
in a rapid space of time. </p>
<p><i>Oh dear</i>, I thought to myself, <i>she found a pet name for me</i>.
Rory was the only one I'd let call me Par in the first place, and I was
probably an exception to cutting her name from 'Lorelai the Third' to
'Rory', all the way down to 'Ror'. I couldn't come up with anything to
rhyme with that just then, but where a few weeks ago I might have
thought of something else to quash the thought, I thought her naming was
very cute. God, I'm turning into a lovesick sap, I think I need to read
a little Machiavelli later to balance things back out! </p>
<p>"I guess I'm flattered," I told her, looking both ways to make sure
no one heard her use of the name. She had this smirk on her face that
was turning me into jelly, but I had to stay a little firm. "But just
keep that name confined to the both of us in a room alone, will you? I'd
like to keep the <i>Le Pitbull</i> thing going in the newspaper
office." </p>
<p>"Consider it done." She rested her hand against my back, and leaned
into my shoulder a bit, yawning lightly. "What time is it again?" </p>
<p>"About 10 minutes after one." </p>
<p>"I thought it was later, like around 3:30, I knew I should've taken
advantage of that last break and refueled." Her eyes seemed a little
heavy, and from what I remembered from the midnight break, she didn't
really do that much except stretch out her feet and ate a sandwich from
Mrs. Kim's food booth, along with me. Not a good decision in hindsight
and we should've eaten the hot beef sandwiches offered by Gypsy instead.
Mrs. Kim's food was the very definition of roughage, 'egg' salad
sandwiches not actually made with actual eggs, but the egg yellow
substitute that comes in milk cartons and doesn't actually taste all
that eggy. Rory and I ate it though, desperate for any sustenance we
wouldn't find in a glaze-coated doughnut. </p>
<p>Then I remembered what she didn't have on that break... </p>
<p>"Wait, you forgot to have coffee?" </p>
<p>"After midnight it's counterproductive to drink, and in my
experience caffeine does strange things to my tummy at night." She
blushed adorably, and felt kind of bad for her. </p>
<p>"You're going to be up with me late though, and if you did get sick
you still have your yellow card." </p>
<p>"True, I guess I didn't really think much about things except feet
sore, belly needing food." Rory then yawned a little deeper, and her
eyes weren't wide and bright like they usually were, instead worn out,
with the dim gymnasium lighting and her biological clock getting to her.
She's probably stayed up late with Lorelai many times, but at least
then she was on a couch not expecting any physical activity. Here
though, tiredness would be deadly. </p>
<p>With our position on the free throw line, and 13 couples still in,
the focus from the crowd was less on us, and more on the experienced
dancers in the room. After a 22/20 couple found their shoelaces untied
and took a tumble together, that left Rory and I, a young 18 and older
17 respectively, the youngest two still on the floor. Taylor wasn't
keeping an eye on both of us, preferring his pony in Kirk and his
partner to cross the line, along with two other duos he hoped would at
least place and show. </p>
<p>Rory was looking pretty tired, and I was getting unsure she'd be
able to make it without some help. The yellow card was still in her
pocket, but I told her earlier to keep it until at least 4:30 so we
could get a good awake shot at winning it all since I thought Kirk would
pull his out at 3:30, and his partner shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>My concern for this hour though was getting her through the hump in
hour nineteen, where most metabolisms usually give out and succumb to
slumber. I made it just fine through consuming nothing but high-carb
foods from the deli platter and dessert tray in the break at 6pm, but
Rory without Luke's hamburgers and chili fries is like taking away
whatever illegal bodybuilding substance Jason Giambi uses to pound
baseballs into the right-field seats at the Stadium; it put her at a
competitive weakness. All that cheese and Angus beef usually keeps her
charged up into late, but without her usual dinner, Rory was sluggish
and tired. </p>
<p>I looked at her, she seemed resigned to the fact she'd slump down
soon and come to eye level with my cleavage a couple feet down my body.
She hummed the song playing to herself to try to keep her brain
stirring, but that wasn't doing much at all either. Hey eyes struggled
to stay open, synapses misfiring and wanting to give into sleep. </p>
<p>She did look lovely though. I looked down at her as she settled
against my sternum, struggling to keep herself bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed. I remembered back those few weeks before when I drove to
her house to apologize, and ended up sleeping with her in bed; I watched
her for ten minutes as she closed her eyes and fell into REM. She
looked so precious, innocent, a girl uncaring about what her life has
been. She smiles in her sleep and occasionally tosses and turns towards
the cold side of the pillow, her brown hair spread all over. Of course,
her being Rory she never snores, but instead softly exhales and inhales
as her brain winds it's activity down for a few hours. It was then I
realized how much I wanted that scene to be repeated in the future, for
a few minutes later I settled against her and fell asleep without
worries or fears inside of me. </p>
<p>"Rory?" I asked softly, and she immediately tried opening her eyes
wide. </p>
<p>"Honestly, I wasn't falling asleep, I promise." She was in a panic
and tried to hide it, but I wouldn't accept her excuse. So I brought her
closer to my right shoulder, threading my fingers through her locks and
soothing her like she had me in Russian Novels. </p>
<p>"Shhhh, it's OK, I'll keep you propped up, go ahead and catch a
couple of winks," I gently said, trying to ease her against me. Her
voice was a little tired, but still full of thoughts. </p>
<p>"But I can't fall asleep, I'll lose..." </p>
<p>"If Taylor comes by I'll rub my hand against your side to wake you
up, and if you really start to nod off I'll do something a little more
extreme." Oh yes Par, signal that you really want her to fall asleep so
that the only way to make her more awake than coffee through an IV is to
squeeze your hand around the area of her rear. </p>
<p>Not that all this time spent getting to know her back has tempted me
to get ahold of her ass. I promise you I've never thought about that in
one of my dreams of her, honest. </p>
<p>Alright...maybe a little, in the heat of the moment I think of her
backside and how it would feel cradled in my hands, but now I said too
much so back on topic, she brought her retreating gaze up. Though she
has four inches on me, her head is at my level, meaning that she must be
hurting a little in her back from bending down. </p>
<p>"Really?" She smiled up at me, the word coming out a little lustful,
at least to my ears. I brushed that off as just her voice being tired
and her being unable to control the treble and pitch of it. </p>
<p>"Yeah, promise, I'll keep your feet moving." </p>
<p>Then she said something to me that, if I hadn't been having a hard
crush on her for the last year, still would have turned my stone heart
soft. </p>
<p>Her lashes lowered, and she settled a little lower against the top
of my bosom. Gripping hard against my upper back, she let me sway her
into the music. </p>
<p>"Thanks," she moaned out. "I like it when you're being gentle; it
shows that you have a true heart under all this stuff Par." </p>
<p>Shortly after that, she closed her eyes, left any way I might have
to answer her in the air, and I started soothing her into a temporary
slumber. I was numbed by her words before she closed her eyes that she
thought of me as maternal. I never could picture myself that way though,
what with the crappy job my mother's done on me. This is one of the
reasons I numbed myself around boys; I can't handle the pressures of
sex to begin with, and knowing its true purpose, to procreate, scares
me to death. When I was twelve, I tried to babysit for a neighbor, but
after two gigs I gave it up after being overwhelmed. The child I took
care of was under a more casual style of parenting, and bringing in the
daughter of someone who rode her child hard, wasn't a good idea. I
tried being stern and tough, and ended up feeling like I was mean
instead, making the poor boy cry when I asked him to eat his veggies,
otherwise I'd take away his Game Boy and not let him watch <i>Pokemon</i>
for a punishment. I gave in and let him eat only a little, but all that
confirmed to me is Sharon got damned lucky I didn't become an
out-of-control teenage girl; another kid may have rebelled very early
from her influence. </p>
<p>That she is my mother makes me scared to have a child. What if I <b>become</b>
my mother, treat my kid as if their only purpose is to claim prestige
for our bloodline or live out things in my childhood I couldn't do? For
the longest time I cared about no one but myself, my grades, maintaining
the Gellar legacy, and hoping nothing would get in my way. </p>
<p>It's funny how in the space of 26 months you go from that to longing
for the love of a girl you were convinced was to be seen as an enemy.
Rory was the reverse of what I am; a girl who cares, doesn't hog the
glory, loves her parents and her town, and doesn't throw a tantrum when
things don't go her way, picking herself right up and hoping for the
best next time. </p>
<p>Yes, I'm not including the day she went off on me during the
Shakespeare test in that description. If you slept in a chair with a
tabletop as your pillow, overslept, found a deer deciding to go all
Pamplona on your bumper at a four-way stop, then found you didn't make
it in time for the test, you wouldn't exactly be flowers and sunshine
either, would ya? After multiple iterations of that story, and finally
seeing for myself antler marks in the door of her mom's Jeep, I believe
her, why would she make up a lie so elaborate in the first place?
Besides in retrospect, looking disheveled, tired and sort of annoyed,
along with her yelling at me after I quipped she was a loser...sometimes
I egg her on just so I can get another lovely dose of that sexy
attitude the fair Miss Gilmore doles out occasionally. </p>
<p>She's laying against my chest right now, and to all the world she's
just breathing into it, taking in each and every note of the romantic
song as the late night minutes go by. The temperature outside is
unknown, but I assume that it's getting below 45&#176; since the loud
boom of the heating system just kicked in over us on the ceiling above,
blowing warm air below. Her arms are hooked against mine to keep herself
braced, hands just below the bottom of the exposed back of my dress.
I'm looking down at Rory, nuzzling against the soft rayon material and
think to myself how lucky I am that I've gotten so far in so little
time. She looks so beautiful, at ease with herself, trusting my fate in
my accommodating hands. I run a hand through her hair around where her
hairband comes together, the brown strands like silk. It's losing a bit
of the curliness it had through the day and most of the night and
returning to its naturally smooth texture, however the rose she came
with, stem buried deep so it doesn't fall out, is sticking in there
stubbornly. </p>
<p>I feel the rise and fall of air in her diaphragm against my other
hand, currently on her back. The music is soft, the atmosphere easy
going, and everyone would kill Taylor if he tried the Roundabout so late
in the evening. Taylor is giving me a suspicious look, but I've hidden
Rory's face and kept her feet shuffling enough to throw him off.
Meanwhile Kirk and his partner continue to try to impress despite the
fact it is a timed competition, and everyone in the crowd (all 55 of
them, come on, it's 1:20 in the morning, who could sit through 24 hours
of a dance marathon? Paint-drying has more drama than this!) still looks
at them as if they're going to win the whole thing. </p>
<p>If there's overtime for this and we aren't out by six, Rory and I
are still going to be in this. Hopefully she's getting a few minutes of
good rest, enough to last her until 4:30am and our break. For this
moment though, I'm humming along to a song from the late 90's being
played since Ms. LaCosta has decided to take over the music stand and
spin the tunes. The chorus of the songs seems appropriate, I remember it
as being by Nina Gordon and being a slight hit a few years ago on the
radio. It's such a soft song, and the lyrics describe how I feel dead
center in my heart... </p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>Gleaming in the dark sea, <br/>
I'm as light as air, <br/>
floating there breathlessly,</p>
  <p>When the dream dissolves I, <br/>
open up my eyes, <br/>
I realize, </p>
  <p>That everything is shoreless sea, <br/>
A weightlessness is passing over me...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't feel like I'm in a public school's gymnasium anymore,
sharing the same floor as the basketball teams and required gym class
kickball games. There's just myself, dancing to the beat as Rory nuzzles
deeper into my neck. All I can see around us is darkness, almost a
scene out of those movies where the only light in the room is a small
spotlight highlighting the both of us on the floor. She's so beautiful,
and I can't help but mouth the chorus of <i>Tonight, and the Rest of
My Life</i> to myself. </p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>I feel so light, <br/>
this is all I want to feel tonight,</p>
  <p>I feel so light, <br/>
tonight and the rest of my life...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's only four hours and forty minutes to the end, but I could stay
like this forever, being Rory's personal pillow. If only she knew what
everything she's done in the last few weeks has been do to me, what
thoughts I've had of her and I. </p>
<p>I can feel it in my bones; we're no longer friends anymore, in that
normal sense that's defined by Webster's Dictionary as 'one attached to
another by respect or affection'. No, this is going beyond that, into
something unknown, a space between that and confidant. Fights no longer
break us up for long periods of time, and a sense of absence overtakes
us both when we stray away from each other. Rory's uneasiness around me
before, which kept her from taking what we have away from the brick and
limestone walls of Chilton Academy, is long disappeared, never to come
back. </p>
<p>Tonight I've learned something about myself; if there was a choice
between Harvard and Rory, I'd choose her, every time. There are no
doubts about that, and as the song says, soothing Rory is something I
want to do not only tonight, but for as long as I live. </p>
<p>Hopefully Rory knows that... </p>

<h4> Rory's POV, 5:54am</h4>

<p>It's funny how you can remember those important moments in your life
where things you knew were dependable, suddenly they've either changed
for the better, or for the worst. In my life so far, it's small things,
like the moment I read in the newspaper that ABC decided to pull <i>My
So-Called Life</i> because of low ratings, leaving those entire plot
holes open forever. The summer day in 1998 I taught the team I had been
rooting for since my mother bought a small kid's jersey for me, the
Hartford Whalers, were moving to North Carolina. A girl in my sixth
grade class had been diagnosed with leukemia a year before, causing the
entire town to dedicate an entire festival to her so they could send her
up to Farber in Boston and hope she'd be able to get into remission
enough to resume her life. </p>
<p>Some of them are just wacky, like when Taylor thought putting in a
traffic light was a good idea. The crosswalk sign for dummies, along
with the defective timer and no real need for a stoplamp days later, so
that when he pulled it out things were back to normal. Those few days it
was in though, Stars Hollow was agog with this weird talk about how a
traffic light would turn our nice little town into the next
Bloomington, Minnesota, complete with replica of the Mall of America and
international airport. Funny how technology, even from the early part
of the 20th century can change a town all the way in 2001. </p>
<p>I think the memory of this town, at least for the year 2002, will be
the dance marathon where the unthinkable happened. </p>
<p>Pigs and penguins are currently flying outside on the town square,
the devil himself is trying to warm up the underworld since the
temperature suddenly plunged, and there's this weird sense of change in
the air of my little corner of the world. I can hear Howard Cosell's
call in my head, changed around a little to fit this event where we just
went through the shock of our lives. </p>
<p>"Down goes Gleason! Down goes Mondrawski! They're both down on the
ground separated and in a state of utter shock, the gym is under a state
of pandemonium right now. I can't believe, what I just saw!" </p>
<p>It's unbelievable; seven minutes ago, Paris and I were on the floor,
trying to outstep the hell out of Kirk and his dance partner, Carrie
Mondrawski. Things had become even more heated between the four of us
after the 4:30am break Paris and I yellow-carded into. Within about a
half hour the third to last couple was off the floor under the strict
orders of the nurse, leaving Paris and I, along with Kirk and Carrie as
the last two couples standing on the floor. Within moments, things
became more heated. </p>
<p>Miss Patty took herself out of the DJ booth, leaving Taylor free to
play his 'last hour' mix disc, a platter filled with some of the
toughest dance moves and songs he could come up with and honed over the
years from many of Kirk's wins. Each year was tougher on the tootsies,
each dance a complex number of steps and beats that had to be timed just
right so that you didn't get the thumb. After the comfy resting up
against Paris I took for about a half hour a few hours before, we got
right back to business, trying to keep our endurance and adrenaline
high, and errors low. She found her way back into her shoes during my
yellow card break, and from there focused on keeping things right. </p>
<p>Her experience started to shine through in this last hour as I saw
her turn from her normal mild-mannered and academic self, into the
dancing equivalent of a rowing instructor. "1, 2, 3, 4, and left 2, 3,
4, come on Gilmore, follow my lead, don't stray from the script!" was
her rallying cry, as Taylor found songs that were faster, full of sudden
shifts in tempo and could throw off even the most professional dancer,
which Carrie just happened to be. She and Kirk stayed in the game as we
watched them navigate the slippery slope, trying to keep the focus on
things. </p>
<p>The first 22:50? Child's play compared to what we had to deal with
after 4:50am. Swings, complicated steps, loops, all were in play as
Paris tried to keep my head in the game. I found my skirt spinning
around like it hadn't before then, while her modus operandi seemed to
try to keep her chest reined in. I made sure to help her retie the knot
in back so it wouldn't suddenly fall out mid-move, something that made
me tingle from the movement, yet I had to keep my game face on so I
tried to make sure that it didn't show. </p>
<p>Secret's protection was quickly fading as 23:15 on the clock hit and
we both started sweating like we never did before. Paris' face was
coated in perspiration, which dripped relentlessly from her forehead,
and made keeping a good grip against her side a challenge because her
underarms were doing the same thing. I wish I could say I was glow-free,
but in the stress of swings and moves that made my heart pump blood
like it never could I ended up with my own sheen of sweat. Our hair was
all soaked up and heavy against our heads, so as a consequence I had
her pull out my hair tie, leaving what was curly hair when I came in
the gym so many hours before slowly going straight right before Paris'
eyes. </p>
<p>Kirk and his partner kept trying to outdo us and go off-script, as
he tossed Carrie in the air and caught her on the fly with an arm just
in time, the crowd still there applauding wildly with each new attempt
to usurp our 'slow and steady wins the race' style of dancing. By about
5:20, the fur started to fly, along with the trash talking. </p>
<p>"Looks like you and your partner are too chicken," Carrie yelled
towards Paris. "C'mon blondie, what's stopping you from making your gal
fly?" </p>
<p>Paris somehow reined herself in from that crude blondie insult,
gritting her teeth and going on. "I don't want her to fly, we're in this
to win, not impress a select few town individuals. Didn't you get the
memo; I was a state dance champion back in my day." </p>
<p>"Says the woman dancing with the offspring of two left-foot
Gilmore!" Kirk shot back. "Guess we can't blame the heels this time,
just Rory's complete lack of any dancing experience. Face it Paris,
she's coasting along on your long gone glory days!" </p>
<p>My eyes widened; I was no glory hog, all I was hoping for was a
little bonding time with Par! That she was good back when she was ten
helped my choice in making her the Astaire to my Rogers, but it
certainly wasn't the only factor in play, very low on my list. Before
she could say anything, I jumped in. </p>
<p>"At least I'm not paying my partner cash to dance; without the green
you'd be solo Kirk!" I stopped the thought, letting it hang in the air.
It would've been bad form to take the talking into territory where I
called Carrie a glorified escort, plus she didn't seem the type to be
like that. </p>
<p>"Hey, if you were offered $1,000 for showing up, you'd do it!"
Carrie let me know of that. </p>
<p>"My father makes $1,000 just walking into a room," Paris piped in,
"and his skills won't go away if he say...breaks an ankle." Ouch, score
a point for Par on that one; way to wound the girl's pride! She smirked
at Carrie, who looked as if she wanted to invent a move with Kirk that
would be right at home in the WWE by tossing his body at us while
holding on to him. </p>
<p>"Leave the nice lady alone," Kirk whined, "she's done nothing to you
two!" </p>
<p>"Except to keep us from winning," I told him. "You win this every
year, can't you let someone else take the title for once? You're like
the Lakers of competitive small-town dancing, some of us don't like you
sucking the drama out every single year!" </p>
<p>The argument went on for a few minutes over the blare of the music,
until Miss Patty finally felt that Kirk was egging us on enough and told
him and Carrie to move back to their side of the line while we stayed on
ours. The music continued to speed up in tempo, and Paris at times felt
like this was a very tough challenge for her. </p>
<p>"Rory, next time you ask me what's harder, a brain-scrambling
admissions test or a 24-hour dance marathon, remind me that at least the
admissions test only challenges the mental rather than physical
fitness." Her face was beet red and she looked to be in the first stages
of exhaustion. She seemed to be burning off any calories from the tea
and food and any minute, I felt she would collapse. However, the nurse
was keeping an eye on everyone and hadn't found a reason to declare her
medically unfit to continue. </p>
<p>The crowd became a blur; there weren't many left and most of them
were random people in the town I didn't know that well at all; some
outsider kids looking for a different after-midnight place to hang out
at besides the Route 70 IHOP, older citizens who want to recall the good
old days, a couple of writers and photographers from out of town
newspapers looking for an odd story to fill a couple pages in their
accent sections. It was a real cross-section of oddities sitting in the
crowd, with very few recognizable people I knew mixed in. No Lane though
(she went to bed after selling her last non-egg sandwich at 11:30), and
thankfully no sign of Dean, or his buddies. This time he was the one
trying to avoid me after Jess' threats and the finality of my speech
breaking off the relationship. I'm thankful for that because with Paris
scared for me around him, I didn't want to have to face him so soon,
and especially when I'm trying to sort out my loving feelings for the
girl in my arms. </p>
<p>I started thinking about Paris' physical condition, and in the rush
of wanting her to be my dance partner, happened to forget one important
detail; what would she do after the dance? </p>
<p>Being 5:30am, I couldn't fathom sending her back home in her car.
She looked ready to fall asleep any minute from her screwed-up
biological clock, shoulders slumped, her small body weighing a lot in my
arms and that burden directed down towards me. Though she kept a tough
fa&#231;ade, it was obvious sleep was fighting her for attention. </p>
<p>"Par, are you staying here in town after the competition?" I asked,
my voice tired. </p>
<p>Her answer, ten minutes removed from the bicker-down with Kirk and
Carrie, was slurred and made her sound more Rocky after ten rounds than
intelligent private schoolgirl. </p>
<p>"No, I figure we'll celebrate, and then I'll hop in my car and go
home." </p>
<p>"You sure you're fit to drive?" </p>
<p>"Of course, I'll live. The roads are empty enough anyways." </p>
<p>That wasn't a good enough excuse for me to back off. She was clearly
tired, and I couldn't live if I ended up taking a panicked call from
Louise asking why the hell she was watching footage of a maroon Jaguar
crushed as if it was an accordion into the back of an SUV on channel 8's
Sunday morning news, the blue 'HVD BND' letters of her license plate in
the shot's foreground. That, and her Boston trip excuse might not hold
water if her mother happened to come home from San Diego earlier than
expected and found her daughter in a vintage ball gown. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the sense of dread that came with Paris coming
into Stars Hollow has long disappeared, the crush I have for her moving
into the stage where you can't stand the weekends and weeknights you
spend away from the object of your affection. This dance has been a
close bonding experience, and I would be thankful if she'd be able to
spend a few more hours with me... </p>
<p>Even if we were sharing a bed, asleep. The off-the-cuff sleepover we
had in February, she found herself on the couch and woke up a grumpy
Gus, not being used to sleeping on such a thin surface with only a throw
pillow to rest her head on. A few weeks ago though, my small bed was
just enough and led to a surprisingly peaceful sharing of the bed
between Paris and I. </p>
<p>"I don't want you on the road back to Hartford, you can stay with
me," I suggest aloud. "You've been up for at least 25 hours straight,
most truck drivers would have their heads on a platter for keeping
themselves up that long since they have to sleep every twelve hours.
Par, you'd be insane to think you're OK enough to drive." </p>
<p>This led of course, to another problem altogether, which was
surprising coming from the girl always prepared for any scenario of
dread. </p>
<p>"I'd like to, but there's a problem. There was a small part of me
that didn't think we'd get this far, and I didn't expect this
invitation, so I didn't bring anything to sleep in." </p>
<p>If the pleasure center of my brain wasn't overcharged with all those
hours dancing with Paris before, it was on red alert after she told me
that. I expected her to at least have something in the back of her car
to wear, thinking of almost any scenario that might happen. Hell, if
there was a chemical explosion a few miles out of town, she might offer
me a gas mask. </p>
<p>No, I didn't forget what she was wearing. Or to be fair, the lack
thereof that wasn't on her person. No bra beneath, the only other thing
besides the essentials of dress and undies she was wearing was her
jacket before she came in. </p>
<p><i>Oh God!</i> my conscience butted in. <i>She'll have to sleep in
the nude, and after all this touching and my hormones on overdrive.</i> I
took myself out of my thoughts for a bit, and the look on that mug of
hers brought me right back in. <i>Damn it, there she goes with her
little serene smile that haunts those dreams I don't share with anyone,
keep yourself together Gilmore!</i> </p>
<p>I think she was realizing the ramifications of my offer as she got
that look where you knew she was about to come up with a plan. My mind
felt dizzy, wishing to connect with her ESP-style to figure out what she
was coming up with. </p>
<p>"Rory, I couldn't do that to you, I'd be imposing," she told me in a
caring way. "You need a day off after dedicating yourself to this dance
for the last few days--" </p>
<p><i>Get her back!</i> My mind was screaming, mixing in with a heated
image of Paris and I on my bed as I helped her untie the back of her
dress, then her doing the same with the zipper in my back. Mind you,
trying to think of unzipping Dean's fly in a dream once freaked the
everlasting daylights out of me, but the very idea of Paris and I, in a
bed together after an event like this, I felt ready to ask Taylor to
play a tango and for myself to submit to her, willing to do <b>anything</b>.</p>
<p>Once again, my mother is the moral center in my life, and the very
thought of doing things too fast, in my own house where I couldn't even
fathom even kissing a boy unless it was on the porch, made me reel back
180&#176; from the thoughts enflamed. </p>
<p>"Actually it'll be fine, I'm sure my mom won't mind if I borrowed
you some pajamas, honest. I just care that you get home safe and sound,
and driving home at this point wouldn't be an Einstein-class decision by
any means. We're both tired and ready to plop, so we'll agree to
disagree and you'll just stay over." </p>
<p>"But my--" </p>
<p>"Your car will be fine Par." I knew what she'd be asking and went
through the statistics all over again. "It's Sunday and they do plan
this in advance so that parking is for two days, not just until six this
morning. If they did that, there would be so many crashes pulling back
onto Roscoe Street from the field caused by sleep deprivation." </p>
<p>"So whenever I get up to go home and walk back here," she asked,
trying to wrap herself around this concept. "My Jag is still going to be
near second base, untouched, clean as a whistle and ready to be driven
home?" </p>
<p><i>Paris, oh Paris</i>, I thought to myself. <i>I just want to slap
you silly sometimes. This isn't Hartford, where everyone ignores the
wailing of your car alarm because in the end, it probably went off just
'cause some guy brushed the bumper on the way into work. There's only
two ways in to the heart of town; north and south, and you can depend on
a few souls to see that a short blonde girl isn't speeding back north
towards the capital city, no one here could steal your car if they
tried.</i> </p>
<p>Still, I didn't want to start a silly argument over the fate of her
automobile. A compromise was needed instead. </p>
<p>"Tell you what; I'll ask Miss Patty if she'll bring by the car to my
house, she lives only a couple blocks away and doesn't mind walking." </p>
<p>"I don't know." Paris seemed a little iffy about the prospect of her
wheels in the hands of someone she didn't know. </p>
<p>"Par, she's fine, trust me. She was my field trip bus driver from
first to fourth grades, and we went in some pretty bad weather to the
pumpkin farm, New York, Providence, wherever we had to go. She's still
sharp on the road and I assure you that your car won't have one single
scratch on it after pulls onto the front drive." </p>
<p>She still seemed a little unsure about this whole thing I came up
with on the spur of the moment to keep her home. We were still dancing
vigorously, the music sort of loud, her mind probably wrapped around the
ramifications of accepting an invitation to my house, wearing clothes
that weren't hers and probably sharing a bed with me. </p>
<p>It was time to get a little devilish, not to mention adventurous. My
right hand was perched just above that unsaid line near the plunge of
her dress, a few inches where I felt that telltale bump that no one had
ever breached I'm sure. </p>
<p>"I'm sure I can trust Ms. LaCosta," she went on, "but my mother is
going to expect me home, I have to figure out how to tell her that
Boston was fine and I found a good sorority--" </p>
<p>I slid a couple fingers down the small of her back, letting the
nails graze against the smooth skin contained. I gauged with the heel of
my hand where the rayon material ended and rounded those fingers around
her back. Already, her thought processes were falling apart from that
simple action. </p>
<p>"...Because, well, you know Rory, it's important to..." She beated
for a moment, trying to find her words again. "You know how important
the Puffs were, so finding the right house in Cambridge is important." </p>
<p>As she rattled on with her talk about housing, I looked up at her
and innocently smirked, just as I found the exact tip of the end of her
dress plunge. My fingertip probed around it, teasing between sliding
beneath the dress or not. </p>
<p>"Oh yes, I know how important housing is, those dorms are really,
really small." Another topic to my advantage. "If we shared a dorm room
there, we'd almost have beds separated by only mere feet, maybe even on
top of each other, a bunk arrangement. Thus, it's your best interest, as
a fifth generation Harvard attendee, to procure the best housing
situation you can find. The right sorority will guide you through the
rest of your life, get you into that cushy metro editor's slot at the <i>Times</i>,
won't it?" </p>
<p>I could see her throat swallow in my gaze, I was thankful to Taylor
for letting up on the music a little bit. "Uh, yes," she spat out as my
fingernail slid against the lining of the plunge. "You hit the nail
right on the head, sorority connections...very important." </p>
<p>"See, you already know enough about it to spin a false yarn that you
were in Boston by memory," I said, my voice getting more slow and
seductive. "Would you rather spend this day getting home after that long
drive, your feet sore, eyes red and worn, warring over what to tell
your mother?" </p>
<p>I slid in the other three forefingers into the plunge, and felt the
soft skin hidden beneath that dress in my grasp. Paris coughed out,
probably in shock as I kept the sway and the charade going, that my hand
was falling into the back of her halter from the effects of sleep. </p>
<p>"Or Par, would you rather walk the few blocks back to my home, where
I'll provide you with pajamas, a nice warm place to sleep without the
threat of your mother going on some insane tirade about how much that
guy she met at Mohegan Sun pleases her, and best of all, some nice
company to go with it?" I licked around my lips with my tongue, turning
on the charm to eleven. </p>
<p>My fingers drifted a little lower, her heartbeat speeding up in my
grasp. She never knew how to really love before, and it's my goal to
show her how it's done. A couple inches here and there as I went forward
with my explanation about why she should stay, along with a promise
that she could even look over my class notes while she was over, which
I protected like the Coca-Cola recipe, for a couple classes she wanted
to get a leg up on. She never usually asked for them, and we had an
unspoken accord that my notes were for my eyes only, and in turn, I
wouldn't look at hers. </p>
<p>"Come on Paris, please?" Flattery hadn't made her move, maybe
begging would. </p>
<p>Just to make sure though, I found the hand in the back of her dress
just brushing up against the waistband of her panties. I didn't intend
to go further, just enough to tease her, clue her in. </p>
<p>"Oh, fine," she gasped out, oxygen seeming to having problems
flowing into her mouth. "I'll stay here, if only so you don't have to
worry about me driving." Mission accomplished, I slipped my hand out,
but still feeling a little on top of the world, kept it right there
above the fabric of her dress. </p>
<p>"Thank you," I said simply. "Now don't we have a dance marathon to
win here? Kirk's looking a little off-center, isn't he?" </p>
<p>We both looked towards him, still going with his wild dance moves
with Carrie, in stark contrast to my closer style with Paris. If only he
realized how silly he looked with that professional dancer. I shook my
head, while Paris laughed softly. </p>
<p>"I think we can take 'em. They can't go on forever, can they?" We
resumed the contest, and for twenty minutes, it seemed like those two
just might go forever. The music sped up once again and there was the
distinct possibility that all four of us could go into overtime. Paris
was still tired, but able to dance unwinded. Everything seemed to be
smoothing out towards one of those dance-offs where the first to miss a
part of a choreographed step would be a loser. We went on, pushing and
pulling into each other, continuing to clock-watch nervously. It was a
contrast in styles, and I couldn't tell you honestly who might win the
whole shebang around 5:30am. Kirk and Carrie both looked exhausted, but
not ready to give up the fight. I felt my heart tighten up with each new
move, the web site-taught dancing long gone and both of us improvising
on a moment's notice. The crowd started coming back into the gym after
napping for a bit, if you could call it a crowd. It was less of a
throng, more of a light scattering across the seats. Oh, what I do for
the pride of the town, a large trophy that'll barely fit on our mantle,
a cash prize of $100 for each partner, and a gift certificate sampler
courtesy of the town's chamber of commerce. Thank God Paris didn't ask
about the prize package, she'd be insulted by how little they give us
for lasting so long. </p>
<p>Which at exactly 5:47am, we learned were now the proud owners of. We
honestly thought Kirk would beat us, Paris and I wore at our breaking
points, hair soaked, legs like jelly, minds worn from figuring out the
appropriate dance for each song. It was one of those 'let's swing for
the boys' songs, and Paris and I were at a weak point since she never
got into that aspect of swing dance. Carrie and Kirk had practiced this
dance each day for the last week, to this same song. We figured it was a
walk in the park for them, and as we twirled around the floor to stay
alive, we were prepared for overtime with Kirk and his pro dance
partner. </p>
<p>Right at the end of the song, however, was where Kirk's dream of
another title was quashed. He had to twirl his partner away from him in
a 360&#176;, then twirl her back towards him until his free hand rested
against her back. This was something I had dreamed about doing with
Paris, and did in a slightly easier 180&#176; variation about five times
through the course of the contest. Seemed really easy, didn't it? </p>
<p>He got the first part right, but the rest shall live in the infamy
of our town's archives. Kirk, instead of staying in the place where he
had been dancing for most of the night, decided to pull off the move in
the most slippery and dead part of the hardwood floor. </p>
<p>'The Spot', as the Minutemen basketball and volleyball teams called
it, was legendary in bringing down the best players of both sports down
on their feet, at least twice in the 80's one player on the Minutewomen
basketball team ended up sprawled and with a strained ankle. No one in
this town can forget the regional championship of '77, where Jake
Vaughn, who was on his way to a guaranteed spot with UConn, ended up
slipping on that same spot, which was missed by the waxer the day before
because The Spot is depressed at least 1/2" from the surface of the
floor. He fell to the ground in a crumple, shattering his Achilles and
ankle at the same time with a hollow thud, along with the town's state
championship title hopes. Since then the custodians took card to
manually wax The Spot, and every gym teacher lectures us to be careful
around it in action. </p>
<p>The Spot ended up claiming a couple a victims this morning. </p>
<p>Kirk prepared to twirl Carrie back, and then without warning, like
Tuesday noon when Paris got up from her seat too fast and slipped in
that slick spot on the classroom floor, his shoes were in The Spot.
Pulling Carrie back shocked his body, and within moments, he found
himself trying to keep his balance. His shoes started to separate, and
both Paris and I happened to witness the whole incident. His shoes
slipped around a little bit, and he found his feet farther and farther
as he tried to keep his steadiness. </p>
<p>Dealing with that, and a returning partner, proved to be his
undoing. Carrie came back towards him at a good clip, her momentum
unable to come to a dead spot. I can pinpoint the exact moment where the
crowd went from cheering, to absolute dead silence as the svelte
redhead's body hurtled towards Kirk. He slipped again, outstretched his
arms, nothing worked. Paris and I kept dancing, unable to decide fate
because the decision to go on was now fully in Kirk's hands. If he
steadied himself, and finished the move, it would be a morale killer,
the crowd would want Kirk and Carrie to win. If not, that was the end.
The situation could go either way, and I hoped he could get his footing. </p>
<p>The left foot was up in the air, and his right was slipping now.
Carrie was only inches away from him, starting to scream his name.
Everyone's eyes were on him to keep that right foot planted on the
ground, somehow... </p>
<p>I could hear the slip the moment that other foot left the ground.
From there, gravity completed its ugly game, playing out the scene where
Kirk fell to the ground, hard on his butt, as Carrie found her grip on
the hand of her partner fade. Her body in motion, with no force there
to stop it, the twirl continued unabated, from a 360&#176;, into a
450&#176;, until the momentum ran out, and with a hard tug, she found her
contact with Kirk, gone. She fell to the hardwood outside The Spot
ready to crumple to the hardwood, giving up and bracing her shoulder
with her hand. Kirk and she were looking eye to eye, and if you saw the
scene closely, you could see the reaction to the end wasn't positive. </p>
<p>They were separated, on the ground, and not dancing. The three rules
of dance marathon had been broken, like a sports dynasty. Paris and I
continued dancing, making sure if some outside force had interfered,
that if we weren't dancing, would be disqualified. She was in just as
much shock as I am, so the only thing we could do was take our minds
off. </p>
<p>Ten seconds later however, Taylor got a ruling from a volunteer ref
watching Kirk and Carrie in their square. The young man gave the thumbs
down, and with Taylor shaking his head in sadness, prepared to announce
the unthinkable result of the 43rd Annual Stars Hollow Dance Marathon. </p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said gravely, as if he was reading the
bulletin denoting the death of a president. "Couple number 67, Kirk
Gleason and Carrie Mondrawski aren't making contact with each other,
dancing on their feet, and have fallen to the ground. This means that
they are out of the competition for failing to stay on their feet." </p>
<p>The words I never expected to hear at all in my lifetime were next
to be spoken. "That means only couple 131, Rory Gilmore and Paris
Gellar, are the only two who remain. They have continuously danced,
except for mandated breaks, for the entire time. With a time of 23
hours, 48 minutes and 7 seconds, they are the winners of this year's
Dance Marathon, congratulations girls." </p>
<p>I could've fainted right there on the floor. Somehow, I, Lorelai
Leigh Gilmore, the girl that sports and proper physical fitness forgot,
had won the town's most coveted competition, fair and square. That
trophy, sitting on the judge's table currently, would soon become my
property, for me to treasure. </p>
<p>Then I looked towards Paris, still dancing in a trance. <i>No, it's
not mine</i>, I told myself. <i>It's ours. Paris and I won this.
Without her I was rowing a canoe with only one paddle. She deserves this
as much as I do.</i> </p>
<p>For the first time in a few days, dancing went right back into the
dusty memory banks, and the mega-watt smile and attitude I have when I
earn something was out there for the world to see. I didn't let go of
Paris, just stopped, expecting her to also stop. </p>
<p>Maybe she went deaf all the sudden, because she was still swaying to
the music being faded out. I think she has that syndrome she had when
the moderator announced we won the debate against Hillside, since she
was still in hyperfocus mode. </p>
<p>"Paris?" I asked her. </p>
<p>"You're not supposed to stop Gilmore, we have to win this." Yeah,
hyperfocus mode. Oh dear. </p>
<p>"We won, you can stop now, this is the end. Kirk fell down, he's
knocked out." </p>
<p>Still nothing from her, she was still trying to get back into the
song. </p>
<p>I hated to do it, but there was only one way to let her know it was
all over... </p>
<p>I pinched her side. No, wait, I didn't, it was more along the small
of her back, though come to think about it where I pinched her was much
lower than that... </p>
<p>OK, fine, I pinched her right on the ass! Not so far in it would be
noticeable, but enough to say "Hello, out of la-la land here!" Yes, I
took her case of space-head as another good opportunity to clue her into
my desire for her, and yes if I had to do this all over again I'd
probably take the same course of action. </p>
<p>"PARIS!!" </p>
<p>She had this funny, yet sort of pissed look, ready to chew me out. </p>
<p>"What the hell is wrong, why did you--" </p>
<p>So I put on my best happy face, and gave her a refresher course on
what happened moments before. </p>
<p>"Uh, we won, it's not a dream. Those two really are down on the
ground, and the contest is over." </p>
<p>She did a take, then another, making it a triple moments later. She
went for four, looking at me, then the fallen competitors. It was as if
that moment was a dream in her head; that fall didn't happen in her view
at all, everything was still normal. After the fifth take, the
realization dawned on her. </p>
<p>"So we're the winners?" she asked, puzzled. "That's it, no more
dancing, Kirk's streak is dead, and we've broken it? You're sure about
this?" </p>
<p>"Yup," I said proudly. "And it's all thanks to you Paris. Without
you here, I may have been sitting in those bleachers over there for
hours and hours." </p>
<p>She was in a state of shock and excitement, all at the same time.
Her smile widened as she realized it was over, relieved and pleased with
her performance. She still couldn't believe it; winning a heated
competition with someone she regarded from our first meeting as the
enemy. </p>
<p>"We won," she said, repeating it again. "We won, we're the
champions." Her grip on my hands tightened, wrapping herself around the
fact. "Oh my God, I've never had to work so hard before for a victory,
and here we are, it's at the crest of dawn, well not even since
astronomical sunrise isn't for another 43 minutes at 6:32, so it's still
technically nighttime here, so why would I say it's almost dawn when it
isn't, I mean come on, it's not dawn unless it's sunrise." She looked
at me, then blushed. "I think I'm acting a little rambly, aren't I?" </p>
<p>"But your point was?" </p>
<p>She quirked one of her eyebrows up, making it look like I was asking
her the stupidest question in the world. "The point is, we won Rory." </p>
<p>"Exactly." </p>
<p>"You know how I feel right now?" </p>
<p>"How?" </p>
<p>She pulled me towards the bleachers, and fainted right onto the wood
seat, bringing me down with her. "I never want to do this again as long
as I live. There has to be a better form of female bonding than killing
my feet from the inside out by doing nothing but dancing for at least 23
hours." </p>
<p>"But you're happy we won, right?" I tried to clarify. </p>
<p>Paris nodded affirmatively, and smiled. "Of course, in the end it
was worth it. This means we can retire from the dance marathon
undefeated." </p>
<p>"Good, because I think already after all of this," I took off my
shoes and let my toes stretch out for the first time in what seemed to
be at least a week. "I won't be defending the title next year. I got
what I wanted out of today, you had a fun time, and we'll be getting a
nice shiny trophy to symbolize that fact." </p>
<p>"How about a bar of Johnson's foot soap instead? That seems a much
more appropriate symbol." she moaned, anguished in pain. Her feet had
taken much of the abuse between the both of us, I wouldn't be surprised
if she would swear at her saddle shoes before she left for school on
Monday. </p>
<p>"It's part of the gift basket," I told her. Just then, our
competitors interrupted our conversation. Kirk was still wincing from
losing the contest, while Carrie seemed to try to avoid any eye contact
with anyone in the gym. Not that anyone outside of here knew what she
did down in New York. </p>
<p>"Paris, Rory." He acknowledged both of us, not sounding very sour.
We looked up at Kirk, and prepared for a tantrum. None ever came. </p>
<p>"I'd like to thank you two for being very worthy competitors, you
both beat me fair and square. Though I won't be having a new trophy from
2002 to join the other eight residing in my case, also known as a
corner of my bedroom, this was the finest effort by far someone put up
against me. Everyone else tried the professional route through the
years, but despite that, my partner and I for the year still won before
5am. I didn't know Paris beyond her role as your tormentor and that
interviewer when I added the Curtain to the video store, along with that
glance at you in competition in your younger years, and have to admit
to you ma'am that your element of surprise kept things interesting this
year. When I fell minutes ago, I was disappointed we wouldn't be
dancing overtime, all four of us, but somehow, you two managed to win a
hard-fought battle. I congratulate you," he pointed at both of us,
"Rory Gilmore, Paris Gellar." He then bowed, which gave Paris this
'what the hell did I get myself into here' look on her face, as I
laughed and thanked him back. </p>
<p>"Carrie, anything to say to the champions?" He ceded the floor to
her, thinking she'd thank us too. Apparently, she came from the dance
school where a defeat ended your career. </p>
<p>"Yeah; bite me. You said this was a guaranteed victory Gleason,
instead my ass is creamed by two high-schoolers with novice experience,
what the hell..." Kirk turned away, wanting to flee his partner. "Where
do you think you're going mister, you have a lot of explaining to do,
what's my daddy going to think when he hears that I lost in some barn
dance in the middle of nowhere--" </p>
<p>Kirk covered his ears, ignoring Carrie as we both recuperated and
talked about how we felt after such a wonderful and cathartic victory.
The Gilmore dance monkey was off my back, Paris was even closer to me
than before and most of all, I had made much progress trying to build a
relationship with her. </p>
<p>There was only one thing to do before we went back to my house and
recuperated from this day filled with twists and turns... </p>
<p>The last dance. I just hope everything goes off without a hitch... </p>

<h4> Paris' POV, 5:58am</h4>

<p>I'm still in shock over this. Never in my wildest dreams did I think
that on my first try, with a little rust on my shoulders from being
inactive in dance for a little less than seven years, that in an
endurance competition with a girl I used to regard with scorn, but now
who I only want to love, we survived and won the whole shebang. Usually
the afterglow from a victory wears off from me after a few hours, since
I usually knew coming in I'd win no matter what. </p>
<p>This win's gonna stay with me for quite a bit longer though. I had
to work my ass off to get this far, and there were a few times through
the day I was absolutely convinced that was it, and I'd give up. That
drama around 7:30 with the mention of Tristan almost killed Rory's hopes
for victory, and had I turned away at that time, I might have been in
my bed, trying to create a distracting dream from the harsh reality of
leaving her behind at the moment she really needed me. </p>
<p>Thank God for Ms. Lacosta though. Without her encouragement and
empowering responses to my fears, there's no doubt that I would have
pushed my feelings permanently away from my heart and went back to
hardly regarding Rory, partly in shame because I didn't try to go for
the goal, and the other part as a sheltering mechanism. I didn't want
her to know how much Tristan got to me. </p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, after being told to get out there and let her
know he was nothing but a memory, Rory and I got so close to closing
that gulf between us and having our first kiss. She looked like she'd
give in to me, and I was prepared to submit to her. Things got in the
way, but after that, things were a lot less draining on me. We talked
about everything under the moon, gave each other those boosts we so
desperately needed in those late hours, and she got her revenge on me,
her fingers finding their way beneath the plunge of my dress, just as I
did with the hemline of her skirt in the car Tuesday afternoon. </p>
<p>Let me tell you, her touch alone on my bare skin almost made me
overheat, then faint. Rory may seem to be this mousy innocent girl who
you think is the perfect angel that never gets adventurous. You would be
dead wrong about that stereotype, Louise's whack-a-mole flirting style
is tame compared to Rory's subtle touching, mooning looks with those
enchanting eyes, and the nervous mannerisms she uses to distract me
from the fact her index finger is running against the exact top of the
waistband of my panties. She kept sliding her hands up and down my body
all night, there is now not an inch on my back that has not gone
untouched by the fair Lorelai Leigh. </p>
<p>We went into this dance as competitors, hoping to have a little fun
and getting to know each other more through the intimate closeness we'd
share. But tonight...pardon me, this morning (What do you call the time
between 5 and 7am anyways, really? You can't call it twilight because
that's reserved for dusk. Whatever...), we're leaving Minutemen
Gymnasium champions. </p>
<p>I still can't believe it. We're both girls who abhor physical
activity, and who don't take well to the spotlight at all. We were both
inexperienced, and in all honesty I was better at solo dance than I ever
was with a partner. I also had this nagging sense that I was there to
fill a role, be where Dean or Lorelai might have been if Ms. Gilmore
wasn't currently in Music City, or Dean if he hadn't overreacted about
how Jess helped Rory squelch the sprinklers. </p>
<p>Then she reassured me about that by instead of saying I, that we won
the competition, together as a team. We both contributed 50% to our
efforts, and that exact mix of fiery want to win, respect and admiration
for the traditions of the past, and not going Namath going in, being
overcocky and saying we were guaranteed to win, that helped us towards
victory. I wasn't in this for the prizes, the glory or trying to use
this as an excuse for an ego-trip. I'm just trying to be the best
friend I can be to Rory, wanting to be there for her, trying to earn
her respect and admiration. </p>
<p>In time though, I hope this has taken another big step towards
earning her love. She's still playing coy and elusive, hinting at
feelings here and there, but not saying outright that she wants me. Come
on though, it's obvious; we're getting closer and closer to each other,
on a collision course towards something that's scary to me, something
I've never known in my life. I'm scared shitless that I could be wrong. </p>
<p>But my gut is telling me to enjoy the ride and that the best is yet
to come. </p>
<p>Rory and I get up in the awards staging area at the far end of the
gym, with a small crowd gathering around us, including a few competitors
who got up from their cots in the hallway to watch the awards ceremony.
We sat in a couple of wooden chairs set up at the end of the stage,
waiting for our shot in the spotlight as Taylor hands out the more
minor ribbons and awards that go with the final minutes. Best
sportsmanship does go to Kirk, who though talks some good trash in the
heat of competition, admitted at the end that even though he fell, we
fought a good fight with him. He wasn't taking the trophy home with him
this year, but unlike some certain professional athletes, he admitted he
was human in the dance world. </p>
<p>It felt good to sit for an extended period for the first time in
hours, and I felt relaxed as Rory and I watched the awards being handed
out. Wildest move, funniest elimination, goofiest costume, all of them
were out there to be won, a great way to end the night. </p>
<p>I did start to nod off a little bit towards the middle of the
ceremony, thinking about the day ahead for me. Which meant a lot of
sleep, but not in my own bed. Rory kept insisting I walk over to her
house and sleep there, because I thought I'd just leave after we stopped
dancing. I could drive home to Hartford, I kept insisting, but she got
all maternal on me, and maybe a little...domineering. That's when she
started sliding that pesky hand of hers under my dress. </p>
<p>Which then froze my mind into her being dominating in other areas.
Bedroom areas to be exact. I lost all my thoughts and despite my
pointing out all the arguments I could against staying with her, she
eventually made me relent and I'll stay with her after we leave. I mean
I shared a bed with her only three weeks ago, what can happen? It's just
two girls sharing a bed together, innocent as can be. </p>
<p>Except that one of them has a fierce crush on the other. What
happens if my sleep talking just happens to flare up again? I tape
recorded myself in slumber a couple weeks ago just for kicks, then had
to blush and bring out the cassette eraser because my talking
was...off-color to put it kindly. Amazing how profane I can get when
sleep overtakes me, not to mention sexually charged. </p>
<p>But that's something for another time. Rory tapped me on the
shoulder to get my attention. </p>
<p>"Par? That's us." She smiled at me, and I looked up towards the end
of the trophy table, where the 4 1/2 ' marvel that is the trophy stands
proud, the base with a gold plate, awaiting the carving of our
respective names into it. </p>
<p>"I still can't believe it," I said to her, as if the whole thing
hadn't hit us yet. "We won." We got up together and walked to the other
side of the stage, both barefoot because no sane winner would keep their
dancing shoes on even through the ceremony. </p>
<p>Then, as we came to the X where we had to stand, she took my hand
and wrapped it in mine. We both shared a silent look, her gaze
unreadable to me, yet could I see a little bit of longing in her eyes? I
don't know, but it is almost 6am, so she could be laughing at my
tiredness for all I know. </p>
<p>We sat off to the side as Taylor, from what I heard, gave the same
speech as he did every year. You know, the kind of civic can-do speech
that can easily be cut-and-pasted together. Just replace 'wonderfully
talented dancer from New York, along with the can-do man who will do it
all' with 'a disciplined hard working girl from the richest part of
Hartford, along with the girl we all know, love, and pray will make us
in Stars Hollow proud one day', and you basically have what Taylor said
to the crowd. There was a scattering of clapping in the crowd, who were
just waiting for us to say our own piece since it had to be a little
different. There really wasn't that much to say with both of us,
honestly. Because I didn't know most of these people I just thanked the
organizers, Taylor and Ms. LaCosta for putting on a good event, and then
smiled at Rory as I told her she was wonderful as my partner. </p>
<p>I think my short minute-long words killed the crowd, because they
started surprisingly thinning out before Rory got to the stage. There
weren't many left at all as Rory almost repeated verbatim my same
speech, except a thanks to her mother who was still in Nashville and
wasn't there to congratulate her quite yet. By the time she finished,
only about 30 people were left in the gym, and in the background I could
hear engines being started and tire squeals from the temporary parking
lot out back. Taylor then introduced us both as the champions, and
handed us the trophy. </p>
<p>Rory took the left side, I took the right. Here I was expecting a
simple little cup, but this thing was huge. I guess it has 2 inches for
every hour of the dance, because it was as tall as where my stomach was.
We didn't dare lift it higher, afraid we'd break it, but I loved all
the embellishments on it. There was a gold-flecked figure of a couple
dancing on the top in the place resided usually by that little guy
holding the ball or implement used for the particular sport the award
was being given for. It was nice, but too much for such an event. </p>
<p>"Rory? Please don't take this the wrong way, but you can have this
thing," I told her, grunting as we set it back down onto the table.
"Even my mansion doesn't have a display case for something this big!" </p>
<p>Rory laughed, and then called over Ms. LaCosta, telling me to take a
second and stay standing. They walked over to the other side of the
room, and Rory whispered something into the older woman's ear. I also
saw a CD jewel case in Ms. LaCosta's hand, but couldn't make out the
titling or picture on the cover. They whispered to each other for a few
moments, and I was unable to decode their conversation. What were they
about to do? </p>
<p>Was she about to tell Rory my secret? Maybe give her a heads-up? I
started getting nervous about what they were telling each other, and had
a large fear that I was about to be outed. </p>
<p>After talking things out, Rory came back towards me. </p>
<p>"Hey Par?" she asked me, bringing my heartbeat into a hard thump. <i>Oh
God, she did tell Rory I liked her, what am I going to do?</i> </p>
<p>There was only one thing I could do, and that was face the music.
Timidly, I said "Yeah?" to her question, and prepared for a life without
her... </p>
<p>"I hate to ask this after such a long day, but it's tradition for
the winners to dance to a song of their choosing at the end. Would you
care to dance with me?" </p>
<p>I sighed in the biggest relief of my life; Rory didn't know, she was
just talking to Patty about the song she wanted to play during the last
dance. She smiled, and I gave her my hand. </p>
<p>"As long as it isn't anything out of the grunge rock or rock-rap
genres, yes, I'd be honored to." We walked out to center court beneath
the painted minute man logo, as I took in the room around me. </p>
<p>The crowd was thinning, only 23 diehards still on the floor, as the
banks of gym lights across the ceiling were turned off, leaving only the
side lights along the sidelines aimed towards the circle in the middle.
We stepped into the spotlight, hand and hand, and my curiosity was
piqued as to which song she chose for us to dance to. Before everything
was in either the hands of Taylor and Patty, we were at the whims of
whatever they wanted to play. I looked up towards Rory, who looked even
more beautiful than when I walked in the gym 24 hours before. Her makeup
had long faded, her hair was out of its artificial curl and once again
fell down her shoulders. She had taken the rose out after the end, as
did I, but that did nothing to ruin her beauty. </p>
<p>Her lips, they were pink, ready to be kissed. But that was for
another time. I was going to savor this moment for the rest of my life.
Patty took the microphone and introduced our last dance. </p>
<p>"Usually, the winners in the past have done a few laps around the
gym after the trophy presentation, and then did a last dance in the
center of the floor. However, we all know how humble and quiet, even in
victory, Rory is. So instead of the usual lapping the field to a song
found on an arena rock album, she told me she wanted this song played,
had she won. She says it's very special to her, and that it's a song
that brings up the most beautiful memories, thoughts, and dreams she's
ever had in her life. Congratulations again girls, and cherish this
moment in the spotlight before the end of this year's annual dance
marathon. Andrew, if you'll press play for me dear..." </p>
<p>I looked at Rory in my gaze, coming closer towards me. The way she
looked to me was determined, as she brought a hand up to my face. She
brushed a few stray hairs that were blocking my line of vision out of
the way, running her fingers down my cheeks as if to communicate we
shouldn't pay attention to anything else. There were no words needed,
nor any need to communicate what I was thinking right then. </p>
<p>Andrew hit the CD player's play button, and the notes blared out of
the speakers immediately told me what I was about to dance to. The song
where everything started, where I had those first thoughts to the
contrary, telling me that Rory was meant to be less of an enemy, more
than a friend. The familiar and soothing recorded voice of Susannah
Hoffs started giving me the moment I've always visualized in only
dreams, but was now a sudden reality. Rory smiled and moved close to me,
enveloping me with her arms, as I did the same. I fell into the moment
as the lyrics started... </p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling, do you feel my
heart beating; Do you understand? <br/>
Do you feel the same, or am I only dreaming? Is this burning, an
eternal flame?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I felt stinging goosebumps along my arms as the verse was sung, all my
defenses against her fall as her hands rubbed the middle of my back. She
may have had the same dream I did, because the moment in my mind was an
exact xerox of this moment. Everything around us was fading away, my
awareness for her on a high level. All this wooing, subtle flirting, the
fleeting touches shared since the beginning of the school year, they
were starting to come together in this moment that was making me melt in
her arms. </p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>I believe it's meant to be darling, I watch you when you're
sleeping, you belong with me <br/>
Do you feel the same, or am I only dreaming? But is this burning, an
eternal flame?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My eyes were heavy with sleep, as were hers, yet my senses were hyper,
coursing through my veins at a rapid rate. She was so close to me, mere
inches separating us, and I could take in the essence that was Rory
Gilmore. She smells of vanilla, her skin soft and smooth like velvet. I
closed my eyes, wallowing in these feelings. Her nails scraped against
my back softly, and she mouthed the words of the song out, trying to
keep herself in rhythm with the music. Opening my eyes back up, I recall
that night in the theater in New York, where she caught me bobbing my
head along to this same band. I wasn't even aware that I was, until she
turned towards me and gave me this knowing smirk. That was the first
time I dropped my boundaries around her, and though I firmed up seconds
later, I felt a charge of excitement that she noticed that. </p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>Say my name, sun shines through the rain, of all life so
lonely <br/>
Then come and ease the pain, I don't want to lose this feeling...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, it's so funny how life works out in mysterious ways. I swear to
you if someone had come up to me a week ago, told me that Dean would be
a part of Rory's dating past two days later, and that I would not only
be thrown into the role of replacement for him, but win it all, I would
have thought that was as crazy a prediction as President Bush resigning
after having a torrid gay affair with his staffer; impossible and never
to happen. Yet here I am, in Rory's arms, falling for her even deeper
and more insatiable for her with each time she says my name. She makes
me proud to have it, something Mother has never done in my seventeen
years. Without her, I'd be the 'bitter little hag' she described me in
during the heat of our argument in that conference room. </p>
<p>Whatever Rory's feelings for me, I feel like I'm the right place in
her arms, on this floor, after a day of the most earned victory both of
us have ever attained. Anyone can talk really fast and bend arguments
back to squash a competitor's point to win a debate, or get that right
mix of facts and entertainment packed into 24 pages of broadsheet print
to be distributed to 1,250 fellow peers every week. But it takes so much
more than that to win at a dance marathon like this. You need that
right mix of physical prowness, mental planning, and most importantly,
perfect chemistry with your partner. The first two might be perfect, but
if you two fight like the Lockhorns, forget about it, you fucked
yourself over. You need that right mix of 'I can't stand you sometimes,
but yet, I can't stand to be away from you' in order to succeed. </p>
<p>If this entire day has foreshadowing, I can predict with utmost
clarity, that Rory and I will be very close for years and years to come.
And God willing, we'll be closer than friends. The cues are there, I
just have to finish solving that Ovaltine decoder ring rebus that is
Rory Gilmore, and whether she has her own eternal flame for my love... </p>

<h4> Rory's POV, 5:59am</h4>

<p>For the last five days, ever since that idea in my head that asked me
to consider using this dance marathon as an opportunity to woo Paris
further, I've felt like I've been on a roller coaster. There were times
I wanted to change my mind, call her and say not to come on Saturday,
and each time those I killed that thought by remembering how far we've
come. In 10th grade if I'd asked her, she would have turned her back on
me without an answer then walked away. Then there was the Tristan thing
midway through, which only served to confuse me further into thinking
that she still had a torch for him. </p>
<p>She didn't, and I was wrong. But I'd rather that she got all that
anguish out rather than keep it bottled in. I know she has so much on
her plate to deal with, and I hope that as I try to get closer to her,
she tells me more. </p>
<p>I can tell with her in my arms now though, that the fears I thought
she had before of us are fast disappearing. I saw her in the corner of
my eye, with a glance of fear across her face as I took Miss Patty aside
and made sure she knew my plans for the last dance. There was a fear in
them that I want to read into more closely so I can find out what she
was thinking. She kind of paused before I asked her to dance, probably
thinking something other than what was in my mind. </p>
<p>That's not what's on my mind, however. We're both in center court,
at the same time, together, swaying closely to a beautiful song that
didn't have a particular memory to go with it until that night in New
York when she stayed still as a statue, entranced with the meanings
hidden in the notes. </p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling, do you feel my
heart beating; Do you understand? <br/>
Do you feel the same, or am I only dreaming? Is this burning, an
eternal flame?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the swell of the music, the harmony, the feel of Paris against
me as her nose nuzzles against my left ear, while I mouth the words
silently. I never knew how right, how close this moment could be in my
dream. It's so intimate, like I can feel the berber of my bedroom carpet
below my feet, the door closed, Eternal Flame playing softly on my CD
clock radio. Almost everything about this day I could imagine happening
managed to come true, but it's far from over. We still have the ride
home thanks to Miss Patty, because I sure wasn't about to carry that
trophy seven blocks home while both of tried to keep each other propped
up so we didn't fall asleep in the middle of Walnut Street.</p>

<blockquote class="song">
  <p>Say my name, sun shines through the rain, of all life so
lonely <br/>
Then come and ease the pain, I don't want to lose this feeling...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The song continues the two of us languishing in the spell. She's about
as close as she can get to me without it being construed as sexual and
Paris feels very warm. I run my fingertip along her pulse point; it's
beating at a very rapid rate. I hear her softly moan, she's totally
fallen for this song. The chorus starts, then she whispers softly in my
ear. </p>
<p>"Ror?" The name is said with nothing but passion, and I feel
goosebumps as her one-syllable nickname for me tickles me in just the
right spot. </p>
<p>"Yes Par?" </p>
<p>"This was by far, the best day of my entire life. Thank you for
inviting me to participate, along with the wonderful song choice." </p>
<p>"It's your favorite, isn't it?" I questioned her, rubbing along her
spine. </p>
<p>"The best." I nod, and get back into the very slow, yet sensual last
dance. </p>
<p>My flame for Paris, it was confirmed tonight, burns stronger than
before, you can see the sparks a mile away. Today is the day, it just
has to be. I'm going to make this sleepover the best nap Paris Gellar
has ever had. No barriers are stopping us now, there's no one to
interfere, and plenty of time to act. </p>
<p>The hard part, getting along with each other for an extended period
of time, awake, is over. There's no need to make a list, gather facts,
comparison shop or figure out anything. I like Paris with all I have. I
just hope she feels the same, because this is no dream. She's my flame,
and I'm not going to let anyone snuff her out anytime soon... </p>
