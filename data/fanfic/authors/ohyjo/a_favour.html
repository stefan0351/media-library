<!-- A Favour \ null -->

<p>Despite the thick gloves B'Elanna wore her hands were
ice cold. In
fact she was freezing all over.</p>
<p>She still did not understand how she ended up on this
away mission but here she was, and hating every minute
of it. Thank god, none of the snowstorms they had
observed from Voyager had struck up.</p>
<p>Walking behind her team-mate she still had no idea were
she was going or what she was doing on this frozen mud
ball. She simply had no idea what Seven had in mind
that required her assistance.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's mood was deteriorating by the minute. Where
the hell was Seven taking her and why the hell hadn't
they just transported directly to their destination?</p>
<p>Seven absolutely refused to tell her why they were here,
simply replying that she would find out when they got
there; she would know. And all of this simply because
she owed the Borg a favour.</p>
<p>"Do not worry, B'Elanna Torres, we have nearly reached
our destination," said Seven as she looked at the half
Klingon.</p>
<p>"Seven why the hell did we not beam there directly?"
B'Elanna did her best not to let her temper get the
better of her. Lately she and the Borg had started to
get along better and she knew Seven would not
walk around in all this snow without a good reason.
That would be inefficient. But it was difficult to
keep herself in check, and it was getting more
difficult as she was getting colder.</p>
<p>"There are natural phenomena in this planet's
atmosphere that make transportation hazardous."
Replied Voyager's astrometrics officer.</p>
<p>"Seven, I can see miles away in just about every
direction. What the hell are we doing here?" B'Elanna
tried again.</p>
<p>"We are already here, it is more a matter of timing. It
will only be a few moments now." Seven tried to
placate her half Klingon companion without giving away
her surprise. She had to trick the Klingon in coming
here with her but she was certain that when the woman
saw what was here she would appreciate it very much.
At least that was what she hoped. With the chief
Engineer you never knew, but then that was one of the
things she liked about
her.</p>
<p>When Seven had scanned this planet from Astrometric's
she had come across a very exiting natural phenomena.
She had been eager to study it in person, preferably
alone so she could enjoy it's perfection
uninterrupted.
However Captain Janeway refused to give Seven
permission to go unless someone went with her. But
there was only one person with whom Seven
wanted to share this unique phenomena. And It had been
nearly impossible to come up with an idea to persuade
the Klingon to join her on this outing without giving
anything away. But she had gotten lucky.</p>
<p>In order to speed up repairs from an unfortunate
encounter with an asteroid field, Seven had volunteered
to help out the overworked Engineering staff. There
she had been so efficient that when she finished the
Chief Engineer, in an unusually good mood, had thanked Seven for her help. She had also said that she owed
her one.</p>
<p>Unclear about what that meant she had requested
B'Elanna explain to her what she owed her. Chuckling
B'Elanna had said that it meant she owed Seven a
favour.</p>
<p>That had put a smile on Seven's face as her problem
was solved. "I do indeed need a favour from you."</p>
<p>Curiously B'Elanna had asked what it was. Assuming
Seven would probably want more power diverted to
Astrometrics or something like that. Actually planning
to help the former Drone as well as she could this
time.</p>
<p>When she heard what Seven wanted her to do her good
mood melted like snow in the sun. But being an
honourable Klingon she did not try to get out of it.
She had said she owed Seven a favour so she had to pay
up.</p>
<p>And so now the engineer was walking with Seven in this
dessert of snow and her mood was dropping by the
minute.</p>
<p>Suddenly the former Drone stopped and said: "It is
beginning."</p>
<p>And all around them the light changed, beautiful
colours were streaming through the sky, slowly
changing the white horizon in a gentle flow of
colours. It was breathtaking.</p>
<p>B'Elanna forgot all about the cold and her
temper. She simply drank in the amazing sight.</p>
<p>They did not know how long they stood there watching
but a while later the scenery slowly turned back to
the previous white landscape.</p>
<p>Still in awe of what they had just witnessed they
stood still for a few more minutes, not willing or at
that point able, to break the spell they were under.</p>
<p>It was obvious to Seven that her surprise had been
well received. This pleased her even more than the
incredible phenomena she had just observed.
Still she asked. "Did you enjoy the vision, B'Elanna
Torres?"</p>
<p>After what she had just experienced all B'Elanna could
do was nod.</p>
<p>And then to her own surprise she grasped Seven's hand,
only intending to touch it briefly, to thank her,
since for the first time in a very long time she
lacked words to express herself. But when she tried to
pull back Seven refused to let go.</p>
<p>For some reason this did not make her angry. She just
looked expectedly at Seven. The former drone started
talking softly.</p>
<p>"This occurrence was impressive, with you beside me it
became perfection. I am glad we could witness this
event together."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could not believe what she was hearing and
her jaw dropped half open. Giving her head a good
shake, she wondered if she had heard what Seven had
said correctly.</p>
<p>One look in the blonde's blue eyes told her she had
not misheard the words. The feelings displayed there
left no room for doubt and B'Elanna felt all-warm
inside.</p>
<p>A huge smile appeared on her face as she grasped
Seven's hand tighter in response. No words were
needed.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship and
o... so much more.</p>
