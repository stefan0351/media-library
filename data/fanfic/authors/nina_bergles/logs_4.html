<p>Personal log, Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres Star date.... uh computer it's September 25th 2375</p>

		<p>I kissed her! Well actually she kissed me .... I was dreaming again, I again didn't get to see her face, cause try as I might I couldn't open my eyes .... It was wonderful, soft and innocent and full of.love? I will go crazy dreaming things like this! Love. One can't be in love with a dream. And one also can't be in love with someone totally unknown. This time I didn't wake up in the middle of it. It was like I was falling asleep in her arms and then waking up to reality, yet again. Whenever I have this dream I feel so lonely afterwards and I feel this longing for someone who could make me feel exactly this way. But there's nobody who could, these are only dreams. If I think too much about it, it will become to real so I'll stop talking about 'it' now.</p>

		<p>Last night I fell asleep to the sounds of Seven's playing the piano. I still don't like her, but I see now that she is indeed human and not the machine I am so fond of seeing in her.</p>

		<p>Someone has already asked for more sound proofing, seems like not all of my neighbours like Seven's playing the piano. Perhaps their ears are faulty, for her music is so wonderful, it doesn't bother me. Normally listening to music distracts me, hers soothes me .</p>

		<p>Day in Engineering was boring, the only positive thing about that is that it means Voyager is running smoothly, which in turn means I am doing a good job.</p>

		<p>When I woke up this morning, Seven was already awake, but I didn't notice at that time. I had forgotten about her and went into my bathroom, only to find her naked in the sonic shower. Boy, that girl is certainly beautiful. I know when you look at her in that biosuit of hers you think it hides nothing, but .... oh how wrong they are. She suddenly turned around, she hadn't noticed me before and looked shocked to see me there. I caught myself staring at her. -I wish I would be only half as beautiful as she is. - Err, back to the bathroom. I wanted to move out, but found I could not, being too fascinated by the blush that appeared on her features. And then she said "Your physical appearance is very pleasing, Lieutenant." 'Oh Kahless', I thought and remembered that I too was exposed. I quickly murmured "thank you" and fled the scene. The situation would have seemed comical to any onlookers, but I still feel the embarrassment, even now only talking about it I blush, I feel it. I think some inner part of me liked seeing Seven so .... I don't know why she said that. ' Your physical appearance is very pleasing, Lieutenant.' It seems down right ridiculous; hearing such line from Seven of Nine, former Borg, when both of us are undressed in the bathroom and staring at each other. At least I don't have to work with her in the moment, but that could change at any time Janeway likes. Apropos our oh so nice commanding officer: She was here.</p>

		<p>Sometime around 10 pm the door chimed. I got up from my comfortable position on the couch, reading and listening to Seven's play. She never seems to do one piece more than once .... Err yeah right, I got up. Sam had already been here with Naomi, so it couldn't be her. I never before noticed how much time Seven spends with Naomi. When I got back to my, 'our' quarters after my shift had ended, I found them playing some game in the living room. They were sitting on the floor. Seven was teasing Naomi about something, I have never seen her done that. -She would be a good mother .</p>

		<p>Now I opened the door, thinking maybe Harry or Tom were coming by and was caught completely off-guard when Janeway greeted me. Strange, now that Tom and I aren't together anymore I look much more forward to seeing him, we're definitive better off as friends than we were as a couple.</p>

		<p>She seems to do that a lot, not catching me off-guard although she does that too .... no I meant she seems to spend much of her spare time with Seven. I got that from the way Seven was not in the least surprised to see the captain in my, err our quarters. Those pronouns are getting on my nerves.</p>

		<p>I greeted her and then said good night, not wanting to disturb them. Tactical retreat. In my own quarters! I am starting to hate this quarter sharing thing, first the embarrassing scene in the bathroom and now this. Although it has a good side, too for example leaving the embarrassment aside being treated to the sight of a gorgeous nude blonde is certainly .... oh no I am not going to take that train of thought. I am normal, no freak .... It's still hurting. They called me that all my life even in the Academy .... one of the reasons why I left. But here on Voyager nobody calls me that * gives a sad laugh * they're perhaps too afraid to do so. - Oh no, come on B'Elanna drag yourself out of these depressing thoughts. I remember Counsellor Galen "Say it to yourself B'Elanna, 'I am not an unworthy freak'." I wonder if she's still getting on the nerves of the cadets back in AQ? She was one of the other reasons I left. Always trying to analyse the from her father abandoned half-breed.</p>

		<p>I will end here computer. Perhaps this time I will dream of something normal, perhaps a husband and two kids .... I always wanted a family. Will I ever have one?</p>

		<p>Perhaps all I need now is a warm and comfy embrace of dream-woman.</p>
