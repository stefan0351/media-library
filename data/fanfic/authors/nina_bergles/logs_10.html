<!-- Logs \ Conclusion -->

<p>"All logs requested to be played, have been played." The emotionless voice of Voyager's computer announced.</p>

		<p>"Well," she said, "you were certainly not yourself when you recorded these logs," she allowed a little pause before she continued, "you know .... it never showed, you are pretty good at keeping your feelings inside of yourself, Love."</p>

		<p>She was teasing me. I don't care. Lying here on the couch, her arms wrapped around me, the comforting warmth of her against my back, there is nothing that could disturb me. </p>

		<p>"Well, I am not the only one, if I may remind you Be'nal," I replied remembering how she had acted around me, even when she had been in love with me as she had later revealed to me. 'I didn't reveal it. If I remember correctly, you accidentally stumbled upon this little fact, when you touched me that day in Engineering,' she sent a telepathic message. </p>

		<p>The psychic bond was still in place, and it had gotten stronger over the years. </p>

		<p>'I remember.  I also remember that that wasn't as accidental as you thought,' I send back. </p>

		<p>"Well, I don't care if it was accidentally or not," she said aloud, "it made us confess our feelings."</p>

		<p>"Something I still like to do," I answered, "I love you."</p>

		<p>That brought a smile to her lips. Those wonderful lips, still as enticing as they had been when I first kissed her. They made me want to kiss her.  So I kissed her, thoroughly, enjoying it. And if the moan coming from the depth of her throat was any indication she enjoyed it too. It didn't last long though. We were interrupted by a beautiful young blonde.</p>

		<p>"Aw, Moms! You're doing it again," K'Eylhr said. So we stopped the kiss and turned to our daughter, who was standing in front of the couch, a pout on her lips.</p>

		<p>"So, what did Alex do?" she asked our little girl, an amused smile showing on her lips. I swear sometimes those two are as bad as a Klingon and a Romulan fighting each other. "He didn't take your dolls apart again?" I asked, knowing our son, he probably had ignored our last warning.</p>

		<p>Shaking vehemently her head she said, "No, Mama. Mummy said we are not allowed to take anything apart in the quarters or outside, without explicit permission." </p>

		<p>Very true. There had been some incidents concerning damaged replicators after the twins had decided to look what was inside them.</p>

		<p>"Mama, you hafta come and see yourself," she said pleading eyes turned on me. The same eyes her mother had, ice blue, full of love. I can never resist those eyes. "Please," she said.</p>

		<p>So I got up leaving my wife alone on the couch. 'It won't take long,' I promised. She gave me one of her seldom grins, telling me she seriously doubted that. </p>

		<p>"Call me when you need me, will you?" she asked. </p>

		<p>"Course, Mummy. Now come Mama." K'Eylhr told her other mother, she took my hand into her little one and pulled me with herself towards the door to her and Alex's room.  I exchanged a quick glance with my wife of nearly 10 years, before I was pulled into the room.</p>

		<p>'I love you, Seven,' I send her telepathically.</p>

		<p>'I love you B'Elanna.'</p>
