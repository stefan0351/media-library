<p>Seven was standing in front of her workstation in Cargo bay two. On her face she had a serious frown.</p>

		<p>This was more complicated than she had initially thought.</p>

		<p>She was researching. Researching an old human tradition called "Valentine's Day".</p>

		<p>When Kathryn had asked Seven what she had planned for Valentine's Day - the first together with B'Elanna - the ex-drone had been truly baffled.</p>

		<p>"Of what relevance is a day to celebrate someone who tore his clothes in two?" she had asked the captain, who first looked at Seven with a blank face, and broke out into a laughing fit.</p>

		<p>"Well that's one way to see it, but you better do some research, Seven!" she had advised.</p>

		<p>"It's only one and a half weeks till the 14th." And with that the Captain of Voyager had left the cargo bay where the two had stood talking after Janeway had accompanied Seven back to her 'quarters' after a game of Velocity.</p>

		<p>And now Seven knew what her friend had meant. Valentine's Day : a day to celebrate love and the one person you love.</p>

		<p>The data on the history of this dubious holiday was vast and differing in opinion - all in all completely confusing. And the customs left Seven, to be honest, in a state of blank horror. There were so many things one could do, should do, but nowhere was specified what the best thing to do was.</p>

		<p>Poems.</p>

		<p>Candle light dinner.</p>

		<p>Chocolate in heart shape.</p>

		<p>Cards, also in heart shape.</p>

		<p>Red roses.</p>

		<p>And the list went on!</p>

		<p>And nowhere a word as to how to spend that day with your half-Klingon girlfriend, with whom you were completely in love, but also didn't know if she loved you back, when you were only an ex-Borg... The word 'girlfriend' made Seven smile and for a while her concerned frown left her face - till she remembered that Lanna hadn't ever said the words.</p>

		<p>When Tom and B'Elanna had broken up, Seven had found herself growing more and more attracted to the chief engineer - an attraction B'Elanna had obviously shared. They slowly became friends and after that it hadn't been long till they'd been dating.</p>

		<p>And then. A few weeks after their first kiss. They had made love. That day Seven had been a goner. She had realized with almost painful harshness, that she was in love with B'Elanna. And that she didn't know if B'Elanna loved her back. In the whole three months since they'd first began dating she had never said it.</p>

		<p>- Sure she'd made Seven compliments, told her she wanted her - that kind of thing - but not the declaration of love that Seven's heart so desperately waited for. And she herself was too afraid to say it first... 'isn't it ironic - I, the take no prisoners ex-Borg, am too AFRAID to tell the woman I love about my feelings?' Seven thought to herself.</p>

		<p>She looked again at all the research material. And then decided on a plan of action. She was going to show B'Elanna the love she felt for her...</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Two weeks later - Valentine's Day</p>

		<p>B'Elanna awoke to the feeling of coldness beside her - cold because Seven wasn't there to share her bed. Seven had had to work a night shift last night.</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon was unaware of the special date and only knew that it was her day off. She got up from the bed and prepared herself for the day. She planned on spending the time with Seven...</p>

		<p>Walking into her living room the first thing she noticed was that something seemed to be off. And then she spotted it...a vase full of red roses. B'Elanna's first thought was that they were from Seven, but why would she do that?</p>

		<p>She approached the dinner table and saw that amidst the roses a card was sitting. B'Elanna carefully took it out and noticed that all thorns had been removed from the roses - not many people knew that they were poisoning for Klingons, trust Seven to know it. B'Elanna could actually smell them! They were real roses! But there were no thornless roses in the hydroponics day, as B'Elanna knew...</p>

		<p>The card was red, too and - B'Elanna was surprised - in heart shape. It read:</p>

		<p>Be my Valentine!</p>

		<p>Seven.</p>

		<p>Even the point above the I was in heart shape. And the card was handwritten - a sentimental statement, that was equally unexpected from Seven.</p>

		<p>Only now did B'Elanna remember what day today was. She slammed her hand against her brow ridges.</p>

		<p>"Of course. Valentine's Day! Kahless, how could I forget?"</p>

		<p>'What am I gonna do?', she asked herself, but came up with no answer. She didn't even have a present for Seven...well that was not entirely right. There was the little box she kept hidden away for a good moment to give it to Seven, perhaps that moment had arrived...</p>

		<p>A soft bleeping tone coming from the computer told her that a message had just arrived at her workstation. She stopped her contemplations and went to watch what message she had just gotten.</p>

		<p>It was from Seven.</p>

		<p>She was asking B'Elanna out 'to dinner this evening at a non specified place' as the message read. The last few words astounded B'Elanna: 'It's a surprise. I am going to come and fetch you."</p>

		<p>Now that was certainly a surprise, in the month they had dated Seven had never been as cryptic before when asking her out, but B'Elanna decided it was nice and to move along with what Seven had planned for dinner. B'Elanna would have enough time to apologize for forgetting the day.</p>

		<p>Dinner! Kahless, what was she gonna wear?</p>

		<p>And off went B'Elanna into full panic mood...</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Several hours later</p>

		<p>Seven tugged B'Elanna along, who had a blindfold around her eyes so she wouldn't know where they were going.</p>

		<p>"Oh come on, Seven," B'Elanna pouted, "you can take it off, I promise I won't look."</p>

		<p>Seven rolled her eyes - that was the 5th request of that kind in the last 2 minutes.</p>

		<p>"No," she declared firmly, "when we have arrived, I will take off the blindfold. Not before."</p>

		<p>This was more amusing than she would have thought, first she was being greeted by a soft and passionate kiss and Lanna saying she was sorry for forgetting Valentine's Day and now her eyes were delighted by the cute pout on the half-Klingon's face!</p>

		<p>'There should be more holidays like this,' she thought to herself.</p>

		<p>A few minutes later they were finally there, Seven opened the sealed doors and carefully lead B'Elanna into the room where they were going to have dinner.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna opened her yes and gasped. She wasn't trusting her eyes! The room she was standing in was half-transparent and only lit by the starlight and two candles standing on a table, which was seemingly hanging around in space.</p>

		<p>The doors behind them closed.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was still standing there with a gaping mouth, still not believing her eyes.</p>

		<p>"How did you do that?" she asked overwhelmed by the romantic gesture.</p>

		<p>"I did nothing," Seven stated, a smile playing around her lips, "this room, is a special design feature of all Intrepid-class vessels. 'You just switch on a button' and the outer walls become transparent," she explained.</p>

		<p>"That's not in the specs..." Lanna said.</p>

		<p>"It's a hidden design feature. Not very well known, do you want to eat?" Seven asked, not further explaining how she came to know about this little feat.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna just nodded still quite a bit speechless.</p>

		<p>Seven was being quite the "Gentleman" seating her in her seat and only then sitting down herself.</p>

		<p>They had a pleasant conversation over the carefully replicated dinner - all B'Elanna's favorites as she absentmindedly noticed.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was lulled into a cocoon of loving safety, gazing only at Seven, ignoring the more than romantic setting. Completely charmed by her lover. She didn't even listen consciously to what they said anymore.</p>

		<p>Seven was as taken with the half-Klingon as B'Elanna was with her and had entirely forgotten her objective of the day: to tell B'Elanna how she felt for her.</p>

		<p>Until the meal was over... Then she immediately and very prominently remembered again.</p>

		<p>They were sitting at the table facing each other, doing nothing else than gazing at the respective other.</p>

		<p>Seven spoke up: "I wanted to tell you something," she cautiously and very seriously began.</p>

		<p>Suddenly B'Elanna was called back to earth from the clouds she had been walking on all evening. Some part of her brain thought Seven was going to tell her something dreadful, like, say, break up with her. Another part however reasoned, that the ex-Borg wouldn't go to the lengths she did, just to break up. Over her inner argument she nearly missed what Seven whispered, just above her breath.</p>

		<p>"Qabang."</p>

		<p>Nearly.</p>

		<p>The second time this evening B'Elanna was speechless. That was the last she had expected.</p>

		<p>A declaration of love.</p>

		<p>>From Seven. Her girlfriend. On Valentine's Day.</p>

		<p>Her brain had a little trouble processing the data it had just received. Her hand instinctively went into the pocket of her trousers where her little gift for Seven was waiting for the perfect moment. Her thought process kicking back in she decided, no better moment than now.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna hadn't been sure if Seven was ready for it and so as not to pressure her had said nothing about love to Seven, but there was no doubt to her that she was head over heals, full fledged in love with the gorgeous, baby-blue-eyed blonde, sitting right in front of her.</p>

		<p>She got up from her seat.</p>

		<p>"Oh Seven. I...I don't know what to say," seeing the fearful look on Seven's face, she quickly amended, "except: Qabang je."</p>

		<p>She got down on her knees in front of Seven and took out the little box. It was velvety. She opened it, the opened box facing Seven.</p>

		<p>"I got this, a month ago, when we had shore leave. I wanted to wait...but...I love you. And I want to be with you for the rest of our lives."</p>

		<p>It was a ring.</p>

		<p>The stone was blue, resembling the color of Seven's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Do you want to marry, me?"</p>

		<p>It was Seven's turn to be speechless.</p>

		<p>She had read that marriage proposals where quite common on Valentine's day, but had ruled out asking B'Elanna to marry her as she had not even been sure the half-Klingon returned her feelings.</p>

		<p>This was entirely unexpected. She didn't know what to do.</p>

		<p>"Please, say something," B'Elanna insecurely asked her.</p>

		<p>Seven thought about it. She loved B'Elanna. B'Elanna loved her. It was only logical to marry. That and that it was what Seven wanted to do with all her heart.</p>

		<p>"Yes," she stated her voice a little broken with emotion dripping from her.</p>

		<p>A blinding smile split B'Elanna's face in two. She got up to her feet. Her hands still holding Seven's and kissed her love with complete abandon.</p>
