<!-- World Without Love \ Part 4 -->

<p>"What the..., why does something like that always happen in such moments?" B'Elanna didn't really realize she had spoken her thoughts out aloud. "Let's get to engineering, quickly." With that she turned, not waiting for Seven to respond. With the ex-Borg following B'Elanna, the both of them proceeded as fast as possible towards engineering, but crawling through cramped Jeffries tubes, was something that certainly prevented a fast pace. But after two minutes that had seemed like hours the familiar looks of engineering greeted B'Elanna's eyes. Relief showed on B'Elanna's face, but quickly left as she took note of the chaos that was occurring in her engine room. In the whole place crew was running around, shouting, doing repairs and trying to avoid being thrown on the deck by the trembling and moves up and down that Voyager made. 'Check the inertial dampers' the chief engineer in B'Elanna noted.</p>

		<p>Seven on her heels she went as fast as her legs would carry her, to her station, to assess the situation.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Mr. Paris get us away from here," Janeway ordered, while trying to stay in her seat at the center of the bridge.</p>

		<p>"I'd gladly do that, Ma'am, but -" Tom was rudely interrupted by Ensign Harry Kim, the operations Officer, "Captain, the navigational systems just went off-line and I can't get them back." "See, and it seems like the Helm controls are damaged, too," Voyager's Helm's man continued. The distress he felt, crept into his voice as he too tried to stay in his seat. The pilot felt helpless, he knew all to well that when the systems were damaged even the best flying skills couldn't save you, only feisty half-Klingon engineers could.</p>

		<p>The Captain seemed to think the same: "Janeway to Engineering," the captain hailed.</p>

		<p>"Torres here, yes Captain," B'Elanna replied, but she was still focused on her station, trying to reroute power and assigning jobs to her engineering team.</p>

		<p>"We need the navigational systems and Helm controls, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"I am doing my best here, Captain, but we have to get out of this nebula, before I can get the systems on-line again -"</p>

		<p>"And we can't get out of the nebula without them. A vicious circle." The Captain stated.</p>

		<p>That was the time Seven saw fit to interrupt the conversation. "Captain, there is a solution to this problem."</p>

		<p>"Seven! I had no idea you were in engineering." The captain was surprised, since Seven's battle station was under normal circumstances Astrometrics. But being shaken and assaulted by particles of a nebula were hardly normal circumstances, Janeway decided.</p>

		<p>"I was assisting Lt. Torres with a repair," Seven declared.</p>

		<p>Now, that was a surprise, these both working peacefully and voluntarily together?</p>

		<p>"What are you proposing?" Janeway asked.</p>

		<p>Seven began to explain: "We could use the navigational systems of one of the shuttles to plot a course out of the nebula -"</p>

		<p>"So far so good Seven, but how would we pilot Voyager, helm controls are part of the navigational systems." B'Elanna interrupted, not seeing where Seven was heading, with her proposal.</p>

		<p>"I was getting to that point, Lieutenant," Seven answered patiently.</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry."</p>

		<p>Janeway was surprised; to see them interacting that politely with each other was certainly a new development. Seven still didn't get the concept of politeness completely, but at least now she was trying.</p>

		<p>"We would have to manually pilot."</p>

		<p>The captain didn't get Seven's point, there was no such option as to manually pilot Voyager. "How would we do that Seven?" she asked.</p>

		<p>"Borg protocol 21 alpha subsection 9." Seven stated as if that would be perfectly clear.</p>

		<p>But Janeway and the bridge crew still didn't get it, even Tuvok had raised his eyebrow, the only indication of him not understanding, what Seven was talking about. But it seemed like B'Elanna knew exactly what Seven meant. "Wow, Seven that is brilliant. How could I have forgotten that? Captain, do we have permission to proceed?" B'Elanna asked her Captain over the comm systems, thanks to Kahless the internal communication was one of very few systems that were undamaged by the particle bombardment that had Voyager helplessly drifting in this nebula. She too seemed to think everybody knew what she and Seven where talking about.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I don't understand, what is this Borg protocol?"</p>

		<p>"As you know our course is normally controlled with the Helm controls. The controls are nothing more than an interface between the pilot and the propulsion systems, the pilot programs courses into the computer and the Helm controls use this data to calculate when and how much power must be led to the propulsion systems. When on Borg ships the Helm controls get somehow damaged than protocol 21 alpha subsection 9 becomes valid and one or two Borg drones act as interface between the pilot and engines." B'Elanna made a slight pause.</p>

		<p>Janeway wondered how she knew so much about Borg procedures, even though she had stated how much she despised them.</p>

		<p>"But Captain we have to hurry for if I am right, the nebula will destroy us in 2 hours 30 minutes, if we don't get out of it."</p>

		<p>"2 hours 34 minutes and 34 seconds, to be precise, Lieutenant." Seven mentioned.</p>

		<p>"Whatever you say, Seven." B'Elanna sounded more amused, than annoyed by Seven's correction of her words. Janeway began to wonder, what had happened to have such an impact on the interaction between them. But there was no time for wondering, in the moment, so she decided to ask Seven about it after this mess was out of the way.</p>

		<p>That was all the explanation Janeway needed. "Mr. Paris take the Delta Flyer out and send the needed data directly to engineering, you have 5 minutes."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain." He got up and sprinted to the turbo lift.</p>

		<p>"I guess you and Seven are going to act as interfaces?" Janeway asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Captain we're the only ones qualified enough to do that," B'Elanna responded.</p>

		<p>"Captain," Tuvok calmly spoke up, "the structural integrity can't withstand the constant bombardment of dexter particles and is failing, it is also loosing power, which will accelerate its failure."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?" The comm channel was still open and B'Elanna had overheard all, while on her way to help Seven, who had already begun to modify a console so that from there it was possible to manually control Voyager's course. When she had heard Tuvok she had changed her course and was now furiously hitting buttons on an engineering station. "I'm working on it, Captain. I am working on it -"</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>On the bridge Harry Kim spoke up: "It looks like she is rerouting power from all non essential systems to the structural integrity field."</p>

		<p>"The Lieutenant is succeeding. The system is stabilizing, although still under constant bombardment of the dexter particles. It seems like she is using ... Borg algorithms to make the structural integrity field less vulnerable to those particles."</p>

		<p>Everybody knew that Vulcans had no emotions, but Janeway would bet everything she had that she had heard disbelief in her friend's voice.</p>

		<p>"Borg algorithms?" Chakotay asked. B'Elanna really seemed to know more about Borg than she normally let on.</p>

		<p>"Don't ask me Chakotay," Janeway said. She could only wonder about her chief engineer.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Having succeeded in preventing the failure of the structural integrity field, which would have been fatal, B'Elanna was now again concentrating on getting Voyager out of this nebula.</p>

		<p>"I didn't know you know so much about Borg procedures and technology," Seven stated.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, that's me, full of surprises." B'Elanna replied, her focus on the data stream on her console's display.</p>

		<p>"I couldn't have done better with the structural integrity field," the ex-drone said, a little unsure. She was not used in making compliments.</p>

		<p>Nor was B'Elanna in accepting them, she looked surprised up from the display, not used to such high praise from Seven "Uh, . well, thanks, Seven."</p>

		<p>They both didn't quite know how to go on so they again completely concentrated on their respective consoles.</p>

		<p>"I am receiving now the data, from Mr. Paris," Seven announced and her voice seemed to noticeable cool down when she said the pilot's name. She was standing across from B'Elanna at a modified console. B'Elanna was standing at a similar modified console and was glancing at the former drone.</p>

		<p>It had not taken them long to modify the consoles to control the respectively left and right impulse thrusters. They were going to pilot Voyager by manually adjusting the power that went into the thrusters. A delicate task, but if someone was capable of doing it, it were these two.</p>

		<p>"Torres to bridge. It's going to take us 20 minutes to get out of this nebula captain, permission to start?" B'Elanna hailed the bridge. Janeway's response was short and to the point: "Granted."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Janeway meanwhile wondered if the two could work together as well, as the task on hand demanded it. The two were not known for their good relationship. 'But neither are they known for knowingly endangering the ship because of personal matters' Janeway reminded herself. And ... their relationship seemed to have improved, if she interpreted the signs she had noticed in the right way.</p>
