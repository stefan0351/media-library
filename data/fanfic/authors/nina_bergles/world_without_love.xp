	<chapter title="Part 1">
		<p>B'Elanna was in one of her bad moods, she had just had an argument with Tom, again. So she had stopped by in 'her' engines room as she did ever when in a bad mood and had taken on the task of solving an easy but time consuming problem. The toolkit in her hand she crawled though the cramped Jeffries tubes to her aim, a damaged isolinear chip, that had caused various power conduits to malfunction. She had to locate the one chip that was damaged among 45 and that was so time consuming, because the Tricorder couldn't do the Job and she had to test each chip manually. After two hours of work she had gotten halfway over her initial bad mood and completely forgotten Tom who had caused it. Then she suddenly heard a voice, a female voice. It was singing.</p>

		<p><i>Please lock me away<br/>
		And don't allow the day here inside<br/>
		Where I hide with my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna knew the song. It was one of the few things she had gathered from her relationship with Tom Paris, her appreciation of ancient music. Her favourite singer was Vonda Shepard of the late 20th and early 21st century. She had heard this song sung by Vonda Shepard. It was one of B'Elanna's favourites.</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br/>
		I won't stay in a world without love</i></p>

		<p>The voice was full of emotion. Till now B'Elanna had forgotten all about the damaged chip, which she hadn't located yet and overcome with curiosity was trying to determine were the voice came from.</p>

		<p><i>Birds sing out of tune<br/>
		And raindrops hide the moon<br/>
		I'm okay, here I'll stay<br/>
		With my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>With a certain amount of curiosity and determination B'Elanna headed for the direction were she thought the voice was coming from. Crawling through the cramped tubes and more than once bumping her head at the ceiling of the Jeffries tube, she approached the source of the voice. Now she could hear the song much better.</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br/>
		I won't stay in a world without love</i></p>

		<p><i>So I wait and in a while<br/>
		I will see my true love smile<br/>
		She may come, I know not when</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna hesitated. 'She'? She remembered that in the version of Vonda Shepard it was 'He'. But intend on listening to the song and finding the one who sang it, she dismissed the thought.</p>

		<p><i>But when she does I'll know<br/>
		So baby until then lock me away<br/>
		And don't allow the day here inside<br/>
		Where I hide with my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't really notice were she was heading, fully concentrated on the voice that so wonderfully sung this great song ...</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br/>
		I won't stay in a world without love</i></p>

		<p>... so she was surprised to find herself in front of a mesh ventilation panel. The voice came out of the room behind it.</p>

		<p><i>So I wait and in a while<br/>
		I will see my true love smile<br/>
		She may come, I know not when</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna glanced through the panel to see who the voice was...</p>

		<p><i>But when she does I'll know<br/>
		So baby until then, lock me away</i></p>

		<p>... and was totally shocked as she discovered that she glanced into Cargo Bay 2, the voice thick with emotion, the one that carried the tune so beautifully was ... Seven of Nine, Voyager's resident ex-Borg.</p>

		<p><i>And don't allow the day here inside<br/>
		Where I hide with my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe it. Was this the woman she had thought of as the "Borg Ice Queen"? The always so cool, logical and ... irritating ex-drone?</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br/>
		I won't stay in a world without love<br/>
		I don't care what they say</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna was shocked once again when she saw a tear running down Seven's face. Seven was pained, she could tell.</p>

		<p><i>I won't stay in a world without love.</i></p>

		<p>She felt like she was intruding and wanted to run away from the ventilation panel from where she had just witnessed this enormous emotional display from the human-turned-Borg-turned-human. But another part of her wanted to stay and comfort Seven, to soothe her pain, to... 'stop it right here B'Elanna' she told herself 'Seven is still Seven, the same drone that makes your job all the more hard'. Having convinced herself to leave, B'Elanna turned and began to crawl away when she heard a noise, alerted she turned again, only to see the same ex-drone that had just recently occupied her thoughts.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres, what are you doing here?" Seven inquired in a cold voice. 'Ah, Ice Queen modus' B'Elanna thought, but stopped herself from saying it aloud.</p>

		<p>"I ... I ..." she was a little helpless not knowing what to say.</p>

		<p>"You were observing me to humiliate me." Seven stated stone faced. But now that B'Elanna knew that the ex-Borg had emotions she looked a little deeper and there she saw it, hurt, Seven was hurt.</p>

		<p>"No, ... no Seven that was not it at all" she hurried to explain, "I just ... see Seven, I worked in Jeffries tube 17 to find a damaged isolinear chip and then I heard your voice, singing this song and I was curious, who would sing this song, for I know it is very old and I ... I didn't mean ..." B'Elanna made a slight pause and then continued, "I apologize, I didn't mean to intrude into your privacy, I am sorry." Seven raised her left brow, the one with the implant, in typical unnerving Tuvok manner, clearly surprised although nothing than her raised brow and her eyes ...'beautiful eyes' B'Elanna noticed for the first time ... betrayed her feelings.</p>

		<p>"Klingons do not apologize" she stated matter of factly.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna suppressed her rising anger at the last comment and calmly replied. "Well this Klingon does, besides I am human, too."</p>

		<p>Seven seemed to accept that and B'Elanna was very quickly becoming aware of her whereabouts. "Well, I have to get back to the damaged chip, I am really sorry Seven." And with that she once again turned and quickly left the Jeffries tube with Seven behind.</p>

		<p>But no such luck. Seven followed her and offered her help, "May I help you Lt. Torres? My duty assignments are all finished and I am not due to regenerate in the next six hours."</p>

		<p>"Oh okay, I guess that will get it faster done." She had completely forgotten that she had only taken on this task so she could spend time alone and think about Tom and their relationship, which had seemed to suffer in the last two month or so. And not only that, no, she didn't mind Seven's helping her in the least, even though the two of them had always been a bit antagonistic to say the least. Having reached the tube where the damaged chip was located, the two worked together in an companionable silence.</p>

		<p>'Very efficient' as Seven noticed ...</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 2">
		<h4>Two hours later</h4>

		<p>"Seven?" B'Elanna asked innocently without turning away from her task. She wanted to ask Seven what was bothering her, but ... Instead of an answer she got ... a song.</p>

		<p><i>As I walk this land of broken dreams<br/>
		I have visions of many things<br/>
		Love's happiness is just an illusion<br/>
		Filled with sadness and confusion</i></p>

		<p>She was doing it again, Seven was singing. B'Elanna watched her from the other end of the Jeffries tube, where she was still trying to find this darned chip. Seven was at the other end of the tube, trying to find the chip, too, but obviously her mind was not completely on the task.</p>

		<p><i>What becomes of the broken-hearted<br/>
		Who had love that's now departed<br/>
		I know I've got to find<br/>
		Some kind of peace of mind, maybe</i></p>

		<p>This song B'Elanna didn't know, but the lyrics sounded sad and desperate. Seven sounded sad and desperate. Singing with so much passion, she seemed to have forgotten about B'Elanna being with her in the Jeffries tube. For the half-Klingon know for sure Seven would not knowingly expose herself so much in front of the chief engineer, who in the past had been more of an enemy than anything else to her.</p>

		<p><i>The fruits of love grow all around<br/>
		But for me they come tumbling down<br/>
		Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger<br/>
		I can't stand this pain much longer</i></p>

		<p>'This animosity is something I am going to end', B'Elanna silently decided. Seeing Seven so unusually emotional had changed her perception of the former Borg. Seven was without a doubt human, with human emotions, there was no longer a "Tertiary adjunct to Unimatrix 01". Just a young woman trying to rediscover her humanity. This time B'Elanna did not try to convince herself, that this was still the 'old Seven', for in her heart she knew she had been wrong before.</p>

		<p><i>I walk in shadows searching for light<br/>
		Cold and alone, no comfort in sight<br/>
		Hoping and praying for someone to care<br/>
		Always moving and going nowhere</i></p>

		<p>'Wow B'Elanna you sure have changed your mind fast, just two-times hearing her sing and two hours silently working together and you want to be her friend?' An annoying little voice inside her spoke. 'A few hours ago you hated her' the voice spoke on. 'I didn't hate her I just ... didn't like her very much', she argued the annoying voice.</p>

		<p><i>What becomes of the broken-hearted<br/>
		Who had love that's now departed<br/>
		I know I've got to find<br/>
		Some kind of peace of mind, baby</i></p>

		<p>"Oh great now I am talking...eh thinking to myself" B'Elanna murmured under her breath as to not to interrupt the singing that had her thinking so much about the singer.</p>

		<p><i>I'm searching though I don't succeed<br/>
		But someone look, there's a growing need<br/>
		Oh she is lost, there's no place for beginning<br/>
		All that's left is an unhappy ending</i></p>

		<p>Once again having completely forgotten her work, she stared at the singing Seven, no longer shocked to see the beautiful ex-Borg sing, but captivated by the beautiful and passionate voice.</p>

		<p><i>Now what becomes of the broken-hearted<br/>
		Who had love that's now departed<br/>
		I know I've got to find<br/>
		Some kind of peace of mind</i></p>

		<p>There it was again, the pained look in Seven eyes, B'Elanna rather felt it than really saw it, but she knew it was there. B'Elanna wondered what was wrong with Seven, but could not even really guess, she just didn't know the woman enough, to know what could be bothering her. Having only a day before thought that nothing could bother the impeccable drone.</p>

		<p><i>I'll be searching everywhere<br/>
		Just to find someone to care<br/>
		I'll be looking every day<br/>
		I know I'm gonna find a way</i></p>

		<p>Perhaps the answer lay in the songs she had heard Seven sung. It had been songs about love and the search for it. Was Seven in love? Was that the reason for her singing this songs, with so much emotion? If she was, then she was obviously not happy, when the songs she choose to sing were any indication.</p>

		<p>'Or perhaps she is just feeling a little lonely.' Anyway, B'Elanna was determined to find it out.</p>

		<p><i>Nothing's gonna stop me now<br/>
		I will find a way somehow</i></p>

		<p>That was all the encouragement she needed. "Seven?" B'Elanna carefully began.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 3">
		<p>Seven startled. As lost as she had been in the song and her emotions she had completely forgotten about B'Elanna being there in the Jeffries tube with her. Then something happened, something that left B'Elanna with her mouth wide open in disbelief. Seven of Nine blushed. She seemed to be embarrased that B'Elanna had witnessed her... yeah her what? Emotional outbreak?</p>

		<p>'Embarrasment is irrelevant', Seven decided but couldn't help the blush. "Yes, Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>"You know Seven, you can call me B'Elanna." That was &gt;not&lt;, what she had intended to said, but she couldn't keep it from coming out of her mouth. Why was it so hard to ask Seven if she was okay?</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna..." she said, slightly uncomfortable with using the other womans given name.</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon decided to try it again. "Seven? Is there something bothering you?"</p>

		<p>"Why would you ask that, Lieu...B'Elanna?" B'Elanna smiled, pleased by the other woman's use of her name.</p>

		<p>"You just seem to be disturbed by something, I mean you sung while wor -"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna tried hard not to get angry, when Seven interrupted her rudely. "I wasn't aware that that is against protocol."</p>

		<p>"It is not and don't try to distract me from the topic on hand. I just want to help you ... I want to be your friend." It was Seven's turn to let her mouth hung open in surprise. Not only was this one of very few offers of friendship she had received since being aboard Voyager (her time as drone not counted), surprisingly it also came from the person from whom she would have least expected it. Although B'Elanna one of the few persons was, Seven actually considered 'worthy' of her friendship. She was brilliant with her engines and most competent, and she was also very beautiful, a fact she herself seemed to be oblivious to, all in all B'Elanna Torres, the half-Klingon Chief engineer of the starship Voyager, came very near to Omega. Seven of Nine appreciated the presence of the feisty Klingon.</p>

		<p>"I want to be your friend, too," Seven answered honestly, "but I don't trust you."</p>

		<p>Now that was brutally honest. 'Typical Seven' B'Elanna thought. "You have the right not to trust me, after all I haven't given you much reason to do so, but I am Klingon, Klingons value friendship greatly and in this respect I am very Klingon." B'Elanna had an almost pleading look on her face. She really wanted to be Seven's friend. Although she herself couldn't quite understand why.</p>

		<p>"Acceptable," Seven said in her best Borg-voice, unconsciously testing, if B'Elanna was able and willing to put up with all of herself, human and Borg. But the engineer seemed to have no problems with that, 'that would be the first time, I should note it in my personal log' Seven thought.</p>

		<p>"So now that this matter is solved ... do you want to tell me what bothers you? Perhaps I could help you."</p>

		<p>"Why are you so certain that something is bothering me?" Seven answered the question with a question trying to avoid the issue. She was not at all comfortable discussing personal matters with other people, not even with Captain Janeway, who she thought of as a friend.</p>

		<p>"Oh come on Seven, don't try to tell me you're fine, I have seen that that is not true," B'Elanna said that, remembering the tear she had seen Seven cry and all the emotion and passion she had laid into the songs.</p>

		<p>"I am experiencing some unsettling emotions. I don't know how to describe it, I think I may be . . . lonely." now she had said what was weighing on her it was not hard to continue, "I miss the unity, the many of the collective. But I don't want to be Borg again, I value being an individual. I just . . . don't want to be alone," Seven considered what she had said a moment and then added, "like you."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was stunned into silence, opening and shutting her mouth without saying anything.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna are you damaged?" Seven asked concerned. B'Elanna ignored the question, but finally said something, rather faintly: "Like me?"</p>

		<p>Seven's enhanced hearing of course picked it up. "Yes, you don't want to be alone, that was the conclusion of my field study of you and Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna remembered the study and how angry she had been about Seven's using her and Tom as objects of her study. She also remembered one sentence, which Seven had written in that study. B'Elanna knew about it, because she had retrieved all material Seven had gathered and read it, of course with the permission of the captain. That particular sentence had her doing some serious thinking about her and Tom's relationship for the last month. Just one sentence in a long, very long study. 'Female shows no signs of romantic feelings for the male.' Seven had recognized in mere days what had B'Elanna taken more than a year. But she knew Seven was right. She loved Tom, she really loved him, but just as a friend. By hindsight she was glad that Tom couldn't care less about the study.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't quite know what to say and decided to use Seven's own words when helpless: "Explain," and then she continued, "there was no conclusion to the study."</p>

		<p>"When I begin something, I always end it. So I wrote a conclusion later, after you had requested and received my material, which is perhaps why you don't know about it. However, I came to the conclusion that you stayed together with Lt. Paris, not because you love him, which you don't , you don't have the symptoms typical for such state of mind," Seven sounded like she thought being in love was a mental illness, B'Elanna thought, "but because you don't want to be alone." Seven concluded.</p>

		<p>All this was said in typical Seven manner, matter of factly and letting no emotions on. B'Elanna shortly wondered how Seven had managed to turn the conversation from being about herself to being about B'Elanna, but this thought quickly submerged in the mass of thoughts and feeling that came crashing down on B'Elanna. 'She is right, she is right ...' sounded her inner voice. B'Elanna sat in the Jeffries tube, slumped down, head on her hands and tried to sort out what repercussions this particular insight would carry with it, when suddenly the Capatin's voice came in over the comm: "Red alert, all hands to battle stations ..."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 4">
		<p>"What the..., why does something like that always happen in such moments?" B'Elanna didn't really realize she had spoken her thoughts out aloud. "Let's get to engineering, quickly." With that she turned, not waiting for Seven to respond. With the ex-Borg following B'Elanna, the both of them proceeded as fast as possible towards engineering, but crawling through cramped Jeffries tubes, was something that certainly prevented a fast pace. But after two minutes that had seemed like hours the familiar looks of engineering greeted B'Elanna's eyes. Relief showed on B'Elanna's face, but quickly left as she took note of the chaos that was occurring in her engine room. In the whole place crew was running around, shouting, doing repairs and trying to avoid being thrown on the deck by the trembling and moves up and down that Voyager made. 'Check the inertial dampers' the chief engineer in B'Elanna noted.</p>

		<p>Seven on her heels she went as fast as her legs would carry her, to her station, to assess the situation.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Mr. Paris get us away from here," Janeway ordered, while trying to stay in her seat at the center of the bridge.</p>

		<p>"I'd gladly do that, Ma'am, but -" Tom was rudely interrupted by Ensign Harry Kim, the operations Officer, "Captain, the navigational systems just went off-line and I can't get them back." "See, and it seems like the Helm controls are damaged, too," Voyager's Helm's man continued. The distress he felt, crept into his voice as he too tried to stay in his seat. The pilot felt helpless, he knew all to well that when the systems were damaged even the best flying skills couldn't save you, only feisty half-Klingon engineers could.</p>

		<p>The Captain seemed to think the same: "Janeway to Engineering," the captain hailed.</p>

		<p>"Torres here, yes Captain," B'Elanna replied, but she was still focused on her station, trying to reroute power and assigning jobs to her engineering team.</p>

		<p>"We need the navigational systems and Helm controls, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"I am doing my best here, Captain, but we have to get out of this nebula, before I can get the systems on-line again -"</p>

		<p>"And we can't get out of the nebula without them. A vicious circle." The Captain stated.</p>

		<p>That was the time Seven saw fit to interrupt the conversation. "Captain, there is a solution to this problem."</p>

		<p>"Seven! I had no idea you were in engineering." The captain was surprised, since Seven's battle station was under normal circumstances Astrometrics. But being shaken and assaulted by particles of a nebula were hardly normal circumstances, Janeway decided.</p>

		<p>"I was assisting Lt. Torres with a repair," Seven declared.</p>

		<p>Now, that was a surprise, these both working peacefully and voluntarily together?</p>

		<p>"What are you proposing?" Janeway asked.</p>

		<p>Seven began to explain: "We could use the navigational systems of one of the shuttles to plot a course out of the nebula -"</p>

		<p>"So far so good Seven, but how would we pilot Voyager, helm controls are part of the navigational systems." B'Elanna interrupted, not seeing where Seven was heading, with her proposal.</p>

		<p>"I was getting to that point, Lieutenant," Seven answered patiently.</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry."</p>

		<p>Janeway was surprised; to see them interacting that politely with each other was certainly a new development. Seven still didn't get the concept of politeness completely, but at least now she was trying.</p>

		<p>"We would have to manually pilot."</p>

		<p>The captain didn't get Seven's point, there was no such option as to manually pilot Voyager. "How would we do that Seven?" she asked.</p>

		<p>"Borg protocol 21 alpha subsection 9." Seven stated as if that would be perfectly clear.</p>

		<p>But Janeway and the bridge crew still didn't get it, even Tuvok had raised his eyebrow, the only indication of him not understanding, what Seven was talking about. But it seemed like B'Elanna knew exactly what Seven meant. "Wow, Seven that is brilliant. How could I have forgotten that? Captain, do we have permission to proceed?" B'Elanna asked her Captain over the comm systems, thanks to Kahless the internal communication was one of very few systems that were undamaged by the particle bombardment that had Voyager helplessly drifting in this nebula. She too seemed to think everybody knew what she and Seven where talking about.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I don't understand, what is this Borg protocol?"</p>

		<p>"As you know our course is normally controlled with the Helm controls. The controls are nothing more than an interface between the pilot and the propulsion systems, the pilot programs courses into the computer and the Helm controls use this data to calculate when and how much power must be led to the propulsion systems. When on Borg ships the Helm controls get somehow damaged than protocol 21 alpha subsection 9 becomes valid and one or two Borg drones act as interface between the pilot and engines." B'Elanna made a slight pause.</p>

		<p>Janeway wondered how she knew so much about Borg procedures, even though she had stated how much she despised them.</p>

		<p>"But Captain we have to hurry for if I am right, the nebula will destroy us in 2 hours 30 minutes, if we don't get out of it."</p>

		<p>"2 hours 34 minutes and 34 seconds, to be precise, Lieutenant." Seven mentioned.</p>

		<p>"Whatever you say, Seven." B'Elanna sounded more amused, than annoyed by Seven's correction of her words. Janeway began to wonder, what had happened to have such an impact on the interaction between them. But there was no time for wondering, in the moment, so she decided to ask Seven about it after this mess was out of the way.</p>

		<p>That was all the explanation Janeway needed. "Mr. Paris take the Delta Flyer out and send the needed data directly to engineering, you have 5 minutes."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain." He got up and sprinted to the turbo lift.</p>

		<p>"I guess you and Seven are going to act as interfaces?" Janeway asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Captain we're the only ones qualified enough to do that," B'Elanna responded.</p>

		<p>"Captain," Tuvok calmly spoke up, "the structural integrity can't withstand the constant bombardment of dexter particles and is failing, it is also loosing power, which will accelerate its failure."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?" The comm channel was still open and B'Elanna had overheard all, while on her way to help Seven, who had already begun to modify a console so that from there it was possible to manually control Voyager's course. When she had heard Tuvok she had changed her course and was now furiously hitting buttons on an engineering station. "I'm working on it, Captain. I am working on it -"</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>On the bridge Harry Kim spoke up: "It looks like she is rerouting power from all non essential systems to the structural integrity field."</p>

		<p>"The Lieutenant is succeeding. The system is stabilizing, although still under constant bombardment of the dexter particles. It seems like she is using ... Borg algorithms to make the structural integrity field less vulnerable to those particles."</p>

		<p>Everybody knew that Vulcans had no emotions, but Janeway would bet everything she had that she had heard disbelief in her friend's voice.</p>

		<p>"Borg algorithms?" Chakotay asked. B'Elanna really seemed to know more about Borg than she normally let on.</p>

		<p>"Don't ask me Chakotay," Janeway said. She could only wonder about her chief engineer.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Having succeeded in preventing the failure of the structural integrity field, which would have been fatal, B'Elanna was now again concentrating on getting Voyager out of this nebula.</p>

		<p>"I didn't know you know so much about Borg procedures and technology," Seven stated.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, that's me, full of surprises." B'Elanna replied, her focus on the data stream on her console's display.</p>

		<p>"I couldn't have done better with the structural integrity field," the ex-drone said, a little unsure. She was not used in making compliments.</p>

		<p>Nor was B'Elanna in accepting them, she looked surprised up from the display, not used to such high praise from Seven "Uh, . well, thanks, Seven."</p>

		<p>They both didn't quite know how to go on so they again completely concentrated on their respective consoles.</p>

		<p>"I am receiving now the data, from Mr. Paris," Seven announced and her voice seemed to noticeable cool down when she said the pilot's name. She was standing across from B'Elanna at a modified console. B'Elanna was standing at a similar modified console and was glancing at the former drone.</p>

		<p>It had not taken them long to modify the consoles to control the respectively left and right impulse thrusters. They were going to pilot Voyager by manually adjusting the power that went into the thrusters. A delicate task, but if someone was capable of doing it, it were these two.</p>

		<p>"Torres to bridge. It's going to take us 20 minutes to get out of this nebula captain, permission to start?" B'Elanna hailed the bridge. Janeway's response was short and to the point: "Granted."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Janeway meanwhile wondered if the two could work together as well, as the task on hand demanded it. The two were not known for their good relationship. 'But neither are they known for knowingly endangering the ship because of personal matters' Janeway reminded herself. And ... their relationship seemed to have improved, if she interpreted the signs she had noticed in the right way.</p>

		<p>Author's notes:<br/>
		HeghmeH QaQ DaHjaj - Klingon for "Today is a good day to die"<br/>
		HeghmeH QaQ Hochjaj - Klingon for "Everyday is a good day to die"</p>

		<p>"Permanent data link with the Delta flyer established," Seven announced.</p>

		<p>"Acknowledged. Let's get started. Wish us luck," B'Elanna replied, momentarily forgetting the Borg nature of her friend.</p>

		<p>"Luck is irrelevant, Lieutenant. With our combined abilities and knowledge a success in completing this task is highly probable," Seven declared. She had no doubt as to whether they would succeed or not. They were the best, they would do the job and succeed, it was that easy.</p>

		<p>"True, but Seven, the next time, just say 'good luck B'Elanna', okay?" The half-Klingon replied a little unnerved by the typical Borg answer she had got.</p>

		<p>"I will comply, good luck, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"Good luck, Seven."</p>

		<p>"HeghmeH QaQ DaHjaj," Seven decided to throw in for good measure.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna thought she hadn't heard right. Seven speaking Klingon? This woman was amazing, there were only 3 crew members on Voyager who could speak Klingon, B'Elanna herself, the Doctor and Captain Janeway. Not very surprisingly Tom had never bothered to learn the language of B'Elanna's people.</p>

		<p>She was uncertain as to how to respond but decided just to give the expected answer: "HeghmeH QaQ Hochjaj!"</p>

		<p>Having exchanged niceties, they now again devoted all their attention to their task.</p>

		<p>"The navigational systems of the Delta flyer have plotted a course out of the nebula. Accessing the data." Seven was now hitting buttons on her workstation; B'Elanna was doing the same across from her.</p>

		<p>"Your program is determining the exact amount of energy, we must now adjust the energy flow to the respective thrusters," Seven continued.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The seconds seemed to stretch to minutes, the minutes to hours as Seven and B'Elanna silently worked together to get Voyager out of that darn nebula, that was so full of dangerous particles. B'Elanna had no time at all to think about the discoveries she had made earlier. About Seven's feelings, about her feelings. When Voyager finally slid out of the nebula and was sufficiently remote from this intricate stellar phenomenon, she let out a sigh and hit her controls to shut down Voyager's impulse engines. But even now there was no time to think, about Seven, or about the relationship with Tom, for she first had to go attend a senior officers meeting. And after that there was still enough left to do in Engineering and sometime in the near future she had even planned on sleeping for more than 3 hours in one piece.</p>

		<p>It had been 5 hours since B'Elanna had taken on the task of finding the damaged chip in the Jeffries tube. 'One more thing to do,' she mentally noted, as she remembered that she hadn't completed that task.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Seven had no idea, what emotional turmoil she had caused in B'Elanna when she had stated something rather obvious. She assumed that everyone exerted the same practice of not lying to oneself, so it never occurred to her that Torres had never before consciously confronted her feelings for the pilot, or rather the lack thereof.</p>

		<p>Seven, too had much to do before she could really think about the new developments in her relationship with Voyager's chief engineer. Astrometrics were part of the navigational systems, so she had a lot of work waiting for her in her domain. She also had to do some serious research about friendship, because never before she had bothered to research this particular topic, it had seemed like a waste of time, since nobody besides a hologram and Janeway had made efforts to become her friends, anyway.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>In the conference room the senior officers and Seven and Neelix were gathering. When all had sat down Janeway spoke up, "Let's get started. Doctor please begin," she ordered, for she first wanted to know how her crew was.</p>

		<p>"There were only five injured and no-one too badly. No casualties. Oh by the way, Captain, I need Seven down in Sick bay for at least half an hour after this meeting," the doctor reported.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, I have work to do in Astrometrics, if you need an engineer, I am sure Lt. Torres...."</p>

		<p>"But I need no engineer, Seven, I need you. Naomi Wildman was among the injured and she requested your presence in sick bay. As her physician I am sure it would help to accelerate the healing process. Happy patients get faster healthy again."</p>

		<p>"With the Captain's permission, I will comply." Seven answered. B'Elanna could see the worry Seven felt for her little friend. The ex-drone looked questioningly at the captain, who silently nodded her permission.</p>

		<p>Janeway felt irrationally responsible for Naomi being injured. She was the only child aboard Voyager and the Captain felt like had she been a better captain Naomi would not be injured now, hell if she had been a better captain, Naomi would have a real home now, on earth and she would have a father and other children to play with. After all it had been her decision that had left them all stranded here in the Delta Quadrant. And now she couldn't even prevent them from further damage. - Janeway snapped out of her self recriminations and decided it was time to continue. "B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Down in Engineering it will take at least 2 days to make all the repairs. I will certainly not again underestimate mere particles," she said.</p>

		<p>"As I am sure no one else on this ship will ever again," Kim interjected.</p>

		<p>"Unfortunately, the particles not only overloaded many of our systems, they also somehow managed to suck energy out of Voyager. Our power reserves are down, we need dilithium, captain."</p>

		<p>"How urgent is this problem, B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Well Voyager could go on another 1 and a half months," B'Elanna admitted. Since she was finished with her report and the captain seemed to have no further questions, B'Elanna wanted to know something. "Call me curious Captain, but I for one would really like to know how we got into this nebula in the first place," B'Elanna asked. She had had no more time to read logs then she had had to think. And if something had damaged systems throughout Voyager that she had to repair, she'd really like to know how they got the chance to do so in the first place.</p>

		<p>Briefly glancing at Tom, a glance that B'Elanna saw, Captain Janeway answered her question. "It seems like someone miscalculated our course, so it was the computer that took us in here."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was now glaring at her boyfriend. "You brought us in here?" she accused, "you could have gotten us all killed, with your incompetence ....."</p>

		<p>"Lt. Torres, hold it, I don't want to hear it. I assure you Mr. Paris has been sufficiently reprimanded, but it was an accident. -"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, an accident that got us all nearly killed and heavily damaged my ship." Oops that was definitely the wrong to say in front of the captain of said ship.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant, last time I checked, Voyager was still 'my' ship, besides accusations will take you nowhere."</p>

		<p>"And are inefficient," Seven added.</p>

		<p>Janeway glared at Seven, believing she had said that deliberately to further aggravate B'Elanna, and the least she needed in this time of crisis was an angry Klingon assaulting a crew member.</p>

		<p>But B'Elanna surprised all, even Seven, when she noticeably calmed down and said, "You know what Seven? You are right. It is inefficient." With that she grew silent and waited for the Captain to continue the meeting.</p>

		<p>The reports from the other departments were short and had nothing important to say, B'Elanna was bored and longed for the chance to get back to her precious engines. Eventually the captain was giving her final orders: "After your visit of Naomi, you are to help in Engineering, Seven, that is if that's okay with you, Lt.," she addressed B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"I would greatly appreciate it, Captain, Seven will be a big help," B'Elanna answered enthusiastically, she was really looking forward to having Seven help her. True the drone didn't ever follow protocol, but she was a genius with her tools, like B'Elanna herself.</p>

		<p>It was at that time, that the captain decided that Seven and B'Elanna had cleared away their differences and were quickly becoming friends. She could tell that by what she had seen and heard in the past hour. Janeway was close to both, well as close as the half-Klingon and the ex-Borg would let anybody get, and had always thought they could be good friends, they had so much in common, not only engineering, but being torn between two heritages, too. But the others were surprised, well except of course Tuvok. And Tom, he was looking suspicious.</p>

		<p>'Of what would he be suspicious,' Janeway briefly wondered, but dismissed the thought as she once again concentrated on the meeting.</p>

		<p>"When Astrometrics are repaired, you do sensor sweeps of the neighbouring space, we need dilithium," she ordered Seven.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Captain," was the ex-drone's reply.</p>

		<p>Janeway ordered, "Dismissed." and the other officers filed out of the conference room. She noticed that Seven and B'Elanna almost immediately after being dismissed began a talk, apparently about how to repair various systems. Tom who tried to get B'Elanna's attention was completely ignored. He was puzzled, but dismissed it as B'Elanna going over to her "chief-engineer-mode".</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 6">
		<p>Back in Engineering B'Elanna assigned the tasks to her crew. She assigned Seven to work with herself, as she knew the others couldn't work with Seven, being either nervous around the ex-Borg or intimidated by her. B'Elanna was neither and with their new understanding she felt she and Seven could work together really good.</p>

		<p>She was right. Since Seven had come back from her visit to sickbay, they both had worked together for more than 2 hours in silence, not uncomfortable but companionable silence. Instinctively knowing when the other needed a tool or what the other was doing. All that silence gave B'Elanna time to think, for what she was grateful, since she really needed to think.</p>

		<p>Contemplating Tom and their relationship, she finally came to the conclusion that it was time, actually past time, to break up with him. The only thing they still shared were arguments, the time when B'Elanna had thought she loved Voyager's pilot was long gone. And Seven of Nine the ex-Drone had cut down right to the reason why she had stayed with him for so long; B'Elanna didn't want to be alone. It was not the honorable thing to do and it was not fair to Tom. So it was only 'logical' to break up, as Seven or Tuvok would express it. Having made this decision she had absolutely no idea on how to do it. Should she just come out and say it or should she . Her quite contemplation was suddenly interrupted when Seven unexpectedly spoke up and said, "It is time for you to ingest nutritional supplements."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna startled. "What?!"</p>

		<p>"You need to 'eat', B'Elanna. I know you worked without a break for the last 7 hours, and since it was 4 o'clock in the morning when you began your shift, and mess hall wasn't open at that time you perhaps haven't even had breakfast. To maintain maximum efficiency you need to eat, now. I will keep you company, we could talk about the repairs while you eat." Seven stated that all with her normal bearing. She wasn't expecting any resistance, for it was futile. And B'Elanna wasn't about to give her any.</p>

		<p>"Err, okay," she was touched by how thoughtful Seven was. And if she was honest she was really hungry, and was even prepared to eat one of Neelix strange concoctions. Although, when she thought about it, he had really improved his cooking over the past 5 years.</p>

		<p>So they went to the mess hall where B'Elanna got a dish, and Seven sat down at a table. "So Seven, you don't eat?" B'Elanna tried to small talk.</p>

		<p>"My alcoves provide all energy I need to maintain my maximum efficiency, but the Doctor has introduced me to eating," judging from the look on her face it wasn't a pleasurable experience.</p>

		<p>"I take it you didn't like it very much," B'Elanna inquired, an amused look on her face.</p>

		<p>Seven just said: "No." Short and to the point as usual, when coming from Seven.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't know what else to say, so she just stopped talking and began eating. While she ate Seven read from the padd she had brought along.</p>

		<p>When B'Elanna had finished eating she looked curiously at Seven, wondering what kind of text captured her so completely. "Seven, what are you reading?" When her new friend didn't answer she tried again. "Seven, hello?"</p>

		<p>Seven startled and finally looked up. She had an unfamiliar glow in her eyes. B'Elanna looked briefly at the padd Seven still held, to anyone other it would have just looked like endless lines of numbers, but she recognized it for what it was: sensor readings in Borg computer language. "You won't believe what I just found, " Seven said cryptically.</p>

		<p>"Are you okay, Seven?"</p>

		<p>That was definitely not like Seven's usual style of speaking and there was something other, she seemed quite pleased with herself?</p>

		<p>"Yes, I was going over the sensor readings of our time in the nebula, before the sensor phalanxes went off-line," Seven explained, gesturing to the padd that lay on the table, "and I found some unusual data indeed, there were verteron emanations in the nebula and an increased level of neutrinos, all indicative of -" Seven had no chance to finish her sentence as B'Elanna interrupted her. "A wormhole." Seven nodded.</p>

		<p>"We need to get back to Engineering, the sensors are as of now our top priority and we need to inform the captain and ...." B'Elanna's mind was racing, all possibilities of this discovery were popping up in her head as she considered what had to be done. "We need to check where it leads to, if it's the right time, the right size, the ...."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?" Seven interrupted B'Elanna, "Perhaps we should first inform the captain."</p>

		<p>"Of course, thanks Seven, my mind just sometimes runs in wild circles. This could be our way home." Suddenly B'Elanna began to fully comprehend what that would mean. Home, the Alpha Quadrant, but not the same place she had left almost 5 years ago, there was no longer a Maquis and .... She was dragged out of her thoughts by Seven who had stood up and was now standing expectantly before her.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, of course let's get to the Captain, although ...... it's your discovery I hadn't a thing to do with it."</p>

		<p>Seven had another opinion. "In fact I merely went over the logs and saw it, the sensors only picked it up because of the recalibrations to the sensor phalanxes you made last week," B'Elanna remembered the recalibrations, after yet another fight with Tom she had had to do something so she picked a system and just tried to enhance it, apparently she had succeeded. "Besides, next to the captain you're the one on the ship who knows most about such phenomena as wormholes."</p>

		<p>Seven took B'Elanna's hand and practically pulled her out of the seat she had occupied and out of mess hall, the Klingon was not protesting but was glad that the mess hall was rather empty at that time of the day, Alpha shift only came in in an hour to eat, so not so many saw her and Seven's interaction. Although the chief-engineer didn't struggle Seven still held her hand, she liked the feeling of the shorter woman's soft but firm hand in her own and made no move to let her go. As for B'Elanna, she felt slowly heat creeping up from her hand to her arm, extending to her whole body. 'Oh Kahless, no that isn't happening, not Seven, I have just come to like her, there is nothing else' B'Elanna tried to convince herself. In her panic she tried to break the contact, yanking her arm away, but Seven did not "comply", only when the turbo lift doors opened and admitted the bridge she let the half-Klingon's hand go.</p>

		<p>"We need to speak with Captain Janeway," Seven took the lead and spoke to Chakotay who was in command of the bridge.</p>

		<p>"The Captain is in her ready room, but I don't think-"</p>

		<p>"Thank you Commander," she said and just proceeded to the ready room door, once again pulling B'Elanna along. The Klingon was quite amused by Seven's behavior, she seemed so childlike in her enthusiasm to get to break the news to Janeway. Also she enjoyed the physical contact, besides the unsettling feelings it caused, there were only few people on Voyager who touched her without thinking it might be dangerous to intrude into a Klingon's personal space. And Seven did it unconsciously, so she did not fear the Klingon, which made B'Elanna happy, but she was quick to ignore that particular feeling. Luckily they were now in the Captain's ready room and B'Elanna could concentrate on the situation at hand.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Neither Seven or B'Elanna saw the gaping mouths on bridge that were caused by the way B'Elanna seemed to like being dragged around by Seven. Tom too was surprised, but not as much as the others, he knew B'Elanna better then most and perhaps saw more clearly what was coming than either she or Seven. 'You didn't see that blonde coming and taking away your girl friend, Tommy boy,' an annoying voice in his head reminded him. He was B'Elanna's friend and in his heart he had always known it wouldn't work out for them, he decided to break up with her before she could do it, for he knew Klingon's took love very seriously and it would probably be easier for her, when he initiated their break up.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 7">
		<p>Janeway looked surprised up from her work, not having heard the door chime, which it hadn't, Seven had just come in without asking and had pulled B'Elanna with her. The Captain just decided to overlook the breach of protocol, she had to do enough as it was. "Whatever brings you here, Seven, B'Elanna?" She nodded to greet them.</p>

		<p>"Captain, we have made an important discovery," Seven began.</p>

		<p>"You have Seven, I had nothing to do with it," B'Elanna interrupted not wanting to claim credit for something she hadn't done.</p>

		<p>"We found a wormhole," Seven explained insisting to give B'Elanna the acknowledgement she had earned. After all Seven herself hadn't been able to increase sensor efficiency as much as B'Elanna had done and she had certainly tried.</p>

		<p>Janeway was speechless, a wormhole? That could be the way home they had searched for, but having to many times before been disappointed by what looked like a chance to get home, she decided to be cautious. "What do we know about it?"</p>

		<p>"That it is there," Seven said and added: "I advise further investigations."</p>

		<p>Janeway was disappointed about the lack of information, but decided that this problem was one to be easily solved. "Make the sensor phalanxes your top priority and after they are repaired make a full scan of the wormhole, we need all information we can get about it. B'Elanna you work together with Seven on this project, let Vorik take over in engineering."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," the two replied in unison.</p>

		<p>Being dismissed they left the ready room and went to Astrometrics. Where they once again worked together and after one and a half hour they had succeeded in repairing the exponentially damaged sensory systems. "Finally," B'Elanna sighed relieved and shut the access hatch.</p>

		<p>Seven was standing at a console accessing the sensor readings that were now freely flowing. "I am getting readings from the wormhole in the nebula . . . it seems stable, but I can say nothing else with the readings I get here."</p>

		<p>"How about we send a spatial probe into the nebula to see where the wormhole leads?"</p>

		<p>"We would first have to determine a way to lessen the impact the nebula has onto our systems, the nebula could harm such a probe, too."</p>

		<p>"No Seven, not when we use a small enough probe, and we just need a class four probe, which is small enough not to attract these darned particles, but can still send us all telemetry we need. It is even possible to send it through the wormhole, we'd just have to strengthen the shields for the rough trip through the wormhole."</p>

		<p>"But-"</p>

		<p>"No buts, Seven, it is just perfect."</p>

		<p>"-we have no class four probe."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna run quickly over all available probes in her mind and found that Seven was right, they had used the last one to investigate the event horizon of a black hole. It never returned. The engineer went quickly over all possibilities that were left and found just one option. "Well then we will have to build a new one."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The next few days went by quickly. Seven and B'Elanna built a new probe and while working together so closely they managed to form a friendship, they were seen together even on off duty hours and not only talking about their project. They bonded in these days, and discussed the amazing similarities between them, for example being torn between two heritages or their fondness of 20th century music. The latter really surprised B'Elanna, true she had heard Seven sing songs of that era, but had expected that the beautiful ex-drone had some logical reason for that. That Seven simply liked singing had not occurred to her, not even when she had heard the emotions the ex-Borg put into her singing. B'Elanna also talked with Seven when Tom surprisingly broke up with her and how she hadn't expected him to do so, before she had the chance to do it, she also told the ex-Borg how relieved she was now that this matter was resolved. And Seven spoke with B'Elanna about how she tried to fit in but didn't seem to succeed. But there was one thing they didn't talk about: the growing emotions that both were developing for the other, both insecure about what to do about them and how it would effect the other .</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Janeway had in an effort not to get hopes up only told her senior staff about the wormhole, which now seemed to have been a wise decision, for it only lead to a point in the Gamma Quadrant that was even farther away from the Alpha Quadrant than the part of Delta Quadrant they were in now. Even with the Bajoran stable wormhole it would take them longer than if they just continued their journey home from here. Just another chance that didn't work out, just another chance for Janeway to indulge in self-reproach about it being her fault that Voyager was so far away from home.</p>

		<p>She however didn't get the chance to live the latter out to its full extend, as Seven caught up on her mood, the ex-drone saw more than she normally let on, and told her to "stop self pitying and be a good Captain again, the Captain who made the Voyager a home away from home for many of the crew."</p>

		<p>Janeway had been really caught off guard by this one. She wanted to ask Seven about it, but the beautiful blonde had already left the ready room when Janeway had overcome her speechlessness. 'Well at least this nebula was good for morale,' the tired Captain thought, contemplating the new friendship of B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine, which had increased working efficiency down in Engineering, because if the Lieutenant was in a good mood her staff was in a good mood, too. And an Engineering crew in good spirits made for Voyager being repaired much earlier, and even some systems working better than before.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Are you disappointed that the wormhole didn't lead to the Alpha Quadrant?" The question from Seven came out of nowhere, both sitting at a table in mess hall, with Seven reading a padd and B'Elanna eating a meal. It was a habit they had developed in the last few days, B'Elanna would eat in silence and in the meantime Seven would read some text, and after B'Elanna being finished they would talk, about work or something other that came to their minds.</p>

		<p>Laying down her fork and knife and pushing away her dish, she answered the question. "Yes, ...... no, not really I guess," B'Elanna made a slight pause and then continued, "well, you see Seven I have more here on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant than I ever had at home. Here I am chief engineer of a Starfleet vessel, there I would probably put into prison by Starfleet. Here I have friends and ." she wanted to say "you", but stopped herself before she could do so.</p>

		<p>"And?" Seven asked, her curiosity piqued.</p>

		<p>"Nothing, okay?"</p>

		<p>Seven nodded, although she was still curious. "You are right B'Elanna from your point of view a life on Voyager is more desirable than a life in Alpha Quadrant, but what about your family?" Seven asked, as she knew family was one of the main reasons the Voyager crew wanted to get home so badly and she had researched the topic in the last few days, when she had time to do so and it seemed like something called "family ties" were quite strong.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna let out a laugh, but it didn't sound like a happy one to Seven, who had heard the half Klingon laugh quite often when they had worked together to built the probe.</p>

		<p>"Family? My mother thinks I am not a proper Klingon, we haven't talked with each other in the last 10 years and my father left us when I was only five. I have no family." The last sentence was said with a sad tone in B'Elanna's voice.</p>

		<p>"She is wrong," Seven stated.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was confused. "What do you mean?"</p>

		<p>"She is wrong about you not being a proper Klingon. You are. You have honour, are a warrior and make an unconscious effort not to violate any Klingon rules."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was speechless. "I do?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. In fact the only un-Klingon behaviour I have seen you do was your bonding with Tom Paris."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 8">
		<p>Seven wanted to continue, but was interrupted by a delighted shout from her little friend Naomi Wildman.</p>

		<p>"Seven!" Naomi had just come into mess hall in search of her godfather Neelix and hadn't expected Seven of Nine to be there. She ran to Seven's table, which earned her a frown.</p>

		<p>"Naomi Wildman, you should not run in the mess hall," Seven said with a stern voice, but the smile that barely touched her lips let Naomi know, the ex-Borg was only teasing.</p>

		<p>Only then the young half-Katarian saw B'Elanna, "Hello Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna who had silently watched the little interaction between the two answered, "Hi, little one. What's up?" The half Klingon had no experience with children and was a little uncomfortable and she was still baffled by Seven's words about her being Klingon. She was not sure what was more frightening that she herself didn't notice it or that there was now someone who knew her well enough to see something like that. She abandoned all thought of that and tried to concentrate on what Naomi was saying.</p>

		<p>"Not much, I am just in search of Neelix and didn't want to ask the computer where he is," Naomi seemed to have no problems talking and had sat down at the table, "but that is not important, may I stay with you?"</p>

		<p>"Of course, Naomi." Seven was quick to answer, she liked the little girl and had not had much time to speak or play with her in the last days. "Perhaps, this would be a good time to ask the Lieutenant you question?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna looked questioningly at Naomi still surprised how good Seven was in handling the kid. "A question?"</p>

		<p>Now Naomi was looking uncomfortable "Err, yes Lieutenant. I wanted to ask you, if you could teach me about the warp core," the little kid nervously asked.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was genuinely surprised. "Me? Why didn't you ask Seven, I am sure ....." B'Elanna was robbed of the chance to continue, being interrupted by Seven.</p>

		<p>"I gave her the advice to ask you, for it is your warp core after all," the ex-drone explained.</p>

		<p>"Isn't Engineering in your curriculum?" B'Elanna asked the child.</p>

		<p>Naomi nodded, "Yes it is, but Vorik insists on 'proper order' and he says, he will teach me about the warp core at the end of the class." Naomi was pouting, obviously not agreeing with the Vulcan Ensign.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna considered her decision a moment, but then decided to give in, "Okay, I will do it, but only, when I have the time, is that all right with you?"</p>

		<p>The kid was beaming, she hadn't expected the half-Klingon to say yes, but was all the more delighted that she had said 'Yes'.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much, Lieutenant," Naomi said and got up from her seat to give the surprised chief engineer an enthusiastic hug.</p>

		<p>Seven who was observing them was beaming, too, never had she thought B'Elanna could be that good with kids. She gazed lovingly at her, but made sure that B'Elanna didn't see it. Naomi however was another issue, she saw the gaze, and even though she was still a child, she knew what such a look meant.</p>

		<p>That was the moment when B'Elanna was hailed by Vorik, "Vorik to Lieutenant Torres."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna seemed to hesitate unwilling to answer and break the moment, but she did so though. "Torres here, yes Vorik?"</p>

		<p>"Sorry to interrupt, but we need you down in Engineering, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>The chief engineer gave a brief nod, although Vorik couldn't see it and said, "I will be there shortly, Torres out."</p>

		<p>She was about to apologize to Seven and Naomi, but Seven stopped her, "It's okay go, hail me when you need help." Torres nodded and then proceeded to Engineering.</p>

		<p>Seven had no idea what that meant for her and just a sentence from Naomi later she wished she had accompanied B'Elanna. "Do you love her?" the little kid asked. The former Borg was not often speechless, actually she had never before been speechless, but Naomi's question made her just that. Seven was completely honest to herself and others and she didn't know how to answer, because she really had no idea whether she loved B'Elanna or not. The only thing Seven knew was, she wanted to be with her, talk with her, feel her... Was that love?</p>

		<p>"I am not sure, but I believe yes." Even Seven was surprised by her own words. The last part had come out without her even thinking about it and it was not what she had wanted to say.</p>

		<p>"That is great, Seven, does she know?" Seven did not know that much about children, but was quite sure that children shouldn't ask such questions. After all what could a little child know about love? Seven thought about that and decided that she knew perhaps more than she herself did.</p>

		<p>"No. I am unsure, if she would welcome my feelings," Seven was uncomfortable discussing this with little Naomi.</p>

		<p>So she was glad when Naomi herself ended the talk, "Perhaps the Captain could help you, oh there is Neelix, bye Seven." And Naomi was away. Saved by the Talaxian.</p>

		<p>Seven thought about what the half-Katarian had said and decided she was right. So she stood up and walked away from mess hall to speak to the captain.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Kathryn was surprised when Seven came into her ready room, once again unannounced. But seeing the look on Seven's face she once again decided to overlook this breach of protocol. 'Sometime I am going to tell her to stop doing this,' she thought to herself, but knew in her heart this wasn't going to happen. She somehow liked that Seven wasn't always following protocol, at least the ex-Borg wasn't doing it in not dangerous situations.</p>

		<p>"So what brings you here, Seven?" she asked.</p>

		<p>And Seven told her, what had her so confused and uncertain as to what to do now. Janeway was astonished but not that taken by surprise, she had seen something like that coming, with B'Elanna and Seven being so obviously made for each other. The captain however did not know how to proceed. What do you tell a Borg in love? Kathryn silently made her decision and then gave Seven, who was waiting, her answer.</p>

		<p>"Seven," Kathryn took a deep breath and then continued, "when you fell as deeply for B'Elanna as you claim, and I know you do, then you should tell her. There is no guarantee that she reciprocates your feelings, you will just have to take the chance."</p>

		<p>Seven was obviously not satisfied with that, but just nodded. "Thank you, captain, I will tell her how I feel." And with that she left Janeway's ready room, leaving behind a captain who was feeling like she had just seen her daughter growing up.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Confess your feelings, the captain had said more or less. And that Seven was now determined to do. B'Elanna and she were in B'Elanna's quarters talking about how they could save energy, for Voyager was still running low on Dilithium after the incident in the nebula. Seven was not quite listening, concentrating more on gathering up the courage to tell the Klingon how she felt.</p>

		<p>"Seven, hey, are you listening?" B'Elanna asked having caught up on Seven's inattention.</p>

		<p>"No, I was thinking about. I need to tell you something," she began. B'Elanna was feeling apprehension, experience had taught her sentences starting like that were no good.</p>

		<p>The ex-Borg was unsure as to how to proceed, but finally decided to just say the truth and continued, "I am feeling attracted to you." Trying to process what her friend had just said, B'Elanna was dumbfounded. She knew that she felt something for Seven, something strong, but that was something she had tried to avoid the last few days and she was not at all ready or prepared when Seven leaned forward and kissed her gently on the mouth. So she panicked. She pulled away from Seven, immediately missing the sensation of Seven's lips on her, but her panic quickly overrode that feeling.</p>

		<p>"I, .... I," she didn't know what to say so she simply ran away as she had always done, when confronted with something she was unable to handle. She turned and fled from her own quarters, leaving behind a sad and confused Seven.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 9">
		<p>Seven of Nine was walking through Voyager's corridors heading towards Cargo bay 2, contemplating what she could have done wrong. Since B'Elanna had run away she was feeling like someone had ripped out her heart, but more so she was concerned that she had hurt B'Elanna with her actions. Did the half Klingon not share her feelings? Seven didn't even want to contemplate that, the thought of loving B'Elanna when the Klingon didn't return the feelings being too upsetting. Whatever it was Seven was determined to find B'Elanna and speak with her about it ..... but that would have to wait, first she had to think about her own feelings and perhaps a philosophical discussion with the captain was in order, philosophical meaning late at night.</p>

		<p>The ex-drone was startled when someone called out for her.</p>

		<p>"Seven may I speak to you for a moment?" It was Samantha Wildman, Naomi's mother and one of very few people Seven would actually call 'friend'. The Ensign was out of breath and a bit nervous, as it seemed.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Samantha?" Seven replied calmly.</p>

		<p>"Seven I know this is a big favour to ask for, but the captain assigned me to this mission to gather dilithium and food, and Neelix is put in command of another mission with the same purpose at the same time and I don't know what to do and you were the only one who came to my mind and ..... would you please take care of Naomi while I am on the mission?"</p>

		<p>The mother was clearly desperate not knowing who else to ask and therefore rambling. Seven was a little surprised at first, it was only rarely that Samantha was send on away missions and whenever that happened the captain made sure that Neelix was on the ship at that time so he could take care of the little girl. It seemed that that was not possible this time. Seven thought about what Sam asked of her and found that she could not decline, Naomi was her friend after all and so was Samantha, she was of course going to help.</p>

		<p>"Calm down Samantha, I will do it," she answered reassuringly, although she wasn't exactly aware of what this babysitting job what include and how long it would take. At least it would take her thoughts away from B'Elanna and the kiss. As she remembered the scene she felt a dull ache in her heart, but she immediately pulled away from the memory to concentrate on the present.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so very much Seven, you have no idea how much it will sooth my concerns of Naomi when I know she is in your care." Samantha looked relieved.</p>

		<p>'Weird', Seven thought, 'I'd have never thought someone would ever trust me, the cold Borg drone, enough to take care of their child, let alone be comfortable with such an arrangement.' Abandoning those thoughts she decided to ask the necessary questions.</p>

		<p>"When are you going, Samantha and how long will the mission last?" Seven asked to get to know how long she would be taking care of her little friend.</p>

		<p>Now Samantha began to uncomfortable again. "The mission starts in 3 hours and we will be gone at least 4 days, longer if we don't find the dilithium we are looking for. I know it is much to ask for, but I trust you with Naomi and the others I know ..... well they don't know Naomi as you do and......."</p>

		<p>Seven smiled slightly, "Samantha. Stop, I already said I would help. If I will have to look for Naomi day and night so to speak, can I sleep in your quarters? Cargo Bay 2 is not exactly the place for a child to sleep in."</p>

		<p>"Yes of course you can sleep in our quarters, but don't you need to regenerate?"</p>

		<p>"Not when I sleep and eat normally, then I only need to regenerate 2 hours a week," Seven explained, she seemed to think a little, "and now you need to go prepare your mission, I will take care of Naomi, I promise."</p>

		<p>The young Ensign looked a little unsure, then she nodded, "You're right. Thanks again Seven. Oh yeah I left you the list on the dining table in the quarters, but I guess with your eidetic memory you won't need it. And yeah ..... could you please take Naomi to Engineering to her appointment with Lieutenant Torres, you know Engineering is restricted and she is not allowed to go there alone. Seven are you alright?"</p>

		<p>While Samantha had been busy giving Seven her instructions, she albeit had noticed the hurt showing on Seven's face when she asked her to take Naomi to Engineering. Little did she know that the mentioning of the half-Klingon had brought that particular look on Seven's normally calm features.</p>

		<p>Seven looked a little confused, but quickly calm covered her face, once again. "No I am alright. And now go, Naomi and I will be fine." Samantha gave Seven a nod, "Okay, see you in four days," and hurried away to prepare the mission and say good-bye to her daughter.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>It was evening on Voyager. Seven was standing in front of the window of the Wildman family quarters. She had just put Naomi to bed, singing to the little half-Ktarian to get her to sleep. It had worked just fine. The little girl first listening intently to Seven's singing, but then gradually drifting away into sleep. And now Seven was standing in front of the window, watching the stars and contemplating the day.</p>

		<p>Working together with B'Elanna, then the lunch in mess hall, interrupted by her little friend, the talk with Kathryn, working away the afternoon in B'Elanna's quarters, ..... the kiss. B'Elanna's running away. It was just too much. Thankfully Sam had come along and now with taking care of Naomi she had something to occupy her thoughts with. Just ..... B'Elanna had a way of disrupting her thinking.</p>

		<p>Even now, watching the stars passing by all she could see was the half Klingon's face, panic written all over it. Yeah panic, but not disgust, no hate ..... perhaps, just perhaps she had feelings for Seven, and just didn't know how to handle them. 'Yeah, keep deluding yourself, face it you are so disgusting that she ran away from her own quarters.' It was unlike Seven to be sarcastic. 'It is also unlike you, to go and fall in love.' That last thought made her stop. She had never before really thought it quite so matter of factly, not even after her still unsure admission to her little friend. 'Face it, you are in love with her - how goes the song - truly, madly, deeply?'</p>

		<p>"I need to tell her," Seven breathed. "She probably thinks I am only attracted to her."</p>

		<p>This new thought brought back life into Seven's body, but she made herself stop, before she could hurry out and go to B'Elanna. 'Not tonight, you have to give her time and you need to sleep now, if you're not gonna regenerate.'</p>

		<p>Giving the stars outside of Voyager a last glance, Seven turned towards Samantha's bedroom, where she was going to sleep the next few days.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 10">
		<p>"Red alert. All Hands to battle stations," Captain Janeway's voice accompanied by the sounds of the red alert klaxons woke Seven of Nine up. A bit disoriented at first, she quickly remembered her whereabouts when one frightened bundle of child came flying into her arms.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what's that?" the frightened child asked her friend.</p>

		<p>"You know that Naomi, it's the red alert, I have to get to Engineering." The half-Ktarian seemed even more in fear.</p>

		<p>"Don't leave me alone Seven, please."</p>

		<p>Seven did not know what to do, she had to get to her battle station, but she couldn't leave her charge alone and Neelix, with whom Naomi normally would stay in such situation, was not available. So she did the only thing left as an option.</p>

		<p>"Come with me, Naomi, but stay out of the way will you?"</p>

		<p>The child nodded.</p>

		<p>Having slept in her clothes the Borg didn't need to change and so proceeded directly to Engineering. It only now occurred to her that she didn't feel any impacts on the ship or the ship rocking or, for that matter, any other sign of a battle. So why had Janeway called them to battle stations? In her hurry to get to Engineering and still keeping an eye on Naomi, she quickly dismissed that thought. The captain would have her reasons. Feeling Naomi's pleading eyes on her as they headed down to Engineering, she picked up the child trying to reassure her and to take a bit of the fear off her little shoulders.</p>

		<p>That was how they arrived in Engineering. Immediately upon entering Voyager's heart she felt the ship rocking and shivering, apparently under enemy fire. She went to her station, sat Naomi down and told her to stay quiet.</p>

		<p>Everywhere in Engineering personnel were running around seemingly doing repairs but nobody seemed to have any idea of what was going on. Seven's logical Borg mind told her to get information about what was happening so she could help more efficiently. Since there was no way to contact the bridge, communication systems had failed, she had to go through the readings herself. A task that would have been easy enough had the computer been working correctly. But ......</p>

		<p>"Seven!" That shout came from the half-Klingon chief engineer, who had only now discovered that the Borg was present in Engineering. The mere mention of her name by B'Elanna made Seven's earlier emotions come back to her, threatening to overwhelm her. Only then did she notice the tone of B'Elanna's voice. Pressed and urgent. Seven turned around trying to see where the shout had come from. There she was. B'Elanna was leaning over a console in front of the warp core furiously hitting buttons.</p>

		<p>"The warp core's going to breach, come over here, we need to readjust the magnetic field constrictors," the half-Klingon shouted trying to make herself heard over the high level of noise present in the engine room. Without really thinking about it Seven turned to help her.</p>

		<p>'Her what? Friend? Love? No time to think about that now.'</p>

		<p>Naomi however had time to think, and followed Seven even though she was told to stay at the station.</p>

		<p>"Why is there no computer warning Seven?" The fear in her voice was quite obvious even to someone as unacquainted with emotions as Seven.</p>

		<p>"What is the child doing here?" the angry voice of the chief engineer asked, but continued to give Seven instructions as they worked together furiously to readjust the magnetic field constrictors.</p>

		<p>Seven went to the console at the other side of the warp core to adjust another constrictor, not all were accessible from the console B'Elanna was working on. Naomi's little form followed her. Reading the display on the console she proceeded to do the work that needed to be done, when a reading sent an expression of shock to her face.</p>

		<p>"There is an energy loop forming, plasma relays are going to fail, LANNA GET AWAY FROM YOUR CONSOLE, IT'S GOING TO ...."</p>

		<p>Seven didn't get the chance to complete her shouted warning as B'Elanna's console exploded right in the half-Klingon's face. Just then everything came miraculously back online again. The warp core that they just had been fighting to keep online was now just fine. Seven however didn't notice the change in the situation as her glance was fixed on the figure lying next to the warp core console. She was frozen in her place, only Naomi's scared voice asking: "Is she alive?" shook her out of her shock. Not hesitating Seven ran to her love - no question there now - and checked for life signs. There were none. At that moment the doctor arrived.</p>

		<p>He ignored Seven, who sat next to the Lieutenant whispering unbelievingly "she is dead, she can't be dead, she can't be. I never told her", and kneeled on the other side of the lifeless chief engineer.</p>

		<p>The medical tricorder in his hand made beeping noises as he scanned her hurriedly. His face took on a fallen expression. He could do nothing for the half-Klingon. Looking up from the now officially dead form of B'Elanna Torres to be greeted by the sight of a crying Seven of Nine, he reached out to touch her on her shoulder trying to console her.</p>

		<p>Suddenly Seven sat upright in her bed. Fear covering her features like a mask. Touching the wetness on her face she recognized that she had cried. She never cried, never. Borg don't cry, humans cry, humans are inefficient. And then it hit her. With all force her dream, or, to be more precise, her nightmare came back to her. The ship being attacked, taking Naomi with her to Engineering. B'Elanna. B'Elanna had died. Unable to stay put in her bed, she got up thinking about the nightmare she had had. Trying to reassure herself that everything was okay, she silently went into Naomi's room and checked on her young charge. She was sleeping peacefully in her bed her stuffed Flotter firmly pressed against her little form. With a sense of relief Seven retreated from the child's room. Her restlessness however wouldn't leave her. She needed to do it, just to prove it to herself. So she did it, giving in to her, as she viewed them, petty human cravings.</p>

		<p>"Computer, where is Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres?"</p>

		<p>The computer gave the answer dutifully. "Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres is in her quarters."</p>

		<p>Seven however was not satisfied yet. "Computer, state the medical status of Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres."</p>

		<p>And yet again the computer replied. "All medical readings concerning Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres are within acceptable ranges for Human-Klingon hybrids."</p>

		<p>Only now was Seven satisfied that her friend was safe. No, not friend, love. And if she died now, she would never know. Silently making a decision, Seven sat down to form plans to achieve her ultimate goal. Making B'Elanna Torres see that she was loved by her and making her return that love. Time for research.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Having spent the night thrashing in her bed, not really getting any rest B'Elanna got up to begin her morning routine. Sonic shower, hair, uniform. Being finished with that the half Klingon decided to stay in her quarters for breakfast. She really didn't want to take the chance of bumping into Seven, remembering, all too well, running away the previous afternoon.</p>

		<p>She didn't really know what had driven her to run. Seven had just made a move she herself had been to frightened to make and she had panicked, probably giving up her one and only chance to tell Seven that she was in love with her. And she was. Contemplating the incident she really had no idea why she had acted as she had.</p>

		<p>She ordered three banana pancakes from the replicator and carried her plate to the table in the living room of her quarters. While sitting down the computer announced, "There is an urgent message for you."</p>

		<p>Not able to figure out what might be urgent, but not urgent enough that she be called on her communicator, B'Elanna got up from her chair. Leaving the pancakes behind, she went to her work station to find out what kind of message this was.</p>

		<p>The name in the sender line, made B'Elanna's heart beat with anxiousness. Seven. What did she want that she couldn't tell her personally? Perhaps she didn't want to speak to her because of B'Elanna's cowardly behaviour yesterday. To stop contemplations that were leading to nowhere, the anxious half-Klingon finally hit the button to open the message and was completely caught off-guard when instead of the expected text displayed on the screen of the work station, a tune began to play. After a few seconds a voice began to sing lyrics.</p>

		<p>I haven't slept at all in days<br/>
		It's been so long since we have talked<br/>
		And I have been here many times<br/>
		I just don't know what I'm doing wrong</p>

		<p>It was Seven. B'Elanna had least expected this from her friend, her love. (Even though Seven didn't know the fiery half Klingon loved her.) Fully concentrating on the voice that was carrying the tune of the song so wonderfully, the Klingon nearly missed the words she was singing. Nearly.</p>

		<p>What can I do to make you love me<br/>
		What can I do to make you care<br/>
		What can I say to make you feel this<br/>
		What can I do to get you there</p>

		<p>Were those questions meant for her? Was Seven asking B'Elanna to love her? B'Elanna didn't know what to do. She did love Seven and perhaps there was a chance that the former Borg would forgive her for running away like that yesterday. When she cared enough to send this song there was a chance, wasn't there?</p>

		<p>There's only so much I can take<br/>
		And I just got to let it go<br/>
		And who knows I might feel better<br/>
		If I don't try and I don't hope</p>

		<p>Seven's singing voice reminded B'Elanna of the day, not so long ago, when she had heard the ex-Borg sing for the first time. Having got to know Seven, the real Seven and not the mask she put on for the crew, in the time between now and then, B'Elanna was no longer surprised to hear emotions in Seven's voice and there were emotions in Seven's voice.</p>

		<p>What can I do to make you love me<br/>
		What can I do to make you care<br/>
		What can I say to make you feel this<br/>
		What can I do to get you there</p>

		<p>'Does she love me? She only said she's attracted to me.'</p>

		<p>No more waiting, no more aching<br/>
		No more fighting, no more trying...</p>

		<p>B'Elanna decided to just go ahead and tell Seven that she loved her, if the song was any indication Seven would reciprocate the feelings, that was at least what B'Elanna hoped.</p>

		<p>Maybe there's nothing more to say<br/>
		And in a funny way I'm calm<br/>
		Because the power is not mine<br/>
		I'm just going to let it fly...</p>

		<p>Just how was she going to do that? This was more difficult than declaring her 'love' for Tom. Here was far more at stake. Her hearts, her soul. Seven.</p>

		<p>What can I do to make you love me<br/>
		What can I do to make you care<br/>
		What can I say to make you feel this<br/>
		What can I do to get you there</p>

		<p>Love me...</p>

		<p>"I love you!" B'Elanna whispered under her breath. "I am so sorry." Her breakfast long forgotten, B'Elanna stormed out of her quarters to find Seven and apologize for her behaviour and tell her she loved her. On her way to the Wildman family quarters, B'Elanna knew that Seven was taking care of Naomi while Samantha and Neelix were away, the determined half-Klingon suddenly bumped into another person. Tom. 'Just great. No time for this now.'</p>

		<p>Having said, "Sorry Tom," she wanted to proceed to her destination, but was held up by a cheerful Tom catching her arm.</p>

		<p>"Hey, what's the hurry? No time to chat with an old friend?" he asked and continued, "I was on my way to you, thought we could have breakfast."</p>

		<p>Patience running low in B'Elanna this particular morning, she interrupted her ex.</p>

		<p>"Tom, I really have no time for this now. Bye." And with that she pulled her arm out of his grip and continued her way, leaving an open mouthed Tom behind.</p>

		<p>'There must be something important, perhaps something with Seven,' the pilot thought.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>'Now what are you going to do? Stand here all day?' a voice in B'Elanna's head asked. The chief Engineer was standing in front of the door to the Wildman family quarters. She was suddenly very nervous and didn't know, what to do. Making a decision and putting it into practice are very different things.</p>

		<p>"Senior officers to the briefing room," came Janeway's voice out of B'Elanna's communicator.</p>

		<p>Saved by the captain, so to speak.</p>

		<p>So B'Elanna turned and headed for the nearest turbo lift with mixed feelings. Relieved that she didn't have to speak to Seven right at that moment, and, at the same time, disappointed at being prevented from declaring her love to Seven.</p>

		<p>Seven. Only now did B'Elanna remember, that Seven was usually present at senior officers meetings, even though she wasn't Starfleet. She was about to face the woman she loved and that woman didn't even know of her feelings. B'Elanna just hoped she could take it.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>When Seven arrived in the briefing room, all the others were already present. She was late because she had to find someone to take care of Naomi. Sitting down in the only available chair (right next to Tom Paris to her dismay) she looked around hoping she would catch a glance of B'Elanna that could tell her how the half-Klingon had taken her 'message'.</p>

		<p>There she was. The half Klingon was sitting next to Captain Janeway, a seat that normally would have been occupied by Chakotay, except the Commander was out in charge of one of the supply missions and not present. B'Elanna's glance seemed to be glued to the table, and she wouldn't look up except when Janeway began talking to the assembled command crew.</p>

		<p>"I guess you're wondering, why I called this sudden meeting." All around the table heads were nodding. Except for Tuvok of course, who was his normal indifferent Vulcan self.</p>

		<p>"Well, this time it's not bad news."</p>

		<p>"That would be a first," Tom Paris gave one of his oh so famous unproductive comments. Though in his defence it had to be said that he was only trying to lighten the mood.</p>

		<p>The captain graciously ignored the remark and got back to what she was saying. "Supply team one has found a huge amount of food and dilithium on one of the planets found by Seven's search."</p>

		<p>They hadn't been sure as to the amount of dilithium the planet was harbouring, because of the nature of dilithium, the scanners could only indicate its presence not its amount.</p>

		<p>"Which one of the planets was that?" Seven asked, not knowing to which planets the respective teams had been assigned.</p>

		<p>Janeway looked a bit surprised. Why should Seven been interested in on which planet the dilithium has been found?</p>

		<p>"PXX345," she answered, "I have ordered the other teams back since they've come up with nothing, and when they're here, we head towards PXX345."</p>

		<p>Janeway looked around the table and then proceeded to give her orders.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I want you to start looking for ways to refine and store the dilithium we'll be digging up. Tom, you'll be assigned to the doctor for our stay here, with Voyager, orbiting a planet there's not much you can do. Tuvok, I want you to assemble security teams of one to two members who will accompany the digging and food teams. Mr Kim you'll be in charge of the main digging team, since you're well acquainted with dilithium. Seven you'll head up another team."</p>

		<p>"Captain, if you don't mind I think I would be more useful here on the ship, helping Lieutenant Torres."</p>

		<p>Janeway gave Seven a surprised glance. It did not happen very often now, that Seven refused an order. The captain thought it might have something to do with Seven's feelings for B'Elanna, but then the Lieutenant seemed equally surprised by Seven's 'suggestion'. And the former Borg drone never let feelings mess up her good judgement and would never do a thing to hinder the efficiency of Voyager.</p>

		<p>"Captain, Seven is right, I need her here more than she would be needed on the planet." When B'Elanna spoke up, Seven was surprised that she had spoken in her favour. In the course of the meeting Seven had gathered from the half-Klingons behaviour, that she had gotten the message and was not delighted by it.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna herself had no idea why she had said something in the first place. Working together with Seven when the air wasn't cleared yet would not be an easy thing to do, but Seven was needed on board Voyager, because, face it, she is a good engineer, and not only because of her Borg knowledge.</p>

		<p>The captain seemed to think about the suggestion of her Astrometrics officer and her chief engineer,</p>

		<p>"Okay, Seven you will be assigned to engineering, that's all then - " Janeway tried to conclude the meeting, but was interrupted when once again Seven spoke up.</p>

		<p>"Captain, the scans of the planet indicated that it has a nature and climate comparable to earth's, may I suggest that we land Voyager and have some shore leave?"</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine suggesting taking some time off? Wasn't that inefficient? But she was right the crew did need some time off, especially since it had been quite some time since the last shore leave they had been granted. And Voyager did not often happen to discover a planet that was uninhabited, resourceful and had a breathable atmosphere. All in all it seemed to be a pretty sound idea.</p>

		<p>"Okay, as soon as all supplies we need have been taken aboard, the whole crew will be granted shore leave. I will have Commander Chakotay work out a vacation plan," the captain finally agreed and then after looking around she gave them a nod and added, "You're dismissed."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 11">
		<p>"Seven?"</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine stopped on her way to the turbo lift and turned. All the time during the meeting B'Elanna had avoided having to meet Seven's gaze. Why would she want to talk to the ex-drone now?</p>

		<p>"Yes, Lieutenant?" she asked consciously using the more formal address over the now more familiar B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>The corridor was empty, so B'Elanna decided to just come out and tell her what she wanted to.</p>

		<p>"We need to talk," she simply stated.</p>

		<p>There was no denying that simple fact, so Seven nodded.</p>

		<p>"You're correct."</p>

		<p>"But this is hardly the place to do that. Would you agree to meet me in my quarters at 8 pm?" The half-Klingon's question sounded insecure.</p>

		<p>Seven thought about it, it was true they had to meet and talk about the events, simply ignoring them was not an option for Seven, she wanted to know if B'Elanna felt anything for her. But she didn't want it to be in B'Elanna's quarters the place holding bad memories and all. So she thought of something else.</p>

		<p>"8pm would be acceptable, I would however rather meet in holodeck 2," she stated in no uncertain terms. There was no arguing with that point. As an after thought she added, "We could have dinner."</p>

		<p>"The holodeck is just fine, dinner, too. Meet you there 8 sharp. See you later." B'Elanna waved good bye, giving Seven no time to respond and perhaps cancel the meeting at all. Her mind didn't recognize that all Seven needed to do to cancel the date - as B'Elanna had begun to think of it -was calling her over the comm. system.</p>

		<p>Seven stood there and stared after the retreating Klingon who was walking away down the corridor in the opposite direction. She had absolutely no idea what she was supposed to think, about how B'Elanna felt. The chief engineer had looked unsure of herself and almost a bit shy and there was no sign of hostile "vibes" -as Samantha had called them- perhaps the Klingon wasn't as opposed to a possible relationship between them, as her running out on Seven had suggested.</p>

		<p>Well there was no time to think about that now, Seven had work to do. So she turned toward the turbo lift and proceeded to get to her workplace.</p>

		<p>
		Later on the bridge</p>

		<p>"The last of the teams has arrived, Captain," a young ensign at OPS announced, she was replacing Ensign Kim, who was down in Engineering helping B'Elanna modify the plasma generator, so it could be used to refine the dilithium that they were going to dig on PXX345.</p>

		<p>Janeway acknowledged the announcement with a nod and got up from her chair.</p>

		<p>"Mr. Paris," she said to the helm's man, "set course for PXX345."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," he curtly replied and then muttered under his breath, "Someone really needs to give this planet a real name."</p>

		<p>Janeway smiled, she had heard the comment, "You're welcome to give it a try, but the name has to be approved of by the one who discovered the planet. Which would be Seven."</p>

		<p>Then she straightened, "But enough idle chatter, I want to get to this planet as soon as possible."</p>

		<p>"The course is set," Tom announced.</p>

		<p>"Engage," Janeway ordered.</p>

		<p>Tom hit a button on his console and in a matter of less than a second Voyager began Warp transit. Gracefully gliding through the depths of unknown space.</p>

		<p>That was when Chakotay entered the bridge, he had been on the last team to arrive at Voyager's coordinates. He nodded as to greet Janeway, "Captain."</p>

		<p>"Commander," she greeted him back, "I take it you have been informed of the situation?" she asked him.</p>

		<p>"Yes, the message we received said that Voyager is heading towards a planet named PX435," the last elicited a few chuckles from the bridge crew. Even the Captain had a slight grin on her face. The name was really too complicated. "PXX345, Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"Well in our message it was named PX435. Either way, that was about it. There is supposed to be a vast amount of dilithium and food on the planet?" he half asked half stated.</p>

		<p>Janeway gave him a nod, "Yes that's about it, except that on Seven's suggestion I ordered that Voyager is to be landed and gave the crew shore leave."</p>

		<p>Chakotay seemed surprised. "Seven's suggestion? She really has come a long way."</p>

		<p>"I guess she has. Well either way since the crew can't have shore leave at the same time we need a vacation plan." The captain told him, the order implicit and not spelled out, she knew he would understand, and he did indeed.</p>

		<p>"I understand, I will start working on it immediately," he replied and began to get up, he was half way out of bridge when Janeway told him, "Commander? Don't start immediately, we have enough time and you have just been on an away mission. Get some sleep," when he seemed to be about to protest, she added, "That is an order. Commander."</p>

		<p>There was no way avoiding it, so he gave up and proceeded off the bridge.</p>

		<p>Satisfied Janeway turned to Paris, "Ensign, how long will it take for Voyager to arrive at . the planet?" She consciously avoided mentioning the planet by its designation.</p>

		<p>"5 and a half hours," he replied.</p>

		<p>Janeway acknowledge the answer and got up from her chair heading for her ready room. Just before entering it she ordered, "Tuvok, you have the bridge."</p>

		<p>Tuvok's, "Aye, Captain", was lost in the hiss the doors made when she entered the ready room.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>In Engineering chief engineer Lieutenant Torres had already assigned her team to their respective duties. Harry, herself and Vorik were working on refitting the plasma generator, while Seven was temporarily heading up the department, so B'Elanna wouldn't have to concern herself with administrative duties and the likes.</p>

		<p>So in essence Seven spent the afternoon doing paperwork that normally should have been done by B'Elanna. But she didn't mind, at least it was keeping her from working together with B'Elanna who seemed slightly discomfited by Seven' s proximity. Seven just hoped she hadn't destroyed any chance to be friends with the fiery chief engineer, for she valued her as a friend and thought she could keep her own feelings in check if called for. That was at least what she hoped for.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately the term "administrative tasks" also included doing the grunt work when most of the other personnel were assigned to special projects. And there had been a nasty failure of the plasma relays in Jeffries tube 34 and plasma was leaking out of its line. She had to dress up in one of the 'monkey suits' as B'Elanna called them. They were designed to protect repair personnel in places with gravity and were not as uncomfortable as space suits but, recalling the time on the demon class planet when she had had to wear such a suit, she decided, not by much.</p>

		<p>Though she was annoyed - as far as that was possible for Seven of Nine -that B'Elanna had left her with all the less than desirable tasks, she was still looking forward to the meeting on the holodeck at 8 o'clock. When that last thought went through Seven's mind she immediately recognized something. It was late. She had been so caught up in all the wonderful duties she had to perform that she hadn't kept track of the time, a first for the Borg. And now it was a quarter past 7pm and Seven hadn't anything prepared for the meeting, yet.</p>

		<p>Panic. That would best describe the state of the ex-Borg when she hurriedly left Engineering heading towards Cargo bay 2. This was new for Seven as she was normally very contained when it came to emotions. All at once various thoughts flooded her mind completely refusing to be put in order, bringing Seven's mind close to chaos as it was unaccustomed to this kind of disorder.</p>

		<p>A program you have to pick out a program. You wanted to chose a dress to wear. Where do you get a design ? Is holodeck time available. Don't let the doctor do the job. Don't be late. Hurry up.</p>

		<p>These and more thoughts were hurling through her head like a hurricane.</p>

		<p>A little thought broke through the unsettling disorder. 'Is that what falling in love will do to me?'</p>

		<p>'Well', Seven decided, 'it's not that bad and B'Elanna is worth any discomfort I might feel.'</p>

		<p>'Let's just hope she feels something for you,' an annoying very un-Borg like voice in her head told her.</p>

		<p>Eventually Seven finished her preparations. And calmed down. But not by much. She was now inside of holodeck 2. Pacing. It was 7.58 pm. Walking up and down, she contemplated what could happen at this meeting, making little last minute adjustments to the program she had running on the holodeck. She was very nervous. Completely out of character. Wanting nothing more than for B'Elanna to love her, a small voice in her head reminded her of all the research she had done, about declaring ones feelings and the various novels on such topics she had read. Many had suggested, that when the desired partner would not love one back, one should settle for friendship so as to at least be near the object of ones affection, when before the development of love on the one side, a friendship had already existed. That was the case here. But Seven knew she wouldn't be able to 'settle' for anything less than love from the Klingon, friendship was not enough, and if B'Elanna was not able to give Seven love, then there would be nothing.  The ache in her heart that those thoughts caused was almost unbearable and Seven could only imagine how much more unbearable it would be if B'Elanna said she wanted nothing more than friendship.</p>

		<p>It was nothing or all. And Seven was prepared to fight for the 'all'.</p>

		<p>The swish of the holodeck doors as they opened made Seven stop her contemplation. And her pacing. It was B'Elanna. She was standing just inside of the holodeck and neither of them consciously noticed when then doors closed again behind B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>Both women had their gazes fixed on each other. B'Elanna being transfixed by the beauty of Seven was gaping at the ex-Borg.  Standing there in the middle of a tropic rainforest of seemingly alien origin (the green sky somehow gave it away) was Seven of Nine, but not the normal Seven everyone knew. Standing before B'Elanna was Seven of Nine the human, not the ex-Borg, she had let her hair down and was wearing a simple blue dress, that brought out the blue of her eyes. Not to mention hugged her in all the right places without being revealing.</p>

		<p>'She is doing this for you.' She heard the thought in her head.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile Seven was just as enamored as the half-Klingon. Never had she seen B'Elanna wear a dress like this. The half-Klingon tended to turn up even to social events in uniform. This however was different. B'Elanna was wearing a wine-colored, sleeveless dress that reached to just above her knees.</p>

		<p>It also showed off all of the Klingon's 'assets' and made Seven speechless.</p>

		<p>There was a chance B'Elanna was returning her feelings. Suddenly a big chance.</p>

		<p>The silence in the holodeck was first broken by B'Elanna, who said "Nice setting." </p>

		<p>And gestured with her hands around the holodeck, the aforementioned rain forest.  However she didn't really take in her environment as she was still looking directly at Seven. The Klingon had had a really hard time coming up with anything to say and after hearing it she realized she'd have better kept her mouth shut. It sounded stupid. All she really wanted to do, was proclaim her undying love for Seven and tell her how beautiful she looked. In light of previous events she refrained, thinking it would be better to have 'this' moving along slow. 'But not too slow,' an insistent little voice in her head amended. And then there was still the attraction matter, did Seven have real feelings for her, or was it purely physical?</p>

		<p>"It is a replica of a tropical rain forest on Beta-Gamma-Orionis," Seven replied.</p>

		<p>'Whoever comes up with such names?'</p>

		<p>Neither had moved since B'Elanna first entered, and B'Elanna began feeling a little self conscious now that she felt that Seven was staring back at her. She felt herself lucky that Seven couldn't see the blush that crept up on her face in the twilight of nearing sunset. Standing in the middle of a thick forest B'Elanna of course couldn't see the horizon or the sun, but judging by the light it had to be sunset.</p>

		<p>"Dinner is prepared do you want to eat?" Seven politely asked, feeling that the heavy talk should probably only approached after dinner. She was a lot more privy to human behavior than most would guess.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna relieved she wouldn't have to think of how to approach the subject just yet, quickly agreed and Seven led the way to a small clearing in the forest, where she had set up the table with the replicated dinner. She felt the occasion warranted the excessive use of replicator rations, even though she wasn't sure where it would lead.</p>

		<p>Dinner conversation was light, both parties reluctant to broach the real reason for this dinner date. B'Elanna dutifully but still sincerely admired the whole setting Seven had prepared and complimented her on it, holding back a compliment on her hostess's apparel for fear of crossing an unnamed border.</p>

		<p>Nearing the end of the excellent dinner, B'Elanna decided it would be time to start off with the 'hard talk'.</p>

		<p>"Seven, " she began, "I wanted to tell you..."</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Torres, report to bridge immediately." The captain. Again.</p>

		<p>Seven was honestly impressed by the string of colorful Klingon curses that came out of B'Elanna's mouth - even if she couldn't understand some of the more colorful sort. But at the same time she wanted to know what B'Elanna had wanted to say, a part of her hoping...</p>

		<p>"Why does she always have to interrupt?" B'Elanna asked not a little bit annoyed. "okay, Seven. It seems like I have to go, but first I have to say something."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded, waiting for B'Elanna to continue.</p>

		<p>"Te Amo." And with that B'Elanna fled the holodeck. Not waiting for a response from Seven, fearing it would be a negative one. And she knew that Seven had understood the words. 'I love you.'</p>

		<p>Her father had taught her Spanish and sometimes she fell back to it when she had something important to say. And this was important.</p>

		<p>Seven in the meanwhile, was still sitting at the dining table. Stunned. Her mouth slightly agape. Trying to process what the petite Klingon woman had just said. After a minute or so the stunned expression on Seven's face turned into one of pure bliss and the huge smile appearing on her lips transformed her whole face.</p>

		<p>Only then did she realize that B'Elanna had fled the room and had no knowledge that Seven returned her feelings and probably thought Seven was only 'attracted' to her. Her choice of words that godforsaken afternoon haunted her. If she had only told B'Elanna then, that she loved her...</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>After leaving the holodeck, checking on Naomi and Samantha, who had returned from her mission, and singing a lullaby to her friend who insisted on not going asleep before she had sung, Seven was finally able to get to cargo bay 2.</p>

		<p>Where she was now. Thinking about a way to tell B'Elanna she loved her, a more direct one than telling her she was attracted to her or singing a song to her. Everything in her screamed to just go to B'Elanna now and tell her, but her more rational self reasoned that the half-Klingon needed her rest and was besides probably still in her impromptu conference with Janeway.</p>

		<p>She stepped into her alcove and closed her eyes and shortly before the regeneration cycle began she saw B'Elanna's face flashing before her "inner eye". She fell "asleep" with a smile on her lips.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 12">
		<p><i>Notes: okay here a little brush up on your knowledge about Klingons: brak'lul is the medical phenomenon of Klingon's having every major organ two times. Klingons howl after one of their one has passed away, to warn the dead warriors in Stovokor, that a new warrior is joining them. .If you don't know what Stovokor is . then Kahless help you!</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna ground her teeth together. She was tired, but she couldn't sleep. Hence she had come down to Engineering, to see if something needed to be done. There had been nothing. So here she was now, in the section where the plasma regenerator was located, trying to get some work done alone.</p>

		<p>Just because she wanted to forget what she had done last night. She couldn't believe how she could have been that stupid. To run out on Seven. Again! And then throwing a hasty "I love you" at her.</p>

		<p>That was not how she had planned to tell Seven she loved her. And she would never get the chance to do that again.</p>

		<p>There was only one first.</p>

		<p>To top everything off, she still didn't know how Seven was feeling.</p>

		<p>"Damn! Why doesn't this stupid thing work?" She shouted at the machine that refused to work.</p>

		<p>She was about to begin a string of curses when, suddenly, she heard a hiss and air moving. The hiss grew stronger and suddenly one of the walls of the room she was in collapsed. Everything that was loose was being sucked into space. Thanks to B'Elanna's Klingon reflexes she was able to grab a hold of the machine that was anchored to the floor of the room.</p>

		<p>Now she heard the red alert. Breathing was becoming almost impossible as more and more air was being sucked into the black nothingness just outside of the confines of Voyager. When B'Elanna finally felt an emergency beam gripping her, the machine she had hung on to exploded.</p>

		<p>The beam disposed the unconscious form of the chief engineer on the main biobed in Voyager's sick bay.</p>

		<p>She had a few burns from the explosion but since the beam had taken her away before the actual thing happened it wasn't as bad as it could have been.</p>

		<p>The doctor rushed to her side.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant? Can you hear me Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>She obviously couldn't hear him. He ran a few scans over her body and worked furiously on the biobed, injecting various hypo-sprays into her lifeless body.</p>

		<p>Suddenly the irregular beeping that came from the biobed changed to a never ending long beep-tone. The doctor was furiously hitting buttons on the biobed controls.</p>

		<p>"Her hearts have stopped beating. Starting resuscitation measures," he said for the computer recording the accident protocols.</p>

		<p>He hit a button. "Now!"</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon's body convulsed briefly, but the constant noise didn't change.</p>

		<p>Seven was standing a few feet away from the biobed looking on as the Doctor worked on reviving B'Elanna Torres.</p>

		<p>The woman she loved.</p>

		<p>She had just entered sick bay. She had heard that B'Elanna had been working on the plasma generator when it had exploded and wanted to make sure she was alright. Taking in the sight of the doctor almost desperately working on B'Elanna, she was painfully aware that her beloved was not alright.</p>

		<p>She wanted to step forward. Do something. Do anything. This whole scene brought back unwelcome memories of the nightmare she had had not so long ago.</p>

		<p>'B'Elanna mustn't die.' That was the only thought in Seven's brain. She still hadn't told her, that she ... loved her.</p>

		<p>But she couldn't do anything.</p>

		<p>"And again!"</p>

		<p>The doctor hit again the button, that was very quickly becoming B'Elanna's lifeline.</p>

		<p>Her body convulsed again. Nothing, the never ending beep resumed.</p>

		<p>The doctor worked over half an hour on reviving B'Elanna. He failed. The steady beep wouldn't change into the reoccurring beep tone that would indicate her being alive.</p>

		<p>"Exitus. 1123 hours. Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres," the doctor said for the computer to record.</p>

		<p>Seven heard the words. She didn't want to hear them. To acknowledge that B'Elanna was dead.</p>

		<p>She silently began crying. She cried for the love she had just lost, for the friend she had lost and she cried because she knew nobody would ever again make her feel like B'Elanna had done.</p>

		<p>She went to the biobed where her love lay dead. She took one of B'Elanna's hands. Closed her eyes. And remembered what B'Elanna would want her to do.</p>

		<p>She raised her head to the ceiling and let out a bone shattering howl. It was heard on all decks of Voyager. And in the widths of Stovokor itself.</p>

		<p>Shortly after she had begun, a weak beep had started again.</p>

		<p>She didn't hear it, since was concentrating on her howl.</p>

		<p>"No need to warn them of me coming, I am still here." a soft voice whispered.</p>

		<p>A voice. B'Elanna's voice.</p>

		<p>Seven stopped. She would always hear THAT voice.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna? How? What?" Seven was confused, sad and glad at the same time.</p>

		<p>The doctor had been a silent onlooker till now, only running scans over the suddenly alive again Klingon, whom he had declared dead just a minute or so ago.</p>

		<p>"It seems that your second heart started working again. After it had stopped beating together with your other heart. - This is a wonder. I have never heard of the brak'lul working in a Klingon hybrid, before."</p>

		<p>"She'll live. You mean she'll live?" Seven asked, awe in her voice. And tears, now ones of joy, streaming down her face.</p>

		<p>"Don't cry, love. Please don't cry," B'Elanna pleaded with Seven.</p>

		<p>A smile broke out on Seven's face a bright and glorious smile. "I love you, too."</p>

		<p>The doctor cleared his throat to remind them, that he was still in the room.</p>

		<p>"It's not over, yet, B'Elanna," he informed his patient. "As an after-effect of the cardiac infarct you have suffered, as a result of the shock the accident gave you, one of your hearts is now in a state of cardiac necrosis. I am afraid I have to remove it before it does any damage," he paused, seeing the fearful look on the normally brave Klingon and the same reflected on Seven's face, he added, "You will be able to live with one heart, but we have to remove this one, immediately."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nodded understandingly, though she hadn't understood most of the medical jargon the doctor had used. She looked up at Seven standing next to her.</p>

		<p>"Will you stay with me, " she asked, "please?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," Seven simply replied. And gave the doctor a look threatening him to not remove her presence.</p>

		<p>The doctor shortly thought about what the ex-Borg could do to him, and gave in. He was still surprised by the admission of love he had witnessed a few moments earlier, but since he had seen it coming not quite as much as it would have otherwise. He was after all Seven's friend and what made her happy made him happy.</p>

		<p>He turned to quickly prepare the operation and hailed Paris to help him. Tom was the only medical aide he had that was capable of assisting in the surgery he was about to perform. Though the doctor wasn't sure if Voyager's pilot could handle the emotional stress of performing major surgery on his ex-girlfriend.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The surgery took three hours and more than once the doctor nearly lost B'Elanna. The only thing that saved her was her sturdy Klingon physiology.</p>

		<p>After these few hours Seven was completely exhausted, mentally exhausted. It had not been easy to watch as the woman she loved had been dead and then later on came near death again. She however refused to leave sick bay and told the doctor, that she would stay till B'Elanna was conscious again.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Okay, people. I want answers. Why is my chief engineer in sick bay with only one heart still beating? And why is there a hole in my ship?"</p>

		<p>Captain Janeway's voice sounded determined and grim as she addressed the assembled senior officers. B'Elanna and Seven's seats being empty.</p>

		<p>Kim began to speak: "It looks like the atmosphere of PXX345 has exceptionally high levels of Xenon. When we entered orbit around the planet a reaction between that Xenon and the Palladium in the reinforced hull of section 34 beta, where B'Elanna was working on the plasma generator, started."</p>

		<p>Kim had been the one to whom Janeway had assigned the task of finding out what had happened. And that he had.</p>

		<p>"The two elements reacted to Palladiumxenit which is very porous. So the hull, where Palladium was in, collapsed, " he explained.</p>

		<p>Janeway wasn't satisfied with that. "That doesn't explain the explosion, or why it only collapsed when we had already been in orbit for hours."</p>

		<p>"Errrmmm, the explosion happened, because the plasma generator is very sensitive to radiation, the Palladium was supposed to reinforce the hull in that particular section and keep any radiation out. When it came into contact with the space radiation, the apparatus ... exploded. And we don't know why the hull only collapsed after a few hours," Kim replied dutifully.</p>

		<p>Janeway nodded. "Mr. Kim you're to continue the investigation, together with a security detail," she ordered him. Normally Tuvok would be in charge of that operation, but since engineering knowledge was needed for this investigation, she had decided to give him this opportunity to show off.</p>

		<p>"Which brings us to another problem we have now, how will we refine the dilithium ."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>a few days later</p>

		<p>B'Elanna once again glanced at the coordinates she had just programmed into the computer. She had no idea where they would take her, but a message from Seven had said to meet her there. And after a day of nothing other to do than rest in sick bay and having only the doctor for company she really wanted to talk to Seven, who had been occupied the whole day with her temporary duty as chief engineer.</p>

		<p>She stepped onto the transporter pad and announced: "Energise."</p>

		<p>As she was separated into her molecules and put back together in a different place, she felt the familiar tingle in her body. It felt good to do something again. After the days in sick bay and having to lie on that damned biobed for such long time, she enjoyed "being out again". Of course Seven's visits had made the whole recuperation thing sooo much more bearable but still.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled remembering how Seven had spent every available minute in sick bay, to be with her. The declarations of love. Seven's protective streak - the ex-Borg had done everything to keep the bored half-Klingon in sick bay for recuperation, when B'Elanna after only a day in sick bay had announced herself fit again. B'Elanna knew for herself that she had been too weak then, but still - even a few hours with only the doctor to keep her company.</p>

		<p>It was a cliff. B'Elanna was standing on a cliff. Looking at a breathtaking view of a setting sun in the horizon. The ocean before her seemed to swallow the big red fireball.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>It was only a whisper. It came from behind her.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna turned, looking at Seven. She was momentarily speechless, Seven was looking so beautiful in her dress.</p>

		<p>She knew she should say something, but not one syllable left her lips.</p>

		<p>Seven, too, didn't, couldn't say anything. She had beforehand laid out all her words carefully, but now everything she had wanted to tell the beautiful, strong Klingon, in front her, had left her.</p>

		<p>Seven took a step forward trying to say something anything. But she just couldn't say a damn thing.</p>

		<p>Seven and B'Elanna had talked much when Seven had been visiting the recuperating half-Klingon. About how they felt and what they wanted to do about it.</p>

		<p>Both wanted a relationship.</p>

		<p>In the last few days however Seven had come to acknowledge that she wanted more, much more.</p>

		<p>She was now only a few centimetres away from B'Elanna's face. Her eyes fixed on the full red lips of B'Elanna. And slowly and oh so gently she leant down, and brushed her lips to those of her beloved.</p>

		<p>"I love you. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you."</p>

		<p>Finally she had said it.</p>

		<p>The fearful look on B'Elanna's face became a smile. the brightest smile she had ever seen on the half-Klingon's face.</p>

		<p>"I ... Seven!"</p>

		<p>Not really wanting to say anything she let her deeds speak for her. She reached up and pulled Seven down, into a long, gentle and loving kiss.</p>

		<p>When they finally needed to come up for air, both were smiling radiantly at the other.</p>

		<p>"I love you, bang'wIj. And I never want to let go off you," she determinedly stated.</p>

		<p>And with that she pulled the tall blonde into her arms and hugged her fiercely.</p>
