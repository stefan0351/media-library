<p>Personal log, Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres</p>

		<p>Stardate, I have no idea, just insert the right time, Computer.</p>

		<p>Hi, Computer, don't I just sound cheerful today? Well there are reasons for it you know. I just broke up with Tom and I can't seem to sleep properly. Okay forget about Tom he's a friend now, and it's beyond me how I could have ever thought I would love him. Perhaps I was just in love with the ides of someone being genuinely interested in me, ugly Klingon, B'Elanna Torres. Well I was not in love and he was only interested in his stupid hobbies. I have to think about what Toby told me once. He said: "You'll never fit in, neither with humans nor with Klingons, just try to accept it and live with it." Guess he was right. I can just imagine what mother would have to say about me talking to a computer. "No proper Klingon talks about feelings, least of all to a computer." And then she would look at me with this disappointment in her eyes.</p>

		<p>Do you know that I always felt guilty about not being Klingon enough for her? Some time ago I was thinking about what is making me despise being Klingon and the only reason I could come up with is being not Klingon enough.</p>

		<p>I didn't sleep much last night. That dream again. I think it was that dream which made me finally decide on breaking up with Tom. There is this peaceful feeling.......endlessly peaceful. Strong arms are holding me, and I feel at home ..... loved. And there is this voice that whispers "bangwIj". I can't recognize the voice, or it's owner, but the person seems familiar. - I never felt that way with Tom, not at home, not loved nor completely cherished. Now I know it was only a dream, but for me there is nothing "only" to it. The bad thing about it is, just when the person lowers the head to kiss me and I began to recognise the person's features, ..... I wake up. Alone. My heart aching for the feeling of the strong arms around me. And after that I can't sleep for the rest of the night.</p>

		<p>The break up was smooth did I mention that Tom agreed with me that terminating the relationship would be the best and that was it. How could I have wasted almost two years with him? Now I don't know. The ship was running quiet today. In fact the only major occurrence in Engineering was between "Barbie Borg" and me. She wanted more power diverted to Astrometrics, I said I would do it later. That was when she said: "If you are incapable of completing the task I will do it myself." How could she? I am the chief engineer I can do any engineering task on this ship. I tried to stay calm and explained to her that protocol demanded I do it myself, but that I have no time at the moment. She said "protocol is irrelevant" and we had a minor argument ... 'til Janeway showed up and stared both of us down. She told us to come to her ready room tomorrow 9 o'clock. There I have something to look forward to ..... It's late, Computer I will go sleep now. Perhaps this time I will see the mysterious person's face, who makes me want to stay in their arms? I am at a loss. Perhaps it is just a fantasy. Chakotay would tell me something about my unconsciousness trying to tell me something, I guess. Now I will really end, and computer? I promise at one time I will record a log that actually makes sense.</p>
