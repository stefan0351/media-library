<p>Personal log B'Elanna Torres Stardate, the day after yesterday, sometime in the morning</p>

		<p>Nice dreams. Oh Kahless. I wish, it were only a dream. I got to bed last night and yeah I had the dream again. She holds me, we kiss, she calls me be'nal, I can't see her face, you know the drill.</p>

		<p>Just it isn't that simply this time. When I woke up, I was lying on the couch. I didn't realize it at that time. I was so warm, so comfy and ..... so not alone. Somebody was holding me! A female somebody. First I thought I was still dreaming, but I discarded that thought soon after it popped up in my head. Dreams don't breath on your neck. Well I felt her moving and turned to look at her and ..... looked right into the most stunning pair of blue eyes I have ever seen. The eyes of Seven of Nine.</p>

		<p>In my shock or surprise or whatever I nearly jumped of the couch. I mumbled something like "Kahless how did I get here?"</p>

		<p>Her Borg enhanced hearing caught it of course, "I don't believe that he knows, B'Elanna." I had told her to use my first name, yesterday when we were playing with Naomi. She continued, "A sound hypothesis would be that we sleep walked, for I too can't remember how I got here."</p>

		<p>How can she be so damn logical first thing in the morning?</p>

		<p>"Perhaps we should see the doctor," I proposed. She nodded and we went into our respective rooms to change for the day. And here I am now, talking to you. I have no more time. This quarter sharing is eating away my nerves. Good morning, computer</p>
