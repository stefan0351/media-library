<p>Personal log, Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres</p>

		<p>Stardate ..... doesn't matter, it's a bad day, that's all that matters</p>

		<p>I am determined to make this log entry more orderly, so here goes: After I had made the last entry, this morning, I went to mess hall and ate one of Neelix strange meals. After that I felt not much better and went to Engineering, where I spend my time getting some work done that wasn't considered to be top priority, but I needed something to keep me occupied. The dream was bothering me. I nearly forgot about the captain's order to come to her ready room at 9 o'clock, but I was still standing in front of her ready room door at exactly 9 o'clock. Seven was not there, she is late, I thought, but no. When the door opened and I stepped in, there she was. Apparently she had been there earlier to discuss an Astrometrics report with the captain, I could see the padd lying on the captain's desk.</p>

		<p>Remember my rambling this morning? I said there was hardly anything she could do to punish me. I was wrong. First she held a typical Kathryn Janeway speech about how we should behave as officers and adults and about how she had expected us to have overcome our differences by now. There was one thing that surprised me. I always thought of Seven as the captain's pet. Never would have expected her to dress her down just like me. Well the captain's a woman full of surprises. But that was not all. After having concluded her speech, she said something like: "You're leaving me no other possibility, I can't have two of my best officers constantly arguing about some minor fact."</p>

		<p>When I heard that I didn't in the least see what was coming. Oh she didn't give me the night shift. No, it was worse. "You and Seven are going to stay together in your quarters Lt. Torres, you will live together till you can work together without fighting." I was speechless, she couldn't do that. And then I thought of something, and wanted to tell her that but Seven was faster.</p>

		<p>"Captain, my regeneration units are in cargo bay two," she said, a triumphant smile touching her lips. But no, not so easy. Janeway had of course already expected that. "The doctor informed me that you are capable of sleeping and eating and that you practically don't need to regenerate any longer." Seven was not going to take this. "But captain," she began almost sounding like a whining kid.</p>

		<p>"No buts, Seven or you B'Elanna," she told us with a stern glare. "This is my ship, I will do anything I want to do on it. Especially when it helps the crew, and getting you two to stop arguing will help the ship. I already had maintenance attach an extra room to your quarters, Lieutenant," she told me.</p>

		<p>I had all kinds of thoughts in my mind and not one was even remotely calm or polite, but I managed not to speak any of them out aloud. That would have been my definite end. I was already trying to come up with ways to avoid Seven, when we would have to share quarters. There was no rule saying I had to stay in my quarters all the time after my duty shift. Janeway had thought about that, too and had an answer for that: "And don't even think about just avoiding quarters all the time, B'Elanna," my face fell and I knew I was not looking forward to what she was going to say. "You two are under arrest, you do your duty shifts and then immediately go to your quarters."</p>

		<p>She couldn't do it, I thought but apparently she could. I have searched all day for a Starfleet rule forbidding what she was doing to us, I found none. I still don't understand why she did it, I just had a little argument and now I have to share my quarters with Barbie Borg until further notice? That is just not fair.</p>

		<p>She was finished and dismissed us. I was still trying to fathom what had just occurred. At least I was not the only one, Seven too, looked not too happy. I just wanted to get off bridge after that. Unfortunately today is my day off, so I had to go strictly to my quarters, I was off duty after all. I told the turbo lift to go to my deck, and then looked questioningly to Seven of Nine, who was with me in the turbo lift. This was all her fault.</p>

		<p>At least this whole ordeal took my thoughts off that damned dream. But back to the topic.</p>

		<p>She said the doctor put her on a day off today so she was off duty and had to stay in her quarters. She was sure adapting fast. 'Her' quarters. But what was I expecting, she is Borg after all, Borg live to adapt. So we went to "our" quarters.</p>

		<p>When we stepped in I immediately saw a new door in the left wall. I showed her where the bathroom was and were her room was and then disappeared into my room. I threw myself onto my bed and began cursing this day. I had absolutely no idea what to do, but then remembered some engineering reports that still had to be done. I got up went into the living room where my desk and the padds were and began working. After two hours I was done. I was bored again, if there wouldn't be that stupid arrest I could go to Engineering and repair something or I could go to the Holodeck, but no nothing of that I could do, just because Janeway decided all her officers had to be friends. I wonder why Tuvok and Neelix never had to share quarters? Or Chakotay and Tom for that fact. I was beginning to wonder what Seven was doing to keep herself occupied, but then Borg perhaps didn't get bored.</p>

		<p>At around 1300 the door chimed, I was surprised having awaited no one, with both Tom and Harry on duty today, and they were the only ones visiting me in my quarters, the only friends I have. It was Neelix, Janeway had told him to bring lunch to Seven's and mine quarters. So we ate our lunch, well I ate, Seven merely looked disgusted and tried to eat. I admit it was quite funny to watch her trying to eat.</p>

		<p>Want to know what surprised me? She was not wearing one of her biosuits. She was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. I wanted to ask her about it but kept quiet, there was no need for communication. Perhaps if we ignore each other enough we can convince the captain that we respect the other and won't argue again. Kahless, I am feeling like a child that has been told to behave well and don't argue constantly with her sister. Well Seven is not my sister but the scenario is right.</p>

		<p>I spend the afternoon in my bedroom reading some Klingon romance novel. But my thoughts were continuously drifting to the woman in the dreams. When it was 1800, I hailed Chakotay and asked him to come to my quarters. He didn't object but was surprised by the request, Janeway had apparently not informed him of the not normal measures she had taken to punish Seven and me. I went into the living room and was surprised to find Seven there, she had a tricorder in her hand and appeared to be searching for something. "What are you doing," I asked her suspiciously.</p>

		<p>She merely raised an eyebrow and answered, "I am measuring off space, Lieutenant, I discovered that I was "bored" and tried to think of something to do. The only thing that came to my mind was something for which there isn't enough space in my room. Would you object to having a piano in the living room?" 'Piano?' I thought, but was too speechless to say anything, I shook my head. I couldn't object, could I? What would the captain have done, if I had objected? But then I don't really mind, I am just ..... surprised. Seven playing piano? Barbie Borg is full of surprises. Perhaps that was what Janeway wanted to show me. Doesn't matter.</p>

		<p>Well, I was still speechless from the piano request when I heard the door chime and Seven say, "Come in." At least I wasn't the only one speechless, Chakotay was too, now. Although the reason was something completely different. His mouth was hanging agape, something one didn't get to see often from the First Officer. I sent a silent request to Seven and she seemed to understand as she turned and went into her room. "Shut your mouth, Chakotay, we were punished by the captain, we have to live together," I told him, not exactly following Starfleet protocol when speaking to superior officers. "I see," he obviously saw nothing. "So why did you want to see me?" he asked.</p>

		<p>I told him of my dreams and he listened, only occasionally nodding to something I said or giving any other sign that he listened to me. In the end I was quite annoyed with him, but tried to keep my temper in check. "Now can you tell me what's wrong?" I was impatient. He couldn't.</p>

		<p>Although he said a lot, he didn't answer my question, just gave me the advice to "search my feelings". What surprised me was that he didn't try to interpret the dream at all, that was nothing like the Chakotay I knew. He said that he believed the person was a real person that I know, but wouldn't admit my feelings for. He thought, that that was because she was a woman and I had never before been attracted to women. Thanks Chakotay you helped me so much!</p>

		<p>After he was gone, Seven came out of her room and asked again if it was okay to move a piano into the living room, I just nodded and went off into my room. I heard her move the furniture, and then I heard something that sounded like a beam in of something. But I didn't pay too much attention to what was going on the living room. I thought about "her", the woman of my dreams. I don't share Chakotay's believe that she really exists, she is just a symbol for something, that dream expert Chakotay couldn't figure that out, is beyond me.</p>

		<p>When Neelix brought supper he was surprised by the changes that had occurred in the room in just a few hours, but he didn't mention it. We ate together, this time Seven really ate, and then I went back into my bed room but only to get me the padd with the romance novel and then I lay down on the couch to read, as it was my habit. Seven seemed unsure as to what to do. She eventually sat down at the piano and began to play. I am going to deny this later, but she plays wonderfully. I had no idea she could do that, but then ..... Borg always do everything perfectly, don't they?</p>

		<p>Well, I was in for another surprise, when Ensign Wildman hailed Seven, "Wildman to Seven of Nine." The ex-Drone interrupted her play and answered, oblivious to my being there, too. "Seven here, yes Sam?" "I got your message Seven but I can't get Naomi to sleep, can we come to you for the lullaby?" Lullaby? There was no explanation so I put the pieces together myself. Seven sings lullabies to Naomi to get her to sleep? There was definitely more to Barbie Borg than I first had thought.</p>

		<p>Seven seemed more human talking to Sam, "Of course, you know were I am." She had apparently sent them a note and explained what had happened. "Thanks Seven, Wildman out." Seven turned looked at me and blushed a bit. Oh no, I thought, she is really human; "blushing" of all things was definitely human, I decided.</p>

		<p>So Naomi and her mother visited "our" quarters and Seven sang for Naomi. This too I am going to deny later, but Seven sings even more wonderful than she plays the piano. After Sam had left with a sleeping Naomi in her arms, Seven resumed her playing the piano. Sometime along what she was playing, I completely forgot what I was reading and just listened to her play. Perhaps we can be friends after all.</p>

		<p>I wished her a good night and went into my bedroom and here I am now, speaking to you, Computer. That was my day, orderly and in all details. The only positive thing about it was, that Seven played the piano. I am now under arrest and have to live together with an ex-Borg who sings and plays the piano and I can't even get out of my quarters, because I am under arrest. Although hearing Seven sing or play the piano isn't that bad. I just hope I won't have that damned dream again. No I guess that isn't right I want to have the dream again, but I don't want to wake up to the lonely reality. I don't want to lie awake in my bed not being able to sleep, because I know I will never experience the same feelings in reality.</p>

		<p>Bye Computer</p>
