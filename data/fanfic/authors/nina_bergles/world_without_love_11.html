<!-- World Without Love \ Part 11 -->

<p>"Seven?"</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine stopped on her way to the turbo lift and turned. All the time during the meeting B'Elanna had avoided having to meet Seven's gaze. Why would she want to talk to the ex-drone now?</p>

		<p>"Yes, Lieutenant?" she asked consciously using the more formal address over the now more familiar B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>The corridor was empty, so B'Elanna decided to just come out and tell her what she wanted to.</p>

		<p>"We need to talk," she simply stated.</p>

		<p>There was no denying that simple fact, so Seven nodded.</p>

		<p>"You're correct."</p>

		<p>"But this is hardly the place to do that. Would you agree to meet me in my quarters at 8 pm?" The half-Klingon's question sounded insecure.</p>

		<p>Seven thought about it, it was true they had to meet and talk about the events, simply ignoring them was not an option for Seven, she wanted to know if B'Elanna felt anything for her. But she didn't want it to be in B'Elanna's quarters the place holding bad memories and all. So she thought of something else.</p>

		<p>"8pm would be acceptable, I would however rather meet in holodeck 2," she stated in no uncertain terms. There was no arguing with that point. As an after thought she added, "We could have dinner."</p>

		<p>"The holodeck is just fine, dinner, too. Meet you there 8 sharp. See you later." B'Elanna waved good bye, giving Seven no time to respond and perhaps cancel the meeting at all. Her mind didn't recognize that all Seven needed to do to cancel the date - as B'Elanna had begun to think of it -was calling her over the comm. system.</p>

		<p>Seven stood there and stared after the retreating Klingon who was walking away down the corridor in the opposite direction. She had absolutely no idea what she was supposed to think, about how B'Elanna felt. The chief engineer had looked unsure of herself and almost a bit shy and there was no sign of hostile "vibes" -as Samantha had called them- perhaps the Klingon wasn't as opposed to a possible relationship between them, as her running out on Seven had suggested.</p>

		<p>Well there was no time to think about that now, Seven had work to do. So she turned toward the turbo lift and proceeded to get to her workplace.</p>

		<p>
		Later on the bridge</p>

		<p>"The last of the teams has arrived, Captain," a young ensign at OPS announced, she was replacing Ensign Kim, who was down in Engineering helping B'Elanna modify the plasma generator, so it could be used to refine the dilithium that they were going to dig on PXX345.</p>

		<p>Janeway acknowledged the announcement with a nod and got up from her chair.</p>

		<p>"Mr. Paris," she said to the helm's man, "set course for PXX345."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," he curtly replied and then muttered under his breath, "Someone really needs to give this planet a real name."</p>

		<p>Janeway smiled, she had heard the comment, "You're welcome to give it a try, but the name has to be approved of by the one who discovered the planet. Which would be Seven."</p>

		<p>Then she straightened, "But enough idle chatter, I want to get to this planet as soon as possible."</p>

		<p>"The course is set," Tom announced.</p>

		<p>"Engage," Janeway ordered.</p>

		<p>Tom hit a button on his console and in a matter of less than a second Voyager began Warp transit. Gracefully gliding through the depths of unknown space.</p>

		<p>That was when Chakotay entered the bridge, he had been on the last team to arrive at Voyager's coordinates. He nodded as to greet Janeway, "Captain."</p>

		<p>"Commander," she greeted him back, "I take it you have been informed of the situation?" she asked him.</p>

		<p>"Yes, the message we received said that Voyager is heading towards a planet named PX435," the last elicited a few chuckles from the bridge crew. Even the Captain had a slight grin on her face. The name was really too complicated. "PXX345, Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"Well in our message it was named PX435. Either way, that was about it. There is supposed to be a vast amount of dilithium and food on the planet?" he half asked half stated.</p>

		<p>Janeway gave him a nod, "Yes that's about it, except that on Seven's suggestion I ordered that Voyager is to be landed and gave the crew shore leave."</p>

		<p>Chakotay seemed surprised. "Seven's suggestion? She really has come a long way."</p>

		<p>"I guess she has. Well either way since the crew can't have shore leave at the same time we need a vacation plan." The captain told him, the order implicit and not spelled out, she knew he would understand, and he did indeed.</p>

		<p>"I understand, I will start working on it immediately," he replied and began to get up, he was half way out of bridge when Janeway told him, "Commander? Don't start immediately, we have enough time and you have just been on an away mission. Get some sleep," when he seemed to be about to protest, she added, "That is an order. Commander."</p>

		<p>There was no way avoiding it, so he gave up and proceeded off the bridge.</p>

		<p>Satisfied Janeway turned to Paris, "Ensign, how long will it take for Voyager to arrive at . the planet?" She consciously avoided mentioning the planet by its designation.</p>

		<p>"5 and a half hours," he replied.</p>

		<p>Janeway acknowledge the answer and got up from her chair heading for her ready room. Just before entering it she ordered, "Tuvok, you have the bridge."</p>

		<p>Tuvok's, "Aye, Captain", was lost in the hiss the doors made when she entered the ready room.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>In Engineering chief engineer Lieutenant Torres had already assigned her team to their respective duties. Harry, herself and Vorik were working on refitting the plasma generator, while Seven was temporarily heading up the department, so B'Elanna wouldn't have to concern herself with administrative duties and the likes.</p>

		<p>So in essence Seven spent the afternoon doing paperwork that normally should have been done by B'Elanna. But she didn't mind, at least it was keeping her from working together with B'Elanna who seemed slightly discomfited by Seven' s proximity. Seven just hoped she hadn't destroyed any chance to be friends with the fiery chief engineer, for she valued her as a friend and thought she could keep her own feelings in check if called for. That was at least what she hoped for.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately the term "administrative tasks" also included doing the grunt work when most of the other personnel were assigned to special projects. And there had been a nasty failure of the plasma relays in Jeffries tube 34 and plasma was leaking out of its line. She had to dress up in one of the 'monkey suits' as B'Elanna called them. They were designed to protect repair personnel in places with gravity and were not as uncomfortable as space suits but, recalling the time on the demon class planet when she had had to wear such a suit, she decided, not by much.</p>

		<p>Though she was annoyed - as far as that was possible for Seven of Nine -that B'Elanna had left her with all the less than desirable tasks, she was still looking forward to the meeting on the holodeck at 8 o'clock. When that last thought went through Seven's mind she immediately recognized something. It was late. She had been so caught up in all the wonderful duties she had to perform that she hadn't kept track of the time, a first for the Borg. And now it was a quarter past 7pm and Seven hadn't anything prepared for the meeting, yet.</p>

		<p>Panic. That would best describe the state of the ex-Borg when she hurriedly left Engineering heading towards Cargo bay 2. This was new for Seven as she was normally very contained when it came to emotions. All at once various thoughts flooded her mind completely refusing to be put in order, bringing Seven's mind close to chaos as it was unaccustomed to this kind of disorder.</p>

		<p>A program you have to pick out a program. You wanted to chose a dress to wear. Where do you get a design ? Is holodeck time available. Don't let the doctor do the job. Don't be late. Hurry up.</p>

		<p>These and more thoughts were hurling through her head like a hurricane.</p>

		<p>A little thought broke through the unsettling disorder. 'Is that what falling in love will do to me?'</p>

		<p>'Well', Seven decided, 'it's not that bad and B'Elanna is worth any discomfort I might feel.'</p>

		<p>'Let's just hope she feels something for you,' an annoying very un-Borg like voice in her head told her.</p>

		<p>Eventually Seven finished her preparations. And calmed down. But not by much. She was now inside of holodeck 2. Pacing. It was 7.58 pm. Walking up and down, she contemplated what could happen at this meeting, making little last minute adjustments to the program she had running on the holodeck. She was very nervous. Completely out of character. Wanting nothing more than for B'Elanna to love her, a small voice in her head reminded her of all the research she had done, about declaring ones feelings and the various novels on such topics she had read. Many had suggested, that when the desired partner would not love one back, one should settle for friendship so as to at least be near the object of ones affection, when before the development of love on the one side, a friendship had already existed. That was the case here. But Seven knew she wouldn't be able to 'settle' for anything less than love from the Klingon, friendship was not enough, and if B'Elanna was not able to give Seven love, then there would be nothing.  The ache in her heart that those thoughts caused was almost unbearable and Seven could only imagine how much more unbearable it would be if B'Elanna said she wanted nothing more than friendship.</p>

		<p>It was nothing or all. And Seven was prepared to fight for the 'all'.</p>

		<p>The swish of the holodeck doors as they opened made Seven stop her contemplation. And her pacing. It was B'Elanna. She was standing just inside of the holodeck and neither of them consciously noticed when then doors closed again behind B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>Both women had their gazes fixed on each other. B'Elanna being transfixed by the beauty of Seven was gaping at the ex-Borg.  Standing there in the middle of a tropic rainforest of seemingly alien origin (the green sky somehow gave it away) was Seven of Nine, but not the normal Seven everyone knew. Standing before B'Elanna was Seven of Nine the human, not the ex-Borg, she had let her hair down and was wearing a simple blue dress, that brought out the blue of her eyes. Not to mention hugged her in all the right places without being revealing.</p>

		<p>'She is doing this for you.' She heard the thought in her head.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile Seven was just as enamored as the half-Klingon. Never had she seen B'Elanna wear a dress like this. The half-Klingon tended to turn up even to social events in uniform. This however was different. B'Elanna was wearing a wine-colored, sleeveless dress that reached to just above her knees.</p>

		<p>It also showed off all of the Klingon's 'assets' and made Seven speechless.</p>

		<p>There was a chance B'Elanna was returning her feelings. Suddenly a big chance.</p>

		<p>The silence in the holodeck was first broken by B'Elanna, who said "Nice setting." </p>

		<p>And gestured with her hands around the holodeck, the aforementioned rain forest.  However she didn't really take in her environment as she was still looking directly at Seven. The Klingon had had a really hard time coming up with anything to say and after hearing it she realized she'd have better kept her mouth shut. It sounded stupid. All she really wanted to do, was proclaim her undying love for Seven and tell her how beautiful she looked. In light of previous events she refrained, thinking it would be better to have 'this' moving along slow. 'But not too slow,' an insistent little voice in her head amended. And then there was still the attraction matter, did Seven have real feelings for her, or was it purely physical?</p>

		<p>"It is a replica of a tropical rain forest on Beta-Gamma-Orionis," Seven replied.</p>

		<p>'Whoever comes up with such names?'</p>

		<p>Neither had moved since B'Elanna first entered, and B'Elanna began feeling a little self conscious now that she felt that Seven was staring back at her. She felt herself lucky that Seven couldn't see the blush that crept up on her face in the twilight of nearing sunset. Standing in the middle of a thick forest B'Elanna of course couldn't see the horizon or the sun, but judging by the light it had to be sunset.</p>

		<p>"Dinner is prepared do you want to eat?" Seven politely asked, feeling that the heavy talk should probably only approached after dinner. She was a lot more privy to human behavior than most would guess.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna relieved she wouldn't have to think of how to approach the subject just yet, quickly agreed and Seven led the way to a small clearing in the forest, where she had set up the table with the replicated dinner. She felt the occasion warranted the excessive use of replicator rations, even though she wasn't sure where it would lead.</p>

		<p>Dinner conversation was light, both parties reluctant to broach the real reason for this dinner date. B'Elanna dutifully but still sincerely admired the whole setting Seven had prepared and complimented her on it, holding back a compliment on her hostess's apparel for fear of crossing an unnamed border.</p>

		<p>Nearing the end of the excellent dinner, B'Elanna decided it would be time to start off with the 'hard talk'.</p>

		<p>"Seven, " she began, "I wanted to tell you..."</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Torres, report to bridge immediately." The captain. Again.</p>

		<p>Seven was honestly impressed by the string of colorful Klingon curses that came out of B'Elanna's mouth - even if she couldn't understand some of the more colorful sort. But at the same time she wanted to know what B'Elanna had wanted to say, a part of her hoping...</p>

		<p>"Why does she always have to interrupt?" B'Elanna asked not a little bit annoyed. "okay, Seven. It seems like I have to go, but first I have to say something."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded, waiting for B'Elanna to continue.</p>

		<p>"Te Amo." And with that B'Elanna fled the holodeck. Not waiting for a response from Seven, fearing it would be a negative one. And she knew that Seven had understood the words. 'I love you.'</p>

		<p>Her father had taught her Spanish and sometimes she fell back to it when she had something important to say. And this was important.</p>

		<p>Seven in the meanwhile, was still sitting at the dining table. Stunned. Her mouth slightly agape. Trying to process what the petite Klingon woman had just said. After a minute or so the stunned expression on Seven's face turned into one of pure bliss and the huge smile appearing on her lips transformed her whole face.</p>

		<p>Only then did she realize that B'Elanna had fled the room and had no knowledge that Seven returned her feelings and probably thought Seven was only 'attracted' to her. Her choice of words that godforsaken afternoon haunted her. If she had only told B'Elanna then, that she loved her...</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>After leaving the holodeck, checking on Naomi and Samantha, who had returned from her mission, and singing a lullaby to her friend who insisted on not going asleep before she had sung, Seven was finally able to get to cargo bay 2.</p>

		<p>Where she was now. Thinking about a way to tell B'Elanna she loved her, a more direct one than telling her she was attracted to her or singing a song to her. Everything in her screamed to just go to B'Elanna now and tell her, but her more rational self reasoned that the half-Klingon needed her rest and was besides probably still in her impromptu conference with Janeway.</p>

		<p>She stepped into her alcove and closed her eyes and shortly before the regeneration cycle began she saw B'Elanna's face flashing before her "inner eye". She fell "asleep" with a smile on her lips.</p>
