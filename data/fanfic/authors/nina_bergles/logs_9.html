<p>Personal Log, Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres Stardate ....... who cares</p>

		<p>It's 8 o'clock in the evening, my day was bad, very very bad. First waking up to the shock of my life and then the doctor telling us there is no cure for sleep walking, I guess I will have to lock myself in. And then in Engineering I just couldn't stay focused. It was like I was constantly drifting away to the dream ..... So I went to talk to the doctor about it. I was surprised when I found Seven in sickbay, too. That was not all.unfortunately.the doctor talked to us.I now know who dream-woman is. Seven. But what's worse.it was not only some dream picture of Seven, it was her real, Borg annoying, self. Okay forget the Borg, she is human and - apparently the woman I love ..... no, no, no, this isn't happening I don't know Seven, and I am certainly not in love with her. I love the dream or perhaps it's like it was with Tom.me being in love with the idea of someone wanting me.The doctor said the cause of the hallucinations we were having, Seven was having them, too, was that we were too far apart at that time. The mental bond we've formed is apparently strengthening. I don't know how to handle this, we have to stay together the doc said.he informed the captain and now Seven is assigned to Engineering. She is going to be constantly near me, no escaping her presence.what's worse.I don't know if I would really like to escape her presence. It's kinda nice having her near at all times. If she is the woman in my dreams, then I love her, but I can't be in love with Seven, I can't ..... Oh my.when we are sharing dreams, then she has kissed me and she spoke Klingon.she knew who I was, she saw me.and she kissed me.she kissed B'Elanna Torres and she wanted to do it.I don't know what to think. The dreams have me confused, them being somehow real confuses me.</p>

		<p>Seven initiated the kisses when we met in the dreams and she knew who I was ..... Is she in love with me? Am I in love with her? I don't know. There are too much 'I don't knows'. I know I have this strong feeling about the dream-woman, I just don't know where it came from ..... so when I love her, then I do love Seven, don't I?</p>

		<p>It's times like this I want to go all Klingon and fight a few .no strike that.many.holographic warriors, just to get my head cleared up, and I can't even go into my own living room and throw around furniture, 'cause I could hurt Seven with ..... time to resign, confess it to yourself B'Elanna, you love her, you didn't bother if Tom could get hurt when you threw things around .what am I going to do about it? The one time I fall really hard for someone, it has to be a woman, not to mention that she was till two years ago a Borg-drone.there is no need to tell her, it would perhaps be better if I just try to forget 'it' -</p>

		<p>For being a chief engineer, B'Elanna Torres, you are pretty stupid. How can you forget about the feelings you have for someone, if those feelings are strong enough to rip your hearts apart, not to mention that you are constantly near her now.</p>

		<p>This is pointless, I don't know what to do, so I'll just have to see what happens. Just ..... why her .those feelings can't come out of nowhere. True she was the only one who could make me feel after we got those messages from home ..... the Maquis dead. But that was anger, and ..... jealousy I think, she is always so perfect.</p>

		<p>I feel her arms holding me and everything I want is to get back into her embrace. Feeling so safe and.loved.</p>

		<p>I will stop my ramblings here, I will go to bed early and hopefully dream of Seven.if that is the only time I can feel her embrace, then I would gladly dream away my entire life.</p>
