<!-- World Without Love \ Part 1 -->

<p>B'Elanna was in one of her bad moods, she had just had an argument with Tom, again. So she had stopped by in 'her' engines room as she did ever when in a bad mood and had taken on the task of solving an easy but time consuming problem. The toolkit in her hand she crawled though the cramped Jeffries tubes to her aim, a damaged isolinear chip, that had caused various power conduits to malfunction. She had to locate the one chip that was damaged among 45 and that was so time consuming, because the Tricorder couldn't do the Job and she had to test each chip manually. After two hours of work she had gotten halfway over her initial bad mood and completely forgotten Tom who had caused it. Then she suddenly heard a voice, a female voice. It was singing.</p>

		<p><i>Please lock me away<br>
		And don't allow the day here inside<br>
		Where I hide with my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna knew the song. It was one of the few things she had gathered from her relationship with Tom Paris, her appreciation of ancient music. Her favourite singer was Vonda Shepard of the late 20th and early 21st century. She had heard this song sung by Vonda Shepard. It was one of B'Elanna's favourites.</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br>
		I won't stay in a world without love</i></p>

		<p>The voice was full of emotion. Till now B'Elanna had forgotten all about the damaged chip, which she hadn't located yet and overcome with curiosity was trying to determine were the voice came from.</p>

		<p><i>Birds sing out of tune<br>
		And raindrops hide the moon<br>
		I'm okay, here I'll stay<br>
		With my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>With a certain amount of curiosity and determination B'Elanna headed for the direction were she thought the voice was coming from. Crawling through the cramped tubes and more than once bumping her head at the ceiling of the Jeffries tube, she approached the source of the voice. Now she could hear the song much better.</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br>
		I won't stay in a world without love</i></p>

		<p><i>So I wait and in a while<br>
		I will see my true love smile<br>
		She may come, I know not when</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna hesitated. 'She'? She remembered that in the version of Vonda Shepard it was 'He'. But intend on listening to the song and finding the one who sang it, she dismissed the thought.</p>

		<p><i>But when she does I'll know<br>
		So baby until then lock me away<br>
		And don't allow the day here inside<br>
		Where I hide with my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't really notice were she was heading, fully concentrated on the voice that so wonderfully sung this great song ...</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br>
		I won't stay in a world without love</i></p>

		<p>... so she was surprised to find herself in front of a mesh ventilation panel. The voice came out of the room behind it.</p>

		<p><i>So I wait and in a while<br>
		I will see my true love smile<br>
		She may come, I know not when</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna glanced through the panel to see who the voice was...</p>

		<p><i>But when she does I'll know<br>
		So baby until then, lock me away</i></p>

		<p>... and was totally shocked as she discovered that she glanced into Cargo Bay 2, the voice thick with emotion, the one that carried the tune so beautifully was ... Seven of Nine, Voyager's resident ex-Borg.</p>

		<p><i>And don't allow the day here inside<br>
		Where I hide with my loneliness</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe it. Was this the woman she had thought of as the "Borg Ice Queen"? The always so cool, logical and ... irritating ex-drone?</p>

		<p><i>I don't care what they say<br>
		I won't stay in a world without love<br>
		I don't care what they say</i></p>

		<p>B'Elanna was shocked once again when she saw a tear running down Seven's face. Seven was pained, she could tell.</p>

		<p><i>I won't stay in a world without love.</i></p>

		<p>She felt like she was intruding and wanted to run away from the ventilation panel from where she had just witnessed this enormous emotional display from the human-turned-Borg-turned-human. But another part of her wanted to stay and comfort Seven, to soothe her pain, to... 'stop it right here B'Elanna' she told herself 'Seven is still Seven, the same drone that makes your job all the more hard'. Having convinced herself to leave, B'Elanna turned and began to crawl away when she heard a noise, alerted she turned again, only to see the same ex-drone that had just recently occupied her thoughts.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres, what are you doing here?" Seven inquired in a cold voice. 'Ah, Ice Queen modus' B'Elanna thought, but stopped herself from saying it aloud.</p>

		<p>"I ... I ..." she was a little helpless not knowing what to say.</p>

		<p>"You were observing me to humiliate me." Seven stated stone faced. But now that B'Elanna knew that the ex-Borg had emotions she looked a little deeper and there she saw it, hurt, Seven was hurt.</p>

		<p>"No, ... no Seven that was not it at all" she hurried to explain, "I just ... see Seven, I worked in Jeffries tube 17 to find a damaged isolinear chip and then I heard your voice, singing this song and I was curious, who would sing this song, for I know it is very old and I ... I didn't mean ..." B'Elanna made a slight pause and then continued, "I apologize, I didn't mean to intrude into your privacy, I am sorry." Seven raised her left brow, the one with the implant, in typical unnerving Tuvok manner, clearly surprised although nothing than her raised brow and her eyes ...'beautiful eyes' B'Elanna noticed for the first time ... betrayed her feelings.</p>

		<p>"Klingons do not apologize" she stated matter of factly.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna suppressed her rising anger at the last comment and calmly replied. "Well this Klingon does, besides I am human, too."</p>

		<p>Seven seemed to accept that and B'Elanna was very quickly becoming aware of her whereabouts. "Well, I have to get back to the damaged chip, I am really sorry Seven." And with that she once again turned and quickly left the Jeffries tube with Seven behind.</p>

		<p>But no such luck. Seven followed her and offered her help, "May I help you Lt. Torres? My duty assignments are all finished and I am not due to regenerate in the next six hours."</p>

		<p>"Oh okay, I guess that will get it faster done." She had completely forgotten that she had only taken on this task so she could spend time alone and think about Tom and their relationship, which had seemed to suffer in the last two month or so. And not only that, no, she didn't mind Seven's helping her in the least, even though the two of them had always been a bit antagonistic to say the least. Having reached the tube where the damaged chip was located, the two worked together in an companionable silence.</p>

		<p>'Very efficient' as Seven noticed ...</p>
