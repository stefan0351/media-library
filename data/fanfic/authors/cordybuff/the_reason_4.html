<!-- The Reason \ Part 3 -->

<p>In the following weeks Buffy threw herself into her studies, slaying, and friends, leaving her little time to think about Cordelia, who seemed bent on hating her from now on. As much as she wanted to resort to arguments and insults, Buffy simply gave up on her.</p>
<p>Angel was recovering from the demon dimension quite well, and Buffy could almost pretend that he had never had the lapse of evilness that tore them apart. Angel had once again been helping the gang out with the slaying and such, just like old times. Buffy wished she could have their relationship back too, but Angel was strongly set against it, even for the tiniest advance. When they trained together and got too close, they would pull away from each other, angry at the curse that ruled over his soul.</p>
<p>At the peak of his despair, Angel had almost killed himself in an effort to save Buffy from the demon preying on his newly restored soul, but Buffy had shown him that they could be around each other without being lovers...or him killing her.</p>
<p>With her social life under control, Buffy had it good until her mother tagged along for a patrol and sort of witnessed the death of two children. Life was hell during the time which Joyce actually worked against Buffy in order to stop the violence in the town. Willow, Amy, and Buffy were nearly burned at the stake fueled by Giles' research books, all because of yet another demon.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>It was three days before her eighteenth birthday when Buffy started feeling strange. She found herself dizzy and uncoordinated, and almost let herself be staked by a vampire when she went patrolling. Alarmed, Buffy confided her fears to Giles the next morning, hoping he could figure out what was wrong with her. Giles seemed only mildly concerned about it though, and suggested it may be that she was coming down with something. Agreeing to refrain from patrolling until she felt better, Buffy decided to call it a night early.</p>
<p>The next morning, Buffy was questioning Willow about Amy the rat when a loud voice caught her attention. Some guy was yelling at Cordelia for standing him up at the Bronze the night before. Cordelia seemed to have a good handle on the situation, but then the guy decided to take it a step further and grabbed her, pushing her towards the tree. Without thinking about her lacking slayer strength, Buffy rushed up to the pair and attempted to remove the guy's vice-like grip on Cordelia's arm. Tugging on his arm with her entire body, Buffy was tossed backwards as he barely swatted her away. Hitting the stone bench, Buffy winced and heard Cordelia shriek at the offending male, and the following slaps that accompanied.</p>
<p>Giles still being no help, and her friends not being able to figure out what was draining her strength, Buffy simply gave up and went to see Angel. Venting to her ex seemed to do her a bit of good, and as she walked towards home she thought it lucky that she had such good friends, and ex-boyfriends. Of course just as she thought that, a nasty-looking vampire jumped out at her and she wished that that certain ex-boyfriend had walked her home. Now faced with trying to defend herself, Buffy managed to run away until she saw Giles pull up and rescue her.</p>
<p>Driving them back to the library, Giles finally gave into Buffy's plea for help, shocking her with the knowledge that he was the one causing her to be weak....it all being a test for Slayers on the eve of their eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p>Buffy was horrified and deeply upset at Giles' betrayal to her...to her body. He watched her suffer and let her go out to patrol, knowing full well that she would experience the loss of her strength. She began to cry as Giles pleaded for her to understand his actions.</p>
<p>"I can't... I can't hear this."</p>
<p>"Buffy, please."</p>
<p>"Who are you? How could you do this to me?"</p>
<p>Giles reached out to touch Buffy, "I am deeply sorry Buffy. You have to understand..."</p>
<p>Buffy moved away from his touch. "If you touch me, I'll kill you."</p>
<p>"You have to listen to me." Giles begged, his voice betraying his desperation. " Because I've told you this, the test is invalidated. You will be safe now, I promise you. Whatever I have to do to deal with Krelig... and win back your trust..."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at him, her tears almost blurring her vision. "You stuck a needle in me. You poisoned me." She said, the pain clear in her voice.</p>
<p>"What's going on? Oh God, is the world ending?" Came an alarmed voice from behind Buffy. "I have to research a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if the world's ending I'm not gonna bother." Buffy instantly recognized the person to be Cordelia. Why must Cordy come into the library for books NOW of all times?! She thought, turning to walk out of the library.</p>
<p>"You can't walk home alone Buffy, it isn't safe." Giles pointed out quickly.</p>
<p>The Slayer stopped walking. "I don't know you." She simply said.</p>
<p>Cordelia was becoming majorly wigged out by the conversation she was hearing. "Did something take her memory?" she asked Giles. Getting no response from the Watcher, she turned to Buffy. "He's Giles. Gi-les. He hangs out here a lot." She half mocked the blonde. Then she noticed the tears. Oh God, Buffy's crying. It has to be bad if she's crying.</p>
<p>Buffy ignored Cordelia's comments. "Cordelia, could you please drive me home?"</p>
<p>Cordelia was stunned. "Of course." She said quietly, all but forgetting her issues with Buffy. "But if the world doesn't end, I'm gonna need a note." She shot over her shoulder at Giles as she followed Buffy out of the library.</p>
<p>The two girls were silent the entire way to the parking lot, Buffy too upset to speak, and Cordelia simply waiting for Buffy to tell her what she was so angry about.</p>
<p>Driving to Buffy's house, Cordelia almost swerved into a parked car she was so startled when Buffy finally spoke up. "Can we just drive around for a while? I actually don't really feel like going home yet." Buffy asked, staring out the window in a trance.</p>
<p>Cordelia was surprised. Surprised that Buffy wanted to be around her, and surprised that she wanted to comfort Buffy. I still care for her...even after all that's happened. She realized.</p>
<p>"Sure. Where would you like to go?" Cordelia asked gently.</p>
<p>Buffy turned and looked at Cordelia like she had just realized who she was with. What the hell was I thinking asking Cordy to drive me around? She hates me! But then again, she doesn't seem to mind. Damn, I still want her....I wonder if she still feels the same?</p>
<p>"Wherever you want to drive, it doesn't really matter." Buffy said, the angry look she had been sporting since the library gone from her features.</p>
<p>Cordelia thought about it for a moment and then nodded. "Alright." Instead of continuing straight, she turned right, leading them towards the center of town.</p>
<p>"Giles has been poisoning me." Buffy said after a few minutes.</p>
<p>"What?!" Cordelia said incredulously.</p>
<p>"It was a test for my eighteenth birthday. Slayer's get poisoned and temporarily lose their powers....like you probably noticed this morning...and then they get locked up with some uber vamp, and well usually the Slayer dies." Buffy informed Cordelia gravely.</p>
<p>"Are they insane?!" Cordelia almost yelled.</p>
<p>"Giles said they've always done it." Buffy said Giles' name as if he were a vile demon, and it seemed to Buffy that he was quite worse. He betrayed her...</p>
<p>"And this was supposed to happen when? Tonight?" Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>"Uh huh. Anyway, the vampire got free somehow and it almost killed me less than an hour ago."</p>
<p>Cordelia paled at the thought of her friend dying. "What happens now? There's no test seeing as the vampire is free, although he's out looking for you."</p>
<p>"I don't know, I can't really go out and look for him....I don't have my Slayer strength at all right now" Buffy sighed. Thanks to my Watcher.</p>
<p>Cordelia was silent for a moment, then turned to look quickly at Buffy. "Oh God Buffy, what if he knows stuff about you? He could know where you live....he could..."</p>
<p>"My house?" Buffy interrupted. "Why would he know where I lived? I'm supposed to fight him in a controlled environment, I don't think they'd give him that kind of information."</p>
<p>Cordelia shrugged. "You're probably right. Just overreacting I suppose."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Cordelia, surprised by the other girl's comment. "Thank you Cordy." She said smiling, "I'm glad you came into the library tonight."</p>
<p>Cordelia smirked a little, "Yeah, well...stupid Bosnia report I'm supposed to have in tomorrow...I can't believe I put it off until the last day." Smiling into the empty street ahead, she added, "I much rather help you than work on some boring assignment anyway."</p>
<p>"Cordy, despite what has happened in the past two months...um...do you still...."</p>
<p>"Feel anything for you?" Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>Buffy blushed slightly. "Yeah." She said quietly.</p>
<p>Cordelia slowly exhaled, taking her time in answering. "You not telling anyone that Angel was back really hurt me." She said finally. "And the whole thing with Xander and Willow really screwed me up..."</p>
<p>"Cordelia, I truly am sorry. I had to protect him until everyone could see that he's good again." Buffy said sincerely, "And you know I can't be romantically involved with him."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you can't, but you want to be." Cordelia muttered, stopping at a traffic light.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Cordelia, then back at her hands in her lap. "I admit I still have feelings for him, but I won't ever be acting on them. Things have changed, and the same mistakes won't be made again. We've decided to stay close friends...and that is all."</p>
<p>The light turned green and Cordelia turned left, refusing to comment.</p>
<p>"You haven't answered the question yet, Cordy."</p>
<p>"I don't want to answer you. I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"Afraid?" Buffy asked, surprised. "What are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>Cordelia took a deep breath, her face betraying her fear. "I'm afraid of you hurting me."</p>
<p>Buffy opened her mouth to speak, but she closed it and sat thinking for a minute. "Cordelia, I would never intentionally hurt you. I hope you can believe me. She said finally.</p>
<p>"I still care for you." Cordelia said in answer. "As much as I tried to ignore it...God, I just have to look at you and my entire resolve breaks."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at the words. "You did try hard, that I did notice."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for being a complete bitch." Cordelia apologized. "I knew you were trying to make it better."</p>
<p>Buffy half turned in her seat. "It doesn't matter now that I finally got you to talk to me." She teased lightly.</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled, "Well, that about concludes our tour of Sunnydale. Where is our next destination?"</p>
<p>A couple of wonderful ideas went through Buffy's head before she remembered the one that involved the least amount of fun. "As much as I'd love to continue this conversation elsewhere, preferably without you driving...I should get home and make sure mom's safe and all of that. Plus if Giles phoned, all hell will break loose."</p>
<p>Cordelia nodded, "Yeah, make sure everything's all right. Never underestimate the demons around here, I think that's actually something I remember Giles telling us."</p>
<p>As Cordelia drove in the direction of Buffy's house, Buffy started thinking about Krelig, or whatever Giles said the vamp was called. Maybe he HAS found out where I live. "Cordy, instead of dropping me off in front of my house, can you drive down the other side of the block and drop me off there? I'll cut through the neighbour's yard and go in through the back door. That way, in case the vamp is staking out my house, he won't get me...well, unless he's waiting at the back door."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan." Cordelia agreed, turning left instead of straight down the street to Buffy's house.</p>
<p>Stopping the car in front of an unfamiliar house, Cordelia turned to Buffy, her features soft. "Well goodnight Buffy...and be careful." Reaching for the Slayer's hand, she squeezed it lightly.</p>
<p>"I will." Buffy promised. "Goodnight Cordy." Taking off her seatbelt, she hesitated for only a moment before leaning over to kiss the other girl full on the mouth.</p>
<p>Smiling as she broke the kiss, Buffy gently brushed Cordelia's cheek with her fingertips. "Two months...it's been two months since I've kissed you."</p>
<p>Cordelia swallowed, her arm absently wrapped around the blonde's waist. Buffy was practically in her lap now. "Too long..." she agreed.</p>
<p>"Are you busy tomorrow night?" Buffy asked, her voice a pitch lower than usual.</p>
<p>"I have cheerleading practice a stupid dinner with my parents." The brunette answered, leaning forward to brush her lips against Buffy's. "Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"I'll be at the Bronze with the gang....for my birthday. I know you're not exactly on speaking terms with any of them, but I'd love to see you....even if it's across the room."</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled, "I'll try my best to make an appearance then."</p>
<p>Beaming, Buffy kissed her hard, then untangled herself, opening the car door. "Great, hopefully I'll see you then. Goodnight!"Buffy said as she climbed out of the car. She waited until Cordelia drove off before walking around to the back of the house, through the back yard to her back yard. Sweeping her gaze around the area, she cautiously unlocked the back door and entered the kitchen. Eyeing the flowers her absent father sent her for her birthday, she pushed them off the counter and into the garbage. Walking into the hall, Buffy immediately noticed the open front door, and the picture taped to the frame. Mom. That son of a bitch got her. Running upstairs, she quickly gathered her slaying gear, intent on trying her best at killing the vampire waiting for her at the abandoned boarding house.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The gang surprised Buffy the next morning by showing up at her house before school. Sitting in the kitchen, Buffy told them of the events the night before, sans any mention of Cordelia. After the shock of Giles being fired sort of wore off and Buffy's reassurance that the huge gash on her forehead would heal quickly, they all piled into Oz' van and headed for school.</p>
<p>On her way to her first period class, Buffy looked to see if Cordelia was at her locker, but she was oddly absent from the group gathered around her locker area. Usually she held stayed by her locker until about a minute to the bell...which is usually when Buffy walked by. Oh well...it's not like we could have talked anyway. She thought as she walked into Math class.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't see Cordelia at school until Chemistry class that afternoon. Xander and Willow still shared the lab station behind her, which left Buffy to sit with whomever showed up late to class. Cordelia used to be her lab partner, but since the rift, she had moved to the other side of the room.</p>
<p>Just as Buffy had given up hope that Cordelia was even at school that day, she breezed into the classroom. Looking at Buffy, she tilted her head slightly, as if asking if it'd be okay to sit with her. Breaking into a grin, Buffy nodded giving her consent.</p>
<p>Setting her books on the table, Cordelia gave Xander and Willow a neutral look before turning to sit down beside Buffy. Glancing sideways at her friend, she inhaled sharply at the sight of the gash on Buffy's forehead. "Oh my God, Buffy what happened? Was that vampire waiting at your house last night?" she whispered to the blonde, resisting the urge to reach out and touch her.</p>
<p>"When I got home, the vampire had already taken my mom to the place the test was supposed to be performed. Luckily I got him to drink holy water and that killed him." Buffy whispered back.</p>
<p>"You're okay? What about your mom?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine, remember I'm a quick healer...at least I will be when I get my slaying skills back. And mom's fine, he was only after me. He just needed a lure."</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled, "Are you still going to the Bronze tonight?"</p>
<p>"Of course. The annual horror and pain part of my birthday is over. Now it's safe to party." Buffy whispered cheerfully. Buffy turned around and smiled at Xander and Willow, both of whom were staring at the two girls like they were alien beings.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, the lab write-up was supposed to be done in ink, right?" Buffy asked, ignoring the looks of utter shock.</p>
<p>Willow was the first to break her trance, "Er, yeah. The ink of a pen..." she said distractedly.</p>
<p>"Pens have ink." Xander agreed, still staring strangely at Buffy.</p>
<p>Buffy smirked and rolled her eyes at her friends' silliness. "Yeah, I got the pen part down, thanks for the tip."</p>
<p>Xander looked about ready to say something but the teacher called the class to order. Buffy knew there would be questions later though, probably when Cordelia wasn't around.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Later that night the gang made it's way to the Bronze. As soon as Xander arrived the questions began.</p>
<p>"So," Xander said, "Since when does Cordelia come over and sit with you in Chem class?"</p>
<p>"It's not like it's the first time, Xander. Remember, she used to sit there before?" Buffy said neutrally.</p>
<p>"Yeah well ever since...y'know...she's blown us all off, even you Buffy. Why the sudden friendship?" Xander asked sharply.</p>
<p>"Xander, Buffy's allowed to have other friends...even if they are Cordelia....so what's the big deal?" Willow said. "Cordelia doesn't really have any reason to hate Buffy like she does us."</p>
<p>Oz nodded, "I agree with Willow there. Plus she's had to go and make new friends these past couple of months, it's probably nice to go back to some old ones."</p>
<p>Buffy sat there watching her friends debate her friendship with Cordelia. Gee, I wonder what would happen if they knew everything? She thought, sighing. They'd probably disown me as friends.</p>
<p>Cordelia chose that moment to show up, a couple of friends in tow.</p>
<p>"So, did you invite her here?" Xander asked, noticing the entrance of his ex-girlfriend immediately.</p>
<p>"Xander, she doesn't need an invite to come to the Bronze...but yeah, I think I mentioned it." Buffy said angrily.</p>
<p>Xander sighed. "Well that's just great. She can come over here and socialize with you while throwing daggers at Willow and I. Sounds like fun.</p>
<p>"Gee, Xander, I'm so glad you're entertained. Excuse me please." She said sadly, heading for the ladies room.</p>
<p>"Way to go Xander." Willow nearly yelled at her friend. "It's her birthday and you go and make her feel bad. Hasn't her birthday been bad enough without us contributing?"</p>
<p>Xander slumped down in his chair. I just don't want her to get hurt by Cordelia. Why would she want to be friends with her when Cordelia's been nothing but nasty to her for the past two months?"</p>
<p>"So, what you're saying is that you're jealous." Willow said, stating the obvious.</p>
<p>"Hell yes." He admitted. "So, are you going to go in there after her and make things better? Tell her that I'm a jerk or something...and that I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"No, I think I'll wait on that." Willow said, glancing at the door to the ladies room. "Cordelia just went in there after her."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>As soon as Cordelia had walked into the Bronze, she saw Xander glaring at her from the table Buffy sat at. She ignored her ex-boyfriend and looked over to see the Slayer staring at the table top with a miserable look on her face. Suddenly Buffy said something to Xander and stalked off to the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Cordy, where do you want to sit? Over by the stage, or back here?" one of her friends asked.</p>
<p>Looking away from Buffy, she distractedly pointed to the far side. "We'll sit over there. I gotta hit the ladies first though." She said, already walking towards the bathroom.</p>
<p>Pushing the door open, Cordelia immediately saw Harmony and her followers at their usual spot, right in front of the mirror applying layer after layer of make-up. Harmony spied her right away.</p>
<p>"Cor-delia! My, what a surprise to see you here. If you're looking for one of your loser friends...I think that Buffy freak is in the last stall." She said, pointing in the general direction of the far wall.</p>
<p>There had been a time where Cordelia was the one calling Buffy a loser and a freak, but now it was all she could do to not tear Harmony apart with her bare hands. "Buffy isn't a loser." She said coldly, "And if you EVER call her, or any of my other friends losers or freaks again, I'll shove that cheap make-up down your throat. Why the hell do you even come to the Bronze, Harmony? Go home if you're going to spend four hours primping in front of the mirror."</p>
<p>Harmony stared at Cordelia in utter shock. Gathering her bag, she stalked out of the bathroom, her group of wannabes right behind her.</p>
<p>Sighing in relief, Cordelia walked to the last stall, smirking at the thought of telling off Harmony yet again. "Buffy? Are you alright?" she called out softly.</p>
<p>"Not especially." Came the reply from within.</p>
<p>"Can you open the door?" Cordelia asked gently. She waited patiently until she heard the metallic click of the lock. Buffy slowly opened the door and stood looking at the brunette. Shrugging her shoulders, Buffy opened her mouth to say something, but it seemed nothing would come out.</p>
<p>Cordelia stepped closer to Buffy and wrapped her arms around her. "What happened? Was it Xander? I saw him talking to you when you left your table..."</p>
<p>Buffy slipped her arms around Cordelia's waist and sighed. "Xander doesn't quite go for the idea of you and I being friends. He was beating the subject to death out there, and I just couldn't take it." Buffy looked up at Cordelia, "I guess there's just no way I can be with you while they're in the same room...it was stupid of me to think that I could actually have a nice birthday celebration."</p>
<p>Cordelia leaned down and kissed Buffy softly, "Hey, the night isn't over yet. I can't let your birthday end up a total disaster, can I?"</p>
<p>"And just what do you suggest?"</p>
<p>"Well, how about you go back out there...and if Xander's still being an ass, bail when you can and I'll leave right after you."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed, "Oh, alright, if you insist." She mock pouted.</p>
<p>Cordelia smirked, "Of course we'd have to decide on what we'd want to do -" she trailed off as new voices entered the bathroom.</p>
<p>Buffy quickly yanked Cordelia completely into the stall, reaching around the other girl to close the door.</p>
<p>"That's great, now what are we going to do?" Cordelia whispered.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled wickedly and leaned into Cordelia, "Well, we can't talk..." she whispered into her ear, biting down lightly causing the other girl to gasp. Not trusting Cordelia to keep quiet, Buffy quickly moved her mouth down to effectively muffle any other sounds.</p>
<p>Cordelia moved her hands up to tangle in Buffy's hair as their kiss deepened. Swallowing a moan of pleasure, Buffy ran her hands up Cordelia's sides and down her back, eventually settling with griping the brunette's shirt with both hands.</p>
<p>Both girls froze as they heard Willow's voice call out Buffy's name.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" Buffy whispered, pulling away from Cordelia. Straightening her hair and clothing, Buffy called out an affirmation to the redhead.</p>
<p>"How's my face?" Cordelia mouthed as she wiped a smudge of lipstick from Buffy's top lip.</p>
<p>"Damn that Revlon crap..." Buffy swore under her breath in reply as she inspected Cordelia's lips.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" Willow called out from the other side of the room.</p>
<p>"I'm, ah, here in the last stall...with Cordelia." Buffy said as she grabbed some toilet paper and wiped the stray lipstick from around Cordelia's mouth. Shoving the paper in her pocket, Buffy casually perched herself on the edge of the toilet and motioned for Cordelia to unlock the door.</p>
<p>"Is it alright if I come in?" Willow asked from right outside of the door.</p>
<p>"Of course." Cordelia replied, mildly surprising Buffy and Willow. Willow pushed the door open and took in the sight of her best friend sitting directly in front of her and probably her best enemy leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>"You've been in here for quite a while now, I came to see if you're alright. I would have come in sooner, but I noticed that Cordelia had followed you in..." Willow rambled.</p>
<p>Buffy gave the hacker a small smile. "Thanks Wil, I'm sorry I've been gone for so long. I just can't take Xander being a jerk in large doses."</p>
<p>"Well, he told me to tell you that he's sorry and he realized he was acting like an ass, so you can come back to the table and we won't mention...uh, what we were talking about before."</p>
<p>"Me. You were talking about me." Cordelia offered sharply.</p>
<p>Willow winced and looked at Cordelia before turning back to Buffy. "Um...I'm going to go back to the table, okay?" Willow said quickly and almost ran to the door.</p>
<p>Buffy breathed a sigh of relief and looked up at Cordelia. "I know you have every right to dislike Willow right now, but she's really been completely on your side when Xander goes off on a rant. She knows she's partly to blame and she respects you for it. I just wanted you to know that."</p>
<p>"I know. I can see that she's sorry, but it's really hard to forgive what they did. I mean, my entire social life was screwed after that...I was branded as Xander's castoff, no guy would date me and the girls laughed at me."</p>
<p>Buffy stood up and regarded the other girl carefully. "So when you turned nearly the entire school against me when I first got here...did I get over it? Obviously if I'm standing here with you." She said, a hint of a smile played on her lips.</p>
<p>Cordelia rolled her eyes but couldn't resist smiling as well. "This is different, but okay. I will try and remember what you've said."</p>
<p>Buffy reached up and gave Cordelia a quick kiss. "Thanks babe." She said as she brushed by the other girl. "One hour and we're out of here."</p>
<p>"One hour." Cordelia agreed, following the Slayer out of the bathroom. Scanning the back of the club, she quickly made her way over to the friends she had abandoned earlier.</p>
<p>"Cordy, what the hell took you so long? You've been gone forever." One of them asked immediately.</p>
<p>"Sorry, there was a friend in there with...boy trouble. I had to help her out." Cordelia breezed as she claimed an empty seat.</p>
<p>"Broken heart?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, something like that." Cordelia lied.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>An hour later, Buffy managed to leave the Bronze having given the excuse that her mom wanted some quality birthday time with her that night. It went over well considering they knew her father couldn't make it to Sunnydale for her birthday this year. Declining Oz' offer of a ride home was tough, but she managed to convince her friends that her Slayer strength was returning rapidly. Plus Faith showed up after her patrol, so they still had a reason to stay.</p>
<p>Scanning the street, she quickly caught sight of Cordelia's empty car. Where is she? I saw her leave the Bronze before me. Buffy thought to herself, puzzled. Walking cautiously to the car, she suddenly heard muffled grunting and scuffling on the other side of the car. Sprinting to the other side of the street, Buffy took in the sight of Cordelia struggling with a vampire on the ground. The vamp was trying desperately to pin the girl to the ground, but her constantly moving arms made it seemingly impossible. Before the vamp turned to the intrusion, Buffy pulled the stake from her waist and quickly reduced him to dust.</p>
<p>"I sure hope Faith's gonna do another sweep before she heads home tonight." Buffy mumbled as she offered her hand to Cordelia. "It sucks that I can't do it. Are you alright?"</p>
<p>Cordelia took the offered hand and hauled herself up carefully, mindful of her still healing wound. "I'm good, no damage."</p>
<p>"So are you still good to go? Or do you just want to go home...I'd understand if you do." Buffy said, hoping the vamp hadn't ruined the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>"No, I'm fine. Let's get out of here." Cordelia said, searching for her car keys. Spotting them near the rear tire, she scooped them up and unlocked the car. Buffy walked around to the passenger side, keeping an eye on the surrounding area for more vampires.</p>
<p>Cordelia didn't even ask for a destination, she simply started driving. Glad that the destination was far away from vampires, she drove straight out of town towards the coast.</p>
<p>Buffy let herself relax in her seat as the miles flew by, her hand resting lazily on Cordelia's thigh. "Do you know where we're going? Or are you just driving?" she asked.</p>
<p>"What time do you have to be home by tonight?"</p>
<p>"I don't. I told my mom I'd probably be sleeping over at someone's house."</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled. "Have you been to the cliffs overlooking the ocean?"</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head, "No, but mom keeps promising we'll go some day. It's supposed to be a great view."</p>
<p>"It is." Cordelia confirmed. "So that's where we're going."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>By the time Cordelia found the place she wanted to stop, Buffy was asleep. Reaching over, she gently shook the girl's shoulder. "Buffy, we're here."</p>
<p>Buffy opened her eyes to stare through the car's windshield at the star-lit sky. "Wow, the sky's beautiful tonight." She said quietly.</p>
<p>"You haven't even seen the view yet." Cordelia got out of the car, waiting for Buffy to follow before walking near the edge of the cliff. "Check out the moonlight effect on the water."</p>
<p>Buffy looked out at the miles and miles of dark water, the waves illuminated by the moonlight. A few lights from ships speckled the skyline, making her realize just how large the ocean was.</p>
<p>Cordelia stepped behind Buffy and wrapped her arms around her waist. "You like?" she asked softly.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's absolutely perfect." Buffy answered, leaning back into the warm body. "I didn't think there could be such a view at night...everything is so quiet and still. I love it."</p>
<p>"I thought of coming here earlier at the Bronze. We could have gone to my house, or someplace like a coffee shop, but I figured it should be somewhere a little different, seeing how it's your birthday and all. So happy birthday."</p>
<p>Buffy turned in Cordelia's arms. "Thank you." She murmured before kissing the brunette. "So now that you have me out here, what are you going to do to me?"</p>
<p>A seductive smile formed on Cordelia's lips as she pretended to ponder the question.</p>
<p>"Really..." Buffy drawled, "That's just what I wanted for my birthday."</p>
<p>Cordelia kissed Buffy chastely before pulling away from the warm embrace and walking back to the car. Buffy watched as she opened the trunk and studied the contents inside. Finally deciding on what she wanted, she pulled two blankets out and closed the trunk.</p>
<p>"I figure since it's nice out..." Cordelia offered, returning to where she had left Buffy. "It beats the hell out of sitting in the car."</p>
<p>Buffy arched an eyebrow at the brunette's obvious intent, then helped spread the blankets out. Cordelia sat down and looked up at the sky, her arms stretched behind her propping her up. "Y'know, for January this weather is fantastic. It feels like mhpm-" Cordelia's attempt at talking was quickly thwarted as Buffy straddled the object of her affection and kissed her deeply.</p>
<p>Pushing Cordelia's jacket off her shoulders, Buffy shifted her body forward causing the other girl to inhale sharply. Breaking the kiss, Cordelia shot the Slayer a lu st-filled glare. "Impatient, are we? I notice you've gotten most of your strength back."</p>
<p>Buffy jumped off of Cordelia quickly realizing what the other girl was subtly getting at. "Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you bad? I completely forgot." Reaching down she gently placed her hand over Cordelia's healing wound.</p>
<p>"That's alright." Cordelia reassured, "It's still a little tender, that's all. Your knee hit it when you kneeled down."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled, "My affection isn't supposed to hurt, I'll have to practice on that one." She teased, stroking Cordelia's cheek lightly.</p>
<p>"Actually, I'm glad you hit my stomach." Cordelia said pushing Buffy down and onto her back. "It got you off of me, and now I can finally have a chance to be the aggressor."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned from ear to ear. "Ooh, really. Well, by all means...lead on."</p>
<p>Instead of being kissed like Buffy had expected, she watched as Cordelia slowly traced the curves of her body. Her breathing becoming more laboured, the Slayer began to squirm at the other girl's touch, her eyes closing at the delightful attention.</p>
<p>"You're so beautiful." Cordelia whispered near Buffy's ear, moving lower to kiss her throat and collarbone. Having run out of bare skin, Cordelia pulled back and rested a hand of the top buttons of Buffy's sweater. "May I?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Of course." Buffy said, slightly out of breath. Pushing herself up on her elbows, she watched Cordelia undo every button and then helped her rid of the sweater.</p>
<p>"The shirt too." Cordelia said quietly, her voice accented with arousal.</p>
<p>Buffy quickly complied, pulling the undershirt off. She wore no bra underneath. "Now you."</p>
<p>With Cordelia's jacket already off, she only had to unbutton the shirt she was wearing and unclasp her bra before Buffy could see the dark area on her midriff that would no doubt be bright red if she could see it in daylight.</p>
<p>Gently pushing Buffy back down on the blanket, Cordelia continued her exploration of the Slayer's body. Picking up where she left off Cordelia caressed Buffy's breasts, enjoying the various noises the blonde was making. Deciding to do one better than they had before, she tentatively lowered her mouth to a breast, alternately kissing and licking the sensitive area.</p>
<p>"Oh god, Cordy-" Buffy exhaled, her back arching to get even more contact with Cordelia's mouth. Satisfied that she had sufficiently lavished the slayer's breasts with attention, Cordelia moved down lower to tease the sensitive skin of her abdomen. Shivering in content, Buffy tried to remember the last time she felt this good. Not for a very long time...not since Angel. Suddenly wanting Cordelia up to where she was, Buffy reached down to grab the wandering hands. "Come back up here."</p>
<p>Cordelia immediately complied, coming up to lay beside Buffy. "I'm sorry, did I go too far? Are you okay?" she asked, concerned.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled, "No, and yes. I just missed you."</p>
<p>"Missed me?" Cordelia asked confused, "I was right over there." She said pointing to Buffy's stomach.</p>
<p>Buffy leaned over and kissed Cordelia softly. "I know, but I wanted you right here."</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled at Buffy affectionately. "Well, let me tell you...you've got me."</p>
<p>The smile on Buffy's face threatens to split it in two as she rolls on top of Cordelia to begin her fun. "My turn."</p>
<p>"Your turn, huh?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, and you're not getting your turn back until I'm done."</p>
<p>Cordelia nearly trembled as Buffy began her delicious assault.</p>
