<!-- The Reason \ Part 4 -->

<p>Buffy was freezing. Specifically the entire left side of her body. Oddly enough her right side was very warm...and breathing. Smiling at the memory of the night before, Buffy quickly opened her eyes, and then shut them even quicker. The sun was too much for her tired eyes. Damn that sun sure is bright this time of the morning. Buffy thought and then her eyes shot open again. What the hell time of morning IS this anyway?! We're late for school!</p>
<p>Turning as much as she could, Buffy took in the sight of Cordelia cuddled to her side. The brunette had managed to tangle herself in most of the blankets, which solved the mystery of her freezing left side. Being naked really doesn't help either. Buffy thought wryly. Brushing her hand down her lover's exposed arm, Buffy spoke softly, "Cordy...wake up."</p>
<p>Sleepy eyes opened slowly as Cordelia uttered a moan in response, "Hm?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled. "Good morning. I was just wondering if you happened to have the time on you...seeing how we have somewhere to be and all."</p>
<p>Cordelia looked at Buffy puzzled before realization dawned on her. "Oh god! We fell asleep! School...we're late for school!"</p>
<p>"Uh huh." Buffy confirmed, "It's time to book back to town warp speed."</p>
<p>"No kidding." Cordelia said, sitting up instantly on the lookout for clothing. "It's freezing this morning, how the hell did we sleep in this cold?" she asked, suddenly fixated on Buffy's nude body, barely covered by any blanket.</p>
<p>"Exhaustion?" Buffy offered, also sitting up. "Plus you wouldn't have felt the cold, you were pretty much bundled up. I on the other hand woke up because I was freezing."</p>
<p>Choosing not to rise to the bait, Cordelia apologized, "Sorry, I didn't realize I had most of the blankets."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned, "It's not like I even noticed last night anyway. The last thing I remember being is hot."</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled as she resumed the search for clothes. "Funny, I remember the same thing. It's too bad that we fell asleep though...so much for handing in my Bosnia paper this morning. Not that I really had it finished or anything."</p>
<p>"First period Social?"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I should have tried harder to stay awake. Being the slayer's supposed to help me, uh, recover faster." Buffy said, suddenly really interested in locating the missing clothing.</p>
<p>"But you aren't 100% in slayer form yet, probably." Cordelia reasoned, then slowly pulled a shirt from underneath the blankets. "Ewww, it's all dewy from the cold or something. How am I supposed to wear this?"</p>
<p>"The same way I'm supposed to wear my pants which somehow got thrown way the hell over there. You can get dressed first and then go and get them." Buffy decided.</p>
<p>Cordelia smirked, "What's wrong with you? Why can't you go and get them?"</p>
<p>Buffy took this opportunity to steal most of the blankets. "I'm not the one who managed to throw them that far."</p>
<p>"Okay fine," Cordelia grumbled, "Let's just locate my pants and then I'll do a mad dash."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned, "Agreed. I can't find your pants though, they must be under the blankets too. A quick search proved successful as Buffy produced a very wrinkled pair of lycra pants from somewhere in the blankets.</p>
<p>After giving them a disgusted look, Cordelia braved the cool morning air and stood up intending to pull the damp pants on but they proved to be quite the challenge, insisting on sticking together and refusing to slide against the surface of her skin.</p>
<p>Beaming from ear to ear, Buffy nearly choked trying not to laugh. "That's what I like most about us Cordy. No awkwardness the morning after."</p>
<p>"Oh shut up."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>A half-hour later the girls drove into Sunnydale, going about twice the legal speed limit. They had decided on a plan of action that would get them showered, changed, and to school the fastest. Cordelia wove the car through several residential blocks, finally stopping at her house. "Be right back." She said, racing up to her house. A couple of minutes later she was racing back, clean clothes clenched in one hand.</p>
<p>Shifting the car into gear, she sped off, Buffy bracing herself with the door as they took a corner particularly hard. She would have mentioned the danger of such a high speed if they weren't already so majorly late for school.</p>
<p>"Oh damn it!" Cordelia suddenly yelled, startling Buffy a little. "I forgot my book bag."</p>
<p>"You have books in your locker, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but none of the right ones. Oh well, it's too bad, I'm not going back for them."</p>
<p>"We both have Chem this afternoon, you can share with me. As for your other class..."</p>
<p>"Computers. Maybe I can get away without having the text. I hope so."</p>
<p>Pulling up in front of the Summers' home, both girls jumped out and tore into the house. "Who takes the shower first?" Buffy asked over her shoulder as she stomped up the stairs.</p>
<p>"You can," Cordelia answered right behind her, "Or we both can."</p>
<p>Buffy stopped at the top of the stairs to ponder that thought. "That might actually be faster. Let's do it."</p>
<p>Walking into the bathroom, Buffy turned on the water, testing the temperature as Cordelia undressed. "I still don't understand why I couldn't find my underwear this morning. We shook the blankets out and everything." Cordelia said, more than glad to ditch the increasingly uncomfortable lycra.</p>
<p>Buffy turned around and flashed her patent smirk. "Are you trying to blame me for that?</p>
<p>"Of course. Knowing you, you probably tossed them over the side of the cliff."</p>
<p>"Actually that's quite possible." Buffy said, grinning. Quickly stripping her soggy clothes off, she grabbed Cordelia's hand and stepped into the shower.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Twenty minutes later both girls were in Buffy's room making final touches on make-up, hair, and clothes.</p>
<p>Buffy glanced at her lover sitting in front of her mirror arranging her hair in something resembling a high ponytail. "I like when you put your hair up like that." She said catching the brunette's reflection in the mirror. "It's totally sexy."</p>
<p>Cordelia looked at Buffy's reflection and smiled broadly. "Well that's good to know."</p>
<p>Buffy finished packing her book bag and walked over to Cordelia, stooping down to place a kiss on the back of her neck. "Now I can kiss you right there."</p>
<p>Cordelia shivered at the delicate kiss, her eyes closing briefly before returning to the mirror to finish applying her lip-gloss. "Quit doing that or we'll never make it to school before lunch." She said with mock sternness. "It's bad enough we got carried away in the shower."</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm the one who stopped us, remember? Strike one for me." Buffy said defensively.</p>
<p>Cordelia stood up and gave the blonde a thorough kiss. "There, I did." Gathering her stuff, Cordelia left the room.</p>
<p>"Totally not what I meant, but who cares?" Buffy muttered to the empty room, quickly grabbing her book bag to follow her lover.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"11:57." Cordelia announced as she pulled into a stall in the school parking lot. "Perfect."</p>
<p>"Actually perfect would have been 8:27, but this is good too."</p>
<p>"Smartass." Cordelia muttered fondly. "I say we hit the cafeteria first. I'm starving."</p>
<p>"Sounds good."</p>
<p>The girls reached the cafeteria just as the bell rang for lunch. Pausing briefly to read the menu, they wound their way through the tables to the counter.</p>
<p>"Uh, if that's really meatloaf I'm gonna barf."</p>
<p>"No, the menu said it was stroganoff."</p>
<p>"It still looks barf-worthy."</p>
<p>"No kidding. I'm getting a sandwich and salad."</p>
<p>"That sounds safe. I think I'll indulge in the same."</p>
<p>Paying for their food, they turned to find a seat but stopped when they each went opposite ways. Cordelia looked at Buffy seriously, "Are we going to sit together or are we going to split up and sit with our own group of friends?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her tray and thought carefully. "Cordelia I just can't sit with Harmony and those other girls. I'll end up strangling them."</p>
<p>Cordelia burst out laughing, her tray almost falling to the floor. Buffy looked at her sharply and then smiled slightly. "I'm sorry, it's just the way you said that, being totally serious and all. You're so cute sometimes..."</p>
<p>Buffy flashed another patent smirk. "Sometimes? Yeah, well that ain't winning you any points Ms. Chase."</p>
<p>"I'll sit with you and the rest of the Scooby gang. How about that?"</p>
<p>"You're learning."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Xander, if you at least opened your Math text every once in a while you might not fail every single test." Willow explained to her friend as they walked into the cafeteria. "Even Buffy has learned the benefits of studying, even if I have to be there to explain it all to her afterwards. You should join us for a session sometime."</p>
<p>Xander didn't reply, he was too busy looking at Buffy and Cordelia sitting at their usual table eating lunch. Willow quickly noticed the same as they approached the table.</p>
<p>"Hey Buff, glad you could make it for class." Xander greeted the Slayer.</p>
<p>"Hey Buffy. Cordelia." Willow said, taking the seat next to Buffy.</p>
<p>"Hey Wil, glad to see you too Xander." Buffy said quietly. Cordelia nodded at Willow.</p>
<p>"Well gee Buff, you ditch class for what reason? I don't imagine vampires were running around town all morning." Xander took his lunch out of his bag but didn't touch it, staring Buffy down instead.</p>
<p>"And you became my mom when?"</p>
<p>"I'm not your mom, Buffy. I'm your friend and I worry about you, especially when you're out all night with her." Xander retorted, glancing at his ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Xander startled. How did he know? He called my house? Damn it, damn it...I don't want to have this conversation. "You called my house?" She asked, ignoring the Cordelia mention for now.</p>
<p>"Yes. Your mom didn't know where you were. Figured you were at Willow's house."</p>
<p>"So what, now she thinks I'm missing?"</p>
<p>"No, I covered for you. Said I had forgotten you were there."</p>
<p>"Where did you go Buffy?" Willow asked carefully. "I was kinda worried too. I thought you might have gotten into trouble with some vampires."</p>
<p>Buffy turned and looked at Cordelia before turning back to face Willow. Oh god, what is she going to say? Cordelia thought waiting for her lover to speak.</p>
<p>"I stayed at Angel's last night." Buffy eventually said. "I ran into trouble going home, he came to my rescue. I didn't feel like going home after that."</p>
<p>Cordelia visibly relaxed. Okay, that works.</p>
<p>"Buffy, Angel came into the Bronze about a half hour after you left looking for you." Willow said slowly.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Buffy looked away from the table exasperated. "What do you guys want from me? So I wasn't at home...I wasn't at Angel's either. I went out and for one night I got myself the hell out of Sunnydale." Looking directly as Xander she continued, "And yeah, Cordelia was with me. Is that okay? Is everyone fine now? Buffy had some off time. She decided to forsake the rules for sake of her birthday. Sorry if I lied...sorry that all my friends can't get along...sorry for being all screwed up." Standing up, she grabbed her book bag and stormed off towards the library.</p>
<p>Xander glared at his ex-girlfriend. "This is your influence, it's like you infect people or something."</p>
<p>Cordelia, who was still reeling from Buffy's frustrated outburst, shot Xander the look of death. "Oh yeah Xander, it's all me. Just what's so wrong about her hanging out with me anyway?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Buffy hanging out with you? Let's see...."</p>
<p>"Xander..." Willow warned quickly.</p>
<p>"No Willow, I want to say this."</p>
<p>"Xander, if anyone has a problem, it's you. It's none of your business where Buffy chooses to go and who she wants to hang out with."</p>
<p>"And just why does Buffy want to hang out with you anyway Cordelia? Bribing her with money? Need a personal bodyguard? I don't get it."</p>
<p>"You never get anything Xander Harris. Maybe Buffy and I just connect now, okay? It's just a little hard when someone can't seem to accept that."</p>
<p>Xander turned to Willow. "Do you accept it?"</p>
<p>"It was a little hard at first, but yeah, I accept it Xander. I think you should too. They're friends now." Willow said nodding her head once. "It's pretty bad when Buffy has to lie to us in order to hang out with Cordelia. She wouldn't have to do that if she knew you'd be able to handle it."</p>
<p>"I can play nice if you can Xander." Cordelia said seriously.</p>
<p>"The warped kind of nice we used to have? I guess I can try to deal."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Buffy walked into the library and flung her bag onto the nearest table. "Giles? You here?"</p>
<p>Walking out of his office, Giles noticed the anger practically radiating off of the Slayer. "Buffy, I'm glad to see you. Faith should be here right away."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Great. Is there anything going on?" Buffy climbed up onto the table and sat cross-legged waiting for Giles to give her any excuse to think about something, anything else.</p>
<p>"Ah, well you know that it's only been two days since...no, there's nothing new. It's not like you to ask, is everything alright?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine."</p>
<p>Knowing the dangers of pushing Buffy too far, Giles decided to leave it at that. Faith entered the library saving Giles from having to reply.</p>
<p>"Ready to rock, B?" Faith asked, tossing her bag on the counter.</p>
<p>Buffy pushed herself off the table and picked up her book bag. "Give me a minute, I have to change."</p>
<p>"Sure, I'll set up. Giles?" Faith and Giles went into the weapon cage to pull out the floor mats and various weapons. Buffy went into Giles' office to change.</p>
<p>After the mats were set in place, Giles took the much used 'Library Closed' sign and placed it outside the doors to the library. Buffy walked out of Giles' office and immediately started warming up with Faith. They started out slow and easy, using this as an alternative to stretching out. Little by little they upped the tempo, soon becoming full out hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>"Wow, B you sure have the fire in ya today. What's up?" Faith asked, her breathing a little ragged.</p>
<p>Blocking Faith's backhand, Buffy moved back a little, "Nothing, just the usual life sucks routine."</p>
<p>Connecting with a shoulder hit, Faith narrowed her eyes. "It's not like you to gripe, something really must be digging at you. You got problems with Deadboy again?"</p>
<p>Buffy connected a solid blow to Faith's stomach, "Don't call him that. And no, it's not Angel."</p>
<p>Faith smirked at Buffy from where she was sprawled on the mat. "Really? Because I could have sworn it was about him...you have that look in your eyes B. The look that tells everyone you're super possessive about something."</p>
<p>"Gee Faith, you read me like a book." Buffy said sarcastically. "Maybe I'm just in a really bad mood."</p>
<p>Faith stood up and took her time getting back into fighting stance. "Nah, it's not your style. The only time you get down and show your anger is when you have demon problems to solve. Even then you're solid. This is something personal."</p>
<p>"And totally none of your business."</p>
<p>"Awww...you're not gonna give? Got some new honey you're stylin'? I heard you didn't go home last night." Faith taunted.</p>
<p>Buffy's face clouded over as she stepped closer to Faith. "I'm glad everyone's on the same page now, I wouldn't want someone to be left out on the details of my life. Now let's fight."</p>
<p>Throwing a punch over Faith's head, Buffy felt the anger burn inside of her. What the hell is wrong with everyone? Am I that predictable? Something new comes along and it's horribly wrong for me to take part? Buffy hit the floor hard as Faith tripped her easily.</p>
<p>"I'm fighting, where are you?" Faith teased. "I really got to you, didn't I?"</p>
<p>Glancing around the room, Buffy noted with relief that Giles had retreated from the library. "Don't flatter yourself, it's not just you." Picking herself up off the floor, Buffy looked at the other slayer thoughtfully. "Can I trust you to keep a secret?"</p>
<p>Faith grinned at Buffy, "Finally gonna spill, eh?"</p>
<p>"Shut up."</p>
