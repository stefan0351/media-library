<!-- The Reason \ Prologue -->

<p>Buffy looked down the hallway as she walked to class and felt the familiar pain return to her chest. Cordelia was at her locker. Maybe she'll look at me today. Buffy thought hopefully. And maybe if she looks at me, she wont glare like the last fifty times.</p>
<p>Gone was the budding romance between them. Originally slowed down a touch for fear of being caught by their friends, it hit a dead end when everyone found out about Angel. Cordelia didn't trust her anymore, it was that simple. Buffy had taken her blows like she always had, but deep down she just couldn't let that one go. The last time they had been alone together Buffy couldn't quite remember...but she missed it. Face it Buff, when we're all in the group she sometimes talks to you, but it's never personal. And later if you ever try to talk to her, she pulls away and makes up excuses. She hates you now. Buffy resolved to herself as she passed by Cordelia's locker.</p>
<p>Cordelia looked straight at her, her face hard, but no glare.</p>

<p>Cordelia caught sight of Buffy walking down the hall immediately. Then again she could probably spot her in a crowd of a million. Her heart beat skipped a beat as she realized Buffy was going to walk right by her, but she quickly tried to ignore her as she came nearer. Don't look at Buffy and give her the satisfaction of knowing you still have feelings for her. Her mind screamed at her. Looking at Buffy was like a drug to Cordelia though, ever since they had discovered an attraction to each other. Cordelia felt a jolt of desire flow through her every time she looked at her.</p>
<p>Damn it, don't look at her. She's nothing to you now. It's over. She lied about Angel and you can't forgive that. She hurts everyone over and over again. She reasoned with herself. Attempting to follow the conversation going on around her, Cordelia pretended to occupy herself by nodding and smiling at all the appropriate times, but her resistance couldn't hold out. As Buffy passed by her, Cordelia looked at her full in the face.</p>
<p>Damn it Cordelia. She muttered to herself as she turned towards her locker and collected her books for class.</p>
