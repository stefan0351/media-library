<!-- After Homecoming \ Part 3 -->

<p>Monday morning came around
fast. Buffy rushed around her room getting books and other essentials together.</p>

<p>"Mom, can you give me a ride
to school?" Buffy yelled down the hallway.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm leaving right
away. Get a move on." Came the reply from downstairs.</p>

<p>"Okay. Be right there." Buffy
yelled back, checking herself in the mirror for what seemed like the hundredth
time. Looking good seemed to be important today, and although she didn't
want to admit it, Buffy knew why.</p>

<p>"Two kisses and you're turned
inside out." Buffy mumbled to herself as she hurried downstairs and outside
to the car.</p>

<p>"You seem to be in a good mood
today." Joyce commented on the drive to school.</p>

<p>"Hm, I guess so. You know me,can't
wait to learn stuff at school." Buffy said, staring out the window.</p>

<p>Joyce smirked affectionately
at her daughter, "Uh huh, that's what I'm hoping."</p>

<p>As they pulled up to the school
Buffy quickly said her goodbye and rushed into the building. "Two minutes
to get to English. Yay mom, running that red light paid off." As she walked
into the classroom, the bell rang starting another long, boring day of
high school.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"You guys shouldn't be complaining
about school." Willow lectured Xander, Oz, and Buffy in the cafeteria during
lunch. "We only have a little while left at this place, and then we're
on our own. That's scary."</p>

<p>Oz put a hand on Willow's arm.
"Don't worry, I'll protect you."</p>

<p>Willow tried to glare at Oz,
but it came out a smile. "That's sweet, but I'm serious. We're taking this,"
Willow gestured around her, "for granted! Next year we'll wish we were
back here,.hanging out together."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her friend.
"No worries Will, we'll still keep in touch, wherever we end up. I don't
know where I'm ending up, but I'm sure I'll be able to keep up the correspondence."</p>

<p>Xander nodded his agreement,
"Like Buff says, we'll stay in touch. You guys off to college somewhere,
and me still here in good ol'Sunnydale working at some fast food place
or something."</p>

<p>Willow punched Xander in the
arm. "Stop saying that. You'll find something good. Maybe community college,
or maybe your dad can get you on where he works."</p>

<p>Xander smirked at his best
friend, and leaned back in his chair. "Nah, I think I'll stay right here.
Work in the caf&eacute; or something. Hey, I could even be the janitor.
Wouldn't Principal Snyder just love that."</p>

<p>"What would Principal Snyder
love?" Cordelia asked as she walked up to the table. Glancing around she
nodded at the group in greeting, noting the way Buffy had lit up slightly
as she had walked up. She was sure her face had done the same thing.</p>

<p>Xander wrapped an arm around
Cordelia's waist. "Hey there Cordy, I was just explaining how I may end
up tormenting Snyder for the rest of his career here at Sunnydale High
by working here after high school."</p>

<p>Cordelia wrinkled her nose
up at the thought. "Aren't you going to try for something more,ambitious?"</p>

<p>Xander moved in closer and
mock whispered in her ear, "What do you have in mind, baby?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like you're thinking."
Cordelia replied, squirming away from him.</p>

<p>Changing the subject, Oz spoke
up, "Are we doing anything tonight? The band is kinda practicing at the
Bronze tonight, so if you guys want to come,."</p>

<p>"Yeah, we should all Bronze
it tonight!" Willow said excitedly, "I mean if we haven't all overdosed
on partying from Friday."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded in agreement.
"I say let's Bronze it, but skip the party aspect. It's only Monday, I
need to conserve my energy to make it through the rest of the week."</p>

<p>"I'm in." Xander said. "Cordy?"</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded, "Sure. Beats
the hell out of homework."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>That night Willow, Xander,
and Cordelia sat in their usual place at the Bronze; out of the major traffic
area, but still close to the stage where Oz was now performing with the
band. For a Monday the place was jumping, as it seemed not every senior
was partied out.</p>

<p>"You know, it's a little boring
just sitting here not talking. Where's your girls'sense of fun?" Xander
asked, bouncing in his seat a little.</p>

<p>Willow tore her gaze from the
stage and gave Xander a frown. "You know we always wait for Buffy to finish
her patrol before we all go up and dance."</p>

<p>"Well, you do know that it
IS possible to have fun without the help of Buffy,.ouch!" Xander pulled
his arm against his chest, pouting at Cordelia. "What was that for?"</p>

<p>Cordelia gave him a look. "You
know what she meant. We wait so we can include her into the fun,whatever
it is. Even I know that."</p>

<p>"Gee, when did you start sticking
up for Buffy? Normally it would be you agreeing with me." Xander grumbled
to his girlfriend.</p>

<p>Cordelia sighed. "Yeah well,
maybe I've matured. Besides I have nothing against Buffy." That remark
got stares from both Xander and Willow. "What?! I don't. Homecoming was
just a small misunderstanding." Her friends continued to stare in disbelief.</p>

<p>"What's the looks for guys?"
Buffy asked as she took a seat next to Willow.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy," Willow greeted,
"Nothing. Just talking."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Xander cut in, "Talking
about how you and Cordy seem to have resolved your differences since last
week."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "We have." She
said simply.</p>

<p>"See? I told you." Cordelia
said, crossing her arms.</p>

<p>"Well,.I guess that's good
then." Xander said slowly.</p>

<p>"Yep." Buffy agreed, while
Cordelia said nothing.</p>

<p>"So," Xander started, ready
to change the subject, "Who's gonna get down with their bad selves on the
dance floor with me?" Everyone looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Sure," Buffy said, "I didn't
even get a workout on patrol tonight, I'm good for some calorie burning."</p>

<p>"Me too." Cordelia offered.</p>

<p>Willow was already up, and
she and Xander led the way onto the crowded dance floor. Pressed together,
the gang fought for a small circle of space to move. Cordelia and Xander
were hip to hip, as were Buffy and Willow. As the crowd shifted when the
beat became faster, so did they. Xander was working his dance moves around
Willow, while Buffy found herself face to face with Cordelia in the remaining
space.</p>

<p>Figuring Buffy didn't want
her quite so close, Cordelia stepped back to give more room, but was instead
pushed forward into Buffy by the couple behind her.</p>

<p>Grabbing Cordelia in a hug-like
embrace, Buffy stepped back to prevent the two of them from falling. Cordelia
slowly straightened up, losing the tight embrace in the process, but did
not take her arms from around Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>"Thanks." She smiled, slightly
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"No problem." Buffy said, her
hands still resting on Cordy's hips.</p>

<p>Realizing that they weren't
moving any longer, they broke contact from each other and started to dance
once again, though this time neither of them bothered to keep much distance
from each other.</p>

<p>What is the matter with me?
Buffy thought. Here I am dancing with Cordelia, and wanting to get even
closer than we are. If we weren't in public I'd be tempted to kiss her
again. Again! What the hell brought this on, anyway?</p>

<p>Cordelia was having similar
thoughts as they continued to move to the music. Eventually though, the
crowd shifted again so that Xander and Willow were once again with them.</p>

<p>The group danced until the
band begged off for the night, then gathered by the door to decide travel
arrangements for getting home. There was a time once where they wouldn't
have thought twice about walking home, but in the past year they became
used to the fact that it was simply too dangerous to walk outside after
dark,.even in small groups. Oz and Cordelia were the only two with vehicles,
so it was only a matter of deciding who went with who. Usually Buffy avoided
using Cordelia as a ride, which is why it surprised Willow and Xander,
and even Cordelia when she suggested Oz and Willow take off without her.</p>

<p>"You'll go in Cordelia's car?"
Willow asked, making sure she heard right.</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged, "Yeah, I realized
my house is actually closer to hers than to yours. The weird things you
find out sometimes,"</p>

<p>Willow had known this all along,
but she always figured that Buffy just rather go with them then be awkward
during a ride home with Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Alright. We'll see you guys
tomorrow then." Willow gave Buffy a hug goodnight, and waved to Xander
and Cordelia as she and Oz left the Bronze.</p>

<p>"Well ladies, shall we go?"
Xander said, linking his arms with Buffy and Cordy.</p>

<p>"Ooh, what a gentleman." Buffy
joked, as they headed outside to Cordelia's car.</p>

<p>"Who am I dropping off first?"
Cordelia asked as she unlocked the doors. She knew Xander would be the
logical choice since he lived only 5 blocks from the Bronze, but also knew
he may want to be the last one dropped off in hopes of getting in a little
groping action.</p>

<p>Buffy remained silent so Xander
spoke up, "Me I guess. I'm closer. Plus it'll be faster for the two of
you."</p>

<p>Satisfied, Cordelia nodded
then started driving.</p>

<p>As they arrived at Xander's
place, Xander leaned over and kissed Cordelia goodnight, then opened the
door, pausing to wait for Buffy to make the change from the back seat to
the front seat. Closing the door for her, Xander gave a cheery wave before
heading up the walk to his house.</p>

<p>The girls sat in silence while
they waited for Xander to be safely in the front door. When he was in,
they continued on their way, as uneasy tension developing as neither girl
could find the courage to speak their mind.</p>

<p>Finally, as they pulled up
in front of Buffy's house, Cordelia spoke.</p>

<p>"I'd ask if you're mad at me,
but then I don't really think you are."</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Cordelia in
surprise, "I'm not mad at you."</p>

<p>Cordelia was silent for a moment.
"Why did you volunteer to come with me tonight?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked away, "I'm sorry,
did you not want me to go with you tonight? I,.I guess I could have gone
with,."</p>

<p>"No, that's not what I mean."
C ordelia interrupted. "I just meant,I don't know."</p>

<p>" I don't know either." Buffy
said quietly. "I don't know what's going on, and I don't understand what
I may be feeling."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean,." Cordelia
said seriously. "We were just experimenting the other night,and well that
other time too."</p>

<p>Buffy froze at Cordelia's words,
the realization that her friend didn't feel the same way she did hitting
her like a punch in the stomach.</p>

<p>"Yes, that we were." Buffy
nearly whispered, as she turned to look out the side window, desperately
wishing she had gone with Willow and Oz tonight.</p>

<p>"Well okay, then let me tell
you something, even if you don't feel the same way. God, I don't even know
why things get this complicated."</p>

<p>Buffy closed her eyes for a
moment, then turned to face Cordelia again.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you felt
when we kissed, or even what you felt tonight on the dance floor," Cordelia
paused, "But I think I'm attracted to you. I don't know why I am, hell
I have a boyfriend, but after we kissed,.let's just say I've been thinking
about it a lot."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't help the grin
spreading across her face. "You don't have to worry about me not feeling
the same, Cordy. Do you know how hard it was for me to let go of you at
the Bronze tonight? It took one kiss and now, suddenly, I'm attracted to
you in the worst way." Buffy let out a little laugh, "Who would have thought?"</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled, "Certainly
not me. Then again I did end up with Xander as a boyfriend, so my instincts
may be out of whack." She teased.</p>

<p>"Hey! That sounds like an insult.
You know I can just," Buffy was cut off as Cordelia leaned over to kiss
her, effectively shutting her up. Reaching up, Buffy slid her fingers into
Cordelia's hair as Cordelia wrapped her arms around her, pulling her closer.</p>

<p>Several minutes later, both
girls pulled back breathless. Licking her bottom lip, Cordelia grinned,
"Sorry, I couldn't resist."</p>

<p>"No problem here." Buffy said,
taking a deep breath to calm herself. "It's too bad that it's after 10
though," she said, glancing at the clock on the radio. "I have to go in
before mom figures I've been killed by vamps or something."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia sighed, "Well
I'll see you tomorrow at school then,"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded once. "Definitely."
Leaning over, Buffy placed a quick kiss on Cordy's lips before opening
the door. "Goodnight."</p>

<p>"Goodnight Buffy." Cordelia
smiled as she watched Buffy go into her house. Driving away, Cordelia couldn't
wait for the next day to begin.</p>
