<!-- After Homecoming \ Part 2 -->

<p>Somewhere close by, a high
pitched screeching sounded off. Slowly Cordelia opened her eyes and winced
when she discovered the sunlight flooding the room. The offending sound
exploded once again, right next to the bed. Grabbing the side of her head
with one hand, the other shot out to grab the phone off of the nightstand.
Swallowing, she attempted to find her voice before putting the receiver
to her ear.</p>

<p>"Hello?" she managed to croak
out.</p>

<p>"Cordy?" Xander's voice boomed
in her ear. "Are you alright? Where did you go last night? You and Buffy
just disappeared from the Bronze. Her mom said she was with you, right?"
He rambled quickly.</p>

<p>Cordelia closed her eyes and
tried to concentrate on the previous night. The prom party at the Bronze,.leaving
with Buffy,.coming home,.drinking,..the kiss,.passing out. Opening her
eyes, Cordelia turned to look at Buffy, still sleeping beside her.</p>

<p>"Cordy? Still there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I'm alright. Buffy's
here with me, still sleeping. We left the Bronze when they announced Homecoming
Queen, I guess you guys just didn't notice. We didn't really feel like
hanging around there, y'know?"</p>

<p>"So what did you two end up
doing?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"We just came to my place and
watched some movies,.nothing too exciting." Cordelia said nonchalantly,
the kiss playing over in her mind. Xander wouldn't find out about that
though.</p>

<p>"That's cool. You two girls
seem to have put your differences behind you, huh?"</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled at that. "I
guess we have." Changing the subject, she asked, "How did the rest of the
night go for you guys at the Bronze?"</p>

<p>Xander paused. "It was,fine.
Just took it easy I guess. Giles seemed to have had a good time, although
after you two showed up, he looked a little out of it."</p>

<p>"Interesting." Cordelia's head
was pounding, and she desperately wanted to end the conversation so it'd
be quiet again. "Well, how about I phone you later or something. I think
I'm gonna try and go back to sleep."</p>

<p>"It's 2 in the afternoon. You're
tired? I thought you didn't sleep in,.even on weekends."</p>

<p>"Oh, well,we didn't get to
bed until late, and well I guess I'm not feeling that great." Ain't that
the truth. Cordelia thought.</p>

<p>"Well alright." Xander said
slowly. "Call me when you feel like it. I gotta do some stuff with my dad
later on, so it's no big deal. I'll talk to you later, k?"</p>

<p>"Yep, sure. Later. Bye."</p>

<p>"Bye."</p>

<p>Cordelia hung up the phone
and buried her head under a pillow. She waited for sleep to claim her again,
and slowly she felt herself drifting off. Just as she was in a painless
state, she heard a mumbled groan, and suddenly an arm hit her in the stomach.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Cordelia groaned.</p>

<p>"Huh? What,sorry Cordy." Buffy
mumbled, eyes half opened. "Oh god, I think I'm gonna be sick. And my head,."</p>

<p>Cordelia held a hand over her
stomach. "You're gonna be sick? You're the one who just punched me in the
gut. Ugh,"</p>

<p>Buffy slowly rolled off the
bed. Looking at the clock, she moaned loudly. "Damn, it's 2:30. I gotta
book home. Mom's probably wondering what the hell I'm still doing here.
Usually I'm home on Saturdays."</p>

<p>Cordelia pushed herself into
a sitting position,.and closed her eyes for a few moments before speaking.
"I'll drive you home. Just let me pop a few asprin and get dressed."</p>

<p>Buffy picked up her destroyed
dress off the floor. "That's okay Cordy. I can walk."</p>

<p>"If you're hurting half as
much as me, you wont even make it home walking. It's no problem, really."</p>

<p>Buffy looked over at her friend,
"Alright, thanks."</p>

<p>The two girls changed as quick
as could be expected with intense hangovers. Grabbing the bottle of asprin,
they were on their way to Buffy's.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Squinting in the seemingly
unnaturally bright sunshine, Cordelia pulled up in front of Buffy's house.
Her sunglasses didn't seem to be doing their job today. She turned to look
at Buffy, who was still holding a hand over her eyes to block the offending
light.</p>

<p>"We're here."</p>

<p>Buffy took her hand away from
her eyes and moaned. "Alright, just let me find my major motor skills and
I'll be on my way." Turning to Cordelia she rested her head back against
the seat. "Thanks for having me over last night."</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled. "No problem,
I enjoyed the company."</p>

<p>There was silence for a long
moment before Buffy finally spoke up. "See you at school Monday?"</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded, "Monday."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded also, "Alright
then, I guess I better go then," she looked over at Cordelia again and
tilted her head in thought.</p>

<p>"You're thinking about it,
aren't you." Cordelia said, not asking but merely stating a fact.</p>

<p>Buffy paused in shock, then
smiled slightly. "Yes I was. And you are too." Leaning over, Buffy reached
up and touched Cordelia's face. Meeting her halfway, Cordelia inched closer
until their lips met in a gentle kiss.</p>

<p>Pulling back, Buffy grinned.
"I'll see you Monday."</p>

<p>"Bye." Cordelia called softly
as Buffy left the car. Pulling away from the curb, she had to force herself
to concentrate on the road the entire way home.</p>
