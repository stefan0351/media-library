<!-- The Reason \ Part 2 -->

<p>Cordelia awoke to the sound of the nurse setting a food tray in front of her. Slowly she tried to shift into a higher position, but the screaming pain in her abdomen quickly halted her efforts.</p>
<p>"I'll give you another shot for the pain." The nurse said, leaving the room.</p>
<p>Cordelia simply laid still, her ragged breathing in time with her spasms of pain. Finally, in what seemed to be an eternity, the nurse returned to give her a shot of painkillers. Making sure Cordelia was as comfortable as she could get, the nurse left her to eat.</p>
<p>Picking up the fork, she pushed the food around the plastic plate, her appetite still vacant after three days. Tired of playing with the food, she pushed the table away suddenly irritated. Her family aside, nobody else had visited her since the accident besides Xander...and Buffy. She didn't consider those actual visits because she hadn't wanted to speak to Xander, and well Buffy...she had only stood at the door and whispered a 'get well'.</p>
<p>I guess she only came to see if I was still alive. Cordelia thought sadly. She saw me crying and she bailed. Not that I would have talked to her anyway.</p>
<p>As much as she hated to admit it, Cordelia was thrilled that Buffy had cared as much as to show up at her door, even if it was only for a minute. She hadn't been sure it had even been Buffy at first, but she had heard her whisper, and then she had known.</p>
<p>Smiling at the memory, Cordelia looked over at the empty doorway. She wished Buffy had never betrayed her...and she wished Xander had never cheated on her. Oh well, that's all over now. It's time to move on and leave the insanity that is Xander Harris and Buffy Summers and get a life! At least when I was friends with Harmony and those other bitches, they never hurt me...well until I left the fold. Sighing, she knew why they had never hurt her; she never ever had emotional attachment to them like she did Xander and Buffy, and even Willow, Oz, and Giles. Their betrayal burned her far deeper than anything Harmony could do to her.</p>
<p>Maybe Harmony and the others will take me back in the group. Then maybe I can start forgetting those who hurt me.</p>
<p>Sick of thinking about her social life, Cordelia closed her eyes and tried to think of other things. Nothing else came to mind, but it mattered little as Cordelia fell asleep within minutes.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The next day Cordelia was allowed to go home to recover. Still in a great deal of pain, she resigned to bed rest for most of the remaining week. Painkillers and iced tea was her meal of choice, though she did manage to choke down some food every once in a while at her mother's request.</p>
<p>Deciding she would recover faster if she stopped dwelling in the past, Cordelia started focusing on what she would do Monday when she went back to school. On Sunday afternoon Cordelia felt well enough to escape to the mall for a brief spree, and since reinstating her old attitude, she felt a new killer outfit would be in order.</p>
<p>Once at the mall, Cordelia saw many of her classmates from school as she wandered from store to store. By the way they looked at her, she realized they must have found out what had happened between her and Xander. She tried to ignore the stares and snickering, but it only fueled her perpetual bad mood further. What the hell do they know? She thought as she left the mall, purchases in hand. I was once the most popular girl at Sunnydale High...I can make it happen again.</p>
<p>At home Cordelia carefully laid out her new outfit and sat down on her bed to rest. Looking over at her bookcase, she caught sight of a picture taken the month before with Xander, Buffy, and Willow. It ws the picture that Buffy had promised they would have taken...a group picture with Cordelia included. Walking over to her bookcase, she took the picture out of it's frame and brought it back to the bed, studying it carefully. Looking around her room, Cordelia reached over for her bed tray and bowl placing them in front of her. Placing the picture on the tray, she got up once more to find scissors and matches. Returning to her bed, she picked up the picture once more and gave it a final glance. The end. Cordelia thought bitterly as she cut the picture and burned it.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>On Monday, about the only way Cordelia's day at school could have been worse, is if she had shown up naked. That bitch Harmony had humiliated her in front of everyone, including the new girl Anya. Anya hadn't seemed phased though, as she sought her out later on at school. Of course the humiliation didn't end with Harmony...her image was trashed thoroughly by John Lee who basically told her what the rest of her dating prospects are thinking...she's Xander's castoff, and since he was a loser, she's now a bigger loser. His offer of seeing her someplace secluded for some action had pissed her off almost more than Harmony's prank. She wasn't some second place whore who went around making out with everyone, she had always made sure her reputation was always in good standing. Now she was the laughingstock of the school and it was all because of Xander and Willow.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>That night Cordelia had plans to meet up with Anya at the Bronze. The two girls had guys surrounding them almost immediately after they sat down at a table. Apparently they didn't care about Cordelia's reputation as she and Anya kept them all busy in conversation, lightly flirting to keep the interest. Every so often she would turn and glance at Xander, making sure he was paying attention to her efforts of mak ing him jealous. From what she saw, she was doing a good job. Smiling, Cordelia excused herself from the table, begging off for the night. Her side was bothering her a lot, she was due to take another dose of painkillers, not to mention she needed to use her technique of leaving the guys hanging. Always leave 'em wanting more. Cordelia thought as she made her way outside to the alley.</p>
<p>She had gone not more than 20 steps when she heard Buffy shout her name from behind her.</p>
<p>"Hey Cordelia, wait a second." Buffy called out.</p>
<p>Cordelia turned around surprised. "Did Xander send you to beg for him?" she snapped. "Because if he did..."</p>
<p>"No I'm a free agent, I promise." Buffy said. "I just wanted to see how you are."</p>
<p>Never been better." Cordelia answered, turning away. Buffy rushed to follow her.</p>
<p>"Cordelia, I know what it's like to be hurt by someone. Hurt so much that you don't think you're gonna make it. But I told my friends how I felt, and you know what? It got a little better." Buffy pleaded.</p>
<p>Cordelia stared at Buffy, wanting desperately to talk to her at that moment. She began to respond when suddenly a vampire jumped down and attacked them. Buffy immediately started fighting, leaving Cordelia to stand there watching. Of course she wasn't paying attention to how close she was to the action and before long she was knocked into the garbage pile. Pain assaulted her senses as she felt her healing wound tear open at the force. Ouch! Son of a bitch that hurts! Her mind screamed as she simply sat there waiting for Buffy to finish with the vampire.</p>
<p>When it was staked, she carefully climbed out of the pile, picking odd pieces of trash off of her dress. Before she could pray that nobody would see her with garbage on her, Harmony and gang walked by on cue and laughed at her once again. Furious, Cordelia looked at Buffy and all that she had wanted to say to her before disappeared from her mind.</p>
<p>"You know what I've been asking myself a lot this past week? Why me? Why do I get impaled? Why do I get bitten by snakes? Why do I fall for incredible losers? And you know, I think I've finally figured it out. What my problem is, it's you." Cordelia vented angrily.</p>
<p>Buffy froze in shock, Cordelia's words cutting through her like a knife. She wanted to challenge with reason and tell Cordelia that she was out of line, but she knew that Cordelia deserved to vent to someone.</p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt you Cordelia." Buffy choked. "I keep trying to explain that to you, but you won't listen." Buffy turned and walked back to the Bronze, tears threatening to fall.</p>
<p>Cordelia watched Buffy re-enter the Bronze, then turned towards her car. Closing her eyes, she cursed softly.</p>
