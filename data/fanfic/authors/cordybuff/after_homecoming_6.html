<!-- After Homecoming \ Part 6 -->

<p>Cordelia was
having the most wonderful dream. She was being caressed all over by strong
hands and it was nearly driving her crazy. The person attached to those
hands was slowly moving up her body, and just as they were coming into
sight, she woke up.</p>

<p>Laying there
for a minute, Cordelia cursed softly. She had thought it would be Xander
in her dream, but those hands were soft and smaller.</p>

<p>"Buffy." Cordelia
whispered through a smile. The previous evening came rushing back to her,
every detail vivid in her mind. She wished Buffy had stayed the night,
because then they could have continued... and Buffy would be lying next
to her right now. God, she really wanted Buffy to be there.</p>

<p>Realizing her
wish wasn't going to come true, she sighed and got out of bed. Remembering
that she was supposed to do something with Xander today, Cordelia headed
off towards the shower. Perhaps she could convince him that hanging out
with the gang this evening be the best thing to do. I'll phone him after
my shower. She decided.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>The ringing of
the phone startled Buffy out of the trance her English text had put her
in. Reaching over her books and notes, she grabbed the phone on the third
ring.</p>

<p>"Hello?"</p>

<p>"Hey Buff, it's
Xander."</p>

<p>"Hey Xander.
How's it going?" Buffy asked her friend.</p>

<p>"It's going good.
I've missed seeing you around though. Busy with the slaying gig, I take
it." Xander asked.</p>

<p>"You know it.
So what's up?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've talked
to Cordelia and Willow, and it's been decided that we're going out for
some food and standard Bronzing tonight. You wanna partake with us?"</p>

<p>Buffy's pulse
jumped at the mention of Cordelia. If she was going then of course she
couldn't refuse. "Sure, that sounds like fun. How about I do my usual sweep
early and be done by seven. Is that okay?"</p>

<p>"Seven is fine.
We'll meet at the place down the block from the Bronze, alright?"</p>

<p>"Sounds good.
I'll talk to you then."</p>

<p>"Okay, later."</p>

<p>"Bye." Buffy
hung up the phone and smiled. She wouldn't have to wait until Monday to
see Cordelia after all.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>The bells on
the door chimed as Buffy opened the door to the small diner. Almost instantly
she spotted Xander, Willow, and Cordelia seated in a booth at the very
back. Weaving her way around the crowded tables, she arrived at their table
and slid into the empty seat next to Willow.</p>

<p>"Hey guys." She
greeted the group. "Where's Oz tonight? Isn't he joining us?"</p>

<p>"Oz is setting
up with the band. They're playing at the Bronze tonight" Willow said, glancing
at Xander before giving Buffy a big smile.</p>

<p>"Cool." Buffy
said simply.</p>

<p>"Yes," Xander
agreed suddenly, "It's cool. Oz is cool. A really great guy that Oz is."</p>

<p>Buffy gave Xander
a strange look. "Glad you think so Xander." Changing the subject, Buffy
turned and smiled across the table at Cordelia. "How you doing there, Cordelia?"</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled
in return, glad Buffy had given her attention in front of the gang. "I'm
good. You?" she asked formally.</p>

<p>"I'm doing good.
Actually been in a really good mood since yesterday." Buffy replied innocently.</p>

<p>Cordelia's smile
widened a bit. "Really? Well that's great."</p>

<p>"Good moods are
always great. Especially when we live in Sunnydale. Sometimes they are
few and far between." Xander threw in as the waitress came to take their
orders.</p>

<p>After dinner,
they walked down the street to the Bronze where they met up with Oz, who
had just finished setting up for gig with the rest of the band. Finding
their usual spot taken already, the group found a table closer to the front
away from the main people traffic. Oz drifted back towards the stage as
the band began to play and the dance floor filled up with people.</p>

<p>Xander stood
up suddenly. "Who's gonna dance with me?" he asked the girls.</p>

<p>"I'll dance."
Willow said, standing up also. "Buffy? Cordelia? You guys gonna come?"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her
head. "Not this time, Will. I'm gonna stay here and make sure no one takes
the table."</p>

<p>"I'm staying
too. I'm don't feel like dancing quite yet." Cordelia said, staring at
the dance floor.</p>

<p>"Alright, have
it your way. Willow and I are gonna make our own fun...like two platonic
friends do." Xander replied, taking Willow's hand and dragging her into
the dance crowd.</p>

<p>Taking Xander's
empty seat, Buffy moved to sit next to Cordelia. "Hey there." She said,
leaning into her slightly.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself."
Cordelia replied, unable to think about much else than the way Buffy's
hair smelled it was so close to her.</p>

<p>"I don't want
to be a spoil sport or anything... .especially since I haven't been around
most of the week, but I really want to go home now." Buffy said straight
out.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked
puzzled. "We just got here though. Don't you want to hang out for a while?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I want
to hang out... ..with you." Buffy moved even closer to Cordelia, close
enough to whisper in her ear. "I really want to continue what we started
last night." She murmured into her ear.</p>

<p>Swallowing, Cordelia
thought for a moment. "We can't do that here. Or at my place. My parents
are home."</p>

<p>"My mom is working
late tonight. A new shipment for the gallery has to be put up. She'll be
there until the early morning hours." Buffy smiled seductively.</p>

<p>"That sounds
great." Cordelia agreed. "But we still have the small problem of being
stuck here."</p>

<p>"I don't know,"
Buffy said, "Suddenly I'm not feeling so great."</p>

<p>"Hm, that's too
bad," Cordelia said, catching on, "It looks like I'm the one who'll have
to take you home."</p>

<p>"It looks that
way." Buffy agreed. "Let's go tell Xander and Willow."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Is it just me,
or did Xander and Willow look a little pre-occupied? Cordelia asked when
they were in the car.</p>

<p>"You mean the
way they both stopped dancing and looked at us like deer caught in headlights
when we approached them?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded,
"Exactly. What's up with them anyway? They've been acting strange for the
past week now."</p>

<p>"Stress? I don't
know. It's probably nothing." Buffy suggested.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're
probably right." Cordelia agreed. "I'm surprised they let us go that easily
though."</p>

<p>"Lucky us." Buffy
said simply.</p>

<p>"Yup." Cordelia
smiled.</p>

<p>They pulled up
to Buffy's house and got out of the car. "I don't think you've ever been
in my house under normal circumstances, have you?" Buffy asked, leading
the way up the front walk.</p>

<p>"Well there are
a couple of times that seem to stand out. Let's see, one time Xander and
I were looking for you, and encountered the bug man instead. Another time
we went to your house for refuge because Xander and Amy had put a spell
on all the girls." Buffy groaned at that. "And then the zombie party a
while back for your return home."</p>

<p>"So that's a
no then." Buffy laughed.</p>

<p>"Definitely."
Cordelia agreed. "I've probably spent more time in your basement that you
have."</p>

<p>Unlocking the
door, Buffy let them in. "So what do you wanna do?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked
at Buffy and slowly shrugged her shoulders, a smile spreading across her
face. "Oh, I don't know... we could try the TV thing again."</p>

<p>Buffy stepped
closer to Cordelia and rested her hands on the girl's hips. "We could do
that," Buffy said drawled seductively, "Or we could just skip that altogether."</p>

<p>Cordelia raised
an eyebrow, and slowly lifted Buffy's hands off of her hips, their fingers
entwining. "I vote for the after part." She whispered softly, pulling Buffy
closer, their lips meeting in a soft kiss.</p>

<p>After a moment
Buffy pulled back, smiling slightly at Cordelia's moan of protest. "We're
not starting this in front of the door. I don't want my mom tripping over
us if she comes home early. Let's go upstairs to my room."</p>

<p>Taking Cordelia's
hand, Buffy led the way upstairs. Shutting the bedroom door behind them,
Buffy went over to the window and dropped the blinds down, making sure
the window was locked in the process. She was sure it wasn't necessary,
but just in case Angel was lurking...</p>

<p>Turning around,
she saw Cordelia standing in front of her bookshelf, studying the assorted
pictures framed on it.</p>

<p>"When did you
guys take these pictures?" Cordelia asked, pointing at the pictures Xander,
Willow, and Buffy had taken together.</p>

<p>"My mom took
those out in the back yard last year." Buffy said, coming up to stand beside
her.</p>

<p>"They're nice."
Cordelia said, "You'll always remember the great friends you had in High
School."</p>

<p>"We'll have to
take some more." Buffy decided. "Oz isn't in any of these... and neither
are you."</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled.
"That would be great."</p>

<p>Buffy turned
and looked at Cordelia. "It's still hard to believe that you're now a full-time
member of the group."</p>

<p>Cordelia looked
sideways at Buffy and smirked. "All because I'm Xander's girlfriend."</p>

<p>Buffy looked
at the floor. "Yeah, I know." She said softly.</p>

<p>Cordelia turned
and lightly stroked Buffy's cheek. "Hey, enough about Xander... or anyone
else." She whispered, "We managed to find time to be alone, let's just
focus on the two of us for a while."</p>

<p>Buffy looked
up at Cordelia and nodded. "You're right. We shouldn't waste time." Taking
her hand Buffy led Cordelia to the bed. Both girls sat on the edge of the
bed, each realizing there were no more interruptions to be had. They were
finally free to continue what they had started the night before.</p>

<p>"So where were
we?" Cordelia murmured, leaning over just enough to close the gap between
them, but not touch.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't
know," Buffy breathed into Cordelia's ear, "I think we were right about
here." She said, kissing her just below her earlobe. Feeling Cordelia's
pulse jump under her lips, she lightly licked the same spot, hoping for
a similar reaction.</p>

<p>Cordelia moaned
and turned her head, capturing Buffy's lips with her own. Pulling her
closer, Cordelia wrapped an arm around Buffy's waist, the other she braced
herself with on the bed.</p>

<p>Buffy reached
up and slowly traced her hands down the length of Cordelia's back. When
she reached her waist, Buffy swiftly untucked the shirt and slid her hands
underneath to continue her journey.</p>

<p>"I want...
take it off." Buffy mumbled against Cordelia's mouth.</p>

<p>Cordelia pulled
back slightly, giving Buffy access to the buttons on her shirt. She watched
as Buffy undid each one and slowly pulled her shirt off of her shoulders
and down her arms. Freeing the shirt completely off of her body, Buffy
carefully ran her hands up Cordelia's arms, stopping at her bra straps.
Hooking her thumbs under the straps, she started sliding them down, but
Cordelia stopped her.</p>

<p>"Your turn."
Cordelia whispered seductively, grabbing the bottom of Buffy's tank top.</p>

<p>Lifting her arms,
Buffy allowed Cordelia to remove her top. As Cordelia tossed the garment
onto the floor, Buffy got up from the bed and stood directly in front of
Cordelia. Taking a step closer, Buffy regarded Cordelia's confused expression.
Putting a hand on each shoulder, Buffy bent her head to whisper in her
ear, "Too slow... ." Buffy carefully pushed her onto her back, straddling
her in the process. "Much better." She mumbled, leaning in to kiss Cordelia
hard. Tangling her hands into her hair, Buffy deepened the kiss immediately.</p>

<p>Cordelia moaned
happily and wrapped her arms around the Slayer. Both girls groaned at the
contact of their breasts pressed against each other. Deciding that wasn't
enough, Cordelia felt around for the material, releasing the clasp on Buffy's
bra. Sliding her hands under the straps, Cordelia tugged it off as far
as it could go. "mhpm..up.." she managed to get out between kisses.</p>

<p>Buffy raised
herself up onto her knees and her bra fell away giving Cordelia a perfect
view of her breasts. Smiling at the gaze locked onto her chest, Buffy reached
down and hauled Cordelia up into a sitting position. Kissing her once,
Buffy reached around and unclasped the other girl's bra, letting it slide
down to lie between them. Admiring the newly revealed view, Buffy gasped
suddenly when Cordelia's hands found her breasts.</p>

<p>Smiling at the
reaction, Cordelia gently massaged the flesh, leaning up to steal a kiss
from the heavy-lidded Slayer. Swaying
forward a little, Buffy looped her arms around Cordelia's neck, determined
not to break lip contact. She failed though when Cordelia stopped her ministrations.</p>

<p>"Do you hear
something?" Cordelia asked quietly.</p>

<p>Buffy stilled
for a moment and listened. "Kinda. It sounds like... scraping or something."</p>

<p>A loud bang sounded
on the window, startling the hell out of the two girls. "B? You in there?"
came the impatient voice of Faith outside the window.</p>

<p>Rolling off of
Cordelia, Buffy frantically grabbed her tank top off of the floor and yanked
it over her head. Cordelia wasn't too far behind her, quickly buttoning
her shirt as fast as she could. Buffy waited for Cordelia to finish before
walking over to the window. Just as she was about to pull the blinds up,
Cordelia grabbed her arm and turned her around, wiping the stray lipstick
from around her mouth. Buffy mouthed a thank you and did the same for Cordelia.
Taking one last glance around, she pointed to the bras, and Cordelia quickly
picked them up and threw them into the closet.</p>

<p>"Buffy? Come
on, open up." Faith yelled, pounding on the window again.</p>

<p>Pulling up the
blinds, Buffy looked at the other Slayer through the glass for a moment
before unlocking the window.</p>

<p>"Geez Faith,
impatient much?" Buffy teased as Faith climbed into the room.</p>

<p>"Hell yeah. Always."
Faith quipped, nodding a hello to Cordelia, who was back over by the pictures.</p>

<p>"So what's up?
And why didn't you use the door?" Buffy asked indulgently.</p>

<p>Faith shrugged."
I went by the Bronze, Xander and Willow told me you went home not feeling
too good. I just thought I'd come see how you were. I tried the door but
it was locked. Figured it'd be quicker to climb up here than ring the doorbell."</p>

<p>"That's cool."
Buffy said, "Cordelia drove me home... .and she's just stayed to keep
me company. I feel really drained is all. Stress and stuff from school.
No big deal."</p>

<p>"I hear ya girlfriend.
I don't know why you put up with all of that High School crap when you
could just be doing the Slayer thing. You'll be burned out before you'll
be killed, I swear." Faith said shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Well that's...
.nice of you to say... I think." Buffy frowned.</p>

<p>"No prob. Anyway,
I think I'm gonna head back to the Bronze maybe... .there were a few
hotties in the place for once. Perhaps I can snag one of . em. Feel better
B, see you later Cordy." Faith climbed back out the window and jumped from
sight.</p>

<p>Closing the window,
Buffy stepped back to the bed and collapsed, sighing. Cordelia walked over
and laid down beside her. "That was interesting." Cordelia said quietly.</p>

<p>"Interesting
is a word for it. Terrifying is another." Buffy said to the ceiling. Turning
onto her side, Buffy looked at Cordelia. "I...we...Faith pretty much wrecked
the mood."</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled
slightly, "Tell me about it. It's too bad though."</p>

<p>"You can stay
the night though. Would you want to?" Buffy asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Sure, that'd
be nice." Cordelia grinned.</p>

<p>Buffy returned
the grin, "Okay, I'll just phone mom and tell her so she doesn't come in
here in the morning or something." Reaching over to the nightstand, Buffy
phoned her mother and told her the plans. Hanging up, she smiled. "It's
all cool. I'll get some p.j.'s for us."</p>

<p>Rummaging through
her closet, Buffy found a nightshirt for Cordelia and shorts and a t-shirt
for herself. Once they changed, Buffy pulled back the covers on her bed.
Climbing underneath the covers, they both laid there for a few minutes
in silence.</p>

<p>Eventually Buffy
rolled onto her side and looked at Cordelia. "Do you think we can sleep
close?" she asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Cordelia
said instantly.</p>

<p>Buffy inched
closer, her head resting right beside Cordelia's. Wrapping an arm around
her, Buffy felt Cordelia do the same as she closed her eyes. Sleep wasn't
too far away for the two girls, and they drifted off
soon afterwards.</p>
