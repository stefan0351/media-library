<!-- Restitution \ Story -->

<p>&#34;Things can't just go back to the way they were.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know that. But I don't want things to be like this anymore. We can start over. A clean slate. That's what you want isn't it? Come back with me. Please.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith and Buffy walked quietly down the streets of Sunnydale. They'd spent almost the entire trip home from Los Angeles in silence. Buffy could already feel Faith starting to distance herself.</p>

<p>&#34;So...&#34; Buffy said, trying to start a up conversation.</p>

<p>&#34;So… Sunnydale.&#34; Faith stopped abruptly, wondering where they were headed.</p>

<p>Buffy noticed Faith's expression. &#34;What's wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I thought that maybe you'd… come home with me?&#34; Buffy said hopefully.</p>

<p>Faith looked at Buffy apprehensively. &#34;Look B… I'm kinda tired, I think I'm just going to head…&#34; Home? Faith didn't know where home was. &#34;I'm just gonna go.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith paused. She'd stopped by her old apartment briefly on her way out of town to throw some of her things into a bag. Everything was exactly how she'd left it. She was amazed at how untouched it was. It saddened her a little to think that after eight months, no one even noticed she was gone. &#34;Back to the apartment.&#34; Faith finally said.</p>

<p>&#34;I thought you wanted to talk.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith started to walk again. &#34;Look B. I said I'll deal, I just don't want to deal *now*. I don't even know how this is gonna work.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy followed her down the street. &#34;I never said it would be easy. I'm not going to lie to you, there are some people who aren't going to be happy to see you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I would say all of them.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Okay, that's probably a little more accurate.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. &#34;See, I told you it wasn't going to be that simple B.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I said I was willing to start over, and I meant it. The rest of the group might be a little hesitant at first, but if they see in you what I see-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And what's that?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy turned to face Faith. &#34;Someone who's confused, scared. Someone who did what she thought she had to do to survive.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith laughed and started walking again. &#34;You really think that misunderstood bad girl crap is gonna work?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy sighed. &#34;Why do you do that? Distance yourself. Laugh everything off.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith turned back to Buffy. &#34;Look B. I said I'd give this a try. That doesn't mean I'm gonna sit in the sharing and caring circle and pour my heart out. This is how I am, this is how I deal. Talking's not my thing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Then how do you expect to make any progress?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not saying I'm gonna go all Helen Keller on you, I'm saying I can't be a fucking Care Bear.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy took a few steps toward Faith. &#34;I'm not asking you to be. I know you're guarded, and that you probably think that showing genuine emotion is some sign of weakness.&#34; Faith shifted her weight. She hated when Buffy was right. Buffy reached out and took her hand. &#34;I didn't expect this to be simple, but I will *make* this work. Because I think it's worth it. I think *you're* worth it.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith couldn't remember every hearing someone say that to her. Aside from Buffy, Kate and the Mayor were the only ones that had ever made her *feel* worth something. Hearing the words meant more to her than she could ever, and would ever, explain. She stood silently, not sure how to react. She withdrew her hand from Buffy's and stepped back a few paces. &#34;Tomorrow B, all right?&#34; Faith said as she headed quickly down the street.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith headed slowly back to the apartment. &#34;Jesus.&#34; She mumbled to herself. &#34;What the hell am I doing here?&#34; She knew the answer. Buffy Summers. One pleading look from Buffy was enough to weaken her entire resolve. She knew that if she hadn't come back, part of her would have always wondered 'what if', but now that she was back, she had no idea how to even begin repairing the damage. Faith sighed. She missed Kate. She smiled remembering their time together, and then instantly felt a sense of guilt for leaving her so abruptly. She debated calling Kate and quickly dismissed the idea realizing it would only make things worse.</p>

<p>Faith stopped dead in her tracks as she looked up at the apartment. Two of Sunnydale's finest sat inside a police car watching the entrance. &#34;Fuck!&#34; Faith realized there was a possibility that their presence was just a coincidence. She wondered if she was just being paranoid again. After debating the plausibility of the Sunnydale PD tracking her back to the apartment, she decided not to chance it and turned around to hastily make her way back down the street.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The gang had been bombarding Willow with questions since Buffy's disappearance the day before. Willow put her hands over her ears. &#34;I don't know!&#34; She said for nearly the hundredth time. Xander paced around the living room. Giles stood next to the armchair staring thoughtfully into space. Xander opened his mouth to chastise Buffy's actions when the front door opened. Buffy walked slowly into the room.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy!&#34; Willow exclaimed with a hint of relief.</p>

<p>&#34;Look who's back from her crusades. So glad you could join us Buff.&#34; Xander said irritably.</p>

<p>Willow approached Buffy slowly. &#34;Did you… Is she… Are you two…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She's here.&#34; Buffy said softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Here? As in here, here? Giles' here?&#34; Willow said nervously.</p>

<p>&#34;In Sunnydale.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's wonderful.&#34; Xander cut in flippantly. &#34;Now we have two homicidal lunatics wandering around.&#34; He stalked over to her. &#34;I thought we had an agreement that it was Adam first, Faith recon operation later. Was I the only one here for that conversation?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I really don't think I have to justify anything to *you*&#34; Buffy said crossing her arms.</p>

<p>Xander continued. &#34;Aren't you forgetting your responsibilities here? We had enough trouble fighting this thing before our only weapon went wandering off to LA.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We're at a dead end with Adam, I saw a window with Faith, and I took it. It was *my* decision to make.&#34; She looked directly at Xander. He scowled and reclaimed his seat on the couch.</p>

<p>&#34;You were successful in locating her.&#34; Giles said carefully.</p>

<p>&#34;I found her. At Angel's.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Angel's?&#34; Willow said wide-eyed. &#34;What was she doing at… Oh! Did she try to-&#34; She made a staking motion.</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34; Buffy said softly. &#34;She's not looking for payback. She wants to… make amends.&#34; Xander scoffed. Buffy shot him an angry look. &#34;Do you have something to say? Because I'd really like to hear how my taking a day off has *anything* to do with you.&#34; Xander opened his mouth to speak. &#34;And don't give me any of that crap about my 'responsibilities'.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander stood up boldly. &#34;It *is* about responsibilities. You think when you leave town all the demons just magically disappear? No. The *non*-superhumans are left to deal with them. We're in the middle of a big demon crisis and you decide it's time to run off to go find Faith.&#34; He felt himself growing angrier. &#34;I don't know why all of the sudden she's so important. Faith got exactly what she deserved, and I know you're guilty but it's not your job to-&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy took a step toward him. &#34;If you know what's good for you, you'll stop talking right now.&#34; Buffy said through a clenched jaw. She turned back to the group and spoke in a low threatening tone. &#34;Let me tell you how it's going to be. I'm going to say this simply and clearly so there's no confusion… Faith is here and she wants to make this work. I know how you all feel about her. I know you don't think she deserves a second chance. And I know you probably think she's crazy, and that I'm crazier for trusting her.&#34; Xander opened his mouth to speak. Buffy looked at him warningly. &#34;Not a word.&#34; He closed his mouth. &#34;But what gives any of you the right to be so judgmental?&#34; She turned to Willow, &#34;You fell in love with a werewolf,&#34; She looked at Xander, &#34;You're dating a demon, and you…&#34; She pointed to Giles, &#34;You were a tattooed delinquent.&#34; Giles cleared his throat. &#34;The three of you should understand better than anyone that people are more complex than they seem. People *can* change, and Faith has. I'm not saying you have to be best friends, but if you don't at least make an effort…&#34; She trailed off threateningly. &#34;You should all know me well enough by now to know that I don't give up on people.&#34; She glanced from person to person. They shifted uncomfortably. Buffy glared and stormed out.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith took a deep breath as she slowly pressed the last button on the pay phone. Her heart rate sped up as the phone rang. &#34;Hello?&#34; Kate's voice said from the other end of the line. Faith froze. &#34;*Hello?*&#34; Kate said again. After a pause Faith heard Kate sigh softly. &#34;Faith?&#34; She said with hopefulness in her voice. Faith held her breath. She heard another sigh, followed by the dial tone.</p>

<p>Faith closed her eyes and slowly placed the receiver back in it's original position. &#34;Real smooth Faith, real smooth.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith sighed as exited the phone booth and continued her aimless wandering of the streets of Sunnydale. She wasn't sure what had compelled her to call Kate. The sound of Kate's voice had comforted her a little, probably because Kate seemed like the only stable thing she had in her life. The time that she'd spent with Kate in Los Angeles seemed like the most normal week in her life for as long as she could remember.</p>

<p>Faith shook her head trying to clear her thoughts away. &#34;Shit.&#34; She said when she realized where her legs had taken her. She looked up at the campus of UC Sunnydale. Faith realized she didn't have a clue where Buffy's room was, and she was almost relieved because of it. Her body had a habit of gravitating towards Buffy, but her mind wasn't ready to deal with the heart to heart talk she knew would arise if she ran into the other slayer.</p>

<p>Faith turned around to head off of the campus when she spotted Buffy walking towards her staring forlornly at the ground. &#34;Fuck.&#34; Faith scrambled behind a bush. She felt thorns digging into her body and promptly removed herself from the shrubbery. She landed at Buffy's feet.</p>

<p>Buffy jumped back, startled at the sudden presence of another person. Her expression changed when she realized who it was. &#34;Were you hiding from me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, I was just-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Inspecting the shrubbery?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith dusted herself off. &#34;I uh… there were cops at the apartment. I just thought…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You want to stay here?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well… I didn't want to, you know, impose. And with Red and all…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Willow's sleeping at Tara's.&#34; Faith involuntary smiled at the though of Willow 'sleeping' at her wiccan friend's. Buffy looked at her with a curious grin. &#34;Did you just smile?&#34; Faith grin quickly faded. &#34;You *can* smile you know. I'll allow it.&#34; Faith smiled crookedly. &#34;So listen, if you want you can…&#34; She motioned to the dorm.</p>

<p>&#34;I kinda don't have anywhere else, and I mean I know that-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith. It's all right. You think when I invited you here I expected you to sleep on the street? This is what you're here for remember?&#34; Faith nodded and allowed Buffy to take her hand and lead her inside.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith stood awkwardly in the middle of Buffy's dorm room. She dropped her bag on the floor. &#34;Like I said, I'm kinda tired so I think I'm just gonna…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Right.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Right…&#34; Faith took off her jacket. &#34;You got a blanket or something?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're going to sleep on the-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The floor's fine. Kinda used to it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not going to make you sleep on the floor. You can sleep in my bed.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;B. It's fine.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you know, it's kinda small for two people, and I don't really wanna-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34; Buffy gave her a small smile. &#34;I meant, sleep in my bed, and I'll sleep in Will's.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh… yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy walked over to Faith and placed a hand on her shoulder. &#34;Are you all right?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Faith mumbled unconvincingly.</p>

<p>&#34;I know everything seems a little strange, but it's a start right?&#34; Faith nodded slowly. They stood silently for a moment. Buffy slowly removed her hand from Faith's shoulder. &#34;Well you're tired, so I'll just let you…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sleep.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded and walked toward the closet. Faith sat down on the bed and pulled of her boots. She glanced over at Buffy and caught a glimpse of her changing. She quickly averted her eyes. &#34;Do you want something?&#34; Buffy said, walking back over to the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34; Faith said quickly. &#34;I was just, I wasn't staring or anything, I didn't mean to-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;To sleep in. Did you want something to sleep in?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Faith said again. &#34;No. I'm…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Five by five?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy sat down on the bed next to Faith. &#34;I missed that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Five by five. And all of your little…Faithisms.&#34; Faith remembered Kate using the same phrase and smiled sadly. Buffy saw her sad expression and took her hand. &#34;What's wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing. I was just… thinking.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy sighed. &#34;We can't make this work unless you tell me what's going on in there.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith knew she was right, but she wasn't much of a talker. Sure, she loved to mouth off about everything, but when it came to expressing her emotions she always found herself searching for words. &#34;I was just thinking about… Kate.&#34; Faith said the name hesitantly. She noticed Buffy grimace slightly at the mention of the LA detective.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Buffy said softly, releasing Faith's hand. &#34;Angel said that you were staying with her.&#34; Faith detected a hint of jealously in Buffy's voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah… She was really good to me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well that's… good.&#34; Buffy said, putting on her most convincing smile. &#34;I'll let you go to sleep.&#34; Faith nodded. Buffy slid off of the bed. Faith grabbed her hand as she started to walk across the room.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy.&#34; Buffy was slightly surprised to hear Faith use her full name. Faith paused. She knew what she had to say but wasn't sure how to say it. &#34;Thank you.&#34; Faith finally said.</p>

<p>Buffy felt like she might cry. She smiled and slowly leaned down to kiss Faith on the forehead. &#34;I missed you.&#34; She whispered. Faith felt her pulse quicken. She released Buffy's hand. Buffy held her gaze for a moment and then slowly walked across the room and crawled into WIllow's bed.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith awoke with the feeling that someone was watching her. She shifted and felt someone rise from the foot of the bed. She opened her eyes, nearly expecting to see Kate in her usual armchair next to the couch.</p>

<p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; Buffy said softly. Faith remembered where she was. She hastily climbed out of the bed and started to collect her things. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I…&#34; Faith had absolutely no idea. She was running, as usual. From her emotions, from intimacy, from Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Sit.&#34; Buffy commanded softly. Faith complied. &#34;I have to go to Giles'. I know a demon meeting probably isn't the best time to test your interpersonal skills, but I think it'll seem less…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sharing caring circle?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith sighed. She didn't know how the rest of the group would take her return to Sunnydale. She wasn't sure if she was ready to deal with all of the arguments she knew would inevitably arise. Eventually she'd have to face it, and Buffy was right, she had to start somewhere. &#34;Yeah… sure.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As the two slayers entered Giles' courtyard, Buffy played the list of possible scenarios over in her mind. She decided that Faith's reunion with the group had two plausible outcomes. An all out screaming match resulting in Faith storming out, or, agonizing awkward silence resulting in Faith storming out. Either way, she didn't anticipate much progress. Part of her almost hoped for the screaming match, thinking it would at least get all of their issues out in the open. Given her ominous speech at Giles' the night before, she figured the latter was more likely.</p>

<p>Faith noticed Buffy's growing anxiety as they descended the stairs. A realization dawned on her and she stopped and sighed. &#34;You didn't tell them I was coming did you.&#34; Buffy hesistated. &#34;Jesus B.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith started to walk away, Buffy gently restrained her. &#34;I mentioned that there was the possibility that you might come. And the only reason I didn't call them on the way is because I didn't want it to be some big thing. Because it shouldn't *be* a thing. I mean it *is* a thing, but I don't want it to be some big…thing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;If you thought I was just gonna walk in there and magically have everything be all warm and sunny you've got some serious delusions.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, it's just… I know them. If I said you were coming, all of the sudden everyone would have somewhere else to be. I just thought it would be easier.&#34; Faith scoffed and started to walk away. &#34;Faith, you can't just keep walking away from this.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Look B. These people don't want to see me as is. The last thing I need is to go in there and catch 'em off guard. This was a bad idea.&#34; She started to walk again.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith, please don't…&#34; Faith kept walking. &#34;Faith!&#34; And Faith was gone. Buffy knew it was pointless to chase after her so she decided to give Faith some breathing room. She sighed and slowly walked into the house.</p>

<p>The conversation halted when Buffy entered the room. Giles anxiously made his way across the room and busied himself in the kitchen. Xander and Willow sat on the couch and looked nervously at the doorway. &#34;She's not coming.&#34; Buffy could see the relief on their faces. &#34;And do you want to know why? She doesn't think you'll give her a fair chance. And I think she's right.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow spoke up. &#34;Now hang on Buffy, that's not fair. Just because you've
forgiven her doesn't mean the rest of us can just pretend nothing happened. She hurt *all* of us.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander leaned forward. &#34;And once again, I'm in complete agreement with Will here.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy shot him a look. &#34;What did Faith ever do to you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Attempted strangling comes to mind.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, I mean really. Out of everyone you seem to be the most upset. I'd really like to know why you have some personal vendetta.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander opened his mouth to speak and closed it again realizing he had nothing to say. He wasn't sure why he was so upset. It wasn't anger, just an unsettling feeling in the pit of his stomach. Buffy had left them. Just left without a word. For what? For Faith. He knew regardless of what Buffy said that she wouldn't have done the same for him. Willow maybe, but not him. He had a sudden realization. He was jealous. Of Faith. As screwed up as she was, she had something he would never have. Buffy's unconditional love. He scoffed at the absurdity of his jealousy.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you find this funny Xander?&#34; Buffy said snapping him back into reality. Xander could tell by the look on her face that it would be better to remain silent. He averted his eyes. Buffy turned to the rest of the group. &#34;Do you remember how long it took you to forgive Angel? But you forgave him, I'm just asking you to give her the same chance.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Angel had that whole demon without a soul thing going for him. What's her excuse?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;She was scared.&#34; Buffy's response received skeptical looks from the group. &#34;I know you can't believe that, but if you'd seen her… When I was in her body, she looked at me, and she had this look of…self loathing in her eyes. Like she couldn't stand the sight of herself. And then she just started… hitting me. But it's like she wasn't hitting *me*, she was hitting herself. Well, okay, technically she was hitting me, but… I can't explain it. It's like she saw me in her body, and, it's strange to see yourself the way other people see you, and I think she… Everyone tells her she's a failure, a bad seed-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No argument there&#34; Willow said.</p>

<p>&#34;Will…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sorry. It's just, you seem to be searching for some hidden meaning here. What if there isn't one? Faith has always been very &#34;Hey, let's go crack some skulls&#34;. Why should it be any different with you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because it is. Regardless of what you all think, I know Faith would never hurt anyone.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow gave an exasperated sigh. &#34;Can we not talk about Faith anymore?&#34;</p>

<p>Giles stepped forward and spoke for the first time. &#34;I think perhaps that's a good idea.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy crossed her arms knowing that she wasn't going to make any more progress. &#34;Fine. Adam. What do we have?&#34;</p>

<p>Xander picked up a sheet of paper. &#34;While you were off on your little adventure, Riley came by with that list you asked him to bring over. We started working on that.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy creased her brow. &#34;List?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Recent demon captures at the Initiative.&#34; Buffy looked at him blankly. &#34;We were going to research them, see if we can find any weaknesses with Adam. Stop me if this is ringing any bells.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Riley. Did you tell him I was-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, and he wasn't too happy. Kinda felt a little shafted. Funny that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Riley.&#34; Buffy said to herself. She'd completely forgotten. &#34;Did you find anything?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's a long list. The Initiative has apparently been keeping very busy. We haven't even gotten through a tenth of it yet.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy stared pensively at the floor. &#34;We need help. And not just with the research. Having Faith here gives us an extra pair of hands that's still not going to do it. I couldn't even put a dent in this thing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34; Giles said carefully. &#34;I know you may not want to consider this option because of all that's happening right now, but perhaps you could try asking-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Angel.&#34; Faith said from the doorway. Buffy whirled around. Faith cautiously walked towards the group. Buffy gave a small smile, knowing how much it must have taken for Faith to come back. She immediately felt the tension rise. Buffy's eyes moved from person to person, daring one of them to speak. They started to fidget nervously, but remained silent.</p>

<p>Buffy walked to Faith. &#34;I'm glad you came.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith tried to make the situation seem as casual as possible. &#34;I'll get Angel.&#34; She said matter-of-factly. &#34;I have some… stuff I should take care of.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy's mind immediately flashed to Kate. &#34;Faith. I don't think you should-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;They need you here B. And judging by the look on their faces I'm guessing they're not gonna miss me too much.&#34; Faith turned to the rest of the group. She took a deep breath and prepared to recite the speech she'd been planning as she paced around outside the door. &#34;Listen… I know I've done some pretty heavy damage here. And I know it's gonna take a lot to prove that I'm not trying to trick you, or siding with the bad guys, or whatever. Most of you probably think I'm just some fucked up chick who thinks she owns the place. It's kinda… well I can't really explain it. And apologizing's not really my thing, but I just wanted to say that I'm…&#34; Faith paused, amazed at how difficult it was to say a simple word. &#34;Sorry.&#34; Faith took another deep breath. She glanced around the room. Her eyes finally settled on Buffy, who looked like she was near tears.</p>

<p>Buffy pulled her into a tight embrace. &#34;Thank you.&#34; Buffy whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>Faith was thoroughly confused and somewhat embarrassed of Buffy's abrupt display of affection. &#34;Why are you thanking-&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy silenced her. &#34;Just thank you.&#34; Faith was still puzzled at Buffy's reaction but she nodded in acknowledgement and turned to head out the door.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy walked down the hall towards Riley's room. An uneasy feeling slowly creeped into the pit of her stomach. Since her reunion with Faith, Buffy felt a change in her relationship with Riley. She didn't know exactly what it was, but something told her she wouldn't be able to sort out her feelings if she was still with him.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped at Riley's door. She took a deep breath and opened it slowly. &#34;Hey…&#34; Buffy said quietly from the doorway.</p>

<p>Riley stood up from the bed and stalked over to her. &#34;Hey? You disappear and all I get is a 'hey'?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sorry, I had to take care of something.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because.&#34; Buffy said forcefully.</p>

<p>&#34;I thought you hated her.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, I would never…&#34; Buffy said softly. &#34;She and I just… It's complicated.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And you don't think I deserve an explanation?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Riley…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;When you leave town I'd rather *you* tell me, than have to hear it through Giles.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked sadly at the floor. &#34;I know, I'm sorry.&#34;</p>

<p>Riley walked over to her. His anger changed quickly to concern. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34; Buffy said instinctively. But there was something wrong.</p>

<p>Riley placed a hand on her shoulder. &#34;Are you sure nothing's wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy felt a wave of guilt as she met his eyes. &#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;'No'? 'No' you're not sure, or yes you are sure and 'no' there's nothing wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Buffy asked, genuinely confused.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you all right?&#34; Buffy sighed and looked at the floor. &#34;Buffy what is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I forgot about the list.&#34;</p>

<p>Riley flashed a relieved smile. &#34;That's all right. You've had a lot on your mind.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, it's not just the list. It's everything. It's… I'm distracted. And it's not your fault, you've been so great to me and I don't want to do this but I can't-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Are you breaking up with me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;There's so much going on and I just, I can't give this all the time it deserves. I need a break. From this. From us.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What? Why, because of Faith?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, because of me. I have a lot of things I have to work out. And yes, Faith is one of them, but this isn't about her, it's about me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Riley. I'm not debating this.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's it? Just like that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It wouldn't be fair to either of us. And God that sounds like a big cliché, but it's true.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And I'm just supposed to say yes?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not giving you a choice.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy I-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Riley, I need this…&#34; She pleaded. &#34;Please, don't make it any harder than it has to be. I still need you. We can't deal with Adam alone, but I just can't do… this.&#34; Riley clenched his jaw. His expression softened when he saw the look in her eyes. He closed his eyes and nodded slowly. &#34;Are you still part of the team?&#34;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and met hers. &#34;Always.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy felt relieved as she walked back down the hallway. She flashed back to her breakup with Angel. It felt exactly the same, and she realized that she'd done it for almost the same reason. Faith. Something about Faith's presence always confused Buffy's emotions, she couldn't figure out why.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;I'm getting a vision.&#34; Cordelia said with her hand on her forehead. &#34;It's… you. And wait… you're telling me I can go home early…&#34; She opened one of her eyes and threw a glance at Angel. He watched her dramatics with his usual stoicism. &#34;And I'm smiling and telling you that you're the most amazing boss I've ever and then you say-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The paperwork Cordelia.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Damn!&#34; Cordelia sighed and slumped back into her chair. &#34;You know we have a lot of paperwork considering how little we actually *work*. I mean you'd think that whole 'tall dark and handsome man of mystery' thing would have the damsels in distress just pouring in here. Maybe if we put out an ad. Like with you and your trench coat blowing in the wind as you walk off to fight some big bad-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Cordelia…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know, I know, the paperwork. Throwing a please in there wouldn't kill you.&#34; She paused. &#34;Especially since you're already dead.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Please.&#34; Angel deadpanned.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked at the clutter of papers on her desk. &#34;It just keeps piling up. It makes you want to just aaaaaaargh!&#34; Cordelia lurched forward and put her head in her hands. Angel rushed to her side.</p>

<p>Angel noticed a look of confusion on her face. &#34;What did you see?</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The apartment was absolutely spotless when Kate came home from the station.
The smell of a delectable dinner cooking on the stove drifted into her
nostrils. For a second, Kate thought she was hallucinating. She closed her
eyes. When she opened them, she saw Faith walking toward her. Kate felt a
growing excitement at the pit of her stomach and used every ounce of
restraint possible to avoid jumping onto the girl in front of her. She tried
to mask her excitement by uttering a casual hello.</p>

<p>&#34;That's all I get? I mean come on,&#34; Faith motioned to the kitchen, &#34;I
slaved.&#34;</p>

<p>Kate responded by drawing Faith into a long embrace. If Kate wasn't such an
expert at supressing her tears she knew she would have cried. Kate swallowed
the lump in her throat and released Faith. &#34;I thought you left.&#34; Kate said
quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;I said I'd come back. It's not *my* fault you didn't believe me.&#34; Faith
said with a wry grin. Kate stared at Faith completely speechless. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're a real piece of work, you know that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Admit it, you missed me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I missed your cooking.&#34; Kate said with her usual nonchalance.</p>

<p>Faith quirked a brow. &#34;Well in that case...&#34; Faith grabbed her coat. &#34;It
should be ready in ten.&#34; She said as she turned to leave.</p>

<p>Kate grabbed her by the arm. &#34;And you. I missed you.&#34; She said softly.
Faith flashed a satisfied smile.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>There were three things that Faith wasn't good at. Apologizing, expressing
her gratitude and asking for help. It seemed lately that she had to do all
three quite frequently. She finished drying the last of the dishes, turned
to Kate and took a deep breath. Kate heard her sudden intake of breath and
looked at her questioningly.</p>

<p>&#34;I need your help.&#34; Faith blurted out.</p>

<p>Kate looked at her with growing concern. &#34;Anything.&#34; She said sincerely.</p>

<p>Faith searched for words. &#34;Back in Sunnydale, I… You remember what I told
you about what happened with Buffy and when I…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith…&#34; Kate said softly, &#34;Just tell me what you need.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Cops are looking for me. I didn't know if maybe there was something you
could… because you're a cop and all, I thought you might be able to-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll see what I can do.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I just want you to know that if it seemed like I was usin' you or something
that's not how I-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith,&#34; Kate said putting a hand on her shoulder, &#34;I'm helping you because I
want to. The Sunnydale PD doesn't understand what happened out there, but I
do. I'll take care of it.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith opened her mouth to speak and found herself at a loss for words. &#34;I…&#34;</p>

<p>Kate reached for her hand. &#34;I know.&#34; Faith smiled. &#34;It's good to see you.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith's smile faded. &#34;I have to… I can't stay.&#34; Faith detected a hint of
sadness in Kate's eyes. &#34;I came to get Angel.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Angel?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We've got demon trouble, like of the big invincible kind and Buffy and I
can't... I just didn't want you to think I was staying. I wanted to see
you, that's all.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm coming with you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34; Faith said quickly.</p>

<p>Kate gave her a half amused smile. &#34;Are you arguing with me?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith held back a sarcastic response and looked Kate in the eye. &#34;I don't
want you to get hurt.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because I'm so fragile and delicate.&#34; Kate quipped. &#34;And working for the
LAPD is one of your *safer* job choices.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You know what I mean. We're not talking about chasin' down a perp.&#34;</p>

<p>Kate noticed Faith's serious expression. &#34;I know.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I just don't want to get you involved.&#34;</p>

<p>Kate stepped closer and took Faith's hand. &#34;I already am.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith felt a shiver run through her body. She gave a defeated sigh as the
argument melted out of her, realizing that Buffy wasn't the only one with the
power to weaken her resolve.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Slow down Danger Boy.&#34; Cordelia said as Angel headed out the door. &#34;She's
here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's she doing here?&#34; Angel said rushing back to Cordelia.</p>

<p>&#34;Do I look like a crystal ball to you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're sure she's in LA?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think I can distinguish between suburban Sunnydale and a metropolis.&#34;
Kate and Faith rushed in to Angel's office. &#34;God I hate it when I'm right.&#34;</p>

<p>Angel approached Faith. &#34;You need help.&#34; He stated.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Faith said.</p>

<p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Trouble.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. &#34;Demon.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What kind?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Long story.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Explain on the way.&#34; Angel said putting on his coat.</p>

<p>Cordelia glanced around the room. &#34;Okay, those of us who speak in complete
sentences are going to need a little more explanation. What just happened?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm going back to Sunnydale.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh that's great, go gallivanting off to Sunnydale right into her trap. It's
a trap.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It isn't a trap.&#34; Faith said.</p>

<p>&#34;Well of course *you'd* say that.&#34; Cordelia turned back to Angel. &#34;Lunatic
with lethal combat skills. Remember?&#34;</p>

<p>Angel turned to Kate. &#34;Do you trust her?&#34;</p>

<p>Kate looked at Faith and turned back to Angel. &#34;As much as I trust you.&#34;
Faith smiled.</p>

<p>After Faith left with Buffy, Angel spent hours brooding over the situation.
He remembered the first time he'd tried to help Faith it completely
backfired. He also knew that a person couldn't change until they were ready.
Faith wasn't willing to try back then, but she seemed sincere this time.</p>

<p>Angel turned back to Faith. &#34;If Kate trusts you, and Buffy trust you, I'll
trust you. As far as I'm concerned, our score is settled. &#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia looked around the room. &#34;I am *so* lost.&#34;</p>

<p>Wesley walked into the office unnoticed by the rest of the group. He grew
considerably paler when he saw Faith. Wesley noted the silence in the room
and assumed there was a stand off in progress. He started to sneak up on
Faith. He grabbed her and put her in a choke hold. &#34;Now I have you!&#34;</p>

<p>Faith flipped him over her shoulder. He landed on the floor with a
resounding thud. &#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34; She asked Wesley as he
struggled to regain his breath.</p>

<p>Wesley slowly pulled himself off the floor. &#34;It would appear that I've made
an... erroneous assessment of the situation.&#34; He wheezed. He glanced at
Cordelia.</p>

<p>She held up her hands. &#34;Don't look at me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's all right Wesley.&#34; Angel said.</p>

<p>Wesley turned to Angel with a puzzled expression. &#34;Am I to understand that
Faith is no longer an adversary?&#34;</p>

<p>Angel looked at Faith. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I see…&#34; Wesley said, wondering what he'd missed.</p>

<p>Cordelia spoke up again. &#34;Yeah, that's the part I'm unclear on. She mentions
the B word and all of the sudden we're all friends?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do you have a reason not to be?&#34; Angel asked.</p>

<p>Cordelia paused to ponder the situation. She hadn't really been around for
the drama with Faith back in Sunnydale. She'd just started disliking her by
default because that seemed to be the running theme. The truth was, Faith
had never done anything to hurt her, and once she thought about it, she
couldn't think of any plausible reason she had to be mad at Faith.
&#34;Whatever. I don't have any personal issue with you. I just think you're
crazy.&#34; Kate and Angel both shot her warning looks. &#34;Which by LA's standards
is… normal?&#34; Cordelia stepped out from behind the desk, significantly more
at ease than when Faith first arrived. &#34;As long as you're not going to go
killing me in my sleep or anything, we'll get along fine.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith smiled, amazed at how much easier forgiveness came in LA. &#34;Deal.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia eagerly stuffed the stack of paperwork into her desk.&#34;Great! Let's
go.&#34;</p>

<p>Wesley cleared his throat. &#34;Perhaps I can be of some assistance?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith quirked a brow in Wesley's direction. &#34;B said she needs all the hands
we can get.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia picked up her bag. &#34;Well, you know me. Always willing to help a
person in need. Fighting the good fight. Helping the hopeless.&#34; She turned
to Angel hopefully. &#34;Overtime would be great incentive though.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Cordelia…&#34; Angel said firmly.</p>

<p>&#34;Sunnydale it is!&#34; Cordelia said with mock enthusiasm as they headed out the
door.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>They waited until nightfall and piled into the car. Wesley insisted on
riding with Angel in the front, apologetically admitting that Faith still
make him uneasy. Faith just smiled.</p>

<p>Faith felt like she was on a strange family road trip. She glanced at the
others in the car. A brooding vampire, a cynical cop, a sarcastic beauty
queen and... Wesley, who amused her to no end. She would have never imagined
that she'd end up feeling at home with such an eccentric group of unlikely
friends, but for some reason, she felt a sense of belonging with the LA
crowd. It was probably because Los Angeles was darker. It suited her better
than Buffy's pastel world of Sunnydale. LA almost felt like home.</p>

<p>&#34;We're here.&#34; Angel said, interrupting her thoughts. They climbed out of
Angel's convertible and headed to the front door of Giles'.</p>

<p>Faith pulled Angel aside. &#34;Angel, listen I…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You don't have to thank me.&#34; He said as he walked with the others to Giles'
front door.</p>

<p>&#34;It can't be *this* easy.&#34; Faith said to herself as she hurried to join them.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The tension was palpable as the entire group sat silently in Giles' living
room. Xander sat between Anya and Willow on the couch and stared at the floor
with his head in his hands. Anya glanced back and forth between Cordelia and
Faith and territorially put her arm around Xander. Kate and Buffy locked
eyes with hostility. Faith uncomfortably watched the exchange. Riley sized
up Angel. Angel stood with his usual stone faced expression. Giles and
Wesley watched the tension rise from across the room.</p>

<p>&#34;Are we just going to sit here all day?&#34; Cordelia quipped from the armchair.
&#34;Because even though this situation has obvious melodrama potential, I'm
starting to get bored.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you Cordelia,&#34; Xander said looking up from the floor, &#34;Your insightful
comments are always appreciated.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't remember asking you. But when I want the opinion of a
basement-dwelling pizza boy loser, I'll be sure to turn to you first.&#34;
Xander scowled and looked back at the floor. Anya glared at Cordelia.</p>

<p>Angel noticed Riley's staring. &#34;Can I help you with something?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34; Riley said crossing his arms.</p>

<p>Anya looked at Cordelia &#34;Why are you looking at Xander?&#34; Anya asked
frantically. &#34;Don't look at Xander. Xander's mine. My Xander.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia scoffed. &#34;Please. You can have him.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy and Kate continued their staring contest. &#34;Is there something you find
particularly interesting about me?&#34; Buffy asked coldly.</p>

<p>&#34;Not really anything I can see.&#34; Kate said crossing her arms.</p>

<p>&#34;Then maybe you should direct your eyes elsewhere.&#34; Buffy growled.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, I took a course on anger management, I could give you a few
pointers if you want.&#34; Kate replied sarcastically.</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Angel. &#34;Why is she even here?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith stepped between Buffy and Kate. &#34;I asked her to come.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I thought we said we were going to keep this between us.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You jealous?&#34; Kate asked sardonically from behind Faith.</p>

<p>Buffy stepped closer to Kate. &#34;Was I talking to you?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith held her hand out to stop Buffy from moving any closer to Kate. &#34;B.
Chill. It's all right.&#34;</p>

<p>Wesley and Giles helplessly watched the situation escalate. &#34;It appears we
have quite a situation here.&#34; Wesley whispered to Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;Amazing deduction skills.&#34; Giles replied trying not to roll his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Perhaps we should intervene.&#34; Wesley said anxoiusly.</p>

<p>Kate raised her arms defensively. &#34;Look I'm not here to cause a problem.
Why don't you just back down.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why don't *you* go back to LA.&#34; Buffy suggested angrily.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't believe you own Sunnydale.&#34; Kate said inching closer to Buffy. &#34;Or
Faith.&#34; Buffy took another step toward Kate.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34; Angel said putting an arm on her shoulder to stop her.</p>

<p>Riley quickly stepped forward. &#34;She can go where she wants to.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're not helping the situation.&#34; Angel said calmly.</p>

<p>&#34;There was no situation until you and your friends showed up.&#34; Riley said
stepping closer to him.</p>

<p>&#34;That's not how I hear it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And who did you hear it from? *Her*?&#34; Riley said with contempt as he
pointed at Faith.</p>

<p>Buffy glared at Riley. &#34;Don't talk about Faith like that.&#34;</p>

<p>Kate laughed. &#34;You shove a knife into her and now you're concerned with her
feelings?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You don't know *anything* about the situation.&#34; Buffy growled.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith explained it to me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;When you were taking such good care of her?&#34; Buffy said icily.</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe if you'd treated her better she wouldn't have run away.&#34; Kate
retorted.</p>

<p>Buffy lunged at Kate. Faith grabbed her. &#34;Buffy, it's all right.&#34; Faith
said, gently pushing her back a few feet.</p>

<p>&#34;You think you can take me?&#34; Buffy said to Kate as Faith restrained her.</p>

<p>&#34;Can you dodge a bullet?&#34; Kate said putting a hand on her hip.</p>

<p>Angel stepped forward. &#34;I think we just all need to relax here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Says the man without a pulse.&#34; Buffy said moving back slightly.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh my God, this is better than television.&#34; Cordelia said smiling.</p>

<p>Xander leaned forward. &#34;Cordelia Chase ladies and gentleman, Ms. Sensitivity.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And I'm sure you're just Mr. Sensitivitity. I'd love to see what happens
when you cheat on a vengeance demon.&#34;</p>

<p>Anya smacked Xander on the back of the head. &#34;You cheated on me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No!&#34; He said raising his arms to shield himself. &#34;I wouldn't.&#34; Anya lowered
her hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Just keep him away from the quiet one.&#34; Cordelia said motioning to Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;She's dating some witch girl now.&#34; Anya said with a dismissive flick of
her wrist.</p>

<p>Cordelia's eyes widened. &#34;A lesbian. I knew it!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I am not!&#34; Willow attested, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>&#34;God this gets better and better.&#34; Cordelia said, turning back to watch the
action.</p>

<p>Faith clenched her jaw. &#34;Fuck this.&#34; She stormed out.</p>

<p>Kate ran after her. &#34;Faith!&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy watched Kate chase after Faith. &#34;Oh no she doesn't.&#34; Buffy ran after
both of them. Angel sensed the situation would turn ugly and followed.</p>

<p>Riley glared after him jealously. &#34;Who said *you* had to be the mediator?&#34;
He ran outside.</p>

<p>Anya rose angrily from the couch. &#34;I can't believe you're going to cheat on
me!&#34; She headed out the door.</p>

<p>&#34;I *never* said that!&#34; Xander called after her as he rose from the couch and
followed her. Willow sat silently for a moment and the headed off to find
Tara.</p>

<p>Cordelia stood up from her chair with a satisfied smile. &#34;That was amazingly
entertaining.&#34; She said as she sauntered out the door.</p>

<p>Giles and Wesley stared speechlessly at the empty living room. &#34;Well, that
was quite disastrous.&#34; Wesley noted.</p>

<p>&#34;Given the circumstances I think it went rather well. At least no one was-&#34;</p>

<p>A smacking sound followed by Kate's voice came from outside. &#34;You little
bitch!&#34; Another crash.</p>

<p>&#34;Hurt.&#34; Giles finished. He sighed and went outside to investigate the
damage.</p>

<p>Buffy, Faith, Kate, Riley, and Angel were involved in an all out brawl.
Cordelia watched from the safety of the stairs with an amused smile on her
face. Giles and Wesley stood helplessly in the doorway. The fight started
when Buffy 'accidentally' hit Kate in the jaw. Kate responded with a quick
jab to Buffy's stomach. Faith tried to intervene and ended up taking a shot
in the face, her body automatically responded with a counterpunch. She
immediately tried to apologize but her words were lost in the growing
commotion.</p>

<p>Anya jumped on to Faith's back. &#34;You had sex with my Xander!&#34; Faith threw
her off, Anya hit the ground. Xander ran to her side and helped her up. He
growled and attacked Faith. She easily avoided him and delivered a swift
kick in the groin. He fell to the floor. Anya ran to his side. &#34;You were
protecting me. That is so…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Brave?&#34; Xander replied weakly.</p>

<p>&#34;Sexy.&#34; She kissed him.</p>

<p>Xander groaned. &#34;Pain.&#34; Anya kissed him again and dragged him out of harm's
way.</p>

<p>Angel forcefully pulled Buffy off of Kate. Riley charged at Angel. &#34;Keep
your hands off of her!&#34; Riley screamed and hurled himself at Angel. Angel
ducked. Riley flew straight over him and into Kate. They hit ground. Faith
grabbed Riley and tossed him across the courtyard. She rushed to help Kate
to her feet.</p>

<p>Kate turned to Riley. &#34;Are you crazy?&#34; Buffy jumped at Kate when she wasn't
looking. They both went crashing back to the ground. Buffy straddled Kate
and raised her fists to punch her. Faith ran towards them. She lunged at
Buffy and knocked her off of Kate. Faith stood between the two trying to
calm them down. Buffy broke free and delivered a swift kick to Kate's
stomach. Kate blocked it and countered with an uppercut that sent Buffy
stumbling backward. Buffy charged again. Faith restrained her. Riley did
a jump kick, Angel caught his leg and flipped him over. Giles gave an
exasperated sigh as his flowerpots crashed to the ground.</p>

<p>&#34;This is ridiculous!&#34; Giles screamed. The scuffle came to an abrupt halt.
They all froze mid punch and stared up at him. &#34;I understand this is a
rather tense situation for everyone, but if you recall, we're all here to
*help* each other. Look at you… fighting like crazed…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Animals.&#34; Wesley supplied. They looked at each other. Bumped, bruised and
bleeding. Buffy wiped the blood from a gash in her forehead. Faith felt her
lip swelling, Kate's shirt was torn and Riley's nose was bleeding. As their
breathing subsided they felt the rage slowly dissipate. They detangled
themselves and slowly stood up.</p>

<p>Faith removed her jacket and offered it to Kate to cover up her torn shirt.
Buffy felt a small wave of jealousy resurface. Angel saw her expression and
put a hand on her shoulder. Riley clenched his jaw.</p>

<p>&#34;I hope at least you were able to work out some of the hostility so we can
focus on the real issue here.&#34; They looked at each other sheepishly, somewhat
embarrassed of their momentary loss of control. &#34;Perhaps it would be best if
we continued this in the morning after everyone's had a chance to compose
themselves.&#34;</p>

<p>Wesley stepped forward. &#34;I think that's a wise idea.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia descended the stairs and joined the rest of the group. &#34;And it was
getting so intersting.&#34; She turned to Angel. &#34;Back to the mansion?&#34; Angel
nodded and headed toward the car. Cordelia followed. Kate turned to Faith
and looked at her expectantly.</p>

<p>Buffy saw the exchange and placed a hand on Faith's shoulder. &#34;Let's go.&#34;
She said softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Actually B… if you don't mind, I think I'm gonna head back with them.&#34;
Cordelia spun around and raised an eyebrow sensing potential for the
situation to escalate again.</p>

<p>Buffy tried to mask her disappointment. &#34;Oh.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith immediately regretted her decision when she saw Buffy's hurt
expression. &#34;I mean, I can come back with you if you-&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy held up her hand. &#34;No, I'm not gonna make you.&#34;</p>

<p>They all headed back to the street. Cordelia and Angel climbed into his
convertible. Faith held the back door open for Kate and then slid into the
car next to her. Buffy watched sadly as the car drove away.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith patrolled the streets of Sunnydale. She pondered over her reasons for deciding to go back to the mansion instead of back to the dorm with Buffy. She hadn't chosen Kate over Buffy, she'd chosen LA over Sunnydale. Life just seemed easier with Angel. Maybe it was Angel's centuries of wisdom that helped him forgive and forget so easily. Whatever if was, she felt more comfortable in Angel's circle of friends than she did in Buffy's. But as for choosing between Buffy and Kate…</p>

<p>Faith realized she'd drifted to her old apartment. She immediately turned around to head back when she noticed the cops were nowhere in sight. Kate had come through for her, as promised. She felt of rush of happiness surge through her body. &#34;God Lockley… you're amazing.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith's smile immediately vanished when she realized how complicated the situation had become. She'd fallen for Kate and she wanted more than anything to tell her, but it wasn't that simple. Nothing in Sunnydale was ever simple. In the end she knew that Buffy would probably make the decision easy for her. The likelihood of someone like Buffy loving someone like her… &#34;Who the hell am I kidding.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy was hurt. Logically, Faith leaving with Angel made the most sense, Faith seemed to feel at ease with him and Buffy tried to tell herself that that was a *good* thing, but she still felt abandoned and strangely, a little jealous too. &#34;Maybe I'm just being selfish. If Faith and Kate are…&#34; She trailed off. The idea unsettled her. Buffy still couldn't believe she'd clocked Kate in the face and instigated the skirmish at Giles'. &#34;What is *wrong* with me?&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Wow, she really wailed you pretty good.&#34; Cordelia said inspecting Kate's bruises as she sat down on the couch next to her.</p>

<p>Kate traced her jaw line. &#34;I've had worse.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia handed her a bag of ice. &#34;Put this on it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm fine.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's already starting to bruise. And with you're complexion, covering it up is going to be--&#34; Kate shook her head. Cordelia put the ice pack down. &#34;Whatever. It's your face.&#34; Cordelia picked up a magazine and settled back into the couch.</p>

<p>Kate stood up and started pacing around the living room. She felt useless. Faith was patrolling, Angel was out looking for news in the demon underground and Wesley was getting the details from Giles. It seemed like everyone had a task but her. Except Cordelia, who didn't seem to mind not having anything to do. &#34;There must be something.&#34; Kate said to herself.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked up from her magazine. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; Kate continued her pacing.</p>

<p>&#34;Will you stop doing that? You're making me dizzy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Not all of us share your incredible ability to turn doing nothing into an art form.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Look, don't take your Buffy anxiety out on me.&#34; Cordelia said turning back to her magazine.</p>

<p>Kate stopped pacing. &#34;What's that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You feel some small sense of victory because Faith decided to come with us. Now she's out, and you're worried that she'll run into Buffy and they'll get to talking...&#34; Kate crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. &#34;And don't look at me like I'm crazy, because I know that's exactly what you're thinking.&#34;
&#34;That's not what I'm worried about.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia put the magazine down and looked at Kate with growing interest. &#34;What *exactly* did Faith tell you about her and Buffy?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Just that she and Buffy were good friends until-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Just good friends? Right.&#34; Cordelia pat the couch next to her. &#34;You poor deluded woman. Sit down, I'll tell you the *real* drama.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Willow walked with Tara across the campus animatedly ranting about Faith as Tara listened quietly. Tara quickly glanced at her watch, keeping a mental record of how long the rambling lasted. Willow had been talking continuously for an impressive twenty minutes, barely stopping to breathe. Tara smiled, thinking that if it had been anyone other than Willow she would have debated using a silence spell. With Willow it was almost endearing.</p>

<p>&#34;It's always 'Faith did this' and 'Faith feels that'. Faith, Faith, Faith. Buffy doesn't realize that this girl is a complete lunatic who would have killed her if she hadn't beaten her to the punch. And she's a bitch. Did I say she's a bitch? Complete bitch. I mean, you've met her. She doesn't really score too high on the likability scale. You know when she first got here, we all thought she was really great, and Buffy, Miss Buffy 'I'm the president of the I love Faith fan club' Summers, was the one who didn't like her. And then all of the sudden… Bam! They have this bond.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Willow…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sorry, I'm ranting, I know, and raving. But it's just… argh. She gets to me. Buffy's my best friend and I trust her judgment, but when it comes to Faith, Buffy gets all weird. Like she feels some kind of guilt because Faith took the big dive off the deep end. I just don't want to see her get hurt, which believe me, Faith knows how to do. All kinds of hurt. And I know Faith is trying to make her amends, but I just can't get past that whole… psycho killer thing. It might be the leather, I don't know. Am I being irrational?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do you want the truth?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's usually what people say when they're about to say something I don't want to hear.&#34; Tara looked at the ground. Willow quickly placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. &#34;Oh! No, I didn't mean--&#34;</p>

<p>Tara smiled sheepishly. &#34;It's okay. I wasn't really around for the Faith thing so maybe I'm not the best person to--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said quickly. &#34;I like it when you… I like hearing what you have to say.&#34;</p>

<p>Tara felt a little flushed. Willow smiled and prompted her to speak. Tara took a deep breath. &#34;I just think that… It just seems like… Buffy seems to be a good judge of character. If she's willing to forgive Faith, then maybe she really does deserve a second chance. And I think it would probably mean a lot to Buffy. Because the two of you are so close and it would probably make her feel... &#34; Tara noticed Willow staring at her and started to feel self-conscious. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing. It's just that you… You're amazing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Tara blushed and averted her eyes. &#34;I don't know about that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You are.&#34; Willow took her hand. Tara's heart rate sped up as she felt Willow pull her closer. Willow had no idea what she was doing, but she suddenly found herself kissing the shy girl in front of her.</p>

<p>Tara went wide-eyed, a look of terror flashed across her face. Willow quickly drew back. &#34;Oh my god. I'm so sorry I didn't mean to-- I shouldn't have-- It's just that I've been wanting to-- I'm sorry. Oh god I scared you.
Don't be scared.&#34; Tara placed her hand on Willow's shoulder and spun her around. Willow saw what caused Tara's horrified expression.</p>

<p>A vampire growled at them. He charged and threw Tara to the ground. He reached for Willow's throat. She hit him with her bag and ran to Tara's side. &#34;Are you all right?&#34; Tara nodded. Willow looked up at the vamp. His raised his fists, getting ready to pummel her.</p>

<p>Willow closed her eyes. She shielded Tara and braced for impact. She was amazed when she didn't feel anything. A few seconds later she heard the sound of a body hitting the pavement. She opened her eyes as the vamp disintegrated.</p>

<p>Faith slid the stake back into her jacket. Willow sat on the ground with her mouth gaping open in shock. Faith silently held out a hand to help her up. Willow took it cautiously and pulled herself to her feet. Faith held Willow's gaze for a moment before turning to head back down the street.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>By the time Cordelia finished explaining Buffy and Faith's relationship, Kate felt a significant decrease in her chances with Faith. She sat on the couch with her head in her hands.</p>

<p>Cordelia saw her expression and instantly felt an unfamiliar sense of guilt. &#34;I'm not trying to discourage you or anything. You're an attractive woman. I mean, I don't *personally* find you attractive but I'm sure that if I was a lesbian--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not a lesbian.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You know that saying about the river in Egypt?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Are you trying to make me feel better?&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia looked at her hopefully. &#34;Is it working?&#34; Kate sighed. &#34;Look, I tried to tell you back in LA that you had to get Faith out of your head. As long as Faith is on her little restitution twelve step program, she and Buffy are going to be getting real 'heart to heart'-y. Plus they have that whole slayer bond thing and--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Cordelia, stop helping.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia gave an exasperated sigh. &#34;Snap out of it! You're Kate, rough and tough Detective Lockley! The wallowing thing does *not* work for you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why do *you* care?&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia took a beat. She looked pensive for a moment and then it faded into her usual self-centered façade. &#34;Because *I* have to listen to you.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith walked quietly into the room. Kate jumped up to meet her. Cordelia rolled her eyes. &#34;Cops are gone.&#34; Faith said.</p>

<p>Kate took her hand. &#34;I told you I'd take care of it.&#34; Faith smiled and shook her head, once again finding herself completely in awe.</p>

<p>Cordelia got up from the couch. &#34;Oh please.&#34; She turned to Kate. &#34;You're setting yourself up for a fall.&#34; She said, and walked out.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Willow managed to maintain her look of shock the entire way back to her room.
&#34;Faith saved us. That's never happened before. I mean, usually when she's around with sharp pointy objects she's trying to stick them into one of us.
But she didn't.&#34; She said in disbelief as she leaned back on her bed. &#34;Maybe Buffy's right. Maybe she… changed.&#34; Willow stared pensively at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Tara remained silent, not wanting to disturb Willow's thoughts. She finally worked up the nerve to speak. &#34;Willow…&#34; Tara said hesitantly. &#34;When you… you know.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow sat up. &#34;Kissed you.&#34; Willow said apologetically. &#34;I'm sorry.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No!&#34; Tara clasped her hand over her mouth, surprised at her sudden outburst. &#34;No.&#34; She said quietly. &#34;You don't have to be. It's just that if I seemed… because I wasn't…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Scared?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah… Well, I was. In a good way.&#34; Willow smiled. She leaned in closer. Tara closed her eyes. Their lips were centimeters apart when the door opened. They both went flying to opposite ends of the bed.</p>

<p>Buffy closed the door behind her. &#34;I didn't interrupt you did I?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked nervously.</p>

<p>&#34;We're you working on spell stuff?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Spell stuff! Yes! Spell stuff. Gotta love that spell stuff.&#34; She turned to Tara. &#34;So, if you want, I'll head over later and we can talk about some more… spell stuff.&#34; Tara nodded. She smiled at Buffy and slipped out the door. Willow grinned sheepishly. She noticed the gash on Buffy's forehead. &#34;Oh my god!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's a long story. And it wasn't Faith if that's what you were thinking.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's not what I was thinking.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy sat down next to Willow. &#34;I'm sorry for surprising you with the Faith thing. You're right, it wasn't fair of me to just expect you to… I realize that she hurt you, and that she's probably pretty high up on your 'People That Deserve a Slow and Painful Death' list. But I need you to forgive her Will, because you're my best friend, and I love you, and it would mean a lot if I could feel you backing me on this one and--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy opened her mouth to argue and then realized that Willow had just agreed with her. &#34;Okay?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Okay. But so help me, if she goes rogue slayer again I'll clobber her to death with a pencil.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Not if I don't do it first.&#34; Buffy said with a smile. &#34;Well, that was easier than I thought.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I got some good advice.&#34; Willow said drifting off into thoughts of Tara. When she came back from her daydreams, she noticed Buffy grinning at her curiously. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Tara?&#34; Willow blushed. Buffy started to piece things together. &#34;Oh!&#34; She said suddenly.</p>

<p>&#34;No. No 'oh'. There is no 'oh'. Not an official oh. And not an 'oh' that we're going to talk about now.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy wondered how she could have missed all the signs. &#34;Oooh.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Cordelia sat in Giles' living room lightly tapping her nails against the arm of the chair as she waited for the others to come in from the car. Xander and Anya sat on the couch, contentedly glowing from a wild night of passion that quelled any fears Anya had about Xander leaving her. Giles came in from the kitchen, sipping his tea and trying to ignore Wesley as the annoying former Watcher trailed after him.</p>

<p>Angel hastily made his way into Giles' and quickly closed the door after him.
He removed the trench coat from over his head. Faith and Kate walked in a few seconds after him. Angel dodged out of the sunlight steaming in through
the doorway. &#34;Sorry.&#34; Faith said as she shut the door. Kate walked over the chair and leaned on one of the arms. Cordelia noticed the faraway look in Kate's eyes as she watched Faith. She shook her head.</p>

<p>Tara motioned for Willow to approach Faith. Willow complied. Faith noticed the apprehensive look in Willow's eyes as she hesitantly edged closer. &#34;Willow…&#34; Faith said slowly.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34; Willow glanced over at Tara. Tara nodded her head encouragingly. Willow turned back to Faith. &#34;I owe you, we owe you, for last night.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't worry about it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll admit that I probably haven't given you a fair chance here. And… and Buffy seems to see something in you, so I'm going to give you a chance.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith could barely believe the words she was hearing. She tried to mask her surprise. &#34;Thanks Red.&#34; She said casually, but gratefully. Buffy noticed the exchange and mouthed a thank you in Willow's direction.</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled. &#34;Well, things seem a little less standoffish this morning. Nothing like a crisis on the Hellmouth to bring people together.&#34; She heard Kate sigh. &#34;But completely not in a sexual loving kind of way.&#34;</p>

<p>Riley slipped into the living room and politely nodded to the group. Buffy waited for the long awkward silence. She was relieved, and pleasantly surprised, when it didn't come. The group stared at her expectantly. She automatically went into slayer mode. &#34;All right. We've got some serious ass to kick. Faith and Angel, you're with me, we'll talk strategy. Riley, Xander, maybe you can use your military skills to work out our plan of attack. Will, see if you and Tara can come up with a spell, anything to slow this thing down. Giles, Wesley, Cordelia and Anya have research detail. Any questions?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What about Kate?&#34; Faith asked carefully.</p>

<p>Angel stepped forward. &#34;Kate can fight.&#34; Buffy opened her mouth to protest. &#34;You asked for my help, Kate's part of the team.&#34; Kate smiled at Angel appreciatively.</p>

<p>&#34;Fine.&#34; Buffy said through a clenched jaw. &#34;We've got work to do.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>And they *worked*. Buffy, Faith and Angel trained for hours. Kate practiced her target shooting with the crossbow. The rest researched demon after demon and relayed the information to Riley and Xander who slowly began to formulate a plausible battle plan. Willow and Tara spent hours trying to come up with a spell that would weaken Adam enough to be vulnerable for an assault. They learned to function successfully as a unit. Their complete focus on the task at hand momentarily pushed all of their personal problems aside. Buffy looked up occasionally from her work to smile at Faith from across the room. For the first time since her return to Sunnydale, Faith seemed to have reached an understanding with the entire group. Even Xander had eventually come around.</p>

<p>Buffy finished reviewing the plan with Riley and Xander. She ushered the group into the center of the room. &#34;All right, here's the plan. Faith, Angel, Riley and I are going to surround Adam and engage him in hand to hand.
 Then we have another group out a little farther shooting him with the crossbows. We're using the extra heavy crossbow bolts, hopefully they'll be
able to pierce--&#34;</p>

<p>Faith raised her hand. &#34;Um, B… not to question your tactical ability or anything, but, don't you think it's a little suicidal to have four people trying to shoot a target if we're standing right in front of it?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy reviewed the plan in her head. &#34;Definitely starting to see your point.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander stepped forward, loving his feeling of importance. &#34;What if we did a full missile attack and then went into two waves of hand to hand?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The only people that are hand to handing this thing are Me, Faith, Angel and Riley. I don't want the rest of you any closer than you have to be. How many crossbows do we have?&#34;</p>

<p>Xander consulted the weapons inventory list. &#34;Five crossbows, four flare guns.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I can see if I can sneak some more firepower out of the Initative.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded her head and turned to Xander. &#34;Xander--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Xander turned to Riley. &#34;Let's go.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith walked over to Buffy. &#34;Now what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We wait.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith started handing out weapons. She walked over to Wesley. &#34;Can you shoot a crossbow?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I did receive multiple accolades and commendation for my archery skills back in--&#34;</p>

<p>Faith shoved the crossbow into his hands. &#34;Here.&#34; She walked away.</p>

<p>Faith handed Kate extra crossbow bolts. &#34;You're pretty impressive with that thing.&#34;</p>

<p>Kate looked down at the crossbow. &#34;Well it's not exactly LAPD issue, but the concept is the same. Point and shoot.&#34; Faith smiled and grabbed an empty duffel bag. She started throwing the extra weapons into the bag. Cordelia walked over to Kate. Kate looked around the room. &#34;So I'm guessing by how calm everyone is that this whole death and destruction thing is pretty standard in Sunnydale.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's life on the Hellmouth.&#34; Cordelia said as she helped Faith stuff the last of the weapons into a bag. &#34;I'm having graduation day de ja vu.&#34; Cordelia looked at Faith realizing the bad memories graduation day would bring back. &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith zipped the bag. &#34;It's all right.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander came bursting into the living room. &#34;Adam's on the move. Hill Crest Cemetery.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's he doing there?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do big bad evil things really need a reason to wander around cemeteries after dark?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Where's Riley?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Someone flashed the bat signal and he took off in the Initiativemobile. He told me to tell you that it was a C.O.P.M. and he had to respond.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked at him blankly. &#34;Am I supposed to know what that means?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Class One Priority Mission.&#34; Buffy quirked a brow. Xander raised his hands. &#34;Don't ask me. My knowledge of Initiative acronyms ends there. He said he'd meet us at the cemetery.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy started to get worried. &#34;This isn't like him…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sure he's fine B.&#34; Faith said tossing Buffy one of the weapons bags. &#34;The longer we wait around, the more damage this thing's gonna do.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked around the room she nodded. Everyone rushed into action.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The group made their way into the cemetery, weapons in hand, ready for a battle. Adam stood with two vampires next to the gravestones waiting for fresh vampires to rise. A crossbow bolt sliced through the air. One of the vampires disintegrated. Adam turned around and mechanically cocked his head to one side. &#34;Slayer.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith stepped out from behind Buffy. &#34;Slayers.&#34; She said over annunciating the 's' at the end as she fired her crossbow and dusted the second vampire.</p>

<p>Buffy turned to the group. &#34;Ready?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith loaded another crossbow bolt. &#34;Let's do it.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy fired a flare in Adam's direction. It hit him dead on. He didn't move. An army of crossbow bolts soon followed. Adam started to approach the group, completely resistant to the onslaught. Kate grabbed her gun from its holster and fired until the gun was empty. Adam didn't flinch.</p>

<p>Buffy was about to call for a retreat when Initiative foot soldiers swarmed into the cemetery and opened fire on Adam. The gang exchanged confused glances. They maneuvered themselves out of harm's way and watched the battle from behind a row of headstones.</p>

<p>The Initiative's weapons had a significantly greater effect than the crossbow bolts. Riley and a line of commandos stepped forward. &#34;Fire.&#34; He commanded.
A wave of ammunition rippled across the cemetery. Adam stumbled backwards and fell to the ground. He convulsed briefly, and then remained still.
Another flank of soldiers hastily bound his limbs and tossed a titanium net over his body.</p>

<p>&#34;Activate the motion inhibitor.&#34; An electrical current surged through the bindings on Adam's body. &#34;Take him.&#34; Riley ordered. He met Buffy's eyes and looked at her apologetically. He nodded to his troops and the commandos disappeared as quickly as they came.</p>

<p>Xander looked down at his crossbow. &#34;Strangely starting to feel a little inadequate.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith stared after the departing soldiers. &#34;What the fuck was that?&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Buffy don't be mad, we kicked ass!&#34; Willow said, trying to calm down the incensed slayer as she paced angrily in Giles' living room.</p>

<p>Xander flopped down on the couch. &#34;Actually, I believe the Initiative was the front-runner in the ass kicking, but as long as ass was kicked what does it matter?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It matters because he told me he would be there for us.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I definitely *saw* him there.&#34; Cordelia pointed out.</p>

<p>&#34;You know what I mean.&#34; Buffy stopped her pacing. &#34;He told us he was part of the team.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We're all on the same side here Buff.&#34; Xander reminded her.</p>

<p>&#34;We were supposed to kill it, not reprogram it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;He's just following orders.&#34;</p>

<p>Giles walked towards Buffy. &#34;Let's not forget that the Initiative designed Adam and therefore they know best how to destroy him.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But *will* he be destroyed?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Destroyed, deactivated. Who cares B? He's off the streets. Seems pretty win, win to me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Giles agreed. &#34;The intent was to subdue Adam, and I would say it went rather successfully. And more importantly, no one was injured in the process.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;G-man's right B. As much as I wanted to kick the shit out of this thing, the soldier boys saved us a lot of trouble. I say we party.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy knew all of them were right. Adam wasn't a threat anymore and that was the most important thing. She knew she couldn't be mad at Riley for following orders, and she couldn't resent the Initiative to fix the damage they'd caused by letting Adam escape. It was a victory for all of them, including Faith. It seemed that in the midst of all the fighting, Faith had finally made her peace with the group. She looked back at the hopeful expressions awaiting her decision. &#34;The Bronze.&#34; She finally said. They cheered and raced out the door.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The gang crowded around a table at the Bronze. Xander raised his glass. &#34;Here's to defeating Adam and keeping all of our limbs in tact.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And not even breaking a sweat.&#34; Willow added.</p>

<p>&#34;Cheers.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy stood next to the table absentmindedly watching Faith on the dance floor. Willow turned to her. &#34;Riley's not coming?&#34; Buffy shook her head. &#34;Some big debriefing at the Initative?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow put a hand on Buffy's shoulder. &#34;You're not still mad at him are you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No…&#34; Buffy said, knowing what was coming next.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you two okay? Relationshippy wise?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy took a deep breath, not wanting to deal with the inevitable relationship interrogation that was soon to follow. &#34;We broke up.&#34; She said as casually as possible.</p>

<p>&#34;What?! But you were- I mean you- it just seemed like- What happened?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know, something just didn't feel right.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You two were so… I don't know, The Slayer, an Initiative soldier, a match made on the Hellmouth.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I can't explain it. It just felt… off.&#34; Buffy knew wanted more explanation, but she wasn't really sure of the reason herself. &#34;It's like eating when you're bored. And then a friend shows up and all of the sudden you're not bored anymore and you realize how *not* hungry you were. It's that feeling. That *non* hunger.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow stared at Buffy blankly. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>Anya leaned forward. &#34;Is this because you're in love with Faith?&#34; Anya asked with her usual bluntness. The entire group froze.</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled at Anya approvingly. &#34;God I *love* this girl.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Not that there's anything wrong with that. Faith isn't really *my* taste but-&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy's head was spinning. &#34;I'm not in love with Faith.&#34; Buffy said quietly. She suddenly wondered if that was the truth.</p>

<p>Anya looked confused for a second and then smiled. &#34;Oh! This is where we're supposed to be supportive.&#34; Anya paused, not knowing exactly how to be supportive. &#34;We…&#34; She patted Buffy on the back. &#34;We support you.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith walked over to them, slightly breathless from her dancing. &#34;Man I missed this place.&#34; She said taking a swig from one of the glasses. She looked around at the stunned expressions. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>Everything clicked in Buffy's head and Buffy was filled with a sudden understanding for the emotions she couldn't place before. Her feeling of responsibility to Faith, her jealousy of Faith's relationship with Kate. It all made sense. She loved Faith. It was as simple as that.</p>

<p>The group held their breath, waiting to see how Buffy would react, Buffy pulled Faith away from the group. She felt her heart rate steadily increasing. She had no idea what she was supposed to say.</p>

<p>&#34;What's going on B?&#34; Faith asked, praying she hadn't done anything to cause the awkward silence back at the table. Buffy didn't respond. &#34;B?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy leaned in and captured Faith's lips with her own. She felt a surge of electricity pulse through her body. Every doubt she had slowly began to dissipate as the kiss intensified. Faith was hesitant to respond at first, but the feeling of the other slayer's soft lips pressed against hers dissolved her impulse to pull away. She wrapped her arms around Buffy's waist and pulled her closer. Their bodies melded perfectly. Tongues and limbs intertwined as the rest of the world disappeared.</p>

<p>The group watched them from across the room. Xander gawked, Anya glanced indifferently, Willow and Tara averted their eyes, surreptitionsly stealing glances at the slayers' unabashed display of affection.</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled. &#34;I knew it was only a matter of time before Buffy and Faith went all Sapphic Slayer on us.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander was completely mesmerized. &#34;Wow… That's just… wow.&#34; Anya smacked him.</p>

<p>Kate sat forlornly at the bar. She sighed and sadly turned back to her drink. &#34;Something stronger.&#34; Kate said, sliding her untouched beer back across the bar.</p>

<p>Angel walked over to her sporting his best concerned face. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; She glanced at Buffy and Faith. &#34;No.&#34; Kate looked down at her drink. &#34;Maybe we could plan a sabotage operation. You can take Buffy, I'll take Faith.&#34; Angel looked like he was about to chastise her. &#34;I was kidding Angel.&#34; She finished off her drink. &#34;She's happy. That's all that matters right?&#34; She said unconvincingly.</p>

<p>He looked at Buffy. &#34;That's what I tell myself.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Big love big loss. Sit down, have a beer.&#34; Angel started to protest, Kate held up her hands. &#34;I know socializing's not your thing. I'll let you go brood in the dark somewhere.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Unless you need me to stay.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No. I'll be fine.&#34; She motioned to her drink. &#34;A few more of these and I'll be better than fine.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith finally parted. &#34;I love you.&#34; Buffy whispered.</p>

<p>Faith tried collect her thoughts. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I said-&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I heard you.&#34; Faith said, suddenly feeling like she needed to sit. The kiss was better than she could have ever dreamed. Passionate. Intense. Since the moment she'd come to Sunnydale, Faith dreamed of hearing Buffy profess her love but never expected it would actually happen. Faith pulled away from Buffy and caught a glimpse of Kate. &#34;Damn it B!&#34; Faith screamed and ran out.</p>

<p>Cordelia watched her go. She glanced over at Kate huddled over her drink at the bar. &#34;Set herself up for a fall.&#34; She slid off of her stool and wandered over to Kate.</p>

<p>Kate looked up from her drink. &#34;Hey.&#34; She said trying to mask her growing depression. Kate motioned to Buffy and Faith through the window. &#34;You were right.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia hopped on the school next to her. &#34;It's a burden.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Have a drink.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't drink.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Neither do I.&#34; Kate said, sliding a drink in front of Cordelia.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith stormed out of the Bronze. Buffy chased after her.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith! Faith, wait! Stop!&#34;</p>

<p>Faith whirled around. &#34;Why B? Just tell me why? Why here, why now? Jealousy? For one second of your life you couldn't stand it that someone didn't love *you* the most? Is that it?&#34; Buffy put her head in her hands. Faith pulled them away. &#34;Answer me!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34; She whispered. &#34;I… I love you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Stop saying that!&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy creased her brow. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith wanted to slap her. &#34;Because you're being selfish!&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy started to cry. &#34;How is telling you I love you selfish?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because I love her B! I love her and you fucking knew it! And now all the sudden *you* love me? Jesus B! You *had* your chance. Shit! I gave you about a hundred fucking chances to show me that you felt something, anything!
And the minute I gave someone else a chance, *you* want another one.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't know there was a time limit.&#34; Buffy said quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;This isn't a joke B!&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at her with tear stained eyes. &#34;Do I look like I'm laughing?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith stepped closer. &#34;I finally had a place of my own. After all that time watching you have everything, I finally had *something*. LA was *my* town, my people. For once in my whole fucking life, I had it made! And you expect me to just-- You can't ask me to make a decision like this.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy started sobbing. The thought of Faith rejecting her hadn't entered her mind. Faith was right. Seeing Faith with Kate *had* made her jealous, but not because she was being selfish, because she realized how much Faith meant to her. She knew her love was genuine. She placed a hand on Faith's shoulder. &#34;There's always been something there Faith. Between us. And I thought maybe it was just a slayer thing, but it's not. I *love* you, and I don't care if you don't want to hear it. I'm not just going to *let* you walk away!&#34;</p>

<p>Faith walked out of her grasp. &#34;Why should you have any say in this? It's *my* life.&#34; Faith sighed. &#34;And damn it B, she's been so good to me, and she's done everything *right*. There was none of this bullshit. It was simple, the way it's supposed to be. She deserves me.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy knew where the conversation was leading. Faith had made her decision, and it didn't include her. It was over. Faith was going back to Los Angeles.
Buffy felt her heart breaking and started sobbing harder. She heard Faith walk back to her. &#34;You're leaving.&#34; Buffy managed to choke out.</p>

<p>&#34;It's not fair.&#34; Faith said softly.</p>

<p>&#34;I get it, all right? I get it. Just please, go.&#34; Buffy pleaded.</p>

<p>Faith felt her composure deteriorating at the sight of Buffy's breakdown. Her expression softened. She put her hands on her temples and sighed again. &#34;It's not fair…&#34; Faith continued, &#34;That I have to go in there…&#34; Faith lowered herself down to Buffy. &#34;And break her heart…&#34; She met Buffy's eyes. &#34;Because we both know it's always been *you*.&#34; Buffy felt her body crumbling. Faith caught her and pulled her into an embrace. She waited for Buffy's tears to subside and whispered in her ear. &#34;Always you.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Do you think they'll work it out?&#34; Tara asked Willow quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy and Faith?&#34; Willow glanced out the window and saw Buffy and Faith locked in a passionate kiss. She smiled and clasped Tara's hand under the table. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander leaned forward. &#34;As much as the thought of two slayer pressed up against each other rubbing their hands all over their…&#34; He trailed off as his mind started to wander.</p>

<p>Anya noticed the distracted look in his eyes. &#34;Xander!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; He shook his head trying to get his mind back on track. &#34;As much as *that* amazes me, I kind of feel a little bad for Kate. It seemed like she and Faith were really… you know.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Having sex.&#34; Anya clarified.</p>

<p>&#34;That's not *exactly* the term I was going for.&#34;</p>

<p>Anya glanced at Kate across the room. &#34;She looks fine to me.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander noticed Cordelia sliding dangerously close to Kate. &#34;I'm suddenly starting to feel like we're in the heterosexual minority here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe it's something in the water.&#34; Anya eyed Willow and Tara curiously.</p>

<p>Willow released Tara's hand nervously. &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>Anya stared at her for another second and turned to Xander. &#34;I'm bored, can we go have sex now?&#34;</p>

<p>Xander glanced around the room at the wealth of female on female action and felt his temperature rise. &#34;I think sex would definitely be a good idea.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Kate woke up in a bed at Angel's. She had no idea how she'd gotten there. Her head was pounding. She groaned, severely regretting the large amount of alcohol she'd had the night before. The sunlight streamed through the window, which she found a little ironic given that she was at Angel's, but no less annoying. Kate tried to get up to close the curtain and realized her movement was being inhibited by an arm draped over her. Panic slowly started to creep into her. She felt a hand slowly slide across her abdomen. &#34;Shit.&#34;
She struggled to recollect the events of the previous night. She vaguely remembered carrying Cordelia out of the Bronze. &#34;Shit!&#34; She looked
nervously to see who it was. &#34;Shit shit shit shit. Please, please, don't be…&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia stretched and slowly opened her eyes. She sat up hazily. She screamed when she met Kate's eyes. She screamed again when she realized she was in her underwear. They scrambled to get out of the bed. &#34;What are you doing?!&#34; Cordelia screamed.</p>

<p>&#34;What am *I* doing? *You* were lying of top of *me*.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And how did I get there?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't drag you!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well I know I didn't go willingly!&#34;</p>

<p>Kate crossed her arms. &#34;And I'm sure you remember all the details of last night perfectly.&#34; Cordelia searched her memory and drew a blank. &#34;Didn't think so.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia began angrily collecting her clothes that were scattered about on the floor. &#34;I do remember *someone* telling me to have a drink.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And I don't remember you protesting.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You were wallowing!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This is from the woman who was sobbing for twenty minutes about how much she missed her car.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia pulled on her skirt. &#34;So help me if you tell anyone…&#34;</p>

<p>Kate scoffed. &#34;Yeah, because it's really something I'd brag about.&#34; Codelia slapped her. &#34;What the *hell* was that for?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Look Ms. 'I'm Not a Lesbian', there are lots of people who would *love* to get me into bed.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's your point?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That you shouldn't… *not* want to brag about it!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Would you like me to?&#34; Kate asked rhetorically.</p>

<p>&#34;Did I *say* that?!&#34;</p>

<p>Kate threw her arms up in the air. &#34;I have no idea *what* you're saying!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This is *so* not my thing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And you think it's mine?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah!&#34;</p>

<p>Kate quirked a brow. &#34;You know that saying about the river in Egypt?&#34; Cordelia slapped her again. &#34;Stop it!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're implying that I'd just go hopping into the bed of the first woman who gets me a little drunk!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't say that!&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia threw on her shirt. &#34;I'm not just some… some consolation sex!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's not what it was.&#34; Kate said sincerely.</p>

<p>&#34;Then what was it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You tell me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;God! You are so…&#34; She gave a frustrated growl.</p>

<p>&#34;Then why are you still here?&#34; Cordelia took a beat and stormed out. Kate looked at the floor and noticed Cordelia's shoes. She picked them up. Cordelia came back into the room. Kate held the shoes out to her. Cordelia grabbed them and exited huffily.</p>

<p>Kate smacked herself on the forehead. She dropped down to the bed and laughed at the lunacy of the situation. She looked around the room. Given the rumpled condition of the sheets and the clothes strewn all over the floor she guessed they'd had fun. And her body did feel unusually sore. &#34;As if this trip wasn't strange enough already...&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith glanced down at the slumbering slayer as she noticed the sun rising in the sky. Buffy had been exhausted from crying and had fallen asleep in Faith's arms the second they got back to the dorm. Faith spent the entire night watching Buffy sleep. She wouldn't have traded it for any other night in the world.</p>

<p>Faith sighed as she remembered Kate. She was slightly relieved when she heard Willow and Tara's explanation of Kate and Cordelia's abrupt and sexually charged departure. Maybe she wouldn't have to worry about Kate after all. Faith still loved Kate, and she valued her friendship and appreciated her kindness more than she could ever explain, but Buffy Summers always had her heart. Buffy stirred slightly in her sleep. &#34;Sunnydale's not so bad.&#34; Faith said as she gently kissed Buffy on the forehead. She couldn't imagine anywhere she'd rather be.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Kate walked hesitantly into the living room. Cordelia sat silently on the couch. It had been nearly five hours since she stormed out of the bedroom. Kate could tell she'd been mulling over the situation the entire time. Kate sat down next to her. She was mildly surprised when Cordelia didn't promptly slide to the other end of the couch.</p>

<p>Kate took a deep breath and chose her words carefully. &#34;I'm a little unclear as to what happened last night and I can tell you are too. It could have been nothing, and then we have nothing to worry about. Since we don't know exactly what we did, we can forget the whole thing and--&#34; Cordelia abruptly pulled Kate toward her and planted a kiss on her lips. Kate's eyes widened.</p>

<p>Cordelia crossed her arms with a smile. &#34;There. See? I didn't feel a thing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia's smile faded. &#34;Nope.&#34; She sighed. &#34;That was pretty much your standard pulse-racing, heart-stopping, knee-weakening kiss.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I thought so.&#34; Kate said with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>&#34;You think this is funny?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No. I think it's very, very strange.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;God! It always happens like this. Some big freakish catastrophic event and the hormones start raging and… This isn't going to work. You're on the rebound, assuming that someone *can* rebound from something they weren't ever officially bound to. And you're a woman, which is just *way* out there on the weirdness spectrum, and even if you weren't, you're definitely not my type. It was just the product of mass alcohol consumption and another sexually charged cataclysm on the Hellmouth. So let's just forget it all right?&#34;</p>

<p>Kate slid away from Cordelia. &#34;All right.&#34; They sat silently on the couch.</p>

<p>Cordelia felt Kate watching her and met her eyes. &#34;This isn't going to work.&#34; Cordelia said again with significantly less conviction.</p>

<p>Kate leaned back. &#34;Right.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded her head. &#34;Right.&#34; They felt their bodies instinctively sliding closer. Their lips met again. Cordelia pulled back. &#34;Damn!&#34;</p>

<p>Kate stood up. &#34;I should go.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You really should.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll just…&#34; Kate motioned to the door.</p>

<p>Cordelia grabbed her hand. &#34;You don't have to.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do you want me to?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do you want to?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Are you going to kiss me again?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;*You* kissed me.&#34;</p>

<p>Kate smiled. &#34;Already arguing the little details.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Stop it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What did I do?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're being charming.&#34; Kate's smile widened. &#34;And I hate it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No you don't.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;God, what did Faith see in you?&#34; Cordelia watched Kate carefully. &#34;I said the F word. You didn't flinch.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know.&#34; Kate kissed her again. &#34;Neither did you.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia shrugged and sighed defeatedly. &#34;Kissing you wasn't exactly on my 'to do' list, but I work for a vampire, I live with a ghost, I've developed mind-numbing prophetic visions. Stranger things could have happened.&#34; She said as nonchalantly as possible.</p>

<p>Kate smiled. &#34;Did I just hear a compliment?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; Cordelia said elusively. Kate went to kiss her again. Cordelia stopped her. &#34;For the record I am *so* not a lesbian.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You know that saying about--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't even go there.&#34;</p>

<p>* * *
Two Weeks Later... * * * Buffy heard the key in the doorknob and scrambled to hide the evidence. She signaled for the man to hide in the closet. Faith opened the door to her apartment. &#34;Faith!&#34; Buffy said anxiously. &#34;You finished everything already?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm taking a little break, there's a lot of stuff on this list B.&#34; Faith said as she gave Buffy a lingering kiss. Buffy glanced nervously at the closet. Faith noticed it. She was confused by Buffy's uneasiness until she saw the stranger's jacket draped over the couch. Her stomach dropped. She released Buffy. &#34;What's the hell is going on here?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing!&#34; Buffy said trying to steer Faith away from the closet.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing?&#34; Faith said angrily as she flung open the closet door. The man waved at her sheepishly. &#34;You son of a bitch!&#34; Faith dragged the man out of the closet and threw him into the wall. She brought her fist back.</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed her arm. &#34;Faith!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This is why you sent me runnin' errands all over town? This fucking bastard's not going to come into my house and--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34; Buffy said again. She gently took Faith's arm and turned her around to face the window. Faith caught her reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>&#34;You fixed the window?&#34;</p>

<p>Faith immediately felt like a complete idiot. She turned to the man with an apologetic grin. &#34;I thought… I didn't mean to… Sorry.&#34; She straightned his shirt.</p>

<p>Buffy turned to the trembling man. &#34;If you could just send the bill to the address I gave you on Revello Drive.&#34; The repairman nodded, grabbed his coat and eagerly slipped out the door.</p>

<p>Faith turned to Buffy with an amazed grin. &#34;You fixed the window.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well I thought that if you're staying here you should have--&#34; Buffy was silenced with a kiss.</p>

<p>&#34;You're amazing B.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Next time I try to do something nice you might refrain from trying to knock anyone out.&#34;</p>

<p>Faith laughed. &#34;I thought you were--&#34;</p>

<p>This time Faith was silenced with a kiss. Buffy looked directly into her eyes. &#34;Not in a million years.&#34;</p>
