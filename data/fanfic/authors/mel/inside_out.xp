<p>"All right Brookie, spill," Nic said as Brooke slid into the passenger  side of Nicole's convertible.</p>
<p>"Spill what?," Brooke asked innocently with a toss of her golden locks. </p>
<p>"C'mon B.  For the past two weeks you've been glowing like Bobbi Glass  after a back waxing and two hours of WNBA basketball.  Someone's obviously  been tossing your cookies," Nic said.  "I'm not moving this car until you  tell me who.  Are you and Josh back together?"</p>
<p>"Nic, no.  No," Brooke answered.  She glanced into the side mirror and  caught a glimpse of Sam unlocking the door to her own car.  Sam looked over  at Nic's car and caught Brooke's eyes in the mirror.  She winked as she slid  into the driver's seat which made Brooke smile and blush.</p>
<p>"Hi hon.  You're doing it again.  Now tell me what's going on or we'll  be sitting on your front lawn until Spam gets her eyebrows fixed...which is gonna take a lot longer than a life sentence without parole."  Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Nic, Josh and I are completely over.  And there's nothing going on," Brooke said sadly as Sam drove past them pulling down the street.  "No one is tossing my cookies."</p>
<p>"Ugh," Nic grunted as Sam passed. "Maybe if McBitch McPherson wasn't cramping  your style, you'd get a little more action.  I can't imagine sharing a room  with that Hell Beast is any more fun than watching Emory Dick bathe in the  drinking fountain."  Nic looked at Brooke expecting what would have been her normal reaction of smiling and nodding.  This time she found it hard to do so considering the circumtances.  But she did it anyway because she didn't want anyone to know what was going on.</p>
<p> At that moment Brooke realized that her relationship with Sam was something  her friends and her social status were not going to cooperate with.  It left  her feeling slightly nauscious and agitated, knowing that the one thing that  was making her happy would be something she'd have to keep hidden from everyone  else.  Nicole pulled out into the street and the movement shook Brooke from  her thoughts.</p>
<p>"Now honey, I think maybe you should give Josh another chance.  He's finally  gotten over the temporary insanity that was Carmen Ferrera and it's so obvious  when he looks at you that he wants you back," Nic stated as they rode off  to school.</p>
<p>"Maybe I don't want him back.  And I like Carmen.  She's a nice person,"  Brooke said quietly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure B," Nic said as she winked and pulled into her natural spot  in the Kennedy High parking lot.  They exited the car and headed into the  mass of students pouring inside the building.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam was leaning against the lockers next to Harrison's as he pulled out  the books for his first two classes.  He was talking to her about something,  but she was too busy thinking about other things to even hear him.  She was  thinking how ridiculous it was that Brooke still insisted on going to school  with Nicole when Sam went to the same place every morning and they lived in the same house.  She was wondering how long she would be able to keep her and Brooke a secret.  As if on cue, Brooke sauntered past with Nicole and flicked her eyes quickly over to Sam and they locked gazes for only a moment, but that was enough to keep both of them going all day.  Sam caught a glimpse of the warmth she had come to expect when Brooke looked at her and couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"Earth to Sammy," Harrison interrupted as he waved a hand in front of Sam's face.</p>
<p>"Uh, sorry Harrison.  I'm just a little distracted today."</p>
<p>"Yeah and every day for the past two and a half weeks.  Something's going  on.  You've been in the 'I'm in love' haze and you haven't even scowled lately.   So who ya been keeping a secret?  And don't try and lie to me.  I've known  you for too long," Harrison said smiling.  Sam was scowling now.  "I would  have thought bunking with Brooke would have maimed if not killed you, but  you've actually been in a much less teen angsty mood since the initial move  in."</p>
<p>"I have no idea what you're talking about."</p>
<p>Harrison opened his mouth to prod some more, but Lily interrupted them  before he could get another word out.</p>
<p>"Did you guys hear the newest crusade from the fascist regime that is the Kennedy High school faculty and administration?," Lily growled as she pouted.</p>
<p>"What is it this time, Lil?" Harrison asked as he closed his locker door. </p>
<p>"School uniforms."  Sam and Harrison's jaws dropped open and they looked  at each other in disbelief.</p>
<p>"You've got to be kidding me," Sam said suddenly focused on something other than her precarious predicament.</p>
<p>"I kid you not.  I over heard Principal Hall talking to Miss Ross about  it this morning.  Supposedly it's just being discussed, but if it's passed  they want to implement it immediately," Lily replied.</p>
<p>"And you got all this because you just heard them talking?"  Harrison asked in pure disbelief.</p>
<p>"You should know, my little activist in training, that nothing happens  if you sit on your hands.  I have made eavesdropping a modern art form," Lily slid back at him.</p>
<p>"But taking away our choice of outerwear is taking away our individuality...our  right to choose.  They can't really do that can they?"  He asked both Sam  and Lily.</p>
<p>"Who's going to stop them?"  Sam replied.</p>
<p>"We are.  You know about me and good causes.  C'mon Harrison, you and I are going to go strategize," Lily said and then turned to Sam.  "How about  an article in the Zapruder, Sam?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, Lil."</p>
<p>"Yeah you'd probably look good in knee socks," Lily shot back at her.</p>
<p>"Knee socks?"  Sam whined.</p>
<p>"Baby one more time minus the cleavage...and the poofy hair accessories." </p>
<p>"Oh yeah you guys are gonna look great," Harrison interjected as he failed  at supressing a laugh.</p>
<p>"Yeah Harrison and I'm sure you'll look fabulous in your penny loafers  and Kennedy High blazer with matching striped tie.  Oh and let me not forget  the whole boys can't wear jewelry clause.  Looks like you're gonna have to  put away your pretty rings and necklaces pal."  Harrison couldn't believe  his ears and neither could Sam.</p>
<p>"Let's get researching, Lil."  He turned to Sam.  "And you-"</p>
<p>"I'm on it," Sam said as she looked at him in horror.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Around noontime, all the students of Kennedy High were once again huddled  around their separate tables in the cafeteria, the meeting place for discussion  and debate.</p>
<p>Lily quickly made her way to her own table which was already populated  by Sam, Harrison, and Carmen.  She threw a flyer on the table and pulled out her seat.  As she situated herself, Carmen grabbed the paper and read it quickly.</p>
<p>"It's official, you guys," Lily said.  "There's a PTA meeting in front  of the board tomorrow night to discuss the fate of our trendy apparel."  She pointed to the flyer that Carmen was circulating around the table. "And that flyer has gone out to everyone's parents already."  They all stared around at each other in fear.</p>
<p>"I can't believe this is happening.  Whatever happened to the freedom that was once America?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah and why the sudden change?"  Harrison asked.  "We've gone this long  without them.  What do they think is going to change?"</p>
<p>"Well according to Principal Hall, wearing uniforms will make us all more  alike.  She seems to think the social order will level itself out.  You know,  no one will feel compelled to make fun of anyone else because we'll all be  the same.  Like we're all going to form some bond or something," Lily explained.</p>
<p>"Therefore eliminating the popular and unpopular all together and forming  on solid society of angry teenagers where social status is obsolete," Sam  guessed.  "Dream on.  Listen you guys, I'm gonna go see if Principal Hall  will give me an interview."  Sam got up and everyone said their goodbyes.   As soon as she was gone, Harrison turned to Carmen and Lily.</p>
<p>"Okay, we've been a little distracted and all but Sammy's birthday is day after tomorrow and I was thinking we could do the whole surprise party thing."</p>
<p>"That's a great idea Harrison," Carmen said.  "We really haven't hung out much lately, the old bunch I mean."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Lily agreed.  "And after tomorrow's meeting we're gonna need some  fun.  Besides, Sam's been really cool lately.  She was a real drag there for a while with the whole McQueen crusade, but I think she's finally starting  to accept things for what they're gonna be."  Carmen and Harrison nodded. </p>
<p>"So it's official. Sam's gonna get a surprise that's gonna knock her on  her butt.  Carm, why don't you talk to Sam's mom and find out where we can  have it.  And I'll try and find a way to get Sam out of the house while Lil  takes a shot at fighting this uniform thing," Harrison planned.  He got the  thumbs up from Lily and Carmen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile twenty feet away Mary Cherry threw herself down into her chair  next to Nic dramatically.  Brooke, Poppy, Josh, and Sugar Daddy were also  seated munching and talking.</p>
<p>"Y'all are never gonna believe this," she said as she tossed a flyer out  into the middle of the table.  They all scrambled for it, but Nic came out  victorious.  "Look carefully Nic for when I feasted my eyes on that dirty,  nasty piece of paper I thought for a minute I'd have to call Mama Cherry for an intervention."  Nic read the paper and her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Hold onto that thought, Cherry.  You may still need to...you know get  her to throw some money around here.  Show the faculty we're not gonna stand  for this crap.  This is so not going to work," Nic said as she handed the  paper to Brooke.  Josh and SD looked over each of her shoulders to get a peek.</p>
<p>"School uniforms?"  Brooke said in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Yo that's not cool...or legal, is it?"  SD added.</p>
<p>"If the members of the PTA and faculty board agree to it, it is," Nic stated.  "But we're not going to let that happen.  I, for one would not be caught dead in plaid polyester or any stiff, generic white oxford.  We're gonna take this machine down with a quickness.  Thank you."</p>
<p>"Oh my God, y'all.  If they pass this little clause there'll be no more  designer names allowed at school,"  Mary Cherry stated as she skimmed the  flyer again.  "Who will I be without my Prada and Gucci and Bob Mackie?  I'll be just like any normal, lower class hoodlum," she cried.  "That's it.  Those burgoise fascists are not going to take away the one thing that makes me who I am."</p>
<p>"Don't worry Cherry.  Not even the faculty could take away your psychotic  tendencies," Nic shot at her.</p>
<p>"Now Nic, I'm not talking about my homicidal nature or the probability  that I'll become a cross country serial killer.  I'm talking about the trendy  fashions that add a shiny glittery coating to my already stunning good looks,"  Mary Cherry replied with a motion of her hand.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry's right you guys," Brooke said.  "We have to fight this.  If they take away our right to choose what we wear, what's next?"</p>
<p>"Agreed then.  If Principal Hall thinks that somehow a big fashion no no is going to cause unity between the masses, her blindness runs deeper than just a physical ailment.  Those unpopular hags are never going to be our equals," Nic said with fire in her voice.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam had gotten Principal Hall to talk to her a little bit and her findings  were just as she thought they would be.  The faculty believed they could band the different groups together under a common thread...or common "threads"  to be exact.  She had said the rivalry had gotten to an all time high and  that the school could no longer take the conflict so they had to try and do something about it.  Sam realized that trying to squash the system was going to take a lot more than an article in the Zapruder in protest.  She hoped that Lily and Harrison would come up with a good plan when she spotted Harrison going down the hallway.  She was about to say something when Brooke stepped out of her classroom and Harrison walked to the blond girl and motioned to talk to her.  Confusion clouded Sam's head and she was going to walk over  there, but Lily interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Care to sign a petition to prevent the suppression of individuality, Miss?" Lily said as she handed Sam her clipboard and pen.  Sam couldn't help but grin and laugh.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Sam replied as she signed.  "Wow Lil.  You got a lot of signatures already."</p>
<p>"I know.  Isn't it amazing how everyone puts such high value on the clothes  they wear to somehow bring out who they are inside?  It's so weird though  because it's like the entire school is against this."</p>
<p>"Well this is a good starting point.  And I'm going to work on my article  after school.  But Principal Hall is pretty set on getting this passed into  Kennedy High Law.  However I can't imagine what Harrison is doing consorting  with Brooke McQueen," Sam added.</p>
<p>"I'm sure it's nothing major," Lily said as she shifted her eyes and grabbed  her clipboard.  "I gotta get a move on, but I'll call you tonight after I  get of work at Mr Cluck's and we can talk about what we're going to do at  the meeting."  Lily took off down the hallway.</p>
<p>Harrison made a b-line past Sam and directly over to Brooke McQueen. Still to this day, she glowed in fosforescent light when he looked at her.  She had the warm glow of a comforting cup of hot chocolate on a cold day.  And she was the kind with the different colored marshmallows too.  His heart raced as he caught up with her.</p>
<p>"Um, Brooke.  Hey."</p>
<p>"Hey Harrison," she replied as she fell into step with him.</p>
<p>"Listen I was wondering if I could talk to you for a second."  He said  nervously.</p>
<p>"Sure, what's up?" Brooke said as they made their way towards her locker. </p>
<p>"Well it's Sam's birthday Friday and we were thinking of throwing her a surprise party.  You know, me, Lily , and Carmen.  We haven't really been  spending any quality time lately.  Sammy's been kinda busy."  That last comment  made Brooke smile.</p>
<p>"That's great Harrison, but what is it you want from me?"  Brooke asked  as she shifted back into the personality where she hated Sam, not the one  where she was dating Sam.  She had noticed Nic cruising around the corner  and had to wear her Queen of Kennedy mask so as not to arouse suspicion. </p>
<p>"Well, I was thinking you could get her out of the house for an hour or  so and we can set up," he said shyly as Nicole stepped up next to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Hey Spaz, don't you have someone else to bother or perhaps a clearasil  shipment to sign for," Nic shot at him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Actually, Your Skankiness I was talking to Brooke," he said as he turned  back to Brooke.  "And I was thinking maybe you could stay after you came back and hang out with us...if you want to I mean," he added with a small smile.</p>
<p>"Sure Harrison I'll see what I can do,"  Brooke smiled back at him.  He  nodded and walked away quickly.</p>
<p>"Hi Brookie, what was that all about?"</p>
<p>"Some birthday party for Sam on Friday.  Nothing big.  Get the parents  out of the house and stuff," Brooke said as she threw her books in her locker  and got her Glamazon uniform out for practice.</p>
<p>"Hon, that's brilliant.  You have this cover story of little Spam's birthday  and meanwhile we throw a slammin' funkfest.  You are truly genius.  And after  our victory over the school board we'll deserve a party," Nic said.</p>
<p>"No Nic.  That's not it at all.  You remember what happened last time we had a party."</p>
<p>"Yeah we deemed ourselves the most popular group in school, that's what." </p>
<p>"Nic I'm only going to say this once.  No parties at my house while my  dad is out anymore.  Got it?"</p>
<p>"Sure Brookie."  Nicole said slyly with a glimmer of mischief behind her  eyes.   Brooke was about to respond when Sam walked over to them.</p>
<p>"Brooke, you got a second?" Sam asked.  Brooke was about to say yes when  Nicole spoke first.</p>
<p>"Yeah hi Spam.  Brooke and I are pretty busy right now.  After Glamazon  practice, we're going to figure out a way stop the faculty from making Kennedy  High's fashion a mockery.  The day I get any closer to being the same as the likes of you and your social and style handicap is the day Bobbi Glass wears a bra," Nic said icily.</p>
<p>"Believe it or not Satan, we're also making a play at protesting this thing," Sam replied as nice as possible in front of Brooke.  She really wanted to try and show Brooke she was willing to sacrifice to be with her.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine why.  You and your fashionably inept cohorts should be  ecstatic.  Uniforms would actually be a step up from your fight for your rights teen rebellion wear.  My cousin Billy has a pair of those boots," Nicole added as she pointed at Sam's footwear.  "And he's in the Army." Nicole smirked and looked expectantly at Brooke.  Brooke fought every bone in her body telling her to take a stand and joined Nic in her semi-mockery.</p>
<p>"Whatever," Sam said faintly with pain and hurt in her voice as she turned  and walked away.  Brooke's smile faded as Nic shoosed her off to practice. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Carmen had confirmed the plans with Sam's mom.  Jane had been really excited  and supportive and offered to take Mike out for the evening so the kids could  have the house to themselves.  So Carmen wrote an email to Lily with the details and sent it.  However, she clicked on the wrong button and sent the email out to the entire Kennedy High mailbox listserve.  Now over a hundred students had an invitation to a party Friday night.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After Glamazon practice, Brooke arrived home to find Sam in their room.   She was sitting at her dad's old desk typing on her laptop.   Brooke shut  the door quietly and dropped her stuff on her bed.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said softly at Sam's back.</p>
<p>"Hey," Sam replied with no emotion.</p>
<p>Brooke made her way over to Sam's side of the room.  She leaned down slightly  behind Sam, bracing her hands on either side of Sam's chair.  Brooke leaned  her head down next to Sam's so their cheeks were almost touching.  Just being  that close to Sam made her blood run hot and her head spin.</p>
<p>"Whatcha working on?"</p>
<p>"Article for the Zapruder," Sam replied still not looking at Brooke. She knew what would happen if she did.  And she really didn't feel like kissing  her right then because she was still upset about earlier.</p>
<p>"Bout what?"  Brooke said tilting her head to look at Sam.</p>
<p>"Uniform thing," Sam said.  She was thankful when Brooke moved her eyes  back forward again, taking temptation with them.</p>
<p>"Sam, that's great.  Everyone's really gunning to get this thing shot down," Brooke said as she slid her right hand up Sam's shoulder and absentmindedly  started stroking her hair.  Sam had no choice but to close her eyes and half  lean into Brooke's touch.</p>
<p>Brooke noticed her reaction and leaned down a little more.  She craned  her neck around bringing her lips closer to Sam's, needing to connect with  her in the worst way.  Brooke was mere millimeters away from her salvation  when Sam pushed out of her chair and backed away.</p>
<p>"Don't," Sam said as she ran her hands through her hair.</p>
<p>"What?  What's going on Sam?" Brooke asked feeling hurt.</p>
<p>"You know what."</p>
<p>"No, Sam.  I don't," Brooke said advancing on Sam.  Sam held out her hand  to stop her.</p>
<p>"You can't just slam me in front of your friends and then come back here  and expect that everything's going to be okay," Sam said angrily.</p>
<p>"Sam, it's not like you don't do it too.  I'm sure when Lily or Carmen  take a crack at me you don't defend me, do you?"  Brooke took Sam's silence  and averted eyes as a no.</p>
<p>"I know, Brooke.  But aren't you getting tired of acting like we hate each other in public when really we're..."</p>
<p>"We're what?"  Brooke said in a small voice.</p>
<p>"You tell me."</p>
<p>"I can't speak for you, Sam...but these past few weeks have made me the  happiest I've been in a long time."  Brooke took another step forward. "Yeah  it's getting harder to keep things secret from everyone, but I'm not sure  either of us are ready to step forward yet."</p>
<p>"I don't want our whole relationship to exist between these four walls,  Brooke.  They're starting to close in on me and I don't have the energy anymore  to act one way when I feel so completely different inside," Sam replied.  "I mean we've been fooling around for almost a month and we still haven't  gone out or anything."</p>
<p>"You mean like a date?"  Brooke asked furrowing her brow.</p>
<p>"Well yeah," Sam said shyly.</p>
<p>"Okay, Sammy.  Friday night, seven o'clock," Brooke stated with a grin. </p>
<p>"Are you asking me out on a date, Miss McQueen?"  Sam asked smiling herself. </p>
<p>"Damn straight," Brooke said and then giggled.  She ran a hand through  her hair.  "It's a start at least, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah it is," Sam replied as she stepped closer to Brooke and curled her  index finger into one of the belt loops in Brooke's khakis drawing her near.   "Now what is it you were attempting to do to me a few minutes ago?"</p>
<p>"I can't seem to remember,"  Brooke said as she brushed Sam's hair off  of her shoulders and cupped a hand on the back of Sam's neck bringing their  faces inches apart.  "Maybe you could refresh my memory," she said with a  raising of an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"I think maybe that could be arranged."  Sam slid her arms around Brooke's  waist and closed the remaining space between them, lips connecting with lips.   As the kissing went on for a few minutes, they had managed to maneuver themselves  towards Brooke's bed.  Brooke felt the back of her legs connect with the side of her mattress and lowered herself down pulling Sam on top of her earning  her a small moan from the brunette.</p>
<p>Sam slid her hands underneath the hem of Brooke's cashmere sweater feeling  baby soft skin and the slight flex of Brooke's abs.  If it was possible their  kissing got deeper and more passionate with every passing second.  Brooke's  hands tangled in Sam's long hair trying to pull her as close as humanly possible  and slowly rolled over so that they had reversed positions.  Once on top,  Brooke pulled Sam up to a sitting postition and sat on her lap straddling  her.  Sam responded by kissing down Brooke's jawline until she reached her  neck and slid her hands around to Brooke's back still underneath the sweater,  still touching delicate skin.  Brooke brought her head back down to reclaim  Sam's lips once more when they heard Jane call from downstairs.</p>
<p>"Dinner in ten minutes, you two," Jane yelled from the foot of the stairs.   Sam and Brooke  both jumped a little but didn't back away from each other.   Sam turned her head to the right as Brooke laid her head on Sam's left shoulder  and tightened her arms around her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom," she yelled back.  Sam turned back to Brooke letting out a  small sigh and kissing her on the forehead.  She suddenly remembered that  her hands were still underneath Brooke's sweater and pulled them out quickly  resting them on Brooke's thighs.  "Sorry.  I guess I got a little carried  away," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"You're not the only one," Brooke said against Sam's exposed throat. She lifter her head and leaned back a bit so she could look Sam in the eye.  "That was just so..."</p>
<p>"Intense.  I know," Sam replied.  Brooke nodded as she traced a delicate  line down each side of Sam's face with her fingertips.  Sam closed her eyes  and Brooke leaned forward to place a small kiss on her lips.</p>
<p>"Maybe we are ready to take things to the next level," Brooke whispered  as she pulled away.  Both girls sat in silence looking at each other for a few minutes, each wondering what level they were comfortable rising to.  Finally, Sam nodded in agreement and kissed Brooke quickly before Jane interrupted  them once more.</p>
<p>"I guess we should head down," Sam said as the two untangled and stood  up.  "You know Brooke, in addition to that being the most intense moment of my life and the most gratifying," she added as Brooke smiled, "it was also a pretty close call.  We might need to be a little more careful."</p>
<p>"Relax Sammy," Brooke said as she advanced on the door gripping the knob.   "I locked the door. See," she added as she turned the knob and the door opened.  Her eyes widened in horror and Sam let out a small gasp.  "Okay, so maybe I forgot," Brooke said with a shrug as she walked through and hit the stairs leaving Sam behind to pick her chin up off the floor.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The next day at lunch, both the popular and unpopular kids were huddled  around the same table.  Mary Cherry had told everyone she had a plan and that both groups should band together if they even had a slight chance of winning.  She was ten minutes late when Nic spoke breaking the silence.</p>
<p>"Where the hell is Mary Cherry?  This was her dumbass idea and I'm getting  a little nauscious being in this close proximity to Lily's patchouli stink,"  she stated coldly.  Lily was about to say something when Mary Cherry came  bursting over to the table.</p>
<p>"Hey y'all.  Sorry I'm late," she said as she sat down. "Now I know you're  all wondering why I insisted that our two rival groups make this connection  and Lily's going to explain."  All eyes shot to Lily and Sam spoke first. </p>
<p>"You were in on this, Lil'?"</p>
<p>"Sam, let me explain," Lily replied.  "I was at the library the last night  doing research and all of a sudden Mary Cherry showed up and cornered me."   Mary Cherry smiled and nodded.  " She said she had something valuable to  show me and that she had heard about my petition and what we were all trying  to do."</p>
<p>"See I called Mama Cherry's lawyer and had him research the legality of  what was going on," Mary Cherry took over.  "And I also had him find out what the consequences would be should I try bribing the school board and if they denied my currency gold mine."  Everyone rolled their eyes and sighed.</p>
<p>"Get to the point Cherry," Nic said.</p>
<p>"The point is that it's a proven fact that even after school uniforms have been enforced, violence rates have stayed the same and sometimes even increased.  There is no correlation between choice of apparell and violent or sadistic acts," Lily finished.</p>
<p>"So their whole theory of uniforms curbing our hostility is bogus," Sam  observed.</p>
<p>"And no matter what they try and do to us, we'll always find a way to rise about you social lepers because it's also a proven fact that we're better  than you'll ever be," Nicole added.</p>
<p>"Nic," Brooke said sternly.  "We're going to have to work together to fight this so just chill out."  Brooke felt Sam's foot brush against her own under the table and looked up to see a smile and a thank you in her eyes.  Brooke simply smiled back</p>
<p>"Sorry, B.  I'm just stating the facts," Nic replied with a grin.  "So  what's the plan, Cherry?  I'm late for a leg waxing."</p>
<p>"We're going to bumrush that meeting tonight,  bring along our hard copied  facts and our social inferiors, and prove to that board that no matter what  they do we are never going to be civil to each other," Mary Cherry said. </p>
<p>"And we're going to stand up for our God and state given right to choose  what we wear and to protect our individuality in whatever form we choose to express it.  With Mary Cherry's lawyer's facts, my petition, and Sam's article we're bound to make some sort of impact," Lily added.  The entire gang smiled and felt their blood rising as they headed in their separate directions, getting ready to fight the power.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"That meeting was a disaster," Sam said to Brooke as they brushed their  teeth later that night.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it," Brooke replied, spitting.  "I can't believe Principal  Hall and BioGlass had a challenging answer to every single one of our points.   I thought for sure Mary Cherry's factual findings would hold up better." </p>
<p>"We might as well have sat back and let them dress us up.  It would have  saved us some time and effort considering it seemed pretty obvious we're doomed to lose the fight," Sam added.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but we won't find out until tomorrow afternoon.  And you never know, maybe something we said will make sense to  one of the board members.  Besides, it got our two groups working together."</p>
<p>"Yeah we even acted like a team.  And Nic even acted kind of human."</p>
<p>"So I guess we proved our own theory wrong then," Brooke realized.</p>
<p>"How do you figure," Sam said rinsing and putting her toothbrush next to Brooke's.</p>
<p>"Well, we were out to prove that nothing could get us to connect with each other.  That our two groups would always be separate and never get along,  but we ended up putting our differences aside to work towards a common goal.   Even if we don't change anything, we still formed one unified force for one day and forgot our petty anger and teen politics."</p>
<p>"I guess you're right," Sam said nodding and taking Brooke's hand.  "And  we're living proof that all things aside, it's the way we feel inside that  counts.  Maybe there is hope for our groups to come together.  I mean, if  you and I can find a connection like this I'm sure that at some point everyone  else will realize that it's who we are that's important and not what we are."</p>
<p>"It's funny, Sam because I learn that more and more every day just by being with you," Brooke smiled back and squeezed Sam's hand.</p>
<p>"Wow, we are really getting cheesy," Sam said and both girls laughed.  "It's been a long day so maybe we should hit the sack before we get anymore  mushy."</p>
<p>"You read my mind," Brooke said as they started walking into the bedroom.  Sam broke away from Brooke and threw herself onto the side of Brooke's bed  farthest from the alarm clock.  Brooke looked at her with confusion.</p>
<p>"Hey, I have enough to sleep through with your million decibal snoring.   So I think I deserve to not have to wake up next to the high pitched beeping  along with it.  Of course, I could always sleep in my own bed," Sam said sitting up.</p>
<p>"Lay your butt back down McPherson or I'm going to have to give you the  tickle torture again."</p>
<p>"Promise?" Sam said with a grin and a raising of her eyebrows.  She lay  back down and drew back the covers for Brooke. "Oh and Brooke, remember to  lock the door this time."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Okay, is everybody here?" Principal Hall asked.  All members of each group were present. Brooke, Nic, Mary Cherry, Poppy, SD, Josh, Sam, Carmen, Lily, and Harrison were forced to stand in close proximity due to the lack of space in Principal Hall's office.</p>
<p>"Yes, Principal Hall we're all here," Brooke spoke for everyone.  She was standing so close to Sam their hands were touching.  It made her feel strong and safe and she was starting to like that feeling.</p>
<p>"Good.  Now I wanted to bring you all here so I could tell you all in person what the board has decided."  An eerie silence fell over the crowd and they all held their breath.  "You're findings and research were quite impressive.  However, they are not conclusive enough to merit the defeat of our plan of action."  Everyone's faces dropped and they were about to cry or groan or show some sign of disappointment and despair when  Principal Hall continued.</p>
<p> "But what shocked us more than anything was your choice to work together.   Our main goal in enforcing school unforms was to get all your separate social  groups to find a common bond...and you did.  Now that you see how you can  get along, I leave it up to you to pursue that.  I think you'll find it beneficial  to all of you.  Therefore, on the basis of proving you can put your differences  aside, the board has decided against implementing uniforms into Kennedy High  Law."  Smiles broadened across the room.  "But I warn you that we'll be keeping  an eye on you kids and if things get out of hand again be sure we will take  the necessary measures to keep everything under control.  You may hug and  cheer now if you so choose.  You deserve it."</p>
<p>And they did.  Surprisingly Brooke gathered Sam into a joyous embrace first, leaving Sam and everyone else stunned.  They both pulled away a little embarrassed, but mostly happy.  Then proceeded to celebrate with their own groups.  They boys grunted in happiness and slapped hands.  Mary Cherry even hugged a stunned Lily and winked at her.</p>
<p>"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make the announcement to the rest of the student body," Principal Hall said with a smile.  They all began exiting  her office when she stopped them.  " And I want you all to know that I'm very proud of each and every one of you."  They all smiled at each other except for Nic who scowled at Sam and her group, and flowed into the hallway.</p>
<p>Harrison was walking between Sam and Brooke and turned to Sam.</p>
<p>"What's the plan for tonight, Sammy?"</p>
<p>"Actually Harrison, Brooke and I are going to hang out," Sam replied as  she stole a glance at the blond girl smiling back at her.  Harrison turned  to Brooke, smiled, and mouthed the words "thank you".  He turned back to Sam, nodded and walked ahead to catch up with Lily and Carmen.</p>
<p>"It's on, you guys.   Brooke's taking Sam out so we just need to get over  there and set up.  Man do we deserve this party," Harrison said with a smile.   "Are Mike and Jane going to vacate the premesis?" He asked Carmen.</p>
<p>"Affirmative, captain," Carmen replied with a salute.  They walked out  of school ready for some relaxing party action and didn't notice the flyers  they stepped on as they headed out the door...the flyers that Nic had made  advertising what the email had already informed everyone else about.  Brooke  was throwing a slamming party at nine o'clock and she didn't even know it. </p>
<p>"Brooke we're gonna miss the movie if you stay in there much longer," Sam said as she tapped on the bathroom door.</p>
<p>"Hey it's not my fault it only takes you ten minutes to get all beautiful,"  Brooke replied opening the door.  "Okay I'm ready," she said as Sam's eyes  glided over her body.</p>
<p>"Speaking of beautiful," Sam said as she stepped forward and kissed Brooke  thoroughly.  Brooke pulled away and wagged her finger at Sam.</p>
<p>"If you keep doing that, we'll never make it to the movie at all," she  said as she slid past Sam and grabbed her keys.  "Now Dad and Jane took his  car so we're going to have to take yours.  And considering I asked you out  on this date, I'm driving it."</p>
<p>"Whatever you say," Sam replied throwing her keys at  Brooke and heading  out the door.</p>
<p>Brooke also paid for the movie since she was the asker and Sam even suckered  her into buying her candy.  Sam and Brooke ended up being two of the five  people in the theater and sat in the back away from everyone else.  About  ten minutes into the movie, Brooke reached over and grabbed Sam's hand and  didn't release it until they were heading back out to the car.  It was almost  nine and Brooke had to think of some excuse to go back to the house.  As they slid back into the car, Brooke made her attempt at a reason.</p>
<p>"It's getting kind of cold.  Mind if we stop off at home so I can get a sweater or something?" She asked Sam.</p>
<p>"That's cool, but I'm sure given the opportunity I could warm you up,"  Sam said suggestively and placed her hand on Brooke's leg.  Brooke smiled  and kissed Sam quickly before starting the car and departing.</p>
<p>As they pulled around the corner to the house, Brooke spoke again.  "You  know, Dad and Jane aren't coming home for a while.  Maybe we should just spend the rest of our date getting to know each other better."  Brooke grinned and winked in mock seductiveness.</p>
<p>"I'm not that kind of girl," Sam said innocently and laughed.  Then she  turned her head and saw the mass of cars swamping the street in front of the house.   "You sure no one's home, Brooke?"</p>
<p>"Oh my God.  No wonder no one was at the movies.  The entire school must  be here," Brooke said quietly as she pulled into the one empty space in the  driveway and cut the engine.  She and Sam exited the vehicle and ran up to  the front door, stepping over one or two passed out kids on the way.  Brooke  was about to open the door when it opened from inside.  Harrison, Lily, and  Carmen all looked horrified.</p>
<p>"What the hell is going on, Harrison?"  Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Suprise?" He said as he shrugged his shoulder and Carmen and Lily nodded  sheepily.</p>
<p>Brooke pushed past him and Sam followed then turned around to question  Harrison while Brooke went off to find Nic.</p>
<p>"We wanted to throw a surprise party for you Sammy. And Brooke wanted to help out.  Then all of a sudden, a hundred people show up knocking down the door saying they got an email about some party," Harrison explained.</p>
<p>"Yeah, remember the whole Josh lap incident, Sam?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"How could I forget?  You sent an email to the whole school, Carm...you  did it again, didn't you?"  Sam realized.  Carmen nodded.  "You really need  to get a bigger keyboard or something," Sam added with a smile.  "Thanks you guys.  This was really cool of you."  She hugged all three of them and set off to find Brooke.  She found her in the kitchen with Nic.</p>
<p>"Hey Satan, thanks for throwing me such a righteous kegger for my birthday.   I didn't know you cared," Sam said as she came up behind Brooke.</p>
<p>"Yeah whatever, Spam.  The flyer has Brookie's name on it therefore once  again excluding you from the coolness that is teen popularity," Nic replied. </p>
<p>"I can't believe you did this after I told you not to, Nic," Brooke said  angrliy.</p>
<p>"B, look at all these people.  They're having the time of their lives.   You're going to be a legend."</p>
<p>"No, I'm going to be grounded again for throwing another party that wasn't  even my idea.  And now you ruined Sam's surprise party."</p>
<p>"Jesus, B.  I'm sorry.  I'll just get everyone out of here then."</p>
<p>"Yeah you better.  And don't forget to come back and clean up this mess,"  Brooke said and started to walk away when she bumped into someone taller and bigger.  She looked up into the disappointing eyes of her father.</p>
<p>"Well Brooke, Jane and I were about to come home to see if you girls were  up for some birthday ice cream when we found one of these flyers on the ground  near the restaurant," Mike said as he held up one of Nic's flyers.  "You two are in big trouble Brooke.  Big trouble."  Jane also looked at Sam with a glare as the two girls shrank together for support.</p>
<p>An hour later, everyone was gone and the house was clean.  Sam said her  goodbyes to her friends and she thanked them again for the party she was supposed to have.  Brooke and Sam said goodnight to Mike and Jane and headed upstairs to start their two week grounding.</p>
<p>Sam flopped down on her bed exhausted from the days events.</p>
<p>"I just want to sleep forever," she said as she laid back, her feet still  touching the floor.</p>
<p>"Well, not just yet," Brooke said as she grabbed something out of her closet and sat down next to Sam.  "I didn't get a chance to give you your presents yet."  Sam sat up like a kid on Christmas morning, rubbing her hands together.</p>
<p>Brooke handed her a small package and Sam wasted no time ripping it apart.   She opened what looked like a jewlery box and Brooke smiled as Sam's face  lit up.</p>
<p>"Ear plugs!!  Brooke you shouldn't have," Sam said teasing.</p>
<p>"It was the least I could do," Brooke said back sarcastically.  Then she  pulled out a larger package from under Sam's bed and handed it to her.</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"Your real present."</p>
<p>"You kept it hidden under my bed?"</p>
<p>"It's not like you've been using it lately," Brooke replied with a smile.   She seemed to be doing that a lot lately.   "Open it already."</p>
<p>Sam complied and tore away the paper revealing a leather bound journal.   It even had one of those leather strings that you wrap around a knob in order to keep it closed.  In the bottom right corner "SM" was embossed in the wine colored leather.  Sam was in such awe, she couldn't find her voice.</p>
<p>"I remember a while ago you told me that your Dad had one of those and  when he would tuck you in at night you'd always be able to smell the leather  on him.  So I thought-"</p>
<p>Brooke was silenced with a passionate kiss that reached all the way through  her soul down to her feet.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Sam whispered as she ended the kiss.  "Time for bed.  Maybe  we should give mine some mileage tonight," she added as she slid up to the  top of her bed and pulled down the covers.</p>
<p>Both girls were too tired to change out of their clothes so they just kicked off their shoes and snuggled into bed.  Brooke slid in behind Sam and held her around the waist as she kissed her bare shoulder.  Sam placed the journal on her night table so she it was in smelling distance.  She smiled.  Sam twined her fingers with Brooke's as they rested on the lower part of her stomach.  She cuddled back into Brooke's embrace and closed her eyes.  Brooke slid a leg in between Sam's so she could get even closer to her.</p>
<p>"Happy Birthday, Sam," Brooke whispered as she closed her eyes.  And the  sun went down on two bodies melded together like two pieces missing from the same puzzle.</p>
