<!-- Confessions \ null -->

<p>On Wednesday, Brooke slipped into Bio class laughing at something Nic
said a few seconds before the bell rang.  She slid into her seat beside Sam
and smiled.  The two girls leaned closer to each other, as close as they
could get without sitting in each other's laps and attracting attention.
 Sam and Brooke had been dating for over two months unbeknownst to anyone
around them.  They had been extremely careful in school and in public, but
it was getting harder and harder for them to keep their relationship a secret. </p>

<p>The good thing was that their parents, being thoroughly pleased that Brooke
and Sam had appeared to be getting along a little better, had squashed their
idea to go forth into a hasty wedding.  It was currently being postponed
for as long it took Mike and Jane to feel completely ready to merge two families
together.  This recent change was something that everyone was happy about,
especially Sam and Brooke.  Neither girl was ready to give up their old lives
or previous parents just yet.  As close as they had gotten in the past few
months, they were still one-hundred percent against becoming a "family".
 Besides that would make the sort of related and then where would that leave
them?  Dating your stepsister, even before the fact, isn't exactly conventional.
 As long as they were just living together, the whole situation was a lot
less confusing.</p>

<p>"So," Sam was saying.  "I have to hang out after school to edit some stuff
for the paper.  We're running a little behind and the deadline's the end
of the week.  And I know you have Glamazon practice so I was thinking we
could meet up after and ride home together."</p>

<p>"Sam, do you remember what happened last time we drove home together?"
Broke smiled back at her.</p>

<p>"What are you implying?"  Sam gave her best mock astonishment look.</p>

<p>"Oh I dunno.  Our little pit stop caused us to be late for dinner and
I thought Dad and Jane were going to question us to death."  Brooke got quiet
for a minute.  "It really sucks having to be so secretive about all of this,"
she said staring at her hands.</p>

<p>"Hey, don't stress about it," Sam replied putting a hand on Brooke's arm
reassuringly.  Without even really knowing it, Sam hooked her foot around
Brooke's ankle as the dangled off of the lab seats.  They weren't really
playing footsies.  They were just trying to be close in anyway they could.</p>
<p>"Everything sucks, yeah...okay not everything,"she added as she gave Brooke's
arm a squeeze.  "Things are rough, but at some point they'll will work out.
 And when it's time to take things further, we'll just know."</p>

<p>"Think so?"  Brooke asked looking Sam in the eye.  Sam nodded in response
and smiled.</p>

<p>Behind them, Nic and Harrison were witnessing the body language in astonishment.
 Of course, Harrison already had his suspicions and he couldn't decide if
he was happy that Sam was snagging the most beautiful girl at Kennedy or
if he was pissed that Sam was snagging the girl he had been crushing on forever.
 Nic just couldn't figure out what Brooke had been so sweet to Sam lately.
 She assumed that Brooke's dad was making her be nice to Sam.  When the footsies
began, both Harrison and Nic's jaws dropped.  What was that all about?  Nic
was about to say something to Brooke when Bobbi Glass stormed into class.
 She made a stop at Sam and Brooke's lab space.</p>

<p>"Miss McQueen, if you and Miss McPherson are done playing footsies I'd
like to begin class now," she whispered as she winked and walked towards
the front of the room.  Brooke and Sam simultaneously looked down blushing
and separated, moving to opposite ends of the table.  Harrison smiled a little
and Nic glared at him and then at Sam's back.</p>

<p>"All right, class.  This week's topic..and all you hormonal, highly sex-driven
youngsters are going to love it...is the mating habits of mammals and other
select horny creatures of the world."</p>

<p>"All right, Miss Glass.  Finally something we can all relate to," Josh
said with a smile as Carmen just rolled her eyes at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Ford.  I'm sure you can relate more than any of us here.  I,
for one, remember your unfortunate lap incident with Miss McPherson a few
months back," Bobbi Glass replied with her trademark laugh.  Josh looked
down horrified and Sam could've been his twin at that moment.  Everyone else
snickered, including Brooke who nudged Sam with her elbow.</p>

<p>"Can't say I blame him," Brooke whispered and raised her eyebrows at Sam.
 Sam turned an even deeper shade of crimson.</p>

<p>"So we're not going to touch on the whole natural selection deal quite
yet, but delve into the core of human nature.  We're going to study body
chemistry and the question of why we do the things we do...why we act the
way we act and what drives us to do so.  You'll find that it's not just the
mind that causes such reactions," Miss Glass stared at Josh and smiled, "but
also the body and it's chemical products that give us the heads up in the
first place.  Sort of a why we like what we tend to like sort of experimentation."
 Lily raised her hand.  "Yes Miss Esposito.  Please tell me you're not going
to go all nutjob activist girl on me today.  I haven't had my valium yet." </p>

<p>"Actually Miss Glass, I was just going to ask about the experiment part?"
 Lily replied.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, the experiment part.  It's less of an experiment and more of
an assignment."  This got groans from everyone.  "Now now, kids.  As much
as I would like you all to suffer, I think you might actually enjoy this.
 If you find yourself in a situation this week where your hormones are taking
control of your body, which should be everyday for you hyped up teens, I
want you to let them.  And if you don't find yourself in any such situation,
put yourself in one.  Now I'm not giving you the go to do the horizontal
hokey pokey or anything like that.  Your assignment is to try and figure
out why your body is causing you to act in the manner you are acting.  Hormones?
 Chemicals?  Thoughts?  Feelings?  Weed through the masses and write me a
6-8 page paper on your findings."  She paused.</p>

<p> "Oh and you don't necessarily need another person to help aid in this
assignment.  There's quite enough eye candy on the WB or in Teen People to
get your engine started."  She paused taking in the horrified looks on everyone's
faces.  "And I don't want an 8 page Hustler story to take into bed with me
on the long, cold winter nights.  I want purely factual and that means some
research.  If you run into trouble, ask your partners for help.  I will be
unavailable due to the Facts of Life marathon running on Nick at Night all
this week.  Questions?"</p>

<p>"Yeah hi Miss Glass, why would any of us want you to know the sorted details
of our very private sex lives?" Nic asked.</p>

<p>"By the shape I see your knees are in, Miss Julian, I'm pretty sure everyone
here already knows the details of your," using air quotes, " 'sex life'.
 If you want to pass this class, do the assignment.  And keep it scientific.
 Have an interesting week, pups."  And with that Bobbi Glass mock saluted
everyone, smiled and cackled, and exited the classroom.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Hey SD, I need some advice," Josh said as he stopped by Sugar Daddy's
locker on the way to the gym.</p>

<p>"What's up, bro?"</p>

<p>"Well, ever since Brooke and I broke up something's been missing from
my life.  Even when I was with Carmen, I still had feelings for Brooke."</p>

<p>"And now you want her back."</p>

<p>"Yeah, SD.  So bad.  But I have no idea how to do it."</p>

<p>"Dude, Miss Glass' experiment is the perfect opportunity.  You get together
with boo and sparks will start flyin.  Then bam you two reconnect and your
paper's done too," SD summarized.</p>

<p>"Think that'll really work, SD?"  Josh said smiling.</p>

<p>"Hells yeah, bro.  You two are meant for each other, heart, soul and hormones,"
SD replied as he punched Josh in the shoulder and the two headed towards
wrestling practice.</p>

<p>Three quarters of the way down the hall, Josh spotted Brooke getting her
Glamazon uniform out of her locker.  SD looked at him, knocked fists, and
said good luck as he departed and went his separate way.</p>

<p>"Hi Brooke," Josh said gliding over to her locker.</p>

<p>"Hey Joshy, what's up?"  She replied grabbing one of her notebooks.</p>

<p>"Well Brooke, I was thinking maybe you and I could hang out this week.
 Like say Friday night after the game?"  Josh asked with confidence.  Brooke
hesitated.  Did she have plans with Sam on Friday?  And did she even want
to hang out with Josh?  They had been through a lot and they were still friends. </p>

<p>"Um, sure Joshy.  What did you have in mind?"  Brooke asked with a smile.
 It was only hanging out, right?  She was over him and he had already moved
on.</p>

<p>"I dunno yet.  I'll think of something special and surprise you," Josh
said smiling back, feeling good about his chances.</p>

<p>"Okay, I have to head to practice."</p>

<p>"Me too.  How bout we walk over there together," Josh offered.  Brooke,
cursing herself in her head,  nodded a yes and the two made their way over
to the gym.</p>


<p>Nic noticed Brooke and Josh enter the gym together and all the tension
gripping her body released.  She smiled as Brooke waved a small goodbye to
Josh and headed her way.</p>

<p>"I see Mr. and Mrs. J. Crew have squashed their separation," Nic said
with a smirk.  "The royalty is back in reigning order."</p>

<p>"Actually, Nic.  We're just friends."</p>

<p>"Sure B.  I was getting a little worried about you.  Thought I'd have
to start searching your room for Melissa Etheridge cds."  Brooke's face dropped. </p>

<p>"What are you talking about Nic?"  She asked horrified.</p>

<p>"You and McPherson and the googly eyes.  I thought for a second you were
switching teams, but then it hit me that Brooke McQueen would never stoop
to that level for any reason.  I don't know what would turn my stomach more--the
girl factor or the Spam factor.  I'd hope B that if you decided that flannels
and Birkenstocks were your preference that you'd pick someone a little less
repulsive than Sam McPherson."</p>

<p>"Nic, that's so ridiculous.  I've been hanging out with Sam because Dad
and Jane are making us," Brooke explained.   "I was born to rule this school
with the star quarterback on my arm and that's what I plan to do."  Brooke
was horrified with herself for caving, but she had to think of something. </p>

<p>"So you and Josh are back together!"  Nic said excitedly.</p>

<p>"Right now we're just friends, but we're hanging out on Friday night,"
Brooke replied with a smile that was masking the sick feeling she was having
inside.</p>

<p>"Brookie hon, I'm so sorry.  I can't believe I ever thought you and Spam...ugh,"
Nic said quietly.</p>

<p>"S'okay Nic. We all make mistakes," Brooke replied as she looked over
at Josh smiling at her and went off with Nic to start practice.</p>


<p>Practice was a blur.  Brooke couldn't concentrate on anything she was
doing and because of her distraction they got very little work done.  Nic
made some comment to her about being all worked up over Josh thoughts.  Brooke
thought she couldn't have been more wrong.  All practice long, Brooke was
thinking about Sam and how happy she was when they were together.  How she
missed her when they were apart even for an hour.</p>

<p>Brooke felt an insane amount of pressure to live up to her rep...as captain
of the cheerleading squad...as Josh Ford's girlfriend..as the all American
do right girl.  But there was nothing there between her and Josh, at least
nothing that even compared to what she was feeling for Sam.  Would anyone
ever understand that?  And would Brooke ever be ready to tell anyone about
her and Sam's relationship?  She knew one thing for sure and that was hanging
out with Josh would not be a date.  She was already dating someone and that
was the only person she wanted.  Brooke left Glamazon practice more confused
than she had been in a long time.</p>

<p>"Need a ride, B?" Nic asked as they headed towards the exit.</p>

<p>"No thanks.  I'm fine," Brooke replied looking around for Sam.</p>

<p>"Okay, hon.  Oh and B, I'm so happy for you.  Everything's going to start
working out again and you will reclaim your birthright of school domination,"
Nic added as she smiled her goodbye and left Brooke alone in the hallway.
 A few seconds later Sam rounded the corner and upon seeing Brooke smiled
like a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>"Ready to go?" She asked as Brooke walked to meet her halfway.</p>

<p>"You have no idea,"  Brooke said forcefully grabbing the keys out of Sam's
hands.  "I'm driving."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am," Sam replied shocked by Brooke's sudden change in demeanor.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Five minutes later at Rocky's Alcove, a dark out of sight stretch of dirt
road in the hills and currently Brooke and Sam's favorite makeout spot, Brooke
had Sam pinned to the back seat of the convertible.  They were currently
involved in one hot and heavy grope-fest.  Steamy was an understatement at
this point.  Brooke was trying desperately to find out what was really going
on with her and in an effort to make herself feel better about flirting with
Josh on the sly for image purposes only, she was trying to prove to Sam just
how much she meant to her.  Brooke had to let Sam know that no matter what
was going to happen, she would always come first in her heart.</p>

<p>Maybe it was Bobbi Glass' assignment or inhibitions being left at the
wayside, but a half hour ago second base was a faint memory and neither girl
was protesting.  Hands were wandering of their own accord and no one was
around to supervise them.  The intensity of Brooke's kisses were sending
shivers down Sam's spine.  They were the good kind of shivers when everything
felt so right she wanted to be as close to Brooke as possible.  Sam tightened
her arms around Brooke's body bearing down on top of her and held her flush
against her own body.  Brooke's legs tangled with Sam's for a moment before
fitting one in between Sam's.  One of Brooke's hands was braced on the seat
next to Sam's head as she continued her assault on the pulse point of Sam's
neck.  The other hand was making it's way up under the hem of Sam's shirt
when an alarm went off...not in anyone's head this time, but an actual alarm. </p>

<p>Sam pulled away breathless, but Brooke straddled her not letting her up.
 Sam looked at her watch and killed the alarm.</p>

<p>"We're going to be late for dinner, Brooke," She said trying to catch
her breath.</p>

<p>"Screw dinner," Brooke said as she hungrily captured Sam's lips with her
own once again.  Sam responded by digging her hands into Brooke's hair, holding
it off of her face.  She leaned back capturing Brooke's eyes with her own
and suddenly there were no words she could find that would have been suitable.
 Sam stared at Brooke staring back at her and felt a connection like none
she had ever felt before and she knew that Brooke was feeling it too.</p>

<p>At that moment, Brooke needed Sam to be a part of her.  It was already
starting to happen, she knew that.  So how did she ever think she'd be able
to pull off her social image and have Sam waiting behind the scenes for her?
 Brooke started to feel an enormous amount of guilt in decieving someone
she was falling in love with and bit her lip trying so hard to supress the
tears stinging her eyes.  She was going to prove to Sam right now that she
was all that mattered.</p>

<p>Brooke leaned down and kissed Sam on the forehead, a single stray tear
spilling onto the surface.  She kissed her way down past Sam's lips to her
jawline and neck.  Sam's grip tightened willing Brooke to continue.  Miss
Glass said to go with it, right?  The difference was that Sam knew what was
happening had to do with a lot more than hormones.  Sam closed her eyes caught
in the moment when she felt Brooke's hand glide down her stomach and stop
on the button of her cargo pants.  She felt the button being loosened out
of it's confinement and sat up backing away slightly.</p>

<p>"Shit Brooke, I'm sorry," Sam said quietly pushing her hair behind her
ears.  She pulled her shirt back down covering her exposed stomach.  Brooke
was sitting back on her heels looking down.</p>

<p>"No Sam, I'm the one who's sorry.  I don't know what's come over me."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Miss Glass would chalk it up to hormones."</p>

<p>"Sam, you know what I feel for you is way more than hormonal don't you?"
 Brooke asked tilting Sam's head so she could look her in the face.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know.  You felt what passed between us just now, right?" Sam
took both of Brooke's in her own feeling how cold they were.</p>

<p>"I did.  But I don't think I'll ever be able to describe what it was." </p>

<p>"It was a hell of a lot more than chemical.  I've never felt that way
before...so connected to someone else," Sam added rubbing Brooke's ice cold
hands in her own.  "Brooke, what's wrong?  Your hands are like ice."  Brooke
tried pulling her hands away, but Sam wouldn't let her.</p>

<p>"I don't really know.  I guess I'm just sorta nervous.  I've never felt
this way before either Sam.  I've never been this connected to anyone and
it's kind of scary."</p>

<p>"What about Josh?  I mean you had sex with him didn't you?  You must have
loved him," Sam said averting her eyes.</p>

<p>"Sex doesn't necessarily mean love.  Yes, I had sex with Josh, but I broke
up with him the day after because as hard as I tried I couldn't find a solid
connection with him.  I realize now what I was missing with him, Sam, because
I have it with you.  I thought I loved him at the time and maybe I did, but
it doesn't even compare to the way I love you," Brooke said as a lightbulb
flashed in her head.  Sam turned to her and looked up with surprise.  Brooke
smiled and reached up to brush a stray hair off of Sam's forehead.  "I love
you, Sam," Brooke repeated like she was saying it for the first time.</p>

<p>"I love you too, Brooke," Sam replied half smiling, half trying not to
cry she was so happy.  So it was official and they were in love.  It wasn't
hormones or experimentation or just sex.  It was feelings and emotions and
an actual relationship.  They were really together.  So why hadn't Brooke
decided what to do about her "date" with Josh and what was she going to tell
her friends?  She leaned forward and kissed Sam washing away all of her doubt
and silencing the voice inside her head telling her to come clean.  She'd
worry about that tomorrow.</p>

<p>"You make me so happy," Sam whispered as she rested her forehead against
Brooke's.  "And I want us to be as close as we possibly can, but I want it
to happen when we both feel it and need it.  And we'll both fall into it
and know that it's the right time."</p>

<p>"Me too, Sam.  I want it to be right for both of us and for the right
reasons."</p>

<p>"And not to break the mood or anything," Sam said smiling.  "But I really
don't want my first time to be in the back seat of my car," she finished
laughing softly.</p>

<p>"First time?"  Brooke furrowed her eyebrows confused.</p>

<p>"Uh yeah, first time.  Still a virgin over here.  I thought you knew that." </p>

<p>"But Jane found that condom in our drawer and it wasn't mine."</p>

<p>"Better safe than sorry?"  Sam tried.</p>

<p>"And you and Harrison never..."  Brooke raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"God no.  I'm going to pretend you never said that," Sam replied shaking
her head.  "Listen it's not a big deal because I know I want it to be with
you.  I just want to wait until it happens naturally.  And by the looks of
things we won't be waiting much longer.  I'm already finding it hard to keep
my hands to myself," Sam added placing her hand on Brooke's knee. She looked
at her watch again.</p>

<p>"We have ten minutes until dinner.  We should head back."  Brooke covered
Sam's hand with her own.</p>

<p>"Can we just sit here for a little while?  I'm not ready to go home yet,"
Brooke said softly.</p>
<p>She really didn't want to go back to the strict confines of the reality
of the social structure either.</p>

<p>"Sure," Sam agreed as Brooke leaned into her closing her eyes.  Sam draped
an arm across Brooke's shoulder and tucked her head under her chin.  She
felt Brooke shift and hug her just above her waist.  Sam ran her fingers
through Brooke's hair in a steady motion and Brooke made it a point to remember
that feeling.  Because after tomorrow she had no idea what was going to happen.
 She just prayed it didn't involve losing Sam.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>A half hour later, Sam and Brooke entered the McQueens kitchen to find
Mike and Jane already at the table.  Sam was smoothing out her shirt and
Brooke was touching up her lip gloss.  Both girls were glowing and a little
disheveled.  They quickly took up their seats across from each other.</p>

<p>"Nice of you to join us," Mike said breaking the silence.</p>

<p>"Sorry Daddy."</p>

<p>"Listen, girls.  Mike and I are very happy that you two are getting along
more now, but if you're going to be late for dinner please call us and let
us know," Jane added.</p>

<p>"Yeah, this is the fifth time in the past two weeks.  Where were you so
late?"  Mike asked.</p>

<p>"Uh..I was working on the paper.  Editing and stuff," Sam said.</p>

<p>"And I had cheerleading and then Nic said she had some errand to run for
her mom.  So I hung around and waited for Sam to finish up so we could ride
home together," Brooke finished and winked at Sam before returning her attention
to her salad.</p>

<p>"Oh Brooke, I almost forgot," Mike said.  "Josh called for you about an
hour ago.  He seemed pretty happy.  Are you two working things out?"</p>

<p>"Uh, I don't think so Dad," Brooke replied uncomfortably.  Sam tried not
to choke on her water and smiled weakly at Brooke across the table.</p>

<p>"Well, he said to call him back when you have a minute.  And for the record,
honey, Jane and I really like Josh.  He's a good kid and he's welcome here
whenever...I mean if you two continue dating," Mike said as Jane smiled at
Brooke.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Brooke replied meekly.  Dinner conitnued in silence.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>At school the next day, the rumor mill was working over time.  Brooke
was in the Novac touching up her makeup when Carmen burst in catching her
off guard.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Brooke?"  Carmen asked as Brooke turned around.</p>

<p>"Is what true?"  Brooke replied feeling her stomach drop.</p>

<p>"You know, you and Josh getting back together."</p>

<p>"What?  Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"It's all over school, Brooke.  I guess I should have known it would have
happened sooner or later.  I mean, you're perfect for each other.  You're
both gorgeous and shallow and so preoccupied with how everyone else thinks
you should act that you piss away the people that really truly care," Carmen
said icily.  "I guess image really <i>is</i> everything.  Funny I would have
thought feelings would rank higher in the real world.  Then again this isn't
reality, Brooke.  If it was you'd think twice before screwing everyone else
over just to perfect your image.  I know deep down you're a good person.
 I just wish you'd let that person surface before it's too late," Carmen
finished with anger and stormed out of the bathroom leaving Brooke standing
there in astonishment.</p>

<p>Brooke stormed out into the hallway with one thing on her mind--find Nic
and kill her.  She spotted at the end of the hall and was immediately on
her way when she saw Sam opening her locker.  She hoped Sam would let her
explain.  Nic was talking to Mary Cherry about something and didn't look
to be going anywhere so Brooke smoothed out her sweater and headed for Sam's
locker.</p>

<p>"Hey, I just heard this crazy rumor-" Brooke started nervously, but Sam
cut her off.</p>

<p>"Brooke, it's okay.  I figured it was just an image thing," Sam said soothingly.
 "Yeah at first I was a little taken back, but then I remembered our conversation
last night and I know you'd never do that to me."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't Sam.  I swear."  <i>Although I should probably tell her I'm
the one that started the rumor.  Come clean, Brooke</i>, she thought.</p>

<p>"I trust you, Brooke.  Completely," Sam replied and it tugged at Brooke's
heart.  She had to tell Sam what was going on.</p>

<p>"Meet me in the supply closet after fifth period.  I really need to explain
things to you, Sam.  You deserve that much from me."</p>

<p>"Okay, see you then," Sam said as she winked at Brooke and took off down
the hall in the opposite direction from Nic.</p>


<p>"Nic, did you tell everyone that Josh and I were back together?"  Brooke
asked angrily as she caught up with Nic.</p>

<p>"Relax B.  The social order has been restored.  The King and Queen are
ready to rule once more," Nic said.</p>

<p>"Yeah well Carmen nearly bit my face off in the Novac."</p>

<p>"Sore loser, hon.  She just wanted what's always been yours and realized
now that she'll never really get it.  Speaking of the King and Queen," Nic
added motioning over Brooke's shoulder and departing.</p>

<p>"Hey babe," Josh said coming up next to Brooke and putting his arm around
her.</p>

<p>"Josh, what are you doing?"  She said shrugging him off.</p>

<p>"Well I heard we were back  together and I thought it was true.  Do you
not want to be back with me, Brooke?"  Josh asked shocked.  Brooke didn't
know what to say.  "Listen let's just go out tomorrow and give it a chance.
 Give me another chance, Brooke," he pleaded.  "And if it doesn't work out
then I won't bother you again."</p>

<p>"Okay Josh.  Pick me up at eight," Brooke replied and walked away towards
class.  Josh was smiling.  Brooke wasn't.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After fifth period, Brooke waited in the supply closet with the lights
off picking at her fingernails.  She was trying calm down the jackhammer
in her chest.  She knew she had to explain to Sam what was going on and she
prayed that Sam would at least understand even if she couldn't forgive her
for it.  The door opened and Brooke could feel the sweat building up on her
palms.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Carmen asked as she got a whiff of vanilla.</p>

<p>"Carmen?"  Brooke replied turning on the light.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in here...with the light off?" Carmen looked at her
quizically.</p>

<p>"Waiting for someone.  What are you doing in here?"</p>

<p>"Just so happens I'm meeting someone in here too."</p>

<p>"Who?" Brooke asked confused.</p>

<p>"Well, who are you meeting in here?"</p>

<p>"Asked you first," Brooke shot back at her.</p>

<p>"None of your business," Carmen replied.  Brooke decided it was now or
never.  Maybe if she told Carmen what was going on things would get better.
 At least they wouldn't be at odds.</p>

<p>"Listen Carmen, about earlier...you've got the completely wrong idea." </p>

<p>"Really?  So you two aren't going out on a date tomorrow night?"</p>

<p>"Well yeah we are, but we're not like going out or anything," Brooke struggled
to explain herself.  "Oh Jesus, why is this so hard.  Just say it Brooke." </p>

<p>"Say what?" Carmen asked.</p>

<p>"I'm dating someone else now."</p>

<p>"Who?" Carmen asked astonished.</p>

<p>"Carmen, nobody knows what I'm about to tell you.  So I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone.  I trust that you won't."</p>

<p>"I won't say a word."</p>

<p>"Well I can't be dating Josh anymore because Sam and I have been going
out for over two months now."</p>

<p>"Yeah right," Carmen said with a laugh.  Then noting the look on Brooke's
face added, "You're serious, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah I am.  That's who I'm meeting in here."</p>

<p>"So why the whole Josh and you rumor and date and all that?"</p>

<p>"You said it earlier, Carmen.  Image is everything.  How do you think
the school would react knowing Brooke McQueen likes girls.  My friends would
disown me," Brooke said sadly.</p>

<p>"Then they're not really your friends," Carmen replied softly.  "Listen,
I'm sorry about what I said earlier."</p>

<p>"Don't be.  It was pretty much dead on anyway."</p>

<p>"Brooke, let me get this out of the way and then we can go back to our
heart to heart. Sam's been one of my best friends since elementary school.
 If you hurt her, I will hunt you down with vengeance that will make Mary
Cherry look like Suzie Homemaker," Carmen said mock sternly wagging her finger
at Brooke.</p>

<p>"I know and I'd never do that...intentionally anyway," Brooke said confusing
herself.  "Like why am I going out with Josh when it's Sam I really love?
 Why can't I just let everything else go and put myself out there for her?
 If Sam finds out I'm going on a date with Josh there's a good chance she'll
walk away from me."</p>

<p>"Brooke, this is a really hard thing," Carmen said knowingly.  "Just follow
your heart.  It'll tell you what to do."</p>

<p>"Thanks Carmen," Brooke said with a smile.  Carmen reached over and squeezed
Brooke's hand nodding just as the door swung open and Sam rushed in.</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm...Carmen?!"</p>

<p>"Hey Sam," Carmen replied pulling her hand back.</p>

<p>"Hey.  Uh, so Brooke um Josh wanted me to tell you he couldn't meet you
in here to makeout because-"</p>

<p>"Sam, it's ok," Brooke said putting her hand on Sam's shoulder.  "I told
her."</p>

<p>"Oh," Sam said nodding then looked at Carmen shyly.  Carmen stepped forward
and hugged Sam fiercly.</p>

<p>"I'm really happy for you Sam," Carmen said pulling away and stepping
back.  "You know, it makes sense, the two of you.  We spotted the attraction
months ago.  It's about damn time you hooked up."  Brooke and Sam laughed
nervously and Brooke slid her arm around Sam's waist for comfort.  It worked.
 The knot in Sam's stomach eased up.  "You are the cutest couple," Carmen
added.</p>

<p>"Carm, you're taking this really well," Sam said.</p>

<p>"Yeah well like I said we already knew it was bound to happen," Carmen
was the one nervous this time.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in here anyway?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Carmen has a makeout date too," Brooke answered with a swagger of her
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"With who?"</p>

<p>"Uh..." Carmen couldn't find her voice in time and seconds later someone
else busted through the door.</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm late, Carmen."</p>

<p>"Lily?!?"  Sam and Brooke screeched simultaneously.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Brooke, what made you tell Carmen?" Sam asked late that night as she
turned off her computer.  She turned around in her chair to look at Brooke
who was lying on her bed.</p>

<p>"I've been wondering that myself," she said putting her book down on the
night table.  "I guess I just needed to tell someone.  And she was in the
middle of ripping in to me about Josh.  I like Carmen.  I think in a way
I felt the need to explain to her that I wasn't trying to hurt her by wanting
Josh back."  Brooke paused.  "If at some point you and I are going to, you
know, go public or whatever it's important that we get along with each other's
friends and stuff.  And even though it's a stretch, I do consider Carmen
and Harrison and Lily to be my friends...sorta.  I don't know what I'm trying
to say," Brooke finished and scrunched her face in confusion as she layed
back against her pillows.</p>

<p>"Do you even realize how totally cute you are when you make that face?"
Sam teased with a grin.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Brooke slid back at Sam as she draped an arm over her eyes.
 Sam walked over and sat next to Brooke.</p>

<p>"I'm serious," she said as she pulled Brooke's arm down and gripped her
hand.  "Every day you find some way to make me love you more.  And you don't
even know you're doing it.  The fact that you want to be able to get along
with my friends means a lot to me.  And they do like you Brooke."</p>

<p>"Yeah , but they hate my friends.  So do you," Brooke replied placing
her free hand on Sam's leg absentmindedly tracing tiny circles with her index
finger.</p>

<p>"Listen, I'm willing to work on at least being civil to them.  But I mean,
don't you think we're gonna have to tell them first before any of this is
even relevant?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're ready for that?"  Brooke questioned Sam looking her
in the eye.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Sam said looking down at their joined hands.  "Are you?" </p>

<p>"I don't know.  Telling Carmen was a big step though.  Speaking of which,
did you find out what was up with her and Lily?"  Brooke asked slyly.</p>

<p>"I did.  Ever since Josh they've been hanging out a lot and they're using
Miss Glass' experiment as an excuse to see what's really going on between
them," Sam said smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, Sam," Brooke said sitting up suddenly.  "I totally forgot
about that whole assignment."</p>

<p>"Calm down.  It's not due until next Monday," Sam said.  Brooke leaned
forward into Sam's arms sighing.</p>

<p>"I guess I've had a lot on my mind this week," she whispered.  Brooke
leaned back slightly and kissed Sam slowly.  "Maybe we should work on our
little experiment," she said smirking before leaning in for another kiss. </p>

<p>"Brooke, you know I'd love to," Sam replied breaking the kiss.  "But it's
really late and I'm exhausted.  Not to mention I've got a deadline tomorrow
and I'm still not even done editing," she finished and frowned.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm pretty beat myself," Brooke replied as she layed back down.
 She had changed into her pajamas earlier.</p>

<p>"How 'bout tomorrow night?  We could go out...or stay in and do something,"
Sam suggested with a glint in her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh Sam I'd love to, but after the meet Nic and the girls are doing movie
night.  And I promised I'd go,"  Brooke lied and felt her conscience slap
her in the face.  "I haven't been hanging out with them much so I feel like
I owe it to them."</p>

<p>"That's cool.  I should probably hang with Harrison and Carm and stuff
anyway.  Put in some quality time."</p>

<p>"If you're still up when I get home though..."Brooke started.  Sam got
up and walked to the bathroom.</p>

<p>"If I'm up to it," she shrugged teasingly as she shut the door and winked
at Brooke.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Friday night came like a freight train on a mission.  Both Sam and Brooke
were busy all day long so the time flew by.  Sam slaved over the paper all
morning and afternoon and part into the night and barely got it in by deadline.
 Brooke and the other cheerleaders hosted the pep rally and then headed to
the wrestling meet after school.  The girls met up after in their room as
they were getting ready to go out.  Brooke was in the bathroom applying her
makeup when Sam stepped in to fix her hair.</p>

<p>"Brooke, why are you wearing makeup to movie night?"  Sam asked quizically. </p>

<p>"I always wear makeup," Brooke replied nervously.   "Why are you wearing
leather pants?"</p>

<p>"They're new.  I'm trying them out," Sam said back. "Besides, what you
said about me and Harrison the other day got me thinking.  So I'm gonna see
if maybe tonight he wants to get all naked and sweaty," Sam teased.  Brooke
looked at her in horror.  "Chill, Brooke," Sam said laughing.  "I'll see
you back here tonight for our little date," she said as she kissed Brooke
on the forehead.  "I gotta go pick up Carmen so we can meet Lily at Mr Cluck's
at 8."</p>

<p>"Hey wait," Brooke said wrapping her arms around Sam's waist from behind.
 Sam covered Brooke's hands with her own and turned to look at her.  "I don't
get a kiss goodbye or anything?"</p>

<p>"Didn't want to mess up your lipgloss, B," Sam said raising her eyebrows. </p>

<p>"I've got plenty more," Brooke said leaning in kissing Sam passionately.
 If this was her last time kissing Sam she was going to make it count.  After
a few timeless moments both girls pulled away reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I have to go," Sam said breathlessly easing away slowly.  Brooke just
nodded.  Sam smiled and spoke. "I'll see you later," she laughed happily.
 As she got to the door, Brooke's voice stopped her.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke began and Sam turned expectantly.  "Can I borrow your American
Eagle sweater.  The one with the pocket on the sleeve."</p>

<p>"Sure," Sam said and turned again.  Again Brooke's voice stopped her and
she turned.</p>

<p>"And Sam?"  Brooke said biting her lip.  "I love you."</p>

<p>"Love you too," Sam said grinning.  She waved a small goodbye at a smiling
Brooke and left to pick up Carmen.</p>

<p>Brooke leaned on the counter and stared at herself in the mirror for what
seemed like an eternity.  She couldn't quite figure out what she was doing.
 Two months ago she would have jumped at the chance to get back with Josh.
 Now too much had happened and her feelings had taken an unexpected and pleasantly
suprising turn.  But as much as being with Sam was all she wanted to do,
Brooke was still new at the whole thing.  And she was nervous about how her
friends would react.  People just can't change overnight and neither could
she, but she also couldn't just sit back and let everyone else live her life
for her.  Most importantly, Brooke decided she wouldn't sit back and just
let Sam go.  Tonight she'd make it very clear that she and Josh would never
be more than friends again.  She was with Sam and that's the only place she
wanted to be.</p>


<p>Sam, Carmen, and Harrison were sitting around a table at Mr Cluck's just
like they had been for the past two hours.  Lily had been roped into working
later because someone called in sick.  Around quarter past ten, she finally
slumped down in the chair next to Carmen's.</p>

<p>"Does the phrase slave labor mean anything to you, Lil'?" Harrison said
jokingly.</p>

<p>"Save it, Dennis Miller.  Hey Sam, where's Brooke tonight?"  Lily teetered
to the side and leaned her head on Carmen's shoulder causing Sam to smile. </p>

<p>"Movie night with Satan and Mary Cherry.  Why would I care though?"  Sam
said glancing sideways at Harrison and then back at Lily.  Carmen's brows
furrowed in confusion.  Lily shrugged an apology.</p>

<p>"You sure it's ladies' night, Sam?" Carmen asked.  Hadn't Brooke said
she was going out with Josh?</p>

<p>"That's what she told me."  Maybe she really did come clean to Sam and
changed her mind, Carmen thought.</p>

<p>"So what's the what, guys?" Lily asked.  "Can we please get out of here
before I end up working overnight."</p>

<p>"Sure," Sam said grabbing her keys.  "Where to?"</p>

<p>"Well I was thinking we could hit the cd store and do a little music listening,"
 Harrison replied.  "And then we could get coffee and talk about Sam's new
girlfriend," he added with a smirk.  Sam scowled and kicked Lily under the
table.</p>
<p>"Ow! What was that for?"  Lily said sitting up straight.</p>

<p>"You guys promised not to say anything."</p>

<p>"They didn't, Sam.  How long have I known you?"  Harrison asked rhetorically.
 "Too long not to notice what was going on.  You and Brooke in bio were like
a preview from Skinemax."  Sam just blushed.</p>

<p>"Okay kids, let's get outta here before any more of my haunting life secrets
are brought into the light," Sam said rising.</p>

<p>"Yeah, or anyone else's," Carmen added winking at Lily.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>At the movie theater across the street from Spanky's CDs, Brooke and Josh
were heading out into the street.  Brooke was amazed at how much fun she
was having just hanging out with Josh.  She realized it was because there
was no pressure.  They were just two friends hanging out on Friday night.
 There were no expectations...at least on Brooke's part.  As they hit the
sidewalk, Josh took Brooke's hand in his own.  Brooke stopped and slid her
hand free.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Brooke?  I thought you were having fun?"  Josh asked frustrated. </p>

<p>"I was...I am having fun Joshy."</p>

<p>"Then what's the deal?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  Everything's really confusing right now," Brooke said
running her hands through her hair.</p>

<p>"How is it confusing?  I love you  Brooke.  I miss you and I want to be
with you.  You mean everything to me," Josh said stepping forward taking
Brooke's face in his hands and pulling her towards him.</p>



<p>Sam and the gang had parked and were heading around the corner laughing
at something Harrison had said when Sam stopped short.  She couldn't believe
what she was seeing across the street.  Brooke, who was supposed to be at
Nic's, was about an inch away from liplocking with Josh Ford...her supposed
ex.  Sam felt a knot forming in her stomach and warm tears stinging in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"I have to go you guys," she said turning and running away.  All three
of her friends stood there dumbfounded until Carmen spotted the trouble.
 She bumped Harrison and Lily with her arms and pointed across the street. </p>

<p>"Oh shit," Harrison said quietly.  "You guys hang out and stuff.  I gotta
go find Sammy."  With that Harrison took off in Sam's direction.  Lily and
Carmen proceeded to Spanky's for some much needed coffee and discussion,
but not before witnessing Brooke push Josh away.</p>


<p>"Josh, I can't," Brooke said pulling her lips from his and slightly pushing
him off of her.  "I'm sorry.  I just can't," she said feeling warm tears
slipping down her cheeks.  "You and I can't be anything more than friends.
 I'll always love you Josh, but not in that way."</p>

<p>"Brooke, why?  Are you seeing someone else?"  Josh asked fighting back
tears of his own.  Brooke paused and looked down guiltily.  "You are.  Who?" </p>

<p>"Josh, I'm so sorry.  I can't do this right now," Brooke said walking
away hugging herself in Sam's sweater leaving Josh in the middle of the sidewalk
confused and angry.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Luckily, Harrison booked ass and saw that Sam's car was still in it's parking
spot.  And Sam was sitting on the hood with her head in her hands.  Harrison
walked slowly over to her and gingerly took a seat next to her.</p>

<p>"Hope our big asses don't dent this thing," he tried with a smile.  Sam
looked over at him, laughed slightly, and then proceeded to cry.  Harrison
put his arm around her and pulled her towards him.  "I know," he said softly. </p>

<p>"I just don't understand," Sam said quietly.  "She said she was going
to Nicole's.  She said she loved me."</p>

<p>"I don't really know what to say, Sam.  I mean, I know what it's like
to be in love with Brooke McQueen  and most of the time it's no walk in the
park.  But for some reason everyday it keeps happening."  Sam looked up at
him, drying her eyes.</p>

<p>"Harrison, I am so sorry."</p>

<p>"Don't be.  I got over that a while ago."  He paused looking out into
the distance.  "You fell pretty hard for her, huh?"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Sam answered.</p>

<p>"I really thought you'd hate her forever."</p>

<p>"So did I.  But somewhere along the line I got to know her.  Underneath
it all she's an amazing person.  We've got a lot more in common than I ever
thought we could," Sam said.  Harrison nodded.</p>

<p>"Maybe there's an explanation, Sam," he said shrugging.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I can just imagine," Sam said dismissing him.</p>

<p>"Do yourself a favor, Sam, and don't jump to conclusions.  If Brooke loves
you as much as she seems to then she'll tell you what happened.  And that's
how you'll know you and her are for real."</p>

<p>"How do you figure?"</p>

<p>"Honesty and truth.  If she's willing to risk losing you in order to be
honest then she's the real thing.  She doesn't want any secrets between you.
 She's trying to right her wrong."</p>

<p>"And if not?"</p>

<p>"If not and she tries to forget it then she's planning on basing your
relationship on a lie.  And what else is she gonna do to you."  He paused
to look at her. "I've seen the way she looks at you, Sam.  I always wished
she looked at me that way."</p>

<p>"How do you know all this, Harrison?"</p>

<p>"I spent the better half of my life in love with Brooke.  There's not
much I don't pick up on," he said with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Listen Harrison, thank you for being so cool with all of this.  It means
a lot.  And Brooke really wants to try and all be able to hang out...I mean,
if we're even still together after tonight."</p>

<p>"Do me a favor, Sam.  Just let her explain.  She's not the type of person
to hurt anyone intentionally."  Harrison squeezed Sam's shoulder and smiled.
 "And if you guys ever need anyone to hold the video camera..."he added,
but was cut off by Sam's right hook into his gut.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Harrison.  Hey did you ever notice trying to pin down a single
concrete reason for loving Brooke..."</p>

<p>"Was virtually impossible?  Yeah.  Don't bother Sam.  There's just something
about her."  They slid off the car.  "Can you drop me off at home?"</p>

<p>"You don't wanna go hang with Carmen and Lily?"</p>

<p>"They've got their own stuff to figure out.  Besides I gotta get a leg
up on my experiment," he said opening the passenger side door.</p>

<p>"Who are you using as your specimen?" Sam said starting the engine.</p>

<p>"Ever see that show with the three sisters that are witches?"</p>

<p>"God Harrison.  Try not to hurt yourself," Sam replied laughing and pulling
away from the curb.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Sam returned home half exhausted, half anticipating a not so pleasant
confrontation. Maybe Brooke really was going back to Josh.  He was cute and
popular.  He was the perfect compliment to Brooke.  Mr. And Mrs. Apple Pie.
 But if Harrison said to give her a chance then she would.  Sam thought he
would have been pissed considering their history, but he seemed to want them
to be happy.  Sam realized how cool her friends were then.  She was lucky
they weren't judgmental at all.</p>

<p>Sam entered her room to find Brooke sitting on the edge of her bed.  She
looked up as Sam came in.  Her eyes were bloodshot and red around the edges. </p>

<p>"You're home early," Sam said dropping her keys on her desk and untucking
her shirt.</p>

<p>"You too," Brooke replied.  Sam turned with her back facing Brooke and
unbuttoned her shirt and adjusted the straps of her tank top.  Before she
knew it Brooke had closed the distance between them and had spun Sam around
to face her.  Brooke slid her hands over Sam's shoulders and the shirt dropped
to the floor softly.  Sam tilted her head down slightly letting her hair
spill onto her face.  Brooke brushed Sam's hair out of her face and rested
her hands on either side.  She drew Sam into a passionate kiss.  One that
was just the beginning.</p>

<p>Sam's mind was telling her body to stop, but it wasn't working.  Screw
the talking.  Maybe they just needed a little action.  Some hormones flowing
to draw them together.  The voice inside her looking for an explanation shut
up and gave in to the light kisses Brooke was planting all over Sam's face.
 Suddenly Brooke stopped and her hands dropped to her sides.  She looked
about ready to collapse, but held Sam's gaze.</p>

<p>"I went out with Josh tonight.  He tried to kiss me, but I backed away.
 I told him it was over, that we could only be friends because there was
someone else.  I'm sorry I lied to you Sam.  It'll never happen again."</p>

<p>Sam opened her mouth to reply but shut it instead.  Harrison was right.
 As far as Brooke knew Sam had no idea what she did, but she chose to tell
her anyway instead of hiding it.  Sam felt something pulling her to Brooke
and she knew it was time.  She needed to know for sure that what was happening
between them was real.  Sam bit her lip and pulled her sweater over Brooke's
head, tossing it on the floor.</p>

<p>"I forgive you," Sam whispered stepping closer to Brooke, wrapping her
arms around her, feeling skin against skin.</p>

<p>"No more secrets, Sam.  I swear," Brooke mumbled between kisses.  She
needed to prove to Sam that she was serious, to reassure her they really
were together.  Clothes made their way into small piles on the floor and
echoed "I love you"s were the only sounds heard for the next few hours.</p>

<p>After they were both certain that their relationship certainly was reality,
they lay facing each other.  They were close enough to be warmed by the other's
body heat, but the only things touching were their tangled legs.  Clothes
had since been put back on for safety reasons.  Brooke put Sam's sweater
back on too.</p>

<p>"I'm never getting that back, am I?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"All night long, I kept smelling you on myself.  It reminded me of how
much I wanted to be with you every second I was away from you."  She paused.
 "It made me feel safe.  So no you're not."  Brooke smiled hugging herself. </p>

<p>"So, uh...how did this compare to your first?"  Sam asked the question
burning inside of her.</p>

<p>"This was my first, Sam."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Josh and I had sex.  You're the first person I've ever made love with.
 This, right here, lying here talking with you is the best part.  Feeling
connected to you on a deeper level is something I'd take over sex on any
day of the week," Brooke replied inching forward kissing Sam softly.  "About
tonight..."</p>

<p>"Forget it, Brooke.  I'm not going to say I understand what you're going
through with your friends and all that, but I do know that I trust you.
I know you'd never hurt me.  It's the past so let's leave it there."  Sam
placed her hand on the curve of Brooke's hip and shifted closer.  "You never
answered my question."</p>

<p>"Do I even have to?" Brooke asked.  "I'm surprised we didn't wake Dad
and Jane up," Brooke said with remembrance in her eyes.</p>

<p>"They're clear across the house from us."</p>

<p>"No kidding," Brooke replied raising an eyebrow.  "Need I say more?" </p>

<p>Both girls giggled briefly.  In between kisses, they stayed up most of
the night talking.  They fell asleep just after the sun came up nestled safely
in each other's arms.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Monday morning came too soon.  Sam was pleased that the latest issue of
the Zapruder was hungrily being devoured by the students at Kennedy High.
 It was probably that expose about the actual ingredients in Vera Krupps
meat loaf.   Sam was leaning against her locker reading through the paper,
when Harrison showed up next to her and popped his locker open.</p>

<p>"Great issue, Sammy."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Harrison."</p>

<p>"Everything copacetic with Brooke?"</p>

<p>"You could say that," Sam said blushing.</p>

<p>"Good because Carmen told me that her and Lily saw Brooke pushing Josh
away Friday night.  So technically nothing really happened," Harrison said
closing his locker.  "How'd your BioGlass experiment come out?"</p>

<p>"Let's just say there's a first time for everything, Harrison," Sam said
smirking.</p>

<p>"God, why couldn't I have been there," Harrison said banging his head
against his locker.</p>

<p>"Oh stop it.  We'll invite you over next time.  Maybe even cast you in
a starring role."</p>

<p>"Really?"  Harrison asked hopeful.</p>

<p>"No," Sam replied flatly.  "What about your experiment?"</p>

<p>"What can I say?  Three chicks in one night.  I'm slick like John Travolta
in Saturday Night Fever," Harrison replied fake slicking his hair back.</p>

<p>"C'mon Romeo.  We're gonna be late for class."</p>


<p>Sam sauntered into Bio class smiling, blushing, and glowing.  When she
spotted Brooke, her heart rate sped up and her face felt hot and flushed.
 Sam sat down quietly and started chewing on her pen cap.  Brooke finished
giggling at something Nic said and turned around.  When she looked at Sam
it was like looking in a mirror.  Brooke was as red as a fire truck.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke said smiling.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam said back.</p>

<p>"Guess who Mary Cherry did her paper on."</p>

<p>"Do I even want to know?" Sam said turning to look at Mary Cherry who
was grinning like a killer klown.</p>

<p>"Harrison,"  Brooke said laughing.</p>

<p>"Hear that Harrison?  You've got a new stalker," Sam said half turning.
 Mary Cherry looked over at Harrison and gave him a little wave.</p>

<p>"Hey Joe," She said winking.  Harrison put his head down on his desk.</p>

<p>"SD did his on Missy Elliot.  Nic's was Brad Pitt of course," Brooke catalogued. </p>

<p>"Carm and Lily did each other I think," Sam whispered then realized how
that sounded and joined Brooke in laughing.  "Harrison's paper was on the
Charmed sisters.  And you and I...well."</p>

<p>"Yeah.  So that leaves Josh.  And I really don't want to know.  It's probably
eight pages on how much of a bitch I am," Brooke said sadly.</p>

<p>"Hey don't sweat it.  He'll get over it at some point.  It's not like
he couldn't get another girlfriend if he wanted to."</p>

<p>"You applying for the position, Sammy?"  Brooke asked.</p>

<p>"No thanks.  He's not blond enough for me.  Besides, I'm totally in love
at the moment anyway," Sam added leaning closer to Brooke.</p>

<p>"All right, kids.  You'll be glad to know that I'm in a rather happy mood
myself this morning," Miss Glass said gliding to the front of the classroom.
 "I was pleasantly surprised that after my Facts of Life marathon, E! Entertainment
television aired the Facts of Life : E True Hollywood Story.  Who knew that
Mrs. Garrett was such a loose cannon," she said laughing.</p>

<p>"Now I take it you've all got papers for me?"  Everyone nodded.  "Excellent.
 I trust you all had some fun this weekend.  Some more than others I see,"
she said glancing at Josh who was frowning.  "Now a show of hands.  Which
of you concluded hormones?"  Everyone raised their hands with the exception
of Brooke and Sam.  Even Carmen and Lily.</p>

<p>"And you two?"  Bobbi Glass questioned.  "You're gonna tell me it's emotional,
right?  Enlighten the class as to what you have figured out that the rest
of us haven't."</p>

<p>"I think I speak for Brooke also when I say that each of our experiments
were fueled by a psychological need for closeness.  It was less of a physical
draw and more of an emotional connection validated by physical actions,"
Sam concluded.</p>

<p>"However we also realized that hormones of some sort are resposible for
attraction in the first place, but once connected on a higher level give
way to a deeper more personal force," Brooke finished smiling as Sam nodded. </p>

<p>"Excellent, girls.  I believe it to be a load of crap, but you've explained
yourselves well," Miss Glass replied in disbelief.  "Now if you'll all pass
your papers in.  My subscription to the Spice Channel was revoked by the
school board and I've got some catching up to do."  With that Bobbi Glass
collected the papers and the bell to dismiss class wasn't far behind.<font size="4"></font></p>
<p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p><font size="4"></font>"Gee Spam, I'd love to meet the unlucky delinquent
who had to play Clyde to your Bonnie," Nic said harshly as they were all
exiting the classroom.</p>

<p>"You're looking at her, Nic," Brooke said to her amazement.  Nic's mouth
dropped open.  Harrison smiled at Sam who smiled at Brooke who shrugged first
at Nic and then at Sam and then smiled to herself.</p>

<p> "I'll walk you to your next class," Brooke said taking Sam's hand in
her own and sliding out into the hallway.</p>
<p>"Excellent," Harrison said walking with Carmen and Lily who were smiling. </p>

<p>"B?"  Nic said pitifully not knowing what to do.  Josh stood next to her
confused...and in need of a cold shower.</p>

<p>"Bro, that is hot," SD said slapping Josh on the back.  Mary Cherry nodded
coming up beside Nic.</p>

<p>"I think Brooke has finally been dethrowned," Mary Cherry said smiling.
 Nic thought for a minute and then smiled herself.</p>

<p>"I think it's time we found a replacement, Cherry.  Or perhaps we could
go old school and form a triumverate," Nic said motioning to Josh.  Josh
took one look at the two psychos advancing on him and ran screaming down
the hallway.</p>

<p>"Definitely hormones," SD concluded walking down the hall noting that
up in the distance Brooke and Sam were still walking together...still holding
hands...and still surrounded by their friends.</p>
