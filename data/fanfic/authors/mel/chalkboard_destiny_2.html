<!-- Chalkboard Destiny \ Story -->

<p>Liz Parker had been up half the night thinking. Days had turned into weeks
and suddenly she and Isabel had been together for over two months. Liz smiled
at that...she was 'with' Isabel and she had never been happier. The only
problem was that Max still wouldn't talk to her. She had come to terms with
the fact that he wouldn't acknowledge her existence, instead reverting to
staring at her when he thought she didn't see him. But she did. He had
the same piercing eyes as his sister. She wondered if one day he might be
able to forgive her...or at least deal and move on. Mostly, Liz hoped that
Max would talk to Isabel because she knew it was weighing on her girlfriend.
 Isabel tried not to show it, but Liz knew how badly it hurt her that Max
could barely look at her. One day things would get better. Liz prayed that
day would come soon.
</p>
<p>Liz saw the soft sparkle of early morning light creep in through her window.
 A few minutes later she saw the first hints of the sunrise on its way, felt
the yellow warmth begin to enter her room and shed its light on her bed.
 She moved to get up, but strong arms tightened their grip around her waist
and pulled her back into a warm cocoon of blankets and body heat. Liz relaxed
for a moment and smiled, breath hot on her neck. She slowly turned her head
to look at Isabel, still sound asleep eyes closed, mouth half open, breathing
softly. After the first night they were together, Isabel made good on her
promise and never ran from Liz again. Liz never woke up unexpectedly alone
again. She gently extricated herself from the vice grip Isabel had laid
on her body and quietly opened the window to escape onto the roof.</p>

<p>Isabel Evans was feeling warm, very very warm. What felt like only a
moment later, she wasn't so warm anymore. She reached out to pull Liz closer
to her, but her arms fell onto an empty side of the bed. Isabel woke with
a start, sitting up quickly. It was still fairly dim outside...the clock
said it was too early to be up for school. She squinted in the faint light
and couldn't see Liz anywhere in the room. Throwing off the covers, she
ran a hand through her tousled hair and climbed out of bed. She pulled a
blanket over her tank top and pajama pants, making sure it was tight around
her. She ducked her head into the bathroom and whispered Liz's name only
to hear the silence answer her back. Isabel noted the bedroom door was still
locked from the inside when she felt a slight breeze enter the room. She
quickly turned her attention to the window which she realized was half open.
 Something inside of Isabel stilled, a calm that had created itself for and
to be contained only in Liz Parker's presence. It was a feeling Isabel had
come to know, something she desperately needed...something she was thankful
for every second of every day.</p>

<p>Isabel ducked through the open window so softly, Liz didn't even hear
her. Isabel smiled at the picture of Liz sitting quietly on the wall, knees
hugged to her chest, sweet colors of the rising sun surrounding her like
a glow. There was a chill in the cool morning air, but by the late morning
the scorching Roswell sun would make sure everyone was warm. Isabel hugged
the blanket closer to herself as she shuffled across the rooftop, blinking
away the sleep as the light penetrated her eyes. Liz finally heard Isabel
approaching her as she got closer, but didn't make an effort to move in the
slightest. She ran her hands up her bare arms feeling the cold air nip at
her skin. She felt Isabel's warmth creeping at her back as the tall girl
straddled the wall behind her and eased herself down slowly. A moment later
she felt Isabel's arms go around her followed by the softness of her favorite
blanket.</p>

<p>"For a minute there I thought maybe you'd been abducted," Isabel teased
as Liz leaned back in her embrace, her hands finding Isabel's own. "You
know if you're going to insist that you dress like me, you could at least
remember to grab a blanket. You're freezing."</p>

<p>"Not anymore," Liz shook her head. "Besides, I knew you'd find me."
Her body relaxed as Isabel held her tighter and kissed the top of her head.
</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here anyway?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for you," Liz answered quietly. "You've shared so much with
me these past months and I just wanted to share something with you. You
don't know how many mornings I've come out here by myself just watching the
sun come up wishing that one day I'd have someone out here with me." She
paused and tilted her head to place a sweet kiss on Isabel's lips. "Finally
my wish came true," she whispered pulling away. Isabel nodded slowly, a
smile pulling at the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Isabel Evans blushing," Liz declared. "I never thought I'd see the day."
</p>

<p>"Only for you, Liz," Isabel whispered in her ear leaning in, hair spilling
forward over the both of them. "Only for you," she said once more before
capturing Liz's lips in a searing kiss that left both girls breathless.
They snuggled closer as the sun crept up enjoying the closeness that they
had come to realize they only knew with each other.</p>

<p>"I think I should tell Maria," Liz started after a few minutes of silence,
"before she hears it from someone else." She turned her head slightly to
see Isabel staring off into the distance.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's probably a good idea," Isabel replied turning to kiss Liz
on the forehead. "Who gets to tell Alex?" She breathed against Liz's hair.
</p>

<p>"I hadn't even thought of that," Liz admitted. "You want to tell him?"
</p>

<p>"I feel like I should."</p>

<p>"It's not going to be easy."</p>

<p>"You think telling Maria is going to be easy?" Isabel asked with a laugh.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Liz showed up at Maria's house that morning just in time to catch Sheriff
Valenti on his way out. They exchanged awkward greetings and went on their
separate ways. Once Liz found her way to Maria's room, she sat on the edge
of the bed and picked at her fingernails. A few minutes later, Maria emerged
from the shower in nothing but a towel.</p>
<p>"Hey," Maria said as she started drying her auburn locks.</p>

<p>"Hey," Liz replied. She fidgeted nervously.</p>

<p>"What's up, Lizzie?" Maria dropped the towel and started dressing. This
was normal, for them to change in front of each other. And Liz wasn't even
attracted to Maria...they were practically sisters. But she was a little
scared that after she told Maria about her budding romance things would get
awkward. Liz looked at her shoes. Then looked back up when Maria put a
hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have to tell you something."</p>

<p>"It sounds serious."</p>

<p>"It is," Liz said as she got up and started pacing.</p>

<p>"Are you pregnant?" Maria asked, her eyes wide. Liz stopped in her tracks
and almost laughed.</p>

<p>"No, I'm definitely not pregnant, Maria."</p>

<p>"Did you sleep with Michael?" She asked, eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>"Ew, no. Maria, you know I wouldn't do that," Liz replied trying to muster
up the courage to say what she had come over to say.</p>

<p>"What do you mean <i>ew</i>?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You just <i>ewed</i> my boyfriend."</p>

<p>"Jesus, Maria. If you'd let me tell you what I have to say you'll realize
why I said that," Liz said running a hand through her dark hair.</p>

<p>"Well, spit it out already," Maria said becoming impatient.</p>

<p>"I'm seeing someone...have been for a couple months," Liz breathed with
relief that it was finally out.</p>

<p>"That's so great," Maria got up and hugged her friend tightly. "It's
about time you moved on from the alien drama that is Max Evans. Wait, why
haven't you told me before this?" She asked pulling away.</p>

<p>"See that's the thing. I haven't really escaped the alien drama, Maria."
</p>

<p>"You lost me. Because you're not sleeping with Michael. And Max and
Tess are like always together holding hands and being vomit worthy. So..."
 Maria pondered for a moment. Liz waited for her to do the math, but decided
it should come from her mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh my God. There's a new alien in Roswell?" Maria screeched before Liz
could get a word out.</p>

<p>"No, Maria. Calm down," Liz said putting a hand up. "It's Isabel."</p>

<p>"Isabel Evans?!"</p>

<p>"Do you know another Isabel that happens to be from a universe far, far
away?" Liz asked waiting for Maria to start breathing again.</p>

<p>"That is so fucked up, Liz," Maria said once the blood returned to her
body.</p>

<p>"What?" Liz said startled and surprised.</p>

<p>"How could you do that to Max?" Maria asked harshly, stepping back when
Liz moved forward. "More importantly, how could you do that to Alex?"</p>

<p>"This isn't about Max...or Alex, Maria," Liz answered, blinking back tears.
</p>

<p>"What's it about then?"</p>

<p>"Right now it's about me and you. It's about me trying to explain this
to you if you'll listen," Liz said wiping at her eyes with the sleeve of
her sweater. When Maria was silent, Liz continued. "Isabel and I have this
connection that I can't seem to put into words. God knows, I've tried.
I had to give Max up to Tess, you know that."</p>

<p>"So this is your consellation prize?" Maria accused, her voice hard.</p>

<p>"No, what I have with Isabel is so much deeper than what I had with Max.
 When I'm with her I feel important, somehow whole. Something I never felt
with Max. With him I always felt like a puzzle piece trying to cram itself
into the wrong spot," Liz said trying to hold her ground, but feeling her
legs start to get weak with sadness. Maria just stood there, silent.</p>

<p>"Maria, you're my best friend in the world. Say something, please," Liz
pleaded.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to say? Huh?" Maria replied with anger. "We never
keep secrets, Liz, never. And this is one major secret. God," she said
pinching the bridge of her nose in frustration.</p>

<p>"Maria, I'm so happy with her," Liz said, trying to make her understand.
</p>

<p>"Good for you, but what about everyone else?" Maria said grabbing her
jacket and walking out of her own house, leaving Liz standing in front of
the vanity mirror to take a good look at herself. After drying her eyes
for the hundredth time, she dragged herself to school hoping to find comfort,
or at least distraction, in her classes.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alex was sitting on the steps in front of his house tooling on his guitar
when Isabel began trekking up the walkway. When he noticed her, he put down
the guitar and stood up pulling his shirt down nervously over his oversized
pants. She was smiling nervously, herself, but all Alex saw was that great
big Isabel Evans smile coming towards him. As far as he was concerned, she
was pure light.</p>

<p>"Isabel, what are you doing here?" He asked. "At seven o'clock in the
morning, no less. I'm not complaining or anything," he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"We need to talk, Alex," she said, the smiling sliding off of her face.
</p>

<p>"Okay, about what?" He asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I have to tell you something that you might not necessarily like."</p>

<p>"Isabel, you already broke up with me. So trust me when I tell you it
can't be any worse than that," Alex said, leaning the guitar against the
front of the house. "Wait a second, is this about you and Liz because I..."
</p>

<p>"What?!" Isabel said shocked. "Liz and I what?" She asked.</p>

<p>"Liz and you being a couple," Alex answered bluntly. He smiled.</p>

<p>"Why are you smiling?"</p>

<p>"You're so cute when you're flustered," he answered, touching her face
for a second. Isabel let him. "I'm touched, really, that you thought it
was something you needed to share with me. You know, like a courtesy."
He let his hand fall away.</p>

<p>"You're not mad?" She asked, sticking her hands in the pockets of her
leather jacket.</p>

<p>"No, Isabel. I'm not mad. After I found out, it sort of hit me a little
hard. But I got over it. I like being your friend, Is. I'd rather be your
friend than not have you in my life at all. And besides, we were a wrong
fit right from the start." Alex just stood there smiling and Isabel wanted
to cry. Instead, she walked forward and hugged him, feeling his arms go
around her and squeeze her tightly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Alex," she said quietly before stepping back. "How <i>did</i>
 you find out, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Are you kidding? You two are so completely obvious. And I haven't seen
Liz this happy since we were five and she got the Barbie dream house she
asked for for Christmas," he replied. "I put two and two together and figured
with all the time she was spending with you that something must be up."</p>

<p>"We're really obvious?" She asked getting self-conscious.</p>

<p>"Not really," he said. "I just pay a little more attention to you than
everyone else, I guess."</p>

<p>"Come on, I'll walk you to school," Isabel said, winking. "You can stare
at me the whole way if you want," she added with a sly grin.</p>

<p>"I promise I won't tell Liz," he said fastening his backpack, and raising
his eyebrows. "Seriously, Isabel. Be careful with her. She acts tough,
but I know she isn't. Don't hurt her."</p>

<p>"Not a chance of that happening, Alex. Don't worry," Isabel replied sincerely.
 She had no idea she was being watched.</p>

<hr>

<p>After the bell to let out school had sounded, Isabel and Alex were walking
out of last period in search of Maria. Isabel had gotten worried when she
realized Liz hadn't showed up at all for school. She figured Maria would
know what happened. It didn't even dawn on her that the reason Liz might
be absent was because her meeting with Maria hadn't gone as well as hers
did with Alex. She spotted Maria and Michael obviously arguing about something
right before he slammed his fist into a locker and walked off. Isabel tugged
on Alex's sleeve and made her way to where Maria was throwing things around
in her locker.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" She asked the other girl. Alex tried to put
a hand on Maria's shoulder, but she flinched and shook it off.</p>

<p>"None of your business," Maria replied through clenched teeth. She squeezed
some drops of one of her liquid herbs into her mouth and tried to breathe.
</p>

<p>"Okay, well do you know where Liz is?" Isabel asked. She was answered
with the slam of Maria's locker.</p>

<p>"Maria?" Alex said softly, confused. He went to touch her again, but
she brought a hand up to ward him off.</p>

<p>"I assumed she was with you," Maria said turning her attention to Isabel
whose jaw was beginning to clench. "She's not my girlfriend. Maybe you
should keep better tabs."</p>

<p>"She told you," Isabel replied, more of a statement than a question.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," Maria said, placing a well manicured hand on her hip.
 She looked at Alex, who was calm and then back to Isabel. "Looks like I'm
the last to find out."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" Isabel asked jaggedly. If Liz was in trouble or upset,
she knew she had to go find her.</p>

<p>"I told you I don't know. I took off after she came out with the truth,"
Maria said with a snort. "Sorry, no pun intended. I thought she'd go running
to you for comfort...maybe you two are a little less together than you think.
 But who am I to judge your relationship, right?" Maria said with a forced
smile.</p>

<p>Isabel looked at her for a second and then to Alex. He was looking at
Maria like he had no idea who she was. She checked her watch which read
half past two and took off down the hallway and out into the hot Roswell
sun, hoping to find Liz and attempt to make things better.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with you?" Alex asked Maria after Isabel had left.</p>

<p>"Excuse me? What is wrong with <i>you</i>?" She shot back at him. "Your
best friend just stole your woman from you and you don't even care and you're
asking me what <i>my </i>problem is?"</p>

<p>"Maria, chill out. I'm fine with it. It's okay," he said trying to calm
her down.</p>

<p>"It's not okay," Maria said pointedly, tears forming.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Alex asked, finally being allowed to pull Maria to him.</p>

<p>"Because she's my best friend and I'm the last person she told," she said
into his shirt. "I feel like I don't even know her."</p>

<p>"Did you tell her that?" He asked gently. "This isn't about her and Isabel.
 It's about Liz and you, Maria."</p>

<p>"I just don't want her to feel like she can't tell me stuff. You know
us, Alex, we never keep secrets."</p>

<p>"You should talk to her...calmly. It's just stupid for you two to be
fighting over this," he said, pulling back from her. She nodded and wiped
at her eyes.</p>

<p>"I guess I acted like a big jerk, huh?" She asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yeah you did," he answered. "Come on, let's go. You can talk to Liz
at the Crashdown later and buy me dinner," he added putting his arm around
her shoulders and walking her out.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Roswell sun beat down hard and relentlessly on Liz Parker as she made
her way back from the pod chambers. She needed to be alone and she figured
no one would come there, especially to find her. Her bare arms were hot
and were starting to burn, but she didn't notice. She didn't care. She
felt like she had her insides ripped out by the person she thought she was
closest to. Maria should have understood. Liz hadn't even thought her freaking
out would be a possibility, but she was wrong. She was so wrong and it occurred
to her that maybe some of the things Maria said were right. What about everyone
else? What if Alex freaked out too? Was it worth it to ruin everyone else's
lives just to have Isabel? Yes. Liz thought simply that. No matter what
the cost, she wasn't going to let Isabel go. She had always put everyone
else before herself and this time that wasn't going to happen.</p>

<p>When she got back to the Crashdown, it was nearly five o'clock. She gave
her father some lame excuse about having some big test the next day and locked
herself in her room. Maria was working and she wasn't ready to deal with
her yet. About half way through the evening shift, Liz heard a knock on
her door. She sat up, startled. She hoped it was Isabel and then remembered
she hadn't bothered to call her and explain what happened.</p>

<p>"Liz, it's Maria." A voice said through the locked door. "Can I come
in?" Then she heard the doorknob jiggle. Liz made a two second decision
to get out of there, grabbing her jacket and climbing out the window. She
heard Maria keep knocking as she made her way across the balcony, but by
the time she hit the pavement below it was a distant murmur. She went around
back, snuck inside the restaurant back room and lifted the keys to her Dad's
pickup truck. Five minutes later she found herself outside Isabel's house.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Isabel threw her keys on the table and grabbed a bottle of water before
heading upstairs to her room. She had looked everywhere for Liz and come
up empty handed. She even went to the Crashdown and questioned her father.
 It was almost nine when she got home. She was thankful that Max wasn't
there. She figured he was probably with Tess, but he wouldn't be there to
not look at her anyway. She heard shuffling in her room and busted open
the door to see what was going on.</p>

<p>She opened her door to find Liz playing with one of the candles on her
dresser and she breathed a sigh of relief. Liz turned to look at Isabel,
her eyes puffy and red around the edges. She gave a weak smile before bursting
into tears and walking into Isabel's arms. Isabel held her with all the
strength she had, trying to reassure her that everything would be okay.
She ran her hand over Liz's hair and tightened her grip with every sob.
Eventually, Isabel led them over to her bed to sit down and Liz finally relaxed.
</p>

<p>"I was so worried about you," Isabel said, wiping at Liz's tears.</p>

<p>"I know. I'm sorry," Liz breathed softly. "Maria completely freaked."
</p>

<p>"I know. I saw her. She was less than forthcoming with any info and
she looked about ready to claw my face off."</p>

<p>"And Alex?" Liz asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"He's about to start us a fan club," Isabel replied, smiling. "He already
figured it out. Says you haven't been so happy in a long time," she added
getting serious. "That true?"</p>

<p>"You know the answer to that," Liz said leaning forward to capture Isabel's
lips in a sweet kiss, an affirmation of the love she felt so deeply in her
soul.</p>

<p>"Think she'll come around?" Isabel asked when they parted.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hope so, but she just seemed so angry."</p>

<p>"Yeah I kinda got that impression too."</p>

<p>"She came by my room tonight, but I just didn't know what to say to her.
 So I came here instead," Liz said, shifting closer to Isabel.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did," Isabel replied, bringing a hand up to gently run her
fingers along the side of Liz's face. Liz closed her eyes and leaned into
Isabel's hand.</p>

<p>"I feel so lost when you're not around," she breathed just above a whisper.
</p>

<p>"So do I," Isabel said in return. She leaned in and kissed Liz firm and
heated. Liz was holding onto her, gripping her sweater so tightly her hands
were in fists. Isabel pulled back to look into Liz's eyes and was scared
by the fear and uncertainty that stared back at her. "What is it?" She asked.
</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to deal with all the loss that comes from being with
me, Isabel?" Liz asked, hoping she wouldn't be leaving with a broken heart.
 "I mean, what if Max doesn't ever want to talk to you again? Maybe we're
being selfish."</p>

<p>"Liz, I'm not going to leave you...ever," Isabel replied. "I mean, I'm
not exactly the safest person to be around either. With the alien hunters
and otherworldly enemies I seem to have attracted in the past. I want to
be with you, Liz. No matter what the cost."</p>

<p>"What about Max?" Liz asked.</p>

<p>"He'll get over it. He's probably off with Tess somewhere making babies
or something," Isabel said with a smile. Liz gave a small smile in return
right before attacking Isabel's lips with the thunder of a hundred rain clouds.
</p>

<p>They laid there for the next few hours entangled, enjoying the silence
and each other's heartbeats. Liz drifted into sleep for a while and Isabel
simply watched her and realized how completely lucky she was to have such
an incredible girl in her bed, and more importantly her heart.</p>

<p>Liz stirred and bolted upright. Isabel was immediately at her side.
Liz clung to her in desperation.</p>

<p>"Shh..it's okay. You were dreaming," Isabel said, gently rubbing Liz's
back.</p>

<p>"Someone was there, Isabel. In my head. Someone was there," Liz replied,
shaken.</p>

<p>"What? No, Liz you've just had a long, crappy day," Isabel said. "It
was just a dream, nothing more than that. I'm right here and nothing can
hurt you."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right," Liz said, sitting back. She held Isabel's hands
and squeezed them gently. "I'm a little more than you bargained for, huh?"
 She asked with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Somehow I think I'll manage."</p>

<p>"You better," Liz said and then looked across the room at the clock.
"I better get going. It's late. And my Dad doesn't even know I took the
truck."</p>

<p>"Sure you don't want to stay?" Isabel asked with a sly grin.</p>

<p>"Not tonight, Is. I'm still pretty worn out from last night," Liz replied,
grinning.</p>

<p>"Want me to walk you out?" Isabel asked, both of them getting up.</p>

<p>"I think I can find my way. You should get some sleep. We've both had
pretty long, tiring days," Liz answered, putting on her jacket. Isabel nodded
and moved forward, reaching around Liz's neck to pull her hair out from under
the collar. She rested each of her hands on the sides of Liz's face and
pulled her in for a kiss. Liz slipped her hands around Isabel's hips and
rested them on the small of her back, pulling her closer. After a few endless
moments they pulled apart, still touching forehead to forehead.</p>

<p>"Sure you don't want to stay?" Isabel asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Of course I want to stay, but I'm not going to," Liz replied. She extracted
herself from the embrace and opened the door. "I'll see you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Check. Tomorrow," Isabel replied. "I love you, Liz Parker." They stood
there and smiled at each other for a minute.</p>

<p>"I love you, too," Liz said and exited the room, closing the door behind
her. Isabel flipped off the light and climbed into bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Liz was closing the side door when Max pulled into the driveway. She
walked down the steps, biting her bottom lip. She could either ignore him
staring at her and go home or put an end to all the silence and careful sidestepping.
 When she was certain he was looking right at her, she looked up and stared
him down. He looked away quickly and stepped out of the jeep, closing the
door quietly after he did so. Max was walking past her, when Liz reached
out and grabbed his arm. He froze and looked away.</p>

<p>"Max, I think we should talk," she said, not letting go until he faced
her.</p>

<p>"About what?" He asked, his face neutral.</p>

<p>"Isabel."</p>

<p>"What for?" He asked, confused.</p>

<p>"She's your sister, Max, and you won't even look at her," Liz said, softly.
 "She loves you and she just wants you to talk to her...to work things out."
</p>

<p>"You think this isn't hard for me, Liz?" He asked, leaning closer to her,
anger in his voice quickly turning to pain. "I thought I was going to be
with you forever and now I have to watch you with my sister, the closest
person to me in the world. Do you know what that kind of betrayal feels
like?"</p>

<p>"Max, you two need each other. No matter who she's with. No matter what
I or she's done to you, Isabel is always going to be a part of you and you
can't just cut her off like this," Liz said, placing a hand on his arm and
staring him straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"You have no idea what this is like," he yelled, violently shrugging her
off. "I'm still in love with you, Liz. Sometimes I think I always will
be. And every time I look at her, I see you two together and a part of me
dies. I feel like I'm withering inside and there's nothing I can do to stop
it," he said backing away.</p>

<p>"But you're with Tess."</p>

<p>"Either that or I'm alone," he replied, stepping backwards. "And I really
don't think I could stand being alone right now," he finished and turned
to open the side door. "She's not you, Liz. She never will be."</p>

<p>"Max, please talk to her. Hate me all you want, but don't keep hurting
her like this," Liz said, pleading to his back. Max stood still for a moment.
 Liz could see his shoulders rise and fall in deep breathing, but then he
opened the door and went into the darkness inside never looking back at the
girl that had scarred him forever.</p>

<p>Liz stood there for an endless moment wondering if things would ever go
back to the way they were before. She sort of knew they wouldn't and part
of her was glad. But part of her just wanted Maria to be her best friend
and for all of them to get along like they used to. She walked to the truck
and got in, emotionally drained from the day's events. She banged her hand
on the steering wheel so hard she knew she was going to have a bruise the
next day. She welcomed it, pain that might somehow take her mind of how
fucked up things had gotten in the past weeks.</p>

<p>She was about halfway down the road when a small, dark figure ran out
into the street in front of her. Liz saw a hand raised towards her right
before the she was blinded by a bright, shining light. She went to hit the
brakes, but the truck started shaking and she had lost complete control.
 The wheel jerked to the left sending the truck across the street and down
a wooded embankment where it rolled until it hit a large tree, stopping it's
further movement. The last thing Liz remembered was the face of her attacker,
curled in a satisfied smile and the thought that if she was gone the wedge
in between Max and Isabel would be gone too. The light slowly took over
and she didn't struggle. She gave herself up to it willingly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Isabel stirred, feeling something just wasn't right. Through lidded eyes,
she caught a glimpse of flashing lights penetrating her window. Suddenly
reality took hold of her, ripping her from her peaceful slumber. Sirens
wailed in the distance, but Isabel realized they were coming closer to her.
 She shrugged the covers off of herself and her bare feet hit the floor with
a loud thud. Dragging herself in the direction of the window, of the flashing
lights and loud sirens, she peered through the blinds. A little ways down
the street she could see patrol cars, ambulances, and fire and rescue. She
spotted Valenti pull up and race out of his truck, frantically shaking his
head when he was able to see what had happened.</p>

<p>Isabel grabbed a sweatshirt and sneakers and walked out into the hallway.
 She nearly ran into Max who was dressed in a similar fashion and appeared
to be headed in the same direction as she was. He stopped in his tracks
and looked down, waiting for her to pass in front of him. Isabel opened
her mouth, but shut it just as quickly and hurried outside to see what the
commotion was all about.</p>

<p>Her feet hit the pavement and something inside urged her to run. She
felt a sudden moment of panic, her body getting hot and uncomfortable. Isabel
took off in a sprint towards the cars and flashing lights. Max watched his
sister, suddenly feeling the same way and followed her trying desperately
to keep up. They both arrived at the side of the road at the same time,
Isabel nearly sliding down it herself she was going so fast. Max reached
out and pulled her back, letting go immediately after she had gotten her
footing. Isabel would have turned around and acknowledged that Max had touched
her for the first time in two months, but her eyes were focused on the mess
that laid below them.</p>

<p>"No," Isabel whispered. Then louder, "no, no, no," she continued. Sheriff
Valenti looked up from where he stood next to the mangled remains of the
truck. Isabel could see even from afar that his eyes were wet. "Liz," she
yelled scrambling to get down to where her girlfriend's truck was laying
in shambles.</p>

<p>"Isabel, no," Valenti yelled as he came towards her. He grabbed her around
the waist and tried to push her back from the accident scene up to the top
of the hill. He was shocked at how much force Isabel was putting back on
him, desperately trying to get past him. Valenti locked his arms and picked
her up off the ground carrying her to safety. "Max, a little help here,"
he said still slightly struggling.</p>

<p>Max just continued to stand there like he hadn't heard or seen anything.
 He felt his hands go numb and his knees threatening to buckle.</p>

<p>"Max!" Valenti yelled, commotion still bustling in the background. News
crews were starting to arrive. Neighbors were flooding from their houses.
 Isabel attempted one last time to push past him, but Valenti shoved her
to the ground, finally breaking Max out of his shocked silence.</p>

<p>"Stay here," Valenti commanded looking down at Isabel. Her hands were
starting to shake.</p>

<p>"Is...she..." Max began, his voice unsteady, "down there?" He asked looking
up at Valenti with sad, anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, running a hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"Is she," Max paused, looking at Isabel who was staring over the edge
of the embankment, and then back to Valenti. "Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"We don't know yet, Max. The EMTs are doing all they can, trying to get
her out and up here so they can transport her to the hospital," Valenti answered.
 "Please keep your sister up here while I go back down there and see what's
going on." A young cop came forward like he was going to try and escort
Max and Isabel back from the scene, but Valenti shook his head and waved
him off.</p>

<p>Isabel's eyes went wide and she scrambled back to her feet, but it seemed
that they wouldn't work. She stood frozen, like a statue as Max and Valenti
turned their eyes back to the truck. Valenti ran down the hill to where
the medical technicians were finally pulling Liz from the wreckage. She
was obviously unconscious, bleeding from the head and her clothes torn.
A minute later, the truck started to spark and a small fire began near the
brush.</p>

<p>"Everybody out fast, this car's gonna blow," one of the workers shouted.
 The EMTs quickly strapped Liz down to a gurney and everyone rushed up the
hill as the truck rumbled and shot sparks behind them.</p>

<p>They had just made it up the hill when the truck exploded in a hail of
scrap metal and flames. Max jumped at Isabel, knocking her to the pavement
and covering her body with his. There was another blast and then it became
almost too quiet. Everyone was standing around in awe and shock. Seconds
later the ambulance took off down the street and Sheriff Valenti was helping
Max and Isabel to their feet.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Isabel asked in a faraway voice, not bothering to brush
herself off.</p>

<p>"We don't really know," Valenti answered. "We got a call that someone
heard a crash, saw some kind of really bright light. When we got here this
is what we found."</p>

<p>"Is she going to be okay?" Isabel asked, tears caught in her throat threatening
to spill.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Isabel," he said putting a hand on her shoulder trying
to comfort her. "Max, you going to be okay?" He asked turning his attention
to the boy he knew was still in love with Liz even though he was seeing Tess
who was much like a daughter to Valenti now. Max nodded in response and
Valenti turned to start investigating. Max put a hand out to touch his sister,
but pulled it back at the last second. She looked at him, fear and anger
in her eyes and then spoke steady and firm.</p>

<p>"She said someone was in her head, Max. When she was sleeping, she said
someone had been in her dreams. And I didn't believe her," Isabel said,
hands clenching at her sides.</p>

<p>"You think someone did this to her?" Max asked, confused. "But who?
Why?"</p>

<p>"How many enemies do we have, Max? How many that have been watching us
and know how big a part she is in our lives?"</p>

<p>"Get to the hospital. I'll call Michael and tell him to meet us there.
 Be careful, Is," Max said, turning to run back to the house.</p>

<hr>

<p>By the time Alex got to the hospital, all the aliens were there with the
exception of Tess. They were all sitting in the waiting room, all looking
sullen...even Kyle. Maria was leaning against Michael, sniffling. The only
person missing was Sheriff Valenti who was presumably trying to figure out
what had happened. Alex stuck his hands in the front pocket of his sweatshirt
and gritted his teeth in order to hold back his tears. Liz, Maria, and he
had been best friends since birth and although Maria was always there for
him he had always felt more connected to Liz. When Maria spotted him coming
towards the group, she extricated herself from Michael and walked towards
Alex with weary steps. Her face fell and she started crying only to end
up with his arms around her. She leaned into him, her close friend, closer
to her than any other people in that room.</p>

<p>"How is she?" Alex asked, tightening his hold on Maria.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered between sobs. "They won't tell us anything.
 She's been in there for over two hours."</p>

<p>"How are Mr and Mrs Parker?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Parker's visiting her aunt in Seattle, but she's on the next flight,"
Maria said taking a step back and wiping at her eyes. "Liz's Dad is trying
to get on of the doctors to tell him something...anything."</p>

<p>Alex nodded. "It'll be okay," he said quietly, putting his hand on her
shoulder. Maria nodded back, biting her lip when she felt it start to quiver
again. Alex looked past her and saw Isabel with her head in her hands.
When she looked up, he was surprised to see no tears in her eyes. Instead
her face was hard and set. He knew Isabel, knew she needed to act like it
didn't bother her or it would consume her. He gave her a half smile and
proceeded to take a seat next to her. Maria sat back down next to Michael
and he put an arm around her protectively.</p>

<p>"How you holding up, Isabel?" Alex asked.</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Alex. Fine," she said looking past him, staring at something,
anything other than another human being.</p>

<p>"I know you are," he said placing his hand on her knee for a moment and
smiling encouragingly. Maria shifted away from Michael, a strange look on
her face.</p>

<p>"Wait a second," she began. Everyone took their gazes away from the floor
and all eyes were now on her. "Max, you can heal her, can't you?" She asked.
</p>

<p>"Yeah Maxwell, what are you waiting for? If she dies, it'll be too late,"
Michael interjected, grabbing his girlfriend's hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Michael," Max said his dark eyes shifting to his hands
which he seemed to be trying to rub the skin off of.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you don't know?" Kyle asked, speaking for the first
time and leaning forward in his seat. "It's not like it's the first time
you've saved her, Max."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's such a good idea," Tess said arriving at the hospital
just in time to add her two cents. "With all that's going on. With the
government and who knows who else watching us. It wouldn't be the smartest
move would it Max?" She asked placing a hand on his shoulder, yet still hovering
above him.</p>

<p>"Who the fuck invited her?" Isabel asked standing up straight, towering
over the smaller girl.</p>

<p>"Isabel, if we're in danger so is she," Max explained putting a hand up
between the two girls. Isabel shoved his hand away and stepped closer to
Tess shooting daggers into her clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Isabel, please," Tess said in a soothing voice. "Can we please stop
fighting?"</p>

<p>"I think you should leave," Isabel said through clenched teeth. "Unless
you want to end up in an adjoining room," she threatened. Her right hand
began shaking and her power vibrated through the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly everyone was on their feet, Maria looking down the hallway to
a distraught Mr. Parker being followed by an emergency room doctor. He pulled
his face mask down and wiped at the sweat on his forehead. Maria took a
step forward towards Mr. Parker as the two men arrived in the waiting room.
</p>

<p>"How is she?" Maria asked, eyes hopeful yet scared. Mr. Parker put his
arm around her and pulled her towards him.</p>

<p>"The good news is that she's out of surgery," the doctor began. A sigh
fell over the group. Tess had made a smart move by stepping behind Max and
away from Isabel. "The bad news is that she seems to be in a coma," he finished.
</p>

<p>"Is she going to be okay?" Maria eeked out through tears.</p>

<p>"She's stable at the moment, but we don't know if," he paused. "Or when
she'll wake up. You need to be prepared for it if she never regains full
consciousness because right now that's a very real possibility."</p>

<p>Maria erupted into tears and Mr. Parker could do nothing but hold onto
her tighter. Michael stuck a hand in his back pocket and turned away. Kyle
sat back down and put his face into his hands, his shoulder rising and falling
in tears. Max merely stood there, frozen feeling his world slipping away
and Tess grabbing onto his hand. He clung to her because he could do nothing
else at that moment. Alex felt the damn break and the tears start to flow
and turned to Isabel just in time to see the floor at her feet begin to crack.
 Instinctively he grabbed her hand, and felt a surge of power before his
pulled her into his arms not letting her protest. Isabel gripped the back
of his sweatshirt so tight in her fists he was afraid it would rip right
off of him. She buried her head in his shoulder but she wouldn't cry. She
wouldn't let anyone see her cry, especially Tess.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Mr. Parker had spent a few hours sitting by Liz's bedside, he asked
Maria if she would help him open the restaurant. She agreed and Kyle and
Alex went along to help, leaving just the four aliens alone in the hospital
waiting room. Before she left, Maria hugged Isabel and whispered in her
ear.</p>

<p>"If she wakes up, tell her I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Isabel nodded in response and squeezed the other girl's hand in acknowledgment.
 And then she was alone with the people that were supposed to be her real
family, but whom she felt were the farthest things from her at that point.
 Isabel was just sitting there glaring at Tess across the room. It felt
good to be able to channel her energy into something other than thinking
about Liz. Tess tightened her grip on Max's hand, staring Isabel down and
smiling sweetly. That bitch.</p>

<p>"Listen, we need to figure out what happened tonight," Max said breaking
the silence. "If it has to do with us, then we need to find out why and
who's responsible because we could all be in danger."</p>

<p>"Max is right," Tess agreed.</p>

<p>"But how?" Michael asked. "The only person that seems to know what happened
is Liz and she can't tell us."</p>

<p>"Valenti should be here soon," Max replied. "Maybe he found something
out."</p>

<p>"Are you going to heal her, Max?" Isabel asked after not saying a word
for and endless piece of time. "I mean, we all know you can. And she's
just laying there..." She broke off looking his straight in the eye and waiting
for a response. He looked away from her.</p>

<p>"I think Tess is right," he replied. "There's already too much attention
on us as it is. And maybe healing Liz that day in the Crashdown is what
started all this trouble in the first place."</p>

<p>"You're not sorry you did it, so don't sit here and act like you are,"
Isabel said raising her voice. "I know you still love her, Max. I see it
every time you look at her and you think no one's watching."</p>

<p>"That's not the issue, Isabel," Tess replied for him. Isabel stood up.
</p>

<p>"Max, you better get your little slut out of here before I put a hole
in her face," Isabel warned her feet threatening to take a step forward.</p>

<p>"Just do it, Isabel," Tess countered, standing up and moving towards her.
 "You want to do it so badly then just do it and then it will be done and
we can get past it," she shouted, her eyes afire. Isabel could feel Tess'
heat emanating from her, she was so close. She remembered all the intimate
moments they had shared before Tess had thrown her away like she didn't even
matter. The nostalgia quickly turned to resentment and Isabel could feel
her blood pressure rise.</p>

<p>"That's enough," Max yelled stepping in between his sister and her ex-girlfriend.
 "We need to figure out what happened and what we can do to stop it or help
or whatever."</p>

<p>"And you could put an end to all of your questions if you would just go
in there and heal her, Max," Isabel shot at him, her voice wavering.</p>

<p>"We need to give her a chance to come out of this on her own, Isabel,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Why, Max? Because she's not your girlfriend anymore?" Isabel turned
towards him momentarily forgetting Tess was even in the room. "Because she's
with me, you won't help her? So now I might have taken away her one chance
to survive?"</p>

<p>"I know you think you're the only person in the world with something to
lose right now, but you're not Isabel," Max said, tears forming in his eyes.
 "If she dies, none of us will be the same."</p>

<p>"So save her, Max. What good is fighting the world...what do we have
to tie us here if she's gone?" Isabel said pleading with him.</p>

<p>"And who says that's such a bad thing, Is," Tess interjected. All three
of the others turned to look at her with anger and shock. "If there's nothing
to tie us here, we can go home."</p>

<p>"This is my home," Isabel replied. "If she dies because of me, I'll never
go back to the place you seem so anxious to call home. The place that we
had to crash into another planet to escape."</p>

<p>Valenti showed up then, just in time to halt another extreme confrontation
between Isabel and Tess. The four teenagers looked at him with anxious eyes,
waiting to hear if he had solved the mystery of what had happened to Liz
Parker.</p>

<p>"It's late. You should all be at home getting some rest," he said approaching
the group. "Actually it's morning already."</p>

<p>"Did you find anything out?" Max asked.</p>

<p>"Bits and pieces are all that I got. A few neighbors said they saw a
small figure run in front of the truck right before a bright light made them
turn away. Next thing they knew there was screeching and crashing and the
road was clear," he said. "Funny thing is that there are no skid marks whatsoever."
</p>

<p>"But if someone jumped in front of her car, she would have to slam on
the brakes in order not to hit them," Max observed.</p>

<p>"Unless whatever stepped in front of that truck basically threw it off
the road," Isabel said.</p>

<p>"Meaning?" Valenti asked.</p>

<p>"The bright light," Michael said quietly.</p>

<p>"Who do you know that emits a blinding light out of nowhere?" Isabel asked
nodding.</p>

<p>"Us when we're using our powers," Michael replied.</p>

<p>"You think some sort of," Valenti paused and lowered his voice, "alien
is involved?"</p>

<p>"When Liz woke up last night, she was startled. She kept saying that
someone was in her dreams, in her mind," Isabel said. "Maybe whoever was
in her head was the one who forced her off the road."</p>

<p>"But who?" Tess asked.</p>

<p>"Well someone killed Nasedo," Max replied. "And Nicholas is bent on getting
us to go back to our planet. Seems to me that the possibilities are endless."
</p>

<p>"But why Liz and not one of us?" Isabel asked.</p>

<p>"You said it yourself. If Liz is out of the picture then what's left
to tie us to this planet?" Tess answered looking directly into her deep brown
eyes. "It heightens the chances that we'll return home. Maybe it was your
old boyfriend, Velandra," she added like a dagger sliding into the heart
of the person she still truly loved.</p>

<p>"I'm going to check on Maria," Michael said distracted, ignoring the scene
in front of him. "Call the Crashdown if anything happens," he added and
was gone.</p>

<p>"Max, why don't you and I do some investigative work," Valenti suggested.
</p>

<p>"Good idea. I may have a better idea of what we're looking for," Max
replied. "You two stay here," he said referring to Tess and Isabel. "And
make sure nothing else happens to Liz."</p>

<p>"Max, if you know what's good you'll take her with you," Isabel said.</p>

<p>"Isabel, I don't want you here alone if something or someone tries to
hurt you," Max said putting on his jacket.</p>

<p>"And who's going to protect her from me?" Isabel asked.</p>

<p>"I think I can manage," Tess replied flatly.</p>

<p>"Is, maybe you can try dream walking her," Max suggested. "She may be
able to tell you what happened."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she replied.</p>

<p>"I'll help you, Is. Don't worry," Tess said stepping to her side.</p>

<p>"If you need anything call my cell phone or call the station," Valenti
said and then escorted Max out of the building.</p>

<hr>

<p>Isabel was in the bathroom washing her face when Tess came through the
door and locked it behind her. Tess handed her a paper towel and she accepted
it without looking at the shorter girl.</p>

<p>"This is a public restroom, you know. Someone might get suspicious if
they can't get in," Isabel stated firmly.</p>

<p>"We need to talk," Tess replied.</p>

<p>"When are you going to get it in your warped alien brain that I don't
want to talk to you," Isabel shouted at her. "We have nothing to talk about,
Tess."</p>

<p>"I get that you're still bitter about me and Max, Isabel. But we need
to start working together," Tess said willing Isabel to look at her. Isabel
looked up. Her face was drawn and tired like she hadn't slept in days.</p>

<p>"Bitter?" Isabel shot at her former lover. "My girlfriend is laying in
a coma and you've convinced my brother not to heal her. Maybe you're a little
bitter that he'll never love you the way he loves Liz." Tess stood there
shocked, her eyes growing cold and her face setting in anger.</p>

<p>"Isabel, I'm not in love with Max," Tess replied advancing on her. Isabel
retreated to the wall behind her until she could go no further. Tess braced
her arms on either side of the tall girl and rose on her tiptoes. "Til the
day I die Isabel, I will never stop loving you," she whispered, her voice
thick. "I'm trying to save you. If Max heals her, we will all be in danger
and I can't bear to lose you again."</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'again'?" Isabel asked bracing her hands on the wall
behind her, trying to push further away from Tess, but not wanting to push
past her or somehow unable to move.</p>

<p>"You don't remember what it was like," she said, memories flashing before
her eyes. "Before we came here." Isabel shook her head.</p>

<p>"I was engaged to Max, but I wasn't in love with him. Not there and certainly
not here," Tess said not backing away in the slightest. "Why do you think
I gravitated toward you when I got to Roswell, Isabel? Why do you think
I got involved with you?" She asked. "Because I knew what it was like to
be with you. I remembered your touch, your lips...your heart," she said
reaching up and placing a hand over Isabel's heart. "Even in another galaxy,
your heart always beat just for me, Isabel. You were mine there and when
we fled I lost you somehow in the mess."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" Isabel asked, her voice heavy.</p>

<p>"Because I remember, Isabel. How could I ever forget something so important
to me? You were what I lived for," Tess said leaning in slowly, focused
on Isabel's full lips.</p>

<p>"No," Isabel yelled finally pushing past Tess, flinging the frail girl
into the sinks. "Things are different now, Tess. You will never be what
I live for...never," she said before unlocking the door and beginning to
pull it open.</p>

<p>"Are you going to dream walk her, Isabel?" Tess asked pushing off of the
sinks.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't I?" Isabel slid back at her harshly.</p>

<p>"Because maybe you're afraid of what you'll see inside her mind."</p>

<hr>

<p>Maria had just thrown some plates into the sink at the Crashdown and was
slamming her locker door open and shut when Michael approached her from behind.
</p>

<p>"Did I do something wrong again?" He asked, afraid to touch her.</p>

<p>"What? Michael, no," she replied, turning around and leaning against
the closed locker, clutching a picture of her and Liz in her hands. Michael
looked at it for a second and then into her eyes.</p>

<p>"She's going to be fine, Maria. Max won't let her die," he said honestly,
staring directly at her.</p>

<p>"And what if she's not, Michael?" Maria asked, breaking down. "What if
she dies and the last conversation we had ended with me walking out on her??"
</p>

<p>Michael gathered the sobbing girl into his arms and prayed that Max would
listen to his heart and save the one thing in the universe he knew he cared
about without a doubt.</p>

<hr>

<p>Isabel and Tess sat in the waiting room trying to see which one could
burn a hole through the back of the other's head using just her eyes. Their
power danced in the air consuming oxygen and fighting an unseen battle of
wills and passion. In her peripheral vision, Tess saw a figure come to a
stop just to her left. She saw Isabel raise her eyebrows and was shaken
out of her trance. Turning to her left she saw Kyle standing there, hands
in his pockets and an expectant look on his face.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Kyle?" Tess asked, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"I called him," Isabel replied.</p>

<p>"Why?" Tess said, returning her gaze to the girl sitting across from her.
</p>

<p>"You're leaving," Isabel said flatly. She suddenly felt better than she
had all day.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You.are.leaving," Isabel replied, every word pronounced jaggedly.</p>

<p>"No I'm not," Tess said getting up.</p>

<p>"Yeah you are," Kyle interjected. "Dad wants you home anyway. We're
all meeting at the house."</p>

<p>"What about Isabel?" Tess asked.</p>

<p>"I've got some work to do here," she replied. "Besides, I wouldn't leave
her side for anything," Isabel said fixing her eyes on Tess'.</p>

<p>"C'mon," Kyle said putting an arm across Tess' shoulders steering her
away from Isabel. "We can come back later with everyone else."</p>

<p>Isabel watched them walking away, Tess' steps slow and sluggish. Kyle
turned around for a second and Isabel mouthed a "thank you" getting a nod
and smile in response. She took a deep breath and began moving towards Liz's
room. She had yet to visit her mostly because of Tess' presence, but also
because she was afraid she wouldn't survive having to look at Liz, battered
and broken all because of who Isabel was.</p>

<p>When she got to the door to Liz's room, Isabel stopped. She wanted to
go in, but something was holding her back still. Maybe Tess was right.
Maybe there was something inside Liz's mind that Isabel was afraid to see.
 No, she wouldn't let Tess win. She would never let Tess win. She shook
her head, trying to shake off any doubts she had about her relationship with
Liz, and gently placed her hand on the doorknob. Pressing down and with
a small almost undecernable click, Isabel stepped forward into the structured
crypt that housed the other half of her heart.</p>

<p>Isabel closed the door behind her, before turning around to cast her eyes
upon the figure laying silently in the hospital bed. When she turned her
eyes to look at Liz's seemingly lifeless body, the breathe left her body.
 She looked so small, hooked up to so many machines. Her face was dark and
bruised, her dark hair matted to her forehead and cheeks. She was pale where
the black and blue marks hadn't yet reached, her eyes sunken in. The machines
were the only sound in the room, one with a steady beep, the other helping
Liz to breathe. Isabel felt her heart breaking. She swallowed hard, forcing
herself to move forward until she reached the side of the bed.</p>

<p>Isabel took Liz's hand into her own and was surprised at how cold it was.
 She knew these hands, knew what they felt like crawling across her skin
with an electricity that could short circuit the sun. Isabel felt so unfamiliar,
so helpless holding Liz's cold, frail hand in her own. Lips that no more
than twenty-four hours ago had been pressed against her own were now enclosed
around a breathing tube. Isabel felt her defenses falter and tears sting
her eyes, but she beat them down to her absolute core and promised herself
they would never find their way out. She remembered when the government
had captured Max and in order to get into his head, Isabel needed Liz. Now
she was realizing that Liz didn't enhance Max's energy, she enhanced Isabel's.
 She needed to get into Liz's mind, but this time she was on her own.</p>

<p>Isabel pulled a chair from behind her and sat down. She exhaled softly
and placed her warm lips on Liz's knuckles in a gentle kiss. Then she closed
her eyes and concentrated on Liz. Her eyes. Her scent. The touch of Liz's
bare skin sliding against her own. All the silent moments they had spent
together. All the memories they had shared with each other. And then Isabel
felt herself falling...gliding through a time and space that was undefined.
 Until she ended up in Liz's bed.</p>

<p>Isabel glanced around, startled. She sat up quickly and let her eyes
drift across Liz's bedroom only to find she was alone. Her hands were cold
and the room had a cool, grey tint and feel. Isabel felt a breeze sweep
through her long flowing hair like ice cold fingers. Across the room, she
saw the window to the balcony was only about half way closed, wind blowing
the curtains back in an uneven rhythm.</p>

<p>She rose from the bed, her feet bare, and slowly made her way to the open
window. Slipping out onto the balcony, she was enveloped by a warmth only
rivaled by the feeling of being in Liz's arms. The sun was shining brightly
in her eyes and she held a hand up to block it. An outline formed of a small
girl sitting with her legs hanging over the side of the brick wall. It was
instinct before anything else that told Isabel that Liz was sitting in front
of her and was close to falling.</p>

<p>"Liz," she said stepping forward, arms raising from her sides.</p>

<p>"Isabel," Liz said softly, turning around just enough to see her. "I
was wondering when you'd get here," she said smiling.</p>

<p>"Liz, we have to go," Isabel said hastily, feeling something in the air
that just wasn't right. "Come with me. You're going to fall."</p>

<p>Liz responded by shaking her head slightly and turning back to look at
the sunlight.</p>

<p>"It's so beautiful here, Isabel," she said. "I want to stay here forever.
 Besides, you'd catch me, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Liz, I..." Isabel breathed, her voice thick with emotion. "You can't
stay here. You have to come back with me," she pleaded.</p>

<p>Liz turned around, swinging her feet to land on the concrete floor of
the balcony. She leaned forward slightly, letting her weight fall onto her
hands that were braced on the ledge.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Isabel? It's better this way," Liz said smiling, trying
to make Isabel understand. Isabel shook her head back and forth, biting
her lip. "Yes, Is. It is," Liz reiterated. "I'm not one of you. I never
will be. And as long as I'm around, you will always be in danger. As long
as you stay here and deny the truth, you will never be free."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Isabel shouted. "Who did this to you?"</p>

<p>"Let's not talk about that," Liz replied, her brown eyes turning almost
black. She rose to her feet and advanced on Isabel who was stuck on the
ground where she stood. "I won't be here much longer so why don't we just
enjoy the rest of the time we have."</p>

<p>Liz reached up and traced a delicate outline of Isabel's face, remembering
the touch like she was trying to burn it into her memory. Isabel closed
her eyes, her heart racing faster than she ever thought it could. Liz let
her hands glide down to Isabel's neck in a feather light touch that made
Isabel wonder if Liz was actually there at all.</p>

<p>"You are so incredibly beautiful," Liz breathed softly, clasping her hands
together behind Isabel's neck. "That is something I will never ever forget,"
Liz finished, her voice just above a whisper.</p>

<p>Isabel's resolve fell hard and fast. She opened up her eyes to the sight
of Liz standing in front of her surrounded by an orange light that made her
whole body seem to vibrate with energy, and the tears began falling quick
and relentless. Isabel staggered forward into Liz's arms, holding onto her
like she could save her if she would just hold on tight enough. Liz rose
on her tiptoes to meet Isabel's height and slid one arm over her shoulders
and the other she used to stroke her girlfriend's hair soft and steady.</p>

<p>"Liz, please," Isabel cried. "I can't do this without you."</p>

<p>"Shhh," Liz responded by pushing herself flush up against Isabel, feeling
their hearts beating as one. Isabel sobbed, turning her head and burying
it in the soft crook of Liz's neck.</p>

<p>"I can't..."</p>

<p>"You can, Isabel. And you will," Liz said losing her hand in Isabel's
thick hair.</p>

<p>"No," Isabel insisted, pulling Liz even closer to her.</p>

<p>"Yes," Liz replied, pulling back against Isabel's grip to look in her
eyes but Isabel had them shut tight. "Open your eyes, Isabel. Look at me."
</p>

<p>Isabel resisted at first, but when she felt Liz's soft, warm hands cradling
her face she finally opened them. Liz was looking at her with pure love
that was emanating from the entire expanse of her body. Liz smiled, wiping
the tears from Isabel's face.</p>

<p>"You will be fine," Liz said sternly, gazing into Isabel's eyes with an
intensity that couldn't be denied. "You don't need me, Isabel."</p>

<p>"Yes I do, Liz," Isabel said staring back into the eyes that reflected
her very being.</p>

<p>"No, Isabel, you don't. You've got Max and Michael and Tess. There's
a whole world out there waiting for you, Isabel."</p>

<p>"And I don't want to live in it without you," Isabel replied, gritting
her teeth.</p>

<p>"It just wasn't meant to be, Is," Liz said crying silent tears.</p>

<p>"Please, Liz, don't give up," Isabel pleaded drawing Liz closer to her
once again.</p>

<p>"It's too late for me, Isabel. But it's not too late for you," Liz answered.
 "I love you, Isabel Evans."</p>

<p>"No," Isabel kept repeating, shaking her head. "I won't let you go.
I won't let you give up," she continued, but was silenced by the force of
Liz's lips against her own.</p>

<p>They kissed for what seemed like forever, like they were exploring each
other for the first time all over again. Isabel could taste the saltiness
of their tears mingling with the sweetness of Liz's mouth, hot and moist
against hers. Liz's eyes were shut tight, her hands clutching at Isabel's
shirt with desperation and a longing to stay connected forever. And just
as soon as it started, Isabel felt time shift once again.</p>

<p>Isabel woke with a start, inhaling deeply and loudly. She felt her world
closing in around her and falling out from under her feet. She felt a slight
squeeze being applied by the hand she held in her own, a slight warmth return.
 And she felt a presence behind her that she knew to be Max, hovering above
her. And suddenly, Liz's hand went limp and ice cold and fell away from
her own. Isabel rose with a guttural sound that could only be described
as despair manifesting itself into noise and turned, grabbing Max by the
collar of his leather jacket.</p>

<p>"Don't let her die, Max," she screamed, tears flooding her eyes. "Please..."
She sobbed, letting her head fall onto his chest. As his arms went around
his sister, the machines began beeping faster. He looked up, realizing that
they were losing her.</p>

<p>Max gently pried himself away from Isabel and quickly shut off the machines.
 Isabel heard commotion outside the door, and raised her hand up holding
it closed with her powers. She turned back to Max, who was by Liz's side,
placing his hand on her. He laid one hand on her chest over her heart and
the other on her forehead. He concentrated, feeling Liz's shallow breath
slow down and her body temperature drop. He strained, putting more pressure
and feeling into his hands and a few seconds later, he felt Liz's pulse steady
and her heartbeat quicken.</p>

<p>Liz opened her eyes suddenly and struggled to sit up. Max gently pushed
her back down and fell to his knees by her bedside. The door burst open
as Isabel met Liz's eyes and her hand dropped to her side. Liz reached up
and ripped the breathing tube from her mouth, glad to be able to inhale on
her own. Her lips turned up at the edges in a weak smile, her face still
sore.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she whispered, her eyes fixed on Isabel's. Isabel smiled
back at Liz before falling back into the chair, collapsing and sobbing. She
felt Maria's hand on her shoulder, comforting her and heard her tell Michael
to call Valenti. Seconds later, the doctors rushed in and all was suddenly
blurred in the commotion.</p>


<hr>

<p>Kyle picked up the phone on the first ring and frantically spoke into
the receiver.</p>

<p>"Hello?" He said loudly. "Michael? Yeah...uh huh...oh God," he was saying
as Tess came out of her room. Kyle collapsed on the couch, his head in his
hands.</p>

<p>"Kyle what is it?" Tess asked approaching him. He looked up through tears,
his hands shaking.</p>

<p>"Liz is awake."</p>

<p>"What?" Tess asked surprised. "How?"</p>

<p>"Max."</p>

<p>Tess balled her hands into fists and her clear blue eyes clouded over.
 Kyle's head went back into his hands as she retreated to her room and closed
the door.</p>

<hr>

<p>Liz was sitting up finally. The doctors were gone and her father had
come and gone back to the Crashdown after making sure Liz was in good hands.
 The entire gang, with the exception of Tess and Valenti were surrounding
her. Maria approached her, with tired weary eyes and took hold of her right
hand. She leaned down and kissed Liz on the forehead, Liz closing her eyes
at the touch of Maria's lips. When she pulled back she looked at Liz with
fear and uncertainty of whether or not she was forgiven. Liz squeezed her
hand.</p>

<p>"I know, Maria," Liz said quietly. "I know." Maria nodded in response
and slid back into Michael's arms. Liz's eyes grated over the room until
they fell upon Max who was leaning against the wall in the back.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Max...again," she stated sincerely. He nodded with a slight
smile and ran his hands over his thighs.</p>

<p>"And thank you, Isabel," Liz said quietly, looking into Isabel's deep
eyes. She leaned as far as she could to her left and Isabel met her half
way in a sweet, soft kiss. "I knew you'd find me," she said in a whisper
when they parted. Isabel tightened her grip on Liz's hand.</p>

<p>"I won't ever lose you again," Isabel replied in a solemn promise.</p>

<p>"I hate to break up the love fest," Kyle said, "cuz it's actually really
turning me on."</p>

<p>"Kyle," Maria said, swatting at him.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he apologized. "But seriously, now that our girl is back, isn't
there something we're all wondering?" All eyes looked toward Liz, who was
biting at her bottom lip nervously.</p>

<p>"Liz, what happened?" Isabel asked gently, feeling her discomfort. Liz
took a deep breath and closed her eyes before answering.</p>

<p>"It was Tess."</p>
