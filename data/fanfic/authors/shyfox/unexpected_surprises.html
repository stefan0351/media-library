<p>The dark green van drove slowly down the road that led to the SunnyDale

University dorms. It ambled like a sick cow into a parking spot, then

stopped...chuckling for a moment before the key in the ignition was turned,

and the engine came to a stop with a stuttering halt. As the van door

opened, a man of about average height hopped out of the van...his
greyish-green eyes taking in the quiet atmosphere of the college dorm. He

wasn’t sure why he was surprised by the emptiness of the place...Christmas

was two weeks away, most students would be home, celebrating the holidays

with their families. The college campus was like an old western ghost town,

the only sign of life was an old flyer being pushed along the driveway by

the wind, like a tumble weed in an old western movie. The flyer came to a

stop a few feet from where the man stood, being halted by a drying mud

puddle in the middle of an indent in the pavement. Bending over to examine

it, the man noticed that it was an advertisement for the band "Dingoes ate

my baby". It proclaimed that they would be performing on the advertised

date...September 12, 1999. Three months ago...on this date.</p>

<p>‘Three months ago...today.’ The man reflected silently, not bothering to

pick up the now wet and dirty flyer from it’s resting spot. He looked back

at the deserted dorm building, hoping for any sign of life from the window

into which he had last scene the red-headed girl he had been completely in

love with. When he thought about it now, the fight they had seemed so

stupid. He had felt like he needed to get away from it all...to find
himself
again...and control the wolf within him. He had wanted Willow to go with

him, but she said her place was here...in SunnyDale...with her friends. She

had begged him to stay here with her, but he wouldn’t listen closing his

ears to her pleas as thoughts of what he had done had filled him with
guilt.
I’m back, Willow...and this time I can control the animal within. I know I

can.</p>

<p>With a determined glint in his eyes, he got back in his van, determined to

find what he had left behind.</p>

<p>Oz knocked briskly on the front door of the Rosenberg residence. He had

never felt comfortable whenever he and Willow had been asked to dinner

there, so he wasn’t surprised that he didn’t feel comfortable now, knocking

on the door of the home of the woman he had broken up with. He didn’t have

much time to think however, as the door was abruptly opened and Sheila

Rosenberg stood in the doorway, silhouetted by the light in the
background.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" The question was icy and shrill, and it took Oz

by complete surprise at the pure venom in the woman’s voice. He had thought

Mrs. Rosenberg had been starting to warm up to him there near the end...but

he supposed he could be wrong, he had certainly been wrong
before.</p>

<p>"Uh...I’m sorry for interrupting whatever you were doing, Mrs. Rosenberg,

but I’m looking for Willow and since she wasn’t at the dorm...I thought she

might be here." Oz stated, simply, looking past Willow’s mother to see if
he
could spot Willow behind her. It was altogether possible Willow had told
her
mother what had happened between them, and was using her mother as a shield

against him.</p>

<p>Sheila Rosenberg stared intently at the young man her daughter had been

dating and thought about the news her daughter had told her not so long
ago.
Willow had also informed her that she hadn’t told Oz. Well, maybe it was up

to her to tell the young man about it, and get him to help Willow to do the

right thing. "Come on in...Oz was it?" Sheila said, leading the bemused

guitar player into the house.<BR></p>

<p>"You hung those lights really pretty." Willow said from her reclined
position, as she and the slayer lay snuggled together on the couch. She

could see the Christmas lights winking at her from on top of the ceiling
and
wondered how her lover had managed to convince Xander and Giles to help her

hang lights on the ceiling. "I can’t believe you didn’t let me help you." A

kissable pout appeared on the Wiccan’s lips, and Buffy had to restrain

herself so she wouldn’t fluster Xander-who was laying on the floor, head

propped on his hand, watching "Its a Wonderful Life" on the
television.</p>

<p>A blonde eyebrow arched and a smirk twisted the Slayer’s lips. "You...on a

ladder...yeah, that was going to happen." Buffy said, sarcastically,
receiving a playful slap from her couch companion for her trouble.
"Besides,
you hung tinsel and silver balls like a...tinsel and silver balls
demon."</p>

<p>"You think?" Willow asked, taking a breath in excitement, as she felt a

gentle tickle float across her ribs.</p>

<p>"Nobody could have done it better." Buffy said, examining the tree that lit

up one corner of the living room, while moving a teasing hand across her

playmate’s abdomen. "It’s a beaut." She whispered, as she felt her lover’s

breath hitch at the teasing yet casual touches she was hoping Xander was
too
engrossed in the movie to see.</p>

<p>The halls had been decked with boughs of holly and lights hung from every

conceivable corner. It was going to cost her mother a fortune in electric

bills this month, but Joyce had said they could decorate anyway they
wanted,
so Buffy had taken her at her word. It was Buffy and Willow’s first
Christmas together as a couple and they wanted to make it a memorable
one.</p>

<p>Buffy, Xander, and Giles had dragged home a seven foot fir tree, which

Willow had insisted on decorating, while the other three had been busy

decorating the rest of the room. Buffy hadn’t missed an inch of space.

Decorations hung from doors and windows. A menorah had been placed on a

table in front of one of the windows in preparation for the celebration of

Chanukah, which would start in a few days, and Buffy had bought and hidden

eight little presents to give to Willow for the occasion. The rest of the

presents she had bought for Willow and her mother had been wrapped and now

lay under the brightly twinkling tree.</p>

<p>Between all the presents they all had been adding under there, the tree was

incredibly packed with gaily wrapped gifts.</p>

<p>From time to time, Xander would look at the tree in envy-it certainly

outclassed the skimpy looking bush that graced the table in his basement

apartment.</p>

<p>"How come your tree looks like the tree in Rockefeller center while mine

looks like the Charlie Brown Christmas tree?" Xander asked, finally, his

voice displaying displeasure at the difference, not paying attention to the

lesson George had learned in ‘It’s a wonderful life’.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at him in annoyance for a second, before she decided not to
let
him ruin her festive mood, and buried her face again in Willow’s soft,
peach
scented hair.</p>

<p>"Why do you need a big tree, Xander?" Willow asked, tracing the strong

fingers of the hand she held gently in her hand, with a curious thumb.

"You’re going to be with us for Christmas anyway."</p>

<p>Willow tried to reason with him, but he wasn’t in the mood to listen.

"Yeah...but...look at all these presents." Xander said, getting up from his

spot and going over to where the presents were. "For Buffy...For
Willow...For Buffy...To Willow love Buffy...To Buffy love Willow...Willow,

Willow, Willow, Buffy, Buffy...Oh here’s one to Xander...from...Joyce.

What’s up with that?" While Xander had been looking through the presents,

searching for a present that had his name on it, the other presents had
been
thrust aside carelessly, Xander seemingly unconcerned with how they ended
up
and they had started to spread out on the living room floor.</p>

<p>"Xander, put the presents back under the tree and leave them alone." Buffy

said, getting irritated at Xander’s behavior. She had to admit she had gone

overboard on Christmas shopping this year, at least on Willow, but half the

stuff she had bought were really cute baby items she hadn’t been able to

resist buying. She knew she was being premature, Willow was only six weeks

along in her pregnancy and anything could happen, but Buffy preferred to be

optimistic, and she really couldn’t have resisted the stuffed animals, toys

and clothes that had filled the baby aisle she had visited while Christmas

shopping...and Buffy had a sneaking suspicion her mom and Willow had done

the same thing, so she really didn’t feel too foolish.</p>

<p>Xander looked at the couple curled up together on the couch for a moment,

then started to put the presents back under the tree again, while muttering

under his breath. "It must be nice having somebody who would buy all of

these presents for you."</p>

<p>Xander unfortunately forgot the Slayer’s keen sense of hearing. "You want
to
know what the difference is, Xander? It’s quite simple, really. I have the

best woman in the world, and you have...Anya." Bright blue eyes filled with

ire met deep brown unflinchingly and Xander conceded the point he was being

an ass. His own softened to a look of apology and Buffy’s softened in

acceptance, as she felt a gentle squeeze from Willow who had witnessed the

confrontation.</p>

<p>"Easy there, tiger." Willow whispered into Buffy’s ear, feeling the tension

start to drain from her lover’s stiff body.</p>

<p>Buffy had just started to relax again, when the doorbell rang and the
couple
groaned, neither wanting to leave the cocoon of warmth in which they were

wrapped.</p>

<p>"I’ll get it." Joyce called from the kitchen, where she and Giles had

disappeared to earlier in the pretense of making egg nog. They heard her

footsteps as she went to open the door, and then silence reigned for a few

moments before they heard Joyce greeting the person at the door.
Buffy thought her mom’s voice sounded a little strangled, and she strained

to place the voice that she heard coming from the entryway. The answer

should have been obvious to the Slayer, but her mind shied away from the

knowledge, afraid of what it’s revelation might bring.</p>

<p>Joyce entered the living room, looking a little tense and pale, like the

proverbial bringer of bad news. "Willow...you have a visitor." She managed

to say, sparing the couple on the couch a sympathetic look, before a
familiar voice caught the Slayer and the Hacker in the chest with a
vise-like grip.</p>

<p>"Hi." The simple word sent two hearts racing double time as two sets of
eyes
swiveled to meet the form of Willow’s old boyfriend, Oz.</p>

<p>"Oz!" The word erupted from Willow’s lips, the shock evicting her from the

safe haven of Buffy’s arms as she sat up to get a better look at him. He

didn’t look like he had changed much in the time since she had last seen

him, although he hadn’t shaved recently by the look of the stubble on his

face, and he looked like he hadn’t eaten in a month.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear." Buffy vaguely heard her Watcher’s concerned words as she saw
him
approach from the kitchen, but most of her attention was taken up by the
man
now standing in her living room.</p>

<p>"Oz." She greeted, somberly, choosing to remain where she was while she

sized him up. "What are you doing here?" The question sprang out of the

Slayer’s mouth unbidden, but she was powerless to stop it’s outcoming. What

remained unasked was...What are you doing in my home? And why have you come

back?</p>

<p>Oz spared Buffy a glance acknowledging her question silently, before he

focused on the pale face of his ex-girlfriend. "I’ve been looking all over

the place for you. I stopped at the dorm, but everybody had gone home for

Christmas, so I went to your parents’ house." Oz noticed the way Willow’s

face had blanched even paler at that. He couldn’t really blame her. This

wasn’t exactly easy for him either. His conscience screamed at him for

leaving Willow behind like that. It was even worse now that he knew she was

pregnant. "They weren’t very happy to see me."</p>

<p>"I’ll bet." Buffy growled, trying and failing to control herself.</p>

<p>Willow wanted to look at her lover, to reassure her that everything was

going to be all right. But she wasn’t sure herself of that at the moment,

and her attention was pretty much taken up by the unexpected sight in front

of her. She really didn’t know what to say, so she remained
silent.</p>

<p>Oz shifted uncomfortably, looking around at the sea of faces around him. He

noted the concern that darkened Giles’ brow, and the worried frown on Mrs.

Summers face. Xander looked like somebody who anticipated a really gruesome

train wreck. The restrained hostility on Buffy’s face surprised him, but he

supposed he deserved it for deserting Willow the way he had. Willow’s face

was hardest to read, showing mostly shock at his sudden appearance, but he

thought he recognized a flash of fear in the stormy green eyes, before it

was covered with stony wariness.</p>

<p>"I think we need to talk." Oz said, staring only into Willow’s eyes and

trying to ignore the audience around them...especially Buffy.
"Alone."
Willow nodded her head, seeing Buffy starting to open her mouth to protest,

before she heard it close with an audible snap. Willow felt she owed Oz at

least this much. She rose slowly off of the couch, careful not to glance

back at her irate lover as she led Oz into the kitchen, feeling Buffy’s

hostile eyes boring holes into them until they disappeared from
sight.</p>

<p>It took a moment for what happened to sink into Buffy’s clouded brain, then

she was up off the couch and heading for the entrance of the kitchen. She

wasn’t sure what she intended to do once she got there, visions of beating

Oz to a bloody pulp danced wildly through the red daze in her head, but her

mother’s voice calling her name stopped her before she crossed the
threshold. She could hear low murmuring coming from the kitchen, and it was

all she could do not to enter, feeling like it was her place to be by

Willow’s side.</p>

<p>"Buffy...they really do need a few moments alone." Joyce reprimanded her

daughter gently.</p>

<p>Buffy glared at the closed kitchen door for a moment, every instinct in her

body telling her to disregard everybody and do what she really wanted to
do.
She felt her hands closing into fists as she swung around and looked at the

concerned faces of her family and friends. "All right." She growled,
starting to pace the length of the living room, like a lion locked in a

cage.</p>

<p>"I can’t believe this...I can’t believe that he’d pick now of all times to

show up." Buffy muttered, the tension in her body coiling the muscles
tight.
The more Buffy paced, the madder she got, and every time she looked at the

closed kitchen door she wanted to run right through it and act on her more

basic instinct to defend her property.</p>

<p>Conflicting thoughts were running rampant through Buffy’s mind, pissing her

off even more as a little midget of fear whispered in her mind’s ear of the

possibility that Oz was here to get Willow back. It whispered that Oz could

take better care of Willow and their baby than she could, and shouldn’t she

just give up and let Oz do so. The voice pissed her off so much that she

started screaming at the closed kitchen door. "What does he think he’s
doing
here?! He doesn’t belong here!"</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Giles called to the ravening beast that was once the Slayer,

sharing a concerned look with Buffy’s mother.</p>

<p>"What?!" Buffy snarled, turning on the Watcher, beyond caring what anybody

thought as her churned up emotions ran riot inside of her.
Giles was surprised by the amount of venomosity in her voice. He had never

seen his Slayer quite like this before, though he suspected that the
protective quality of a potential parent was kicking in to the Slayer’s

emotions. "This really is not helping. Oz and Willow can probably hear
every
word you’re saying." He said, trying to reason with her.</p>

<p>"I don’t care." She screeched outraged. "I hope they do hear me!" She
yelled
in the direction of the kitchen, making everybody in the room
wince.</p>

<p>Joyce and Giles’ exchanged helpless glances, before a look of utter
determination clamped down on the Watcher’s face. "Come on, Buffy. Get your

coat. We’re going out for a while."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at him as if he was the one who had lost his mind and not the

other way around. "What...but...I can’t just..." Buffy started to protest,

cringing as she saw the look on Giles face.</p>

<p>"You can, and you will." The Watcher said, in his no nonsense tone as he

signaled to Xander to fetch the coats.</p>

<p>Xander did as he was told and handed Giles his coat before he brought

Buffy’s coat over to her.</p>

<p>"But...Will..." Buffy protested shooting a parting look over to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Will be fine." Xander soothed, as he helped the Slayer put on her coat.

"Don’t worry...Uncle Xander will watch over everything until you get back.

You just go and have a nice, relaxing time with Grandpa Giles." The last

remark earned him a reproachful glare from Giles, but Xander just shrugged

as if to say, ‘It got her moving didn’t it?’ He breathed a sigh of relief
as
he watched the two of them leave then sank down into a nearby chair,
brushing sweat off of his forehead.</p>

<p>Willow had winced as she heard her angry lover spouting off in the living

room. She could hear Giles quiet murmuring to her, and not much later the

outraged spouting stopped with the shutting of the door.</p>

<p>"Guess she wasn’t very happy to see me." Oz noted, calmly.</p>

<p>That’s an understatement. Willow thought wryly, cringing at just how pissed

off she’d been. "Well...She..." Willow said haltingly, trying to find a way

to explain her lover’s behavior.</p>

<p>"It’s okay. I can’t really blame her...not after the way I left. I didn’t

know, Willow. Why didn’t you tell me? I never would have left if I’d known.

It’s my responsibility to take care of you." Oz said, feeling the burden

settle on his not so big shoulders.</p>

<p>Willow shook her head, trying to sift through all of the impressions those

few words had left her with. Responsibility? Never would have
left...if...he’d known? Was that the only reason you came back? "It’s

not..." Willow started to say that it wasn’t his responsibility because it

wasn’t his child but she was cut off at the pass.</p>

<p>"It is." Oz insisted vehemently. "You should have told me
Willow."</p>

<p>"I didn’t tell you, because I didn’t know then. I wasn’t pregnant then."

Willow finished in a small voice.</p>

<p>Oz looked at her strangely, waiting for more information.</p>

<p>"It’s not yours. She’s not yours." The words hit Oz like a brick. Willow

could see the impact in his open green eyes before they shuttered with
pain,
bringing tears to Willow’s own green eyes.</p>

<p>"Wh-What? What do you mean?" Oz asked, breathlessly, feeling like the wind

had been knocked out of him.</p>

<p>"It happened after you left." Willow rested a trembling hand against her

belly, and raised her eyes to meet Oz’s. "She’s Buffy’s." Willow thought Oz

was going to pass out when the words registered on his confused
brain.
"Oh...What?!"</p>

<p>"What are we supposed to be getting here?" Buffy asked, sullenly, kicking

the wheel of the shopping cart Giles was pushing.</p>

<p>"Buffy, stop that." Giles said, looking annoyed as he stopped and grabbed a

box of stuffing off of the shelf. "You’re mother asked me to pick up a few

things, and I figured now was as good a time as any to get them."</p>

<p>"Not to mention it gets me away from Oz." Buffy grumbled, refusing to meet

Giles’ eyes.</p>

<p>"You weren’t helping matter’s any, Buffy. The last thing Willow needs right

now, is for you to get into a shoving match with Oz. Hand me that can of

jellied cranberries, would you?"</p>

<p>"I only wanted to protect her, Giles. That’s MY job now." Buffy said,

handing him the can of cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>"No. That isn’t it." Giles said, stopping the cart in the middle of the

aisle. He looked at Buffy over the rim of his glasses. "You saw Oz enter

your and Willow’s home and you felt he was interloping on your territory.

Trying to take Willow from you. Correct?"</p>

<p>Buffy wanted to argue Giles’ logic, but she wasn’t able to as the intense

feeling of jealousy and territorialism rose anew in the Slayer. "You’re

right...as usual, Giles." Buffy said, bitterly, walking up the aisle. "I
saw
Oz...and then I saw red. I mean, how dare he come back now?"</p>

<p>"Oh. I agree. Very nervy of him to pick this inconvenient time to show up."

The rich sarcasm in his voice caused Buffy to stop and glare at him.
"Buffy,
it’s not as if Oz planned for things to happen this way. When Oz left, for

reasons of his own, I’m sure he didn’t count on coming back here only to

discover that Willow is with child. Naturally, he’s going to assume the
baby
is his. He’s wrong, but he couldn’t possibly know that."</p>

<p>"He just better not try anything." Buffy growled, inwardly agreeing that

Giles was right but not wanting to let go of her anger against the intruder

into her life.</p>

<p>Giles sighed, and continued walking, determined to talk some sense into

Buffy’s head before they left the store.</p>

<p>Willow stared at the pale faced guitar player and felt a certain amount of

shame and guilt that she had to tell him the story this way, almost two

weeks before Christmas at that.</p>

<p>"And that’s how you ended up..." Oz left the end of the statement open,

staring in slack jawed wonder as Willow nodded her head. "Wow. No wonder

Buffy was about ready to kill me. I knew her reaction to me was strong,

but...I guess now I know why."</p>

<p>"Yeah...I can’t imagine she’s very happy right now." Willow sighed, staring

across the kitchen table at her old high school boyfriend. "She’s probably

taking Giles head off as we speak...he’s pretty used to it though." Willow

reflected, thinking about her hot headed lover.</p>

<p>Oz nodded, still feeling the tension that had circled around them though it

had started to dissipate in the last few minutes as understanding passed

between them. "Will, I’m so sorry I showed up the way I did. I should have

called or something...at least given you some warning."</p>

<p>"It’s okay." Willow sighed, feeling tension rolling off her tightly wound

shoulders. She really could go for a massage and hoped that Buffy might be

in a better frame of mind later to give her one. "I’m kinda glad you
did...I
felt bad for the way things ended last time."</p>

<p>"Me too." Oz said, thinking of all that had gone between them.</p>

<p>"Are you going to be here for Christmas?" Willow asked, hoping he would

stay...at least for the holidays.</p>

<p>"I...uh...don’t really have anywhere to stay. I suppose I could sleep in my

van...but I don’t really think Buffy would want me here...she was pretty

upset with me, earlier." The Master of Understatement said,
ruefully.</p>

<p>"Well...yeah...but...that was before you knew. Now that you do know, she

probably won’t feel as strange around you." Willow was hedging on the

statement, not knowing how Buffy would react to the addition in their

holiday festivities. She hoped that her lover would get over her intense

reaction to Oz, but that remained to be seen.</p>

<p>The first thing Buffy noticed when she walked into the house carrying two

bags of groceries was Oz’s presence occupying the couch. Her blue eyes

focused in on him as she wondered what the heck he was still doing
here.</p>

<p>"Buffy...you’re home...great...I’ll just take these into the kitchen."
Joyce
said, as she approached her daughter to get the bags.</p>

<p>"Where’s Will?" Buffy asked, her voice tight, as she retained her hold on

the bags.</p>

<p>"She’s in the kitchen. Buffy, be nice to her." Joyce said, feeling slightly

deflated as Buffy made her way to the kitchen. She eyed Giles who was
coming
through the door, carrying a bag himself.</p>

<p>"How is she?" Joyce asked, in a subdued whisper.</p>

<p>"I imagine she was doing a lot better until she saw him. Is he staying?"
The
curiosity mixed with reproach in his voice caused Joyce to give him a

strange look.</p>

<p>"It’s Christmas. He doesn’t have anywhere else to go. I told him he could

sleep on the couch." Joyce explained, sparing the young man who was sitting

on her sofa a look. Xander was passed out in the recliner and had missed
the
whole entrance, but Oz was casting concerned glances at the swinging
kitchen
door.</p>

<p>Upon entering the kitchen, Buffy saw Willow leaning against the counter

staring off into space. She put the bags down next to her and cleared her

throat, waiting for misty green eyes to turn to her. She stood under
Willow’s scrutiny, feeling like an amoebae under a microscope, as the red

head examined her. Buffy grew self conscious as her lover stared at her and

turned her attention back to the brown paper bags sitting on top of the

counter.</p>

<p>"Went shopping. Giles had to buy some yams...and other...stuff." Buffy drew

to a halt as she saw a red eyebrow quirk at her from her peripheral vision.

Buffy drew in a breath to steady her nerves, then peeked over at her lover

searching her eyes for the love that she longed to see in them. They
gleamed
back at her reassuringly and she was able to breathe a little easier. Until

she remembered the unwanted presence in the living room, that is. "So...Oz

is staying?" Buffy asked, trying not to sound jealous.</p>

<p>"It’s Christmas." Willow said, trying to reason with her.</p>

<p>"Not for two more weeks...surely he can find a place to stay by then."
Buffy
objected, wondering how her life had suddenly got so topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>"Buffy..." Willow sighed, wishing her new love and her old love could just

get along.</p>

<p>"Fine." Buffy pouted, obstinately. "I’m not buying him a
present."</p>

<p>"You don’t have to." Willow said, a slight smile creeping over her lips as

she felt Buffy giving in.</p>

<p>"Does he know?" Buffy asked, addressing the pink elephant that was standing

in the room with them.</p>

<p>Willow nodded her head. "I told him." She said, quietly, the words
reflecting the sadness this situation brought her.</p>

<p>"Oh." Buffy took a second to evaluate what that meant. "Everything?" She

couldn’t help from asking, even though she knew she shouldn’t.</p>

<p>"Buffy...yes...he knows...everything. What do you think? That I’d let him

think he’s the father." Willow said, exasperated. Seeing the guilty
affirmation on Buffy’s face made Willow cringe. "How could you think
that?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know, Will!" Buffy exclaimed, walking away to avoid the close

scrutiny she was putting her under.</p>

<p>Willow followed her and grabbed a hold on her elbow, turning her so that
she
was forced to look at her. "Talk to me." Willow demanded, sitting Buffy
down
in a chair and straddling her. "Because I’m not moving until you
do."</p>

<p>Buffy wanted to argue at first, but the resolved look on Willow’s face

stopped her cold. "What do you want me to say? I’m sorry. I’m sorry I

freaked when Oz showed up here. I just...I wasn’t expecting him to just
show
up like that. And then, when you two walked into the kitchen, I just
couldn’t believe you left me sitting there. I felt like...like I should be

with you when you told him. It’s my job to protect you...and I couldn’t.
So,
I started pacing, and every time I looked at the door I wanted to go
through
it. Be with you...and I guess I got scared." Buffy admitted, her voice a

soft husk, as she stared down at Willow’s jean covered thigh.</p>

<p>"Why?" Willow whispered, cupping Buffy’s face gently and caressing the soft

skin of Buffy’s cheek. "You know I love you." She said the words while

staring into her lover’s beautiful blue eyes, searching their depths to
make
sure that she did indeed know it.</p>

<p>"I know. I know you do...it’s just that when I was pacing out there I

started thinking that...that maybe...maybe Oz would make a better father

than I would...I mean he’s a guy, and all. He can give you and our baby at

least a picture of normalcy. I can’t what with being a slayer and
all...never mind the fact that I’m a girl." Buffy said, rolling her eyes at

herself.</p>

<p>"Buffy...he’s a werewolf." Willow said, emphasizing each
syllable.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but he’s a still guy. So he’s got one point in his favor. I mean
what
am I gonna tell my daughter when she’s five, and she comes home crying

because the kids teased her about the family portrait that she drew in art

class?"</p>

<p>"Could be worse...Dad could be covered with hair." Willow teased gently.

When she received only a baleful look from her lover she sighed. "Can we

please take one problem at a time? I’m barely getting over morning sickness

and you’re shooting ahead to when she’s five? You are going to be a great

parent. Do you want to know how I know?" She asked, her gentle voice
soothing the Slayer’s fears.</p>

<p>"Because you’re a witch?" Buffy guessed, receiving a playful slap for her

trouble. "Ow."</p>

<p>"No...because you’re already thinking ahead to when she’s five. You want to

be here to see that time to come. You want to be here to kiss her booboo’s

away, and watch her grow and learn, knowing that you helped her do all
those
things."</p>

<p>"Will..." Buffy protested, shaking her head slightly.</p>

<p>"Buff...I know you have doubts and insecurities and fears...we both do. But

I’m going to be right here to help you through them."</p>

<p>"You promise?"</p>

<p>"I cross my heart." Willow said, pantomiming the motion.</p>

<p>"Good...cause I don’t think I could do this without you." The Slayer’s
voice
cracked on the last syllable and she had to fight hard to keep her emotions

in check.</p>

<p>"I wont let you...as long as you do the same for me." Willow had no
compunction about letting her feelings show as silvery tears slipped down

her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I promise." Buffy said, resting her forehead on Willow’s and wiping her

tears away with tender fingers.</p>

<p>"I love you Buffy Summers." Willow said, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>"Who me?" Buffy said with a watery grin.</p>

<p>"Yes you, you Gooberhead." Willow grinned back at her.</p>

<p>"Did you just call me a Gooberhead?" Buffy said, finding the nitch in

Willow’s side where she knew her lover was the most ticklish and tickling

her unmercifully.</p>

<p>"Ack! No...stop...can’t breathe..." Willow managed to get out between
spurts
of laughter.</p>

<p>Buffy relented as Willow buried her head against her neck, content to just

wrap her arms around her lover and hold her. "I could stay like this
forever." Buffy breathed, as she relaxed into the pleasantly warm feeling

holding her lover gave her.</p>

<p>Willow hummed in contentment, feeling her world righting itself again.

"Somebody could walk in here, you know." Willow prodded her gently, after a

few minutes of cuddling.</p>

<p>"Yeah...they can walk right back out again too." Buffy grunted, not wanting

to move. It was funny, Buffy reflected, that Giles chose that exact moment

to walk into the kitchen carrying the last of the grocery bags. She watched

as he peered curiously around the kitchen until his gentle eyes came to
rest
upon the snuggling couple and she saw his face start to turn red.</p>

<p>"Um, I’m sorry to interrupt...but the ice cream was starting to melt." He

explained, lifting his eyebrow as a way of asking if everything was all

right.</p>

<p>"It’s all right, Giles." Buffy said, as they both stood. "It’s probably a

good idea to get those put away before they spoil...or melt...or
something."
They went over to help Giles unload the bags, casting loving looks at each

other as they put the groceries away.</p>

<p>Giles noticed the chemistry floating around the kitchen, and as soon as he

was finished he made a quick excuse and exited the kitchen, leaving the two

women alone as they gravitated to each other again.</p>

<p>The two entranced women never noticed Giles leaving, never noticed the door

swinging as it shut behind him, never noticed anything but the strong pull

each felt when they were around each other.</p>

<p>Willow didn’t even remember being placed on the kitchen counter, as the
feel
of Buffy’s lips on hers sent her into another world of pure sensation. She

felt Buffy nibble across her jawline and up, until she found that spot on

her earlobe that sent Goosebumps all over her body. Willow felt herself

sinking into the sensations almost forgetting where she was as Buffy moaned

low in her ear, and pressed up against her, slipping easily between her

spread legs. It wasn’t until she heard Giles bidding Joyce goodnight that

she remembered where they were and realized they shouldn’t be doing what

they were doing. "Mmm...Buffy we can’t...not here..." Willow murmured, her

heart beat pounding loud in her chest.</p>

<p>"Do you trust me, Will?" Buffy whispered, passionately, in her
ear.</p>

<p>"Wha...of course." Willow replied, a little distracted by Buffy’s lips
which
continued to suck on her ear lobe.</p>

<p>"Wrap your legs around me." Buffy urged, moving her hands down to circle

Willow’s waist. She waited until Willow had complied, albeit hesitantly,

before she moved down to her butt and lifted her off the counter.</p>

<p>Willow could feel the strength in the Slayer’s arms and legs as she held

her, the muscles rippling under the skin. She held tightly to the Slayer’s

shoulders, feeling completely safe and secure, as Buffy carried her out of

the kitchen, past the gawking occupants of the living room, and up the

stairs.</p>

<p>"Buffy...what?" Joyce stared in shock at the sight that had passed her

leaving her speechless.</p>

<p>"Night, Mom." She heard Buffy call back to her as she saw Willow waving at

them distractedly.</p>

<p>Oz and Joyce shared a quiet look before Oz said. "I don’t want to
know."</p>

<p>"Neither do I." Joyce replied, shaking her head at the outrageous acts of

her daughter.</p>

<p>At first, Willow felt a twinge of embarrassment at being carried up the

living room stairs, but when Buffy had shut the door, shutting the rest of

the world out with it, and laid her gently on the bed, all she could see
was
love filled blue eyes, and everything else disappeared. She reached up and

grasped the hand that was gently tracing her face, and brought it to her

mouth kissing it gently. "I love you, Buffy." She whispered, watching the

eyes she loved so much fill with gentle tears.</p>

<p>"Love you, too, Wills." Buffy whispered back, her heart beating a mile a

minute. It always affected her so profoundly when they were alone like
this.
Like her very heart lay before her, and all she had to do was reach out and

grab it. Her breathing caught in her throat as she reached out a trembling

finger and traced Willow’s lips, feeling their softness beneath her
fingertip, licking her own lips in an unconscious mimic of what her finger

was doing.</p>

<p>Willow’s lips felt like they were on fire, Buffy’s finger leaving a
scorching path of heat as she traced them. Hypnotic blue eyes seared her as

they followed the finger’s path down over her chin, along the long slope of

her neck, to rest at the pulse point in her throat that was pulsing wildly.

Willow gulped at the heady sensation, watching her lover’s face light up as

her affected state was made apparent to her.</p>

<p>"Is that a rabbit in your throat or are you just happy to see me?" Buffy

grinned at the dazed look in Willow’s eyes as she leaned over and traced

with her tongue the same path her finger had taken, stopping to suck gently

at the throbbing pulse point. She felt as well as heard her lover moan, the

sound vibrating through their bodies. She groaned back in sympathy, feeling

Willow’s hands thread through her hair as she lay down on the bed, lying

half on top of her as she continued to suck on the sweet skin of her neck,

feeling the blood pulse beneath her lips.
Buffy’s finger continued its curious journey, being joined by its
counterparts as they spread over the soft slope of Willow’s breast. It idly

traced the sensitive nipple that was hidden by the soft cotton of her

lover’s blouse. Buffy groaned as she felt it pebble familiarly at the

attention it received. The attention she loved to give it. Hearing Willow’s

breathing hitch and feeling her start to wiggle under the gentle teasing,

Buffy’s fingers moved from their target, hearing a low groan as the light

pinching was automatically missed, and moved to unbutton the blouse that
was
impeding her access to the soft pink flesh. She unbuttoned buttons in no

hurry to end the delicious torture, as every button that was released,

revealed more skin which Buffy was compelled to taste, her mouth tickling

the skin as she placed open-mouthed kisses over every inch.</p>

<p>"Buffy...please..." Willow panted, all too ready to release the shirt that

was hindering the wanted attentions. She watched with smoldering green eyes

as Buffy pulled the tails out of the waist of her jeans. She felt gentle

fingers spreading over her belly, tracing the softened curves. She shook
the
shirt off, pulling it out of the way as a warm tongue moved over her belly,

blonde hair caressed her skin, as she watched her love’s utter fascination

with that part of her body.</p>

<p>"Buff..." Her voice was smoky as she tried to get her attention, craving
the
shear intensity that existed between them. Blue fire created a spark that

quickly spread into a raging inferno inside as their eyes met, and then

their lips joined in intense passion. Their tongues battled for several

seconds before Buffy sucked on Willow’s tongue, increasing the burning in

her abdomen. She groaned as Buffy’s fingers made quick work of removing her

bra, sending it flying across the room to hit with a splat against the
door,
before it dropped to the floor. They made their way back to her nipples,

which were already tightening from the shear pleasure running through her

blood stream. Her moans filled the room and Buffy’s mouth as fingers
tightened on her sensitized nipples, then started to roll them sending

delicious sparks of feeling through her body to the pressure that was

building further below.</p>

<p>Buffy’s mouth watered as she longed to taste the nipples her fingers were

teasing. Leaving Willow’s mouth with one last kiss, she dropped her head,

making her way over the soft sweet skin until she reached her destination,

her fingers vacating the area with one last tweak, and wrapped around

Willow’s back so she could pull her up. Her mouth found its target easily

and she groaned as the sweet taste filled her mouth.
Willow gasped sharply as the wet mouth wrapped around her nipple, pulling
on
the sensitive skin with her tongue before sucking on it gently. Her fingers

tightened in the Slayer’s hair, holding her head steady in the spot she

wanted her the most at the moment. She felt the fingers of Buffy’s other

hand teasing her other nipple and it sent a dual sense of feeling to her

aching center. Warmth built as her wetness grew, and she wrapped her legs

around the Slayer’s legs pressing her aching need against her.</p>

<p>Buffy could lose herself in the gentle sucking, loving the way Willow’s

breast felt in her mouth. She loved to tease it, biting it gently, before

laving the pain away with her tongue. She imagined what it would be like as

they got bigger with Willow’s pregnancy, how they would taste like when the

baby came and they filled with milk. She wondered secretly to herself if
she
was demented for wanting to taste her lover’s milk, but didn’t give the
idea
a whole lot of consideration as she felt the urgency building in
Willow.</p>

<p>Reluctantly leaving her spot, she slid down to Willow’s legs, kissing her

lover’s belly and saying "Hi." to her child that grew within. She
unbuttoned
Willow’s jeans with deft fingers, and slid them down her legs, stopping to

take off her lovers shoes, she threw them out of the way before she slid
the
jeans completely off. She slid her panties off in the same fashion, then

spent several moments just looking at her lover, marveling in the exquisite

beauty that lay before her. "You’re so beautiful Will." Buffy murmured, her

blue eyes shining with passion.</p>

<p>No matter how much Willow started to feel self conscious or unattractive

when she looked in the mirror, it all disappeared when Buffy looked at her

like that. She watched in anticipation as Buffy removed her own clothes,

revealing the lithe form beneath. Her breath caught in her throat every
time
she saw Buffy’s beautiful body, unable to believe that somebody so gorgeous

was actually hers, and what astounded her even more was that this goddess

felt the same way about her.</p>

<p>Buffy slowly crawled back up her body, sliding her own over her lover’s in

delicious silky contact. Her eyes closed involuntarily at the sensation,
and
when she opened them again she was gazing down into passion glazed green

eyes. Buffy moaned as their lips met again, losing herself in the
exploration.</p>

<p>Willow wrapped her legs around the Slayer’s hips, relishing the feel of her

as they started to move together in that ageless rhythm. Her hands searched

everywhere, searching out every spot of desire on the Slayer’s
body.</p>

<p>Buffy could tell it was going to be a long night, as they sank into the

desire content on just loving each other.</p>

<p>Buffy woke up early the next morning, her sleepy eyes greeting the sight of

the red head sleeping on her chest. Her arms tightened around her sleeping

lover, as she smiled down into the peaceful face. Every time with Willow

felt like the first time, and she wondered for the umpteenth time how she

ever got so lucky. Feeling the need to do something wonderful for her

sleeping partner, she decided to make her breakfast in bed. Easing out from

under her, hearing only a low whimper in protest as Willow rolled over

burying her head in the covers, Buffy found her bathrobe and threw it over

her naked form. Casting one final look at the peaceful pose, she tightened

the sash on her white robe and tiptoed out of the room and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Buffy noticed Xander still sleeping in the recliner. Her mom must have not

wanted to disturb him last night, but Oz was conspicuously absent from the

couch, and she looked around the nearly empty living room wondering where
he
was.</p>

<p>She found him sitting on a kitchen stool at the breakfast nook having a
bowl
of cereal. "You’re up early." Buffy commented, walking over to the counter

and looking dubiously at the stove. She didn’t know why she was suddenly

apprehensive. She’d made Thanksgiving dinner by herself, breakfast should
be
a piece of cake.</p>

<p>"You too." Oz noted, in return. His calm hazel eyes peering back at her

undisturbed.</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged unconsciously. "I thought I’d make Will some
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh." Oz nodded. "Breakfast in bed. Always a Will pleaser."</p>

<p>Buffy didn’t even want to think about how Oz knew that, images of a dancing

imp would start appearing in her head. So she decided to let sleeping dogs

lie, at least where Will in bed was concerned. "Look Oz...I’m...I’m sorry I

reacted so badly to your showing up yesterday. I wasn’t expecting it and

well...I’m just sorry, okay?" Buffy stared hard at Oz wondering what his

reaction would be.</p>

<p>Oz nodded thoughtfully. "Thanks. You know...you handled that a lot better

than I would have."</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged nonchalantly, not necessarily feeling that was true, but she

wasn’t about to argue the point with him while she went about preparing

scrambled eggs and bacon for Will’s breakfast.</p>

<p>She was just pouring the eggs into the sizzling hot frying pan when Willow

walked into the kitchen, wiping muzzily at her sleep crusted eyes. She made

an adorable sight, dressed in a blue terry cloth bathrobe and bunny
slippers, hair sticking up in all directions, her green eyes looking
blearily around the kitchen. Buffy saw the bemused expression on her face
as
she stopped and took in the sight of Buffy and Oz in the kitchen
together...not killing each other.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her not quite awake lover. "I thought you were sleeping."

She said, cheerfully, as she kissed her lightly on the forehead, careful to

keep the spatula she was holding in her right hand pointed away from
her.</p>

<p>"Mm...missed you...what’s going on?" Willow asked, leaning against her

sleepily.</p>

<p>"Well...I was making you breakfast in bed...but now that you’re up...it’s

kinda moot." Buffy said, squeezing the soft form gently, as she wrapped the

long arms around her and returned her attention the sizzling scrambled eggs

and bacon. She relaxed back against her, hearing Oz shifting on his stool

behind them.</p>

<p>"I think I’ll go get an early start on the Christmas shopping." Oz said, as

he stood and put his bowl in the sink, before slipping out the kitchen
door.
Buffy watched him go, feeling a slight twinge of guilt at making him
uncomfortable, but the feel of Willow’s arms around her chased it
away.</p>

<p>"I didn’t mean to scare him away." Willow commented, resting her head on

Buffy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Buffy stared at the kitchen door for a second, before she sighed. "I don’t

think it was you really...just seeing us together. I know it gave me a

wiggins watching you with Oz when you were together. It can’t be any more

fun for him."</p>

<p>Willow nodded, slightly, before she decided to put it out of her head.

"Thanks for making me breakfast. I’m starving. I think somebody worked up
my
appetite last night." Willow murmured, coyly, nibbling on the back of the

Slayer’s neck.</p>

<p>"My pleasure." Buffy hummed, stroking the arm that circled her waist. She

relaxed in the feel of being held by her lover as she cooked her
breakfast...knowing that later they would have things to deal with.
Celebrating the holidays had taken on a new dimension, what with the
addition of Oz to their little party. Buffy wasn’t sure how she was going
to
deal with that yet. Hopefully she and Oz could settle into some kind of an

understanding, but until then they would probably keep a wary distance of

each other. But right now, all Buffy wanted to do was share a peaceful

breakfast with her love, and that’s what she intended to do.</p>
