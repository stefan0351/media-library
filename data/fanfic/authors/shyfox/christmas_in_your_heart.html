<p align=center><i>--Cowboy</i></p>

<p>Buffy stood in front of the huge window in the kitchen, cup of coffee in her
hand, gazing out at the mounds of snow that covered the front lawn outside.
She could hear birds whistling, tweeting and chirping in the trees right
outside the window, and she swam in a feeling of complete and utter
relaxation.</p>

<p>Thwack!  The sound of a snowball hitting the glass pane in front of her
startled her into pulling her head back with a jerk.  She glared out at the
chortling face of Xander Harris, who was busy making another snowball with
his cold-reddened hands.  Buffy idly contemplated burying him in the cold
wet stuff.  That is, until another thought intruded upon it.</p>

<p>‘Wait a minute.  It doesn’t snow in SunnyDale.  What the hell?’  High
pitched, squealing, childish laughter caught her attention and her eyes
zeroed in on a little girl that had just threw a snowball at the back of
Xander’s head.  She appeared to be three or four years old and had a shock
of reddish blonde hair tied in the back into a braid.  It whipped around her
head as she laughed in delight and she watched as Xander turned to look in
mock menace at the child.</p>

<p>“Come and get me, Unca Xander.”  The child cried, wiggling her fingers
against her head in a ‘Nya Nya’ gesture.</p>

<p>Xander snorted like a wild bull, stomping his foot in the snow, causing the
girl to squeal all the more before he charged at her.  The girl spun and ran
on her heels, giggles echoing back as she ran, before she tripped and fell
in the snow.</p>

<p>Xander caught up to her and started tickling the actively wiggling child,
and her gales of laughter floated to Buffy’s ears on the wind.  A wistful
look filled her eyes as she watched them play, wishing she could be out
there with them.  A clearing of a throat caused her to turn her head, and
she saw a very pregnant Willow standing next to her holding her coat.  “I
think you should go play.”  Willow suggested, a warm smile gracing her lips.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”  Buffy heard herself asking, but knew she wanted to be
outside playing with her daughter.</p>

<p>“Yes.  I’m sure.  Trust me, I’ll let you know when the time comes.”  Willow
said, ruefully, patting her extended belly.</p>

<p>A huge smile grew over the Slayer’s face as her eyes glowed brightly.
“Thanks, Will.”  Buffy said, kissing her lips lightly while slipping into
her jacket, then she slipped out the kitchen door, entering the white
wilderness that greeted her with an icy nip at her nose and cheeks.</p>

<p>The red headed girl noticed her almost the very second she left the house
and was upon her in half that time as she screamed her name in glee.  “Catch
me!”  The child cried, before she launched herself into Buffy’s arms.</p>

<p>Buffy caught her, then threw her up in the air, listening with heart
pounding joy as the child laughed wildly, her blue eyes flashing brightly in
the sunlight as she caught her and hugged her tightly.</p>

<p>The details became fuzzy as the dreamer awoke, and she reached out for it,
clinging tenaciously to the wisp that had been her dream world.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed as she opened her eyes, blinking against the brightness of the
room. Her head rested on the soft chest she had fallen asleep on last night
after making love.  Fingers flexed against the softness she lay upon,
tracing gentle circles into the rounded curves of her lover. She peered
sightlessly as she tried to bring her dream back to her in living color.  It
played impishly around the recesses of her mind, letting her see it in bits
and pieces, but never completely and not evoking the feelings that she had
felt within the dream.  She sighed, mystified at how real that dream had
seemed.  Often she would have prophetic dreams, most of them had been nasty,
but this one had been wonderful, if it was prophetic.  She could’ve just
been imagining what her daughter would look like.</p>

<p>She caressed the slight slope of the gently rounded abdomen curiously.  “Was
that you?”  She whispered, placing a ghost of a kiss on Willow’s navel.
Hearing a soft chuckle as the surface under her lips moved, blue eyes looked
up startled into sparkling green.</p>

<p>“Who are you talking to?”  Willow asked, a sleepy grin lighting the rosy
cheeks.</p>

<p>A slight blush flushed the Slayer’s cheeks as she answered.  “Our daughter.
I had a dream about her.  It seemed so real.”  The blue eyes turned
mystified as she called up the scattered images of her dream once more. One
long arm reached down to brush the long blonde hair out of her eyes, and
Buffy caught a brief sparkle from the charm bracelet that dangled from
Willow’s wrist.  She had given the bracelet to her as a Hanukkah gift.  It
had three charms on it at the moment.  A tiny rocking horse, symbolizing the
coming of their baby, a witches hat, celebrating the spell that had brought
them together, and a golden heart, symbolizing her own heart which she had
given to Willow from the day they had met.</p>

<p>“You did?  What did she look like?”  Willow’s voice was quiet as she watched
Buffy’s face morph from bemused to beaming.</p>

<p>“She was beautiful Will…she looked like a miniature you, all red hair and
freckles.”  Blue eyes shined as she remembered, the sound of the sweet
laughter still echoing in her ears.</p>

<p>“Do you think it was one of your special dreams?”  Willow pondered,
bewitched with the idea that Buffy had actually seen into their future.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”  Buffy said, shaking her head.  “It seemed real, in a
strange kind of way…but I guess I could have just been imagining what she
would look like.”</p>

<p>Willow absorbed that silently for a moment.  “Do you want her to look like
me?”  Buffy picked up on the touch of insecurity that filled her voice.  Her
eyes gentled as she looked deep into her love’s eyes.  “I do.  I want her to
look just like you.”  Her voice was soft as she gently caressed Willow’s
face, the fingers of her right hand tracing a path over the hacker’s eyebrow
and cheekbone, then moving softly over the pink lips.  A warm hand covered
hers on Willow’s stomach as they gazed into each other’s eyes losing
themselves in the love they each held for the other.  “So beautiful.”  Buffy
whispered before their lips touched, sending warm waves of joy through them.</p>

<p>Willow sighed blissfully into the kiss, content to bask in the warmth that
spread between them. Buffy felt the morning creeping upon them, however, and
groaned as she risked a glance at the clock, resting her head once more on
Willow’s chest.  “We have to get up.  It’s almost nine.  Everyone will be
here soon.”</p>

<p>Willow moaned in dissatisfaction, belatedly remembering what day it was.
“It’s Christmas.”</p>

<p>Buffy eyed her wryly.  “Merry Christmas, Will.”  She smiled, slightly
kissing her quickly before she climbed out of bed, groaning slightly while
putting her robe over a body that just did not want to get out of bed.</p>

<p>“Right back at’cha” Willow chirped back, as she stood up and put her robe on
also.  Buffy had done her best to give her the best Hanukkah ever, somehow
knowing that not being with her parents this year for Hanukkah was
depressing her.   While Xander had insisted on singing both versions of Adam
Sandler’s Hanukkah song, Buffy had surprised her one night with a beautiful
rendition of “Oh Hanukkah”.  Willow smiled brightly as she remembered
Buffy’s sweet voice lifting to the old tune…</p>

<p align=center>“Oh Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah,<br>
Come light the menorah.<br>
Let’s have a party, We’ll all dance the hora.<br>
Gather round the table, we’ll give you a treat.<br>
Sevivon to play with, Latkes to eat.<br>
And while we are playing,<br>
The candles are burning low.<br>
One for each night, they shed a sweet light.<br>
To remind us of days long ago.”</p>

<p>This had earned Buffy a grateful kiss, which had Xander whistling at the
intensity of it, and Willow blushing to beat her hair when she had finally
relented on the out of breath Slayer.  Each night, after a traditional
Hanukkah meal, which Buffy and her mom took turns in preparing, a candle had
been lit. Willow said the Hanukkah prayer while lighting the candle, and as
she did so, she was shocked once again as Buffy joined in, her melodic voice
adding to the richness of Willow’s own. After that, they would play the
dreidel game, Xander usually winning most of the pots, which consisted of
chocolate coins that Buffy had bought for the occasion.  At some point
during the evening, Buffy would present Willow with a Hanukkah present,
watching in delight as she opened the tiny tokens of her affection.  The
charm bracelet that dangled from Willow’s wrist had been her favorite, but
each of the gifts was accepted with love.</p>

<p>After all of the effort that Buffy put into making this year’s Hanukkah
special for her, Willow was just as determined to make this Christmas just
as special.</P>

<p align=center>****</p>

<p>Oz was just getting up when they came downstairs, he was just finishing
rolling up the sleeping bag he had used to sleep in on the couch for the
past two weeks.  “Merry Christmas, guys.”  He said, in greeting, noticing
the rosy glow the two women had about them, and trying not to let it bother
him.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Oz.”  Buffy and Willow greeted at roughly the same time,
and grinned at each other in reflex.  “How’s the couch treating ya?”  Buffy
asked, a slight smirk quirking at her lips.  Oz had pretty much settled into
the new routine around here, but Buffy sometimes still couldn’t resist
teasing him.  The ‘Nya Nya’ principle was still alive and well.</p>

<p>“Not bad.”  Oz commented, choosing to ignore the ache in his lower back that
had seemed to settle there.  He finished tying the sleeping bag closed then
excused himself, so he could go put it in the van.  Oz and Xander ran into
each other as one was coming in and the other was going out.  They gave each
other a cordial Merry Christmas before they continued on their way.</p>

<p>“Let it snow…let it snow…let it snow.”  Xander belted the song out as he
entered the house, Anya in tow, carrying an armful of presents.  He put them
under the tree, as Buffy and Willow greeted their friends in the living
room.</p>

<p>“Buff…Will…how decadent.”  Xander said, noticing the matching bath robes.
“Not going to dress for the occasion?”  He asked, eyeing the similar dressed
women with an appreciative eye.</p>

<p>“We thought we’d get dressed after the present unwrapping thing.”  Willow
explained, flushing brightly as she remembered the true reason for their
present state of dress.  Buffy’s blue eyes lit up as she watched Willow go
into the kitchen, the little sashay of her walk making her breathe a little
faster in appreciation.</p>

<p>“I’ve said it before, and I shall say it again.  Christmas at eight-five
degrees is positively obscene.”  Giles greeted the group, wiping his sweat
covered brow as he sat the large pile of presents he carried in his arms
beside the Christmas tree, then took the bottle of wine he carried
precariously in his arm pit into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Buffy watched him with amused eyes, knowing that he still missed the
Christmases he had held in England, but was glad that he could bear with the
weather enough to be with her for the holidays.  The watcher was almost like
a second father to her.  And Christmas, this Christmas especially, would not
be the same without him.</p>

<p>Xander eyed the huge pile of presents that surrounded the Christmas tree and
rubbed his hands together enthusiastically.  “I get to be Santa.”  He said,
his eyes lighting up at the thought.</p>

<p>“This is a silly tradition.”  Anya commented, caustically, but she was
ignored for the most part by Xander and Buffy who were both contemplating
the presents at the moment.  She sat down with an impatient huff in the
recliner, still unhappy with Xander for stopping her attempts this morning
to have sex.  Xander had been in a hurry to get over here to open gifts and
it had put her in a rather sour mood.</p>

<p>“Are we ready to start?”  Xander asked, casting a glance at the kitchen door
as he wondered what was taking the others so long.  Joyce chose that moment
to come through the door carrying a tray of sweet rolls and an urn full of
coffee, sugar and cream.  Willow came out behind her, carrying a teapot full
of apple-cinnamon herbal tea for the non-caffeine drinkers.  They sat the
breakfast treats on the coffee table, and everyone gathered around to get
their fill.</p>

<p>They were all eager to get to the main festivities of the day, so they
gathered around the tree, Anya stayed in the recliner, Xander was going to
be passing out presents so she found no reason to move.  Oz sat down on the
floor, not far from her, Joyce sat in the overstuffed chair, which Giles
perched precariously on the arm of, and Buffy and Willow sat together on the
sofa.</p>

<p>Xander passed the presents out, the epitome of the perfect ‘Santa’, waiting
for each of them to open their presents so they could ooh, and ah, over what
they received before he moved on.</p>

<p>Willow’s treasures piled up, she smiled as she unwrapped every baby toy that
Buffy hadn’t been able to resist buying.  Buffy had been right of course,
having received the same kind of thing from her Mother and Willow.  They
received non-baby items as well of course, but most of their presents
consisted of things for the baby.</p>

<p>Giles most prized treasure he received from Joyce.  It was a hardbound copy
of the Charles Dickens classic, “A Christmas carol.”  “Thank you, Joyce.
I’ve always appreciated this timeless classic…in fact, when I was a young
lad growing up in England, my father used to read it to me every Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Hey, maybe you could read it later, Giles.”  Buffy said, shrugging at the
odd look she got from Xander.  “It would be nice to start some traditions.”
A gentle rub of Willow’s belly was all the answer Xander needed for the
perceived loss of the Slayer’s mind.</p>

<p>Giles just smiled sedately at the Slayer and nodded his head.  “I think that
can be arranged.”  Buffy grinned back at him in thanks.</p>

<p>Joyce received a gold heart shaped locket from Giles, with pictures of Buffy
and the slayerettes inside.  When she looked at Giles in question, he
replied.  “You once accused me of trying to take your daughter away.”  He
said simply, not wanting to bring up bad memories on such a splendid day.
“This is kind of my way of letting you see that she was always yours, I was
just graced to be a part of her life.”</p>

<p>Joyce nodded, swallowing a little at the sentiment, then looked him directly
in the eyes.  “I’m glad you are a part of her life.  I always want you to
be.”  They exchanged a long look of understanding, and then the air cleared
around them as the present exchange continued.</p>

<p>Buffy watched their exchange with curious eyes, receiving an elbow by her
couch companion who noticed her distracted state.  They looked at each
other, then back at Joyce and Giles and just shrugged.  Whatever was
happening wasn’t really any of their business, and Buffy wasn’t all too sure
that she wanted to know.</p>

<p>Finally Xander looked under the tree to see if he had missed any presents,
but the tree was as barren as when they had first brought the large firtree
in here, except of course for the lights and bulbs that decorated it.
“Well, that’s all of them.” He said, looking around at the mess of wrapping
paper and unwrapped presents that littered the living room.  Everyone seemed
to be happy with what they had received, and even Xander had to admit that
he was pleased by the presents he had received.</p>

<p>“Actually, Xander…there’s one more…but it isn’t under the tree.”  Buffy
said, hesitantly, her eyes resting on Willow, lightly.</p>

<p>“Ah, yeah…I agree, that’s quite the present you have there, Buff.”  Xander
said, thinking that she meant the unborn babe that at the very moment was
growing inside Willow.</p>

<p>“Huh?”  Buffy turned her head, distracted from her perusal of Willow’s
loveliness by Xander’s comment.  “Oh yeah.  Well, that too.”  Buffy said,
blushing slightly.</p>

<p>“Well…if that wasn’t what you meant, what did you mean?”  Xander asked,
confused, sitting down on the floor beside Anya’s chair.</p>

<p>As Buffy looked around at the faces of her family and friends, she decided
that now was the right time to say what she really needed to say, and to let
them all know how much she cared about them, especially the red-head sitting
curled up at her side.  “You know all of you guys mean so much to me.  I
don’t think I could have gotten through half of the things I’ve been through
without your support and love.  So, I wanted to just take the time to thank
you for all you’ve done for me.” She met all of their eyes individually,
expressing her feelings through the deep blueness of her own.</p>

<p>“But there’s one person in this room, that I don’t think I could stand to
live without.  Someone who’s taught me what it means to be a true friend,
and what it really means to love somebody totally, and unconditionally and
have them love you back the same way.”  Her eyes met Willow’s and she lost
herself in the deep expanse of green, completely forgetting the other people
in the room that sat watching.  She took the red head’s hand in hers,
holding it gently as she communicated the words of love that she’d always
wanted to say.  “Will, you’ve already given me so much.  An ear when I
needed to talk, a shoulder when I needed to cry, a mouth when I needed
reassurance, and a hand when I needed guidance.  You’ve given me the best
gift any person could ever be graced with.”  She slipped to her knees,
caressing the belly where her child grew with a trembling hand and tried
desperately not to cry the tears she felt building in her eyes.  “If I lived
to be a hundred, it wouldn’t be long enough to show you how much you mean to
me…and all I want to do…is spend the rest of my life showing you how much I
love you.”</p>

<p>The room held it’s collective breath as they waited for the question they
knew was coming. Giles and Joyce cast a brief glance at each other, reading
the love and hope in each other’s eyes before they turned their attention
back on the pair before them.</p>

<p>Buffy gulped the tears of emotion out of her way, as she took out the small
square box out of the pocket of her bathrobe.  She could see the silver of
tears building in Willow’s eyes and her heart filled with love at the sight.
  She opened the box with trembling hands, displaying the diamond ring that
rested in the red velvet within.  “Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>Willow bit her trembling lip and nodded her head, trying not to burst into
happy tears.  “What was that?  I didn’t quite hear you.”  Buffy teased her
lightly, with a trembling voice, her own tears starting to slip unheeded
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Yes.”  Willow whispered softly.  “Yes, I’ll marry you.”  She said, louder
as she wrapped her arms around her neck and hugged her tightly.  Buffy put
the ring down gently, before she hugged her back enthusiastically, her arms
tightening around the red head’s waist.  “I love you.”  Buffy said, kissing
the top of Willow’s head.</p>

<p>“I love you so much.” Willow whispered back, fiercely.  They stayed like
that for a long time, feeling the waves of love floating through them then
Buffy pulled back, picking up the ring from where she had put it on the
floor.  She took the ring out of the box, then slipped it on the red head’s
finger, consciously controlling the tremors that shook her whole hand.
Seeing the sparkling ring on her soulmate’s finger made Buffy want to cry
again, but she simply kissed the shaking hand, then pulled Willow back into
her arms, cradling the woman she held dearest to her heart, against her.</p>

<p>Everyone gave them a few moments to bask in their love, then they surrounded
the happy couple, congratulating them at the new dimension in their
ever-changing relationship.  Buffy and Willow accepted them graciously,
receiving warm hugs from Joyce, Giles and Xander.  Oz shook Buffy’s hand
awkwardly conceding that the best person had indeed won.  Buffy gave him an
impish grin, then hugged the startled guitar player enthusiastically.  It
was indeed, a very happy Christmas.</p>

<p>While Joyce prepared the Christmas dinner, with Giles help, Oz and Xander
watched the Christmas movie marathon that was playing on television.  Buffy
and Willow disappeared for an hour upstairs, but when they returned, they
were both fully dressed, and their smiles were brighter than the still
twinkling lights on the Christmas tree.  They finished watching National
Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation with Xander and Oz, their happy laughter
filling the living room, and edging into the kitchen where Joyce and Giles
sent tolerant looks at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“This has truly been a remarkable holiday.”  Giles noted, watching Joyce as
she checked on the bird that was roasting in the oven.</p>

<p>She finished basting the bird, closing the oven door before straightening up
to look at him.  “I certainly wasn’t expecting that.  Were you?”  Joyce
asked, referring to Buffy’s earlier proposal.</p>

<p>Giles shook his head.  “No…I think she caught us all by surprise…especially
Willow.  She turned so pale I was surprised she didn’t faint.”</p>

<p>Joyce chuckled at the image.  “I was surprised Buffy managed to get the
words out.  Did you see how badly she was shaking.”  Joyce shook her head in
amusement.  “Poor girl.” She chuckled again in sympathy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen her shake that badly.”  Giles agreed.  Buffy
had faced the worst of the Hellmouths horrors without coming as unglued as
she had been on bended knee in front of Willow.</p>

<p>Joyce smiled at the memory, then gazed at him with soulful eyes.  “You’re
not sorry that we’re not…” She hedged at the question, not sure how to
finish it.</p>

<p>“No.  This is their day…our day will come soon enough.”  Giles sighed,
placing a tender kiss on Joyce’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Hey, is the food ready yet.  I’m starving.”  Xander called from the living
room, disturbing the mood.</p>

<p>Giles cast a baleful look at the door, annoyed at the interruption.  “No.
Not yet, Xander.”  Joyce smiled at Giles’ annoyance and kissed him lightly
on the chin, before she turned back to the feast preparations.</p>

<p>Home Alone 2 was just wrapping up when Joyce called them to the table for
dinner.  Buffy helped Giles set the table.  Then everyone gathered around
the long wooden table in the dining room, and Giles proposed a toast,
lifting his glass of wine, Buffy and Willow had their wine glasses filled
with caffeine free Ginger ail.  “This could possibly be the best Christmas
I’ve ever had.  I’m surrounded by all the people that I care about, and I
couldn’t think of a better way to spend this holiday.  I propose this toast
to Joyce for making this splendid feast which we are about to consume, to
Buffy and Willow for stepping out on that limb of love together…and to
everyone here for making this holiday one to remember.”  The glasses met
with a clink, and they drank to the toast enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The food was consumed in the natural way, everyone eating far more than they
should and ending up looking like they were vying to match Willow in the
pregnancy corner. “Anybody up for pie?”  Joyce asked, wryly, receiving a
round of groans for her trouble.</p>

<p>“Uh…maybe later mom.”  Buffy replied, patting her extended stomach, a slight
grimace crossing her face.  “I really shouldn’t have eaten so much.”  Willow
looked at her appraisingly, reaching over to feel the rounded tummy.  She
nodded in sympathy before commenting.  “You’re bigger than I am, now.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Will.”  Buffy said, wryly.</p>

<p>“Anytime.”  She chirped, grinning impishly before kissing her lightly.  She
stood up, stretching before she pulled Buffy up out of her chair.  “We’ll
clean up.”  Willow offered, starting to grab the plates and silverware off
of the table, while Buffy grabbed the leftover food.</p>

<p>“You know…this will get cleaned up faster if we all help.”  Giles said,
giving a meaningful look to Oz and Xander.  The boys hopped up like they had
been kicked, and started cleaning up the table.</p>

<p>Things were cleaned up in record time, and they soon found themselves back
in the living room, sipping contentedly on hot cocoa and warm apple cider.
Giles began reading “A Christmas carol” in his deep soothing voice, relaxing
the group gathered around the tree.  Willow lay ensconced in Buffy’s arms,
her head lying on Buffy’s chest.  Buffy’s arm was wrapped around Willow’s
stomach, their hands entwined, a carefree thumb playing with the ring that
rested securely on Willow’s ring finger.  Buffy watched as the ring sparkled
in the glow cast off by the Christmas tree and had to agree with Tiny Tim’s
sentiment.  “God Bless us, Every One.”</p>
