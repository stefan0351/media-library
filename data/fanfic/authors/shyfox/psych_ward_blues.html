<p align=center><i>Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night,<br>
And wondered where you were?<br>
You need your one and only that can hold you tight,<br>
And you reach for her.<br>
But she’s not with you.<br>
You just wish this trip would end.<br>
You know I’ve been there.<br>
I don’t want to go back again.</i></p>

<p align=center><i>--Clint Black and Steve Wariner</i></p>

<p>Awareness came slowly to the young woman lying on the small, vynal mattress.
She reached out blindly for the soft form that should be sleeping beside
her, but her hand didn’t go very far, as her arm was bound to the bed. Her
other arm had been strapped down above her head, and she could feel her feet
had been bound to either corner of the bed. She opened her eyes slowly, to
discover it did her little good as she was greeted by the darkness around
her. Her limbs tightened uselessly in reflex to the unusual circumstances in
which she found herself in, but the bonds that bound her didn’t allow for
much movement. She fought back panic that wanted to arise in her at waking
in such an unusual manner, and forced herself to stay calm as she tried to
figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>She tried to remember how she had come to be in such a predicament, closing
her eyes to shut out the oppressive darkness and letting her mind drift in
search of the answers. She remembered kissing Willow before leaving the
house...she had let her slaying slack off a bit since she found out about
the baby, spending less time out in the darkness killing vampires and more
time at home holding her pregnant lover. Giles had let it go for a short
while, but he had finally reminded her of her sacred duty to slay vampires,
and patrol the night, ensuring the safety of others while she put herself at
risk...Okay, so there was a bit of her own sarcasm shining through, but she
thought she deserved some at the present moment.</p>

<p>She had patrolled the usual haunts: the old tunnels, the cemeteries...all
five of them, the park...the University of SunnyDale’s campus, and had
dispatched twelve vampires back to hell...all in all a pretty successful
evening.</p>

<p>She was heading back home when she spotted a gray van stopping ahead of her
in the street. Under the streetlamp’s glow, she noticed a strange logo on
the side of the van. She couldn’t make out what it was, so she had gotten
closer to get a better look, her curiosity getting the better of her.</p>

<p>The next thing she knew, she heard a loud pop and felt a strange tingling
pain fill her shoulder. Looking down, she noticed a dart sticking out of her
shoulder. She was irate as she plucked the offending item from her shoulder.
She heard the van’s door opening, and she looked up quickly, noticing
several men jumping out of the van and rushing toward her.</p>

<p>She panicked as she felt a dizzy feeling filling her head, and managed to
knock the first two for a loop, but whatever they had hit her with was
strong and it was affecting her fast. One guy managed to get a hand clamped
around her mouth, so that she wouldn’t scream, she supposed, and wrapped
another arm tightly around her waist, lifting her off of her feet. A second
guy grabbed a hold of her actively swinging legs, taking a shot in the groin
for his trouble, much to her satisfaction. He groaned dropping his hold on
her, but two more were ready to take his place and she was weakening
quickly. A dark haze was dropping over her as she struggled to get a good
look at her attackers, but their faces were all covered with masks.</p>

<p>She felt them carrying her to their van, the rough jostling as they moved
increasing her dizziness as nausea erupted in her stomach. She remembered
vomiting on one of them just before she had been tossed roughly into the
van, scraping the skin off of the palms of her hands and biting her tongue
as she landed roughly on her face. The darkness had conquered her then as
she slid into a nice, safe oblivion.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes again, noticing that they had adjusted to the darkness.
She was in a small room, not much bigger than a walk-in closet. The bed that
she lay on had no sheets and it smelled faintly of old, stale urine. She
shuddered at the thought of having to stay on this mattress until her need
to pee outweighed her need for self-esteem. She could see a fraction of
light coming through a small square that was either a very small window, or
a peephole cut into the door so that anyone in this room could be observed
from the outside. She didn’t notice anyone looking in, so she carefully
tested the restraints to see if she could get out of them.</p>

<p>After struggling for several long minutes, she realized the futility of her
struggle and let out a sigh of frustration. She felt weak as a newborn
puppy, and it angered her. Normally she could break a restraint like that in
about two seconds flat. She was obviously still drugged. They probably had
plans to keep her that way, too.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Willow woke up the next morning feeling an emptiness wash through as she
felt Buffy’s empty pillow beside her. She felt an uneasiness start in the
pit of her stomach, and she was unable to quell it as she got up and
dressed. Maybe Buffy had gotten up already? Willow tried to calm herself,
but Buffy usually slept in on the mornings when she had stayed out so late.
Their spring classes hadn’t started yet, so it wasn’t like she had to be to
class early. And she really couldn’t remember her sneaking into bed last
night. Feeling a panic start to rise up inside of her, Willow ran down the
stairs, her eyes scanning every room for her wayward lover.</p>

<p>She ran into Joyce when she entered the kitchen, and her green eyes conveyed
her panic to the older woman. "Have you seen Buffy? Did she come home last
night?"</p>

<p>"You haven’t seen her?" Joyce asked, her own worry starting to reflect in
her eyes. As Willow shook her head, Joyce fought down her own panic. "Okay,
now I’m worried...I mean, I know she’s the Slayer and she can handle
herself, but..." Her voice drained away as she allowed herself to imagine
all of the terrible things that could have happened to her daughter.</p>

<p>"I’m calling Giles...and Xander." Willow said, her voice a little shaky as
she tried to keep her growing sense of doom under control. "They can start
searching her usual patrol area, and I’ll hack into the police system and
see if anybody fitting her description was entered into it. Don’t worry
Joyce...we’ll find her." A quiet determination settled over the red head’s
face, and Joyce was compelled to believe her...just because Willow believed
it so much.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The loud clanging of the door opening stirred Buffy from the daze she had
fallen into. She turned her head and watched as a short attractive woman
flitted into the room. She had a cheerful expression on her face, a clear
dichotomy to the atmosphere surrounding them.</p>

<p>"Good morning. How are you feeling today?" Buffy could tell by the nametag
pinned to her blouse that her name was Rachel.</p>

<p>"As well as can be expected, considering I’m strapped to a bed." Buffy said,
flexing her hands slightly, to emphasize her current condition.</p>

<p>"Well, you were quite a handful last night...started hallucinating and
pushing some of the other clients around. It was necessary to restrain and
sedate you." Rachel said, offering her a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"I don’t remember that." Buffy said, suspiciously. "Why am I here? What is
this place?" She asked, even though she had a pretty good idea.</p>

<p>"You don’t remember?" Rachel asked, a small frown crossing her face. Buffy
shook her head. "You are in a Crises Stabilization Unit. You tried to jump
off a bridge. A lifeguard saved you from drowning and brought you here.
You’ve been here for the past few days."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head, an expression of complete disbelief crossing her face.
Why was the woman making up stories? Did she know why she was really here?
Did she know how she came to be here? She decided it might be better not to
argue too much, at least until she could figure out where she was and how
she could get out of here. "Can you let me up? I really have to pee."</p>

<p>Rachel looked like she was mulling something over in her head, then she
stepped forward and released the straps. Buffy rubbed the circulation back
into her wrists as she watched as her feet were released. She sat up slowly,
still feeling slightly dizzy from the medication that still ran through her
veins.</p>

<p>"We will be going down to breakfast soon. You can rest in your room until
then." Rachel said, leading the way to Buffy’s ‘room’. They passed several
rooms on their way down the long empty hall. The linoleum felt cold under
her bare feet, and she wondered where her socks and shoes had ended up. The
room that she was led to was practically bare, holding nothing more than a
bed, with bureau drawers built into the frame, and a small bedside table.
Buffy sat down on the small bed feeling the vinyl crackle beneath her.</p>

<p>Rachel looked at her with some kindness showing in her eyes. "Try to get
some rest, Sarah. The bathroom is the next room over." Rachel turned to
leave, as Buffy was still trying to sort through what the woman had just
called her.</p>

<p>"Excuse me? My name is Buffy."</p>

<p>"Sarah." Rachel said, staring at Buffy strangely.</p>

<p>"My name is Buffy...Buffy Summers." Buffy enunciated clearly.</p>

<p>‘Poor Delusional girl.’ The nurse thought, sparing Buffy a look of pity.
"Okay, Buffy. You want to be called Buffy now, I’ll let the other’s know,
okay?" The woman backed out of the room, giving Buffy a weak smile, and
Buffy shook her head in wonder.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, I have got to get out of here."</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the crises unit was decidedly depressing, Buffy reflected
as she walked around the large common room, keeping a close eye on the
other’s locked up in here with her.</p>

<p>They were a strange assortment: One guy was sitting over in a corner of the
room talking to himself. She kept hearing him mumble ‘Santa Maria help me to
pee-a." Or something like that. Another older woman kept grinning at her
toothlessly when she would glance over at her. ‘Somebody stole my false
teeth.’ she complained. Buffy shrugged her shoulders in sympathy.</p>

<p>This one old guy wouldn’t leave her alone. He kept following her around
claiming, "I am the Mayor of SunnyDale, and I order you to let me out!"</p>

<p>"I can’t let you out, buddy...I can’t even let me out." She grumbled back at
him. He got a confused look on his face and went away for a short while,
though Buffy knew that he’d be back.</p>

<p>It was easy to lose track of the days in here. There were no Calenders on
the wall...just a clock on the wall, high up near the ceiling which
displayed the time. Every day the same thing happened at the same time. They
went down to breakfast at 7:30 sharp every day...there was designated times
to smoke and have coffee...designated times to sit in a circle and talk
about why you were there...Buffy usually chose to pass when it came to her
turn. It was absolute torture for the overly active Slayer. She knew she had
been here for three days already, by the number of strands of her hair that
she had plucked from her head. One strand for each miserable day that she
spent in this place that was strangely reminiscent of that other place she
had visited called Hell. They lay as silent reminders on her bedside table,
she hoped that she got out of here before she plucked herself bald.</p>

<p>She had yet to see a doctor or a therapist, she supposed it was because it
was the weekend. She only knew that because they had been allowed to watch a
movie last night. Big thrill! Considering most of the people had talked
through it. She really didn’t want to see ‘Ferris Bueler’s Day Off’ again,
anyway.</p>

<p>When allowed she mostly stayed in her room, sitting on her bed and staring
out through the small, barred window at the long wooden fence that seemed to
surround the place. It was at least ten feet high. She guessed they didn’t
want anybody to try and jump over it...not that it would stop her if she was
up to full strength. Her Slayer strength was non-existent, in fact, she felt
weaker than a person her age should be. She thought it might have to do with
the three little white pills she was required to take every day at seven in
the morning. When she first took them she could barely stand...feeling a
large amount of dizziness send her reeling. One of the techs usually had to
help her on her way to breakfast to keep from falling over. As the day wore
on she would feel herself start to get stronger as the pills effects wore
off, but she was still no where near her Slayer strength. She knew she would
have to stop taking the pills before she would even be able to think about
getting out of this place. She hadn’t figured out a way to do that yet, the
Nurse would make her open her mouth after she had taken the medication,
making sure she had swallowed them before she went on her way.</p>

<p>The scary part was, she was beginning to like how she felt on the stuff. She
felt distanced from her problems in a way she hadn’t felt since she was
fifteen. There were no vampires in here, no real ones anyway, although one
of her fellow inmates claimed to be one. She had quickly disproved this by
pulling the woman forcibly into a bathroom and showing her the reflection in
the mirror. The woman had screamed in her face, and for her trouble, she had
found herself being thrown out of the bathroom, and landing with a thump on
the common room floor.</p>

<p>What really troubled her about this place though, was the utter isolation
that she felt. She was cut off from the outside world, away from everybody
that she loved, and she found herself missing Willow with an aching
intensity. There were a couple of phones for them to use, but every time she
went to use one it was already being used by someone else, and the one time
she had been able to use it she kept getting an annoying recording from some
mechanical operator. "I’m sorry...the number you have called can not be
completed as dialed." She had finally slammed the phone down in
exasperation, her body sagging against the wall as she tried to keep the
futile tears from falling. She wondered what her lover was doing, if she
missed her, and if she had been looking for her. Of course, if she hadn’t
been so high, she would have known the answer to those questions almost
instinctively.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>For the past three days, Giles, Xander, Oz and Anya had searched the city of
SunnyDale for any trace of the missing Slayer. They started very early in
the morning, when the sun was just rising over the horizon, and didn’t stop
until very late at night. They searched any place from the burned down high
school, to the sewers...encountering a few vampires for their trouble(which
they staked with a minimum of trouble), but their searches were fruitless,
and the futility was pulling at their souls.
Anya was the first to give up the search. "You know, if the Slayer really
wanted to be found we would have found her by now." She said, grumpily,
climbing up out of the sewer that they had been trudging through for the
past three hours.</p>

<p>"Anya..." Xander called up after her, shaking his head at the outspokenness
of his ex-demon lover. "Sorry about that...but she might have a point...It’s
not like Buffy hasn’t disappeared before." Xander said, reminiscing about
the other time Buffy had disappeared off the face of the Earth. After she
had defeated Acathla and sent Angel’s soul to Hell.</p>

<p>Oz and Giles were less likely to agree with Xander’s statement. One, because
they just couldn’t stand the thought of going back and facing Willow empty
handed. And two, because they really didn’t think Buffy would just run off
like that again. Especially not now. "Well...it is true we’re not having
much success down here...maybe my contacts will have better luck. And...I’ll
call Angel, if she turns up in L. A., he might be useful in locating her."
Giles sighed, scratching a bit of muck out of his hair.</p>

<p>Xander and Oz shrugged their shoulders and nodded their heads wearily. The
three men made their way to the ladder and started climbing up, their hearts
heavy with their lack of success.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>
Back at the house, Willow’s internet search was proving just as fruitless.
Her running bots all came back with negative reply’s and Willow felt a surge
of aimless anger rise up within her...making her want to pick up her laptop
and shatter it against the nearest wall. The surge of rage both surprised
and scared her, and she sank back in her chair, letting tears of exhaustion
dot her cheeks.</p>

<p>Joyce came into the living room, carrying a cup of Chamomile tea for the
young woman and found her crying. Her brow furrowed in sympathy, she put the
cup of tea down on the coffee table, and rested her hand on Willow’s
shoulder in a comforting gesture. "You’ve been working hard...why don’t you
go upstairs and rest for a while."</p>

<p>Willow shook her head, more tears falling from her red rimmed eyes. "I
can’t...I can’t rest until I know she’s all right."</p>

<p>Joyce sighed, and knelt in front of her. "Willow, I know you’re worried...I
am too...but you also have to think about what all of this stress is doing
to the baby." Willow met Joyce’s eyes, worried guilt shining from the depth
of her soul. "She loves that baby more than life itself...and I’m sure she
would want you to be taking care of yourself now and the baby, so that when
she get’s back, you can take care of her."</p>

<p>"Do you think she’s hurt somewhere?" Willow asked, watching Joyce wince as
the subtext behind her words was brought to her attention.</p>

<p>Joyce inhaled slowly, thinking about what she wanted to say. She wondered if
she should be straightforward with the young woman that sat inches in front
of her, but she knew Willow was strong...she would have to be if she was to
be married to her daughter...and she could see the steal in the young
woman’s backbone behind the startling green of her eyes. "I don’t think she
would ever leave you willingly. Wherever she is, I don’t think she’s there
by choice."</p>

<p>Willow paled at the words, then nodded her head slowly, a determination
rekindling in her eyes. "I think you’re right. Which is why I can’t give up
the search...not yet." Joyce nodded in understanding, then stood slowly,
still communicating her worry with her eyes. "I’ll drink my tea,
though...thanks." Willow said, smiling wanly at her as she took a sip. She
waited until Joyce had left the room before she started scanning the
internet anew, her fingers flying over the keyboard.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>
Needless to say, Willow was not at all pleased when she was informed of the
group’s decision to stop scanning the city by foot. "Stop? How can you just
stop?!" She asked, outraged as her friends surrounded her in a circle.
"She’s out there somewhere and she’s in trouble. I can feel it." She pleaded
with her friends, begging them not to give up the search. "You know, Buffy
wouldn’t just give up on you."</p>

<p>"She’s not out there, Will. We’ve searched...everywhere...she’s nowhere to
be seen." Xander defended the group, feeling like Willow had just kicked
them in the teeth.</p>

<p>"You searched the entire city of SunnyDale? Somehow I find that hard to
believe." She said, sarcastically, her eyes shooting green fire at her
hapless friend.</p>

<p>"What do you think we’ve been doing out there for the past three days, Will?
Twiddling our thumbs?!" Xander shouted, exasperated. After all, he was just
as worried about their missing friend as she was.</p>

<p>"That’s quite enough, Xander." Giles interrupted their argument with a well
arched brow. They were both getting a little out of hand, though he supposed
that it was to be expected with the high amounts of emotion that were
running about. He turned to face Willow, laying a gentle hand on her
shoulder...unwittingly on the same one Joyce had earlier. "We’re not giving
up, Willow. But it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack out there. We
may be able to hunt for her better from here, where I can utilize the
telephone to reach my contacts and find out if she’s turned up someplace
else."</p>

<p>"She wouldn’t just leave, Giles. Our wedding is coming up...not to mention
the baby. Why would she leave?" She read the look on Giles face quite
clearly, although he tried to cover it up and she shook her head vehemently.
"No. She wouldn’t just abandon me like that. There has to be another
explanation. If she left, it wasn’t voluntary, someone else is behind this
and I intend to find out who."</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>
The shrink’s office, Buffy found herself sitting in, wasn’t what she had
expected in this kind of an office. There was no leather couch for a person
to lay on, a perfect position to encourage them to spill all of their
problems out to the all knowing Physician. Instead, Buffy found herself
sitting in a hard leather lined chair staring at an empty white wall. "Well
this place is as depressing as the place I was before. She had been led here
earlier by a tech, and left sitting here with the door closed waiting for
the Doctor. Who, from the plaque resting on the desk, appeared to be named
Dr. Reynolds. She supposed if she had wanted to, she could have gotten up
and left. But there was no point to it, really. The whole place was locked
up tighter than a kettle drum. If she wanted to get out of here, she would
have to borrow a set of those nifty keys that opened every door in this
place.</p>

<p>She was just starting to contemplate how she would go about doing that, when
the Doctor entered the office. They stood staring at each other for a
moment, as if sizing each other up, then the man moved over to his desk and
sat down, shuffling through a bunch of papers, until he seemed to find what
he was looking for and spread a chart out before him. He was an older man,
appearing to be about Giles age, with silver hair and a goatee. He looked up
from the chart, and she met his silver-blue eyes unflinchingly.</p>

<p>"So, Sarah, it looks like you’ve been giving our people quite a handful."
Dr. Reynolds, started off, his voice soft yet egotistical, though he tried
to make it appear as congenial as possible.</p>

<p>"Why do you people keep calling me that? My name is Buffy." Buffy said,
frustrated with the mistaken identity.</p>

<p>"That name is part of your illness, Sarah. A name you have made up to go
along with your made up existence. It’s time to stop living in your dream
world Sarah, and start living in the real one. That’s why you’re here, so we
can help you to make the transition. Until you let go of your fantasy, and
embrace your reality I’m afraid we’re going to be forced to keep you here."</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>She walked alone through a deserted part of town, where the street lamps
barely lit a corner of the street, and the buildings were rundown, boarded
up desertions of a former life. The burnt out sign of a once prosperous
movie theater, hung precariously from one long chain, the other dangling
across the sidewalk, like one half of a child’s neglected jumprope. The
street was lined with old trash that careless people had thrown away without
a care of where it landed, and shattered glass, from windows that had been
broken before they had been boarded, and old beer and soda bottles.</p>

<p>It struck her odd that she would be walking barefoot through all of this
mess, but what really struck her weird is she couldn’t remember how she had
gotten here, or where here was.</p>

<p>The sound of a bottle breaking drew her attention to a darkened alley, the
sound of a fight echoing clearly between the two close walls, and she found
herself staring into the deep black that surrounded the alley ominously, as
if she could dertermine what danger may lie ahead. She stepped warily
closer, feeling the adrenaline start to rush through her as her heart
pounded wildly in her chest. She knocked over a stack of crates
accidentally, her nervous tension making her clumsy, and she heard a cat
screech, disliking her for disturbing it’s home. This threw her already
palpitating heart high into her throat and she was left gasping for breath
as the small, dark form of the feline ran across her path. She took a
steadying breath, to settle her nerves, then stepped further into the alley,
not sure what strange compulsion she followed as she entered the foreboding
place. She could hear deep laughter up ahead, which was followed by a
sickening slurping sound that made her feel Queezy to her stomach.</p>

<p>As she rounded a stack of crates, she came upon the sight that was causing
such a commotion. Three disfigured vampires appeared silhouted by a trash
can fire, their eyes glowing with an unnatural fire as they chowed down on a
freshly caught, still wiggling, terrified female. The terrified teenager
couldn’t get a scream out past the pointed teeth that filled her neck from
either side, so she made a strange gurgling sound instead, as blood flowed
copiously down the torn throat. The third vampire was taking a bite out of
the girl’s wrist, sucking at the sweet blood that flowed from her arterial
vein. The smell of fresh urine filled the small crowded space of the
alleyway, and she wrinkled her nose as the scent hit her, knowing the young
girl’s bladder had just let go. The poor girl’s eyes had sunk back into her
head and she knew she was too late to save her.</p>

<p>The sight of them feeding filled her with rage, as she stepped forward out
of the darkness and confronted them in the light of the trash fire. "Is this
a private party, guys? Or can anybody play?" She heard herself ask.</p>

<p>It was kinda comical the way all three of their heads picked up at the same
time. "Slayer!" She heard them snarl, and she unaccountably smiled at the
amount of malice in their tone.</p>

<p>"Slayees." She grinned, and just as she was readying herself to fight them,
the scene vanished from view, leaving her not so much in darkness, but in an
empty void, vacant of anyone or anything.
She was beginning to wonder what the heck had happened when a voice entered
the void.</p>

<p>"You must remember Sarah, that the name you have been using, you have chosen
as a part of your fantasy world. A reality that in fact does not exist
outside of your own mind. If you are ever to experience a happy life you
will need to let go of the demons that haunt you." She found herself annoyed
with the condescending tone the voice used...as if the voice knew better
than she did about her own self.</p>

<p>"Ah, what would you know." She muttered to herself.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The void lifted and she found herself in a line of scared, ratty looking
teenagers wearing what looked like old, worn out, cut up sheets. They faced
a hideous looking demon, that had a big bulbous head, and an arm in the
shape of a big hard club.</p>

<p>"You are nobody. You are nothing. You do not exist except to serve us." She
could hear the demon speaking as he walked up the line, measuring the worth
of each teen with hard eyes, probably estimating how many years of service
he could get out of this pathetic looking bunch.</p>

<p>He stopped at what was apparently the head of the line, in front of a scared
shaken teenager, who looked like he might’ve been the picked on class geek
in high school. "What is your name?" He asked the boy, he asked in a hard
growl, watching in delight as the young male tried to stutter out his
answer.</p>

<p>"T.T-t-Tim." He was clobbered for his trouble and ended up in a painful
heap, his breath seeping from him, as he wheezed in pain.</p>

<p>The demon walked up to the next teen and repeated the statement. "N-no one."
The shaken male replied and the demon moved on satisfied.</p>

<p>This was continued down the line each teen answering with "Nobody" or "No
one." until the demon came to where she stood, her eyes down cast as he
stopped right in front of her.</p>

<p>"Name?" The demon asked/stated, confident in his success in cowering the
teens.</p>

<p>That was until vibrant blue eyes lifted to stare unflinchingly into his and
a wicked smile twisted the feminine lips. "I’m Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,
and you are?" She asked him coyly, catching his arm as he swung it at her
head. She broke it easily, taking him down to the ground as he screamed in
pain. She took out his partner just as easily, then looked back at the
petrified teens. "Anybody who’s not having fun here? Follow me." She felt
the familiar feeling of strength flowing through her for the split second
before she was taken back to the void, and that annoying voice
reappeared...draining her of her strength.</p>

<p>"You must let go of your dream world. You serve nothing from clinging onto
it except further distancing yourself from reality."</p>

<p>"It’s the only one I know." She whispered, to the unrelenting void.</p>

<p>She stood in sunlight, the roar of the ocean echoing in her ears as she
stood in front of a herd of people, all here to help her celebrate the
happiest day of her life. The vision in white walking steadily toward her
made her breath catch in her throat. Her love’s hair was shining red beneath
the white veil, and the dress fit her perfectly, hanging loosely at her
sides, and accentuating all of the right places.</p>

<p>She felt herself swelling with pride as she watched the envious looks from
all the men around her. Knowing she had won the red-head’s heart fair and
square, and that she was the one who would be taking her home tonight, and
for the rest of her life. She thought her Watcher looked quite handsome in
his Tux, as he escorted her bride to her. He beamed with pride at the feel
of the red-head’s hand on his arm.</p>

<p>Her eyes locked onto the green one’s as they got closer and she seemed to
float inside them. It seemed as though her love would never arrive by her
side, but before she knew it, Her Watcher was relinquishing her bride and
she was taking both of the red-head’s hands in hers.
She barely heard the words that she was supposed to say, but she didn’t need
to hear them to know what her heart wanted to say to the woman she loved
more than life itself. "I...Buffy Summers, take you...Willow Rosenberg..."</p>

<p>The void was back way before she would have liked and she found herself
cringing at the ear-shattering sound of the voice. "Why do you resist?! You
must let this fantasy world go! Can’t you see how it’s destroying your
life?!"</p>

<p>"Shut Up!" She shouted back at it, unable to take it’s relenting tirade of
her anymore. "Shut up, shut up, shut up! Get out of my head!" She screamed
into the void, bolting awake as she sat up, shaking in her bed, sweat
pouring off of her in rivulets. She felt her heart racing as she gulped in
great breaths of air.</p>

<p>Feeling suddenly claustrophobic, she climbed out of bed and onto the desk,
where she could get closer to the barred window. She grasped the steel frame
with her hand as she stared out into the night sky, not sure what she
believed anymore. She could swear she could picture her love’s face among
the stars, and her eyes filled with tears at the sight. "Oh, Will." She
sighed, mournfully.</p>

<p>Willow, who was also unwittingly staring out of their open bedroom window at
the same time, jerked her head up as she heard a soft whisper that seemed to
be carried on the wind. "Buffy? Oh, Buffy, please be okay." She pleaded with
her errant lover, hoping that the night would carry her wish to her.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>
Buffy had her head resting against the steel frame girding her window,
starting to fall asleep where she sat, when she was startled by a soft tap
against the window pane.</p>

<p>"Buffy." She heard a very familiar whisper and jerked her head up to see the
well-known, dark visage of Angel.</p>

<p>"Angel?" She gasped, in a broken whisper at the sight of him. "You’re real?"
She blinked at him, almost unable to believe that he was really out there
looking back at her.</p>

<p>"Of course I’m real. Invite me in, Buffy." He urged her, wanting more than
anything to burst right through the window.</p>

<p>"I’m not crazy." She whispered, mostly to herself as the realization sank
slowly into her fogged brain. ‘My Will...my Will is real...I knew she was
real.’</p>

<p>A look of sympathy crossed the dark vampire’s face. "Of course you’re not
crazy."</p>

<p>"How did you know? How did you find me?" Buffy wanted to pinch herself to
prove she wasn’t hallucinating, but she didn’t want to look foolish if Angel
was really out there. There’s nothing worse than looking foolish in front of
an ex-boyfriend.</p>

<p>"Giles called me. They’ve been looking for you for days. I guess they
finally got desperate enough to call for backup." He explained, noticing the
way Buffy sucked up every name that she recognized. "Cordelia kinda pointed
me in the right direction." Angel said, choosing to leave out the part where
she’d said the Slayer looked worse than a homeless person.</p>

<p>"I’m in L.A." Buffy reflected, something starting to come together through
the daze she had been living in. Somebody had wanted to get rid of her so
badly that they had drugged her up and shipped her off to a psychiatric ward
in L.A., and were content to leave her that way.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Everyone is worried about you." Angel continued, unable to tell what
the Slayer was thinking behind the shuttered blue eyes. "So, why don’t you
invite me in so I can bust you out of there."</p>

<p>"No." The Slayer said, quietly, shaking her head, as an inner fire started
to burn deep inside her. The wheels in her head were spinning faster than
those on a suped up Camaro, and a plan was developing within her head.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, no? Are you crazy?" Angel asked, in shock, wincing at the
outraged look Buffy threw at him. "Sorry. Poor choice of words. But you
can’t be serious. There is no way I’m letting you stay in there."</p>

<p>"Angel, I don’t exactly want to stay here, myself. But I can’t just bust out
of here, either. Some one went to a lot of trouble to put me here and I
can’t just break out of here and risk them coming after me again, not now,
somebody could get hurt." Meaning Willow or her unborn child could get hurt
the next time the guys in the van came looking for her. "I have to find out
who’s behind this, and I can’t do that from out there. I think all the
information I need is in here." She concluded, seriously.</p>

<p>Angel didn’t like her logic, but he certainly couldn’t fault it. Whoever did
it just might try it again if she managed to escape. "Well then, let me help
you in there."</p>

<p>"Sorry Angel, I think you’d be a little conspicuous once the sun came up.
They don’t even have a dust buster in this place." Buffy’s dry humor
breaking through the rage she felt. "Besides, this is a one woman job."
"Buffy...I want to help."</p>

<p>"You already have. You convinced me I wasn’t crazy. And you can do me
another favor. Tell Will and the guys that I’m all right, and I’ll be home
as soon as I can. Also...don’t tell Willow where I am. I don’t think she’d
stop worrying if she knew I was trapped in a funny farm." She tried to joke,
but Angel could see the deep worry and concern that shined in the deep blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Although he hated it with every fiber of his undead being, he agreed to the
Slayer’s terms. "All right, but if you’re not out of there by the end of the
week I’m coming back, and next time I’ll get some poor innocent sucker to
invite me in." He told her seriously.</p>

<p>"Agreed." She said, drinking in the sight of him, the one grip she had on
her own version of what her world was. "Angel...thanks for coming."</p>

<p>"Anytime." He grinned at her mirthlessly. "You get what you need and get the
hell out of there...or I’m coming back with a vengeance." He told her before
he disappeared from the window and into the night. But it was enough to know
that he had been there. She was, and is Buffy Anne Summers. And she was
going to marry the woman of her dreams...as soon as she got out of here,
that is.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p align=center>"Melancholy"<br>
they would say<br>
peering down at<br>
me<br>
from their lofty perspectives<br>
of freedom.<br>
But<br>
they could not know<br>
that you were the vine<br>
pinning me safely to the scorched earth."</p>

<p>Buffy listened as a girl in her therapy group recited the poem she had
written. The short brunette that read the poem, sounded breathless, as she
tried to recapture those infinite moments that she spoke of so eloquently.
The poem reflected the girl’s loneliness to her, the depression she had sank
into after her lover had left her, reminded Buffy of her own lost feelings
that being stuck in this place, apart from Willow, caused in her.</p>

<p>Buffy’s struggle to reclaim herself had been threefold. The first thing she
had to do was get herself off of the medication. Once she had taken the
pills in the morning, she would request to take a shower...with the water
running, no one heard her as she made herself vomit up the pills she had
swallowed. Throwing up had never felt so good, she decided, as her long
missing strength began to reassert itself in leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>She could feel the vitality starting to reassert itself, her stamina and
super healing, taking care of the withdrawals she was sure that she would
have without it. She tested her newly refound strength by picking up her
bed, the steel frame creaked as she lifted it off the floor with both hands,
straining with the effort...then she let it down, careful to not make a
sound so she wouldn’t be disturbed. It wasn’t long before she was trying it
one handed, her arm straining with the weight of the bed as she picked it
up, but she grinned exhilarated as the strength returned to her.</p>

<p>The second thing she had to do was lull the workers into a state of
complacency where she was concerned, and she wouldn’t be able to do that if
she kept insisting on being called Buffy. She slowly pledged acceptance of
her new life, or old life depending on how you looked at it, and started
learning all she could about this person named Sarah.</p>

<p>They said she had recently broken up with her boyfriend, fought with her
parents all the time and tried to end it all by jumping off of a bridge.
Didn’t sound much like her, Buffy thought ruefully, but she supposed people
could believe whatever they wanted to.</p>

<p>The third thing she had to do was learn the staff’s routine...when they came
on shift, when they took their breaks, she was even amused to discover that
their were a couple of nurses who even fell asleep during the middle of
their night shift.</p>

<p>All of this took a matter of days to do, she knew her time was running
out...Angel would be back to get her if she wasn’t out of here by tomorrow
night...but she was pretty sure she was ready. It would have to be tonight.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>She watched unobserved as the Nurse on duty slowly fell asleep in the chair
she was reclining in, in the Nurse’s station. She stealthily stepped from
the shadows in which she had hid, and crept over to the Nurse’s station
door, grabbed a hold of the handle, and hoping against all hope gave it a
hard yank. To her deep surprise and satisfaction, she felt the lock break
and the door opened with a clunk.</p>

<p>Also, to her great satisfaction, the Nurse slept through the noise. She
shook her head at the dumb blonde bimbo sleeping in the chair, thinking that
it was probably a good thing she was the one breaking in here instead of a
real crazy person, she’d seen quite a few in here, and they could be mean.
Her eyes flicked to the charts that were filed neatly on a bookcase. It
didn’t take her long to find what she was looking for...she found the name
they had given her easily amongst the other clients, and took the chart down
off of the shelf. Opening it up, she quickly read through it, not quite
knowing what she was looking for, but knowing that she’d know it when she
found it.</p>

<p>Dispite being prepared for anything she might find, she was actually taken
off guard when she actually did. It was just unconceivable. How could the
man be that vengeful? That hateful? That idiotic? It was printed in clearly
typed, black letters in reference to the referring agent. Ira Rosenberg.</p>

<p>"I should have known." Buffy growled, forgetting to be quiet. The noise
finally woke the Nurse, who Buffy could hear stirring behind her, and she
turned to look at her.</p>

<p>"Hey! Wh-How did you get in here?!" The Nurse sat up with a start, surprised
to see a patient in here staring back at her.</p>

<p>"Breaking and entering...at least that’s what I’ve heard." Buffy said,
calmly, closing the file, then looked back up at the Nurse, who was looking
back at her wide-eyed. Getting a spurt of adrenaline urged energy, the Nurse
sprang from the seat, intending to call security.</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t do that if I were you." Buffy said, grabbing a hold on the
little wire that connected the phone to the wall and giving it a tug,
pulling the socket from the wall...plaster and all. "Whoops, guess I don’t
know my own strength. Not surprising, considering you people tried to
brainwash me."</p>

<p>The nurse sank back in her chair in stunned shock over the little display of
strength. "Sarah...I don’t..."She started, nervously.</p>

<p>"DON’T call me that." Buffy almost shouted...forgetting her objective for
the moment. "My name is Buffy Summers...you tried to take that away from
me...you failed." Her eyes blazed with the anger she felt. Then she forced
herself to calm down, taking deep breaths before she continued. "Now give me
your keys."</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy shook her head at the Nurse’s obtuseness, wasn’t it obvious
that she wanted to get the hell out of here?</p>

<p>"Your keys...give...them...to...me." She growled menacingly, towering over
the badly shaking nurse.</p>

<p>"I...I can’t do that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you better. You haven’t seen me angry yet...I don’t think you
want to." She held her hand out to the shaking nurse, gratified when she
felt the cool metal of the keys sliding into her palm. She shoved the keys
into the pocket of her jeans, then grabbed the phone cord and tied up the
Nurse’s hands with it. "I’m sorry to have to do this, I really am, but I
can’t have you alerting anyone just yet. See, I’d love to stay and chat...I
really would." Buffy said, mockingly. "But there’s this wedding that I have
to attend and my fiancée will kill me if I’m not there." Buffy explained, a
small smile pulling at her lips. "Oh, and I’ll be taking this with me." She
indicated the file, then smiling one more time at the astonished face of the
nurse, Buffy slipped out of the Nurse’s station and used the keys to let her
out of the Psych ward.</p>

<p>Getting out of a Psych ward isn’t as hard as one might think. Once you’ve
got the keys it’s pretty much easy access. So it wasn’t long before Buffy
found herself standing outside in the pouring rain, with bare feet, no money
and no form of transportation. She looked at the sky with an amused grin on
her face. "It doesn’t rain in California...but it pours." She said, laughing
out loud, after a week and a half of confinement it felt good to be outside
again.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"You know, I will never get why you just left her there in the first place.
Did she want to stay there, for some sick, twisted reason?" Angel went to
answer Cordelia’s question, but was interrupted by a low vibrant voice.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. It’s not like it was fun day at the park." Buffy stumbled into
Angel’s office, resembling a drowned cat.</p>

<p>"Hey...Buffy. We were just talking about you." Cordy’s mouth had a way of
running away from her brain at times.</p>

<p>"Yeah...so I heard." Buffy muttered back, landing in one of Angel’s chairs
with a wet splatting sound.</p>

<p>"Are you okay? You look..." Angel started, then winced as Cordelia cut him
off.</p>

<p>"Like a drowned rat." She broke in, with her usual tact.</p>

<p>"I’m fine. I’ll be even better when I’m back in SunnyDale...although I could
use a change of clothes and a ride. I’d go to the bus station...but..."</p>

<p>"No, that’s okay, I’ll drive you...Cordelia could you get Buffy something to
wear?" Angel asked, his soulful eyes bearing into those of his secretaries.</p>

<p>Cordelia rose, smiling a little bit awkwardly at Buffy...then at Angel.
"Sure...can’t have her walking around looking like that. I’ll see what I
have downstairs." Angel sighed, as Cordelia departed, then smiled
hesitantly. "Would you like anything to drink? Tea? Coffee?" he asked, as he
handed the Slayer a towel.</p>

<p>"No, thanks...I’m kind of off of that stuff for a while. So...is Cordelia
living with you now?" Buffy asked, she had noticed a bit of tension around
them earlier.</p>

<p>Angel grimaced, his head turning in the direction Cordelia had disappeared
in, before looking back at Buffy. "It’s kind of complicated. She’s been
through a lot since Doyle died and..."</p>

<p>"Hey...you don’t have to explain anything to me. I’m the one you found
locked up in a Psych ward, remember?" Buffy said, holding up her hands to
ward off his explanation, not sure that she wanted to hear it. Their
relationship was better left in the past.</p>

<p>"I remember. Did you find the answers you were looking for."</p>

<p>Buffy’s face turned momentarily hard at the question, and he could see
something playing beneath the blue of her eyes, but she blinked it off
moments later and her answer was rather short. "Yeah. I did."</p>

<p>Angel felt compelled to ask her more, but Cordelia returned with dry clothes
and the moment was lost, for now anyway.</p>

<p>"Here...I know they’re not the quality you were expecting...but.."</p>

<p>"They’re fine. I guess I’ll go change, and then we can get on the road."</p>

<p>Buffy disappeared into the bathroom, and Cordelia gave Angel a long look.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"So...has she said anything?"</p>

<p>"No. Whatever it is, it’s very personal. If she wanted my help, she would
ask for it."</p>

<p>"But.."</p>

<p>"Leave it alone, Cordelia!"</p>

<p>"Fine." She pouted, a look Angel usually found quite charming. "But the next
time I get a headache because of her, I’m billing her for it."</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The ride back to SunnyDale was very quiet, neither knowing what to say to
the other one. A lot of time had passed since he had left her to go to L.A.
and a lot of things had changed in their lives. She had Willow now, and a
new baby on the way, she couldn’t imagine her life being any more full of
happiness, and she fought with herself over whether she should tell Angel or
not. On the one hand, she knew he’d be happy for her, and it looked like he
was starting to be happy in L.A. On the other hand, she knew it was pretty
big news, and she didn’t know how he would react. Then on the other hand, if
he found out from someone else he might be disappointed that she hadn’t told
him herself.</p>

<p>Buffy fought with the decision until they reached the outskirts of
SunnyDale, then said in a really quiet voice. "Angel...I’m getting married."</p>

<p>The startled vampire almost swerved off the road at a very high speed. He
applied the brake, then pulled the car over, feeling the need to be in a
stopped car while they had this conversation. Buffy waited until the car had
pulled to a stop, then looked over at him, wondering what his reaction was
going to be.</p>

<p>"Married?" Buffy nodded her head, wondering why she suddenly felt
tongue-tied. "Who’s the lucky guy?" Angel finally asked, trying to make it
light for Buffy’s sake.</p>

<p>"It’s Will." She said, grinning awkwardly.</p>

<p>"The guy’s name is Will...well, congratulations." That went well, Angel
decided, proud of his ability to remain calm during the conversation.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head at him slowly, and Angel wondered what he had said
wrong. "No...Angel...it’s Willow."</p>

<p>"Oh." Angel said knowingly, a wry grin starting to pull on his bottom lip.</p>

<p>"Oh? That’s all you can say? Oh!" Buffy looked at him wide-eyed, unable to
believe he was taking it so well.</p>

<p>"Well...it’s not like it’s a big surprise. I’ve known how you felt about
her, long before you did."</p>

<p>"Oh." Buffy blushed, a red crimson overtaking her face, she was glad the
dark hid her face from view. "Was I that obvious?" She asked, playing with a
piece of lint on Cordelia’s sweater.</p>

<p>"Just to me." Angel answered somberly. "Are you sure you don’t want any help
with whatever it is that you’re planning?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think I’m planning something?" She asked him, sending him
her best innocent look.</p>

<p>"Because I know you." He answered simply.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the offer Angel...but I’ve really got to handle this one myself.
I do appreciate everything you’ve done for me though." She reached for the
handle to the door, intending to get out.</p>

<p>"Don’t you want me to drop you someplace a little closer to home?"</p>

<p>"Nope. I’ve got it from here." The Slayer said, as she got out of the car.
She didn’t want Angel to know where she was going. "Tell Cordelia I’ll send
her clothes back to her." He could see the darkness that was rising up in
her, even as she glibly spoke about the clothes. He had seen her like this
only once before, when he had been Angelus and they had faced each other in
battle. He felt a small wedge of pity in the deepest pit of his soul for
whoever had pissed her off this much.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>
Ira entered his office, shutting the door behind him to keep Sheila from
disturbing his peace. He gave the low lit room only a cursory glance before
sitting down at his desk, and flipping on the lamp that sat on his desk. It
was almost time for his regularly scheduled call to the facility that was
holding the damned nuisance his daughter had the nerve to be dating. Every
evening he would kiss his wife and tell her he was going to get some work
done in his office, then he would make the escape to his retreat, and at
seven pm sharp on the dot, he would make the call. So far, the progress had
been hopeful and Ira knew that it wouldn’t be long before the person
formally known as Buffy Summers ceased to exist and his daughter would come
running home, begging for forgiveness. Then things would be as they had been
intended.</p>

<p>Of course, his wife knew nothing of his plans. He didn’t want to worry her
pretty little head over it, besides she might not have agreed with his
strict measures...women seldom knew the price a man had to pay to keep his
family together. Having his daughter back home with them would be enough of
a reward.</p>

<p>The Slayer watched him from the shadows for a while, wondering how somebody
so smug could ever produce somebody as wonderful as Willow. She could feel
her rage building again, and willed him to look up and see her so she could
confront him.</p>

<p>As if reading her mind, Ira picked his head up slowly from the paperwork he
had been going over and stared at a spot in the furthest corner of the room
that he had previously left ignored. The blowing of the curtain by a strong
breeze coming through the open window caught his attention. Especially since
he knew that he had shut that window before he had gone down to supper about
an hour ago, and hadn’t opened it on his return.</p>

<p>The light from the street lamp outside, cast a reflection on a pair of
shining, lethal blue eyes, and Ira froze, feeling caught within the power
that emanated from the blue orbs.</p>

<p>Buffy stepped from the shadows that had mostly hid her, and smiled in
predatory fashion at the look of fear that flashed over Ira Rosenberg’s pale
face. "Hiya, Ira. Did you miss me?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" He asked, giving away his nervousness by the
white knuckled grip he had on the pen he still held in one hand. "This is
breaking and entering, you know."</p>

<p>"I seem to be doing that a lot lately." She grinned, mirthlessly at him.
"But what you should really be asking me is...What am I doing here instead
of that hellhole you had me shipped off to?"</p>

<p>Ira paled considerably at the question, and Buffy took a great deal of
satisfaction out of his obvious discomfort. "How did you...?"</p>

<p>"Find out?" Buffy suplied, helpfully. "You know...they really shouldn’t
leave incriminating evidence in a patient’s medical chart for everybody to
see. It was quite careless of them, don’t you think?"</p>

<p>Ira stared at her nervously, then reached out to grab the phone, but Buffy
was alot quicker than he was, and she picked it up before he could even
blink. "I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Of course, I wouldn’t have done
half of the things you’ve done." She looked at him, disgust emanating from
her pores. "We haven’t finished our conversation yet, Ira. Not by a long
shot."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"What do I want?" Buffy asked him back, mockingly. "Personally...the last
week and a half of my life back would be nice, but I suppose that’s really
out of your hands. But what I really want, is for you and your wife to find
some way to unconditionally and irrevocably love and support your daughter
in whatever she decides to do with her life. Like any ‘normal’ parent would
do." She growled at him, making him flinch back in his chair. "But, until
you can, I want you to stay out of our lives. And I really don’t want to see
you on our wedding day. I rescind my earlier invitation. It would just be
too much right now. I might actually be forced to kill you if you show up."
Buffy told him quite frankly.</p>

<p>"And if I just decide to have you committed again, or worse?" Buffy let the
question hang in the air between them like a poisoned dart zeroing in on her
head, before she snatched it up and threw it back at him.</p>

<p>"I escaped this time, and I’ll escape the next time. I’ll tell your daughter
all about this conversation and I guarantee you’ll lose her...permanently."
The once proud man broke as she spoke and she saw it in his eyes. Some
miniscule part of her felt sorry for the man, and wondered if she’d go to
such great lengths to ‘protect’ her own daughter.</p>

<p>"Why wait? If you told her all of the things I’ve done to you, she would
never forgive me. I’ve already done enough to cost me my daughter."</p>

<p>Buffy wanted to hate the man, she really did, but all she really felt was
tired. Exhausted to the bone. She didn’t have the energy it took to hate.
She sighed as she looked at him, and shook her head at his own stupidity.
"Because no matter what you and Sheila did at that dinner, she still loves
you both very much. And I really don’t want to be the one to take that away
from her."</p>

<p>They stared at each other mutely for a long moment, then Buffy sighed again,
and walked toward the window. When she was sitting on its edge she looked
back at him, measuring her next words carefully. "Anyways, what happens next
is for you to decide. For Willow’s sake, I hope you choose wisely." She
finished, then dropped out the window, landing lightly on the manicured lawn
outside.</p>

<p>By the time Ira reached the window, Buffy had already disappeared into the
night. He stared pensively out at the dark night for a long while...then
went back to the phone to call off the dogs. Buffy Summers had won.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>She didn’t feel much like a winner as she tiptoed into a quiet house.</p>

<p>She could see a light on in the living room, and she quietly crept inside,
spotting her mother laying on the couch watching television.</p>

<p>"Hey, mom." She said, quietly, trying not to startle her. Joyce was off the
couch like a rocket, and before Buffy knew it, she was being smothered in
her mother’s embrace.</p>

<p>"Buffy...where have you been?" Joyce asked, as she smoothed her hair back
away from her face.</p>

<p>"It’s kind of a long story. Can I tell you in the morning? I want to check
on Will." Buffy said, too tired to get into any kind of a discussion
tonight.</p>

<p>"Sure honey, I kind of made her go to bed...she was looking really wiped
out." Joyce’s expression showed just how worried she had been for the
depressed red head. The call from Angel really hadn’t helped lift her
spirits any either. She knew Buffy would have a lot of explaining to do
before Willow would be ready to forgive her for disappearing the way she
had.</p>

<p>"Is she okay?" Buffy asked, worried.</p>

<p>"I think she will be now that you’re back. You had us all worried for a
while." Buffy could hear the slight recrimination in her mother’s voice and
winced inwardly.</p>

<p>She nodded her head, looking over towards the stairs, wanting nothing more
than to be up them and in her bedroom, holding her red-headed lover. "I
know. But I’m home now. I’ll try not to do that again, for a while." She
smiled a little, knowing that her crazy life wouldn’t get less crazy just
because she got married and had a child. She just hoped that she would have
what it took to keep everybody together through whatever happened next time.</p>

<p>"Go get some rest, Buffy. I expect to hear all about it in the morning."
Joyce said, giving her daughter a stern look, before directing her towards
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Yes, mom." Buffy answered, and trudged up the stairs.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she reached the top of the stairs and entered her room, that
she realized she had still been battling with herself over what was real and
what wasn’t. The sight before her eyes was enough to make her realize just
how confused she had still been. She felt tears start to well up in her eyes
and a burning tightness filled her throat. "You’re real." She heard herself
whisper, as she let her eyes travel over the too pale form. Willow had dark
bags under her eyes, and a frown covered her face even as she slept.</p>

<p>Buffy crept closer to the bed, careful not to make a sound, as if she was
afraid that if she was too loud, Willow would disappear before her eyes and
she would wake up back in the Psych Unit.</p>

<p>Hovering over her sleeping lover, Buffy laid a trembling hand on Willow’s
cheek, a shock going through her as she felt the infinite softness and a sob
catching in her throat as she felt how real Willow really was. Her composure
broke then, like a dam with too many holes in it, and she buried her head in
the curve of the red head’s neck, hot tears streaming down her face. "I knew
you were real." She whispered in a soft litany, almost unable to believe it
was true.</p>

<p>Willow woke at the sound, hearing the soft murmuring in her ear, even as her
body responded, instinctively wrapping itself around the shaking form of her
lover. "Buffy?" The word trembled on her lips, tears flooding her eyes as
she felt her lover sobbing on top of her. "Oh, God. Buffy."</p>

<p>The sobs increased at the sound of her lover’s voice and soon she was
weeping uncontrollably, unable to stop the pent up emotions that streamed
from her in an overwhelming gush. Willow held onto her tightly, whispering
words of love and reassurance into the Slayer’s ear. Buffy let each and
every one of them fill the void she had been living in, crying out the pain
she had felt without her.</p>

<p>After a while, the crying became less severe and the Slayer calmed into her
lover’s embrace. Willow kept up her assurances, her hands wandering
aimlessly all over the Slayer’s back and head as she felt the storm abating.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Willow asked, gently, desperate to know what
had happened to her lover in the time she had been gone.</p>

<p>"Soon." Buffy promised, her head still resting on Willow’s chest. "Right
now, all I want to do is hold you." ‘And prove to myself that you are very
real.’ She amended, silently.</p>

<p>"Okay." Willow conceded, kissing her lover’s head and moving the sweaty hair
off of her forehead. "I’m here for you, Buffy."</p>

<p>It took a great deal of cuddling, and one very long, slow and gentle love
making session before all of Buffy’s fears could be swept back into one very
small corner of her psyche, and when the sun came up and she was still
holding the one she loved in her arms, staring as she slept peacefully, the
sun reflecting off of that beautiful face, that last bit of fear in that one
tiny corner disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>She knew she would have a lot of explaining to do to her friend’s and
family, and she intended to tell them most of what she had been through,
leaving out only Ira’s part in the whole thing, she didn’t want to start her
married life off in a lie, after all, but she knew they would be there for
her when the story was over, and really what more could she ask for?</p>
