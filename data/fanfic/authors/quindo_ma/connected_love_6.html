<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 5: A discovered connection -->

<p>After that discussion at Giles they headed to ask Xander if he could
somehow get a few infrared glasses from the local military base. They both
giggled as they thought about how his ‘Self discovery trip’ had ended. He
started to drive south and soon enough arrived in LA where he had no other idea
than to stop by at Cordelia and -what actually seemed quite the right thing but
was nevertheless still funny- spent a -quoting him- ‘Hot, steamy and loving
night’ together. They both appreciated that because it told them that they were
right with them. They really belonged together. And that’s why it wasn’t really
a surprise that she soon after that Cordy arrived in Sunnydale to first of all
visit Xander and then only a few days later move from the motel she lived in
into Xander’s house and stay near him almost all the time. It was just the right
thing they thought.</p>
<p>"Hey, Buffy, Willow nice to see you. How are you doing?" he asked as soon
as he opened the door, then noticed that both girls were holding hands and
started to smile. Well actually he didn’t smile he grinned. A really large
grin.</p>
<p>"It was really time that that happened. It was getting boring around you
two. Always focussing on the other and forgetting the rest of the world. I felt
kinda left out."</p>
<p>"What do you mean Xander?" Buffy asked. He just nodded down onto their
hands.</p>
<p>"You know exactly what I mean but don’t worry I won’t tell anyone until you
two have decided to tell the people yourself."</p>
<p>Both girls looked into the eyes of their new lover then down onto their
hands still holding each other then Buffy wanted to let Willow’s hand go but the
hacker just held it tighter and gave her an assuring look and she suddenly heard
Willow’s voice.</p>
<p>‘You can trust him. If he says he won’t tell anyone then he
won’t.’</p>
<p>She knew that Willow didn’t say anything, at least not as long as she
hadn’t gone under the ventriloquists. She wondered what just had happened but
let that thought fall as soon as Xander reentered her head with his next
question.</p>
<p>"So what can I do for you two? Let me guess: there is either another threat
in town or you two don’t know what to do."</p>
<p>"Another threat, Xander." Willow said entering the house. She saw Cordelia
come down the stairs in a bath coat her hair still wet.</p>
<p>"Hi, Buffy, Willow, what’s going on?"</p>
<p>"Just another threat that disturbs our peace my honey."</p>
<p>Both the slayer and the hacker looked at themselves and thought in unison
‘Honey?’ both hearing the other and then looked at Xander and waited for an
answer. After a few moments Buffy asked "Honey?"</p>
<p>"Hey, what to do against fate?" he said smiling widely.</p>
<p>He told them to wait in the living room while he led Cordelia into the
kitchen where they saw them starting to kiss then turned around to
themselves.</p>
<p>"He really must fallen for her if he didn’t hear you before."</p>
<p>"Mmm hmmm. Wait. What do you mean? I didn’t say anything."</p>
<p>"You did. I have clearly heard it."</p>
<p>"No. You asked him. But he really must be in love when he didn’t hear you
the first time."</p>
<p>"I didn’t say anything the first time. You did. I know that you must have
said something cause I have heard you."</p>
<p>"Hmmmm... this is strange."</p>
<p>They both fell silent for a few seconds before Willow heard Buffy say ‘What
the hell is going on here?’ but she didn’t see her mouth move. Not a singe
move.</p>
<p>"Um... Buffy... I think I heard you think."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Well you didn’t move your mouth but I heard you say ‘What the hell is
going on here?’. And I don’t think that you said that, cause your mouth didn’t
move and if I can hear you think it is possible that you can hear me too... when
I think I mean and that -"</p>
<p>"Willow, you’re babbling... but I think you may be right about this. I
think we should ask Giles later. But for now let’s keep quiet, ok?"</p>
<p>"Ok"</p>

<p>"So is that all you need?" Xander asked after they had told him what was
going on here.</p>
<p>"Well... no. We also need your support as a member of the group. Yours and
Cordy’s of course." Willow smiled.</p>
<p>"Well I think we can manage that and I’ll go tonight and get those
IR-glasses you need. I hope that this won’t become my second home in future
cause with every visit the chance is increasing that I get caught. And I suppose
no one wants that."</p>
<p>"Well..." Cordelia threw in, a playful smile on her face.</p>
<p>"Cordy. If you don’t like me then why are you here?" He said the same smile
on his face.</p>
<p>Only moments later they were kissing and forgot completely about the other
two girls in the room, who quietly but sure started to giggle and headed towards
the front door.</p>
<p>"Just don’t forget it Xander. I need those if I wanna fight them." Buffy
called back and then left the house with Willow tugging her out. There they
started to laugh and only moments later were in their arms kissing just as
passionately as their friends inside.</p>
<p>‘We have to get away from here before somebody finds us’ Buffy
thought.</p>
<p>"Yeah" Willow mumbled between their kisses. "We really have to." she said
as they broke apart.</p>
<p>"Let me guess, you heard me again."</p>
<p>"Seems so."</p>
<p>"Then let’s get to Giles and ask him about this."</p>
<p>"I think I have a better idea about what we could do now." the hacker said
looking towards Xander’s house. ‘We could do the same they are just
doing.’</p>
<p>"Willow you’re so naughty" Buffy said and started to giggle uncontrollably.
She had heard what Willow had thought and she liked it. She was still laughing
when the redhead heard her ‘Will, please help me I can’t stop.’ She answered
that by tugging Buffy’s lips to her own, kissing her. Then they both headed back
to the dorm as fast as they could. Both wanting the other one, be part of the
other one and satisfy their hidden desires with all the pleasures they were able
to give.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>It took about five minutes at the speed they were running to arrive in
their room. But it took only five seconds before they were laying on the bed
kissing each other and, more or less effective, undressing. But not for long
cause Willow pushed her lover up and said "Slowly" before she sat up took off
her pullover and her bra and exposing the two most perfect breasts Buffy had
ever seen. She leaned forward kissed Willow on her lips, her jaw, her neck, her
collarbone and slowly moved down to her breasts. She took one nipple into her
mouth and started to lick and suck it, while teasing the other with her hand,
rubbing it with her palm. She heard Willow groan with pleasure and she could
feel the nipples harden while she moved her mouth from one to the other, always
kissing the way she moved along. After a few minutes of teasing, licking and
sucking, and listening to the sounds that left Willow’s throat, she stood up and
undressed the rest of her clothes, starting with her top (she hadn’t worn a bra
today), then moving off her pants and her panties in one move. Stepping out of
them she leaned forward, placed a kiss on Willow’s mouth and then went down to
take off her skirt, shortly followed by her knickers. She moved back up and
kissed her love and stayed there for what seemed an eternity before they broke
apart to get some of the needed oxygen. Then Willow took over the control. She
turned them around so that she was on top now and stared over Buffy’s body,
admiring every single curve, every single spot on it. She then leaned down and
started to kiss her. Over and over. She started at the blondes’ mouth placing a
passionate kiss there and then worked her over her face planting small kisses
everywhere. She started moving down her neck, over her breasts, sucking one into
her mouth and then continued with the other. She felt them get erect and heard
Buffy’s moan as she lightly bit into one of them to stimulate it. The wicca then
moved farther down and passed her navel planting small kisses around it before
burying her tongue into it. The slayer let out a low moan as she felt Willow’s
tongue. The hacker continued the path she was on and neared the slayers abdomen
and pelvic bone. She skipped that -as she had to admit with a smile- very wet
part in the middle and started to kiss the inner thighs on both sides. Buffy
groaned in pleasure but was sure that she couldn’t take that teasing much
longer.</p>
<p>"Go ahead Willow I won’t bite you, well... at least not if you go ahead"
she said smiling down to her looking into her eyes and seeing the love
there.</p>
<p>Willow didn’t let that be said twice. She kissed Buffy’s clit then started
to rub over her lips and inhaled the scent Buffy’s moisture had left. The slayer
moaned as soon as Willow used two fingers and started to shove them up her
center and then went down to lick Buffy’s wetness. Buffy started to buck and
move up into Willow’s cunning tongue.</p>
<p>‘Oh god, Willow. You have a talent for this.’</p>
<p>The redhead took the slayers throbbing clit into her mouth and sucked
it.</p>
<p>‘You think?’</p>
<p>It didn’t take long until Buffy came yelling out Willow’s name but the
wicca kept on with her motion until her spasms had stopped. She then moved up to
kiss her lover and Buffy could smell her own scent and taste her own liquid and
she licked off Willow’s face and kissing every spot on it after that.</p>
<p>"My turn" Buffy said grinning.</p>
<p>She switched positions with Willow and did the same the little redhead had
done. Willow screamed as she came, pushing Buffy’s head into her hips and
bucking in pleasure feeling an orgasm that she never had felt before. After that
they dropped next to each other on the bed snuggling close into the center of
their world and inhaling the scent of their love. They kissed and both said in
chorus "I love you."</p>
<p>It was also the last thought of them before they both fell asleep,
completely exhausted. Both heard what the other thought and both knew that they
had a more than special connection together. The last time they had a dream they
shared, they didn’t know of the connection they had and that that dream was
shared. This time though, they knew it and this time they knew that what they
saw wasn’t just a dream created by their own minds but the entire life of their
love. They shared their lives and all that was part of it. The good times as
well as the bad times and both knew that they needed each other to prevent the
other from dying by these feelings. These feelings that were so long buried and
now all returned to the surface. But now that they were together they knew that
they could move on and cope with those things... Together.</p>
