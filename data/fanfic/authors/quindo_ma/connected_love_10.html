<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 8: Special powers -->

<p>Willow woke up on a small hill. She looked up and saw a willow tree on the top. She started to walk towards it when she noticed an other person nearing it from the other side. She looked at the other person and recognized her.</p>
<p>"Buffy!"</p>
<p>"Willow!"</p>
<p>They ran towards each other. They met on the top just beside the tree and hugged and kissed the other.</p>
<p>"Willow are you ok? I mean you seem ok, but... this... your still tied up against that tree aren't you?"</p>
<p>Willow nodded.</p>
<p>"Well then I suppose we have a dream." Buffy smiled. She was happy to see her lover again, even if it was only a dream.</p>
<p>"But why are we here? Did you do that Will?"</p>
<p>"You are here because we brought you here. You need to learn a few things before you go on." a new voice spoke up startling both girls. They looked into the direction the voice came from and saw two people standing there. A man, seemingly in some kind of armor, and a woman in a wide robe, that seemed to float around her feet.</p>
<p>"And you are...?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"We were the first fighters for this realm." The woman spoke this time.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? The first fighters?"</p>
<p>"Well... to explain that it would take too long. We will do that another time, but for now you must know who you are and why you are here."</p>
<p>"We're waiting."</p>
<p>"Ok to take the short way, you two are keepers of the powers we once held. They were used to fight the evil and prevent them from taking this realm. We have found out that we couldn't do this forever so we gave them to humans that from then on would fight for what we have fought. Every 3600 years the Powers of Darkness are able to open an entrance to this world without any help from this side. This will happen soon and you two are the only ones that can stop that."</p>
<p>"Ok I know that I have saved the world often enough but can't such a thing be done by an other slayer?"</p>
<p>"No, just because you two are the only ones that hold these powers and for the next 3600 years they will not return. It was simply too difficult for us to summon all the powers we had and give them to the next humans. So what we did was give small amounts of the powers to certain humans. A few received the gifts to cast magic like you Willow. Others have received the gifts of great strength and fast healing like you Buffy. You and your fellows the other slayers weren't the only ones that received those gifts but you were those that were noticed by mankind. This is just to explain why the 'Council' thinks all slayers are women. But so much for that. You two have taken the first step to use those powers and preventing the Chaos from entering this realm."</p>
<p>"What step?" Willow, who had been quiet until now, asked.</p>
<p>"By falling in love," the man said. "The only way we knew to, sorry if this sounds rude, force the fighters that would follow us to fight together was to connect them. We asked this realm to help us and this sort of connection you two have is the answer. It started as you two both found out that you love each other. Not the conscious part of your soul, but your heart. You have had shared dreams before you both knew it. The dream where your consciousness finally accepted the love was one of them."</p>
<p>"You mean... THAT was a shared...?" Both girls asked in unison, their eyes widening.</p>
<p>"Yes it was. But this is only the beginning of everything. We came here and brought you to this place to tell you who you are and to warn you, that the time you will need what you have received will come soon. You two have just started to know the powers you two hold. Buffy you are much stronger and faster than you ever thought and Willow your magic is just starting to show itself. Now that you are together you will be able to use those powers. But you still need training. This place here is a place that exists in the real world out there too. It is a place that we have once created and that is hidden, so that only the special fighters, like you two, are able to find it. It is a place where you can train and learn to control your powers. As soon as you wake up you will know where to go. We will wait there for you to help you on your way."</p>
<p>"But... but... Willow is still tied up against that tree and I can't just go there after I wake up. Not when I know that she is still in danger."</p>
<p>Willow smiled as she heard that. She knew it was something that Buffy said automatically, mostly because she was her best friend for over 3 years now, but she was still happy that she could hear it.</p>
<p>"You still have enough time to free her. There is not such a hurry for what you have to do but know that the time, when the evil will enter, will come."</p>
<p>And with that the two people disappeared. Willow looked into Buffy's eyes and was a little shocked about what she had just found out.</p>
<p>"Hey, seems like we're more special than we thought." Buffy smiled</p>
<p>"Yeah. I just hope that you'll come soon. I miss you too much."</p>
<p>"Hey, now I'm here. Maybe it's not the same but I am here. And I will not leave you if it is in any way avoidable."</p>
<p>With that Buffy kissed her lover and they started to lay down onto the grass, slipping one piece of clothing off after the other. It was a wonderful time for both of them and although they knew that they would wake, seperated from each other, up they didn't think about it. They just laid in the grass and loved each other. In more than just one way. </p>
<p>"I love you Will."</p>
<p>"And I love you."</p>
<p>With that both woke up, one in her bed in Giles house, the other tied against a tree. Both sweating and both smiling. Buffy had her hand between her legs and so had Willow. They were both glad about what they had found out and that they, although they were separated, were able to spend the night together.</p>
<p>Now that they knew that they were more than they had thought, they had to learn to control their powers.</p>

<p>"You think they will join us?" the woman asked, again standing under the willow tree.</p>
<p>"They will. And they will prevent once more the destruction of this world."</p>
<p>"I just hope they will come together sooner than we have. I hated the time we were separated."</p>
<p>"So did I my love, so did I."</p>
