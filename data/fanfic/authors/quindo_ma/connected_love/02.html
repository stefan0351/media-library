<p>This night Willow accompanied Buffy during her sweep through the graveyards
of Sunnydale. She neither wanted to be alone in the dorm nor leave her Slayer do
this alone. ‘Her Slayer’. How that sounded. It was in some way strange to think
of Buffy that way. But she liked it. Although if she had been asked six months
ago if she was -as she still liked to formulate it- ‘kinda gay’ then the first
and only thing she would have answered had been ‘No way’. But so much had
changed since then. She had fallen for her best friend. And Oz... It was strange
to think about him now; now that he had left.</p>
<p>*** "It is safer for you if I leave. I have to find out how to reverse this
and I can’t do this here where I have to be worried about you." ***</p>
<p>It really wasn’t nice of him to just leave. But she could understand him
now. He probably had noticed that she had changed after he returned from that
gig in Chicago. Must have noticed that her love for him wasn’t the same anymore.
And after a few talks -that were mostly like talking against a wall because she
hadn’t really listened to him then; she had just too much to think about Buffy
at that moment- he had told her that he had to leave. She had been totally
destroyed after that. It took a few days before she had even left her room
again. ‘Heh’ It was in a special way funny to think about that now. It was
actually Buffy’s urging that had convinced her to leave her room and go out
again. ‘Buffy... GOD how much I love her. If she hadn’t been there then, then I
would have probably stayed in my room for the rest of the holidays.’</p>
<p>Buffy turned around to her. She had heard that last thought. "I love you
too"</p>
<p>Willow smiled but then noticed Buffy’s attention getting focused to
something else. She saw her switch into slayer mode. That was her sign to hide.
She walked to a group of bushes but then felt a hand on her arm. She turned her
head and saw Buffy shaking her head slightly as ever.</p>
<p>‘Don’t go there. The sound came from that direction and I don’t want to
loose you to whatever is there.’</p>
<p>Buffy had concentrated and tried to project her thoughts into Willow’s
brain. She saw her nodding and knew that she had been heard. Willow fell back
and the slayer headed with a small detour towards the bushes. She heard the
wicca start to chant and wondered what she did.</p>
<p>Then she saw it. A demon, about seven feet tall that faced her and seemed
to observe them. He didn’t seem to notice Buffy’s change of actions though. She
thanked her wicca for her abilities and then started an attack. The demon seemed
quite surprised to see her throwing a high foot at him and yanked back but not
enough. She hit him on what seemed part of his shoulder and had Buffy been a
normal human then her leg would probably have been shattered now. But she
wasn’t, she was the slayer and that gave her the ability to hit the demon hard
enough to throw it onto the ground. She jumped onto it crushing her knee into
the throat of that whateveritwas and punched it a few times into the face. A
little dizzied but not beaten yet it yanked Buffy off and threw her ten feet
towards Willow.</p>
<p>"NO!! Buffy!"</p>
<p>She held her hands up and that seemed to stop Buffy’s flight. She was
shocked and lost her concentration just long enough to let Buffy fall onto the
ground. The slayer jumped up and wanted to attack the demon to finish it but
couldn’t see it anymore. Suddenly she was hit hard flying another ten feet and
just mere inches past a tree. She knew that it must have been the same kind of
demon that had attacked her only a week ago. What had Giles called it? Illusion
Weaver. Well it surely did use illusions to hide itself. But Willow had shown
her that it wasn’t always invisible. Either had she made it visible or disabled
its illusions but whatever it was she had to repeat it.</p>
<p>"Will, do it again!"</p>
<p>"Wha- what? Do what again?"</p>
<p>‘Make him visible!’</p>
<p>She understood and started to chant again. A few moments later they could
both see the demon. Or at least the rest that was still left. They saw it run
through the trees and beyond vision.</p>
<p>"That was close."</p>
<p>"Buffy are you ok?" Willow asked, a very worried look on her
features.</p>
<p>"Yes I’m ok just a little dizzy. You?"</p>
<p>"I’m fine, it didn’t attack me."</p>
<p>"Ok I think that we were able to scare it away but I am sure that we
shouldn’t stay here for long. Let’s get to Giles and tell him ‘bout
this."</p>
<p>Willow nodded and they headed towards his house.</p>
<p>"By the way where did you find that spell?"</p>
<p>"To make him visible?"</p>
<p>"Mmm hmmm"</p>
<p>"It was in one of the books Giles gave us. It was quite hidden although and
I just found it through pure luck."</p>
<p>"Can you think of doing that when the ‘Big Battle’ starts?"</p>
<p>"Probably not. And I would have to cast it for every single demon again. It
hasn’t got any area effect to affect more than one of those hideous beasts. I
still don’t think that I already have the power to do it more than for two or
three anyway. And I have to concentrate on the gateway spell and that is quite
difficult and... and I’m babbling right?"</p>
<p>"As sure as you are Willow Rosenberg and as sure as I love you with all
your pros and cons."</p>
<p>Willow started to smile and moved closer to Buffy, then leaned over and
kissed her.</p>
<p>They went the rest of the way in silence enjoying the warmth of their
partner and the closeness that they shared.</p>
<p>At Giles house they started to tell him about what had happened and then
about that strange thing that had stopped Buffy’s flight. But he didn’t have any
idea what that could have been except that in someway Willow’s abilities had
grown. After another 15 minutes of talking and trying to explain what had
happened Xander knocked and entered, three IR-glasses in a box he
carried.</p>
<p>"Sorry but I couldn’t take more. It would have been too suspicious even for
the Hellmouth."</p>
<p>"It’s ok, I think it should be enough. Buffy if you could please get the
book over there. I have to find out what Willow and I need for the
spell."</p>
<p>"Sure"</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>After about 3 more hours of research and a shopping trip to the local
-which was at the moment the only- magic store to get the ingredients and
picking Cordy up on the way back to Giles’ house they decided to call it a
night. Xander and Cordy went back to -meanwhile- their shared house and Willow
and Buffy decided to stay at Willow’s house cause her parents were out of town,
which was not that unusual, it was simply closer than the dorm. They stopped on
their way to buy some ice cream and borrow a few videos -those that were not
already part of Willow’s parents steadily growing collection- and then left the
Hellmouth outside for the night as they entered the house. They really didn’t
want to go out now and lucky them, it stayed outside.</p>
<p>"How bout this?" Buffy asked holding one of the borrowed videos
up.</p>
<p>"Hmmm? Oh sure, although I probably wont pay much attention to
it."</p>
<p>"Willow..." It was a playful voice and the redheads reaction to it was
exaggerated seriousness, which soon was followed by loud laughter. They both
really enjoyed the others presence and Buffy had to admit that Willow was
absolutely right. They really didn’t pay any attention to the video. They just
sat on the couch and were kissing through the whole film and beyond the end of
it. Forgetting all around them. After a while they both fell to sleep and were
grateful that they would wake up next morning in the arms of each
other.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>It was about 3am as Buffy woke up. She thought she had heard something. She
checked the surroundings and then a second time with the IR-glasses on. She
didn’t find anything and decided to go back to bed. She went upstairs as a small
moan caught her attention. She went back into the living room, picked Willow up
and carried her up into her bed. Soon after that they were both asleep snuggled
into their love and enjoying the others warmth.</p>
<p>But what they didn’t know was that they were being observed. And it wasn’t
one of the local voyeurs that did that. Nor one of the ‘good demons’ as there
were a few in town -though only very few. It was one of the better scouts that
had learned to avoid most tracking devices or similar and knew exactly what to
do now. It continued its observation for a few minutes and then left to report
this new development to his master.</p>
<p>‘The slayer and another girl together. This is really interesting. And by
the way she looked at that little redhead it must be love. Love... such an
unnecessary emotion. Just distracting and dangerous. It makes her vulnerable.
Well I should be grateful for that.’</p>
<p>With that last thought it rushed into the darkness leaving the two lovers
another night to enjoy themselves before they would die...</p>

<p>"Hmmm... that is an interesting thing. Love you say?"</p>
<p>"That were my words master."</p>
<p>"Then let's get started. Gather your best soldiers and do your best to follow my will."</p>
<p>"Yes my master." And with that the scout left the inner circle of their members and the leaders of the Rholtha clan. He would do whatever was needed to succeed and fulfill the hopes and needs of his masters.</p>
<p>He smiled at the thought what he would do with that little slayer as soon as she was one of them. He probably would make her his and play with her until he didn't want her anymore and then just kill her. It wasn't really the best idea to kill a member, especially if he had managed to turn a slayer but he had enough time to think about that as soon as he had her on his side. He had scarcely thought about the way he served his master but it was surely enjoying to be one of the best and as such have some freedom about what he did and how he did it. And he used every opportunity to receive more of that freedom and maybe even one time to be elected into the leadership. But for now all he would do was to capture that girl and turn that slayer.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Willow woke up and noticed the warmth of Buffy's body behind her. It was so comforting. She sighed at the thought of needing to get up early and do some research to learn the last few spells to cast the gateway and hide it. 'Hmmm... 6:22 I still have some time.' She turned around to face Buffy and started to gaze at her. 'So beautiful. It took too long for us to notice.'</p>
<p>She sighed again and slowly entangled herself from Buffy, careful not to wake her up, and then started to get dressed. Then she went back to the bed and kissed 'her slayer' on the forehead and smiled, then headed for the door and stopped in the doorway to take a last look before she left the room.</p>
<p>She went down and into the kitchen to set up a dough for a few pancakes and fried a few of them. She wrote a short message where she was and then left the house.</p>
<p>Just outside, she was suddenly knocked down by something very large. Her last thought before she fell into unconsciousness was 'BUFFY!! Help!'</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Buffy startled in her dream. She was dancing with Willow in the Bronze and suddenly heard her. 'BUFFY!! Help!'. She looked into the eyes of Willow scared that something bad had happened when she saw her fade away. "Willow wait." It was her last thought before she woke up. Her eyes shot open and she scanned the room but Willow wasn't there. She was really worried now.</p>
<p>"Willow? Willow, are you here?"</p>
<p>No answer. She headed down just to find the door open. Leaving the house she found Willow's laptop outside on the floor. Her mouth was suddenly dry.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, Willow..." she exhaled.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Giles was getting worried. He had agreed with Willow that they would meet at his house at 7 o'clock. It was now 7:30. Just then he heard the phone ring.</p>
<p>"Hello? Buffy? No she's not here... No I haven't seen her... yes I'll call when I see her. Buffy- Buffy calm down. Now tell me what's wrong."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>After a short talk on the phone about what she had found, Buffy got dressed and ran over to Giles.</p>
<p>Giles heard a knock and went to open the door. Unsurprisingly Buffy was outside. He let her in and she just went over to the couch and took a seat.</p>
<p>"It's all my fault. It's all my fault. I didn't protect her, you know Giles? That's what I normally should do. And now those demons have her." she said with tears welling in her eyes.</p>
<p>She gave him a note.</p>
<p>'We have your little red-haired friend. If you want her back then come to the south graveyard at midnight. Alone!'</p>
<p>"Well first of all this is not your fault. You can't be everywhere. And second how could you have known that this would happen? You are the Slayer and not the Oracle of Sunnydale. You cannot know everything."</p>
<p>"Maybe not, but I could have protected HER. After all, we have spent the..." she stopped herself before she could say too much and let her head sink into her hands and started to cry.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Willow woke up in what seemed to be a tent, built around a tree. She tried to get up but then noticed that she was tied up against that tree. Then suddenly a demon appeared in front of her, almost if he has just been created out of thin air, a small distortion effect seemed to surround it.</p>
<p>"Ahhh... our little slayer-friend is awake. You should better not try to leave this place. You would be dead before you had moved even one foot."</p>
<p>That demon looked at her with a look that could be best identified as a smile. She stopped struggling and took a closer look at it and tried her best to project that picture in Buffy.</p>
<p>"You know, at least some of you could at least try to use a little hygiene?"</p>
<p>"Heh. Funny. You're tied against a tree, caught by a bunch of demons and you think about hygiene."</p>
<p>"Well it's the best... actually... the only thing I can think of, as long as you're here. And since I'm not dead yet, I suppose that you need me for something."</p>
<p>"True my little girl. We need your presence to trap the slayer. But don't think that we need you longer than that. And the more you do to anger me, the sooner you'll be dead. I don't think that the slayer will do much to avoid our trap. Not with that look in her eyes."</p>
<p>"What look?"</p>
<p>"Love, my dear. Love. It's the only thing that causes people to risk their lives for somebody else without thinking. And your little slayer had that look. And we'll use it against her. So if you prefer to live long enough to see her a last time, then keep quiet and don't even think about fleeing."</p>
<p>With that it vaporized again only leaving a small trail of waved air behind it as it left.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"You have spent. what?"</p>
<p>Buffy ignored him, unable to calm down. The only person she could think of at the moment was kidnapped by a group of invisible demons. She was probably the only person that was knowledgeable enough, beside of Giles, to open such a gateway. And Buffy couldn't even think of what she would do if Willow would die.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy, come on, tell me what you wanted to say."</p>
<p>Buffy's head shot up as a image entered it. She could see a demon that seemed to talk but couldn't hear anything.</p>
<p>'Willow? Willow are you there?'</p>
<p>'Oh god Buffy. Am I glad to hear you.'</p>
<p>'Willow, I'll get you out of there. I'll get you out.'</p>
<p>'Buffy, I'm tied up against a tree and from that what I hear there are just too many to fight. Don't risk your life if all you could do here would be dying.'</p>
<p>'Willow I will not allow you to think about that. We'll find a way to get you out and I will not let you be harmed.'</p>
<p>Her connection was cut off as Giles put a hand on her shoulder and shaked her.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy?" He had a concerned look on his face. "Buffy, tell me what you mean. I'm here and I'll listen to whatever you have to say."</p>
<p>"Wha- What? Oh sorry, I was just talking to Willow. She doesn't want me to rescue her. She says it is a trap."</p>
<p>"Buffy what are you talking about? Willow isn't here."</p>
<p>'Should I tell him? It would surely help us to find a solution but I really don't want to go through that whole 'why?' discussion.'</p>
<p>'Buffy, tell him. He will understand.'</p>
<p>Buffy was startled by Willow entering her head again but was fast enough back in Giles living room to see his puzzled face.</p>
<p>'Ok Buffy, then let's tell him' she encouraged to herself.</p>
<p>"Well... it's quite complicated but to say it in its shortest form Willow and I have... sorta a telepathic connection. I really don't know how or why but it's there. It started after I had..." trailing off Buffy wished she hadn't said that last sentence.</p>
<p>"After what?" Giles frowned at the thought that such a thing could be possible but listened to her.</p>
<p>"Uh... well... I think it started after Willow and I... ah... kind of..." she hesitated. She really didn't want to go that far. " ummm... had... I think it started after our visit here on Saturday." she said, relieved that she found way to avoid telling him that she and Willow were together. She was simply not that far yet.</p>
<p>"Hmmm seems another thing that Willow has developed lately."</p>
<p>"Yeah Willow..."</p>
<p>"And you're now in contact with her?"</p>
<p>"Sort of."</p>
<p>"Well then I think I know a way how we can free her."</p>
<p>"Really? That's great. How?"</p>
<p>"Well we'll just tell her what she shall do and none of the demons should actually notice."</p>
<p>"Seems like a great idea. When shall we start?"</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Seems like our little redhead has accepted the way things will go." the demon said appearing in front of Willow.</p>
<p>"No, I'm just imagining how it will be when Buffy arrives here. In a good-for-me-bad-for-you kind of way."</p>
<p>The demon let out a loud laughter and then pierced her up with glowing green eyes.</p>
<p>"You have such a fantasy. It will be a pleasure to see you die."</p>
<p>"I don't really think that that would be a pleasure from your seat in the lounge in hell." she said a wicked smile growing across her face.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that she will send you all back to hell before you have any opportunity to see me die."</p>
<p>"You really have a great fantasy. Maybe I'll turn you and not kill you. It would be of advantage to have such a person in our clan."</p>
<p>"Go to hell!"</p>
<p>"Nah, I don't think so. Been there and came back. But I'll make sure that you'll land there" and with that it vaporized again.</p>
<p>'Willow? Can you hear me?'</p>
<p>'Buffy! Oh I'm so glad to hear you.'</p>
<p>'Nice to hear that but I think me and Giles know a way to rescue you.'</p>
<p>'How?'</p>
<p>'Do you think you can send me a short look at the surroundings?'</p>
<p>'Sure, though there's not much to say other than that I'm in a tent tied against a tree.' and with that she let Buffy see through her eyes.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Ok here's the thing. Willow is tied up against a tree. I'd say about four or five feet thick and she is in a tent about seven or eight yards from one side to the other."</p>
<p>"Ok, then the next step."</p>
<p>'Willow you think you can check if there are any of those demons inside of the tent? I mean with that spell you used yesterday.'</p>
<p>'Should be no problem.'</p>
<p>Buffy heard Willow chant, although she was actually too far away to be able to do that. But she could hear her think the words. After a few minutes of chanting and Giles slowly getting worried she heard Willow talk to her again.</p>
<p>'No demons inside but two a few feet outside guarding the entrance.'</p>
<p>'Okay should be enough for now. We'll tell you the spell to create a gateway inside the tent so that you can keep it open. And hide it. Then all you have to do is lure a few of them into the tent. That should give us the distraction we need to find and rescue you. I just hope that none of those beasts comes in just in that moment.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, Ok Buffy but be careful.'</p>
<p>'You know me. I'm the always-careful slayer.'</p>
<p>With that she opened her eyes and spoke up to tell Giles the development. After a few minutes of explaining he stood up and went to get the book where the spell was listed in. In the meanwhile Buffy went back to talking to Willow through their connection. A connection for which she thanked all gods she knew now.</p>

<p>The two fighters for good soon recognized that they couldn't live forever. Not with their powers. They would be killed sometime during their fight. So they decided to make sure that the powers they held could be given to the next life. To a new human that would be able to fight the dark side and keep them at bay to not allow them to take the mortal realm again.</p>
<p>But they soon found out that it wasn't as easy to give those powers to the next human in the line as they had hoped. They found out that it was much more difficult to give all the powers to two single humans to continue their fight than to split their powers up and give them to a group of humans. And then, when the time came, they would be able to focus the powers and give them to two humans who then would be able to prevent the big attack that hell had sworn to do. They had to find out how to do such a thing and then give the powers to the next.</p>
<p>It has then been decided that in every generation there will be a group of humans that would be able to receive and use parts of the gifts that those two had received from the Powers of Light. It has been decided that those would from then on fight the evil and push them back as long as possible and those humans were given the all the power that was needed to fulfill their destiny. And a conscience that would not let them turn to the dark side.</p>
<p>But hell would once strike again and the two fighters for the mortal realm knew that. They could even figure out when it would strike again. And they knew they had to prevent the Powers of Darkness to reenter this realm. But they also knew that there would be smaller fights to regain control over what the demons had lost. Fights that would not be won if the Warriors for that time weren't given enough power.</p>
<p>So they took advantage of that and decided to give the special fighters sometimes more power. The problem was that it was more difficult to summon the magic than to summon the strength.</p>
<p>And so it came that every 720 years a Sorcerer was born with more powers than normal and every 144 years a Warrior was born with more strength than normal. But due to the attack that all knew would come they needed more to fight it back.</p>
<p>Every 3600 years hell would be able to open a new entrance to the mortal realm and be able to enter it without any problems. And to avoid that, it was necessary to give the two fighters for that event the powers that the first two also had. It was the time when all the powers the mortal realm had were concentrated in those two fighters for the existence of the mortal realm. But it was necessary for that, that those two fighters fought together. It was the only hope this realm had.</p>
<p>And to make sure that those two would fight together the first Warrior and the first Sorceress asked the mortal realm to connect them so that the future fighters would be connected in the same way. It was a connection that could only be activated by love and would, once active, bond those two together for eternity, making their souls immortal and, as soon they gave the powers to the next generation, their body's would be the same. It was a gift that the mortal realm gave them. A gift they received for their holy duty. All those that managed to find the other and fall in love with them would be able to live forever.</p>
<p>Together.</p>

<p>Willow woke up on a small hill. She looked up and saw a willow tree on the top. She started to walk towards it when she noticed an other person nearing it from the other side. She looked at the other person and recognized her.</p>
<p>"Buffy!"</p>
<p>"Willow!"</p>
<p>They ran towards each other. They met on the top just beside the tree and hugged and kissed the other.</p>
<p>"Willow are you ok? I mean you seem ok, but... this... your still tied up against that tree aren't you?"</p>
<p>Willow nodded.</p>
<p>"Well then I suppose we have a dream." Buffy smiled. She was happy to see her lover again, even if it was only a dream.</p>
<p>"But why are we here? Did you do that Will?"</p>
<p>"You are here because we brought you here. You need to learn a few things before you go on." a new voice spoke up startling both girls. They looked into the direction the voice came from and saw two people standing there. A man, seemingly in some kind of armor, and a woman in a wide robe, that seemed to float around her feet.</p>
<p>"And you are...?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"We were the first fighters for this realm." The woman spoke this time.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? The first fighters?"</p>
<p>"Well... to explain that it would take too long. We will do that another time, but for now you must know who you are and why you are here."</p>
<p>"We're waiting."</p>
<p>"Ok to take the short way, you two are keepers of the powers we once held. They were used to fight the evil and prevent them from taking this realm. We have found out that we couldn't do this forever so we gave them to humans that from then on would fight for what we have fought. Every 3600 years the Powers of Darkness are able to open an entrance to this world without any help from this side. This will happen soon and you two are the only ones that can stop that."</p>
<p>"Ok I know that I have saved the world often enough but can't such a thing be done by an other slayer?"</p>
<p>"No, just because you two are the only ones that hold these powers and for the next 3600 years they will not return. It was simply too difficult for us to summon all the powers we had and give them to the next humans. So what we did was give small amounts of the powers to certain humans. A few received the gifts to cast magic like you Willow. Others have received the gifts of great strength and fast healing like you Buffy. You and your fellows the other slayers weren't the only ones that received those gifts but you were those that were noticed by mankind. This is just to explain why the 'Council' thinks all slayers are women. But so much for that. You two have taken the first step to use those powers and preventing the Chaos from entering this realm."</p>
<p>"What step?" Willow, who had been quiet until now, asked.</p>
<p>"By falling in love," the man said. "The only way we knew to, sorry if this sounds rude, force the fighters that would follow us to fight together was to connect them. We asked this realm to help us and this sort of connection you two have is the answer. It started as you two both found out that you love each other. Not the conscious part of your soul, but your heart. You have had shared dreams before you both knew it. The dream where your consciousness finally accepted the love was one of them."</p>
<p>"You mean... THAT was a shared...?" Both girls asked in unison, their eyes widening.</p>
<p>"Yes it was. But this is only the beginning of everything. We came here and brought you to this place to tell you who you are and to warn you, that the time you will need what you have received will come soon. You two have just started to know the powers you two hold. Buffy you are much stronger and faster than you ever thought and Willow your magic is just starting to show itself. Now that you are together you will be able to use those powers. But you still need training. This place here is a place that exists in the real world out there too. It is a place that we have once created and that is hidden, so that only the special fighters, like you two, are able to find it. It is a place where you can train and learn to control your powers. As soon as you wake up you will know where to go. We will wait there for you to help you on your way."</p>
<p>"But... but... Willow is still tied up against that tree and I can't just go there after I wake up. Not when I know that she is still in danger."</p>
<p>Willow smiled as she heard that. She knew it was something that Buffy said automatically, mostly because she was her best friend for over 3 years now, but she was still happy that she could hear it.</p>
<p>"You still have enough time to free her. There is not such a hurry for what you have to do but know that the time, when the evil will enter, will come."</p>
<p>And with that the two people disappeared. Willow looked into Buffy's eyes and was a little shocked about what she had just found out.</p>
<p>"Hey, seems like we're more special than we thought." Buffy smiled</p>
<p>"Yeah. I just hope that you'll come soon. I miss you too much."</p>
<p>"Hey, now I'm here. Maybe it's not the same but I am here. And I will not leave you if it is in any way avoidable."</p>
<p>With that Buffy kissed her lover and they started to lay down onto the grass, slipping one piece of clothing off after the other. It was a wonderful time for both of them and although they knew that they would wake, seperated from each other, up they didn't think about it. They just laid in the grass and loved each other. In more than just one way. </p>
<p>"I love you Will."</p>
<p>"And I love you."</p>
<p>With that both woke up, one in her bed in Giles house, the other tied against a tree. Both sweating and both smiling. Buffy had her hand between her legs and so had Willow. They were both glad about what they had found out and that they, although they were separated, were able to spend the night together.</p>
<p>Now that they knew that they were more than they had thought, they had to learn to control their powers.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"You think they will join us?" the woman asked, again standing under the willow tree.</p>
<p>"They will. And they will prevent once more the destruction of this world."</p>
<p>"I just hope they will come together sooner than we have. I hated the time we were separated."</p>
<p>"So did I my love, so did I."</p>

<p>"Ok, so that is all that we need?"</p>
<p>"Yes. This and your connection with Willow, and we should be able to open one of the gateways in the tent she's in. All we then have to do is to be fast enough there to free her so that she can open another gateway and then we should be able to-"</p>
<p>"Yes Giles, I think we got that. Ok then I'll tell Will that we're ready here."</p>
<p>"Ah.. yes, do that."</p>
<p>'Will, can you hear me?'</p>
<p>'No I can't but I will play the game. Ok so you are ready there?'</p>
<p>'Always up for a joke hah? And I thought that was Xanders way of thinking. Ok so we'll start now. Are you alone?'</p>
<p>'Just a second. Hmmm... yes, no demon in here.'</p>
<p>"She's ready."</p>
<p>"Then let's start."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Poor little redhead. Seems your friend doesn't love you as much as we thought."</p>
<p>Willow was startled as the demon appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"She didn't come. And she wasn't here. That means that she won't come. Bad for you. That means we have no use for you anymore."</p>
<p>'Buffy, hurry. I think they'll kill me if I'm not fast enough out of here.'</p>
<p>"Oh, believe me. She loves me. But she isn't stupid enough to step into a trap. And just for your information, Buffy and I had a wonderful night together."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean that you thought you had her love... and I assume you also thought that you spent the night together. Ah, yes I can smell your arousal. But masturbation isn't the same than spending the night together and I would assume you know that."</p>
<p>"You don't seem to understand. I am more than you think. And I won't let you or anybody else hurt my Buffy."</p>
<p>And with that her head dropped, only to come up again a few seconds later, her eyes glowing and chants leaving her mouth. She didn't know where it came from, she just continued with what she was doing. The rope she was tied against started to glow and then fell off. She looked at the demon, her eyes almost drilling into its head. It couldn't move, couldn't speak. Then she raised her hands and threw the Weaver out of the tent. It smashed against a tree and was immediately dead.</p>
<p>'NOW Buffy!!'</p>
<p>She heard Buffy's words in her head but didn't have any time to listen to them. The guards ran into the tent and Willow did the same with them as with their comrade before. Then she started to feel a power. She couldn't resist it and started to chant again. She felt the energy streaming through her body and leaving her hands as she slowly opened the gateway.</p>
<p>Just in the moment when she was finished another two demons stepped into the doorway. If the gateway wouldn't have sucked them into it she wouldn't even have noticed them.</p>
<p>'Buffy, the hide spell!'</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Fast Giles, I need the hiding spell!"</p>
<p>"Just a second. Ah yes here."</p>
<p>Buffy took a short look at the spell in front of her and sent the picture of it to Willow.</p>
<p>She heard her as she used it. Then she saw through her eyes as the gateway started to disappear.</p>
<p>'Will, stay there. I'm coming. I'll be there as fast as I can.'</p>
<p>'Sure Buffy, no problem.'</p>
<p>She could almost see the smile her wicca must have had on her face now.</p>
<p>"Ok Giles, time to go."</p>
<p>She stood up grabbed the sword and the weaponry bag beside her and headed out of the door, shortly followed by Giles, Xander and Cordelia.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Buffy checked if the glasses were correct adjusted. Then she jumped out of the bush she was hiding in and ran as fast as she could towards the tent where Willow would wait for her. On her way she kicked 3 of the Illusion Weavers down and managed to slice the head off of them. Satisfied with her work she continued her run towards her friend. The closer she came to the tent the more she noticed that there didn't seem to be any of those demons left that attacked her. 'Damn they must have found out that there is a gateway in there. Or they're just scared. Whatever it is I should be grateful for it.'</p>
<p>Then she was hit and thrown through the air. She didn't know where it came from cause she thought she had checked everything in that direction. She did a second sweep with her glasses as she landed but wasn't able to see anything.</p>
<p>"Oh, little slayer... you don't really think I'm stupid enough to let you see me. I know how to avoid such things." What then followed could only be identified by maniacal laughter. Then she felt it. A prank that lifted her up in the air and threw her good 30 feet over to the tent.</p>
<p>"Big mistake, you bastard." 'Willow, you think you can make that one visible?'</p>
<p>'I can try, but I have to know where it is to track him down.'</p>
<p>'Ok next time he lifts me up you'll know where it is.'</p>
<p>'Buffy you can't be serious. He could kill you if you let him that near.'</p>
<p>'I really don't think I have a choi-'</p>
<p>Buffy was kicked over half the clearing and crashed right into a tree. The sword she had managed to hold until then dropped as the impact drove the air out of her lungs. Willow, who now knew where the demon was started to chant the short spell and only a few seconds later she and Buffy could see this one. It was bigger than the last one, almost 10 feet high. And it was fast. Almost too fast but Buffy managed to get up in time and duck under the punch away. And now that she could see it, it wasn't difficult for the slayer to repel the attacks. And after a little help from Willow, who managed to stop all the movements like with the first one, Buffy managed to break its neck and the demon dropped into a lumpy heap on the ground.</p>
<p>"Willow, do you think you could open a really big one above the clearing?" the slayer said walking over to her lover and with an almost wicked smile on her face.</p>
<p>"Ahh..hmm.. I think I could try that."</p>
<p>"You don't try it. Do it or don't do it that's all I want from you."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>With that Willow started to chant, gathering all her energy together and a gateway formed. First small but steadily growing it sucked one demon after the other into it. Screams of agony could be heard throughout the whole forrest. Soon the clearing was absolutely quiet except for the walking sounds of the rest of the scoobies who came towards them. Willow collapsed on the floor completely exhausted. Buffy jumped over to her and caught her just in time to prevent her from dropping on to the ground.</p>
<p>'Hey Buffy, you think we should tell them now?'</p>
<p>'Why tell them and not show them?'</p>
<p>That was enough for Buffy to let her smile become wicked. Willow smiled back and only seconds later they stood there, kissing as if they have been years apart. Giles froze and just looked dumbfounded at the scene that was playing in front of him. Xander walked up to his side.</p>
<p>"Now just say you didn't know that."</p>
<p>"Know what?" Cordelia asked, as she was up to the other two. Xander just pointed at the two girls in front of him. The answer he received was Cordy's jaw hanging open while she stared at what just happened in front of her.</p>
<p>"Now come on, don't tell me I was the only one that knew this."</p>
<p>"Ah..yes... well... I think we should gather our stuff and go back home. And you two have quite some explaining to do, little girls."</p>
<p>"Giles, first we aren't 'little girls' anymore and second I think Willow and I have something else to do before, but we'll be there soon. And, no Giles, it is not what you think. I'll explain it later. But now we have a small date with some really old people."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"So here are we now. What to do next?"</p>
<p>"Now we'll teach you to work with what you have." A new voice entered the quietness around the willow tree.</p>

<p>Giles and Cordelia listened carefully to what the two lovers told them. Xander had went into the kitchen to get something to eat after the part concerning the 'lovers' had started.</p>
<p>"So you two have the same powers as those two, and they were the first on this realm?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"More or less. They weren't the first humans here, they were the first real fighters for this world. They were humans that were given the powers from the 'Mortal Realm' combined with the knowledge and some power of the heavenly forces...yeah I think that's what they called it.They told us that in some cases the powers are more on the side of the magic, in other cases the Warrior gets more of it. But together we have exactly the same powers as they had."</p>
<p>"And you say that they are immortal?" this time it was Cordelia who asked.</p>
<p>"They are and we will be as soon as we give the powers to the next generation. Or at least that is what they told us." Willow smiled. She very much liked the thought of being able to stay with Buffy for such a long time.</p>
<p>"And tell me again why you don't do this now, but later?"</p>
<p>"Because they said that it was a little too difficult to give the powers they had to only two humans of the next generation. They had to split it up and every 3600 years when the 'Powers of Darkness', as they called it, are able to open a portal to this world, they have enough strength to focus all the power again into two humans. And in this cycle, Willow and I are those two chosen ones, as silly as this may sound at the moment. And in the next 3600 years they will be too weak to focus those powers again."</p>
<p>"Ok, I think I understand this now. Did they tell you when you will have encounter this threat?"</p>
<p>"Except for 'soon'? No. They just said that we would have enough time to learn to control our powers. But from what I have seen how strong Wills already is I don't know how long that could be."</p>
<p>"Well I hope we have enough time to work this out. I really don't want to battle hell all too soon. I think we really have earned us a short break." Cordy said.</p>
<p>"Ah.. yes..well it seems that we have always underestimated you two. I am just glad that you are on our side."</p>
<p>"Giles you don't have to do that. Don't you see that you embarrass them?" Xander came back with a piece of cake and a huge pile of whipped cream on top.</p>
<p>'You know, as much as I like it how Giles looks when he's blushing, I really know better ways of using this time.' Buffy squeezed Willows hand.</p>
<p>"Buffy!"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>'You know exactly what I meant.'</p>
<p>'Do I?'</p>
<p>'Yes you do Buffy. And don't play this game, they all know about what we have.'</p>
<p>"Ok, ok, you are absolutely right Wills."</p>
<p>"Well...I think we know enough for the moment. I just have to find out what we can do to help you two in the coming fight."</p>
<p>"Giles we really appreciate your help, but we have no clue what will happen ourselves. We will meet Birgit and Christopher in a few days and then we'll try to find a few things out that will help us but until then you can relax. You don't have to explain everything. Especially not those things that you wouldn't be able to find anyway without more details."</p>
<p>"Well...maybe you're right. I think we should stop this debate for now and just enjoy the peace we have at the moment."</p>
<p>"Thanks Giles. You know Buffy, I think we should go back to the dorm. I still have some homework I have to do."</p>
<p>"Sure, anything else Giles?"</p>
<p>"No... no I don't think so."</p>
<p>"Ok then we'll see ya all tomorrow. Bye Giles, Bye Xandman, Cordy."</p>
<p>"Yes tomorrow." Giles muttered.</p>
<p>With a few 'byes' hanging in the air Willow was being tugged out of the house just to stop there and be kissed.</p>
<p>"You know I like the way you think about homework lately."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>'Do the words: "I still have some homework I have to do with Buffy, on Buffy," remember you of something?'</p>
<p>Willow blushed. "I...you know that I... I just wanted to-" Buffy stopped her babble mode with a fast kiss.</p>
<p>"I know exactly what you meant. And as much as I like it here, it is although a little too public."</p><p>"Yeah I think your right. Come on I... WE have some homework to do."</p><p>Willow squeezed Buffy's hand and ran with her off to the dorm. They still had a few issues that they had to discuss but that would have to wait until after the 'Homework'.</p>
