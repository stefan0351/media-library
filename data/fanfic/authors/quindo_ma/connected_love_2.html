<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 1: Thoughts and Dreams -->

<p>It was a quite typical summer day in Sunnydale. And there were no demons or vampires left since the incident with the mayor. Most left before the ascension of the mayor and the rest left after Buffy and the rest of the graduate's had foiled the ascension. So it has been quite quiet in the underworld and Buffy and her friends could do what high school graduate's did during the holidays. They hung around, learned for college (well at least a little) and talked about this and that. Mostly they just hung around together.</p>
<p>Oz was out on a gig in Chicago and Cordelia had left Sunnydale after graduation. So there were only Buffy, Willow and Xander and well... Giles left in Sunnydale. But he was trying to get a job at the library at the UC Sunnydale... since 3 weeks now. And he really wasn't very lucky at that. In the beginning the college was grateful to find somebody to keep an eye at the library but after they heard where he worked before they said that they had to think about it again. And now Giles tried to convince them to let him work there because else he would have been without a work and... well let's just say that he really tried to stay near Buffy even though he wasn't her watcher anymore.</p>
<p>Well this wasn't really a typical day since Xander wanted to make a self-finding trip through the states and he wanted to leave next Monday, which was in 4 days. So the gang stayed a little more together than normal to have as much time together as possible before he left.</p>
<p>But that Xander wanted to leave wasn't the reason why Buffy gazed at Willow. She just was there looking at Willow and listened to one of her cute babbles, well at least Buffy thought that they were cute. She didn't even know why she thought that she just did. And she also didn't really hear what Willow said; she was just listening to her voice and gazed at her. She was completely lost in the sound of Willows voice.</p>
<p>Buffy had had such thoughts before. She liked Willows voice and the way she sometimes started to babble uncontrolled. But she always had shrugged those thoughts off and told herself that that was just imagination and that this was only because Willow was her friend... but that couldn't be all that she felt for Willow... FRIENDSHIP. It was just a too strong feeling she had, especially in the last three weeks after school had ended. Or blown up whatever you call it.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy? Can u hear me?" Willow asked a hand on Buffy's shoulder shaking her softly. Buffy felt the warmth of Willow's hand and she liked it.</p>
<p>"Buffy? C'mon u can tell me. What's wrong?" Willow asked her again shaking a little more this time.</p>
<p>Buffy startled a little then saw the worried look in Willow's eyes and then shrugged those feelings off again.</p>
<p>"Hmm...? Oh sorry, I was just in thoughts. What did u say?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I was just questioning Xander what he thought he wanted to do on his trip when I noticed that u had left this planet." Willow smiled. "So what's wrong? You only have that look when you don't know what to do with a problem and since there are no monsters or demons or sixty feet long snakes that want to eat us for breakfast... or any vampires that want to eat you for dinner...". She was babbling again and Buffy thought it was kinda funny... and cute -that feeling again- " and since there is no nothing here that could harm you you must have a problem with something else. Is it maybe something I did?" Willow became less self-confident with that question and Buffy could see it.</p>
<p>"No, No, it's nothing you did or Xander or even Oz or Cordy, I just was thinking about this and that." Buffy answered. She knew it wasn't the truth because she knew that it had something to do with Willow, something very special about Willow. But she couldn't tell Willow her thoughts about her and she didn't like it when Willow was sad about her or anything else. All these thoughts rushed through Buffy's brain without stopping long enough for her to think about them. All she knew was that they were there. "No, Will it has nothing to do with something u did. It's just about the ascension and what almost happened here. I'm glad it's over and I was just thinking about it, and Faith and..." she trailed off.</p>
<p>"Oh..." was all Willow could say.</p>
<p>"Now are you two ladies gonna stop living in the past? Because it is past and we can do nothing to make it undone. And by the way I was just telling you two what I think I should do on my trip, but if nobody wants to hear it then finnneee...." he said drawing the last word out.</p>
<p>"Sorry" both the slayer and the hacker said in chorus. "Go on tell us about your plans in finding yourself." Buffy teased with a smirk on her face. That got a glare back from Xander but he started to talk again and Buffy could start to think about what the last few minutes had brought up in here.</p>
<p>Willow turned back to Xander and started listening and he told her all about what he planned to do and where he planned to go and so on. The whole talk about that took about 45 minutes before Buffy -she couldn't hear this any longer- said " How bout a film night, my mother isn't at home and we could borrow a few films and watch them. That way we could kinda say goodbye to you Xander and you could finally stop boring me with this. This is your trip not mine." Buffy grinned and received a look that could kill her from Xander but he then agreed and Willow said that she had to get something from home before but that she would be there later.</p>
<p>So they split up Willow went home and Buffy and Xander headed for the next video store to borrow a few films.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Willow went home slower than she had thought but with her mind at this level of activity she just couldn't concentrate on that enough. She just had to think about what just had happened to her as she saw Buffy so... well... sad. She had looked in Buffy's eyes and she had felt a sting as she saw the worries in her eyes. She wasn't sure what really happened or why but she was sure that she had to think about it. She had to think a lot about it. And that was the reason why she had told Buffy she had to go home first. She walked through the streets from the park to her house and when she arrived there she just stood in front of the house until her mother saw her and came out.</p>
<p>"Why are you standing out here? You should get in dinner is ready." She said.</p>
<p>Willow startled as her mother put her hands on her shoulders and asked her that. She didn't even notice it when she arrived there she was still thinking about her. About Buffy. And she wasn't even near an answer as her mother brought her back to earth.</p>
<p>"Pardon? Mom? What are you doing here?" she asked still thinking she was in the park.</p>
<p>"Willow are you fine? Your at home. Now come in dinner is ready." Her mother answered.</p>
<p>Willow looked at her surroundings and noticed where she was, then she remembered what she had done and what she had promised Buffy.</p>
<p>"I'm fine mom just a little in thoughts. May I sleep over at Buffy? Xander is going to leave on Monday and we want to have a last video night before he leaves." Willow said</p>
<p>"Is Ms. Summers at home?" was all her mother asked.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure but I think that Buffy mentioned that she's in the gallery and that she'll come home a little late."</p>
<p>"Well... ok but call me when you are there ok?"</p>
<p>"Sure mom. No problem." Willow said and headed for her room to get her present she had bought for Xander. She had wanted to give it to him before he left but she thought now that this would be a better occasion for that. She went up and fetched the small amulet she had left on her desk. She opened it to make sure the photo was still inside and then headed back down to the kitchen and said goodbye to her mom. Then she headed out and began to walk towards Buffy's house.</p>
<p>She began to think again but made sure that she noticed at least a little of her surroundings on her way to Buffy to avoid that experience she just had in front of her own house.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>The doorbell rang and Buffy headed to open it. Willow was outside and smiled as she saw Buffy. She entered the Summers home and headed for the living room.</p>
<p>"What took you so long Will?" Xander asked as he heard the hello's she and Buffy exchanged.</p>
<p>"Had to fetch your 'Don't-forget-us-because-we-are-your-best-friends' amulet I bought u" Willow smirked.</p>
<p>"You bought me what?"</p>
<p>"A amulet. I have played witch a little and put a protection spell on it." She smirked again.</p>
<p>"Well I think that comes in really handy because I can need protection since I don't always want to look behind my back if any vamp is there right Buffy?" he asked looking at her.</p>
<p>"Sure, protection is always good."</p>
<p>Willow headed to Xander and handed the amulet to him. "Open it." Willow suggested.</p>
<p>He did as he was told and froze as he saw the photo inside. It showed all of the gang: him, Willow, Buffy, Oz, Giles and.... Cordelia.</p>
<p>After the incident between him and Willow and the break up between him and Cordelia he hadn't been amongst those who talked good about her. Well not until the prom night. Willow noticed the looks between him and Cordy that night and even though she wasn't sure why they were friendly and what had happened she knew that they belonged together. And after she had noticed the small heart the always seemed to carry with her after that she definitely knew that something had happened between them again. And that was the reason for her to use a photo with her on it.</p>
<p>After a moment Xander looked up to Willow, tears in his eyes and just said "Thank you. Thank you very much Will."</p>
<p>She looked over to Buffy and noticed the look in her eyes and mouthed 'Cordelia' and Buffy understood. She had also seen those looks between them that night and she was sure the only reason why they weren't together again yet was because Cordy had left town.</p>
<p>"Ok enough tears for now this is meant to be a video night and I think we can start now" Buffy suggested and the other two agreed.</p>
<p>The girls sat on the couch and Xander in the chair and watched 'The Net' with Sandra Bullock, one of Willow's favorites and she was smiling almost the whole film. Almost. Because as she noticed the look in Buffy's eyes, as she noticed the same look as in the afternoon she just couldn't concentrate on the film any longer. She fell back into those thoughts she had on her way home and what could have happened to her. As Buffy noticed that Willow wasn't smiling to the film anymore she looked into her eyes and smiled a hope-giving smile and Willow smiled back and turned back to the TV and started to look again.</p>
<p>They looked about 4 other films before they all were sleeping. Buffy woke up at about 5am and got blankets for her friends and then went to bed to think about everything.</p>
<p>She dreamed.</p>
<p>She stood on a cemetery but she wasn't sure which one, all she saw were graves, no names no nothing just the graves.</p>
<p>She started to walk towards a person. It was Willow. She stood in front of a grave looking down and crying. Buffy read the name. It was her own. She asked Willow what happened. She answered that she just died. No vampires. No demons. No accidents. She just died. Buffy put her arm around Willow and told her that she wouldn't die. She wouldn't leave Willow alone with all those demons around. She wouldn't leave. Then the grave disappeared and she suddenly stood in the gym. Alone. She wore the dress she wore in the prom night. Then Willow came in. Also in her prom dress. They stood there for what seemed a eternity then music started. A slow song. Then Buffy started to dance with Willow. She didn't know why she just did. Their faces neared, their lips met and...</p>
<p>She woke up.</p>
<p>"What the hell just happened?" she asked herself. Then she turned around and slept on.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Next morning she woke up and smelled the scent of pancakes and got up. She always had liked pancakes but hadn't had any in a while. Mostly because she just wasn't good enough in the kitchen and her mom didn't make them often.</p>
<p>She went down and into the kitchen and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>"Morning" Willow said. Buffy noticed that she was happy. Not so loaded with thoughts like yesterday.</p>
<p>"Morning Will, did you make those pancakes?"</p>
<p>"Yep I love pancakes but my mom doesn't have the ingredients at home so I don't come to make them often." She smiled.</p>
<p>"I love them too, I'm just an absolute anti-cook." Buffy said and smiled too. She didn't even notice it she just smiled as she saw that Willow smiled too. A few long moments they just stood there smiling before Xander broke the silence as he entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Mmmhhhh.. Pancakes, how wonderful. Just the right thing to start a day." He said "where's your syrup Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Second cupboard from right, above the refrigerator." She answered still smiling at Willow.</p>
<p>Xander headed to fetch the syrup and noticed the gazes the two girls exchanged.</p>
<p>"Are you two in some kind of telepathic conversation or what. C'mon lets munch these pancakes and get back to the TV to finish what we started yesterday." Xander said.</p>
<p>Buffy gave him a look and then started to pile the pancakes on her plate. Willow finished the rest of the dough she had made for the pancakes and then grabbed a plate and started to get some of the delicious pieces too. After about 20 minutes of munching, almost gulping, and a few tries to talk during that time which all ended up in a disaster as one of them swallowed the wrong way and coughed and the other two started to laugh and swallowed the wrong way too and everything almost coming back up. They stopped trying to talk after the third incident and just kept on eating.</p>
<p>Then they headed back into the living room and put in another film. 'The fifth Element' one of Xander's favorites and both girls could guess why. With a smirk they sat onto the sofa and started watching.</p>
<p>After another 5 films, it must have been about 6pm then, they all headed home and Buffy had enough time with her thoughts now.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Xander and Willow headed to Willow's house first and then Xander went home too.</p>
<p>"And how was the day sweetheart?" her mother asked.</p>
<p>"Films, films and more films..." Willow answered with exaggerated boredom a smirk on her face that showed that it was a joke. Her mother smiled and told her that dinner was ready in about one hour and that she should take a shower before she joined. Willow agreed in that and headed to her room to undress and get her toiletries and then went into the bathroom. She turned on the water and then went in and just stood there and let the warm water run over her face. She liked it when she could do that, she loved it and she did it whenever she could.</p>
<p>But today it was a bit different. She had a strange dream last night. She dreamed that she stood on a graveyard in front of Buffy's grave and she was crying. Then suddenly Buffy showed up beside her and asked her how she had died. Willow didn't know how she just knew that she died during her sleep. Then Buffy told her that she would never leave Willow alone and her tears weren't any longer tears of sadness about a tragic loss but they were tears of happiness now. The next thing she remembered was that she was dancing with Buffy. A slow song. On the prom. Beautiful dresses. And then Buffy kissed her. That was when she woke up. She had been happy after that dream, she didn't know why but she was. She had thought a few times during the day about that but since she wasn't alone she shrugged it off and assured herself to think later about it when she was alone.</p>
<p>Now she was alone, thinking about this and about what that kiss could have meant. By the time her mother called her to come down she was not a singe inch closer to the answer than before. After dinner she went to bed in the hope that the answer would come in the sleep.</p>
<p>It didn't. It only threw more questions into the small redheaded brain of Willow.</p>
<p>But the strangest thing was that dream she had.</p>
<p>She woke up in a bed. Buffy was in there too, snuggled up to her. She also just seemed to wake up. Then both startled as they saw each other, jumping out of the bed. Then Willow noticed the shock in Buffy's eyes. It wasn't the shock that she just had woken up, snuggled into her best friend. It was the shock that somebody has when they discover something they never had thought possible. Willow noticed that she also was shocked. She knew why her Buffy was shocked both had the same shock in their faces. Then she became aware of something that she just had thought. She thought 'HER Buffy' and it overcame her all in one moment of clearness. She hadn't thought it because this was her dream and that wasn't the real Buffy. At least she thought that after she woke up. She had that special thought because she needed Buffy. Her Buffy. She... she... she couldn't speak it out she couldn't even think of it even though she knew it was there. She was sure it was there and then she noticed that same thing in Buffy's eye. Then she said it. She didn't even notice that she had said it until it was out and that thing that came from Buffy at the same time made her realize what had just happened.</p>
<p>"I LOVE YOU BUFFY" she said in her dream. At the same time Buffy said "I LOVE YOU WILLOW".</p>
<p>They were just about to get closer together when she woke up.</p>
<p>She shot up, unable... unwilling to accept what just had happened and went into the bathroom. She stood there, in front of the basin and spilled cold water over her face.</p>
<p>Then, when she was able to get a clear thought it shot into her mind.</p>
<p>"I love you Buffy Summers and I don't know what I shall do know." was all that she could say.</p>
<p>She stood there for at least 10 minutes spilling cold water onto her face trying to get a clear thought except that 'I love Buffy' thought into her mind. It didn't work. Then she went back to bed. Just as she laid down the phone rang. It was Buffy.</p>
<p>"Will, are you ok?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm fine. Why are you calling me so late?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I just had this strange dream. I was worried about you. You're really fine?"</p>
<p>"Yes I'm fine, you can go back and sleep now."</p>
<p>"Ok, sorry for waking you up."</p>
<p>"You didn't wake me, I had a nightmare but don't worry I'm fine."</p>
<p>"Ok, hope you have a better sleep now. Good night."</p>
<p>"Night Buffy."</p>
