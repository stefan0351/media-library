<!-- Is This Love \ Part 3 -->

<p>The sobs came to a sudden stop and Sam turned to find Brooke's tearstained face glaring at her from the bed.</p>

<p>"Ever heard of privacy, McPherson?"</p>

<p>The words were spoken quietly and there was no real venom behind them, but the hurt in Brooke's voice was painfully evident, and it broke Sam's heart to know that she'd wounded the girl she loved so deeply. Closing the door gently behind her Sam took a few tentative steps into the room. Shoving her hands into her pockets, the journalist shifted awkwardly from one foot to the other, head down and eyes trained on her own feet.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Brooke," she whispered softly. "I just... I-I didn't mean to..." she tried to explain without much success, inwardly groaning at her own inadequacy.</p>

<p>"You hurt me."</p>

<p>The voice was quiet and filled with pain, and coming from unexpectedly close quarters. Sam's head snapped up and she was shocked to lock eyes with wounded hazel orbs at an extremely close range. She hadn't even heard the other girl move.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she whispered again, her brown eyes welling with unshed tears. "I'm so very sorry." Brooke gazed into Sam's remorseful eyes for an undeterminable amount of time before nodding gently and, without a word, pulled the startled brunette into a warm hug.</p>

<p>"Please don't ever do that again," Brooke spoke softly into her ear, her voice breaking slightly.</p>

<p>"I won't," Sam vowed quietly as she let her arms hesitantly close around the slender frame of the cheerleader. The moment was so sweet that it almost hurt, and Sam couldn't resist burying her head in the blonde's inviting neck and inhale deeply, her eyes fluttering closed. God, she smelled so good. 'Vanilla and softness.'</p>

<p>She realized her mistake a second later when she felt Brooke stiffen and start to pull away in surprise.</p>

<p>"Di-Did you just... smell me?" Brooke asked in an incredulous voice, staring unblinkingly at the journalist with wide eyes.</p>

<p>Sam opened and closed her mouth several times but nothing came out. Panic welled inside her and she desperately tried to avoid Brooke's piercing gaze as her body broke out in a cold sweat. Chocolate brown eyes flickered restlessly all over the room, never staying in one place for long as she thought furiously of what to say.</p>

<p>"Uh... no..." she lied unconvincingly, still not meeting Brooke's hazel gaze. "Don't b-be ridiculous! It was... I-It was just... I just took a normal breath... t-that's all," she stuttered and started to stumble backwards toward the door and freedom. God, she needed to get out before she gave herself away completely. 'Please Brooke, just let it go,' Sam prayed silently.</p>

<p>Brooke, however, had no intention of letting anything go. She closely pursued the brunettes hasty retreat until she had the nervous girl pinned up against the door, with no way to escape. Putting each hand on either side of Sam's pale, slightly sweaty face, she leaned in so that they were nose to nose with each other. Sam's panicked retreat and reluctance to meet her gaze had been the sign of something Brooke had been waiting a very long time to see. Was Sam feeling something more than sisterly towards her? 'Please God, let it be so,' she thought as she desperately tried to read Sam's expression.</p>

<p>Brooke had been hiding her true feelings for her reluctant housemate for a very long time now. It had literally been love at first sight for the blonde cheerleader, but with Sam's obvious contempt for popularity, fashion and everything else that Brooke stood for, being together had seemed like noting but an unattainable dream. The fact that Sam had always come off as very straight, first with George and more recently with Harrison, hadn't really increased her chances either.</p>

<p>But now Brooke began to see things in a new light. The warm glances they'd shared, the increases in friendly touches when they talked about stuff, not to mention the awkward silences of late. Everything suddenly added up and received a brand new meaning. And now... She was almost positive that Sam had indeed been smelling her during the hug, and the brunettes almost frantic denial of the action only condemned her more in Brooke's eyes. Maybe there was a chance for something to happen between them after all? But Brooke knew that she needed to act quickly, while Sam's guard was down, or she'd never get the stubborn girl to admit to anything.</p>

<p>Deciding to go for broke, she leaned in even closer, pressing her whole body intimately against Sam while her heart fluttered wildly inside her chest.</p>

<p>"Want to know what I think, Sam?" she purred softly, hazel eyes never leaving the slightly frightened chocolate brown orbs of the journalist. "I think the reason you've been acting so weird lately," she continued, not giving the other girl a chance to say anything. "Is because you like me."</p>

<p>Sam could only blink in response. Her heart was pounding in her ears and her breathing had grown shallow due to the sheer proximity of the other girl. The feel of Brooke's body, pressed up so tightly against her own, pinning her against the door, was making it impossible for her to think clearly. She felt her cheeks color slightly as the mere sound of Brooke's voice caused her to feel a growing wetness soaking through her panties.</p>

<p>"Yes, you like me," Brooke continued quietly, her eyes slowly wandering down the other girls face until they reached her full, red lips. Sam was panting softly and as Brooke watched, a pink tongue made a quick appearance, leaving a moist trail on the full, slightly parted lips. The sight alone, made all the blood in Brooke's body pool in her belly, and she swallowed hard at the sudden feeling of lightheadedness. Cupping the brunettes face tenderly she leaned in even closer to the trembling girl. "But it's not in a sisterly way, is it Sam?" She husked softly into a small, delicate ear, her voice somewhat tinged with a hoarse quality.</p>

<p>'Please God, don't let it be in a sisterly way, or I'm about to make the biggest mistake in my life,' she thought as she, unable to hold back any longer, leaned in and kissed Sam softly on the lips.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>The gentle lips moving against her own - tasting - caressing - had Sam almost spinning out of control. She couldn't believe this was truly happening. Brooke McQueen was actually kissing her, and she kept waiting for her alarm clock to go off, brutally waking her from this wonderful dream.</p>

<p>But no alarm sounded.</p>

<p>With a soft sigh, Brooke reluctantly ended the kiss and leaned back a little to gauge Sam's reaction. Not quite able to fully relinquish the incredibly delectable lips before her, the cheerleader lightly ran a thumb over the journalist's full bottom lip.</p>

<p>"God, I've wanted to do that for the longest time," Brooke breathed softly, still slightly in a daze after the magnificent kiss. 'That was incredible.'</p>

<p>"Me too," Sam confessed shyly. "And I want to do it again," she whispered as she brought her hands up behind Brooke's neck and pulled her back in.</p>

<p>Sinking back into the unbelievable softness that was Brooke McQueen's lips, Sam couldn't seem to get close enough. Running an unyielding tongue over succulent lips, the young journalist determinedly demanded, and was quickly granted, access to the blonde's eager mouth. Uttering a soft moan at the divine sensations coursing trough her body due to the delicious touch, the brunette greedily explored every nook and cranny she could reach. Only when the need for air nearly drove them both to asphyxiation did she relent and pull back slightly.</p>

<p>Brooke was having serious difficulties tearing her gaze off Sam's kiss-swollen red lips. They were so soft and tasted so sweet and she found herself becoming quickly addicted, but not minding one bit. Powerless to resist, the blonde let out a small whimper, and once again leaned in and brushed their lips together for another heated exchange.</p>

<p>Somewhere during the kiss, Brooke's hands somehow managed to find their way inside Sam's t-shirt, starting a torturous tracing of the soft warm skin she found there. The caresses soon caused Sam to rip her mouth away to pull in a ragged breath and moan as her body arched helplessly into the delicious touch. At the loss of Sam's lovely mouth, the blonde instead started showering the brunette with moist tender kisses wherever she could reach.</p>

<p>Desperately wanting to share with Brooke what she herself was feeling, Sam hungrily kissed down the blonde's smooth neck as her hands started their own exploration down the supple body of the head cheerleader. Gentle hands and nimble fingers trailed slowly down strong shoulders and a trim waist, finally landing on the alluring swell of the blonde's buttocks. Letting out a low growl, Sam bit down gently on Brooke's neck and squeezed the lithe flesh of her butt-cheeks, her actions wringing a keening sound of pleasure from deep inside Brooke's throat and an immediate bucking motion from the girls pelvis area. The sound alone set every one of Sam's nerve endings aflame and she began grinding herself uncontrollably into the cheerleader's body, almost crazed with the need to get even closer.</p>

<p>The feel of Sam's lips and hands on her body, coupled with the sensations of Sam grinding into her, was driving Brooke almost frantic with desire. The need for the brunette grew almost unbearable and she started to pull the willing journalist backwards with her towards her bed. The sudden hinder, as she bumped into the edge of the bed, caused her to loose her balance and fall down on the soft surface, unceremoniously tugging Sam with her in the fall. Rolling over, she quickly straddled the prone journalist, pinning her to the bed, and once again started showering the girl with affectionate kisses as her hands eagerly attempted to divest the brunette of her shirt.</p>

<p>"What are we doing?" Sam gasped out between the intense kisses bestowed on her lips and face by the amorous cheerleader, as she allowed Brooke to remove her t-shirt. She was feeling too hot to wear the blasted thing anyway.</p>

<p>"Don't know," Brooke managed, her brain short-circuiting at the sight of a lacy beige bra barely covering the soft swell of Sam's breasts. "Oh God," she whimpered and without warning dipped her head down and placed her mouth over one of the soft mounds. Sucking gently through the lacy material, her action caused Sam to utter a guttural sound and arch helplessly under her touch.</p>

<p>"Sweet Jesus!... Wait Brooke... p-please, wait!" Sam croaked, wrapping her hands in the cheerleaders golden locks, trying to force eye contact.</p>

<p>Somehow, Sam's pleading voice managed to cut through the sexual haze that had permeated Brooke since they'd landed in her bed, and she fastened anxious eyes on the brunette, suddenly worried that she'd gone to far.</p>

<p>"W-What's wrong," she wondered nervously, starting to pull back. "I thought you wanted... I mean, d-didn't you...?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I do want," Sam assured, tenderly cupping Brooke's face in her hands, her words and actions effectively easing the cheerleader's fears. Unable to resist, Sam placed a soft kiss on the blonde's swollen lips, before once again meeting her eyes shyly. "I just need to... w-what are we doing? A couple of minutes ago we were fighting, and now we're..."</p>

<p>"Tongue wrestling?" Brooke supplied with a grin.</p>

<p>"Uh..." Sam blushed faintly and arched an eyebrow at the blonde's sudden comic side. "I guess... but... is that all this is?" she wondered softly, suddenly no longer able to meet the hazel eyes so close to her own. "Is it just a one time thing? A-a game? And afterwards, are we simply supposed to go back to the way we were or..." She was silenced from rambling further by a pair of warm fingers gently placed over her lips.</p>

<p>"No," Brooke whispered softly while gazing adoringly into Sam's chocolate orbs. "It's not a game McPherson, it never was. And it's certainly not a one time thing... at least I hope not," she added, uncertainty coloring her voice for a second. "I love you, Samantha McPherson, and I want to be with you. I don't know where this thing will lead us eventually, but I do know that I want to give this... us... a chance."</p>

<p>Sam felt her eyes filling with tears at the sincere words spoken by the blonde girl, and releasing a sound, that was half-sob half-laughter, she pulled Brooke into a bone crushing hug. "I love you, Brooke" she breathed out with relief and buried her face into the cheerleader's smooth neck. "And... I want you too," she whispered shyly.</p>

<p>Feeling all her tension slip away at those simple words, Brooke's playful side reemerged once again. "You love me, huh? Guess this means I can call you Sammy again," she grinned.</p>

<p>A mischievous smile spread over Sam's features and her eyes started to twinkle merrily. "You can call me anything you want," she stated teasingly, her suggestive tone leaving the blonde momentarily stunned. She soon regained her wit, however, a smile slowly spreading across her face.</p>

<p>"Good..." Brooke purred throatily and bent down brushing their lips together again. "I'll be sure to remember that when we're back in school, my little honeysuckle," she kidded gently. "Now where were we?"</p>

<p>Sam chuckled softly and guided Brooke back to her chest. "I'm not quite sure, but I seem to remember you being... uhhhh... yes, right there McQueen," she moaned raggedly as the blonde girl found where she'd left off.</p>

<p>"Mmmm," Brooke hummed with appreciation. "I do believe that this might be the beginning of a beautiful relationship."</p>

<p>"Less talking, more action McQueen," Sam growled out, playfully swatting the blonde over the head.</p>

<p>"Ohhh... I love it when you're commanding, McPherson," Brooke giggled and then let out a surprised squeal as Sam suddenly reversed their positions.</p>

<p>"Well princess, prepare to get dazzled!" was the fierce answer before the rest of the world faded away into nothingness in the exchange of tender touches and gentle laughter.</p>
