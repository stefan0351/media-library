<!-- Best Trip Ever \ null -->

<p>Hiding behind a big tree, waiting on baited breath,
she watched as her unsuspecting target slowly drew
closer. She felt her heart pounding in her chest as
she carefully took aim and launched her attack. The
round weapon sailed beautifully through the air in a
perfect arch and hit the intended target squarely in
the face with a soft poof.</p>
<p>The look of pure, wide-eyed surprise on Sam's face,
mixed with the snow that now slowly melted and made
its way down her cheeks in rivulets was enough to send
Brooke into almost hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>"Gotcha McPherson!" She managed to wheeze out as she
attempted to catch her breath while tears of laughter
poured from her hazel eyes.</p>
<p>"Why you little..." Sam ground out with mock ferocity as
she wiped at her face with her gloved hands. "You're
sooooo gonna pay for that one McQueen!"</p>
<p>"Oh, puuhlease!" Brooke snorted disdainfully, not the
least bit worried. "You couldn't catch a cold if
someone hit you over the head with it!"</p>
<p>Barely had the words left her mouth when her eyes
widened to an almost comical degree and she let out a
squeal at the sight of a rapidly approaching Sam.
Turning on her heel she took off running as fast as
she could down the snowy slope with the other girl in
hot pursuit, laughter trickling in the wake of the two
teenagers.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>It had all started rather innocently just a week
before when Mike had suddenly sprung a winter vacation
surprise on his family. Two weeks in a semi-secluded
cabin, courtesy of an old friend, with walking
distance to some of the very best slopes in the
country. In other words; the perfect chance for them
all to bond without the pressure of school, work and
demanding outer influences. It would also give them
some much-needed time to spend with the newest
addition to the McQueen-McPherson clan.</p>
<p>Mackenzie had arrived into the family just a few
months prior but neither Mike nor the teenagers had
really had time to get to know the little tyke, both
school and work stubbornly getting in the way.</p>
<p>Sam and Brooke's first reaction to the news had
naturally been to object, rather vehemently. Not to
the part of spending time with Mac of course, but the
idea of two whole weeks with nobody your own age to
talk to but your soon to be stepsister was not very
tempting to either teen. Sure, since the birth of
little Mac things had started to settle down somewhat,
but it was still slightly strained between them. And
they sure didn't want to spend two whole weeks cooped
up together pushing their newly acquired boundaries to
the limit.</p>
<p>Their protests were of course a lost cause. Mike had
merely smiled and told them, with a voice that brooked
no objection, that it was a superb opportunity for
them to once and for all put their differences aside
and really get to know each other. And if all else
failed they could always hit the slopes instead of
each other for once. Jane had wholeheartedly agreed
with him and with that it was settled; they were going
on a family bonding vacation together.</p>
<p>Both teens had groaned in frustration and prayed
they'd get out of this one alive.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The first few days passed without altercations and
both teens were actually starting to fully enjoy the
trip, and surprisingly, each other's company. Not that
either of them would ever admit to that except under
the most severe form of torture, of course. The days
were spent on the slopes skiing and snowboarding until
they could hardly walk and the nights were spent in
front of the fireplace wrapped in warm blankets
drinking hot cocoa and cooing with Mac.</p>
<p>It was quickly shaping up to be one of the best trips
ever.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of their vacation the girls decided
to give their aching bones a break from the slopes and
instead go exploring together in the woods surrounding
the cabin. While Sam was getting the last instructions
from a worried Jane about 'not getting lost' and
'paying attention to where she was at all times', and
'not to stray to far away from the cabin', Brooke
sneaked of and hid behind one of the big trees in the
outskirts of the forest. Carefully gathering enough
snow to form a rather big snowball, she hung back in
giddy anticipation and awaited her unsuspecting
target.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke could her the labored breaths of her pursuer
getting closer as the other girl slowly gained on her.
All of a sudden the blonde cheerleader hooked a quick
right in a desperate attempt of getting away, and it
would probably have worked too if only Sam hadn't
anticipated her move.</p>
<p>The breath was knocked out of her lungs as the smaller
form of the journalist came crashing into her, taking
her to the snow covered ground in a tangle of snow,
arms and legs.</p>
<p>"HA!" Sam chortled triumphantly as she straddled the
out of breath blonde girl, effectively pinning her to
the cold ground. "Couldn't catch a cold, huh?! I'll
show you," the brunette huffed, slightly out of
breath. Grinning wildly she quickly grabbed two
handfuls of snow and started rubbing it into the
squirming cheerleaders face. "Eat snow McQueen!"</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop! I give up already!" A squirming Brooke
managed to get out while trying to avoid having snow
stuffed into her mouth by shielding her face with her
arms.</p>
<p>Sam quickly grabbed hold of the blonde's wrists and
pinned them to the ground beside the cheerleaders'
head. "Oh, you give up do ya?!" the brunette grinned
playfully, their faces mere inches apart. "Well, what
if I don't think you've suffered enough? Ambushing me
like that - and without provocation, no less. And then
insulting my ability to catch colds?! Oh, no princess
- you're not getting away that easily."</p>
<p>"W-what are you going to do to me?" Brooke stuttered
softly, her heart almost beating out of her chest at
the suddenly very close proximity of the other girl.
Without her permission her gaze slowly wandered the
planes Sam's face taking in every little detail from
her glittering brown eyes framed by almost impossibly
long thick lashes, her small delicate nose only inches
away from her own, and the full, luscious-looking ruby
colored lips.</p>
<p>Brooke unconsciously licked her own lips as a surge of
warmth quickly spread from the pit of her stomach
through her body like liquid fire, setting every nerve
ending ablaze.</p>
<p>Sam noticed with surprise how Brooke's gaze slowly
seemed to glaze over, and her pupils dilated, as the
other girl seemed to take her in. Before she could
fully understand what was happening, the blonde
cheerleader's tongue peeked out to wet supple, pink
lips and Sam felt her breathing hitch as her groin
clenched almost painfully.</p>
<p>"I... oh god -," Sam got out in a breathless whisper
before she was helpless to do anything but answer her
body's suddenly desperate demand. Swiftly closing the
distance between them she gently brushed their lips
together as her brown locks came down like a soft
canopy to shield them from potential prying eyes.</p>
<p>The taste and texture of Brooke's supple lips was
truly amazing and Sam had to force herself not to go
back for more once the kiss ended. Instead she leaned
back slightly, attempting to tuck her unruly locks
behind her ear with a trembling hand, as she carefully
tried to gauge the blonde's reaction to this new
development.</p>
<p>The soft touch on her lips was like nothing Brooke had
ever felt before, and it was over much to quickly for
her tastes. Looking up at Sam through half lidded eyes
she wound a hand into Sam's thick, brown locks and
forcefully tugged her back down again.</p>
<p>Sam gasped in surprise before her eyes fluttered
closed and she responded to the soft lips moving
sensuously against her own.</p>
<p>This time the kiss was decidedly firmer as both girls
curiously explored each other. Brooke parted her lips
slightly and sucked on Sam's full lower lip, gently
teasing her tongue over the luscious piece of flesh.
In response Sam moaned softly and her own tongue came
out to join in the game, gently tracing Brooke's
impossibly soft lips. Without hesitation the
cheerleader greedily sucked the probing muscle into
her mouth and whimpered quietly as Sam started to
explore.</p>
<p>The rest of the world faded into nothingness as their
kiss grew with fevered intensity and their tongues
fought for dominance inside the others mouth. Roughly
they crushed their lips together in a frantic attempt
to devour the other, before the desperate need for air
forced them reluctantly apart.</p>
<p>Both girls were breathing heavily as they stared at
each other with something akin to wonder in their
eyes.</p>
<p>"Wow..." Sam breathed, her gaze fixed on Brooke's
slightly swollen lips that seemed to beckon her with
each panting breath that the blonde cheerleader took.</p>
<p>"Yeah... wow," Brooke uttered softly, "I don't know what
just happened here, but can we bottle it?" she joked
weakly. The need to taste Sam's lips again was almost
overwhelming in its intensity and she had to fight the
urge of reversing their positions and ravishing the
brunette completely. "If this is how we're going to
spend our time together from now on I not going to
complain."</p>
<p>Sam giggled softly and a playful smirk emerged on her
slightly puffy lips. "Although I believe that Mike
wanted us to use this vacation to get to know each
other better, I somehow doubt that he had this
scenario in mind."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled ruefully and nodded in agreement to the
brunettes' words. "Probably not," she admitted,
suddenly hit with visuals of Mike and Jane finding
them naked together in bed. She chuckled quietly as
she saw herself trying to explain the odd situation to
the enraged parentals; 'But we were only trying to
preserve our body heat. Honest! It was soo cold in
here, and I didn't want poor Sam to get pneumonia or
something.'</p>
<p>"What's so funny?" Sam wondered curiously as she bent
down and gently rubbed their noses together in a small
eskimo kiss. God, she was powerless to resist this
girl. Brooke was so soft and warm and she smelled so
good. She was like a drug, and Sam was already hooked.</p>
<p>Sighing happily, Brooke wrapped both arms around Sam's
body and pulled her into a crushing hug. "Just
picturing the parental's faces if they ever found
out," she whispered into a delicate ear and couldn't
resist nipping at the earlobe playfully.</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." Sam mumbled, happily nuzzling into the
blonde's neck and trying to pull in as much of her
sweet scent as she could. Then she sighed softly and
lifted her head, gazing down into hazel eyes, a
serious expression on her face. "Mike and mom are not
gonna like this one bit," she said softly, gently
tracing a gloved hand over Brookes' forehead and down
her right cheek, her eyes drinking in the movement
greedily.</p>
<p>"No they won't," Brooke acknowledged quietly. "The
kids back at school won't be too happy either. Nic is
gonna blow a gasket, and I bet Harrison won't exactly
be willing to shower us with well-whishes." Suddenly
it felt like the whole world was against them, and her
eyes welled with tears. Did they even stand a fighting
chance?</p>
<p>"Hey..." Sam gently palmed the cheerleader's cheek while
looking deeply into the tear-filled hazel eyes. She
felt despair seep into her very being and cursed
herself silently. How stupid of her to think that
Brooke might have actually wanted this too. The blonde
really enjoyed her popularity status at school, and
this was nothing less than committing popular suicide
if it ever came out.</p>
<p>"If you... if this is g-going to-to be too much for
you..." she stuttered softly, no longer able to meet
Brooke's eyes. Sam drew in a ragged breath, determined
to give the blonde girl an easy way out if she wanted
it, but gloved fingers covered her lips and prevented
her from speaking.</p>
<p>"I-I love you, Sammy." Brooke confessed shyly,
shifting her fingers slightly and gently began
caressing Sam's cheek. "I think I fell in love with
you a long time ago, I just never... I never realized
that it was love that I felt. But now..." she breathed
as she gazed into Sam's chocolate brown eyes in quiet
wonder. It was going to work. They were going to make
it work and god help those who tried to stand in their
way.</p>
<p>"Now I know, and I'm never letting you go again.
There's no way that this is too much for me, and the
rest of the world can just go f-..."</p>
<p>Her last words were swallowed up in the fierce kiss
bestowed on her lips by the deliriously happy
journalist, leaving her breathless and slightly dizzy.</p>
<p>"I couldn't agree more, princess," Sam whispered
softly when their kiss ended. "I don't know when it
happened but somewhere along the line I fell in love
with you too. I didn't quite understand it at the time
and I guess it was just easier to go on pretending to
hate you. But now things are much clearer. I'm deeply
in love with you and if you'll let me I'll spend the
rest of my life trying to make you happy."</p>
<p>"You already have Sam," Brooke replied resolutely,
unable to resist the urge of lifting up slightly and
brushing their lips together again. She hummed in soft
appreciation before once again focusing back on their
conversation.</p>
<p>"Then it's settled. We simply won't tell anyone about
us... at least not yet," she amended at the look of
surprise gracing Sam's face. "Let's spend some time by
ourselves and see where this thing leads us before we
involve everybody else."</p>
<p>Sam's trademark smirk made an appearance at her last
words. "Want me all to yourself do ya?" she kidded
gently, secretly elated that the blonde felt the same
way as her. She felt like singing.</p>
<p>"Oh you bet I do! This girl is not much for sharing,
now give me some sugar!" Brooke growled out in mock
ferocity as she, in a move that totally caught Sam by
surprise, finally reversed their positions and found
herself delicately sprawled on top of the willowy
journalist.</p>
<p>"Hmmm... I like," she purred softly as she bent down and
stopped mere millimeters from her goal, simply loving
the feel of the other girl beneath her. Their breaths
mingled as she gazed adoringly into soft chocolate
orbs so close to her own, and she felt her heart swell
and her throat constrict painfully with emotion. Just
as she was about to continue with her new most
favorite pastime, kissing Sam senseless, a voice rang
out and echoed through the still forest.</p>
<p>"SAM?! BROOKE?! Dinner time girls!!"</p>
<p>Jane, and she was obviously on her way towards where
they currently lay.</p>
<p>"Rats!" Brooke mumbled as she seriously considered
staying right where she was, kissing Sam until the
world stopped spinning, all consequences be damned!</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it, blondie," Sam stated with
determination while valiantly trying to fight back
laughter at the cute pout now adorning the
cheerleader's scowling face. "We agreed to keep a lid
on things for now, and I doubt that'd be possible if
mom found us in this... uh... compromising position."</p>
<p>"As much as it annoys me to admit it; you're right,"
Brooke conceded grumpily as she reluctantly got to her
feet and helped the brunette to stand. Before Sam had
a chance to react the blonde leaned in and quickly
licked at the brunette's lips, eliciting a soft moan
in response. "To be continued at a later date," she
whispered throatily into the trembling journalists'
ear just as Jane came into view.</p>
<p>"You're soo gonna pay for that one, McQueen!" Sam
hissed under her breath as she felt a blush gradually
creep up her features. Putting on a fake smile she
waved at her mom coming down the slope towards them.
"Down here mom!" She called out unnecessarily.</p>
<p>"Well, considering I really enjoyed what happened the
last time you said that; I can't wait," was Brooke's
nonchalant reply as they both started walking towards
Jane in a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>"Remember McQueen, paybacks are a bitch," Sam
threatened softly so that only Brooke could hear as
she let their gloved hands brush together with gentle
innocence.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. This was definitely shaping up to be the
best trip ever.</p>
