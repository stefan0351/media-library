<!-- Is This Love \ Part 2 -->

<p>Sam was typing away furiously on her laptop when there was a soft knock on her bedroom door. Knowing that it was Brooke, she stubbornly refused to acknowledge the sound and just kept working, hoping that the blonde standing on the other side of the door would take the hint.</p>

<p>She didn't.</p>

<p>The sound of the door carefully being opened alerted Sam of the other girl's unwanted but impending presence and she immediately felt her self-righteous indignation flare. 'Can't a girl be left alone even in her own room?!' Spinning around on her desk-chair, a scowl firmly in place on her face, she was just in time to see Brooke poke her head trough the small opening.</p>

<p>"The lack answer when you knocked should have told you that I'm not available right now," Sam stated coldly, her eyes flashing with anger. "Even a blonde head cheerleader like yourself should have been able to pick up on the hint." Spinning back around without another word, she started typing on her laptop again, fully expecting the blonde to leave.</p>

<p>Brooke sighed softly. This was not going to be easy. 'Then again', she thought to herself with a small smile, 'it's never easy where Samantha McPherson is concerned.'</p>

<p>"Look Sammy," she started softly, trying to find the right words. "I'm really sorry about what Nic said down there. She had no right to..."</p>

<p>"Get out, Brooke! I don't want to hear it." Sam quickly interrupted furiously. If she could only hold on to her anger she didn't run the risk of breaking down in front of her soon to be stepsister. Nicole's hateful words had cut deeper than Sam cared to admit and crying in front of Brooke would only give the blonde more ammo to use against her. But in order to stay mad she couldn't allow Brooke a chance explain herself, and every time the blonde opened her mouth, Sam could feel some of her resolve slipping.</p>

<p>"Sam, please..." Brooke whispered imploringly as she took a few hesitant steps into the room.</p>

<p>'No!' Sam thought with desperation as she could feel her eyes start to sting with unshed tears. She had to get Brooke out of the room now, or all would be lost! Clenching her fists until her knuckles turned white and her nails bit into the palms of her hands, Sam screwed her eyes shut. Taking a deep breath she struck Brooke with everything she could think of.</p>

<p>"Don't call me Sammy. Only people I love are allowed to call me that, and you're not one of them," the brunette stated with deceptive calm. "Besides, don't you have something better to do than to pester me, Brookie? Go throw up, or something."</p>

<p>The soft gasp coming from the cheerleader cut through Sam like a dull knife and she instantly wished that she could somehow retract her vile words, but it was too late.</p>

<p>"You... bitch," Brooke whispered hoarsely, pain lacing her words. "I go out of my way to be nice to you, defending you in favor of my own friends again and again, but it's never enough, is it?! You go from best friend to archenemy in 0.2 seconds and I never know what sets you off. You make it very hard for me to like you," the blonde finished quietly as she turned around and left the room, tears trickling down her cheeks.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Sam let out a sigh and let her head fall to the desk with a sound thump, feeling like the worst dog ever. She hadn't meant to hurt Brooke like that. She'd just wanted the blonde girl to leave her alone...</p>

<p>'Well, she sure left you alone, didn't she?' her inner voice taunted. 'Happy now, you backstabbing bitch?'</p>

<p>Sam heaved another big sigh and ran a trembling hand through her brown locks. No matter how much she'd wanted to be left alone, ripping Brooke apart like that hadn't been fair. She'd gone way too far, and now it was time for some serious groveling.</p>

<p>Standing on slightly shaky legs, the brunette left her room and slowly made her way down the hall, coming to a stop in front of Brooke's closed door. Not even bothering to knock, knowing it to be a futile cause anyway, she tried to open the door directly but found it locked. Leaning her forehead on the cool surface of the wooden door Sam could clearly hear muffled sobs coming from the other side. Closing her eyes she desperately fought her own tears that threatened to fall at the sound.</p>

<p>She needed to get into Brooke's room and apologize. 'But how?' The girl would never open the door and let Sam in willingly after that last stunt. Suddenly her head came up sharply. Maybe Brooke had forgotten to lock the door to the bathroom!</p>

<p>Almost breaking into a dead run Sam soon found herself standing in their joint bathroom facing the door leading into Brookes room. Reaching out a trembling hand she gently closed it around the handle and turned. The door opened with a soft click and Sam felt almost dizzy with the relief flowing through her veins. Carefully, trying to be as quiet as possible, Sam slid the door open and slipped into Brooke's domain.</p>
