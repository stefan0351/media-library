<!-- Teaparty in Wonderland \ Part 1 -->

<p>"I don't believe this." muttered Sam as her eyes casually swept across the form who walked right across her without even acknowledging her presence. "Ow."</p>

<p>"Sorry!" Brooke snapped her head to see the person whose toes her stiletto heel has mercilessly crushed. "Sam ." she whispered, looking at the brunette who was furiously blowing across her toes trying to soothe them, then giggled.</p>
<p>Sam quirked an eyebrow when she heard Brooke's amused expression, pouted and proceeded to knead her toes lovingly. "So much for being sorry," she thought ruefully,</p>

<p>Brooke took the seat next to Sam. She nudged Sam's shoulder to get her attention only to be ignored by Sam who was pretending to be totally engrossed in mending her deformed feet.</p>

<p>Ms Glass burst through the door and simply proceeded to give out handouts to all the students who were present. When everyone has received a copy she turned to face the stunned adolescents who looked quickly between her and the nearest means of escape.</p>

<p>"Oh don't worry you short farts. This won't take long. The handouts consist of the details of the assignment. I've scheduled another meeting one week from today. Alright now you can all get out of here you filthy libidinal little people." The next moment she disappeared into the corridor.</p>

<p>Everyone else scurried after her. Eager to leave school and officially start celebrating the advent of a highly exalted occasion called . The Weekend. Harrison has gone off with Carmen to help Lily with yet another one of her "Save the (fill in the blanks with the appropriate mammal)!" campaign.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry has gone too hurrying after Nicole who practically flew out of the door after she received a call on her mobile that Donna Karan has just came out with the latest fashion this season.</p>

<p>Sam was still looking at her handout, flipping through the pages with the familiar frown atop her forehead. Brooke saw that she was concentrating and decided not to interrupt her just yet. Finally Sam looked up and looked at Brooke coolly in the eye.</p>

<p>Brooke extended her hand, "Hi. My name is Brooke. Brooke McQueen and I'm sorry I stepped on your toes," she half smiled and half-grinned at Sam.</p>

<p>"McPherson, Sam McPherson. I'm just glad they are still here with me." Sam looked down at her feet and smiled back genuinely.</p>

<p>They took a moment studying each other before they burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"I can't believe she erm he's making us do this," Sam grinned. "Hey, wait a minute, are you sure you wanna do this with me?"</p>
<p>Brooke nodded and pointed to her a section of the handout, "See it says here . Pick someone close to you."</p>
<p>"They don't mean physically, you know." Sam began and indicated their seating arrangements.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly it will be fun. Perhaps after this you'd learn to be less vicious after some of my good manners and overwhelming charm rubs a little of you." Brooke interrupted, narrowing her eyes as she looked up from the handouts to look at Sam.</p>

<p>"Hey I'll have you know Mom brought me well you stinky brat ." Sam interjected getting the familiar burning sensation she always gets in her tummy when a fight is about to start between herself and Brooke.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah right! You little." Brooke stopped herself before anything unfortunate happens. She took a deep breath and said, "Alright. I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. Let's do this right ok? I actually believe this is going to turn out great for us. And who knows we might just learn something from this journey."</p>

<p>Sam just stared at her. Brooke raised her eyebrow and the two of them burst out laughing again. "Whoa Brooke . too much Deepak Chopra for you!" Sam giggled and nudged Brooke playfully.</p>
<p>"Come on Sam . Listen, this is gonna sound Soooo mushy but I really don't wanna fight anymore.this is the last year we'd ever be in the same school for goodness sake. Before we know it, you'd be some hot shot reporter who's too busy to meet her family even during the holidays and probably get some secretary to send birthday cards and Christmas cards and then you won't even remember what little Mac looks like and me . you'll just ."</p>

<p>"I'll just what?" Sam asked amused by this little outburst.</p>

<p>"You'll just shake my hand limply and look at me like I'm some estranged acquaintance you meet on the street." Brooke pouted looking dazedly at nowhere as though she could really visualise what she was saying.</p>
<p>Sam laughed at the blonde wondering where she amassed all those ridiculous thoughts. She shook Brooke gently, "I will never be too busy for my family, and there is no way I will forget about Mac . but you know . still I won't shake your hand when we finally meet even after many years apart. Hmmm ...I think I'll just wave . no way am I getting my hot-shot reporter hands dirty touching a filthy hand like yours."</p>

<p>Brooke gasped and pinched the laughing brunette on her arm. "What was that Sam?"</p>
<p>Sam squirmed, hating to be pinched, "Let go Brooke." She whined piteously.</p>
<p>Brooke let go and the two of them eyed each other suspiciously. Before Sam could react Brooke practically pounced on her tickling her silly. They chased each other around the room. Sam was laughing so hard she was crying. Finally, they got tired and slid to sit on the floor by the wall of the room.</p>
<p>"You know I will," Sam grinned breaking the silence as she reached for Brooke's hand, and shook hands with her.</p>

<p>"You'd better. I'll have you know there are hordes of fans out there just dying to touch these hands." She snickered and lifted her hands and looked at them admiringly.</p>

<p>Sam cocked her head facing Brooke. "Oh REeeaaally, well In guess if you're still as pretty I might even decide to hug you," she teased.</p>

<p>Brooke seem to think for a moment before she started, "Well then I'll just have to."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Sam, "What?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Brooke stood up and walked towards the door. She turned to face Sam and grinned, "I'll just have to give you a big sloppy wet kiss on the mouth. See ya later, flycatcher," She laughed seeing Sam's stunned expression and gaping mouth.</p>

<p>Sam realised Brooke was teasing her and was about to say something smart but she was too late. Brooke has already disappeared into the corridor. She smiled to herself thinking, "Brooke is one REALLY weird girl."</p>
