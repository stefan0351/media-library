<chapter title="Part 1">
<p>"I don't believe this." muttered Sam as her eyes casually swept across the form who walked right across her without even acknowledging her presence. "Ow."</p>

<p>"Sorry!" Brooke snapped her head to see the person whose toes her stiletto heel has mercilessly crushed. "Sam ." she whispered, looking at the brunette who was furiously blowing across her toes trying to soothe them, then giggled.</p>
<p>Sam quirked an eyebrow when she heard Brooke's amused expression, pouted and proceeded to knead her toes lovingly. "So much for being sorry," she thought ruefully,</p>

<p>Brooke took the seat next to Sam. She nudged Sam's shoulder to get her attention only to be ignored by Sam who was pretending to be totally engrossed in mending her deformed feet.</p>

<p>Ms Glass burst through the door and simply proceeded to give out handouts to all the students who were present. When everyone has received a copy she turned to face the stunned adolescents who looked quickly between her and the nearest means of escape.</p>

<p>"Oh don't worry you short farts. This won't take long. The handouts consist of the details of the assignment. I've scheduled another meeting one week from today. Alright now you can all get out of here you filthy libidinal little people." The next moment she disappeared into the corridor.</p>

<p>Everyone else scurried after her. Eager to leave school and officially start celebrating the advent of a highly exalted occasion called . The Weekend. Harrison has gone off with Carmen to help Lily with yet another one of her "Save the (fill in the blanks with the appropriate mammal)!" campaign.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry has gone too hurrying after Nicole who practically flew out of the door after she received a call on her mobile that Donna Karan has just came out with the latest fashion this season.</p>

<p>Sam was still looking at her handout, flipping through the pages with the familiar frown atop her forehead. Brooke saw that she was concentrating and decided not to interrupt her just yet. Finally Sam looked up and looked at Brooke coolly in the eye.</p>

<p>Brooke extended her hand, "Hi. My name is Brooke. Brooke McQueen and I'm sorry I stepped on your toes," she half smiled and half-grinned at Sam.</p>

<p>"McPherson, Sam McPherson. I'm just glad they are still here with me." Sam looked down at her feet and smiled back genuinely.</p>

<p>They took a moment studying each other before they burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"I can't believe she erm he's making us do this," Sam grinned. "Hey, wait a minute, are you sure you wanna do this with me?"</p>
<p>Brooke nodded and pointed to her a section of the handout, "See it says here . Pick someone close to you."</p>
<p>"They don't mean physically, you know." Sam began and indicated their seating arrangements.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly it will be fun. Perhaps after this you'd learn to be less vicious after some of my good manners and overwhelming charm rubs a little of you." Brooke interrupted, narrowing her eyes as she looked up from the handouts to look at Sam.</p>

<p>"Hey I'll have you know Mom brought me well you stinky brat ." Sam interjected getting the familiar burning sensation she always gets in her tummy when a fight is about to start between herself and Brooke.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah right! You little." Brooke stopped herself before anything unfortunate happens. She took a deep breath and said, "Alright. I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. Let's do this right ok? I actually believe this is going to turn out great for us. And who knows we might just learn something from this journey."</p>

<p>Sam just stared at her. Brooke raised her eyebrow and the two of them burst out laughing again. "Whoa Brooke . too much Deepak Chopra for you!" Sam giggled and nudged Brooke playfully.</p>
<p>"Come on Sam . Listen, this is gonna sound Soooo mushy but I really don't wanna fight anymore.this is the last year we'd ever be in the same school for goodness sake. Before we know it, you'd be some hot shot reporter who's too busy to meet her family even during the holidays and probably get some secretary to send birthday cards and Christmas cards and then you won't even remember what little Mac looks like and me . you'll just ."</p>

<p>"I'll just what?" Sam asked amused by this little outburst.</p>

<p>"You'll just shake my hand limply and look at me like I'm some estranged acquaintance you meet on the street." Brooke pouted looking dazedly at nowhere as though she could really visualise what she was saying.</p>
<p>Sam laughed at the blonde wondering where she amassed all those ridiculous thoughts. She shook Brooke gently, "I will never be too busy for my family, and there is no way I will forget about Mac . but you know . still I won't shake your hand when we finally meet even after many years apart. Hmmm ...I think I'll just wave . no way am I getting my hot-shot reporter hands dirty touching a filthy hand like yours."</p>

<p>Brooke gasped and pinched the laughing brunette on her arm. "What was that Sam?"</p>
<p>Sam squirmed, hating to be pinched, "Let go Brooke." She whined piteously.</p>
<p>Brooke let go and the two of them eyed each other suspiciously. Before Sam could react Brooke practically pounced on her tickling her silly. They chased each other around the room. Sam was laughing so hard she was crying. Finally, they got tired and slid to sit on the floor by the wall of the room.</p>
<p>"You know I will," Sam grinned breaking the silence as she reached for Brooke's hand, and shook hands with her.</p>

<p>"You'd better. I'll have you know there are hordes of fans out there just dying to touch these hands." She snickered and lifted her hands and looked at them admiringly.</p>

<p>Sam cocked her head facing Brooke. "Oh REeeaaally, well In guess if you're still as pretty I might even decide to hug you," she teased.</p>

<p>Brooke seem to think for a moment before she started, "Well then I'll just have to."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Sam, "What?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Brooke stood up and walked towards the door. She turned to face Sam and grinned, "I'll just have to give you a big sloppy wet kiss on the mouth. See ya later, flycatcher," She laughed seeing Sam's stunned expression and gaping mouth.</p>

<p>Sam realised Brooke was teasing her and was about to say something smart but she was too late. Brooke has already disappeared into the corridor. She smiled to herself thinking, "Brooke is one REALLY weird girl."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 2">
<p>Brooke was still smiling as she exited the room, relishing the moment she head-cheerleader has stumped the chief editor of the school paper. She smirked at the thought and headed towards the Novak.</p>

<p>"You're still here?" Brooke asked an irritated Nicole who was glaring at the mirror as if challenging the reflection to a duel.</p>

<p>"I told her not to touch desserts but no . " she pointed to a door. Brooke frowned wondering what Nicole meant. A loud flatulence engulfed the Novak and Brooke shook her head getting what Nicole meant as the pungent smell made her remember the cafeteria was serving red bean ice-cream for desserts.</p>

<p>Brooke quickly opened the door of the Novak so that no one suffocates. "Cheerleaders exodus: Red bean scream by Sam MacPherson" Brooke laughed quietly at the thought of Sam covering such a story.</p>

<p>Finally with the sound of a flush out came a wobbling Mary Cherry. "Oh mah gawd. That was some ."</p>

<p>"Don't even say it MC . Are you ready to go?" Nicole started towards the door without even waiting for a reply. She flashed Brooke a smile, "I'll make sure I save a couple of pieces for you, hon." She winked. Brooke mouthed her Thanks.</p>

<p>"Bye-uh Brooke," Mary Cherry hurried to catch up with Nicole.</p>

<p>Peace. Finally. She thought as she collapsed onto the sofa closing her eyes for what seemed like a moment. When she came to, she felt a presence in the room. She opened her left eye warily and was relieved to see that it was Sam who was changing out of her blouse and into a white t-shirt. When Sam turned around, Brooke pretended to start waking up.</p>

<p>"Hey, had a quickie with the sandman eh?" Sam grinned mischievously.</p>

<p>Brooke arched an eyebrow and looked at her watch. She had been sleeping for almost an hour. "What are you still doing here Sam?"</p>
<p>"Paper. I just finished my article.  So how come you're not off with the rest to that sale thingy?"</p>
<p>"I erm . I wanted to head for the cheerleader clubhouse for a meeting"</p>
<p>"Oh . you guys have a clubhouse?" Sam asked surprised that there was such a thing.</p>

<p>"Yes it's not exclusively ours, it's for all the cheerleading teams in this area. We meet once a while to update each other on the latest etc." Brooke explained.</p>

<p>"Wow . "</p>

<p>"Wow? Not what a waste of space for air-heads? Or how about how many people did we have to flash ourselves to get funding for ."</p>

<p>"Brooke. I said  `Wow' I meant `Wow' that's all ok." Sam snapped, rolled her eyes and started to head for the door.</p>

<p>"Sam . I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me," she caught Sam's arm as she walked passed her.</p>
<p>Sam sighed. "Practice"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Practice. We're too used to coming up with smart repartees in half a minute to be able to say something nice without sounding suspiciously scheming." She quirked an eyebrow at Brooke who nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"So do you need an extra arm or can I have mine back?" Sam grinned. Brooke swatted her arm gently, "Yes I need it to carry all the textbooks I need for this weekend's homework to the car."</p>
<p>She pulled a groaning Sam towards her locker.</p>

<p>"How about the library, Brooke? Have you checked if there are more?" Sam grunted as she struggled to keep the strap of her bag on her shoulder while carrying the stack of books in her arms. Brooke looked over at Sam and laughed.</p>
<p>She took a few more books of Sam's load and put them on top of her pile. Sam watched in awe as the seemingly dainty-looking cheerleader, who'd probably sob in pain should she break a nail, carry her pile of books which was much heavier than hers.</p>

<p>They walked to Brooke's car where Sam gladly threw the pile into the backseat. "Where are you heading Sam? I'll give you a lift." She opened the door and gently nudged Sam into her car. Sam got in and thought quickly about her destination. She had really intended to go home but she also wanted to spend a little more time with Brooke.</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The café around the corner . about 5 minute drive from here. But it's ok if it's out of your way, you know ."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, that's not far at all. Besides it's not like I'm carrying you, "She laughed, "I'm driving remember."</p>

<p>"Yeah well I was just worried all the turns might get too complicated for you." Sam teased.</p>

<p>"Miss MacPherson, you're absolutely incorrigible," Brooke retorted in mock anger. "Take that!" She said as she threw a ball of tissue at Sam.</p>

<p>Sam caught it just before it hits her face. "Hahaha . quick hands, Princess, but I've got quicker reflex."</p>

<p>"Not quick enough though . "She turned to nod at the ball of tissue" .</p>
<p>to realise that that's used tissue I used to blow my nose this morning when I sent us to school remember?" Brooke threw her head back in laughter not able to contain seeing the stunned look on Sam's face.</p>

<p>"Ewww . Brooke. You're sick." Sam laughed throwing the offensive item back at Brooke where it landed in her lap. </p>
<p>"Nope, I'm pretty remember? You said so in the lab." She smiled haughtily.</p>

<p>". My my . modest aren't we?" Sam grinned.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled, "Well we're here. Why are you here again?"</p>
<p>Sam froze for a moment (Think Think Think!) "Oh I er . I'm . source."</p>

<p>"Coherent speech would truly help my understanding," Brooke snickered.</p>

<p>"I'm here to meet a source for an article," Sam said firmly.</p>

<p>"Ooh. The hotshot school reporter in action. Can I watch?"</p>

<p>"No!" Sam said a tad bit too forcefully.</p>

<p>Brooke eyed Sam suspiciously, "Ok Spill it MacPherson. Who are you meeting? Is this suppose to be some hot date I don't know about? He's not from around here is he?"</p>

<p>"Jeez, Brooke. No . it's just that . I mean don't you have some meeting to go to?"</p>
<p>"Not till 4. It's only 2 plus now," Brooke smiled wickedly "I can wait with you, I mean if it's really not some hot date that I'm interrupting ."</p>

<p>Sam figured that since her make-believe source is never going to show up, she didn't see the harm in letting Brooke wait. After all she had a strong feeling she'd get tired in no time and leave.</p>

<p>Brooke chose a seat near the window overlooking the street so that Sam can see if her source has arrived. Sam took to studying her menu before Brooke gently knocked against Sam's causing her to blurt out "Fish and chips and coke, please."</p>

<p>Brooke grinned. "Sam . really now. Is this a blind date?"</p>

<p>"No!" Sam practically leapt out of the chair.</p>

<p>"Ok ok, calm down I was just teasing you Sammy. Come on, sit down please ." Brooke held Sam by her wrist and gently pulled her back down to her seat.</p>

<p>Sam felt Brooke's hand burning into her wrist. It was burning but not necessarily painful. Well not exactly . you know what it's like to have ice directly applied to skin? It's a tad bit painful, prickly even but as it melts, it feels all tingly and fabulous . the aftermath so to speak. Well this was pretty much that.</p>

<p>Sam took a deep breath. She knew the lying was making her uncomfortable and jittery. She thought perhaps she should just admit to Brooke that she lied and that her source was not coming when she realised that this was a good opportunity to get to know Brooke.</p>

<p>I mean how often did they get to sit in a café and have a decent conversation . or at least attempt to have a civil one that does not include ripping the other's jugular vein off her neck. She smiled a small smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was just nervous. I've never had someone accompany me on a case before," Sam explained. "Let's eat, ok?"</p>

<p>Brooke was taken aback by Sam's metamorphic change in moods but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless. "OK . I'll just have the Quiche Lorraine and ice-tea."</p>

<p>Sam nodded at the waitress who came and took their order. When she left, there was deafening silence between them.</p>

<p>"So ."     </p>
<p>"So ."</p>

<p>"What's with the book McQueen? Is there some test or quiz I don't know remember?"</p>
<p>"Nope, I just wanted to finish off my assignments earlier," Brooke shrugged.</p>

<p>"You're a patchwork of paradoxes you know ." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"Wow . patchwork of paradoxes? I like that."</p>

<p>"So Miss Head-Cheerleader, aside from being a closet nerd, what else turns you on?" Sam wiggled her eyebrows mischievously.</p>

<p>"Hmmm . fresh white embroidered bedsheets, Audrey Hepburn's black dress and lots and lots of ."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>"Wild flowers actually." Brooke laughed. Sam joined her laughter. "And yours?"</p>

<p>"A good book ."</p>

<p>"You don't say ." Brooke teased.</p>
<p>"Hey no interrupting!" Sam gently flicked her fingers at Brooke's knuckles to which Brooke pretended to be severely hurt and rubbed them lovingly. "As I was saying . a good book, freshly brewed coffee and ."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>Sam laughed, "Buildings actually."</p>

<p>"Building? Really? Why?" Brooke asked leaning forward towards her company.</p>

<p>"Well I don't know I've always had this passion for buildings, skyscrapers, country homes, contemporary houses . it's silly really," Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"No, come one share some more . why ."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a waiter who was sending them their food. Sam could see that he was checking Brooke out of the corner of his eyes even as he served them their food. She rolled her eyes. Brooke, on the other hand, was uncomfortable with the way the waiter was looking at her.</p>
<p>"Alone at last" Brooke breathed out.</p>
<p>Sam smiled hearing the comment but decided not to tease her. They were getting along well so far. They ate in companionable silence before Sam spoke, "Brooke, I know this is weird but when school is over, you know what I'm going to miss most?"</p>

<p>"Me?" Brooke grinned and batted her eyelids.</p>

<p>"Erm . close. Actually fighting with you ."</p>

<p>"No!" Brooke gasped in mock horror.</p>

<p>Sam smiled and continued, "Really, you're one of the few people I enjoy arguing with. I mean you put up a good fight. Associating with you has been exhausting and intellectually draining."</p>

<p>"Why MacPherson . Are you throwing me a compliment?" Brooke teased. "Why don't you just admit it? Say that I'm fabulous company ."</p>
<p>"If I do, does that mean I'd get another big sloppy wet kiss on the mouth?" Sam arched her eyebrows mischievously.</p>

<p>Brooke blushed recalling herself say the exact same words back in the lab but she wasn't going to let Sam get away with this. "Only if you behave ..."</p>

<p>"Oh." This is so weird they both thought.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 3">
<p>There was silence . but this time it didn't feel so awkward. After Sam's last remark, Brooke decided that she should quit this tease and try to continue the decent conversation they were having. "Hey, you must think being a cheerleader equates to having a minuscule amount of grey matter but I'd like to prove otherwise."</p>
<p>Sam just opened her mouth but couldn't quite figure out what to say.</p>
<p>"You know one of your turn-ons . buildings." Brooke offered, smiling gently.</p>
<p>"Oh. Well I just like to look at buildings. Especially skyscrapers . "she started slowly. "I don't understand why either . I just find them fascinating. I would love to pick up photography . as in serious photography . when I can afford a real camera." She smiled shyly.</p>
<p>"You make it sound like you could love it as much as being a reporter ." Brooke touched her hand lightly.</p>
<p>Sam took a deep breath, "Well, probably just nothing. You know like a phase, I'll probably get over it and move on to something else like . knitting or something." She grinned, "What about you . what's with embroidered bedsheets?"</p>
<p>"Well, actually I used to love embroidering . I never actually did it but . I watched my mom do it. I've always thought it was . I don't know . contentment. She always looked so serene and . well it was about the only times I saw her not bickering with dad the last couple of months before she you know ." she looked away from Sam's gaze.</p>
<p>Sam didn't know what to do or say except to upturn her hand to gently squeeze the hand that landed on her own just moments ago. Brooke's gaze did not waver from the window looking out of the street but she did not remove her hand from Sam's either.</p>
<p>They stayed in silence as the jukebox played Jewel singing, " . There is this hunger. This restlessness inside of me. And it knows you're no stranger. You're my gravity. My hands will adore you through all darkness aim. They will lay you out in moonlight. And reinvent your name. For I am wanting you. And I am needing you here. I need you near. Inside the absence of fear ."</p>
<p>When the song ended, Brooke finally turned to face Sam who quirked her eyebrow and gave her a sheepish smile. Brooke couldn't help but broke into a grin. "I'm ok," she mouthed to Sam, who gave her hand a reassuring squeeze before letting go.</p>
<p>Brooke motioned for a waiter who came with the bill. "Come on, let's go home, huh?" she asked after they made the payment.</p>
<p>Sam froze for a moment. "But don't you have a meeting to go to?"</p>
<p>Brooke kept silent for a while before she broke into a suggestive smile, "If you can accidentally forget about your source, I think I can manage to accidentally forget about the meeting."</p>
<p>Sam laughed, "What source?" as she pulled Brooke out of her seat.</p>
<p>By the time they got to the car, Brooke was back to being her perky cheerleader self, and Sam became . Sam. Witty, opinionated yet, subtly charming. They were getting along so well when Mariah Carey came on the radio and Brooke immediately switched stations. Sam couldn't help herself and turned the dial back to Mariah Carey belting out "You'll always be my baby."</p>
<p>"Sam! For goodness sake, please tell me you're tuning to her just to irritate the hell out of me. Who listens to this?" Brooke huffed.</p>
<p>"Brooke ." Sam slowly said and Brooke turned to face her, "Shut up."</p>
<p>Brooke couldn't believe what she just heard and brought the car to a screeching halt. She was about to burst into a bout of expletives when Sam merely lifted her left hand indicating Brooke to wait before she reacted.</p>
<p>Then she pointed to her ear asking Brooke to listen. Brooke heavily leant back into her seat with lips pouted to show her disapproval . but she listened anyway.</p>
<p>When the song ended, Sam opened her eyes and faced Brooke who turned mimicked her actions. She raised her eyebrows as if asking, "What do you think?"</p>
<p>When Brooke did not reply, Sam sighed. "This song is like you. No wait, let me explain ." Sam quickly said when Brooke appeared like she was about to interrupt.</p>
<p>"See anyone who listens to it without much thought will think it's a happy song right? I mean with the upbeat tune, title and all ." Brooke only nodded in response.</p>
<p>"That's like you. You know a patchwork of paradoxes. Like this song, you're perky and bubbly and Miss Have-It-All but deep down . there's a lot of sadness, so many things that you wish you can change but . you really are just like . me."</p>
<p>Brooke was stunned. Of all the things she thought Sam would say or could say . she never expected something like that. They sat facing each other both not knowing exactly where to look so Brooke chose to study the thumb ring Sam was wearing and Sam suddenly found Brooke's steering wheel a rather interesting shade of burgundy.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a honk. They both looked back and saw that it was Nicole in her evidently new black DKNY sunglasses. Both Brooke and Nicole got out of their cars and for the next 15 minutes or so, Sam saw Brooke morphed from being that girl with simple taste for embroidery and wild flowers to the Miss-Popular she was more used to seeing. Nicole seemed to have emptied all her bags and explaining to Brooke the intricacies of each fabric . she was obviously happy to get the approving nods from Brooke who picked at the clothes and studied the labels seriously.</p>
<p>Finally, they both nodded to each other and said their goodbyes. When Brooke got into the car, she smiled apologetically at Sam who just shrugged. They spent the rest of the drive home in silence. As Brooke parked her car in the driveway, Sam couldn't help but observe Brooke's facial features.</p>
<p>She noticed the slight frown atop Brooke's forehead as she concentrated on getting her car perfectly parallel, the way she bit the corner of her lips as though nervous she could be even slightly off tangent at parking. She laughed a small laugh wondering how someone who looked so confident can be so afraid of being so out of control, even over the littlest details in life like parking her car in the driveway.</p>
<p>Brooke raised her eyebrows when she heard the small laugh emitted by the girl sitting next to her. "Gosh Brooke, you looked like the fates of the world rested on your shoulders as you detonate an atomic bomb or something!" Sam allowed herself to laugh freely.</p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes, smiling at Sam's reaction. She knew she looked serious. That was just the way she was. Serious. She thought it was weird at that moment because ordinarily she would have bitten Sam's head off if she teased her like that but somehow seeing her and having spent that little bit more time with her she just felt like joining in, so she pinched her thigh playfully and a bit more forcefully when she did not get the reaction she wanted.</p>
<p>"Oww . Alright. Alright. Alright! Brooke . it hurts ." Sam sniffed piteously.</p>
<p>Brooke was going to stop when she decided that she was going to exploit the moment. "No . not unless you do what I want ."</p>
<p>Sam tried to push Brooke's hands away from her abused thigh, finally relenting, "Ok,ok . what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Just say yes"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>Brooke let go and smiled sweetly. She kissed the palm of her hand before she placed it on the thigh she just abused and pat it affectionately. Then she got out of the car leaving a stunned Sam watch her open the front door of their house.</p>
<p>"Are you coming in or are you such a baby you need me to carry you in?" Brooke laughed as Sam slowly made her way out of the car and walked excruciatingly slowly to towards Brooke who was holding the door for her. Sam made a face and Brooke swatted her shoulders gently as Sam walked pass.</p>
<p>Brooke closed the door behind them and Sam turned around and asked, "So what was it that I am enslaved to do?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled wickedly. "Oh you'll find out when the time is right."</p>
<p>Sam collapsed onto the sofa resigned to fate. Brooke laughed at her dramatic reaction and headed up to her room. "See ya at dinner, Sam . if you can walk your way up these flight of steps!" She called out laughing.</p>
