<!-- Teaparty in Wonderland \ Part 3 -->

<p>There was silence . but this time it didn't feel so awkward. After Sam's last remark, Brooke decided that she should quit this tease and try to continue the decent conversation they were having. "Hey, you must think being a cheerleader equates to having a minuscule amount of grey matter but I'd like to prove otherwise."</p>
<p>Sam just opened her mouth but couldn't quite figure out what to say.</p>
<p>"You know one of your turn-ons . buildings." Brooke offered, smiling gently.</p>
<p>"Oh. Well I just like to look at buildings. Especially skyscrapers . "she started slowly. "I don't understand why either . I just find them fascinating. I would love to pick up photography . as in serious photography . when I can afford a real camera." She smiled shyly.</p>
<p>"You make it sound like you could love it as much as being a reporter ." Brooke touched her hand lightly.</p>
<p>Sam took a deep breath, "Well, probably just nothing. You know like a phase, I'll probably get over it and move on to something else like . knitting or something." She grinned, "What about you . what's with embroidered bedsheets?"</p>
<p>"Well, actually I used to love embroidering . I never actually did it but . I watched my mom do it. I've always thought it was . I don't know . contentment. She always looked so serene and . well it was about the only times I saw her not bickering with dad the last couple of months before she you know ." she looked away from Sam's gaze.</p>
<p>Sam didn't know what to do or say except to upturn her hand to gently squeeze the hand that landed on her own just moments ago. Brooke's gaze did not waver from the window looking out of the street but she did not remove her hand from Sam's either.</p>
<p>They stayed in silence as the jukebox played Jewel singing, " . There is this hunger. This restlessness inside of me. And it knows you're no stranger. You're my gravity. My hands will adore you through all darkness aim. They will lay you out in moonlight. And reinvent your name. For I am wanting you. And I am needing you here. I need you near. Inside the absence of fear ."</p>
<p>When the song ended, Brooke finally turned to face Sam who quirked her eyebrow and gave her a sheepish smile. Brooke couldn't help but broke into a grin. "I'm ok," she mouthed to Sam, who gave her hand a reassuring squeeze before letting go.</p>
<p>Brooke motioned for a waiter who came with the bill. "Come on, let's go home, huh?" she asked after they made the payment.</p>
<p>Sam froze for a moment. "But don't you have a meeting to go to?"</p>
<p>Brooke kept silent for a while before she broke into a suggestive smile, "If you can accidentally forget about your source, I think I can manage to accidentally forget about the meeting."</p>
<p>Sam laughed, "What source?" as she pulled Brooke out of her seat.</p>
<p>By the time they got to the car, Brooke was back to being her perky cheerleader self, and Sam became . Sam. Witty, opinionated yet, subtly charming. They were getting along so well when Mariah Carey came on the radio and Brooke immediately switched stations. Sam couldn't help herself and turned the dial back to Mariah Carey belting out "You'll always be my baby."</p>
<p>"Sam! For goodness sake, please tell me you're tuning to her just to irritate the hell out of me. Who listens to this?" Brooke huffed.</p>
<p>"Brooke ." Sam slowly said and Brooke turned to face her, "Shut up."</p>
<p>Brooke couldn't believe what she just heard and brought the car to a screeching halt. She was about to burst into a bout of expletives when Sam merely lifted her left hand indicating Brooke to wait before she reacted.</p>
<p>Then she pointed to her ear asking Brooke to listen. Brooke heavily leant back into her seat with lips pouted to show her disapproval . but she listened anyway.</p>
<p>When the song ended, Sam opened her eyes and faced Brooke who turned mimicked her actions. She raised her eyebrows as if asking, "What do you think?"</p>
<p>When Brooke did not reply, Sam sighed. "This song is like you. No wait, let me explain ." Sam quickly said when Brooke appeared like she was about to interrupt.</p>
<p>"See anyone who listens to it without much thought will think it's a happy song right? I mean with the upbeat tune, title and all ." Brooke only nodded in response.</p>
<p>"That's like you. You know a patchwork of paradoxes. Like this song, you're perky and bubbly and Miss Have-It-All but deep down . there's a lot of sadness, so many things that you wish you can change but . you really are just like . me."</p>
<p>Brooke was stunned. Of all the things she thought Sam would say or could say . she never expected something like that. They sat facing each other both not knowing exactly where to look so Brooke chose to study the thumb ring Sam was wearing and Sam suddenly found Brooke's steering wheel a rather interesting shade of burgundy.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a honk. They both looked back and saw that it was Nicole in her evidently new black DKNY sunglasses. Both Brooke and Nicole got out of their cars and for the next 15 minutes or so, Sam saw Brooke morphed from being that girl with simple taste for embroidery and wild flowers to the Miss-Popular she was more used to seeing. Nicole seemed to have emptied all her bags and explaining to Brooke the intricacies of each fabric . she was obviously happy to get the approving nods from Brooke who picked at the clothes and studied the labels seriously.</p>
<p>Finally, they both nodded to each other and said their goodbyes. When Brooke got into the car, she smiled apologetically at Sam who just shrugged. They spent the rest of the drive home in silence. As Brooke parked her car in the driveway, Sam couldn't help but observe Brooke's facial features.</p>
<p>She noticed the slight frown atop Brooke's forehead as she concentrated on getting her car perfectly parallel, the way she bit the corner of her lips as though nervous she could be even slightly off tangent at parking. She laughed a small laugh wondering how someone who looked so confident can be so afraid of being so out of control, even over the littlest details in life like parking her car in the driveway.</p>
<p>Brooke raised her eyebrows when she heard the small laugh emitted by the girl sitting next to her. "Gosh Brooke, you looked like the fates of the world rested on your shoulders as you detonate an atomic bomb or something!" Sam allowed herself to laugh freely.</p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes, smiling at Sam's reaction. She knew she looked serious. That was just the way she was. Serious. She thought it was weird at that moment because ordinarily she would have bitten Sam's head off if she teased her like that but somehow seeing her and having spent that little bit more time with her she just felt like joining in, so she pinched her thigh playfully and a bit more forcefully when she did not get the reaction she wanted.</p>
<p>"Oww . Alright. Alright. Alright! Brooke . it hurts ." Sam sniffed piteously.</p>
<p>Brooke was going to stop when she decided that she was going to exploit the moment. "No . not unless you do what I want ."</p>
<p>Sam tried to push Brooke's hands away from her abused thigh, finally relenting, "Ok,ok . what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Just say yes"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>Brooke let go and smiled sweetly. She kissed the palm of her hand before she placed it on the thigh she just abused and pat it affectionately. Then she got out of the car leaving a stunned Sam watch her open the front door of their house.</p>
<p>"Are you coming in or are you such a baby you need me to carry you in?" Brooke laughed as Sam slowly made her way out of the car and walked excruciatingly slowly to towards Brooke who was holding the door for her. Sam made a face and Brooke swatted her shoulders gently as Sam walked pass.</p>
<p>Brooke closed the door behind them and Sam turned around and asked, "So what was it that I am enslaved to do?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled wickedly. "Oh you'll find out when the time is right."</p>
<p>Sam collapsed onto the sofa resigned to fate. Brooke laughed at her dramatic reaction and headed up to her room. "See ya at dinner, Sam . if you can walk your way up these flight of steps!" She called out laughing.</p>
