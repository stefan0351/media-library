<P>After loading her uniform into the replicator, or in the case of her bra loading in it's tatters she turned and found Seven appraising her body with a blatantly hungry look. "No you don't. We need to get cleaned up and then go see the captain. Now get undressed." As Seven complied B'Elanna found herself reconsidering as Seven discarded her biosuit. A forced deep breath allowed her not to pounce on the silken flesh now entirely exposed to her. An action Seven seemed to notice as she smirked. B'Elanna turned and took her now clean uniform from the replicator and set it aside while taking Seven's biosuit and loading it in. Turning back she smirked at a similar expression on Seven's face.</P>
<P>Taking Seven's hands on her own she pulled them towards the shower. Guiding Seven in ahead of her she set the controls and stepped in. As the sonic waves stared to pulse over them she felt Seven's hands begin to lightly caress her. "Seven?" The one time drone's voice was tinged with amusement. "I just wish to touch you." She reached out and caressed Seven's cheek. "Please do." While the sonic waves cleaned the remnants of the women's passion from their bodies they shared soft kisses and gentle caresses. When the waves ended they almost seemed regretful as they stepped from the shower. Naked, they both padded to back to the main area of the quarters and got dressed once more, though they were sure to help each other with fastenings.</P>
<P>B'Elanna smirked. "See? My bra is not that complex to figure out." Seven arched her brow on a face that appeared back to normal except for the circular bandage on her cheek. "It is still an impediment." B'Elanna giggled, she then reached out to caress Seven's cheek. "You are so beautiful!" She leaned in to quickly kiss the woman's lips. "I feel like I'm drunk, on you, but it all seems so clear. Clearer then it has even been before." Seven titled her head. "Klingon's are known for their sensory acuity." B'Elanna smiled and kissed Seven again. "Its part of my being klingon, but it has nothing to do with physical senses. We better get going." Seven nodded and the two strode out the door and to the turbolift. B'Elanna spoke and then turned to Seven. "Bridge. So how do you think they will react?"</P>
<P>Seven turned to face her. "Their reaction is irrelevant. It is simply a matter of how well they assimilate the knowledge of our bonding." B'Elanna arched her brows, then smiled and nodded. As the doors opened and they stepped out on the bridge the eyes of the entire bridge crew focused on them, or to be more exact the matching bandages on their cheeks. The pair moved to stand by the command chairs where Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay looked them, then at each other, then back at them. Silence reigned until Seven spoke. "Captain, Commander, we would like to speak to you." With out a word Janeway nodded and stood up, motioning the four of them to her ready room.</P>
<P>As the door shut behind them Janeway was the first to speak. "Can I assume the situation between you two is resolved. The two women in question looked at each other and couldn't stop from grinning as B'Elanna spoke. "Yes Ma'am." Janeway nodded. "I'll assume any talk of discretion would be. futile. So I will trust that the two of you will not allow it to impact the performance of your duties." They both nodded immediately." Janeway's expression took a firmer note. "While I can not, and will not hold you responsible for the reaction of others I am going to ask that you first bring any matter to the attention of myself or Commander Chakotay."</P>
<P>The two women nodded again. "Dismissed." As the two women left Chakotay turned to the captain and smirked. She grinned back. "Well I can't have them killing my helmsman can I?" Chakotay laughed softly. "What about the rest of the crew?" Janeway looked thoughtful. "To be honest I don't think the majority of them will care, and the fact you and I have given our blessing should resolve the matter. It's about time isn't it?" Chakotay's laugh wasn't soft.</P>

<P>As the holodeck arch closed and then vanished B'Elanna Torres found herself in a bar. Though from the decor she realized it would be called a pub. As with most of Tom's simulation it was on Earth and from the lack of electronics she figured it was from some time before Earth's industrial revolution. She sighed as she realized she had learned more about Tom's hobby then his own history. Voyager's sandy haired helmsman was found coming from the back room. "B'Elanna!" He stepped forward and hugged her, not seeming to notice that she did not return the hug. "What do you think? An authentic Irish pub, I'm actually planning a whole town."</P>
<P>Torres nodded. "It's good work Tom, you really know your holograms." He seemed to notice her then. "B'Elanna? Is something wrong? What did you do to your cheek?" She took a deep breath and looked him straight in the eye. A look he seemed to shrink from. "Tom, you don't need to worry about me when you want to work on the program again. You don't need to worry about me period." The color drained from his features, as his body seemed to deflate. "What? B'Elanna? You can't mean that. Let's have a nice dinner. Heck we can have it here. I just finished programming the bartender. I think you'll like him. We'll eat and we'll talk."</P>
<P>She shook her head." It's been said Tom. More times then I like to think about." He seemed ready to speak again so she reached up and pulled the bandage aside. Upon seeing the bite Voyager's helmsman feel silent. "I don't hate you, and I don't want you to hate me. I just hope you understand I needed to find what was right for me, and not matter how much I loved you we were not it." He didn't speak as she turned around and called for the arch. As it appeared she stopped. "The harp is backwards." He looked up. "I'll fix it later. Bye B'Elanna." "Goodbye Tom." The doors opened for her and she stepped through to find Seven patiently waiting for her.</P>
<P>She automatically opened her arms and B'Elanna gratefully stepped in. First she just closed her eyes and took comfort in the embrace. The warmth the made it through the biosuit, and the scent that surrounded her. After recovering in that shelter she looked up into Seven's eyes. "It's done." Seven nodded, seeming as sad as B'Elanna. "Let's get you back to your quarters." Seven immediately started to walk, but was brought short by B'Elanna. "Let's go home."</P>
