<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 5 - Interpret -->

<p>B'Elanna gave a few her pillow a few more punches, but found it wouldn't give up what it would take to make her sleep. She rolled onto her back and stared up at the ceiling. As she lay there in the darkness she found herself smiling, almost giddily. They had their first date, her and Seven, maybe not a formal date, but she asked, and Seven accepted.</p>

		<p>After dinner in the mess hall they had lingered over some gelatin-like desert while making some pleasant small talk. Far different from the blush Seven had as she told B'Elanna about an interest in Klingons causing her to want to research them. She grinned as she wondered if it was just Klingons in general, or any Klingon in particular.</p>

		<p>As she thought of the creamy white skin gently shaded pink she found her breathing was getting deep, her skin feeling highly sensitive under her covers. She found it getting worse as she remembered the end of the date, with a frustrated growl. She had walked Seven to cargo bay 2 so that she could regenerate. They stood in the doorway for an eternity, each one not wanting the moment to end, she remembered her neck arching to the glowing blue orbs looking into hers, calm, yet questioning.</p>

		<p>Neither one spoke as Seven stepped into her arms, the engineer's hands coming to rest just above the firm swell of buttock. B'Elanna felt faint as she felt the taller woman's hands rest on her shoulders and saw those full velvet lips part, the soft pink of tongue a flicker behind. She remembered Seven's hand reaching to cup the side of her face as she leaned down. B'Elanna in turn stretching up to meet her. As she reached the full extension she could not help but hear the voice of the Doctor as it cut into her, and by the look on Seven's face it drew blood with her as well."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna Torres, I TOLD you that you needed to rest, yet here you are at a cargo bay!" While they parted as the Doctor announced his presence they still were close enough to see each other's rapid pulse and quickened breath. Two hard stares kept the Doctor from fully analyzing the situation, even as they let him know he interrupted something, which had the effect of cutting his tirade short. B'Elanna wanted to weep as Seven's posture and demeanor returned to its normal state. "The Doctor is correct, you must rest, and it is time I regenerate. Thank you for walking me to the cargo bay Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>The Doctor's face clearly showed confusion as B'Elanna forced herself to a similar stance and replied to Seven. "It was my pleasure Seven, we can continue our conversation at a later time." B'Elanna forced herself not to smile as the face stayed the same, but the eyes locked onto hers. "We will." B'Elanna forced her body to stop squirming under the covers and her hands back to her sides as she laid flat on her back and tried to order her body to sleep. Then she remembered Seven's words of how Klingon's listened to what they felt, rather then deny it, and listened to her body. Seven of Nine's efficient stride carried her though the opening doors and just next to sickbays main console where she saw the Emergency Medical Hologram was activated and sitting at his desk. Her presence was the result of a message from the Doctor on her alcove's console so she promptly stepped to the office door. "You wished to speak to me?" "Hello Seven, yes I had thought I would talk to you about last night." Seven had an honest look of confusion. "Last night?" The Doctor smiled as he sat up from his desk. "Now Seven, don't be coy. That intimate little scene I stumbled upon."</p>

		<p>"You mean with B'Elanna? We have yet to be intimate." The Doctor looked a bit shocked as he continued. "Perhaps I should say, "romantic" little scene. First I wanted to apologize, but I also have to ask for details." Seven regarded the Doctor from under her implant. "Details? Of what use would information of my romantic affiliation be?" The Doctor stepped closer, but not uncomfortably so. "So you and Lt. Torres have a romantic affiliation?" Seven looked a bit downcast as her voice lowered."</p>

		<p>I am unsure, while all available data would seem to indicate so, there has been no formal voicing of romantic intentions." The Doctor's voice had lowered as well. "That is its use to me. I am happy you are expressing your emotions, yet I also fear you over extending your emotional development." Seven considered the Doctor's words before she spoke. "I understand your concern, but in all development is not the risk of setbacks accepted?"</p>

		<p>The Doctor smiled slightly. "That it is Seven." The Doctor leaned on the edge of his desk as his smile grew. "So, have you kissed her yet?" Seven's voice almost seemed more downcast as she replied. "No, I do however feel that if you had not arrived B'Elanna and I would have shared our first kiss." The Doctor looked horrified. "I interrupted your first kiss? Oh Seven I am sorry." "It will be all right. My research has indicated anticipation can enhance an events appreciation." Seven felt the Doctors hand on her elbow guiding her to a seat as he spoke. "Perhaps we should go over your research." B'Elanna bit her lip in a failed attempt to control her smile as she saw Seven walk through the doors of engineering. The statuesque blonde was clad in her brown biosuit and B'Elanna thought that her own complexion would be the perfect accessory. Having one half-klingon engineer wrapped around her would go just right. Then as she saw Seven's eyes a brief flicker of worry went though her. "Seven, was there something I could do for you?"</p>

		<p>Even as she mentally added "Or to you." Seven's calm even voice replied. "I would like to speak to you, alone." Torres found she was biting her bottom lip as Seven led the way into her office. "Lt. Torres, I would like to know your intentions for our romantic affiliation." "B'Elanna suddenly felt a kinship to the young Harry Kim as she faced the former drones romantic advance, and her reply was quite similar. "What?" Seven's cool blue eyes were at a tilt as she leaned her head to study the lieutenant. "I wish to establish parameters for our romantic development."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna then realized the difference between now and Ensign Kim's earlier fiasco. Before Seven was reacting to a situation, now Seven was choosing to be in one. She took a deep breath and looked in Seven's eyes; her voice lowering of it's own accord. "I don't know Seven, and I can not tell you. If you really did research Klingons you know that we tend to leave the future to fend for itself. What I can tell you is that I care for you, and that I want to be with you. I can't promise the future, I don't know it. I just hope we can find out together."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna wasn't sure if Seven was expressing her emotions more, or if B'Elanna was just getting more in touch with the former drone's moods, but she saw the immediate softening of her features. "That is acceptable. The future has too many variables, and while loosing you would be unacceptable, being with out you is not an option." Torres stepped forward and pulled Seven into her arms, while she was too short to rest Seven's head on her shoulder she did manage to get Seven's head resting against her own as she rubbed soft circles though the brown fabric on Seven's back. Whispering in a soft, comforting tone as she felt Seven begin to relax into her, to let herself be comforted. "I'm not going anywhere, I promise."</p>

		<p>Seven brought her head up from resting against B'Elanna richly textured ridges to examine the compact woman curiously, one of those wonderfully warm hands reaching up to caress Seven's cheek while bottomless brown eyes swirled with wonder. "I said that you are amazing, slow to anger, yet quick to forgive. The logical part of her mind considered the words as the woman inside her used her customary tilt to lean into B'Elanna's touch. "Anger is a conclusion based on available data, but if the data is proved incorrect, or new data is introduced then the conclusion must be reevaluated."</p>

		<p>Seven felt a pang of concern stab through her as she saw moisture appear in B'Elannas eyes, but it went unnoticed as the woman ran a thumb from it's place on Seven's cheek to caress her lips. "I don't know why the captain wants you to become human, you're too good for us." Seven was starting to protest as B'Elanna brought her index finger to replace her thumb on Seven's lips. "Shhh." She finally saw a tear escape as she was pulled down to a parted mouth, her own breath catching as her mouth opened of it's own volition.</p>

		<p>A pressure, soft, asking instead of demanding, giving but accepting as well. Seven felt the already diminished distance between them vanish as their bodies pressed together.  The one hand still held Seven's mouth to B'Elanna's while the other had crept under Seven's arms to hold her at a spot between her shoulder blades. As Seven began to wonder what to do with her tongue she felt B'Elanna's touch hers, and hers pressed in turn. Like the kiss, Seven's tongue joined her mouth, exploring, testing, tasting, cataloging every sensation to store it in her memory forever.</p>

		<p>The moment ended all to soon as they parted for breath, B'Elanna resting her lips to Seven's chin while Seven found herself nuzzling B'Elanna's brow, her lips starting to move to the ridges above.  B'Elanna's voice was a pant as she finally spoke. "Wow, Seven." Seven found herself being pulled from her explorations to look into B'Elanna's eyes, but since she found she could never look long enough it was not much of an interruption. Both hands were cupping Seven face as the women started into each other's eyes. "Seven? No thoughts?" Seven found her voice heavy with emotion as she replied. "It was impressive, but insufficient in duration." Her last words were said as her mouth dived into to capture B'Elanna's lips once more.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna moaned from a spot deep with in her chest and felt it reverberate with out her body. Eager hands explored her body as an eager mouth held her own, a soft tongue pressing with the same enthusiasm as the hands were exploring. While her body's instincts were in full control the logical part of her brain couldn't marvel as it realized Seven had done her homework. That same logical part reminded her that her engineering crew was outside the door.</p>

		<p>She realized just how new Seven was to all of this, and if she didn't stop her that the hands now roving over her body would start seeking B'Elanna's skin. She pulled her lips from Seven's in order to speak. "S? Sev? Seven?Seven." Curious blue eyes looked at her over a nose still close enough to brush against her own. B'Elanna found herself extremely aware of the body pressed to hers, of the breath wafting across her face, of the exoskeleton covered hand that had found it's way under the lieutenant's tunic to now rest on her ribs, just over her hip on her undershirt.</p>

		<p>The awareness was tempered however by what she saw. Those soft blue eyes glowing filled with passion, and with trust. Her own hands went to Seven's shoulders as she eased herself away, only to rest her head to Seven's shoulder, the completely human hand moving to caresses B'Elanna's cheek as she had Seven's. "I do not understand, but I will comply." B'Elanna found her eyes getting moist once more as she looked up. "Seven, oh Seven, it is NOT you. It's me. I want this to be someplace more then my office in engineering."</p>

		<p>Seven's voice was soft as she lifted B'Elanna's eyes to meet her own. "Our location is irrelevant." B'Elanna's smile grew as she looked into blue eyes that had now grown determined. "Not to me, can you trust me on that?" Seven's head lowered and her cheek had leaned in to nuzzle to the side of B'Elanna's head. "I will comply." B'Elanna's felt her muscles clench at the words, but Seven must have felt them as well because she continued to speak. "Because I choose to comply. I trust you, which is why I will not resist."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna's smile grew fond as she reluctantly pulled away from the lovely form she had molded herself to, but she cupped that regal face in her hands. "It is futile after all." The smile Seven gave her had Torres walking several feet higher as they parted yet were barely a pace apart as they walked out of the office. Past a strangely silent engineering crew and to the main doors of engineering, where they parted silently, but with tender looks that spoke volumes.</p>
