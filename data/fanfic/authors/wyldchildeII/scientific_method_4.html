<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 4 - Test -->

<p>Seven of Nine was angry, even after expressing herself to Captain Janeway she could still feel her rage. No longer coursing through her it seemed to fortify her, like it had sank into her on a molecular level, tightening her musculature to near painful levels. Her cortical implant reminded her that the Doctor should be finished treating B'Elanna. Seven had actually been present when they had retrieved her from the surface and took her to sickbay, but the image of the hybrid's compact form looking even smaller on the biobed impacted the former drone greatly.</p>

		<p>While her rage did not vanish, it was forgotten as she turned the corner to sickbay and saw the doors open to reveal B'Elanna Torres and Commander Tuvok. The two did not notice her and began down the opposite hallway. "Lt. Torres, Commander Tuvok, I was coming to get an update on your conditions." Tuvok's eyebrow arched as he regarded the young woman before him. "That is most considerate of you Seven of Nine. My injuries have been treated and I have no signs of lingering damage. I think Lt. Torres would be best to speak about her own condition."</p>

		<p>During this exchange the lieutenant in question had been notably silent, her eyes locked on Seven of Nine, looking away quickly as the women's eyes met. Seven of Nine was in a similar state, as they seemed to be considering each other, yet looking away as they seemed to be noticed. "Which I will leave her to do. If you both will excuse me, I am returning to duty." With those words the Vulcan turned and strode away from the pair. "Are you? diminished lieutenant?" B'Elanna gave Seven a quizzical look and then an embarrassed smile."</p>

		<p>No, if there is one thing I have plenty of, it's violent tendencies." Seven's voice remained even toned, but also seemed softened. "You are a unique individual and the true crime would be in your alteration." B'Elanna briefly tried to fight the smile the words created, but quickly gave in. "Thank you." For several long eternities the women stood silently in the hallway, until B'Elanna spoke. "I suppose I should go get some rest in my quarters? walk me home?" Slowly, Seven nodded. As B'Elanna entered her quarters she turned to watch Seven storm in, smiling she had to speak. "Jeez Seven, you would think you were the one operated on." Sevens face had been down cast, but shot up at the engineer's words. "I fail to see what is so amusing. The captain's need for exploration nearly cost her two crewmembers." B'Elanna's smile paled a bit. "That's part of the job Seven. Were explorers." Seven's eyes locked on B'Elanna's. "You were damaged." She continued in a much quieter voice. "That is unacceptable to me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna tried to speak several times then managed to squeak out. "Thanks." Seven looked away, then back at B'Elanna. "I suppose I should leave you to rest." B'Elanna felt a rush akin to panic and had to speak. "No, you don't have to. I mean? I've been eating Mari food the past few days. So I should probably get something to eat first. I know you don't need to eat that much, but we could talk while I do." "I?" Seven smiled shyly. "I would like that." Seven of Nine found that she was a bit confused. Though Lt. Torres had helped her pick her nutritional supplement she had wondered why they had went to the mess hall to do so. She had found herself hoping to spend time alone with B'Elanna. Lost for a moment she wondered how the word alone could change so dramatically in meaning. From meaning the destruction of her old world, to now meaning the creation of a new one.</p>

		<p>She was compelled to look up as they found their seats and B'Elanna began speaking. "That soup may seem a bit bland, but when it comes to Neelix, bland ain't bad." Seven took her eyes from B'Elanna's face to look at the light colored liquid in her bowl as she picked up her spoon. "Taste is irrelevant, fortunately." B'Elanna laughed at that a light, soft laugh, but one that thrilled Seven to her core. Her eyes bright as she smiled B'Elanna replied. "Fortunately enough. Though your mind seems elsewhere?"</p>

		<p>Seven blushed slightly as the lieutenant seemed to guess her thoughts. "I, had thought we may have our meal in your quarters." Seven saw B'Elanna blush slightly at the suggestion while she replied. "Well, I guess I just wanted to be around others after being locked up?" In the middle of the lieutenant's sentence Seven felt her heart drop as she thought she was not enough company for the lieutenant until she heard her voice soften in mid-sentence. "? but I think you are all the company I'll need. If you would like to return to my quarters, we can."</p>

		<p>Seven took a sip of her soup for her suddenly dry throat. "That is not necessary, but thank you." As B'Elanna started cutting into a rarely done steak Neelix had pressed onto B'Elanna's plate as soon as she walked to the line, and refused any replicator rations for it. "I guess I just missed them all, knowing there was such a huge mess, just because of my Klingon temper." Seven sipped her soup and seemed to contemplate the statement. "I believe you are incorrect. The klingon psychology, while aggressive is not as focused on anger as it is on passion."</p>

		<p>Seven tried to not blush any further as her dinner companion seemed to examine her. "What do you mean?" Seven took a drink from her glass of water before replying. "Klingons feel all of their emotions with out the numerous barriers humanity and other species create, with the possible exception of fear. It seems a most efficient way of dealing with emotions." B'Elanna laughed at that, but this time it did not warm Seven as much as it made her worry about her companions mindset. "Efficient, and how is that?"</p>

		<p>While she could tell B'Elanna was starting to pull away Seven thought she would tell the truth, she didn't think she could tell B'Elanna any less. Looking deep into shading brown eyes she spoke softly, but clearly. "With the exception of fear the restraint's a klingon places on their feelings are all external, which encourages emotional expression. Something that seems much healthier then emotional methods like my own." B'Elanna's eyes softened almost imperceptibly as she reached out and laid her right hand on top of Seven's left, her fingers lightly brushing between firm metal and soft flesh."</p>

		<p>Emotions are not always what there cracked up to be." She looked from her own hand resting on top of Seven's. "Though they do have moments." After waiting a moment while her nanoprobes to restore her heart rate and breathing to normal levels she gently turned her hand so B'Elanna's palm was resting in her own. "Yes they do." After several moments of a more comfortable silence B'Elanna spoke. "So, have you been researching Klingons?"</p>
