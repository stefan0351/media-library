<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 5 -->

<P>B'Elanna Torres swallowed deeply and shuffled her feet. The Talaxian chef couldn't help but grin as he observed her reaction. The two of them were inside his kitchen because while Neelix was watching the recording made by another Seven of Nine she had paced her quarters like the proverbial caged tiger. Luckily it was now gamma shift and the two were able to talk freely. Only having to take care that no one wandered in looking for a midnight snack. Normally Neelix would be exhausted by this time, having usually been to bed several hours earlier, but right now the excess tension pouring off the engineer seemed to keep him from feeling his fatigue. "So when are you going to tell her?"</P>
<P>Her head snapped up. "Never!" Moments seemed to stretch into an eternity as the two stared at each other until Neelix broke the silence. "Then I'll tell the Doctor to start working on treatments for insomnia." She simply continued to stare at him, though her face showed some confusion. "B'Elanna, this knowledge is tearing you apart, and I KNOW that is not what that Seven intended. I also know that this Seven would not want you to bear the burden alone." She looked at him closely, and then turned away with a shout. "You knew! Damn it Neelix, YOU KNEW!" He just shook his head and turned to the refrigerators to prepare them a midnight snack. </P>
<P>"I'm the morale officer. It's my job to observe people, and I couldn't help but observe Seven of Nine. When the Doctor told me she would start eating I planned her meals around the times I knew you would be here because I knew it would make it easier to get her to stay. She loves you B'Elanna, whenever you and Ensign Paris fought she looked like she would kill him on the spot, and when it was over she looked heartbroken. Like she wanted to help you, but just didn't know how." She shook her head and angrily rubbed tearing eyes. "I've been so blind Neelix." He smiled. "You will be if you keep that up." He then took a napkin and handed it to her. To which she smiled as used that to dab at her eyes.</P>

<P>Chakotay took a deep breath as he looked at the now genuine calm of Seven of Nine. Since she had resolved herself to somehow help B'Elanna she had found that focus he normally saw her use to uncover the information Voyager needed. "Computer Override door, clearance Chakotay Alpha Rising 73." The doors to B'Elanna's quarters opened with a soft woosh as they saw the lights were darkened, but in the muted light from the doorway they saw her commbadge still glinting on her uniform jacket which was hanging on a chair that was pulled back from the console. The two shared a look as they stepped back and allowed the doors to close. </P>
<P>He then spoke. "Well, she's not in her quarters, and unless we go a ship wide scan for her DNA we'll have to search deck by deck. "Seven shook her head, but when she spoke her normally cool voice held the warmth of gratitude. "You have already done enough Commander. Our duty shifts will begin in under three hours, you should get some rest." It was his turn to shake his head. "Nope, I'm in for the long haul. It wouldn't be the first time I've pulled a shift on no sleep, and it won't be the last. Let's start searching." She seemed ready to argue, but then nodded as they tried to decide where to look first.</P>

<P>"Lieutenant, Neelix." Ensign Vorik followed the greeting with nodding at each officer in turn. Yet inwardly he had concerns, relations between the chief engineer and astrometrics officer were strained at the best of times, and with the refused proposal he expected the normal emotional volatility of the half-klingon to be at a high. It was with that in mind he spoke. "The Commander has been looking for you." Her fatigued expression turned questioning. "Oh? What was it about?" "He seemed concerned for your well being." Her smile still showed signs of her weariness. "I'll see him at the morning's staff meeting. That is if I can stay awake through it." </P>
<P>The Vulcan was thankful that she did not inquire about the first officer's odd hours or he could have been forced to tell her about Seven of Nine being with him, and seeming as concerned as the commander, if not more so. He knew she would consider it pity more likely then she wouldn't and react accordingly. "You have not rested yet?" She just shook her head. "Nope, what about you? Just getting an early start?" He looked as uncomfortable as a Vulcan was able. "I heard of the, event, in the mess hall and arrived early so that I could offer to take care of your duties for you today." She smiled. "Thanks Vorik, I'll keep that in mind."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Hello?" Commander Chakotay's voice didn't echo through the deserted mess hall, but it may as well have. It was too early for Neelix to be preparing breakfast and unless a crew member was snacking it would be deserted. Which apparently someone had because there was crumbs on the normally immaculate preparing tables, He brushed them off as he and Seven turned to look at each other, both faces showing disappointment at turning up another dead end. Seven wasn't gritting her teeth, but she looked like she wanted to. "This is getting frustrating." Chakotay smirked. "I didn't think the Borg got frustrated." She arched a brow, the humor seeming to lighten her mood. "As a human I would think you would know otherwise."</P>
<P>His smirk moved into a full-blown grin. "Well, we could scan for her DNA, but it would raise questions that might get in your way. If all else fails we can just wait outside the doors for her to report to the staff meeting. Though I think I will mark you both off duty today." "I can understand doing so for Lieutenant Torres, but then you would need to so as well for Ensign Paris. Relieving me of my days duties could also cause more questions." The burly officer shook his head. "I'm willing to bet Tom already asked for the day off, and I was ready to give it to him. As far as you, well one of the advantages of being second in command is that you only have to answer to the captain." The two stared at each other a long moment before Chakotay broke the silence. "I'll stall her, but I can promise nothing there." She nodded. "Acceptable, now we must decide where to look next."</P>

<P>"Well if it isn't acting Captain Harry." Harry Kim recognized the voice and the tone, and even if he felt a touch of nervousness he still smiled. "Now is that any way to speak to a superior officer?" B'Elanna laughed as Harry looked at her closely. "Couldn't sleep?" She pursed her lips and shook her head. "Nope, and Neelix here was unlucky enough to get pulled in as my company." Harry gave Neelix a mock sympathetic look. "Does this mean we will be on our own for breakfast?" Neelix puffed out his chest. "Not at all, in fact I was thinking B'Elanna would be able to help me out in the mess hall since Ensign Vorik offered to cover her shift." </P>
<P>The look of shock on B'Elanna's face vanished as she saw an almost startled look cross Harry's. "What, something up Harry?" "Were just running on a thin Alpha shift this morning. Tom's got the day off, you, and for some reason Seven does too." Neelix and B'Elanna looked at each other. "Seven has the day off?" He grinned slightly. "Yeah surprised me as well, but not 5 minutes ago Commander Chakotay and Seven came on the bridge and made the changes to the roster. Authorized Tom's time off, gave Seven the day off, and told me to tell you that you could have it as well."</P>
<P>Harry couldn't help but notice the worried look that crossed both of his friend's faces. "What? Is something wrong?" They both snapped their attention back to him as B'Elanna spoke. "Nah, I'm sure it's nothing." He still seemed to be staring curiously as the two made a controlled dash for the turbolift. In the car B'Elanna was the first to speak. "Do you think something is wrong with Seven? I mean we know Tom and my reaction to the proposal, but what about her?" He just shook his head. "At least she is with Chakotay, he has experience in counseling." </P>
<P>"Counseling! Do you think it's that bad?" The Talaxian tried to calm her. "B'Elanna, I'm sure she's fine. Seven's a strong girl." "Yeah strong, she just takes those emotions and shoves them deep inside and calls them "irrelevant." She seemed to be getting emotional herself. "She's still human Neelix, she still feels. I mean if she doesn't express her feelings they'll hurt her, emotionally, physically, I know." He shook his head sadly. "I guess you do." "I need to talk to her. Computer, pause turbolift, and give me the location of Seven of Nine." "Seven of Nine is the Voyager's Conference Room." B'Elanna twisted her head in an unconscious approximation of the woman in question.</P>
<P>"Conference Room? What would she be doing there? She's not on duty." "Yes, but until 2 minutes ago you were." The look that crossed B'Elanna's face was one that Neelix has never seen before, panic, pure heart pounding, mind numbing panic. For a second he thought she would feint, but at the last moment she managed to steady herself. "She wants to see me?" "It appears so." She appeared almost angry at the grin that spilt the Talaxian's features as he spoke up. "Computer, conference room." The turbolift began moving again as Neelix laid a supportive hand on her elbow. Though it was not sure if it was for emotional support, or to keep her standing.</P>
