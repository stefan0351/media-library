<p>B'Elanna felt numb, what was just a deuterium salvage operation had become something more, much more. Voyager had received a distress call, but as they got there the ship had been destroyed, or as she now knew, had self-destructed. What had caught her attention was that the debris field was FULL of deuterium. The Captain was ready to lay course back to the Alpha Quadrant when she managed to convince her to restock their deuterium supplies. Then in the debris field they found several things that did not conform to the rest of the fields make up. One of the things being what had appeared to be some sort of probe. She noticed the Federation style right away and was afraid that a rescue ship had been sent, and destroyed.</P>
<p>The notification she sent to the bridge had set of a flurry of activity, anyone who wore engineering yellow, and several who weren't were in the engine room going over the odd debris they salvaged. She had used her authority as chief of engineering to get a station to herself and she now looked over it to see the biosuit that had stopped being out of place in engineering. She swallowed hard and keyed the console to replay the piece of data she had recovered from the probe. The small screen came to life with the image of Seven of Nine, but not as B'Elanna knew her. The normally perfect hair bun was wild, and her flawless face seemed, melted. Even the ocular implant was running down her face as she spoke into the viewscreen.</P>
<p>"Personal Log Seven of Nine. We will not reach the demon planet. Acting Captain Harry Kim is still making all efforts to return us there, but all calculations arrive at the same result, Voyager, our Voyager will loose cohesion before that happens. Yet I find that I do not care. My own destruction seems irrelevant in what I have come to acknowledge as regret." The former drone seemed to take a deep breath to steady herself against forces far greater then the ones disintegrating her flesh. "Strangely my greatest regret is not the loss of Lieutenant Torres, for while painful death is a certainty for everyone. My regret is that she died with out knowing my feelings for her." B'Elanna paused the log entry and tried to steady herself as a wave of dizziness crashed over her. </P>
<p>With out thinking her eyes looked up over the console for the flawless features, and found them. Seven was watching her. It was subtle, and vanished as soon as B'Elanna looked up fully, but it was there. The rush of sensation that it caused threatened to send her crash to the deck beneath her. How long had Seven been watching her? As she resumed play on the recording she realized it was longer then she thought. "I did not tell her before her wedding to Lieutenant Paris, yet I did not tell her anything in the year and a half previous." Torres paused the recording again, her and Tom married. Sure they had talked about it. They also talked about how he would need to get his act together before it would ever happen. She allowed his hobbies, but she was not about to settle into a life of "See you later honey." Looking back at the recording she couldn't take her eyes off the woman's face. Even in its melted, misshapen state she saw more emotion then she had ever seen Seven show.</P>
<p>Her hand seemed to have a mind of its own as she reached out and touched the screen. The hand then moved over and restarted the log. "Only now, in the face of oblivion am I able to say it. I love. loved you B'Elanna Torres." Her eyes closed as she watched Seven end the recording and the screen go blank. They stayed closed as she tried to keep herself from crying. What a bitch she had been. Seven didn't endure her abuse because she enjoyed tormenting her; she endured it because she wanted to be close to her. "So was it a Federation ship?" Her eyes opened as she recognized the voice of Harry Kim and turned to face him. "Not quite, get the captain to call a staff meeting." Harry looked confused as he nodded and turned away. She gathered together all the salvaged data, but not before she tucked away the recording into a safe little out of the way place. </P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"So how did this other Voyager catch up to us? A lot has happened since the demon planet." B'Elanna kept her eyes on her superior officer as she answered Janeway's question. "They managed to create an enhanced warp drive. It was what caused their molecular structures to break down." The Doctor was the next to speak. "Then why did they use it?" "It would have gotten them to Earth in just over two years, and it was not harmful to humanoids. They just didn't realize that they were not humanoid." Then entire crew's eyes went wide as Janeway asked the question they all had. "Could we build our own?" B'Elanna took a deep breath as she started running schematics in her head. "Maybe, but the records were damaged when they lost cohesion." Janeway nodded curtly. "Have Seven work with you on recovering them." The Captain then paused a moment before resuming. "They may have been our duplicates, but from everything we have recovered they upheld the same ideals. That alone makes them worthy of remembering." The crew seemed sobered as the Captain spoke again. "Dismissed." The crew quietly stood up and walked for the door, but B'Elanna found herself intercepted face to chest with Seven of Nine. "Lieutenant Torres, if you will transfer the data to astrometrics we can begin reconstructing it there." The normal reply B'Elanna would have had to such a tone was noticeably absent as she replied. "Sure Seven, see you there." She seemed confused, but nodded as her normal, efficient, stride carried her from the room, and to B'Elanna's alarm she couldn't help but watch her go.</P>

<P>Both a biological and an enhanced hand clamped down on the astrometrics console. B'Elanna married, while she did not need to eat very much or very often the little she did have in her stomach wanted to exit. Her Klingon bonded to that fool who's only redeeming trait was a glorified sense of direction. It was already intolerable to think of her in his arms, but to know it would be forever. She knew that her duplicate shared her thoughts and she believed that to have first lost B'Elanna to marriage, and then finally to death would have left her eager to accept destruction. Even with her enhanced intelligence she could not recall a time when she did not find the Klingon fascinating.</P>
<P>Even before her link with the Collective had been severed she had recognized the engineer's efficiency and had thought her ideal for assimilation. Now the notion of destroying that individuality was no longer acceptable, but she still found that she could spend an eternity studying her, cataloging every part of her, learning every detail. It had become a familiar process that initiated any time she perceived the Lieutenant, be it seeing her in engineering or at a staff meeting. Or something as simple as hearing her voice over a comm-channel. It began again as the doors to astrometrics opened and the individual in question entered. It was just as quickly interrupted when she realized who entered with B'Elanna. </P>
<P>The normal interactions between her and Voyager's helmsman had always been forced. Looks aside, he considered her rather stuck up. In her case her scorn was only tempered by her lessons in politeness from the Doctor and the Captain. Thomas Eugene Paris was wasteful, while his skill in piloting was admirable it was his only redeeming trait. He was petty, concerned with only his own desires even to the detriment of others. Waking moment that he did not spend on the bridge or in sickbay were spent in his own desires which only indulged his own petty wants while adding nothing to himself and expending as many resources as he was allowed. Her normal disdain was exacerbated by the conversation he was having with her klingon. "So, B'Elanna and Tom got married? Makes you think doesn't it?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna sounded annoyed as she replied. "Yes, and then they died, that makes you think too doesn't it?" He didn't even seem to acknowledge Seven as he stepped in front of B'Elanna. "She saw something in her Paris. Can you tell me you don't see the same thing in yours?" B'Elanna sighed as she was forced to stop so she did not run into the helmsman. "Tom, I don't know what she saw. I just know that I am not ready!" Paris seemed ready to say more as Seven intervened. "I hope you are ready to go over the data."  At first Torres seemed shocked, but as she came to her senses she the look of gratitude she gave Seven warmed her from the heels of her biosuit to the top of her hair bun. "She's right Tom, I have to get to work." The sandy haired helmsman looked from one woman to the other, and decided to relent. "Ok, we'll talk later?"</P>
<P>Torres seemed to roll her eyes slightly. "Yeah, sure, later. Bye Tom." With out another word he left. She moved to the console Seven was standing at and both women turned to the viewscreen. As they started to work B'Elanna looked out of the corner of her eye. While Seven was not looking at her like they did in engineering her posture seemed a little tighter then before. Again she wondered why she hadn't noticed these things before. "Thanks Seven. Ever since Tom learned about the other Tom and B'Elanna getting married he has went from suggesting to demanding." The slender neck turned so Seven could look at her and arch her implant. "I can't see anyone demanding anything from you, at least not successfully." B'Elanna laughed as Seven continued. "Don't you desire to marry Mr. Paris?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna's face suddenly turned downcast. "I thought it was, but it's more the IDEA of getting married. You know? Swearing your life to someone and all that. I think we all want that life partner." "Yes." When Seven heard the emotion that slipped into her voice she slammed her will up like a containment field keeping an internal environment. While she forced her eyes to stay on the screen she could feel those brown eyes burning into her. "With Tom it's the reality that bothers me. I mean on that other Voyager he wanted to have their honeymoon in 1920's Earth! I mean his hobby is one thing, but this is our honeymoon we are talking about!" Seven had recovered enough of her control to give B'Elanna a questioning look, which caused her to continue. "Ok not OUR honeymoon, but you get the idea." Her voice softened. "I guess my duplicates death has made me think about those things we leave undone. or unsaid."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>B'Elanna shook her head in wonder. "This design is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. If they were not duplicates they would have beat us back to the Alpha Quadrant." "It is an efficient design. Most likely from all the shifts my duplicate picked up in main engineering." It was at that point Seven's smirk was noticed and returned, but distractedly because Torres noticed the dates on the extra shifts and noticed that they all fell after the marriage announcement. It caused a stab of heartache as she imagined Seven slaving away in engineering just to be close to some ill tempered engineer who was too thick to realize it. She was glad that Seven didn't look at her in close quarters like she did otherwise because her expression had grown tender, and it was her turn to observe. What B'Elanna didn't realize was that Seven was all too aware of B'Elanna's actions. While the close quarters prevented a visual examination she had learned to use her other senses, like she was now. Her hearing picked up the deepened pattern of the Lieutenant's respiration, and her sense of touch could feel each time B'Elanna Torres walked past or drew close. Even as she enjoyed the resulting sensations she chided herself. Lieutenant Torres did not feel the same, not here, and obviously not on the alternate Voyager. While it seemed unreasonable for her to choose a mate that had so little respect for her, or anyone it was still her choice. It was part of that individuality that she had learned to cherish as much as her efficiency. Even if she worried that the behavior of Lieutenant Paris would smother it.</P>
<P>Even as she enjoyed the engineer's attention she wished that it would stop. It caused her to think of things that were impossible, and that made them hurt all the more. Finally the logical part of her that had been cataloging the information looked at the situation, and it asked "Why was the Lieutenant looking at her in such a manner?" Initially she thought it was just because of her intervention in the conversation between her and Mr. Paris but that same logical part of her said that would be insufficient for the length of time that Lieutenant Torres was examining her. While the silence was exactly uncomfortable Seven still tried to break it. "Have you accessed the personal logs?" Since she was looking as she spoke she was able to see the engineer practically jump at the question.</P>
<P>"Personal logs? Why would we need to access them?" Seven tilted her head. "The observations of those involved could add to our understanding of the enhanced warp engines functioning. If you are concerned about reading personal logs I am sure that we can obtain the individuals permission in advance. Since I am already here to give my permission we can start with mine." Giving her permission to read her personal logs caused the strangest look to cross the face that Seven had already committed to memory. "Is there something wrong Lieutenant?" "No, no, your right I am sure the logs will have all sort of things we need to know." Despite the compliance she noticed the woman took a deep breath before bringing up the logs of the alternate Seven of Nine.</P>
<P>She was able to stay genuinely calm as they brought up the directory, while most would have been concerned about the revelation of personal details she knew what she had entered and could reasonably predict the entries her duplicate would make. While she would never burden B'Elanna Torres with her feelings for her the idea of sharing the other personal facts she felt comfortable recording gave her a pleasant sensation. B'Elanna seemed nervous as they opened the files and Seven spoke. "The files seem intact. It appears that I provided them with back up systems incase of degradation." The engineer's voice seemed thickened as she spoke. "I guess you wanted to make sure the universe heard what you had to say. I don't think we need to go back past the demon planet since we already know what happened." </P>
<P>While she was confused by the tone of voice she was strangely hurt by B'Elanna's desire to keep matters on purely professional concerns. The concerns seemed unfounded as they went through her personal logs. B'Elanna laughed when she heard Seven making allowances for things like Harry's chatter and seemed genuinely interested in her lessons with the Doctor. "I wish I had the Doctor there when I was learning all this." Seven tilted her head. "Why would you need the Doctor's assistance? You grew up among humans." The snort of laughter did not seem at all happy. "Yeah, but I'm not exactly human am I? Neither was my mom. Sure she taught me all the klingon manners, but when there weren't that many klingon's around you ended up learning the human niceties only after you made a fool of yourself." Seven noticed the distress and felt a need to remove it. "I am receiving the lessons and I still manage to embarrass myself."</P>
<P>The look of distress left B'Elanna's face as she turned to Seven and watched Seven turn to face her. "It's never easy Seven, but a sincere effort will get you farther then any lesson ever could. Something I probably should have told you after or 30th or so fight." The statement hit Seven with a wave of happiness. Her resulting smile caused her to crack a joke. "Why would you have waited?" Another unidentifiable look crossed the klingon's face. "I guess I was too busy fighting you." Seven's attempt to analyze what was wrong with B'Elanna nearly caused her to miss an irregularity in the files. "There is an inconsistency. The back ups indicate one file size, while the file is another." The normally emotive face seemed to become as emotionless as her own. "Probably just file degradation. I mean it went though the beacon's destruction and then the disintegration of the ship." Seven nodded, but did not seem at all convinced.</P>

<P>The doors to Commander Chakotay's quarters opened to let in a surprise. "Seven? Was there something I could do for you?" While he did not have the experience with the drone that captain did he could still tell that something was bothering her. "Commander Chakotay, from my understanding you have abilities in counseling?" He restrained his eyebrows from rising and simply nodded as she took a breath before speaking again. "I need someone to talk to." He motioned her to take a seat and hid his surprise when she sank down with out a complaint. "I guess the first question is why you are here?" She tilted her head in the all too familiar questioning expression. "I already stated, I need someone to talk to." He shook his head. "If you just wanted someone to talk to you could have went to the captain or the Doctor."</P>
<P>She nodded, but he noticed how her eyes did not seem able to leave the floor. "That is correct. You have both experience in counseling, and experience with the cause of my distress." He dropped his voice another register as it kept its soft tone. "Have you and B'Elanna been fighting again?" It was at that point she made eye contact. "No, and that is the problem." It was Chakotay's turn to look confused, and it must have been apparent because Seven of Nine continued. "I have become accustomed to fighting with Lieutenant Torres. It is this change that is confusing me." "What is the change?" "Hostilities have ceased. While I could have adapted to a lessening, the relations between the Lieutenant and myself seem entirely new." He nodded his understanding. "Was there a specific point that things seemed to change?" Seven seemed to consider for several moments. </P>
<P>"The change seemed to occur around the time we found the wreckage of the duplicated Voyager." Again he nodded. "That's not too surprising. I think the destruction of our duplicates has gotten us all thinking about the paths our lives have taken, and how they could have turned out. We have all faced destruction numerous times, but this time "we" didn't manage to come out on top." She titled her head. "What are you trying to say?"  He took a breath and paused for a moment. "Death is no longer an abstraction, our duplicates showed that it is a very real possibility. Maybe even more so for B'Elanna, she was the first to die." He noticed right away that his statement seemed to upset her and wondered if his thinking of her as a drone was inaccurate. </P>
<P>"Seven, you never seemed to care about B'Elanna's opinion before, why that change?" She looked up and took a breath that seemed unable to steady the emotions twisting around inside her. "Her anger would have been more damaging if I had chosen to acknowledge it." "Wait, more damaging? Your saying that it did effect you?" "Yes." "Now that she is treating you differently you are afraid of being damaged?" She took another, deeper breath. "Yes, she has made her feelings about me quite clear." He tilted his head in a considering manner. "Perhaps, or perhaps those feelings have changed. It could be that her duplicate's death has caused her to reexamine her life. What you need to determine is what you feel towards her." The paling of the already fair skin told Chakotay all her needed to know, but he also knew that counseling was more then recognizing a patient's emotions, but getting them to recognize them as well.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"You followed me." Chakotay grinned, but restrainedly at Seven of Nine. "Not at all, I asked the computer for the location of Lieutenant Torres and took a chance." She actually seemed angry as the first officer stepped closer but he tried to reassure her. "I am just here as emotional support. How are you doing?" The two pulled to the side away from those exiting and entering the mess hall. She was looking at nothing, somewhere past his shoulder. "I find I am apprehensive of her reaction." He shook his head. "For love to truly be love it has to be unconditional. You can't go in there expecting anything from her." "I still fear damaging what good will that has developed." </P>
<P>"Perhaps. I won't lie to you, but I remember you willing to risk your life for Omega, for that perfection. Is B'Elanna worth any less?" Her head shook immediately. "Then go in there. You excel in expressing complex concepts in understandable terms. This is not the same, but it is not very different." Her tension had reached levels that were physically apparent as she clenched and unclenched her hands and then turned and walked through the doors to the mess hall. He followed right behind her and was ready to reach out as Seven nearly swooned. They were looking at what the rest of the mess hall was looking at. B'Elanna Torres was sitting at one of the mess hall's tables and Thomas Eugene Paris was on one knee before her. </P>

<P>Thomas Eugene Paris had not risen from his knee, but B'Elanna Torres was no where to be seen. If someone where to ask those present they would say the scathing refusal still echoed in the now deafening silence. Ever dutiful the ship's morale officer bustled over to help the helmsman to his feet. As he did so he could hear him muttering as he shook his head. Once he was to his feet he spoke aloud as the rest of the crew quickly returned to the activities they postponed when they had seen the Ensign drop to one knee. "She told me Neelix, she told me but I didn't listen." Neelix got them walking towards his kitchen. "What did she say?" </P>
<P>He continued to shake his head and by his pallor the Talaxian feared that he had went into shock. "She said she was not ready, but I figured she just wasn't sure. I thought once she saw the candles, saw all our friends, saw how I set everything up for her she would have to say yes." The speckled features darkened as he listened. Both men too occupied to see the first officer rapidly depart the mess hall. "Sometimes it just isn't meant to be." The pale features shot up at that point. "Hey, this is just a set back. She just said she didn't want to marry me, right NOW. She still loves me." "I'd be careful Tom, love you or not I am willing to bet you are not our chief engineers favorite person right now."</P>
<P>He was shaking his head again, but now it was something-other then disbelief. "No, I'll go talk to her. Tell her I'm sorry." The ship's chef snagged an arm before he got out of reach. "Tom you just received a tremendous shock, and so did she. Let her cool down, and you take time to get your bearings." Tom Paris pulled free and seemed ready to leave as the doors opened to admit Harry Kim. Neelix offered a silent thanks to whomever had the foresight to call the helmsman's best friend, and apparently they informed him about the situation as he intercepted Tom with a hand on each bicep. "Woah there." "Not now Harry, I need to find B'Elanna." The men shared a worried look over Tom's shoulder as Harry then took a breath.</P>
<P>"Why did something happen?" Paris simply nodded and attempted to escape Harry's grip, but the operations officer was ready. "Let's sit down and you can tell me about it. Neelix, get us a couple beers." Paris seemed to take a long look as if he was just realizing he was talking to people and nodded. "Yeah, I could use a little something to settle my nerves." Neelix nodded and quickly moved away as Harry released Tom while motioning him to a seat. "Ok, start from the beginning." Paris nodded as he took a deep breath and ran his hands over his face. "Well you know most of it. I mean she nearly died, and her last words were that she loved me. It was after we recovered those records from the other Voyager, you know where we reviewed our doubles logs to see where things split?" Harry nodded; his mind drifting to his doubles doomed ride in the captain's chair. </P>
<P>"Well I read my doubles thoughts after B'Elanna died and I couldn't go through that Harry. I couldn't loose B'Elanna. So I thought that he had the right idea by marrying her." Harry's expression stayed inquiring. "That wouldn't have kept her from dying." Tom looked aggravated. "No of course it wouldn't! Still, it would have given that tie. It would say that we wanted a life together, even if we wouldn't get it. At least when his B'Elanna died it was as his wife." Neelix arrived with two glasses and a pitcher of beer. He set one large glass mug in front of each man and filled Tom's then Harry's. As he set the pitcher back down and stepped away Tom lifted it up and took a long drink. Pulling it away he seemed to stare into the golden liquid like some crying pool of old. "Now I've pushed my luck, and pushed her away."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>The cavernous expanse of Cargo Bay 2 opened in front of Chakotay, but his eyes went immediately to the flickering green glow coming from one of the Borg alcoves. As he crossed the bay he saw Seven of Nine, and had to reevaluate. He had always thought of the Borg in more primitive terms, much like a vampire he thought Drone's bodies possessed by a dark spirit. Yet as he stepped up onto the platform he realized this was no undead being out to drain away his life and replace it with it's own corruption. This was no walking corpse. This was a living, breathing, hurting woman. While she was not crying in the technologically induced torpor the redness around her eyes and the faint hint of tear tracks down her cheeks told him enough. </P>
<P>He already felt like an intruder, but it did not stop him from moving to the console and shutting down the regeneration cycle, after a moment of puzzling out the controls. The instinctive step forward happened before her eyes locked on Chakotay. "I do not wish to talk, now go away." "She told him no." Seven looked at him questioningly and he repeated himself with out altering his tone or expression in the slightest. "She told him no. B'Elanna told Tom she would not marry him."  "Are you sure?" He had to laugh softly at that. "Everyone there is sure. She said it in no uncertain terms." He then took a breath, and saw Seven seem to tense as if she were bracing for a blow. "I'm not sure if you should tell her your feelings right now." </P>
<P>She looked at him painfully, and her vice seemed to be holding on to the smallest fragments of its composure. "Why?" "B'Elanna is in an emotionally fragile state after something like this. I'm not saying you have to stay away. Just be careful, this kind of situation would be tough even for someone with a lifetimes worth of emotional experience." She seemed to have regained some of her composure as she tilted her head. "Then shouldn't I stay away to prevent further damage?" "No, actually I think you may be the best thing for her right now. You honestly care for her well being, and you are as blunt as she is." Seven seemed to consider for a heartbeat. "B'Elanna told me that a sincere effort will get me farther then any emotional lesson ever could." The tribal tattoo crinkled as he arched his brows. "That's some good advice. Do you think you can put it into practice, or would you like to finish regenerating?" Her posture straightened. "She needs me, regeneration will wait." He grinned as she strode from the Cargo Bay.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>B'Elanna laughed as her door opened; though in her current state it sounded almost like a sob. The Talaxian cook set the tray cover down next to the stack of banana pancakes he had just delivered to her quarters. "Remind me to put you in for a commendation." Neelix simply smiled. "Just doing my duty." She was utterly unashamed as she sat down and took the utensils to the stack of pancakes. An action that made his smile as he sat. "Get done talking to Tom?" He just shook his head to her question. "Harry's taking care of that. I'm here to see how you are doing." The expression on her face was distracted. "Poor Harry." "Poor Harry?" She looked at him and laughed rather bitterly. "What, you expect me to worry about Tom? He didn't worry about me."</P>
<P>Neelix shook his head. "Now that's not fair. He did propose." She set the fork down. "After I told him no. He just decided he knew better, like he always does. Do you remember the Day of Honor? How you told me about how much your traditions meant to you? Want to know what Tom said? He talked about how much time we worked on the holo-program. Not exactly the best start to a relationship. I feel wanted, but not needed. I guess I feel loved, but I don't feel very special. I feel like he wants me to have programming parameters like his cherished holo-programs." Neelix was chewing his bottom lip. "I can't argue with you there."</P>
<P>"Neelix? Can you keep a secret?" The look of pain on the engineer's face was enough to make Neelix nod silently. "One of the reasons I turned down Tom is. I realized I could have something more." She stood up and walked to her console. "Neelix, PLEASE don't tell ANYONE about this, but I need to talk to someone about it." She entered something into the console and Neelixes face was bathed in the screen's glow. "Personal Log Seven of Nine. We will not reach the demon planet."</P>

<P>B'Elanna Torres swallowed deeply and shuffled her feet. The Talaxian chef couldn't help but grin as he observed her reaction. The two of them were inside his kitchen because while Neelix was watching the recording made by another Seven of Nine she had paced her quarters like the proverbial caged tiger. Luckily it was now gamma shift and the two were able to talk freely. Only having to take care that no one wandered in looking for a midnight snack. Normally Neelix would be exhausted by this time, having usually been to bed several hours earlier, but right now the excess tension pouring off the engineer seemed to keep him from feeling his fatigue. "So when are you going to tell her?"</P>
<P>Her head snapped up. "Never!" Moments seemed to stretch into an eternity as the two stared at each other until Neelix broke the silence. "Then I'll tell the Doctor to start working on treatments for insomnia." She simply continued to stare at him, though her face showed some confusion. "B'Elanna, this knowledge is tearing you apart, and I KNOW that is not what that Seven intended. I also know that this Seven would not want you to bear the burden alone." She looked at him closely, and then turned away with a shout. "You knew! Damn it Neelix, YOU KNEW!" He just shook his head and turned to the refrigerators to prepare them a midnight snack. </P>
<P>"I'm the morale officer. It's my job to observe people, and I couldn't help but observe Seven of Nine. When the Doctor told me she would start eating I planned her meals around the times I knew you would be here because I knew it would make it easier to get her to stay. She loves you B'Elanna, whenever you and Ensign Paris fought she looked like she would kill him on the spot, and when it was over she looked heartbroken. Like she wanted to help you, but just didn't know how." She shook her head and angrily rubbed tearing eyes. "I've been so blind Neelix." He smiled. "You will be if you keep that up." He then took a napkin and handed it to her. To which she smiled as used that to dab at her eyes.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Chakotay took a deep breath as he looked at the now genuine calm of Seven of Nine. Since she had resolved herself to somehow help B'Elanna she had found that focus he normally saw her use to uncover the information Voyager needed. "Computer Override door, clearance Chakotay Alpha Rising 73." The doors to B'Elanna's quarters opened with a soft woosh as they saw the lights were darkened, but in the muted light from the doorway they saw her commbadge still glinting on her uniform jacket which was hanging on a chair that was pulled back from the console. The two shared a look as they stepped back and allowed the doors to close. </P>
<P>He then spoke. "Well, she's not in her quarters, and unless we go a ship wide scan for her DNA we'll have to search deck by deck. "Seven shook her head, but when she spoke her normally cool voice held the warmth of gratitude. "You have already done enough Commander. Our duty shifts will begin in under three hours, you should get some rest." It was his turn to shake his head. "Nope, I'm in for the long haul. It wouldn't be the first time I've pulled a shift on no sleep, and it won't be the last. Let's start searching." She seemed ready to argue, but then nodded as they tried to decide where to look first.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Lieutenant, Neelix." Ensign Vorik followed the greeting with nodding at each officer in turn. Yet inwardly he had concerns, relations between the chief engineer and astrometrics officer were strained at the best of times, and with the refused proposal he expected the normal emotional volatility of the half-klingon to be at a high. It was with that in mind he spoke. "The Commander has been looking for you." Her fatigued expression turned questioning. "Oh? What was it about?" "He seemed concerned for your well being." Her smile still showed signs of her weariness. "I'll see him at the morning's staff meeting. That is if I can stay awake through it." </P>
<P>The Vulcan was thankful that she did not inquire about the first officer's odd hours or he could have been forced to tell her about Seven of Nine being with him, and seeming as concerned as the commander, if not more so. He knew she would consider it pity more likely then she wouldn't and react accordingly. "You have not rested yet?" She just shook her head. "Nope, what about you? Just getting an early start?" He looked as uncomfortable as a Vulcan was able. "I heard of the, event, in the mess hall and arrived early so that I could offer to take care of your duties for you today." She smiled. "Thanks Vorik, I'll keep that in mind."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Hello?" Commander Chakotay's voice didn't echo through the deserted mess hall, but it may as well have. It was too early for Neelix to be preparing breakfast and unless a crew member was snacking it would be deserted. Which apparently someone had because there was crumbs on the normally immaculate preparing tables, He brushed them off as he and Seven turned to look at each other, both faces showing disappointment at turning up another dead end. Seven wasn't gritting her teeth, but she looked like she wanted to. "This is getting frustrating." Chakotay smirked. "I didn't think the Borg got frustrated." She arched a brow, the humor seeming to lighten her mood. "As a human I would think you would know otherwise."</P>
<P>His smirk moved into a full-blown grin. "Well, we could scan for her DNA, but it would raise questions that might get in your way. If all else fails we can just wait outside the doors for her to report to the staff meeting. Though I think I will mark you both off duty today." "I can understand doing so for Lieutenant Torres, but then you would need to so as well for Ensign Paris. Relieving me of my days duties could also cause more questions." The burly officer shook his head. "I'm willing to bet Tom already asked for the day off, and I was ready to give it to him. As far as you, well one of the advantages of being second in command is that you only have to answer to the captain." The two stared at each other a long moment before Chakotay broke the silence. "I'll stall her, but I can promise nothing there." She nodded. "Acceptable, now we must decide where to look next."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Well if it isn't acting Captain Harry." Harry Kim recognized the voice and the tone, and even if he felt a touch of nervousness he still smiled. "Now is that any way to speak to a superior officer?" B'Elanna laughed as Harry looked at her closely. "Couldn't sleep?" She pursed her lips and shook her head. "Nope, and Neelix here was unlucky enough to get pulled in as my company." Harry gave Neelix a mock sympathetic look. "Does this mean we will be on our own for breakfast?" Neelix puffed out his chest. "Not at all, in fact I was thinking B'Elanna would be able to help me out in the mess hall since Ensign Vorik offered to cover her shift." </P>
<P>The look of shock on B'Elanna's face vanished as she saw an almost startled look cross Harry's. "What, something up Harry?" "Were just running on a thin Alpha shift this morning. Tom's got the day off, you, and for some reason Seven does too." Neelix and B'Elanna looked at each other. "Seven has the day off?" He grinned slightly. "Yeah surprised me as well, but not 5 minutes ago Commander Chakotay and Seven came on the bridge and made the changes to the roster. Authorized Tom's time off, gave Seven the day off, and told me to tell you that you could have it as well."</P>
<P>Harry couldn't help but notice the worried look that crossed both of his friend's faces. "What? Is something wrong?" They both snapped their attention back to him as B'Elanna spoke. "Nah, I'm sure it's nothing." He still seemed to be staring curiously as the two made a controlled dash for the turbolift. In the car B'Elanna was the first to speak. "Do you think something is wrong with Seven? I mean we know Tom and my reaction to the proposal, but what about her?" He just shook his head. "At least she is with Chakotay, he has experience in counseling." </P>
<P>"Counseling! Do you think it's that bad?" The Talaxian tried to calm her. "B'Elanna, I'm sure she's fine. Seven's a strong girl." "Yeah strong, she just takes those emotions and shoves them deep inside and calls them "irrelevant." She seemed to be getting emotional herself. "She's still human Neelix, she still feels. I mean if she doesn't express her feelings they'll hurt her, emotionally, physically, I know." He shook his head sadly. "I guess you do." "I need to talk to her. Computer, pause turbolift, and give me the location of Seven of Nine." "Seven of Nine is the Voyager's Conference Room." B'Elanna twisted her head in an unconscious approximation of the woman in question.</P>
<P>"Conference Room? What would she be doing there? She's not on duty." "Yes, but until 2 minutes ago you were." The look that crossed B'Elanna's face was one that Neelix has never seen before, panic, pure heart pounding, mind numbing panic. For a second he thought she would feint, but at the last moment she managed to steady herself. "She wants to see me?" "It appears so." She appeared almost angry at the grin that spilt the Talaxian's features as he spoke up. "Computer, conference room." The turbolift began moving again as Neelix laid a supportive hand on her elbow. Though it was not sure if it was for emotional support, or to keep her standing.</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway knew that she didn't know what was going on, but she did realize there was something. It would be difficult not to with a bleary eyed Chakotay entering with an off duty Seven of Nine. She had been shocked when the order had come in, but when she learned that she was waiting for B'Elanna she assumed that the women were hopefully going to conference on the improved warp engines. Though she wondered it B'Elanna was up to it. While she would never begrudge any of her people the right to pair off, or get engaged Tom Paris had picked a time when they were closer to a way home then ever before, and quite possibly delayed their return with his impulsiveness.</P>
<P>Still, the rumor mill was already saying the women had managed to establish a peace, and if Seven was willing to wait for B'Elanna instead of demanding her presence Janeway was inclined to believe it. Then air that had been tense became electrified with something as simple as the opening of the conference room door. Standing there just on the threshold was her chief engineer B'Elanna Torres, behind her was the Talaxian morale officer Neelix. He seemed to be barricading the doorway because the woman's body language betrayed an intense desire to flee. Then as she looked into the face of the Lieutenant she saw that desire had left and her eyes had locked to a fixed point. Turning her head she saw that fixed point was staring back.</P>
<P>The urge to emit a long low whistle was quickly retrained, but none the less she realized the romantic staple had happened. Their eyes really did meet across a crowded room. It was at that point Janeway realized they had established more then a peace. The gaze of her first officer seemed to be taking in the scene as intently as she, and to be honest the rest of the room was, but when she locked eyes with him he smiled, shrugged and failed to look innocent. Her actual track of time had been lost as the air crackling between the women seemed to draw the rest out of the room, but her morale officer managed to bring things back to order when he walked over and took Seven's elbow to gently guide her to her feet. Using that hand he led her over to B'Elanna Torres and took her elbow in his free hand.</P>
<P>"All right now, you two have the day off go enjoy it. I am sure you can find plenty of things to talk about." Both women shot Neelix a glare as he led them to the door and shooed them out. Returning to his seat he smiled at Voyager's commanding officer. "Shall we get started?" While most in the room looked confused both Neelix and Chakotay had expressions that were far too smug for Janeway's liking, and she vowed that she would grill them for every piece of information they possessed. Her expression must have said as much because both men now had expressions that were far more humble, and far more to Janeway's liking.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Seven." B'Elanna?" "I thought you didn't work today." "I don't." "Why were you there?" "I was waiting for you. Why did you come to the conference room? You are off duty as well." Torres prayed that the emotional tones she was hearing from Seven were more then her deluding herself, but either way they caused her voice to deepen with passion. "I wanted to talk with you." For the first time she saw eyes that she had declared dead with out ever looking into them. With out thinking her hand started to raise and just as reflexively Seven seemed to step forward into the touch. They both seemed to realize where they were and pulled back. "My quarters?" "Yes, I believe mine would be, unsuitable."</P>
<P>The idea of Cargo Bay 2 being anyone's quarters caused B'Elanna's brow to furrow, but as they stepped into the turbolift she saw Seven shiver. All thoughts came to the present, to the moment. The biosuit regulated her body temperature so she ruled that out as a cause for the shivering. Eyes went wide as she realized this would be Seven's first time, those eyes scrunched together just as quickly as she chastised herself. That was getting way too far ahead of herself, but she couldn't help it. While they both had their eyes forward as B'Elanna croaked out the deck she focused on Seven's lips, and imagined what it would be like to kiss them.</P>
<P>"How are you functioning Lieutenant?" "What?" Seven of Nine had turned to face her companion and it put the well-developed body far closer then she was comfortable with. "Oh, I'm ok." The all to familiar eyebrow arch startled B'Elanna. "Ok?" Yet this time she looked deeper, she saw the muscles firmly clenched the body almost ready to try to flee the turbolift. That idea hurt her that she could want to run away from her. The next words seemed to pour straight from her mouth to her lips. "Oh Seven, I've hurt you so much." The cool, confident exterior shattered leaving the confused, vulnerable woman underneath who didn't resist as B'Elanna stepped forward. Strong, lean arms wrapped around her as the warm, firm body pressed close.</P>
<P>The forehead ridges that could fascinate her endlessly nestled close to her bosom as one of those hands slid up her back to the base of her skull. An eternity passed as she felt herself being pulled down, drawn down into smoldering brown eyes. Half way those eyes rose to meet her and lips pressed on her own. She gasped at the contact and B'Elanna seemed to take that as her cue. A nimble tongue invaded her mouth, skated along Seven's teeth, and pressed against her own tongue. The kiss broke as they heard the turbolift doors open, and when no one was there to see the doors open they held their embrace several moments longer. Even as they stepped from the turbolift the distance between their bodies seemed more a formality.</P>
<P>As she led the way to her quarters B'Elanna could feel Seven's eyes on her, it was starting to become familiar, and it was not at all unpleasant. After they stepped through the doors B'Elanna turned and saw the multitude of questions written all over Seven's face. Wordlessly she reached up and cupped and alabaster cheek, laying her index finger over pale rose colored lips. Breaking the contact she turned to her console and beckoned Seven a chair. When she sat, knees firmly together posture perfect B'Elanna whispered to the ear right above the starburst implant. "I'm sorry, I didn't know, I never realized. Until now."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Seven's face seemed to be hovering between its cold mask, and a need that was all too new to her. "So my double's words influenced you to not marry Ensign Paris?" B'Elanna could see the hurt trying to surface in the young woman's eyes. "No, the fact someone could love me, I mean really love me with out any strings attached. Well it told me that I could do better then Tom, and when I realized that Seven had your memories. I looked, I mean I really looked at you. I saw." She then proceeded to get down on one knee in front of the sitting Seven. "Oh Seven, I saw what I had been missing, I saw what I had needed all along."</P>
<P>Torres seemed on the verge of tears and with out a word she reached down and ran the pad of her human hand's thumb under B'Elanna's left eye. Her hand stayed there, caressing the caramel cheek and B'Elanna's eyes closed as she leaned into the touch. With her eyes closed she did not see Seven lean in, or her lips part. She only realized it as warm lips pressed against her own, and this time Seven's tongue sought entry, which B'Elanna quickly gave. Seven drank deep, it was almost like assimilation, but instead of simply taking, it was given, and Seven gave in turn. Taking some of the distinctiveness that was B'Elanna Torres and replacing it with a piece of herself.</P>
<P>The kiss broke, but their lips hovered near one another as Seven's lips began to speak in nothing more then a whisper. "You need to rest, and I need to regenerate." For an eternity B'Elanna just stared at her, the expression making Seven feel adored, almost worshiped. She reluctantly came to her feet and B'Elanna rose with her. Neither woman seeming ready to speak. B'Elanna looked into her eyes and seemed ready to grab hold of Seven and refuse to let go and Seven finally understood. She pulled the smaller woman close, cradled in her arms. "You have me Lieutenant Torres, and I have you. That will not change" She smiled at the woman in her arms. "You know how I am when I set my mind to something."</P>
<P>Seven was squeezed tighter, but when it finally broke and B'Elanna looked up Seven could see she was smiling. Then a familiar gleam came into her eyes; it was one Seven recognized from when the engineer would have a moment of inspiration. B'Elanna quickly disentangled from Seven's arms, which left Seven acutely aware of her bodies absence. B'Elanna then turned to the bed and tore off the bedding, she then balled it all up into a mass that she was able to carry and turned back to Seven. "Ok, I'm ready, let's go to Cargo Bay 2." Seven arched her brow as a quizzical grin covered her face. B'Elanna got a grin herself as she answered. "You'll regenerate in your alcove, and I'll sleep on the floor. It wouldn't be the first time I've had to sleep on deck plating."</P>
<P>"This is not a Maquis ship." B'Elanna was carrying the mass of bedding in one hand as she pushed Seven towards the doors with the other. "I'll be fine." "You'll be sore." Seven didn't bother turning around but B'Elanna could see enough to know the woman was smiling. There were several crewmembers passing by on their way from the turbolift but each time the women stared them down in unison before continuing on their way. Once they entered Cargo Bay 2 Seven turned and entered commands into the door panel. "This room is sealed." B'Elanna turned and raked her eyes over Seven in an unabashed appraisal. "Alone at least." The ex-drone's eyes were wide. "Like I said, I believe my quarters will be unsuitable." She paused, continuing to enjoy being able to examine the woman openly, and then she grinned.</P>
<P>"I know, I'm just teasing." She then stepped forward and gave Seven a gentle kiss. "If you want me to be your first I promise you it will be someplace much more special then the floor of a cargo bay." Seven's expression was open, unguarded. "I want you to be my first." B'Elanna pulled Seven into a tender embrace, which lasted several minutes. Only to be parted as she guided Seven to her alcove. "There is no need for you to be uncomfortable. I can come to you as soon as I finish my regeneration cycle." B'Elanna shook her head as she walked over to examine the controls. "I would rather sleep on the floor with you, then in a bed with out you."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Neelix and Chakotay slumped in their seats, and if the truth were known Janeway wanted to as well, but she forced herself to sit upright behind her desk. She now knew everything the two men did which ended up a surprise because they did not know about the others involvement until they were both called into her office. She sensed Neelix was still hiding details about B'Elanna's feelings for Seven, but he admitted they were there and Chakotay confirmed that Seven had the same feelings for B'Elanna. She pinched the bridge of her nose.</P>
<P>Janeway knew that her next letter home would have to include an immense apology to her mother because right now she had two of her own "daughters". locked in Cargo Bay 2! The groan that wanted to escape her lips didn't, but it must have registered on her face because both men were looking at her questioningly. Turning her console to face them the note from Tuvok detailing how Cargo Bay 2 was now sealed with Borg algorithms. The men grinned, then looked at each other and ginned even more. Neelix was the first to speak to Janeway's aggravated features. "Captain, they are both adults and in the privacy of Seven's quarters. I see no harm in it."</P>
<P>Janeway arched her brows. "Then I am sure the two of you will be happy to make sure it doesn't impact ships function." They both seemed aghast as they looked at the captain. "Gentleman, I do agree they will make a lovely couple and would never dream of interfering with that. I also know that one has next to no experience with her emotions and the other has next to no experience controlling her emotions. When you add the fact they both occupy important positions on this ship. well I am sure you can see why I am concerned. They may end up working together beautifully, or their old arguments may turn into lover's spats that shake the whole ship. Either way I am leaving it up to you as the first officer and ships morale officer to take care of. Dismissed."</P>
<P>The expressions as they rose and the way they walked looked like men on their way to the gallows. As they stepped from the Captain's Ready room they looked out on the bridge and the most noticeable thing was the shocked expression on the face of Ensign Harry Kim. They both seemed to look from the ops station to the helm in unison as Neelix spoke up. "I'll go find Tom." Chakotay nodded as he walked over and sank into his first officer's chair he was already going on no sleep, and he had a feeling the day had only just begun.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>The helmsman of the starship Voyager was already outside Cargo Bay 2 and appeared ready to put his fist through the door's touch pad. He refrained and continued to press keys in a futile attempt to crack the Borg encryption code. He was alternating between that an pounding on the door while shouting. Neelix found he was glad that security had yet to arrive because while it would take several people shouting to be heard inside the cavernous bay the odds of someone outside the bay hearing and calling security were much higher. He stepped up and seized the had that was about to pound another series of thuds on the doorway. "Tom? What's wrong?"</P>
<P>He jerked his arm free and growled. "I'll tell you what's wrong. Seven's got B'Elanna in there!" He held his hands up in a placating gesture. "Now Tom, Seven and B'Elanna left the staff meeting together. I'm sure they are just working on the improved engine and wanted privacy." He sneered at the Talaxian. "There are locks on the doors to astrometrics. Harry clued me in. He told me about the looks they were giving each other. He told me that if I didn't get down her now I might never get B'Elanna back. I bet the Borg bitch was just waiting for this to happen so she could swoop right in an assimilate B'Elanna." Paris seemed ready to pound on the doors again when Neelix was able to move in the way.</P>
<P>He realized that this was what Janeway was talking about. While security could let him out for his duty shifts he would have a hard time piloting Voyager if B'Elanna came out here and tore his arms off. As Paris stepped to the side to batter the door again Neelix raised his voice. "Enough! You said it yourself, even if Seven WAS waiting YOU were the one who proposed when you knew B'Elanna was not ready. Now step away or I will call security." Even as Paris huffed and stormed away Neelix knew it was not over. Neelix considered his options, he knew he would have to update Commander Chakotay, and he thought it might be wise to get Ensign Kim to help, because while he was Tom's friend he was Seven's and B'Elanna's as well.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>As she opened her eyes she realized her head was no longer resting on her pillow. The fabric was like Seven's biosuit, and with a start she realized it was, her head was resting in the lap from where Seven was sitting with her legs stretched out in front of her. As she opened her eyes she met a gaze that was filled with wonder, and enraptured with her. "Umm, hi." Seven smiled. "Good morning." She sat up, but didn't move far from Seven as she did so. "Wow, I don't think I've ever slept that soundly." Seven arched her brow. "Apparently not, I received note from Mr. Neelix that Ensign Paris had attempted to gain entry while we slept, and was not at all subtle in doing so." B'Elanna's expression soured. "He WHAT?"</P>
<P>Seven put a comforting hand on the klingon's hip. "Tom Paris is irrelevant, isn't he?" The soured expression softened. "Yes he is, at least as far as I'm concerned, but Neelix warned us for a reason." Seven nodded. "I will remain vigilant." Torres smiled, and squirmed a bit as the warmth of Seven's hand transferred from her hip and into her pelvis. She suddenly realized what she was doing and stopped breathing. B'Elanna noticed and grinned as she rested a hand on each side of Seven's face. "Breathe Seven, you have to breathe or you will pass out." Her grin grew as Seven took several long, shaky breaths into her lungs. "Now I need to go to my quarters and freshen up."</P>
<P>As she stood Seven remained seated and stared at her, First B'Elanna stared back, then rolled her eyes. "Ok, Now WE need to go to my quarters to get ME freshened up." Seven stood and waited patiently. She followed B'Elanna out as B'Elanna spoke. "Yeah, I just need to get myself together since you are always perfect." Seven kept a straight face as she replied. "I am Borg." Torres Laughed. "Fine, you can give me some pointers."</P>

<P>"What can I say, love is in the air, and it's casting a greenish glow." Harry grimaced at Neelixes attempt at humor. "What about Tom?" Neelix seemed genuinely saddened. "I think Tom had been on thin ice from the start and he finally broke through the surface." Harry shook his head. "After everything else B'Elanna always forgave him?" "Yes, but there was never a better option." Harry scoffed. "Better? The two fight worse then Tom and B'Elanna ever did." "You're right there is a lot of emotion between them isn't there?" Harry shook his head. "That's not what I meant Neelix, and you know it!"</P>
<P>"Harry, except for the Doctor and Captain Janeway you have probably spent more time with Seven then any other member of the crew. Can you tell me you couldn't see how she feels for B'Elanna?" When Harry didn't reply and stared at the mess halls floor Neelix continued. "Or perhaps you didn't want to?" "No, I noticed. I even tried to find out what B'Elanna was doing right. I don't know if you noticed my more assertive self?" Neelix grinned. "I think most of the crew has." Harry returned the grin, but it was tinged with sadness. "I guess it was too little, too late huh?"</P>
<P>"Not at all, I think in this case those two have things in common that just can't be duplicated, but enough differences to keep things interesting." "They spent the night together. Well it was a day, but they both slept together, though it was in Cargo Bay 2." Wordlessly, even breathlessly Ensign Kim's eyes got wide and Neelix blushed. "I'm pretty sure all they did was sleep, or regenerate. B'Elanna camped out on the floor during Seven's regeneration cycle." Harry seemed anguished, but he dug and found some inner reserve to steady himself with. "Now we need to help them along?"</P>
<P>Neelix smiled. "It's like the plants in Keses garden. It needs to be given plenty of care to grow healthy and strong." "You know they probably would hate us if they learned we were trying to help them along?" Neelix simply arched his brows. "Well I'm not going to tell them." Harry exhaled. "How can I help?" In response to Neelixes expression his face steeled. "You were right, B'Elanna IS my friend, and Seven is too. If I can't be the one to make her happy I am at least going to make sure she is with someone who will."</P>

<P>"Seven, you CAN come in here." The voice of Lieutenant Torres seemed amused, but a careful observer might notice a slight bit of shyness. The blonde head seemed to peek around the doorway as it was followed by the rest of Seven of Nine. She was attempting her casual Borg expression, but it seemed somewhat feeble when she saw the now clean and completely naked form of B'Elanna Torres step from the shower. The women stared at each other until B'Elanna looked down at herself. The action seemed to free Seven to speak. "You are exquisite." They both seemed startled by the sudden expansion of Seven's vocabulary, but B'Elanna's wide smile seemed grateful.</P>
<P>Seven seemed regretful as B'Elanna started to get dressed, but that simply earned her a smirk, which got B'Elanna a smirk in turn. Both women grinning, but both obviously bashful. Seven was the first to speak while B'Elanna finished putting on her uniform. "What shall we do this evening, besides sleep in YOUR quarters?" The half klingon threw the former drone a look, but then smiled. "That's later, though I suppose we should get some rest so we will be ready for the staff meeting tomorrow." Now that B'Elanna was dressed Seven's typical expression seemed firmly back in place. "That will not be necessary, you and I have been reassigned to work on the improved warp engines."</P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed taken back so Seven continued. "Mr. Neelix informed me when he informed me of the attempts by Ensign Paris to break into the Cargo Bay." A dark look crossed B'Elanna's face as she affixed her commbadge, but as she was about to affix her collar pin symbol Seven stepped forward. She took the symbol as B'Elanna looked at her, then lifted her chin. Neither was breathing as the symbol was put in its place with out a sound. As Seven stepped back she seemed her normal calm, but her eyes betrayed a tenderness. The dark look didn't quite make it back, but B'Elanna did seem sobered. "I think Tom is going to have to be my first order of business."</P>
<P>Seven arched her brow, but now the expression that normally left her incensed just had her arching her brows in turn. "Need I remind you that we are working together?" B'Elanna shook her head. "On the engines, not on this." A look of hurt crossed Seven's eyes. "We must work together on everything. I need that unity." B'Elanna stepped forward and touched the taller woman's cheek as she then kissed her softly. "I'm the one who was stupid enough to get involved with him in the first place. I don't want to make that your problem too." Seven seemed both grateful for B'Elanna's touch and heedless of it as she looked into the woman's eyes. "If we are unified ones problems belong to the other as well. Even if the only support we can offer is giving them our time and energy."</P>
<P>The brow under the ridged forehead furrowed as she thought. They were a Collective. In Seven's mind from her perspective they formed a Collective of two. While drones may work on separate tasks it ended up benefiting the whole. Their eyes met and B'Elanna conveyed her understanding. "Ok, what should we do about Tom?" Seven smiled. "I believe we should do nothing. Anything we do Mr. Paris will perceive as an attack, which will cause him to escalate the conflict further." "So we are just going to let him get away with trying to break in on us while we are sleeping?" Seven nodded. "Mr. Neelix has resolved that situation. Now we should remain alert for the next one."</P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed to mimic Seven as she raised her brow. "How do you know there will be a next one?" "The personality of Mr. Paris would indicate further attempts to disrupt our relationship and reclaim you. Which I can not blame him for." The last sentence seemed little louder then a whisper as B'Elanna then stepped close and wrapped her arms around Seven's waist. "We'll it's not going to happen. Tom's been a loser his entire life and he's just going to have to deal with it, but what did you mean about not blaming him?" Seven's eyes looked deeply into B'Elanna's. "You are beyond value, so attempting to regain you is only logical."</P>
<P>B'Elanna blushed and seemed to bury her face against Seven chest. The woman bringing her enhanced hand to caress B'Elanna's hair while her human hand rested at the small of the engineer's back. B'Elanna then brought her face from its resting-place and looked up at Seven. "Well we have already sorted out the information we recovered so should we go cordon off a corner of engineering and get to work?" Seven shook her head. "I believe a science lab would be more suitable." B'Elanna grinned. "I think you just want me to yourself." Again Seven shook her head. "I just assumed you would be less comfortable with my displays off affection in front of your engineering crew." An attractive blush was Seven's only answer.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"It has to be Borg technology, that's the only answer. She somehow managed to assimilate B'Elanna when we weren't looking." Harry did his best to not look put out as his friend Tom Paris launched right into the thoughts that were ripping around in his head. As he sat in a corner of the mess hall that was usually barren, but even more so as the crew gave the jilted helmsman a wide berth. "Tom, you can't really think Seven did something to hurt B'Elanna." Tom looked up and Harry could see the dark circles under his eyes, his first word coming out almost like a sigh. "No, she had no way to know I would barge ahead and propose. I just don't know what to do Harry. Do you remember when I went undercover to find out who was reporting to Seska?"</P>
<P>When Harry nodded Paris continued. "Neelix asked me why I was leaving and I told him how I mess everything up must mean that on some level I don't want any friends. I was partially right. It's not that I don't want friends, it's that I don't want to have to put anything into them. I just want constant happiness, and endless joy. Heaven forbid I would have to put anything into it. I guess I just want life to be one big holo-program. Or I did. That's the problem Harry, I loose B'Elanna just as I am getting the idea. Which, to use sickbay terms is like finding the cure after the patient has died." Harry shrugged. "Well, then you just keep the cure on file and use it on the next patient." Tom shook his head. "I'm not out of the running yet."</P>
<P>"Tom, what are you planning?" Ensign Paris seemed to be getting far more animated as he spoke. "What? Seven stole B'Elanna from me so I am going to steal her back. Seems only fair." "Tom, you're doing it again. Seven and B'Elanna seem to be making something wonderful together, and you just expect her to drop it and come running back to you." His hands seemed ready to flail but they rested pointing at Harry. "She already has something wonderful, me. Let Seven find her own lover. You've been carrying a torch for her since she got on the ship." Harry shrugged even as the words bit deep. "Yeah, but the difference is I want Seven to be happy, and that seems to mean she'll be with B'Elanna."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but couldn't she be just as happy with you? Then everyone gets to be happy." Harry shook his head. "It might work that way in a holodeck, but reality would have B'Elanna hating the both of us, Seven in a state that would make your average drone look cuddly, and you and I would STLL be alone." Paris was shaking his head, but he was also refusing to look at his friend, which caused Harry to sigh. "Tom, promise me you won't do anything hasty. Promise!" Paris shook his head, but he didn't seem very enthusiastic about it.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Seven! We're supposed to be working." The tone was typical Seven, but the grin was anything but. "We are working." B'Elanna smirked back at her. "You're supposed to be working on the engine, not on me. Though I am a bit surprised, I have never seen this side of you." Seven was still smiling, but it had become shy. "This experience is new to me, and I wish to gather all I can from it." B'Elanna heard the words, but she also head the emotion underneath them and she stepped forward to catch the drone's hips in her hands and stretch up to kiss her.</P>
<P>"Seven, this is not a singular experience. you initiated a mating bond with me. I'm not letting you go that easily." The shy expression was complimented by a blush, which Torres openly adored. Seven tried not to blush further as she turned back to the console. B'Elanna did as well, but was sure to brush up against Seven, and linger there. As she too got back to work she spoke with out looking. "I give as good as I get Borg." Seven pressed into the contact. "A hypothesis I will be sure to test." The Klingon brow arched. "You really are getting good at this. "I adapt quickly." B'Elanna grinned. "A hypothesis I will be sure to test." The women were smiling together, but the smiles turned to frowns in unison as the science lab's doors opened.</P>
<P>"Ensign Paris." Seven was the first to address their visitor and as she did so she seemed to step in front of B'Elanna. The gesture did not go unnoticed and Tom held his hands up in a placating gesture. "I'm not here to fight either of you." He took a deep breath. "I'm not quite sure why I'm here. The only thing I am sure of is that I don't want to fight either of you. I guess that's why I'm here. I just hope we can all move on." Seven was the first to speak again. "Yes, WE will move on." The woman standing behind her put a hand on her elbow and slid in front. "I hope we can to Tom. I really do. It's going to be in your hands."</P>
<P>The helmsman looked at her with undisguised longing, which caused B'Elanna to look pained, and Seven to narrow her eyes. The man then nodded and left. B'Elanna let out a long sigh, which cause Seven to look at her. "Whew, I'm glad that's over, and it is Seven. Now it is officially over." Seven continued to examine the one who had assimilated her so long ago. "I hope that someone will be sure to inform Mr. Paris." B'Elanna looked hurt. "Don't you trust me?" Seven stepped closer to her as her voice grew soft. I trust you, and I trust your responces. I also trust that will not keep Mr. Paris from trying to steal you back." B'Elanna could see Seven's arms were spread to wrap around her and she gratefully stepped into the embrace.</P>

<P>"Well Mr. Paris seems quiet." Harry looked at Neelix as he said. "Too quiet." Neelix made a dismissive gesture. "He's been quiet, respectful, and careful to only see them as necessary." Chakotay chimed in from his chair in his quarters. "Yes, but Paris has never given up this easily." While all of the men considered it absurd on some level they had been having the meetings since they had become chaperones for the budding romance between B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine. Harry was the next to speak. "Well, how have Seven and B'Elanna been doing?" Chakotay smirked. "Well they say they will have a working prototype by next week. Which has stopped the grumbling that covering their shifts was causing."</P>
<P>Neelix had a snort of laughter. "Yes, the crew has been saying that if letting those two have romantic rendezvous in the science lab will get them home sooner then they would volunteer to play the violin outside." Chakotay examined the morale officer seriously. "So the crew isn't objecting?" Neelix sounded enthusiastic. "Objecting? They're rejoicing! Not only are they building our way to Earth but they are being NICE about it." Harry Kim scoffed. "Nice?" Neelix continued his enthusiastic monologue. "Yes! Seven's mind is finally thinking of something besides efficiency." Neelix took his voice to a purr.</P>
<P>"Or more to say she's thinking ways to do other things efficiently. B'Elanna, well B'Elanna seems far less tense." Chakotay held up a hand to stop the speculation. "So things seem good on that front." Chakotay had realized the same, but needed to hear what the crew was thinking. He came to the simple conclusion that if you gave the women each other and a project to work on and they would be happy. Though they would not get to lock themselves away like they are doing with the improved warp engine he knew the ship was always in need of improvements. Though if this engine worked out they wouldn't have long before they would start encountering deep space vessels from the Alpha Quadrant.</P>
<P>He knew they would have to cross the bridge when they got to it. He knew the Federation thought of them as "the Maquis". He also knew that she was part of his Maquis crew and he would do everything in his power to protect her. The problem now was Seven. He knew she would be of far more interest to the Federation then some Maquis engineer. Yet that Maquis engineer would challenge the whole Federation to protect her drone. That was her personality, and his talks with B'Elanna reinforced the notion. He just hoped that the Admirals would realize Seven would be a greater tactical asset alive then she ever would as a dissected specimen. Partly because he knew that part of defending B'Elanna would be defending her, but when he thought about it honestly he had to admit the same qualities that led him to become B'Elanna's friend were leading him to think of Seven as one as well.</P>
<P>The other two officers brought him back by wrangling over the potential actions of Ensign Paris. "Gentleman! Gentleman! We're keeping an eye on Tom, and we can't do anything based on suspicions. Maybe it's the fact we are having actual meetings but the fact of the matter is so far, so good." Harry's face got a dark grin. "Yes, but this is the U.S.S. Voyager, can that last?" Chakotay shrugged. "I don't know, that's why we are continuing the meetings."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Captain Janeway's voice echoed in the cavernous shuttle bay. "How are we doing?" The sounds of movement greeted Captain Janeway as she made her way to the shuttle's hatch. The sight of her astrometrics officer lying on her back greeted her. Her chief engineer was sitting near by, but Janeway noticed the PADDs on the other side of Seven which told her that her chief engineer had been lying across Seven's abdomen as she worked. While B'Elanna seemed slightly red in the face Seven gave no indication she was flat on her back as she turned her head to her superior officer. "We are ready to begin the testing phase."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled as she nodded. "Excellent." Her voice dropped slightly. "That's one of the reasons I came down here to speak to the both of you. We know that in any testing phase there is a test pilot, and we have had a volunteer." While she knew both women had been growing closer she was given a graphic example as B'Elanna Torres fixed her with a gaze as cold as any Seven of Nine ever had. The fact she was facing it from both women caused her to sigh. "Ensign Paris is our best pilot, and has said he wants to do what he can to help." When both women continued to stare Janeway shook her head. "I've already allowed it. I just wanted you two to know in advance."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's voice was still cool. "Thank you Captain." Janeway nodded a bit and walked out of the shuttle bay. The two women looked at each other and their expressions were anything but cold. Seven had yet to rise from her position lying on the floor. "What are your feelings about this?" B'Elanna let out a breath. "He IS the best pilot, my feelings won't change that. He's also been keeping his distance, but I'm still nervous. Then I think I'm just being paranoid and not giving Tom any credit." Torres was on Seven's left side, which had her enhanced hand moving up to rest on B'Elanna's thigh. Her weight seemed to shift on its own to press into Seven's touch as Seven spoke. "Regardless of the cause Ensign Paris earned your distrust."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled as she laid down again, this time resting her head on Seven's left shoulder. "Thank you." While she was too close to see it she felt Seven's brow arch. "What are you thanking me for?" B'Elanna smiled and snuggled closer. "For accepting how I feel. Not judging or evaluating it, just accepting it." The human hand reached around to play with B'Elanna's hair and it caused a sigh of contentment to slip past the klingon's lips. "I love you." Seven replied immediately, but her voice was very quiet, shy, the words showing how new the expression was to her. "I love you too."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Chakotay never liked Tom Paris. While he had gotten over much of his original antipathy he never grew to trust him either. That mistrust was in full force at the moment. It was Alpha shift and his chair allowed him to keep an eye on the helmsman, and he did not like what he saw. Tom Paris seemed a little TOO together, TOO calm, and he had ever since Neelix had pulled him away from Cargo Bay Two. Some would say Chakotay was being paranoid, but they probably didn't realize that Chakotay was able the proverbial voice of experience having known Tom Paris long before he had ever set foot on Voyager. Tom Paris was far too self-centered to let go of something he thought of as "his" and far too arrogant to step aside with out being shoved there.</P>
<P>He could see Kathryn Janeway from the corner of his eye. He knew that she shared his concerns about Tom Paris, but didn't share his mistrust. For some reason she seemed to think Paris had some untapped potential. Of course the fact he was the son of her mentor had to play some part, and that was one of the things that aggravated Chakotay most of all. Not only had Paris been alternating between riding daddy's coat tails while hiding behind daddy's rank. He also treated his father like dirt, spitting on his father's legacy while enjoying all its benefits. Even when Chakotay rejected his heritage he made the break clean and didn't drag his people through the mud with him.</P>
<P>Ironically it was Tom's best friend that seemed to agree with Chakotay. That said something in and of itself the fact that his best friend and his worst enemy seemed to agree that he could not be trusted. Though he found he could not blame Voyager's cook for trusting the helmsman. Thomas Eugene Paris had been using people all his life, and unless you knew him he was entirely believable. It was only hard-earned experience that kept Chakotay wary and even now he was willing to listen to Neelix protest the officer's innocence. He was willing to listen, but had yet to believe it.</P>
<P>They were entering the enhanced warp engines testing phase, and as soon as he saw the name "Tom Paris" listed as the vessel's test pilot an alarm went off in his head. Seven and B'Elanna were finishing the enhancements to a shuttlecraft's engine and by tomorrow or the next day it would be ready for its maiden voyage. Yet the project is what brought the women together, and by volunteering Tom Paris had managed to get himself a spot close to both women.</P>
<P>That fact alone wanted to make him alert security, but with out cause it would go no where. So Chakotay came up with the next best thing. The idea came upon him suddenly and it made him want to smile. As the second best pilot on Voyager there would be no one better to copilot for Ensign Paris for such an important flight. The first officer was still smiling as he started entering information into the console in his armrest.</P>

<P>B'Elanna ran her forearm across her forehead. The slick feeling of the sweat gathered there finally getting to her. Of course it just mingled with the sweat already dotting her arms, but they were far to active for her to notice that. The work had already made her muscles burn as well as making her body sweat. A bead ran from under her ear and down the side of her neck. The sensation caused her to turn her head and she caught sight of Seven. "Didn't she ever sweat?" As the thought echoed her more reasonable side reminded her that the biosuit took care of maintaining her body temperature. Yet as she looked she saw something more in those beautiful blue eyes.</P>
<P>She had grown used to the feeling of Seven watching her, and had actually grown to like the feeling, but this time it was not the tender expression watching her. Seven's eyes seemed narrowed, and her breathing seemed heavy. Seven of Nine, former Tertiary adjunct to Unimatrix 01 was turned on. B'Elanna Torres, stripped down to her under tunic, sweating and panting with exertion was turning her on. Suddenly she had an idea of how she could make the former drone break a sweat, and the images caused a wicked grin to appear on her face. "B'Elanna?" The words broke through to her and she looked at the concerned expression on the porcelain features.</P>
<P>"Yes?" "You were smiling?" B'Elanna's grin softened into a smile. "You have that effect on me." The fair face turned a soft pink as B'Elanna smiled as a wicked idea entered her mind. She forced the grin to the smallest of smiles as she went back to work, but this time it was different. She stretched far more, and if she exhaled she made it deeper and louder. When she had to pass near Seven she made sure she passed as near as possible. When she was so close she noticed the way Seven's nostrils flared and her chest heaved ever so slightly, the muscles under the under the biosuit taut with more then the exertion of modifying the shuttlecraft.</P>
<P>"Seven? Are you ok?" A more experienced observer would say that B'Elanna sounded far too innocent, but even if Seven had the necessary emotional experience she seemed far too distracted to notice. "I apologize B'Elanna. I am feeling distracted." B'Elanna stepped close. "Really, what's distracting you?" It was at that point Seven seemed to catch on as she looked deeply into B'Elanna's eyes. Her brow arched as she stepped close to B'Elanna as well. "I find I am distracted by the functioning of your muscles." B'Elanna smiled as Seven's hands slid up her back softly massaging said muscles. "Are they performing efficiently? The former Borg's voice was little more then a whisper. "They are a most efficient design."</P>
<P>The desire B'Elanna Torres heard made her bite her bottom lip as her knees seemed to buckle, but she didn't fall because Seven tightened her grip and held B'Elanna to her. The feel of Seven's body against her own was heavenly even if the only skin she had touched had been on Seven's face and hands. What left her confused was the fact that no matter how aroused she was she didn't want to touch any more of Seven's skin, not yet. It was not that she didn't want to. It was that she knew there was a time and that time had not arrived yet. Relationships like that had been few and far between for B'Elanna Torres and she wasn't about to let hormones mess things up.</P>
<P>Seven seemed to feel the same as she eased her hold when B'Elanna found her feet once more. Both women just stared at each other, their eyes saying more then any words ever could. Just as silently they turned back to work, B'Elanna the first to speak in the period after. "If this works we will be home in under two years." When Seven didn't respond B'Elanna stared at her back for a long moment. "Seven? Don't you want to get back to Earth?" Shoulders seemed to slump as Seven replied. "I have been away from Earth over three quarters of my life. The majority of my recollections are from the Collective and to them Earth was simply a highly resistant planet." Torres walked over to where Seven was working. "Those are their memories, not yours. When we get back we will make some for you." The responding smile was shy, but sure.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"So, do you think they've slept together yet?" Harry Kim shook his head and continued to eat his meal. "That's none of my business Tom." Tom Paris didn't quite look up from his meal as much as he raised his mouth father from the plate. "Why not, you've been the one who had the inside track ever since the get go? I'm just curious about how they are doing." The look Harry shot over his plate was blatantly suspicious, and Paris caught it. "Harry, I just want to see B'Elanna happy, I swear." The operations officer did not seem at all convinced, but he nodded none the less as Paris continued to speak. "I mean my life is going to be in their hands when I test out this new engine design. I think we all remember what happened with the last one."</P>
<P>Harry then spoke. "I'm sure Captain Janeway remembers the most of all, but just remember you're not testing it alone." The Tom Paris charm seemed to be working overtime as he spoke again. "I'm looking forward to it. With everything I was going to have to keep watch on a second set of eyes will make things a lot easier. Come on Harry, don't you trust me?" He seemed genuinely regretful. "I want to, I just know you have either acted more mature than you have the entire time I've know you, or you're up to something." Paris actually grinned at that. "So you automatically assume I'm up to something? Isn't it possible I just grew up?"</P>
<P>Harry smiled to, but not as enthusiastically as his friend. "Well you've known Tom Paris longer then I have." Tom Paris nodded. "No, no, I see what you are saying. There was a time I would have been obsessed with winning B'Elanna back, but I am honest when I say I've grown up. I'm going to see her happy." Harry looked at his friend for an eternity. "Maybe, but I can't help but notice you can't seem to refer to Seven of Nine by name."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>The crew of Voyager was not a large one by most standards, but when every crewmember not on duty seemed intent on getting into a shuttle bay the crew seemed far larger, but Captain Janeway could not really blame them. They had a way home, one that did not rely on alien technologies, or other species, one that they had come up with all on their own, after a fashion. Janeway stepped forward, but her mood was far darker then the reset of the crews, and they seemed to notice it right away. A more sobered gathering stared back at their Captain. "We are gathered here today to take our next big step home, but before we take that step we need to take a moment to thank those who made it possible."</P>
<P>Near the shuttle B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine looked at each other, thanking the crew silently for all they made possible. &gt;From the central position Janeway spoke again. "They were sampled from our DNA, but more then that they were sampled from our memories. They wanted to get home just as badly as we do, and I think the best tribute to them will be when we pull into Earth orbit." The crew broke into applause as the captain fell silent. The crowd then parted as Tom Paris entered the shuttle bay. They split before him to allow him to make his way to the shuttle.</P>
<P>When he got to the shuttle he threw a boyish smile at the two women. "I guess Chakotay's running late." A voice with in the shuttle contradicted him. "On the contrary Paris, I've already been here an hour and a half." B'Elanna's smile seemed slightly forced as she made a gesture into the opened shuttles door, and surely enough there was Voyager's first officer in the copilot position familiarizing himself with the controls. Paris shrugged and moved to the pilot's chair. "What's a matter Chakotay? Has it been too long since you've flown one of these things?" Both men had their eyes locked on their consoles as Chakotay replied. "Considering it's an experimental design? Yes."</P>
<P>Paris laughed and shook his head. "Don't worry. I've got it all under control. We leave the shuttle bay, do a little light year loop, and then land back in the shuttle bay. No problem." Chakotay didn't look convinced. "Well then it should be done quickly." Paris nodded, and seemed distracted as he slipped into his piloting mode. "And there's no time like the present. Preparing for take off." A cheer came from the bay outside as the men ran through the take off sequence and the shuttle rose from the deck. There was a slight flicker as the ship passed through the force field that separated the bay from the void of space. The gathered crowd watched breathlessly as the ship moved away from Voyager, and then vanished to the pin prick of light left behind as a ship goes to warp.</P>
