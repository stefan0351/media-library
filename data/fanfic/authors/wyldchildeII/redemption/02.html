<P>While B'Elanna had grown accustomed to being watched the look she was currently receiving caused her to flinch. "What?" The exclamation finally caused Seven of Nine to grin as B'Elanna stared at her. "Don't tell me you're not nervous?" Seven tilted her head as B'Elanna paced. "No, I'm not. The design is sound. If there are any problems we will correct them." All of her fidgeting and pacing stopped as she looked at the former drone. "As simple as that huh?" The grin had become Seven's most regular smile. "Yes." "What about Paris and Chakotay?" While Seven's hands were linked behind her back she seemed almost to shrug. "They are accomplished pilots and all possible safety features are established. The most likely difficulty will be in brining the engine online and maintaining it. Catastrophic failure is unlikely."</P>
<P>It was B'Elanna's turn to tilt her head. "Unlikely, but not impossible." Seven's features stayed calm. "The very nature of space travel is based on that acceptance of risk. Just as they accepted the risk when they agreed to be test pilots." B'Elanna resumed her pacing. "So what are you telling me you won't miss them if something DOES happen?" "Quite to the contrary they have been valued members of the crew, and their loss would be damaging. The fact still remains that we needed to test the enhanced engine and they had the skills to do so." B'Elanna ran her fingers through her hair in an aggravated gesture. "That, and they volunteered. Which is what's getting to me. They HATE each other. Even when I was dating Paris they were both holding their tongues out of respect for me."</P>
<P>"Perhaps that same respect is what drove them to volunteer?" The look B'Elanna gave seemed distressed and Seven felt the need to respond. "Though that seems unlikely. The fact they did not volunteer at the same time indicates separate motives." At B'Elanna's questioning look Seven continued. "Mr. Paris was the first to volunteer which would indicate either a desire towards the ship, or it's designer." "You think he doing it for me?" Seven nodded. "To get close to you. I told you I would be vigilant." B'Elanna smiled a bit shyly as Seven continued. "Commander Chakotay volunteered after Ensign Paris which could imply his antagonism is what drove him to volunteer."</P>
<P>"So Chakotay volunteered to protect me from Paris?" Seven arched her brow. "In his perception perhaps, but it is just as likely he is motivated by his dislike of Mr. Paris as much as he friendship with you." B'Elanna seemed stunned a moment, but then grinned ruefully. "I suppose your right about that. Guess have to let the boys be boys?" Seven nodded. "They could be nothing else. We will simply have to deal with any consequences."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Bringing engines online." Chakotay nodded as he kept one eye on his display and the other on his copilot. "Engines are stable, brining enhancements online." Tom Paris seemed entirely focused on his display as he replied. "Roger that, let's brace for impact." Yet as the steady thrum of the warp engines became a constant hum the two men felt no disturbance. Paris sounded confused as he spoke. "Warp 8, warp 9, war 9.95, and holding. No visible engine stress." Chakotay nodded. "Matter/anti-matter mix at standard, nacelles warm, but holding." The voice of Paris seemed calm, but also seemed more alert. "Better not break out the champagne just yet. Power transfer is starting to back up, then engines are TOO efficient they aren't using everything they are getting."</P>
<P>A calmed breath escaped Chakotay's lungs as he brought up the information that was on Tom's console. "That's because the enhanced engines are on, but you are keeping us at warp 7.8." "What? I'm trying to take the engines off line before they blow us up!" When Chakotay turned his chair to face Voyager's helmsman Paris lifted his hands from his console. "Have a look for yourself." As Chakotay leaned over the console he was keeping one eye on it as well as one eye on Tom Paris which left him unprepared for the console to explode in his face. What he did notice was how Tom Paris was already out of the way as he was hurled back to the cabin floor, and from there he saw the helmsman take his copilot's position and continue to enter commands.</P>
<P>As he lay there one the floor he wasn't sure what got him back up, anger, adrenaline, the fact the explosion seemed to be more sound then furry? He wasn't sure but something had him springing from the floor to crash against the helm where Tom Paris latched onto him. An upraised elbow drove Paris back into the seat as Chakotay felt cartilage bend, but not break. The elbow crashed back again into the nose and this time the cartilage gave way to the pressure as blood started to soak into the uniform black. Knowing he had to end the fight quickly while keeping the shuttle intact he looped one elbow under the chin of Tom Paris while slipping behind him. The forearm began applying crushing pressure to Tom's windpipe and it caused a gurgling sound to come from purpling lips, but Chakotay knew it was not enough.</P>
<P>He could see the helm from his position and the engines were near critical, yet Tom Paris was struggling back with everything he had. The first officer was just glad the man spent more time on the holodeck then he did in the gym. With grim determination he knew what he had to do to save his own life. The arm that was not around the throat of Tom Paris had been bracing the choke, but it let go and grabbed the back of the head of Tom Paris. With an exhaled breath it twisted quickly while pulling upward. There was a sound that reminded Chakotay of his darker days in the Maquis, but to an unblooded listener would sound like Neelix breaking up stalks of one vegetable or another for Voyager's next meal.</P>
<P>Not concentrating on what he had just done he dumped the now lips form to the floor and slipped into the pilot's seat. "Chakotay to Voyager. The engines have been sabotaged and are about to blow. I'm duping the core and need an emergency beam out as soon as I drop out of warp." Janeway's voice answered him. "Acknowledged, what about Ensign Paris?" Chakotay's words were clipped. "He's dead." Janeway's voice was deepened, but controlled as she replied. "Negative, we still read his life signs." At that point Chakotay looked over his shoulder and saw eyes staring at him from a head twisted at an unnatural angle. His lips were a grim line as he turned back to the controls and entered the final commands. As the woosh of the core entering the void of space reached his ears he turned and knelt beside Tom Paris. "Chakotay to Voyager, two to bream out!"</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>B'Elanna felt strong hands turning her, but knew immediately they did not belong to Seven of Nine. As she was turned around she was looking into the eyes of Voyagers first officer. "Don't feel sorry for him B'Elanna. He was willing to sabotage our trip home, risk my life and his own. He brought it all down on himself." She turned from Chakotay and walked for sickbay's doors. Over her shoulder she heard the first officer's voice. "It's wasn't the engine, and it was not your fault." While B'Elanna did not turn around Captain Kathryn Janeway did. "What the hell happened?" The eyes of Commander Chakotay never left hers. "He tried to sabotage the flight, and when I tried to stop him he attacked me. When I was left between using lethal force and being killed in a warp core breech I chose to use lethal force."</P>
<P>The face of the petite captain was pale, but she nodded. "The Doctor is still in surgery. He says you did quite the job on him. Right now it looks like Paris will live, but only here in sickbay where he can be constantly monitored, and he will probably never have sensation below his neck." The stony silence that greeted the pronouncement might have made Chakotay appear cold, but Janeway could see the big man's eyes and she knew the news rattled him. She reached up and squeezed his shoulder. "You gave B'Elanna some good advice." He nodded as the two of them watched the Emergency Medical Hologram as he drew on every ounce of his programming to repair what took Chakotay mere milliseconds of force to destroy.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>B'Elanna staggered down the hallway towards the shuttle bay. Crewmembers saw the dazed look in her eyes and could guess the cause. Her former lover had gotten his neck broken by the first officer. While many had said Tom Paris would get his neck wrung they never thought it literal and if the truth was told they were in shock as well. Of course the fact that the shuttle had been sabotaged had ended up being circulated hand in hand with the news of the helmsman's injury and even as they tried to sort through the feelings the twin events gave them they wondered which one weighed on B'Elanna Torres more. All of the looks and whispered speculation fell of deaf ears as B'Elanna stumbled to the turbolift and then stumbled into the shuttle bay.</P>
<P>The entire crew gathered saw her enter but it was their crew leader Seven of Nine who saw the engineer's state and strode up to her. When she took the engineer in her arms the rest of the crew quickly went back to their work. As she ran a comforting hand through the shorter woman's hair Seven whispered in her ear. "It was not your fault." Torres just nodded as she sank into the embrace. Her head was suddenly pulled from the bosom it nestled to. Radiant blue eyes bore into her own. "Ensign Paris risked his life and Commander Chakotay's along with the best opportunity this crew has had to return to Earth. When he was in danger of getting caught he assaulted Commander Chakotay." The grip remained soft on her face, but still felt stronger on her cheeks.</P>
<P>"The cause for the Ensign's behavior is because he was never held personally accountable, by blaming yourself you support his actions." The eyes that looked back into Seven's were still wet with unshed tears, but the chest rose and fell with several deep, steadying breaths as the nod she gave was far more sure. The hands on her face gave a supportive caress as they turned her to the shuttle and fell away. Though one hand found and held B'Elanna's as it did. "The test did serve its purpose. We learned the engine can take the appropriate stresses. The sabotage actually helped confirm it." Harry Kim picked that point to step from the crew around the shuttle, and B'Elanna was noticeably avoiding his eyes.</P>
<P>The young man stepped close and maneuvered until his eyes caught B'Elanna's. "B'Elanna, I don't blame you, no body does. I knew Tom was going to try something but I didn't think he would be this stupid. Don't feel sorry for him. That was his intent all along. We actually found the he had rigged the pilot's helm to explode before he ever left the ship. Though it was a low power rupture, more the heroic wound kind of thing." The Klingon's almond eyes had gotten wide as Harry continued. "Yeah, then the recorders showed him saying the engine was TOO "efficient". We figure he wanted to discredit Seven by making her look responsible for his injury."</P>
<P>The sorrowful look in her eyes had been replaced by their usual fire. "Then I get mad at Seven and run back to him to nurse him back to health! Nurse him back to health? He'll be lucky if I don't go down to sickbay to finish him off!" Harry shook his head. "When it was learned he risked our ride home most of the crew felt that way." "What about you Ensign Kim?" The two snapped their attention to Seven of Nine who looked at them calmly. Harry paused before he answered. "This was not a case of typical Tom. I mean this could have hurt the whole ship. this could have KILLED Chakotay." The two women continued to look at him. "I've been friends with Tom a long time, and this kind of thing is going to make me take a long look at that." The three nodded, but none of them looked happy about it.</P>

<P>"So is the crew still speaking to me?" The voice of Tom Paris was a bit breathless from his position lying on his back staring at the ceiling. He would have chosen another position, but Voyager's EMH had erected a force field to keep him immobile after his verbal warnings were not enough. "Well I am." Paris rolled his eyes. "You're speaking to a patient." The EMH sighed. "I couldn't tell you, though I'll admit I haven't had to turn away any visitors." A sigh was his first response as his patient began to speak. "I wasn't going to mess up our way home. I just wanted to make it look like Seven had been too efficient yet again and gotten me hurt."</P>
<P>The EMH continued for him. "Then you save the engine from being destroyed by Seven's rampant efficiency while getting a few burns for dramatic effect. B'Elanna comes to her senses, leaves Seven and tends your injuries before fixing the engine and delivering us all home. Is that the gist of it?" The Doctor's normally sarcastic tone had become scornful. "See? Even you hate me now and you've never seen Earth." The Doctor walked up and placed his hands on the side of the biobed. "I'm angry because you nearly killed yourself AND Commander Chakotay over a bad break up. I'm angry because you continue to disregard feelings other than your own, and I'm angry because even now you worry about yourself."</P>
<P>Tom Paris looked like he was trying to shake his head, but could not because of the retraining field. "That's not it at all. B'Elanna would have me back, Seven would understand about being human and making mistakes, and if Harry was any smart he would be able to move in and finally get the girl." The Doctor shook his head. "I would like to think Mr. Kim would have more sense then that. You set up that little wager over Seven of Nine and its fall out was disastrous. I'd hate to think what could have happened this time." "You don't get it. Nothing bad was supposed to happen! Everyone was going to end up happy." The EMH stuck his head over the head of Tom Paris. "One problem, you got caught."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Now, how do I punish someone for trying to sabotage our ride home?" Janeway looked across her desk into the face of her first officer, but he seemed unwilling to look at her. "I have to decline to comment on that." Janeway expelled a sigh. "I'm just asking for your thoughts, both as first officer, and as someone who was almost killed." "As first officer I have to note that the near destruction of the experimental craft only happened because I interfered. The same goes for his assault on a superior officer." Janeway shook her head. "He attempted to damage ships function and you simply did your duty by trying to stop him. The fact is that he did more than attempt to interfere with an experiment. This experiment is going to be our way home. As far as I am concerned that is as bad as tampering with the warp core or life support."</P>
<P>Chakotay nodded slowly. "As someone who was almost killed, and as someone who wants to get home I have to say this has been unacceptable. Even when he violated the Prime Directive and risked the crew he was doing it for moral reasons and the crew was just guilty by association. This time his actions were solely for his own purposes and endangered the crew directly. We have said it time and time again. "We're all we've got out here." "Thank you Chakotay both as my first officer, and as my friend." He looked at her expectantly and her eyes fell shut as she massaged the bridge of her nose.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paris has proven that he can be a capable crewmember, but his behavior as an officer has crossed the line. So effective immediately Mr. Paris is no longer a Starfleet officer. He will be listed as an enlisted crewmember AFTER the completion of Starfleet basic training under Tuvok. Until such time he will not be allowed to serve in any function on this ship and will be considered a civilian passenger. His holodeck and replicator privileges are revoked and will only be reinstated upon the completion of his studies. Any privileges remaining are awarded to Mr. Neelix to distribute among the crew as he sees fit." Chakotay nodded. "I don't think I should be the one to inform him. So I can inform Mr. Tuvok or the Doctor."</P>
<P>Janeway held up her hand. "I pronounced the sentence and I will deliver it. It's been my leniency that's allowed it to get this far." Chakotay seemed ready to argue, but the hand Janeway held up stopped its path back down to her desk and motioned him to silence again. "Chakotay, we want Paris to take responsibility for his actions, and I need to take responsibility for mine. I wanted to mentor Mr. Paris like his father mentored me, but instead I coddled him like his father's name had been doing all his life. I still believe in Mr. Paris, but I realize that he won't take advantage of another chance unless he is forced to earn it. Now whether he succeeds or fails is up to him."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"You're giving Tom's holodeck time to US?" The disbelief was as much in B'Elanna's gaze as it was in her voice as she turned to look at Seven of Nine. The two women stared at each other and then turned in unison to look into the smiling face of Neelix. "It seemed only fair. It was his attempts to damage your engine that caused him to loose them." The two looked at each other again, the brows high on both their foreheads. Seven was the one to speak when they looked back once more. "Neither of us use the holodeck enough to compare to MISTER Paris." The accent on the lack of rank caused both to look, which got them a grin in response.</P>
<P>B'Elanna quietly said. "You have a mean streak." Seven simply continued to grin as B'Elanna continued to speak. "What we could use are Tom's replicator rations." Neelix looked down at his feet. "I was planning on using them for the party to celebrate Chakotay's successful use of the engine." Seven looked to B'Elanna and spoke. "Would they be able to use the holodeck time for the celebration?" B'Elanna smiled and nodded. "Yeah, that's it! Neelix use the holodeck time to program a party hall, musicians that sort of thing." Neelix smiled. "If you have any suggestions just let me know, but I will guarantee you will have a great time no matter what!"</P>
<P>As Neelix turned and left the pair to their meal Torres gently swatted Seven in the bicep. "Somebody is feeling vindictive." Seven shook her head. "It is one thing for Mr. Paris to have the feelings he did, but to endanger the many because of them is unacceptable." B'Elanna smirked. "Yes, but to control ones feelings because she is afraid of one person's response is just as unacceptable." Seven blushed and looked down at her plate. "Anger I could manage, rejection I could not." B'Elanna reached across the table and caressed Seven's cheek. "So much time wasted, so much to make up for." Seven's eyes shot back up as she shook her head. "It is my inability to express my emotions that caused the problem."</P>
<P>B'Elanna gently shook her head no. "If I had shown you an ounce of kindness you might have been more willing to express yourself. Though you have been getting better at expressing those emotions." Seven smiled shyly. "My latest teacher has been quite an efficient instructor." B'Elanna smiled and seemed ready to speak when Seven interrupted. "She has been a far better kisser then the Doctor." B'Elanna paused, then grinned at Seven and softly swatted her arm again. "See? Mean streak."</P>

<P>"Hope I didn't pull you away from anything important." Harry Kim ignored the jibe as he pulled a chair up to the biobed of Tom Paris. "No just finished something." Paris tried to look at his friend but was still restrained. "Oh? What?" "I finished making a decision." Both men took a breath as Paris spoke. "What was the decision?" "I'm still your friend. This is the worse thing you have ever done, but I don't hate you. I also came to another decision Tom, leave them alone. B'Elanna and Seven are happier then I have ever seen them and that INCLUDES when B'Elanna was with you. You try to hurt them again and I'll break your neck myself." Paris laughed at that, but Harry didn't. "I mean it Tom, leave them alone."</P>
<P>"I suppose I better, the rest of the crew will probably do more then Chakotay if I mess with them again." The voice of Voyager's former helmsman was heavy with bitterness and Harry slid his chair closer. "Tom, you've always been one to roll with the punches. Why can't you roll with this one?" Paris sighed. "Because I didn't give a damn before, I do now. It's not like when I tried to blow up the processing plant." Harry interrupted. "You didn't get to choose. You lost that power and you can stand that." "It's not that at all!" The last word came out a bit strangled but Harry was nodding as he stood up. "That's exactly it, you may have had to live with the consequences of your decisions, but when B'Elanna left you. You didn't have any say and you couldn't stand it."</P>
<P>Paris grumbled. "You mean when she left me for Seven." Harry shook his head when he sat back down. "She had feelings for Seven when she left you, but it was your proposing that got her to act on them." Paris continued to grumble. "Aren't you supposed to make someone feel better when you visit someone in sickbay?" "I may not be here to cheer you up, but I am trying to help you." The hands of Tom Paris were clenched on the top of the blanket covering him. "Yeah well thanks, but no thanks!" Harry stood up. "Earlier you told me that you finally had the idea. That you realized you had to give in life as well as take. Sometimes that giving means giving up and letting go. See you around Tom."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Chakotay felt the tension curling around in his belly like an angry serpent. He finally had something on his mind besides his crippling of a crewmember, but now he wondered if he was better off. The chime to his quarters sounded and he went to the door. As it opened B'Elanna Torres seemed startled that he came to greet her, but as she noticed the look on his face her relaxed expression mirrored his own glower. "You wanted to see me Chakotay?" Her former commanding officer nodded and motioned her to a chair. "Now that the engine is a success we are with in striking distance of making it home." B'Elanna smiled. "I can't think of much more."</P>
<P>Chakotay allowed himself a smile. "I think I know the one other thing you can think of." B'Elanna blushed as she continued smiling, but Chakotay's smile had vanished as if it were never there. "That is why I wanted to speak with you. I have already spoke to the captain, and with the Maquis no more we have a strong chance at a pardon, but even in the worse case scenario we would have light sentences at a minimum security facility." B'Elanna's expression darkened. "Sounds about right." He got up and moved next to B'Elanna where he sat on the edge of his desk. "I'm not worrying about us. Seven was Borg, and not only that she was almost born Borg. I can't see the Federation trying to arrest her for her activities as a drone the tactical knowledge that has saved us would be INVALUABLE to Starfleet."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's eyes had gotten wide and she seemed to have stopped breathing as she looked into the face of the first officer as he continued. "The problem is how they will go about getting it. With her distinguished service here on Voyager they may just ask her to be a tactical advisor, but in that worse case scenario they either openly, or covertly kidnap her. Either to wring her mind for every shred of tactical data, or for out and out dissection to see what the Collective would do with 18 years to perfect a drone." B'Elanna almost jumped out of her seat. "They wouldn't dare! That's something right out of the Cardassian handbook!" He stood with her hand placed his hands on her shoulders. "The Federation was willing to abandon us to Cardassia, and while I don't think they would unanimously decide to do that a handful of people with high enough rank might try to pull it off."</P>
<P>She sat down with a growl and Chakotay took his seat back on his desk. "Again, that is a worse case scenario, but we are preparing for it. The Captain thought it would help if Seven would be an official Federation citizen. While Annika Hansen was she had been declared dead with her parents after they were lost to the Collective." B'Elanna scrunched her nose. "Well she can just reclaim her citizenship. I mean if they try to grab her I doubt they will do it in the courts." "You would be surprised. The Captain and I went over precedent and found a case where the Federation was going to kill the sentient android Commander Data in order to take him apart so they could make more of him. Even if they don't a Federation family beyond the distant relatives could only help her status."</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded as Chakotay continued. "The Captain has said she would be more then willing to adopt her. Or as she put it "Seven has been like a daughter to me already and I would be happy to make if official." He then took another, far deeper breath. "There was another option however. While a girlfriend has no legal standing a wife would." B'Elanna literally stopped breathing and her eyes were almost all whites, which caused Chakotay's smile to return as he put a hand on her shoulder again. "There is another option B'Elanna. The Captain is ready to go ahead with the adoption, but I thought of you and the Captain and I agreed to ask you first. There is no rush yet, but when we get the edge Alpha Quadrant on long range sensors one of the options will have to be used. We have decided not to tell Seven yet so that she will only have to adjust to one decision or another, but the Captain asked me to tell you that the sooner you make a decision the easier it will be for Seven to adapt."</P>
<P>He then slipped from the desk to a crouch next to her chair. "It is not the best situation for starting a life together. Marriage should only be about love and if the Captain and I could not see how much you two love each other we would never suggest it." He grinned at her. "If we were not sure it would happen any way. all we are doing is pushing it ahead." She grinned back at him even as she shook her head in shock. He just continued to grin and patted her on the back as he stood up. She stood with him and they turned to look at each other as her spoke. "We know how much you two love each other, and this is going to be a big change in Seven's life no matter how it ends up, but we knew you would want to be a part either way." She nodded as she turned and walked form his quarters.</P>

<P>Alpha shift was in full swing, even the presence of a crew member recently promoted from Gamma shift at the helm didn't seem to dull the steady hum of activity flowing around Captain Janeway. Her first officer had been running late, but she knew why and his absence was easily covered. When her console showed her chief engineer had just logged into duty she knew her first officer would be there soon. Surely enough the turbolift soon opened and soon after Chakotay took his seat. "Any word?" He grinned at her. "Don't worry, you're not going to be a mother, not yet." Her body shook with a silent laugh. "Of course we know what that could mean."</P>
<P>He smiled. "Do you remember how?" She continued to smile. "Like riding a bicycle, though I'll probably be sure to brush up on it." The pair seemed to think of something and looked at the ops station. Ensign Kim held up his hands and shook his head. His look seemed rueful, but he seemed to understand that after the incident where Ensign Paris attempted to break into Cargo Bay 2 he suffered some guilt by association. The two leaders turned their gazes back to each other as Chakotay spoke. "It's still up in the air, but I think B'Elanna will "do the right thing." Janeway smiled, but her face looked confused. "What makes you say that? Especially after her previous reaction to a proposal." He shook his head. "She was proposed to, now she will be the one proposing. It's like we said. They are headed that way already. This is just a reason to do it early."</P>
<P>Her expression seemed dubious. "Yes, but couldn't that spoil the whole thing?" He seemed ready to answer, and then started at her. "I thought "I" was the one who played devil's advocate." "Turn about is fair play." They both laughed softly. "Still, I don't think the timing will play an issue. Seven has been in love with B'Elanna since she appeared on this ship in a green flash of transporter beam, and B'Elanna will ask, or she will not. She knows there is another option. So if she picks this one it is because she has decided it is time." Janeway nodded as she turned back to the starscape running across the viewscreen. "I agree with you."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Can I get something for you B'Elanna?" The mess hall kitchen's had become somewhat familiar to B'Elanna Torres so she had no problems weaving between stoves, and ovens and other kitchen items as she paced. Breakfast was over and lunch was just starting, but when B'Elanna came in lunch seemed to be the last thing on her mind. Seven had followed moments after but a whispered conversation had Seven leaving with a look of confusion on her face. She looked at the Talaxian, the two actually being eye to eye which was a unique experience for them. "I don't know, a ring?" He stared confusedly for several seconds then had a huge smile break across his face. "So you made up your mind? You are going to ask her?"</P>
<P>Her chest was heaving as she tried to control the emotions running roughshod over her. "I, I sorta have to ask her." Neelix stepped closer as he put down the utensils he was using to prepare the food and wiped his hands on a near by cloth. "Have to? Don't you want to marry Seven?" Her hands dropped to her side and her head hung. "I do, it's just that." Neelix stepped forward. "Then that's all that matters. B'Elanna, you love Seven, she loves you. You want to marry her, then marry her." He still held the cloth, but had stopped wiping his hands. As he continued to look at her he calmly folded the cloth. She continued to stare at him. "Simple as that?" He smiled. "Simple as that."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>B'Elanna Torres was afraid Tuvok might sprain his brow, but the Vulcan let it drop back to its place as he began to speak. "You want me to give you romantic advice?" She shook her head rapidly as she looked at him over the meditation table in his quarters. "No, no MARRIAGE advice. Neelix said you helped him tremendously when Neelix and Kes were considering a family. You are also one of the only married people I know of on the ship, and Seven values logic. So those three things together seemed to make you the best person to talk to." His brow arched as high as it did previously, but it relaxed right away. "Your reasoning is sound. Seven of Nine is obviously having a beneficial effect." Torres simply rolled her eyes as she waited for him to continue.</P>
<P>"While Seven of Nine possesses impeccable logic she also possesses emotions." While the last part sounded as if he was saying she had a terminal disease B'Elanna ignored it. "Since you are not already married I will assume you wish to know how to propose." Her expression darkened but showed no other signs of embarrassment. He took her lack of a response as a request to continue. "As I had said she is logical, but emotional. So any proposal should take that into account. For Seven of Nine sentiment will have far greater sway then show." She nodded her understanding as the Vulcan continued.</P>
<P>"As a member of the Collective she will still value unity so any sentiment should involve the both of you." While the Vulcan's are an emotionless species Torres decided they must have decided irritation didn't count as an emotion because Tuvok was showing large amounts of it. Keeping her smile internal she stood. "Thank you for your advice. I know Vulcan marriages are arranged, but your advice will be invaluable." As she turned to the door he spoke from behind her. "Prosperity on you and your union." She turned around and couldn't help but smile. "Thank you."</P>

<P>Seven arched her brow; it only accenting the confused expression on her face as the speckled face of Neelix grinned back at her. "Mr. Neelix. you seem more jovial then usual." "I am just in a jovial mood." He turned back to his preparation table, but Seven turned to follow his movements. "Mr. Neelix, what were you and B'Elanna speaking of earlier." He head jerked in surprise. "Well now Seven, what B'Elanna and I talk about is between B'Elanna and I." Her brow arched again, but her expression was her typical superior one. "Since B'Elanna sent me away it stands to reason it concerned me." Neelix continued to work on the food he was preparing. "Well if B'Elanna wanted you to know she would tell you."</P>
<P>She stepped closer and his shoulders tensed. "Just because she may not wish to tell me does not mean I should not know." Neelix nodded. "Yes, I suppose that might be right, but I trust B'Elanna enough to let her tell you at the right time." While her voice did not raise it took a hard tone, which had a similar effect. "Insufficient, you will tell me now." Neelix shook his head again and stepped around Seven to one of the refrigeration units. "No Seven, I won't. Have you tried asking B'Elanna?" Her eyes looked down and even with her perfect posture her shoulders seemed to slump. "I did, but she deferred the question and then attempted to use kissing to distract me."</P>
<P>Neelix chuckled at that as Seven continued to keep up with his movement through the kitchen. "It did not work, and neither will this." "This, this what?" Seven stopped and put her hands behind her back. "Tell me what you and B'Elanna were speaking of, now." He shook his head. "No." She lifted her chin up. "Comply." He shook his head. "No." The two locked eyes for a long moment and when their gaze broke Seven strode, or perhaps stormed from the mess hall.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Seven's angry stride carried her from the mess hall to sickbay. Upon entering she noticed she was alone. "Computer, activate the Emergency Medical Hologram." Voyager's holographic doctor flickered to life. "Please state the nature of the medical emergency. Ah, Hello Seven. What can I do for you?" Her voice was clipped and her expression clearly aggravated as she replied. "Have you spoken to Lieutenant Torres?" The Doctor smirked. "LIEUTENANT Torres? She must have done something wrong now." Her expression seemed to grow even more aggravated at the Doctor's jesting. "That is what I am attempting to find out. When did you speak with her last?" The Doctor got a thoughtful expression.</P>
<P>"I have not spoken to B'Elanna since she performed my maintenance several days ago. Several days late I might add, though I'm sure the new engine is keeping the two of you quite busy." Seven shook her head. "The engine would not require her to have a confidential conversation with Mr. Neelix." The eyes of the EMH seemed to light up. "A SECRET conversation?" Seven nodded absently as she mulled over the problem. The Doctor stepped forward and rested a hand on her elbow. "I don't know anything about it right now, but I might be able to help you find out." Her blue eyes were wide and inquiring. "How?" A smile was on the Doctor's face as he replied.</P>
<P>"We'll as the Chief Physician of Voyager many of the crew hold me in close confidence, and while I would never reveal any confidential details we also talk about various sundry things that most of the crew already knows about." Seven arched her brow at the Doctor. "You mean gossip." The smile immediately soured. "Yes, but it could be invaluable in finding out what secret B'Elanna is keeping." The former drone seemed dubious, but she nodded. Which brought the smile shooting back to the Doctor's face.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"Heads up." Chakotay couldn't help but look up at Janeway's warning, but when she smirked he knew he shouldn't have. When his eyes met the eyes of Seven of Nine he knew why. While he had grown fonder of young woman as of late the look on her face set off an internal alert. The way she strode from the turbolift to stand in front of the command chairs was her normal manner, as was the way she linked her hands behind her back. Her face was entirely business however, and Chakotay feared for whoever she was after, especially after he heard the next words from her mouth. "Commander Chakotay, I would like to talk to you." While Janeway kept her normal expression Chakotay detected a twinkle in her eye showed just how much amusement she was having at her second in command's expense.</P>
<P>"Is it important?" He hoped she would say no even as he knew she would say yes. "I must speak to you immediately." All hope of escape vanished as he stood up. Janeway was cheery and bright as she spoke. "Feel free to use my ready room." Both of them nodded, the Chakotay allowed a pained expression to slip through. Which cause Voyager's captain to smile even more. Seven entered the opening doors ahead of Chakotay, which allowed him to hear a comment by Ensign Kim as the doors shut. "Ready Room or Tomb?" The closing door cut off the answering laugh of Captain Janeway. As he turned back Seven was standing in front of him with her back ramrod straight and her hands linked behind her back,</P>
<P>"Commander Chakotay, have you spoken to B'Elanna Torres recently?" He bit his bottom lip and tried to stall. "Define recently." The implant arched. "If you are asking me to define recently you must have spoken to her." He hoped she didn't notice his wince, but the way her brow crept up further she must have yet she stood there like a sentinel, waiting for his response. His nod was both reluctant and slow. "Yes, she stopped by my quarters, actually I asked her to stop by." "Why did you ask her to stop by?" He shrugged his shoulders. "I wanted to talk to her about getting back to the Alpha Quadrant. She and I are still Maquis in the eyes of the Federation."</P>
<P>Seven nodded once. "As Maquis you may face arrest by the Federation." Chakotay nodded in turn. "It's a possibility, the captain assures me that it is a remote one, but I wanted to keep her up to date." "IS there anything I should be aware of?" Chakotay seemed to be relaxing, which caused a slightly concerned look on Seven's face. "I would suggest looking up B'Elanna's record and Federation legal procedure. Since we don't know what will happen it is all probabilities." Her posture seemed relaxed. "Commander Chakotay, I have noticed a steady drop in your body temperature since we started speaking." The commander seemed to consider her words and then smiled. "I'm just glad the conversation has been taken care of." Why would B'Elanna have kept this a secret from me?" The commander shrugged his shoulders and hoped the half-klingon would not hurt him too badly for getting Seven asking even more questions.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Neelix nearly jumped as the Doctor materialized behind him. He did keep enough of his senses to keep the item that had just materialized in the replicator against his body and out of the Doctor's line of sight. "Mr. Neelix! You're looking well." His confusion caused a light amount of stammering. "T.thank you Doctor." "What do you have there?" Neelix strode quickly from the replicator to his kitchen and shoved the item in question into a refrigerator. "Just preparing for the party." "Ahh yes, Our Coming Home Party. How go the preparations?" Detailing his work for the celebration seemed to brighten the Talaxian's mood.</P>
<P>"Things are going wonderfully, ever since Seven and B'Elanna donated all that holodeck time things have been falling into place. We are going to use both holodecks to replicate all of Starfleet academy. It seemed a bit pointless to me since we will seeing the real thing soon enough, but most seemed to want an early taste of home. An emotional appetizer if you will. I trust you will be joining us?" The Doctor smiled. "Have you ever known me to miss a party? I will also enjoy that taste of Earth, especially since the closest I came was the Utopia Plaentia yards. I'm going to have to thank Seven and B'Elanna. Have you seen them today?"</P>
<P>Neelix made a scoffing sound. "I've seen them both one right after another with about 30 minutes between visits. I could ask the captain to include the duties of ships counselor in my duties as morale officer." The Doctor held his hands up in a quieting motion. "So what were you counseling them on?" Neelix took a breath to speak and then stopped. "Sorry Doctor, counselor/patient privilege." The EMH rolled his eyes. "You said you SHOULD be ships counselor, not that you ARE." Neelix shook his head. "None the less. Now if you'll excuse me Doctor I really need to get back to work." The Doctor seemed ready to argue, but turned and left in a huff."</P>
<P>As the doors closed behind the Emergency Medical Hologram Neelix reached into the refrigerator and pulled out a black velvet box and opened it. Inside was a simple silver ring that reminded him of the metal of Seven's implants. It also had an engraving and while he could not read it he already knew what it said. The klingon word for "strength" was first followed by the Terran standard of English word "through". The engraving ended with the Borg symbol for "unity". He closed the box and put it in his pocket. Then he tapped his commbadge. "Neelix to Lieutenant Torres."</P>

<P>A rhythmic thudding greeted Harry Kim as the door opened. Tom Paris laid flat on his back in his quarters throwing a ball against the wall and catching it over and over. "I would think you would be studying?" Paris laughed gruffly. "I've gotten enough of that already. I wasn't out of sickbay five minutes before Tuvok was shoving PADD's under my nose. Even the Doc seemed to be reading his Federation protocols rather loudly." Harry shook his head and sat in the chair at Tom's workstation. "They're just trying to help you help yourself." Paris threw the ball harder. "Remind me to thank them later." Harry stood up abruptly and moved to stand in Tom's line of sight.</P>
<P>"Damn it Tom! You got yourself in this hole and they are trying to give you the tools to dig yourself out! Quit feeling sorry for yourself, shut up and buckle down!" Paris arched his eyebrows. "Wow Harry, wish I felt as much about this as you do." "Stop it! Don't act like you don't care. You've turned yourself around more then once. Now it's just a matter of stopping going in circles. So are you going to the party?" Paris laughed again. "I don't think so, The minute I stepped through those doors the crew would string me up and use me as a pi&ntilde;ata. Still. have fun Harry. Have a drink for me." Harry nodded and got up to leave. As the doors closed he heard the thumping stop and silence ensue.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>"The replicator logs have been erased." While many could have called Seven's tone neutral the EMH could hear the underlying disappointment. The two were meeting in the Doctor's office just off of sickbay and he leaned forward in his chair. "It's all right Seven. While we may not have any answers this does tell us we are on the right track." Seven arched her brow. "Clarify." The Doctor smiled. "If they had nothing to hide there would be no reason to erase the log, and unless they are replicating books of Federation law they are preparing from something else." Seven tilted her head. "Do you believe the Commander lied?" The EMH continued to smile. "No, no I'm sure he has spoken to B'Elanna about their Maquis status, but that doesn't mean that is ALL they talked about."</P>
<P>A worried expression crossed Seven's features, but the Doctor responded to it immediately. "I think we can safely say it is not a problem. While I wouldn't put it past B'Elanna to try to shield you the reactions of the crew seem all wrong. You said Neelix was resolute, Janeway was amused and Chakotay was nervous. All the while B'Elanna attempted to distract you?" Seven's normally calm expression had returned. "Correct." "I would say Neelix knows the secret and is determined to keep you from finding out, Chakotay is nervous about you finding out, and Captain Janeway knows, but does not play a direct part so she simply observes the confusion."</P>
<P>She mulled over his words then raised and lowered her brows. "There is also the fact Neelix attempted to defer me to B'Elanna." The Doctor nodded. "I think it is safe to assume it involves B'Elanna and yourself." He smirked. "I don't think she's pregnant. but she may be looking for more commitment." Seven seemed confused. "I am devoted to B'Elanna." The Doctor smiled. "Yes, but humans like grand gestures to demonstrate it." Seven's voice was very soft. "Like when Tom Paris proposed to B'Elanna." The Doctor put a hand on her shoulder. "Not exactly. His gesture was staking a claim to B'Elanna. He assumed her response was a forgone conclusion. Marriage is supposed to be laying your heart bare and HOPING they accept it."</P>
<P>The smoothes tones of Seven's voice were dry. "That would be messy, and fatal." The Doctor gave Seven an exasperated expression. "Funny. It seems a little early for marriage, but I could see her asking you to move in with her." Seven's confusion seemed genuinely confused as she spoke. "I would still need to regenerate." The Doctor smiled. "We'll work on that." She smiled in turn, even though she seemed uncomfortable doing so. "There is still the matter of the replicated item." The Doctor shook his head. "Probably just some gift to go with the occasion." Seven didn't seem convinced, but the Doctor misinterpreted her uncertain expression.</P>
<P>"Don't worry Seven, you already have places to store personal possessions in the alcoves. We can just find a special place to set aside for gifts from B'Elanna. Unless of course you get a whole new place to start storing things." The last part was said with a smirk, but when the confused look on Seven's face remained the Doctor grew concerned. "You don't have to worry Seven. I'll help you pick out any gift you want to get for B'Elanna. By the time we're finished her head will be spinning." At her stare her rolled his eyes. "Not literally, we will be amazed by the romance you'll be showing her." "That is not my concern. I wonder if B'Elanna is uncertain of the idea of further commitment."</P>
<P>At that point the Doctor leaned forward enough to rest his weight against the desk. "Don't be Seven. Look at how long she put up with Paris, and he treated her horrendously. You ADORE her and she loves you more then she ever did him. If she is waiting, it is only for the perfect time." Seven arched her brow. "As you said she and I love each other. What time would be better then the present? The Doctor shrugged, over dinner, during shore leave. at the party!" The seemed to move back from the exclamation but the Doctor made a calming motion with his hand. "No, it's perfect. The party celebrating the engine the two of you made. It couldn't be more perfect."</P>
<P>Seven looked skeptical. "Perfect? Melodrama is irrelevant." The Doctor laughed. "Far from it. Those special points in our lives will be in our memories forever, and it only makes sense to make them as special as possible." The skeptical expression stayed in place. "You are a hologram, your memories of every event will remain unchanged unless you suffer damage to your program." The hologram shuffled uncomfortably in his seat as she continued. "My cortical implant performs a similar function." The Doctor grimaced. "Remind me to give you a lesson in sentiment, but remember Seven. You are not the only one involved here. The fact she is going to such trouble to make it special for you is a sign of just how much she cares."</P>
<P>Blue eyes opened wide. "I understand." The Doctor smiled fondly. "Exactly, just be sure to act surprised." Seven tilted her head. "Since I do not know the nature of B'Elanna's surprise I will be surprised. I just know that it is not an unpleasant one." The Doctor smiled. "No, it seems highly unlikely." Seven seemed to pout. "I still wish to know the nature of the surprise." The Doctor smiled once more. "That is that nature of surprises."</P>

<P>Chakotay was biting the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. While he was glad B'Elanna had declined to hurt him for getting Seven asking more questions he knew she would rethink that if he laughed at her current condition. "I'm gonna be sick, I'm gonna be sick, I'm gonna be sick." He pulled B'Elanna over by one of the mess halls view ports. "You are not going to be sick. You are going to wait here until Seven steps through those doors. You are then going to get on one knee in front of her and proclaim your love. Then in front of your family here on Voyager you are going to ask her to be your wife." Her normally dark complexion was several shades paler as she stared blankly at Chakotay. He allowed himself a slight laugh at that point.</P>
<P>"Just remember your name, and hers and you'll be fine." The doors opened and while his back was to the doors he could tell who entered just by the way a look of panic combined with longing on her face. She took a step forward and Chakotay put a hand on her elbow. She gave him a wan smile. "Enough waiting, I'm ready." The cool features of Seven of Nine noticeably lit up as she laid eyes on Lieutenant Torres. "B'Elanna." She then noticed the pale features and accelerated heartbeat and looked like she was about to ask B'Elanna the cause when Torres spoke.</P>
<P>"Seven, could you sit down?" "I prefer to stand." Torres put a gentle hand on Seven's elbow to lead her to a chair. "I know, but I need you to sit down." Seven looked confused but sat down. Her face was both innocent and questioning as B'Elanna dropped to one knee in front of her. The rest of the room went from pleasant party to the quiet of the tomb. As Torres licked her lips Seven continued to look at her curiously. "Seven?" Torres paused and took a deep breath. "Seven of Nine, this party is a celebration of what we were able to do together. I think it is just the beginning." She bit her lips and seemed to swallow from her suddenly dry mouth. "Seven of Nine, together we can do anything, including a life together. Will you marry me?"</P>
<P>Blue eyes went wider then they had ever been before as heartbeats stretched into infinity. Seven's heartbeat seemed to stop as she ceased to breathe. As her cybernetic systems seemed to give her a kick back to reality she saw the look of terror that was forming on the face of B'Elanna Torres. With out thinking she slipped from the chair and nodded as she pulled B'Elanna Torres to her. Their lips met and pressed firmly together, B'Elanna seemed stunned this time so Seven took the lead as she slipped her tongue into B'Elanna's mouth. A sob escaped her mouth even as it pressed against Seven of Nine's while her tongue ceased dancing with Seven's they shared several smaller kisses. A chrome wrapped hand reached up to wipe away the tears running down B'Elanna's cheeks. "Can I take that as a yes?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled. "Yes." The cheer that resounded around the room reminded the women that there were others there with them and when they looked from the embrace they shared they blushed deeply. The cheer then turned into a laugh. B'Elanna suddenly made a body jerk. "The ring!" She dug into a pocket and pulled out the black velvet case. Pulling the silver circle out she gently took Seven's fully human hand and slid it on. Both women smiled and shared another kiss. This time both women's tongues seemed to be battling. It was Neelix putting his hand on B'Elanna shoulder that broke the kiss and caused the women to look around and see the crew grinning at them.</P>
<P>The two women were blushing again as they rose to their feet. Commander Chakotay then raised his glass in a silent toast. The women smiled bashfully as well-wishers began to step forward, but B'Elanna saw Seven's discomfort at the press of humanity. Seeing that she pulled Seven to the kitchens and Neelix helped by shooing the crew away. The two wrapped their arms around each other as they snuggled close in one of the father back corners of the kitchen. B'Elanna reached up and caressed Seven's cheek. "You ok? Any second thoughts?" Seven's head jerked up right. "No." It then softened. "No second thoughts. I am just overwhelmed."</P>
<P>B'Elanna rested her forehead to Seven cheek for several breaths, and then looked back up into her eyes. "Chakotay and I were talking about our return to the Alpha Quadrant, and while he said a lot the main thing was he got me thinking about the future. What I realized was I do not know what will happen, or even what I want to happen. The only thing I do know is that I want you with me." Seven's voice was the tenderest of whispers. "I was with you the moment I met you, and I always will be. Now it will be as your wife."</P>
