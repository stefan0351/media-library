<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 6 - Conclude -->

<p>"Chakotay to Seven of Nine." Without looking up from her console in astrometrics Seven tapped her commbadge to reply. "Seven of Nine here." The disembodied voice of the ships second in command came from the small insignia on her chest. "Are you available to meet with me in my quarters?" Seven found herself considering silently, but while she was not a direct part of the chain of command it was essential for her collective's function, and even with her position undefined Commander Chakotay held a position above hers."</p>

		<p>Received commander, I am on my way." Keying a few last calculations she closed down her console and stepped from astrometrics. Her long legs carried her to the turbolift doors, but along the way she felt the gazes of the crew, but they were not familiar. They were different somehow, much more speculative then hostile, and she found it strangely comforting.</p>

		<p>Yet they were as confusing as always, and she made a mental note to ask B'Elanna for an explanation on their next date. "Date" Seven found herself clamping down on the broad smile that threatened to encompass her face at the thought, or the memory. She and B'Elanna had met after their shifts had ended, the day that Seven of Nine and B'Elanna Torres proclaimed their feelings for each other. Seven had recommended the Ktarian moonrise because she had heard it was beautiful.</p>

		<p>For some reason Lieutenant Torres found that funny, yet touching, and smiled as she accepted. The memory caused a now familiar tension in Seven's body, and while she found it oddly welcomed she knew only B'Elanna's presence seemed to satisfy it, even as it would sometimes intensify it. She used the short ride in the turbolift to collect herself. It was an odd phenomenon, but letting her mind wander to the fiery woman who had become such an important part of her existence would help her bring her emotions back under control. Almost as if she was making a promise to her more emotional self if it would just allow her intellect to regain control.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna found that even if Seven was making her take a closer look at her emotions, her temper was still there, and as strong as always as she shifted around her superiors quarters. The relationship between her and Chakotay had always been a friendly one; the two of them sharing a close tie ever since their time in the Maquis. It was that tie that allowed her to read Chakotay the second he stepped through the doors of engineering. While she could tell he was about to do something he didn't want to, B'Elanna wasn't too worried, it was not the first, and would probably not be the last lecture she would receive, but when he called Seven to join them B'Elanna got worried. Of course when B'Elanna got worried, she got angry.</p>

		<p>As Seven stepped into the commander's quarters the women locked eyes, and while B'Elanna let her eyes soften to comfort the former drone her face stayed locked in an angry glare. A glare that turned on Chakotay as B'Elanna turned to face the man, placing herself slightly in front of Seven. As if to shield her from the lecture to come. Seven seemed a bit confused, but didn't seem to object to B'Elanna's closeness, and seemed warmed by the way B'Elanna was automatically moving to protect her.</p>

		<p>The gesture had not seemed lost on Chakotay, and he actually seemed to be regretting what he had to say all the more. "Ladies, the captain asked me to speak with you because she felt it would sound the best from me." He gave B'Elanna a direct look as he continued. "She felt that her actions to a similar incident while under the influence of the alien's experimentation were far harsher then they need be." B'Elanna's attention was diverted between both of the occupants of the room as she heard Seven start to speak. "You mean advising her and Mr. Paris to be more discrete."</p>

		<p>It was a statement instead of a question, and B'Elanna realized it hurt Seven to say it. Long talks between the women had left Torres know that Seven feared being alone, and it was something more then just being severed from the Collective. Even when she was Annika she had been alone, her parents too busy, giving over their human hearts to the Collective long before the Collective claimed their bodies. It was that which caused Seven to desire the Collective even after she had been severed from its grasp. She could not take being alone, and even though Torres would never promise Seven what she could not deliver she found that she could not, and would not, leave Seven alone again.</p>

		<p>Chakotay's expression was questioning and Seven felt the need to clarify. "Mr. Paris had mentioned the event in an earlier conversation, but I feel I should express the only time the lieutenant was openly affectionate in the view of others was in the corridor outside of my quarters. I was the one who tried to initiate copulation inside her office." As startled gasp caused her to look at Lt. Torres where she saw B'Elanna's face was turning a rather deep shade of red, while turning back to the commander it was apparent he was attempting to hide his amusement. Finally successful he was still smiling as he spoke. "Wait, your quarters?"</p>

		<p>Seven was genuinely confused as she replied to the commander. "Cargo bay 2." She felt warm fingers lightly brush her elbow as B'Elanna softly spoke to her. "That's a public area, it's not really quarters because it is not private." Seven looked at the lieutenant, then back at the commander. "Then I have yet to be assigned quarters. B'Elanna's would be acceptable." Chakotay's grin was in full force as the once deep red drained away to pale. "That should take care of it perfectly, you'll both be able to keep an eye on each other, and will be able to? be as affectionate as you care to."</p>

		<p>Seven felt remarkably pleased with herself as Chakotay dismissed them. Though as she was reaching the doors she noticed B'Elanna was still standing in the same spot, seeming to stare into space. Something that the commander seemed to find quite amusing. "B'Elanna, your dismissed." Lt. Torres seemed to throw Chakotay a pained look as she turned slowly and staggered towards Seven, and the doors.</p>

		<p>As they stepped into the passageway Seven guided B'Elanna to the side. "B'Elanna, are you ill?" B'Elannas breathing started to calm as she replied. "Well, no." Seven paused a moment. "Do you object to sharing quarters with me?" "Well, no." Seven smiled, and then put her arm around the smaller woman's waist. "Let's go to your quarters and make preparations."</p>
