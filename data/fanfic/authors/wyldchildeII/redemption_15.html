<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 15 - The Conclusion -->

<P>Chakotay was biting the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. While he was glad B'Elanna had declined to hurt him for getting Seven asking more questions he knew she would rethink that if he laughed at her current condition. "I'm gonna be sick, I'm gonna be sick, I'm gonna be sick." He pulled B'Elanna over by one of the mess halls view ports. "You are not going to be sick. You are going to wait here until Seven steps through those doors. You are then going to get on one knee in front of her and proclaim your love. Then in front of your family here on Voyager you are going to ask her to be your wife." Her normally dark complexion was several shades paler as she stared blankly at Chakotay. He allowed himself a slight laugh at that point.</P>
<P>"Just remember your name, and hers and you'll be fine." The doors opened and while his back was to the doors he could tell who entered just by the way a look of panic combined with longing on her face. She took a step forward and Chakotay put a hand on her elbow. She gave him a wan smile. "Enough waiting, I'm ready." The cool features of Seven of Nine noticeably lit up as she laid eyes on Lieutenant Torres. "B'Elanna." She then noticed the pale features and accelerated heartbeat and looked like she was about to ask B'Elanna the cause when Torres spoke.</P>
<P>"Seven, could you sit down?" "I prefer to stand." Torres put a gentle hand on Seven's elbow to lead her to a chair. "I know, but I need you to sit down." Seven looked confused but sat down. Her face was both innocent and questioning as B'Elanna dropped to one knee in front of her. The rest of the room went from pleasant party to the quiet of the tomb. As Torres licked her lips Seven continued to look at her curiously. "Seven?" Torres paused and took a deep breath. "Seven of Nine, this party is a celebration of what we were able to do together. I think it is just the beginning." She bit her lips and seemed to swallow from her suddenly dry mouth. "Seven of Nine, together we can do anything, including a life together. Will you marry me?"</P>
<P>Blue eyes went wider then they had ever been before as heartbeats stretched into infinity. Seven's heartbeat seemed to stop as she ceased to breathe. As her cybernetic systems seemed to give her a kick back to reality she saw the look of terror that was forming on the face of B'Elanna Torres. With out thinking she slipped from the chair and nodded as she pulled B'Elanna Torres to her. Their lips met and pressed firmly together, B'Elanna seemed stunned this time so Seven took the lead as she slipped her tongue into B'Elanna's mouth. A sob escaped her mouth even as it pressed against Seven of Nine's while her tongue ceased dancing with Seven's they shared several smaller kisses. A chrome wrapped hand reached up to wipe away the tears running down B'Elanna's cheeks. "Can I take that as a yes?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled. "Yes." The cheer that resounded around the room reminded the women that there were others there with them and when they looked from the embrace they shared they blushed deeply. The cheer then turned into a laugh. B'Elanna suddenly made a body jerk. "The ring!" She dug into a pocket and pulled out the black velvet case. Pulling the silver circle out she gently took Seven's fully human hand and slid it on. Both women smiled and shared another kiss. This time both women's tongues seemed to be battling. It was Neelix putting his hand on B'Elanna shoulder that broke the kiss and caused the women to look around and see the crew grinning at them.</P>
<P>The two women were blushing again as they rose to their feet. Commander Chakotay then raised his glass in a silent toast. The women smiled bashfully as well-wishers began to step forward, but B'Elanna saw Seven's discomfort at the press of humanity. Seeing that she pulled Seven to the kitchens and Neelix helped by shooing the crew away. The two wrapped their arms around each other as they snuggled close in one of the father back corners of the kitchen. B'Elanna reached up and caressed Seven's cheek. "You ok? Any second thoughts?" Seven's head jerked up right. "No." It then softened. "No second thoughts. I am just overwhelmed."</P>
<P>B'Elanna rested her forehead to Seven cheek for several breaths, and then looked back up into her eyes. "Chakotay and I were talking about our return to the Alpha Quadrant, and while he said a lot the main thing was he got me thinking about the future. What I realized was I do not know what will happen, or even what I want to happen. The only thing I do know is that I want you with me." Seven's voice was the tenderest of whispers. "I was with you the moment I met you, and I always will be. Now it will be as your wife."</P>
