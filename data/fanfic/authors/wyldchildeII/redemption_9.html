<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 9 -->

<P>B'Elanna ran her forearm across her forehead. The slick feeling of the sweat gathered there finally getting to her. Of course it just mingled with the sweat already dotting her arms, but they were far to active for her to notice that. The work had already made her muscles burn as well as making her body sweat. A bead ran from under her ear and down the side of her neck. The sensation caused her to turn her head and she caught sight of Seven. "Didn't she ever sweat?" As the thought echoed her more reasonable side reminded her that the biosuit took care of maintaining her body temperature. Yet as she looked she saw something more in those beautiful blue eyes.</P>
<P>She had grown used to the feeling of Seven watching her, and had actually grown to like the feeling, but this time it was not the tender expression watching her. Seven's eyes seemed narrowed, and her breathing seemed heavy. Seven of Nine, former Tertiary adjunct to Unimatrix 01 was turned on. B'Elanna Torres, stripped down to her under tunic, sweating and panting with exertion was turning her on. Suddenly she had an idea of how she could make the former drone break a sweat, and the images caused a wicked grin to appear on her face. "B'Elanna?" The words broke through to her and she looked at the concerned expression on the porcelain features.</P>
<P>"Yes?" "You were smiling?" B'Elanna's grin softened into a smile. "You have that effect on me." The fair face turned a soft pink as B'Elanna smiled as a wicked idea entered her mind. She forced the grin to the smallest of smiles as she went back to work, but this time it was different. She stretched far more, and if she exhaled she made it deeper and louder. When she had to pass near Seven she made sure she passed as near as possible. When she was so close she noticed the way Seven's nostrils flared and her chest heaved ever so slightly, the muscles under the under the biosuit taut with more then the exertion of modifying the shuttlecraft.</P>
<P>"Seven? Are you ok?" A more experienced observer would say that B'Elanna sounded far too innocent, but even if Seven had the necessary emotional experience she seemed far too distracted to notice. "I apologize B'Elanna. I am feeling distracted." B'Elanna stepped close. "Really, what's distracting you?" It was at that point Seven seemed to catch on as she looked deeply into B'Elanna's eyes. Her brow arched as she stepped close to B'Elanna as well. "I find I am distracted by the functioning of your muscles." B'Elanna smiled as Seven's hands slid up her back softly massaging said muscles. "Are they performing efficiently? The former Borg's voice was little more then a whisper. "They are a most efficient design."</P>
<P>The desire B'Elanna Torres heard made her bite her bottom lip as her knees seemed to buckle, but she didn't fall because Seven tightened her grip and held B'Elanna to her. The feel of Seven's body against her own was heavenly even if the only skin she had touched had been on Seven's face and hands. What left her confused was the fact that no matter how aroused she was she didn't want to touch any more of Seven's skin, not yet. It was not that she didn't want to. It was that she knew there was a time and that time had not arrived yet. Relationships like that had been few and far between for B'Elanna Torres and she wasn't about to let hormones mess things up.</P>
<P>Seven seemed to feel the same as she eased her hold when B'Elanna found her feet once more. Both women just stared at each other, their eyes saying more then any words ever could. Just as silently they turned back to work, B'Elanna the first to speak in the period after. "If this works we will be home in under two years." When Seven didn't respond B'Elanna stared at her back for a long moment. "Seven? Don't you want to get back to Earth?" Shoulders seemed to slump as Seven replied. "I have been away from Earth over three quarters of my life. The majority of my recollections are from the Collective and to them Earth was simply a highly resistant planet." Torres walked over to where Seven was working. "Those are their memories, not yours. When we get back we will make some for you." The responding smile was shy, but sure.</P>

<P>"So, do you think they've slept together yet?" Harry Kim shook his head and continued to eat his meal. "That's none of my business Tom." Tom Paris didn't quite look up from his meal as much as he raised his mouth father from the plate. "Why not, you've been the one who had the inside track ever since the get go? I'm just curious about how they are doing." The look Harry shot over his plate was blatantly suspicious, and Paris caught it. "Harry, I just want to see B'Elanna happy, I swear." The operations officer did not seem at all convinced, but he nodded none the less as Paris continued to speak. "I mean my life is going to be in their hands when I test out this new engine design. I think we all remember what happened with the last one."</P>
<P>Harry then spoke. "I'm sure Captain Janeway remembers the most of all, but just remember you're not testing it alone." The Tom Paris charm seemed to be working overtime as he spoke again. "I'm looking forward to it. With everything I was going to have to keep watch on a second set of eyes will make things a lot easier. Come on Harry, don't you trust me?" He seemed genuinely regretful. "I want to, I just know you have either acted more mature than you have the entire time I've know you, or you're up to something." Paris actually grinned at that. "So you automatically assume I'm up to something? Isn't it possible I just grew up?"</P>
<P>Harry smiled to, but not as enthusiastically as his friend. "Well you've known Tom Paris longer then I have." Tom Paris nodded. "No, no, I see what you are saying. There was a time I would have been obsessed with winning B'Elanna back, but I am honest when I say I've grown up. I'm going to see her happy." Harry looked at his friend for an eternity. "Maybe, but I can't help but notice you can't seem to refer to Seven of Nine by name."</P>

<P>The crew of Voyager was not a large one by most standards, but when every crewmember not on duty seemed intent on getting into a shuttle bay the crew seemed far larger, but Captain Janeway could not really blame them. They had a way home, one that did not rely on alien technologies, or other species, one that they had come up with all on their own, after a fashion. Janeway stepped forward, but her mood was far darker then the reset of the crews, and they seemed to notice it right away. A more sobered gathering stared back at their Captain. "We are gathered here today to take our next big step home, but before we take that step we need to take a moment to thank those who made it possible."</P>
<P>Near the shuttle B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine looked at each other, thanking the crew silently for all they made possible. &gt;From the central position Janeway spoke again. "They were sampled from our DNA, but more then that they were sampled from our memories. They wanted to get home just as badly as we do, and I think the best tribute to them will be when we pull into Earth orbit." The crew broke into applause as the captain fell silent. The crowd then parted as Tom Paris entered the shuttle bay. They split before him to allow him to make his way to the shuttle.</P>
<P>When he got to the shuttle he threw a boyish smile at the two women. "I guess Chakotay's running late." A voice with in the shuttle contradicted him. "On the contrary Paris, I've already been here an hour and a half." B'Elanna's smile seemed slightly forced as she made a gesture into the opened shuttles door, and surely enough there was Voyager's first officer in the copilot position familiarizing himself with the controls. Paris shrugged and moved to the pilot's chair. "What's a matter Chakotay? Has it been too long since you've flown one of these things?" Both men had their eyes locked on their consoles as Chakotay replied. "Considering it's an experimental design? Yes."</P>
<P>Paris laughed and shook his head. "Don't worry. I've got it all under control. We leave the shuttle bay, do a little light year loop, and then land back in the shuttle bay. No problem." Chakotay didn't look convinced. "Well then it should be done quickly." Paris nodded, and seemed distracted as he slipped into his piloting mode. "And there's no time like the present. Preparing for take off." A cheer came from the bay outside as the men ran through the take off sequence and the shuttle rose from the deck. There was a slight flicker as the ship passed through the force field that separated the bay from the void of space. The gathered crowd watched breathlessly as the ship moved away from Voyager, and then vanished to the pin prick of light left behind as a ship goes to warp.</P>
