<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 6 -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway knew that she didn't know what was going on, but she did realize there was something. It would be difficult not to with a bleary eyed Chakotay entering with an off duty Seven of Nine. She had been shocked when the order had come in, but when she learned that she was waiting for B'Elanna she assumed that the women were hopefully going to conference on the improved warp engines. Though she wondered it B'Elanna was up to it. While she would never begrudge any of her people the right to pair off, or get engaged Tom Paris had picked a time when they were closer to a way home then ever before, and quite possibly delayed their return with his impulsiveness.</P>
<P>Still, the rumor mill was already saying the women had managed to establish a peace, and if Seven was willing to wait for B'Elanna instead of demanding her presence Janeway was inclined to believe it. Then air that had been tense became electrified with something as simple as the opening of the conference room door. Standing there just on the threshold was her chief engineer B'Elanna Torres, behind her was the Talaxian morale officer Neelix. He seemed to be barricading the doorway because the woman's body language betrayed an intense desire to flee. Then as she looked into the face of the Lieutenant she saw that desire had left and her eyes had locked to a fixed point. Turning her head she saw that fixed point was staring back.</P>
<P>The urge to emit a long low whistle was quickly retrained, but none the less she realized the romantic staple had happened. Their eyes really did meet across a crowded room. It was at that point Janeway realized they had established more then a peace. The gaze of her first officer seemed to be taking in the scene as intently as she, and to be honest the rest of the room was, but when she locked eyes with him he smiled, shrugged and failed to look innocent. Her actual track of time had been lost as the air crackling between the women seemed to draw the rest out of the room, but her morale officer managed to bring things back to order when he walked over and took Seven's elbow to gently guide her to her feet. Using that hand he led her over to B'Elanna Torres and took her elbow in his free hand.</P>
<P>"All right now, you two have the day off go enjoy it. I am sure you can find plenty of things to talk about." Both women shot Neelix a glare as he led them to the door and shooed them out. Returning to his seat he smiled at Voyager's commanding officer. "Shall we get started?" While most in the room looked confused both Neelix and Chakotay had expressions that were far too smug for Janeway's liking, and she vowed that she would grill them for every piece of information they possessed. Her expression must have said as much because both men now had expressions that were far more humble, and far more to Janeway's liking.</P>

<P>"Seven." B'Elanna?" "I thought you didn't work today." "I don't." "Why were you there?" "I was waiting for you. Why did you come to the conference room? You are off duty as well." Torres prayed that the emotional tones she was hearing from Seven were more then her deluding herself, but either way they caused her voice to deepen with passion. "I wanted to talk with you." For the first time she saw eyes that she had declared dead with out ever looking into them. With out thinking her hand started to raise and just as reflexively Seven seemed to step forward into the touch. They both seemed to realize where they were and pulled back. "My quarters?" "Yes, I believe mine would be, unsuitable."</P>
<P>The idea of Cargo Bay 2 being anyone's quarters caused B'Elanna's brow to furrow, but as they stepped into the turbolift she saw Seven shiver. All thoughts came to the present, to the moment. The biosuit regulated her body temperature so she ruled that out as a cause for the shivering. Eyes went wide as she realized this would be Seven's first time, those eyes scrunched together just as quickly as she chastised herself. That was getting way too far ahead of herself, but she couldn't help it. While they both had their eyes forward as B'Elanna croaked out the deck she focused on Seven's lips, and imagined what it would be like to kiss them.</P>
<P>"How are you functioning Lieutenant?" "What?" Seven of Nine had turned to face her companion and it put the well-developed body far closer then she was comfortable with. "Oh, I'm ok." The all to familiar eyebrow arch startled B'Elanna. "Ok?" Yet this time she looked deeper, she saw the muscles firmly clenched the body almost ready to try to flee the turbolift. That idea hurt her that she could want to run away from her. The next words seemed to pour straight from her mouth to her lips. "Oh Seven, I've hurt you so much." The cool, confident exterior shattered leaving the confused, vulnerable woman underneath who didn't resist as B'Elanna stepped forward. Strong, lean arms wrapped around her as the warm, firm body pressed close.</P>
<P>The forehead ridges that could fascinate her endlessly nestled close to her bosom as one of those hands slid up her back to the base of her skull. An eternity passed as she felt herself being pulled down, drawn down into smoldering brown eyes. Half way those eyes rose to meet her and lips pressed on her own. She gasped at the contact and B'Elanna seemed to take that as her cue. A nimble tongue invaded her mouth, skated along Seven's teeth, and pressed against her own tongue. The kiss broke as they heard the turbolift doors open, and when no one was there to see the doors open they held their embrace several moments longer. Even as they stepped from the turbolift the distance between their bodies seemed more a formality.</P>
<P>As she led the way to her quarters B'Elanna could feel Seven's eyes on her, it was starting to become familiar, and it was not at all unpleasant. After they stepped through the doors B'Elanna turned and saw the multitude of questions written all over Seven's face. Wordlessly she reached up and cupped and alabaster cheek, laying her index finger over pale rose colored lips. Breaking the contact she turned to her console and beckoned Seven a chair. When she sat, knees firmly together posture perfect B'Elanna whispered to the ear right above the starburst implant. "I'm sorry, I didn't know, I never realized. Until now."</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Seven's face seemed to be hovering between its cold mask, and a need that was all too new to her. "So my double's words influenced you to not marry Ensign Paris?" B'Elanna could see the hurt trying to surface in the young woman's eyes. "No, the fact someone could love me, I mean really love me with out any strings attached. Well it told me that I could do better then Tom, and when I realized that Seven had your memories. I looked, I mean I really looked at you. I saw." She then proceeded to get down on one knee in front of the sitting Seven. "Oh Seven, I saw what I had been missing, I saw what I had needed all along."</P>
<P>Torres seemed on the verge of tears and with out a word she reached down and ran the pad of her human hand's thumb under B'Elanna's left eye. Her hand stayed there, caressing the caramel cheek and B'Elanna's eyes closed as she leaned into the touch. With her eyes closed she did not see Seven lean in, or her lips part. She only realized it as warm lips pressed against her own, and this time Seven's tongue sought entry, which B'Elanna quickly gave. Seven drank deep, it was almost like assimilation, but instead of simply taking, it was given, and Seven gave in turn. Taking some of the distinctiveness that was B'Elanna Torres and replacing it with a piece of herself.</P>
<P>The kiss broke, but their lips hovered near one another as Seven's lips began to speak in nothing more then a whisper. "You need to rest, and I need to regenerate." For an eternity B'Elanna just stared at her, the expression making Seven feel adored, almost worshiped. She reluctantly came to her feet and B'Elanna rose with her. Neither woman seeming ready to speak. B'Elanna looked into her eyes and seemed ready to grab hold of Seven and refuse to let go and Seven finally understood. She pulled the smaller woman close, cradled in her arms. "You have me Lieutenant Torres, and I have you. That will not change" She smiled at the woman in her arms. "You know how I am when I set my mind to something."</P>
<P>Seven was squeezed tighter, but when it finally broke and B'Elanna looked up Seven could see she was smiling. Then a familiar gleam came into her eyes; it was one Seven recognized from when the engineer would have a moment of inspiration. B'Elanna quickly disentangled from Seven's arms, which left Seven acutely aware of her bodies absence. B'Elanna then turned to the bed and tore off the bedding, she then balled it all up into a mass that she was able to carry and turned back to Seven. "Ok, I'm ready, let's go to Cargo Bay 2." Seven arched her brow as a quizzical grin covered her face. B'Elanna got a grin herself as she answered. "You'll regenerate in your alcove, and I'll sleep on the floor. It wouldn't be the first time I've had to sleep on deck plating."</P>
<P>"This is not a Maquis ship." B'Elanna was carrying the mass of bedding in one hand as she pushed Seven towards the doors with the other. "I'll be fine." "You'll be sore." Seven didn't bother turning around but B'Elanna could see enough to know the woman was smiling. There were several crewmembers passing by on their way from the turbolift but each time the women stared them down in unison before continuing on their way. Once they entered Cargo Bay 2 Seven turned and entered commands into the door panel. "This room is sealed." B'Elanna turned and raked her eyes over Seven in an unabashed appraisal. "Alone at least." The ex-drone's eyes were wide. "Like I said, I believe my quarters will be unsuitable." She paused, continuing to enjoy being able to examine the woman openly, and then she grinned.</P>
<P>"I know, I'm just teasing." She then stepped forward and gave Seven a gentle kiss. "If you want me to be your first I promise you it will be someplace much more special then the floor of a cargo bay." Seven's expression was open, unguarded. "I want you to be my first." B'Elanna pulled Seven into a tender embrace, which lasted several minutes. Only to be parted as she guided Seven to her alcove. "There is no need for you to be uncomfortable. I can come to you as soon as I finish my regeneration cycle." B'Elanna shook her head as she walked over to examine the controls. "I would rather sleep on the floor with you, then in a bed with out you."</P>

<P>Neelix and Chakotay slumped in their seats, and if the truth were known Janeway wanted to as well, but she forced herself to sit upright behind her desk. She now knew everything the two men did which ended up a surprise because they did not know about the others involvement until they were both called into her office. She sensed Neelix was still hiding details about B'Elanna's feelings for Seven, but he admitted they were there and Chakotay confirmed that Seven had the same feelings for B'Elanna. She pinched the bridge of her nose.</P>
<P>Janeway knew that her next letter home would have to include an immense apology to her mother because right now she had two of her own "daughters". locked in Cargo Bay 2! The groan that wanted to escape her lips didn't, but it must have registered on her face because both men were looking at her questioningly. Turning her console to face them the note from Tuvok detailing how Cargo Bay 2 was now sealed with Borg algorithms. The men grinned, then looked at each other and ginned even more. Neelix was the first to speak to Janeway's aggravated features. "Captain, they are both adults and in the privacy of Seven's quarters. I see no harm in it."</P>
<P>Janeway arched her brows. "Then I am sure the two of you will be happy to make sure it doesn't impact ships function." They both seemed aghast as they looked at the captain. "Gentleman, I do agree they will make a lovely couple and would never dream of interfering with that. I also know that one has next to no experience with her emotions and the other has next to no experience controlling her emotions. When you add the fact they both occupy important positions on this ship. well I am sure you can see why I am concerned. They may end up working together beautifully, or their old arguments may turn into lover's spats that shake the whole ship. Either way I am leaving it up to you as the first officer and ships morale officer to take care of. Dismissed."</P>
<P>The expressions as they rose and the way they walked looked like men on their way to the gallows. As they stepped from the Captain's Ready room they looked out on the bridge and the most noticeable thing was the shocked expression on the face of Ensign Harry Kim. They both seemed to look from the ops station to the helm in unison as Neelix spoke up. "I'll go find Tom." Chakotay nodded as he walked over and sank into his first officer's chair he was already going on no sleep, and he had a feeling the day had only just begun.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>The helmsman of the starship Voyager was already outside Cargo Bay 2 and appeared ready to put his fist through the door's touch pad. He refrained and continued to press keys in a futile attempt to crack the Borg encryption code. He was alternating between that an pounding on the door while shouting. Neelix found he was glad that security had yet to arrive because while it would take several people shouting to be heard inside the cavernous bay the odds of someone outside the bay hearing and calling security were much higher. He stepped up and seized the had that was about to pound another series of thuds on the doorway. "Tom? What's wrong?"</P>
<P>He jerked his arm free and growled. "I'll tell you what's wrong. Seven's got B'Elanna in there!" He held his hands up in a placating gesture. "Now Tom, Seven and B'Elanna left the staff meeting together. I'm sure they are just working on the improved engine and wanted privacy." He sneered at the Talaxian. "There are locks on the doors to astrometrics. Harry clued me in. He told me about the looks they were giving each other. He told me that if I didn't get down her now I might never get B'Elanna back. I bet the Borg bitch was just waiting for this to happen so she could swoop right in an assimilate B'Elanna." Paris seemed ready to pound on the doors again when Neelix was able to move in the way.</P>
<P>He realized that this was what Janeway was talking about. While security could let him out for his duty shifts he would have a hard time piloting Voyager if B'Elanna came out here and tore his arms off. As Paris stepped to the side to batter the door again Neelix raised his voice. "Enough! You said it yourself, even if Seven WAS waiting YOU were the one who proposed when you knew B'Elanna was not ready. Now step away or I will call security." Even as Paris huffed and stormed away Neelix knew it was not over. Neelix considered his options, he knew he would have to update Commander Chakotay, and he thought it might be wise to get Ensign Kim to help, because while he was Tom's friend he was Seven's and B'Elanna's as well.</P>

<P>As she opened her eyes she realized her head was no longer resting on her pillow. The fabric was like Seven's biosuit, and with a start she realized it was, her head was resting in the lap from where Seven was sitting with her legs stretched out in front of her. As she opened her eyes she met a gaze that was filled with wonder, and enraptured with her. "Umm, hi." Seven smiled. "Good morning." She sat up, but didn't move far from Seven as she did so. "Wow, I don't think I've ever slept that soundly." Seven arched her brow. "Apparently not, I received note from Mr. Neelix that Ensign Paris had attempted to gain entry while we slept, and was not at all subtle in doing so." B'Elanna's expression soured. "He WHAT?"</P>
<P>Seven put a comforting hand on the klingon's hip. "Tom Paris is irrelevant, isn't he?" The soured expression softened. "Yes he is, at least as far as I'm concerned, but Neelix warned us for a reason." Seven nodded. "I will remain vigilant." Torres smiled, and squirmed a bit as the warmth of Seven's hand transferred from her hip and into her pelvis. She suddenly realized what she was doing and stopped breathing. B'Elanna noticed and grinned as she rested a hand on each side of Seven's face. "Breathe Seven, you have to breathe or you will pass out." Her grin grew as Seven took several long, shaky breaths into her lungs. "Now I need to go to my quarters and freshen up."</P>
<P>As she stood Seven remained seated and stared at her, First B'Elanna stared back, then rolled her eyes. "Ok, Now WE need to go to my quarters to get ME freshened up." Seven stood and waited patiently. She followed B'Elanna out as B'Elanna spoke. "Yeah, I just need to get myself together since you are always perfect." Seven kept a straight face as she replied. "I am Borg." Torres Laughed. "Fine, you can give me some pointers."</P>
