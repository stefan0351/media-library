<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 12 -->

<P>"Hope I didn't pull you away from anything important." Harry Kim ignored the jibe as he pulled a chair up to the biobed of Tom Paris. "No just finished something." Paris tried to look at his friend but was still restrained. "Oh? What?" "I finished making a decision." Both men took a breath as Paris spoke. "What was the decision?" "I'm still your friend. This is the worse thing you have ever done, but I don't hate you. I also came to another decision Tom, leave them alone. B'Elanna and Seven are happier then I have ever seen them and that INCLUDES when B'Elanna was with you. You try to hurt them again and I'll break your neck myself." Paris laughed at that, but Harry didn't. "I mean it Tom, leave them alone."</P>
<P>"I suppose I better, the rest of the crew will probably do more then Chakotay if I mess with them again." The voice of Voyager's former helmsman was heavy with bitterness and Harry slid his chair closer. "Tom, you've always been one to roll with the punches. Why can't you roll with this one?" Paris sighed. "Because I didn't give a damn before, I do now. It's not like when I tried to blow up the processing plant." Harry interrupted. "You didn't get to choose. You lost that power and you can stand that." "It's not that at all!" The last word came out a bit strangled but Harry was nodding as he stood up. "That's exactly it, you may have had to live with the consequences of your decisions, but when B'Elanna left you. You didn't have any say and you couldn't stand it."</P>
<P>Paris grumbled. "You mean when she left me for Seven." Harry shook his head when he sat back down. "She had feelings for Seven when she left you, but it was your proposing that got her to act on them." Paris continued to grumble. "Aren't you supposed to make someone feel better when you visit someone in sickbay?" "I may not be here to cheer you up, but I am trying to help you." The hands of Tom Paris were clenched on the top of the blanket covering him. "Yeah well thanks, but no thanks!" Harry stood up. "Earlier you told me that you finally had the idea. That you realized you had to give in life as well as take. Sometimes that giving means giving up and letting go. See you around Tom."</P>

<P>Chakotay felt the tension curling around in his belly like an angry serpent. He finally had something on his mind besides his crippling of a crewmember, but now he wondered if he was better off. The chime to his quarters sounded and he went to the door. As it opened B'Elanna Torres seemed startled that he came to greet her, but as she noticed the look on his face her relaxed expression mirrored his own glower. "You wanted to see me Chakotay?" Her former commanding officer nodded and motioned her to a chair. "Now that the engine is a success we are with in striking distance of making it home." B'Elanna smiled. "I can't think of much more."</P>
<P>Chakotay allowed himself a smile. "I think I know the one other thing you can think of." B'Elanna blushed as she continued smiling, but Chakotay's smile had vanished as if it were never there. "That is why I wanted to speak with you. I have already spoke to the captain, and with the Maquis no more we have a strong chance at a pardon, but even in the worse case scenario we would have light sentences at a minimum security facility." B'Elanna's expression darkened. "Sounds about right." He got up and moved next to B'Elanna where he sat on the edge of his desk. "I'm not worrying about us. Seven was Borg, and not only that she was almost born Borg. I can't see the Federation trying to arrest her for her activities as a drone the tactical knowledge that has saved us would be INVALUABLE to Starfleet."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's eyes had gotten wide and she seemed to have stopped breathing as she looked into the face of the first officer as he continued. "The problem is how they will go about getting it. With her distinguished service here on Voyager they may just ask her to be a tactical advisor, but in that worse case scenario they either openly, or covertly kidnap her. Either to wring her mind for every shred of tactical data, or for out and out dissection to see what the Collective would do with 18 years to perfect a drone." B'Elanna almost jumped out of her seat. "They wouldn't dare! That's something right out of the Cardassian handbook!" He stood with her hand placed his hands on her shoulders. "The Federation was willing to abandon us to Cardassia, and while I don't think they would unanimously decide to do that a handful of people with high enough rank might try to pull it off."</P>
<P>She sat down with a growl and Chakotay took his seat back on his desk. "Again, that is a worse case scenario, but we are preparing for it. The Captain thought it would help if Seven would be an official Federation citizen. While Annika Hansen was she had been declared dead with her parents after they were lost to the Collective." B'Elanna scrunched her nose. "Well she can just reclaim her citizenship. I mean if they try to grab her I doubt they will do it in the courts." "You would be surprised. The Captain and I went over precedent and found a case where the Federation was going to kill the sentient android Commander Data in order to take him apart so they could make more of him. Even if they don't a Federation family beyond the distant relatives could only help her status."</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded as Chakotay continued. "The Captain has said she would be more then willing to adopt her. Or as she put it "Seven has been like a daughter to me already and I would be happy to make if official." He then took another, far deeper breath. "There was another option however. While a girlfriend has no legal standing a wife would." B'Elanna literally stopped breathing and her eyes were almost all whites, which caused Chakotay's smile to return as he put a hand on her shoulder again. "There is another option B'Elanna. The Captain is ready to go ahead with the adoption, but I thought of you and the Captain and I agreed to ask you first. There is no rush yet, but when we get the edge Alpha Quadrant on long range sensors one of the options will have to be used. We have decided not to tell Seven yet so that she will only have to adjust to one decision or another, but the Captain asked me to tell you that the sooner you make a decision the easier it will be for Seven to adapt."</P>
<P>He then slipped from the desk to a crouch next to her chair. "It is not the best situation for starting a life together. Marriage should only be about love and if the Captain and I could not see how much you two love each other we would never suggest it." He grinned at her. "If we were not sure it would happen any way. all we are doing is pushing it ahead." She grinned back at him even as she shook her head in shock. He just continued to grin and patted her on the back as he stood up. She stood with him and they turned to look at each other as her spoke. "We know how much you two love each other, and this is going to be a big change in Seven's life no matter how it ends up, but we knew you would want to be a part either way." She nodded as she turned and walked form his quarters.</P>

<P>Alpha shift was in full swing, even the presence of a crew member recently promoted from Gamma shift at the helm didn't seem to dull the steady hum of activity flowing around Captain Janeway. Her first officer had been running late, but she knew why and his absence was easily covered. When her console showed her chief engineer had just logged into duty she knew her first officer would be there soon. Surely enough the turbolift soon opened and soon after Chakotay took his seat. "Any word?" He grinned at her. "Don't worry, you're not going to be a mother, not yet." Her body shook with a silent laugh. "Of course we know what that could mean."</P>
<P>He smiled. "Do you remember how?" She continued to smile. "Like riding a bicycle, though I'll probably be sure to brush up on it." The pair seemed to think of something and looked at the ops station. Ensign Kim held up his hands and shook his head. His look seemed rueful, but he seemed to understand that after the incident where Ensign Paris attempted to break into Cargo Bay 2 he suffered some guilt by association. The two leaders turned their gazes back to each other as Chakotay spoke. "It's still up in the air, but I think B'Elanna will "do the right thing." Janeway smiled, but her face looked confused. "What makes you say that? Especially after her previous reaction to a proposal." He shook his head. "She was proposed to, now she will be the one proposing. It's like we said. They are headed that way already. This is just a reason to do it early."</P>
<P>Her expression seemed dubious. "Yes, but couldn't that spoil the whole thing?" He seemed ready to answer, and then started at her. "I thought "I" was the one who played devil's advocate." "Turn about is fair play." They both laughed softly. "Still, I don't think the timing will play an issue. Seven has been in love with B'Elanna since she appeared on this ship in a green flash of transporter beam, and B'Elanna will ask, or she will not. She knows there is another option. So if she picks this one it is because she has decided it is time." Janeway nodded as she turned back to the starscape running across the viewscreen. "I agree with you."</P>

<P>"Can I get something for you B'Elanna?" The mess hall kitchen's had become somewhat familiar to B'Elanna Torres so she had no problems weaving between stoves, and ovens and other kitchen items as she paced. Breakfast was over and lunch was just starting, but when B'Elanna came in lunch seemed to be the last thing on her mind. Seven had followed moments after but a whispered conversation had Seven leaving with a look of confusion on her face. She looked at the Talaxian, the two actually being eye to eye which was a unique experience for them. "I don't know, a ring?" He stared confusedly for several seconds then had a huge smile break across his face. "So you made up your mind? You are going to ask her?"</P>
<P>Her chest was heaving as she tried to control the emotions running roughshod over her. "I, I sorta have to ask her." Neelix stepped closer as he put down the utensils he was using to prepare the food and wiped his hands on a near by cloth. "Have to? Don't you want to marry Seven?" Her hands dropped to her side and her head hung. "I do, it's just that." Neelix stepped forward. "Then that's all that matters. B'Elanna, you love Seven, she loves you. You want to marry her, then marry her." He still held the cloth, but had stopped wiping his hands. As he continued to look at her he calmly folded the cloth. She continued to stare at him. "Simple as that?" He smiled. "Simple as that."</P>

<P>B'Elanna Torres was afraid Tuvok might sprain his brow, but the Vulcan let it drop back to its place as he began to speak. "You want me to give you romantic advice?" She shook her head rapidly as she looked at him over the meditation table in his quarters. "No, no MARRIAGE advice. Neelix said you helped him tremendously when Neelix and Kes were considering a family. You are also one of the only married people I know of on the ship, and Seven values logic. So those three things together seemed to make you the best person to talk to." His brow arched as high as it did previously, but it relaxed right away. "Your reasoning is sound. Seven of Nine is obviously having a beneficial effect." Torres simply rolled her eyes as she waited for him to continue.</P>
<P>"While Seven of Nine possesses impeccable logic she also possesses emotions." While the last part sounded as if he was saying she had a terminal disease B'Elanna ignored it. "Since you are not already married I will assume you wish to know how to propose." Her expression darkened but showed no other signs of embarrassment. He took her lack of a response as a request to continue. "As I had said she is logical, but emotional. So any proposal should take that into account. For Seven of Nine sentiment will have far greater sway then show." She nodded her understanding as the Vulcan continued.</P>
<P>"As a member of the Collective she will still value unity so any sentiment should involve the both of you." While the Vulcan's are an emotionless species Torres decided they must have decided irritation didn't count as an emotion because Tuvok was showing large amounts of it. Keeping her smile internal she stood. "Thank you for your advice. I know Vulcan marriages are arranged, but your advice will be invaluable." As she turned to the door he spoke from behind her. "Prosperity on you and your union." She turned around and couldn't help but smile. "Thank you."</P>
