<P>Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres could feel her heart pounding in her hears, that sound only interrupted by the irregular gasps that were escaping her lips. Her boots thudded on deck plating as she ran down darkened corridors. The halls of Voyager were empty and dark, casting the sounds back at her as empty echoes. Part of her wanted to fight back, find help, do something, but all she could do was flee. Try to out pace the one chasing her. IT was only one person, B'Elanna was as sure of that as she was she needed to get away. Even though her pursuer could be felt they were not allowing themselves to be seen, and it was driving B'Elanna mad.  </P>
<P>What was causing the blood to pound even harder was not the fear, but the frustration. The halls were not laid out right! Every time she tried to find a room there was a wall. There was the occasional doorway but she knew they would not be able to help her. The important ones like engineering, her quarters, Tom's quarters were simply not there.  She thought she might be lost so she accessed the computer, but it had no power. With a growl of frustration her first hit the panel. Then she thought something could be wrong with Voyager, that perhaps something was warping the ship lie an encounter with an anomaly that turned out to be a species. That didn't explain why she couldn't find anybody, but all those thoughts vanished as she felt her hunter come near.</P>
<P>Her breathing stopped and she found herself slinking against the wall, though she didn't know if it was to attack or to hide. The commbadge on her chest had proven useless early on and there was no hesitation as she took it off and hurled it away. As the metallic clink reached her ears she was trying to slink in the opposite direction, but when she hear footsteps coming right at her she knew it failed. Gathering her feet underneath her she ran headlong down the corridors. No thoughts of stealth or subtlety just distance. Yet the steady sharp sounds of her pursuer's footfalls never broke stride and never seemed to fade.</P>
<P>Until they stopped all together. While part of her mind screamed to keep running, Torres stopped as well. Her lungs were straining so hard that they refused to stop breathing so she had to settle for making the needed breaths short and soft, but they were the only sound in the air. Slowly, ever so slowly she started to move, almost as if she expected some unseen weapon to cut her down at any moment. Strangely it helped, drawing upon her Starfleet training and Maquis experience left her feeling more in control of the situation, until she turned that corner.  While she had been looking for a member of the crew Seven of Nine was the last one she wanted to see.</P>
<P>In typical form Seven appeared detached. That was until B'Elanna looked into those normally ice cold eyes. No one could call them cold. They were intense, passionate, yet they still had that Borg focus, and that Borg focus was directed at her. They left her feeling vulnerable, weak, frightened, and she realized her hunter was a huntress and was standing before her. Turning to run Seven stepped forward. "You are efficient." B'Elanna couldn't help but look confusedly over her shoulder, and that was her last mistake. One human arm and one cybernetic darted out to grab her own. While she tried to struggle she found both arms inhumanly powerful. </P>
<P>Her chest was heaving with her attempts to escape, but as she looked closely she saw Seven's was as well. When she looked into those impossibly blue eyes again she found her strength leave her. Seven seemed to sense as much and pressed B'Elanna's back to the corridor wall behind them. Her hands were pressed against the same surface as Seven stepped close/ The woman's body was warm through her biosuit and the texture provided by the occasional implant made an amazing contrast to the otherwise soft, smooth fabric. With out even thinking B'Elanna's body pressed into the contact, grinding her own flesh against Seven's. As she looked up once more she saw those eyes looking at her, and burning with more passion then B'Elanna had ever seen, let alone felt.</P>
<P>Again with out any thought on her part she raised her cheek, baring it to her captor. Full pink lips moved close, and as she spoke Torres could feel it like a phantom caress over her cheek. "You are efficient, you will make an excellent mate." Then she felt the bite, but there was no shock, and very little pain. Just enough to make her body arch and while she cried out it was not from that pain. It was pleasure, joy, giving herself to one strong enough to claim her. Where her body had once struggled it now let go, resting into the contact. As she ceased resistance she felt a tongue lick at the wound cleaning it, and as she sat upright in bed she swore she could still feel it.</P>

<P>Seven of Nine, one time tertiary adjunct to Unimatrix Zero One poured over the collected data. Her hands moved from touch pad to touch pad on the Federation console with any notice as two blue eyes rapidly scanned multiple displays. While she gave no visible notice to the doors to astrometrics opening she did acknowledge the visitor. "I apologize Doctor, but I am unable to assist you at this time." While she did not look up to see the hologram smile she could hear it in his voice. "Actually, I was hoping I could help you. I couldn't help but notice the medical database being accessed from astrometrics." The Doctor stepped up next to her, and ignored the annoyed expression that flashed across the woman's face.</P>
<P>"We may have only one klingon on board, but I am sure I could answer any questions you have on their physiology. As long as you are not planning on using them to injure or resident klingon." Seven turned to see the Doctor's smirk and arched her brow at him. "I assure you I have no interest in injuring Lieutenant Torres." The Doctor shrugged. "Very well, then why the interest in klingon physiology?" A deep breath was the only answer. "My experience with the infected vinculum has left me with questions about klingon physiology." The Doctor smirked. "I don't think you need to worry. With out any klingon physiology the taste of Torres you got will have no effect."</P>
<P>The former drone's customary head tilt was her answer. "So there are no narcotic or addictive properties inherent in klingon blood?" The Doctor laughed slightly then looked curious. "Why, have you been suffering any lingering effects? Is the Son of Kvok still with us?" Even as she shook her head slightly she was blushing. "No the feelings are entirely my own." The expression on the face of the EMH became inscrutable. "Feelings?" While he was looking right at her she seemed unwilling to look him in the eye, but she did continue. "I find my concentration damaged by the presence of Lieutenant Torres." The expression on his face caused her to continue. "However it is not the typical feelings of antagonism. my psychological as well as physiological responces seem to be more of arousal."</P>
<P>For a second it was as if the Doctor had deactivated his program, but when Seven looked up he was still present, just with a profound look of shock on his face. The EMH seemed to shake himself. "Arousal? I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had made it to that point." While Seven's face appeared calm her eyes seemed pleading. "That is why I am researching the properties of klingon blood. It must have altered my brain chemistry to cause the premature development of those emotions." The Doctor put his hands on Seven's shoulders. "I gave you a complete examination after we reintegrated your personalities. I also paid special attention to your brain chemistry and would have picked up any deviation."</P>
<P>The worried look on her face seemed to get through to the Doctor as he gave her shoulders a squeeze and dropped his hand back down. Before he spoke he took a breath, even though such an act was unnecessary for a hologram. "It is not physiological so it must be psychological, and since we determined that your physiology and psychology were standard the question is if you have experience arousal previously in regards to Lieutenant Torres." The considerable mental abilities possessed by Seven of Nine seemed to be scanning her memory. "All of my previous feelings for Lieutenant Torres were adversarial." Closing his eyes tightly he opened them to capture the blue eyes before him. "Did you go out of your way to avoid Lieutenant Torres?" The expression on Seven's face could only be described as confused. </P>
<P>"The Lieutenant and I worked in many of the same areas, avoiding her would have been difficult." "Yes, but did you try?" The fair features seemed to scrunch up in concentration. "No, I did not. Does this mean I was previously attracted to Lieutenant Torres?" Eyebrows crept up the Doctor's forehead. "That a question only you can answer." She looked hopelessly at the hologram. "What do I do next?" He tried to smile reassuringly. "I'm not abandoning you Seven, but all I can do is present choices. You still have to pick one. Right now the choices are pursue your feelings for Lieutenant Torres, or attempt to ignore them."</P>

<P>B'Elanna found herself hating Starfleet architecture. The reason she found herself hating Starfleet architecture was because she was staring at Chakotay's ceiling and there was nothing to stare at. It had been Chakotay's idea for her to lie down, but it was not helping the aggravation that caused her to seek the first officer out in the first place. Of course being the patient on the therapist's couch was an image that only added to her aggravation. "B'Elanna, B'Elanna! Tell me about your dream." Torres groaned and threw her hands over her face. </P>
<P>"It's dark, I'm on Voyager, and I'm running. I'm panicking, the only thing I can think of is that I need to get away. I'm unarmed and I can't find any weapons. Now matter where I go I can't find anyone to help me. Even when I try to find a place to hide I can't even find the door." "Why can't you find the door? Are you lost?" B'Elanna growled out her reply. "No! The doors are simply not there! The hall continues on with out any sign there was ever a door." Chakotay nodded and it caused B'Elanna to roll her eyes. "Well that damn clicking keeps following me through the ship, never speeding up, or slowing down. Just keep the same steady, mocking pace."</P>
<P>As Chakotay continued to nod B'Elanna stopped breathing, and then as she started to speak she took a calming breath. "As I turn another corner I run into her, Seven of Nine." The way the calm breathing of the first officer stopped and then started again let B'Elanna know he had heard her. "She looking at me with the typical Borg sneer, but there is something more. The way she was looking at me was not like some inefficient humanoid, but like a specimen for assimilation." "How did that make you feel?" B'Elanna scoffed. "Oh please!" What sounded like a laugh escaped Chakotay's lips. </P>
<P>"Seriously, how did you feel when Seven sized you up?" While mulling over the question she chewed her bottom lip. "I felt challenged. Like this time she hadn't judged me yet, and I was determined to make the cut." The incessant nodding got faster. "Did you make the cut?" "Apparently so because she calls me efficient, but then I look into her eyes and there is a hunger there. That hunger scares the hell out of me Chakotay and it's at that point I realize I am face to face with my huntress. The panic returns full force and I turned to run, but for some stupid reason I look over my shoulder. I look over my shoulder right into her eyes and I am lost. Those eyes catch me before her hands do, but they do. They catch me and hold me against the wall. I try to struggle, but she presses against me."</P>
<P>The first officer took a breath. "You want to know how I felt about that? I LOVED it! That's why I'm talking to you. I'm having these freaky dreams about being dominated by Seven and I need to know what to do about them!" The placid tone of the first officer never changed. "Is that the end of the dream?" B'Elanna Torres threw the officer a venomous glare, but did shake her head no. "She tells me I am efficient, and that I will make an excellent mate. then she bites me. Except it wasn't like when she was the Son of Kvok. This was Seven of Nine. and I offered my cheek to her." "So you submitted to her?" B'Elanna laughed. "Oh yeah, but the time she was done I would have groveled at her feet. Even if she would never ask that kind of thing."</P>
<P>The first officer looks confused. "Why would you say that?" B'Elanna turned her eyes from inspecting the ceiling to focus on Chakotay. "Say what?" He smiled. "You said you would grovel at her feet, but she would never ask you to." B'Elanna blushed. "Well she wouldn't. I mean after she bit me I totally submitted and she even licked the wound clean." Chakotay arched his brows. "So you enjoyed submitting to her?" Even though she was lying on her back she shifted around uncomfortably. "Well. yeah. Some inner part of me liked it. I remember feeling. fulfilled. So what you saying I was Seven to tell me I've been a bad girl and give me a spanking?" It was Chakotay's turn to roll his eyes.</P>
<P>"Dream interpretation is not an exact science, but my people have been interpreting dreams and visions for ages. The dark corridors seem to represent you subconscious, the abandoned hallways of the mind. The fact that you can not find any one to help you or any place to hide is because that came subconscious is making you face the problem instead of hiding IT. Your subconscious is also telling you that you have to face it alone." From the couch B'Elanna scoffed yet again. "Then what am I doing here?" Chakotay waited quietly for her to look at him. "You're learning to stop running." "Seven, well Seven probably has several meanings. First would be a desire for approval, as one of your greatest critics her approval would signify everyone approval."</P>
<P>He steepled his fingers in front of his face. "You're not going to like what I have to say next. Seven's domination of you, and your acceptance of it seems to say that you feel you are not getting what you want in your relationship." She laughed, but it was a bitter, self-mocking sound. "Why? Paris seems ready to push me around whenever he finds something more interesting." He seemed ready to force the sympathy from his tone, but something about the self-hating way B'Elanna was speaking about herself caused him to keep it. "Yes, but he ignores you. Either entirely or simply ignoring what you want. There is a big difference. You said that in your dream Seven dominates you with strength, but in the end you submit to her."</P>
<P>"Well resistance is futile after all." When her attempt at a joke failed to get a laugh she just nodded. "That is the difference YOU decide to submit. She may be presenting you with an irresistible force, but you still choose to give in. So she's getting your opinion, allowing you to give her control instead of taking it." "So Seven is just a figure for all of this." The pause made B'Elanna nervous, but the next thing Chakotay said terrified her. "Possibly, but there is the bite, a decidedly klingon idea." B'Elanna sat up. "Well yeah, but I'm part klingon that has to factor into my dreams." Chakotay nodded. "Yes, but it is based on a real life event." She turned towards Chakotay. "Yeah and my mind fixated on it."</P>
<P>He put a hand on her knee. "You're starting to rationalize. Part of dream interpretation is having an open mind. If these were events the conscious mind could recognize then you would not be dreaming them. The fact is your subconscious mind modified the event." She looked at him like he had gone mad. "I remember the report, Seven said "You are strong, you will make an excellent mate." In the dream she said "You are efficient, you will make an excellent mate." I am willing to admit my diagnosis may be premature, but it seems like your mind knew Seven was not herself when she said it. So by changing it you took it from being the repressed personality of the Son of Kvok to being the actual personality of Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>The look on her face was not disbelieving but more an intense desire to disbelieve yet not being able to deny the truth. "B'Elanna, I'm not saying you need to track Seven down and swear the oath, but I am saying that there are feelings there. I don't know if the mating bond started them, or simply brought them to the surface, but I do know she is the key." Her voice sounded low, mournful, but she nodded as she spoke. "What about my bond to Tom?" The normally temperate tones seemed to get a touch of scorn. "Get him a new Captain Proton program, it will keep him busy." She just gave him a look. "First of all you were under the effects of Vorik's Pon Farr, Secondly you resolved those effects in combat with Vorik. Thirdly you've never had dream's about Tom Paris."</P>
<P>She looked up sharply, her mind obviously trying to find the point at which she told him that, but his slightly superior smile told her that he guessed. "Just talk to her B'Elanna. That's all I am suggesting." B'Elanna nodded as she stood up. "Talk, I mean that. No yelling, or teasing, be civil." The conversation carried as the two walked for the door. "Maybe that is a good point to start. Nor matter what happens I think it would be a good thing if you two resolved the animosity." B'Elanna threw a smirk back over her shoulder. "Well I suppose that one of us dying WOULD take care of the dreams one way or another." The half-hearted stern look Chakotay gave her made her laugh as she walked out the doors. </P>

<P>Seven of Nine looked up as she heard a voice speak to her, and found that she was grateful she was in the mess hall consuming her nutritional supplement because it gave her reason to swallow for her suddenly parched throat. "Seven, can I talk to you?" While she was attempting to follow the Doctor's suggestion to ignore her feelings she found it difficult as the object of her emotions sat down across from her. As she did Seven found herself analyzing the subject yet again, though from a far more human perspective. The human/klingon may have possessed a dense musculature, but the greater interest was the way the muscles bunched and flowed under her skin.</P>
<P>Skin that Seven found herself wanting to touch, to see if it were as warm and soft as she thought. That was probably the greatest allure of Lieutenant Torres, she possessed both form and function. Or as she over heard Ensign Paris telling Ensign Kim, style and substance. It did not help that her form seemed to compliment Seven's own. The smaller height being able to allow Seven to hold her close while leaving her head free to continue to look at her. While her analysis continued she saw an unusual expression cross the face of B'Elanna Torres as she started to speak. The only description she could give was rattled. It was a word she had learned from Captain Janeway, and it seemed fitting. </P>
<P>Fitting because Lieutenant Torres seemed to falter under Seven's focused gaze, but showed no desire to leave. She did however take an additional moment to compose herself before she started to speak. "I was looking over the astrometric sensors, and I have to say you have managed to improve them more then Starfleet command ever planned." With out skipping a beat Seven replied. "Starfleet command is in efficient." B'Elanna straightened her shoulder as her expression soured. "I'll have you know I am a Starfleet engineer." "Actually you are a Starfleet trained Maquis engineer serving on a Starfleet ship. You are far more adaptive."</P>
<P>On some level Torres seemed to recognize the compliment as she allowed her expression to relax. Even allowing herself to smile a bit as she responded. "We'll we've managed to out adapt the Borg." Seven gave the engineer another inspection, which seemed to again rattle the engineer. "Actually the Federation's adaptations have been created by other exceptional individuals like yourself." Seven's head took its quizzical tilt as she analyzed Lieutenant Torres. "Are you ill Lieutenant Torres? Your body temperature has been steadily increasing since we have begun talking." B'Elanna's eyes went wide around pupils that had become obviously dilated.</P>
<P>"What? I'm ok. Guess I am just not that hungry." She stood and lifted her plate of untouched food. Seven stood with her and linked her hands behind her back. "Would you like me to accompany you to sickbay?" The auburn waves of her hair ghosted around her head as she shook it. "No, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm just headed back to engineering." At that she turned to put her try in the recycler and nearly ran into another crewmember. As they extracted themselves they mumbled apologies. After seeing her tray disappear in the customary twinkling light she turned around to face Seven, and found her several steps closer. With out thinking she took a step back and bumped into the replicator.</P>
<P>Her bizarre behavior caused Seven to again tilt her head at her. "As you sure you wouldn't like me to accompany you to sickbay?" It almost seemed as if Lieutenant Torres had lost the ability to do anything but look at her and blink, but she finally seemed to regain control of her faculties. "No, no. I'm ok, really. I'm going back to work." With that she turned and walked from the mess hall. Though from the way Seven could see her muscles were moving she seemed just short of running.</P>

<P>"Oh my God, I'm turning into Harry Kim." While B'Elanna Torres didn't say the thought out loud it seemed to echo in her mind. Allowing her pace to settle from the near run she had used to get out of the mess hall she stepped into a turbolift. Part of her was ready to get back to work, but her body protested, telling her she needed to sit down. Deciding to take the rest of her break in her quarters she gave the computer the command and settled back as the decks started flying by. "Your body temperature has been steadily increasing since we have begun talking." While she remembered those words in her head she spoke the next ones to the empty turbolift. "Seven, you are NOT helping me resolve my feelings, and letting me know you could see how hot you were getting me." </P>
<P>The sentence dissolved into a growl. She did suddenly feel a kinship with the fresh-faced operations officer in the way embarrassment seemed to combine with arousal to cause tightness in her belly and aching points of sensitivity under her uniform tunic. Wrapping her arms tightly around herself she hugged with all she had, and it seemed to help relieve the tension in the rest of her body, but it seemed to deposit it all in that growing tightness in her lower abdomen. The rest of her body was left feeling tired and aching, and all she could think of as she stepped out the turbolift doors was getting to her quarters and laying down. That thought was the only one on her mind and when her door opened she stumbled through and went straight to her bed. Collapsing on it she didn't even realize her eyes were drifting closed.</P>
<P>At least not until she woke up and recognized the darkened hallways she was now in. A rush of awareness shot through her as she heard the clicking she now recognized the high heels the Doctor had been so wonderful to add to Seven's biosuit. Even as her chest started to heave in anticipation of the chase a wicked smile curved her face, and she was off. The clicking was matched by the hammering of B'Elanna's boots outside and the thudding of her pulse inside. It reached the point it nearly blocked out the external sounds as red seemed to tint her vision. When Seven finally did appear the shock nearly caused stars to dance in her vision. Seven took advantage by slamming her palms to the wall on either side of Torres.</P>
<P>Yet instead of struggling her found herself sniffing. An instinctive need that bought up faint remembrances of times she had been close enough to smell Seven. The biological funk that most drones had from the normally humid environment of the cube was gone. No longer did she smell of human flesh penetrated by machine. The smell was clean, light. The only comparison was an ocean breeze, but instead of the light tang of slat air Seven smelled of health, vibrancy. As if the body contained under that form hugging biosuit was a pure vessel of life. B'Elanna Torres found she could not get enough, and she didn't even realize she was registering her approval with a constant low growl. </P>
<P>Seven seemed to feel the same as she took in the scent of B'Elanna's skin and hair, though her growl sounded more like a rumbling purr coming from somewhere deep in the woman's chest. It was the same instinct that drove her to sniff drove her sniffing to move up the long neck and to the perfect face. B'Elanna's hovering spoke to Seven and with out a word the long neck moved back, exposing her cheek, offering it's perfection for B'Elanna's mark. The idea alone made B'Elanna's growl grow in intensity as her mouth opened. </P>
<P>"Engineering to Lieutenant Torres." Sleep turned to wakefulness as the growl turned into a shout. "What?" B'Elanna realized she should have tried to keep the rage out of her voice as she answered her commbadge, but she found she really did not care. Yet as the voice on the other end told her she was late coming back from her break she felt the rage leave, only to be replaced by a bone deep weariness.</P>

<P>Janeway raise one elegant eyebrow over her coffee cup. While Seven had politely declined liquid refreshment she and the Captain were familiar enough that Janeway was comfortable getting herself another cup of coffee. Now drinking said cup she sipped and paused, letting her brow communicate for her. "B'Elanna Torres fled from your presence?" While her head was hung morosely she looked up with an expression that Janeway knew was anger. "I fail to see what you find so amusing with Lieutenant Torres find my presence intolerable." Janeway grinned openly at that. "On the contrary Seven, I think she found your presence entirely TOO tolerable." Confusion gained prominence on the young woman's features. "Elaborate."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled and patted the couch next to her in a motion for Seven to sit down next to her, and surprisingly she did. "Just think, was it anything like another encounter you had in the mess hall?" Both Seven's human brow and occular implant arched nearly up to her hairline as she looked at Janeway with disbelief. "You are incorrect, Lieutenant Torres does not with to copulate with me." Janeway's smile slipped into a grin. "Take your data from the encounter with Lieutenant Torres and compare it to the encounter with Ensign Kim, correlate the information with the memories of the Son of Kvok." Seven seemed to force her normally impassive expression back into place.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres seemed less then receptive to the advances made by the Son of Kvok." "Did she? Think Seven, what would have happened if security had never interrupted the two of you? The imperious expression seemed to rest easier as she replied. "Lieutenant Torres is the one who called security." Janeway nodded. "Yes, but that was before she knew what you were doing. If I remember right you mentioned that she seemed almost playful when you and the Doctor worked with her in engineering afterwards. Let me ask you this. can you provide any other hypothesis for her behavior?" Minute after minute clicked by and with each minutes Seven's expression seemed to get more confused while Janeway's grew more triumphant.</P>
<P>"You can't, can you?" Seven looked up at her; the wide eyed confusion a silent request for clarity. The expression immediately reached Janeway and her features softened. "All the reasoning in the universe can't quantify love, and despite our recent mental exercise it can not detect it either. It is purely a function of the enigma that is sentience. If you are feeling these feelings then you are ready for them, because there is no other option." Seven's posture was already academy perfect, but her shoulders still slid back as she straightened. "I also confided my feelings to the Doctor and he said I could also attempt to ignore my feelings." The captain's expression darkened. "The Doctor can not even ignore his feelings and it is wrong from him to think you should."</P>
<P>Seven seemed confused, but Janeway continued before she could question the Captain further. "Seven, you know what you feel, you always have and have always felt free to express it." Janeway allowed herself a slight chuckle at that. "Why can't you now?" "I fear B'Elanna's reaction." Janeway laid a hand on the young woman's knee. "You didn't fear mine when you chastised me for risking B'Elanna's life on the Mari home world. The fact is B'Elanna's reaction is irrelevant because you will continue to feel the way you do until you resolve the emotion. No matter what her response is you will be free of the limbo you are in now." "What do I do?" Janeway smiled and scooted closer on the couch.</P>

<P>B'Elanna Torres felt her fatigue leave her in a rush. Though the truth of the matter was it was replaced as she turned around to see who had entered the Jefferies Tube junction that she was working in. The sight of Seven of Nine was what had sent her pulse to racing, and when the former drone sealed the doors she found the throbbing starting elsewhere. "Seven? What are you doing?" Instead of replying Seven circled, leaning in to sniff at her. An action B'Elanna didn't need because the confined space was carrying Seven's scent to her with every breath. "Seven? Or is it the Son of Kvok again?" The implant arched in the way that was uniquely Seven and her circles drew tighter. "No."</P>
<P>B'Elanna waited several more seconds under the intense scrutiny. "Then what are you doing?" Seven stopped suddenly, directly in front of Torres, which caused the engineer to back up. Seven the spoke. "Evaluating you. You will add to my perfection." Before she was able to consider what that meant she found herself pushed back against the walls as Seven's body pressed up against her. Her body slammed into wall behind them, but it made the softness pressing against her all the more intense. Strong arms wrapped around her waist as her legs threw themselves over the rounded hips of the one holding her. While all that was happening Seven's mouth pressed to hers and she let out a joyous moan as she opened her own mouth and let her tongue glide out to meet Seven's.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hips found a rhythm as they ground themselves against Seven's ridged abdomen while her own arms rested on Seven's shoulders. Her hands pulled and tugged at the woman's hair bun until it came free allowing B'Elanna to revel in the sensations of running her fingers through the silken tresses. That caused Seven to man as she kissed B'Elanna, and Torres swore she could feel it fill her chest. A sensation that left her breathless, but she found she did not care. She was in a place beyond concerns. Her entire universe was pressed to her chest, holding her tight, kissing her, touching her. The human/klingon hybrid's compact form was pressing back so hard that she seemed to be climbing the taller form holding her. The fingers that had been running through the silken mane slipped lower and found the biosuit's collar.</P>
<P>They pulled and tugged, trying to tear the barrier to the flesh underneath, but the material continued to confound her. The she felt the textured hand grip her firmly while the soft human one reached up to B'Elanna's. The fingers brushed lightly but then found the clasp B'Elanna was not willing to bother looking for. Silently it was released, and as the fabric parted any sound it may have made was lost in the satisfied growl made by the klingon. At this point her human side had decided it was a mistake to deny herself this passion and had finally, perhaps for the first time truly let her klingon side free. The white of her teeth was bared as she tugged the garment to rest at Seven's waist. An action that caused her to feel the hands of her mate cradle her head, the action causing B'Elanna to look up as she purred and reveled in the touch.</P>
<P>Looking up she met the face of her mate. Those infinitely blue eyes met the fire in B'Elanna's and returned it. The smile that curved the full lips was both welcoming and challenging. Torres then turned her head and kissed the inside of the enhanced arm, a kiss that was tender, but insistent. She then whispered deeply. "Mine." The returning whisper was ragged with desire. "Yours." Her hands took hold of the appendage and straightened it, then laying a kiss on the inside of the elbow. "Mine." "Yours." Yet as she heard the reply she felt the not so fully human hand grip her hair with surprising might and pull her head back to meet Seven's eyes. "Mine!" A feral smile crossed the features of B'Elanna Torres. "Yours." There was no resistance as the hands tore open the fastenings of her uniform jacket.</P>
<P>It hit the wall with great force as it was pulled from her and hurled away to fall lifelessly to the floor deck plating. Torres already had her arms stretched well above her as the same hands yanked the under shirt free from her trousers and up over her head. The article of clothing followed a similar flight path to the jacket that proceeded it. Her basic black Starfleet issue bra did not manage as well, Seven deciding she did not have the patience to unfasten the garment and simply used her enhanced hand to rip it to shreds, though it did join the growing pile of clothing. Torres ran her nails down Seven's ribs and the woman shivered in delight. Shivering that stopped abruptly as Torres latched her mouth onto one of the large round nipples before her, and Seven went rigid. When the sucking motion was varied with kisses, licks and the soft scraping of teeth Seven body loosened and a long breath of a moan rattled through her.</P>
<P>Sure hands and deft fingers rested on each side of B'Elanna's head and caressed her cheeks and neck, while keeping her mouth to Seven's breast. Even as she continued to please the nipple she smiled around it while she took one of her free hands to capture the other breast and use her fingers to mimic the actions of her mouth. That caused Seven to cry out and arch into her touch. While Seven's hand tried to keep her head immobile Torres pulled back and stared into Seven's eyes, then wordlessly Torres dropped to her knees. Seven's head flopped back and stared at the ceiling of the Jefferies junction point. Tugging at the form fitting fabric she got it to Seven's knees. Unwilling to bother with it further she left it there and nuzzled the soft thatch of hair at the juncture of those long, tone legs.</P>
<P>Hearing the ragged panting her looked up but kept her cheek to the curls of spun gold. Her hair now free it dangled over Seven's face as she looked down at the klingon. Torres let their eyes speak, and then she craned her neck to put her mouth to the swollen tissues underneath. Seven's legs gave out as she shrieked. All of the hormones pumping through B'Elanna's system included adrenaline and she was able to push her back against the wall and hold her up with out ever breaking contact. Now that Seven was braced Torres became more insistent. Letting her tongue press on the lips, and then using the tip to spread them apart and slide her tongue between them between them.</P>
<P>The clear liquid essence of Seven's ecstasy covered B'Elanna's lips and chin, even causing a drip to run down her neck, and she reveled in it. Concentrating on the lips and surrounds, but also breaking to kiss, suck and even nip at the hardened nub. Seven seemed as frantic as B'Elanna was, grinding her hips against the klingon's face, her body knowing what it needed to find release, and B'Elanna did not deny it to her. Her mouth concentrated on the nub with an unrelenting intensity. Not giving release, but demanding it, and Seven complied. A howl worthy of any klingon burst from Seven's lips and her body started to spasm. Torres broke contact, but if Seven noticed she did not seem to care as she gratefully latched onto the arms that pulled her close. Even as aftershocks shook Seven like small volts of electricity she rested her face to the bare chest of Lieutenant Torres.</P>
<P>When her senses started to return she looked deeply into the brown eyes regarding her with a desire to claim her as her own, and a protectiveness to take care of what belonged to her and protect it from all challengers. It was already an effort to keep her head up in the exhausting aftermath of passion and Seven happily laid back her head and exposed her cheek. At first a kiss tender and warm, then the firm texture of teeth. A source of strength previously unknown to her allowed her to reach up and hold the head of her mate as the teeth pressed harder. It also kept her reaction to a sharp hiss of an intake of breath as the teeth broke the skin. The mouth pulled away and a tender tongue seemed to lap at the wound to clean away the blood.</P>
<P>Seven could feel her lovers nipples harden with intensified arousal at the taste of her blood, and the knowledge gave her a renewed sense of strength that allowed her to roll B'Elanna Torres from her position against Seven's side and lay her flat on her back. Torres attempted to rise, but Seven used her enhanced hand to push her back down. She kept her hand at B'Elanna's abdomen and used her index finger to circle the woman's belly button. At that B'Elanna growled deeply, barring her teeth. Seven grinned wickedly and used her human hand to reach up and the right breast, opposite the side she was sitting on. While she had felt her own nipples harden now that she was exploring B'Elanna's body she found the texture fascinating.</P>
<P>Her thumb circled the highly textured surface while she used her fingernails to circle the surface of the firm globe. Underneath her touch B'Elanna arched her hips so that while Seven's hand had not moved it was still touching lower on her body. Seven grinned as she spoke her voice low and soft. "You are impatient." The burning brown eyes looked up at her. "I've been too patient already." Seven's smile softened at that and her hand moved to the trousers fastening. Her fingers opened it deftly and spread the opening wide to expose the standard issue black panties. Seven could see the damp spot and the scent coming from B'Elanna's growing arousal reached her nose. An answering growl found it's way past her lips and she pressed firmly through the fabric and on B'Elanna's pubic mound.</P>
<P>It was B'Elanna's turn to cry out as she pushed her hips upward. With a smile Seven flattened her hand and pushed Torres back to the deck plating. Once B'Elanna was flat on her back, but wriggling with desire Seven took her hand from caressing B'Elanna's breast and brought it to the waistband of the uniform trousers. She made B'Elanna arch her hips as she pulled the pants and panties down over the woman's hips. In one motion she then pulled them down past B'Elanna hips, her knees, and off. They hit the opposite wall from their mates, but neither woman cared as B'Elanna spread her legs wide. As she did so she watched those wonderful blue eyes get wide and seem locked at a spot down there. The wriggling woman seemed ready to beg Seven to touch her but there was no need as the human hand reached out and touched the spot.</P>
<P>The eyes moved back and seemed concerned as the touch seemed to steal B'Elanna's ability to breathe, but while she seemed concerned it did not stop her from running her fingers through the pooling wetness and warm tissues underneath. As the viscous moisture covered her massaging fingers Torres seemed to regain her ability to breathe, but raggedly. While Seven used some of the knowledge she had researched she let B'Elanna be her teacher as she mimicked the actions B'Elanna had done with her mouth. It seemed to be a success as fresh moisture mixed with the wetness already there. When she finally set out to explore the inside of B'Elanna she gasped as well as the amazing sensation of the tightness, and heat inside B'Elanna overwhelmed her. Blinking several times to clear the dizziness she opened her eyes to see the klingon amazingly still, but looking directly at her with eyes screaming out her need.</P>
<P>A need she answered, she kept the digit probing inside her mate doing so, but faster. While she did that her other fingers massaged the surrounding area and used her thumb to massage B'Elanna's firm, throbbing clitoris. All the actions made B'Elanna scrunch her eyes closed and begin to man a series of mans, each one higher then the next. Each breath she took seeming to catch in her throat before she was able to continue to moan. Suddenly her hips pushed up hard against Seven's hand and locked into position and a howl that far out reached Seven's surged forward. Seven considered withdrawing her finger, but found she was unable to as B'Elanna's vaginal muscles clenched and released too fast and too firm to allow her finger to escape. So Seven continued to massaging, but far more gently, her voice a counterpart, cooing B'Elanna through her climax.</P>
<P>Tears were in B'Elanna's eye as she opened them once more. Now she could see as well as feel Seven's hand withdraw as the taller woman stretched out next to her and snuggled up, but B'Elanna caught her with her eyes as she was half way to the deck and Torres arched her cheek. Even though the blood had dried the wound was still crimson on Seven's cheek with one stream of blood running down her cheek. Seven was on B'Elanna's left side and used her hand to brace her while the opposite one reached out to caress the offered cheek as a confused expression covered her face. "From you, I need the mark from YOU." Seven nodded as the whispered message and lay over B'Elanna Torres, her mouth finding the cheek and kissed it gently to the point the bite came as a shock, but B'Elanna's only reaction was to arch the rest of her body into Seven.</P>
<P>As B'Elanna had done for her she lapped wound clean and seemed to be marvelling at the taste as she lay down and rested her head to her mates shoulder. B'Elanna then sat up and urged Seven up with her. The two women simply stared at each other, B'Elanna's wide smile being answered with a shy one of Seven's. B'Elanna reached out and put her hand behind Seven's head and pulled her into a kiss, one that was deep and passionate, but also soothing, a testament to their passion instead of a continuation of it. Torres then looked deeply into the soft, trusting eyes of Seven of Nine. "There is more. if you want it." Torres felt her human side reassert itself as an wash of insecurity, but her klingon side had hold and forced it down. "The Oath." The momentary confusion left Seven's eyes as they softened and she nodded</P>

<P>The women now walked the halls of Voyager, both having freshened up as much as they were able, but they held their wounded cheeks high in a mutual unconscious effort. "We should get that looked at." While they kept walked Seven turned her head slightly and arched her brow at the remark. The familiar gesture a seeming contrast with a world where everything had seemed to have changed for both of the women, and a physical contrast as the still scabbing wound moved with the motion. "It is already being "looked at"." B'Elanna laughed at that. "We should head to sickbay." Seven seemed to consider that and nodded as they made their way to a turbolift.</P>
<P>As the doors opened and the car emptied the women were smirking as they were stared at. Stepping into the now empty car they turned to each other. B'Elanna seemed to be laughing to herself. "Well this should be around the ship with in the next five minutes. Though I'm surprised they didn't hear us earlier." Her complexion reddened. "We weren't very quiet." Seven smiled. "I erected force fields to insure our privacy." B'Elanna seemed stunned. "Seven! You seduced me!" "Yes. Do you object?" Torres squared her shoulders. "Well, no." B'Elanna started giggling. "Chakotay suggested I explore my feelings for you. I don't think this is what he had in mind."</P>
<P>Seven smirked. "You simply decided to explore your feelings by exploring me." B'Elanna blushed even deeper as Seven continued. "Captain Janeway gave me similar advice." B'Elanna grinned at her. "To explore your feelings or to explore me?" Her last two words were heard as the turbolift door opened and the crewman waiting outside turned bright red. Seven took the hand of a giggling Torres who seemed able to only shrug at the crewman. "I'm glad it was Janeway and Chakotay who gave us the advice so they may only demote us when they find out." They stopped just short of sickbay. "Why would they concern themselves?" B'Elanna stepped close. "We went way beyond fraternizing while on duty." "We were on break." Torres seemed taken back. "We were?" Seven nodded. "I was very precise in my scheduling."</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded. "So you were." She then smiled as the two of them stepped into sickbay. They looked around and noticed they were alone so Seven spoke up. "Computer, activate the Emergency Medical Hologram." A flickering hologram resolved itself. "Please state the nature of the medical emergency." B'Elanna stepped forward. "No emergency really." The Doctor quickly stepped forward. "Seven, B'Elanna? What happened?" The two women stared at the Doctor purposefully and the hologram's shoulders slumped. "Well, I guess congratulations are in order. Are you here for treatment or to inform Mr. Paris?" B'Elanna looked around the room again. "Tom is supposed to be here isn't he?" The Doctor was picking up a dermal regenerator, but Torres topped him for a moment.</P>
<P>"Just clean and bandage mine." Seven spoke. "Mine as well." The Doctor nodded. "Very well, as far as Mister Paris he, is SUPPOSED to be here, but if the shift is quiet enough he has taken to sneaking out early. If you are looking for him I would suggest checking the holodecks." Torres shook her head. "That explains him putting me off several times the past few weeks. He said he had started a project in the holodeck and was right in the middle of it." The EMH seemed back to normal. "You snooze, you loose I guess. So what are you going to do about Tom?" Seven had been simply observed the conversation up to this point. "As B'Elanna's mate I am entitled to challenge him as my competitor." B'Elanna smiled fondly. "Tom is no competition for you, and I think the Captain would object to the sudden loss of her helmsman."</P>
<P>Seven seemed totally calm as the Doctor moved to clean her wound. "I could assimilate him. His skill would still be available." B'Elanna noticed the slight curve of Seven's lips. "No, the idea of you assimilating any of his distinctiveness is just TOO upsetting." The Doctor looked up and saw both women grinning. "Hold still please." Torres lost her smile as she continued. "I will have to deal with Tom. No matter how much he neglected me we were in a relationship and he deserves to know it is over." She then stood still as the Doctor moved to treat her. "We'll go by my quarters and freshen up then I'll go find Tom." Seven nodded. "I will accompany you. We may also want to speak to the captain and first officer before they gain the information from another source."</P>
<P>B'Elanna noticeably kept herself from nodding. "That's a very good idea. It will be better if they hear it from us. We can freshen up, talk to them, and then go find Tom. Though you should probably wait outside." Seven seemed reluctant but her expression said she agreed. The Doctor closed his instruments. "There you are. Would you like me to prepare a small medikit for the both of you? I could put it in a plain brown wrapper." The two women just stared at him. They then turned and left sickbay, not hearing the Doctor sigh after they left and speak. "Computer. deactivate the Emergency Medical Hologram."</P>

<P>After loading her uniform into the replicator, or in the case of her bra loading in it's tatters she turned and found Seven appraising her body with a blatantly hungry look. "No you don't. We need to get cleaned up and then go see the captain. Now get undressed." As Seven complied B'Elanna found herself reconsidering as Seven discarded her biosuit. A forced deep breath allowed her not to pounce on the silken flesh now entirely exposed to her. An action Seven seemed to notice as she smirked. B'Elanna turned and took her now clean uniform from the replicator and set it aside while taking Seven's biosuit and loading it in. Turning back she smirked at a similar expression on Seven's face.</P>
<P>Taking Seven's hands on her own she pulled them towards the shower. Guiding Seven in ahead of her she set the controls and stepped in. As the sonic waves stared to pulse over them she felt Seven's hands begin to lightly caress her. "Seven?" The one time drone's voice was tinged with amusement. "I just wish to touch you." She reached out and caressed Seven's cheek. "Please do." While the sonic waves cleaned the remnants of the women's passion from their bodies they shared soft kisses and gentle caresses. When the waves ended they almost seemed regretful as they stepped from the shower. Naked, they both padded to back to the main area of the quarters and got dressed once more, though they were sure to help each other with fastenings.</P>
<P>B'Elanna smirked. "See? My bra is not that complex to figure out." Seven arched her brow on a face that appeared back to normal except for the circular bandage on her cheek. "It is still an impediment." B'Elanna giggled, she then reached out to caress Seven's cheek. "You are so beautiful!" She leaned in to quickly kiss the woman's lips. "I feel like I'm drunk, on you, but it all seems so clear. Clearer then it has even been before." Seven titled her head. "Klingon's are known for their sensory acuity." B'Elanna smiled and kissed Seven again. "Its part of my being klingon, but it has nothing to do with physical senses. We better get going." Seven nodded and the two strode out the door and to the turbolift. B'Elanna spoke and then turned to Seven. "Bridge. So how do you think they will react?"</P>
<P>Seven turned to face her. "Their reaction is irrelevant. It is simply a matter of how well they assimilate the knowledge of our bonding." B'Elanna arched her brows, then smiled and nodded. As the doors opened and they stepped out on the bridge the eyes of the entire bridge crew focused on them, or to be more exact the matching bandages on their cheeks. The pair moved to stand by the command chairs where Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay looked them, then at each other, then back at them. Silence reigned until Seven spoke. "Captain, Commander, we would like to speak to you." With out a word Janeway nodded and stood up, motioning the four of them to her ready room.</P>
<P>As the door shut behind them Janeway was the first to speak. "Can I assume the situation between you two is resolved. The two women in question looked at each other and couldn't stop from grinning as B'Elanna spoke. "Yes Ma'am." Janeway nodded. "I'll assume any talk of discretion would be. futile. So I will trust that the two of you will not allow it to impact the performance of your duties." They both nodded immediately." Janeway's expression took a firmer note. "While I can not, and will not hold you responsible for the reaction of others I am going to ask that you first bring any matter to the attention of myself or Commander Chakotay."</P>
<P>The two women nodded again. "Dismissed." As the two women left Chakotay turned to the captain and smirked. She grinned back. "Well I can't have them killing my helmsman can I?" Chakotay laughed softly. "What about the rest of the crew?" Janeway looked thoughtful. "To be honest I don't think the majority of them will care, and the fact you and I have given our blessing should resolve the matter. It's about time isn't it?" Chakotay's laugh wasn't soft.</P>

<P>As the holodeck arch closed and then vanished B'Elanna Torres found herself in a bar. Though from the decor she realized it would be called a pub. As with most of Tom's simulation it was on Earth and from the lack of electronics she figured it was from some time before Earth's industrial revolution. She sighed as she realized she had learned more about Tom's hobby then his own history. Voyager's sandy haired helmsman was found coming from the back room. "B'Elanna!" He stepped forward and hugged her, not seeming to notice that she did not return the hug. "What do you think? An authentic Irish pub, I'm actually planning a whole town."</P>
<P>Torres nodded. "It's good work Tom, you really know your holograms." He seemed to notice her then. "B'Elanna? Is something wrong? What did you do to your cheek?" She took a deep breath and looked him straight in the eye. A look he seemed to shrink from. "Tom, you don't need to worry about me when you want to work on the program again. You don't need to worry about me period." The color drained from his features, as his body seemed to deflate. "What? B'Elanna? You can't mean that. Let's have a nice dinner. Heck we can have it here. I just finished programming the bartender. I think you'll like him. We'll eat and we'll talk."</P>
<P>She shook her head." It's been said Tom. More times then I like to think about." He seemed ready to speak again so she reached up and pulled the bandage aside. Upon seeing the bite Voyager's helmsman feel silent. "I don't hate you, and I don't want you to hate me. I just hope you understand I needed to find what was right for me, and not matter how much I loved you we were not it." He didn't speak as she turned around and called for the arch. As it appeared she stopped. "The harp is backwards." He looked up. "I'll fix it later. Bye B'Elanna." "Goodbye Tom." The doors opened for her and she stepped through to find Seven patiently waiting for her.</P>
<P>She automatically opened her arms and B'Elanna gratefully stepped in. First she just closed her eyes and took comfort in the embrace. The warmth the made it through the biosuit, and the scent that surrounded her. After recovering in that shelter she looked up into Seven's eyes. "It's done." Seven nodded, seeming as sad as B'Elanna. "Let's get you back to your quarters." Seven immediately started to walk, but was brought short by B'Elanna. "Let's go home."</P>
