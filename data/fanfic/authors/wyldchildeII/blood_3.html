<!-- Blood \ Chapter 3 -->

<P>B'Elanna found herself hating Starfleet architecture. The reason she found herself hating Starfleet architecture was because she was staring at Chakotay's ceiling and there was nothing to stare at. It had been Chakotay's idea for her to lie down, but it was not helping the aggravation that caused her to seek the first officer out in the first place. Of course being the patient on the therapist's couch was an image that only added to her aggravation. "B'Elanna, B'Elanna! Tell me about your dream." Torres groaned and threw her hands over her face. </P>
<P>"It's dark, I'm on Voyager, and I'm running. I'm panicking, the only thing I can think of is that I need to get away. I'm unarmed and I can't find any weapons. Now matter where I go I can't find anyone to help me. Even when I try to find a place to hide I can't even find the door." "Why can't you find the door? Are you lost?" B'Elanna growled out her reply. "No! The doors are simply not there! The hall continues on with out any sign there was ever a door." Chakotay nodded and it caused B'Elanna to roll her eyes. "Well that damn clicking keeps following me through the ship, never speeding up, or slowing down. Just keep the same steady, mocking pace."</P>
<P>As Chakotay continued to nod B'Elanna stopped breathing, and then as she started to speak she took a calming breath. "As I turn another corner I run into her, Seven of Nine." The way the calm breathing of the first officer stopped and then started again let B'Elanna know he had heard her. "She looking at me with the typical Borg sneer, but there is something more. The way she was looking at me was not like some inefficient humanoid, but like a specimen for assimilation." "How did that make you feel?" B'Elanna scoffed. "Oh please!" What sounded like a laugh escaped Chakotay's lips. </P>
<P>"Seriously, how did you feel when Seven sized you up?" While mulling over the question she chewed her bottom lip. "I felt challenged. Like this time she hadn't judged me yet, and I was determined to make the cut." The incessant nodding got faster. "Did you make the cut?" "Apparently so because she calls me efficient, but then I look into her eyes and there is a hunger there. That hunger scares the hell out of me Chakotay and it's at that point I realize I am face to face with my huntress. The panic returns full force and I turned to run, but for some stupid reason I look over my shoulder. I look over my shoulder right into her eyes and I am lost. Those eyes catch me before her hands do, but they do. They catch me and hold me against the wall. I try to struggle, but she presses against me."</P>
<P>The first officer took a breath. "You want to know how I felt about that? I LOVED it! That's why I'm talking to you. I'm having these freaky dreams about being dominated by Seven and I need to know what to do about them!" The placid tone of the first officer never changed. "Is that the end of the dream?" B'Elanna Torres threw the officer a venomous glare, but did shake her head no. "She tells me I am efficient, and that I will make an excellent mate. then she bites me. Except it wasn't like when she was the Son of Kvok. This was Seven of Nine. and I offered my cheek to her." "So you submitted to her?" B'Elanna laughed. "Oh yeah, but the time she was done I would have groveled at her feet. Even if she would never ask that kind of thing."</P>
<P>The first officer looks confused. "Why would you say that?" B'Elanna turned her eyes from inspecting the ceiling to focus on Chakotay. "Say what?" He smiled. "You said you would grovel at her feet, but she would never ask you to." B'Elanna blushed. "Well she wouldn't. I mean after she bit me I totally submitted and she even licked the wound clean." Chakotay arched his brows. "So you enjoyed submitting to her?" Even though she was lying on her back she shifted around uncomfortably. "Well. yeah. Some inner part of me liked it. I remember feeling. fulfilled. So what you saying I was Seven to tell me I've been a bad girl and give me a spanking?" It was Chakotay's turn to roll his eyes.</P>
<P>"Dream interpretation is not an exact science, but my people have been interpreting dreams and visions for ages. The dark corridors seem to represent you subconscious, the abandoned hallways of the mind. The fact that you can not find any one to help you or any place to hide is because that came subconscious is making you face the problem instead of hiding IT. Your subconscious is also telling you that you have to face it alone." From the couch B'Elanna scoffed yet again. "Then what am I doing here?" Chakotay waited quietly for her to look at him. "You're learning to stop running." "Seven, well Seven probably has several meanings. First would be a desire for approval, as one of your greatest critics her approval would signify everyone approval."</P>
<P>He steepled his fingers in front of his face. "You're not going to like what I have to say next. Seven's domination of you, and your acceptance of it seems to say that you feel you are not getting what you want in your relationship." She laughed, but it was a bitter, self-mocking sound. "Why? Paris seems ready to push me around whenever he finds something more interesting." He seemed ready to force the sympathy from his tone, but something about the self-hating way B'Elanna was speaking about herself caused him to keep it. "Yes, but he ignores you. Either entirely or simply ignoring what you want. There is a big difference. You said that in your dream Seven dominates you with strength, but in the end you submit to her."</P>
<P>"Well resistance is futile after all." When her attempt at a joke failed to get a laugh she just nodded. "That is the difference YOU decide to submit. She may be presenting you with an irresistible force, but you still choose to give in. So she's getting your opinion, allowing you to give her control instead of taking it." "So Seven is just a figure for all of this." The pause made B'Elanna nervous, but the next thing Chakotay said terrified her. "Possibly, but there is the bite, a decidedly klingon idea." B'Elanna sat up. "Well yeah, but I'm part klingon that has to factor into my dreams." Chakotay nodded. "Yes, but it is based on a real life event." She turned towards Chakotay. "Yeah and my mind fixated on it."</P>
<P>He put a hand on her knee. "You're starting to rationalize. Part of dream interpretation is having an open mind. If these were events the conscious mind could recognize then you would not be dreaming them. The fact is your subconscious mind modified the event." She looked at him like he had gone mad. "I remember the report, Seven said "You are strong, you will make an excellent mate." In the dream she said "You are efficient, you will make an excellent mate." I am willing to admit my diagnosis may be premature, but it seems like your mind knew Seven was not herself when she said it. So by changing it you took it from being the repressed personality of the Son of Kvok to being the actual personality of Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>The look on her face was not disbelieving but more an intense desire to disbelieve yet not being able to deny the truth. "B'Elanna, I'm not saying you need to track Seven down and swear the oath, but I am saying that there are feelings there. I don't know if the mating bond started them, or simply brought them to the surface, but I do know she is the key." Her voice sounded low, mournful, but she nodded as she spoke. "What about my bond to Tom?" The normally temperate tones seemed to get a touch of scorn. "Get him a new Captain Proton program, it will keep him busy." She just gave him a look. "First of all you were under the effects of Vorik's Pon Farr, Secondly you resolved those effects in combat with Vorik. Thirdly you've never had dream's about Tom Paris."</P>
<P>She looked up sharply, her mind obviously trying to find the point at which she told him that, but his slightly superior smile told her that he guessed. "Just talk to her B'Elanna. That's all I am suggesting." B'Elanna nodded as she stood up. "Talk, I mean that. No yelling, or teasing, be civil." The conversation carried as the two walked for the door. "Maybe that is a good point to start. Nor matter what happens I think it would be a good thing if you two resolved the animosity." B'Elanna threw a smirk back over her shoulder. "Well I suppose that one of us dying WOULD take care of the dreams one way or another." The half-hearted stern look Chakotay gave her made her laugh as she walked out the doors. </P>
