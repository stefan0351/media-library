<!-- Blood \ Chapter 2 -->

<P>Seven of Nine, one time tertiary adjunct to Unimatrix Zero One poured over the collected data. Her hands moved from touch pad to touch pad on the Federation console with any notice as two blue eyes rapidly scanned multiple displays. While she gave no visible notice to the doors to astrometrics opening she did acknowledge the visitor. "I apologize Doctor, but I am unable to assist you at this time." While she did not look up to see the hologram smile she could hear it in his voice. "Actually, I was hoping I could help you. I couldn't help but notice the medical database being accessed from astrometrics." The Doctor stepped up next to her, and ignored the annoyed expression that flashed across the woman's face.</P>
<P>"We may have only one klingon on board, but I am sure I could answer any questions you have on their physiology. As long as you are not planning on using them to injure or resident klingon." Seven turned to see the Doctor's smirk and arched her brow at him. "I assure you I have no interest in injuring Lieutenant Torres." The Doctor shrugged. "Very well, then why the interest in klingon physiology?" A deep breath was the only answer. "My experience with the infected vinculum has left me with questions about klingon physiology." The Doctor smirked. "I don't think you need to worry. With out any klingon physiology the taste of Torres you got will have no effect."</P>
<P>The former drone's customary head tilt was her answer. "So there are no narcotic or addictive properties inherent in klingon blood?" The Doctor laughed slightly then looked curious. "Why, have you been suffering any lingering effects? Is the Son of Kvok still with us?" Even as she shook her head slightly she was blushing. "No the feelings are entirely my own." The expression on the face of the EMH became inscrutable. "Feelings?" While he was looking right at her she seemed unwilling to look him in the eye, but she did continue. "I find my concentration damaged by the presence of Lieutenant Torres." The expression on his face caused her to continue. "However it is not the typical feelings of antagonism. my psychological as well as physiological responces seem to be more of arousal."</P>
<P>For a second it was as if the Doctor had deactivated his program, but when Seven looked up he was still present, just with a profound look of shock on his face. The EMH seemed to shake himself. "Arousal? I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had made it to that point." While Seven's face appeared calm her eyes seemed pleading. "That is why I am researching the properties of klingon blood. It must have altered my brain chemistry to cause the premature development of those emotions." The Doctor put his hands on Seven's shoulders. "I gave you a complete examination after we reintegrated your personalities. I also paid special attention to your brain chemistry and would have picked up any deviation."</P>
<P>The worried look on her face seemed to get through to the Doctor as he gave her shoulders a squeeze and dropped his hand back down. Before he spoke he took a breath, even though such an act was unnecessary for a hologram. "It is not physiological so it must be psychological, and since we determined that your physiology and psychology were standard the question is if you have experience arousal previously in regards to Lieutenant Torres." The considerable mental abilities possessed by Seven of Nine seemed to be scanning her memory. "All of my previous feelings for Lieutenant Torres were adversarial." Closing his eyes tightly he opened them to capture the blue eyes before him. "Did you go out of your way to avoid Lieutenant Torres?" The expression on Seven's face could only be described as confused. </P>
<P>"The Lieutenant and I worked in many of the same areas, avoiding her would have been difficult." "Yes, but did you try?" The fair features seemed to scrunch up in concentration. "No, I did not. Does this mean I was previously attracted to Lieutenant Torres?" Eyebrows crept up the Doctor's forehead. "That a question only you can answer." She looked hopelessly at the hologram. "What do I do next?" He tried to smile reassuringly. "I'm not abandoning you Seven, but all I can do is present choices. You still have to pick one. Right now the choices are pursue your feelings for Lieutenant Torres, or attempt to ignore them."</P>
