<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 13 -->

<P>Seven arched her brow; it only accenting the confused expression on her face as the speckled face of Neelix grinned back at her. "Mr. Neelix. you seem more jovial then usual." "I am just in a jovial mood." He turned back to his preparation table, but Seven turned to follow his movements. "Mr. Neelix, what were you and B'Elanna speaking of earlier." He head jerked in surprise. "Well now Seven, what B'Elanna and I talk about is between B'Elanna and I." Her brow arched again, but her expression was her typical superior one. "Since B'Elanna sent me away it stands to reason it concerned me." Neelix continued to work on the food he was preparing. "Well if B'Elanna wanted you to know she would tell you."</P>
<P>She stepped closer and his shoulders tensed. "Just because she may not wish to tell me does not mean I should not know." Neelix nodded. "Yes, I suppose that might be right, but I trust B'Elanna enough to let her tell you at the right time." While her voice did not raise it took a hard tone, which had a similar effect. "Insufficient, you will tell me now." Neelix shook his head again and stepped around Seven to one of the refrigeration units. "No Seven, I won't. Have you tried asking B'Elanna?" Her eyes looked down and even with her perfect posture her shoulders seemed to slump. "I did, but she deferred the question and then attempted to use kissing to distract me."</P>
<P>Neelix chuckled at that as Seven continued to keep up with his movement through the kitchen. "It did not work, and neither will this." "This, this what?" Seven stopped and put her hands behind her back. "Tell me what you and B'Elanna were speaking of, now." He shook his head. "No." She lifted her chin up. "Comply." He shook his head. "No." The two locked eyes for a long moment and when their gaze broke Seven strode, or perhaps stormed from the mess hall.</P>

<P>Seven's angry stride carried her from the mess hall to sickbay. Upon entering she noticed she was alone. "Computer, activate the Emergency Medical Hologram." Voyager's holographic doctor flickered to life. "Please state the nature of the medical emergency. Ah, Hello Seven. What can I do for you?" Her voice was clipped and her expression clearly aggravated as she replied. "Have you spoken to Lieutenant Torres?" The Doctor smirked. "LIEUTENANT Torres? She must have done something wrong now." Her expression seemed to grow even more aggravated at the Doctor's jesting. "That is what I am attempting to find out. When did you speak with her last?" The Doctor got a thoughtful expression.</P>
<P>"I have not spoken to B'Elanna since she performed my maintenance several days ago. Several days late I might add, though I'm sure the new engine is keeping the two of you quite busy." Seven shook her head. "The engine would not require her to have a confidential conversation with Mr. Neelix." The eyes of the EMH seemed to light up. "A SECRET conversation?" Seven nodded absently as she mulled over the problem. The Doctor stepped forward and rested a hand on her elbow. "I don't know anything about it right now, but I might be able to help you find out." Her blue eyes were wide and inquiring. "How?" A smile was on the Doctor's face as he replied.</P>
<P>"We'll as the Chief Physician of Voyager many of the crew hold me in close confidence, and while I would never reveal any confidential details we also talk about various sundry things that most of the crew already knows about." Seven arched her brow at the Doctor. "You mean gossip." The smile immediately soured. "Yes, but it could be invaluable in finding out what secret B'Elanna is keeping." The former drone seemed dubious, but she nodded. Which brought the smile shooting back to the Doctor's face.</P>

<P>"Heads up." Chakotay couldn't help but look up at Janeway's warning, but when she smirked he knew he shouldn't have. When his eyes met the eyes of Seven of Nine he knew why. While he had grown fonder of young woman as of late the look on her face set off an internal alert. The way she strode from the turbolift to stand in front of the command chairs was her normal manner, as was the way she linked her hands behind her back. Her face was entirely business however, and Chakotay feared for whoever she was after, especially after he heard the next words from her mouth. "Commander Chakotay, I would like to talk to you." While Janeway kept her normal expression Chakotay detected a twinkle in her eye showed just how much amusement she was having at her second in command's expense.</P>
<P>"Is it important?" He hoped she would say no even as he knew she would say yes. "I must speak to you immediately." All hope of escape vanished as he stood up. Janeway was cheery and bright as she spoke. "Feel free to use my ready room." Both of them nodded, the Chakotay allowed a pained expression to slip through. Which cause Voyager's captain to smile even more. Seven entered the opening doors ahead of Chakotay, which allowed him to hear a comment by Ensign Kim as the doors shut. "Ready Room or Tomb?" The closing door cut off the answering laugh of Captain Janeway. As he turned back Seven was standing in front of him with her back ramrod straight and her hands linked behind her back,</P>
<P>"Commander Chakotay, have you spoken to B'Elanna Torres recently?" He bit his bottom lip and tried to stall. "Define recently." The implant arched. "If you are asking me to define recently you must have spoken to her." He hoped she didn't notice his wince, but the way her brow crept up further she must have yet she stood there like a sentinel, waiting for his response. His nod was both reluctant and slow. "Yes, she stopped by my quarters, actually I asked her to stop by." "Why did you ask her to stop by?" He shrugged his shoulders. "I wanted to talk to her about getting back to the Alpha Quadrant. She and I are still Maquis in the eyes of the Federation."</P>
<P>Seven nodded once. "As Maquis you may face arrest by the Federation." Chakotay nodded in turn. "It's a possibility, the captain assures me that it is a remote one, but I wanted to keep her up to date." "IS there anything I should be aware of?" Chakotay seemed to be relaxing, which caused a slightly concerned look on Seven's face. "I would suggest looking up B'Elanna's record and Federation legal procedure. Since we don't know what will happen it is all probabilities." Her posture seemed relaxed. "Commander Chakotay, I have noticed a steady drop in your body temperature since we started speaking." The commander seemed to consider her words and then smiled. "I'm just glad the conversation has been taken care of." Why would B'Elanna have kept this a secret from me?" The commander shrugged his shoulders and hoped the half-klingon would not hurt him too badly for getting Seven asking even more questions.</P>

<P>Neelix nearly jumped as the Doctor materialized behind him. He did keep enough of his senses to keep the item that had just materialized in the replicator against his body and out of the Doctor's line of sight. "Mr. Neelix! You're looking well." His confusion caused a light amount of stammering. "T.thank you Doctor." "What do you have there?" Neelix strode quickly from the replicator to his kitchen and shoved the item in question into a refrigerator. "Just preparing for the party." "Ahh yes, Our Coming Home Party. How go the preparations?" Detailing his work for the celebration seemed to brighten the Talaxian's mood.</P>
<P>"Things are going wonderfully, ever since Seven and B'Elanna donated all that holodeck time things have been falling into place. We are going to use both holodecks to replicate all of Starfleet academy. It seemed a bit pointless to me since we will seeing the real thing soon enough, but most seemed to want an early taste of home. An emotional appetizer if you will. I trust you will be joining us?" The Doctor smiled. "Have you ever known me to miss a party? I will also enjoy that taste of Earth, especially since the closest I came was the Utopia Plaentia yards. I'm going to have to thank Seven and B'Elanna. Have you seen them today?"</P>
<P>Neelix made a scoffing sound. "I've seen them both one right after another with about 30 minutes between visits. I could ask the captain to include the duties of ships counselor in my duties as morale officer." The Doctor held his hands up in a quieting motion. "So what were you counseling them on?" Neelix took a breath to speak and then stopped. "Sorry Doctor, counselor/patient privilege." The EMH rolled his eyes. "You said you SHOULD be ships counselor, not that you ARE." Neelix shook his head. "None the less. Now if you'll excuse me Doctor I really need to get back to work." The Doctor seemed ready to argue, but turned and left in a huff."</P>
<P>As the doors closed behind the Emergency Medical Hologram Neelix reached into the refrigerator and pulled out a black velvet box and opened it. Inside was a simple silver ring that reminded him of the metal of Seven's implants. It also had an engraving and while he could not read it he already knew what it said. The klingon word for "strength" was first followed by the Terran standard of English word "through". The engraving ended with the Borg symbol for "unity". He closed the box and put it in his pocket. Then he tapped his commbadge. "Neelix to Lieutenant Torres."</P>
