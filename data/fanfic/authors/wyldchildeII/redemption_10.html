<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 10 -->

<P>While B'Elanna had grown accustomed to being watched the look she was currently receiving caused her to flinch. "What?" The exclamation finally caused Seven of Nine to grin as B'Elanna stared at her. "Don't tell me you're not nervous?" Seven tilted her head as B'Elanna paced. "No, I'm not. The design is sound. If there are any problems we will correct them." All of her fidgeting and pacing stopped as she looked at the former drone. "As simple as that huh?" The grin had become Seven's most regular smile. "Yes." "What about Paris and Chakotay?" While Seven's hands were linked behind her back she seemed almost to shrug. "They are accomplished pilots and all possible safety features are established. The most likely difficulty will be in brining the engine online and maintaining it. Catastrophic failure is unlikely."</P>
<P>It was B'Elanna's turn to tilt her head. "Unlikely, but not impossible." Seven's features stayed calm. "The very nature of space travel is based on that acceptance of risk. Just as they accepted the risk when they agreed to be test pilots." B'Elanna resumed her pacing. "So what are you telling me you won't miss them if something DOES happen?" "Quite to the contrary they have been valued members of the crew, and their loss would be damaging. The fact still remains that we needed to test the enhanced engine and they had the skills to do so." B'Elanna ran her fingers through her hair in an aggravated gesture. "That, and they volunteered. Which is what's getting to me. They HATE each other. Even when I was dating Paris they were both holding their tongues out of respect for me."</P>
<P>"Perhaps that same respect is what drove them to volunteer?" The look B'Elanna gave seemed distressed and Seven felt the need to respond. "Though that seems unlikely. The fact they did not volunteer at the same time indicates separate motives." At B'Elanna's questioning look Seven continued. "Mr. Paris was the first to volunteer which would indicate either a desire towards the ship, or it's designer." "You think he doing it for me?" Seven nodded. "To get close to you. I told you I would be vigilant." B'Elanna smiled a bit shyly as Seven continued. "Commander Chakotay volunteered after Ensign Paris which could imply his antagonism is what drove him to volunteer."</P>
<P>"So Chakotay volunteered to protect me from Paris?" Seven arched her brow. "In his perception perhaps, but it is just as likely he is motivated by his dislike of Mr. Paris as much as he friendship with you." B'Elanna seemed stunned a moment, but then grinned ruefully. "I suppose your right about that. Guess have to let the boys be boys?" Seven nodded. "They could be nothing else. We will simply have to deal with any consequences."</P>

<P>"Bringing engines online." Chakotay nodded as he kept one eye on his display and the other on his copilot. "Engines are stable, brining enhancements online." Tom Paris seemed entirely focused on his display as he replied. "Roger that, let's brace for impact." Yet as the steady thrum of the warp engines became a constant hum the two men felt no disturbance. Paris sounded confused as he spoke. "Warp 8, warp 9, war 9.95, and holding. No visible engine stress." Chakotay nodded. "Matter/anti-matter mix at standard, nacelles warm, but holding." The voice of Paris seemed calm, but also seemed more alert. "Better not break out the champagne just yet. Power transfer is starting to back up, then engines are TOO efficient they aren't using everything they are getting."</P>
<P>A calmed breath escaped Chakotay's lungs as he brought up the information that was on Tom's console. "That's because the enhanced engines are on, but you are keeping us at warp 7.8." "What? I'm trying to take the engines off line before they blow us up!" When Chakotay turned his chair to face Voyager's helmsman Paris lifted his hands from his console. "Have a look for yourself." As Chakotay leaned over the console he was keeping one eye on it as well as one eye on Tom Paris which left him unprepared for the console to explode in his face. What he did notice was how Tom Paris was already out of the way as he was hurled back to the cabin floor, and from there he saw the helmsman take his copilot's position and continue to enter commands.</P>
<P>As he lay there one the floor he wasn't sure what got him back up, anger, adrenaline, the fact the explosion seemed to be more sound then furry? He wasn't sure but something had him springing from the floor to crash against the helm where Tom Paris latched onto him. An upraised elbow drove Paris back into the seat as Chakotay felt cartilage bend, but not break. The elbow crashed back again into the nose and this time the cartilage gave way to the pressure as blood started to soak into the uniform black. Knowing he had to end the fight quickly while keeping the shuttle intact he looped one elbow under the chin of Tom Paris while slipping behind him. The forearm began applying crushing pressure to Tom's windpipe and it caused a gurgling sound to come from purpling lips, but Chakotay knew it was not enough.</P>
<P>He could see the helm from his position and the engines were near critical, yet Tom Paris was struggling back with everything he had. The first officer was just glad the man spent more time on the holodeck then he did in the gym. With grim determination he knew what he had to do to save his own life. The arm that was not around the throat of Tom Paris had been bracing the choke, but it let go and grabbed the back of the head of Tom Paris. With an exhaled breath it twisted quickly while pulling upward. There was a sound that reminded Chakotay of his darker days in the Maquis, but to an unblooded listener would sound like Neelix breaking up stalks of one vegetable or another for Voyager's next meal.</P>
<P>Not concentrating on what he had just done he dumped the now lips form to the floor and slipped into the pilot's seat. "Chakotay to Voyager. The engines have been sabotaged and are about to blow. I'm duping the core and need an emergency beam out as soon as I drop out of warp." Janeway's voice answered him. "Acknowledged, what about Ensign Paris?" Chakotay's words were clipped. "He's dead." Janeway's voice was deepened, but controlled as she replied. "Negative, we still read his life signs." At that point Chakotay looked over his shoulder and saw eyes staring at him from a head twisted at an unnatural angle. His lips were a grim line as he turned back to the controls and entered the final commands. As the woosh of the core entering the void of space reached his ears he turned and knelt beside Tom Paris. "Chakotay to Voyager, two to bream out!"</P>

<P>B'Elanna felt strong hands turning her, but knew immediately they did not belong to Seven of Nine. As she was turned around she was looking into the eyes of Voyagers first officer. "Don't feel sorry for him B'Elanna. He was willing to sabotage our trip home, risk my life and his own. He brought it all down on himself." She turned from Chakotay and walked for sickbay's doors. Over her shoulder she heard the first officer's voice. "It's wasn't the engine, and it was not your fault." While B'Elanna did not turn around Captain Kathryn Janeway did. "What the hell happened?" The eyes of Commander Chakotay never left hers. "He tried to sabotage the flight, and when I tried to stop him he attacked me. When I was left between using lethal force and being killed in a warp core breech I chose to use lethal force."</P>
<P>The face of the petite captain was pale, but she nodded. "The Doctor is still in surgery. He says you did quite the job on him. Right now it looks like Paris will live, but only here in sickbay where he can be constantly monitored, and he will probably never have sensation below his neck." The stony silence that greeted the pronouncement might have made Chakotay appear cold, but Janeway could see the big man's eyes and she knew the news rattled him. She reached up and squeezed his shoulder. "You gave B'Elanna some good advice." He nodded as the two of them watched the Emergency Medical Hologram as he drew on every ounce of his programming to repair what took Chakotay mere milliseconds of force to destroy.</P>

<P>B'Elanna staggered down the hallway towards the shuttle bay. Crewmembers saw the dazed look in her eyes and could guess the cause. Her former lover had gotten his neck broken by the first officer. While many had said Tom Paris would get his neck wrung they never thought it literal and if the truth was told they were in shock as well. Of course the fact that the shuttle had been sabotaged had ended up being circulated hand in hand with the news of the helmsman's injury and even as they tried to sort through the feelings the twin events gave them they wondered which one weighed on B'Elanna Torres more. All of the looks and whispered speculation fell of deaf ears as B'Elanna stumbled to the turbolift and then stumbled into the shuttle bay.</P>
<P>The entire crew gathered saw her enter but it was their crew leader Seven of Nine who saw the engineer's state and strode up to her. When she took the engineer in her arms the rest of the crew quickly went back to their work. As she ran a comforting hand through the shorter woman's hair Seven whispered in her ear. "It was not your fault." Torres just nodded as she sank into the embrace. Her head was suddenly pulled from the bosom it nestled to. Radiant blue eyes bore into her own. "Ensign Paris risked his life and Commander Chakotay's along with the best opportunity this crew has had to return to Earth. When he was in danger of getting caught he assaulted Commander Chakotay." The grip remained soft on her face, but still felt stronger on her cheeks.</P>
<P>"The cause for the Ensign's behavior is because he was never held personally accountable, by blaming yourself you support his actions." The eyes that looked back into Seven's were still wet with unshed tears, but the chest rose and fell with several deep, steadying breaths as the nod she gave was far more sure. The hands on her face gave a supportive caress as they turned her to the shuttle and fell away. Though one hand found and held B'Elanna's as it did. "The test did serve its purpose. We learned the engine can take the appropriate stresses. The sabotage actually helped confirm it." Harry Kim picked that point to step from the crew around the shuttle, and B'Elanna was noticeably avoiding his eyes.</P>
<P>The young man stepped close and maneuvered until his eyes caught B'Elanna's. "B'Elanna, I don't blame you, no body does. I knew Tom was going to try something but I didn't think he would be this stupid. Don't feel sorry for him. That was his intent all along. We actually found the he had rigged the pilot's helm to explode before he ever left the ship. Though it was a low power rupture, more the heroic wound kind of thing." The Klingon's almond eyes had gotten wide as Harry continued. "Yeah, then the recorders showed him saying the engine was TOO "efficient". We figure he wanted to discredit Seven by making her look responsible for his injury."</P>
<P>The sorrowful look in her eyes had been replaced by their usual fire. "Then I get mad at Seven and run back to him to nurse him back to health! Nurse him back to health? He'll be lucky if I don't go down to sickbay to finish him off!" Harry shook his head. "When it was learned he risked our ride home most of the crew felt that way." "What about you Ensign Kim?" The two snapped their attention to Seven of Nine who looked at them calmly. Harry paused before he answered. "This was not a case of typical Tom. I mean this could have hurt the whole ship. this could have KILLED Chakotay." The two women continued to look at him. "I've been friends with Tom a long time, and this kind of thing is going to make me take a long look at that." The three nodded, but none of them looked happy about it.</P>
