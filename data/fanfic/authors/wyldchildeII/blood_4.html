<!-- Blood \ Chapter 4 -->

<P>Seven of Nine looked up as she heard a voice speak to her, and found that she was grateful she was in the mess hall consuming her nutritional supplement because it gave her reason to swallow for her suddenly parched throat. "Seven, can I talk to you?" While she was attempting to follow the Doctor's suggestion to ignore her feelings she found it difficult as the object of her emotions sat down across from her. As she did Seven found herself analyzing the subject yet again, though from a far more human perspective. The human/klingon may have possessed a dense musculature, but the greater interest was the way the muscles bunched and flowed under her skin.</P>
<P>Skin that Seven found herself wanting to touch, to see if it were as warm and soft as she thought. That was probably the greatest allure of Lieutenant Torres, she possessed both form and function. Or as she over heard Ensign Paris telling Ensign Kim, style and substance. It did not help that her form seemed to compliment Seven's own. The smaller height being able to allow Seven to hold her close while leaving her head free to continue to look at her. While her analysis continued she saw an unusual expression cross the face of B'Elanna Torres as she started to speak. The only description she could give was rattled. It was a word she had learned from Captain Janeway, and it seemed fitting. </P>
<P>Fitting because Lieutenant Torres seemed to falter under Seven's focused gaze, but showed no desire to leave. She did however take an additional moment to compose herself before she started to speak. "I was looking over the astrometric sensors, and I have to say you have managed to improve them more then Starfleet command ever planned." With out skipping a beat Seven replied. "Starfleet command is in efficient." B'Elanna straightened her shoulder as her expression soured. "I'll have you know I am a Starfleet engineer." "Actually you are a Starfleet trained Maquis engineer serving on a Starfleet ship. You are far more adaptive."</P>
<P>On some level Torres seemed to recognize the compliment as she allowed her expression to relax. Even allowing herself to smile a bit as she responded. "We'll we've managed to out adapt the Borg." Seven gave the engineer another inspection, which seemed to again rattle the engineer. "Actually the Federation's adaptations have been created by other exceptional individuals like yourself." Seven's head took its quizzical tilt as she analyzed Lieutenant Torres. "Are you ill Lieutenant Torres? Your body temperature has been steadily increasing since we have begun talking." B'Elanna's eyes went wide around pupils that had become obviously dilated.</P>
<P>"What? I'm ok. Guess I am just not that hungry." She stood and lifted her plate of untouched food. Seven stood with her and linked her hands behind her back. "Would you like me to accompany you to sickbay?" The auburn waves of her hair ghosted around her head as she shook it. "No, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm just headed back to engineering." At that she turned to put her try in the recycler and nearly ran into another crewmember. As they extracted themselves they mumbled apologies. After seeing her tray disappear in the customary twinkling light she turned around to face Seven, and found her several steps closer. With out thinking she took a step back and bumped into the replicator.</P>
<P>Her bizarre behavior caused Seven to again tilt her head at her. "As you sure you wouldn't like me to accompany you to sickbay?" It almost seemed as if Lieutenant Torres had lost the ability to do anything but look at her and blink, but she finally seemed to regain control of her faculties. "No, no. I'm ok, really. I'm going back to work." With that she turned and walked from the mess hall. Though from the way Seven could see her muscles were moving she seemed just short of running.</P>
