<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 3 -->

<P>The doors to Commander Chakotay's quarters opened to let in a surprise. "Seven? Was there something I could do for you?" While he did not have the experience with the drone that captain did he could still tell that something was bothering her. "Commander Chakotay, from my understanding you have abilities in counseling?" He restrained his eyebrows from rising and simply nodded as she took a breath before speaking again. "I need someone to talk to." He motioned her to take a seat and hid his surprise when she sank down with out a complaint. "I guess the first question is why you are here?" She tilted her head in the all too familiar questioning expression. "I already stated, I need someone to talk to." He shook his head. "If you just wanted someone to talk to you could have went to the captain or the Doctor."</P>
<P>She nodded, but he noticed how her eyes did not seem able to leave the floor. "That is correct. You have both experience in counseling, and experience with the cause of my distress." He dropped his voice another register as it kept its soft tone. "Have you and B'Elanna been fighting again?" It was at that point she made eye contact. "No, and that is the problem." It was Chakotay's turn to look confused, and it must have been apparent because Seven of Nine continued. "I have become accustomed to fighting with Lieutenant Torres. It is this change that is confusing me." "What is the change?" "Hostilities have ceased. While I could have adapted to a lessening, the relations between the Lieutenant and myself seem entirely new." He nodded his understanding. "Was there a specific point that things seemed to change?" Seven seemed to consider for several moments. </P>
<P>"The change seemed to occur around the time we found the wreckage of the duplicated Voyager." Again he nodded. "That's not too surprising. I think the destruction of our duplicates has gotten us all thinking about the paths our lives have taken, and how they could have turned out. We have all faced destruction numerous times, but this time "we" didn't manage to come out on top." She titled her head. "What are you trying to say?"  He took a breath and paused for a moment. "Death is no longer an abstraction, our duplicates showed that it is a very real possibility. Maybe even more so for B'Elanna, she was the first to die." He noticed right away that his statement seemed to upset her and wondered if his thinking of her as a drone was inaccurate. </P>
<P>"Seven, you never seemed to care about B'Elanna's opinion before, why that change?" She looked up and took a breath that seemed unable to steady the emotions twisting around inside her. "Her anger would have been more damaging if I had chosen to acknowledge it." "Wait, more damaging? Your saying that it did effect you?" "Yes." "Now that she is treating you differently you are afraid of being damaged?" She took another, deeper breath. "Yes, she has made her feelings about me quite clear." He tilted his head in a considering manner. "Perhaps, or perhaps those feelings have changed. It could be that her duplicate's death has caused her to reexamine her life. What you need to determine is what you feel towards her." The paling of the already fair skin told Chakotay all her needed to know, but he also knew that counseling was more then recognizing a patient's emotions, but getting them to recognize them as well.</P>

<P>"You followed me." Chakotay grinned, but restrainedly at Seven of Nine. "Not at all, I asked the computer for the location of Lieutenant Torres and took a chance." She actually seemed angry as the first officer stepped closer but he tried to reassure her. "I am just here as emotional support. How are you doing?" The two pulled to the side away from those exiting and entering the mess hall. She was looking at nothing, somewhere past his shoulder. "I find I am apprehensive of her reaction." He shook his head. "For love to truly be love it has to be unconditional. You can't go in there expecting anything from her." "I still fear damaging what good will that has developed." </P>
<P>"Perhaps. I won't lie to you, but I remember you willing to risk your life for Omega, for that perfection. Is B'Elanna worth any less?" Her head shook immediately. "Then go in there. You excel in expressing complex concepts in understandable terms. This is not the same, but it is not very different." Her tension had reached levels that were physically apparent as she clenched and unclenched her hands and then turned and walked through the doors to the mess hall. He followed right behind her and was ready to reach out as Seven nearly swooned. They were looking at what the rest of the mess hall was looking at. B'Elanna Torres was sitting at one of the mess hall's tables and Thomas Eugene Paris was on one knee before her. </P>
