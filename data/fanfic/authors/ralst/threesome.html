<p>B'Elanna stomped around the large room before coming to a stop and glaring at Seven. &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must have done something.&quot; At the ex-Borg's lack of response B'Elanna moved in close and jabbed a finger into her breast bone. &quot;They didn't just exile us from the city for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please remove your hand Lieutenant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not.&quot; Poke. &quot;Until.&quot; Poke. &quot;You tell me.&quot; Poke.</p>

<p>Seven's Borg enhanced hand moved swiftly to imprison B'Elanna's jabbing digit. &quot;If you continue poking me I will break your finger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't threaten me Borg.&quot; B'Elanna ripped her finger from Seven's grasp. &quot;Your pet Captain's not here to save you this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not require saving from the likes of you.&quot; Seven shoved the other woman forcefully, sending her sprawling to the floor.</p>

<p>Recovering quickly B'Elanna pushed herself up off the ground and barrelled towards Seven, her shoulder connecting with the Borg's abdomen and knocking them both to the floor. Having gained the upper hand B'Elanna took full advantage by straddling Seven's narrow waist and attempting to pin her arms. &quot;Oh, so you don't need saving huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; The single word was accompanied by a rapid change in the women's positions, as Seven used her superior Borg strength to dislodge her assailant and trap B'Elanna face down on the floor. With a knee firmly placed in the small of the Klingon's back, Seven captured B'Elanna's wrists in a bruising hold and pulled them both up behind her back, the manoeuvre forcing the seething Klingon's head and chest off the ground. &quot;I believe you are the one who needs saving B'Elanna.&quot;</p>

<p>With a growl of frustration B'Elanna tried to dislodge the weight from her back, but her movements only resulted in more strain being put on her aching shoulders. &quot;You fucking bitch, get your dirty...&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Voyager to Lieutenant Torres.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Seven's brows furrowed at hearing the Captain's voice. She knew rationally that they, or more accurately the lieutenant, had to answer, but a part of her mind screamed at the idea of giving up her advantage over the fiery engineer. She debated the possibility of activating B'Elanna's comm. badge from this angle, it was within reach, but she was afraid that by removing one of her hands from securing her captives, B'Elanna could escape.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Janeway to Torres.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Preferring to set her free rather than have B'Elanna break her hold, Seven released her prisoner.</p>

<p>Rolling away from the ex-Borg's reach B'Elanna gave her a look of fury before, with an aching hand, activating her comm. &quot;Torres here Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Is there something wrong B'Elanna? You took a long time to answer.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;No Captain, everything's fine.&quot; Turning her back B'Elanna tried to ignore the triumphant ex-Borg.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Then can you explain to me why my away team has been banished from the Allayan capital city, and all diplomatic relations between our two cultures severed?&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>The Captain was not sounding happy, but luckily for B'Elanna this time it wasn't her fault. &quot;I think you'd best ask Seven that question Captain, I'm as much in the dark as you.&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Janeway to Seven of Nine.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Captain.&quot; The ex drones voice sounded impassive but on turning to observe the other woman B'Elanna noticed a look in her eyes that promised retribution, for what she wasn't quite sure.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;I want an explanation.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>For all of 0.083 seconds Seven contemplated asking for clarification, but she decided that would simply make Janeway even angrier, so she reluctantly decided to comply. &quot;The Allayan First Minister made several remarks to which I took offence. When, after a polite request for them to cease, they only increased in offensiveness, I hit him, twice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whoooo!&quot; B'Elanna whistled in admiration, the Allayan being an extremely large and fearsome looking race.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;You hit him!&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;Twice.&quot; B'Elanna piped up, strangely proud of the younger woman at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;I also believe I may have broken his jaw.&quot; Seven elaborated, although she realised with a sense of wonder that it was more of a boast for the ears of the chief engineer.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice.&quot; B'Elanna commented, her voice hushed.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Seven, you were there as a representative of the Federation, do you have any idea of the trouble your actions could have caused? You could have both ended up in prison or worse, was whatever he said worth risking your life over?&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;The Allayan do not practice capital punishment.&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;That is not the point!&gt;&gt; Sounds of shuffling could be heard from the other side of the comm. channel as Kathryn began pacing the bridge. &lt;&lt;What exactly did this man say?&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Seven stood up straighter and placing her hands behind her back prepared to give an edited recital of the more colourful aspects of the conversation. &quot;He said he would like to have me stripped of all my clothing and bent over his desk, where he would whip my tight young arse until I was begging him to stop. At that point he would introduce me to his manhood and proceed to ride me until I passed out. Then he planned to take my dark haired companion and have her...&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Seven that's enough, I get the point.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;I have obviously refined some of the terms he used.&quot; Seven clarified.</p>

<p>&quot;The fucking pervert.&quot; B'Elanna swore, wishing she'd had the opportunity to break a few of the man's bones herself.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Enought Lieutenant! Seven, I can understand your repulsion, but couldn't you have found a less physical way of stopping his words?&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not hit him for what he said Captain.&quot; On the bridge of Voyager confused looks passed from one fascinated crew member to another, while down on the planets surface B'Elanna was anxiously staring at the young blonde, impatiently waiting for the rest.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Then why did you hit him Seven?&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe it was an automatic response to his groping my left breast, Captain.&quot; Seven's face had remained impassive as she said this, but B'Elanna's open mouthed stare at her chest made her blush brightly.</p>

<p>&quot;You should've kicked him in the balls.&quot; The Klingon spat.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Seven cocked her head to one side as she retrieved one of the endless facts she had studied about the Allayans. &quot;Although the testis of the male Allayan are located in the interior of their body, behind the pelvic bone. So a kick there would be of little pain or severity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pity.&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;We will talk more about this when you rejoin Voyager, which should be in another eleven hours. Until then do you have anywhere to stay?&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Captain, the Allayans have provided us with a large cabin just outside the city.&quot; Seven looked around the cavernous room without appreciation, it was very like the cargo bay except for the two large beds and a kitchen area. For reasons she could not fathom she had much preferred her original guess quarters, with its luxury and elegance, all most illogical.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Good, we'll be with you in eleven hours, Captain out.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>The interruption now gone the two women looked at each other with a mixture of embarrassment and uncertainty. The information Seven had provided gave B'Elanna an insight into why the young woman had originally pushed her, and it made her ashamed of her subsequent actions. &quot;Look Seven, I'm sorry I poked you like that, especially after the way that slime of a First Minister tried to grope you.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven merely nodded before heading to the back of the room where the beds were located. Another strange fact she had learnt on this mission was that she enjoyed trying to sleep, a procedure the Doctor had encouraged, and although she had still to master the art she found lying down and relaxing most pleasurable. Choosing the bed furthest from the kitchen area, Seven sat down and removed her shoes before stretching out on the springy surface. Her eyes closed she allowed her mind to drift, passing through an array of different images to focus on her encounter with the Allayan First Minister.</p>

<p>B'Elanna had just stood watching as Seven made herself comfy on the bed, her mind supplying the fact that the little starburst implants that covered Seven's ankle bones were rather cute. She also thought that the young woman would be more comfortable if she let her hair down, and was debating whether to say anything when Seven abruptly sat up.</p>

<p>&quot;Can two women fuck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!&quot; B'Elanna nearly choked on her own tongue at the totally un-Seven like word issuing from the blondes mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it anatomically possible for two females to..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah I got that bit.&quot; B'Elanna interrupted, not prepared to hear more obscenities from the almost innocent woman. Walking towards Seven, B'Elanna cursed whatever fate had left this little piece of sex education for her to expand upon, then thinking about it she decided to curse the Captain and Doctor too. &quot;Same sex couples whether they be male or female can, and do, engage in...&quot; B'Elanna stopped to try and think of a more fitting word than the one used in the question, and decided to stick with one Seven understood, &quot;copulation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am aware of that, I wished to know if they could fuck.&quot; Seven pronounced the last word without inflection, making it seem almost alien, an anthropological entity to be studied.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you please stop saying that word!&quot; Reaching the bed B'Elanna slumped down by Seven's feet, not sure what they were now talking about. &quot;Copulation is the same as ff, the other word, it's simply a cruder way of saying it.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven's brow crinkled in an adorable fashion. &quot;I was informed it was something only a real man could bestow, its efficiency related to the size of his penis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; B'Elanna couldn't stop a chuckle at the look of earnestness on Seven's face. &quot;Who told you that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Crewman Lester.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I bet he offered to give you a first hand demonstration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna's mirth subsided as she contemplated a rather distasteful thought. &quot;You didn't do it, did you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, the Doctor informs me that I should be attracted to any sexual partner, preferably that I should also be in love with them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good for the Doc.&quot; B'Elanna decided to thank the EMH the next time she saw him, but then wondered why she should be so thankful for his intervention. &quot;Lester was talking a load of crap, he just wanted to get you into bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, it is just a matter of vocabulary not anatomy.&quot; Seven seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Glad that was over B'Elanna prepared to go explore the kitchen, then a thought struck her. &quot;Seven, why the sudden need to know. I mean your encounter with Lester must have been at least three days ago, if not longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was fourteen weeks, five days ago, but my conversation with the First Minister confused me on the subject.&quot; Seven's eyes slowly travelled the length of B'Elanna's body in an unconsciously erotic manner. &quot;I thought you would know the answer to my question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha..&quot; B'Elanna gulped, her mouth suddenly dry. &quot;What did he say? The First Minister that is.&quot; The question replaced her original thought, 'what made you think I'd know?'</p>

<p>&quot;I am not sure I should repeat his comment, it might anger you.&quot; Seven didn't relish the idea of spending the next eleven hours with a rampaging half Klingon.</p>

<p>&quot;Just tell me.&quot; B'Elanna demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;He said he would like to watch while I copulated with you.&quot; As instructed Seven didn't use the word B'Elanna seemed to find so disturbing, nor did she elaborate on just how he'd suggested she should perform the act. &quot;I have edited my language so as not to anger you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah well I think I can guess at the sort of things he said.&quot; Laying back B'Elanna rested at the foot of the bed, gazing towards the ceiling. &quot;What is it with guys wanting to watch two women? Tom was just the same, although at least he admitted to wanting to be included in on the action.&quot;</p>

<p>The bed moved under B'Elanna as Seven scrambled to her knees to kneel by the other woman's side, leaning forward she entered B'Elanna's line of vision. &quot;Did you engage in this activity while you were dating Mr Paris?&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna was somewhat surprised at the look that crossed Seven's face as she spoke, it was a mix of rampant curiosity, hunger and possibly envy. Sitting up slightly, her weight supported by her elbows, B'Elanna gave the young Borg a superior look. &quot;That is none of your business Seven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it with one of the Delaney sisters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never said I did it.&quot; B'Elanna noticed that Seven had gotten even closer with that last question, and she was starting to feel rather hot. &quot;And if I did it, it wouldn't be with one of the Delaney sisters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one, all right, can we change the subject now?&quot; It was true, Tom had hinted or just plain begged on a number of occasions but she'd never agreed, sex wasn't a spectator sport or a team event, even if she had sometimes wondered what it would be like.</p>

<p>&quot;Then who would you have liked to do it with?&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna's face was getting hotter and hotter, but the idea of simply standing up and moving away from the blonde never occurred to her. &quot;I never said I wanted to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do not find females physically attractive?&quot; Seven looked at her in disbelief.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't say that.&quot; The temperature in the room was definitely increasing. &quot;I just prefer having sex with only two people in the room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot; Seven raised her head to survey the large room.</p>

<p>&quot;You know it's not polite to grill someone about their sex life, I mean how would you like it if I started asking you these types of questions?&quot; The words out of her mouth B'Elanna acknowledged the fact that she would indeed like to find out more about the younger woman's sexual and romantic history, not to mention whether or not she was attracted to women.</p>

<p>&quot;I have no objections to you asking me anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine.&quot; B'Elanna's mind was assailed with hundreds of different questions, each demanding to be the one chosen. &quot;Are you attracted to women?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever engaged in a threesome?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would you want to?&quot; God why couldn't she elaborate just once.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; Damn, that meant B'Elanna couldn't ask who she would choose.</p>

<p>&quot;How many sexual partners have you had?&quot; At least with this question B'Elanna hoped to get some useful data, but just to make sure she added. &quot;And who were they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have not had sex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never?&quot; The question was practically yelled in Seven's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet, no.&quot; With a tiny smile and penetrating gaze Seven added. &quot;But soon I hope.&quot;</p>

<p>The room was getting much too hot for B'Elanna, and she thought that perhaps the oxygen levels had decreased as her breathing became laboured. Checking her theory B'Elanna watched Seven breath, the pronounced movement of the woman's breasts supported her theory, but the sight of the heaving chest so close was sending even more heat to B'Elanna's body, her cheeks flushing a deep red.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you all right B'Elanna?&quot; Seven questioned, moving so her arms were on either side of B'Elanna's body she looked closely at the flushed face.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine.&quot; It was a lie.</p>

<p>&quot;You look hot, perhaps you should remove some of your clothing?&quot; Seven then began to unfasten B'Elanna's uniform top.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am helping to remove your clothing.&quot; Seven had the uniform undone and was pushing it off B'Elanna's shoulders. &quot;You will need to sit up to fully remove your jacket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you trying to seduce me Seven?&quot; Passivity and confusion had lasted long enough, B'Elanna wanted to know what was going on.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I thought it was time one of us did.&quot; Having gotten as far as she could with B'Elanna's uniform jacket Seven turned her attention to locating and opening the button on the trousers.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Sitting forward B'Elanna dislodged Seven's fingers from the waistband of her trousers, and scooting to the edge of the bed she stood up. Straightening her arms she allowed the jacket to fall to the floor before turning back to a pouting Seven, sitting forlornly on the bed. &quot;Come here.&quot; B'Elanna whispered, at which Seven's face lost its pout and she began shuffling on her knees to the very edge of the bed, directly infront of B'Elanna. Reaching behind Seven's head B'Elanna pulled out the pin that kept the hair in a tight bun, then with aching slowness she began running her fingers through the silken locks, marvelling at the feel of the golden tresses.</p>

<p>&quot;Did my seduction work?&quot; Seven asked, her voice barely audible as her whole mind constricted to concentrate on the single sensation of fingers running through her hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I believe it did.&quot; Leaning forward B'Elanna gently placed her lips against Seven's, the contact brief and teasing. &quot;Now you get to sample my style of seduction.&quot; Taking a step back B'Elanna reached down and grasping the edge of her t-shirt pulled it over her head, before resuming her place millimetres from the rapt ex Borg.</p>

<p>&quot;You do not have to seduce me, I already want to be with you.&quot; Seven's eyes feasted on the newly revealed skin, unconsciously licking her lips at the sight of the raised nipples straining against the white silk.</p>

<p>&quot;Believe me Seven you'll enjoy it.&quot; B'Elanna purred, and began to trail a hand down her own body, brushing the side of her right breast, the teasing fingers continued their decent to a toned abdomen, stopping briefly to encircle her belly button before descending further to slip under the waist band of her trousers. Seven's eyes followed the movement as if hypnotised, and as the trousers released and fell forgotten to the floor B'Elanna witnessed a look of pure lust consume the young woman's face. &quot;Tell me Seven, are you enjoying my seduction so far?&quot; Seven simply nodded as B'Elanna's finger continued down to brush against the front of her panties.</p>

<p>Eyes glued to where one of B'Elanna's hands caressed their own thigh, Seven was startled as a white silk bra fell to the floor beside her. Looking up she witnessed the perfection of B'Elanna's breasts, firm, full and tantalisingly close, the darker brown of erect nipples begging for attention. Reaching up to touch the flawless skin Seven's hand was captured by B'Elanna, the fingers brought to a waiting mouth where one disappeared inside to be lavished with attention.</p>

<p>Seven's moan of pleasure brought a smile to B'Elanna's lips as she withdrew the tapered finger from her mouth. &quot;Did you like that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven's hand still grasped in her own B'Elanna moved it down to the edge of her panties. &quot;Help me take these off.&quot;</p>

<p>Bringing up her second hand Seven eagerly obliged, her fingers slipping under the delicate material and easing it over toned hips to gently caress B'Elanna's thighs on the way to the ground. Leaning forward she lowered the panties further, allowing B'Elanna to step out. Seven's face came to rest against a silky thigh, the caramel skin soft against her cheek, its warmth permeating her skin. Then as B'Elanna's hands began to push her back up into a sitting position Seven took the opportunity and placed a kiss on the sensitive thigh.</p>

<p>The feel of full lips brushing her skin was almost the end of B'Elanna's plans for a slow teasing seduction. Her Klingon passions called for her to just throw Seven to the bed, and satisfy both their needs, her teeth aching to sink into tender flesh and claim it for her own. Still she held back, wanting to watch the woman she had once thought cold and emotionless, be consumed with desire, desire for her. Taking a step back she reached out a hand to Seven. &quot;Stand up.&quot; B'Elanna commanded in a voice deep with passion.</p>

<p>Seven stood, her chest brushing against B'Elanna's aching nipples as she did so, the sharp intake of breath a sign to the young ex-Borg that B'Elanna was as excited and ready as she was. This was all so new to Seven, but instead of being afraid, she revelled in each new sensation, every sight or touch revealing a glimpse of heaven.</p>

<p>&quot;Take it off.&quot; B'Elanna indicated the biosuit with her eyes, she would have loved to remove it herself but she had no idea how to do so.</p>

<p>Seven stretched back her arm to release the suits fastening, the material parting too slowly for the young woman's needs, she tugged at the offending garment.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; B'Elanna whispered, her hands going up to still Seven's agitated movements. &quot;Don't rush things, we have all night.&quot;</p>

<p>Releasing her grip on the material it opened quickly, earning a silent 'thank you' from Seven, who had been delighted at the promise of a night of passion, but was still desperate for it to proceed. Wiggling her shoulders the biosuit started to come loose, falling down the slope of her breasts to fall towards her waist, the material catching B'Elanna's sensitive flesh on its decent.</p>

<p>The sharp contact the suit made on its way down caught B'Elanna's breath, but the sight now before her eyes made her forget to breath altogether. Creamy white skin sculpted to form two generous breasts, their roundness crested by rosy pink nipples stiff with arousal. Desperately needing contact, but still trying to prolong the seduction, B'Elanna settled for taking hold of the suit that lay bunched at Seven's hips, and easing it on further, the garment falling to puddle at their feet. Stepping back B'Elanna marvelled at the beauty of the woman before her, pale skin was highlighted by a pattern of metal implants, as if the body had been adorned with jewels.</p>

<p>&quot;You are so beautiful.&quot; The thought had been B'Elanna's, but the words came from Seven as she watched the appreciation in the deep brown eyes. That someone as beguiling as the half Klingon could look at her with such desire was truly amazing to the younger woman, and knowing the sight of her scared and adorned body did not cool that passion made her want to cry with joy.</p>

<p>Closing the gap between them B'Elanna lifted her hands to gently caress the sides of Seven's face, her fingers paying special attention to the Borg implants. &quot;You are the beautiful one.&quot; Seeing a protest forming, B'Elanna sealed her words with a kiss, at first sweet and gentle but soon passionate and demanding.</p>

<p>Seven's eyes closed of their own accord as sweet lips joined her own in their second kiss, this time the touch not fleeting. At first B'Elanna's lips just grazed her own before coming back to once again tease with their caress, but then they became bolder, more forceful. A tongue brushed her lips and was soon given entry, the velvet caress producing a groan from deep in her throat. Arms were encircling her, pulling them closer, bringing their bodies into sweet contact.</p>

<p>As they embraced B'Elanna could feel the hard points of Seven's nipples against her skin, and smell the arousal from both their bodies. Time for teasing had past, her need was now too strong, the feel of Seven's hand trailing down to cup her buttock, the cue to take things further. Breaking from the kiss B'Elanna smiled at the still closed eyes of her lover, waiting a moment for ocean blue to come out from hiding and focus on her face. &quot;Bed.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a single word but it had a big effect on Seven, who grasped B'Elanna's compliant arm and pull the other woman with her onto the mattress. Pushing them both down into the sheets Seven rolled over to lay against B'Elanna's side, her arm acting as a support as she lowered herself for another kiss. One kiss turned into two and then a third, before Seven left the tempting lips to create a path of kisses down B'Elanna's neck culminating in a playful nip to the darker skin.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmmmmm.&quot; The sound was definitely a purr and the accompanying arching of her back almost catlike as B'Elanna felt the teeth dig into her flesh. Turning she dislodged Seven, who ended up lying on her back, a horny Klingon straddling her waist. &quot;We seem to have been here before.&quot; B'Elanna commented with a smile, remembering the fight that seemed to have happened so long ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Seven's fingers began to trace a path up the length of B'Elanna's body, starting at the base of her back they first dipped lower to caress the firm behind before moving upwards to pass fleetingly along the ribs to the underside of firm round breasts. Cupping the precious flesh she let her thumbs pass teasingly over the nipples, the whimper from above making sure she repeated the manoeuvre with the same agonising feather like touch.</p>

<p>&quot;No you don't.&quot; Capturing Seven's hands B'Elanna forced them to lie flat against the mattress, before placing a kiss on full lips, then moving on to sample the creamy smooth skin of the elegant neck. Paying special attention to the starburst implant B'Elanna let her tongue trace the intricate pattern of metal and skin, before leaving it with a kiss to continue her exploration. Lips soon found their way to the swell of a tempting breast, eliciting a whimper from deep within Seven's chest. Slowly B'Elanna began planting kisses around the full breast, making sure to avoid touching the aching nipple. One hand moving down to perform a similar dance across Seven's other breast, short nails producing a rippling of sensation that went straight to Seven's already over heated centre.</p>

<p>&quot;OhhhhhhhhB'Elannnnnaaaa.&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the unspoken plea B'Elanna lowered her mouth to engulf the hard pink nipple, her tongue lavishing it was attention before raking her teeth against the sensitised peeks.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeeesssssss...&quot; Seven's body arched in pleasure, the smell of arousal that surrounded them making her head swim with need.</p>

<p>B'Elanna's hand began to trace erotic patterns across a taunt stomach as she explored the quivering body, her fingers caressing ever lower.</p>

<p>&quot;PleeeeaaaassssePleeeaasssssss.&quot; Seven begged, her body in desperate need of release.</p>

<p>Abandoning Seven's kiss wet nipples, B'Elanna looked into the beautiful face of her future lover. &quot;Seven, look at me.&quot; The voice was deep but the words softly spoken, the tone penetrating Seven's rapture and electric blue sought out soulful brown. &quot;I just had to see your beautiful face.&quot; Fingers dipped lower and entered Seven's welcoming folds.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhhhhhhhhh.&quot; At the first touch emotions were unleashed and the meaning of pleasure redefined as Seven basked in all the new sensations. Life as a Borg had never prepared her for the wonders being bestowed by this intoxicating half Klingon.</p>

<p>Velvety smoothness engulfed B'Elanna's hand as she rubbed against the slick peeks of Seven's most intimate flesh. Heat radiated from Seven's very centre as the movements increased and the young woman's cries of pleasure gained volume. &quot;Do you want more?&quot; B'Elanna asked, her finger teasing the edge of Seven's entrance but not wanting to trespass in this most sacred of depths.</p>

<p>&quot;Yesss.&quot; The word was met with a delicious feeling of being filled, of being whole, as her walls closed in to mould around the welcome invader. Slow careful strokes set off a new set of feelings and led to an increasing demand, &quot;Faster, please, faster.&quot; Seven didn't know how she knew what she needed but as the pace increased and the pressure built she knew she'd been right.</p>

<p>B'Elanna's fingers increasing in speed and depth as she watched the cascade of emotion pass across Seven's face. Blonde hair pasted to flushed cheeks as eyes squeezed shut in impending release, B'Elanna didn't think she would ever see a more beautiful sight. She was soon proven wrong.</p>

<p>Body straining Seven was on the precipice of release, needing just one more thing to send her over into a land of unknown bliss. With the telepathy of lovers of a lifetime B'Elanna entered a second finger, her thumb searching out swollen peeks. The pressure grew and multiplied until finally the world stopped, only to come tumbling down in a tidal wave of orgasm, &quot;Beeelllaaannnnnaaaaaa...&quot; As the name tore from Seven's lips her eyes opened to stare unfocused at her beautiful lover, at that moment the two joined by bonds stronger than friendship and foreshadowing deep love.</p>

<p>With gentle words B'Elanna coaxed the exhausted blonde back to wakefulness, sharing brief kisses of thanks and promise. &quot;You okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I think I am well passed just being okay.&quot; Seven smiled one of her rare smiles as she embraced her glistening lover. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was my pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>Her breathing returning to normal Seven began to place butterfly kisses along B'Elanna's neck, her lips stopping a whisper from her ear. &quot;Speaking of your pleasure..&quot; Seven's mouth descended to place a claim on the caramel neck, teeth greeting skin to guarantee her mark.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot;</p>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Eleven hours and twenty three minutes after being unceremoniously thrown out of the Allayan capital city, B'Elanna and Seven materialised on Voyager's transporter pad. Captain Janeway and Harry Kim had won the raffle to see who greeted the disgraced ambassadors, all aboard anxious to hear more about Seven's encounter with the lecherous politician, it had been a slow week.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, B'Elanna, its good to have you back in one piece.&quot; Kathryn greeted before getting a closer look at the bruise forming on the young blonde's pale neck. &quot;My God, did they hit you?&quot; Instinctively she moved forward to touch the damaged skin, but seeing her approach B'Elanna stepped infront of the ex drone.</p>

<p>&quot;She's fine Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>Now that she was closer Kathryn could also see the bruising that was peeking out over the rim of the Klingon's uniform collar. &quot;Don't tell me you've been fighting again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well not lately anyway.&quot; B'Elanna added.</p>

<p>&quot;Then how?&quot; The idea that was forming in Kathryn's mind was too strange to even contemplate. &quot;Have you..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me Captain.&quot; Seven interrupted. &quot;Could we reconvene the briefing until after we have had time to shower and consume our nutritional supplements?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I...&quot; Kathryn decided she also needed some time to erase the strange ideas from her mind. &quot;Yes, dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p>With a nod to Harry both women exited the transporter room.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I own Tom a weeks replicator rations.&quot; Harry grumbled good naturedly, but seeing Janeway's look of enquiry he elaborated. &quot;Tom bet me they'd get together by the end of the month, I thought it would take a lot longer, but he was right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get together?&quot; Janeway managed to do a good impression of a two year old child experimenting with words.</p>

<p>Harry wondered if the Captain could really not know of the rampant speculation about the two women, especially as you only had to look at them fighting to see how badly they wanted one another. &quot;Yeah, you know become lovers.&quot;</p>

<p>Janeway turned an interesting shade of green before exiting the room at a dead run.</p>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Having arrived at deck eight the turbolift stopped to allow Seven to exit, but its doors were prevented from closing as B'Elanna half followed her out of the lift.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, can I take you to dinner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes B'Elanna, I will meet you there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I don't mean share a meal.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven was confused. &quot;You do not wish to eat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I just..&quot; Exiting the lift B'Elanna took hold of Seven's hand. &quot;I'm asking you out on our first date. I realise it won't be the candle lit occasion that I would have liked, but I want to spend the time with you as a couple, not two colleagues catching a bite to eat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A couple?&quot; As Seven thought about this a smile edged her full lips. &quot;I like the sound of that, and our first date.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good.&quot; Placing a chaste kiss to Seven's lips B'Elanna turned to go. &quot;I'll pick you up in an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is one thing you should know Lieutenant.&quot; Seven said in a Borg monotone.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that Seven?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't go all the way on a first date.&quot; With a wink Seven turned and headed for her cargo bay.</p>

<p>A goofy smile on her face B'Elanna went to prepare for her date.</p>
