<!-- Touch \ Part 4 -->

<P>Late the following afternoon Janeway called a senior staff meeting to discuss the situation with Edwards. Having decided to involve them in the hunt for what, at the time, she thought was a peeping tom, it now seemed appropriate, especially for Edwards future amongst the crew, to explain as fully as they were able the real reasons behind the Lieutenant's actions. The situation had also brought to light several changes in ships business that needed to be discussed, and she was hoping for suggestions for a candidate to fill a long overdue post.</P>
<P>As the senior officers filed in Janeway noticed an obvious change in their demeanour from the last meeting. Tom, who had barely seemed to register any need for concern at Seven's accusations, now displayed a serious and troubled face, as if someone had taken the time to point out to the helmsman what an invasion of privacy being stalked like that actually was. Next to Tom sat his most probable enlightener, Harry Kim, who having missed the confrontation with Edwards was still angry at the man and determined to see him punished to the full extent of Federation law, a subject he had spent much of the previous night studying. Tuvok sat as impassive as always, his countenance echoed in that of Commander Chakotay and, in a drastic change from his obvious concern and agitation at the previous meeting, the Doctor. The biggest change Kathryn noticed was in the attitudes of B'Elanna and Seven, one had been hostile and fuelled by anger, while the other confused and sad. Now as she watched Kathryn saw the smiles that fought for release on each of their faces, and more than that there was a certain lightness to their countenance, and sparkle in their eyes that could not completely be explained by Edwards capture.</P>
<P>"Captain?" Chakotay interrupted her speculation, indicating the meeting was now ready for her to begin.</P>
<P>"Thank you Commander." Janeway surveyed the people sitting around her, a small smile on her lips an indication of happier news, or at least that was the impression she hoped to achieve. "I expect you all know why we are here, the individual responsible for spying on, and touching Seven has been apprehended. Lieutenant Richard Edwards is currently in sickbay, recov..."</P>
<P>"You hit him?" Tom blurted to the two women sat opposite him, his tone one of joy and vicarious excitement, although his eyes did travel in confusion from one face to the other trying to guess which had actually thrown the punch.</P>
<P>"No." Seven replied calmly, although the question did remind her of one Lieutenant Williams with whom she had unfinished business. </P>
<P>"As I was saying." Janeway's raised voice was enough to curb Tom's more obvious excitement at the thought of a fight. "Lieutenant Edwards is currently recovering from what in layman's terms I would call a breakdown." The EMH was about to step in with the correct terminology for what he believed was afflicting the Lieutenant, but refrained, knowing the language would most likely pass over most of their heads anyway. "His actions towards Seven were, we now believe, a result of long standing emotional problems brought on by severe trauma. For that reason Commander Tuvok, Seven and I have decided that it would be best to refrain from pressing charges in this matter."</P>
<P>"Excuse me Captain?" Harry butted in, his data pad full of Federation legal precedents clutched in his hand. "I don't understand how you can let the man get away with sexually assaulting Seven, just because he's a bit..." Harry wavered between his distaste at what he thought Edwards had done and his natural empathy for those suffering emotional difficulties. "A bit unsettled."</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim." Speaking for the first time, Seven caught the attention of all those around the table, and calmed Harry's rising temper at the same time. "Lieutenant Edwards did not assault me, sexually or otherwise." Looking over at B'Elanna she wondered why all these individuals seemed to have a fixation with the sexual nature of touch, admittedly she had been think of little else for the past eight hours, but still she was uncertain why they all assumed that any unwanted contact was sexual in nature. She would ask the Doctor and research the phenomena at a later date. "He was attempting to secure my safety."</P>
<P>"Huh?" Harry's eloquence was joined by a confused look from Tom, and even B'Elanna was unsure of exactly what Seven meant, having missed the mornings lengthier session between Edwards, Seven, the Doctor and Chakotay.</P>
<P>"I think it best if you explain it from the beginning Doctor." Janeway broke in, again taking control. "The shorter version." She added quickly seeing the man puff up his holographic lungs in preparation for a two hour operetta.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain." The EMH collected his thoughts before continuing. "Seven and a half years ago Lieutenant Edwards was stationed with his family on the USS Cassiopeia, a long range science vessel, at that time he was a member of security and his wife a research immunologist. They had one child, a little blonde haired girl called Laura, who was on the ship with them. It appears the Cassiopeia came into contact with a Borg scout ship, one of the smallest vessels used by the Collective, and during the altercation almost half of the ships personnel were either killed or assimilated before they were able to hide behind a nebulous gas formation. Edwards daughter Laura was one of those assimilated."</P>
<P>"So that's why he attacked Seven?" Tom asked, never one to wait patiently for a story to unfold.</P>
<P>"He did not attack me!" Seven's words were becoming more forceful as the constant interruptions began to wear on her patience.</P>
<P>"If I was allowed to continue you might find your questions already answered." The Doctor spared the helmsman a condescending look, wondering for the 1,736th time why such a man had been assigned as his medical backup. "The trauma caused by his daughters assimilation was compounded by his temporary separation from his wife, which became permanent when he along with the rest of us was stranded in the Delta quadrant. The speed with which he transferred from his old ship to Voyager, and the hectic nature of the first months, or I could say years, in the Delta quadrant meant that he never allowed himself to grieve properly for his lost child." Stopping a moment the EMH remembered his own holo-family, and although he had only been with them a short time he in some tiny way was able to empathise with the man, having also experienced the loss of a child. "Our not infrequent encounters with the Borg only added to his bottled up feelings of grief and anger, but when Seven joined the crew he recognised in her another child that had been taken from her parents, and I think in some way seeing her returned to humanity alleviated some of his grief, while at the same time instilling within him a need to protect her safety."</P>
<P>"In a way Seven became a replacement figure for his lost child." Chakotay added for clarification.</P>
<P>"Precisely." The Doctor looked over at Seven, and with a smile continued. "It is plainly obvious that Seven isn't a child, so although linked in his mind with his daughter, Edwards was able to easily distinguish between the two and carry on his duties mostly unaffected. Then three separate events occurred to 'tip him over the edge', firstly we rescued the four Borg children, but instead of identifying them with his daughter, Edwards began to see Seven as both a representation of his child and as a parent, like himself, of Borg assimilated children."</P>
<P>"Sounds to me like he's ready for a rubber room." Came another interruption from Tom.</P>
<P>Ignoring him, but putting the count up to 1,737, the Doctor went on. "Secondly he received a communication from his wife in the Alpha quadrant, in which she informed him that she had remarried having thought him dead." Janeway made a slight wince at this, the news too closely resembling her own from Mark. "Finally, three of the Borg children, including Mitzoti a girl only a few years older than his own when she was taken, left the ship. Now in Edwards mind he believed the children had been reassimilated by the Borg, and so to protect Seven, his substitute daughter, from suffering the same fate, he decided to protect her at the time she was most vulnerable, while she slept."</P>
<P>"I can understand him wanting to look out for Seven when she was regenerating, but why did he touch her?" B'Elanna questioned.</P>
<P>"It was my hair." Seven turned to talk directly to B'Elanna. "His daughter had golden coloured hair, and apparently as he stood watching me my hair reminded him of his daughters. So he did what he used to do with her when she fell asleep, he brushed the hair from her face and told her he loved her. Or in this case brushed my hair, and told me he loved me." There was a yearning in Seven's big blue eyes as she told this to her friend, a wish to remember her own father ever having shown as much love and attention towards her.</P>
<P>Reaching across the table B'Elanna rested her hand on Seven's for a moment, "I can understand that." </P>
<P>"So what happens to him now? Edwards I mean." Harry asked, his anger and list of Federation laws forgotten.</P>
<P>"The Doctor and Commander Chakotay have both offered to help counsel Edwards, and Seven and Icheb have also volunteered to talk and listen to him, when the need arises." Janeway looked agitated at this part of the meeting, the fact that a man had been suffering like this for years aboard her ship and no-one, including herself, had noticed anything or in anyway tried to help made her feel useless. She just wondered how many others were suffering in silence. "This brings up an important matter I wanted to discuss, the lack of a ships counsellor. This incident has displayed the very real need for a trained professional who would be able to handle, not just the past trauma's of the crew, but those we are forced to endure on a seemingly regular basis whilst in the Delta quadrant."</P>
<P>"How do you propose to find a trained professional?" B'Elanna asked sceptically, then with a sense of dread added. "You're not suggesting handing over the ships emotional well being to a hologram? No offence Doctor, I meant a normal hologram not you."</P>
<P>"No offence taken." In fact he was quite pleased at the engineers classification of him as not a normal hologram.</P>
<P>"No, I wanted suggestions of possible candidates for training, although some of that will of necessity be done on the holodeck." Both B'Elanna and Seven's attitude towards non-sentient holograms always left Kathryn feeling slightly soiled, so she moved the conversation on quickly. "I thought if any of you knew of someone who had shown a natural inclination to this type of profession I could approach them about beginning a training program. With our now more regular communication with the Alpha quadrant we might even be able to put them in contact with a trained counsellor there to help with any problems."</P>
<P>"Chakotay has experience with this sort of thing, but I guess he doesn't really have the time to take on that kind of role." B'Elanna thought out loud.</P>
<P>"Correct, it will be a full time job, especially at the beginning." Janeway clarified.</P>
<P>"I suppose that would take Neelix out of the running too, what with him already being chef, moral officer and diplomat." Harry added with a smile.</P>
<P>"I would suggest Tal Celes from Astrometrics." Seven offered.</P>
<P>"Is that because you think she'd be good, or you just want her out of your hair?" B'Elanna asked her with a smile.</P>
<P>Seven put on her most superior glare and replied, "Both." Before returning the half Klingon's smile.</P>
<P>"I must agree, after working with her on an away mission I think she'd be a good choice for counsellor, she seemed genuinely interested in people and had a desire to help." Kathryn looked around the table once more. "Anyone else?" When no further names were forthcoming Janeway looked ready to adjourn. "In that case I shall approach her about the position, and inform you later of her response. If that's all?"</P>
<P>"Actually Captain there is something else." B'Elanna got in quickly. "The incident with Edwards has highlighted the situation as regards Seven and Icheb's living quarters."</P>
<P>"What situation?"</P>
<P>"Well basically that they don't have any." With a look to Seven B'Elanna continued. "As it stands neither of them has any privacy while they sleep, or any space in which to relax or even just sit without interruption. That is a problem not shared by anyone else onboard, and from what the Doctor has told me, both Seven and Icheb will eventually need to start sleeping normally as well as continuing shorter periods of regeneration. Therefore they need quarters in close proximity to the Borg alcoves."</P>
<P>"I see." Janeway looked over to Seven to gage her reaction, the ex-Borg's eyes were transfixed on B'Elanna, a small smile edging up her lips. "Do you have a proposal for these new quarters?"</P>
<P>"Yes Captain." B'Elanna handed over a data pad, one she had worked on most of the night when sleep had proven unattainable, at least without the blonde resting beside her. </P>
<P>"You have?" Seven questioned, pleased that the other woman would expend so much energy on her.</P>
<P>"Here." B'Elanna passed a data pad with a duplicate set of designs to Seven. "The construction would actually be quite simple, we would use the sides of the cargo bay to form two of the walls then just add the other two outer walls and the room divisions. My people could most likely have it completed within two days."</P>
<P>"Fine." The Captain set the designs down more than satisfied with the details, turning to Seven she just needed the young woman's opinion before giving the go ahead. "What do you think Seven, is the space adequate?" At the use of one of the ex-Borg's most frequently used words Kathryn couldn't hold back a smile.</P>
<P>"It is more than adequate Captain." Seven's finger traced the lines that made up the design of her quarters. "It is a home."</P>
<P>"Good. Start work on Seven's new 'home' immediately Lieutenant." With that business was concluded and the staff meeting was adjourned.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>For two days Seven and Icheb avoided entering Cargo Bay 2, the one time they had attempted to enter a flustered engineering detail, led by the Chief Engineer, had practically thrown them out, with admonishments to 'wait until its finished'. The logical argument that they need to enter in order to regenerate were pushed aside, and once outside the doors to the cargo bay they were directed to sickbay where the Doctor had readied a portable regeneration unit.</P>
<P>"It is impractical for Seven and I to take turns using this inferior regeneration unit when our own are perfectly serviceable in Cargo Bay 2." Icheb complained to the EMH on the second day.</P>
<P>"That would spoil the surprise." </P>
<P>"What surprise?" The young man looked confused. "We already know they are constructing quarters for us, I have even see the designs, so how can that be a surprise?"</P>
<P>"You may have seen the designs, but not the finished building." The Doctor would never get used to the ex-Borg seeming lack of the dramatic. "Lieutenant Torres wishes to present it to you complete, so you can enjoy it properly."</P>
<P>"I believe Seven would rather enjoy spending time with Lieutenant Torres, and wait for the completion of our quarters." </P>
<P>"Really?" The Doctor looked around sickbay, making sure they couldn't be overheard before he began digging for gossip. "They did appear to be on much more friendlier terms recently."</P>
<P>"Apparently."</P>
<P>"I suppose that means they've been seeing a lot more of each other, before the Lieutenant began construction that is." The Doctor tried again.</P>
<P>"Indeed."</P>
<P>"So did Seven mention if they were planning on..." The Doctor took a moment to think, questioning adolescent ex-Borg males about their guardians love life was not as easy as he had hoped. "Extending their friendship."</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"I give up." This was positively the last time he tried to engage former members of the Collective in gossiping.</P>
<P>"Three nights ago Seven returned from being with Lieutenant Torres in a highly agitated state." The boy linked his arms behind his back as if giving a recital to the Borg Queen. "Her temperature was increased, her eyes still marginally dilated and her breathing rapid. I deduced from this she had either been involved with a violent altercation or had engaged in some form of sexual activity. From the look on her face, and the absence of injuries, I concluded that she and Lieutenant Torres had formed a sexual bond."</P>
<P>The Doctor just stared at the boy, silently taking back all he had said about not gossiping with former drones, the lad was a natural. Then his mind turned to the information he had retrieved, he had long come to the realisation that his own feelings for Seven would never be returned with anything beyond friendship, and was glad that she had finally found someone who she could share her feelings with. He liked and respected B'Elanna, although he would never tell her so in those words, and thought it a good, if on the surface odd, match. "I think Seven and B'Elanna would appreciate it if you didn't share these assumptions with anyone else until they are ready to have any relationship between them known." Surpressing gossip was contrary to his natural instinct, or some glitch in his program, but the EMH didn't want to be the one to have to reattach any of Icheb's severed limbs if B'Elanna found out he was innocently spreading rumours.</P>
<P>"I will comply." Icheb slipped back into true Borg vocabulary only when he was confused, and the person who had just spent the last few minutes trying to get him to talk about Seven's relationship now telling him he shouldn't, was confusing.</P>
<P>Just then Seven entered sickbay, "Icheb, I have been informed by Captain Janeway that our quarters are ready. You may resume regenerating in your Borg alcove." The clipped nature of Seven's speech was due to her disappointment that B'Elanna herself hadn't contacted her with news of the completion, she had hoped to finally spend some time with the other woman.</P>
<P>"Acceptable."</P>
<P>"Doctor, the Captain informs me that it is customary to hold a 'house warming party' when you move into new accommodation." A raised ocular implant signified Seven's own thoughts on the warming of her home. "Therefore you are invited to attend the event tomorrow evening, 1800 hours."</P>
<P>"I would be delighted."</P>
<P>Without anything further the two ex-Borg left sickbay.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Entering Cargo Bay 2 the two former drones were met by silence, the large rooms lights set to minimum, and tools still in evidence around the outer perimeter of what they knew must be their new quarters. Seven's heart was heavy, despite the prospect of viewing her new home. She had hoped B'Elanna would be there to greet her, the past two days had been interminably long as she waited for contact, her usually disciplined mind constantly betraying her to slip into memories and fantasies about the fiery Klingon. A glimmer of hope found a home in Seven's heart as she recalled the custom of 'surprising' individuals on the occasions of birthdays or anniversaries, and thought that perhaps a new home was also an occasion for surprise. If that were the case B'Elanna, along with her other friends, would be waiting just inside their quarters.</P>
<P>"We should examine our accommodation." Seven told Icheb, with barely concealed enthusiasm.</P>
<P>"Acceptable." The boy allowed Seven to proceed him into the room.</P>
<P>On first entering the living area the lights were off, so calling for them to illuminate Seven prepared for people to rise up and shout 'Surprise' in a way guaranteed to scare three years off the life expectancy of anyone unfortunate enough to walk in on it. The lights came on, and Seven waited.</P>
<P>"Is something wrong?" Icheb enquired from behind her.</P>
<P>"No." She peered around the room, the decor was standard Starfleet issue, with a large couch taking up the left hand side of the room, a table and chairs the right, but no sign of a hiding Chief Engineer. Walking quickly Seven went to the first of the doors adjoining the living area, looking in she expended just enough time to find out if anyone was present before moving onto the next. Two bedrooms with en suite bathroom, one on either side of the living room, and an area to the back of the living room containing the Borg alcoves, were all checked and still no sign of B'Elanna, or anyone else.</P>
<P>"Do you have a preference over bedrooms?" Icheb asked, he was unsure if he too should begin a whirlwind tour of the house, but as his regeneration cycle was now overdue by forty-three minutes, two seconds, he just wanted to pick a room and step into the alcove.</P>
<P>"Either will be sufficient." </P>
<P>Icheb nodded his agreement and chose the room nearest him on the left. Then as she watched the boy entered the room, surveyed it for eleven seconds, then sat down on the bed, bounced on the mattress three times, then made his way back to the living room. "I shall redistribute my belongings once my regeneration cycle is complete." Moving towards the door at the rear he turned and attempted a smile, "Good night Seven, I..I like our new home."</P>
<P>"Good night."</P>
<P>After watching Icheb disappear into the back room Seven walked into what was now her bedroom, and following the young man's example took a quick survey of the room before dropping down on the bed and giving a tiny bounce. Arching a brow, Seven checked there was still no-one within range, and bounced again, harder and higher, followed by a second and a third, before red faced with embarrassment she stood and walked to the door of the bathroom.</P>
<P>Looking around the bathroom Seven noticed a couple of small bottles of scented oils, and other bathing paraphernalia. Peering further she was surprised to see a small corner bath as well as a sonic shower taking up the majority of the space. As far as she was aware baths were not common accessories in Voyager crew quarters. Which made her wonder why they were still called bathrooms and not shower rooms, before rejecting the enquiry and deciding to experiment with this new apparatus.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Harry Kim walked onto the Bridge to begin his duty shift, after having spent the morning helping the engineering team work on Seven's quarters. He was met by a friendly smile from the Captain, and her cheerful greeting. "Glad to have you back with us Harry, I hope Seven liked her new rooms."</P>
<P>"I'm not sure Captain, B'Elanna still had to recalibrate the replicator before she contacted Seven and Icheb." Harry had wanted to stay around to witness Seven's reaction, but he had already missed too much of his assigned Bridge time, so had left the Chief Engineer to finish up.</P>
<P>"You mean its not finished?" An urgent tone had entered Janeway's voice.</P>
<P>"The main structure is complete." Harry reassured. "B'Elanna just wanted to hold off until she had finished all the smaller details."</P>
<P>"I seem to have been previously misinformed." Kathryn prepared to tap her comm. badge and alert Seven to the mistake, but she realised it was now too late, the young woman would have wasted no time in moving into her quarters, and even if the replicators were not up and running, there could be no harm in her moving in a few hours early. "Its of no importance. I guess we can now look forward to Seven's housewarming."</P>
<P>"A Borg housewarming, only in the Delta quadrant." Piped up Tom, the others on the Bridge sharing his laughter.</P>
