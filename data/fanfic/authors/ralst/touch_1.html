<!-- Touch \ Part 1 -->

<p>Seven stepped from her alcove, a frown marring her usually serene features as she surveyed the area around her. Icheb her young former Borg charge ended his regeneration cycle to her right, and turned to issue his customary morning greeting, but the look on Seven's face stopped him.</p>
<P>"Is there a problem?"</P>
<P>The blonde woman's initial instinct was to deny any problem, not only did she not want to worry the young man but she lacked any firm evidence that there really was a problem. Her natural honesty and a deepening worry made her change her mind and share her fears.</P>
<P>"I felt something while regenerating." Seven stopped trying to catalogue her impressions. "As if I was being physically... touched."</P>
<P>"You did not wake?" Enquired the boy, his voice was calm but there was a tension developing behind his eyes.</P>
<P>"No." An irrational urge to immerse herself in cleansing water consumed Seven's thoughts, her hands distractedly tracing a route over her body, as if needing to check for themselves everything was as it should be.</P>
<P>"Could it have been a dream?"</P>
<P>"No, I do not believe so." Looking at Icheb Seven could detect his concern, and suddenly a fiery sensation engulfed her. "Did you feel anything?" Thoughts that someone could have been touching the boy as well overwhelmed any concerns of her own treatment.</P>
<P>"No, I felt nothing." </P>
<P>"Good." A held breath escaped Seven's full lips.</P>
<P>"Have you felt anything like this before?"</P>
<P>"No." Seven hesitated a moment. "I have never felt a touch before, but for the previous five nights I did have the impression I was being watched."</P>
<P>"Why did you not tell me, or the Captain?" From being an emotionally reticent ex-Borg, the young man soon metamorphasised into the image of a scared parent, a transformation that didn't go unnoticed by Seven, the sight almost bringing a smile to her troubled face.</P>
<P>"I presumed my impression came from crew members working or retrieving material from the cargo bay. It is not unusual for people to be in here while we regenerate." Cocking her head to one side Seven continued. "Captain Janeway has on occasion watched me while I 'slept', especially if she was concerned by some aspect of my behaviour. I thought it might have been her."</P>
<P>"Is it possible the Captain was the one who touched you?"</P>
<P>"No!" The touched had made her feel uneasy, and she couldn't equate that with her overprotective and sometimes overbearing friend.</P>
<P>"Then I believe the correct course of action would be to inform Captain Janeway and Commander Tuvok of your suspicions." Standing straight with his hands firmly grasped behind his back Icheb gave no doubt that his words were infact an order.</P>
<P>"Yes." Turning to leave Seven looked back over her shoulder at Icheb's worried expression and added with a slight smile "Sir."</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Janeway had been troubled the moment Seven walked through her ready room door, after having waiting patiently outside for permission to enter, the young woman's face held traces of tension that to most would be unnoticeable, but to the Captain signalled something very wrong.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Coming around to face the young blonde Janeway laid what she hoped would be a reassuring hand on Seven's arm.</P>
<P>"I wish to report a..." Seven faltered not sure how best to describe what she suspected in Starfleet language. "I believe someone touched me while I was regenerating."</P>
<P>"What!" Janeway's voice rose into a near shriek, "Where?"</P>
<P>"Cargo Bay 2." Seven answered cautiously, wondering if the Captain was suffering some form of memory loss as she appeared to have forgotten where the Borg alcoves were located.</P>
<P>"No Seven, I mean where did they touch you?"</P>
<P>"I am not sure." </P>
<P>"Not sure?" Taking Seven's arm Kathryn led the young woman to the couch and sat down forcing the young former Borg to take the seat next to her. "I don't understand Seven, if you felt the touch how do you not know where you were touched?"</P>
<P>"I was regenerating." Seeing the blank look on Janeway's face Seven tried to explain. "When engaged in regeneration my bodies normal sensations are somewhat dampened, I believe it is similar to when you sleep, a touch of any force would bring me out of my regenerative state immediately, but a gentle touch, a caress, only registers on a subliminal level."</P>
<P>"But when you woke up you knew you had been touched?" Kathryn tried to qualify.</P>
<P>"Not at first, for point zero nine seconds after completing my regeneration cycle I was unsure of what had transpired, although I knew something had happened." Once again Seven's arms started a slow rhythmic caress of her own skin. "Then as I analysed my unease I knew that I had been touched." There was not a hint of doubt in Seven's voice.</P>
<P>"I will need to inform Commander Tuvok." Placing her hands on top of Seven's agitated ones Kathryn gave them a gentle squeeze. "Are you okay with that?"</P>
<P>"Yes, of course." Seven flinched at Janeway's touch but forced herself to not shrug off the friendly gesture.</P>
<P>Reaching up Janeway activated her comm. "Tuvok, please report to my ready room."</P>
<P>"Yes Captain."</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>After explaining the situation to Tuvok he began to implement a security investigation, beginning with a check of the ships logs concerning the entrants into Cargo Bay 2 during Seven's last six regeneration periods. Unfortunately the logs appeared to have been altered masking the names of any entrants, and without this information or any other physical evidence Tuvok was unable to proceed satisfactorily with his investigation. On consultation with the Captain and Seven it was decided that the security investigation would expand to include members of the senior staff. Convening in the conference room Janeway explained the situation to the rest of the senior officers, Tuvok taking up the explanation to include the difficulties he had encountered when investigating.</P>
<P>"Are you all right? Were you injured?" The Doctor asked in a more than professionally concerned voice, his questions the first direct contact any of them had had with Seven.</P>
<P>"I am...fine." Seven's voice was quiet, but looking towards her friend she managed a vague smile. "Thank you."</P>
<P>A moment of quiet descended on the room as all thoughts turned to the suddenly fragile appearing ex-Borg.</P>
<P>"Do you have any idea who might have done this Seven?" Harry questioned gently. "Has anyone been bothering you lately?"</P>
<P>"Not any more than is usual." Seven replied in a calm voice.</P>
<P>"What do you mean 'than is usual'?" B'Elanna piped up, dread filling her at the thought that maybe she was the usual bother Seven was referring to. For years the two had shared a rather volatile relationship, but over the past couple of months there had been a definite change in the half Klingon's feelings towards the former drone, and to think that Seven might still see her as a source of bother troubled her.</P>
<P>"Some members of the crew do not feel comfortable around a Borg." Looking into B'Elanna's eyes Seven detected her unease. "They do not say anything directly to my face, as would be honourable, they just mumbled comments and obstruct my work."</P>
<P>"Why didn't you inform me of this?" Janeway interrupted. "I would have put a stop to it immediately."</P>
<P>"With respect Captain, if you'd interfered it would just have made people more resentful." B'Elanna offered, she didn't need to add that she herself had felt that way.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres is correct Captain." Seven agreed. "The reactions of others are irrelevant, I did not require your assistance." She paused, "Until this time, this time is different."</P>
<P>"Why is now different?" Tom asked with a shrug.</P>
<P>"Mr Paris." Janeway's tone was sharp, and the eyes of all those around the table bore in on the sandy haired helmsman with either contempt or anger, in the case of B'Elanna both. Only Seven seem unaffected by his question and had been about to answer.</P>
<P>"I didn't, I just meant." Tom floundered.</P>
<P>"Now is different because it occurred while I was unconscious, not to my face, or even behind my back." Seven addressed a red faced Tom Paris. "It was also where Icheb regenerates."</P>
<P>"The touch, could it have been sexual in nature?" Chakotay tried to soften his tone, it wasn't a question he wanted to have to ask but he knew he must.</P>
<P>"I do not know." Seven looked confused "I am not sure how to differentiate between a sexual and a non-sexual touch, especially as I do not know the area of my body he or she touched."</P>
<P>Colourful words in several languages could just be heard issuing from B'Elanna's rigid mouth, her whole body was taut, desperate to find the person and rip their head off. "The sick bastard, he probably just sees a beautiful woman and figures he has the right to stare and..." Clenching her fist B'Elanna smashed it onto the table. "We have to stop him."</P>
<P>"Stopping him or her and apprehending them is the reason we are all here Lieutenant." Tuvok interrupted in his usual emotionless tone.</P>
<P>For the first time since ending her regeneration cycle that morning Seven experienced a moment of happiness, B'Elanna thought her beautiful. Normally others opinions of her appearance were of little or no importance to the former Borg, but if B'Elanna thought her beautiful it was just one less hurdle in her goal to gain the other woman's affections. Winning the half Klingon's heart had been a serious goal of Seven's ever since the other woman had annulled her marriage to Lieutenant Paris, but although there had been a definite change in the way B'Elanna acted towards her, this was the first proof she had that the woman could possible, in the future, be attracted to her.</P>
<P>"I would have thought the solution to that was simple." The Doctor addressed Tuvok.</P>
<P>"Really?" The Vulcan's eyebrow rose to the heavens.</P>
<P>"This 'person' has comes to Cargo Bay 2 on six consecutive occasions while Seven has been regenerating. Therefore if you 'stake out' the area tonight the perpetrator will show themselves." The Doctor leaned back in his chair, a smug look on his face.</P>
<P>"A logical assumption." Tuvok allowed. "However, the investigation into this crime may have alerted the perpetrator, who would therefore alter his or her modus operandi." Turning from the now not so smug EMH Tuvok addressed the Captain. "A surveillance operation will be put into effect in Cargo Bay 2 during Seven of Nine's next regeneration cycle, but in the event that it is not successful other avenues of investigation must be attempted."</P>
<P>"I agree." Janeway looked around the room as she spoke, "Does anyone have any ideas?"</P>
<P>"I'd like to have a look at the computer logs." Harry volunteered. "I might be able to find something the security team missed."</P>
<P>"Good. Anything else?"</P>
<P>"We should check the crew manifest to see who was off duty, or in unsupervisory positions during all six attacks." B'Elanna offered.</P>
<P>"I think it would be a good idea if Seven worked with you on that." Chakotay added. "She might be able to identify any person who has shown any overt interest in her recently."</P>
<P>"That could be practically all the guy's on the ship." Tom chimed in with a smile.</P>
<P>Ignoring the helmsman Janeway addressed the more productive members of her senior staff. "B'Elanna, you and Seven start work on the crew rosters, Harry, you take a look at the logs, and Tuvok I'll leave you to organise the surveillance." She again surveyed those around the table, "Anything else?" The only response was a few shaken heads. "Fine, then you're all dismissed." </P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Seven stood, her hands clasped tightly behind her back, an expression of icy calm settled on her beautiful face. Beside her B'Elanna was busy entering search perameters into the Astrometrics console, her fingers flying over the slick controls in her haste to identify the sick individual she knew was hidden among the crew. </P>
<P>"Do you have any idea what time this...this person touched you?" Forced out the engineer, just mentioning the individual responsible for frightening the ex-Borg made her want to seriously maim something, preferably the slime responsible. </P>
<P>"No, I have no real concept of time whilst I regenerate." Seven's voice carried a hint of apology that wasn't lost on B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"That's okay, its the same for me when I sleep." B'Elanna assured "Besides from the pattern of the log tampering it's possible to narrow the search down some." She started tapping at the console again. Names began scrolling down the large view screen, sections turning blue and disappearing once the duty rosters had eliminated them from the suspect list. After all the rosters had been checked there were still nearly forty names remaining on the screen. "We got lucky, the blank times on the logs occur during two different duty shifts, if not the list would have been more like eighty people long." </P>
<P>"Thirty-eight is lucky?" Borg implant rose.</P>
<P>"Sure, I mean a list of one would have been real lucky, but thirty-eight's not so bad." B'Elanna uncharacteristically laid a friendly hand on Seven's arm, but almost immediately remembered why they were there and removed what she thought would be an unwelcome physical gesture. "All we have to do now is narrow it down a bit."</P>
<P>"How do you suggest we proceed?"</P>
<P>"Lets just go through them one at a time and you can tell me what, if any, contact you've had with each, especially if they've ever shown any overt interest in you, erm." B'Elanna found herself studying the floor, "sexually."</P>
<P>"Why do you presume these visitations are of a sexual nature?" Seven asked her calmly.</P>
<P>"He touched you." The half Klingon practically shouted.</P>
<P>Seven studied the shorter woman for a moment, not quite able to understand her apparent anger. "There are other forms of touch besides sexual."</P>
<P>"Look Seven, you're a beautiful, sexy and ultimately unattainable woman, looking at you or touching you while you're unconscious might be the only way some creep would think himself able to be with you." B'Elanna's agitation just kept growing. "Some people can't handle rejection or even the possibility of it, they just have to take what they think belongs to them. They're sick!"</P>
<P>"Lieutenant? Are you alright?" Seven was concerned by B'Elanna's seemingly unreasonable anger.</P>
<P>"Yes." Forcing herself to calm down B'Elanna faced a worried looking Seven. "I'm sorry Seven, the last thing you need is me going off the deep end. I just can't stand the idea of someone taking advantage of you."</P>
<P>A gentle smile found its way to Seven's lips. "Then let us hope the person's intentions were homicidal not romantic."</P>
<P>A Klingon jaw gapped open.</P>
<P>"I was joking." Seven explained, wondering if her attempts to master humour had failed yet again.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly brought her eyes up to lock with the blue of Seven's, her face still a picture of surprise. Then just as she detected the young former drone about to explain further B'Elanna winked, "I know." A cheeky smile dominating the engineers face. "Come on we'd best get on with this."</P>
<P>"Acceptable." Stepping up to the console Seven press the button that brought up the first in their list of suspects. Half turning she spoke quietly into B'Elanna's ear, "I am not unattainable Lieutenant, at least not to the right person."</P>
<P>Looking up B'Elanna was captured by the intensity of Seven's eyes, her heart rates soaring with every second she was held in the electric gaze. "You are? What I mean is...do you think, I mean...we, we should get to work."</P>
<P>"Yes Lieutenant." Seven replied unsuccessfully trying to hide her smile.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>At the assigned time Seven stepped into her Borg alcove, Icheb already ensconced in the alcove to her right, and began her regeneration cycle, hopeful that by the time her cycle came to an end the identity of her nocturnal visitor would be known. Tuvok had positioned a select team of security personnel, all taken from those already eliminated, around Cargo Bay 2. While Harry Kim and B'Elanna monitored the sensor readings for the area directly surrounding the cargo bay. B'Elanna had wanted to be in the cargo bay when the perpetrator was apprehended, but one look at the Klingon fury just waiting to be unleashed had quickly decided the Captain that the best place for the young woman was in Astrometrics.</P>
<P>Seven's regeneration period was scheduled to last six hours, and for all of that time the security team, and the majority or the senior staff, just waited. Waited, and waited, and then waited some more, until the feminine tones of the computer announced "Regeneration cycle complete."</P>
<P>Seven stepped from her alcove and after checking on Icheb walked towards the approaching security detail. "Did you apprehend the individual?"</P>
<P>"No." Tuvok replied, "No one has entered Cargo Bay 2 since the start of your regeneration period."</P>
<P>"I see." For a moment Seven just stood there unsure of what to do next. Her thoughts interrupted by the hasty arrival of the Captain, B'Elanna and Harry, all of whom gathered around the blonde in what she supposed was a sympathetic manner.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Seven." Janeway soothed, placing a hand on her shoulder. "We'll figure out some other way to find this person."</P>
<P>"Indeed."</P>
<P>"We still have some names to recheck, I'm sure with the information Harry's managed to gather from the logs we should be able to work out who it is." B'Elanna added, surpressing the desire to knock Janeway's hand from Seven's shoulder and replace it with her own. "Captain, if you don't need Seven anymore we should get on with our investigation." </P>
<P>"Do you want any extra help?" Janeway offered, rather hoping that she could be of personal use in this situation.</P>
<P>"Not right now Captain, its kind of a two woman job." B'Elanna smiled over at Seven, "You ready?"</P>
<P>Seven looked over at Icheb, and seeing her young charge give an almost undetectable nod, replied "Yes Lieutenant." After receiving permission from Janeway the two women exited the cargo bay, soon followed by Harry Kim.</P>
