<!-- Touch \ Part 5 -->

<P>Hoping to add a little colour and personality to Seven's new quarters B'Elanna decided to replicate a large bunch of red roses, she had worried that it was perhaps not the ideal gift, as the quarters were to be shared with Icheb and the young man might not be too fond of flowers, but the need to get Seven something was too strong to ignore. Wanting to add other small touches of personality to the place, and knowing the two ex-Borg would more than likely leave the place practically bare if left to themselves, B'Elanna also replicated two bedcovers. The choice of cover had taken her some time, she wished to get Icheb something that reflected both his near adulthood and his lost childhood, the choice made all the more difficult as she still wasn't that familiar with the boy, in the end she settled for a cover depicting a space shuttle race, although memories of her disastrous marriage to Tom Paris had almost made her change her mind. For Seven she wanted something with a bit of colour and warmth, a nice contrast to the sterile nature of the Borg alcove. She decided on an artists interpretation of spring flowers, each bud imperfect but still beautiful, the colour she thought would light up the room.</P>
<P>Carrying her presents, along with a three-line alignment wrench to finish the adjustments to the replicator, B'Elanna entered Seven's quarters. The first thing she noticed was that someone had turned the lights on after she left, and wondered if Harry had sneaked back after she'd dismissed him to welcome the new residents. She knew it was selfish but she had hoped to welcome Seven and Icheb on her own, and give them a personal tour of their quarters. Now with completion only minutes away she wouldn't be able to find an excuse to banish Harry.</P>
<P>Grumbling under her breath B'Elanna laid down her packages before turning to try and see which room Harry was occupying. Walking to the bedroom on the right she noticed the temporary bedcover had been disarranged, as if someone had been jumping on it, so with more grumbling directed at the ensign she removed the cover and replaced it with the patterned one. Standing back B'Elanna admired her choice, before a noise from the bathroom alerted her to Harry's position.</P>
<P>Striding to the bathroom door B'Elanna planned on having a few choice words with Ensign Kim regarding the proper execution of a superior officers orders, or simply put when she told him to scram he should scram. Walking through the door B'Elanna was caught momentarily sightless by the excess of steam occupying the room, then her sight was blocked altogether as she walked into a tall towelling clad figure.</P>
<P>"What! Harry?" Stepping back B'Elanna was caught by the sight of Seven, damp hair hanging loosely down around her shoulders, cheeks flushed with the after effects of a steaming bath, or just running into another person in her bathroom. "Seven?" </P>
<P>"Yes Lieutenant?" Although surprised to walk into the half Klingon only moments after getting out of her first remembered bath, Seven was still upset with the other woman for not being there when she arrived, even though having her here now was sending her heart into overdrive.</P>
<P>"What are you doing here?" </P>
<P>"These are my quarters." Moving out into the bedroom the ex-Borg made a sweeping gesture as if claiming the territory as her own. "I received permission from the Captain to take residence."</P>
<P>"You weren't supposed to move in until I'd finished." Feebly pointing at the new bedcover B'Elanna continued, "I wanted to make it nice for you."</P>
<P>Seven looked down at the new cover, she didn't understand why this new version had been chosen to replace the perfectly serviceable cover that had adorned the bed before she bathed, but if it meant B'Elanna had been thinking of her, of making this special for her, she was very happy with it. "Now you are here it is nice for me."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's blush wasn't only due to Seven's words, she had gotten her first full glimpse of the robe clad figure, and although the soft towelling covered nearly her entire body, its length ending just past her knees, there was something about the sight, or the knowledge that with one tug on the belt Seven would be naked, that set twin Klingon hearts thumping erratically. "Where's Icheb?"</P>
<P>"Regenerating." Approaching B'Elanna Seven could see the desire begin to awaken in her eyes, just as it had the night Edwards was caught. Only this time there would be not interruptions from Icheb, and her clothing would surrender to gravity with a lot less trouble and waste of time. "We are alone here Lieutenant." Seven's fingers effortlessly found the fastening to B'Elanna's uniform top and opened it, moving upwards they slipped the offending article from her shoulders allowing it to pool at the Klingon's booted feet. </P>
<P>"You can call me B'Elanna you know." She managed passed a mouth gone suddenly dry.</P>
<P>"Yes Lieutenant." Seven's fingers again found the edge of the Starfleet issue t-shirt and began lifting it from B'Elanna's trim body, the half Klingon raising her arms to help complete the action, before the garment joined its companion on the floor.</P>
<P>Having remained passive for too long B'Elanna's hand reached out to grasp the end of the belt securing Seven's robe, only to find her fingers captured by the blondes and brought to her lips where they received a tender kiss. "Not yet Lieutenant."</P>
<P>Placing B'Elanna's hand back at her side, Seven trailed her fingers down the length of the exposed stomach, then reversing the action brought them up to graze the sides of the still covered breasts before exploring the smooth skin of B'Elanna's neck and shoulders, then slowly trailing her fingers down the caramel coloured arms she capture both of B'Elanna's hands in her own. With minimal encouragement she lead the captivated woman towards the bed, turning as they reached the side, so B'Elanna was standing with the back of her legs only an inch from the beds edge. Letting a single finger slide around the waistband of the uniform trousers Seven located the fastening and tugged it free, allowing the last remains of the Starfleet uniform to gather around B'Elanna's feet. In a voice deeper and more strained than anyone had heard from her before Seven leaned forward to whisper in the excited Klingon's ear, "Take a seat please Lieutenant."</P>
<P>B'Elanna did as she was asked, she would have been a total fool not to, and saw Seven kneel at her feet, to remove first one then the other boot, and slip the trousers from her legs. Sitting there in nothing but her underwear all B'Elanna wanted to do was pull on Seven's belt and feel the naked form beside her on the bed, but she didn't, somehow during the course of the encounter Seven had chosen to lead, maybe given her inexperience it was her way of reclaiming control over uncertainty, or perhaps she just liked having her own way inside the bedroom as much as out, whatever the reason B'Elanna had decided to go along with it, they would have plenty of other opportunities, but this was Seven's first and she would decide how it progressed.</P>
<P>Standing Seven was again captured by the beauty of the other woman, the firm body leaning slightly back displayed all the perfection she could ever want from another, B'Elanna's face was open and filled with desire, desire that she had inspired. Trying to catch her breath the inexperienced woman was suddenly overwhelmed by all the feelings running through her, the needs of her body crying out to be met, but a small measure of fear seemed to be trapping her in mid-motion. "Seven?" B'Elanna called, a smile gracing her lips. Broken from her indecision Seven reached down and captured B'Elanna's face in her hands, bringing their lips together for a kiss filling with desire, tongues exploring freely as a hand found its way to Seven's belt. Ending the kiss Seven batted the hand away, "Not yet Lieutenant."</P>
<P>"When?" The desperation in B'Elanna's voice couldn't be masked.</P>
<P>"Soon B'Elanna." Full lips curled as they spoke the name, and fingers travelled the short distance to B'Elanna's bra, unclasping the object and slowly stripping it from around her body to fall in a heap with the other discarded items. Splayed fingers traced a path down B'Elanna's chest, then moved down further to slip beneath the panties and begin an agonisingly slow journey to finally free the Klingon of all unnecessary clothing.</P>
<P>Lifting herself from the bed B'Elanna could feel the material slide down her legs, leaving her naked and at the mercy of anothers gaze, but instead of feeling vulnerable or even shy, she was thrilled. The look in Seven's eyes only adding to her sense of desirability, and as she watched in silent astonishment a long pale finger worked its way into Seven's belt, and with a frustratingly slow movement pulled the belt apart. The white material opened to reveal her first glimpse of Seven's beauty, a slightly worried frown going unnoticed as B'Elanna feasted on the emerging form. Seven's body was much as she had always imagined, perfection and flaws in harmony, the creamy white skin broken in places by the dark metal of the Borg, a starburst implant similar to the one on Seven's jaw sat on the underside of her left breast where it joined her side. The contrast was beautiful, and B'Elanna wanted nothing more than to reach for it and consume the implant with kisses. Her eyes travelling up to take in the sight of full breasts, her hands straining to reach out and touch the delicate skin, with a groan of pure frustration B'Elanna looked up into Seven's eyes, her intentions forgotten the second she saw the fear in the blue pools. "You are so beautiful, I don't deserve you Seven."</P>
<P>A gentle smile curled Seven's lips, her fear of rejection vanquished with a few heartfelt words, "I think we deserve each other Lieu...B'Elanna." Moving forward Seven once again captured the Klingon's lips in a fiery kiss, using her momentum to lay the other woman down on the bed. Before she could fully take advantage of the change in position and begin to explore the newly revealed body, Seven felt her sides being held and a quick movement found her lying in the centre of the bed with a smiling B'Elanna leaning over her. </P>
<P>"Sorry, just thought I'd get comfortable." The move had been instinctive, and from the look on Seven's face welcome.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Seven again pulled B'Elanna's mouth to hers, this time forcing the Klingon's body to drape over her. Breaking the kiss and running her hands down the strong back Seven let her hands rest on B'Elanna's firm behind, "Now this is comfortable." Squeezing the firm flesh, just as B'Elanna had done to her the time before, Seven was rewarded with a deep groan and the feel of their bodies pushed closer together.</P>
<P>"Oh Kahless!" Dropping her head B'Elanna began to rain kisses down Seven's neck, trailing a path across her collar bone and down to encircle her left breast with tiny kisses. Seven's back arched with the contact, and B'Elanna took that opportunity to capture her nipple with an eagerly waiting mouth. The sound of Seven crying out only fuelled her desire further, flicking a tongue across the excited flesh her hand came around to search out the starburst implant, the metal surprisingly warm, and as she'd hoped responsive to touch, a second moan was torn from Seven's lips as fingers dances along the metal, its Borg precision sending sensations throughout her body. Temporarily leaving the tempting flesh B'Elanna's lips encircled the implant letting her tongue trace the edges of the metal as it descended into pure creamy skin.</P>
<P>Waves of pleasure worked their way through Seven's body, her mind unable to process all the new and incredible feelings assailing her senses. Needing the grounding of B'Elanna's presence Seven reached for her, urging her lips into contact with her own. Smooth fingers gliding down her body forced Seven to deepen the kiss still further, their decent towards her thighs leaving her fighting for breath.</P>
<P>Stilling her hand B'Elanna broke the kiss. "You okay?"</P>
<P>"Yes, I just didn't know it was so..." Seven's dictionary of words failed her, and shadowing B'Elanna's hand as it rested on her thigh she whispered. "Don't stop."</P>
<P>Smiling B'Elanna resumed her hands path towards Seven's inner thigh, her brown eyes glued to the blue of her lover, for the first touch of that most intimate of flesh. As she watched Seven's breath caught and her eyes closed, then a new and decidedly erotic sound made its way from deep in her throat, bringing an answering whimper from B'Elanna. Letting her hand intimately explore the smoothly soft flesh she couldn't take her eyes from the beauty that was Seven, silently praying she would open her eyes so they could fully share this moment. As if reading her mind the heavy lids began to flutter, and then she was captured by a blue so vibrant it stole her breath.</P>
<P>Sensations were running rampant throughout her body, wonderful, exciting feelings that seemed to overtake all other responses. Her eyes had closed of their own freewill, but pushing as if against lead weights she prised them open to search out the woman who had captured her heart, and now her body. Brown eyes met hers and physical pleasure was overtaken by the pleasure of the heart, the love she saw in those expressive eyes was more than she could ever have hoped to inspire, physical and emotional pleasure collided in a wave of orgasm, "B'Elannnnnaaaaa," reaching out blindly Seven pulled her love to her, needing to feel every inch of this miraculous woman.</P>
<P>B'Elanna revelled in Seven's death grip, planting small kisses on a rosy cheek as she watched Seven's breathing come under control, and the blue eyes clear and turn to focus on her. "You are incredible." She told the young blonde, and knew her words had failed to even come close to how truly remarkable she was. "I have never felt so..." Unable to explain properly she kiss the inviting lips once more.</P>
<P>Breaking from the kiss Seven stroked the side of B'Elanna's face, letting her fingers follow patterns in the warm skin. "You are the incredible one B'Elanna Torres, no one has ever made me feel the way you do. I didn't think I could."</P>
<P>"Well how about we call it a draw?" B'Elanna kissed a finger as it passed her lips, "We're both incredible," smiling she leaned forward and gave Seven a tender kiss, "together."</P>
<P>"Acceptable." An ocular implant rose, soon followed by the corners of Seven's lips, before she pulled her lover to her with every intention of finding out even more ways they were incredible together.</P>

<p><br>Richard Edwards sat huddled on his bed in a quiet corner of sickbay, his fingers tracing lines on the data pad screen as tears streamed down his face. An image of a blonde blue eyed Laura stared back up at him, her face filled with such happiness and joy. For the first time in over seven years he allowed his mind to remember the day the image was taken, he and his wife Alyssa had taken their overexcited five year old on shore leave, the idea had been for a sedate picnic while Alyssa collected a few samples. What they hadn't anticipated was Laura becoming fascinated with one of the harmless fluffy pink mammals that lived in the area, and deciding to chase the probably very scared creature down towards the river. He remembered the panic at seeing her suddenly take off laughing towards the water, and the joy and relief when his strong arms captured her before she could try crossing the bridge. More tears followed the path of their predecessors as he recalled her turning to him with mounting glee, "Can I have one of the fluffy things daddy? I'll take care of him." At the time he'd had to refuse, but to keep the smile on his little angels face he'd promised to replicate her a fluffy pink teddy just like the animal when they got home. "Apple." A chuckle escaped him as he remembered the name Laura had chosen for the stuffed toy, at the time Alyssa had just looked at him with a barely restrained grin, "It's not round and it's not green, so of course he's called Apple." Then they had both laughed, only to be temporarily silenced by a five year old sigh of "Adults" before beginning to laugh even louder.</P>
<P>The EMH looked over at his most recent patient and was satisfied when he saw the object in his hands, for all the time he'd been on Voyager Edwards had refused to look at the picture of his daughter, his denial and guilt so strong even the thought of her had been like a knife wound. Now seeing him stare at the pretty little girl, and even hearing the occasional sound of muted laughter, the Doctor felt reassured they had not been too late to help the poor man. Going over to his console he wrote out a small progress report to give to Seven, the young woman and her ex-Borg charge had been Edwards most constant visitors, and even though he had been uncertain at first, the presence of the two Borg survivors had seemed to help the man open up and begin to come to terms with his grief. So he had agreed to keep Seven appraised of the situation, he only hoped their new counsellor, when they got one, would be half as good as the ex-Borg in empathising with people. Stopping his train of thought the EMH wondered if he should have his program checked, 'Borg do not empathise.' He grinned to himself, maybe not but the two they had seemed to do a pretty good imitation.</P>
<P>Picking up the next object that Seven had retrieved for him Edwards looked at the transmission he had received from his wife Alyssa in the Alpha quadrant. He could remember reading the words of her new marriage, but other than that the contents were a blur, another memory buried because it was too painful to deal with. With a feeling of dread he opened the file, but the first few words caught him as a surprise;</P>
<P>Hello Richard,</P>
<P>I have missed you and loved you so much over all these years, the memory of you and Laura sometimes the only thing that kept me going, while at others the thought of finally joining the two of you in death was so strong I almost ended it all. I've lost count of how many times I wished I'd joined you on Voyager as you wanted, but I needed time after loosing Laura although I soon realised not time away from you, I thought then we could have faced the end together, maybe even been able to comfort each other. Now to know you're alive its so amazing, I've been crying tears of joy and sadness ever since I found out, joy that you are still alive my love, but sadness because you are so far away I will never see you again....</P>
<P>Edwards put down the pad, somehow he'd forgotten about these words of love and had only remembered the story of a lonely woman who took comfort from one of his old friends and ended up his wife. This was the Alyssa he'd married, the warm, loving and generous woman who had always made him feel special, the woman whose later messages he'd ignored and tried to forget. He sighed, he would talk with the Doctor, and maybe Seven, about the prospect of contacting her, just to let her know he still cared, still loved her, and he understood about her marrying Brian, even though he was still unsure if he did. Putting the objects to one side he laid down to rest, suddenly wishing he had a fluffy animal names Apple to snuggle up to.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Laying on her side Seven watched as B'Elanna slept contentedly in her arms, the darker woman's face relaxed in a way she had never seen before, inspiring within Seven a deep desire to protect her. The young woman felt the corners of her mouth turn up in amusement, she could just picture the volatile half Klingon's reaction to someone attempting to act as her protector, the language alone would probably be enough to frighten off most of her foes.</P>
<P>"What's so funny?" B'Elanna drawled, still half asleep.</P>
<P>"Nothing." Seven was usually honest to a fault but didn't like the prospect of having to explain how she found B'Elanna's independence and stubbornness amusing. "I was thinking about the housewarming." Which was kind of true, she had considered it approximately two hours eleven minutes ago, after spending the first hour of B'Elanna's slumber just memorising the contours of her face, and scent of her body.</P>
<P>"And you were wondering why they wanted to set your quarters on fire?" B'Elanna smirked before snuggling in tighter to her Borg pillow.</P>
<P>"No." Seven was about to comment that she wasn't that naive, or literal, when the feel of hot breath on her neck stole her thoughts.</P>
<P>"So what about the housewarming?"</P>
<P>"Hmm?" Seven's finger began tracing patterns across B'Elanna's back, feeling the muscles ripple in her wake. "I was just trying to work out who I was meant to invite."</P>
<P>"You can invite whoever you want."</P>
<P>"What if I just want to invite you?" Seven's hand began to travel lower, her work being rewarded by a low purr from her lover.</P>
<P>"Well I think the Captain might feel a bit put out by that." She planted a tiny kiss on Seven's neck. "Not to mention the Doctor, Harry, Naomi, oh and of course Icheb, I mean this is his home too."</P>
<P>"Icheb!" Seven sat up straight in bed, much to B'Elanna's surprise, especially as she found herself practically thrown off the bed in the upheaval.</P>
<P>"Calm down, what about him?"</P>
<P>"His regeneration cycle finishes in twelve minutes thirty-one seconds." Seven pulled the bedcover over herself and her companion. "He will see you."</P>
<P>"Are you ashamed to be seen with me?" B'Elanna's voice had taken on an indignant but also frightened tone.</P>
<P>"No, how could I ever be ashamed of you? I love you." Seven quickly peered through the still open door to the living room. "But, well he's only a boy..."</P>
<P>"What did you say?" B'Elanna sat up in the bed, the cover falling from her body earned first a hungry look, then a rapid sheet rearrangement by the flustered ex-Borg.</P>
<P>"I said he is only a boy, seeing his, his parental role model in this kind of situation might confuse him. I know I experiences deep confusion and even revulsion when the Captain took Sullivan as a lover, and I'm an adult."</P>
<P>"But that was because he's a hologram, I'm not." Stilling Seven's almost frantic movements B'Elanna took her shoulders in her hands and turned the time calculating ex-Borg to face her. "That was not that part I want to hear you repeat."</P>
<P>Seven's face was a blank mask for a second as she replayed her words, then a shocked expression overtook her. She had not meant to express her feelings like that, she didn't want to scare the other woman off, and her research hand shown that too rapid declarations of love could have that effect if the feeling was not returned, or even in some cases when it was. "I am sorry, I did not mean to...to upset you."</P>
<P>"I'm not upset." B'Elanna's hearts were pounding, she had to know if Seven meant what she'd said. "Is it true? Do you love me?"</P>
<P>Seven felt like crying, she was caught between telling the truth and possibly loosing B'Elanna or telling a lie and still loosing her. Finally honesty won. "Yes. I love you."</P>
<P>Seven found herself engulfed in the tightest embrace she had ever experienced before lips found hers in a fiery kiss. If this was how rejection felt she didn't know what all those old country and western songs were complaining about. Her body was on fire yet again, and reaching down she began to let her fingers explore the exposed skin of B'Elanna's thigh.</P>
<P>"Mmm, stop that Seven." Having broken the kiss B'Elanna swatted enticing fingers away. "I can't have the almost son of the woman I love catching me in his new home, naked and being erm, pleasured by you." </P>
<P>"The woman you love?" Borg nanoprobes couldn't keep up with the galloping of Seven's heart at hearing those words, and for a moment she thought she would pass out. Most inefficient.</P>
<P>"That my annoying," kiss, "irrepressible," kiss, "alluring," kiss, "sexy," kiss, "woman, is you." Sitting back and observing a red faced Seven, B'Elanna took her hands and looking directly into her eyes told her "I love you Seven."</P>
<P>The Borg and Klingon equivalent of soppy grins were soon disturbed by the muted sound of the computer announcing a regeneration cycle complete. Leaping from the bed the two began a comical search for clothing, B'Elanna noting her house designs obvious lack of proper sound proofing, if the noise from the alcove could be so easily distinguished, and made the rectifying of that situation her top engineering project. While in the bathroom pulling at the skin tight biosuit Seven decided to replicate herself some more easily removable clothing, and to make sure B'Elanna had clear instructions on the fastenings of each.</P>
<P>Red faced and slightly dishevelled B'Elanna and Seven made their way to the living room, where they bade an overly cheerful 'good morning', to an observant Icheb.</P>
<P>"Indeed." The boy answered, glad to see he was right, and his family had grown.</P>
