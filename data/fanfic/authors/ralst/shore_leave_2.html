<!-- Shore Leave \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>Waking up on this dump of a planet, I actually found my mood less than dire for once. Rolling out of bed without cursing is something I haven't been able to do for months, but today, as I made my way to the bathroom, I actually had a smile on my face. Before anyone thinks I've gone soft and gooey eyed from kissing the Borg, I must state that my mood has absolutely nothing to do with that. On the contrary, it was her looks of bewilderment after a few of my more colourful comments, and Tom's inevitable failure that were making me so happy. I kind of like this 'don't give a damn, say whatever you want' attitude I seem to have recaptured. I don't know why I ever let Janeway and her regulations take it away from me.</p>
		<p>Inevitably my good mood wasn't to last. Walking out the door I was once again reminded that I had to spend the day in this social backwater, with nothing to pass the time but watching the dust collect on the roadside.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Marquis, are you off to the lake?" I decide to forgive Harry his chirpyness as he's got his arm around the plain looking ensign from Earth sciences and obviously spent the night being introduced to the wonders of carnal pleasure. The boy's grin is practically decapitating him.</p>
		<p>"Why would I want to go to that sludge hole?" Sex has obviously rattled his brain, I'm envious.</p>
		<p>"Actually, despite its colour, the water is very clean," pipes up the ensign, in a voice made for talking dirty.</p>
		<p>"Tom even managed to persuade Seven to try sunbathing," it's good to see that even though he's just spent a night of untold bliss, he can still get dreamy eyed at the thought of Seven in a bikini.</p>
		<p>Shit! Seven, in a bikini. There is no way I can leave Tom alone with her.</p>
		<p>"I have to change, I'll meet you all there as soon as possible."</p>
		<p>Harry looks a bit confused, but wanders off happily enough, a fine boned hand cupping his rear as his partner whispers something delicious in his ear.</p>
		<p>Having squeezed into my black bikini, I take a moment to admire myself in the mirror; the extra hours I've spent practising with the bat'leth have honed my figure, without distorting my womanly curves with over pumped muscle. I haven't looked this good in years, although I'm not sure even the prettiest of bodies would have any effect of Seven. Aesthetics never seem to register with her, which is probably why she doesn't realise how God damn attractive she is.</p>
		<p>The lake is looking as brown and unappealing as ever, the only difference from the day before is the string of Starfleet bodies sprawled out under the blazing sun. I can see Harry and his paramour snuggled up under the shade of a tree, exchanging kisses and generally oblivious to everyone else. A couple of my engineers appear to be engaged in a game of volleyball with some of Tuvok's security detail; I hope we cream them. </p>
		<p>I would have thought locating Seven would have been easy, just a matter of following the lascivious stares; but no one's tripping over their tongue or calling for artificial respiration, so I presume she's not here yet. It's then that I spot Tom and discover why the general population isn't in Borg drool mode; Seven's covered from head to toe in a giant robe, even less of her flesh on show than in her damn biosuits.</p>
		<p>"Cold, Seven?"</p>
		<p>I believe Tom is actually relieved to see me, which is a bad sign.</p>
		<p>"My temperature is within acceptable limits." She's either angry or scared, but whichever it is the tension around these two is palpable.</p>
		<p>"I've been trying to explain to Seven that it's okay for her to just wear her swimsuit, but she won't listen," he sounds far too exasperated, it can't be doing his chances any good, "I even offered to put suntan lotion on for her, but she won't budge." He smiles at the idea, but gets no reaction from Seven.</p>
		<p>Looking around the shore I see that nearly everyone is decked out in swimsuit or bikini, and it is Seven's refusal to follow suit that marks her out from the crowd. Perhaps that's it? Perhaps she's just afraid that the sight of her implants will reinforce her isolation from the rest of the ship. </p>
		<p>Standing directly in front of her, I reach out my hand. "Come on."</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant?"</p>
		<p>I wiggle my hand in an impatient gesture. "Stand up."</p>
		<p>She clasps my hand and stands to face me. Without her heels she is only a couple of inches taller than me, and I find my gaze resting comfortably on her full lips. My look isn't blatant but it is noticeable, and she wets her lips in what I think is anticipation. Ignoring the unconscious invitation, I release her hand and pull at the cord which is keeping my own, much smaller, robe closed. Her eyes seem enraptured by the barest sight of my body, and with deliberate slowness I ease the rest of the gown from my shoulders to pool on the floor. Her gaze appears to take in every nuance of my form, but whether in appreciation or Borg curiosity I'm uncertain. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the meaning behind Tom's leer, so I do my best to ignore him.</p>
		<p>When I feel she's stared long enough I reach out to clasp the end of the cord which is holding her mountain of a robe together. In an instant her hand is by mine, trying to wrestle the fabric from my grasp. I don't let go.</p>
		<p>"Relax, Seven." For a split second she looks terrified, and I want to reassure her everything will be fine. Somehow this moment has gone beyond the scope of our bet, and what I want more than anything is to show her she can be one of us, and needn't fear rejection.</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna," she whispers my name, as her eyes plead with mine, but eventually she relents and drops her hold; finally trusting that I don't mean her any harm.</p>
		<p>I pull on the cord and it soon comes free, to fall forgotten to the floor. Her body is still covered, the depths of the robe proving a valid shield against all on lookers. I step closer still, my body brushing up against the fabric of the gown. Slowly I ease my hands into the robe's opening and begin to unveil the treasure within. Her skin is milky white, and flawless; the tiny implants which are made visible to me appear as decorations more than intrusions. She's beautiful.</p>
		<p>The rapid movement of her chest tells me she's near to hyperventilating with distress. So far I am the only one who can see past her robe, as my body provides a shield for hers. I raise my eyes to hers and can see the fear she has tried so hard to mask. </p>
		<p>I smile. </p>
		<p>My eyes then leave hers for a moment to trail appreciatively across her exposed body, conveying without words the joy I receive just looking at her. When my eyes once again find hers, they are calmer; and I realise for the first time that she really does trust me, despite everything.</p>
		<p>My hands move further under the robe, to encircle her shoulders, then ever so gradually I begin to lower the gown from her body. She is still. No longer afraid, she seems to be enjoying our closeness. As the gown finally falls to the ground I am left holding her in a near embrace; my fingertips just millimetres from her skin.</p>
		<p>We stay like that for an endless moment, my eyes never leaving hers, as my body sings out to take her in my arms. Finally I step back, and for the first time I see the full glory of her. The burgundy suit that adorns her body is conservative in style, but does nothing to hide her generous curves. Breathtaking.</p>
		<p>"Looking good, Seven." Tom's words are accompanied by a wolf whistle and I suddenly remember we aren't the only people on the planet. Turning slightly I notice that every eye on the shore is on us, and the drool I'd expected when I first arrived has arrived in abundance, but it is accompanied by a stunned embarrassment I hadn't expected. It was as if they were ashamed for spying on a private moment.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Tom." She quickly sits, hoping to dispel the lingering looks. I wonder when she started calling him Tom?</p>
		<p>"Do you want me to put some lotion on your back?"</p>
		<p>She looks at me, but it isn't my decision to make.</p>
		<p>"You don't want to burn," he adds, reaching into a bag for an old fashioned bottle of lotion. Trust Tom to go for the hands on variety, rather than the more effective spray.</p>
		<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>
		<p>She turns over on her front and he begins to attentively apply the liquid. It is a scene that should, by rights, carry strong sexual overtones, but it doesn't. His hands might have been soothing her skin, but her look was for me alone; and it was a look that rose my temperature far higher than the burning sun.</p>
		<p>The rest of the morning was spent either lazing about by the shore, or splashing around in the water. I don't think Seven and I exchanged more than a couple of words in all that time, but she was never far from my thoughts. I'd deluded myself with the idea that being intimate with her was a minor consideration, in comparison to the wager I had with Tom. That wasn't true. Being allowed to share something so personal with Seven was a monumental gift, and not something to be thrown away on the chance outcome of two fools' wager. I had to make her see she was worth more than that. Not because she had the body of a goddess, but because she looked in my eyes with the hope, fear and gratitude of an innocent young woman.</p>
		<p>"Seven?"</p>
		<p>Her eyes met with mine and I could tell she knew that what I was about to say was serious; her gaze wavered for a second, but when she looked at me again a decision had been made. "I think it's time we changed for lunch."</p>
		<p>She chose to ignore it.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>I made my excuses and managed to avoid having lunch with them. I had some thinking to do and I didn't expect it to be pretty.</p>
		<p>Laying down on my bed I couldn't stop thinking about the look Seven got in her eyes as I removed her robe. It was such a human look, full of insecurity but covered with trust. How could I justify what I was doing in the face of that? Playing games with the emotionless Borg was one thing, but betting on a young woman's virginity was another. I couldn't go through with it.</p>
		<p>My decision made, I realised my departure from the game would guarantee Tom's success. The pain that came with the thought of him winning one over on me was secondary to the ache in my chest at the thought of him taking her to his bed. It wasn't that he was a bad lover; I knew that when the time came he'd be gentle when needed, and whisper tender words in her ear to take away any doubt. But they'd be false words, false promises, and when it was over he'd think no more of it than a pleasant interlude. She deserves better.</p>
		<p>Deserves better? One unguarded moment on the shore and suddenly I'm putting myself forward as the champion of her virtue. I need to put this in perspective. Seven knows what's going on, no one is pulling the wool over her eyes, and she wants it to happen. A person's first time is hardly ever filled with soft music and love, I know mine wasn't, but it doesn't mean we stay locked in our ivory towers until the 'right person' comes along. Seven knows that; she's not a fool; she's made her decision and I have no right to question it.</p>
		<p>But Tom?</p>
		<p>I cannot picture then together, but I know if I did, I'd want to rip his head from it's socket. But is the alternative any better? What is so special about me that I'd be a preferable choice to Tom? I'm not a romantic. I have no experience in lying to the people I take to my bed. I couldn't look her in the face and tell her I loved her, if I didn't. How is that an improvement?</p>
		<p>She trusts me. I saw it in her eyes, and what's more, I know I wouldn't do anything to jeopardise that trust. I'd hold her in my arms and treasure the moments we had together, cherishing the gift she was offering.</p>
		<p>I'd also make damn sure she had the time of her life.</p>
		<p>God, just thinking about it is making me hot. That's another thing, all noble sentiments and philosophising aside, she makes me wet. I knew I was attracted to her after the kiss last night, but this morning's interlude has left me burning for her. In lust with the Ice Queen, I think this God forsaken planet has affected my mind.</p>
		<p>There is only one thing to do. Win the bet.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>By the time I've finished my navel gazing most of the crew had retired to their rooms to change for dinner. Knowing that Tom would have already issued an invitation to join him, I just hoped I could persuade Seven to include me in the party.</p>
		<p>When she came to the door, Seven, was dressed in the same overgrown robe she'd worn to the beach and I couldn't help hoping she'd again require assistance getting out of it.</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant?"</p>
		<p>"Seven." Lust is a definite liability when it comes to forming coherent speech. Less than twenty-four hours ago I could have stood before her spouted inanities or insults to my hearts content. Now I'm just standing here like a damn fool, waiting for her robe to drop.</p>
		<p>"Is there something you want, Lieutenant?" Oh, yeah.</p>
		<p>"May I come in?" If in doubt, fall back on politeness.</p>
		<p>"Of course."</p>
		<p>Her room is the mirror image of mine, its bare walls and comfortable bed the only things in view, except for the sliding doorways leading to the bathroom, closet, and balcony. I wonder if Tom's tried serenading her from beneath it yet?</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant?" I'm sure that is one of her favourite words, she says it enough.</p>
		<p>"Yes, Seven?"</p>
		<p>"Is there something you require? Only I need to change for dinner."</p>
		<p>"No, I'm fine. You go right ahead." I sit down on the bed and look at her expectantly. It is then that I remembered she'd already changed out of her bathing suit for lunch; which means I've probably caught her fresh from the sonic shower. I can feel myself getting tongue tied again, but push it away with a resurgence of my 'don't give a damn, say whatever you want' attitude. "I'm sure I'll enjoy the show."</p>
		<p>She doesn't look happy; I've probably interrupted her schedule and will force her to be a minute late for dinner.</p>
		<p>"Do I take it that this is your attempt at seduction?" She's definitely not happy, but I can't help but be a little hurt. I may not know what the hell I'm doing, but if I was trying to seduce her I'd be doing a lot better than this.</p>
		<p>"No." Twenty minutes ago I was dreaming of holding her in my arms and treating her like a princess. After two minutes in her company I'm back to wanting the wipe the superior look off her face. She just has a way of getting under my skin.</p>
		<p>"Then what exactly are you doing?"</p>
		<p>"I've no idea." Honesty can occasionally make you sound like a right idiot. "How did your lunch with Paris go?"</p>
		<p>"The food was adequate, but not as good as dinner last night."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you just had better company last night."</p>
		<p>"I fail to see how that could effect the taste of my meal." I notice she didn't disagree about the better company.</p>
		<p>"So, will you be dining with Tom again tonight?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Am I also invited?"</p>
		<p>"I don't recall Tom saying the invitation included you." She is definitely, one hundred per cent, pissed off at me now.</p>
		<p>"Well, can't you invite me?"</p>
		<p>"Why should I?"</p>
		<p>Standing from the bed I walk towards her, I can tell my unflinching gaze is making her uncomfortable but like a true warrior she refuses to retreat. "Because," I take hold of the lapels of her robe and bring her face to within a inch of my own, "you like," my breath feathers against her lips, and she parts them willingly, "to watch," her hands lay tentatively against my waist, "us fight," before slipping down to cup my bottom and pull our bodies into even closer contact, "over you."</p>
		<p>I go as if to kiss her, but instead loosen my hold on her robe and step out of her reach. "That's why."</p>
		<p>She's stunned. I know she's dying to call me all the names under the sun, but she won't let herself descend to that level. It would show I really got to her. "Fine, you are invited. Now go!"</p>
		<p>I know I'm going to pay for that, but I don't know how. Not being a total fool I leave before she blows a gasket.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Tom isn't happy with me being here; Seven isn't happy with me, full stop; I can't stop grinning. We don't make the most harmonious of dinner companions.</p>
		<p>"So, what's on the menu for tonight, Seven?" I'm far too cheery, but I don't care, it makes a nice change from my usual bear with a soar head routine.</p>
		<p>"Another selection of local dishes," her tone is clipped, and I know she'd rather not speak to me at all if possible.</p>
		<p>"Seven dishes, by any chance?" I love getting under her skin; it's only fair.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>We'd returned to the Mezzanine, and were once again being waited on by T'ralic. He seemed to sense the tension that surrounded our party and was doing his best to hurry our food along.</p>
		<p>"So, how are we doing so far?"</p>
		<p>My question seems to have stumped them both, even though it was only directed at Seven.</p>
		<p>"Any clear favourite?"</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant?" </p>
		<p>"Yes, Seven."</p>
		<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
		<p>She's kind of sweet when she's confused. "The seduction. I was just wondering how we were fairing."</p>
		<p>Tom looks at me as if I've lost my mind, but Seven isn't so easily shocked. "Not very well, Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>Ouch! "Really?" Somehow that scene in her room tells me differently, even if her responses had been unplanned, she'd still wanted me.</p>
		<p>"Really." She's just itching to say more. "In fact, if other Klingons' seduction skills are as limited as yours, I'm surprised the Empire hasn't dissolve through lack of propagation."</p>
		<p>Tom laughs, and I give her a big smile; sure in the knowledge that it will piss her off further. I don't know why I'm trying to annoy her so much, but it is fun.</p>
		<p>"So, Lanna, struck out." In your dreams, helm boy. "I guess you've either got it, or you haven't."</p>
		<p>For the first time since sitting down to the meal, Seven and I exchange a look of total agreement. He hasn't. It makes me wonder why she's even letting him try and seduce her; it's obvious she's not interested.</p>
		<p>"If you're so keen to find out about sex, how comes you didn't just ask the captain to oblige?"</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna!" </p>
		<p>Tom looks mortified by my question, but it's a valid point. She could have almost anyone on the ship she desires, but instead she waits until she overhears our bet before making an attempt. That just doesn't sound like the forward thinking Borg I know and... have started to lust after.</p>
		<p>"I do not find Captain Janeway physically appealing."</p>
		<p>"Really? I always thought she was relatively attractive, myself." Not that I had the slightest interest in the woman, she was far too authoritative for my liking.</p>
		<p>"I did not say I found her unattractive, only that she did not appeal to me on a physical level."</p>
		<p>"But we do?" Trust Tom to get to the part that flatters his ego.</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't contemplate having intercourse with someone I found unappealing." The way she says intercourse makes it sound like a science experiment; I'll have to do something about that.</p>
		<p>"Wouldn't you rather wait until you are in love?" Oh Kahless! I've gone all romantic, shoot me now!</p>
		<p>"I believe our food has arrived." Ignoring my question she turns a full wattage smile on an unsure T'ralic and begins to help herself to the various dishes.</p>
		<p>Our meal is again consumed in near silence, which gives me a good opportunity to question exactly what it is I hope to accomplish by aggravating her. I know it's enjoyable, but it's hardly likely to tempt her back to my room for a night of sweaty sex, let alone show her I'm actually rather attracted to her. I should have just kissed her in her room, at least that way I'd know for sure if she wanted me. But is wanting me enough? From what she's said she finds both Tom and I equally appealing, but that's hardly a reason to start a relationship with someone.</p>
		<p>Whoa! Relationship? Who the hell mentioned anything about a relationship? This is a purely physical, one time deal. My lust may be playing havoc with some of my higher cerebral activities, but even that's not enough to make me think Seven and I could ever have a relationship without killing each other. It would never work.</p>
		<p>But it would be nirvana while it lasted.</p>
		<p>Shut up!</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna?" Seven looks at me in concern, although Tom is again oblivious.</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"Are you, okay?" She's concerned about me; I feel a big grin coming on.</p>
		<p>"Yeah."</p>
		<p>She isn't convinced but goes back to her food anyway. </p>
		<p>Someone else has obviously requested the musicians for tonight, as they've already started to play for a couple to our right. I wonder if this time I should ask Seven to dance? Tom managed to come out of it unscathed and it would be a good opportunity to hold her close and maybe re-spark the desire that was in her eyes earlier. I'll have to time it well. Tom's already looked over to the dance floor a couple of times and is just waiting for Seven to finish her meal before popping the question.</p>
		<p>Now we're both watching her, although I think I manage to be a little more circumspect about it than Paris; he's sitting there, feet tapping to the music, and eyes glued to her fork. I nonchalantly pick up another of the orange coloured sweet rolls and pop a chunk in my mouth.</p>
		<p>Just then Seven pushes her plate away and gives the sign we've both been waiting for. I desperately try to swallow the lump of food in my mouth, but before I can do more than gulp he is escorting her towards the dance floor.</p>
		<p>Argh!</p>
		<p>At least they don't look any more compatible than they did last night; although looking good together has never been a prerequisite for jumping into bed. As they move to the music I can almost see Seven's mind working out the variables in the beat and rhythm, in an attempt to master the art. Someone should tell her that dancing is something you feel, not calculate.</p>
		<p>They are back after the one song and both look relieved.</p>
		<p>"Don't I get a dance?" Seven looks up and I know she's wishing I'd addressed that remark to Paris. No chance.</p>
		<p>"I don't..."</p>
		<p>"Please." Please isn't a word I say often, which is probably why she consented so quickly, shock.</p>
		<p>The dance floor is only tiny, which forces us to move in close, something I'm more than happy to do. She's stiff in my arms, her posture more rigid than usual. "Relax, you can't dance while standing to attention."</p>
		<p>I can tell she's trying, but it still feels as if I'm holding a piece of steel. I pull her in closer, our position more an embrace than anything else. The heat of my body eventually begins to soak into hers, and she moulds herself to me. We're hardly moving, just a sway of the hips as the song floats around us. I wish I could think of something to say to her; something poignant and maybe just a little romantic, but I can't think of anything except the feel of her in my arms. It feels so good.</p>
		<p>"Do you really want to win the bet?" Her lips are by my ear and it takes me a moment to regain my composure after the feel of her breath against my skin. Her question isn't as simple as it sounds.</p>
		<p>"Yes and no."</p>
		<p>She looks at me expecting more, and I know that now is the time.</p>
		<p>"I... I want to make love to you, but I couldn't care less about the stupid holodeck rations." When did it become making love? I thought we were meant to be talking about sex? If she refuses me now, I don't think I'll recover.</p>
		<p>The song ends and we stand there, looking at each other. I don't think she knows what to say; I know for certain I don't.</p>
		<p>"I think. I think our dessert has arrived." As she moves away from me I think I've blown it, but her hand soon entwines with mine and I know I said the right thing.</p>
		<p>As we sit down to our dessert only Tom seems capable of speech, his anecdote chosen to impress, but receiving only scant attention; both our minds are on something else.</p>
		<p>Soon our meal is complete and we begin the walk back to our quarters. This time Tom has managed to snag Seven's arm, but she is unaware of it or him. For both of us the game is over and it just waits to be seen how we handle victory.</p>
		<p>"I guess this is where we say goodnight." Tom looks very anxious, probably envisioning delivering a farewell like my own the night before. I don't want him touching her.</p>
		<p>Seven must have realised the same thing, because before either of us knew it she had kissed us on the cheek and bade her farewell. The look she threw me as she closed her door told me I wouldn't be turned away if I come back later. I just had to get rid of Tom.</p>
		<p>"Night, Tom, see you in the morning."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, sure." </p>
		<p>As I walk away I look back and see he hasn't moved from his place in front of Seven's door. "Your room's that way, Paris." I remind him, jerking my head to the left. He gives me a condescending smile but doesn't budge. I'm immediately by his side, staring at Seven's closed door.</p>
		<p>"Look, Lanna, I didn't want to rub your nose in it, but it's obvious Seven and I are gonna get it on. I suggest you go back to your room, there might be an interested vid on the player."</p>
		<p>The little shit. </p>
		<p>"And what exactly makes you think you've got a chance in hell with Seven?"</p>
		<p>"A man knows these things." Tom Paris wouldn't know a brick if it hit him on the head.</p>
		<p>"You self important little..."</p>
		<p>"Will you two please keep the noise down! I refuse to have my personal life broadcast to the entire away team." Seven's back and not looking too happy. I give her an apologetic smile and hope I haven't just ruined my chances of a memorable night.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Sev," Tom gives her one of his best smiles but I think we're both still caught up on the weird shortening of her name to notice it. It's strange enough that since our separation he's started calling me Lanna, when I don't think he used it more than once during the time we were together, but Sev? That is so not gonna fly.</p>
		<p>"My name is Seven. Not Sev, or Annika, or even the Ice Queen," I blanche at that one, "do you understand me?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, Seven." I nod too, even though her anger isn't directed towards me.</p>
		<p>"As for your suggestion that you and I are about to become intimate. Wrong!"</p>
		<p>She's working up a real head of steam, and I don't think I've ever seen her this enraged. I make the mistake of smiling to myself and her laser sight is immediately set on me.</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant." She grabs my arm and pulls me in the door, banging it shut in Tom's surprised face. Oh my.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>There are moments in life so filled with awkwardness that you just want to retreat into yourself until they're over. This was turning into one of those times. We both stood there, just inside the door, frozen. We both knew why we were there, but neither of us seemed able to make that first move.</p>
		<p>"Should I go?" I didn't want to leave but I didn't know how to go forward.</p>
		<p>"Do you want to?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Then don't."</p>
		<p>"If you need more time?" I no longer know what I'm saying. What happened to that oh so appealing 'don't give a damn' attitude I'd just recovered?</p>
		<p>"I don't, but I do need to tell you something," her voice is uncertain, so I know whatever it is she's not sure I'll like it.</p>
		<p>"Go ahead."</p>
		<p>She takes my hand and leads me towards the bed, but despite our new location her actions aren't sexual, only nervous.</p>
		<p>"I believe you... No. I allowed you to misunderstand my willingness to be seduced."</p>
		<p>Kahless! She doesn't really want me.</p>
		<p>"When I said I had long wished to experience the sexual act I wasn't telling the whole truth. What I meant was that I had long wished to experience it with you. I used the wager as a chance to get closer to you. I never had any intention of responding to Tom, only you." She looks down and I think it's shame I see on her face. "I tricked you into liking me."</p>
		<p>I let out a little chuckle. I can't help it, right now I'm on cloud nine, which is a damn fine number to be and no mistake. "You didn't trick me into feeling about you the way I do. Nothing could."</p>
		<p>"You have feelings for me?" I think we all forget just how innocent she can really be.</p>
		<p>"Yes, Seven, I have feelings for you." I brush my hand against her cheek and am rewarded with her beautiful smile. "I can't tell you exactly what they are right now, because I don't even know myself, but I do know that I care for you; am attracted to you beyond rational thought."</p>
		<p>She smiles again, perhaps at the idea of me being rational. If I were Tom I'd have told her I loved her, but I refuse to lie. My heart has been open to her for too short a time for such a mammoth emotion, but I can say one thing with absolute certainty. "I'm falling in love with you Seven, and it's kind of scary."</p>
		<p>"Yes, it is." She doesn't look scared at that moment. Leaning forward, to capture my lips with her own, she looks sure of everything and capable of miracles. "But we'll get through it together."</p>
		<p>Her body is pressed against mine, and I run my hands through her golden hair, marvelling not only in its texture, but my freedom to touch its silky strands at will. It is like being given the keys to a magical kingdom, only better, because I get to take her with me. We sink into the bed, our caresses light but telling. We are memorising each other; sensitive areas remembered for the years to come. It is a joining of lovers who expect a future, not just a heated exchange, and it is all the more passionate because of it.</p>
		<p>Slowly our clothes disappear and we can feel the delicate touch of skin on skin. I am amazed by the warmth of her; her Nordic beauty contains an inferno of passion I never imagined. I can't stop touching her; her arms, her legs, the soft skin behind her ear that is guaranteed to make her smile. I just want to lie with her forever.</p>
		<p>She isn't a silent lover, ever caress receives a moan of applause, and with it my need for her grows. My hands, fingers, lips, are all engulfed in her; our heat consumes us both and we are soon laying exhausted in each others embrace. But our rest is only temporary, my need soon rises and I must have her; again and again and again.</p>

		<p>I think I'm in love with Iranic Prime. It is a backwater of a planet with not a single descent research facility in the whole of the southern hemisphere, but at this moment I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.</p>
		<p>Waking up to Seven is almost as intoxicating as going to sleep with her wrapped in your arms. Then she stretches and her head snuggles deeper into my neck and I know I was wrong; this is the most intoxicating feeling in the Quadrant. I would wake her, to share our first morning kiss, but I cannot bring myself to disturb perfection. I will just lay here for as long as I'm able and watch my love sleep.</p>
		<p>I've finally woken up to heaven.</p>
