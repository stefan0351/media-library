<!-- Touch \ Part 3 -->

<P>Richard Edwards was a tall man, at least 6'5", and had muscles straining for freedom beneath his red and black uniform. At the time the investigative team arrived at his quarters he was busy polishing his bat'leth, a present from his Klingon instructor at a prestigious martial arts training academy, the weapon was honed to a fine point, a killing blade just waiting for its next worthy opponent. With weapon still clutched in his hand Edwards answered the chime on his door, his surprise at seeing the Captain was soon over shadowed by the sight of the blonde ex-Borg standing just behind her.</P>
<P>When the door to Edwards quarters opened to reveal the bear of a man carrying a bat'leth B'Elanna immediately fell into a defensive pose, her body partially blocking that of Seven's and her muscles primed ready for attack. Tuvok was also on the alert, his mind calculating defence scenarios quicker than the supposed attacker had time to blink. Both had their eyes glued to the hand grasping the weapon, and so both were caught slightly off guard when the bat'leth fell to the floor, a dull thud marking its harmless position resting on the carpet.</P>
<P>Astonished the four watched as Edwards appeared to loose his balance and after stumbling a few feet back into the room collapsed in a boneless heap on the floor, the sound of uncontrollable sobbing the only noise in the room. Sharing a bewildered look with the others Janeway stepped fully into Edwards quarters, and kneeling beside the man tried to speak to him. "Lieutenant Edwards, I have some questions to ask you." The man just continued to sob, his hunched figure beginning to sway to an unknown rhythm.</P>
<P>"I'm no legal expert, but that looks a lot like proof of guilt to me." B'Elanna offered, while reaching down to retrieve the bat'leth, the man's behaviour had unsettled her but she wasn't taking any chances that the man mountain would regain his composure and try to hack them to pieces with the blade.</P>
<P>"Perhaps we should call the Doctor?" Seven asked, she found unrestrained emotional outbursts like this unnerving.</P>
<P>The sound of her voice had an instantaneous effect of Edwards, his rocking stopped and his sob's receded to a barely audible level. Looking up his eyes fixed on those of Seven. "Don't worry Laura daddy's okay." A wavering smile traversed his face before crumbling at Seven's blank expression. </P>
<P>"Who is Laura?" Disregarding Janeway's orders, and the looks she was now receiving from her Captain and Tuvok, Seven bent down to kneel besides Edwards. Her movements causing B'Elanna to rush to her side, and placing a restraining arm around her waist attempt to pull Seven away from the possible danger. "It is all right B'Elanna." Seven whispered, her eyes pleading with the other woman to trust her judgement, and although her arm remained around Seven's waist B'Elanna allowed her to move in closer to the silently weeping man. "Lieutenant, who is Laura?"</P>
<P>"My angel." Unconsciously his hand reached up to touch Seven's hair, the ex-Borg's flinch sending it plunging to the floor. "My golden haired angel."</P>
<P>"Where is she?"</P>
<P>"You're here." Puffy blood shot eyes stared at the tall blonde, indecision suddenly communicated through his stare. "Seven? Where's....are they all gone again?"</P>
<P>"All who?" Janeway interrupted, she had no idea what was going on, she'd come here to arrest some pervert for playing peeping tom with one of her crew, now she felt as if they were being given front row seats to a psychiatrists convention.</P>
<P>"Our children." He gave his answer directly to Janeway, and as if the sight of her had reopened a page in his mind he thrust out an accusing finger in her direction, his body straining to rise and meet hers. "You gave them our children!" He screamed, Seven and B'Elanna having to hold him in his place before he could accost the Captain.</P>
<P>"Shhhh," Gently rubbing his back Seven tried to calm him, her mind wondering where this instinctive gesture had originated, "gave who the children?"</P>
<P>"The Borg." Capturing one of Seven's hands Edwards stared into her eyes with desperation, "They took Laura, then Mitzoti and the twins, they'll try and reclaim you soon, and Icheb. I won't let that happen, I won't loose you again."</P>
<P>"The Borg do not have Mitzoti or the twins." Seven reasoned. "They are safe."</P>
<P>"No!" His scream pierced the room. "The Borg have them, they take everything." The rocking began again, his body curling up into a ball. "They destroy everything I love." His agitation was mounting, and with it the speed of his bodies movement.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant?" Seven's address was met with silence, the large man having retreated into himself. "Richard? Can you hear me?" Still nothing.</P>
<P>Placing a hand on Seven's shoulder Janeway caught her attention, then with a shake of the head indicated that they should leave the distraught man for the moment. Leaning back Seven permitted B'Elanna to help her stand, the feel of the other woman's hand in hers a comfort she didn't immediately let go.</P>
<P>"The Doctor will be here shortly." Janeway informed the two women. "I think it best if Edwards is sedated for now, and then when he is calmer we can try and talk to him again. Tuvok is arranging a security detail to guard him in sickbay."</P>
<P>"I would like to be there when he is questioned." Seven stated.</P>
<P>"I'm not sure that's such a good idea Seven, he doesn't appear to me to be in any state to undergo an interrogation." Looking down on Edwards Janeway's face took on a trouble expression. "He looks more in need of a therapist or counsellor, neither of which we have."</P>
<P>"I did not plan on interrogating him Captain, I thought I might be able to help, he appears to have formed a connection to me."</P>
<P>"I'll discuss it with the Doctor and Commander Chakotay, if they agree then I'll let you participate." Janeway's eyes turned to the door as it opened to admit the EMH. "For now, B'Elanna I want you to take Seven somewhere to relax." Seeing Seven about to protest Kathryn gave the Borg's Klingon shadow a stern look. "Now Lieutenant."</P>
<P>"Captain." Placing her arm around Seven's shoulders B'Elanna began guiding the young woman out. "Come on Seven, I think we could both use a drink."</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>The mess-hall was reasonably empty enabling B'Elanna to commandeer a corner table for her and Seven, the young blonde complaining that the consumption of liquid refreshment was unnecessary at that time, and that she had been away from her duties for long enough. Pushing Seven into a seat B'Elanna growled at her to, "Sit." Before retrieving their cups of tea. "Drink this." </P>
<P>Seven took a sip of the drink before scrunching up her face in disgust and pushing the offending beverage away from her. "The replicators need to be recalibrated, this liquid is overly sweetened. I can perform the procedure immediately, unless you would prefer a member of engineering to carry out the task Lieutenant?"</P>
<P>"There's nothing wrong with the tea Seven."</P>
<P>"Yes there is, it has an increased.."</P>
<P>"I asked for it to be extra sweet." B'Elanna interrupted. "Sweet tea is good for shock, I think."</P>
<P>"I am not in shock Lieutenant." Seven pushed the cup further from her. "If we are finished here I should return to Astrometrics."</P>
<P>"Stay where you are Seven." B'Elanna placed her hand over Seven's as the young blonde attempted to rise from her seat. "Those three from Stella Cartography are probably still in Astrometrics, and if you go barging in now you'll only get in their way."</P>
<P>"Are you saying I'm an encumbrance?" Indignation rolled off the perfectionist in waves.</P>
<P>"No!" B'Elanna brought her other hand up to join its twin in holding Seven's still captured hand, her fingers making small circular patterns across the Borg metal and then on to caress the skin underneath. "I didn't mean it like that." Looking up into confused blue eyes the half Klingon gave a small guilty smile, "I just don't want you to leave yet."</P>
<P>"Why?" The sensations travelling through Seven's hand were making it hard for her to concentrate, she knew she should be angry with B'Elanna, but all she could think about was how those strong yet gentle fingers were touching her, and not only her human skin but also the Borg implants. </P>
<P>"You need to talk about what just happened, with Edwards, and" B'Elanna looked down at her hands still busy holding Seven's and knew she should withdraw them, but she didn't. "I want to spend more time with you."</P>
<P>"You do?"</P>
<P>"Yes." As she answered B'Elanna indicated their linked hands. "Is that okay?"</P>
<P>Seven's fully human hand came up to join the others in a gentle hold. "Yes, it is okay." Her half smile was met by a fuller one from B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"How do you feel? About what just happened with Edwards." Although at first she had planned on asking 'how do you feel about me', the half Klingon found herself in the unusual position of loosing her nerve, and so backed out before the sentence was even complete.</P>
<P>"I am uncertain." Seven's thoughts were momentarily halted by the sight of Tom Paris and Harry entering the mess-hall, she was afraid that B'Elanna would remove her hand when she caught sight of them, but apart from a flicker of recognition in her warm brown eyes she made no move. "He wasn't hostile, that I would have understood."</P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P>"I am Borg. People dislike or even fear me because of it." Her tone was neutral but through their touch B'Elanna could feel a slight tremor run through her.</P>
<P>"You're not a Borg anymore." To stop the interruption she knew was coming B'Elanna squeezed Seven's hands. "They have no reason to dislike or fear you." Then to lighten the mood she gave Seven a big smile. "Not until they get to know you anyway." </P>
<P>"You dislike and fear me?" Seven knew B'Elanna had meant it as a joke but it was a question she had long wanted the answer to.</P>
<P>"No." Suddenly she wished she'd just let Seven go back to work. "I was never afraid of you, and I don't dislike you now."</P>
<P>"But you did?"</P>
<P>"No. Yes. I don't know." Bringing up one of her hands B'Elanna raked her fingers through her hair trying to work out how best to explain her previous feelings towards the blonde. Then fearing how the abandoned touch might look, returned her hand to intertwine with Seven's. "You annoyed me, you always thought you were right and you had no manners. I know I said hurtful things about you being a Borg, but if you'd been a Vulcan or Bolian or anything else I would have said the same, only blamed it on that culture instead of the Borg, but I am sorry if I hurt you."</P>
<P>"So it was not the Borg you disliked, only me?" </P>
<P>"No! I'm not explaining this well, what I meant was that I didn't dislike you because you were a Borg. I just don't like it when anyone interferes with my work, or goes over my head to the Captain." B'Elanna shook her head, this just wasn't coming out right and every time she tried to explain she just seemed to get herself in deeper. "Look Seven, we had a clash of personalities that's all, but as I got to know you and you became more your own person, I realised that we're really a lot alike, and that's when I came to understand how much I do like you."</P>
<P>"Acceptable."</P>
<P>Brown eyes searched out blue, trying to see if they really had accepted what she was trying to say. The need to explain further how her feelings had changed, and to what degree, was strong but B'Elanna held back, wanting to get the discussion about Edwards out of the way first. "Lets get back to Edwards, okay?"</P>
<P>"The Captain said I could not see Lieutenant Edwards until she has discussed it with the Doctor and Commander Chakotay."</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna thought back over what she'd actually said and surpressed a smile. "I meant get back to discussing Edwards, and what he did."</P>
<P>"He watched me."</P>
<P>"Yes I know, and touched you." Trying again to make her open up B'Elanna pressed further. "What I want to know is how you feel about that?"</P>
<P>"The touch was not sexual." She deflected.</P>
<P>"I kind of realised that, I guess I was just projecting." Seven's eyebrow rose, and blushing B'Elanna continued hurriedly. "Stop trying to change the subject, how do you feel?"</P>
<P>"I... his reaction was not what I expected, I am unsure... I don't know how I feel." Seven's eyes dropped to their joint hands, she wanted to answer B'Elanna's question, more to please the other woman than a desire to examine her own feelings. "When I saw him on the floor, crying, I felt...I felt responsible."</P>
<P>"Responsible? I don't understand."</P>
<P>"When we entered his quarters I was expecting hatred or disgust, but the look in his eyes was one of....sadness." Seven appeared to retreat into herself as she thought of the weeping man, her own eyes misting with tears. "I felt as if in some way I had caused that sadness, as if I had done something to make him hurt like that."</P>
<P>"Seven don't." Without thought to anyone watching B'Elanna moved around the table to the chair next to Seven, and placing her arm around the ex-Borg's strong shoulders tried comforting the once ice princess. "You did nothing wrong. I don't know what made Edwards do what he did, but from the way he acted I think it goes back a lot further than his meeting with you." </P>
<P>"I know." Seven took pleasure in B'Elanna's nearness, although she felt guilty as her thoughts turned from her encounter with Edwards to possible closer encounters with the warm bodied half Klingon. "But I still feel responsible."</P>
<P>B'Elanna fought the urge to pull the tall blonde into her lap and rock her until the pain stopped. "Look, until we've had the chance to speak with Edwards we won't know why he did what he did, and in the meantime it would be a waste of resources to blame yourself for his actions." She lifted a brow in further imitation of the ex-Borg. "Come on lets get out of here."</P>
<P>"Where are we going?" Standing Seven was thrilled when a warm hand clasped her own and began leading her from the mess-hall.</P>
<P>"My quarters." Leading Seven towards the exit she turned to regard her, "you know its about time you had some quarters of your own."</P>
<P>"I do not require living quarters."</P>
<P>"Not even for somewhere private to invite your friends? Say for dinner or...." B'Elanna allowed her sentence to trail off, and with it the colour rise in Seven's cheeks.</P>
<P>"I shall speak with the Captain."</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>For the second time that day B'Elanna led Seven into her quarters, but unlike the first time she wasn't looking for a quiet place to work, now her reasons for bringing the blonde beauty there were much more personal, and because of that she was suddenly nervous about what to say or even where to sit. Seven solved the seating problem by returning to the same place on the couch she had occupied earlier, but unfortunately for B'Elanna she remained silent, her large blue eyes staring up at the still standing half Klingon in expectation.</P>
<P>"It's getting kind of late." B'Elanna tried by way of an opening, even though she wasn't quite sure why she said it.</P>
<P>"Do you wish for me to leave?" Seven's glance dropped to the floor fearing she had outstayed her welcome.</P>
<P>"No!" B'Elanna rushed to sit by Seven, and once again taking her hand tried to reassure her. "I don't want you to go. I'm not sure why I mentioned the time, I was just...just nervous."</P>
<P>"Nervous?" An ocular implant rose. "Why would you be nervous?"</P>
<P>"I'm not used to you being here when we're not working." Talking about what was making her nervous was just increasing B'Elanna's anxiety. "Are you hungry?" She suddenly asked, both to change the subject and because her stomach had started to growl. "I could replicate us some dinner."</P>
<P>Seven had missed her last scheduled nutritional supplement, but she realised that even if she had just eaten she would still have accepted the offer of spending this personal time with the Lieutenant. "I would like that."</P>
<P>"Good. Are you still on a restricted diet?" B'Elanna asked as she neared the replicator.</P>
<P>"I can digest most substances other humans ingest, although some of the more spicy varieties can cause minor stomach pains." Seeing the half Klingon temporary chef in thought she added. "I also do not like cheese, although I am unsure why."</P>
<P>"No cheese, right." B'Elanna began inputting data into the replicator. "We all have foods we don't like Seven, it just depends on the individuals taste buds. Me, I can't stand armonds or raspberries, well except in jam and then they taste great on fresh scones."</P>
<P>"I do not believe I would like cheese even if it was turned into a jam and spread on a scone." The normally impassive ex-Borg pulled a face of pure disgust, sending B'Elanna into a fit of the giggles.</P>
<P>"Okay, don't worry I won't try and sneak any cheese into the meal disguised as anything." Still laughing B'Elanna began to set the table, refusing Seven's help when it was offered as she wanted something to occupy her thoughts, and divert them from the rather lascivious images they were supplying of herself and Seven. The rather lustful images were not something she wanted to dwell upon with Seven sitting so near to her, and even though she'd promised herself that she would act on their flirtations at the next possible opportunity, she didn't think that after the stressful day Seven had endured that she would welcome her advances.</P>
<P>Once the meal was ready the two sat down and after Seven's initial murmurs of appreciation concerning the choice of food, they continued to eat in near silence. Unlike on other occasions recently this silence was not a companionable one, instead it was uncomfortable, both women wanting to continue their flirtation, but at the same time afraid they would scare the other off. Then underneath that level of uncomfort was their equal need to move past the flirting and touch one another, which they were even more afraid to do.</P>
<P>"I found the meal constituents most agreeable." Seven praised. "Thank you."</P>
<P>"You're welcome."</P>
<P>"I should go." Seven stood rather abruptly, the atmosphere having unnerved her more than she thought. "I need to regenerate, and I wish to speak with Icheb before he begins his cycle."</P>
<P>"Okay, I guess now it really is kind of late." B'Elanna was disappointed, but also relieved, she wasn't sure she could go another ten minutes without trying to kiss those so very inviting lips. Reaching the door Seven turned to say her farewell, but B'Elanna beat her to it. "I hope we can do this again. The meal that is, not looking for a peeping tom."</P>
<P>"You would?" Seven had began to think the Klingon's silence during dinner was a sign of her indifference, but if she wished to engage in this form of social activity again, she might have been mistaken.</P>
<P>"Yes, of course I would." B'Elanna laid a gentle hand on Seven's arm, and doing so realised that she'd touched her more within the last day than in the three years preceding. "I'd like the chance to spend a lot more off-duty time with you, if you want?"</P>
<P>"I would like that." Seven hesitated at the doors threshold, she didn't want to leave but didn't have the experience on how to proceed, even though her instincts were screaming at her to just kiss B'Elanna, and quickly.</P>
<P>They stood there for a moment, both wanting the same thing, both waiting for the other to make the first move. Eventually it was B'Elanna who moved, after recognising the longing in Seven's eyes she couldn't hold back anymore. Reaching up her free hand she cupped Seven's cheek, her thumb caressing the silky smooth skin as she brought their faces closer. As if out of instinct Seven's eyes closed, and when finally she felt the delicate brush of lips against her own she couldn't stop a tiny sigh from escaping. The lips soon returned, the kiss just as delicate as the first, and just as maddeningly short. This time when Seven sighed it was one of frustration, and placing her hand at the nape of B'Elanna's neck she brought them together for a third and more prolonged kiss. B'Elanna's desire not to overwhelm the inexperienced woman with her passion was quashed the second she felt the strong hand begin to caress the base of her skull, sending shock waves of desire throughout her body.</P>
<P>Using her unoccupied hand Seven encircled B'Elanna's waist and brought their bodies into closer, and more heated contact. The feel of having another body pressed so intimately to her own was a new and thrilling experience for Seven, and the fact that the body belonged to the fiery engineer was making her tremble and hold on even tighter. Just as her legs seemed to have regained their ability to work without assistance B'Elanna dropped her hand from its resting place on Seven's arm, and following a slow caress of her back the hand came to rest on Seven's behind. The feel of the hand alone was enough to send her heart into overdrive, but then with a squeeze B'Elanna pulled her closer and a moan of absolute pleasure left her lips, only to pass through the excited Klingon.</P>
<P>Feeling Seven moan was like pouring oil on B'Elanna's desire, it ignited, and the need to consume her beautiful blonde love became overwhelming. Delicately brushing her tongue against Seven's full and inviting lower lip she was soon welcomed inside. The velvety softness of Seven's tongue meeting her own in a lustful dance, each taking their turn to lead, and both revelling in the intimacy of the gesture.</P>
<P>Relinquishing her caress of B'Elanna's neck Seven allowed her fingers to slowly feel their way down the other woman's enticing form. Her hand slowing to encircle B'Elanna's breast, exerting the tiniest amount of pressure, but enough to produce a growl from deep in the Klingon's throat, before the fingers carried on in their quest, a quest to find a way inside the restrictive uniform. Somehow managing to squeeze into the non-existent space between them, Seven's fingers found the edge of the uniforms fastening, and pulling gently, even though what she really wanted to do was rip the thing off, Seven pulled the uniform top open. Then as if they'd had years of practice her fingers found the edge of B'Elanna's t-shirt, and making their way underneath began a leisurely caress of the bare stomach before moving upwards.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's breathing started to come in short gasps as she felt Seven's hand touching her bare flesh, a shiver of desire following each pass of a finger across skin. As the gentle caress moved ever higher up her body B'Elanna wished she too could feel the skin of her soon to be lover, but all her efforts were frustrated by the mere fact she didn't know how to undo the formfitting biosuit. As Seven's hand came into contact with her bra, and made short work of releasing the front fastening clasp, B'Elanna could wait no longer. Regretfully breaking off from the kiss, she planted smaller kisses along Seven's jaw until her lips were resting next to the delicate ear. "How..Oohhhhh." B'Elanna's words were cut off as Seven's finger began a slow assault on her nipple, the sensations robbing her of speech, and driving the lustful Klingon to take sanctuary in nipping at Seven's bared neck, although not enough to break the flawless surface. "Mmmm, tell me how," B'Elanna placed a tiny kiss to Seven's ear, followed by another, "to remove your biosuit?"</P>
<P>"In...the...back" Seven suddenly lost the ability to speak as B'Elanna's lips engulfed her earlobe, "in..in..the..collar."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hands were soon searching the neck of the tight suit, her fingers fighting for the opportunity to be the ones to free the beauty from her bindings, the once much admired blue suit now only an obstacle.</P>
<P>"Icheb to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>Two sets of hands stopped their wandering, although for a moment neither could understand where the interruption had come from. Then reluctantly moving slightly away, and more reluctantly removing her hand from inside B'Elanna's top, Seven activated her comm. "Yes Icheb. Is anything wrong?"</P>
<P>"No." There was a definite note of relief in the young man's voice. "I just wanted to know you were all ri...that the investigation was progressing adequately." He covered, still not used to showing his emotions so openly. </P>
<P>"The investigation has been successful." Seven felt guilty for failing to keep the young man up to date on the investigation, she knew he had been concerned but still she had allowed herself to be side-tracked by the prospect of spending time with B'Elanna. Sharing a slightly embarrassed look with her almost lover, Seven couldn't feel guilty about wanting to be with the woman, but she knew she must hold back on her desires, at least until after she had allayed Icheb's fears. "I shall return to Cargo Bay 2 shortly, I will inform you of the situation then." With that Seven cut off the link and reluctantly faced what she thought would be an angered half Klingon. "I am sorry."</P>
<P>"Me too." With a groan B'Elanna let her head drop onto Seven's chest, before with a weary chuckle adding, "you've got to teach that kid about timing."</P>
<P>"I am sorry." </P>
<P>Looking up B'Elanna saw the real worry barely hidden in the blue eyes, so reaching up with both hands she pulled Seven's head down for one final kiss, this time not hurried or demanding, but loving and gentle, a kiss that she hoped conveyed the promise of more to come. "I understand, you need to speak with him, he's been worried about you." </P>
<P>"You are not angry?" </P>
<P>"No." Slipping her hands from around Seven's shoulders B'Elanna trailed them along the other woman's arms until she could grasp her hands. Bringing their joined hands to her mouth B'Elanna kissed the knuckles of both Seven's before looking up at her with eyes still full of desire. "We can finish this at a more appropriate time, when I can guarantee we won't be disturbed for hours. If that's what you want too?"</P>
<P>"Yes." Any further speech was beyond Seven, so she repeated B'Elanna's gesture by raising their joined hands and kissing the darker ones before regretfully having to leave.</P>
<P>With shaky hands B'Elanna began to straighten out her uniform jacket, her mind already trying to work out how to secure the undisturbed time she had promised Seven. Willing to part with a life times supply of replicator rations if she could get to finish what they had started here tonight.</P>
