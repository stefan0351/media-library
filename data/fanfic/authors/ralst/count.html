<p>'Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty...'</p>

<P>&quot;Lieutenant, what are you doing?&quot; Came Seven's inquisitive voice.</P>

<P>&quot;Counting.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Counting what?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing! I was just counting.&quot; B'Elanna snapped</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The Captain suggested that the next time you anger me I count to ten before I start screaming at you.&quot; B'Elanna looked Seven up and down. &quot;It is supposed to calm me down and thus stop me from killing you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Does it work?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're still alive aren't you?&quot; The half Klingon then precedes to give Seven a look that says 'carry on talking and you might not be.'</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, but you seemed to be counting for a long time just to reach ten.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Well yeah, but at ten I still wanted to rip your arm off and beat you with it, so I upped the number to one hundred.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And one hundred is sufficient to allow me to live?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So far, yes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Perhaps I should try it.&quot; Slightly wistful from the former borg.</P>

<P>&quot;Why would you need to?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There are sixty-three ways to kill a Klingon using a data pad.&quot; Seven casually waved the pad in her hand. &quot;Does that answer your question?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sixty-three?&quot; Gulp. &quot;Sure, question answered.&quot; Takes a step back. &quot;Just count to ten, erm, one hundred under your breath before comment, or action. Okay?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Acceptable.&quot;</P>

<P>The two part.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>'One hundred and twenty-one, one hundred and twenty-two, one hundred and twenty-three...'</P>

<P>&quot;Seven are you going to stand there all day, or are you going to answer me?&quot; Flared B'Elanna.</P>

<P>'One hundred and twenty-eight, one hundred and twenty-nine...'</P>

<P>&quot;Come on answer me!&quot;</P>

<P>'One hundred and thirty-five, one hundred and thirty-six...'</P>

<P>&quot;Seven!&quot; 'One, two, three..'realisation hits the frustrated engineer. &quot;Okay, so how many are you counting to?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Five hundred.&quot; Stated the ex-borg.</P>

<P>&quot;Five hundred! I only count as high as one hundred and fifty-three with you.&quot; Hands on hips, this is not a happy B'Elanna Torres.</P>

<P>&quot;Then it would appear that you are more annoying.&quot; Implant arched in a manner calculated to ruffle the other woman.</P>

<P>&quot;Me! Ha! That's rich.&quot; Getting in close B'Elanna points her finger in Seven's face. &quot;You are the most annoying person on the ship. No! In the whole quadrant.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The numbers would indicate otherwise.&quot; Seven looks down at B'Elanna's finger, &quot;Now if you do not wish to loose that digit, I suggest you remove it from my face.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are you threatening me?&quot; Hands on hips once again, and finger tightly protected inside her fist, B'Elanna glowers at the taller woman.</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>'One, two, three...'</P>

<P>'One, two, three...'</P>

<P>The two part.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>&quot;Hey Lanna, you fancy coming to the holodeck with me and Harry?&quot; Tom called on seeing his wife in the mess-hall.</P>

<P>&quot;No thanks Tom, Seven and I have some engineering proposals to work on.&quot;</P>

<P>'One, two, three...'the borg begins to chant to herself.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on, you have to take a break sometime.&quot; Whined the helmsman.</P>

<P>'One, two, three...' B'Elanna takes up the mantra.</P>

<P>'Nine, ten, eleven...'</P>

<P>&quot;I said no Tom.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We are busy Lieutenant Paris.&quot; Interrupted Seven.</P>

<P>'Eight, nine, ten...'</P>

<P>'Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen...'</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I guess if you'd rather spend your time sitting in the mess-hall going over engineering reports with your new best friend than visiting the holodeck with your husband, that's up to you.&quot; Tom crossed his arms waiting for his wife to capitulate.</P>

<P>'Twenty-nine, thirty...'</P>

<P>'Thirty-seven, thirty-eight...'</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I think I would.&quot; B'Elanna smiles at the insignificant little man and goes back to scrutinising her data pad.</P>

<P>&quot;I.&quot; Tom turns an interesting shade of red and abruptly leaves.</P>

<P>&quot;So Seven, how many do you think you would have counted up to?&quot; Smiled the half Klingon.</P>

<P>&quot;Two thousand, three hundred and forty-one, is my mean average for Mr Paris,&quot; Seven looked the other woman in the eye, &quot;but I have gone as high as three thousand two hundred and ninety-four.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really?&quot; Seeing Seven's nod B'Elanna searches her memory, &quot;I think the highest I've got with him is four thousand and twenty-one.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You have more patience than I would have thought.&quot; Admiration has entered the ex-borgs voice.</P>

<P>&quot;Not really, only after all this time I've become somewhat immune to the worst of it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It is a pity you are with someone for whom you have to develop an immunity to their annoyance.&quot; Seven takes B'Elanna's hand in both of hers.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I suppose you're right.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I no-longer count when we are arguing.&quot; Confessed Seven.</P>

<P>&quot;Me either.&quot; B'Elanna intertwined her fingers with Seven's. &quot;I've grown to like our arguments, they make me feel alive.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, for me also.&quot;</P>

<P>They leave, together.</P>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>&quot;One, two, three, four,&quot; little Annika counted out loud as she tries to dance with Seven.</P>

<P>&quot;You're doing great Anni.&quot; Calls B'Elanna on entering the room to find her wife and child practising, yet again, for the Captain's birthday dance.</P>

<P>&quot;Two, three, four. One, two...&quot;</P>

<P>Seven smiles over the head of the four year old, while trying desperately not to step on her daughters toe.</P>

<P>&quot;Just count under your breath Seven, you'll soon pick it up.&quot; B'Elanna laughingly advises the suddenly uncoordinated woman.</P>

<P>Seven grins, &quot;Well if I can pick you up by doing it the fox-trot should be easy.&quot;</P>

<P>B'Elanna playfully throws a cushion at her wife before getting up to join her family at dance practice.</P>

<P>&quot;One, two, three, four. One, two...&quot;</P>
