<p>Gabrielle wrapped up the bread and cheese in a
small cloth and handed it to the old man. &quot;Are you sure you won't stay here with us
tonight?&quot; She asked as he took the small bundle.</p>

<p>&quot;No lass, but thank ye' all the same. I'll
just be on my way. It's not far to my brother's cabin. I should be there before it gets
much darker. I do thank you for all your kindness though. A place to rest for a bit, a
little food and the gentle company of a beautiful young woman.&quot; He patted her hand
and smiled.</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled back, that great big infectious
smile she had when she got the opportunity to talk with someone new. Xena just sat on a
rock and watched the two with a bemused smile as she ate some fresh rabbit stew. The bard
and Dardin, as he had become known to them, had spent the entire day talking and telling
each other stories. The old man had joined them on the road after Xena had saved him from
a couple of road bandits who thought it virtuous to rob an old man. He had traveled from
the Emerald Isle to visit his brother and had nearly made it when he ran into the thugs. </p>

<p>Gabrielle of course had been more than happy to
offer the protection of a certain warrior princess for the rest of his trip. Xena just
groaned from atop her position on Argo and proceeded down the road with the two of them
trailing behind talking and laughing. </p>

<p>Xena had decided to make camp early that day.
Argo had a loose shoe and she needed time to fix it before it got dark. So with camp set
up she went off to tend to Argo leaving the bard and her new found friend to continue
their nonstop exchanges. First he'd tell a story and then the bard would, back and forth,
it had been like that all day and the warrior needed some peace and quiet. As evening
settled in and with Argo's shoe repaired Xena returned to the camp. On the edge of camp
she stopped to watch them for a moment.</p>

<p>Gabrielle sat mesmerized as Dardin told her
another tale. Her eyes never left his face as her hand unconsciously stirred the stew with
a wooden spoon. &quot;And that's how leprechauns came to be on the Emerald Isle.&quot;
Dardin finished his tale and sat back, satisfied that he had finally topped the little
bard.</p>

<p>Xena on the other hand, just dropped her head and
shook it from side to side when she heard the word leprechauns. &quot;You have no idea
what you have started for me here tonight, old man.&quot; She mumbled to no one in
particular as she made it the rest of the way into camp. &quot;So what smells so
good?&quot; She asked as she knelt down next to Gabrielle and looked into the pot.</p>

<p>&quot;Rabbit stew.&quot; Gabrielle answered with
a hint of fear in her voice. She looked up at Xena and tried to smile. &quot;It's ready if
you&#146;re hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I'm hungry all right, but let me wash up
first I smell like sweaty horse.&quot; A protest could be heard from Argo in the distance.
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Xena called over her shoulder and made her way to the stream to clean
up a little.</p>

<p>When she returned Dardin was preparing to leave.
She took her stew and took her perch on top of the rock to watch them. She ate as they
said goodbye to each other. The old man gave Gabrielle a hug and turned to Xena. Slowly he
approached her as she lowered the bowl.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you again warrior. I owe you a great
debt.&quot; He said quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;You've made Gabrielle very happy today, you
owe me nothing.&quot; She said with a smile. &quot;Are you sure you won't stay the
night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I'll be fine. My brother is expecting
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So be it. Be careful Dardin.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man left the camp and Xena returned to
the fire to be with Gabrielle. The bard smiled at her as she ate her own stew. She chewed
for a moment, then, &quot;Xena...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Gabrielle there are no leprechauns in
Greece.&quot; She said with a smile without looking at the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure.&quot; They ate in silence. A
smile played on the lips of the warrior as the brow of the bard showed her worry. 'I know
I'm gonna go straight to Tartarus for this, but...' thought Xena as she picked her next
words carefully. &quot;There can't be leprechauns in Greece Gabrielle...&quot;</p>

<p>She looked over at Xena. &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>Trying desperately to hold back the smile that
wanted to break through. &quot;Because in Greece we have gremlins.&quot; She turned her
head and smiled as her body shook slightly with silent laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;What? We have what?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena choked back the smile and the laughter and
continued. &quot;Gremlins Gabrielle we have gremlins in Greece.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What's a gremlin?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena cleared her throat and put on her best
straight face before turning to the bard. &quot;Don't know for sure. I've never actually
seen one,&quot; fighting back the smile &quot;They're invisible you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I didn't know. I didn't even know we had
gremlins.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. I've been told that they're
about so high,&quot; She held her thumb and forefinger apart about the length of her index
finger. &quot;Long ears, round little heads, squat little bodies, two arms, two
legs...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena you're joking. You're playing with me
now...right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I'm serious that's what I've been told
about gremlins.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly the bard realized the warrior was
teasing her. The warrior knew she had been caught and she released the laughter that she
had worked so hard to control. She threw her head back and gasped for air as she tried to
stop. She wrapped her arms around her stomach as another fit over took her when she looked
at the not too amused look on Gabrielle's face. &quot;I'm sorry...Gabrielle...I
just...couldn't...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I get it now,&quot; The bard moved to
the warrior and poked her in the chest. &quot;Gremlins &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt; are &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt;
like &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt; snipes &lt;<b>poke</B>&gt;!&quot;</p>

<p>Another fit of laughter erupted from the warrior
as she thought of Gabrielle's snipe hunting expedition from the spring. </p>
<i>

<p>The warrior had initially meant for it to be a
tracking lesson, but after a couple mugs of stiff ale and a little encouragement from
Autolycus the bard was in the middle of the forest with a sack waiting for the warrior and
the thief to flush out the snipes. </p>

<p>The warrior and the thief had of course returned
to the inn and had a couple more mugs of ale...<b>and a nice dinner</B>. It was only when
the innkeeper had started to stack the chairs for the night that the drunken duo decided
to go rescue the bard. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for them she found them first. She
was not a happy bard, not at all. She was limping ever so slightly and appeared to be
missing a boot, it was difficult to tell because of the mud caked on her legs from the
knees down. She still had the sack...</p>

<p>As they approached her on the road they tried
desperately to hide their intoxicated state, with little success. Their giggles pretty
much gave them away and if that didn't the odor certainly did.</p>

<p>&quot;So this is your idea of a joke huh
Xena.&quot; Gabrielle growled as she approached them. &quot;Not funny Xena. Not one damned
bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena tried to look apologetic, but with Autolycus
standing next to her giggling to himself it just wasn't possible. She just tried to hide
the grin on her face and nod her apology. It didn't go over well with the bard, who took
it as confirmation of her last statement.</p>

<p>As the bard began to rant they tried to regroup
and behave in an effort to soothe her. &quot;So tell me Xena what other childish things do
you enjoy doing to your best friend?&quot;</p>

<p>The things that flashed through the warrior's
mind at that moment weren't childish, as a matter of fact they were down right adult. </p>

<p>Xena's body had to release some of the energy
that had built up during the last few moments and a burst of air and laughter forced
itself from her lungs, which only served to coat the bard's right side in a fine mist of
spit. With this, both guilty parties were rolling with laughter again. Xena reached out a
tentative hand to dry the bard off.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm...sorry Gabrielle...&quot; She said
with a giggle.</p>

<p>Gabrielle slapped the offending hand away.
&quot;Don't touch me.&quot; She snatched a scarf that was hanging around the thief's neck
and wiped her arm off.</p>

<p>&quot;Heeyyy...&quot; He protested.
&quot;I...ha..had...to give good di..di..di..money for that!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; The warrior agreed.
&quot;Took...took himmmm...half...a can...candle...mark...to get her
att...atten...tion.&quot; she said with a grin and a nudge to the thief.</p>

<p>&quot;So basically while I've been out in the
middle of the cold, bug infested forest in mud up to my knees... missing my dinner and
holding your damned sack...you two have been at the tavern drinking and carousing with
barmaids.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Autolycus offered.
Before he realized what had happened, he found himself enveloped in total darkness as the
bard crammed the sack over his head and torso. To drunk to extract himself he fell to the
ground and wrestled with the bag with very little success.</p>

<p>Xena was about to offer him a hand when
Gabrielle's stare caught her. Like a deer trapped by a bright light, she couldn't move.
Even as her friend continued to struggle, the enraged bard held her full attention. She
sobered up pretty quickly. Never taking her eyes off Gabrielle she slowly reached down and
groped around until she found Autolycus and helped him up. She slid the bag off his head
and handed it to him with out a word. At this point he knew they were both in big trouble.</p>
</i>

<p>The realization of how her last joke had ended
almost made her want to stop this one. Almost, but not quite...</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle, honey relax.&quot; The warrior
pulled the bard into her arms. &quot;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tease you.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle relaxed into the warrior and sighed.
&quot;You think it's funny don't you. That I'm that easy...&quot;</p>

<p>Xena placed her fingers over Gabrielle's mouth
and stopped the flow of words. &quot;Sweetheart I don't think of you as easy. Sometimes I
just like to have a little fun. I really am sorry. I won't do it anymore. I promise.&quot;
She placed a soft and gentle kiss on the bard's lips and the thoughts of gremlins were
gone from both minds.</p>

<p>As the evening became night they played with each
other as lovers do, touching slightly here, a gentle caress there, a soft kiss when the
other would least expect it. By the time they were ready for bed they had managed to
ignite fires for each other that just demanded to be put out.</p>

<p>Gabrielle slipped under the covers next to Xena.
Her naked form curling up next to the warrior's own nude body. &quot;Hmmmm,&quot; She
murmured. &quot;This feels so good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes it does.&quot; Xena agreed as she
pulled the bard on top of her and kissed her. Gabrielle's body wasted no time in becoming
one with the warrior's.</p>

<p>They made love. It was passionate. It was tender.
It was glorious. It was theirs and only theirs. They would happily share everything else
they had with the entire world if need be, but this belonged to them and only them. This
was when they became one with each other. As close to a whole as the two halves could be.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhhhh Gods...Xena...&quot; Gabrielle
moaned into the night air as her body arched and crested from the powerful orgasm that
shook her entire being. She fell back into the bedroll as Xena rejoined her and took her
into her arms, holding her as close as her body would allow.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I forgiven?&quot; The warrior whispered
as Gabrielle's head came to rest in its usual spot on Xena's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Gods yes.&quot; The bard whispered
into the shoulder as she placed little kisses on the bare flesh.</p>

<p>Xena smiled as she felt the bard fall into a deep
slumber. She kissed her love on the forehead and fell gently with her.</p>

<p>Gabrielle opened her eyes slowly at first. The
very early rays of morning sunlight were just beginning to creep into the dark sanctuary
of their campsite. She wasn't sure why she was awake this early. It certainly wasn't the
norm for her. Most mornings Xena had to threaten her with a cold splash of water to get
her up from their bedroll. It was especially difficult when they had shared such a
wonderful night, like the one of last.</p>

<p>There. That was the reason. There was something
crawling around in the bedroll. Gabrielle could feel it running on top of the blankets.
Sleeping outside as much as she and Xena did they had become accustomed to sharing their
bedroll with the occasional small critter trying to stay warm so she really wasn't
alarmed. More than anything she was amazed that it hadn't woken Xena first, generally she
woke at the very first sign of something amiss.</p>

<p>Gabrielle still wrapped in the protective arms of
her warrior had no great desire to know what little pest had decided to join them. She had
determined from its first movement that it was not a snake and that's all that really
mattered to her. She closed her eyes and tried to return to the realm of Morpheus. For a
very short time she was successful, then her eyes opened again. This time she saw it.</p>

<p>It was crouched down on Xena's other shoulder
leaning on it's haunches, staring at Gabrielle. It's tiny hands resting on its thighs and
it's little ears laid back. The scream woke the warrior...</p>

<p>For Xena it felt as if someone had grabbed the
bard and jerked her free from her embrace. Then there was that blood-curdling scream as
the cool air assaulted hot flesh where the bard had been sleeping so peacefully all night.
Gabrielle's screams continued to cut through the air as Xena bolted to her feet, sword in
hand looking for the bastard that dare bring this kind of fear into the life of the woman
she loved. Her balance was slightly off due to the ringing in her ear from the first
scream that had been torn from Gabrielle. She stumbled slightly, but recovered very
quickly to see the only other person in the campsite was the bard. She turned a full
circle a few more times before beginning to relax.</p>

<p>As Gabrielle screamed and bolted away from the
warrior, the bard watched as the tiny figure was hurled forward into a patch of high grass
when the warrior sat upright in response to the screams. She would even swear later that
she heard a tiny thump and a groan as it hit the ground. She tried to keep her eyes glued
to the spot where she thought it had landed. She grabbed her staff and headed for the
patch of grass poking into the suspected area with the end of the trusty staff. She was
past screaming now. Now she was just frightened and cold. She continued to poke at the
grass even as she felt Xena's hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle what in Tartarus was that all
about?&quot; She asked as she placed a hand on the prodding staff and took it from the
bard. She pulled her into a gentle embrace and led her back to the blankets where she
draped them around the shivering bard. She reached above the bedroll and retrieved her
cloak and tossed it over her own shoulders to ward off the morning chill. &quot;Gabrielle
what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw it Xena.&quot; She stammered through
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Xena turned and began to rebuild the fire so she
could get some hot tea into her chilled lover. &quot;Saw what?&quot; She asked as she
continued to tend to the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;A gremlin.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena stopped, thanking the Gods her back was to
the bard as the smile crossed her lips. She didn't even want to turn around right now.
&quot;Gabrielle you know there's no such thing. You saw a mouse or some other little
critter that just wanted to get warm.&quot; She answered as she bit back a giggle. </p>

<p>&quot;I know what I saw. It was just like you
said. It even had little floppy ears. Kinda like a rabbit.&quot;</p>

<p>The snort that erupted from the warrior gave her
away and the bard gave her a shove. &quot;Laugh at me will ya'. I'm telling you Xena it's
over there in the grass.&quot; Another snort and another shove. &quot;Damn it will you at
least quit laughing at me long enough to go over there and check.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena cleared her throat and stood and walked over
to the spot the bard had been poking with the staff. She knelt down and very thoroughly
ran her hands in and over the area. Satisfied that there was nothing there she turned back
to the bard and shrugged. &quot;Nothing.&quot; She said as she stood and returned to the
campfire. &quot;Gabrielle it must have been a dream.&quot; She said as she knelt before
the bard and took her hands into her own. She brought the bard's cold hands to her mouth
and blew warm air onto them. Without breaking eye contact she just gently rubbed the flesh
to warm it.</p>

<p>Gabrielle drew a deep breath, closed her eyes and
nodded in agreement. &quot;A dream. It must have been a dream.&quot; Feeling a little
embarrassed and ashamed she opened her eyes and still found the warrior watching her.
&quot;I'm sorry Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's my fault Gabrielle. I never should
have teased you last night.&quot; Xena softly kissed the bard's hands and returning to the
task of making tea. She poured water from a skin into a pot and set it to boil while she
got the leaves and the supplies for the morning meal from the saddlebags. &quot;Not much
left here. We're gonna have to pick up some supplies in the next village. We've got a
couple apples, some cheese, bread.&quot; She paused &quot;Would you like me to go catch
some fish for breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No it's too cold for you to be in knee deep
water trying to grab a slimy fish. This will be fine.&quot; Gabrielle said as she reached
for the food stuffs and began to prepare them. &quot;I think there's some stew left from
last night if you want something hot.&quot; She said as she added the leaves to the water.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw movement.
She turned her head slowly to see two little ears sticking out over a small log that lay
just a few feet away. She looked the other direction to see Xena getting dressed. She
wanted to say something, but there were no words. She wouldn't put herself through that
humiliation again. She took a small piece of bread and tossed to the other side of the
log. It landed far enough away that old long ears was going to have to go out and retrieve
it if he wanted it. She watched the bread intently, waiting. Glancing over at the two
little ears that twitched behind the wooden barrier.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on you want it.&quot; She whispered.
&quot;You know you want it. Gremlin's gotta eat too.&quot; She watched as the little
creature moved away from the log towards the bread. She mused about how cute he was
really. Long ears that swayed back and forth, little hands that seemed to only have three
fingers, solid feet that didn't appear to have any toes. Long ears picked up the bread and
appeared to be smelling it. Then he took a bite. Gabrielle smiled as she leaned forward to
get a closer look.</p>

<p>She watched him eat the bread. He watched her
too. Tiny little black eyes focused on her as she crept closer. She tore off a small piece
of cheese and held it out in front of her. Long ears sniffed the air. He crammed the last
of the bread into his mouth and took a tiny step forward.</p>

<p>Xena had finished dressing and looked over to see
her bard edging toward something that she couldn't see, with the blankets draped over her
like a tent. She took two long steps forward, &quot;What in the name of Zeus are you
doing?&quot; The warrior asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Feeding the gremlin.&quot; She replied
without even turning around to look at the warrior.</p>

<p>Xena just slapped her hand over her eyes, shook
her head and drug her hand down her face as she drew a deep breath and left her nails to
scratch her throat and neck. She splayed her fingers over her mouth as she spoke.
&quot;Gabrielle...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come here and look at him if you don't
believe me.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena took a step forward and peered over the
bard's shoulder. The empty ground before her told the warrior what she needed to know.
&quot;Okay Gabrielle I get it. Pay backs are a bitch.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle tossed the cheese to the long eared
little guy and turned to look at Xena. &quot;Pay backs? Xena what are you talking about
it's right there.&quot; She jerked her thumb over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle there's nothing there.&quot;</p>

<p>The bard turned around and he was shoving the
last of the cheese into his mouth. &quot;Xena it's right there! Can't you see it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No Gabrielle I can't see it, but hey I'm
the one who said they were invisible remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena he's right there eating a piece of
cheese.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gremlins like cheese do they?&quot; Xena
said as she smiled and turned back to the campfire.</p>

<p>&quot;Well apparently they do.&quot; The bard
replied indignantly as she got to her feet and walked over to the campfire. She watched as
her long eared little friend made his way towards the log and climbed over it. He slowly
moved toward Gabrielle, keeping his eyes on Xena. &quot;You scare him.&quot; Gabrielle
said quietly to her warrior as she slowly sat down. She didn't want to frighten it off.</p>

<p>&quot;Smart little gremlin isn't he.&quot; Xena
teased as she poured the tea. She handed the bard a cup. &quot;How do you know it's a
he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just a feeling.&quot; Long ears moved
closer to Gabrielle and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Does your little friend want some
tea?&quot; The warrior asked with a grin and a chuckle. &quot;No wait we left our teeny
tiny tea cup in our other saddlebags. Sorry.&quot; Xena's laughter came freely now.</p>

<p>Gabrielle noticed that long ears seemed to droop
a little when Xena began laughing. He kicked the ground at his feet and turned and walked
away. &quot;Aw great now you hurt his feelings. He's leaving.&quot;</p>

<p>With tears streaming down her cheeks from
laughing Xena sat down to put her boots on. She slipped them on, but stopped long enough
to wipe the tears from her cheeks. She looked at the bard who was not amused. </p>

<p>&quot;You know Xena I'm hurt that you don't
believe me. How much do we have to go through before you take me at my word?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right Gabrielle this has gone on long
enough. You and I both know there's no such thing as gremlins.&quot; And with that as her
final word on the subject, Xena stood up, brushed imaginary dirt from her leathers. With
her held high, she started to take a step only to pitch forward, landing flat on her face.
She looked down and found that the laces of her boots had been tightly knotted together.
She looked over at the bard, who sat with her chin resting on her fist, just watching.</p>

<p>&quot;You were saying...&quot; The bard said
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Xena rolled over, sat up and growled, &quot;I
don't know how you did that, but it wasn't funny.&quot; She said as she picked at the
knotted laces.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I give up!&quot; Gabrielle growled back
as she stood up and returned to the bedroll for her clothes. She dressed quickly and sat
down to put her own boots on. Long ears popped up in front of her and stood between her
feet. &quot;That wasn't nice.&quot; She whispered as she laced her boots. Long ears
lowered his eyes and shifted back and forth. &quot;You understand don't you?&quot; He
raised his head and gave her a little gremlin smile and nodded. &quot;Well then you're
going to have to behave. You can't afford to make her mad.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena looked over at Gabrielle and watched her
talk to her feet. 'We've been on the road too long. She needs a rest' Xena thought as she
finished lacing up her boots. &quot;Ah, Gabrielle...&quot; She said softly, trying not to
startle her obviously road weary, reality challenged lover. &quot;Whaddya say we get a
room in the next village and take a couple days off.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked over at Xena. She was still
upset with the warrior and it still showed. She tried not to sound as irritated as she
felt. &quot;I'd like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay then. When we get to Onlet, we'll get
a room and just relax for a couple of days. Maybe you can do a little shopping...I can get
Argo's shoes fixed up properly...&quot; Xena's words faded as she began packing up camp.</p>

<p>Gabrielle reached out her hand and long ears
jumped into her palm. She raised her hand to her face to get a better look at him. He
smiled at her. She could see what she thought might be an incredibly sharp little set of
teeth. &quot;You don't bite do you?&quot; He shook his head no and rubbed his little face
against her thumb. Then he noticed Xena had bent over to retrieve something leaving her
backside unguarded. He looked to Gabrielle and gnashed his teeth. Gabrielle glanced over
and then back to him. &quot;Nooo don't do that. That would be bad.&quot; She said with a
smile. Long ears nodded his understanding. &quot;So what are we gonna do with you? I
suppose I should get you back into the woods huh?&quot; Long ears wrapped himself around
Gabrielle's thumb and shook his head no.</p>

<p>Xena glanced over at Gabrielle. She raised her
eyebrows and whistled under her breath. &quot;She may need more than a couple of
days...&quot; She said quietly as she picked up her saddle and bridle. &quot;I'm going to
get Argo. Can you...and your little friend...finish up here?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle knew that Xena didn't believe her, so
she decided just to humor her. &quot;Sure we'll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena, on the other hand felt a great deal of
guilt for pushing her lover around the bend and knew she would do anything she had to do
to bring Gabrielle back to reality. Even if it meant humoring her for the moment.</p>

<p>As she approached the golden war-horse she
dropped the tack and leaned forward and rested her head on the horse&#146;s neck. &quot;Oh
girl I've really done it now.&quot; She said as she patted her beloved mare. &quot;I've
gone too far with her and she's snapped.&quot; Argo knickered and nodded her head.
&quot;We've got to help her girl. I've got to get her back.&quot; Xena reached down and
tossed a blanket over Argo's back. &quot;We've got to humor her for now girl.&quot; She
tossed the saddle up next. &quot;If she says she sees gremlins, then she sees gremlins,
got it.&quot; Again Argo nodded.</p>

<p>Gabrielle finished packing up camp as long ears
sat on a rock and watched her. He sat with his legs out in front of him, hands folded in
his lap. He wiggled the tips of his feet and his ears twitched back and forth. He cocked
his head from side to side as he continued to watch her. She stacked all their gear and
waited for Xena to return with Argo. She looked over at her little friend. &quot;So what <b>am
I</B> gonna do with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Long ears slid off the rock and skittered across
the campsite and began climbing up Gabrielle's scroll bag. Once he reached the top, he
scrambled under the flap and disappeared. Gabrielle could see the leather of the bag move
as he squirmed around inside. Suddenly he appeared, his little head and hands resting on
the edge of the bag. </p>

<p>&quot;Going with me huh?&quot; She asked as she
picked up the bag and put it over her shoulder. She looked down and could see him nodding
his head. &quot;Well I certainly understand the need to get away from someplace
unpleasant. You have to behave though. No more tricks on Xena, okay?&quot; He nodded and
let out a tiny little sigh.</p>

<p>Gabrielle could hear Xena coming with Argo. She
walked towards them slowly. Xena picked up her pace, she reached out a hand as they came
closer together. Gabrielle took her hand. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; They said in unison, each
smiling at the other. &quot;It's okay.&quot; Again in unison.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's get packed up and head out.&quot;
Xena said as they moved towards the campsite. As Xena bent over to grab the saddlebags
something caught her eye. She would almost swear they were little footprints in the dirt.
'Great now I'm doing it', she thought as she hoisted the bags onto her shoulder. </p>

<p>She picked up their bedrolls in the other arm and
returned to Argo. As Xena prepared to secure their gear, Gabrielle paid careful attention
to the mare. The bard opened her scroll bag and retrieved an apple, which she noticed, had
a small bite taken from it. She looked down at the guilty party who just shrugged.
&quot;These are for Argo. Leave them alone too.&quot; She whispered. Argo snorted and
nudged the bag with her nose and blew her lips at the little intruder who had taken a bite
from one of her apples. &quot;By the Gods Argo,&quot; the bard said surprised. &quot;You
can see him too!&quot; Argo nodded and took the apple. </p>

<p>&quot;Did you say something Gabrielle?&quot; Xena
asked as she finished securing the gear and patted the horse.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah no...&quot; She lied. &quot;I didn't say
anything. Just gave Argo her morning apple.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're spoiling my horse.&quot; Xena said
with a chuckle as she vaulted up into the saddle. &quot;Would you like to ride today?
We'll make it into town early if you do.&quot; Xena offered her hand to the bard.</p>

<p>Taking Xena's hand she allowed herself to be
pulled up behind her lover. She wrapped her arms around the warrior and laid her head on
her shoulder. Xena gripped Gabrielle's arm and the four of them set off for the next town.

</table>

<p>They arrived early in the afternoon. Onlet was a
prosperous little town so it offered a variety of places to stay. Xena, decided that they
needed to be as comfortable as possible if the bard was going to relax and get better so
they took lodging in the finest inn in the village. Gabrielle didn't understand it, but
she wasn't about to argue with the warrior. They had plenty of dinars at the moment and
the thoughts of being pampered for a few days didn't seem to upset her delicate
constitution. Xena escorted her to their room and then left to stable Argo, telling the
bard to relax and that she would be back shortly.</p>

<p>Gabrielle gently put her scroll bag on the bed
and stretched out to rest for a few moments. Long ears crawled out of the bag, stretched,
rubbed his little eyes and happily bounded across the bed and climbed up into the bard's
lap. He walked up her body and then took a seat right between her breasts. She peered down
her nose at him. &quot;Better not let Xena catch you sitting there,&quot; She said with a
chuckle. &quot;She's the jealous type you know.&quot; Long ears sighed again and rested
his head in his hands, looking completely bored.</p>

<p>When the door to the room opened again, long ears
scrambled the rest of the way up the bard's body and ducked behind her shoulder burying
himself between her and the pillow. Gabrielle giggled, his movements tickled the skin on
her neck. </p>

<p>Xena looked over and smiled. &quot;What's so
funny?&quot; She asked as she closed the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nothing.&quot; Gabrielle said as she
swatted gently at the back of her neck. &quot;I've just got an itch I can't really
reach.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior grinned a wicked little grin as she
unhooked her sheath and laid it on the table. &quot;I bet I could help you scratch that
itch.&quot; She laid the chakram down next to the sword and headed for the bed.</p>

<p>Gabrielle still fishing behind her for long ears
knew she had to stall. &quot;Xena, the armor?&quot; </p>

<p>Xena paused and considered her armor and began
removing it as well. Gabrielle knew she had bought herself a few more minutes and she
continued to try and find the little gremlin without trying to appear conspicuous. Every
time Xena would look her direction she would stop her searching and just smile.</p>

<p>With the armor removed, Xena stretched out on the
bed next to Gabrielle. She leaned into the bard and gently began kissing her neck and ear.
Gabrielle's breath caught in her chest, partly from her lover&#146;s touch and partly from
the fact that she knew somewhere behind her there was a little sharp toothed gremlin just
waiting for an opportunity. Needless to say the bard was finding extremely difficult to
concentrate.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah Xena...&quot; She said softy.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The warrior replied never
removing herself from the bard's neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you think...&quot; Her words were cut
short when Xena hit 'the spot'. &quot;Oh Gods.&quot; The bard moaned, then regaining her
senses she cleared her throat and tried again. &quot;Xena...wait a...&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior pulled back and looked at the bard.
&quot;Something wrong Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>The bard wanted to say no, but the fact that long
ears was now tangled in the warrior's long dark hair made speech completely impossible.
The absurdity of the situation almost made her want to cry. She put a gentle hand on
Xena's cheek and caressed it softly, slowly inching her way toward the little prisoner
that the warrior princess was completely unaware that she had even captured.</p>

<p>&quot;Well Gabrielle is there a problem?&quot;
Xena asked, the mood slowly dissipating.</p>

<p>&quot;No sweetheart of course not.&quot;
Gabrielle said as tried to free the little troublemaker. She knew this wasn't going to be
easy. She stroked the warrior's hair trying desperately not to cause injury to any of the
affected parties soon she realized that it just wasn't going to be possible and with a
quick yank she pulled long ears loose and reached across the bed jamming him under the
scroll bag.</p>

<p>Xena sat up quickly as if she had just been
stabbed and put her hand to the side of her head. &quot;Gabrielle what in Zeus' name has
gotten into you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gray hair?&quot; The bard offered smiling
meekly at the fuming warrior.</p>

<p>&quot;Well with the way you've been acting today
it's no damned wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry love.&quot; Gabrielle said as she
reached out and pulled Xena back to her. &quot;I really am.&quot; She offered a couple of
well placed little kisses to the warrior's temple. &quot;Now where were we?&quot; She
whispered into her ear as seductively as possible while trying to keep one eye on the bag.
She watched as he crawled in the bag and settled down.</p>

<p>Xena softened and began planting little kisses
along the bard's jawline. Gabrielle fairly secure in the knowledge that her little friend
was once again safely tucked away in the bag relaxed and began to enjoy the moment. Xena's
lips were so soft and felt so good...</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and allowed herself to be
wrapped into her lover&#146;s warm embrace. Xena was so tender, so passionate with her it
was easy to give in to her warrior. The bard would deny her nothing. Her head fell back
and the flesh of her neck was exposed to the warrior&#146;s warm soft kisses. Xena wasted
no time accepting the invitation. The bard moaned. The warrior moaned. The scroll bag
rustled...</p>

<p>As the lovers spread out onto the bed, Xena's
hand came in contact with the scroll bag, which in her opinion was taking up far to much
space on the bed. She grabbed it by the strap and tossed it over her back it hit the wall
and slid to the floor. Gabrielle heard the soft thump of the leather hitting the floor.
The bard jerked her head quickly towards the sound. As she moved she managed to bring her
chin in contact with the warrior's nose. The crunch<i> </i>of the cartilage breaking was
unmistakable. Gabrielle froze and bit down on her lip. Xena pulled back and brought her
hand up to her nose, which was broken and bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle!&quot; She was still a little
shocked as the blood began to pour through her fingers. She sat up on the edge of the bed
and tried to stop the flow by tilting her head back. It had never worked on anyone she had
ever known, but at this point any port in a storm... </p>

<p>&quot;Oh Gods!&quot; The bard was up in an
instant and searching for something to stop the flow of blood. Unable to find anything she
was happy with, she grabbed a pillow from the bed and started to approach the warrior.</p>

<p>Xena looked to her left as she saw movement. When
she realized the bard was coming at her with the pillow, she was on her feet backing up.
&quot;Gabrielle I'm already having trouble breathing if you do that I'll suffocate.&quot;</p>

<p>The bard looked down at her hands and ripped the
cover from the pillow and moved towards Xena.</p>

<p>&quot;Stay there!&quot; The warrior ordered.
&quot;Just toss it over to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked at Xena and took a step towards
her. Xena took a step back. &quot;I'm serious Gabrielle, just toss me the cloth.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior's blood was snaking its way down her
arm now and the bard wanted to cry as she tossed the cloth to Xena. She watched as the
warrior finally managed to get the flow under control. She tried again to approach, but
Xena just motioned for her to back up. She did as she was silently instructed. She finally
had backed into the bed. She got back up on it and sat with her legs curled up under her.
Xena kept a wary eye on the bard as she took a seat at the table near the fireplace.</p>

<p>Gabrielle sat in silence as she watched the
warrior finally control and stop the flow of blood from her broken nose. She watched as
Xena wiped the blood from her face and arm and taking a deep breath she placed both hands
on either side of her nose and put it back in place. Gabrielle cringed at the sound of the
cartilage once again shifting. Xena drew a deep breath through her mouth and sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena I'm so sorry...&quot; The bard
whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay. I'll be fine. What was that all
about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My scroll bag...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your scroll bag? You must be kidding!&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah when you threw it across the room I
got concerned...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Concerned about what Gabrielle? That the
parchment might crinkle?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle eased herself off the bed and poured
water from a pitcher into a bowl. &quot;It's not important now.&quot; She slowly
approached Xena and knelt in front of her setting the bowl on the table. &quot;Let me get
you cleaned up.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena handed her the cloth. Gabrielle tore it up
and took the cleaner sections and dipped them in the water. She wrung out the cloth and
started with the warrior's arm, washing it clean of the blood. Then she carefully moved to
her face and washed the blood away. Both of Xena's eyes were already starting to turn
black and her nose was swollen. She flinched as Gabrielle wiped the blood away from her
upper lip and mouth. The bard's hand shook slightly as she washed the warrior's face. </p>

<p>&quot;I really am sorry.&quot; She said as she
made the final pass across her face.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay. I'll heal. It's just the first
time I've every had my nose broken. It's a little disorienting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean to tell me that in all of you
battles, with all of your wounds ...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right Gabrielle I've never broken my
nose. Always protect the face.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You really know how to make a bad situation
worse. I don't know what to say.&quot; Gabrielle said as she moved away and stood by the
window looking out.</p>

<p>Now Xena felt like a heel. She stood and crossed
to the bard and put her hands on her shoulders. &quot;It's okay really. Listen why don't
you get out and go shopping or something. The fresh air will do you some good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. Why don't we go downstairs and have
a drink. It'll make you feel better.&quot; Gabrielle said.</p>

<p>&quot;Well I don't know about better, but if I
have enough to drink maybe I just won't feel it.&quot; She tried to smile, but it hurt too
much. </p>

<p>They left their room, but not before Gabrielle
retrieved her scroll bag. She slipped her hand inside and felt long ears in the bottom of
the bag. She didn't know if he was okay or not, but she'd have to find away to find out.</p>

<p>They settled into a corner table. The shadows hid
the bruised face of the warrior princess from the other patrons. The innkeeper came to
their table and waited for an order. Gabrielle took a deep breath and ordered ale for Xena
and wine for herself as Xena kept her face down, with her forehead settled in the valley
of her hand between her thumb and forefinger. She turned her head slightly to the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Wine? At this time of day? Gabrielle do you
think that&#146;s a good idea?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the day that we&#146;ve had it&#146;s
a perfectly good idea.&quot; She smiled and laid her hand on Xena&#146;s knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay I gotta give you that. It&#146;s been
an unusual day to say the least.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah it has and I&#146;m really
sorry.&quot; She said softly as she rubbed the knee that her hand rested on.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s okay. It&#146;s as much my fault
as it is yours. I never should have teased you last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I like it when you&#146;re
playful&#133;&quot; She was about to say something else when she felt little gremlin hands
on the top of her boot. She jerked her leg suddenly and heard a little gremlin thump as
long ears fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Xena raised an eyebrow. The bard smiled. Long
ears ran across the floor of the inn, directly for the table of a rather large imposing
mountain of a man who didn&#146;t look like he would enjoy the company of a gremlin any
more than a certain warrior princess. Gabrielle held her breath as she tried to figure out
what her next move should be. She watched as the little troublemaker climbed up the large
man&#146;s pants leg, up his shirt and finally onto the table. To her absolute horror he
then climbed up the man&#146;s ale mug and dunked his head in.</p>

<p>&quot;Great, just great&#133;&quot; She mumbled
softly.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; Xena asked as the innkeeper
delivered their drinks.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nothing. I&#146;m just&#133;&quot; Her
words stopped as she watched long ears fall from the edge of the mug and tumble off the
table. He picked himself up and staggered back towards their table. She turned to Xena a
smiled weakly. </p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle what&#146;s wrong?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&#133;uh&#133;.nothing.&quot; She could
feel him climbing back up her boot. She leaned over, pretending to scratch her leg and
lifted him into her lap. She looked down, he smiled and hiccuped. &quot;Behave.&quot; She
warned him quietly.</p>

<p>Xena watched as she sipped her ale. Gabrielle was
talking to her &#145;little friend&#146; again. She sighed and she sat the mug down.</p>

<p>&quot;You okay?&quot; Gabrielle asked as she took
the warrior&#146;s hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I&#146;m fine.&quot; She said as she
brushed her thumb over Gabrielle&#146;s hand. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never better. It&#146;ll be nice to sleep
in a nice warm bed tonight. It&#146;s getting a little chilly at night for sleeping
outside.&quot; Gabrielle realized that she was making the most ridiculous small talk.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah it will.&quot; Xena was doing it
too. She simply didn&#146;t know what to say. How do you tell your best friend, the love
of your life that you think she&#146;s lost her mind? The warrior decided that she
wasn&#146;t going to go there. If Gabrielle were completely mad it wouldn&#146;t matter.
She&#146;d just adjust and do whatever needed to be done to keep her safe, even if it
meant giving up the road and making a home somewhere.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was so preoccupied with the emotions
crossing her partner&#146;s face that she didn&#146;t notice that long ears had managed to
climb up on their table and was staggering towards Xena. She brought her hand to her lips,
curled her fingers into a tight fist and held it firmly against her mouth as she watched
him scurry up the side of Xena&#146;s mug. She gasped when she watched him fall in. It was
shear reflex that plunged her hand into the mug.</p>

<p>Xena, who had been tipping her chair back on its
rear two legs was once again thrown off balance and fell backwards. Gabrielle removed her
hand from the mug and crammed long ears in her scroll bag. &quot;Stay there!&quot; She
growled as she got to her feet and moved to Xena&#146;s side. The other patrons watched
intently as the young woman knelt as the side of the warrior who made no effort to move.</p>

<p>To Gabrielle&#146;s surprise, Xena was just lying
there laughing softly to herself. Tears were forming at the corners of her blackened eyes.
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; The bard asked as she knelt down.</p>

<p>Xena&#146;s merely nodded and continued laughing.
</p>

<p>&quot;Come on let&#146;s get you up.&quot;
Gabrielle grasped her partner&#146;s arm and helped her to her feet. The warrior very
gingerly wiped the tears from her face as she tipped her chair upright.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena exactly what&#146;s so funny?&quot;
Gabrielle asked as she watched Xena take her seat and look into her now empty mug.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any idea what kind of a day
I&#146;m having?&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Why exactly did you do that?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle bit her lip. &quot;Rough one huh?&quot;
She completely ignored the second question.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah. That&#146;s an
understatement.&quot; The warrior noticed the bard&#146;s lack of answer to her last
question, but decided to drop it. She just didn&#146;t have the energy. &quot;I would
really almost prefer to fight for an entire week than have one day like this. It&#146;s
just so ridiculous it&#146;s exhausting.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle took the empty mug to the bar and got
it refilled. She also got a towel and mopped up the mess that she had made while
retrieving the drunken little gremlin. She returned the towel to the bar and watched the
other patrons in the bar as they snickered quietly at the misfortune of the woman warrior
across the room. &#145;It&#146;s a good thing they don&#146;t have a clue who they&#146;re
snickering about&#146; Gabrielle thought as she made her way back to the table.</p>

<p>&quot;You know there&#146;s only one thing that
would make my day a complete loss.&quot; Xena said as she took a sip of her ale.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#146;s that?&quot; Gabrielle said as
she took her seat.</p>

<p>From across the room at the front door, his voice
rang out. &quot;Xena! Gabrielle!&quot;</p>

<p>Xena just hung her head and shook it back and
forth slowly. &quot;That!&quot; She said as she jerked her thumb towards the door.</p>

<p>Gabrielle watched as Joxer crossed the room and
settled himself into a third chair at their table. He picked up Gabrielle&#146;s wine and
drained it. He sat it back down on the table and smiled at her. &quot;Thanks.&quot; He
said as he licked his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re welcome.&quot; She said as she
rose and crossed to the bar, smacking him on the back of the head on her way. </p>

<p>His ill-fitting helmet slipped over his eyes and
twisted catching his nose in the strap. &quot;Owww.&quot; He whined as he readjusted the
helmet and turned to the warrior. &quot;Xena! What in Tartarus happened to your
face!?&quot; He said loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, compared to what&#146;s going to
happen to yours if you don&#146;t be quiet!&quot; She growled.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot; He mumbled as Gabrielle
returned and placed a mug in front of him. She took her seat and sipped her wine.</p>

<p>&quot;So my warrior chums what brings you to
Onlet?&quot; He asked as he tipped his mug to his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;One,&quot; Xena growled. &quot;We are
not&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here for any particular reason.&quot;
Gabrielle cut her off hoping to spare Joxer&#146;s feelings from what she was sure would
be an ego crushing blow by her partner&#146;s words. &quot;We&#146;re just taking a few
days off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like she needs it.&quot; He said as
he jerked his head towards Xena, who just growled at him. &quot;It looks like she ran face
first into a&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer knock it off!&quot; Xena warned him
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena&#146;s had a rough day Joxer. You may
just want to drink your ale and be quiet.&quot; Gabrielle said softly.</p>

<p>Joxer leaned over to Gabrielle and whispered.
&quot;So what did happen?&quot;</p>

</table>

<p>Gabrielle stood and grabbed Xena by the forearms
as she stood over the body of the now gasping Joxer. &quot;Xena take it off! You&#146;re
going to kill him! Take it off!&quot; </p>

<p>Reluctantly Xena reached over and released the
pinch and Joxer began breathing again and the color began returning to his face. Gabrielle
knelt down and helped him up as Xena just turned from the table and stalked up the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;I tried to tell you! I warned you, but you
wouldn&#146;t listen. Crimeiny Joxer you can be so dense sometimes.&quot; She chastised
him as she pulled him off the floor. She sat him back down in a chair and handed him a
mug.</p>

<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; He gasped as he took a
drink of his ale.</p>

<p>&quot;You got pinched.&quot; Gabrielle growled at
him as she picked up her scroll bag and slung it over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw now why&#146;d she go and do that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you never know when to shut up. Now
just enjoy your ale, I&#146;m going to check on Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh sure, she nearly kills me and you go off
to make sure she&#146;s okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer I swear by the Gods you are the most
frustrating person I&#146;ve ever met. You irritate her and then you seemed surprised when
she retaliates. You&#146;re lucky she didn&#146;t kill you. She&#146;s had a really hard
day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everyday is a hard day for a warrior.&quot;
He said with a proud arrogance as she turned and walked away. She just shook her head as
she climbed the stairs towards their room. As she approached the door of their room she
sighed as she pushed it open. Xena was lying on the bed with a cloth over her eyes. She
didn&#146;t even look at Gabrielle as she entered the room and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn&#146;t have gotten up
today.&quot; Xena mumbled. &quot;I should have just stayed in our bedroll.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well if you remember right that&#146;s were
all this kinda started.&quot; Gabrielle said as she rubbed Xena&#146;s hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; She mumbled in agreement.
&quot;Whadya&#146; do with Joxer the Mouthy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I left him to his own devices
downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m not paying for the damage when
somebody uses him for target practice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh don&#146;t worry about that. There
won&#146;t be much damage, he&#146;s to daft to duck.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior chuckled. Gabrielle snickered at the
thought. She liked Joxer she really did but sometimes he could just be so damned annoying.
Today was one of those days. &quot;Can I get you anything?&quot; She asked Xena.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually I need some Alser root to bring
the swelling down in my face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do we have any?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. Don&#146;t suppose I could talk you
into going and getting some could I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or course you can. I&#146;ll go now and be
back soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take your time Gabrielle. I&#146;m going to
take a nap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re going to&#133;take a nap?&quot;
Gabrielle said, the surprise clear in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh. I&#146;m going to take a nap. You
got a problem with that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no. I&#146;ve just never known you to do
that before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&#146;s a first time for everything.
We&#146;re here to rest and that&#146;s what I&#146;m going to do. I&#146;ve earned it
today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes you have. You rest and I&#146;ll
be back in a bit. Do you need anything else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope just the root.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Gabrielle leaned over and
placed a soft kiss on Xena&#146;s cheek. The warrior smiled and lifted the cloth with one
hand. She peaked out from under it.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love you too.&quot; She stood up and
crossed the room to the saddlebags. She took the small bag that contained their dinars and
put it in her scroll bag. It was then she realized long ears was missing. &quot;Oh great
Zeus&#133;&quot; She groaned as she dug through the bag.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#146;s wrong Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nothing the um&#133;tip&#133;yeah
that&#146;s it&#133;the tip broke off my quill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well get another one while you&#146;re
out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll do that. Back soon.&quot;
Gabrielle dashed out the door and down the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p>

<p>When she got to the common room Joxer was still
at the table. Gabrielle went back to the table and began looking all over for the long
eared little monster. She searched all over the floor near the table, under the chairs and
the immediate area. Joxer watched her with some amusement.</p>

<p>&quot;Lose something?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh.&quot; She said as she continued her
search.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look you just told me you lost something.
Now if you&#146;d just tell me what, I could help you look for it.&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped and considered his words for a
minute. Then she shook her head to clear her mind for even considering the possibility.
&quot;I&#146;ll find it don&#146;t worry.&quot; Just as these words tumbled from her mouth
she saw him sitting contentedly between Joxer&#146;s boots. He was sipping ale from his
hands that had spilled to the floor and pooled into a puddle by the toes of Joxer&#146;s
boots.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh well that&#146;s disgusting.&quot; She
murmured as she snatched him up. She took a moment to examine him before standing up. He
didn&#146;t look and worse for the wear he was just hammered. He smiled up at her and
hiccuped again. She didn&#146;t notice when Joxer peeked under the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Watchya got there Gabby?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle jerked up and hit her head on the
underside of the table. Rubbing her head as she slowly rose on her knees to look at Joxer.
&quot;Can you see it too?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What, the little bat looking thingy? Yeah
it&#146;s right there, in your hand.&quot; He pointed to a hiccuping Long ears. </p>

<p>&quot;Well if Argo&#146;s smart enough to see
him, I suppose Joxer could be.&quot; She mumbled to herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Whaddya say? </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m not sure, but I may have just
insulted myself.&quot; She said as she pulled herself up and sat in a chair putting long
ears on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey he&#146;s kinda cute. Can I pet
him?&quot; He asked as he reached out.</p>

<p>&quot;Um I don&#146;t know&#133;&quot; She said
as she heard a little growl come from long ears.</p>

<p>Joxer jerked his hand back as long ears gnashed
his sharp little teeth in the direction of Joxer&#146;s extended finger. &quot;Geeze
Gabrielle put a muzzle on that thing will ya&#146;, it&#146;s vicious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer it&#146;s smaller than your finger.
How much damage could he do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t want to know. Has Xena seen it
yet?&quot; He asked still keeping his hand close to his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Well not exactly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keeping it a secret? Good idea. Somehow I
don&#146;t think she&#146;d be real happy with it. Especially if it tried to bite her.
She&#146;d just <b>smush</B> it into the table.&quot; The last part of his comment was
directed at long ears who just finally passed out and fell over into a little lump on the
table.</p>

<p>Gabrielle rolled him over and peered at his
little body. &quot;Well he&#146;s still breathing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can you tell?&quot; He asked as he
lowered his face and eyes to the table level as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at his little chest going up and
down.&quot; She pointed at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah I see it now.&quot;</p>

<p>They were so engrossed in watching him breath
they didn&#146;t notice the innkeeper who had been standing there long enough to think
there was something wrong with both of them. &quot;Something wrong with my table?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked up and smiled at him as she
smoothed her hands over the wood of the table. &quot;No, no it&#146;s a very nice table
actually. One of the nicest I&#146;ve ever seen. Don&#146;t you think so Joxer.&quot;</p>

<p>Joxer still wasn&#146;t paying attention and it
earned him a kick in the shin. &quot;Isn&#146;t this one of the nicest tables you&#146;ve
ever seen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Owww! Yeah, yeah it&#146;s a great
table!&quot; He said quite annoyed as he rubbed his leg.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh.&quot; The innkeeper groused as he
collected up the empties from the table. &quot;Will you two be needing anything else?
Maybe if you have one more you&#146;ll be appreciating the floor too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No thanks. We&#146;ve got some things to
do.&quot; Gabrielle said as she swept long ears up into her hand and stood up. &quot;Come
on Joxer I&#146;ve got to get some things at the market.&quot; She put the little drunk in
her scroll bag and grabbed Joxer by the arm dragging him out of the inn.</p>

<p>As they walked toward the market, Joxer reached
over and peeked under the flap of Gabrielle&#146;s bag. &quot;You know it was almost as if
that innkeeper couldn&#146;t see it.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle slapped his hands away form the bag.
&quot;He couldn&#146;t, &quot;She paused &quot;and neither can Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why can we see it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s a him not an it and I&#146;m not
sure. I guess I can see him because I believe in him, but that doesn&#146;t explain why
you can see him since you don&#146;t even know what he is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I suppose you do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah he&#146;s a gremlin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A gremlin? Oh boy you&#146;ve lost it. You
know kinda like Xena when she said the day kept repeating over and over and over
and&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah I was there remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey you know she never did say if that was
a hickey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer drop the hickey thing okay. You
really don&#146;t want to know.&quot; She smiled as she stopped at the vendor who would
have the root Xena needed.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; He asked with that certain whine
in his voice that sent chills down her spine.</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer look you couldn&#146;t handle it,
okay. Just drop it.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle was grateful when the vendor stepped
forward. Hopefully by the time she was finished Joxer would be ready to drop the hickey
subject.. &quot;Yes Miss can I help you?&quot; The aged man asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m looking for Alser root.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ve got some very nice Alser root let
me find one for you.&quot; The old man began digging in a pile of roots. Gabrielle took
the opportunity to look around the rest of the market. She wanted to find something
special for Xena to apologize for the lousy day that she had been subjected to as a result
of her new little friend.</p>

<p>Joxer eyed the flap of Gabrielle&#146;s bag, it
began to rustle. He tugged on her sleeve. &quot;Ah Gabby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not now Joxer.&quot; She never looked at
him, she continued to look at the various shops.</p>

<p>He watched as the drunk little thingy began to
crawl out of the scroll bag. &quot;Ah Gabby you really&#133;&quot; He tugged on her shirt
again. She whirled around to face him. Placing her staff squarely at the end of his nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer I swear if you don&#146;t stop that
I&#146;m gonna break your nose. I&#146;ve gotten a lot of experience in that
recently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But your little&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>He was cut off by the return of the vendor.
&quot;Here you go Miss. One fresh Alser root. Would you like me to prepare it into a
powder for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about preparing half of it into a
powder and leaving the other half whole. I&#146;m buying it for a friend and I don&#146;t
know exactly what she has in mind.&quot; </p>

<p>Joxer watched as long ears fell out of
Gabrielle&#146;s bag and dropped to the ground. He followed as the little critter
staggered into the busy market. </p>

<p>&quot;Most people use it in a powder in a
poultice for taking swelling down.&quot; The vendor continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah that&#146;s the plan, but go ahead and
leave half of it whole. She has some very unusual methods.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you wish.&quot; The vendor disappeared
with the root. </p>

<p>Gabrielle turned to talk with Joxer. &quot;Now
what did you&#133;&quot; She just shook her head when she realized he was gone. &quot;I
swear by Zeus&#133;&quot; She mumbled. She opened her scroll bag when the merchant
returned and retrieved her dinars. She paid him and took her package. She placed both
items back in the bag never noticing that one thing was missing.</p>

<p>She looked again for Joxer. She breathed a sigh
of relief when she realized he had wandered off. She just hoped for his sake, he had
brains enough not to go back to the inn to try and cheer Xena up.</p>

<p>She continued through the market place shopping
at various booths trying to find something for Xena. A new knife? No, she already had so
many of those; she was a walking weapons shop. Jewelry wasn&#146;t her style. The bard
knew full well to not even attempt an armor purchase. She fingered her staff as she
continued walking.</p>

<p>The crashing sound behind her caused her to spin,
staff in defensive mode. She watched in horror as Joxer crawled on his hands and knees
through the market knocking over tables, baskets, breaking pottery and just generally
making a mess of things.</p>

<p>&quot;Come here you little&#133;&quot; He yelled
as he lunged and sent a succession of tables crashing over.</p>

<p>Very soon the entire market was in an uproar.
Patrons and vendors alike all trying to grab a flailing Joxer, who managed to escape every
pair of hands that grabbed for him as he continued to scramble through the market.</p>

<p>Gabrielle began digging into her scroll bag.
&quot;Oh no!&quot; The realization hit her like a landslide. &quot;Damn, damn, damn!&quot;
She groaned as she ran into the commotion. By the time the trail of angry vendors ended
Gabrielle saw Joxer being held by two of the city guards.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw Zeus&#146; boots.&quot; She mumbled as
she watched them cart him off. &quot;Great, just furkin&#146; great!&quot;</p>

<p>She quickly scanned the market for any signs of
long ears. She found him at last, sitting on top of an overturned basket of fruit munching
on a cherry. She retrieved him and held him up to her face. &quot;You&#146;re beginning to
be more trouble than you&#146;re worth. If you don&#146;t behave I&#146;m going to feed
you to Xena. She likes Gremlin on a stick.&quot;</p>

<p>He dropped his ears back and let the cherry fall
from his hands. &quot;Gleep!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So behave or you&#146;re dinner
buddy!&quot; She growled.</p>

<p>He nodded and she put him back in her scroll bag
and headed for the city jail.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part Five</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&quot;A thousand dinars!&quot; She gasped.
&quot;You must be kidding! He doesn&#146;t have two dinars he can rub together.&quot;
Gabrielle said to the captain of the guard.</p>

<p>&quot;He destroyed three rows of shops. The cost
of repairs is a thousand dinars.&quot; The captain replied dryly from behind his desk,
without so much as a glance in her direction.</p>

<p>Gabrielle bit her lip as she looked over at Joxer
who held onto the bars of the cell with a look of desperation in his eyes. Shielding the
side of her face from Joxer with her hand she spoke in low tones. &quot;Captain have you
taken a good look at him.&quot; She said as she pointed at him from behind her hand,
arching her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&#133;I&#133;&quot; The captain looked
over at the prisoner who was looking at something on his finger, which he sniffed before
sticking it in his ear. &quot;Exactly what relation are you to him?&quot; He said turning
back to the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m&#133;ah&#133;well&#133;&quot; She
stammered.</p>

<p>The captain heard the words &#145;wife&#146; and
&#145;sister&#146; at the same time. &#145;Wife&#146; from Joxer, &#145;sister&#146; from
Gabrielle. Joxer jumped back as the cup thrown by the bard crashed into the bars.</p>

<p>&quot;I an <b>NOT</B> his wife. I&#146;m barely
his sister!&quot; She yelled.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah why&#146;s that?&quot; The captain
eyed her suspiciously now.</p>

<p>Again he heard two voices &#145;different
mothers&#146; from the bard, &#145;different fathers&#146; from Joxer.</p>

<p>Gabrielle wasn&#146;t exactly sure how it
happened, but when Joxer put his hand on her knee she growled at him as the captain
slammed the cell door shut. Locking her inside as well. She dropped her face into her
hands and just shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;So you wanna play a game?&quot; Joxer
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. How &#145;bout, how long will it take
Gabrielle to beat Joxer senseless if he doesn&#146;t shut up?&quot; She snarled at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Great! What are the rules?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just keep talking,&quot; She snapped.
&quot;You&#146;ll find out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh Gabby everything will be fine. Xena
will&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer, Xena is back at the inn.
Remember?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; He said as he dropped his
head and stared at his feet. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the bard felt bad. He always managed to make
her regret being so harsh with him. &quot;No, no I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m just trying to
figure out how we&#146;re going to get out of here and how we&#146;re going to explain a
thousand dinars damage to Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well it&#146;s his fault.&quot; Joxer said
as he jerked a thumb at long ears who stood on the floor, on the other side of the bars.</p>

<p>Gabrielle&#146;s head snapped around.
&quot;That&#146;s it! We&#146;ll send him to get Xena!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah Gab on problem. Xena can&#146;t see him
remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well do you have a better suggestion?&quot;
She crossed her arms in front of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm no I guess not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s settled then.&quot; She got up
and knelt down on her knees to talk to long ears. &quot;You&#146;ve got to go get
Xena!&quot; She whispered trying not to attract attention.</p>

<p>Long ears grabbed the bar with all his might, his
little body shook as he shook his head. &quot;Gleep!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look I was only joking about that gremlin
on a stick thing. She won&#146;t eat you. Tartarus in a basket I&#146;m not even sure
she&#146;ll be able to see you, but you&#146;ve got to try. You&#146;ve got to get her
here.&quot;</p>

<p>With a great deal of hesitation he let go of the
bar and headed for the door. Gabrielle looked up to see the captain staring down at her.
She smiled and gave a little laugh as she got up and smoothed her skirt. She turned her
back and leaned against the bars. &quot;I wonder what God I&#146;ve offended.&quot; She
mumbled as she looked down at Joxer, who once again had his finger stuck in his ear.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part Six</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Xena woke and decided that a quick bite to eat
might just soothe her shattered nerves. She sat once again in the corner of the inn with
her back to the wall watching the door. Gabrielle and Joxer had been gone for almost three
candle marks. She wasn&#146;t worried yet. It had been awhile since the bard had been able
to shop and she was flush with dinars at the moment. It could be some time before they
returned, so the warrior tried to relax.</p>

<p>No one noticed as Long ears came skidding into
the inn. He stopped, sniffed the air and moved to the back of the room where Xena sat
eating a light meal. He climbed up her boot and then up her armor to the table. He paced
back in forth in front of her trying to get her attention. He even stopped once and tried
waving his tiny arms. Her blew a frustrated breath and sat down on the edge of the table.
That&#146;s when it caught his eye&#133;</p>

<p>Xena didn&#146;t feel it un-hook from her waist
but she heard it hit the floor.</p>

<p>&quot; What in the name of&#133;&quot; She
didn&#146;t get to finish her sentence before she saw it roll across the floor.</p>

<p>She got up to retrieve the chakram, wondering how
it worked it free from her hip. As she grabbed for it, it seemed to roll faster. For his
part in the whole thing, Long ears was running as fast as his little legs would carry him.
His little feet just fit on the inside edge of the shiny disk allowing him to propel it
across the floor and out the door with one irate warrior hot on his tail.</p>

<p>Xena was sure she was losing her mind as she
chased her chakram out of the inn and down the street. Had her face not hurt so much she
thought she might be able to catch it but it seem to be moving faster ahead of her with
every step. She barely noticed the clean up effort going on in the market place as she
continued to follow the weapon. It finally came to rest at the door of the city jail. She
leaned over and picked it up and refastened it to her waist. She looked up at the building
and took a step forward. She wasn&#146;t sure why as her hand fell to the latch on the
door. She of course had no way of knowing that she was being pushed from behind by a
little invisible helper.</p>

<p>Once inside she realized immediately there was a
problem as Gabrielle popped up at he bars of the cell followed by Joxer. She groaned as
she approached the captain. She leaned on his desk with both her palms resting flat on the
surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. What is it?&quot; He asked, the
captain never bothered to look up from his paper work.</p>

<p>&quot;What are the charges against those
two?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#146;s in for tearing up the market and
she&#146;s in as his accomplice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how much is bail?&quot; She was
becoming increasingly annoyed at this man&#146;s refusal to look up.</p>

<p>&quot;A thousand dinars.&quot;</p>

<p>The captain looked up when the jewel handled
dagger was driven up to its hilt into the center of his desk and his paperwork.</p>

<p>&quot;If you can get it loose, it&#146;ll pay for
the bail. Now let them out.&quot; She glared at the man, who now began to tremble at the
sight of the warrior before him as he fumbled for the key to the cell. &quot;As you can
probably tell I&#146;ve had a really bad day. If I were you I&#146;d move a little faster
before I get really angry.&quot;</p>

<p>The captain all but fell out of his chair trying
to get up to go to the cell and release his prisoners. His hands were shaking so hard
Gabrielle actually had to take the keys from him and unlock the door. Once she was free
she grabbed her scroll bag and staff and then wrapped her arms around Xena&#146;s waist.
Long ears took the opportunity to climb from the toe of Xena&#146;s boot to
Gabrielle&#146;s bag.</p>

<p>&quot;So you want to tell me what happened?&quot;
She looked at Gabrielle with the eyebrow raised over her blackened eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Um&#133;well&#133;&quot; Gabrielle started
as she pulled back.</p>

<p>Joxer piped up in an effort to help his friend.
&quot;It was the&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>Xena turned and growled. &quot;I swear if the
word gremlin leaves your mouth Joxer I&#146;ll take your tongue out through the small of
your back.&quot; </p>

<p>Joxer&#146;s mouth moved, but the word would not
leave his lips. For this he thanked the Gods on Olympus.</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked over at the captain&#146;s desk
at the dagger stuck in the center. &quot;Xena it&#146;s your favorite boot dagger. I
can&#146;t let you&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>Xena took the bard under the chin and returned
her gaze to her own bruised face. &quot;It&#146;s just a dagger. You&#146;re far more
important. Besides he&#146;s going to stay here and work it off.&quot; She said with a nod
of her head towards Joxer. &quot;Once that&#146;s done he can get my dagger back and bring
it to me. Isn&#146;t that right Joxer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything you say Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena!?&quot; The captain stumbled forward.
&quot;The Destroyer of Nations?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not any more.&quot; She said softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh&#133;Xena if the lad is willing to stay
and work it off, why don&#146;t you just take your dagger now?&quot; The captain tried to
get the knife loose with no success what so ever.</p>

<p>She stepped forward and wrapped her hand around
it and pulled it free. &quot;Thanks. He&#146;ll stay and see that everything is fixed and
he&#146;ll work off the breakage.&quot; She tucked the dagger back into her boot.
&quot;Come on Gabrielle. Joxer behave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Xena.&quot; He said with his eyes
lowered to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Um&#133;Xena can I have just a moment with
Joxer.&quot; The bard asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle walked over to Joxer and took his hand.
&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what. I just messed things up
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For believing me and for staying behind to
straighten things up. I owe you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; His mood brightened.</p>

<p>&quot;Yup I sure do. Big time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll keep that in mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do that. Listen do you want me to leave
&#145;him&#146; here to help you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no you take &#145;him&#146; with you.
He&#146;s caused enough trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; The bard knew she probably
shouldn&#146;t have, but she leaned over and gave Joxer a kiss on the cheek. </p>

<p>He swooned.</p>

<p>With evening upon them and Gabrielle not having
found a gift for the warrior, she decided to pamper her instead. Xena gave in and decided
to go with it. She was just about at the end of her patience with the entire day. The bard
ordered a hot bath and let the warrior soak while she prepared the Alser root. She laid
the poultice gently across the bruised and swollen face and began massaging Xena&#146;s
temples as she soaked in the tub.</p>

<p>&quot;Better?&quot; The bard asked softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Much. Thank you Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s the least I could do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I agree. It is the least you can do.&quot;
She chuckled. With that the warrior found herself being pushed under the water. She came
back up sputtering and spitting water. &quot;Oh you are going to pay for that!&quot; She
twisted around and drug a fully clothed Gabrielle into the water with her.</p>

<p>The bard came up for air. But instead of being
mad she recognized the playfulness of the warrior. Then she wrapped her arms around her
and very, very gently kissed her. &quot;Well you&#146;re in a better mood.&quot; She
whispered into Xena&#146;s ear before giving the lobe a quick nip.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh.&quot; She began working the laces
loose on Gabrielle&#146;s top.</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re feeling
that good.&quot; She grinned as the top slid off her body and landed with a wet thwap on
the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;I just want to feel you against me.&quot;
She said as she pulled her close and continued to undress her. &quot;I need to feel you
next to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Soon the bard&#146;s clothes lay in a wet pile
next to the tub. Xena held her close for a long time. Just held her. Gabrielle loved it.
No words were being spoken yet they said volumes to each other at the slightest touch.</p>

<p>After the bath, Gabrielle slipped into one of
Xena&#146;s spare shirts and tied it off with a belt. She put on a pair of leggings that
she used when the weather got colder and tugged on her boots. Xena for her part was
dressed in a long robe and stretched out on the bed with the Alser poultice over her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll be right back.&quot; The bard
said as she gathered a few dinars and tucked them in her pocket. She checked on long ears,
who was sleeping peacefully in her scroll bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just relax I&#146;ll be right back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#146;t make me bail you out
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh don&#146;t worry I&#146;m not going that
far. Back soon.&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle slipped out of the room. Xena just
sighed contentedly and began to doze, her face already feeling better from the treatment.
True to her word the bard wasn&#146;t gone long. She returned with a dinner tray and sat
it quietly on the table. She turned and looked at her partner. She knew better than to
startle Xena from a sleep. &quot;Xena. Come on Xena wake up. I&#146;ve got our evening
meal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm&#133;okay.&quot; She sat up slowly and
dropped the poultice to the bedside table.</p>

<p>Gabrielle turned and was amazed at the difference
in Xena&#146;s face already. It appeared the bruises were starting to fade even just after
a couple of candle marks. She started to touch the warrior&#146;s face, but Xena captured
her hands. &quot;Don&#146;t Gabrielle, it still hurts and is still swollen. It just
doesn&#146;t look as bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s really amazing. You look almost
healed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah it&#146;s a good trick. If you
don&#146;t want people to know how badly injured you are. I would just prefer not to walk
around the next couple of days looking like a raccoon.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena sat down at the table bringing the bard with
her and sitting her in her lap. Gabrielle giggled, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you I need to be close to you.&quot;
She said as she reached over and poured a cup of wine and handed it to Gabrielle and then
poured one for herself. </p>

<p>Gabrielle settled into the warrior&#146;s lap and
sipped her wine. She took a piece of cheese and brought it to Xena&#146;s lips where it
was accepted with a nip to her fingers. The bard smiled, until of course she noticed the
little set of ears pop up over the edge of the table. Long ears pulled himself up and
began sniffing the air. He looked at Xena and edged closer to the food.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena will you do me a favor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know I&#146;ll do anything for you
Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Close your eyes.&quot; The warrior obeyed
with a slight smile on her lips. &quot;Xena do you believe in me?&quot; She asked as long
ears took a piece of cheese and sat down on the table, watching them.</p>

<p>&quot;You know I do Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I mean really, really believe in me? In
us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; The warrior sat there,
eyes closed a smile playing on her lips as she wondered where this line of questioning was
going. She began to wonder a little less when she felt the bard&#146;s lips touch hers.
The kiss was magnificent. It was all of the love they shared in its simplest, purest form.</p>

<p>Gabrielle ended the kiss and stroked the
warrior&#146;s cheek with the back of her hand. Xena&#146;s eyes remained closed.
&quot;Open your eyes and look at me.&quot; The bard commanded gently and the warrior
obeyed once again. Blue and green locked together. Love, desire, respect, and total trust
were reflected back and forth between them. Gabrielle smiled. &quot;Look at the
table.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena smiled, shrugged and looked over. &quot;What
in the name of Tartarus!&quot; She yelled as she bolted out of her chair, dumping the bard
on her backside on the floor. Gabrielle started to laugh until she saw Xena go for a
dagger and long ears dash behind a cup, just barely getting out of the way before the
point of the knife landed where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena wait!&quot; Gabrielle yelled as she
got to her feet and placed herself between the warrior and the table.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s a gremlin Xena. Just like you
said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aww Gabrielle that&#146;s crazy.
There&#146;s no such thing as gremlins.&quot; She said as she ran her hand through her
hair, still staring down at the table. Long ears peeked out from behind the cup, shaking
just slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously not. Look at him Xena he&#146;s
right there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why couldn&#146;t I see him until
now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I never asked you to.&quot; She
said softly as she caressed the warrior&#146;s cheek. &quot;I never asked you to believe
in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes you did, this morning back at
camp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No my love I asked you to believe me, not <b>in</B>
me.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior drew a deep breath and nodded.
&quot;I get it now.&quot; She moved past the bard and leaned over to look at the little
guy. &quot;He&#146;s kind of cute in a&#133;well&#133;um&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gremlin sort of way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah that&#146;s it.&quot; </p>

<p>She started to reach out for him, but the bard
slapped her hand back. &quot;I wouldn&#146;t do that. He&#146;s got a pretty sharp little
set of teeth in his head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has he used them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well he&#146;s gnashed them a couple of
times.&quot; She chuckled.</p>

<p>&quot;So what are we gonna do with him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well I thought maybe we&#146;d keep
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you crazy? After all the trouble
he&#146;s caused today. Gabrielle we can&#146;t take a gremlin around Greece with
us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well we just can&#146;t leave him here, in
town. That would be even worse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True. Okay well then we&#146;ll take him
back to the woods and turn him loose when we leave Onlet.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle was disappointed, but she agreed,
realizing that Xena was right. Long ears was just to unpredictable to keep. He was after
all a gremlin.</p>

<p>Xena turned and offered her arm to Gabrielle. The
bard settled in behind the warrior and Argo was nudged into motion.</p>

<p>&quot;That didn&#146;t go quite as planned did
it?&quot; The bard giggled.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no it didn&#146;t. We&#146;ll just have
to figure out something along the way to the amazons.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle ducked around the warrior to see
perched right between Argo&#146;s ears, one gremlin with his little ears blowing in the
wind.</p>
