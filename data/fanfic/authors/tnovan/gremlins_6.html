<!-- Gremlins \ Part Six -->

<p>Xena woke and decided that a quick bite to eat
might just soothe her shattered nerves. She sat once again in the corner of the inn with
her back to the wall watching the door. Gabrielle and Joxer had been gone for almost three
candle marks. She wasn&#146;t worried yet. It had been awhile since the bard had been able
to shop and she was flush with dinars at the moment. It could be some time before they
returned, so the warrior tried to relax.</p>

<p>No one noticed as Long ears came skidding into
the inn. He stopped, sniffed the air and moved to the back of the room where Xena sat
eating a light meal. He climbed up her boot and then up her armor to the table. He paced
back in forth in front of her trying to get her attention. He even stopped once and tried
waving his tiny arms. Her blew a frustrated breath and sat down on the edge of the table.
That&#146;s when it caught his eye&#133;</p>

<p>Xena didn&#146;t feel it un-hook from her waist
but she heard it hit the floor.</p>

<p>&quot; What in the name of&#133;&quot; She
didn&#146;t get to finish her sentence before she saw it roll across the floor.</p>

<p>She got up to retrieve the chakram, wondering how
it worked it free from her hip. As she grabbed for it, it seemed to roll faster. For his
part in the whole thing, Long ears was running as fast as his little legs would carry him.
His little feet just fit on the inside edge of the shiny disk allowing him to propel it
across the floor and out the door with one irate warrior hot on his tail.</p>

<p>Xena was sure she was losing her mind as she
chased her chakram out of the inn and down the street. Had her face not hurt so much she
thought she might be able to catch it but it seem to be moving faster ahead of her with
every step. She barely noticed the clean up effort going on in the market place as she
continued to follow the weapon. It finally came to rest at the door of the city jail. She
leaned over and picked it up and refastened it to her waist. She looked up at the building
and took a step forward. She wasn&#146;t sure why as her hand fell to the latch on the
door. She of course had no way of knowing that she was being pushed from behind by a
little invisible helper.</p>

<p>Once inside she realized immediately there was a
problem as Gabrielle popped up at he bars of the cell followed by Joxer. She groaned as
she approached the captain. She leaned on his desk with both her palms resting flat on the
surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. What is it?&quot; He asked, the
captain never bothered to look up from his paper work.</p>

<p>&quot;What are the charges against those
two?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#146;s in for tearing up the market and
she&#146;s in as his accomplice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how much is bail?&quot; She was
becoming increasingly annoyed at this man&#146;s refusal to look up.</p>

<p>&quot;A thousand dinars.&quot;</p>

<p>The captain looked up when the jewel handled
dagger was driven up to its hilt into the center of his desk and his paperwork.</p>

<p>&quot;If you can get it loose, it&#146;ll pay for
the bail. Now let them out.&quot; She glared at the man, who now began to tremble at the
sight of the warrior before him as he fumbled for the key to the cell. &quot;As you can
probably tell I&#146;ve had a really bad day. If I were you I&#146;d move a little faster
before I get really angry.&quot;</p>

<p>The captain all but fell out of his chair trying
to get up to go to the cell and release his prisoners. His hands were shaking so hard
Gabrielle actually had to take the keys from him and unlock the door. Once she was free
she grabbed her scroll bag and staff and then wrapped her arms around Xena&#146;s waist.
Long ears took the opportunity to climb from the toe of Xena&#146;s boot to
Gabrielle&#146;s bag.</p>

<p>&quot;So you want to tell me what happened?&quot;
She looked at Gabrielle with the eyebrow raised over her blackened eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Um&#133;well&#133;&quot; Gabrielle started
as she pulled back.</p>

<p>Joxer piped up in an effort to help his friend.
&quot;It was the&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>Xena turned and growled. &quot;I swear if the
word gremlin leaves your mouth Joxer I&#146;ll take your tongue out through the small of
your back.&quot; </p>

<p>Joxer&#146;s mouth moved, but the word would not
leave his lips. For this he thanked the Gods on Olympus.</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked over at the captain&#146;s desk
at the dagger stuck in the center. &quot;Xena it&#146;s your favorite boot dagger. I
can&#146;t let you&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>Xena took the bard under the chin and returned
her gaze to her own bruised face. &quot;It&#146;s just a dagger. You&#146;re far more
important. Besides he&#146;s going to stay here and work it off.&quot; She said with a nod
of her head towards Joxer. &quot;Once that&#146;s done he can get my dagger back and bring
it to me. Isn&#146;t that right Joxer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything you say Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena!?&quot; The captain stumbled forward.
&quot;The Destroyer of Nations?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not any more.&quot; She said softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh&#133;Xena if the lad is willing to stay
and work it off, why don&#146;t you just take your dagger now?&quot; The captain tried to
get the knife loose with no success what so ever.</p>

<p>She stepped forward and wrapped her hand around
it and pulled it free. &quot;Thanks. He&#146;ll stay and see that everything is fixed and
he&#146;ll work off the breakage.&quot; She tucked the dagger back into her boot.
&quot;Come on Gabrielle. Joxer behave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Xena.&quot; He said with his eyes
lowered to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Um&#133;Xena can I have just a moment with
Joxer.&quot; The bard asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle walked over to Joxer and took his hand.
&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what. I just messed things up
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For believing me and for staying behind to
straighten things up. I owe you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; His mood brightened.</p>

<p>&quot;Yup I sure do. Big time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll keep that in mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do that. Listen do you want me to leave
&#145;him&#146; here to help you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no you take &#145;him&#146; with you.
He&#146;s caused enough trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; The bard knew she probably
shouldn&#146;t have, but she leaned over and gave Joxer a kiss on the cheek. </p>

<p>He swooned.</p>
