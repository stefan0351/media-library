<!-- Gremlins \ Part Seven -->

<p>With evening upon them and Gabrielle not having
found a gift for the warrior, she decided to pamper her instead. Xena gave in and decided
to go with it. She was just about at the end of her patience with the entire day. The bard
ordered a hot bath and let the warrior soak while she prepared the Alser root. She laid
the poultice gently across the bruised and swollen face and began massaging Xena&#146;s
temples as she soaked in the tub.</p>

<p>&quot;Better?&quot; The bard asked softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Much. Thank you Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s the least I could do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I agree. It is the least you can do.&quot;
She chuckled. With that the warrior found herself being pushed under the water. She came
back up sputtering and spitting water. &quot;Oh you are going to pay for that!&quot; She
twisted around and drug a fully clothed Gabrielle into the water with her.</p>

<p>The bard came up for air. But instead of being
mad she recognized the playfulness of the warrior. Then she wrapped her arms around her
and very, very gently kissed her. &quot;Well you&#146;re in a better mood.&quot; She
whispered into Xena&#146;s ear before giving the lobe a quick nip.</p>

<p>&quot;Un-huh.&quot; She began working the laces
loose on Gabrielle&#146;s top.</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re feeling
that good.&quot; She grinned as the top slid off her body and landed with a wet thwap on
the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;I just want to feel you against me.&quot;
She said as she pulled her close and continued to undress her. &quot;I need to feel you
next to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Soon the bard&#146;s clothes lay in a wet pile
next to the tub. Xena held her close for a long time. Just held her. Gabrielle loved it.
No words were being spoken yet they said volumes to each other at the slightest touch.</p>

<p>After the bath, Gabrielle slipped into one of
Xena&#146;s spare shirts and tied it off with a belt. She put on a pair of leggings that
she used when the weather got colder and tugged on her boots. Xena for her part was
dressed in a long robe and stretched out on the bed with the Alser poultice over her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll be right back.&quot; The bard
said as she gathered a few dinars and tucked them in her pocket. She checked on long ears,
who was sleeping peacefully in her scroll bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just relax I&#146;ll be right back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#146;t make me bail you out
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh don&#146;t worry I&#146;m not going that
far. Back soon.&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle slipped out of the room. Xena just
sighed contentedly and began to doze, her face already feeling better from the treatment.
True to her word the bard wasn&#146;t gone long. She returned with a dinner tray and sat
it quietly on the table. She turned and looked at her partner. She knew better than to
startle Xena from a sleep. &quot;Xena. Come on Xena wake up. I&#146;ve got our evening
meal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm&#133;okay.&quot; She sat up slowly and
dropped the poultice to the bedside table.</p>

<p>Gabrielle turned and was amazed at the difference
in Xena&#146;s face already. It appeared the bruises were starting to fade even just after
a couple of candle marks. She started to touch the warrior&#146;s face, but Xena captured
her hands. &quot;Don&#146;t Gabrielle, it still hurts and is still swollen. It just
doesn&#146;t look as bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s really amazing. You look almost
healed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah it&#146;s a good trick. If you
don&#146;t want people to know how badly injured you are. I would just prefer not to walk
around the next couple of days looking like a raccoon.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena sat down at the table bringing the bard with
her and sitting her in her lap. Gabrielle giggled, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you I need to be close to you.&quot;
She said as she reached over and poured a cup of wine and handed it to Gabrielle and then
poured one for herself. </p>

<p>Gabrielle settled into the warrior&#146;s lap and
sipped her wine. She took a piece of cheese and brought it to Xena&#146;s lips where it
was accepted with a nip to her fingers. The bard smiled, until of course she noticed the
little set of ears pop up over the edge of the table. Long ears pulled himself up and
began sniffing the air. He looked at Xena and edged closer to the food.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena will you do me a favor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know I&#146;ll do anything for you
Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Close your eyes.&quot; The warrior obeyed
with a slight smile on her lips. &quot;Xena do you believe in me?&quot; She asked as long
ears took a piece of cheese and sat down on the table, watching them.</p>

<p>&quot;You know I do Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I mean really, really believe in me? In
us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; The warrior sat there,
eyes closed a smile playing on her lips as she wondered where this line of questioning was
going. She began to wonder a little less when she felt the bard&#146;s lips touch hers.
The kiss was magnificent. It was all of the love they shared in its simplest, purest form.</p>

<p>Gabrielle ended the kiss and stroked the
warrior&#146;s cheek with the back of her hand. Xena&#146;s eyes remained closed.
&quot;Open your eyes and look at me.&quot; The bard commanded gently and the warrior
obeyed once again. Blue and green locked together. Love, desire, respect, and total trust
were reflected back and forth between them. Gabrielle smiled. &quot;Look at the
table.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena smiled, shrugged and looked over. &quot;What
in the name of Tartarus!&quot; She yelled as she bolted out of her chair, dumping the bard
on her backside on the floor. Gabrielle started to laugh until she saw Xena go for a
dagger and long ears dash behind a cup, just barely getting out of the way before the
point of the knife landed where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena wait!&quot; Gabrielle yelled as she
got to her feet and placed herself between the warrior and the table.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s a gremlin Xena. Just like you
said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aww Gabrielle that&#146;s crazy.
There&#146;s no such thing as gremlins.&quot; She said as she ran her hand through her
hair, still staring down at the table. Long ears peeked out from behind the cup, shaking
just slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously not. Look at him Xena he&#146;s
right there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why couldn&#146;t I see him until
now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I never asked you to.&quot; She
said softly as she caressed the warrior&#146;s cheek. &quot;I never asked you to believe
in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes you did, this morning back at
camp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No my love I asked you to believe me, not <b>in</B>
me.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior drew a deep breath and nodded.
&quot;I get it now.&quot; She moved past the bard and leaned over to look at the little
guy. &quot;He&#146;s kind of cute in a&#133;well&#133;um&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gremlin sort of way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah that&#146;s it.&quot; </p>

<p>She started to reach out for him, but the bard
slapped her hand back. &quot;I wouldn&#146;t do that. He&#146;s got a pretty sharp little
set of teeth in his head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has he used them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well he&#146;s gnashed them a couple of
times.&quot; She chuckled.</p>

<p>&quot;So what are we gonna do with him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well I thought maybe we&#146;d keep
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you crazy? After all the trouble
he&#146;s caused today. Gabrielle we can&#146;t take a gremlin around Greece with
us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well we just can&#146;t leave him here, in
town. That would be even worse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True. Okay well then we&#146;ll take him
back to the woods and turn him loose when we leave Onlet.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle was disappointed, but she agreed,
realizing that Xena was right. Long ears was just to unpredictable to keep. He was after
all a gremlin.</p>
