<P>I can see by looking at her, that she’s tired.  Will she admit that?  No.  Still stubborn to the very end, even though we’ve been there and back.  I laugh a little as I consider that, and stare down at the little fire I had fixed lunch over.</P>

<P>&quot;Gabrielle what’s wrong?&quot;</P>

<P>I turn to her and raise my brows in question.  &quot;Wrong? Nothing’s wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Un huh.  That’s why you’re not doing that little rubbing between the eyes ‘thing’ you do when you’re upset.&quot;  She settles back next to me, leaning against the log that I’m sitting on. Her hand comes to rest on my calf and I feel her run it up and down, in a soothing gesture.</P>

<P>I stop and consider the fact that my hand is perched right between my eyebrows before I even attempt to deny it.  &quot;Okay, I’m not upset.&quot;  I drop my hand.  &quot;I’m just thinking.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.  If you were thinking, you’d be rubbing the back of your neck instead.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Xena!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well you would.  Now tell me what’s wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I want to get us a room tonight.  I think you need to sleep in a real bed.  Where it’s warm and safe.&quot;  I lean over and place my hand on her belly.  &quot;You both do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We, umm, can’t….&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t say we can’t afford it.  I know we can’t afford it.&quot;  I sigh as I poke at the fire a little.  &quot;I’m not doing a very good job of….&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh don’t even say it Gabrielle.&quot;  She twists around and growls at me just a little.  &quot;Don’t go blaming yourself because we’re low on money at the moment.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We didn’t have this problem when I was telling stories.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gabrielle things change.  We’ll manage.  We always do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I slide down next to her and rest my hand on her arm. &quot;But it’s not just the two of us anymore.  We have someone else to consider now.&quot;</P>

<P>She looks down and nods as she runs her hand over her stomach.  &quot;Some truth to that I suppose.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Undeniable evidence I think.&quot;  I smile as I lean against her.  &quot;Let me get this fire put out so we can head for town.  Tonight, my friend, you sleep in a real bed.&quot;  </P>

<P>As I get up and douse the fire I hear her groan just a little.  I look down and offer her my hand to help her to her feet.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks.&quot;  She grins at me as she stands and stretches.  Then she looks down.  &quot;Gabrielle?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Will I ever see my feet again?&quot;</P>

<P>I laugh as I pour more water on the fire and nod.  &quot;You know you will.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I have my doubts.&quot;  She teeters back and forth just a bit.  &quot;I think they’re gone for good.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Come on,&quot; I wrap my arm around her waist and lead her to the horses.  &quot;You definitely need a bed tonight.  You’re getting punchy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, just fat.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, you’re beautiful.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You’re biased.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe just a little.&quot;  I offer with a grin as I hold my thumb and finger apart just a bit.</P>

<P>&quot;Just a little?&quot;  She mimics the grin and the action.</P>

<P>&quot;Okay maybe a lot.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Un-huh.&quot;  She takes Argo’s reins as I take up the reins of my own horse.  &quot; Let’s walk for a bit.  I can use the exercise and I think Argo’s getting tired of packing me around.&quot;  Argo snorts and nods.  The mare gives her a little nudge on the shoulder as we start down the road.  &quot;Gee thanks a lot pal.  It’s a good thing Gabrielle loves me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, but I’m not carrying you around either.&quot;  I laugh as I duck her hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Watch it amazon.  I’m not going to be this way forever.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah now you’re catching on.&quot;  I turn around and grin again.  </P>

<P>It’s nice to play a little.  It finally feels like we’re getting past everything that has happened.  We’re closer than ever and I love every moment of it.</P>

<P>We arrive in the next village early in the evening.  As we stable the horses and remove their tack, she gives me a nudge.  &quot;You know sleeping in here tonight wouldn’t be too bad.  At least it’s warm and dry.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nope.  Your morning nausea is bad enough without you having to deal with the smell of manure too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh that could be ugly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’m not willing to risk it.  I promised you a bed tonight and by Zeus you will have one.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh yes ma’am.&quot;  She laughs a little as she begins brushing Argo.</P>

<P>&quot;Can you do him too?&quot;  I gesture to mine as he wanders into his stall.</P>

<P>&quot;Absolutely.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay I’ll be back soon.&quot;   I leave Xena to tend to the horses and make my way over the local inn.</P>

<P>I stop outside the door and take a deep breath before going in.  By the Gods it’s been a long time.  Inside I find it to be a busy place.  This is good.  Making my way to the counter an older man looks me over then steps forward.</P>

<P>&quot;What can I do for you?&quot;  He crosses his arms against his chest.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you have any rooms?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah I got rooms.  Six dinars a night.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t suppose you’d be willing to make a trade?&quot;</P>

<P>He quirks a brow and then leers.  &quot;Trade?  What kind of trade?&quot;</P>

<P>Oh please save me from idiots.  &quot;Not what you’re thinking that’s for sure.  I’m a bard.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really.  You don’t look like a bard.&quot;</P>

<P>I glance at my clothes and nod.  &quot;Yeah I know I probably don’t, but trust me on this one, I am.  I’d be willing to trade an evening of stories for a room.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You any good?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I used to be.  I tell some pretty good stories about Xena.&quot;</P>

<P>He laughs at me.  &quot;Yeah right.  The only one who tells good stories about Xena is her traveling companion.  A little bard named Gabrielle I think was her name.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hate to break this to you, but I’m the little bard.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then where’s Xena?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stabling our horses.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The bard walks.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The bard learned better.  Look, quit jerking my chain here and just tell me if it’s a deal.&quot;  I growl as I consider going over the counter and pummeling him senseless.  Satisfying, but not very bard like.</P>

<P>&quot;Okay.  It’s a deal.&quot;  He turns around and retrieves a key.  &quot;Even of you’re lying a little entertainment around here wouldn’t be a bad thing.&quot;</P>

<P>I snatch the key from his hand before he has a chance to change his mind.  &quot;Thanks so much.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>With our gear stowed and a small meal eaten, I take a deep breath as I prepare to go take the stage for the first time in a very long time.</P>

<P>I feel her hands on my shoulders and let my head drop back.  &quot;Yes?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You’re gonna be great.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Un-huh.&quot;</P>

<P>She turns me around to face her and smiles as she places my hands on her stomach.  &quot;We have faith in you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ooooo I knew there was a reason I loved you.&quot;</P>

<P>She wraps an arm around my shoulders and opens the door to our room.  &quot;Come on, let’s go down and let you entertain the masses.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Un-huh.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey you need the practice anyhow.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who do you think is gonna tell this child stories?&quot;  She lifts a brow.  &quot;I stink like Joxer’s radish stew when it comes to telling stories.&quot;</P>

<P>I take a deep breath and resign myself to my fate.  &quot;Let’s go.&quot;</P>

<P>We make our way downstairs.  The placed is really crowded.  Great, just great.</P>

<P>&quot;You’ll be fine.&quot;  She whispers as she pats my back and gives me a little shove, before taking a seat in a corner.  I smile as I watch her settle in with her back against the wall.  Some things never change.</P>

<P>I order two mugs of juice, one for myself and one for Xena.  Fingering mine, I make my way to the small stage.  A long sip of the juice and I take a deep breath.</P>

<P>&quot;My name is Gabrielle and I travel with Xena, the Warrior Princess….&quot;  The room goes quiet and I know I’ve got them already.  </P>

<P>Maybe we’ll spend a few days here.</P>
