<!-- Gremlins \ Part Five -->

<p>&quot;A thousand dinars!&quot; She gasped.
&quot;You must be kidding! He doesn&#146;t have two dinars he can rub together.&quot;
Gabrielle said to the captain of the guard.</p>

<p>&quot;He destroyed three rows of shops. The cost
of repairs is a thousand dinars.&quot; The captain replied dryly from behind his desk,
without so much as a glance in her direction.</p>

<p>Gabrielle bit her lip as she looked over at Joxer
who held onto the bars of the cell with a look of desperation in his eyes. Shielding the
side of her face from Joxer with her hand she spoke in low tones. &quot;Captain have you
taken a good look at him.&quot; She said as she pointed at him from behind her hand,
arching her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&#133;I&#133;&quot; The captain looked
over at the prisoner who was looking at something on his finger, which he sniffed before
sticking it in his ear. &quot;Exactly what relation are you to him?&quot; He said turning
back to the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m&#133;ah&#133;well&#133;&quot; She
stammered.</p>

<p>The captain heard the words &#145;wife&#146; and
&#145;sister&#146; at the same time. &#145;Wife&#146; from Joxer, &#145;sister&#146; from
Gabrielle. Joxer jumped back as the cup thrown by the bard crashed into the bars.</p>

<p>&quot;I an <b>NOT</B> his wife. I&#146;m barely
his sister!&quot; She yelled.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah why&#146;s that?&quot; The captain
eyed her suspiciously now.</p>

<p>Again he heard two voices &#145;different
mothers&#146; from the bard, &#145;different fathers&#146; from Joxer.</p>

<p>Gabrielle wasn&#146;t exactly sure how it
happened, but when Joxer put his hand on her knee she growled at him as the captain
slammed the cell door shut. Locking her inside as well. She dropped her face into her
hands and just shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;So you wanna play a game?&quot; Joxer
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. How &#145;bout, how long will it take
Gabrielle to beat Joxer senseless if he doesn&#146;t shut up?&quot; She snarled at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Great! What are the rules?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just keep talking,&quot; She snapped.
&quot;You&#146;ll find out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh Gabby everything will be fine. Xena
will&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer, Xena is back at the inn.
Remember?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; He said as he dropped his
head and stared at his feet. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the bard felt bad. He always managed to make
her regret being so harsh with him. &quot;No, no I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m just trying to
figure out how we&#146;re going to get out of here and how we&#146;re going to explain a
thousand dinars damage to Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well it&#146;s his fault.&quot; Joxer said
as he jerked a thumb at long ears who stood on the floor, on the other side of the bars.</p>

<p>Gabrielle&#146;s head snapped around.
&quot;That&#146;s it! We&#146;ll send him to get Xena!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah Gab on problem. Xena can&#146;t see him
remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well do you have a better suggestion?&quot;
She crossed her arms in front of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm no I guess not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s settled then.&quot; She got up
and knelt down on her knees to talk to long ears. &quot;You&#146;ve got to go get
Xena!&quot; She whispered trying not to attract attention.</p>

<p>Long ears grabbed the bar with all his might, his
little body shook as he shook his head. &quot;Gleep!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look I was only joking about that gremlin
on a stick thing. She won&#146;t eat you. Tartarus in a basket I&#146;m not even sure
she&#146;ll be able to see you, but you&#146;ve got to try. You&#146;ve got to get her
here.&quot;</p>

<p>With a great deal of hesitation he let go of the
bar and headed for the door. Gabrielle looked up to see the captain staring down at her.
She smiled and gave a little laugh as she got up and smoothed her skirt. She turned her
back and leaned against the bars. &quot;I wonder what God I&#146;ve offended.&quot; She
mumbled as she looked down at Joxer, who once again had his finger stuck in his ear.</p>
