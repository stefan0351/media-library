<p>"I'm still not completely sure about this."</p>

<p>It was about five o'clock that Friday.  Maria was pacing in Isabel's room,
picking nicknacks up and then placing them exactly in their original place
without looking at them.  She turned to Iz, "Are you positive this is the
only way?  Liz is so fragile right now.  I'm not sure that I can watch you
do this ..."</p>

<p>Isabel looked at Maria for a moment, analyzing how close to breaking down
Maria was.  Not too close.  Good.  "Fine, then go in the kitchen.  I can
send you out to get pizza.  Anything.  You don't have to be there.  In fact,
it might be better if you aren't.  We can't let her turn to you when I do
this to her."</p>

<p>"I know that.  Maybe I should go somewhere else ... No,"  Maria turned back
to Isabel, her shoulders set.  "I'm a part of this.  When she starts getting
angry at you or collapses, I might as well be there to share it with you.  I
just don't know if I can bear to see her in this kind of pain."  Maria
finally sat down next to Iz.</p>

<p>Isabel tossed Maria's hair out of the way and began massaging Maria's neck
and shoulders.  Maria always surprised Iz when she buckled down to something
this difficult.  She might get hysterical first, but she always did what was
needed.  "You can as long as you remember why I'm doing this to her.  Just
remember that you can't stop me, no matter how hard it is.  If it gets to be
too much for you, leave.  I have to be the bad guy, you have to refuse to
help, which will leave Tess.  And I know Tess; she won't be able to stand
seeing Liz in that much pain.  Tess doesn't have it in her, regardless of
what we all might think at times."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you're right.  This has to work, or I'll have lost my best
friend and Liz and Max will still be alone and miserable."</p>

<p>"It will work."  They sat in companionable silence for a few minutes.  Then,
looking at the clock, Isabel sat up. "Aren't you supposed to be picking up
Liz now, as in you should have left ten minutes ago?"</p>

<p>Maria gasped.  "Damn.  I gotta go."  She looked around frantically, "Did you
see where I put my bag?"</p>

<p>Isabel held Maria's light brown suede bag by it's embroidered straps.
"Here."</p>

<p>"Thank you, you are a life saver.  See you."</p>

<p>"Bye, Maria.  It will work out, I promise."</p>

<p>"I know, it has to."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>So far nothing had gone wrong.  Tess had arrived first and had gotten
comfortable, stretching her legs out on the couch.  She was surprised when
there was a knock on the door.</p>

<p>"Iz, did you order pizza?" she shouted back to the kitchen where Isabel was
puttering.</p>

<p>"Could you get that for me, I forgot to tell you they were coming."  Isabel
was happily mixing some punch.  She had already pulled out chips, vegetables
and dip.</p>

<p>As Tess opened the door, she shouted pack, "Who?" and then turned to see
exactly who she was letting in.</p>

<p>Seeing Maria, she opened the door further and stepped back.  Maria tightened
her grip on Liz and pulled her in.  Liz was gazing vaguely at the floor, and
Tess was focused entirely on Maria in her surprise.  They hadn't really
registered each other yet, but Maria wasn't going to give Liz the chance to
get away.</p>

<p>"So, Tess, how are you doing?" Maria asked just a little too loudly.</p>

<p>"I'm doing great.  Iz didn't tell me that she had invited you ..." Tess
finally registered Liz's presence. "Uh ... um, hi, Liz."</p>

<p>Liz's head flew up, "Hi ... Tess.  I didn't ..." her voice cracked, raw
sounding from lack of sleep, "know you would be here."  Striving to be
polite, Liz grasped for something to talk to Tess about.  "Have - have you
done that english assignment yet?"</p>

<p>Tess looked curiously at Liz, wondering if Liz would have come had she known
Tess would be there.  And then realizing that the English assignment that
Liz mentioned didn't exist.  They had one in Spanish.  She narrowed her eyes
on Liz, noting the violet bruises pressed into the soft skin under Liz's
eyes.  "No, not yet.  Um ..."</p>

<p>Liz paused, searching for something more to say but only managing to think
about the need to communicate over and over.  "So ..."</p>

<p>Isabel popped her head out of the kitchen, "Oh, great you guys are here.
I've got some food and drinks, and Tess brought some movies.  Why don't you
guys come in to the kitchen and we can talk while I clean up my punch mess."</p>

<p>And the evening continued much the same way, with Liz and Tess attempting
desperately to hold a normal conversation, and Maria and Iz filling in the
tenser moments.</p>
