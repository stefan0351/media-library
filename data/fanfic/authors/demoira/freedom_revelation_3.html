<p>Isabel had been building herself up to this all evening.  The movie had just
ended and the ice cream Maria had brought along was half empty.  Maria and
Liz had taken over the couch, while she and Tess had settled into the
recliner and the loveseat.  As she turned off the TV, Isabel looked at Maria
who nodded her head.  Taking a deep breath, she began the game.</p>

<p>"So .. I was thinking that we should play truth or dare," Isabel said with a
wicked smile on her face.</p>

<p>Maria jumped in before either Tess or Liz could object to the juvenile game,
"Definitely, I get to go first!  Liz, when was your first kiss?" she raised
her eyebrows suggestively.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I did not say I was playing.  Maria - you can't bring this up again.
  Oooo, the humilitation ..."</p>

<p>"Then is it a dare?"</p>

<p>"No way.  I know you Maria Leah Deluca.  Okay, so it was Billy Johnson,
kindergarten.  It was a Deluca dare, if you must know."</p>

<p>Isabel gagged, "Billy?  And I thought he would die never having been kissed.
  Uggh.  Shame on you Liz - and in kindergarten!"</p>

<p>"Okay, you are next.  Truth or dare?"</p>

<p>"Definitely truth.  I'm not sure I trust you any better than you trust Maria
here."</p>

<p>Liz creased her forehead tiredly, trying desperately to focus, "When are you
going to decide who you want to spend your life with?  Alex?  Michael?  Some
imaginary guy?"</p>

<p>Isabel gasped, she hadn't been expecting anything like this.  She wasn't
prepared for this question.  She groped for something to say.  Looking
desperately to Maria for help,but finding nothing but surprise in Maria's
green eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, umm, I don't really know what to say ... erm ... Maybe, um, when I
know what I feel ..."</p>

<p>Liz shook her head.  She hadn't really wanted to throw Isabel into this
turmoil.  She had simply asked the first question that came to mind.
"Nevermind," Liz dismissed the question, exhaustion evident in her
uncharacteristic tone.  "Let me know when you know.  Your turn."</p>

<p>When Isabel simply sat there distracted, Maria spoke up, "Iz, it's time.
Are you ready?" she asked significantly.</p>

<p>Isabel looked at Maria and noted how heavy with emotion Maria's eyes were.
It was time.  "Okay, Liz.  Truth or Dare?"</p>

<p>Liz rolled her eyes, "We definitely should have set the rules on this one.
No turn arounds.  Fine, truth."</p>

<p>Isabel blinked her eyes to prevent tears.  This was going to be harder than
she had thought.  Looking at Maria, her face cleared.  Somethings just have
to be, right or wrong.</p>

<p>"Liz."  Isabel cleared her throat.  "Liz.  When are you going to tell my
brother the truth?"</p>

<p>Liz looked blankly at Isabel's intent face.</p>

<p>"When are you going to tell my brother that everything he saw that night was
a lie?  When are you going to tell everyone why you lied to him?  When are
you planning on explaining to all of us what you did to save us?"</p>

<p>Liz was shaking her head and moaning in shock, feeling her life crumbling
around her, "No.  No.  Please, no ... don't."  Her eyes were filling with
tears - this couldn't be happening to her, "What are you doing?  Do you know
what you are doing?"  Liz stood, intent on stopping the flood of Isabel's
words.  Isabel was destroying months worth of suffering - rendering it all
pointless.  "No.  No ... no."</p>

<p>Pulling her determination around her as armor against Liz's pain, Isabel was
relentless, her voice getting louder and louder.  She asked, "When are you
going to tell Kyle why he pretended to sleep with you?  When are you going
to tell Michael and I about our deaths?"  Isabel was shouting now, "When are
you planning on telling Tess that she was part of the end of the world?"</p>

<p>Liz froze, paralyzed by the magnitude of what Isabel had just done.  Death.
Destruction.  All because Elizabeth Parker wasn't strong enough to stay away
from Max Evans.  All because she wasn't strong enough to keep her secret to
herself.  All because she valued her friendship with Maria above the lives
of Isabel and Michael.  All because she was weak.  All because Max had saved
her that day in September.</p>

<p>Maria watched, pain streaking through her, as Liz's face crumpled, her skin
pale and streaked with sweat.  Liz had grabbed the hair by her ears, as if
to anchor her clenched fists there more firmly all the while thrashing her
head searchingly around the room as if to prove to herself somehow that this
wasn't real.  Finally Maria gave out to a sob, turned and fled the room,
crashing into the end table on her way, uncaring for the lamp she knocked
over.</p>

<p>The thoughts crashed in Liz's mind as Isabel continued her litany.  The pain
became too immense.  Liz covered her ears, but it just made her thoughts
louder without Isabel's words there to drown them out.  Something broke and
Liz screamed, "No!  Shut up!  You don't know what you are doing," she
sobbed, "You don't know what you are doing.  Too much lost for me.  Be
quiet!  Just stop ... please ... please ..." she fell into a heap at the
foot of the sofa.</p>

<p>Tess sat shocked, staring at the sobbing girl at their feet.  She hadn't
even had the chance to register Isabel's accusations, only the terrifying
affect they had on Liz.  Tess had always thought Liz was so strong ...  "My
God, Isabel.  What did you do?  How could you do that ... to anyone?"  As
she stared at Liz, broken and sobbing on the floor there, her fingers
digging maniacally into the carpet, what Isabel said began to sink in.  Tess
tore her eyes away from Liz.  "What did you mean?  What did you mean, about
me and ..." she gulped terrified of the answer, "and the end of the world?"</p>

<p>Isabel gathered her strength once more and looked coldly at Tess, capturing
her blue eyes with her own brown.  "You left," she bit out.  "You left and
we all lost ... everything.  That's what happened.  And so Liz had to fix
it.  She gave you what you wanted so that you would do what you were
supposed to ... and stay.  That's what I meant.  You caused the end of the
world, and she prevented it."</p>

<p>Sitting there, looking at the fragile girl laying dsestroyed at her feet,
Tess felt each word stab into her until she couldn't see.  Her knuckles
whitened as each of Liz's sobs hit her with the force of gale winds.  She
was being torn to pieces as she sat there, unable to protect herself or even
flinch.  Slowly, desperately, her eyes focused back on Liz and she felt
something inside her crumbling.  She had done this.</p>

<p>Looking at them, praying desperately that they would find their way to each
other, Isabel resolutely left the room and climbed the stairs.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>In the bathroom upstairs, Isabel collapsed into the already sobbing, waiting
Maria, incapable of anything but the tears, their bodies giving way to the
horror of the last few minutes.  Both prayed desperately that this would
come out alright.</p>
