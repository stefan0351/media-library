<p>Tess couldn't move.  She was sprayed onto the seat, sinking into the
cushions of the couch and melting into the arms.  She wasn't sure where she
ended and the couch began.  She couldn't think of anything but the couch and
the echoing thought that she had done this.  Somehow, the this had faded
from her mind as the couch absorbed her.  And Tess willingly began to let go
of everything but the loveseat.  She didn't even register that the wetness
on her cheeks was her own tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were torn away from the couch once more and back to her pain
with Liz's tortured sob.  They had become fewer, but they were more
terrifying when they came, one after the other.  She couldn't take her eyes
off of where Liz lay on the floor, wailing in a way Tess had never seen
before, as if she wished to cry herself out of existence.</p>

<p>Tess felt the ache in her arms as she was seperated from the couch and knew
that they wanted to reach out to Liz, to comfort her in some way.  But Tess
was still too much of the couch, and too terrified of Liz.  She knew that
she had no right.</p>

<p>"You caused the end of the world."</p>

<p>Tess finally let go of the couch with a shudder as the words repeated
themselves in her brain.  She had done this.  She had planned on leaving so
many times.  Had been on the verge of packing when she had seen Max in the
park that night.  If she hadn't seen him there and been allowed to make
contact with him, she would have gone to the Valenti's, packed a bag and
left, ignoring every instinct that told her she had to stay.  She had been
on the verge of abandoning destiny, everything and everyone for which she
had fought, because she was lonely.  She had done this.</p>

<p>The crash of waves in Liz's mind was slowing.  She could still feel the rise
and fall of them - the tearing of her inside ear as they pounded against
each other.  She had done this.  Liz hadn't been who Max thought she was.
She failed him and the others the one time she was needed.  She sobbed with
the rise of a new set of slashing thoughts, her mind raw and overpowered.
She had quieted, as the waves took longer to build, and she sucked in the
wails, allowing them to tear apart her chest.  She would be strong.  This
was her punishment.  She had done this.</p>

<p>As they both stayed there, unmoving.  Liz slowly lifted her head and focused
on Tess's face.  Tess was staring at Liz as one would an alien.  Liz choked
back the hysterical sob.  She had done this.  She hadn't been strong enough
to stay.  She hadn't been strong enough to leave.  She hadn't been strong
enough to accept.  She hadn't been strong enough to fight.  She had given up
on love.  She had fought too hard for love.  Liz was no longer sure who this
she was anymore.  She had lied - so many lies - and they had all unraveled.
Destiny and the End of the World and Death and Destruction.  All her fault.
She had done this.  Liz, Tess, Maria, Isabel, the alien mother in the
hologram all coalesced into the single she.</p>

<p>And crouching there, eyes raw and blind with tears, throat gone to screams,
she knew that she hated her more than anything in the world.  She was right
there in that room.  She had done this.  She was furious.  For the first
time in her life, Liz felt rage.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Liz was on her feet and diving at Tess.  "How could you?
How could you do this to everyone?  You destroyed everything!  You lied!"
Ripping at Tess's curls, "You took!" Liz jabbed her knee into Tess stomache,
"You were weak!" and forced Tess back on the couch, "Selfish!".  She
continued the pull hair as she yanked Tess around, shouting out her hate.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Liz had pulled Tess off the couch, "Damn you!" and onto the
floor, "Pathetic!" and was about to throw a punch into Tess's face,
"Heartless!" that Liz realized, "I hate you!" who she was hurting.</p>

<p>Tess was doing nothing to defend herself; she wasn't even holding her hands
up to protect her face.  She lay there, crying and waiting with eyes open
and focused on Liz, for the punch she had decided she deserved.</p>

<p>Liz's eyes cleared as the she became herself, Tess, the alien Mother,
Isabel, and Maria.  Horrified, she slowly dropped her fist, crying, "Oh,
God, what have I done.  Oh lord ... I didn't ... I don't ... I don't know
..." and even slower she sank down beside Tess.  "I'm sorry, oh ... I'm
sorry ..."  She reached out to Tess's cheek, gently touching the bruise
forming there, knowing there were more, unable to comprehend just what she
had done to the girl laying beside her.  Wishing that she could heal her.</p>

<p>Tess was shocked at the sudden end to the violence.  Somehow she felt that
she had been cheated.  She deserved to be punished, she had earned the
bruises and blood.  And here was Liz begging her forgiveness for each
spreading purple mark and drop of red.  She grabbed Liz's hand to stop the
remorseful caress and turned her head to Liz, wet eyes meeting wet eyes.
With a cough, Tess stretched her neck and reached out to Liz with her body,
"I didn't mean for ... I'm sorry ..."  She sobbed in turn, "I'm so ..."</p>

<p>Liz wrapped her fingers slowly with Tess's.  Tess's blue eyes echoed her
pain, and for the first time in months Liz breathed.  Slowly their breaths
slowed to match each other's, and they lay there, eyes locked, trying to
comprehend what had happened.  As their breaths matched, they connected.</p>

<p>The pain of the last year, from the day Tess arrived, poured through their
fingers.  Unlike with Max, Liz saw nothing, only felt the pool of pain
seeping both ways through their link.  And the love.  Liz's love for Max,
Michael and Isabel, for Maria, Alex and Kyle.  Tess's love for Nasedo and
her dreams of love from the other aliens, and a tentative budding love for
Kyle and the Sherrif.  And newest in it all, a love for one another, pooled
like a wellspring.  And slowly, they evened out, the love overwhelming the
pain, numbing it, until they were at peace.  The strangest peace Liz had
ever felt.</p>

<p>Blinking against the everswelling tears, Liz drew in another breath, ragged
from her sore throat.  "We're going to be okay.  Just tell me we are all
going to be okay ..."</p>

<p>Tess shakily nodded as the tears continued to stream down her face.  "We're
going to be okay.  I won't let anything happen.  It will all be okay, I
promise."  And she pulled Liz toward her, cupping Liz's head against her
breast, molding their bodies together perfectly.</p>

<p>Liz curled into Tess's body.  "You promise?"</p>

<p>Hugging Liz tighter to her aching chest, Tess sighed, "I promise.  I'm not
going anywhere."</p>

<p>Liz sighed quietly and held Tess close to her in turn, "Maybe I can sleep
tonight.  Can I sleep tonight?"</p>

<p>Tess couldn't think of any way to answer that.  She simply stroked Liz's
hair comfortingly.  As she felt Liz fall asleep, she whispered, "I'm so
sorry ... I love you,"  and closed her eyes.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Maria had heard Liz's unintelligible screams.  In a panic she pulled herself
out from under Isabel and pushed herself off the floor.  She stood for a
second before she collapsed, finding that her legs had gone numb from
sitting on the bathroom tiles for so long with Isabel's dead weight pushing
her back against the cabinet at an awkward angle.  Maria shook Isabel who
groggily lifted her head and scrubbed at her swollen eyes.</p>

<p>"I can't believe I just did that ..."  Isabel's aching head made her slow to
move.  She groaned as the light reflecting off the mirror hit her pupils and
she quickly covered her eyes with her hand.  Sighing, she used her powers to
slowly repair the splotches left behind by her crying and turned to Maria.</p>

<p>Close to hysterics as she continued to hear noise coming from the living
room, Maria cried out as she tried once again to stand.  "Can't you hear
them?" she asked Isabel.</p>

<p>Isabel, already helping to ease the constricted blood flow in Maria's legs,
froze momentarily and then, hearing another shriek from Liz, dashed to the
door.  Maria, finally able to stand, with her panic increasing by the
moment, chased after.</p>

<p>Isabel stopped abruptly at the sight that greeted her downstairs and Maria
nearly ran her over in the process.  Peering over Iz's shoulder, Maria saw
the two girls, fingers gripped, tears streaming down their cheeks and their
eyes artificially bright with the moisture, frozen as their eyes locked.
Slowly Tess and Liz's muscles began to relax, and, oblivious to their
audience, they quietly pulled toward each other.  The sudden peace between
the two lay heavily over the house.  Neither Maria nor Isabel could hear
what was said between the two, but they remained there, Maria's chin on Iz's
shoulder, unmoving, until both girls were asleep.  Then Isabel pushed Maria
silently toward the stairs.  They mounted them, leaning wearily against each
other.</p>

<p>Once in Isabel's bedroom, Maria pulled the blinds closed to ease the
sunlight on their tearweakened eyes, and Isabel, laying on the bed
whispered, "I didn't realize how terrified I was until I finally saw that
they were okay.  I didn't know how much I love Liz and Tess until just now.
I can't believe ..."</p>

<p>"You did the right thing," Maria reassured tiredly scrubbing at her eyes and
stretching out on the bed beside Isabel.</p>

<p>"Don't do that," Isabel said and leaned over lazily and used her powers to
ease the sandiness in Maria's eyes.</p>

<p>Maria turned her head, "You shouldn't waste your energy that way."  She
looked Isabel in the eyes and tenderly held Iz's hand where it lay beside
Maria's cheek.  "Thank you."</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head at Maria's gratitude.  "Thank you for staying as long
as you did.  I couldn't have ..."</p>

<p>Mria held a finger to Iz's lips, "Shhh ... you did the only thing you could
to help them, and that meant hurting them.  A lot."  She slid her finger
from Isabel's lips to her cheek and into her hair,</p>

<p>Iz nodded resignedly, "I know," and leaned into Maria's hand, enjoy the
soft, comforting touch on her hair.</p>

<p>And they both closed their eyes, giving into the bone deep weariness of the
forlorn and the relieved.</p>
