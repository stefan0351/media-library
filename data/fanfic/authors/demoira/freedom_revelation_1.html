sadness finds its way onto me<br>
yeah on any given day<br>
and I just end up feeling guilty<br>
and I don't know how many times i've told you<br>
I do not know how I ended up this way<br>
it's as if sometimes I have just halted<br>
yeah I stop dead in my tracks<br>
life it just seems to cover me<br>
and it's in these moments that I feel trapped

<p>"That's it!"</p>

<p>Maria turned in surprise at Isabel's sudden outburst.  Lunch was over, the
others had left the table, leaving Maria slowly packing her bag.  She had
thought Isabel had been doing the same, but Isabel hadn't moved from her
seat.  She was staring at Max's retreating back.</p>

<p>After waiting for Iz to explain, Maria finally asked, "What?"</p>

<p>"There killing themselves over something.  I don't know what it is between
them, but they are utterly miserable and it's painful to see."</p>

<p>"I take it by 'them' you are refering to Max and Liz?  Two of the six
utterly miserable people I know?  I mean, there are levels of misery and
ways of wearing it - and they do beat out the rest with their brave fronts
and painfilled eyes, but they aren't the only ones by far.  Anyway, I take
it from the cold stare you are giving me that you had some point you were
going to get to about Max and Liz?"</p>

<p>Iz ignored Maria's snide comments.  "We have to do something.  As long as
they are apart they are going to continue to do stupid things.  Max would
never have gone to New York the way he had if there hadn't been something.
And when Liz connected with me to reach him, I could feel how much she loved
him and how sad she was.  It was deep.  Not that I would expect anything
less from either of them, but this is ... is ..."  Isabel couldn't think of
any way to describe the pain she had felt from Liz, or how she could sense
the sadness emanating off of Max .</p>

<p>"Soul searing?" Maria offered, knowing just what Isabel meant.  Both Max and
Liz could break her heart simply by looking away from each other.  Hell, if
she was honest, they could break her heart simply by being in the same room
together - looks or no.</p>

<p>Isabel shied away from the words.  She was close to accepting how much a
part of Max Liz was, but she wasn't sure she could acknowledge how their
relationship affected her.  Sighing she admitted defeat.  There were no
other words.  "Soul searing."</p>

<p>They sat quietly thinking about what those two words implied.</p>

<p>Isabel evaluated her decision to push Max and Liz together.  She still
wasn't positive that it was a wise decision, but she couldn't let things
continue as they had been.  She had woken up that morning knowing that
sometimes the wisest course wasn't always the right course; some things had
to be, right or wrong.</p>

<p>As Isabel reaffirmed her decision, she continued, "Not only that, but Liz
looks terrible.  She is slowly fading away in front of us.  Did you see what
she ate at Lunch?"</p>

<p>Maria sighed, knowing that Isabel was right. "Nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Nothing.  She doesn't eat, and if the bags under her eyes are any
indication, she doesn't sleep.  We all know she has been working nonstop at
the Crashdown.  Liz always studies hard, but in European Politics, she
didn't speak unless Ms. Carlisle called on her, and then she got more
questions wrong than right.  That's not like her at all.  Liz looks like she
would fall over if you walked past her.  And sometimes I get the feeling
she's going to spontaneously begin to bleed - her skin is that thin.  It's
not natural.  She has been avoiding Max like the plague since we got back
from Vegas, and that is destroying him.  He was so sure that he was reaching
her.  I thought he was going to fly off the planet, but all he's done is
fall right off the cloud he was on.  And the worse Liz gets - the less she
eats, the more she works, the more she ... fades, the less Max cares about
anything."</p>

<p>As Isabel continued, Maria grappled with her own dilema.  If Isabel was
going to be able to help Max and Liz, Iz had to know what had happened
between the two.  Maria had made a promise to Liz - she wasn't sure if she
dared risk their friendship on this.  But then, Maria remembered back in
middle school a school counselor had talked to each class about depression
and drugs and alcohol.  He had said that sometimes you had to break a
promise to a friend for their own good - to save them from themselves.
Maybe losing your soulmate to prevent the end of the world and slowly
willing yourself out of existense as a result wasn't quite the same as a
drinking problem, but Maria felt the concept still applied.</p>

<p>Interupting Iz, Maria cleared her throat, "There's something you need to
know first before you try anything.  I don't think I could have kept this to
myself for much longer anyway.  Somebody else needs the full picture.  Can
you skip next period?  We should have this discussion somewhere private."</p>

<p>Isabel was taken aback by Maria's tone.  Looking at Maria, Iz knew this was
important.  "I don't have a test anytime soon, so, okay."  Standing up,
Isabel realized that the quad was empty.  "We're already late for class
anyway.  Let's go."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Isabel was speechless.  What Maria had told her was mindblowing and
unbelievable.  "How ...how ...I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>"I know.  I babbled stupidly after I found out.  I was so stunned that the
only thing I registered was the fact that Liz hadn't slept with Kyle.  I
mean, that was all that my brain could get a grip on.  The rest of it didn't
hit me until I tried to go back to sleep that night.  Then I cried my eyes
out for Liz.  It's just as well, Liz didn't need me crying all over her
after telling me all that."</p>

<p>Isabel wanted to cry like a baby.  Her brother had suffered so much in the
last year.  "Poor Max.  God, poor Liz!  No wonder they both seem so
shattered.  And no wonder they aren't together now.  Liz won't let it
happen, no matter what.  She will hold onto her lie forever to protect
everyone.  There has to be something ..."</p>

<p>"I don't know if we can convince Liz of anything.  She's terrified of
risking the end of the world, and who wouldn't be?  She told me that she
thought Max was becoming less conscious of her betrayal.  Something about a
vision in Vegas - that's where they were married - and him not seeming to
care anymore.  She's been getting worse since then.  I think that she is
worried that Max has decided to pursue her anyway.  So now she is doing
everything she can to avoid him, and the guilt and stress is wearing her
down."</p>

<p>Isabel sighed, "And that's why suddenly Liz is a ghost of the girl I used to
know."</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem capable of focusing on anything outside of how terrible
she is.  I tried to talk to her about it all, but somehow in her head, Liz
has made the entire situation her fault for not being strong enough to stay
in Florida."</p>

<p>Isabel was shocked.  "Was that ever even an option?"</p>

<p>Maria nodded, "Liz's aunt offered, and with how upset Liz had been at the
beginning of the summer, the Parkers were willing.  But Liz decided that
that was the coward's way out, so she came back."</p>

<p>"And now she thinks that she is weak.  God.  And now that Max is pressing
her for a relationship again ..."</p>

<p>Maria shook her head somberly, "Until we can guarantee that Tess will stay
and none of what he told her is true, we can't try to change anything.  Liz
won't let us."</p>

<p>That strengthened Iz's resolve.  All that Liz was willing to give up was for
the sake of Michael, Max, and herself.  How could Isabel ignore that?  "For
us ... Liz was willing to give up everything for us.  I never thought
anybody here would care for us that way, except my mother.  And here she
is."  Isabel mumbled to herself.</p>

<p>Maria heard Isabel's thoughts and was once again amazed by the way the
aliens were forced to live.  They were so unsure of everything.  Maria
wanted to hug Isabel right then, comfort her, she just wasn't sure how
Isabel would receive her attempt.  Slowly she reached out to touch Iz's arm.
  "We do care about all of you.  You're not impressing me by how long it
took you to figure it out, you know."  She smiled at Iz and gave in to the
urge.</p>

<p>Isabel was surprised by the hug.  She had always felt as if Maria was still
completely unsure of her and their relationship, and here Maria was, draped
all over her.  After a slight hesitation, Isabel leaned in to return the
embrace.  "Thank you."</p>

<p>Slowly, Iz pulled back and looked out at the water.  "The key to all of this
is Tess.  There has to be something we can say to Tess, some way to
guarantee that none of that happens.  Max and Liz shouldn't be caught up in
this lie.  They deserve better.  Now how are we going to manage it all?"</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Isabel took a deep breath.  "So I was thinking that it was time for a girl's
night.  All in all, we haven't had the chance to be teenagers in quite some
time.  Vegas was a flop.  I'm thinking my place, ice cream, popcorn, and
chick flicks."</p>

<p>"Definitely.  And makeup and hair and raiding Isabel's closet.  I like the
idea," Maria added.</p>

<p>Isabel had joined Maria and Liz on their way to the Crashdown, claiming to
have a desperate need for an Alien Blast and Sigourney Weaver.</p>

<p>Liz shifted uncomfortably in her seat.  The thought of a night in the same
house with Max combined with Isabel's previous mention of food made Liz feel
decidely nauseous.  She knew that she wouldn't be able to sleep at all with
only a wall between herself and Max.  "I don't know, Iz.  I've got a lot of
work this semester, and since we spend so much of our time on Czech issues,
I really have to spend every spare moment I have on my books."</p>

<p>"Come on Lizzie, please?" Maria batted her eyes at Liz and pouted, "It
wouldn't be a girl's night without you.  You need to do something.  Please?"</p>

<p>Isabel jumped in, "We don't get chances like this very often.  My parents
are out of town; they're staying over in Albuqurque for a case.  And Max
won't be there either.  He and Michael have decided that they need to go
camping."  Isabel shuddered artfully.  "I don't know why, but they have.  So
the house is going to be all mine anyway.  It would be a shame to waste the
opportunity."</p>

<p>They had arrived at the Crashdown.  As she unbuckled her seatbelt, Liz
sighed, looking at Iz and Maria, "I'll think about it.  If I can get off
working Thursday, I'm game."</p>

<p>Isabel and Maria shared a look of triumph.  Step one accomplished.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Tess was slightly surprised by the invitation, "I would love to come over
Friday night, Iz.  I'll check with Jim, I'm sure that two weeks is a fair
amount of time to be house bound."  Tess still had not managed to say out
loud that Jim Valenti had grounded her after the whole Vegas fiasco, "It
should be no problem. When do you want me?  And should I bring anything?"</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head, "Oh, how does seven-thirty sound?  And don't worry
about a thing.  I'll get the ice cream.  How about you pick up a couple
movies on your way over."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a plan," Tess agreed happily.</p>

<p>"Now how about getting an Alien Blast with me?  I've been craving one all
day."</p>

<p>And as Tess tossed her bag off her shoulder and picked up a menu, Iz
signaled her success to Maria.</p>
