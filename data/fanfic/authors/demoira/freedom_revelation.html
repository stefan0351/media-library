sadness finds its way onto me<br>
yeah on any given day<br>
and I just end up feeling guilty<br>
and I don't know how many times i've told you<br>
I do not know how I ended up this way<br>
it's as if sometimes I have just halted<br>
yeah I stop dead in my tracks<br>
life it just seems to cover me<br>
and it's in these moments that I feel trapped

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"That's it!"</p>

<p>Maria turned in surprise at Isabel's sudden outburst.  Lunch was over, the
others had left the table, leaving Maria slowly packing her bag.  She had
thought Isabel had been doing the same, but Isabel hadn't moved from her
seat.  She was staring at Max's retreating back.</p>

<p>After waiting for Iz to explain, Maria finally asked, "What?"</p>

<p>"There killing themselves over something.  I don't know what it is between
them, but they are utterly miserable and it's painful to see."</p>

<p>"I take it by 'them' you are refering to Max and Liz?  Two of the six
utterly miserable people I know?  I mean, there are levels of misery and
ways of wearing it - and they do beat out the rest with their brave fronts
and painfilled eyes, but they aren't the only ones by far.  Anyway, I take
it from the cold stare you are giving me that you had some point you were
going to get to about Max and Liz?"</p>

<p>Iz ignored Maria's snide comments.  "We have to do something.  As long as
they are apart they are going to continue to do stupid things.  Max would
never have gone to New York the way he had if there hadn't been something.
And when Liz connected with me to reach him, I could feel how much she loved
him and how sad she was.  It was deep.  Not that I would expect anything
less from either of them, but this is ... is ..."  Isabel couldn't think of
any way to describe the pain she had felt from Liz, or how she could sense
the sadness emanating off of Max .</p>

<p>"Soul searing?" Maria offered, knowing just what Isabel meant.  Both Max and
Liz could break her heart simply by looking away from each other.  Hell, if
she was honest, they could break her heart simply by being in the same room
together - looks or no.</p>

<p>Isabel shied away from the words.  She was close to accepting how much a
part of Max Liz was, but she wasn't sure she could acknowledge how their
relationship affected her.  Sighing she admitted defeat.  There were no
other words.  "Soul searing."</p>

<p>They sat quietly thinking about what those two words implied.</p>

<p>Isabel evaluated her decision to push Max and Liz together.  She still
wasn't positive that it was a wise decision, but she couldn't let things
continue as they had been.  She had woken up that morning knowing that
sometimes the wisest course wasn't always the right course; some things had
to be, right or wrong.</p>

<p>As Isabel reaffirmed her decision, she continued, "Not only that, but Liz
looks terrible.  She is slowly fading away in front of us.  Did you see what
she ate at Lunch?"</p>

<p>Maria sighed, knowing that Isabel was right. "Nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Nothing.  She doesn't eat, and if the bags under her eyes are any
indication, she doesn't sleep.  We all know she has been working nonstop at
the Crashdown.  Liz always studies hard, but in European Politics, she
didn't speak unless Ms. Carlisle called on her, and then she got more
questions wrong than right.  That's not like her at all.  Liz looks like she
would fall over if you walked past her.  And sometimes I get the feeling
she's going to spontaneously begin to bleed - her skin is that thin.  It's
not natural.  She has been avoiding Max like the plague since we got back
from Vegas, and that is destroying him.  He was so sure that he was reaching
her.  I thought he was going to fly off the planet, but all he's done is
fall right off the cloud he was on.  And the worse Liz gets - the less she
eats, the more she works, the more she ... fades, the less Max cares about
anything."</p>

<p>As Isabel continued, Maria grappled with her own dilema.  If Isabel was
going to be able to help Max and Liz, Iz had to know what had happened
between the two.  Maria had made a promise to Liz - she wasn't sure if she
dared risk their friendship on this.  But then, Maria remembered back in
middle school a school counselor had talked to each class about depression
and drugs and alcohol.  He had said that sometimes you had to break a
promise to a friend for their own good - to save them from themselves.
Maybe losing your soulmate to prevent the end of the world and slowly
willing yourself out of existense as a result wasn't quite the same as a
drinking problem, but Maria felt the concept still applied.</p>

<p>Interupting Iz, Maria cleared her throat, "There's something you need to
know first before you try anything.  I don't think I could have kept this to
myself for much longer anyway.  Somebody else needs the full picture.  Can
you skip next period?  We should have this discussion somewhere private."</p>

<p>Isabel was taken aback by Maria's tone.  Looking at Maria, Iz knew this was
important.  "I don't have a test anytime soon, so, okay."  Standing up,
Isabel realized that the quad was empty.  "We're already late for class
anyway.  Let's go."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Isabel was speechless.  What Maria had told her was mindblowing and
unbelievable.  "How ...how ...I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>"I know.  I babbled stupidly after I found out.  I was so stunned that the
only thing I registered was the fact that Liz hadn't slept with Kyle.  I
mean, that was all that my brain could get a grip on.  The rest of it didn't
hit me until I tried to go back to sleep that night.  Then I cried my eyes
out for Liz.  It's just as well, Liz didn't need me crying all over her
after telling me all that."</p>

<p>Isabel wanted to cry like a baby.  Her brother had suffered so much in the
last year.  "Poor Max.  God, poor Liz!  No wonder they both seem so
shattered.  And no wonder they aren't together now.  Liz won't let it
happen, no matter what.  She will hold onto her lie forever to protect
everyone.  There has to be something ..."</p>

<p>"I don't know if we can convince Liz of anything.  She's terrified of
risking the end of the world, and who wouldn't be?  She told me that she
thought Max was becoming less conscious of her betrayal.  Something about a
vision in Vegas - that's where they were married - and him not seeming to
care anymore.  She's been getting worse since then.  I think that she is
worried that Max has decided to pursue her anyway.  So now she is doing
everything she can to avoid him, and the guilt and stress is wearing her
down."</p>

<p>Isabel sighed, "And that's why suddenly Liz is a ghost of the girl I used to
know."</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem capable of focusing on anything outside of how terrible
she is.  I tried to talk to her about it all, but somehow in her head, Liz
has made the entire situation her fault for not being strong enough to stay
in Florida."</p>

<p>Isabel was shocked.  "Was that ever even an option?"</p>

<p>Maria nodded, "Liz's aunt offered, and with how upset Liz had been at the
beginning of the summer, the Parkers were willing.  But Liz decided that
that was the coward's way out, so she came back."</p>

<p>"And now she thinks that she is weak.  God.  And now that Max is pressing
her for a relationship again ..."</p>

<p>Maria shook her head somberly, "Until we can guarantee that Tess will stay
and none of what he told her is true, we can't try to change anything.  Liz
won't let us."</p>

<p>That strengthened Iz's resolve.  All that Liz was willing to give up was for
the sake of Michael, Max, and herself.  How could Isabel ignore that?  "For
us ... Liz was willing to give up everything for us.  I never thought
anybody here would care for us that way, except my mother.  And here she
is."  Isabel mumbled to herself.</p>

<p>Maria heard Isabel's thoughts and was once again amazed by the way the
aliens were forced to live.  They were so unsure of everything.  Maria
wanted to hug Isabel right then, comfort her, she just wasn't sure how
Isabel would receive her attempt.  Slowly she reached out to touch Iz's arm.
  "We do care about all of you.  You're not impressing me by how long it
took you to figure it out, you know."  She smiled at Iz and gave in to the
urge.</p>

<p>Isabel was surprised by the hug.  She had always felt as if Maria was still
completely unsure of her and their relationship, and here Maria was, draped
all over her.  After a slight hesitation, Isabel leaned in to return the
embrace.  "Thank you."</p>

<p>Slowly, Iz pulled back and looked out at the water.  "The key to all of this
is Tess.  There has to be something we can say to Tess, some way to
guarantee that none of that happens.  Max and Liz shouldn't be caught up in
this lie.  They deserve better.  Now how are we going to manage it all?"</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Isabel took a deep breath.  "So I was thinking that it was time for a girl's
night.  All in all, we haven't had the chance to be teenagers in quite some
time.  Vegas was a flop.  I'm thinking my place, ice cream, popcorn, and
chick flicks."</p>

<p>"Definitely.  And makeup and hair and raiding Isabel's closet.  I like the
idea," Maria added.</p>

<p>Isabel had joined Maria and Liz on their way to the Crashdown, claiming to
have a desperate need for an Alien Blast and Sigourney Weaver.</p>

<p>Liz shifted uncomfortably in her seat.  The thought of a night in the same
house with Max combined with Isabel's previous mention of food made Liz feel
decidely nauseous.  She knew that she wouldn't be able to sleep at all with
only a wall between herself and Max.  "I don't know, Iz.  I've got a lot of
work this semester, and since we spend so much of our time on Czech issues,
I really have to spend every spare moment I have on my books."</p>

<p>"Come on Lizzie, please?" Maria batted her eyes at Liz and pouted, "It
wouldn't be a girl's night without you.  You need to do something.  Please?"</p>

<p>Isabel jumped in, "We don't get chances like this very often.  My parents
are out of town; they're staying over in Albuqurque for a case.  And Max
won't be there either.  He and Michael have decided that they need to go
camping."  Isabel shuddered artfully.  "I don't know why, but they have.  So
the house is going to be all mine anyway.  It would be a shame to waste the
opportunity."</p>

<p>They had arrived at the Crashdown.  As she unbuckled her seatbelt, Liz
sighed, looking at Iz and Maria, "I'll think about it.  If I can get off
working Thursday, I'm game."</p>

<p>Isabel and Maria shared a look of triumph.  Step one accomplished.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Tess was slightly surprised by the invitation, "I would love to come over
Friday night, Iz.  I'll check with Jim, I'm sure that two weeks is a fair
amount of time to be house bound."  Tess still had not managed to say out
loud that Jim Valenti had grounded her after the whole Vegas fiasco, "It
should be no problem. When do you want me?  And should I bring anything?"</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head, "Oh, how does seven-thirty sound?  And don't worry
about a thing.  I'll get the ice cream.  How about you pick up a couple
movies on your way over."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a plan," Tess agreed happily.</p>

<p>"Now how about getting an Alien Blast with me?  I've been craving one all
day."</p>

<p>And as Tess tossed her bag off her shoulder and picked up a menu, Iz
signaled her success to Maria.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"I'm still not completely sure about this."</p>

<p>It was about five o'clock that Friday.  Maria was pacing in Isabel's room,
picking nicknacks up and then placing them exactly in their original place
without looking at them.  She turned to Iz, "Are you positive this is the
only way?  Liz is so fragile right now.  I'm not sure that I can watch you
do this ..."</p>

<p>Isabel looked at Maria for a moment, analyzing how close to breaking down
Maria was.  Not too close.  Good.  "Fine, then go in the kitchen.  I can
send you out to get pizza.  Anything.  You don't have to be there.  In fact,
it might be better if you aren't.  We can't let her turn to you when I do
this to her."</p>

<p>"I know that.  Maybe I should go somewhere else ... No,"  Maria turned back
to Isabel, her shoulders set.  "I'm a part of this.  When she starts getting
angry at you or collapses, I might as well be there to share it with you.  I
just don't know if I can bear to see her in this kind of pain."  Maria
finally sat down next to Iz.</p>

<p>Isabel tossed Maria's hair out of the way and began massaging Maria's neck
and shoulders.  Maria always surprised Iz when she buckled down to something
this difficult.  She might get hysterical first, but she always did what was
needed.  "You can as long as you remember why I'm doing this to her.  Just
remember that you can't stop me, no matter how hard it is.  If it gets to be
too much for you, leave.  I have to be the bad guy, you have to refuse to
help, which will leave Tess.  And I know Tess; she won't be able to stand
seeing Liz in that much pain.  Tess doesn't have it in her, regardless of
what we all might think at times."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you're right.  This has to work, or I'll have lost my best
friend and Liz and Max will still be alone and miserable."</p>

<p>"It will work."  They sat in companionable silence for a few minutes.  Then,
looking at the clock, Isabel sat up. "Aren't you supposed to be picking up
Liz now, as in you should have left ten minutes ago?"</p>

<p>Maria gasped.  "Damn.  I gotta go."  She looked around frantically, "Did you
see where I put my bag?"</p>

<p>Isabel held Maria's light brown suede bag by it's embroidered straps.
"Here."</p>

<p>"Thank you, you are a life saver.  See you."</p>

<p>"Bye, Maria.  It will work out, I promise."</p>

<p>"I know, it has to."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>So far nothing had gone wrong.  Tess had arrived first and had gotten
comfortable, stretching her legs out on the couch.  She was surprised when
there was a knock on the door.</p>

<p>"Iz, did you order pizza?" she shouted back to the kitchen where Isabel was
puttering.</p>

<p>"Could you get that for me, I forgot to tell you they were coming."  Isabel
was happily mixing some punch.  She had already pulled out chips, vegetables
and dip.</p>

<p>As Tess opened the door, she shouted pack, "Who?" and then turned to see
exactly who she was letting in.</p>

<p>Seeing Maria, she opened the door further and stepped back.  Maria tightened
her grip on Liz and pulled her in.  Liz was gazing vaguely at the floor, and
Tess was focused entirely on Maria in her surprise.  They hadn't really
registered each other yet, but Maria wasn't going to give Liz the chance to
get away.</p>

<p>"So, Tess, how are you doing?" Maria asked just a little too loudly.</p>

<p>"I'm doing great.  Iz didn't tell me that she had invited you ..." Tess
finally registered Liz's presence. "Uh ... um, hi, Liz."</p>

<p>Liz's head flew up, "Hi ... Tess.  I didn't ..." her voice cracked, raw
sounding from lack of sleep, "know you would be here."  Striving to be
polite, Liz grasped for something to talk to Tess about.  "Have - have you
done that english assignment yet?"</p>

<p>Tess looked curiously at Liz, wondering if Liz would have come had she known
Tess would be there.  And then realizing that the English assignment that
Liz mentioned didn't exist.  They had one in Spanish.  She narrowed her eyes
on Liz, noting the violet bruises pressed into the soft skin under Liz's
eyes.  "No, not yet.  Um ..."</p>

<p>Liz paused, searching for something more to say but only managing to think
about the need to communicate over and over.  "So ..."</p>

<p>Isabel popped her head out of the kitchen, "Oh, great you guys are here.
I've got some food and drinks, and Tess brought some movies.  Why don't you
guys come in to the kitchen and we can talk while I clean up my punch mess."</p>

<p>And the evening continued much the same way, with Liz and Tess attempting
desperately to hold a normal conversation, and Maria and Iz filling in the
tenser moments.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Isabel had been building herself up to this all evening.  The movie had just
ended and the ice cream Maria had brought along was half empty.  Maria and
Liz had taken over the couch, while she and Tess had settled into the
recliner and the loveseat.  As she turned off the TV, Isabel looked at Maria
who nodded her head.  Taking a deep breath, she began the game.</p>

<p>"So .. I was thinking that we should play truth or dare," Isabel said with a
wicked smile on her face.</p>

<p>Maria jumped in before either Tess or Liz could object to the juvenile game,
"Definitely, I get to go first!  Liz, when was your first kiss?" she raised
her eyebrows suggestively.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I did not say I was playing.  Maria - you can't bring this up again.
  Oooo, the humilitation ..."</p>

<p>"Then is it a dare?"</p>

<p>"No way.  I know you Maria Leah Deluca.  Okay, so it was Billy Johnson,
kindergarten.  It was a Deluca dare, if you must know."</p>

<p>Isabel gagged, "Billy?  And I thought he would die never having been kissed.
  Uggh.  Shame on you Liz - and in kindergarten!"</p>

<p>"Okay, you are next.  Truth or dare?"</p>

<p>"Definitely truth.  I'm not sure I trust you any better than you trust Maria
here."</p>

<p>Liz creased her forehead tiredly, trying desperately to focus, "When are you
going to decide who you want to spend your life with?  Alex?  Michael?  Some
imaginary guy?"</p>

<p>Isabel gasped, she hadn't been expecting anything like this.  She wasn't
prepared for this question.  She groped for something to say.  Looking
desperately to Maria for help,but finding nothing but surprise in Maria's
green eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, umm, I don't really know what to say ... erm ... Maybe, um, when I
know what I feel ..."</p>

<p>Liz shook her head.  She hadn't really wanted to throw Isabel into this
turmoil.  She had simply asked the first question that came to mind.
"Nevermind," Liz dismissed the question, exhaustion evident in her
uncharacteristic tone.  "Let me know when you know.  Your turn."</p>

<p>When Isabel simply sat there distracted, Maria spoke up, "Iz, it's time.
Are you ready?" she asked significantly.</p>

<p>Isabel looked at Maria and noted how heavy with emotion Maria's eyes were.
It was time.  "Okay, Liz.  Truth or Dare?"</p>

<p>Liz rolled her eyes, "We definitely should have set the rules on this one.
No turn arounds.  Fine, truth."</p>

<p>Isabel blinked her eyes to prevent tears.  This was going to be harder than
she had thought.  Looking at Maria, her face cleared.  Somethings just have
to be, right or wrong.</p>

<p>"Liz."  Isabel cleared her throat.  "Liz.  When are you going to tell my
brother the truth?"</p>

<p>Liz looked blankly at Isabel's intent face.</p>

<p>"When are you going to tell my brother that everything he saw that night was
a lie?  When are you going to tell everyone why you lied to him?  When are
you planning on explaining to all of us what you did to save us?"</p>

<p>Liz was shaking her head and moaning in shock, feeling her life crumbling
around her, "No.  No.  Please, no ... don't."  Her eyes were filling with
tears - this couldn't be happening to her, "What are you doing?  Do you know
what you are doing?"  Liz stood, intent on stopping the flood of Isabel's
words.  Isabel was destroying months worth of suffering - rendering it all
pointless.  "No.  No ... no."</p>

<p>Pulling her determination around her as armor against Liz's pain, Isabel was
relentless, her voice getting louder and louder.  She asked, "When are you
going to tell Kyle why he pretended to sleep with you?  When are you going
to tell Michael and I about our deaths?"  Isabel was shouting now, "When are
you planning on telling Tess that she was part of the end of the world?"</p>

<p>Liz froze, paralyzed by the magnitude of what Isabel had just done.  Death.
Destruction.  All because Elizabeth Parker wasn't strong enough to stay away
from Max Evans.  All because she wasn't strong enough to keep her secret to
herself.  All because she valued her friendship with Maria above the lives
of Isabel and Michael.  All because she was weak.  All because Max had saved
her that day in September.</p>

<p>Maria watched, pain streaking through her, as Liz's face crumpled, her skin
pale and streaked with sweat.  Liz had grabbed the hair by her ears, as if
to anchor her clenched fists there more firmly all the while thrashing her
head searchingly around the room as if to prove to herself somehow that this
wasn't real.  Finally Maria gave out to a sob, turned and fled the room,
crashing into the end table on her way, uncaring for the lamp she knocked
over.</p>

<p>The thoughts crashed in Liz's mind as Isabel continued her litany.  The pain
became too immense.  Liz covered her ears, but it just made her thoughts
louder without Isabel's words there to drown them out.  Something broke and
Liz screamed, "No!  Shut up!  You don't know what you are doing," she
sobbed, "You don't know what you are doing.  Too much lost for me.  Be
quiet!  Just stop ... please ... please ..." she fell into a heap at the
foot of the sofa.</p>

<p>Tess sat shocked, staring at the sobbing girl at their feet.  She hadn't
even had the chance to register Isabel's accusations, only the terrifying
affect they had on Liz.  Tess had always thought Liz was so strong ...  "My
God, Isabel.  What did you do?  How could you do that ... to anyone?"  As
she stared at Liz, broken and sobbing on the floor there, her fingers
digging maniacally into the carpet, what Isabel said began to sink in.  Tess
tore her eyes away from Liz.  "What did you mean?  What did you mean, about
me and ..." she gulped terrified of the answer, "and the end of the world?"</p>

<p>Isabel gathered her strength once more and looked coldly at Tess, capturing
her blue eyes with her own brown.  "You left," she bit out.  "You left and
we all lost ... everything.  That's what happened.  And so Liz had to fix
it.  She gave you what you wanted so that you would do what you were
supposed to ... and stay.  That's what I meant.  You caused the end of the
world, and she prevented it."</p>

<p>Sitting there, looking at the fragile girl laying dsestroyed at her feet,
Tess felt each word stab into her until she couldn't see.  Her knuckles
whitened as each of Liz's sobs hit her with the force of gale winds.  She
was being torn to pieces as she sat there, unable to protect herself or even
flinch.  Slowly, desperately, her eyes focused back on Liz and she felt
something inside her crumbling.  She had done this.</p>

<p>Looking at them, praying desperately that they would find their way to each
other, Isabel resolutely left the room and climbed the stairs.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>In the bathroom upstairs, Isabel collapsed into the already sobbing, waiting
Maria, incapable of anything but the tears, their bodies giving way to the
horror of the last few minutes.  Both prayed desperately that this would
come out alright.</p>

<p>Tess couldn't move.  She was sprayed onto the seat, sinking into the
cushions of the couch and melting into the arms.  She wasn't sure where she
ended and the couch began.  She couldn't think of anything but the couch and
the echoing thought that she had done this.  Somehow, the this had faded
from her mind as the couch absorbed her.  And Tess willingly began to let go
of everything but the loveseat.  She didn't even register that the wetness
on her cheeks was her own tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were torn away from the couch once more and back to her pain
with Liz's tortured sob.  They had become fewer, but they were more
terrifying when they came, one after the other.  She couldn't take her eyes
off of where Liz lay on the floor, wailing in a way Tess had never seen
before, as if she wished to cry herself out of existence.</p>

<p>Tess felt the ache in her arms as she was seperated from the couch and knew
that they wanted to reach out to Liz, to comfort her in some way.  But Tess
was still too much of the couch, and too terrified of Liz.  She knew that
she had no right.</p>

<p>"You caused the end of the world."</p>

<p>Tess finally let go of the couch with a shudder as the words repeated
themselves in her brain.  She had done this.  She had planned on leaving so
many times.  Had been on the verge of packing when she had seen Max in the
park that night.  If she hadn't seen him there and been allowed to make
contact with him, she would have gone to the Valenti's, packed a bag and
left, ignoring every instinct that told her she had to stay.  She had been
on the verge of abandoning destiny, everything and everyone for which she
had fought, because she was lonely.  She had done this.</p>

<p>The crash of waves in Liz's mind was slowing.  She could still feel the rise
and fall of them - the tearing of her inside ear as they pounded against
each other.  She had done this.  Liz hadn't been who Max thought she was.
She failed him and the others the one time she was needed.  She sobbed with
the rise of a new set of slashing thoughts, her mind raw and overpowered.
She had quieted, as the waves took longer to build, and she sucked in the
wails, allowing them to tear apart her chest.  She would be strong.  This
was her punishment.  She had done this.</p>

<p>As they both stayed there, unmoving.  Liz slowly lifted her head and focused
on Tess's face.  Tess was staring at Liz as one would an alien.  Liz choked
back the hysterical sob.  She had done this.  She hadn't been strong enough
to stay.  She hadn't been strong enough to leave.  She hadn't been strong
enough to accept.  She hadn't been strong enough to fight.  She had given up
on love.  She had fought too hard for love.  Liz was no longer sure who this
she was anymore.  She had lied - so many lies - and they had all unraveled.
Destiny and the End of the World and Death and Destruction.  All her fault.
She had done this.  Liz, Tess, Maria, Isabel, the alien mother in the
hologram all coalesced into the single she.</p>

<p>And crouching there, eyes raw and blind with tears, throat gone to screams,
she knew that she hated her more than anything in the world.  She was right
there in that room.  She had done this.  She was furious.  For the first
time in her life, Liz felt rage.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Liz was on her feet and diving at Tess.  "How could you?
How could you do this to everyone?  You destroyed everything!  You lied!"
Ripping at Tess's curls, "You took!" Liz jabbed her knee into Tess stomache,
"You were weak!" and forced Tess back on the couch, "Selfish!".  She
continued the pull hair as she yanked Tess around, shouting out her hate.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Liz had pulled Tess off the couch, "Damn you!" and onto the
floor, "Pathetic!" and was about to throw a punch into Tess's face,
"Heartless!" that Liz realized, "I hate you!" who she was hurting.</p>

<p>Tess was doing nothing to defend herself; she wasn't even holding her hands
up to protect her face.  She lay there, crying and waiting with eyes open
and focused on Liz, for the punch she had decided she deserved.</p>

<p>Liz's eyes cleared as the she became herself, Tess, the alien Mother,
Isabel, and Maria.  Horrified, she slowly dropped her fist, crying, "Oh,
God, what have I done.  Oh lord ... I didn't ... I don't ... I don't know
..." and even slower she sank down beside Tess.  "I'm sorry, oh ... I'm
sorry ..."  She reached out to Tess's cheek, gently touching the bruise
forming there, knowing there were more, unable to comprehend just what she
had done to the girl laying beside her.  Wishing that she could heal her.</p>

<p>Tess was shocked at the sudden end to the violence.  Somehow she felt that
she had been cheated.  She deserved to be punished, she had earned the
bruises and blood.  And here was Liz begging her forgiveness for each
spreading purple mark and drop of red.  She grabbed Liz's hand to stop the
remorseful caress and turned her head to Liz, wet eyes meeting wet eyes.
With a cough, Tess stretched her neck and reached out to Liz with her body,
"I didn't mean for ... I'm sorry ..."  She sobbed in turn, "I'm so ..."</p>

<p>Liz wrapped her fingers slowly with Tess's.  Tess's blue eyes echoed her
pain, and for the first time in months Liz breathed.  Slowly their breaths
slowed to match each other's, and they lay there, eyes locked, trying to
comprehend what had happened.  As their breaths matched, they connected.</p>

<p>The pain of the last year, from the day Tess arrived, poured through their
fingers.  Unlike with Max, Liz saw nothing, only felt the pool of pain
seeping both ways through their link.  And the love.  Liz's love for Max,
Michael and Isabel, for Maria, Alex and Kyle.  Tess's love for Nasedo and
her dreams of love from the other aliens, and a tentative budding love for
Kyle and the Sherrif.  And newest in it all, a love for one another, pooled
like a wellspring.  And slowly, they evened out, the love overwhelming the
pain, numbing it, until they were at peace.  The strangest peace Liz had
ever felt.</p>

<p>Blinking against the everswelling tears, Liz drew in another breath, ragged
from her sore throat.  "We're going to be okay.  Just tell me we are all
going to be okay ..."</p>

<p>Tess shakily nodded as the tears continued to stream down her face.  "We're
going to be okay.  I won't let anything happen.  It will all be okay, I
promise."  And she pulled Liz toward her, cupping Liz's head against her
breast, molding their bodies together perfectly.</p>

<p>Liz curled into Tess's body.  "You promise?"</p>

<p>Hugging Liz tighter to her aching chest, Tess sighed, "I promise.  I'm not
going anywhere."</p>

<p>Liz sighed quietly and held Tess close to her in turn, "Maybe I can sleep
tonight.  Can I sleep tonight?"</p>

<p>Tess couldn't think of any way to answer that.  She simply stroked Liz's
hair comfortingly.  As she felt Liz fall asleep, she whispered, "I'm so
sorry ... I love you,"  and closed her eyes.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Maria had heard Liz's unintelligible screams.  In a panic she pulled herself
out from under Isabel and pushed herself off the floor.  She stood for a
second before she collapsed, finding that her legs had gone numb from
sitting on the bathroom tiles for so long with Isabel's dead weight pushing
her back against the cabinet at an awkward angle.  Maria shook Isabel who
groggily lifted her head and scrubbed at her swollen eyes.</p>

<p>"I can't believe I just did that ..."  Isabel's aching head made her slow to
move.  She groaned as the light reflecting off the mirror hit her pupils and
she quickly covered her eyes with her hand.  Sighing, she used her powers to
slowly repair the splotches left behind by her crying and turned to Maria.</p>

<p>Close to hysterics as she continued to hear noise coming from the living
room, Maria cried out as she tried once again to stand.  "Can't you hear
them?" she asked Isabel.</p>

<p>Isabel, already helping to ease the constricted blood flow in Maria's legs,
froze momentarily and then, hearing another shriek from Liz, dashed to the
door.  Maria, finally able to stand, with her panic increasing by the
moment, chased after.</p>

<p>Isabel stopped abruptly at the sight that greeted her downstairs and Maria
nearly ran her over in the process.  Peering over Iz's shoulder, Maria saw
the two girls, fingers gripped, tears streaming down their cheeks and their
eyes artificially bright with the moisture, frozen as their eyes locked.
Slowly Tess and Liz's muscles began to relax, and, oblivious to their
audience, they quietly pulled toward each other.  The sudden peace between
the two lay heavily over the house.  Neither Maria nor Isabel could hear
what was said between the two, but they remained there, Maria's chin on Iz's
shoulder, unmoving, until both girls were asleep.  Then Isabel pushed Maria
silently toward the stairs.  They mounted them, leaning wearily against each
other.</p>

<p>Once in Isabel's bedroom, Maria pulled the blinds closed to ease the
sunlight on their tearweakened eyes, and Isabel, laying on the bed
whispered, "I didn't realize how terrified I was until I finally saw that
they were okay.  I didn't know how much I love Liz and Tess until just now.
I can't believe ..."</p>

<p>"You did the right thing," Maria reassured tiredly scrubbing at her eyes and
stretching out on the bed beside Isabel.</p>

<p>"Don't do that," Isabel said and leaned over lazily and used her powers to
ease the sandiness in Maria's eyes.</p>

<p>Maria turned her head, "You shouldn't waste your energy that way."  She
looked Isabel in the eyes and tenderly held Iz's hand where it lay beside
Maria's cheek.  "Thank you."</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head at Maria's gratitude.  "Thank you for staying as long
as you did.  I couldn't have ..."</p>

<p>Mria held a finger to Iz's lips, "Shhh ... you did the only thing you could
to help them, and that meant hurting them.  A lot."  She slid her finger
from Isabel's lips to her cheek and into her hair,</p>

<p>Iz nodded resignedly, "I know," and leaned into Maria's hand, enjoy the
soft, comforting touch on her hair.</p>

<p>And they both closed their eyes, giving into the bone deep weariness of the
forlorn and the relieved.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>It was an odd sensation, waking up wrapped around somebody.  The urge to
stretch was almost overwhelming and Tess moved to pull her arms above her
head and straighten her legs when she found that one hand was tangled in
glossy brown hair, and the other gripped desperately by a delicate shaped
hand.  Curiously, Tess blinked as the morning light fell on her face noting
that the curtains had been left open last night, and, though Tess had never
thought about it, she now vaguely realized that the Evans' house faced east.
  The Evans' house.  Tess finally realized where she was. And who she was
holding.  But Tess was surprised to find that there was no awkwardness or
discomfort in knowing that she was holding a peaceful Liz Parker in her
arms.  Tess felt at ease there on the floor of the Evans' living room.  She
felt content.  Happy.  Luxuriating in the beauty of the sun glowing
blindingly on her face, Tess decided to simply wait for Liz to wake up
before moving.  And while waiting, she could watch Liz sleep.  Tess smiled.</p>

<p>Liz could still feel Tess.  Liz slid her eyes apart slowly, rather glad that
she could still feel the leveling of pain and joy between herself and the
other girl.  They never let go last night, Liz realized, smiling as she
noted that Tess had an incredible expression of peace on her face.</p>

<p>"Good Morning," Liz whispered, the smile in her voice, reaching her free
hand out to carress Tess's sunbrightened chin and cheek.</p>

<p>Tess was glad to hear Liz's voice.  She had been thinking about last night
and everything that had changed, noting within herself the restfulness that
had remained from the night before.  "Morning," she said, but noting that
her voice sounded too loud for this early in the morning, she lowered it.
"I hope I didn't wake you," she added, sitting up as Liz did the same.</p>

<p>Tess unwillingly moved to pull her hand out of Liz's and Liz resisted.  In
explanation, Liz grinned, "It feels good.  I'm afraid we'll lose ...
whatever this connection is if we let go."</p>

<p>Tess nodded in understanding.  She had the same fear.  "I know what you
mean. But I don't think we'll lose it.  A connection like this - it doesn't
just disappear.  I think we would be able to make it happen again."</p>

<p>Liz, ever the scientist thought for a moment.  "You're right, it doesn't
feel impermanent.  Maybe we should test it: you know, let go and then try to
connect again."</p>

<p>Tess thought about it.  And smiled sweetly, "Makes sense.  Lets give it a
try."</p>

<p>They both waited, staring at their hands and willing the other to let go.
Finally, blushing, they looked up at each other.  "We're going to have to
let go.  Count of three.  One - two - three."  And they released hands.</p>

<p>It was strange not having Liz there anymore.  Tess had gotten so used to the
presence in their sleep, that she had hardly recognized the connection upon
waking.  But it's absence was keen, suddenly her own emotions seemed so much
louder in her head.  She felt orphaned in her own mind.  In Liz's eyes, she
saw the same loss.  With remorse, Liz felt the absence of Tess in her mind.
The emotions in Tess had felt so similar to her own, that she had felt a
closeness with the girl that she couldn't begin to explain.  Pausing to
think about the feelings flowing through her, Liz realized how strong her
love for this small girl sitting beside her was.  It was amazing.  Quickly
she reached back out to Tess, and, their fingers once again twining, felt
the connection reform and spread, like warmth, through her body.  It was
full of love.  Liz smiled at the warmth - the love and felt herself warming
with matching emotions.  Tess was amazed by the depths of the emotion she
fell falling off of Liz for her.  For her, Tess marveled.  Liz loved her.</p>

<p>They both smiled and reluctantly let go again.  It was there.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good to know," Tess said, resisting the urge to crow with
relief.</p>

<p>Liz grinned back at Tess's bright face.  "What do you say we see what they
have in the kitchen here?  I am starving."</p>

<p>Laughing, Tess agreed.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Isabel and Maria paused at the entry to the kitchen, surprised by the sight
that greeted them.  The floor between the sink and the island was covered in
flour.  Every inch of the counter space overflowed with clean and dirty
dishes, while the flour canister sat open beside what looked like a hundred
eggs shells and the box of baking soda and the bottle of sunflower oil.  The
piece de resistance though was undoubtedly the griddle, sitting prominently
in the center of the island, covered in globs of pancakes, both burned and
raw.  Isabel followed a trail of flour from the island to kitchen table and
couldn't decide whether to laugh or scream.</p>

<p>There, happily gobbling down pancakes, sat Liz and Tess, covered from head
to toe in white flour, their bare feet having carried the stuff from the
griddle to the table.</p>

<p>Beside Iz, Maria coughed, obviously holding back a laugh.  Maria couldn't
decide which was funnier, Tess and Liz and their obvious flour fight, or the
completely stunned and shellshocked look on Isabel's face.  Finally,
deciding that it didn't matter which was funnier, Maria grabbed onto Isabel
for support and broke into uncontolled howls of laughter, slowly sliding
down Iz to sit on the floor.</p>

<p>Tess and Liz, oblivious to the other girls' presence up to that point turned
from their conversation and grinned unrepentantly at Isabel as Maria
collapsed to the floor with laughter.</p>

<p>Tess turned to Liz, "Is she alright?" she asked.</p>

<p>Liz nodded her head, "I think Isabel will recover from the shock in a moment
and be grateful that we thought to make extra pancakes for them."</p>

<p>Absently grabbing the tabasco bottle the Evans kept at the table, Tess shook
her head.  "No, not Isabel.  I know she'll survive.  She needs to see things
like this more often.  I meant Maria.  Is it possible to hurt yourself from
laughing like that?"</p>

<p>Calmly cutting another bite of her pancake, Liz met Tess's eyes, "I think I
would like to try yours.  I've always been curious about the Tabasco."  She
opened her mouth as Tess cut a bite and offered it to Liz.  Liz was shocked
when she didn't feel the urge to spit it back out, "Not bad.  Not bad at
all.  Oh, don't worry about Maria.  She'll be fine in no time."  Turning to
look at Maria, Liz called out, "If you don't hurry, Maria, your pancake's
will get cold."</p>

<p>Liz grinned at Tess's admiring gaze as Maria automatically stood and began
getting control of herself.  "Where are they?" she asked almost desperately.</p>

<p>"She is unbelievably hungry in the morning," Liz explained and Tess nodded
her head.</p>

<p>As Maria began to explore the kitchen, opening cupboard drawers, Tess said,
"In the microwave, Maria.  Are you all right Isabel?"</p>

<p>Isabel shook herself.  "You do know my mom is going to have a heart attack
when she sees what you've done to her kitchen don't you?"</p>

<p>Liz looked at Tess conspiratorily, "Don't worry about it, Iz.  We've got it
covered."</p>

<p>With a wink, Tess stood and casually swept the flour off the floor using her
powers and looked at Isabel, "I'll get the rest after breakfast," she
explained as she sat back down,</p>

<p>"It's only fair that Tess clean up the mess.  She started the fight in the
first place."</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head as she looked at the two girls, a smile slowly forming
on her now relaxed face.  "Just don't forget to clean yourselves up as
well."  And with that, Isabel finally gave into the urge and laughed,
turning to Maria who was already busily spread peanut butter on her
pancakes.  "Hey, leave a couple of those for me, Maria!" She shouted and
lunged to protect the two uncovered pancakes left.</p>
