<P>"Buffy, that's so awesome!" The redhead
was glowing with excitement.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd be as excited as you are if I knew
exactly what it was, Will."</p>

<p>"It's a . . . it's a custom built
computer! 500mhz Pentium three, with a
fifteen gig hard drive, CD burner, DVD player and a 50K
V.90 modem! And look, a seventeen inch
monitor! Buffy, this is
heaven! You're father must REALLY know how to
shop!" As the words flew out of her mouth, he
hands were gesturing to each item she'd rattled
off. Not that Buffy would remember where any
of it was in five minutes.</p>

<p>"Geez, Will . . . take it easy. You gonna
hook me up, or what? Because, I for one only
know slayerspeak, not computereze."</p>

<p>"Seriously? You want me to do
it?" Her eyes were wide with delight.</p>

<p>"I trust you Will. I'd probably blow
something up anyway." The slayer smiled and
left her friend to un-pack and set-up.</p>

<p>An hour and a half later, Willow took a step back and
admired her work. A few buttons pushed, a whirr here and
there, and it was up and running. Soon Willow
took on the role of teacher and was showing Buffy the
ropes.</p>

<p>". . .and if you double click on this, it brings up
your mail program, like so . . .then you can go up here
to where the mouth icon is and you can go into a campus
chat room." She was really in her element.</p>

<p>"Neat. Campus chat room? That
sounds kind of cool." Buffy clicked on the
icon and was transported into a welcome lobby.</p>

<p>They both sat there and watched the conversation
scroll by. "Man, Will . . . this is kinda
harsh, don't you think? Doesn't the campus
monitor these chats?"</p>

<p>"No, they're not monitored. You can
basically go in there and say and talk about anything
you want. It's a free speech thing, you
know? Besides, this is only a lobby, there
are much better rooms around."</p>

<p>Buffy gave her a look of
shock. "Will? I never took you for
a chatter? What kind of rooms do you go
into?"</p>

<p>Willow fell silent. Now how was she gonna
answer this one? "I, uh . . . well . .
.there's a whole bunch of rooms . . . I can't really
think of one right now." She stammered.</p>

<p>"You're blushing, Will. When you blush, I
KNOW something's up. Come on, spill!"</p>

<p>"Well . . ."</p>

<p>"Come on,
Will. Pleeeeeeessssseeee! With a
cherry on top?" Buffy gave her the best
wounded puppy look. "I'll be your best
friend?"</p>

<p>"You ARE my best friend, Buffy."</p>

<p>"And who better to share this with than your best
friend?" Buffy pouted.</p>

<p>That did it. How could Willow resist a
Buffy-pout? "Ok, well. Hold on a
second." She went over to her side of the
room and booted up her computer.</p>

<p>Buffy watched from the other side of the
room. In just a few moments, a box appeared
on her screen.</p>

<p>"Will, I think I broke it. Something just
came up on my screen."</p>

<p>"That's just me, Buffy. I'm inviting you
to a chat . . ." Willow turned around and
smiled at her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, OK, I knew that."</p>

<p>"Yeah . . .just click the OK button to accept the
chat."</p>

<p><code>Majik1: Hey you.</code></p>

<p><code>Duster: Hey yerself. This is
cool Will. Now I no what u do om the computr
all the time.</code></p>

<p><code>Majik1: Yeah, you'll get the hang of it
and make lots of on-line friends. Slow down
though, you have to watch your spelling. You
are a college sutdent after all.</code></p>

<p><code>Duster: Student you mean?.</code></p>

<p><code>Majik1: Ha, ha. Very
funny. I find chats by clicking on the random
button up top. You never know where you're
going to land. Try it!</code></p>

<p>After a few days, Buffy was chatting on her own and
making a lot of friends in the chat
rooms. She'd get in from patrol around one or
two, and then jump on for a quick chat. There
was always someone on at any hour. She
finally felt connected to people her age on campus.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy made her way down the hall and unlocked the
door. "Will? You
here?" She flipped on all the lights and
looked at the bulletin board.</p>

<p><i>Buffy, <BR>Studying late at the
library. Be back when my head hurts. ~~Will</i></p>

<p>&lt;That could be a while.&gt; Buffy
smiled to herself at the thought of
Willow. Her best friend was certainly in her
element here on campus. She'd changed so much
in the past year; had Buffy missed it, she probably
wouldn't have been able to recognize her at
all. She's come such a long way since she met
Oz. It's like he brought her out of her
shell. Now he was gone, and it seemed as
though Willow would revert to her old self. She didn't
though. She hung on and was stronger for
it. She paid more attention to how she looked
and started wearing makeup. Who knew such a
beautiful person was hiding under all of those bulky
sweaters . . . and her eyes sparkled . . . and her hair
. . .&lt;Stop it! Bad Buffy!&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head as if the movement would get the
thoughts out of her head. She felt guilty for
thinking about her friend like that. She
decided that she needed a
distraction. &lt;Let's see who's online . .
.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy booted up her computer and went to her mail
program. Nothing but junk. She
clicked on the chat icon and decided to pick a random
chat this time. &lt;Let fate decide where I
wind up tonight.&gt; She clicked the button and checked
the screen to see where she was. &lt;Hmm, this could
prove interesting. ~~Best friends, or more?~~&gt;</p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: And she doesn't feel
the same?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: I don't know how she feels,
really. We love each other, but we're best
friends. I don't want to risk it and feel
stupid.</code></p>

<p><code>Natsgrl: You won't know until you try
wicca. What if she feels the same way and you
miss this opertunity?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: opportunity. And maybe
you're right. We've been friends for the past
four years.</code></p>

<p>Buffy was watching this exchange with only one thing
on her mind, Willow. Could Wicca1 be
Willow? She had to find out.
&lt;Damn! How do I change my name
again?&gt;</p>

<p>After a few failed attempts, Buffy successfully
changed her screen name and got into the chat room
again.</p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: So what are you going to
do?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: I'm still not sure L</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Hi all. Just thought
I'd stop in. Not sure about what Wicca1?</code></p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: Hi NewHere</code></p>

<p><code>Natsgrl: Welcome NewHere! Pull
up a virtual sofa and help us convince Wicca1 that
telling her friend she has feelings for her is a good
idea!</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: Hey, NewHere. And
thanks, but I don't think I'm going to do it anyway.</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Why not? What could it
hurt?</code></p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: She thinks it'll ruin the
friendshop.</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: friendship . . . and that's not
the only thing I'm worried about.</code></p>

<p><code>Natsgrl: Come on, Wicca. You
said yourself that you've been friends for so long that
it probably won't come between you.</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: I'm still not seeing the
problem. You should tell her. What
else are you worried about?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: Oh, gee, let me count the
ways. a.) we live
together b.) we're best
friends c.) I'm almost positive
that she doesn't feel the same way and
d.) I'm just a big chicken.</code></p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: Now you're just making excuses.</code></p>

<p><code>Natsgrl: Yeah, I mean you live together. .
. and if it works out that's a bonus! Lol</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: I agree. You're best
friends already, so you don't have to worry about
building up a friendship first. I have to
agree with Nat. Living together is a big
plus.</code></p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: And if she doesn't feel the same
way then you tried. And if she's really your
best friend . . .</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Then she won't think any less of
you for it. In fact I think she'd be
flattered.</code></p>

<p><code>DrkGrl: Yeah, it's going to
bother you until you try.</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: Thanks guys, you've all helped a
lot, but I think I'm going to sleep on
it. See you all later.</code></p>

<p>Buffy wasn't sure what to
make of this new information. She wasn't even
sure if it was Willow. But what if it
was? What if Willow was having feelings for
her? She didn't even want to go there unless
it was true. Sure she'd considered it before,
but she never in a million years thought Willow would
feel the same way.</p>

<p><code>PRIVATE MESSAGE <BR>Wicca1: Still there?</code></p>

<p>&lt;Oh, God . . .what do I do?&gt; Buffy
sat there and stared at the screen as if it was going to
open up like a portal to hell. &lt;Answer her
you fool!&gt;</p>

<p><code>NewHere: Yeah.</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: So you think I should go for it?</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Sure. I mean there's
really nothing to lose except some pent up frustrashun,
right?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: frustration . . . I
suppose. L</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: How do you even know she doesn't
feel the same way? Have you ever asked her,
or were there ever signs that she didn't?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: Well . . . &lt;sheepish grin&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Come on, what is it . . .
&lt;poking at wicca with a long stick&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: A lot of different situations have
brought us closer together. She makes me feel
so safe, literally, and we've become affectionate over
the past year.</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: What else?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: We have a mutual friend that's
liked her since we all met and sometimes just so he
doesn't get any ideas, we hold hands, or she puts her
arm around my shoulder. It's stupid, I'm
reading into things.</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't believe what she was
reading. This had to be Willow and she HAD to
be talking about Xander. There wasn't
anything that could convince her otherwise.</p>

<p><code>Wicca1: Hello?</code></code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: I'm still here. Just
contomplating your sitch. . .</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: contemplating . . .so what do you
think?</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Why do you do that?</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: What?</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Correct everyone's
spelling. I don't mean to offend you but it
can get kind of irritating.</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: I'm sorry. I'm a school
geek at heart. I won the spelling bee three
years in a row in grade school. Again, I'm
sorry if I offended you. Maybe I should sign
off now.</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: No, Wait! I didn't
mean to scare you off.</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: It's ok, really. I have
to get back to the dorms. My roommate must
think I've fallen asleep at the library.</code></p>

<p><code>NewHere: Tell her. You won't
regret it. I promise.</code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: How do you know?</code></p>

<p><code><code>New Here: I know. Good night
and good luck!</code></code></p>

<p><code>Wicca1: Night!</code></p>

<p>Buffy shut her computer down
and decided that she couldn't go to sleep
yet. Instead, she decided to take a shower to
pass the time and when she was done, Willow
would be back.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<P>Willow put her key in the door and opened it slowly
so as not to disturb Buffy. She turned the
lights on and found the room
empty. &lt;That's strange. I
wonder where she is?&gt; Not ready for sleep
yet, and finding that her stomach was protesting, she
left the room to hit the closest vending machine.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy crept in and noticed that Willow's book bag was
on her bed. She opened her drawer and removed
her bathrobe to put her pajamas on.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>She looked over and there, in all her nakedness was .
. ."Buffy! I, uh . . .Oh, God I'm so
sorry." Willow turned away from her and
closed the door.</p>

<p>"Will, it's OK, I mean . . . it's not like you're a
peeping tom or anything." She threw on a
nightshirt. "OK, I'm done."</p>

<p>Willow still stood there with her back to
Buffy. "I'm sorry, I didn't know you were
changing and I didn't mean to walk in on you, I was
hungry and went to the vending machine and came back and
there you were and I didn't see anything really . . ."</p>

<p>Buffy crossed the room and put her hand on her
babbling friend's shoulder. "Will, I said it
was alright, really. It's not like you
haven't seen me change before, right? Take it
easy. Why is this freaking you
out?" She was really concerned.</p>

<p>"I, uh . . . guess I'm over tired. I don't
know. I really didn't mean to do
it." She relaxed a little under the slayer's
touch. "I'm fine."</p>

<p>"Then why can't you face me?" Buffy gave
her shoulder a little squeeze. "You're so
tense. Did you over study and forget to stop
when your brain hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess that's it. Over studied."</p>

<p>"Well, get ready for bed and come on over
here. You're looking at the A number one
expert on tension and I have just the fix for you."</p>

<p>Without turning around, Willow went over to her side
of the room and changed. She didn't turn
around to look at Buffy the whole time, which was quite
a feat considering that they shared one dresser and it
was on Buffy's side of the room. When she was
through, she started to straighten up her side of the
room and her desk and put her books away. It
was utter and complete stalling and the slayer would
have none of it. She crossed the room quickly
and came up behind the redhead.</p>

<p>"Will."</p>

<p>She jumped at the sound of Buffy's voice right behind
her. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"You're stalling . . .and
avoiding. Stalling and avoiding means
something's wrong."</p>

<p>"I'm not stalling. You know I hate it when
I can't find things and it has to be done before I go to
bed. . . and I'm not avoiding, just
straightening." She tried to sound confident.</p>

<p>"OK, well, it looks fine to me, Will. Come
on over here. I have just the thing you
need."</p>

<p>&lt;You're not getting out of this one,
Rosenberg. Now what are you going to
do?&gt; Willow gave a little sigh of
resignation and walked over to Buffy's bed.</p>

<p>Buffy crossed the room and sat down on the bed with
her back to the wall. "Come on in, the
water's fine." She gave her friend a smile,
hoping it would ease the tension. "I'm going
to give you the best back rub you've ever had in your
life. Bar none."</p>

<p>"Buffy, that's really not necessary. I'm
tired and I'm not tense anymore." Willow
tried her best to wiggle out of it.</p>

<p>"No way, Will. You're not getting out of
this. Let me do this for
you. Please?" She pulled out her
best pouty face - the kind she reserves for second
helpings of dessert and shopping at the mall with her
mom.</p>

<p>Willow, of course, couldn't resist. She
sat down on the edge of the bed. Buffy got up
on her knees and had Willow lay down on her
stomach. "Now don't move. I'll be
right back." She got up and turned all the
lights off. The only light now was coming in
from the lights outside their room.</p>

<p>Willow began to get nervous. "Buffy, you
really don't have to . . ."</p>

<p>"Shh, I want to. You always take care of
me, Will. You put band-aid's on my cuts and
sit with me when I have nightmares. I want to
do this for you, OK? You're my best
friend." She got up on the bed and sat on
Willow's thighs. "Am I too heavy for you?"</p>

<p>Willow's voice came muffled through the
pillow. "No, you're fine."</p>

<p>She started with the small of her back first, rubbing
tiny little circles into it with the padding of the
thumbs. Slowly, she worked her way up and
used her palms on her shoulder blades and upper
back. She could feel Willow relaxing with
every motion she made. "You OK down there,
Will?"</p>

<p>Willow was by all accounts, very OK. She
couldn't believe this was happening . . . didn't want to
believe it. Buffy was lavishing all of this
attention on her. She could stay like this
forever. She'd come back to the dorm room,
ready to throw caution to the wind and tell her
everything. Then she found Buffy standing
naked in the room and went way beyond
non-verbal. She couldn't think, couldn't
react . . . all she could do was notice the butterflies
flying a marathon in her stomach. Now the
slayer was giving her a back rub because she was 'her
best friend'. Willow was glad she didn't say
anything. It would have definitely ruined
everything and back rubs would be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>"Earth to Will. . . come in Will?"</p>

<p>A little groan of acknowledgement told Buffy that she
was indeed, OK. She moved on from the
shoulder blades to her shoulders. This proved
to be a tricky situation because her shirt was getting
bunched up. To fix the problem and to keep
her shy friend clothed, Buffy reached up under the shirt
and reached for her shoulders. Almost
immediately, she felt Willow tense up.</p>

<p>"Buffy . . .I don't . . ."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Will. Am I making you
uncomfortable?" She slid down between the
wall and Willow's body. "I didn't mean
to. I'll stop." Immediately she
broke contact.</p>

<p>Willow looked over at her. "No, it's
alright. I guess, I . . . Buffy, why are you
doing this for me?"</p>

<p>Buffy laid there for a while, her eyes
closed. She wasn't really sure how to answer
that question. &lt;Gee, Will . . . by
pretending I was someone else I found out that you have
feelings for me and I'm trying to make you tell
me.&gt; That would never work.</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Still here, Will. Just contemplating your
question."</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was a hard one. I mean
you're not getting graded on it or
anything." She smiled at her in the
darkness. She had secretly imagined this many
times before . . .laying next to Buffy in bed . . .so
close she could feel her body heat . . . close enough to
&lt;Stop! Bad . . big, bad, evil
thoughts!&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy rolled over and looked at he
friend. "Will, if I ask you something, do you
promise not to get mad at me for it?"</p>

<p>"What could you possibly do that would make me
mad??" She gave her a questioning look.</p>

<p>"Well, I need some advice really. I have a
friend who is best friends with someone . . .and well,
this best friend has feelings for the friend and doesn't
know how to tell him about it. They've been
friends for years and she's afraid that telling him
would ruin the friendship. So, what would you
do in that situation? How would you handle
it?"</p>

<p>Willow absorbed everything she said and it could only
mean one thing. Buffy had feelings for Xander
after all. She felt like she'd been staked in
the heart. She actually wished that she had
been and turned to dust so she wouldn't have to answer
this question.</p>

<p>"Will?"</p>

<p>"I would tell the friend to go for it. If
they're really best friends, then, then even if he
didn't feel the same way, it wouldn't change
anything. He'd probably be flattered."</p>

<p>Buffy was one hundred per cent convinced that it was
Willow in the chat room now. She just gave
the advice she'd been given herself not even an hour
ago. "Really? I don't see you
going for it though. Is that what you'd
really do?"</p>

<p>"Probably not." Willow gave a little
chuckle. "I'm too chicken and I'd be afraid
to ruin the friendship. What if she doesn't
feel the same way? What if she finds out and
nothing is the same afterwards, even if she finds it
flattering and says nothing will change? How
do you really know for sure? What if she
regrets it and it all turns bad?"</p>

<p>"Uh, Will? What was that all about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry. Guess I got a little carried
away." She gave a sheepish grin.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Buffy broke the
silence. "Will?"</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you. Before you
respond, I want you to think long and hard about
it. OK?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Buffy. What is it?"</p>

<p>Buffy's voice was barely above a
whisper. "Tell me. You won't
regret it. I promise."</p>

<p>Willow lay there in shock. She
knew! How could she know? Was she
friends with the girls in the chat room? Did
she give so many clues over the past week to them that
they figured out who she was and told
her? She couldn't move, couldn't breath . .
.all she could do was lay there with a million thoughts
running through her mind.</p>

<p>Buffy knew it was a chance to say these words to her
. . .knew that it could all come together and fall apart
at the same time with these three small
sentences. She had put it all on the line and
now it was all up to Willow. Their future,
together or apart, hung in the
balance. &lt;Nothing! She's saying
nothing. God, what have I
done.?&gt; Slowly, she reached out to touch
the redhead's shoulder.</p>

<p>She jumped at the touch and, in one swift movement,
jumped off the bed. "Buffy,
don't. I can't . . .we can't talk about
this." Tears were forming in her eyes
now. Angry, hot tears. "Please,
just don't. . . . don't mention it
again!" She ran over to her side of the room
and flew under her covers, tears covering the pillow.</p>

<p>"Will, I . . ."</p>

<p>"No. Don't Buffy . . . just don't."</p>

<p>She could do or say nothing more. She
should have known it would be a mistake to say
anything. &lt;Now what am I gonna
do?&gt; Willow had such a horrible reaction
to this, she wasn't sure exactly what she could do to
fix it. &lt;Well, the fall term is over
now. Maybe if we spent time together over
winter break we could be alright.&gt;</p>

<p>They both lay there, each lost in their own
thoughts. Slowly, painfully, they both fell
asleep with the other one on their minds.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The slayer woke up early, as most slayers are prone
to do. The sun beckoning them to start a new
day as early as possible. Buffy always
thought that it was some cruel gift. Slayers
had a short life span, so the Powers That Be gave her
the ability to sleep little and wake at the crack of
dawn, maybe to enjoy the day fully, because it may be
her last.</p>

<p>She stretched and noticed the time, 8 o'clock . .
.and it was Saturday. Time to get everything
together and take it home for break. Slowly,
she sat up. &lt;Something's
wrong.&gt; She looked around and noticed that
there wasn't a trace of Willow left in the
room. Even her Dingo's poster was
gone. Buffy silently cursed
herself. &lt;Not only do slayers need little
sleep, but when they sleep, they sleep like
logs. Great! She bailed.&gt;</p>

<p>Walking over to the bulletin board, she noticed a
little note:</p>

<p><i>Buffy: <BR>One exam at 7am. If I don't see
you, have a nice holiday. ~~Will</i></p>

<p>If I don't see you? Have a nice
holiday? &lt;Now what the hell is that
supposed to mean?&gt; Buffy knew that in
order to talk to Willow, she'd have to find
her. She was probably finishing her exam and
heading home to her parents' house. She
picked up the phone and called her mom to come get
her. When the arrangements were made, Buffy
could do nothing but pack.</p>

<p>Her mother arrived around ten, and found that all the
packing was done.</p>

<p>"Buffy, you finished? I was all ready to
help you." Joyce gave her daughter a little
hug,</p>

<p>"Yeah, mom. I had nothing else to
do. Come on. Let's get this stuff
in the truck so we can go home." She smiled
and they were off.</p>

<p>As soon as everything was back in her room again,
Buffy didn't even bother to unpack. She raced
down the stairs and waved goodbye to her mother saying
something about having to talk to Willow.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"She's still not here?"</p>

<p>It had been over a week since they moved out of the
dorms, and for what was the tenth time, Buffy found
herself at Willow's door.</p>

<p>Sheila Rosenberg smiled sadly at the girl before
her. "I'm sorry. You just missed
her. I think she said something about the
mall."</p>

<p>"Thank you anyway." Buffy smiled at the
woman and left. It was two days until the new
year and Willow had managed to elude her every step of
the way. Buffy set out to Giles'
house. Maybe he'd have some answers.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I haven't seen her Buffy. Possibly since
before your fall term ended. I did find it
rather odd. Has something
happened?" Giles was sitting on the couch
next to her, fatherly concern in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Not really. . . well, we had a misunderstanding and
she left the dorm before we could resolve
it. Now I can't find her. It's
like she's disappeared!"</p>

<p>"I see. Well, perhaps you should give her
some time to think things over. She'll come
around, I'm sure." He gave her a reassuring
smile.</p>

<p>The door opened behind them.</p>

<p>"Will?" Buffy turned around.</p>

<p>"Nope, but will I do? How's it going,
Buff. Long time no see. You don't
call, you don't write . . . you don't even ask me to
come slay with you anymore. Have I done
something to offend?" Xander crossed the room
and knelt in front of the slayer, mock hurt in his eyes.</p>

<p>"No Xander. I've just been busy with
slaying and bonding with mom over
shopping." She gave him a little slap on the
shoulder. "So how have you
been? Where's Anya?"</p>

<p>"Anya is shopping downtown. I've been
good. Trying to enjoy being the irresistible
townie that I am." He gave her a big Xander
smile. "Speaking of which, a little birdie
told me that they're throwing a big New Years Eve party
at The Grotto on campus."</p>

<p>"Yeah . . . and?" Buffy had a feeling she
knew what was coming.</p>

<p>"Well, Anya and I, being townies of course, have no
access to this wonderful party. So we were
wondering if maybe, just maybe, you'd take pity on us
and take us as guests!"</p>

<p>Buffy gave a little sigh of
resignation. "Sure, Xand. We can
do that. You should spend New Years with the
ones you love, right? How about you
Giles? You game?"</p>

<p>"I for one, am expecting Olivia on the noon flight
tomorrow, Buffy. Thank you anyway for
asking."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>They walked into The Grotto around ten
o'clock. The crowd was just beginning to fill
out and there was music playing over the
speakers. Some frat boys were playing
quarters at a table nearby with their respective
girlfriends cheering them on.</p>

<p>"Buffy looked over to Xander. "It's like
the Bronze . . . only more twisted." She gave
him a little smirk.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Buffy. We'll get into the
swing of things soon enough."</p>

<p>Anya made a little offering. "I don't
think I like this place. It smells like
hormones." She crinkled up her nose.</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it. Actually, I think
I just figured out what the dorms smell
like." Buffy laughed a
little. &lt;I just need to have a little
fun.&gt;</p>

<p>About an hour later, the three of them were on the
dance floor. Xander was in heaven because he
was between Buffy and Anya. A dark haired guy
danced his way over to Buffy.</p>

<p>"Hey, how's it goin'?" He yelled over the
music.</p>

<p>"Fine thanks." She smiled and turned to
dance with him. &lt;Find the fun, Summers . .
. find the fun.&gt;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>She was sitting at a little table in the
corner. As soon as they walked in, she knew
it. Willow looked over to the door and
spotted Buffy immediately. &lt;She's like
magnetic north. I always know when she's
around and I get sucked in.&gt; She watched
them mingle, watched them talk, watched them mingle some
more. She wasn't sure why she'd come here
tonight. Wasn't sure exactly what it was she
wanted to accomplish. She'd been able to
think about everything this past week or so and one
thing was certain . . .she didn't want to lose Buffy's
friendship. She'd have to talk to her sooner
or later. It looked like it was going to be
later by the way Willow saw her dancing with that guy.</p>

<p>Buffy was there, but she really
wasn't. She was going through the motions of
dancing and having a good time, but she knew something
was missing. Willow. She had been
missing for some time now, and Buffy wasn't sure what to
make of it. &lt;I still can't figure out why
she freaked out that way.&gt; Buffy turned
around to dance with Xander again and stopped dead in
her tracks. There across the room, Willow was
sitting alone at a table, watching her.</p>

<p>Willow realized she'd been
spotted. &lt;I'm not ready for
this.&gt; She got up quickly and tried to
make her way out the door.</p>

<p>Buffy was fighting her way through the crowd and
follow the red hair that was at least ten feet in front
of
her. "Willow! Stop!" She
didn't turn around. . .in fact, Buffy thought she picked
up more speed.</p>

<p>Once outside, Buffy twirled herself around trying to
spot her. There in the distance, she could
see Willow retreating quickly down the
block. &lt;Oh no you
don't.&gt; She quickly closed the gap between
them and grabbed her shoulder from
behind. "Will, stop! Please talk
to me!"</p>

<p>She stopped but didn't turn around. "I
can't . . .I thought I could, but . . .I never should
have come here . . .i-it was a mistake." She
could still feel Buffy's hand on her
shoulder. "Let go."</p>

<p>"No. I'm not letting you go until you tell
me what's going on. Where have you
been? Why haven't you talked to
me?" Buffy's voice began to
crack. "It's been over a week,
Will. We haven't been apart that long since I
ran away after Angel . . . left." She let her
hand slip from Willow's shoulder. "You're
being selfish."</p>

<p>"Selfish? ME? I can't believe
you'd say that! Don't you even try that on me
Buffy. You have no idea what I've been going
through in the past week and a half!"</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed her arm and pulled her into a nearby
ally for privacy. "What you've been going
through? What about me? I went to
your house at least ten time and every time your mother
told me you weren't there! You had to be
there, Will. Even you can't find an excuse to
be out of the house EVERY night!" The anger
in her eyes was clear.</p>

<p>"And what if I was? What if I just didn't
want to see you? What if I needed time by
myself? Did you ever think of that,
Buffy? Did you think for one minute that I
couldn't handle this and I just needed to
bail? You know, it doesn't work when you
follow me. I had to work it out on my own."</p>

<p>"Hold it Will. Don't you think I needed to
think about it too? It's not every day you
find out your best friend has feelings for
you!" She paused a moment for
effect. "And this isn't about your stuff, or
my stuff . . . it's about us, Will. It's our
stuff and we should work it out together!"</p>

<p>Willow turned to face her. "You still
don't get it, do you? This is about me. My
feelings, my confusion, my uncertainty. . . it's not
about you. You would have never even known
any of this if you weren't spying on me in a chat
room! You've been blind for years now and I
really wish you would have stayed that
way!" She was crying
now. Hard. She turned
away. "I can't . . . I just can't handle
this, any of it. *sob* You don't know what . . . you
don't know how bad I *sob* wanted to . . .t-to tell you,
everything. . . I . . .the way I feel scares me . .
." She was hugging herself, unable to
continue.</p>

<p>Buffy was taking it all in. She knew it .
. . all of it. Only because she'd been
feeling it too. She felt that flutter when
she reached out and it was Willow's hand she was
reaching for, felt it when they walked down the street
and pulled her into a hug for no good
reason. It was on purpose, it was deliberate,
and now faced with the naked truth, it was time to do
something about it.</p>

<p>A loud noise broke them both out of their
silence. They peered out of the ally and saw
people pouring out into the streets, dancing and blowing
horns. It was a new year.</p>

<p>Willow chuckled cynically and
whispered. "happy new year."</p>

<p>Buffy was shaken out of her reverie by the
words. She stepped up to Willow and turned
her around. She reached up and put both of
her hands on the redhead's shoulders. "That's
right, Will, it is a new year, and time for some new
years resolutions." Willow was looking down,
unable to fight anymore. "I resolve to give
you your space, as much as you need. But only
after I get my say. I know how you feel . .
.I know how confused and frightened you
are." Willow began to shake her head in
protest, but Buffy pressed on. "Yes I
do. I know it, Will. . . because I feel it
too. I know how scared you are, I know how
unsure you feel. And I know exactly what
you've been going through this past week and a half
because I've been going through it too." Her
voice cracked and tears made their path down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Slowly, Willow looked up at her. She
wasn't sure what to say, what to
feel. &lt;Does this mean? No, it
can't be.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy saw the look in Willow's eyes. She
wasn't buying a word of it . . . &lt;She doesn't
understand what I'm saying . . . she doesn't
want to.&gt; Slowly, Buffy's hands dropped
down to the lapels of Willows coat and latched onto
them. She saw Willow give her a confused
look, but Buffy continued on and backed her up until her
back was against the wall . . . both literally and
physically. "You don't believe me, do you,
Will?" She shook her head no in
acknowledgement. "Tell
me. Everything. You won't regret
it. I promise." She lifted her
head up a little so they were eye to
eye. "Tell me how you
feel. Please."</p>

<p>Willow swallowed hard. She wasn't sure if
the words that were swimming around her head would allow
themselves to form sentences. "I . . .Buffy I
care about you. I always have. I
don't know how it happened . . . I guess it was slow at
first, like I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it
was, but . . .and I can't even believe I'm saying this,
but . . .I find you . . . attractive and I love you,
you're my best friend and I don't want to ruin that, I
don't want to lose what we have." She
suffered through it, but got through it none the less."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled a little. "That wasn't so
hard, now was it?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not." She managed a smile
too.</p>

<p>Buffy looked into her eyes. "Put your arms
around me, Will."</p>

<p>Her eyes went wide. "No. . .I can't. . ."</p>

<p>"You can." Buffy smiled. "I'll
wait."</p>

<p>She started to raise her arms. It was slow
at first, she was still so unsure of herself and the new
feelings that were surfacing. &lt;It's only
Buffy. You've done this a million times
before.&gt; Two arms reached out and
enveloped the slayer and at the same time a new
situation presented itself. They were now as
close as two people could get and they both noticed each
other's erratic breathing.</p>

<p>"I knew you could do it, Will." Buffy
leaned in and pressed her forehead against the hackers.</p>

<p>"Yay me." She let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"OK, well, I've said what I had to
say. I'll leave you alone
now." Buffy wriggled out of her arms and
headed back to The Grotto, leaving one very confused
redhead in the ally.</p>

<p>No sooner had she left, Willow realized what had
happened and took off after her. "Buffy,
wait!" She caught up and this time it was her
reaching out and stopping the retreating
girl. "That's it? You said what
you had to say and you just leave me there?"</p>

<p>"I made a promise to you, Will. I said I
was going to say what I had to and then give you as much
space as you needed. That's what I'm
doing." She was very matter-of-fact about it.</p>

<p>"Well, what if I don't want space?!" She
looked around and noticed that they were starting to
draw a crowd. She lowerd her voice to a
whisper. "What if . . . what if all I want is
you?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked around and noticed everyone
too. "Then all you'd have to do is say
so." She stepped in and closed the gap
between them.</p>

<p>"I want you, Buffy. In my life . . . in as
big of or as small as you want your roll to
be." She reached out and touched the slayer's
face. It didn't take long for either of them
to lean in and do what they'd been waiting
for.</p>

<p>The kiss was sweet and new. They lingered
a bit, neither wanting it to end, but they broke away to
the hoots and hollers of the crowd behind
them. They both smiled at each other and
hugged.</p>

<p>"Happy New Year, Buffy."</p>

<p>"Happy New Year, Will." She looked up and
realized that they probably presented quite a sight . .
. two girls kissing in public. "Let them
stare. They're gonna have to get used to it
sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Darn tootin!"</p>
