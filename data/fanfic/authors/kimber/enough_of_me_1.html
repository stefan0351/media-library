<!-- Enough of Me \ Part 1 -->

<p>Stupid. </p>

<p>Stupid  Thwack!  Dumb  Crunch!  Idiot  Slap! Moron  Kick, kick... 'stake'....poof!</p>

<p>The pile of dust was proof positive that messing with the slayer now was not the best move to make after first rising.  She'd made her rounds through the cemetery as usual.  Checked the crypts, and two fresh graves.  It would have taken her all night had Willow not left her a map of the cemetery and the names of the two boys who'd died of a 'mysterious loss of blood.'  Willow.  Her mind drifted back to only a week ago, when they'd crossed the line...gone past the point of no return.  Buffy felt the color rise in her cheeks and her pulse quicken.  Willow was all she'd thought about lately.  Winter break was here and it was a chance to explore the new side of their relationship, make a solid connection.  So what went wrong?  Why was Buffy in the cemetery patrolling alone and Willow was.....</p>

<p>{"I have to go."</p>

<p>"But Will, classes are over.  We finished exams!  We have to celebrate, together..."</p>

<p>"No, Buffy.  I'm...I'm spending the holidays with my parents.....in Wyoming. They're at my grandparents' house...and they...um...they reserved me a ticket...."</p>

<p>"But, I thought...."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"What about....?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked beyond her friend, saw the bags there, on her bed.  Saw her computer packed up, her bed made, and apparently, her mind was made up too.  She couldn't move.  Afraid that the slightest movement would put things in motion.  She stood there, her head down, a million images running through her mind....</p>

<p>Before she knew it, Willow was a breath away.</p>

<p>"I have to go.  My plane leaves at six."</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I...."</p>

<p>She was at a loss for words, they both were.  Without a sound, Willow reached up and lightly touched her fingers to Buffy's cheek.  Leaning in, she left a light, lingering kiss there.</p>

<p>Buffy was startled.  After Willow began to pull away, Buffy reached out and grabbed her friend into a crushing hug.  The tightness in her throat let go in a strangled sigh, tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"But, I don't want you to go.  Why do you have to leave now?"</p>

<p>"I need to, Buffy."</p>

<p>"No!  You're...you're running away....there's a difference...."</p>

<p>Willow pulled away and removed Buffy's arms from her neck.  Buffy frowned at the loss of contact.  Gathering her things, Willow made her way to the door.</p>

<p>"I'll see you after break, Buffy.  Take care of yourself."</p>

<p>Willow opened the door.......</p>

<p>"I love you, Will."</p>

<p>Then she closed it.}</p>

<p>........She'd closed the door to their room, and effectively, their relationship.  By some fluke, Buffy found the phone number to Willow's grandmother's house buried on the desk underneath the cemetery map and called earlier in the evening.  Willow refused to come to the phone, her grandmother made excuses and said she was resting, but Buffy knew the truth.  Willow was avoiding her.</p>

<p>For three days before exams, a silence covered the town of Sunnydale, an Unwelcomed silence.  'The Gentlemen' took their voices away, slowly and methodically hunting for seven hearts.  By the time Buffy reached the bell tower and, side by side with Riley, fought the demons, there were two jars left.  They both knew what it meant.  With Riley smashing the box and Buffy screaming, The Gentlemen's plan was averted, but not without consequence.  As Willow put it, something really 'freaky' passed between her and the new witch Tara.  Admittedly, something passed between Buffy and Riley also.  They'd kissed.</p>

<p>Buffy was sure Willow found out about the kiss.  She and Riley had been talking about their 'identities,' their separate duties, and the kiss.  Willow walked in moments after, back from her 3 o'clock class.  She gave no sign that she'd heard what they were saying, but Buffy knew she did.  She wouldn't have been acting so distant and awkward lately had she not.</p>

<p>The four days leading up to Willow leaving were filled with near misses and Tense undercurrents in their conversations.  Buffy went to the Library, Giles' house, Xander's basement, the cafeteria . . missing Willow by mere minutes each time.  Finally, having had enough of everything going unspoken, Buffy cornered her in their room.  Willow knew she was supposed to be on patrol, and that's probably why she was there.....</p>

<p>{"Hey Will."</p>

<p>"Buffy, I....I thought you were on patrol?  Did something happen?  Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm fine.  Thought I'd skip patrol tonight to in lieu of more important things..."</p>

<p>"What's more important than patrol?  Giles isn't going to like this..."</p>

<p>"Us.  We're more important.  What's going on, Will?  Why have you been avoiding me?"</p>

<p>"Avoiding?  I'm  not avoiding you...see?...this is me not avoiding.  We're here... together...in the same room...'cause, this is where we live...together...no avoiding going on here!"  Her response was all too chipper and not very convincing.</p>

<p>"I think we need to talk about things.  About us.  What happened the other night was..."</p>

<p>"Buffy, I really don't want to talk about it, OK?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her for a moment.  "No, it's not OK, Will."  The hacker shot her a look of surprise.  "I mean, I care about you...and I want the best for you...I hate that things are so weird between us....I want things back to the way they were..."</p>

<p>"We can't go back Buffy.  Don't you see?  What happened was.....it probably shouldn't have happened.  We shouldn't have...."  She moved out from behind her desk, silencing the slayer with a wave of her hand before she could interject, "Let me finish.  I don't know what this is.  I....I don't know who I am anymore.  I was always the computer geek in high school, or Xander's unrequited crush, then I was your side-kick and Giles' research girl.  Then to top it all off, I was the witch girlfriend of Sunnydale's resident werewolf.  Now, I've lost myself somewhere between here and there.  Everything's moving so fast and I can't....I won't get caught up in it.  I need time...I have to think about everything.  I just need you to leave me alone for now....please."  With that she walked out the door.}</p>

<p>Without even realizing it, Buffy had think-walked herself to the front porch of Willow's house.  She would have chuckled at the irony of the situation had she not been so consumed with thought.  Four hours.  She's been gone four hours, two states away and you show up on her doorstep.   Trotting down from the porch, Buffy regrouped herself and set a new course for Giles' house.  Since her mother was still away, she'd be spending Christmas with him.  Her mother had tried to convince her to stay with her father for the holiday.  It worked, but when she called her father, she found out that he'd be in New York for a conference the week of Christmas and New Year's Eve.  He didn't even offer to have her go with him.  She gave him Giles' number and hung up.  Still, Christmas with Giles wouldn't be THAT bad.  At least that's what she tried to convince herself of on the walk over.</p>

<p>When Buffy walked in, Giles was just hanging up the phone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Buffy.  You just missed Willow, she called to wish me a good holiday."</p>

<p>"Really?  Oh, well...I guess I can try to catch her some other time."  Buffy flopped unceremoniously on the couch and flipped the TV on.  Giles gave her a look of curiosity and was going to say something but thought better of it.  She'll tell me when she's ready, I suppose.  The night went off without a hitch and dinner was unusually quiet.</p>

<p>"Buffy, is there something on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Hmm?  Oh, no....not really.  I, well....Willow and I kind of had words before she left and I'm feeling kind of icky about the whole thing.  I wish I could have talked to her when she called."</p>

<p>"I see. Yes, well, that would explain her mood on the phone then.  She was quite somber and distracted.  Not herself really.  Is it something you wish to talk about?"</p>

<p>Just then, Spike walked in, a mug of just-microwaved blood in his hand.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Slayer?  Shouldn't you be out somewhere dusting my friends or fighting demons and the like?" </p>

<p>"Shut up, Spike."</p>

<p>"Well, someone's in a horrible mood toady, aren't they?  What's wrong, luv, wake up on the wrong side of your stake?"  He grinned.</p>

<p>"I wish you would wake up on the wrong side of a stake, bleach boy."</p>

<p>"That's quite enough, you two.  Spike, Buffy is staying with me for the holidays.  She'll be in the other spare room.  I hope you two can, ah, amicably cohabitate.  It won't be for long."</p>

<p>Spike gave a disgusted look at both of them and switched the channel on the TV.</p>

<p>"Living with a Slayer.  Good thing Dru's not around to see this.  She'd be so disappointed.  What's become of me?"</p>

<p>Buffy helped Giles clean up after dinner, then went and sat at the other end of the couch.  "Oh, great.  Giles, I forgot all of my stuff!  Now what am I supposed to do?"</p>

<p>Spike didn't miss a beat.  "You could always sleep naked."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you, Fang." She glared at him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Buffy...it's still early.  You could go and get it now, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Giles, I'm 18.  Do you really think I'm only gonna bring an overnight bag?  I'm staying here for a month!"</p>

<p>"Yes, well.  That could be a problem.  I'd offer you my car, but..."</p>

<p>"No, thanks but no thanks.  Even if I did have my license, I wouldn't want to be caught dead in the watcher-mobile."</p>

<p>"Well that wasn't very nice."   Giles furrowed his brow.</p>

<p>"No offense, Giles."</p>

<p>"I'll take her."  It came from Spike.  They both looked at him like he had sprouted an extra head.</p>

<p>"What?  I'm bored and there's nothing on the telly.  I need to get out of here, all of this tweed and watcher dust is kicking up my allergies."  They didn't look too convinced.  "I'll be good, really."</p>

<p>"I must be insane to agree to this."  Giles looked torn.</p>

<p>Spike gave Giles a hopeful look and put on his best puppy dog face.</p>

<p>"Go ahead Buffy.  I'm sure it'll be fine."</p>

<p>"Fine.  But if he acts up, I swear I'll put him on a leash."  She crossed the living room and waited by the door.  Spike followed suit.</p>

<p>"Aww, promise?"  He smiled as they walked out the door.</p>

<hr>

<p>Two hours later, Spike's car was weighted down with Buffy's things.  It looked like it was ready to explode.</p>

<p>"I swear slayer.  I never had THIS much....crap....when I was 18.  What are you, some sort of a pack-rat?  And what the bloody hell are you going to do with all those pictures albums?  You're only staying there for a month.  It's not like you're not going to see all of your bloody friends over the holiday anyway."</p>

<p>Buffy was putting the last box in the car.  Either she didn't hear Spike's comments or didn't want to dignify them with an answer.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what I said?"  He looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"Huh?  Oh yeah Spike, sounds good..."</p>

<p>"Now I know something's REALLY wrong.  I'm trading barbs with you and all you can say is 'yeah that sounds good.'  You got a fever or something luv?  Aww, is the Slayer feeling feverish?  Did you catch the willies or something?"  Spike put on his best sarcastic whiny voice and reached his hand to her forehead.</p>

<p>She slapped his hand away, "Did I catch the what?  No, I'm fine.  I'm just distracted."</p>

<p>"Well, a distracted Slayer is a dead Slayer.  Got myself two slayers like that.  Why don't you tell old Spike what wrong?  Maybe I can help."</p>

<p>It looked like Spike, the voice was Spike's, but Buffy couldn't believe what she was hearing.  She poked at him with her finger.</p>

<p>"Hey!  Cut that out.  Me being ticklish and all that."  He swatted her hand away.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?  I thought I just heard you offer to help.  I must be feverish."</p>

<p>"Something's obviously bothering you, luv.  I'm really not in any position to give you THAT hard of a time.  Me being, well...."</p>

<p>"Neutered?  Impotent?"  Buffy offered.</p>

<p>"Temporarily incapacitated.  Now, what is it?  Tell old Spike.  You never know, I could be of some help.  I'm not all soul-havin' and all that, but I am pretty sharp.  Angel wasn't the only smart vamp in town."  Spike's face brightened.  "Hey, this has to do with the little witch, doesn't it?  What happened, Slayer?  Did she put frog entrails in your soup or something?"</p>

<p>"Remind me again why I should tell you anything?"  Buffy gave him a skeptical look.  She wasn't thoroughly convinced.  Yet.</p>

<p>"I'm an outsider, an unbiased opinion.  All of your little group is probably too close to it to give you an honest assessment.  Plus, I won't charge ya' for the advice.  Come on now, what's the dirt?  What did the little tree do to work you up into such a lather?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Willow.  Not little witch, or little tree.  Willow.  And she didn't do anything.  I did.  I think I totally messed up our friendship, and I don't think there's a way to get it back."</p>

<p>"Come on, Slayer.  Don't go all dramatic on me.  There isn't anything that can be THAT bad.  Even Dru and I can make up after a scuffle of sorts.  Heck, I even forgave her for kissing  that chaos demon...."  Just then, Spike's face lit up and a light bulb went on in his head.  "Unless, of course...."</p>

<p>"What?  WHAT?  Unless what, Spike?  Tell me or I'll stake you right here....."</p>

<p>"Well, unless you've, um, crossed some sort of a line.  You didn't......did you?" The look on Buffy's face answered his question.  "Didn't you learn your lesson with Angel?  He was all souled-up till you gave him happiness, and as much as I liked him without the bleeding heart routine, he was a menace when he lost it."</p>

<p>"Willow didn't lose her soul, Spike...she's human."  Buffy gave him a look of disgust.</p>

<p>"No, Slayer...she didn't.  But if your implying what I think you are, then she's lost something just as valuable.  She's lost her innocence.  That damn wolf ran off and left her hangin' by a thread, and none of you bloody well saw it until it was too late.  I don't think I have to remind you about the havoc she caused by that little will spell of hers.  I still can't get your taste out of my mouth."  He was pacing now, arms flying around in the air.  "She's vulnerable now and you took advantage of it!  I can't believe you.  I'm disappointed, really.  I thought you had more brains than that."</p>

<p>Buffy gave him an incredulous look.  "Since when do you care so much about Willow?  And what about your little speech in the magic shop, how'd it go?  'Love isn't brains children, it's blood.  Blood screaming inside you to......"</p>

<p>"All right, all right.  Enough with the posturing.  I full well know what I said to you two.  If I've learned anything in the century or so I've been around it's that love hurts.  And if you give it the chance it'll hurt you..."  Buffy was about to interrupt, but Spike waved his hand.  "I'm not saying it's not worth it, Slayer, don't get me wrong.  I'm saying that you have to be sure.  You have know in your heart that it's real and worth all the sacrifices.  And you also have to know that it's not easy.  Do you think it's worth it, Slayer?  Because if you don't, if you have even the smallest doubt in your mind, then all the love and fuzzy feelings in the world aren't gonna save your relationship with that girl.  Any kind of relationship.  If love is what's in the cards for you, then you'll know it, and so will she.  If it screams through your blood, if you feel her touch even though she's not here, if it makes you quiver from head to toe, then you'll know it."</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Buffy opened the passenger side door and gave Spike a look.  With that, they both headed back to Giles' house, the conversation still playing in each of their minds.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hello?  Um, yes. Oh, yes...how are you dear?  I've heard so much about you.  No, I'm sorry, she's had a long trip and is resting now.  I'll let her know you called, though.  Have a nice holiday.  Bye."</p>

<p>Willow was sitting on the couch drinking tea when her Grandmother came in from the kitchen.  She stood in the doorway and glanced at her granddaughter.</p>

<p>"I know, Nana.  I'll call her soon."  Willow replied to the gaze.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand it, dear.  You've written me so many letters and we've had so many phone calls.  You've told me all about Buffy, and it seems to me that she's your best friend.  Why on earth would you not want to talk to her?"</p>

<p>"It's complicated, Nana."</p>

<p>"Seems that nothing should be that complicated, dear.  If two people care for and love each other then that's the most uncomplicated thing we can wish for."  She smiled down ather granddaughter.  "Let me know if you need anything. I'll be in the sewing room."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nana."</p>

<p>Willow sat there for a while, taking in the scent of the familiar.  She spent many holidays and vacations here.  The house brought back comforting memories, the smell of baked cookies and vanilla and flowers.  That's what her grandmother always smelled like.  It was comfort she sought when she got on the plane, comfort in the familiar, the unchanged.  Willow's thoughts were broken by the sound of the phone again. Knowing Nana wouldn't hear it in the sewing room, she went to pick it up.</p>

<p>"Hello?  Mom! Hi.  Yes, I'm fine.  I just wanted to be with Nana for winter break.  Yes, I know.  I'm sorry you can't be here, too.  No, we'll be fine.  Nana always takes good care of me.  You too, I'll see you at home after New Year's.  Love you too, bye."</p>

<p>Willow was relieved that it was her mother on the other end of the line.  Sheila and Ira Rosenberg were spending time with Ira's parents in between conferences. They'd go to the temple there, in Chicago, to worship.  Anticipating the separation, Willow's mother sent her Hanukkah gifts to her with strict instructions to not open them until the right time, and they were even numbered.</p>

<p>Willow wandered into her bedroom, deciding that the plane trip had indeed wiped her out, and decided to take a nap.  Curling up on her childhood bed, she soon found out that her mind was working overtime.  Buffy.  She'd been the reason Willow left. Right?  Now she wasn't so sure.  Oz?  Giles?  Xander?  They could all be construed as contributing factors to her turning tail, but she knew that in the end, her own insecurities won out and forced her two states away from the people she loved.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't want her.  Not really.  It was a fluke.  She was still missing Angel and Willow had to admit that she still loved Oz.  That's why she did the spell.  She did a love spell the night she ran from Buffy after their awkward meeting in the Psych building.  After weaving her way through the throng of students she made her way home and went to the basement where the bulk of her supplies were stored.  It was meant to be a harmless spell, designed to have true love reveal itself to her and Buffy.  It was supposed to help them both get back together with the ones they loved.  But she did it wrong, she must have.  Right before the spell was to be completed, she heard footsteps on the porch outside the basement window.  Her mind immediately shot to Buffy and she became distracted with the days' events.  Instead of thinking of Oz, she thought of Buffy.  In hindsight of everything that happened, she could see why she got caught in the spell too.  With those thoughts, Willow finally began to drift off to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>{"Can't stop........duty........chosen......understand......"</p>

<p>Willow strained to hear the conversation behind her door.  She knew it was wrong but still, she couldn't help herself.</p>

<p>"I have.....duty too......choice......care about you.......get hurt......"</p>

<p>She could tell that it was Buffy and Riley.  All she knew was that he helped Buffy defeat the Gentlemen and that he had a secret of his own.</p>

<p>"Want to try.......relationship......take it slow........kiss you again........please"</p>

<p>"Can't........kiss was good......too fast......need time......sacred duty."</p>

<p>From the pieces of conversation she heard, Willow surmised that Buffy and Riley kissed, Riley wanted a relationship with her and Buffy wanted one, too, but wanted to take it slow.  Every word was like someone punching her in the gut.  She couldn't take it anymore.  Making sure she made plenty of noise with her keys, Willow walked into the room and over to her bed.</p>

<p>"Hi guys, how's it going?"</p>

<p>"Will, you're back from your 3 o'clock class."  Buffy gave her a look of relief.</p>

<p>"Willow, hi."  Riley grinned at her.  "Well, I guess I should be going. Buffy, we'll talk again soon?"  He gave her a hopeful look.</p>

<p>"Sure.  Take care Riley."}</p>

<p>Willow woke up snuggled under the covers.  She guessed her grandmother came in and pulled them over her at some point in her slumber.  Restless and no longer tired, she got up, went to the bathroom and decided to call Giles.  If Buffy was there then so be it.</p>

<p>"Giles, hi....I'm with my grandmother in Wyoming....yeah....I just wanted to wish you a happy holiday....hmm...yeah, I'm OK.  Just woke up from a nap....really?.....I guess you'll have your hands full with those two.  You take care too...I'll see you after break...Yes, I'll be back a week before classes start.  Bye."</p>

<p>That was interesting.  Buffy was staying with Giles for Christmas.  It was pretty ironic actually.  A happy little family unit flashed in Willow's mind.  Xander digging in the cabinets for something to eat, Anya pouting at the lack of attention, Giles rubbing the bridge of his nose because Buffy and Spike were trading insults back and forth in front of the fireplace.  Yes, one little demented, dysfunctional family complete with a Slayer, an ex-watcher, a demon, a 200 plus year old vampire, a 1120 year old ex-demon turned teenager and Xander.</p>

<p>She found her by the window.  Looking out on the snow, there was an expression of sadness on her face that made her look much older than her 18 years.  She'd never be able to figure her granddaughter out.  They say the eyes are the window to the soul.   Willow's eyes had been empty from the moment she'd walked through the door.  Something had happened to her granddaughter, something that took the fire out of her eyes, and Nana was determined to find out what it was.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come talk to me, dear?  The snow will still be there when we're done."</p>

<p>The older woman's voice shook Willow out of her trance.  How long had she been standing there?</p>

<p>"Sure, Nana.  What's on your mind?"  Willow walked over to the fireplace and put another log on the fire.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I was thinking.  What's on your mind?  Something's happened to my granddaughter and I want to know what it is.  Where has my Willow gone?"</p>

<p>Willow gave her a halfhearted smile.  This was going to be a long night........</p>

<p>"....so then I went back to his room, and all of his stuff was gone.  He left me Nana.  How could he do that?  Devon said he sent for the rest of his stuff.  He's settled down somewhere....else....that's not with me."   She was crying again.  The tears turned on and off in the past fours hours, now they were making an appearance once again.  She had told her grandmother everything.  EVERYTHING.  Graduation, Veruca, werewolf boyfriend and slayer best friend.  She'd began to confide in her when she was in high school, when the fluke happened with Xander.  Now everything came spilling out, and she held nothing back.</p>

<p>She looked at her, sobbing in the firelight.  Such things to go through for someone so young.   So much weight on her shoulders, weight she shouldn't have to bear alone.  But she didn't, did she?  Buffy was always there by her side.  But now she wasn't.  Her granddaughter ran from the comfort of her friends back home and she still didn't understand why.</p>

<p>"Oh, my beautiful Willow.  Such pain and heartache.  I wish I could make it all go away. But I can't.  You have to allow yourself to grieve.  Grieve for your lost love, your lost innocence.  Only then will you be able to pick yourself off the ground and stand tall.  There's no way around it.  But, there is a way for it to be easier...."</p>

<p>Willow looked up from her hands.  "What, Nana?  Anything...I-I'd do anything to feel better....anything."</p>

<p>"You have friends that love you.  Why did you come here when you have so many people to fall back on at home?"  Willow began to shake her head, but Nana continued . . . "You've confided in me, and to be a part of your life, to willingly make me a  part of your life....I couldn't have received a better gift than that.  But there are people more suited for the kind of comfort you're looking for.  People like Mr. Giles, and Xander and Buffy.  Why not sleep on it love, perhaps you'll see that the things you've run from are the things you need most."  She got up and gave her granddaughter a hug and a kiss goodnight and left her to her thoughts.  Willow followed soon after, crawled into bed and into sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Yes....Mr. Giles please......Mr. Giles?  Yes, it's Margaret....Hmm, yes, it has been a long time...fine, fine...enjoying my retirement....Yes, I was sorry to hear that, we both know what they're missing.......Rupert, I need to ask a favor....It seems to me that we have something in common...or should I say someone.....Yes, it's very important, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't.....of course....I probably should have come to you sooner, I'm afraid it may have gotten out of hand.....Would you mind a little trip?.....I won't keep you long....no, only two days or so......really?  Wonderful...I'll make the arrangements....no, no, don't be silly....the council can foot the bill for this one....I think they owe us both as much, don't you?  Splendid....yes, one more thing....why don't you bring your Slayer....yes...I realize she's not taking council orders.....it's important Rupert, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't....wonderful! Tomorrow then?  OK, I'll make the arrangements and have the travel agent call you with the airline and times.  Thank you, Rupert, I owe you one."</p>

<p>She realized that she may be overstepping her bounds.  But this was her granddaughter's happiness at stake!  In all her years as a watcher, all the prophesies, all the doom that was predicted, she was well prepared.  The fate of the world rested on the Slayer's shoulders, and when she steered her daughter and son-in-law towards Sunnydale to begin their life together, it wasn't by chance, it was by choice.  She only prayed that her granddaughter would be able to hone and perfect the powers she had within her.  The choice had been the right one, and her Willow and the slayer worked together.  It couldn't have been any better had she written the prophesy herself.  Now other forces threatened to take over, forces that were unpredicted or over-looked.  Well, there would be none of that.  Not while she was around.</p>

<hr>

<p>"We'll only be gone for a few days, Buffy.  Xander has already agreed to watch Spike, I'm sure that he's more than capable...."</p>

<p>"And who is this woman again?  A retired watcher or something?  Why does she want me to go?  Reliving old prophesies is so not what I had in mind for winter break, Giles."  Buffy rolled her eyes, but the look she got from Giles told her that there was no way to get out of it.</p>

<p>"Buffy, Margaret is a very respected member of the council.  Yes she is retired, but she still holds their favor, and mine.  She's done so many things for me in the past I cannot even begin to repay her.  If she's summoned both of us, there is a good reason, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I know Giles....When do we leave?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow.  Margaret has arranged for us to take a direct flight into Cheyenne and then a private plane..."</p>

<p>"Cheyenne?  Wyoming?  That's....that's where Willow is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but this is business and I don't think we'll have time to search the entire state of Wyoming for Willow..."  Giles saw the look on Buffy's face, like someone had punched her in the face and she stood there and took it.  "If we have time, we'll look her up."</p>

<p>With that, the slayer and the watcher prepared for the trip ahead of them.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Willow, you've been in this house for two days......Why don't you go out and get some fresh air?  Here, I'll give you some money and you can take a cab into town and go shopping, buy some gifts for your friends back home."</p>

<p>"I'd much rather stay here.  I'm in the middle of something on my computer and I don't want to leave it..."</p>

<p>"You've been in the middle of your computer for two days, Willow, I'm sure whatever it is, it will keep.  Come on now, get your jacket....or do I have to dress you myself?"</p>

<p>Willow knew she'd lost.  She saved her document and put her computer on the bed.  Grabbing her jacket and the envelope her grandmother gave her, she called for a cab and waited by the door.</p>

<p>"It'll be good for you to get out, dear.  Look, the cab is here.  I'll have dinner ready for you when you come back....now go...shoo!"  With a kiss on her cheek, Willow was off to town.</p>

<hr>

<p>An hour later, a black car pulled up the driveway.  Giles and Buffy stepped out and the driver carried their bags to the door, where a woman stood to greet them.</p>

<p>"Rupert!  Oh, it's so wonderful to see you again.  You're still as handsome as ever.  And this must be Buffy, I've heard so much about you dear....well, what are you waiting for?  Come in, come in."</p>

<p>"Nice to meet you.....Mrs.?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please....call me Nana...everyone does.  Now come on...I have tea on and I hear the water boiling."</p>

<p>After they settled in, the three of them sat down in the living room.</p>

<p>"You're probably wondering why I've asked you to come, Rupert."</p>

<p>"Yes, the thought had crossed my mind.  You said we had something in common, someone...."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, I'll get to that.  I've been retired for almost six years now.  Retirement is such a bore you know."  Giles nodded his head in agreement.  She then turned her gaze to Buffy.  "I was never an active watcher in the sense that Rupert was.  I never had my own slayer.  The council decided that I was better suited for books, prophesies and that sort of thing.  It was quite mundane really.  I was banished to the demon section of the card catalog more times than I can recall....."</p>

<p>"Hmm, prophesies.....we just love prophesies, don't we, Giles?"  Buffy gave him a look and they both smiled.</p>

<p>"There was one prophesy in particular that I researched, and the council saw it fit not to, shall we say, advertise the information."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear."  Giles gave Buffy a look of 'here we go again.'</p>

<p>"Yes well....I believe the year was 1981..."  She got up and went to her bookcase.  After some searching, she found what she'd been looking for.  "I was researching hellmouths.  Several of them had cropped up at once and the slayer at the time had quite an ordeal going from town to town trying to close them all...or at least inactivate them..."</p>

<p>"I seem to recall that they formed some path....." Giles offered.</p>

<p>"Quite right Rupert.  You remember, very good.  The path led straight to Los Angeles.  That is where the last hellmouth opened and, unfortunately, the slayer met her demise."</p>

<p>They all took a moment, lost in their own separate thoughts.  Giles and Buffy remembering the time Buffy had literally died trying to close the hellmouth.</p>

<p>"It's not a secret that most of the prophesies you and other watchers have dealt with have been predicted and researched by myself, along with a few others.  I was given this duty because I am not only a watcher, I am a seer."  Both sets of eyes were on her now.</p>

<p>"A seer?  Well, yes...I suppose that would make the most sense, now wouldn't it?  I always thought as much...."  Giles trailed off.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, Rupert."</p>

<p>"Figured as much." Buffy offered.</p>

<p>"Yes, well, I came to find out that there was to be a slayer born.  A slayer like no other we've ever seen.  Her powers, combined with her intelligence and wit, would be like nothing we've ever seen before, or will see again.  She would be THE Chosen One....the one to bring balance to the forces of good and evil.  She is..."</p>

<p>"Buffy?"  A little voice squeaked out from under an armful of packages.  "Giles?  What are you......Nana?.....Oh, man...." And with that, the petite redhead dropped her packages and fainted straight away.</p>
