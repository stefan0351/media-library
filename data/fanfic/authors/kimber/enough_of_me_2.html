<!-- Enough of Me \ Part 2 -->

<p>"Oh, dear....she wasn't supposed to be back so soon."</p>

<p>Buffy and Giles were still staring in Willow's direction, mouths wide open.</p>

<p>"Rupert, if you would please?"  She motioned in Willow's direction.</p>

<p>"Get her and bring her in here.  We'll put her in her room for now.  Oh, dear...I told her to stay out until supper."</p>

<p>Giles tenderly tried to pick Willow up, the strain and awkwardness on his face apparent.  He couldn't figure out how to pick her up without being invasive about it.</p>

<p>"Giles, let me."  Buffy stepped in thankfully.  She gathered her best friend in her arms and carried her into the bedroom.  She placed her on the bed, careful not to jostle her.</p>

<p>"Hmm, well.  Someone in common, I see."  Giles directed the comment to no one in particular.</p>

<p>"Yes, well you see Rupert, Willow is my granddaughter.  And my granddaughter has been more distressed in the past two days than I've ever seen in her in her short life.  I'm afraid it has to do with the prophesy I was beginning to tell you about."</p>

<p>"She's a witch."  The comment came from Buffy.</p>

<p>"I know, dear.  It's in her blood."</p>

<p>"Well, that makes sense.  She's harnessed some real power in the past few years, but it's quite difficult at times for her to control it. If she has even the smallest amount of your power in her, then....."  Giles added.</p>

<p>"Yes, well.  Shall we, Rupert?  I'd like to finish the story."</p>

<p>"Giles, if it's all the same to you, I think I'll..."</p>

<p>"Of course, Buffy.  Stay here with Willow.  I'll fill you in later."</p>

<p>Buffy offered them both a smile as they walked out and shut the door.  Her attention was then drawn to the now-stirring form beside her.  Willow.  Their parting words back at the dorm were now pushing their way forward, as were other images......silky hair... the sunrise they shared.....her face in the moonlight.....her back as she walked out the door.</p>

<p>"Grummph....mrumph...."</p>

<p>"Again Will, almost, but not quite human."  Buffy smiled down at her friend.</p>

<p>"Buffy......what are you.....where's Nana?"  Willow reached up and rubbed the  back of her head.</p>

<p>"She's in the other room with Giles."  Buffy began to get up off the bed, "I'll go get her if you want..."  Willow reached out and stopped her.</p>

<p>"No, that's OK....I.....Buffy, why are you and Giles here?"</p>

<p>"Your grandmother and Giles apparently know each other....She called Giles and asked him if we'd come here....she said that we all had someone in common that she was concerned about."</p>

<p>"Oh...that would be me.  I told Nana not to worry, she shouldn't have called you here."</p>

<p>"Oh yes I should have dear."  The voice came from the now opened bedroom door.  "There were a few things I had to discuss with Rupert....and I thought Buffy could keep you company.  Seems to me like you needed it."</p>

<p>"Nana, how do you know Giles and Buffy?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the woman.  Willow didn't know she was a watcher.  That much was apparent by the expression on her face.</p>

<p>"I'll explain everything over dinner, Willow.  For now, why don't you take Buffy downstairs to the den? Rupert and I aren't quite done yet."</p>

<p>"OK, Nana...but I want to know everything later.  Promise?"</p>

<p>Nana agreed and Willow got up and led Buffy downstairs to the den.  After getting a few sodas, Buffy settled down on the couch and Willow sat in the overstuffed chair...at the other end of the room.  They sat in awkward silence until Buffy decided to speak up.</p>

<p>"So, Will, I....."</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about it, Buffy."</p>

<p>Buffy shot her a look.  "Why not, Will?  What's going on with you?  You are the last person I thought would run away from their problems.  And this is my problem, too...whatever it is...I don't even know if there is a problem....'cause you won't talk to me."</p>

<p>Willow sat there...studying her hands intently.  She didn't know what to say, or how to say it.  She was afraid that Buffy would never forgive her.</p>

<p>"I'm scared, Buffy......I can't....I don't want to lose you as my friend...I did something.. it goes wrong....I just missed Oz so much......and I know you miss Angel....I can't do anything right....I did a spell..."</p>

<p>"And you think it didn't work, but it did."  Nana was on the stairs, listening.</p>

<p>"Nana....yes...I..."</p>

<p>"It was a spell to have your true love reveal itself to you?  A few devotions, some well placed motherwort....am I close?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but how?"</p>

<p>"Come on, you two....looks like I have a lot of explaining to do.."</p>

<hr>

<p>Two hours later, they were eating dessert and Nana was completing her story.  "So I never told you I was a watcher, I thought it would be for the best.  Especially since I knew how close I'd put you to the active slayer, on purpose.  I sent your mother and father, newly married, to Sunnydale...and let fate take it's course at that point.  I new the slayer was a long time coming, and so were you.  Two years later, you were born.  You had a little patch of red hair on your head, the mark of a natural witch in our family, and I knew the prophesy was coming true.  Didn't you ever wonder why you looked more like me than your mother?  It skips a generation, the power we possess."</p>

<p>She got up to refill her cup and left them to absorb all of the information she'd just given them.</p>

<p>"Buffy was born several months before you, in L.A, two years after the Hellmouth there had been closed.  She wasn't chosen yet, as I remember it, she was called while she was a freshman in High School and the watcher...."</p>

<p>"Was Merrick," Buffy remembered.</p>

<p>"Yes, good man he was.  Now, the prophesy was this:  A Slayer would be born unto this world, a Slayer like no other.  She would bring balance to the forces of good and evil. She is, as we know now, Buffy.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't know who Buffy was, I only knew she would be called late, without any formal training, and that she'd wind up in Sunnydale....just as a new Hellmouth was forming."</p>

<p>"Nana, how could you keep all of this from me?  I told you everything about us...I always wondered why you believed me so easily...you never questioned me about the vampires or demons or the research I did for Giles...."</p>

<p>"It simply wasn't time yet, dear.  And as to your next question, yes, your parents are well aware of what goes on in that town, and how involved you are.  They knew since you were born that you were meant for bigger things than they could ever imagine.  They're away at the most convenient times, aren't they?"  She looked at her granddaughter and smiled a knowing smile.  "When you two became friends, I couldn't have been   happier.  I thought the Slayer would have a better chance at fulfilling the prophesy if she had a natural-born witch as her sidekick..."</p>

<p>"Natural-born.....Nana...you're a witch?"  Willow had just picked up on what she was getting to.</p>

<p>"Yes dear, natural-born.  As I said, it skips a generation, which explains why your mother doesn't have any viable power.  She has some....but it's not as fine tuned as ours is."  She gave her granddaughter a chance to swallow this last bit of information. "In fulfillment of the prophesy, the Slayer was to join forces with her true love, and together they were to close the Hellmouth for good."</p>

<p>"Angel."  Buffy's voice was barely above a whisper, yet they all heard it.</p>

<p>"Angelus?  Hmm...one would think so.  When I had the Codex placed in his hands, he was supposed to deliver it immediately, yet he hesitated."  She was looking at Buffy.  "That hesitation cost you your life, literally."  Her gaze shifted to Giles.  "And  your hesitation also.  Not telling her came at a very high price.  But, as for being your true love, only you can answer that Buffy.  The Hellmouth is closed, yes.....but is it for good?"</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Margaret, we did everything we were supposed to.  She faced the master, and she died.  As far as we know, the Hellmouth hasn't seen any activity since."</p>

<p>"As far as you know, Rupert...as far as we all know.  But can you be sure?"</p>

<p>"Then Angel wasn't her true love?"  Willow spoke the words Buffy was afraid to form.</p>

<p>"As I said before, only Buffy can answer that."</p>

<p>They were all lost in thought.  Each reliving the time the Hellmouth opened and Buffy died at the hands of the Master.  After a few minutes, Nana cut the silence.</p>

<p>"What do you say we all retire for the evening?  We can continue our talk tomorrow morning.  I'm sure it'll keep."  They all agreed.  "Rupert, of course, can have the other spare room.  I'm sure you two wouldn't mind staying in the same room." Before anyone could object, Nana went off to retrieve some extra blankets, taking Willow's hand in the process.</p>

<p>"Nana, I don't think..."</p>

<p>"Why do you think the spell didn't work, Willow?"  Nana cut in.</p>

<p>"I...well....Oz didn't come back...and neither did Angel.....I have a hard time with
getting my spells right....and....well, they don't always go exactly as planned."  Willow gave her an impish grin.  "Just last week I made Giles blind and Xander a demon magnet."   She gave a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>Nana gave a little chuckle. "You'll get the hang of it dear.  Practice makes perfect you know.  As for your love spell...it was meant to have your true love reveal itself to you, wasn't it?"  Willow nodded her head in agreement.  "Well, seems to me that you just need to look for a sign that it worked.  As witches, we're always aware of nature and all the beauty it holds.  A bird singing in a tree, a crashing ocean, a magnificent sunrise...."</p>

<p>"A sunrise?....I...uh...."  Willow gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes,  most times, you'll find that nature will answer your questions, but you have to have your ears open and be ready for the answer, even if it's the one you weren't quite expecting.  Now go, off to bed with you....I'm sure your friend is quite exhausted from her trip."  Nana kissed her good night and sent Willow on her way.</p>

<p>This was a lot of information for Willow to digest all at once.  She made her way to her bedroom, unsure of what she was going to say to Buffy.  She walked in and realized that the conversation would have to keep for now.  The Slayer was fast asleep in bed.  Silently, she walked over to where she was laying and sat down next to her.</p>

<p>&lt;Buffy.  Now what are we gonna do?&gt;</p>

<p>"Hmm?  Don't know, Will.  What?"</p>

<p>&lt;What?&gt;  "What?"  Willow squeaked.</p>

<p>"Will?  What happened?  What's wrong?"  Buffy sat up.</p>

<p>&lt;Buffy. . .say green. Green, green, green, green, green. . .&gt;</p>

<p>"Green!  What?  Wait......what the hell?"</p>

<p>They both looked at each other.  It couldn't be, could it?  Buffy could read her mind. This little trip to Nana's was getting more and more interesting.</p>

<p>"Buffy...you...you read my mind...I don't understand.....it takes years to....I've read about it but...."</p>

<p>"Well, this is certainly an interesting twist to our already twisted relationship."  The words rolled off Buffy's tongue.  She didn't even think about what she'd said before it was too late.  "Oh, Will, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...."</p>

<p>"No, it's alright.  I deserved it, I guess.  I haven't exactly been Miss Fun-to-be-Around."</p>

<p>"No, Will....you don't deserve it.....I've been so worried about you.  I.."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly Buffy, of course I would have come back, I just needed time to.."  She saw the look of shock on Buffy's face, "...uh, yeah....I just read your mind and this is REALLY starting to freak me out!"</p>

<p>They didn't know what to do.  Willow supposed that this had something to do with the prophesy, but what, she wasn't sure.  "OK, there's only one way to approach this..."</p>

<p>"Research."  Buffy added.</p>

<p>"Ugh....this mind reading thing is gonna take a lot of getting used to.  Let's research for a while and see where it takes us.  It's only 11 o'clock.  If we don't find anything by 12:30, I say we hit the sack and talk to Nana tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Why don't we skip the research and go straight to the source tomorrow, Will?  I mean why spend hours trying to find something that your grandmother might already know about?"  I can think of other ways to spend our time. . .</p>

<p>"Buffy!  You said that on purpose, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Just checking to see if you're on your toes."  Buffy gave her an all-too-innocent smile.  This mind reading thing might not be such a bad thing after all. . .</p>

<p>"Yes it is, Buffy.  Don't you remember what happened the last time you were able to read minds?  You almost went crazy...." Willow gave her a reprimanding look.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but on the plus side, I saved Jonathan.  Besides, this is different. And if I go crazy, at least I'll have someone along for company."</p>

<p>"You are incorrigible, you know that?"  Willow smiled at her friend.</p>

<p>"God, Will, I thought I'd never be able to do that again."</p>

<p>Willow cocked her head to the side, trying to figure out what Buffy meant, but her mind wasn't giving any hints this time. "What?"</p>

<p>"Make you smile."  Buffy looked at her seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh.  You could always do that Buffy.  Even when things were so bad with Oz...and Xander with the fluke....you managed to make me smile."  Willow fell into a contemplative silence.</p>

<p>&lt;I could again, you know.  Make you smile.  If you'd just let me in and give me the chance.&gt;</p>

<p>She looked up at the Slayer who had now put her hand on Willow's.</p>

<p>&lt;I know.  It's like I'm on the edge of something and I'm afraid that if I make the wrong choice then we'll never be the same again.  Any of us.&gt; Willow squeezed her hand.</p>

<p>&lt;Don't I get a choice in this, Will?  It's my life too you know.&gt;</p>

<p>"Mmm, I know Buffy, it's just that...."</p>

<p>Buffy edged closer to her...slowly, tentatively.  Not sure what her reaction would be.</p>

<p>&lt;I can't think with her this close to me.&gt;</p>

<p>"I know, Will.  That's the point."  Buffy offered a seductive smile.</p>

<p>"Ack, no...we can't...I mean..this is my grandmother's house, Buffy.  Isn't it like illegal or something to have sex in your grandmother's house?"</p>

<p>"What I'm thinking about is probably illegal in at least thirteen states....does that mean you'd do it if we weren't in your grandmother's house, Will?"</p>

<p>"Yes..No! I mean....ugh, I can't think straight."</p>

<p>&lt;Well, that's one way of putting it.&gt;</p>

<p>"Buffy!"</p>

<p>"OK, I'll be good.  On the premise that we're at your grandmother's house. Neutral territory.  Now, if we were anywhere else..."</p>

<p>"Don't finish that thought."  Willow put her finger on the Slayer's lips.  "I'm beat.  Let's get some sleep and tackle the world-saving stuff tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I'm kinda beat myself...OK, sleepy time!  And if you steal the covers this time I'll....have to do something horribly wrong to you."  They snuggled down into the bed.</p>

<p>&lt;You wouldn't.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;You're right.&gt;</p>

<hr>

<p>~~You know what to do.~~~</p>

<p>~~What?  Who are you?  Where are you?~~~</p>

<p>~~It's not important.  What's important is this:  You know what to do.  All you have to do is listen to your heart, and you'll know.~~</p>

<p>~~Know what?  Who are you talking about?~~</p>

<p>~~You love her, don't you?~~</p>

<p>~~ But I'm scared.  I'm not exactly an expert on matters of the heart.~~~</p>

<p>~~But do you love her?  Do you love her with everything you have to offer, and then more besides?~~</p>

<p>~~Yes.  Yes I do.~~</p>

<p>~~Then you know what to do, you know how to heal her and make her whole again.~~</p>

<p>~~But I don't.  I don't have the first clue about what she needs...~~</p>

<p>~~That's nonsense.  It's all there inside of you.  You both made a good start, now you've been sidetracked.  Break it down to basics.  Show her-give her--everything.~~</p>

<p>~~But she deserves so much more.  I feel like I just can't give her enough. Am I enough for her?  Hello?  Hello?  Where'd you go?~~</p>

<p>"Wake up sleepy head."  Willow was gently tugging on Buffy shirt, trying for the past ten minutes to get her up.  "God, Buffy, you sleep like the dead.  I'm glad I don't have to get you up for classes every morning."</p>

<p>"Mmm, wha...ugh...Will...Grrrr."</p>

<p>"And you said I didn't sound human in the morning.  Come on, get up.  Nana made pancakes and left them in the microwave.  She and Giles went out early this morning and left a note."  The Slayer wasn't budging.  "Come on, Buffy....I'm starving!"</p>

<p>"All right, all right.  Take it easy there, Red.  Geez, you'd think I'd be able to sleep in on winter break at least."  You are way too chipper in the morning, Will. </p>

<p>"I'm not way too chipper, and it's noon.  You've slept practically the whole day away. Now come on, or I'll eat all the pancakes myself."  With that, Willow walked out the door.</p>

<p>Buffy hardly thought she was kidding.  After a quick trip to the bathroom, Buffy padded her way into the kitchen.  Willow's back was to her and she was pouring two mugs of coffee.  Buffy snuck up behind her and wrapped her arms around the redhead's waist.</p>

<p>"Mmm...good morning."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, you mean.  Do you always sleep that sound?  It took me ten minutes to get any kind of sound out of you."  Willow glanced behind her.   God, she's thisclose. </p>

<p>You smell good.  "Yeah, mom swore she was gonna hire the school band to wake me up in the morning.  I told her I'd just buy earmuffs."  I'd probably be more inclined to wake up every morning if I could wake up next to you. . .</p>

<p>"Buffy...." Stop that. </p>

<p>It's true, Will.  I think the last time I slept so well was about a week ago. . .</p>

<p>"OK, how about some coffee?"  Willow wiggled away from Buffy's grasp and set the two mugs on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>"Oooh, pancakes.  Even better, grandmother pancakes.  If these are anything like my grandmother's pancakes then you'd better dig in before I finish them all."</p>

<p>Willow threw Buffy a questioning glance.  Now that was too easy. </p>

<p>Buffy looked up and smiled.  I'm not through with you yet, Red.</p>

<p>They ate breakfast in compatible silence.  Except for the little scuffle over the day's comics, things went smoothly.  The note Nana left said that she and Giles would be gone most of the day and would be back after supper.  She left some money and advised the girls to order out and then maybe rent some movies.  Buffy hadn't finished eating yet, so Willow excused herself and went back to her room to change.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is nuts.  There has to be some sort of law or something against it. I can't stop thinking about her.   Willow was almost dressed when she felt two hands creep up along her sides.  "Buffy....what are you doing?"  She was beginning to get nervous.</p>

<p>I can't stop thinking about you either, Will.  "I've missed you."</p>

<p>"I was only gone for two days."  She saw Buffy frown in the mirror.  "I missed you, too. I'm sorry I ran out like that." I didn't mean to hurt you.  Did I hurt you?..I mean..I didn't mean to be mean...I just needed time to myself. . .I. . .</p>

<p>You know, you're cute when you babble.  "I understand, Will.  We all need a breather sometimes." Buffy smiled at her.</p>

<p>Both of her hands rested on Willow's stomach.  She squeezed a little tighter, rubbing just above her belly button with her thumbs.  She saw Willow's eyes close and felt her breathing become irregular.  Lightly, she kissed her shoulder, then the nape of her neck. Her breathing increased also.   You feel so good. </p>

<p>So do you.  "Buffy, we can't.  Neutral territory, remember?" She gave the blonde a wide-eyed look in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Your grandmother and Giles are out....more than likely for the rest of the day and half the night doing...watchery things.  Technically..."</p>

<p>"It's still my grandmother's house.  It feels weird." But still. . .</p>

<p>Buffy got a hopeful look in her eyes then chuckled.  "Man, talk about thoughts and actions contradicting."</p>

<p>"Yeah....score one for inner turmoil." Willow dead-panned.</p>

<p>Buffy turned her around so that they were facing each other.  "I want to help you, Will. But I don't want to be the source of your inner turmoil.  Am I?"</p>

<p>Willow didn't answer and her mind didn't give anything away.</p>

<p>"OK, then.  Let me know when you're done so I can change too."  Buffy retreated for the door and reached for the knob.</p>

<p>"Buffy, wait." Don't go. </p>

<p>She turned around, only to come face to face with Willow.  "How did you....?" Buffy gave her a questioning look.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well....I'm not THAT bad of a witch..."  The comment was followed by her patented Willow-smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure you're not a bad witch.  More of a good witch, like Glenda." Buffy began to move away, only to be trapped by two hands placed firmly on the door. "Will, if you insist on looking at me like that you'd better have something to back it up with.  There's no guarantee I can control myself much lonmrunph...."</p>

<p>Willow broke the sentence with a kiss.  It was a tentative, not-sure-what-I'm-doing kiss. Light, lingering, soft.  All of a sudden, Buffy's world consisted of kissing Willow, and becoming good at it.  This was a great start.  Buffy pulled her closer, to close the gap between them.  Willow gasped a little and Buffy took it as an invitation to deepen the kiss.  Both of her hands went to the redhead's face, cupping it gently. Willow's hands lingered down to Buffy's sides, feeling her soft skin before wrapping her arms around the slayer's waist.  Before long, they found themselves on the floor, Buffy straddling her lover, her fingers intertwined in red hair, soft, velvety red hair.  They slowed the kissing, each not wanting to stop...both knowing they had to.</p>

<p>God, I thought I'd never be able to do this again.</p>

<p>Kiss. </p>

<p>Me either, I missed you so much.</p>

<p>Kiss, kiss. </p>

<p>Don't leave me again, Will....I couldn't take it.</p>

<p>Kiss. </p>

<p>I didn't want to. . .  "I just had some stuff I needed to work out.  Things got all jumbley....and I didn't know how to handle them."</p>

<p>"Like....things with Tara?"  Buffy was propped up on one elbow now, her right hand resting on Willows stomach.</p>

<p>"That....and Riley."  Willow looked away and found a fascinating piece of fuzz on the carpet.</p>

<p>"So you heard."</p>

<p>"I heard."  You kissed him.</p>

<p>"He kissed me, Will.  There's a difference.  At least I'd like to think so."</p>

<p>"Do you...I mean...would you?"</p>

<p>"No, to both.  I don't want to nor would I.  I think I've finally found what I've been looking for......here."  Buffy leaned down again and planted a light kiss on Willow's nose.</p>

<p>You're so sweet. </p>

<p>"Hey, I aim to please."  Buffy gave her a grin.</p>

<p>"Hmm...this mind reading thing could turn out to be a problem.  Don't you think it's a little...well...invasive."  Willow posed the question.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we've both managed to effectively block the other out when we really wanted to. I just think it's something that's going to take some getting  used to, that's all."</p>

<p>"Hey, I thought I was supposed to be the smart one?"  Willow gave a little pout.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well if you're so smart, why did it take you so long to kiss me?"</p>

<p>Willow scrunched up  her nose.  "Buffy...I was scared....I....." You don't understand.</p>

<p>"I do, Will, I'm sorry if that was harsh....I was only joking."  She leaned down and put her head on Willow's shoulder.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p> Will.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Come on, Will. </p>

<p>"It's just that.....when Oz left it was like....like I was split down the center and half of me was lost....I.....I never thought it could hurt so much.....I don't know if I could do that to myself again....to risk the hurt.....to love..." < again. . .like that</p>

<p>That's what I thought, too.</p>

<p>Angel.</p>

<p> Yeah.  "I'm sorry he left you.  And I'm sorry I couldn't stop it....stop you from hurting....stop you from having to see them together in the crypt, but if you're gonna feel better, then..."</p>

<p>"I have to let him go. I know, Buffy."  Willow shifted away and sat up to face her.  "How did you do it?  Get over Angel, I mean."</p>

<p>"Come on, Will, we all remember that one.  I ran.  I ran until I couldn't run anymore.  I couldn't face it.....I couldn't face you guys.  I felt like I'd failed." Buffy's face was stoic, she wasn't revealing any kind of expression.  "But, I got over it. Actually, I came back to Sunnydale and got over it.  That's when it started to feel better - the emptiness inside.  It was because of you....everyone else helped too...but it was you, Will. You didn't leave my side.  And I got through."  She smiled.  "Let me in, Will.  Let me help you."</p>

<p>They sat there facing each other.  Willow decided to try something she'd read on the internet.  She put on her concentration face and focused on reaching out to Buffy mentally.  She imagined her hand going out and tugging on the invisible string that was linking them together.</p>

<p>Ouch!  What was that?</p>

<p> Wow...I read about it being done but....I touched you...mentally.  That was cool. </p>

<p>Yeah, well...it felt like I just drank a slurpee too fast. . .can I try? </p>

<p>Willow nodded her head in agreement.  "Just concentrate on doing it and you will.  It's not that hard."</p>

<p>Buffy reached out, seeking to follow the link into Willow's mind.  Images flashed in front of her and she had to close her eyes to try and catch them all.  Grave markers....grass...it was dark out....trees....a large stone building.....Willow's hand reaching out and grabbing the door....she had something in her hands....down the stairs...bars...Oz and Veruca...naked....the bag and thermos dropped and Oz jumped up....</p>

<p>{"Willow..." He starts putting on his pants.</p>

<p>"Oh, my god. Oh, my god."</p>

<p>"I know what you saw. It wasn't..." Finishes putting on his pants.  "I had to.   I had to lock her in there with me."</p>

<p>"I bet." She hugs herself.</p>

<p>"She's like me. A wolf."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew you two had a lot in common, but..." Oz tries to touch her. "Don't touch me!" She jerks back.</p>

<p>"She was gonna hurt somebody. I didn't have a choice."</p>

<p>"But you did. You could've told somebody. Your solution... Just put you two together in a room all night?"</p>

<p>Having woken up, Veruca stands up bearing all.  "Girl's got a point."</p>

<p>Oz turns to her angrily.  "Leave."</p>

<p>Veruca puts her hands up in protest.  "I'm just saying..."</p>

<p>Oz screams at her.  "Now!"  He turns back to Willow.  "I'm sorry. I know."</p>

<p>"I knew, you jerk. And you sat there, and you told me everything was fine?" She was crying now.  "And that's as bad as... As...."</p>

<p>"I know how it feels. I remember."</p>

<p>"Oh. So what, this is payback? I had this coming?"</p>

<p>"No. It's not...."</p>

<p>"Because I thought that was behind us. And you know, what happened with Xander, it doesn't compare. Not with what you and I had. Not with whatever you've been doing with her."</p>

<p>"I don't know what Veruca and I have done. When I change, it's like, it's like I'm gone and the wolf takes over."</p>

<p>"But before this, when you were regular Oz, you had feelings for her, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No. I could sense something, but....."</p>

<p>"But you wanted her... Like in an animal way? Like...More than you wanted me?"  She runs off crying....</p>

<p>"Willow!"}</p>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes....the tears streaming silently down her face.  She felt it...felt everything Willow felt when she found Oz....the love in her heart as she opened the crypt...the shock at seeing him there naked with Veruca...the pain when she thought he was comparing it to Xander.....she felt all of it.</p>

<p>"Will....I didn't know...."</p>

<p>"Yeah.....it was pretty intense."  Tears welled up in her eyes and threatened to spill over.</p>

<p>"I felt....God, I felt it all.  Everything you were feeling...it's like...it's like I was you. Like it was happening to me...."</p>

<p>"I see you girls have been doing some research while we were gone."  Nana was standing in the doorway.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Nana..." Willow squeaked out.  She got up from the floor and ran over to her.   Nana enveloped her in her arms.  She was sobbing now.  Nana just stood there, holding her, smoothing her hair making grandmother comfort noises.  Giles stood a few steps behind, taking in the scene before him.  He took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose and looked over at Buffy as if to say 'are you alright?'  Buffy gave him a smile, got up and walked over to him, leaving Nana and Willow alone.  They walked down the hallway to the kitchen.  Automatically, Buffy put some water on for tea.</p>

<p>"She's worse off than you thought, isn't she?  Over Oz, I mean."</p>

<p>"She's broken, Giles.  And I don't know how to fix her."  Buffy let out the breath she wasn't aware of holding.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I'm afraid it has to do with a lot more than Oz.  The prophesy Margaret was speaking of last night...well, Willow is an integral part of it.  It's her destiny, I'm afraid, and yours."</p>

<p>"Pesky prophesies...."  Buffy rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this is quite serious, Buffy."</p>

<p>"Sorry.  So what are we facing this time?"</p>

<p>"Margaret and I went to visit an old friend of the council's.  He's a shapeshifting demon that's worked with the council since its very early days.  As a watcher in training, I actually studied with him extensively.  This demon is the keeper of all the older, more fragile texts.  It's amazing really, some of them are actually written on cured animal skin in a language that's long since forgotten, if I had the time...."</p>

<p>"Giles...the prophesy?"  Buffy could see his tangent was headed into the realm of Watcher-Giles and his love of books.</p>

<p>"Yes, well....more specifically, he keeps watch over the older prophesies that haven't come to pass yet....the prophesies that were predicted over a millennia ago.  This is, as it turns out, one of those prophesies.  The research Margaret did pinpointed the Slayer to bring the balance, but the prophesy was written sometime in the year 876 by a man named Myrddin. He lived in what was then a Cymric borderland near the Solway Firth in Europe. This is where the council first began to take shape.  Myrddin was, by all rights, the first Watcher."  Giles could see Buffy's eyes begin to glaze over.</p>

<p>"If you translate the name Myrddin from it's traditional Latin you get, quite specifically, Merlin."</p>

<p>Buffy pereed up.  "Merlin?  As in King Arthur, Knights of the Roundtable and Excalibur Merlin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite right......You see, he predicted that Guinevere would betray Arthur and have an affair, but Arthur didn't listen and married her anyway.  Arthur's brother found her and Sir Lancelot in the King's bedchambers and made the affair public knowledge, there in sealing the fate of Guinevere and Sir Lancelot.  He called for her to be burned at the stake for adultery.  Anyway, those events seem to shadow the events that now must come to pass.  Had Arthur listened to Merlin, he would have never married Guinevere, she would have never had an affair that led to a war and consequently Arthur never would have been mortally wounded in that war.  The prophesy we face is this:  You are to come against a great demon, possibly Arthur reincarnate himself.  In order to win the battle, you must face down the demon working along side your soul mate and equal.  This is to be a person of great value when the battle commences.  We are headed into a mystical convergence and the demon is coming to seek revenge on the friend that betrayed him and the love he lost. In essence, Margaret and I think that Arthur is coming to fight Sir Lancelot to the death.  A sort of re-creation of what was supposed to be had he not been mortally wounded in battle."</p>

<p>"So Guinevere was Sir Lancelot's soul mate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes she was.  Merlin alluded to as much when he cautioned Arthur against marrying her.  The prophesy is to be fulfilled exactly 1123 years after the death of Arthur, on the night of the full moon.  Before the dawn of a new Millennia."</p>

<p>"But Giles, that's.....that's...wait a second.....1123 plus 876...carry the 1...."</p>

<p>"The night of the full moon is two days before Christmas.  A week from today, to be exact."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Rupert.  Looks like you have your work cut out for you."  Nana and Willow were standing in the doorway.  "This is as far as I go on this journey, I'm afraid.  I'm old and would only be a hindrance.  I've filled Willow in on the prophesy and she is, as always, going to help Buffy in any way she can.  Now, what do you say we leave this alone for tonight, hmm?  It's still early and I think we could all use some fun." They all agreed and decided to go out to dinner and a movie.  The rest of the night was uneventful and they all turned in early.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Morning, Giles."  Willow walked into the kitchen where Giles was reading the morning paper and having tea.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Willow.  I trust you slept well?"  Giles gave her a smile.</p>

<p>"As well as I could considering that Buffy stole the covers....again."</p>

<p>"I did not.  You're the cover-hog, missy.  I woke up in the middle of the night and I thought my toes were gonna break off from frost-bite!"  Buffy joined them in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Whiner.</p>

<p>Am not.</p>

<p>Are too.</p>

<p>Am not!</p>

<p>"As much as I'd love to bear witness to your silent battle of wills, I believe we have more pressing matters ahead of us.  We need to leave this afternoon and meet with Myrddin.  He met us at a little bed and breakfast just outside of town yesterday, but today we will be traveling to his estate."</p>

<p>"Oh goody, road trip!"  Buffy bounced up and down.</p>

<p>"Yes, well.  I took the liberty of getting you both passports.  We should be there by nightfall if all goes according to plan."</p>

<p>Buffy gave him a questioning look.  "Where's there, Giles?"</p>

<p>"Canada, Medicine Hat to be exact.  We'll take a private plane this afternoon and land at Myrddin's chalet around dinner time."</p>

<p>"Medicine Hat?  You've got to be kidding."  Buffy gave him a look of disbelief.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Buffy, it's a real place."  Giles looked at her through the top of his glasses.</p>
