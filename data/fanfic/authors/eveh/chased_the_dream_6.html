<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Six -->

<p>The only thing I wish for all my students is happiness. The same
holds true for Dinah and Helena. I only wish them happiness. I can
take them only so far they have to take those big leaps in life
alone. Well, in their case they've decided to take the big leaps
alone together.</p>
<p>I know Helena wants to ask me about how I feel about her relationship
with Dinah. I think she ultimately wants approval from me, and it's
terribly difficult for me to admit this, but I won't give it. It's
not that I don't support their relationship, because I've seen the
changes come over them both and I know that they have all been
positive, but I want Helena to not want my approval about this. I
want her to break away and take her stand and remain strong on this
one thing that I hope and wish she will fight for. I want her to look
at the relationship she has with Dinah and not care what I think. I
only want her to care about her own happiness.</p>
<p>I support this change in her life. I've supported most changes in her
life. How could I not? When I see how far she has come I am left in
awe. I know that I can't take away the pain that her mother's death
has caused her-- that was never my purpose in her life-- my part was
to only help guide her through the tough times and keep her alive
until someone who could open her heart up again came along.</p>
<p>I know my place in her life and that has always been to be her mentor
and friend. I love her. I love her just like I've grown to love
Dinah. These two young ladies are my family and I love my family. I
will do whatever is within my power to keep them safe and give them
some form of happiness.</p>
<p>I'm the big bad Oracle and my job is to keep them safe. Helena just
thinks I'm on a superhero, altruistic high that I just do the crime
fighting because it's the right thing to do, and that is kind of
true. It's also true that I do what I do for very selfish reasons. Of
course I want to keep the city safe but I also want to take all those
bastards who decide to ruin peoples lives off the street so that my
family will be safe.</p>
<p>It probably sounds weird especially since I send my family out every
night to confront those bastards head on. I put my girls in danger
knowingly. I understand something about reality, however, that I'm
not too sure everyone gets. Locking Helena and Dinah away in a room
doesn't guarantee them a long and happy life. It guarantees them
nothing and it guarantees me nothing, but by getting them out there
and fighting for their own happiness...that will get them somewhere.
Even if they get hurt-- and I always feel guilty when they get hurt--
I'll have given them something to hold onto in their lives. They'll
be able to sit back and say that they did something in this world to
gain their happiness. They chased their own dreams and conquered
them.</p>
<p>I wish I could still be out there standing with them conquering all
our dreams, but I am Oracle now. I see all and know all. I am
supposed to know the past, present and future and amazingly enough I
actually do. I know my own past. I know my own present and I know
that the future will be a better place because Huntress and Canary
wish it so.</p>
<p>"Uh...Barbara?" Helena calls from my doorway. "Can I talk to you for a
second?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I take my attention away from the papers I'm supposed to
be grading and give it to her. "What do you need? And where's Dinah?"</p>
<p>"A friend called for her and they went out," she points in the
general direction of where 'out' might be. "I'm meeting up with her
later for sweeps. I kind of wanted to talk to you."</p>
<p>She's nervous and I already know what this conversation is going to
be about. She's finally gathered her courage and is ready to accept
whatever it is I say to her. I know she'd eventually come around.</p>
<p>"So what do you want to talk about? Are you still worried about our
mystery lizard lady?" Ever since Dinah's encounter with our reptilian
foe Helena has been kind of on edge. We all have been actually. No
more deaths have occurred, but she's still out there so we still are
going to have to find her.</p>
<p>Helena crosses her arms in front of her. She's hugging herself. "Well
yeah that still does kind of bother me but I know we'll get her
eventually. I mean you're working on it, right? So it's all good."</p>
<p>I smirk and nod. "Yeah sure. So what is it you wanted to talk about?"</p>
<p>"Dinah?"</p>
<p>"Is that a question?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head so fast I'm afraid it might fall off. "No...no not
at all. I want to talk about Dinah, Dinah and me actually. Well
really about Dinah and me and you."</p>
<p>"I'm not into that sort of thing," I try to lighten the mood. "And I
love you both dearly but you're just not my type."</p>
<p>Helena looks at me confused then that confusion turns to surprise
then finally I get that grin I was after. "I'm not too good at
sharing."</p>
<p>"Well I don't want you to share." We smile at each other and the
cloud of tension that Helena brought in the room with her fades a
little. "So what about you and Dinah...and me?"</p>
<p>She sighs then throws her hands up in the air as if she has made some
great decision, which she probably has. "Do you care about it?"</p>
<p>"Do I care?"</p>
<p>"Yeah do you care? Do you have a problem with it? You for it? Against
it? What?"</p>
<p>"Are you happy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah...?" She answers uncertainly.</p>
<p>"Is Dinah happy?"</p>
<p>"As far as I know. I hope she is."</p>
<p>"Then tell me Helena, what does it matter what I think?"</p>
<p>"Because you're you. It matters."</p>
<p>"If I said I didn't approve would you love Dinah any less?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head.</p>
<p>"If I said that I don't want you ever seeing her again, would you
listen?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head again.</p>
<p>"Then what does it matter?"</p>
<p>She drops her shoulders defeated. "I don't know. It doesn't change
anything but you...well you're really damn important to Dinah and me
and we want you to support us."</p>
<p>"Dinah already knows how I feel." And she does. We've never talked
about it but I know she knows.</p>
<p>Helena stares at me for a while then finally just decides to provoke
more of an answer out of me. "And how you feel is..."</p>
<p>I look at my lap for a moment gathering my thoughts then capture her
gaze again. "I feel that you deserve happiness and I'm very happy
that you've found it."</p>
<p>"So is that your way of saying that you approve?"</p>
<p>"Well I don't necessarily disapprove," Helena smiles and is about to
say something but I hold out my hand to forestall her speech, "But I
want you to understand that Dinah is young and you both don't have a
lot of experience so be careful with each other. And I also would
like you to understand that when you're out being Canary and Huntress
you can't let personal feelings get in the way," those are easier
words to say than they are to live by, "you should also know that
your relationship with Dinah may not last, but your partnership has
to."</p>
<p>Helena's face falls and she gets that introspective look on her face
that comes along when she really has to think about something. I know
she's been living in the haze of new love and I don't want to bring
her out of it so soon, but she needs to know.</p>
<p>"But I love her." She sounds like she's pleading with me to tell her
that this fairy tale love story she has will last until the world
ends, but I can't do that. I wish that for her. I wish that for them
both, but I can't do that.</p>
<p>"Life isn't like the songs, Helena. Love's important. Loving her is
very important and it'll get you a long way, but you need more than
love. You need commitment, honesty, openness, trust...Helena you just
need a lot of things to make sure that this lasts. Ultimately, love
can only take you so far. You and Dinah can only get to happily ever
after if that's what you truly desire and are willing to work for,
because Helena it won't be easy. You both lead dangerous lives. Dinah
is growing up and soon she might want to go away to school. There are
just so many things that you'll have to work around and work through."</p>
<p>"But I love her." She tells me again with more steel in her voice. "I
love her and I'm not going to let go and I won't let her let go
either. We're going to be together because that's just the way it has
to be. Even if something happens..." Her voice trails off and she looks
away, "If something happens to her then we'll always be together. So
I don't care what you say and I know it'll be hard. When hasn't it
been? No matter what we'll make it."</p>
<p>I look at her and I expect her to turn away from me but she doesn't.
She doesn't back down. "In that case then I fully support your
relationship with Dinah."</p>
<p>"Well good then."</p>
<p>We continue to stare at each other again. Her body is tense and I
think she's in need of release. She's been tense ever since she's
entered this room and our conversation had done nothing to ease up
her disposition. I don't know what else I should tell her. She's in
her relationship with Dinah for all the right reasons and there's no
circumstance in which I would not support them. They will always have
my support.</p>
<p>The Delphi alert sounds and I can only hope that this will be
Helena's chance to get some of her stress out. We're all in need of
some relief right now. The week has been...if nothing else complicated.</p>
<p>Helena and I make our way to Oracle's work area. I check out the
alarm and see that this time it's Dinah searching for me instead of
Reese. I'd be surprised if it were Reese though; he's still in the
hospital.</p>
<p>"Canary you need something?" I ask calmly. I know Helena is already
worried even though she hasn't said anything aloud yet.</p>
<p>"You could say that," Dinah's voice filters into the room.</p>
<p>"Well...?"</p>
<p>"I seem to be having a slight problem." She responds. "I'm uh...well...
I'm stuck."</p>
<p>"Stuck?" Helena and I ask together.</p>
<p>"Yes I'm stuck."</p>
<p>"Stuck where?" Helena and I ask in sync once again.</p>
<p>"A window." She responds softly. "At a bar."</p>
<p>"A window?" Helena and I say together once again except this time I
give her a look that clearly conveys my need for her to remain silent.</p>
<p>"Okay Dinah." I sigh softly. "Exactly what window at what bar are you
stuck in and why are you stuck in a window?"</p>
<p>"Does it really matter? Can't you just send Helena over here and get
her to get me off. I'm at that bar that's down the street from
Gibson's."</p>
<p>"You want me to send Helena over to get you off?" I ask not even
trying to hide the smirk that come over my face.</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm very uncomfortable and...Oracle this is so not the time to be
making jokes." I turn to Helena and she nods her head and is gone
within seconds.</p>
<p>"Helena is on her way." I tell her and can easily hear the sigh of
relief Dinah gives. "So do you want to tell me how you got stuck in
the window? You've got a good five minutes until Helena gets there."</p>
<p>"I was trying to escape through the bathroom window." She answers as
if it should be blatantly obvious to me.</p>
<p>"Oh...so why are you trying to escape?"</p>
<p>"Because that guy's not taking no for an answer."</p>
<p>"What guy?"</p>
<p>"The guy that Amber's trying to hook me up with."</p>
<p>I guess we're going to have to play twenty questions. "Who's Amber
and why is she trying to hook you up with a guy and why don't you
just tell her you're with someone else?"</p>
<p>"Amber's that girl from school who's in my English class. You've met
her. And I have told her I'm with someone else but she says I need to
explore all my horizons."</p>
<p>"Okay. So why did you agree to meet with her tonight if you knew that
she was trying to hook you up with someone?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know."</p>
<p>"So when you figured out that she was hooking you up with someone
else why didn't you just leave."</p>
<p>She's silent for a long time then eventually sighs. "That probably
would have been a better thing to do then trying to escape through
the bathroom window."</p>
<p>"Yes it would have been."</p>
<p>"I don't need you yelling at me, once Helena gets here I'm sure I'll
be hearing enough from her."</p>
<p>"Fine. You won't hear anything else from me about trying to run away
from your friends by going out a bathroom window. But I do have
another question for you."</p>
<p>I know she's thinking about telling me that I can't ask it, but she's
not that brave yet. "What?" She snaps.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you doing in a bar?"</p>
<p>"Oh hey Helena's here now, I think I should probably go." She
switches off her comm. set and I curse the day when Helena taught her
how to do that. Fortunately however, Helena still has her set on and
I can still hear what's going on. I choose to remain silent so that
Helena doesn't turn off hers as well. It really doesn't matter what
they say though, Dinah is still going to be grounded.</p>
<p>"Damn, how'd you ever get in that position?" I hear Helena ask.</p>
<p>I can only catch the last part of Dinah's answer which sounds a
little something like, "talent to bend this way."</p>
<p>To which Helena replies, "How do you know I can't?"</p>
<p>I really don't want to listen in on this. "Helena just get her the
hell out of there and back here."</p>
<p>"Fine. We'll be back in a few." Then Helena shuts me out too. I
should really give them new comm. sets that can't be turned off. That
would probably solve the problem I have of them shutting me out. I
don't like them shutting me out.</p>
<p>Yeah I'm going to give them some new comm. sets. They better be back
here within the hour. Dinah needs to be talked to about going out to
bars and turning off her comm. set. I can still at least try to
control her bad habits. She may be in a relationship with Helena but
I refuse to let her assimilate all of Helena's bad habits. She's
supposed to be the good one. She's supposed to make Helena more
responsible. She's the good influence. It's really not supposed to be
the other way around. I don't know if I could handle two Helena's.
Lord help me if I ever have to handle two Helena's.</p>
