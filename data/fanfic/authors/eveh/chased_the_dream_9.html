<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Nine -->

<p>He never told us what she was doing there. I honestly...well I expected
more from him. I thought that he'd at least tell us something. I
hoped that he would at least tell us something. I know he has a
problem with Dinah and I'm sure he's still a little bitter about what
happened between us, but I really expected him to say something to
us.</p>
<p>I know he cares for Dinah. Hell he fucking owes his life to her...but
he still didn't say anything. He kept silent. He hid information from
us that can actually get this bitch off of the streets and he's
asking me why I don't trust him? He comes up to me and asks if we can
ever truly be partners?</p>
<p>The answer is really quite simple. No. We could never be partners. We
especially can't be partners when he actually has to think about not
turning Dinah over to some freak who wants to do who the hell knows
what with her.</p>
<p>Does he think I'm blind? Does he think I can't see what's going on
with him? He's having some real meta envy going on and I don't have
the fucking time to deal with it. Barbara tells me to just let it go
and we should wait and see what he does. She still thinks that he has
a chance of actually doing the right thing. She's willing to risk it,
but I'm not.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to risk Dinah getting into that woman's hands. I'm
not willing to risk Reese's childish envy getting in the way of us
taking care of this thorn that has constantly been in our side. I
don't know what's going through the man's head and I don't know what
all that green atrocity said to him, but he better get is shit
together quick.</p>
<p>Does he even understand that she wants Dinah? And more importantly
does he not think that I noticed this from the first body we found
that had been poisoned? Of course I realized that all the victims
have looked like Dinah. I can pay attention just as good as the good
ole' detective. Does he not realize that the news has been playing
the same fucking sound byte that explains who the victims look like
over and over again?</p>
<p>Does he think that Dinah doesn't notice it?</p>
<p>We haven't talked about it. None of us have talked about it, not even
Barbara, but we all know what's going on here. We know who this
person is after we just don't know why. I'm afraid to learn what the
why is though. I don't want to know. I don't think Dinah wants to
know or Barbara wants to know either. We're all content with thinking
that we need to get our information on the psycho then go and kick
some ass.</p>
<p>I don't let Dinah go out alone anymore and Barbara gave her a comm.
set that can't be turned off. I walk her to school and I'm there to
pick her up. We do sweeps together and she's never out of my sight.</p>
<p>So, we haven't talked about it but we've adjusted around it. Dinah
doesn't complain because she knows we're only concerned, worried,
fucking terrified about her. A certain part of her has to be scared
too, or else it would be almost impossible to put such a tight watch
on her. Dinah's a free spirit, if she doesn't want to be tied down
then she won't be. That's something we have in common.</p>
<p>"Hey," Dinah calls to me from across her room. I don't know how she
knew I was there; I was actually trying to be quiet.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" I stroll into her room and fall down onto the
bed. She leans down and places a soft kiss on my forehead.</p>
<p>"I'm debating whether or not I should let you in on a secret?" She's
smirking at me and I suddenly get this fluttery feeling in my
stomach. I've only ever gotten this feeling with her.</p>
<p>"Well why wouldn't you want to tell me?" I lower my voice. "Did you
do something bad?"</p>
<p>Dinah shakes her head. "No," she draws out the word. "But I'm about
to."</p>
<p>This girl is going to drive me to my grave. She's still seventeen. We
only have a month left. Just one month, I can last a month. I
shouldn't ask. I know I shouldn't ask but, "What are you gonna do?"</p>
<p>"Well," Dinah maneuvers so that she's straddling my stomach. She
leans down and whispers into my ear, "I have a confession to make"
then plants a light kiss on my neck.</p>
<p>My mouth is suddenly dry. I wonder if Dinah would help me out with
that problem. I reach out and bring her lips towards mine and kiss
her with all the passion that is inside of me. I try to hold back but
it's impossible to do. When the kiss ends she's looking down at me
with such love and regret in her eyes that it frightens me.</p>
<p>"I really should have told you this earlier," she pulls away from me
but keeps her position on top of me. "But Reese and Barbara thought
it'd be better if you didn't know until they actually found something
out."</p>
<p>"Dinah, what are you talking about?" My voice is harder than I intend
it to be but I can't help it.</p>
<p>She places her hand on my chest and gently holds me down. "I'm only
telling you now because I think you should know and I want you to
know that I trust you, but you can't run off and do anything stupid."</p>
<p>I try to sit up but Dinah's hand is still on my chest holding me
down. "Dinah." I warn.</p>
<p>"Helena, I'm telling you this because I love you and I trust that you
won't do anything stupid."</p>
<p>"Just fucking tell me," this time she can't hold me down and I'm able
to sit up but I only manage to bring her closer to me. I wrap my arms
around her to prevent her from falling back and she places hers
around my neck. I look into her eyes and I know she's nervous so I
make a conscious effort to calm down. "Please just tell me?"</p>
<p>Her head drops for a moment then she's looking at me again. "Reece
told me about the crazy lizard lady coming to the police station that
night. He gave me the card to give Barbara and told me that I
probably shouldn't tell you until he had a chance to check things
out." I'm about to say something very not nice about Reese but she
covers my lips with her index finger. "He thinks she's really
dangerous, Helena. He didn't want you going after her blind and
Barbara agreed. They're still trying to find out where this lady is,
but I thought you should know."</p>
<p>"Do they have an idea of where she at least might be?"</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it, Helena. That's why they didn't want to
tell you."</p>
<p>How does she know what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking of anything,
except for going over to wherever this bitch might be and killing
her.</p>
<p>Dinah removes one arm from around my neck and grabs my chin. "I'm
serious Helena. When we know where she is and what she wants then
we'll go after her together. All of us."</p>
<p>"No we won't. I'm not going to let you within ten miles of that
woman."</p>
<p>"Baby," Dinah let's go of my chin and caresses by cheek. "I know
you're worried about me. It scares me too but we have to do this
together. We're a team and don't think that I'm going to let you go
after her on your own."</p>
<p>I sigh and drop my head into Dinah's chest. "Can I at least be pissed
at Barbara and Reese for not wanting to tell me?"</p>
<p>"I'd prefer you not to be, and I don't entirely agree with what they
wanted to do, but you should know their hearts were in the right
place."</p>
<p>I know they were. Still, they didn't trust me, and that kind of
hurts. They may have been right not to tell me but it still hurts.</p>
<p>"I'll try to keep that in mind as I'm yelling at them."</p>
<p>Dinah groans and forces my head back up so that I'm looking at
her. "You have every right to be upset. I would be too, but tell me
that they weren't right about you going all lone vigilante."</p>
<p>I open my mouth to deny it but I can't. "Don't let me get a hold of
where you think she might be. When Barbara and Reese have everything
settled tell me about it and we'll go after her." I'm honest enough
with myself to know that if I get my hands on where this bitch might
be then I'm going to go after her. I wouldn't even know how to try
and stop myself from doing it. I think Barbara once called it going
into a blind rage.</p>
<p>"As soon as I know something then I'll tell you. I told them to not
tell me anything else. I think it's better if I just face this lady
when I have something more to go on."</p>
<p>"Are you scared?" I run my hand through her soft blonde hair. "You
know I won't let her get to you."</p>
<p>"I have this woman killing all these people because of me..." Her voice
trails off and she looks towards the window. "Why me? What does she
want?"</p>
<p>I don't have an answer. As far as I know, none of us have an
answer. "I'm sorry, Dinah, I don't know."</p>
<p>There's tears falling from her eyes now, and it's clear to me just
how much this lady has gotten her worried. I wipe away all the tears
and make her face me again. "She's not going to lay one hand on you.
I swear it."</p>
<p>She nods then our gazes are once again locked. I lean up and meet her
lips. Our kiss is gentle. She brings her hands up to cover my face
and I pull her even closer to me. Her hair falls around us and covers
us both from the outside world.</p>
<p>She eases me back onto the mattress and her body is fully covering my
own. There's a voice in the back of my head warning me that I should
wait, but I'm tired of listening to that voice. I want to listen to
that other part of me now. The part that tells me that she's the most
important person in my life.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" She asks me when we pull back for
air. It's almost absurd that she's the one asking me this. I'm the
one that's supposed to be asking her if she's ready. I should be
asking if she's okay. I shouldn't be the one that's so afraid.</p>
<p>"I love you," I tell her as my answer. She smiles then leans back
down and captures my lips again.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Dinah's sleeping in my arms now. Her body rests slightly over my own
and I have no words to describe...anything. All I know is that I am
content. I am happy and I am content. That constant war that I feel
is always going on inside of me seems to have...ceased at least for the
time being.</p>
<p>There's a knock on the door and then Barbara's head pokes into the
room. I signal for her to be quiet then mouth to her that I'll be out
in a sec. She nods then closes the door. I carefully remove myself
from under Dinah's body and place a soft kiss on her temple.</p>
<p>I quickly dress and meet Barbara right outside of the door. She's
looking at me and she's smiling. I know she wants to say something
but for some reason she's holding back.</p>
<p>"What's up?" I ask shifting uncomfortably on my feet.</p>
<p>"I just thought I'd ask if you two were hungry."</p>
<p>I know she wants to comment. "Just say it," I snap.</p>
<p>"But it looks like you've already satisfied your appetites." She says
immediately after permission has been given.</p>
<p>"That was truly brilliant."</p>
<p>"Yes well give me more time and I can come up with something better.
But seriously, and I'm guessing the answer will probably be yes since
I'm sure you have to replenish your energy, do you want to order
food?"</p>
<p>"Yeah that'd be good."</p>
<p>"I'll order it." She turns around to go...well order the food but I
need to know something before I go back in that room and lay with
Dinah.</p>
<p>"Why did you tell me about Reese coming to you? You let me think he
betrayed us."</p>
<p>She stops and I can see her shoulders droop. "I wanted to keep you
alive, Helena."</p>
<p>I nod even though she can't see me. "You still should have trusted
me."</p>
<p>"Would you have gone after her?"</p>
<p>"Probably." I'd never lie about that. "But I'd hope that you'd trust
me to come back before I did something stupid. I do have self-
control."</p>
<p>"I know." She turns back around to face me. "But you understand that
when it comes to Dinah, you're different. You let your heart lead you
instead of your head."</p>
<p>"And that's a bad thing?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," she immediately responds. "I think it's a great
thing but sometimes...well sometimes it just makes things a little more
interesting."</p>
<p>I just raise my brow in question.</p>
<p>"It's not a bad thing, Helena. Sometimes though, it can be dangerous.
Especially when dealing with people like this lizard lady."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"You aren't too terribly upset that I didn't tell you are you?"</p>
<p>I shake my head. "No. I don't like it and I don't want it happening
again, but I'm not too upset about it."</p>
<p>"I promise the next time Reese comes to me with information about the
current crazy then I'll tell you everything."</p>
<p>"Good." I nod.</p>
<p>She doesn't move. I know she's waiting to see if I have anything else
to say. I don't know how she knows I do but... "So Reese was willing to
let me think he was going to betray us to make sure I didn't go out
and do something crazy?"</p>
<p>"He's a good man."</p>
<p>"And a little stupid if he's willing to risk me kicking the shit out
of him."</p>
<p>Barbara smiles. "It was a risk he was willing to take." Her smile
fades and eyes harden. "He cares a lot about both you and Dinah,
Helena don't ever forget that."</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>"Good. Now go back in there and do whatever it was you were doing and
I'll go order the food."</p>
<p>I don't need to be told that twice. I open the door to the bedroom
and see Dinah still laid out peacefully on the bed, but I know she's
awake.</p>
<p>"Did you settle everything with Barbara?" she asks me as I slide into
the bed beside her.</p>
<p>"Yeah we talked." I wrap my arms around her and pull her to me.
</p>
<p>"That's good. So, no hard feelings?"</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>"Good." She takes my hand into hers and pulls it to her chest. "I
don't like it when you and Barbara don't get along."</p>
<p>"There's nothing to worry about now." I kiss the back of neck then
lay my head down next to hers. I think I'd like to stay like this
forever.</p>
