<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Five -->

<p>My fingers are all taken up now. I don't mean that in some hot freaky
sex way either. I mean that I've been terrified so many times now in
my life that I have no more fingers left over. There's when my mom
died. There's when Barbara took me in. There's when Dinah came and
changed my entire world, then when Dinah got shot, then when I
admitted to Dinah that she was my hero, then when Dinah told me she
loved me, then when I kissed Dinah, then the moment after I kissed
Dinah, then when Barbara contacted me and told me Dinah was in need
of assistance because of the lizard lady, then when I actually
arrived which seemed like it took days to do and found her leaning
over Reese's body, then the moment after the ambulance left because I
didn't know what to say or how she felt or what to do.</p>
<p>I've actually run out of fingers. I'll have to start counting on my
toes or something. I've officially gone crazy now. I don't know what
to do. My world is spinning in all kinds of directions and I have no
fucking clue what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I mean what I am doing is illegal, isn't it? Dinah is still only
seventeen. Of course she'll be eighteen pretty soon so that really
isn't that big of a problem. All I have to do is have no sexual
relations with her until she's of legal age. I can do that. I have
self-control. I can play the part of Clinton. Oh wait...Clinton
actually did have sexual relations didn't he? Well then I can be
better than Clinton. I'll do a better job of hiding it?</p>
<p>Okay I really can't think this way. I have to be stoic and not let my
lust consume me. I'm not really an animal, despite what some of my
previous uh...acquaintances might say. I wonder if Dinah would like me
to be an animal with her though. Does she expect it from me? I know
there's a side of her that is just as feral as I can be. She doesn't
show it often but when she does...</p>
<p>I was supposed to be talking myself into no sexual relations wasn't
I? What am I trying to do to myself? Commit suicide by heat
exhaustion.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Dinah asks me as she walks to the
fridge. "You kind of looked like you were having some uh...serious
thoughts." She turns around with a carton of orange juice in her hand
and a knowing smirk on her face.</p>
<p>Yeah I was having serious thoughts of...I don't even think I should
finish that thought in my head. "I was thinking about that you should
be at school. You do have school today right?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh." She nods. "I'm waiting for Barbara to finish getting ready
and that's so not what you were thinking about."</p>
<p>"Well," I chuckle, "I was thinking about you."</p>
<p>I wasn't quite aware of the fact that she could blush like that.
That's a very endearing shade of red. I wonder if she turns that same
shade of red when she...no. No. I'm not supposed to think about that.
I'm the adult in this relationship. I need to be the responsible one.
Wait. When the hell have I ever been the responsible one? I'm never
the responsible one. I'm the one that goes out and does whatever the
hell she wants then faces the consequences later or just ignores the
consequences altogether.</p>
<p>Now however, now I think everything is different. My life is changing
and I'm changing and my world is spinning and I'm just along for the
ride. I actually think Barbara would call this progress. Speaking of...</p>
<p>"Have you two finished with your morning flirting session or should I
just come back in a couple of minutes?"</p>
<p>"Oh was that a joke from the ever serious Barbara Gordon?" I ask
trying to hide the fact that her hearing Dinah and me makes me
slightly uncomfortable. I haven't really gotten a chance to discuss
the entire Dinah and me thing with her yet, so I really don't know
what she thinks and I really need to know what she thinks.</p>
<p>"I'm capable of grasping the concept of humor every once and a
while," She responds quickly. Despite what some people might think,
Barbara can hold her own very well. I don't often like getting in a
verbal spar with her because she wins most of the time and I'm not a
big fan of losing. It does bad things to my complexion.</p>
<p>"Well then..." Damn it. I'm sure I'll think of the perfect thing to say
when she walks out the door. What's Dinah laughing about? I'm sure
she couldn't think of anything either.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to go?" Dinah asks. "I don't want you using up all
your grasping power of humor this morning. You'll get a chance to
recharge at school."</p>
<p>Barbara just shakes her head turns herself around and goes towards
the elevator. Dinah follows but before she leaves she bends down and
gives me a quick peck on the lips. I want her touch to linger longer
but if it did I'm not too sure she'd make it to school and school is
important. At least, it's important to Dinah. She actually cares
about her future. She cares a lot more about hers than I did about
mine when I was in school.</p>
<p>"I'll see you when I get home," She calls out to me. "I love you."</p>
<p>I take a quick look at Barbara to see how she responds to the
endearment and I see nothing but an indulgent smile covering her
features. Maybe she could actually possibly maybe support what's
happening between Dinah and me or maybe she just doesn't want to say
anything now and is waiting to get me in a room alone to beat me up.
Still, I can't have my girl thinking that I don't love her too no
matter what Barbara thinks.</p>
<p>"I love you too. Be safe."</p>
<p>And then they're gone. They're off to play the roles of the daytime
Barbara and Dinah and I'm left to sit around here and...well and go
back to bed. It's way too damn early for me to even be up. Why am I
up anyway?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. I'm up because I wanted to see Dinah off to school. I wanted
to get a chance to see her before she had to go out into the
daylight. I needed to hear her say she loved me and I needed to tell
her in return.</p>
<p>What the hell has this girl done to me?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Okay so Dinah doesn't come home for another couple of hours I guess I
could waste my time by going to see Reese again in the hospital. He's
had a hard time with recovery. Apparently the poison he was exposed
to attacked his nervous system and it's been taking a few days for
him to get the feeling back in his body. If I hadn't given him the
antidote when I did it's quite possible that he would never be able
to walk again.</p>
<p>This may sound harsh, but I'm very glad that he was the one that got
hit with that poison instead of Dinah. I never want her to go through
that kind of pain. I wouldn't wish it on Reese either, of course but
if I had to make a choice...Reese would lose every time. He has lost
every time already.</p>
<p>I gave my heart to Dinah, actually I think she took it without me
realizing it and by the time I realized she had it I didn't really
mind. She also made me her partner in the whole crime-fighting scene.
Reese and I get along. We work well together but I would never call
him my partner. Everything that he could have gotten from me, that he
probably would have gotten from me if Dinah wasn't here, he's never
going to get. The only reason I tried to get something to happen
before was because I felt like I wanted something more in my life and
I thought Reese would be a good place to start, and he probably was a
good place to start. He was just a practice run until the real thing
came along or at least until I realized that the real thing was
standing right in front of me.</p>
<p>Through the window of the hospital door I can see Reese lying down.
I'm not quite sure how much movement he has recovered but Barbara
thinks it'll all come back eventually. This has to be hard on him. I
know I'd go crazy just sitting around waiting to be able to get back
up. Plus, Reese really doesn't have anyone. His mother came by a few
times and a couple of his cop buddies, but he really doesn't have
anyone by his side to stay with him through the night.</p>
<p>I know that at least if this had happened to me, Dinah and Barbara
would be in that room with me until I got up again. They'd stay and
take all the shit I'd throw that them through my frustration. Of
course, they'd probably throw some shit back at me. They wouldn't
give me that much leeway in pushing them around and pushing them
away.</p>
<p>Slowly I open the door to the hospital room. Reese turns to me and
grins. He doesn't want to show anyone how much he's hurting yet. I
know that he doesn't ever want to show me that he can be weak. He's
always had this macho man complex ever since we've met. I've always
just accepted it and let him act however the hell he wants.
Eventually he'll learn that I won't judge him just because he's human
and is capable of feeling pain.</p>
<p>"So how are...things?" I ask him as I approach the bed. "You ready to
get back out on the streets yet?"</p>
<p>"I was ready three days ago," He answers with a soft smile.</p>
<p>"Can you walk yet?"</p>
<p>"I've upgraded to a hobble."</p>
<p>I shake my head but can't stop the smirk that comes to cover my
face. "I guess that's progress."</p>
<p>Silence falls between us, but that's mostly because I don't have
anything else to say and whatever it is he wants to ask me he doesn't
have the courage to ask. I know he's wanted to say something to me
the past few days, but he hasn't done it yet. I've given him chances
but he doesn't take them.</p>
<p>"So..." he begins, "what's Canary and Oracle up to?"</p>
<p>I don't know why he insists on calling Dinah Canary still. He knows
her name. They've been introduced properly. I mean, with Barbara it's
different. She's still Oracle to him. That's all she's ever been to
him and most likely that's all she'll ever be to him. It may not seem
like it purely on the surface but Barbara is ten times more guarded
than I am.</p>
<p>"They're fine I guess." I shrug. "Just living out their daily lives."</p>
<p>"And what would that be?"</p>
<p>I grin. "A daytime school teacher and student."</p>
<p>He snorts. "Fine don't tell me. It's not that important."</p>
<p>Silence comes again and I'm contemplating leaving. He looks alive and
well, which is all I wanted to check up on.</p>
<p>"Okay so I'm going to leave," I say pointing to the door. "If you
need anything you know which button to press." I turn to walk out the
door but Reese reaches out and grabs my arm. I turn around slowly
with my brow raised waiting for him to give me a reason for why he
doesn't want me leaving.</p>
<p>"I think it's time I tell you thank you for saving my life," he
eventually says. "If you hadn't of came with the antidote...well things
would have turned out a whole hell of a lot worse than they did."</p>
<p>"You don't need to thank me," I tell him. "Dinah's the one who got me
there. She's the one who pushed you down when that woman was going to
attack you. I didn't do anything but show up, Dinah did the heroic
stuff." I'm going to give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you were still there." He argues. "You showed up and
you've been here for me ever since. That means a lot to me."</p>
<p>Are we about to have a moment? I really don't want to have a moment
with him. Not now. "Well...it's kind of what I do. If it makes you feel
any better then I'm glad you're not dead."</p>
<p>"Truthfully?" He grins. "It doesn't completely suck to know."</p>
<p>Then again there is silence. I don't know what to say at this point.
I'm ready to leave. Dinah will be back home soon and I want to be
there when she arrives.</p>
<p>"Do you ever think that we could try again?"</p>
<p>Why? Why does he have to bring this up? Can't he be satisfied in
knowing that I don't want him dead? Despite what some people may
think I do not like kicking people when they're down. Unless, of
course, they've been especially naughty.</p>
<p>"Reese," His eyes go dark immediately and I can see he's
withdrawing. "I think you're a nice guy, I really do but it's not
going to happen."</p>
<p>"Is there someone else or is it just me? Do you blame me for who my
father is?"</p>
<p>Okay where the hell did that come from? When was the last time I ever
said anything to him about his father?</p>
<p>"Of course that isn't it." Seriously where did he come up with
that? "I don't blame you for your father's mistakes. I'm the last
person that can go blaming people for what they're parents have done."</p>
<p>He raises his brow. "Then there's someone else?"</p>
<p>"Can't it just be that I don't think we'd work out?"</p>
<p>"But I think we would."</p>
<p>I drop my head. I don't want to look into his eyes anymore. "Reese.
There's someone else."</p>
<p>"Are you just lying to me now to get me to back off?" He sounds like
he's getting angry.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't..."</p>
<p>"Lie?" He finishes for me. "Of course you would. You're so concerned
with keeping your secrets and not letting anyone in that you don't
even think twice about lying. Are you honest with anyone?"</p>
<p>If he had told me this a couple of months ago then I probably would
have agreed with him, but now he's just wrong. He's so wrong that
it's not even funny how wrong he is. Plus who is he to say something
like that to me? So we went out a few times that doesn't mean he
knows me. He doesn't know me. He'll never know me.</p>
<p>I'm going to respond but Dinah comes into the room carrying a teddy
bear. She stops in the doorway when she realizes that I'm in the
room. She looks from me to Reese and I'm sure she can feel the
tension that surrounds us.</p>
<p>"Did I come at a bad time?" She asks as she slowly begins to back out
of the room. "I can always come back later."</p>
<p>"No it's fine." I tell her. I don't want to be left alone with Reese
any longer. He can believe whatever he wants. I have nothing to prove
to him. The only people I owe explanations or answers to are Dinah
and Barbara.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" She asks uncertainly. "I don't want to interrupt."</p>
<p>"Dinah it's fine. Come in." Reese calls from the bed. "Helena and I
were just discussing your daytime activities. She refuses to tell me
what you do all day."</p>
<p>Dinah smiles awkwardly then takes a good look at herself. She's
wearing her backpack still and along with the teddy bear in her arms
she has what appears to be a textbook. Maybe Reese isn't as good as a
detective as any of us thought. "Yeah well secret identity and all."
She finally says and approaches the bed. She holds the bear out to
Reese which he takes clumsily. His motor functions aren't quite where
they normally are. "So are you feeling better?"</p>
<p>"Like I told Helena, I've got a good hobbling going on."</p>
<p>Dinah chuckles politely. "Well that's good." She places her hand on
his shoulder. "I'm really glad you're making progress. We need you
well."</p>
<p>I know she still feels guilty about what has happened to him. That's
something that I'll probably never be able to take away from her.
She'll have to work it out on her own. Hopefully one day she'll
understand that we can't save everyone all the time. We both may be
superheroes but we're not God. Hopefully, one day I'll understand
that too. We can actually work on it together.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Reese clears his throat. "Thanks for the bear."</p>
<p>"It's nothing."</p>
<p>Well I certainly need to get out of this room now. "So get to feeling
better soon. Dinah's right, we do kind of need you well."</p>
<p>Reese nods. "I will."</p>
<p>"You ready to go?" I ask turning to Dinah. I know that she has to be
as uncomfortable as I am.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She grabs my hand. "We'll be back tonight after sweeps," she
tells Reese then pulls me out of the room.</p>
<p>My eyes connect with Reese's before I make it out of the room and I'm
not too sure what to make of the look he's giving me. He may think
that we have something else to talk about, but we don't. I've said my
part. He either accepts it or he doesn't.</p>
<p>"I didn't really expect to see you here." Dinah says as soon as the
door to the room is closed. She almost sounds kind of jealous.</p>
<p>"I figured I'd check up on him. He's going through a tough time and I
know he could use some friends." I want to cross my arms in front of
me to emphasis my next point but I don't want to let go of Dinah's
hand so as a compromise I pull her closer to me. "What are you doing
here?"</p>
<p>She holds my gaze then turns her eyes to floor or more accurately my
cleavage. "The same as you."</p>
<p>With my free hand I grab her chin and gently force her to look into
my eyes again. "I told him there's someone else. He doesn't believe
me, but it doesn't matter. I don't love him."</p>
<p>She unexpectedly pulls me to her in a tight hug. "I know I'm being
stupid, but I can't help it," she whispers into my ear.</p>
<p>When she pulls back I kiss her tenderly. "No you're not. You're being
concerned even though you don't have a reason to be."</p>
<p>"You mean stupid?" She asks with her brow raised.</p>
<p>"Concerned."</p>
<p>"Stupid?"</p>
<p>"Concerned."</p>
<p>"Stu..." Before she can finish I lean in and kiss her. It's a good way
to get her to be quiet and an equally good way to let her know I love
her.</p>
<p>As I pull away I whisper softly, "Concerned."</p>
<p>She nods. "Concerned," then leans in and kisses me again. When we
break apart that's when I realize that we're still standing in the
hospital right in front of Reese's door. Right in front of the door
that has a window that I used to look in on Reese with when I first
arrived. I turn to the window now and see Reese staring at us.</p>
<p>"Shit," I drop my gaze away.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>I just nod my head in the direction of the window. "Oh."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Do you think we should go back inside?" She asks unsure.</p>
<p>I shake my head. "No. I told him there was someone else."</p>
<p>"And Reese and I got along so splendidly before," Dinah falls into me
and puts her head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. He would have found out eventually."</p>
<p>"Yeah," she sighs. "So can we go home now?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I put my arm around her shoulders and guide her towards
the exit of the hospital. I feel bad for Reese but...I don't love him.</p>
