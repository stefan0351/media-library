<!-- Chased the Dream \ Epilogue -->

<p>When we get back to the clock tower Barbara is waiting for us with
some hot chocolate. We all sit around the kitchen table and sip on
our warm drinks. Barbara doesn't yell at me for what I have done. I'm
not too sure I really expected her to. I made one of those really big
decisions tonight and I have to live with it. I've reunited a family
but who knows how many Sarah tore apart. Those families will never
get justice.</p>
<p>I'm not too sure what Reese could tell the jury for that murder
trial. The offender was in a coma at the time. It's kind of the
perfect alibi.</p>
<p>So this is the life of the superhero huh? I get to sit around here
with my very attractive girlfriend and very cool mentor and friend.
Who still hasn't told my girlfriend that she's leaving on a romantic
getaway with her surprisingly sweet boyfriend. I wonder how Helena
will react to that when the subject does arise. I could bring it up
now, but I won't. Until she starts telling me about all the secrets
of the clock tower then I'm not going to be telling her about
Barbara's personal life. Plus, I don't gossip. Often.</p>
<p>"So Dinah how are you feeling after letting someone invade your
body?" Okay so maybe Barbara will start yelling at me.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me that you wouldn't do the exact same thing I did?"</p>
<p>"No." Barbara and Helena answer together. I kind of actually believe
them too.</p>
<p>"Of course you would. We're heroes. We do the right thing."</p>
<p>Barbara turns and asks Helena, "I haven't let anyone take over my
body recently have you?"</p>
<p>Helena shakes her head no.</p>
<p>"Okay for a fact, I know that both of you are lying."</p>
<p>It takes them each a moment to catch up to what I'm saying but they
eventually do. Unfortunately Barbara's the only one that blushes.
Helena just looks at me and smirks.</p>
<p>"Cute," Barbara responds.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>Barbara shakes her head and Helena reaches over and takes my
hand. "Next time you decide to let anyone who isn't me invade your
body; please let me know about it first. At least give me a chance to
try and talk you out of it."</p>
<p>I know what she's admitting to me. I shouldn't have made this choice
on my own. We're a team. My body is no longer my own...in a way...I
guess.</p>
<p>"Next time you both will have full knowledge before someone takes
over my body."</p>
<p>They both nod and I know that we're okay now. I'll probably have a
few nightmares about this later on down the road, but we're okay. I'm
okay. I'm here with my family and we're just fine. The only person
missing is Reese, but I think it's going to take a while for both of
us to actually get used to caring about each other in the family sort
of way. I could always use the advice of a big brother though.
Tomorrow I'll definitely give him a call.</p>
