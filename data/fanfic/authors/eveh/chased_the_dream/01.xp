<chapter title="Part One">
<p>It's cold tonight. I didn't want to come out and do my sweeps but
such is the life of a superhero. Not that I don't enjoy it, I do.
It's probably the single best thing that has ever happened to me.
It's given me a home and family, none of which I really had before,
and plus I get to be a hero. Of course I can't tell anyone about it
but I don't feel the need to. I know it sounds way too altruistic or
something, but I just like knowing that I'm making a difference in
this world. I don't know how big of a difference it is, but at least
I'm doing something. I've unknowingly followed in the very same
footsteps of my absentee and now deceased mother. That's something I
never expected.</p>
<p>I never expected a lot from life though, I always just figured I had
to chase my dream and find my own life because whatever life I was
living when I was a little girl wasn't mine. I was the type of girl
that was always staring off into space imagining what my real life
was supposed to be like and what my real family was supposed to be
like and who I was supposed to be like.</p>
<p>Oh hey look, a mugger. I definitely thought it was too cold for the
common criminals to come out tonight, I guess I was wrong. Oracle
sent me out alone tonight, she must not have expected more than this
type of crime tonight. Sometimes I still wonder if she's just so
protective because she cares so much or if she's so protective
because she doesn't think I can control myself yet.</p>
<p>"Hey," I call out to the mugger, "Don't you think it's just a little
too cold out tonight to be mugging people?"</p>
<p>He turns to me and smiles. I know he sees me as a helpless little
girl, apparently the dark foreboding outfit doesn't give him the clue
he needs to just run away. He doesn't answer me he only holds his
knife up proudly in the night. Like most idiots that I've encountered
he wants to fight me probably to prove his masculinity is still fully
intact.</p>
<p>He runs at me with the knife screaming, I'm not sure if the goal of
the screaming is supposed to annoy me or scare me. It doesn't make
much of an impression either way. I side step his approach and stick
my leg out to trip him as he runs by. He falls to the ground and the
knife flies out of his hands. He jumps back up to his feet and starts
taking swings at me. I block his fists and pay him back with a quick
jab. He falls backwards but remains on his feet. I throw a few more
punches and a couple of kicks his way and he's out for the count.</p>
<p>I turn around to the sobbing girl leaning against the wall in the
alley. She's looking at me with that look that people usually get
once you save their life. I like that look. It's one of the best
parts of being the hero.</p>
<p>"Everything's okay now," I tell her. "He's not going to hurt you."</p>
<p>"Thank you," she stumbles out. "Thank you so much."</p>
<p>"Yeah of course." I walk over to her and help her pick up the
contents of her purse. "Are you going to be okay?"</p>
<p>She nods and thanks me once more before she walks away. Chances are
she'll maybe see me on the street again and she'll not even recognize
me as the girl who once helped her out. The daylight Dinah and the
nighttime Canary seem to have established themselves as two very
separate entities. I'm not too sure if that's a good thing because
even though I've found my home, my family, and direction in my life,
I'm not too sure I've found out who I am yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The clock tower is still. I'm guessing Barbara's hanging out
somewhere waiting to jump out and scare me. She's good at that. Of
course, she'll always want to know how sweeps went even though she
already knows. She'll want to hear the details of what I saw and what
I did. I'd like to say that I don't enjoy sharing my night with her
but I really like it. I like telling her that I was able to handle
myself and I like seeing the pride in her eyes when I tell her about
some situation that I handled without even a single flinch.</p>
<p>I don't know why I need it and I don't know why I want it, but I want
her approval. I want her to tell me that I did a good job.</p>
<p>"Hey," she calls out to me from above me. She's sitting at the table
in the kitchen waiting for me with what would appear to be a warm cup
of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>"Hey," I shout back and throw my jacket over a chair. "Anything
interesting happen while I was out?"</p>
<p>Barbara smiles down at me, "I was just about to ask the same thing.
But you know that, of course."</p>
<p>I shrug. "Sweeps were basically sweeps. I ran into one solitary
mugger who was taken care of by the local PD and that's all." I'm by
her side now and have an urge to give her a hug but I take my seat at
the other end of the table instead. "Thanks for the hot chocolate by
the way. It's cold out there tonight."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>She's waiting for me to tell her more. She knows I want to tell her
how I was able to knockout the guy without even breaking a sweat. She
knows I want to share with her the look that woman had in her eyes
when she realized that she was save and I was her savior.</p>
<p>I can no longer hold it in, "So okay what happened was I was walking
by just doing sweeps y'know? And then I see this guy trying to rob
this woman. He has her pressed up against the wall and who really
knows what he was planning to do, so I got his attention and he turns
to me. He was really ugly, but anyway he turns to me and runs at me
with a knife screaming." I take a breath. "Why do they scream
anyway?" It's a genuine question that I'll give her a chance to
answer when I'm done with my story. "So I just kind of step out of
his way and trip him. He falls down and gets back up and just starts
swinging at me," I sit on my hands so I don't mimic his
movements. "And I block him then knocked him out. When I turned
around and saw the woman she was just looking at me...y'know the
look, and it was great."</p>
<p>Barbara keeps her indulgent smile on throughout my story and I can
see the twinkle in her eyes that tells me I did good. She's about to
respond when Helena the Huntress comes storming into the clock tower.
I can only guess that her night wasn't as easy going as mine.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?" Barbara calls out to her.</p>
<p>"What gave you that idea?" Helena rips off her jacket and there's a
visible slash on the right sleeve.</p>
<p>"Eww...not good." I add in my own two cents.</p>
<p>"No kidding blondie. Do you know how much this coat costs?"</p>
<p>I just smile, shake my head and take a sip of my hot chocolate.</p>
<p>"Bastards," she mutters under her breath.</p>
<p>"Do you want to let us in on what happened?"</p>
<p>"Some guy ran at me with a knife and slashed my coat."</p>
<p>I want to relay to her the fact that my coat was left unaffected from
my encounter with a knife but decide to wait until tomorrow. At least
then Helena won't be as inclined to hit me...as hard. Barbara looks
over at me and raises her brow. I see this as a challenge. She's
daring me to say something now. She wants me to risk taking on
Helena's wrath.</p>
<p>I am not so easily swayed. I will wait.</p>
<p>"You should start taking insurance out on your clothes," I say
instead, "or you could just use some of the money you've inherited to
buy a new coat and while you're at it you could by me a few things
too."</p>
<p>I don't like the look I'm getting now so I stand up and begin backing
away from the situation. "Well will you look at the time," I point to
the big clock that is behind us. "I should really be going to bed
what with it being a school night and all. I'll leave you two to
entertain yourselves."</p>
<p>I make it to my room without incident. I need to shower before I go
to bed. The grime of the street has already started to seep through
my skin and make me feel dirtier than any human should be. There's a
knock on my door as I prepare for my shower. I call to whoever it is
to answer and am greeted with a timid looking Helena.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" I ask when it appears she's not going to speaking on her own
anytime soon.</p>
<p>"How'd sweeps go?" she asks hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Nothing major. I didn't get killed so that's a definite plus."</p>
<p>Silence fills the room again and Helena's odd behavior is actually
starting to concern me. I'm wondering if my comment about her
inheritance hurt her somehow. I thought we were okay with joking with
each other now. I didn't mean to hurt her.</p>
<p>"If this is about what I said you don't have to buy me anything. I
understand why you don't want to touch your father's money..."</p>
<p>Helena gives me this odd look so I stop talking. "You do?" she
eventually asks.</p>
<p>"Well yeah, I mean it's like he's trying to make up not being there
your entire life with money and it's like he thinks money will do
something to make things better but it really doesn't because...well
it just doesn't. Things don't work that way." I decide to stop
talking before I say anything that might let everyone conclude that I
am a complete idiot.</p>
<p>"Oh." She says after yet another long moment of silence. "That's not
what I cam to talk to you about though."</p>
<p>Oh so she just wanted me to look stupid. Now I get it.</p>
<p>"I need to ask you something?"</p>
<p>Oh so she wants my advice on something. Now I really get it. No wait.
I don't get it. Helena never asks my advice about anything. What
would she want my advice about? I don't know anything about anything.
She's been here longer. Why doesn't she ask Barbara? Okay I'm feeling
the pressure now. "What do you need?" I don't think she could hear
the unfounded fear in my voice.</p>
<p>"Well, I need you to..." she sighs, "Why is this so hard?" She asks
herself. "Okay what I want to know is if you'll help me with Reese."</p>
<p>I'm not quite what kind of look I'm giving her but it makes her turn
around and tell me she's being stupid and to not worry about it. I
reach out and grab onto her hand to stop her from leaving.</p>
<p>"It's not stupid. I'm just surprised. Why aren't you asking Barbara?"</p>
<p>"Miss Barbara 'keep a man at a good ten mile distance' Gordon?"</p>
<p>Okay so she has a point. "Okay. But why me?"</p>
<p>"You're good at these type of things. You let people in and you know
how to act with people. You open yourself up."</p>
<p>Well when she puts it that way..."No I'm not. I'm terrible at these
types of things. I just make an ass out of myself until people take
pity on me."</p>
<p>"No you are good at it Dinah, you walked right in this clock tower
and made it so I didn't really want you to leave. That takes some
skill."</p>
<p>Did she just say..."You don't want me to leave?"</p>
<p>"Well no," she's shifting from side to side now. I think she's
uncomfortable but that's okay because so am I.</p>
<p>"What exactly or why exactly do you want or expect to happen with
Reese?" Maybe if I bring this conversation back to its original point
we'd both calm down or at least I'd be able to calm down.</p>
<p>"I just think it's time that I...tried to...you know."</p>
<p>No I don't know. "You want to try...?"</p>
<p>"To have a life."</p>
<p>Wow. That was a very honest and upfront answer. "If you really want
to make something work then I guess my only advice would be to let
him see the person that you are inside. Cause you know when I see you
without the Huntress persona and even with her I see a very
attractive woman and I'm not just talking the outside appearance."</p>
<p>Wait rewind and back up. I just told her I thought she was
attractive. That was on my list of things not to ever mention aloud
in this lifetime. I guess I can scratch it off now. Oh look is Helena
blushing?</p>
<p>"You really think so?"</p>
<p>Okay so since when did we become to schoolgirls chatting about boys
and looks or to me more accurate when did Helena become a schoolgirl
again and me actually act like one. I don't usually talk about boys
and make-up with Gabby.</p>
<p>"Of course I think so. I mean if I were any older or uh...well my
point here is I'd be very happy to be with someone like you. It'd be
fun."</p>
<p>It'd be fun? Yeah maybe this conversation should end now. "I mean
Reese is a lucky man and if you really want to see if this whole
thing you've got going on with him will work then I say go for it."
Can this conversation please be over now? I am still a teenager and I
do still have the ability to fall down dead from embarrassment. It
says so in the teenager handbook.</p>
<p>Thankfully Helena has had enough of the conversation as well because
her cool defensive demeanor falls right back into place and I'm
looking at the Helena that I know and love. Love? Yes shower I need
to take a shower and then I need to sleep.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She says to me then turns and walks out of my room.
Thankfully I am alone now and I can actually try and breath normally.
I can take off this mask that I wear and at least admit to myself
that I'm very happy Helena is going to try and be happy. She deserves
it. I know she deserves it. On the other hand however...why the hell
does it have to be with that...that...that stupid head Reese?!</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Two">
<p>Okay so it's been a week. Well actually it's been two weeks. Two very
long horrendous weeks of having to hear a blow for blow account of
how Helena and Reese's relationship has progressed. I've even been
able to see the progression on a few occasions. I'm happy for Helena.
I'm happy for Helena. I'm her friend and kind of like a younger
sister to her because we share sisterly love so I'm happy for her.
I'm happy for her. I'm happy for her.</p>
<p>I just figure if I repeat it enough then maybe I'll believe it. I
should probably change my mantra from 'I'm happy for her'
to 'Jealousy doesn't accomplish anything'. I'm not jealous of Reese
though. Why would I be? What do I have to be jealous of? Can the man
even add two and two together?</p>
<p>Okay that's not very nice. Detective Jesse Reese is an intelligent
man. He carries such attributes as actually caring about his job and
being concerned for the well-being of Helena, and even sometimes I
think he actually cares about me too. We haven't established any real
friendly repore but that's because I believe in a professional
distance. If I get too close I may actually throw the man into a
wall. So on the whole, keeping distance between us is a good thing.</p>
<p>Nothing serious has happened between them yet. At least I don't think
anything has. I'm kind of sure...well semi-positive that Helena would
tell me if seriousness has ensued. I get the feeling that she's
opening up to him more but she's still hiding away a lot of stuff.
She keeps a part of herself locked away and she only really shows it
to Barbara and sometimes she even shows it to me. She's talked to me
more now. And I'm not just talking about those surface conversations
about fighting and the big bad evil of the city, but we actually
talk. She's talked about her mom and I've talked about my mom.</p>
<p>I bet she hasn't talked to Reese about her mom. I bet he doesn't even
know the first thing of why Helena became Huntress. Yeah that's
right. He doesn't know anything and I do. I wonder what he'd have to
say about that. Mr. 'I'm the best detective in all of New Gotham come
look at how much of a pretty boy I am' Reese. I did say that jealousy
was bad didn't I?</p>
<p>Okay so I need to concentrate now. I'm supposed to meet up with
Huntress and we're supposed to stop some robbery of some bank because
that's what we do. Detective Reese is going to be coming as well but
that's after we stop the robbers first.</p>
<p>"Hey," Huntress says from behind me. I jump slightly because I didn't
hear her coming. It's easy to get snuck up on when you're not paying
attention. I'm here to play the superhero. I'm here to play the
superhero. Oh hey look, I've developed a new mantra.</p>
<p>"Hi. What took you so long?"</p>
<p>"I had to set things up with Jesse."</p>
<p>Oh it's Jesse now is it? We've graduated from Reese to Jesse. Well
isn't that nice. It's fantastic even. Yes, it's nice and fantastic.
Here to be a superhero. Here to be a superhero. Here to be a
superhero.</p>
<p>"So what's going on?"</p>
<p>What's going on she asks? What's going on? Well firstly I'm about to
start yelling for no other reason except for the fact she called
Reese Jesse. Well that actually covers the first, second, third, and
fourth things of what's going on.</p>
<p>"Four guys are inside the bank. From what Oracle can tell one is
definitely meta. He melted the door to the safe so that they could
get inside."</p>
<p>Huntress nods her head and I can just tell by her stance that it's
playtime for her now. She loves this. Hell, I love this. The
adrenaline is flowing through me quite nicely now and I have a good
high going on.</p>
<p>"Oracle Huntress is here now," I speak to our leader.</p>
<p>"Finally, what took you so long? I thought Canary might have to take
these guys on her own." Ooh someone's in trouble. Wait? Does she
think I can't take these guys on my own, because I so could.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. Let's just get this show on the road."</p>
<p>Oracle sighs heavily. "Fine." She then proceeds to tell us everything
she knows about what's happening inside the bank. Once she's finished
Huntress looks at me and I nod. We're ready to go take care of the
current situation.</p>
<p>We enter the bank through the same entrance the man that can melt
metal entered. Each of the guys has a huge bag of cash in their arms.
When they finally spot Huntress and I they stop confused. They're
perfect scheme apparently as perfect as they once thought.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" One of them asks.</p>
<p>"What does it really matter?" I ask. "We're obviously not here to
help you carry the money out of here. We are blocking your exit."</p>
<p>The man looks at me confused then turns his attention to Huntress.
She only shrugs then rushes him and hits him in the jaw. He quickly
recovers and they're going on round two. I throw one of the men
against a desk and take my chances with the metal melter. I'm able to
handle him surprisingly well until he gets a chance to touch my skin
and burns my hand.</p>
<p>Pain shoots through my entire body and I know I must have screamed
louder than I ever have before. I don't like getting burned. There
are some bad memories there. I recover as quickly as possible, which
isn't quick enough because I see metal melter man coming reaching for
my bare skin again. I roll away from him and then hear a gunshot.</p>
<p>Detective Reese is standing in the doorway and guy number four, who I
wasn't really concerned about is lying on the ground bleeding. It
doesn't really take me too long to realize that he had a gun in his
hand and he had been facing my direction. Well, so now I owe Reese my
gratitude for possibly, maybe, saving my life. I'd have to tell him
my thanks later. Metal melting guy had only hesitated as long as I
did when the gunshot occurred.</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet and since I was kind of tired of getting burned I
gathered all the energy I had left and concentrated on throwing
energy at the man to get him away. To my utter amazement it worked. I
looked down at my hands expecting to find some weird something coming
from them but they appeared perfectly normal except for the burn
marks.</p>
<p>I turned my attention then to Helena who was quickly approaching me.
She grabbed my hands in hers and started telling me that I was okay.
Something that I kind of already figured out.</p>
<p>"You need to get Oracle to take a look at those."</p>
<p>That was something that I knew too because they hurt like hell. I was
a superhero though so I had to make sure everything was okay. I
looked around and everything looked fine. All four robbers were in
some state of pain and unconciousness which was a positive thing.
Huntress and Canary had saved the day once again and New Gotham was
safe. Now seemed like a good time to pass out.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When I woke up the first thing I noticed was that my hands had been
bandaged. Actually, that was the second thing I noticed. The first
thing I noticed was that someone was holding my hand that had been
bandaged. I turned my head and was facing the very concerned face of
one Helena Kyle. I also had this quite painful uh...pain in my side. I
wasn't quite too sure that had happened. I hadn't felt that before.</p>
<p>"What happened?" I asked trying to sit up, but Helena pushed me back
down.</p>
<p>"You need to rest."</p>
<p>"Okay. But what happened? I don't remember all that much. We stopped
the bad guys then I'm here."</p>
<p>"You were shot."</p>
<p>"What?" I jumped too quickly for Helena to stop me this time. "I
don't remember getting shot. Where was I shot?" I started to turn in
the bed and was then once more made aware of the pain in my side. My
guess was that I was shot in the side. When though? "I only heard one
gunshot."</p>
<p>"That's because the guy wasn't able to make another one. I stopped
him before he could."</p>
<p>"Reese was there?"</p>
<p>"He didn't pull his gun quick enough."</p>
<p>"So I was shot?"</p>
<p>Helena nodded.</p>
<p>Wow. Shot. I had been shot. That's never really happened to me
before. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would.</p>
<p>"Did the bullet actually hit me?"</p>
<p>"Actually he just kind of grazed you. It wasn't that bad. You got
lucky."</p>
<p>That's when I realized Helena was still hanging onto my hand. It
wasn't a soft touch either. No. She was actually hanging onto my
hand. I don't think she'd have let go if a thousand talking
chimpanzees came up to her and started interviewing her.</p>
<p>"Does that mean now I get some superhero star patch that tells the
world I've taken a bullet for the city?"</p>
<p>I don't think Helena finds this funny because she's not smiling nor
smirking nor grinning slightly.</p>
<p>"It isn't funny Dinah. You could have died."</p>
<p>"But I didn't."</p>
<p>"But you could have."</p>
<p>"But I didn't."</p>
<p>"But you COULD have."</p>
<p>"But I didn't."</p>
<p>I'm sure if we could have gone on like that the entire night if
Barbara hadn't come in to settle it. "Enough," she said, "Dinah you
could have died and Helena she didn't. Do we all have the facts
straight now?"</p>
<p>Helena and I look at each other and then turn our attention to
Barbara. I'm not too sure what the look meant but I just figured we
agreed to not talk about this anymore. At least that's what I was
going for in the look.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling, Dinah?" Barbara asks as she comes closer to my
bedside and starts inspecting all my wounds. "Your hands? Do they
still hurt?"</p>
<p>Helena is still holding onto my hand and Barbara, I'm sure, takes
note of this but decides not to comment.</p>
<p>"I can't really feel anything except my side."</p>
<p>"Well that's to be expected. How is everything else?"</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what Barbara means by everything else. I mean my
health seems fine. I'm in rather good spirits considering I could
have died but didn't. Oh wait yes that's now all consuming fear
enveloping my heart. I was shot. I could have died. If Helena hadn't
stopped that guy then I would be dead. Also, Reese didn't save my
life so I don't owe him for anything. There are plusses to near death
experiences it would seem. Mostly though I think I was a little
afraid. And little afraid should be expressed differently like
completely and utterly terrified. What good were all these weird
powers I had if I could still get shot and not even know it. I mean
tonight I threw a guy with some weird energy thing because I really
wanted to yet I didn't recognize getting shot. I didn't recognize the
fact that someone was even pointing a gun at me until it was too
late. Yes completely and utterly terrified kind of sums things up
nicely.</p>
<p>"I'm doing fine." I finally answer Barbara. She doesn't believe me. I
don't think anyone else in the room believes me. I don't believe me
but I don't want to talk about this now.</p>
<p>I could always pretend like it didn't happen. And if it didn't happen
then I don't have to deal with anything. I can just move on with my
life and everything will be fine. That'll solve all kinds of problems
for me. If I pretend like I don't feel anything towards Helena then I
have no reason to get jealous over Reese (although that hasn't been
working to well) I can pretend like getting shot didn't scare me and
we can continue living on acting like one big happy family. Superhero
family. The only pain I have to work through is the physical and I've
done that before. It's no big deal.</p>
<p>I remove my hand as carefully as possible from Helena's grip and turn
my head so that I don't have to be faced with either of their gazes.</p>
<p>"I'm kind of tired. It'd probably be a good idea for me to get some
sleep. You know with the whole being shot thing making me weak and
all." This is my dismissal for them. Barbara has checked up on me.
I'm still alive and she doesn't look too worried so I think I'm going
to make it through the night and Helena and I have had our little
argument about what happened. It's time for them to leave me alone
now. I don't care how hurt they both look from it. I can't care at
least not about this.</p>
<p>They each make their way towards the door and they each take one look
back as they leave. They're going to give me my space. That's a good
thing. I notice however that after Helena leaves she doesn't shut the
door all the way. She leaves it open just a crack but it's still
open.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Three">
<p>I can count all the times I've been absolutely terrified in my life
on one hand and still have a few fingers left over. There was the
time my mother died, the time Barbara took me in, and the time Dinah
came into my world and decided to change things. Two weeks ago I
added another instance of being absolutely terrified and that's when
I realized Dinah had been shot.</p>
<p>Barbara insists that none of it was my fault but she wasn't there so
she just doesn't know better. I was too slow. With all this
superhuman speed and agility I was too slow to stop that idiot from
shooting Dinah. I don't know if even Dinah realizes how close she
came to getting...well getting shot worse. I don't know what Supreme
Being was looking out for her that night, I don't know what made her
roll one way instead of another but she did and the bullet only
grazed her side. If she had just moved the other way then I don't
know how well off she'd be right now.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn't take responsibility from what happened but it's
hard not to. It's very hard not to. It wasn't entirely my fault. I
know this. I know that we risk our lives every night and we both
accept the risk of being mortally injured but I don't like having to
accept that when it comes to Dinah.</p>
<p>When she was fully recovered I wanted to tell her that she was no
longer allowed to go out on sweeps. I wanted to tell her that she was
no longer allowed to risk her life, but I knew that she'd just hate
me more if I did and I don't want her to hate me anymore than she
already does. Plus, risking her life for other's is just who she is.
I could probably no more demand she change that than I could demand
Barbara to actually let someone into her heart a little. Am I just
completely useless around here?</p>
<p>Oh no wait. I'm good for something. It would seem that I'm actually
very good at being a punching bag for Dinah. She wants to get better.
I can certainly understand that. Part of her working out so much is
probably due to the fact that she doesn't ever want to come that
close to death again. I even support her learning to be even more
careful than she already is, but I don't want her to work too hard.</p>
<p>She's pushing her powers to the limit now. It seems like she can do
something new everyday and while that's really great I can tell that
it's draining her. Barbara has tried to get her slow down but Dinah
isn't even listening to her and I know how much that's affecting
Barbara now. They were getting so close then Dinah just...well she just
kind of shut the door on all of us.</p>
<p>We had gotten so far. We had gotten so damn far and then Dinah just
decides we've gone far enough without consulting any of us, without
consulting me. She was the friend that I turned to when I needed to
talk about what was going on in my life. I mean, sure I could still
talk to Barbara but it wasn't the same because with Barbara we
weren't on the same level. She was my mentor, she was the teacher and
that's how it would always be.</p>
<p>With Dinah we were sort of equal. Sure I had more experience than her
and my general knowledge of the whole superhero edge was broader but
still...we were kind of equal. I trusted her. I still do trust her but
I don't think she trusts me. She doesn't want to be near me anymore.
She is always pulling herself away. She's built a nice wall up around
herself to keep everyone and everything out and I don't know how to
break it down.</p>
<p>I wonder if she'll ever figure out that she had sort of become my
hero and now I was watching her fall. It's always hard to watch the
hero fall.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Barbara asks as she joins me as I look
up into the night sky.</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>She only nods her head. She knows what I'm thinking about because
she's been thinking about the same thing. "She'll come around."</p>
<p>"You've been saying that for two weeks now and the only change I see
is Dinah getting stronger and faster and pulling further away."</p>
<p>"If she goes on like she is then we'll confront her. I still have
hope that she'll realize what's happening and will just come to us.
She has in the past."</p>
<p>"I just want her back." I whisper softly.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Barbara sighs, "so do I."</p>
<p>That's when Dinah decides to join us. She knows we've been talking
about her but she doesn't say anything about it. We stand there all
together looking out at the city and up at the sky. There's a peace
here. Even with Dinah's situation the peace remains.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Delphi alert goes off and Barbara and I turn to go back
into the clock tower. Duty calls. Duty always seems to call. As we
leave I can barely even hear Dinah whisper into the night, "I want to
come back too." She then just turns and follows Barbara and me to
the computers.</p>
<p>"It's Reese." Barbara says when we are both by her side.</p>
<p>I really don't want to deal with Reese right now. But what choice do
I really have. "Fine, I'm on my way." I turn to Dinah. "Do you want
to come with me?"</p>
<p>I can see that Barbara wants to object. She doesn't think Dinah is
ready to hit the streets again, but I know that if I can just get
Dinah to come with me...I make myself believe that if Dinah just comes
with me then everything will be okay. I hope to make Barbara believe
it too. For that matter, I hope to make Dinah believe it as well.</p>
<p>"So are you coming?" I ask again when I get no answer.</p>
<p>Dinah looks to Barbara for approval but Barbara just looks at her
computer screens. I'm sure she thinks this has to be Dinah's
decision.</p>
<p>"I'll go."</p>
<p>Thank God. She's going to go. "Well alright then get ready." Dinah
smiles, the first real smile I've seen from her in a while, and runs
up stairs to change.</p>
<p>"I hope that whatever you have planned works, Helena. I really do."
Barbara tells me still focusing on her screens. She hides behind
those screens sometimes.</p>
<p>"You're not the only one."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Reese has another suspicious death so he gave me a call. That's all
he really calls me for anymore. That's all I allow him to call me
for. With Dinah acting like she has been I've been reacting by going
further into my own little shell. It would seem that if Dinah isn't
happy then I'm not happy. If Dinah hides away then I have to hide
away too. That's kind of weird actually. I wonder why that is.</p>
<p>It isn't something I should be thinking about now though. I have a
dead body in front of me and there's always work to do.</p>
<p>"So what can you tell us?" I ask Reese. He looks over at me then
turns his gaze to Dinah. I get the feeling he kind of wished she
wasn't here. For some reason, he always gets tense around her. I'm
guessing it's from knowing that his father killed her mother, but
that's really only my guess. I can see how that could breed
awkwardness though.</p>
<p>"Well, from what the witness told us this guy was jumped by a lizard."</p>
<p>"Lizard?" Dinah steps closer and looks over the body.</p>
<p>"Yeah, some lizard apparently spit something at the guy and uh...my
guess would be it was poisonous."</p>
<p>"So we're dealing with some poisonous lizard man?" I ask stepping
closer to Dinah to look down at the body.</p>
<p>"Get a sample of the poison for me if you can," Oracle tells me. "If
I can analyze I can probably come up with an antidote."</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am." I pull out a vial that I keep in my jacket, for just
such an occasion and bend down over the body.</p>
<p>"What do you think you're doing?" Reese asks grabbing my arm. "We
can't tamper with the scene."</p>
<p>"Oracle wants a sample so that she can find an antidote so that when
one of us gets attack by this guy, which is inevitable and even more
inevitable that it'll be you, we-meaning you-won't die." Wow Dinah's
got some bite to her tonight. I kind of like it.</p>
<p>Reese looks at me like he's expecting me to say something to Dinah,
but I'm not going to. Dinah's right. Of the three of us, Reese is the
most likely to be attacked by this guy and not because he's going to
be any more exposed to lizard man than we are, but just because he's
well...he's not meta.</p>
<p>After a short staring contest Reese lets go of my arm and I proceed
to take a sample of the poison that is on the man's skin. I take a
closer look at our victim and I fail to come up with a name. I've
never seen him before, which isn't too odd. I actually consider
myself lucky if I recognize the dead person. That's sounds kind of
strange maybe I should rephrase that. It's always a tragedy when I
recognize the victim but at least we have something to go on if I
know them. Usually, I know some place to start the investigation.
There's no starting from scratch.</p>
<p>"Do you recognize him?" Dinah asks me after, I guess, I've been
looking at the body for too long.</p>
<p>"No," I shake my head, "I've never seen him before."</p>
<p>"Well that's a good thing." She smiles at me and I can't help but
smile back. I knew taking her out tonight would be a good thing,
especially after what I heard her say at the clock tower. I know she
wants to get back to how it used to be. Dinah's not the type to
remain silent, stoic, and broody. That's kind of my job already.</p>
<p>"Are you done?" Reese calls from above us.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I tear my eyes from Dinah. "I've got what I needed." I hold
up the vial for him to see then put it back in my coat safe and sound
for Oracle to examine, test, manipulate, and do whatever else she
deems fit. "We should probably be going now, though. Still need to
protect the city from the scum and the miscreants."</p>
<p>I don't know why but this makes Dinah laugh. I'm happy she's
laughing. "Uh yeah, but before you go," Reese tears my attention once
again from Dinah, "can I talk to you alone."</p>
<p>I don't get a chance to answer. "Huntress go ahead. I'll just uh...
start the sweep without you. I'm sure you can catch up. I know you've
been keeping in shape." Dinah smiles then begins walking away from
us. She joked with me. I missed that. I want to follow her now. I
don't fully trust her to be alone, not because I don't trust her I
just don't trust anyone else but Reese has already begun to talk and
I really should be listening to him.</p>
<p>"...Know that you're distracted." He's looking at me like he's
expecting an answer but it's always difficult to answer someone when
you don't even know the question.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry. I need to take care of Dinah now." I hope this
answer satisfies his need for an answer. It seems to fit the
word 'distraction'.</p>
<p>"When are you going to start taking care of yourself?"</p>
<p>Well it seems like my answer was the right one or at least it fit the
question. "When she's better then I'll be fine. I'm sorry I've got to
go now." And before he can say another word I'm gone.</p>
<p>It doesn't take me that long to locate Dinah. She's only a few blocks
away and she's already kicking some poor soul's ass. I'm sure he
deserved it though. Especially since there's two very frightened
individuals standing back watching Dinah pound on their assailant.</p>
<p>Oh look there's another one. He's trying to sneak up behind her, but
I'm there before he even comes close enough to throw one punch. I'm
not going to let anyone ever hurt her again. I can't let her be hurt
again.</p>
<p>The man goes flying into the side of a building and is knocked out.
He's not going to be getting back up. I turn around and notice that
Dinah is now asking the would-be victims if they're alright. The
first time I saw her do that kind of surprised me. I always just
figured the person didn't get robbed, maimed, or hurt in any way then
they were okay and I could move on. If the person was hurt then I
made sure there was an ambulance, but I never tried to help them out
after I saved them.</p>
<p>If they were too scared then Dinah would actually walk them home. If
they were just bleeding slightly then she'd actually tend to their
wounds. She didn't just walk away. She got involved. She cared more
than I ever even considered caring. I was often more concerned with
letting my anger out on some guy who deserved an ass kicking.</p>
<p>"Is everything okay?" I can't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Dinah answers for the pair of still wide-eyed and frightened
girls. "You should really be more careful with who you choose to hang
around." They both look at her then turn their eyes to me. I'm not
too sure whether I should be offended or not.</p>
<p>Dinah smiles for what seems like the tenth time tonight and turns to
look at me. "Oh she's harmless. Nothing but a big harmless kitten."</p>
<p>I raise my brow in response but choose not to make any comment. The
girl does wonders for my reputation. I don't think the girls she's
talking to believe Dinah though. At least they don't look like they
do. But then again, I'm not too sure I'd find someone who jumped off
a building and rammed a man into a wall entirely harmless either.</p>
<p>The girls thank us both once again and then go on with their lives,
as everything should be. Dinah waves to them as they depart then
turns her attention to me.</p>
<p>"Big harmless kitten, huh?" I ask stepping closer to her.</p>
<p>"Yep." She answers flippantly then turns her back to me and starts to
walk away. I stand behind her in shock then shake my head and catch
up to her. I don't know what's gotten into her tonight, but I am very
happy to see that she at least seems to be less morbid than she has
been lately. It's really unfortunate that I know this won't last.
I've only offered her a quick fix. The only way things will get back
to the way they are is if she actually starts talking to Barbara or
myself.</p>
<p>"So what's on the agenda tonight?" She asks me as we walk languidly
down the street.</p>
<p>"I was hoping we could talk?"</p>
<p>Her eyes instantly grow dark and I know I've ruined the night. I've
ruined the chance for her and I to just get out and have fun. I've
ruined our chance to forget, just for a little while that we have
some pretty deep emotional problems that seem to cripple us every
once and a while. But hey, I had to open my mouth. I just couldn't go
on and let the night happen. Fuck me and caring.</p>
<p>"What do you want to talk about?"</p>
<p>Oh hey, she didn't shut me out completely. She's actually giving me
hope that we can talk about something tonight. There are no promises
but at least there's hope. I can live with hope. I can work with
hope.</p>
<p>"I want to talk about what happened that night."</p>
<p>Dinah heaves a big sigh then throws her hand up in the air. "What's
there to talk about? I was shot. I didn't die. It's over."</p>
<p>I just now notice we've stopped walking but for some reason I still
feel like I'm moving. Maybe that's because my head is spinning. I'm
so not in my element here. I'm good at hitting things. I'm not good
at touchy feely conversations especially when my goal is to get
someone else to talk about their feelings.</p>
<p>So okay where to start? What do I say first? "That night scared me
too. I thought maybe you'd be gone forever and I really didn't like
that thought at all." Honesty is always good, right?</p>
<p>"You were scared?"</p>
<p>"Hell yeah. I was fucking terrified. I don't want to lose you." I
stumbled over my words. "You're the only real partner I've had and
well...I don't want to lose you."</p>
<p>Is she crying? Did I say something wrong? Something right? I don't
know what I'm doing. I'm just standing here in the middle of the
night trying my best to help save a person who means more to me than
I think I ever realized. I'm trying to bring my best friend back.</p>
<p>"I don't want to die." She chokes out. "But I don't want you or
Barbara to think I'm weak either."</p>
<p>"Dinah, I'd never think that. I think you're stronger than either of
us. You put your life, heart, and soul on the line all the time. I
can't do that. I really admire you so much for that. You're one of
the strongest women I've ever had the privilege of meeting."</p>
<p>"Really?" She's drying her tears with the back of her hand and I can
no longer hold back my urge to hold her. I need to comfort her. This
is yet another thing I don't understand, but it's also something I'm
not going to fight.</p>
<p>"You're my hero, Dinah." I whisper to her.</p>
<p>"You're my hero too," I hear Barbara say. I almost forgot that she
could still hear us. I'm kind of glad she didn't miss out on this
conversation.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Four">
<p>The only thing I really wonder about, besides why there are so many
stars in the sky, is if it's possible to have a romantic relationship
without really having a romantic relationship with someone. Is it
possible to act like someone's girlfriend and treat someone like a
girlfriend without the physical aspect of the entire romantic
relationship?</p>
<p>She doesn't go out with Reese anymore. She told me things weren't
really working out because she couldn't give herself up to him or
something like that. Actually, I think her exacts were, "He wants
something from me that's not really mine to give away now." I'm not
sure what I'm missing from that statement but I'm sure there's a clue
in there somewhere. I guess I'll figure it out when I figure it out.</p>
<p>We've been hanging out more too. We go out have fun and get away from
the whole superhero thing. When we're not together then I'm thinking
or talking about her. It's kind of weird. Which is my whole point of
wondering about having a romantic relationship without really having
a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>When people at the bar she works at flirt with her I get jealous. Of
course, it's not a secret that I am prone to jealousy but Helena is
the exact same way. If a guy or girl approaches me she makes sure
that they know I'm with her. My only real question is; am I with her
or are we just really good friends? I know I'm not acting like her
sister. At least I wouldn't imagine I'm acting like her sister.</p>
<p>I need help. I think I'm thinking too much. I even think that I'm
thinking too much about thinking too much. Yes I am confused and I
don't know what to do. So tonight I've actually promised myself to
ask Helena what's going on. I'm going to go to her place of
employment sit down at the bar stare at her for a few hours then when
she gets off we'll do our sweeps, hang out, and maybe then I'll
possibly ask her what's going on between us.</p>
<p>No. I have to be firm about this. I have to be committed to getting
answers. Am I sure that I want answers? Well no. But I need to get
answers. I can't continue going on acting like I'm Helena's
girlfriend when I'm not. I either am or I'm not. We either make our
relationship real or continue to pretend like we have one?</p>
<p>No. Firm. I have to be firm. Barbara's advice to me was just to talk
to Helena. I tried to get her to do it, but she wouldn't. I think she
said something about me acting like an adult. I'm not quite sure what
she meant. The least she could have done was be more upfront with me.
She was the one who sought me out to talk about what had been going
on between Helena and me. She wanted answers and when I finally gave
her some or at least told her what I knew, she just kind of rubbed
her head like she had a migraine and told me to figure things out
before something happened.</p>
<p>Okay. So here I am. I just need to walk inside and remember to stay
firm. Firm like steel. Firm like unbreakable things. Firm like
Helena's body. Oh wait. I probably shouldn't be thinking that way
right now.</p>
<p>"Hey," I say to her as I take a seat at the bar. The bouncer doesn't
even ask me for my ID anymore when I come. He knows I'm Helena's
friend and that I'm not here trying to drink underage.</p>
<p>"Hi," Her entire face lights up with her smile and all that firmness
I've been talking about just falls away. I don't really need to know
what's going on. I'm happy with the way things are. Am I still
confused? Sure I am. But I'm often confused. I can deal with
confusion as long as Helena doesn't ever decide to walk out of my
life or go out with anyone else then I'm fine.</p>
<p>"How's it going tonight?" I'm genuinely interested. Helena usually
has some funny anecdote about the patrons of the bar. I've gotten to
know the regulars pretty well.</p>
<p>She shrugs, "Nothing interesting is going on. It's actually been kind
of a slow night considering it's Saturday."</p>
<p>"Do you think it's because of this lizard guy we still don't seem
able to find?" I know this guys been in the back of her mind
recently. This guy doesn't seem to have a motive for anyone he kills
and he attacks randomly. The whole case is really frustrating.</p>
<p>"Could be," she picks up a glass and starts wiping it with the towel
she had draped over her shoulder. "The news is saying there's some
kind of serial killer out there just picking people at random and
killing them."</p>
<p>"That does kind of seem what's happening." I offer.</p>
<p>Helena sighs. "Yeah it does. But I'm sure he has some kind of motive
and we just haven't figured it out yet. There's a link we're missing."</p>
<p>"I know." And I really do know. I feel the exact same way. So does
Barbara. "But if it can be found then we're going to find it."</p>
<p>"Yeah I know," she smiles at me and I know she doesn't want me to
worry about it anymore. "So what's been going on with you? Did you do
anything terribly interesting today?"</p>
<p>"Barbara and I trained for a little while but other than that nothing
happened. Daniel called me again," I couldn't help but add. Daniel
was a Meta that I met at some school assembly that Barbara dragged me
to. He was a really nice guy and he seemed to be interesting but...well
the but was standing right in front of me.</p>
<p>"Did he ask you out?" She tried to hide it but I could hear the soft
growl that escaped from the back of her throat. Helena wasn't a big
fan of Daniel's.</p>
<p>"Yeah he did."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"Well I told him that I wasn't interested."</p>
<p>"Did he push anything?"</p>
<p>"No. He said he understood."</p>
<p>"Good." She says with a satisfied grunt.</p>
<p>I see an opportunity in front of me now and I'm afraid that if I
don't take it then it'll float off to that special place where all
those opportunities I've passed up go to. It's the place where they
retire and come out every once in a while just to mock me.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Helena looks at me confused. "Why what?"</p>
<p>"Why is it good?"</p>
<p>She looks around. I think she's checking out the best escape route
but I don't want her to be able to escape. I want an answer. I
genuinely want to know why it's good I told a relatively handsome guy
that I can't go out with him because I wasn't interested.</p>
<p>"Please Helena, just tell me why it's a good thing," I beg her with
my eyes. I need to know.</p>
<p>She looks around once again then focuses on me. "I don't like the
idea of sharing you."</p>
<p>Okay that could be a positive thing, a little possessive but still
positive. "What does that mean exactly?" My palms are sweating and
I'm surprised I haven't broken any of the bottles lying around this
place yet. I am exercising excellent control.</p>
<p>"It means you're mine. You've got my heart and I can't take it back.
You're mine."</p>
<p>Oh. Well that...I don't know what that is. I'm not going to cry. I'm
not going to cry. I should probably say something to her though. She
just kind of told me that she loves me. I guess I should kind of
return the gesture. "Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels
that way then." Hey that actually sounded kind of cool calm and
collected. "I'd hate to think that you had my heart when I didn't
have yours."</p>
<p>She gives me an impossibly bright smile and I don't want to do
anything else but kiss her. I have to kiss her. I have to do it now.
I have to finally be able to get that feeling from deep down inside
of me out. I'm actually contemplating jumping over the counter but I
end up not having to because Helena does it first. She's standing in
front of me leaning against my legs. I'm thankful that I'm sitting
down because if I were standing then I'd most definitely be falling.
As a matter of fact I wonder if I'm falling anyway.</p>
<p>"Does that mean you love me?" She asks leaning in closer.</p>
<p>"I guess it kind of does. But I think since I've always kind of loved
you it's not that big of a revelation or possibly just the biggest
one of my life."</p>
<p>Finally our lips meet and...it's great. It's perfect. It's...well it's
really damn good. I can't think. I can't really do anything except
feel. I feel her body pressed up against my own. I feel her taste her
touch. I feel nothing but her.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like I've found a bit of myself too. I'm not as lost
anymore and that's a wonderful, fantastic, terrific, and stupefying
feeling. I didn't know that it'd be possible for me to feel at least
partially complete at such a young age.</p>
<p>When we finally break apart I immediately look into her eyes. I need
to know if what we shared really meant as much to her as it did to
me. I want to share my feelings I want to share everything with her
and I see she wants the same thing from me. She wants to solidify
that connection we've had since before I ever came to this city.</p>
<p>We manage to tell each other that we love each other at the same
time. Then we giggle. Then I start feeling kind of shy. I don't know
what to do now. I want to kiss her again, I'd kind of like to kiss
her forever, but I don't think me laying her out on the bar would be
entirely appropriate. I haven't felt like this before. I can actually
feel her inside of me. That piece of her very unique energy is stuck
right in the pit of my stomach and it makes me feel all warm and
fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>"So..." I'm not entirely in favor of silence right now. I need to hear
her voice.</p>
<p>She clears her throat. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"What do we do now?" She's had to have experience in this area
before. I haven't. Well more accurately I have, but I don't think
that one really counts. I was just fifteen about to turn sixteen and
Katie was just my last ditch effort to be happy in a place where I
knew I didn't belong.</p>
<p>"I say we do more of this," Helena breaks me from my thoughts and
fear. Her lips are pressed to mine again but for way too short of a
time. "But other than that I don't know. I'm not an expert here."</p>
<p>"So we just continue to be together?" I ask unable to resist the urge
any longer to wrap my arms around her waist and bring her even closer
to me.</p>
<p>"That's all I want."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Me too."</p>
<p>"Hey Helena are you going to start working again sometime tonight or
should I just get my own drink? Oh and I'd like to have the same
exact service as she's having." Jared, a regular calls out to her.</p>
<p>For the first time Helena breaks eye contact with me and responds to
the restless man, "You wish." She turns her attention back to
me. "Are you going to stay the whole night?"</p>
<p>"I planned on it. I don't want to do sweeps alone."</p>
<p>Helena smiles then jumps back over the counter. I don't remember the
last time we actually did sweeps apart. We were partners now and
partners don't work alone. It was against the superhero rules or
something. She begins filling the drink requests that surround her
and I sit back and watch.</p>
<p>Barbara then interrupts my own form of entertainment when her voice
trickles through my Helena haze and straight into my ear. "Canary you
there?"</p>
<p>My best guess is that this isn't just a friendly call. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You need to go out and meet Reece. He's got another body."</p>
<p>"The lizard guy?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Barbara sounds just about the same way I feel: frustrated and
defeated.</p>
<p>"Damn."</p>
<p>"Just do the regular tests and bring them back here. Maybe this time
we'll find something different." Barbara then proceeds to tell me
where to me Reece and wishes me good luck. I can tell that she's
trying to give me some hope that this guy hasn't beaten us yet, and I
know he hasn't. We'll stop him. I know we will. I just don't want
anyone else to die.</p>
<p>I turn to Helena and she's looking over at me knowing that I've been
called away. "Do you need me to go with you?"</p>
<p>I want her to but I know that she has to work. Plus, it's just Reece
and another poisoned body. I can handle that. So, I shake my
head. "No. I can take care of it. Reece has another one."</p>
<p>Helena hesitates but I lean over the bar and put my fingers to her
very soft lips. "I can take care of it."</p>
<p>We have a short staring contest but Helena eventually backs
off. "Fine but be careful and don't let Reese push you around."</p>
<p>"I'll be careful and I won't let Reece push me around." I
promise. "I'm just going to get some more samples anyway. I don't
think anything's going to happen." I lean forward and give her a
quick kiss. "I've got to go. Be good." I smile and let my eyes linger
just a little too long then turn around and make my way to Detective
Reece to go look at another dead body. There are certainly some
downsides to being a superhero.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Detective Reece is keeping watch over the body when I approach him.
He looks surprised to see me and I can understand why since Helena is
usually the one that meets up with him. Every time we get together
there's awkwardness. I think it's mostly because I was insanely
jealous of him for a while and because of his father. Plus, I don't
really think we work too well together. Sure, he's watched my back
and I've watched his but there's just not that thing. It's the thing
that makes Helena and I such good partners. We have the thing. With
Reese and me there's no thing.</p>
<p>"Hey," I say kind of shyly and tuck a strand of my hair behind my
ear. It's a nervous gesture that I keep on promising myself I'll get
rid of eventually.</p>
<p>"Uh...hi." He's such an articulate man. I can see what Helena saw in
him. Of course what she saw in him really doesn't matter now because
she's not with him. She's with me. I wonder if now is a good time to
fill him in on the news. "Where's Helena?" He looks behind me like he
just expects her to pop out from nowhere, which is possible, but it's
not going to happen.</p>
<p>"Busy." I look down at the body. "Anything different about this one?"</p>
<p>"No." Reece sighs heavily. He's probably just as frustrated as the
rest of us about this. "Everything is the same. Same poison, same
everything."</p>
<p>I lean down and take yet another sample for Barbara to
analyze. "Maybe something will turn up this time though."</p>
<p>"Has Oracle found out anything?"</p>
<p>I shake my head. "We're just as lost as you are." I turn to look at
him and catch a movement in the corner of my eye. When I do a very
quick double take I can barely see a shadow cast by the street lamp.
As soon as whatever it is knows that I can see it, it turns around
and begins to run. I hurriedly shove the sample I've just taken into
my jacket and take off after the shadow.</p>
<p>I can still barely see them in the night. Whatever it is is
incredibly fast. I hear Reese calling me from behind but I keep on
running. If I can just catch up with whoever this is maybe this will
all end or maybe we'll actually get somewhere. Right when I think
I've actually gained some ground on the figure it disappears. I'm
left standing in an alley alone.</p>
<p>There's a slight rustling sound to my left. I turn and am not
surprised when I see nothing. It's weird but I can actually feel
something here. I know it's around me, but I can't pinpoint where it
is. Reese has finally caught up with me and is gasping for air while
he tries to ask me what I'm doing.</p>
<p>There it is behind him. I think it's trying to get away. Oh wait it's
not. My eyes go wide when I realize it's going to go after
Reese. "Get out of the way!" I yell at him and make a desperate dive
to move him away from the figure next to and slightly behind him.</p>
<p>As I reach Reese I see some liquid being shot at us both. I do my
best to twist us both away from the spray. We hit the ground hard and
I know I'm going to have a few bruises that will only feel better
once Helena kisses them away. When I get a chance to look up I move
my head frantically searching for the dark figure that I never really
could see, but unfortunately now I can.</p>
<p>She's looking straight down at us and her eyes are red and have an
odd reptilian shape. Reece is trying to push me away from him but I
resist. I'm afraid if I move then she'll do something like try and
spit nasty poison at me again. I am beginning to think that it
probably would have been a good idea to listen to Barbara when she
told me to pick up the antidote she had made for the poison on my way
out.</p>
<p>"Dinah get off me," Reese tries to order me.</p>
<p>"Shut up." I tell him but keep my eyes trained on the woman above us.</p>
<p>She smiles at me and reaches out her hand. This may sound crazy, but
I don't trust her. I don't want to offend her by not taking her hand
though so I take her hand hoping that my skin doesn't start burning
and that I don't start dying. To my surprise nothing happens. And I
really mean nothing happens. I don't even get any type of vision from
her. Nothing.</p>
<p>"I have no quarrels with you," she informs me. "If you had not
cornered me then I wouldn't have attacked you."</p>
<p>Oh yes well that makes me feel so much better. "But you've killed all
those people."</p>
<p>"It was necessary."</p>
<p>"Necessary?" Reese and I ask at the same time.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to put you under arrest," Reese says and even I
know that's certainly not the best thing he could have said at a time
such as this.</p>
<p>The woman does nothing but laugh.</p>
<p>"Why did you do it?" I ask instead ignoring Reese's hurt pride.</p>
<p>"It was necessary." She repeats.</p>
<p>"Canary?" Barbara's voice filters through my comm. set. "Is
everything okay?"</p>
<p>I don't know how I should respond to that right now, so I don't.</p>
<p>"If you let me go then I'll let you live."</p>
<p>"We can't do that," I tell her knowing that she probably already knew
what I'd say.</p>
<p>"Fine." She shrugs and her skin becomes darker. It's quite
interesting really. She doesn't really change to blend in with her
surroundings; she just kind of gets darker. I'm sure this isn't a
good thing, but it's still interesting.</p>
<p>I get into a fighting stance, hoping that she doesn't decide to spit
anymore poison at me. We circle each other and Reese moves off to the
side. His hand moves to his gun and he begins to pull it out slowly
but this reptilian woman sees him and quickly spits some more of her
very special saliva in his direction. This time, she actually hits
him but this distraction gives me a chance to concentrate hard enough
on throwing the woman into a wall. I've been becoming quite good at
that lately.</p>
<p>"Oracle," I scream into my comm. set. "Reese got hit with the poison.
I need the antidote and an ambulance."</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" She asks and I can tell she's worried. "What
happened?"</p>
<p>"Our lizard guy is actually a lizard girl. She's knocked out for the
moment, but I think she might be waking up soon." I can actually
already begin to see her stirring. "Get Huntress here quick."</p>
<p>I turn away from Reese and look around desperately trying to find
something I can use to cover this woman's mouth. During my search I
fail to notice that she has already recovered. For some reason, I
don't fully understand, she doesn't try to kill me with her poison
she just kicks me in the back and starts to run off. I know I should
chase after her, but I don't want to leave Reese alone. Damn it.</p>
<p>"Oracle where's Huntress?"</p>
<p>"She's on her way. So is the ambulance. Is everything okay?"</p>
<p>"No. She got away."</p>
<p>Moments later Helena is by my side over Reese with the antidote. She
follows Barbara's instructions on how to give it to Reese, which
really isn't that difficult. It mostly just consists of stick needle
in arm and push down. The ambulance arrives and Reese is on his away
to the hospital. He'll most likely live.</p>
<p>Helena and I watch the ambulance pull away. She's standing next to me
and her arm is wrapped around my waist. "Are you okay?" She asks as
we stare at the fading red and white lights.</p>
<p>"I let her get away."</p>
<p>"You did fine. So what she got away. At least you're alive and Reese
isn't going to die. Plus, now we know who our mystery lizard is."</p>
<p>"When did you become so optimistic?" I turn in her arms so that I'm
no longer facing the street but facing her.</p>
<p>She smirks. "I don't know."</p>
<p>There's silence now and I'm just happy to be in Helena's arms. I'm
safe in them and after thinking that I was going to die for a while
earlier I'm happy that she's here.</p>
<p>"So are you ready to go see how Reese is doing?" Helena asks me.</p>
<p>I know we should go to the hospital. He is kind of our semi-
partner. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Be careful out there tonight ladies," Oracle calls to us through the
comm. set. "Remember that woman is still loose. And tell Reese that I
hope he starts to feel better. I'll be checking up on the city while
you're there."</p>
<p>With Oracle watching out for us from above we begin to make our way
to the hospital. I think it's going to be a long night.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Five">
<p>My fingers are all taken up now. I don't mean that in some hot freaky
sex way either. I mean that I've been terrified so many times now in
my life that I have no more fingers left over. There's when my mom
died. There's when Barbara took me in. There's when Dinah came and
changed my entire world, then when Dinah got shot, then when I
admitted to Dinah that she was my hero, then when Dinah told me she
loved me, then when I kissed Dinah, then the moment after I kissed
Dinah, then when Barbara contacted me and told me Dinah was in need
of assistance because of the lizard lady, then when I actually
arrived which seemed like it took days to do and found her leaning
over Reese's body, then the moment after the ambulance left because I
didn't know what to say or how she felt or what to do.</p>
<p>I've actually run out of fingers. I'll have to start counting on my
toes or something. I've officially gone crazy now. I don't know what
to do. My world is spinning in all kinds of directions and I have no
fucking clue what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I mean what I am doing is illegal, isn't it? Dinah is still only
seventeen. Of course she'll be eighteen pretty soon so that really
isn't that big of a problem. All I have to do is have no sexual
relations with her until she's of legal age. I can do that. I have
self-control. I can play the part of Clinton. Oh wait...Clinton
actually did have sexual relations didn't he? Well then I can be
better than Clinton. I'll do a better job of hiding it?</p>
<p>Okay I really can't think this way. I have to be stoic and not let my
lust consume me. I'm not really an animal, despite what some of my
previous uh...acquaintances might say. I wonder if Dinah would like me
to be an animal with her though. Does she expect it from me? I know
there's a side of her that is just as feral as I can be. She doesn't
show it often but when she does...</p>
<p>I was supposed to be talking myself into no sexual relations wasn't
I? What am I trying to do to myself? Commit suicide by heat
exhaustion.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Dinah asks me as she walks to the
fridge. "You kind of looked like you were having some uh...serious
thoughts." She turns around with a carton of orange juice in her hand
and a knowing smirk on her face.</p>
<p>Yeah I was having serious thoughts of...I don't even think I should
finish that thought in my head. "I was thinking about that you should
be at school. You do have school today right?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh." She nods. "I'm waiting for Barbara to finish getting ready
and that's so not what you were thinking about."</p>
<p>"Well," I chuckle, "I was thinking about you."</p>
<p>I wasn't quite aware of the fact that she could blush like that.
That's a very endearing shade of red. I wonder if she turns that same
shade of red when she...no. No. I'm not supposed to think about that.
I'm the adult in this relationship. I need to be the responsible one.
Wait. When the hell have I ever been the responsible one? I'm never
the responsible one. I'm the one that goes out and does whatever the
hell she wants then faces the consequences later or just ignores the
consequences altogether.</p>
<p>Now however, now I think everything is different. My life is changing
and I'm changing and my world is spinning and I'm just along for the
ride. I actually think Barbara would call this progress. Speaking of...</p>
<p>"Have you two finished with your morning flirting session or should I
just come back in a couple of minutes?"</p>
<p>"Oh was that a joke from the ever serious Barbara Gordon?" I ask
trying to hide the fact that her hearing Dinah and me makes me
slightly uncomfortable. I haven't really gotten a chance to discuss
the entire Dinah and me thing with her yet, so I really don't know
what she thinks and I really need to know what she thinks.</p>
<p>"I'm capable of grasping the concept of humor every once and a
while," She responds quickly. Despite what some people might think,
Barbara can hold her own very well. I don't often like getting in a
verbal spar with her because she wins most of the time and I'm not a
big fan of losing. It does bad things to my complexion.</p>
<p>"Well then..." Damn it. I'm sure I'll think of the perfect thing to say
when she walks out the door. What's Dinah laughing about? I'm sure
she couldn't think of anything either.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to go?" Dinah asks. "I don't want you using up all
your grasping power of humor this morning. You'll get a chance to
recharge at school."</p>
<p>Barbara just shakes her head turns herself around and goes towards
the elevator. Dinah follows but before she leaves she bends down and
gives me a quick peck on the lips. I want her touch to linger longer
but if it did I'm not too sure she'd make it to school and school is
important. At least, it's important to Dinah. She actually cares
about her future. She cares a lot more about hers than I did about
mine when I was in school.</p>
<p>"I'll see you when I get home," She calls out to me. "I love you."</p>
<p>I take a quick look at Barbara to see how she responds to the
endearment and I see nothing but an indulgent smile covering her
features. Maybe she could actually possibly maybe support what's
happening between Dinah and me or maybe she just doesn't want to say
anything now and is waiting to get me in a room alone to beat me up.
Still, I can't have my girl thinking that I don't love her too no
matter what Barbara thinks.</p>
<p>"I love you too. Be safe."</p>
<p>And then they're gone. They're off to play the roles of the daytime
Barbara and Dinah and I'm left to sit around here and...well and go
back to bed. It's way too damn early for me to even be up. Why am I
up anyway?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. I'm up because I wanted to see Dinah off to school. I wanted
to get a chance to see her before she had to go out into the
daylight. I needed to hear her say she loved me and I needed to tell
her in return.</p>
<p>What the hell has this girl done to me?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Okay so Dinah doesn't come home for another couple of hours I guess I
could waste my time by going to see Reese again in the hospital. He's
had a hard time with recovery. Apparently the poison he was exposed
to attacked his nervous system and it's been taking a few days for
him to get the feeling back in his body. If I hadn't given him the
antidote when I did it's quite possible that he would never be able
to walk again.</p>
<p>This may sound harsh, but I'm very glad that he was the one that got
hit with that poison instead of Dinah. I never want her to go through
that kind of pain. I wouldn't wish it on Reese either, of course but
if I had to make a choice...Reese would lose every time. He has lost
every time already.</p>
<p>I gave my heart to Dinah, actually I think she took it without me
realizing it and by the time I realized she had it I didn't really
mind. She also made me her partner in the whole crime-fighting scene.
Reese and I get along. We work well together but I would never call
him my partner. Everything that he could have gotten from me, that he
probably would have gotten from me if Dinah wasn't here, he's never
going to get. The only reason I tried to get something to happen
before was because I felt like I wanted something more in my life and
I thought Reese would be a good place to start, and he probably was a
good place to start. He was just a practice run until the real thing
came along or at least until I realized that the real thing was
standing right in front of me.</p>
<p>Through the window of the hospital door I can see Reese lying down.
I'm not quite sure how much movement he has recovered but Barbara
thinks it'll all come back eventually. This has to be hard on him. I
know I'd go crazy just sitting around waiting to be able to get back
up. Plus, Reese really doesn't have anyone. His mother came by a few
times and a couple of his cop buddies, but he really doesn't have
anyone by his side to stay with him through the night.</p>
<p>I know that at least if this had happened to me, Dinah and Barbara
would be in that room with me until I got up again. They'd stay and
take all the shit I'd throw that them through my frustration. Of
course, they'd probably throw some shit back at me. They wouldn't
give me that much leeway in pushing them around and pushing them
away.</p>
<p>Slowly I open the door to the hospital room. Reese turns to me and
grins. He doesn't want to show anyone how much he's hurting yet. I
know that he doesn't ever want to show me that he can be weak. He's
always had this macho man complex ever since we've met. I've always
just accepted it and let him act however the hell he wants.
Eventually he'll learn that I won't judge him just because he's human
and is capable of feeling pain.</p>
<p>"So how are...things?" I ask him as I approach the bed. "You ready to
get back out on the streets yet?"</p>
<p>"I was ready three days ago," He answers with a soft smile.</p>
<p>"Can you walk yet?"</p>
<p>"I've upgraded to a hobble."</p>
<p>I shake my head but can't stop the smirk that comes to cover my
face. "I guess that's progress."</p>
<p>Silence falls between us, but that's mostly because I don't have
anything else to say and whatever it is he wants to ask me he doesn't
have the courage to ask. I know he's wanted to say something to me
the past few days, but he hasn't done it yet. I've given him chances
but he doesn't take them.</p>
<p>"So..." he begins, "what's Canary and Oracle up to?"</p>
<p>I don't know why he insists on calling Dinah Canary still. He knows
her name. They've been introduced properly. I mean, with Barbara it's
different. She's still Oracle to him. That's all she's ever been to
him and most likely that's all she'll ever be to him. It may not seem
like it purely on the surface but Barbara is ten times more guarded
than I am.</p>
<p>"They're fine I guess." I shrug. "Just living out their daily lives."</p>
<p>"And what would that be?"</p>
<p>I grin. "A daytime school teacher and student."</p>
<p>He snorts. "Fine don't tell me. It's not that important."</p>
<p>Silence comes again and I'm contemplating leaving. He looks alive and
well, which is all I wanted to check up on.</p>
<p>"Okay so I'm going to leave," I say pointing to the door. "If you
need anything you know which button to press." I turn to walk out the
door but Reese reaches out and grabs my arm. I turn around slowly
with my brow raised waiting for him to give me a reason for why he
doesn't want me leaving.</p>
<p>"I think it's time I tell you thank you for saving my life," he
eventually says. "If you hadn't of came with the antidote...well things
would have turned out a whole hell of a lot worse than they did."</p>
<p>"You don't need to thank me," I tell him. "Dinah's the one who got me
there. She's the one who pushed you down when that woman was going to
attack you. I didn't do anything but show up, Dinah did the heroic
stuff." I'm going to give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you were still there." He argues. "You showed up and
you've been here for me ever since. That means a lot to me."</p>
<p>Are we about to have a moment? I really don't want to have a moment
with him. Not now. "Well...it's kind of what I do. If it makes you feel
any better then I'm glad you're not dead."</p>
<p>"Truthfully?" He grins. "It doesn't completely suck to know."</p>
<p>Then again there is silence. I don't know what to say at this point.
I'm ready to leave. Dinah will be back home soon and I want to be
there when she arrives.</p>
<p>"Do you ever think that we could try again?"</p>
<p>Why? Why does he have to bring this up? Can't he be satisfied in
knowing that I don't want him dead? Despite what some people may
think I do not like kicking people when they're down. Unless, of
course, they've been especially naughty.</p>
<p>"Reese," His eyes go dark immediately and I can see he's
withdrawing. "I think you're a nice guy, I really do but it's not
going to happen."</p>
<p>"Is there someone else or is it just me? Do you blame me for who my
father is?"</p>
<p>Okay where the hell did that come from? When was the last time I ever
said anything to him about his father?</p>
<p>"Of course that isn't it." Seriously where did he come up with
that? "I don't blame you for your father's mistakes. I'm the last
person that can go blaming people for what they're parents have done."</p>
<p>He raises his brow. "Then there's someone else?"</p>
<p>"Can't it just be that I don't think we'd work out?"</p>
<p>"But I think we would."</p>
<p>I drop my head. I don't want to look into his eyes anymore. "Reese.
There's someone else."</p>
<p>"Are you just lying to me now to get me to back off?" He sounds like
he's getting angry.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't..."</p>
<p>"Lie?" He finishes for me. "Of course you would. You're so concerned
with keeping your secrets and not letting anyone in that you don't
even think twice about lying. Are you honest with anyone?"</p>
<p>If he had told me this a couple of months ago then I probably would
have agreed with him, but now he's just wrong. He's so wrong that
it's not even funny how wrong he is. Plus who is he to say something
like that to me? So we went out a few times that doesn't mean he
knows me. He doesn't know me. He'll never know me.</p>
<p>I'm going to respond but Dinah comes into the room carrying a teddy
bear. She stops in the doorway when she realizes that I'm in the
room. She looks from me to Reese and I'm sure she can feel the
tension that surrounds us.</p>
<p>"Did I come at a bad time?" She asks as she slowly begins to back out
of the room. "I can always come back later."</p>
<p>"No it's fine." I tell her. I don't want to be left alone with Reese
any longer. He can believe whatever he wants. I have nothing to prove
to him. The only people I owe explanations or answers to are Dinah
and Barbara.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" She asks uncertainly. "I don't want to interrupt."</p>
<p>"Dinah it's fine. Come in." Reese calls from the bed. "Helena and I
were just discussing your daytime activities. She refuses to tell me
what you do all day."</p>
<p>Dinah smiles awkwardly then takes a good look at herself. She's
wearing her backpack still and along with the teddy bear in her arms
she has what appears to be a textbook. Maybe Reese isn't as good as a
detective as any of us thought. "Yeah well secret identity and all."
She finally says and approaches the bed. She holds the bear out to
Reese which he takes clumsily. His motor functions aren't quite where
they normally are. "So are you feeling better?"</p>
<p>"Like I told Helena, I've got a good hobbling going on."</p>
<p>Dinah chuckles politely. "Well that's good." She places her hand on
his shoulder. "I'm really glad you're making progress. We need you
well."</p>
<p>I know she still feels guilty about what has happened to him. That's
something that I'll probably never be able to take away from her.
She'll have to work it out on her own. Hopefully one day she'll
understand that we can't save everyone all the time. We both may be
superheroes but we're not God. Hopefully, one day I'll understand
that too. We can actually work on it together.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Reese clears his throat. "Thanks for the bear."</p>
<p>"It's nothing."</p>
<p>Well I certainly need to get out of this room now. "So get to feeling
better soon. Dinah's right, we do kind of need you well."</p>
<p>Reese nods. "I will."</p>
<p>"You ready to go?" I ask turning to Dinah. I know that she has to be
as uncomfortable as I am.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She grabs my hand. "We'll be back tonight after sweeps," she
tells Reese then pulls me out of the room.</p>
<p>My eyes connect with Reese's before I make it out of the room and I'm
not too sure what to make of the look he's giving me. He may think
that we have something else to talk about, but we don't. I've said my
part. He either accepts it or he doesn't.</p>
<p>"I didn't really expect to see you here." Dinah says as soon as the
door to the room is closed. She almost sounds kind of jealous.</p>
<p>"I figured I'd check up on him. He's going through a tough time and I
know he could use some friends." I want to cross my arms in front of
me to emphasis my next point but I don't want to let go of Dinah's
hand so as a compromise I pull her closer to me. "What are you doing
here?"</p>
<p>She holds my gaze then turns her eyes to floor or more accurately my
cleavage. "The same as you."</p>
<p>With my free hand I grab her chin and gently force her to look into
my eyes again. "I told him there's someone else. He doesn't believe
me, but it doesn't matter. I don't love him."</p>
<p>She unexpectedly pulls me to her in a tight hug. "I know I'm being
stupid, but I can't help it," she whispers into my ear.</p>
<p>When she pulls back I kiss her tenderly. "No you're not. You're being
concerned even though you don't have a reason to be."</p>
<p>"You mean stupid?" She asks with her brow raised.</p>
<p>"Concerned."</p>
<p>"Stupid?"</p>
<p>"Concerned."</p>
<p>"Stu..." Before she can finish I lean in and kiss her. It's a good way
to get her to be quiet and an equally good way to let her know I love
her.</p>
<p>As I pull away I whisper softly, "Concerned."</p>
<p>She nods. "Concerned," then leans in and kisses me again. When we
break apart that's when I realize that we're still standing in the
hospital right in front of Reese's door. Right in front of the door
that has a window that I used to look in on Reese with when I first
arrived. I turn to the window now and see Reese staring at us.</p>
<p>"Shit," I drop my gaze away.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>I just nod my head in the direction of the window. "Oh."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Do you think we should go back inside?" She asks unsure.</p>
<p>I shake my head. "No. I told him there was someone else."</p>
<p>"And Reese and I got along so splendidly before," Dinah falls into me
and puts her head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. He would have found out eventually."</p>
<p>"Yeah," she sighs. "So can we go home now?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I put my arm around her shoulders and guide her towards
the exit of the hospital. I feel bad for Reese but...I don't love him.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Six">
<p>The only thing I wish for all my students is happiness. The same
holds true for Dinah and Helena. I only wish them happiness. I can
take them only so far they have to take those big leaps in life
alone. Well, in their case they've decided to take the big leaps
alone together.</p>
<p>I know Helena wants to ask me about how I feel about her relationship
with Dinah. I think she ultimately wants approval from me, and it's
terribly difficult for me to admit this, but I won't give it. It's
not that I don't support their relationship, because I've seen the
changes come over them both and I know that they have all been
positive, but I want Helena to not want my approval about this. I
want her to break away and take her stand and remain strong on this
one thing that I hope and wish she will fight for. I want her to look
at the relationship she has with Dinah and not care what I think. I
only want her to care about her own happiness.</p>
<p>I support this change in her life. I've supported most changes in her
life. How could I not? When I see how far she has come I am left in
awe. I know that I can't take away the pain that her mother's death
has caused her-- that was never my purpose in her life-- my part was
to only help guide her through the tough times and keep her alive
until someone who could open her heart up again came along.</p>
<p>I know my place in her life and that has always been to be her mentor
and friend. I love her. I love her just like I've grown to love
Dinah. These two young ladies are my family and I love my family. I
will do whatever is within my power to keep them safe and give them
some form of happiness.</p>
<p>I'm the big bad Oracle and my job is to keep them safe. Helena just
thinks I'm on a superhero, altruistic high that I just do the crime
fighting because it's the right thing to do, and that is kind of
true. It's also true that I do what I do for very selfish reasons. Of
course I want to keep the city safe but I also want to take all those
bastards who decide to ruin peoples lives off the street so that my
family will be safe.</p>
<p>It probably sounds weird especially since I send my family out every
night to confront those bastards head on. I put my girls in danger
knowingly. I understand something about reality, however, that I'm
not too sure everyone gets. Locking Helena and Dinah away in a room
doesn't guarantee them a long and happy life. It guarantees them
nothing and it guarantees me nothing, but by getting them out there
and fighting for their own happiness...that will get them somewhere.
Even if they get hurt-- and I always feel guilty when they get hurt--
I'll have given them something to hold onto in their lives. They'll
be able to sit back and say that they did something in this world to
gain their happiness. They chased their own dreams and conquered
them.</p>
<p>I wish I could still be out there standing with them conquering all
our dreams, but I am Oracle now. I see all and know all. I am
supposed to know the past, present and future and amazingly enough I
actually do. I know my own past. I know my own present and I know
that the future will be a better place because Huntress and Canary
wish it so.</p>
<p>"Uh...Barbara?" Helena calls from my doorway. "Can I talk to you for a
second?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I take my attention away from the papers I'm supposed to
be grading and give it to her. "What do you need? And where's Dinah?"</p>
<p>"A friend called for her and they went out," she points in the
general direction of where 'out' might be. "I'm meeting up with her
later for sweeps. I kind of wanted to talk to you."</p>
<p>She's nervous and I already know what this conversation is going to
be about. She's finally gathered her courage and is ready to accept
whatever it is I say to her. I know she'd eventually come around.</p>
<p>"So what do you want to talk about? Are you still worried about our
mystery lizard lady?" Ever since Dinah's encounter with our reptilian
foe Helena has been kind of on edge. We all have been actually. No
more deaths have occurred, but she's still out there so we still are
going to have to find her.</p>
<p>Helena crosses her arms in front of her. She's hugging herself. "Well
yeah that still does kind of bother me but I know we'll get her
eventually. I mean you're working on it, right? So it's all good."</p>
<p>I smirk and nod. "Yeah sure. So what is it you wanted to talk about?"</p>
<p>"Dinah?"</p>
<p>"Is that a question?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head so fast I'm afraid it might fall off. "No...no not
at all. I want to talk about Dinah, Dinah and me actually. Well
really about Dinah and me and you."</p>
<p>"I'm not into that sort of thing," I try to lighten the mood. "And I
love you both dearly but you're just not my type."</p>
<p>Helena looks at me confused then that confusion turns to surprise
then finally I get that grin I was after. "I'm not too good at
sharing."</p>
<p>"Well I don't want you to share." We smile at each other and the
cloud of tension that Helena brought in the room with her fades a
little. "So what about you and Dinah...and me?"</p>
<p>She sighs then throws her hands up in the air as if she has made some
great decision, which she probably has. "Do you care about it?"</p>
<p>"Do I care?"</p>
<p>"Yeah do you care? Do you have a problem with it? You for it? Against
it? What?"</p>
<p>"Are you happy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah...?" She answers uncertainly.</p>
<p>"Is Dinah happy?"</p>
<p>"As far as I know. I hope she is."</p>
<p>"Then tell me Helena, what does it matter what I think?"</p>
<p>"Because you're you. It matters."</p>
<p>"If I said I didn't approve would you love Dinah any less?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head.</p>
<p>"If I said that I don't want you ever seeing her again, would you
listen?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head again.</p>
<p>"Then what does it matter?"</p>
<p>She drops her shoulders defeated. "I don't know. It doesn't change
anything but you...well you're really damn important to Dinah and me
and we want you to support us."</p>
<p>"Dinah already knows how I feel." And she does. We've never talked
about it but I know she knows.</p>
<p>Helena stares at me for a while then finally just decides to provoke
more of an answer out of me. "And how you feel is..."</p>
<p>I look at my lap for a moment gathering my thoughts then capture her
gaze again. "I feel that you deserve happiness and I'm very happy
that you've found it."</p>
<p>"So is that your way of saying that you approve?"</p>
<p>"Well I don't necessarily disapprove," Helena smiles and is about to
say something but I hold out my hand to forestall her speech, "But I
want you to understand that Dinah is young and you both don't have a
lot of experience so be careful with each other. And I also would
like you to understand that when you're out being Canary and Huntress
you can't let personal feelings get in the way," those are easier
words to say than they are to live by, "you should also know that
your relationship with Dinah may not last, but your partnership has
to."</p>
<p>Helena's face falls and she gets that introspective look on her face
that comes along when she really has to think about something. I know
she's been living in the haze of new love and I don't want to bring
her out of it so soon, but she needs to know.</p>
<p>"But I love her." She sounds like she's pleading with me to tell her
that this fairy tale love story she has will last until the world
ends, but I can't do that. I wish that for her. I wish that for them
both, but I can't do that.</p>
<p>"Life isn't like the songs, Helena. Love's important. Loving her is
very important and it'll get you a long way, but you need more than
love. You need commitment, honesty, openness, trust...Helena you just
need a lot of things to make sure that this lasts. Ultimately, love
can only take you so far. You and Dinah can only get to happily ever
after if that's what you truly desire and are willing to work for,
because Helena it won't be easy. You both lead dangerous lives. Dinah
is growing up and soon she might want to go away to school. There are
just so many things that you'll have to work around and work through."</p>
<p>"But I love her." She tells me again with more steel in her voice. "I
love her and I'm not going to let go and I won't let her let go
either. We're going to be together because that's just the way it has
to be. Even if something happens..." Her voice trails off and she looks
away, "If something happens to her then we'll always be together. So
I don't care what you say and I know it'll be hard. When hasn't it
been? No matter what we'll make it."</p>
<p>I look at her and I expect her to turn away from me but she doesn't.
She doesn't back down. "In that case then I fully support your
relationship with Dinah."</p>
<p>"Well good then."</p>
<p>We continue to stare at each other again. Her body is tense and I
think she's in need of release. She's been tense ever since she's
entered this room and our conversation had done nothing to ease up
her disposition. I don't know what else I should tell her. She's in
her relationship with Dinah for all the right reasons and there's no
circumstance in which I would not support them. They will always have
my support.</p>
<p>The Delphi alert sounds and I can only hope that this will be
Helena's chance to get some of her stress out. We're all in need of
some relief right now. The week has been...if nothing else complicated.</p>
<p>Helena and I make our way to Oracle's work area. I check out the
alarm and see that this time it's Dinah searching for me instead of
Reese. I'd be surprised if it were Reese though; he's still in the
hospital.</p>
<p>"Canary you need something?" I ask calmly. I know Helena is already
worried even though she hasn't said anything aloud yet.</p>
<p>"You could say that," Dinah's voice filters into the room.</p>
<p>"Well...?"</p>
<p>"I seem to be having a slight problem." She responds. "I'm uh...well...
I'm stuck."</p>
<p>"Stuck?" Helena and I ask together.</p>
<p>"Yes I'm stuck."</p>
<p>"Stuck where?" Helena and I ask in sync once again.</p>
<p>"A window." She responds softly. "At a bar."</p>
<p>"A window?" Helena and I say together once again except this time I
give her a look that clearly conveys my need for her to remain silent.</p>
<p>"Okay Dinah." I sigh softly. "Exactly what window at what bar are you
stuck in and why are you stuck in a window?"</p>
<p>"Does it really matter? Can't you just send Helena over here and get
her to get me off. I'm at that bar that's down the street from
Gibson's."</p>
<p>"You want me to send Helena over to get you off?" I ask not even
trying to hide the smirk that come over my face.</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm very uncomfortable and...Oracle this is so not the time to be
making jokes." I turn to Helena and she nods her head and is gone
within seconds.</p>
<p>"Helena is on her way." I tell her and can easily hear the sigh of
relief Dinah gives. "So do you want to tell me how you got stuck in
the window? You've got a good five minutes until Helena gets there."</p>
<p>"I was trying to escape through the bathroom window." She answers as
if it should be blatantly obvious to me.</p>
<p>"Oh...so why are you trying to escape?"</p>
<p>"Because that guy's not taking no for an answer."</p>
<p>"What guy?"</p>
<p>"The guy that Amber's trying to hook me up with."</p>
<p>I guess we're going to have to play twenty questions. "Who's Amber
and why is she trying to hook you up with a guy and why don't you
just tell her you're with someone else?"</p>
<p>"Amber's that girl from school who's in my English class. You've met
her. And I have told her I'm with someone else but she says I need to
explore all my horizons."</p>
<p>"Okay. So why did you agree to meet with her tonight if you knew that
she was trying to hook you up with someone?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know."</p>
<p>"So when you figured out that she was hooking you up with someone
else why didn't you just leave."</p>
<p>She's silent for a long time then eventually sighs. "That probably
would have been a better thing to do then trying to escape through
the bathroom window."</p>
<p>"Yes it would have been."</p>
<p>"I don't need you yelling at me, once Helena gets here I'm sure I'll
be hearing enough from her."</p>
<p>"Fine. You won't hear anything else from me about trying to run away
from your friends by going out a bathroom window. But I do have
another question for you."</p>
<p>I know she's thinking about telling me that I can't ask it, but she's
not that brave yet. "What?" She snaps.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you doing in a bar?"</p>
<p>"Oh hey Helena's here now, I think I should probably go." She
switches off her comm. set and I curse the day when Helena taught her
how to do that. Fortunately however, Helena still has her set on and
I can still hear what's going on. I choose to remain silent so that
Helena doesn't turn off hers as well. It really doesn't matter what
they say though, Dinah is still going to be grounded.</p>
<p>"Damn, how'd you ever get in that position?" I hear Helena ask.</p>
<p>I can only catch the last part of Dinah's answer which sounds a
little something like, "talent to bend this way."</p>
<p>To which Helena replies, "How do you know I can't?"</p>
<p>I really don't want to listen in on this. "Helena just get her the
hell out of there and back here."</p>
<p>"Fine. We'll be back in a few." Then Helena shuts me out too. I
should really give them new comm. sets that can't be turned off. That
would probably solve the problem I have of them shutting me out. I
don't like them shutting me out.</p>
<p>Yeah I'm going to give them some new comm. sets. They better be back
here within the hour. Dinah needs to be talked to about going out to
bars and turning off her comm. set. I can still at least try to
control her bad habits. She may be in a relationship with Helena but
I refuse to let her assimilate all of Helena's bad habits. She's
supposed to be the good one. She's supposed to make Helena more
responsible. She's the good influence. It's really not supposed to be
the other way around. I don't know if I could handle two Helena's.
Lord help me if I ever have to handle two Helena's.</p>
