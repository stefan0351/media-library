<chapter title="Part Seven">
<p>Once. It only happened once and now I'm here while Helena's out there
actually having fun. Wasn't it punishment enough that I got stuck in
a damn window? I mean, I just don't think Barbara understands the
complete humiliation I had to suffer through because of that. Has she
ever been stuck in a window? I don't think so. No. Perfect Barbara
Gordon wouldn't do something like that. She's the one that thinks of
everything ahead of time and doesn't make a single mistake.</p>
<p>And how does she choose to punish me? I'm not allowed to do sweeps. I
have to sit up here in this place and watch what's happening below
without being able to do a damn thing. Of course, she tells me that
she wants me to learn a little something about what she does up here
but I don't see why I need to know. She runs this place just fine. I
want to be out there doing something. I want to be with Helena.</p>
<p>I wonder what she's doing right now, probably fighting off some bully
and rescuing the damsel in distress. She's good at that sort of
thing. She just swoops down in all her leathery glory and kicks the
bad guy's ass without even breaking a sweat. Then she'll usually turn
around look straight into the eyes of who's she's rescuing inquire if
they're okay and then...then she just disappears. If I were out there
with her I'd be right by her side and we'd both disappear into the
night then we'd take a break and she'd buy me ice cream. Of all
things she'd buy me ice cream. The first time she did it really
surprised me, I didn't expect that from her. It was kind of romantic
actually.</p>
<p>Then we'd finish walking the streets and rooftops while checking in
with Oracle every once in a while. She'd tell us if we were needed
somewhere else or if we needed to investigate anything else.
Sometimes she'd just tell us to come home and we'd return to the
clock tower laughing, not because anything particularly funny
happened but just because we're both happy to be back.</p>
<p>We understand what we risk by going out every night. We know what
could happen, so when we return and know Barbara is waiting for us
patiently it makes us playful, although we're normally playful. All
of us are, even Barbara.</p>
<p>If the night were a particularly slow one then we'd all sit down and
discuss our days outside of the night we just shared. Even if the
night was particularly difficult for some reason we'd still sit back
and talk, except we'd talk about what happened and if one of us
wasn't ready to talk yet then we'd just sit around and be with each
other...always happy that we could be together at the end of the night.</p>
<p>"Dinah are you paying any attention to me at all?" Barbara asks in
what sounds like a slightly frustrated tone.</p>
<p>"Of course I am," I put my hands on my hips. "I know everything
you've said."</p>
<p>"And what did I say?"</p>
<p>Oh damn. Well that last thing she said was...well she was talking about
that uh... "That button over there controls the video cameras to
fluctuate between the various surveillance cameras in the city?"</p>
<p>Barbara looks at me for a moment then shakes her head, but she's
smiling.</p>
<p>"Did I get it right?" I ask hopefully because if I did then I'm a lot
better listener than I first thought.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Oh...well damn. "What did you say then?"</p>
<p>"I asked you if you wanted to go out and get some dinner."</p>
<p>Barbara wants to leave the clock tower? As in she actually wants to
step outside when Helena is out and doing something as important as
sweeps? Is this a trick question?</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Is that a question or an answer?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Well do you or don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Dinah." I don't like the way she said my name. It kind of gives me
chills. "Do you or do you not want to go out and have dinner with me?
Personally, I'd like to go out with you so that we can spend some
time together outside of the school and this place. We haven't really
talked in a while and I miss it."</p>
<p>Oh well in that case. "Of course I do. We can go to that restaurant
that just opened up. I know you said something about wanting to go
there when it was being built." So does this mean I'm no longer
punished for going out to a bar? Maybe Barbara is still going to let
me go and do sweeps afterwards. Maybe she thinks she's being harsh on
me.</p>
<p>"When we're done eating we'll come back here and you can play Oracle
for the night."</p>
<p>So that still means I can't do sweeps but I have to watch over the
whole city from above. I don't want to do that. That's hard. That's...
what if something happens to Helena and we lose communications and I
can't talk to her and I don't know what's going on? I don't want to
do that. Barbara is so much better at doing that sort of thing.</p>
<p>"I thought this was supposed to be a purely learning through watching
exercise tonight?"</p>
<p>"You've been watching me for a while now and I think you're ready to
handle whatever might arise tonight. If something gets to be too much
then I'll be right there with you."</p>
<p>She's giving me that look now. That special look that she always
gives me when she wants me to try something new and she knows I
really don't want to. It's that 'I believe in you' look that she's
mastered. She was the first one to ever give me that look and really
mean it. She gave me the look even before Helena did.</p>
<p>"Okay fine. I'll do it."</p>
<p>"Great." Barbara smiles. "You'll do fine. Believe me."</p>
<p>Oh I believe her. I have to believe her. The minute I stop believing
in Barbara is the minute my entire foundation starts to fall apart.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We're sitting in the restaurant and our orders have already been
taken. Barbara and I haven't really said all that much to each other
but I think that's just because Barbara is waiting for me to say
something. I wonder what she expects me to say. I don't need to say
anything. She can stop staring at me now with that expectant look on
her face. I don't want to say anything. I have nothing to say. We've
already talked about everything I needed to talk about.</p>
<p>"I didn't drink when I was at the bar you know." I don't know where
that came from.</p>
<p>Barbara nods. "I know."</p>
<p>"And Helena already knew that I was going out so it's not like no one
knew where I was." Where am I going with this exactly?</p>
<p>"Barbara nods again and takes a sip of her drink. "I know."</p>
<p>"Then why are you punishing me?" Yes whining is always good. Makes me
sound just so mature.</p>
<p>"I'm not."</p>
<p>Oh yes well that makes perfect since. She's not letting me go out on
sweeps because she's rewarding me. "You're not?"</p>
<p>"No Dinah, I'm not. You know you shouldn't have gone to that bar but
you're almost eighteen years old, you can pretty much make your own
decisions and I know that sometimes I can seem a little overbearing
but...well I just want you to be careful."</p>
<p>I guess it's my turn now to say, "I know."</p>
<p>"Well now that that's all settled why don't you tell me how you and
Helena are coming along? You know she came and talked to me the night
you got stuck in the window."</p>
<p>"She did?" Why didn't she tell me about this? I knew she wanted to
talk to Barbara but she never told me that she already had. Although,
lately she has sort of seemed like there's been something on her mind
that she just doesn't want to talk about yet. I've decided to give
her space. I figure when she really wants to talk about it then
she'll come to me and if she doesn't come to me soon then I'll force
it out of her.</p>
<p>"Yes she did. She wanted to know how I felt about your relationship."</p>
<p>"And?" I prompt.</p>
<p>"Nothing really," Barbara shrugs. "She just wanted to know how I
felt."</p>
<p>"What'd you say?"</p>
<p>"I told her that what I thought didn't matter but that I support you
both anyway."</p>
<p>I nod. "Well that makes since. I knew that already though."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Barbara looks down at the tablecloth and I know she's
thinking about what to say next. "I'm going to go away for a weekend...
eventually."</p>
<p>Well I wasn't expecting that. "What?"</p>
<p>"Wade and I, we're going away for the weekend." She explains
hesitantly. "I just thought I'd tell you."</p>
<p>Hey wait. "So me running all the heavy equipment tonight, is that
like a trial run?"</p>
<p>Barbara clears her throat. "Yes."</p>
<p>So I'm not being punished I'm just being trained as the standby. I
can handle being the standby. "Well why didn't you just say that
before. It would have made me pay closer attention."</p>
<p>Barbara raises her brow at me. "You should have been paying attention
anyway."</p>
<p>Well if you wanted to use the whole logic argument then what she says
is true. However, I prefer to stick to the immature argument that I
didn't have to pay attention to what she was telling me because I
thought I was being punished. It's really simple. I pay her back for
punishing me by not listening to her. I don't know why anyone would
insist on calling my logic complicated.</p>
<p>"Well that may be true," I have no problem conceding to the points
she brings up, "But it would have made sense."</p>
<p>Barbara looks at me for a very long time then just starts laughing.
It's not a soft demure laugh either; it's a real laugh. She's
laughing at me and I don't really care because I love to see her
smile. She should do it more often. Which is why I'm so exceedingly
happy that she has finally decided to let Wade get a little closer to
her. I know that even though she's the big bad Oracle she still needs
some lovin' too.</p>
<p>"Okay so tell me all about this weekend you've got planned," I
order. "I want all the vital details. You know all the what, when,
where, and how stuff."</p>
<p>Our waitress comes with our food before Barbara gets a chance answer
and we concentrate on our food until I encourage her to speak more
about her eventual weekend getaway.</p>
<p>"So come on now. Tell me what's going on. I need details."</p>
<p>Barbara smiles at me indulgently then carefully sets down her
fork. "What is it you want to know?"</p>
<p>I lean onto the table and can't help the evil smirk that comes across
my face. "Everything," I practically purr.</p>
<p>Barbara actually blushes and I know that it's going to be a fun
night. We'll get dessert, chat about our significant others, then go
and watch over the city by using an intricate system of computer
equipment that tracks everything that goes on. It's going to be a fun
night.</p>

<chapter title="Part Eight">
<p>Three weeks. It took three very long weeks for me to finally get out
of the hospital. First they wanted me to be able to stand up. Then I
had to be able to walk. And Finally I had to be able to get around on
my own. All the feeling came back eventually.</p>
<p>But still, it took three weeks. I was out of my world for three
weeks. Well, I wasn't completely out of the world for three weeks.
Helena and Dinah kept me pretty connected. They were by my side when
they really didn't have to be. I should probably be thankful for that
too, but I'm not.</p>
<p>I could have handled everything just fine on my own. I didn't need
them by my side constantly reminding me that I'm not one of them,
that no matter what I do I'll never be one of them. Helena says it
doesn't matter to her, but I know that it does. What other reason
would she have for hooking up with her younger partner?</p>
<p>They're the same. They think they have this special connection that
I'll never be able to share. I'm not even sure I'd want to share it
anyway. It'd be a big responsibility. I mean Dinah must have tons of
problems. She has to be careful with who she touches because she just
might fall into their minds and never get out. And Helena is stronger
than most people are. She's stronger than I am. I can just imagine
what would happen if she didn't check her strength when she was
dealing with us normal people.</p>
<p>I'll never stop needing their help though. I'll always need them by
my side when I'm dealing with some...well when I'm dealing with some
lizard lady who spits poison at me. I'll need them when I can't
handle the situation on my own or when the law falls short and won't
allow me to do my job. I need them. I don't want to need them, but I
need them.</p>
<p>At one time, I actually thought they'd let me be a part of their
group. I thought that maybe they needed me as much as I needed them
but I was wrong. I at least thought that maybe Helena and I could be
something together, besides partners. She made me think that I had
found someone who I could share my life with and not have to hide
away the part of me that deals with the scum of New Gotham.</p>
<p>I bet she's having a good laugh at me now. I bet she's sitting up on
her rooftops and laughing. Laughing about how Reese fell for her
entire act and Dinah's probably right there with her. Or at least
that's how I wish it was. Then maybe I could actually be angry with
them and blame them for everything that has ever gone wrong in my
life, but I can't. I know that Helena feels bad about what happened
between us and I know that Dinah...well I'm pretty sure that Dinah
would love to rub it in my face that she got the grand prize in a
contest I didn't even know I was a part of, but I know she won't. I'm
sure she realizes having to see them together is almost more than I
can handle.</p>
<p>So here I am. Waiting on the both of them again standing over some
dead body that was killed with some very nasty poison from a lady who
looks like a lizard. I will always need their help more than they
will ever need mine.</p>
<p>"Hey," Helena from behind me. I don't even bother to turn around.</p>
<p>"Hey. We've got another one."</p>
<p>Helena walks up next to me and looks down at the body then takes a
quick look around. I know she's searching for the lady who did this,
but she's not going to find her. I've already looked and I couldn't
find a damn thing. I notice Dinah's not with her and am curious. Did
they have a fight? Are they patrolling different parts of the city?
Is Dinah hurt?</p>
<p>"You ever wonder why she came back to the scene of that last murder?"
She asks bending down over the body.</p>
<p>I shrug even though I know she can't see me do it. "Yeah I wonder
about that all the time. She almost killed me that night. I tend to
wonder about the circumstances often."</p>
<p>She turns to me and her eyes capture mine for a long moment. I know
she wants to say something but she doesn't. She just nods and looks
back at the body.</p>
<p>"You ever come up with a theory of why she came back?" She asks her
head still bent down.</p>
<p>"The only thing different about that night was that you weren't here
and Dinah was."</p>
<p>That gets Helena's attention. She stands up and backs away from the
body. "Do you think the woman wants something from Dinah?"</p>
<p>There's fear in her voice and I'm almost sorry that I put it there.
Makes me kind of wish that I had an answer for her too. "I don't
know, but do you notice something about all the people she's been
killing. You see a trend?"</p>
<p>Helena's about to say no but it stops right on the tip of her tongue.
She realizes what I'm talking about. She realizes that every single
woman that has been killed has blonde hair, blue eyes, and is about
the same height as Dinah. I'm surprised Oracle hasn't informed them
of this very unique trend. I'm even more surprised that they haven't
realized it themselves. I guess they just choose to be blissfully
ignorant.</p>
<p>"I've got to go," She tells me backing away from the body and backing
away from me.</p>
<p>I look down at the concrete ground. "Helena if it helps, I don't
think she wants to bring harm to Dinah," I say but when I look back
up I know Helena hasn't heard a thing I've said because she's gone.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I'm back at the department filling out all my paperwork for the night
and I have this ball of tension in my stomach. Ever since I've left
that crime scene earlier tonight I can't help but think of the look
Helena gave me once I told her my theory. No one may believe me now,
but I really don't want anything to happen to Dinah. I truly don't.
She's just a kid and she doesn't deserve any crazy person out there
having it in their sick mind to mess with her.</p>
<p>I don't want anyone to touch her and I'll do whatever I can to keep
her safe. The girl saved my life, it's really the least I can do.
Plus, well I think I care for her. I don't think I can help caring
about her. She has this thing. It's probably the same thing that made
Helena...well it's probably behind part of the reason Helena and I
aren't together anymore.</p>
<p>I know the girl can protect herself, but I don't want her to have to.</p>
<p>"You're working awfully late tonight detective," a voice calls out to
me through the darkness of the corner. "I'm glad to see that you're
up and walking again."</p>
<p>I remain seated at my desk. I don't want this woman to think that I'm
a threat to her now. The last time I did that I was in the hospital
for three weeks.</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>She steps out of the shadows slowly and languidly walks to the chair
across from my desk to take a seat. "I want you to trust me."</p>
<p>She must be crazy. Maybe she's getting high off of her own
poison. "Like I said, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"I came to you because I think you're the only one who will actually
listen to me and see sense."</p>
<p>Okay the way she's talking has kind of got me scared. "I'm listening."</p>
<p>She shakes her head. "No you're not. But you will be."</p>
<p>The woman's crazy. "Just tell me what you got to say?"</p>
<p>Reptilian lady crosses her legs and leans back in the chair. "I want
her and I want you to bring her to me."</p>
<p>She's talking about Dinah. I know she is but still. "Who?"</p>
<p>She shakes her head. "Please don't Detective. I don't want you
playing stupid with me. I know you to be an educated man."</p>
<p>I sigh. "Fine. Why do you want her?"</p>
<p>"She can do something for me. Something I haven't been able to get
from anyone else."</p>
<p>"Is that why you're killing all these people? You're just looking for
something?"</p>
<p>She nods her head once. "I thought that if I just got someone close
enough...well it doesn't matter because it doesn't work."</p>
<p>"What are you trying to do?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure that you're aware of how special our young Canary is?"</p>
<p>I nod.</p>
<p>"Well I need her special skills to help me on a project of mine and
that's all you need to know."</p>
<p>"Listen," My voice is firm, "if you seriously expect me to help you
out then you've got to tell me what the hell you've got planned for
her."</p>
<p>"Well...how about I just tell you that if you help me I'll let her live
and if you don't then I'll not only kill her, but I'll also kill you
and the woman who protects her."</p>
<p>Now I don't think she could lay a hand on Helena...me on the other
hand, but I don't care about me. "If I help you out then Huntress is
going to kill me anyway."</p>
<p>The woman raises her brow. "Huntress? Is that her name?"</p>
<p>Okay I'm supposed to be getting information not giving it. "I don't
think that really matters."</p>
<p>She smiles mockingly at me. "No I guess it doesn't."</p>
<p>"So what do you want with her?"</p>
<p>"You are persistent, Detective, aren't you?"</p>
<p>I don't answer her. I only wait for a response to my question.</p>
<p>"I'll give you a few days to think about it," she stands and brushes
off the front of her green leather pants. "If you tell anyone about
our conversation then I'll make sure that they all die anyway."</p>
<p>I stand up slowly, still not wanting to make her feel threatened. "I
don't turn on my friends."</p>
<p>She stands up straight and cocks her hide to the side. "Your friends
Detective? Tell me, where are your friends now?"</p>
<p>I don't answer, mostly because I don't have an answer. I don't know
where they are.</p>
<p>"You don't know do you Detective? And that's because they don't want
you to know. You're not their friend, Detective, you're their pawn."</p>
<p>"Well at least they're on the right side."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But do you know what the greater good is, Detective?"</p>
<p>I really wish she would stop calling me that.</p>
<p>"The greater good, Detective, is getting me that girl. What is one
life-- one solitary life-- compared to all the others I'll have to
kill until I get to one that is like her? Do you want one girl's
blood on your hands or do you want twenty...fifty...a hundred? I won't
stop, Detective, until I get what I want."</p>
<p>"So you're saying that once you get her then you're going to stop
killing?" I shake my head. "Call me crazy, but I don't believe that."</p>
<p>"I'm only looking for someone strong enough, Detective, and she's the
one. Once I have her I have no reason to continue my search."</p>
<p>"I still don't believe you."</p>
<p>She shrugs. "Believe what you will."</p>
<p>"Why do you need my help? You seem to have been getting along just
fine without any help." Now I'm just curious. What would she ever
want me to do? Stop Helena? That's not possible.</p>
<p>"Trust is a luxury I do not have."</p>
<p>I snort. "So you want me to betray their trust?"</p>
<p>"It's the greater good, Detective."</p>
<p>"You've got the wrong man."</p>
<p>She shrugs. "Possibly...but I don't think I do."</p>
<p>"Think what you want."</p>
<p>She reaches into the pocket of her green leather jacket and I can't
help but back away. I know what this woman is capable of. She just
grins at me. She knows I'm afraid of her and I think she enjoys it,
but then again most crazies do. She pulls out a card from the inside
pocket and hands it out to me. "Don't worry, Detective, it's
perfectly safe."</p>
<p>I slowly reach out and take it. There's nothing on there but a first
name and number. I'm sure Oracle could find more than enough
information on this crazy just by the number and name. I'll be sure
to get it to her as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"I know you're a very loyal man, Detective, but I feel that if a man
can turn in his own father then he'll have no problem handing over a
young girl who will only be missed by a very selective few. Call me."
</p>
<p>She walks away from me without even one look back. I'm standing at my
desk holding her card in my hand and I'm actually considering her
offer. Oracle and Huntress got along just fine before without Dinah,
from what I understand.</p>
<p>I know trusting the bad guy is never a good idea. I think this one's
different though. She didn't hurt Dinah and I when she had the chance
that night. She didn't do anything but defend herself.</p>
<p>"Hey Reese why am I not surprised to find you here?" Helena suddenly
appears before me. I quickly place the card in my pocket hoping that
she doesn't question me about it.</p>
<p>"I was just finishing up my paper work," I point to the paper
littering my desk. "Did you need something?"</p>
<p>She shrugs. "Not really. I just wanted to see how you were doing on
your first day back."</p>
<p>"Actually," Dinah calls from across the room. "We wanted to see how
your first day back was."</p>
<p>I'm surprised that they're together...here together especially after
Helena's earlier enlightenment this evening.</p>
<p>"Well as you can see," I spread my arms out, "I'm still alive."</p>
<p>Dinah walks up to Helena and takes place beside her. They actually do
look good together. They fit. There's no place for me though.</p>
<p>"And you're going to have to take it easy if you want to stay that
way," Dinah tells me. "So get your stuff and let's go."</p>
<p>"Go where?" I ask grabbing my jacket from the back of my chair.</p>
<p>"We're taking you home," Dinah reaches out and grabs my hand. "You've
got to take care of yourself."</p>
<p>I glance at Helena asking her with my eyes if this is some sort of
joke and Helena just shakes her head and smiles.</p>
<p>"You are aware that I can take myself home aren't you?" I ask Dinah
even though I don't resist her pulling.</p>
<p>"You're also a workaholic and need guidance when it comes to such
things as taking care of yourself." Dinah responds while she
continues to pull me away from my desk and unfinished work.</p>
<p>Helena follows us out only a few steps behind. She's smirking at us
or rather at me.</p>
<p>"Do you think I'm just going to let you drag me about like this?" I
ask pulling back a little.</p>
<p>Dinah stops completely then just looks at me for a moment. "Well...
yeah."</p>
<p>This girl is something else. "Fine. Take me home."</p>
<p>Dinah smiles and lets go of my hand. She looks behind me to Helena
and sticks out her tongue. "I told you he'd listen to me."</p>
<p>Helena rolls her eyes and takes a few quick steps then Dinah is
suddenly in her arms. They lose their selves into each other and I
feel like I should look away. I shouldn't be exposed to this. This is
theirs alone and not mine to share. I wonder if Oracle ever feels the
same way.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Nine">
<p>He never told us what she was doing there. I honestly...well I expected
more from him. I thought that he'd at least tell us something. I
hoped that he would at least tell us something. I know he has a
problem with Dinah and I'm sure he's still a little bitter about what
happened between us, but I really expected him to say something to
us.</p>
<p>I know he cares for Dinah. Hell he fucking owes his life to her...but
he still didn't say anything. He kept silent. He hid information from
us that can actually get this bitch off of the streets and he's
asking me why I don't trust him? He comes up to me and asks if we can
ever truly be partners?</p>
<p>The answer is really quite simple. No. We could never be partners. We
especially can't be partners when he actually has to think about not
turning Dinah over to some freak who wants to do who the hell knows
what with her.</p>
<p>Does he think I'm blind? Does he think I can't see what's going on
with him? He's having some real meta envy going on and I don't have
the fucking time to deal with it. Barbara tells me to just let it go
and we should wait and see what he does. She still thinks that he has
a chance of actually doing the right thing. She's willing to risk it,
but I'm not.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to risk Dinah getting into that woman's hands. I'm
not willing to risk Reese's childish envy getting in the way of us
taking care of this thorn that has constantly been in our side. I
don't know what's going through the man's head and I don't know what
all that green atrocity said to him, but he better get is shit
together quick.</p>
<p>Does he even understand that she wants Dinah? And more importantly
does he not think that I noticed this from the first body we found
that had been poisoned? Of course I realized that all the victims
have looked like Dinah. I can pay attention just as good as the good
ole' detective. Does he not realize that the news has been playing
the same fucking sound byte that explains who the victims look like
over and over again?</p>
<p>Does he think that Dinah doesn't notice it?</p>
<p>We haven't talked about it. None of us have talked about it, not even
Barbara, but we all know what's going on here. We know who this
person is after we just don't know why. I'm afraid to learn what the
why is though. I don't want to know. I don't think Dinah wants to
know or Barbara wants to know either. We're all content with thinking
that we need to get our information on the psycho then go and kick
some ass.</p>
<p>I don't let Dinah go out alone anymore and Barbara gave her a comm.
set that can't be turned off. I walk her to school and I'm there to
pick her up. We do sweeps together and she's never out of my sight.</p>
<p>So, we haven't talked about it but we've adjusted around it. Dinah
doesn't complain because she knows we're only concerned, worried,
fucking terrified about her. A certain part of her has to be scared
too, or else it would be almost impossible to put such a tight watch
on her. Dinah's a free spirit, if she doesn't want to be tied down
then she won't be. That's something we have in common.</p>
<p>"Hey," Dinah calls to me from across her room. I don't know how she
knew I was there; I was actually trying to be quiet.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" I stroll into her room and fall down onto the
bed. She leans down and places a soft kiss on my forehead.</p>
<p>"I'm debating whether or not I should let you in on a secret?" She's
smirking at me and I suddenly get this fluttery feeling in my
stomach. I've only ever gotten this feeling with her.</p>
<p>"Well why wouldn't you want to tell me?" I lower my voice. "Did you
do something bad?"</p>
<p>Dinah shakes her head. "No," she draws out the word. "But I'm about
to."</p>
<p>This girl is going to drive me to my grave. She's still seventeen. We
only have a month left. Just one month, I can last a month. I
shouldn't ask. I know I shouldn't ask but, "What are you gonna do?"</p>
<p>"Well," Dinah maneuvers so that she's straddling my stomach. She
leans down and whispers into my ear, "I have a confession to make"
then plants a light kiss on my neck.</p>
<p>My mouth is suddenly dry. I wonder if Dinah would help me out with
that problem. I reach out and bring her lips towards mine and kiss
her with all the passion that is inside of me. I try to hold back but
it's impossible to do. When the kiss ends she's looking down at me
with such love and regret in her eyes that it frightens me.</p>
<p>"I really should have told you this earlier," she pulls away from me
but keeps her position on top of me. "But Reese and Barbara thought
it'd be better if you didn't know until they actually found something
out."</p>
<p>"Dinah, what are you talking about?" My voice is harder than I intend
it to be but I can't help it.</p>
<p>She places her hand on my chest and gently holds me down. "I'm only
telling you now because I think you should know and I want you to
know that I trust you, but you can't run off and do anything stupid."</p>
<p>I try to sit up but Dinah's hand is still on my chest holding me
down. "Dinah." I warn.</p>
<p>"Helena, I'm telling you this because I love you and I trust that you
won't do anything stupid."</p>
<p>"Just fucking tell me," this time she can't hold me down and I'm able
to sit up but I only manage to bring her closer to me. I wrap my arms
around her to prevent her from falling back and she places hers
around my neck. I look into her eyes and I know she's nervous so I
make a conscious effort to calm down. "Please just tell me?"</p>
<p>Her head drops for a moment then she's looking at me again. "Reece
told me about the crazy lizard lady coming to the police station that
night. He gave me the card to give Barbara and told me that I
probably shouldn't tell you until he had a chance to check things
out." I'm about to say something very not nice about Reese but she
covers my lips with her index finger. "He thinks she's really
dangerous, Helena. He didn't want you going after her blind and
Barbara agreed. They're still trying to find out where this lady is,
but I thought you should know."</p>
<p>"Do they have an idea of where she at least might be?"</p>
<p>"Don't even think about it, Helena. That's why they didn't want to
tell you."</p>
<p>How does she know what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking of anything,
except for going over to wherever this bitch might be and killing
her.</p>
<p>Dinah removes one arm from around my neck and grabs my chin. "I'm
serious Helena. When we know where she is and what she wants then
we'll go after her together. All of us."</p>
<p>"No we won't. I'm not going to let you within ten miles of that
woman."</p>
<p>"Baby," Dinah let's go of my chin and caresses by cheek. "I know
you're worried about me. It scares me too but we have to do this
together. We're a team and don't think that I'm going to let you go
after her on your own."</p>
<p>I sigh and drop my head into Dinah's chest. "Can I at least be pissed
at Barbara and Reese for not wanting to tell me?"</p>
<p>"I'd prefer you not to be, and I don't entirely agree with what they
wanted to do, but you should know their hearts were in the right
place."</p>
<p>I know they were. Still, they didn't trust me, and that kind of
hurts. They may have been right not to tell me but it still hurts.</p>
<p>"I'll try to keep that in mind as I'm yelling at them."</p>
<p>Dinah groans and forces my head back up so that I'm looking at
her. "You have every right to be upset. I would be too, but tell me
that they weren't right about you going all lone vigilante."</p>
<p>I open my mouth to deny it but I can't. "Don't let me get a hold of
where you think she might be. When Barbara and Reese have everything
settled tell me about it and we'll go after her." I'm honest enough
with myself to know that if I get my hands on where this bitch might
be then I'm going to go after her. I wouldn't even know how to try
and stop myself from doing it. I think Barbara once called it going
into a blind rage.</p>
<p>"As soon as I know something then I'll tell you. I told them to not
tell me anything else. I think it's better if I just face this lady
when I have something more to go on."</p>
<p>"Are you scared?" I run my hand through her soft blonde hair. "You
know I won't let her get to you."</p>
<p>"I have this woman killing all these people because of me..." Her voice
trails off and she looks towards the window. "Why me? What does she
want?"</p>
<p>I don't have an answer. As far as I know, none of us have an
answer. "I'm sorry, Dinah, I don't know."</p>
<p>There's tears falling from her eyes now, and it's clear to me just
how much this lady has gotten her worried. I wipe away all the tears
and make her face me again. "She's not going to lay one hand on you.
I swear it."</p>
<p>She nods then our gazes are once again locked. I lean up and meet her
lips. Our kiss is gentle. She brings her hands up to cover my face
and I pull her even closer to me. Her hair falls around us and covers
us both from the outside world.</p>
<p>She eases me back onto the mattress and her body is fully covering my
own. There's a voice in the back of my head warning me that I should
wait, but I'm tired of listening to that voice. I want to listen to
that other part of me now. The part that tells me that she's the most
important person in my life.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" She asks me when we pull back for
air. It's almost absurd that she's the one asking me this. I'm the
one that's supposed to be asking her if she's ready. I should be
asking if she's okay. I shouldn't be the one that's so afraid.</p>
<p>"I love you," I tell her as my answer. She smiles then leans back
down and captures my lips again.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dinah's sleeping in my arms now. Her body rests slightly over my own
and I have no words to describe...anything. All I know is that I am
content. I am happy and I am content. That constant war that I feel
is always going on inside of me seems to have...ceased at least for the
time being.</p>
<p>There's a knock on the door and then Barbara's head pokes into the
room. I signal for her to be quiet then mouth to her that I'll be out
in a sec. She nods then closes the door. I carefully remove myself
from under Dinah's body and place a soft kiss on her temple.</p>
<p>I quickly dress and meet Barbara right outside of the door. She's
looking at me and she's smiling. I know she wants to say something
but for some reason she's holding back.</p>
<p>"What's up?" I ask shifting uncomfortably on my feet.</p>
<p>"I just thought I'd ask if you two were hungry."</p>
<p>I know she wants to comment. "Just say it," I snap.</p>
<p>"But it looks like you've already satisfied your appetites." She says
immediately after permission has been given.</p>
<p>"That was truly brilliant."</p>
<p>"Yes well give me more time and I can come up with something better.
But seriously, and I'm guessing the answer will probably be yes since
I'm sure you have to replenish your energy, do you want to order
food?"</p>
<p>"Yeah that'd be good."</p>
<p>"I'll order it." She turns around to go...well order the food but I
need to know something before I go back in that room and lay with
Dinah.</p>
<p>"Why did you tell me about Reese coming to you? You let me think he
betrayed us."</p>
<p>She stops and I can see her shoulders droop. "I wanted to keep you
alive, Helena."</p>
<p>I nod even though she can't see me. "You still should have trusted
me."</p>
<p>"Would you have gone after her?"</p>
<p>"Probably." I'd never lie about that. "But I'd hope that you'd trust
me to come back before I did something stupid. I do have self-
control."</p>
<p>"I know." She turns back around to face me. "But you understand that
when it comes to Dinah, you're different. You let your heart lead you
instead of your head."</p>
<p>"And that's a bad thing?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," she immediately responds. "I think it's a great
thing but sometimes...well sometimes it just makes things a little more
interesting."</p>
<p>I just raise my brow in question.</p>
<p>"It's not a bad thing, Helena. Sometimes though, it can be dangerous.
Especially when dealing with people like this lizard lady."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"You aren't too terribly upset that I didn't tell you are you?"</p>
<p>I shake my head. "No. I don't like it and I don't want it happening
again, but I'm not too upset about it."</p>
<p>"I promise the next time Reese comes to me with information about the
current crazy then I'll tell you everything."</p>
<p>"Good." I nod.</p>
<p>She doesn't move. I know she's waiting to see if I have anything else
to say. I don't know how she knows I do but... "So Reese was willing to
let me think he was going to betray us to make sure I didn't go out
and do something crazy?"</p>
<p>"He's a good man."</p>
<p>"And a little stupid if he's willing to risk me kicking the shit out
of him."</p>
<p>Barbara smiles. "It was a risk he was willing to take." Her smile
fades and eyes harden. "He cares a lot about both you and Dinah,
Helena don't ever forget that."</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>"Good. Now go back in there and do whatever it was you were doing and
I'll go order the food."</p>
<p>I don't need to be told that twice. I open the door to the bedroom
and see Dinah still laid out peacefully on the bed, but I know she's
awake.</p>
<p>"Did you settle everything with Barbara?" she asks me as I slide into
the bed beside her.</p>
<p>"Yeah we talked." I wrap my arms around her and pull her to me.
</p>
<p>"That's good. So, no hard feelings?"</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>"Good." She takes my hand into hers and pulls it to her chest. "I
don't like it when you and Barbara don't get along."</p>
<p>"There's nothing to worry about now." I kiss the back of neck then
lay my head down next to hers. I think I'd like to stay like this
forever.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Ten">
<p>Okay so there are a lot of things going on in my life. I have the
entire social hierarchy to worry about at school, I have notes to
take for class and exams to study for and take, I have a relationship...
a really really good relationship with a perfect woman who just makes
everything perfect, and I also have to worry about keeping the entire
city safe, and oh yes there's a woman out there who wants me to be
her special friend in a special way that I'm sure includes torture
and general mayhem. Yeah, I have quite a bit to worry about these
days so I've decided to play a game. It's a special game that only
the very gifted can play and that game is of complete and utter
denial/ indifference. I group these two together only because I'm
indifferent because I'm in denial.</p>
<p>Helena wants me to talk about it so does Barbara and I'm pretty sure
that Reese tried to bring the conversation up, but I don't want to.
It's really as simple as that. What's talking about it going to do
anyway? It'll just be me crying tears over something that I can't
change. I'm way too strong to be crying over spilt milk. That is how
that saying goes, right? It doesn't really matter; I'm not going to
be crying over anything. Well anything having to do with this lizard
person.</p>
<p>Eventually the poisonous lady will come out of whatever sewer or hole
she's buried herself in and will try and do something to me. Well
it's either that or she'll continue to kill all these innocents
because she's searching for something that I can only offer. I think
I rather her just come after me and kill me. After seeing the tenth
body on the ground and knowing...well knowing that I was the cause of
it...well it leaves marks.</p>
<p>What I should do is just go out there and meet her head on. I
shouldn't be hiding behind the protection of Helena, Barbara, and
Reese. I'm strong. I know what I'm doing. I'm not just some little
girl who should be sitting around and doing nothing while my time is
ticking away; because the time is ticking away of that I have no
doubt. I can actually hear the seconds go by and I'm nowhere near a
clock...oh wait scratch that I am sitting in a clock tower, but that's
really not my point. I can hear the seconds ticking away in my head.
My whole body is on countdown.</p>
<p>I need to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get anything
done especially not this history crap. Call me crazy, but I'm not
really that concerned with writing an essay on the effects Woodrow
Wilson's presidency had on this country. I only have one sentence
done so far and I'm not even sure if, 'Woodrow Wilson was a man'
really qualifies as a sentence of any true substance.</p>
<p>"Barbara!" I call as I come out of my room. "I'm going for a walk."</p>
<p>Barbara turns away from her myriad of screens and looks at me like
she's dissecting my simple statement into a million pieces analyzing
it and searching for some hidden meaning. All I meant was that I'm
going for a walk. I can walk. I'm walking right now. What's so hard
about that?</p>
<p>"Helena isn't here," she tells me like I don't know this already. I
know where Helena is. She's out there doing her working thing. Maybe
I should get a job so that I don't have to spend as much time here. I
could certainly try to pay my way a little bit around here. It's
really not necessary for Barbara to pay for everything of mine. I'm
an adult...almost.</p>
<p>"I know, which is just fine because I didn't want to take a walk with
her, I wanted to take a walk by myself."</p>
<p>Okay so here comes the refusal to let me go out because it's too
dangerous and blah blah blah and so on and so forth and the don't you
have homework.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that's what you want to do?"</p>
<p>Alright so she's trying something new here. She's not telling me I
can't do something she's just wondering if I've lost my mind. "Yes. I
can't concentrate on my homework and I need a break."</p>
<p>Okay so now I'm going to get the refusal to let me go out because
it's too dangerous and the blah blah blah's the so on and so forth.</p>
<p>"Keep your comm. set on and if Reese needs something then I'll send
you out. Helena's boss told her if she left early one more time this
week then she's going to get fired."</p>
<p>I think I'm having a scratch head in confusion moment. She wants me
to go and do what now? I can leave? There's no refusal? I was fully
prepared for a refusal. I had my argument all planned out. There was
going to be points to be made and...and there was going to be voices
raised and I was going to storm out of here with conviction. I needed
the anger to override my fear of actually stepping out in the dark
alone. Barbara is a very smart woman.</p>
<p>"Is there a reason for you standing there and staring at me?"</p>
<p>She's smirking at me. I can't believe that she finds this funny. This
isn't funny. This is very serious.</p>
<p>"Dinah?"</p>
<p>I don't know what to say. I can't very well be mean to a person who
is letting me do what I want to do. Where's the authority now?
Where's her, I know best because I've been around longer attitude? I
need this attitude. I can only fight this attitude.</p>
<p>"You do realize that I'm going to go outside all by myself at night?"</p>
<p>"Dinah are you okay?"</p>
<p>"Don't change the subject here, Barb. I want an answer to my
question."</p>
<p>She shakes her head but I guess she is into appeasing me. "I do
realize that it's nighttime and I also realize that you'll be going
out alone."</p>
<p>"Then why am I allowed to go?"</p>
<p>"Because you're old enough to make your own choices and me keeping
you hostage here if you don't want to be here isn't going to make
either of us very happy. Dinah it's your choice to make and your
consequence to live out."</p>
<p>Suddenly I have this picture of the entire 'wax on and wax off' scene
from that one movie. Something's happening here. It's a moment. There
should be some omniscient music playing that just by the tone of it
all should tell me that I'm making some important decision about
life. Maybe I should just say yes sensei, bow, and try and get back
to my pointless paper on a dead man.</p>
<p>"I know that." Wow that's the best I could come up with? "I don't
want to live in fear though. Maybe the consequence of that would be
more damaging to me then something else happening." No that's the
best I can do.</p>
<p>Barbara shrugs. "It's all your choice to make."</p>
<p>Helena wouldn't want me to go out, but she's not here. Barbara isn't
stopping me from going out; she's actually remaining quite neutral.
It's all up to me. This is what I believe some would call pressure.</p>
<p>"Well I'm just going to go out. I won't stay out too long, but I just
need to get away. I feel like I'm suffocating."</p>
<p>"You know Dinah, if you wanted to stay here and actually talk about
what's going on with you then that'd be fine too."</p>
<p>So she doesn't want me to go out! I knew it! She was just playing
with my head.</p>
<p>"Maybe when I get back."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ah. Fresh air. There's really nothing quite like it. The night has a
little bit of a chill, but I'm not going to let it drive me back
inside. I'm fine. There's no one out here but me and all the other
people walking the streets. They all seem pretty normal, but then
again I guess I look pretty normal too but I'm not really normal. At
least I'm not normal by the mainstream sense of the word.</p>
<p>There was a time when I was younger, as if I'm a hundred now, but
there was a time when I was younger all I wanted to be was normal. I
wanted to be like everyone else around me and fit in because I didn't
want to be left behind again. I didn't want my other mother to leave
me because I wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>I played the role of the good girl for so long that I became her. I
did everything everyone thought I should do; yet I was still a freak.
It didn't matter what clothes I wore or how much I changed how I
acted around everyone else, I was the same freak underneath it all.</p>
<p>Now though, now I wouldn't want to be normal for nothing. If I were
normal then I wouldn't have Helena because I would have never known
she existed. If I were normal then I wouldn't be able to be the
superhero. I wouldn't be able to stick up for the little guy and take
out the bad one. I wouldn't be able to at least try and stop letting
the bullies win. I think they won already too much when it came to me.</p>
<p>"So you finally decided to stop hiding behind your ring of
protectors."</p>
<p>Shit. Shit mother fucking damn. I should have stayed with Barbara. We
could have talked and had a few laughs. It would have been fun. We
could have stayed up and waited for Helena to come home and then we
could do more chatting. Maybe I'd even suggest a nice board game. It
could be the Game of Life and I wouldn't be able to die by playing
it.</p>
<p>I turn around and face this woman who has been my special friend for
the last few months. She's wearing her standard green leather attire
and her eyes are just as reptilian as they've always been. Her long
blonde hair is down and kind of has a winded look to it. Just looking
at her kind of reminds me of looking at myself in the mirror, and
since I'm just noticing this for the first time it's a little
disconcerting. She's not after people that look like me; she's after
people that look like her.</p>
<p>"I can take care of myself." I thought maybe it was time I actually
answer her instead of just stare at her.</p>
<p>"Yes but you still have many protectors. I thought for sure that the
Detective would get in touch with me. He's quite loyal to you."</p>
<p>"He's a good person, which is more than I can say for you." Okay I
need to watch what I say. I shouldn't antagonize the woman who can
spit poison out at me when I don't have the antidote. 'Always
remember the antidote. Always remember the antidote. Even take the
antidote with you when you're just stepping outside for a second' I
believe that's what Helena and Barbara had told me when we were
discussing the antidote.</p>
<p>"Despite what you might think, Black Canary, I am not an evil person.
I want the same thing that everyone else wants."</p>
<p>"Which would be?"</p>
<p>"I want my family."</p>
<p>"So what? You kill people when they decide they don't want to join
you in your life of killing?"</p>
<p>She bows her head and sighs. "I am very misunderstood."</p>
<p>"You kill people maliciously. What's to misunderstand?" Don't
antagonize the evil lady. Don't antagonize the evil lady. I need to
learn that whole self-control thing Barbara keeps on emphasizing when
we're training. I think even Helena brought it up a few times.</p>
<p>"More than you will ever know."</p>
<p>I should bite my tongue. I should bite my tongue and just accept that
she's crazy and then I should try to run away or at least get some
back up here. "Well...how am I supposed to know if you won't tell me?
What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"I need someone strong enough."</p>
<p>I throw my hands up in the air exasperated. "Not strong enough for
what?"</p>
<p>"You'll find out."</p>
<p>Oh damn. I don't like that look. That's the evil guy death
look. "You'll have to get me first," I choose to run away. I guess I
could stay and fight but all it takes is just a little bit of poison
and I won't be going anywhere for a while.</p>
<p>"Barbara!" I scream. I'm hoping she's heard some of the conversation
already. "I need help."</p>
<p>"Dinah?"</p>
<p>Thank God. "Barbara I need help. I'm uh...well I'm being chased by the
lizard lady and I don't have the antidote to the poison with me."</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll send Helena to your position. Is there anyone else with
her?"</p>
<p>Is there anyone else with her? I don't know. I should know these
things. It's in the hero book written in big letters. Always know who
is around you. Damn it. Well she doesn't appear to be following me.
Why isn't she following me?</p>
<p>Oh wait that's why. It's a trap. "She has a few people with her..." I
stop running and look around me. There's nothing but very high
buildings. If I were Helena I could get the hell out of here and look
forward to looking into the good talking to that Barbara will give me
about not carrying around the antidote and listening to her.</p>
<p>Second rule in the hero book written all big and pretty, 'Don't
Panic'. Okay so I just need to hold on until Helena gets here. I can
take care of the five or so people standing in front of me and the
poison-spitting lady behind me.</p>
<p>"If you come with me willingly nothing will happen to you."</p>
<p>Yes the last time I believed that statement when coming out of the
mouth of the bad guy was...well never.</p>
<p>"Dinah? What's going on?" Barbara sounds a little worried. She can
just join the club.</p>
<p>"Whatever you want you're not getting from me." I rush her. I guess
fighting eminent death is better than being taken away to someplace
else and dying slowly.</p>
<p>She barely is able to dodge my fist but she does. She's quick and
she's ready for a fight. I beat her the last time I can do it again
now. Barbara is screaming in my ear now and it's a little distracting
but I get over it quickly. I can't concentrate on that voice in my
head especially when there's this lady who spits poison out of her
mouth is standing in front of me and some seriously mean looking
people are standing behind me.</p>
<p>I get in a good hit to her ribs with my foot. I actually think I
break a few because I hear a crunching sound. She's knocked down and
I turn around to be faced with a young man that looks like he's going
to be shooting electricity at me sometime soon.</p>
<p>I dive out of the way and don't take the time to make sure I wasn't
hit by the bolt before I'm on my feet again and doing my best to
concentrate on this guy and get him knocked out somehow. I focus on
all my energy and picture him be swept into a wall. Moments later
he's being thrown into the side of the building but it's taken me too
long to do it. I'm being hit in the torso by some type of energy
burst and it hurts like hell.</p>
<p>I'm on the ground and I can feel them all coming closer to me. I put
the pain in the back of my mind and do my best to stand up. I don't
know how much more I can do but I've got to at least fight.</p>
<p>"Don't fight us anymore. I don't want to hurt anyone else." Lizard
lady tells me. "I never wanted to hurt anyone."</p>
<p>Yeah...for some reason, maybe it's the big burn on my stomach, but I
don't believe her. Physically I'm pretty much spent so all I have
left is my meta powers and I may be too weak to even make use of
those.</p>
<p>"Dinah!" Barbara's voice penetrates my thoughts. "Dinah, Sweetie,
hang on Helena is on her way."</p>
<p>Okay so I need to concentrate again. There's four people who appear
to have meta powers ready to kill me. The quickest way to get them
away from me is to uh...well make them go away. I just need to push all
of them away from me. That's not going to be that hard. Sure I've
never done it before, but...okay I need to concentrate.</p>
<p>God. It worked. Wait...some of them are getting back up and I don't
feel too good. "Oracle tell Helena that I'm sorry." I can't fight
anymore. I don't have anything left in me.</p>
<p>Wait what's that? Who's that? Is that Reese? What's he doing here? He
shouldn't be fighting them. He's not strong enough. He'll get hurt
again. I can't hurt him anymore. I like him now. I want to tell him
to watch out for the lady behind him but my mouth isn't working. I
feel like I'm paralyzed. I feel like I'm paralyzed? Did I get hit
with the poison?</p>
<p>It's getting harder to breathe. I think I'm laying on the ground now.
How's Reese doing? I can't see him anymore. I can hear him. I think
Helena's here too. I can almost feel her, but I can't stay awake.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Eleven">
<p>All it takes is one moment for everything to change in a person's
life. Just one. I knew my life was going to be changed forever when
Helena came into my life. Oddly it wasn't the gunshot that paralyzed
me that changed everything, but it was this teenager that was angry,
wild, and set on trying my patience. Helena came and then she
brought Dinah into my life and eventually brought Reese as well. All
it took to set that off was one moment.</p>
<p>Dinah was out there alone tonight. She was fighting for her life and
I couldn't do anything to help her. I was stuck in this damn clock
tower listening to her fight. I got Reese there...he was the closest. I
got Helena there...she was the fastest and I prayed that they'd all
come back to the clock tower somber but smiling because they were all
alive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's not what happened. What happened was that my
perception of this entire situation changed. I was forced to look at
things differently and try to make sense of everything because I know
that they would turn to me for guidance. That's what they always do.
That's what I'm here for. Helena takes her weight too, but ultimately
she looks to me for answers. This time, I'm not too sure what answer
I should give.</p>
<p>She came back holding Dinah in her arms, screaming for me to help
her. She had already given Dinah the antidote but it wasn't working
fast enough. I couldn't do anything but wait for it to kick in and
tell Helena that eventually Dinah would come back to us. I had to
have faith that she would. Her body was already very weak from the
fight I wasn't too sure that she was going to be able to handle
fighting off the poison.</p>
<p>He came to me, for the first time, holding the woman who caused all
these problems in his arms. She was moaning and she was hurt. I think
he barely stopped Helena from killing her. He laid her down and said
I should take a look at her. When did I become a doctor?</p>
<p>I did my best. I sat down and I looked at her. I looked at her and I
realized something...something I'm surprised Reese hadn't caught onto
yet. She was breathing but her heart wasn't beating. She didn't have
a heart. She wasn't real.</p>
<p>When Dinah had her first encounter with the woman she told me that
she touched her hand and she couldn't feel anything. Well, this would
the be reason why. The woman that has been causing us so many
problems is nothing but a figment of our imaginations or to be
completely technical she's nothing but a figment of someone else's
imagination. As far as I can tell she's some type of projection from
someone's mind. Looks and acts exactly like a human being, but isn't
one.</p>
<p>Our new problem is to find the real person behind this woman. The
bigger problem, though, is trying to find out how we even start
searching. We could always just start looking at files of people that
look like her, which shouldn't be too entirely large since she was
wiping her look-alikes off the map, but I'm not too sure how far that
would get us.</p>
<p>I haven't told anyone else yet. I think they'd like to think that
it's over. I know Helena doesn't want to hear the news at least until
Dinah wakes up and I don't blame her for that. I wouldn't want to
know any of this either, but I had a job to do.</p>
<p>"You've been quiet for a while," Reese sits down across from me at
the table. "What is it you're not telling anyone?"</p>
<p>"How do you know I'm not telling you anything? We really don't know
each other."</p>
<p>Reese nods his head. "That's true. But just call it a hunch. You look
like something's on your mind."</p>
<p>Well, I'll have to start telling people eventually. "She's not alive."
</p>
<p>"Not alive?"</p>
<p>"She's not real, just some kind of astral projection from someone
else's mind."</p>
<p>"How's that possible?" Reese leans onto the table. "She almost killed
me and almost got Dinah. How can she not be real?"</p>
<p>I shake my head. "I don't know. She's real enough to cause us harm,
but not real enough to...well she's not real enough to die."</p>
<p>"Then how was Helena just about able to beat her to death."</p>
<p>"The person responsible for this is probably in a whole lot of pain
right now. They probably felt what was happening."</p>
<p>"So why isn't this projection disappearing?"</p>
<p>I let my head fall into my hands. "Maybe they don't have anywhere
else to go."</p>
<p>"So what does this mean?"</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>"It means we can't kill this bitch until Dinah is well enough to
search for her."</p>
<p>Helena is standing behind me, her arms are crossed in front of her
and she doesn't look that happy.</p>
<p>"We can start searching, Helena. Dinah doesn't have to be put in
front of her anymore."</p>
<p>"Wait," Reese jumps in forcing me to turn my attention back to
him. "Is this a case of, if we don't believe it then it doesn't
exist?"</p>
<p>"Sort of. It's almost like fighting a dream. Even in our dreams we
may know it's fake but we don't usually know it is until we're awake
and we've already been hurt in our dreams."</p>
<p>"So only Dinah can find her, why?" He asks. I think he's wanting run
in and be the hero again.</p>
<p>"She's the only one of us that can reach into the dream and pull
whoever is making this woman out." Helena answers none to patiently.</p>
<p>I think it's time for a subject change. I can explain everything to
Reese later when Helena isn't standing here waiting to pounce on
anything that makes her the least bit irritated. "How's Dinah doing?"
I'll go up and check on her soon.</p>
<p>"She's still sleeping," Helena turns her gaze away. I don't think she
wants me to see the unshed tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Did you need anything?" I ask hoping that she'll admit that she's
scared or something.</p>
<p>She turns back to me and all the tears are gone. "I just wanted to
see what was going on with uh...reptile lady."</p>
<p>Which in translation means she couldn't stand watching Dinah lying on
a bed not sure if she'd wake up. "Well I have her locked up right now
so when she wakes up I'll be sure to pass the information along."</p>
<p>"How can she still be sleeping, though?" Reese asks. "I mean she's
not real."</p>
<p>He really needs to shut up right now. I know he's as worried as the
rest of us but if he's going to hang out here then he's going to have
to learn that we're the silent broody type, the only exception being
Dinah. We only talk about the bad guy when we know that we're all
ready to talk about it or when we can't put it off anymore and the
issue is forced upon us.</p>
<p>"I'll explain everything later, Reese." I tell him shortly then turn
my attention back to Helena. "Maybe you should take a bit of a break.
Take a walk or something?"</p>
<p>It was a walk that started this whole night out wasn't it?</p>
<p>"No, I'm going to go back." Helena points her thumb over her
shoulder. "I think she's going to wake up soon."</p>
<p>I just smile and nod. It may be hours until Dinah wakes up. It may
also be days, weeks, months...</p>
<p>When Helena is gone Reese sits back in his chair and just looks at
me. He's being quiet now. I think he wants answers. He wants a
direction he can take to make everything better.</p>
<p>"Reese, I don't know how this person is doing what she is doing. I
don't even know if it's a she. All I can hope is if the next time we
face her then you'll be able to realize she's not real and can't hurt
you, but since that's not really the easiest thing to do..."</p>
<p>"I'll stay clear." Reese looks away from me. He is actually looking
past me. "So why is it that Dinah..."</p>
<p>"She's the only one that can reach out and touch someone."</p>
<p>His smirk matches my own and we're silent again. There's not a lot we
can say at this point. We're at a stand still. We can't do anything
until either Dinah or this dream wakes up.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I gave them plenty of time alone. Helena was right when she said that
Dinah would be waking up soon. I don't know how she knew, and I'm not
going to question it. I'm just glad that Dinah decided to wake up
eventually. She was very disoriented but that was to be expected.
Actually, she was semi-delirious. She didn't know where she was or
who she was, which scared the hell out of Helena and me.</p>
<p>She remembers everything just fine now, though. The best I can figure
is that she needed to catch up on everything that had happened to her
recently. Her body was completely drained. I don't know what she did
before she was hit by the poison, but it seems to have been
significant enough to affect the way her brain handled things. It was
kind of like she was on overload.</p>
<p>She's fine now. I think we all have to remember that. She's going to
be just fine. Even though the poison hit her she doesn't seem to be
having nearly as many effects from it as Reese had. She's not
paralyzed at all. Her body actually seems to have fought of the
poison quite well. She must have already had a slight immunity to it.</p>
<p>"So how are you feeling now?" She's sitting up on her bed and Helena
is there with her. Actually, she's in Helena's arms. I would really
pity the person who decided to even try and break them apart now.</p>
<p>Dinah rolls her eyes at me. "I'm fine. How many times are you going
to ask me that? I can feel my toes and I can wiggle my nose." She
stops in the middle of her commentary. "Hey! That rhymed."</p>
<p>Helena and I laugh. It feels good to laugh. "Yes it did. It's good to
know that you've maintained the ability to make simple rhymes. Next,
we'll start on your multiplication tables."</p>
<p>"Yeah that's funny," She's smiling at me and we both know the real
reason behind this banter. Things have been too serious. We don't
need it to be serious anymore.</p>
<p>"But seriously, how are you feeling?"</p>
<p>Dinah gives the question the consideration it deserves this
time. "I'm fine. I still feel a little woozy though."</p>
<p>I nod. "I'm not really that surprised. You usually do feel that way
after you've used your powers past your maximum limit."</p>
<p>Dinah only leans further into Helena's embrace. I'm not sure if
they've talked about our little astral projected friend, and I hate
to bring it up, but... "Dinah do you know about our reptile friend
yet?"</p>
<p>She looks at me for a long time then nods. "She's not real. That's
why I didn't feel anything the first and only time I ever touched
her."</p>
<p>"So do you think you could find the person behind the dream?"</p>
<p>"You want me to chase the dream?" she's smirking at me so I know
she's not too terribly upset by this although I'm pretty sure she's
not entirely comfortable with it either.</p>
<p>"I want you to find the person behind it. She has to be leaving some
trail on this...projection."</p>
<p>"When do we get started?"</p>
<p>"We don't," Helena interjects, "at least we don't yet. Right now we
rest and we make sure that you're okay first. You shouldn't be using
your powers now anyway."</p>
<p>I must agree with Helena. Dinah shouldn't be using her powers
now. "It's not too terribly important we get it done now. There's
still plenty of time. You need to be well before you go out and take
down all the bad guys."</p>
<p>"Is Reese still here?" She asks with what I would call hope, but I
might be wrong about that. Reese and her never really meshed. They
cared, but they never meshed.</p>
<p>I shake my head. "No. Once he knew you were okay he went home." Part
of the reason he left was because he knew Helena and Dinah would be
exactly as they are now and he's still not entirely comfortable with
that yet. When the man fell for Helena he fell hard. "He said that
he'd back tomorrow though."</p>
<p>"So he knows where our secret hide-out is now?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," I sigh. "We just couldn't maintain our secret lair anymore."</p>
<p>"Would you really consider it a lair?" Dinah asks. "I mean... we live
in a clock tower. It just doesn't scream lair to me."</p>
<p>"What would you consider a lair?" Helena asks.</p>
<p>"The Bat Cave was a lair," Dinah immediately responds. "There were
secret hiding places all over the place and places to store nifty
costumes and places for secret vehicles and everything. That's a
lair."</p>
<p>"The Clock Tower has secrets," Helena responds.</p>
<p>Dinah looks from her to me then turns back to Helena again. "What
secrets?"</p>
<p>Helena looks at me and I shrug. "There are no secrets."</p>
<p>"You're lying!" Dinah immediately yells. "I can't believe you're
lying to me. Here I am...all in recovery and you're lying to me! Why
wasn't I told about these secrets?"</p>
<p>"What secrets." I maintain a perfectly straight face as I say
this. "There are no secrets."</p>
<p>Knowing she won't learn anything from me she turns to Helena. "What
secrets?"</p>
<p>"If Barbara isn't going to tell then neither am I."</p>
<p>"This is so unfair." Dinah is actually pouting. It's quite adorable
really. Helena is going to tell her every secret she's ever learned
about this place.</p>
<p>"Well, life isn't fair." I tell her. The pout doesn't work so much on
me. Well...most of the time it won't work. This time it's definitely
not going to work. I should probably get out of here now. "I'll leave
you two alone now. If you need anything later on tonight then just
holler."</p>
<p>I make my way towards the bed and open my arms for a hug. Dinah jumps
into my arms and wraps her arms tightly around my neck. I wrap my
arms just a tightly around her. We may never say it aloud but we were
both horrified by what happened. I was there with her through it all
and I know I never want to do that again.</p>
<p>Dinah eventually relinquishes her hold on me and I do the same. She's
solid and she's whole and she's real. I need to remember that. While
I try and sleep tonight I'll have to remember that she's okay.
Nothing happened to her that couldn't be fixed or that she couldn't
handle.</p>
<p>I take a quick glance at Helena and she's looking at me and I know
that she sees right through me. She knows what I'm feeling right now
because she's feeling the same way, and I know she feels that way
because she hasn't let Dinah out of her arms until I opened mine up.</p>
<p>"You both get some sleep tonight." I stay there for a moment looking
at them both then move to turn around and leave them be again. Before
I go Dinah stops me once more and places a quick kiss on my cheek.
She's just as glad to be alive and with us as we are that she is
alive and with us.</p>
<p>"I love you Barbara."</p>
<p>I won't cry. "Love you too. Both of you. Now get some sleep."</p>
<p>I make a hasty exit and close the door behind me. I think I'll be
able to sleep better tonight having said that.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twelve">
<p>I had a dream last night. I was standing alone in the hallway of this
very old building and there was this organ playing in the background.
I walked towards these doors that were in front of me and when I
tried to open them they were locked. I tried every door and they all
were locked. None of them would budge no matter what I did.</p>
<p>I turned around and just above this organ playing I could hear this
tapping sound. It sounded like wood hitting the tiled floor. It was
coming closer and closer to me, but I didn't feel the urge to run. So
I just stood there and waited for whatever was coming to come.
Eventually this woman appeared and she had this walking stick, which
I figure was making the tapping sound, and she turns to me as she
passes me and tells me, "You can't unlock the doors to the inner mind
if you have no key."</p>
<p>Of course I have no clue what this means so I ask what she's talking
about and in true dream form she just repeats what she just said.
That's when I decided to wake up because obviously this dream means
nothing and is a big waste of my time. It's a waste of my time, just
like trying to talk to some non-person is a waste of my time.</p>
<p>I don't know what Barbara keeps on expecting me to find out about
this reptilian foe, but I'm not getting anywhere. I got further
trying to talk my science teacher into believing that it is possible
to defy gravity and I still lost that argument in the end...even if I
do have my facts straight. It's near impossible trying to feel
something from something that isn't real.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm putting my hand on a wall and waiting for it to tell
me its inner secrets. Only if these walls could talk...but they don't
so it's a lost hope. I've tried talking to the person behind
the...well the fake person and I've gotten nowhere.</p>
<p>I haven't learned anything. I tell her to talk and she goes on and on
about needing to be strong enough. I can't make sense of any of it
and I refuse to try any more. Helena can't talk to her and Barbara
hasn't had much success either. We can't talk to her. I refuse to
try. I refuse. This is me refusing. My foot is down. I'm tired of
helping the person who's evil. That so wasn't in my job description
when I applied to be a superhero. Well...there really wasn't any type
of job description in the first place but if there were that wouldn't
be part of it.</p>
<p>Unless of course, it fell under that category of doing things that
one might not want to do, because I think I've actually been briefed
about that. I think it falls under the greater good somewhere, but
I'm not too sure how much I care about that good yet.</p>
<p>"Dinah, she's asking for you."</p>
<p>How long have Helena and Barbara been standing behind me this time?
They do that sometimes; just stand and stare at me waiting for me to
finish thinking about whatever it is I'm thinking about.</p>
<p>"Barbara I told you that I'm not going to talk to her anymore." I
cross my arms in front of me as I turn to face them. I'm resolved
about this. I have put my foot down.</p>
<p>"You're the only one she talks to. We've tried but she won't...we
need you now Dinah."</p>
<p>Why does Barbara say those things? Like I don't know that she needs
me? Of course I know. How could I not know? I've been told so ever
since I woke up from whatever la la land I had taken my little mind
vacation in. "I don't want to talk to her anymore. I'm not getting
anywhere with her either."</p>
<p>"Dinah I understand but if..."</p>
<p>"Barbara if she doesn't want to do it then don't make her."</p>
<p>Finally Helena speaks up. I knew she didn't want me talking to the
thing in the first place, but she wouldn't say anything because she
wanted me to make my own choice and I made it but now I'm making a
different one.</p>
<p>Barbara looks to Helena then to me and she knows she's outnumbered
here. I'm stubborn and won't budge on this position and Helena is
backing me up. We're just going to have to find another way to work
this out.</p>
<p>I stand firm.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Okay so I'm sitting across from the phantom again. She's just staring
at me and not saying anything. I don't know why she was asking for me
before if she wasn't going to talk. This whole thing has been a waste
of my time a waste of my efforts and a waste of resources. I have no
idea why I let Barbara talk me into doing this again. I don't even
know why Helena decided to jump the fence and take Barbara's side on
this. I just do not see the point to any of this.</p>
<p>I don't even know this woman's name. I know nothing about her except
for the fact that she keeps on threatening me and everyone I care
about bodily harm if she's not released soon. Well she says that and
that she needs someone strong enough. I still haven't been able to
figure that one out.</p>
<p>All I really know is that she has an affinity for green leather and
while she's not real can kill people with poison. She's been here for
a week. I've been with her for almost just as long. Didn't I have my
foot down?</p>
<p>"I guess I should ask you your name since you're unwilling to tell me
anything else," I tell her as I sit on the other side of this nifty
little holding energy field thing that Barbara came up with.</p>
<p>"You don't care what my name is," she not very surprisingly snaps
back at me.</p>
<p>I snort. "You're right I don't. I don't care about you at all. You've
killed a lot of people and you tried to kill me. My caring for you
ran out a long time ago." I'm tired of being nice to the evil lady.</p>
<p>"You don't understand."</p>
<p>This is NOT the first time I've heard this. It's not the second or
third either. I'm tired of it. "You're right I don't understand. I
don't want to understand anymore. I would really just like you to go
away."</p>
<p>"If I go away then I die." She yells at me. "I can't go away. Do you
think I want to live like this? Do you think if I had a choice that I
would?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you want. You tell me you want a family just like
everyone else, then you say you don't want to live like you are
living..." I shrug. "Frankly I'm at a loss. The only reason I'm
sitting in front of you now is because someone very important to me
asked me to do this for her. Personally, I'd just like you to fade
away like a bad dream."</p>
<p>She turns her head to the side and looks at me curiously. "You would
sentence me to death?"</p>
<p>Would I? I'm not a killer. I've never killed anyone in my life. I've
injured, maimed, and freaked some people out severely, but I've never
killed anyone. I don't know if...the ability is there the anger is
definitely there, but that's not who I am. It never has been. I've
always been more into protecting than avenging. I leave the avenging
to Helena.</p>
<p>"I'd want to," I eventually respond. "I'd really want to, but I
couldn't. I value life too much. Even yours. I'm guessing that's a
sentiment we don't share."</p>
<p>"I didn't want them to die!" She screams and jumps into the energy
blast which only throws her back. I jump back as well because even
though I know she's not real and I know that she's not leaving her
prison anytime soon, she still kind of scares the hell out of me and
I'm pretty sure she knows it.</p>
<p>"You killed them." I tell her as soon as I recover from my slight
bout of absolute fear.</p>
<p>"But I didn't mean to. They couldn't handle me. They couldn't hold me
long enough."</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about? Hold you long enough for what?"</p>
<p>"To carry me back!"</p>
<p>"Carry you back where?"</p>
<p>"To myself, my home, my family!"</p>
<p>She falls down to the ground and she's crying. It's not the kind of
crying where there are just a few tears either. I believe this type
of crying would be called sobbing.</p>
<p>I refuse to feel bad for her. "What were you doing killing people
then?"</p>
<p>"I needed a host, a host to bring me back."</p>
<p>I think I'm catching on to things here. "You need a host to bring you
back to your body?" She nods at me and begins wiping her tears away
with the tips of her fingers. "Why do they need to look like you
then?"</p>
<p>She shrugs. "I just thought they could handle me better. They
couldn't."</p>
<p>"Of course they couldn't handle you. They were all human. You're
meta."</p>
<p>"Which is why I need someone strong enough to carry me back."</p>
<p>"Why can't you just get back on your own? You seem to be moving
around okay without a real body."</p>
<p>"I don't know. I can't jump back in; I can only be transferred back
in like I was ripped out."</p>
<p>Oh well that makes perfect sense, I think. "How were you ripped out?"</p>
<p>She looks at me for a long time. I guess she's not sure if she wants
to answer me or not. She has that certain look people get on their
faces when they're not sure they can trust someone yet, and I don't
see why she would have a problem trusting me. I haven't done anything
to her. I'm not the one that was trying to kill her.
</p>
<p>"I was in an accident and fell into a coma."</p>
<p>Well I'm sure that'll do it. "Okay," I nod because I don't know what
else to do. I have to think about things now. I actually have to
stop and think.</p>
<p>"If I get you back to your body you won't hurt anyone? No one. You'll
just walk out of here go to your body then we'll be done?"</p>
<p>She nods vigorously. "That's all I've ever wanted to do."</p>
<p>"Well that and you tried to kidnap me...how did you get those other
guys to appear anyway?"</p>
<p>"I can pretty much bring anything I want to life."</p>
<p>"Well that's a true gift...really."</p>
<p>I know I shouldn't do this. This is a bad idea. Actually I think this
is what bad ideas are made of, but if I give myself too much time to
think about this then nothing's going to get done and she'll be stuck
here and her body will be stuck somewhere else and there will be much
unhappiness to go around.</p>
<p>Helena and Barbara are going to kill me but...I go over to the
control panel and turn off the energy field. "If you do anything at
all with my body that I don't like then I'm going to push you out and
make sure you never get back to yours." I don't even know how I would
go about doing that but...well I had to say something menacing to the
person who's going to take over my body. "Okay...so how do we do
this?"</p>
<p>"Just give me your hand." She reaches out to me and I know my hand
should be meeting hers but it's like lead at my side. I shouldn't be
doing this. This is a bad idea.</p>
<p>"Dinah what are you doing?" That's Helena. She's on her way over
here. I don't have anymore time to think about this. I help her out
and hope with all that I am I get through this or I die.</p>
<p>My hand finally leaves my side. "What's your name?" I ask as my hand
is enfolded in poison lady's.</p>
<p>"Sarah." She answers and I don't really feel like she's talking to me
anymore but from inside of me. I feel different now. I'm seeing
everything through this thick haze and it's all in slow motion. I
actually feel like I'm paralyzed. I'm just aware of everything but in
control of nothing. I'm not liking this feeling. It was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Helena is standing in front of me. She's talking to me but I don't
understand any of it. Her hand is cupping my chin and I can feel her
warmth...but I still can't hear her. I'm saying something. I don't
know what it is. Helena looks angry now. She's grabbing my arm and
forcing me to follow her. I stumble once but quickly gain my balance
and am able to keep up with her brisk pace.</p>
<p>We're with Barbara now. She doesn't look happy. Her face is set in a
scowl and mouth has become almost a straight line. I've never seen
her like this before. I think I'm going to be in trouble if I survive
this. Why didn't I just listen to myself when I said letting Sarah
into my mind was a bad idea. I should really listen to myself more
often...or less often however the case may be.</p>
<p>I'm stumbling again. I feel weaker. I'm saying something to Barbara
now but I still can't hear anything. Wow I feel like I'm going to
pass out. I have that feeling that people usually get when they've
been hanging upside down a little too long. I think I need to take a
little nap. I need to rest. Staying here is hard.</p>
<p>Wait. I think Barbara is trying to tell me something now, but I can't
understand her. I need to learn how to read lips. Helena is in front
of me again. I wonder where she came from. She's saying something
too. Don't what? I can't do what?</p>
<p>Wow. I'm tired. Sarah's in control now. She needs to take me back to
her body. Why aren't we leaving yet? Helena is still trying to tell
me something. It's the fifth of May? I like the bay? I'm a good lay?
I don't know what she's...oh it's 'don't go away'. I don't know where
I would go away too. I just want to rest a little bit. I hear that
sleep is actually good these days; four out of five doctors recommend
it.</p>
<p>She's trying to tell me something else now? Okay I need to
concentrate. I need to bring all that great superhero stuff to the
forefront now and concentrate on the words that are being said by
those gorgeous, luscious, beautiful lips. I really like her lips. I
like the way they feel on mine. I like how they feel on my skin. I
like the way they feel when she's...wasn't I supposed to be doing
something?</p>
<p>Yes. I need to concentrate. Helena's looking a little frustrated now.
Maybe she needs to take a nap too. I don't think she's been sleeping
too well lately. That's probably partially my fault. Actually it's
probably all my fault. I haven't been sleeping that well and I don't
like to be up alone. Helena keeps me occupied.</p>
<p>Okay. I really need to pay attention now. She's trying to tell me
something that must be very important. "Don't fall asleep." Wait. She
doesn't want me to fall asleep? And since when did I start hearing
voices that weren't my own in my head? Ah...she's touching my hand.</p>
<p>"Dinah you have to stay with us. Stay in control until we can break
you two apart."</p>
<p>I don't know if I can do that.</p>
<p>"Dinah, sweetie, you have to. You have to or you'll die."</p>
<p>How was she able to hear what I thought? Can people hear what I think
when their in my head or are they just hearing what I'm saying in my
head? I should really think about this after I take my nap.</p>
<p>"Dinah you can't take a nap. I'm going to get you to the hospital as
soon as I can but you have to stay awake. I know it's hard, baby, but
you're just gonna have to do it."</p>
<p>Well I guess if she insists I could stay up for a while longer.</p>
<p>Oh hey she's picking me up now and she's taking me somewhere. We're
moving pretty fast. This is actually kind of fun...in a stomach
churning type of way.</p>
<p>There are a lot of lights in this city. It also seems like there's a
lot of buildings too. We've seem to have landed on every single one.
She's really pushing herself hard. I can tell she's getting tired,
but that seems to be okay because we're at the hospital now. There
are a lot of beds in a hospital. Beds that are good for sleeping
in...dreaming in.</p>
<p>I wonder where we're going now. Hey, look that woman looks a lot like
me. I bet that's Sarah. She looks like shit. Her face is really pale
and her hair is greasy. When's the last time someone decided to give
this body a bath?</p>
<p>Helena's trying to get my attention again. I thought we already
worked out that I couldn't understand her? Oh...she's holding my hand
again. It feels nice.</p>
<p>"Dinah?" She's in my head again. I haven't figured out yet if she can
hear my thoughts or if she just hears me talking to myself. I should
think about that.</p>
<p>"Dinah that doesn't matter right now. You need to put her back in her
body."</p>
<p>I need to do what to who?</p>
<p>"Dinah you need to put Sarah back in her own body."</p>
<p>Oh, Sarah. Yeah she was the one that wanted to kill me.</p>
<p>"Yes she was. Now put her back in her own body."</p>
<p>But I don't know how to do that.</p>
<p>"Sure you do you just have to think about it."</p>
<p>She sounds a little scared. She shouldn't be scared. I should be
scared I don't know how to put her back in her own body.</p>
<p>"Neither of us have to be scared, Dinah. Just...you know what to do.
I know you do."</p>
<p>Well when she puts it that way then I guess all I really have to do
is put my hand on Sarah's forehead like so and just kind of will
Sarah out of me.</p>
<p>"Ow." I'm being held in Helena's arms and my head really hurts. But
on the plus side of this I can actually talk again. I'm still really
tired though.</p>
<p>I maneuver in Helena's arms so that I'm looking up into her eyes. I'm
not too entirely surprised to see tears there. I'm sure she's not too
surprised to see the same in my own.</p>
<p>"What the hell were you thinking?" she asks me before she places a
soft kiss on my forehead.</p>
<p>I don't know. I guess it was, "I thought about what I would do to get
back to you if I was lost."</p>
<p>Helena doesn't have a chance to respond because Sarah is moving on
the bed. I stand up and look down into the face of the woman
who...well I just look down at this woman.</p>
<p>She reaches over and takes my hand. I can feel things from her now.
She's happy. "Thank you so much," Her voice is hoarse, probably from
disuse.</p>
<p>"Welcome home," I tell her then turn to leave. I'm happy she's got
her life back but for me the cost was just too high. Helena is
following me out and as we reach the door a man steps through with a
little girl sleeping in his arms. He doesn't notice us at first, but
I'm guessing that because his attention is immediately drawn to
Sarah.</p>
<p>His big brown eyes light up and he rushes across the room. He screams
her name and the girl in his arms wakes up.</p>
<p>"Mommy?"</p>
<p>"Oh baby come here."</p>
<p>This is what Sarah wanted to get back to. She wanted her young child
and husband back. This is what she fought and killed for. I still
think the price was too high...but I wouldn't take that young girl's
mother away from her now or ever again.</p>

<chapter title="Epilogue">
<p>When we get back to the clock tower Barbara is waiting for us with
some hot chocolate. We all sit around the kitchen table and sip on
our warm drinks. Barbara doesn't yell at me for what I have done. I'm
not too sure I really expected her to. I made one of those really big
decisions tonight and I have to live with it. I've reunited a family
but who knows how many Sarah tore apart. Those families will never
get justice.</p>
<p>I'm not too sure what Reese could tell the jury for that murder
trial. The offender was in a coma at the time. It's kind of the
perfect alibi.</p>
<p>So this is the life of the superhero huh? I get to sit around here
with my very attractive girlfriend and very cool mentor and friend.
Who still hasn't told my girlfriend that she's leaving on a romantic
getaway with her surprisingly sweet boyfriend. I wonder how Helena
will react to that when the subject does arise. I could bring it up
now, but I won't. Until she starts telling me about all the secrets
of the clock tower then I'm not going to be telling her about
Barbara's personal life. Plus, I don't gossip. Often.</p>
<p>"So Dinah how are you feeling after letting someone invade your
body?" Okay so maybe Barbara will start yelling at me.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me that you wouldn't do the exact same thing I did?"</p>
<p>"No." Barbara and Helena answer together. I kind of actually believe
them too.</p>
<p>"Of course you would. We're heroes. We do the right thing."</p>
<p>Barbara turns and asks Helena, "I haven't let anyone take over my
body recently have you?"</p>
<p>Helena shakes her head no.</p>
<p>"Okay for a fact, I know that both of you are lying."</p>
<p>It takes them each a moment to catch up to what I'm saying but they
eventually do. Unfortunately Barbara's the only one that blushes.
Helena just looks at me and smirks.</p>
<p>"Cute," Barbara responds.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>Barbara shakes her head and Helena reaches over and takes my
hand. "Next time you decide to let anyone who isn't me invade your
body; please let me know about it first. At least give me a chance to
try and talk you out of it."</p>
<p>I know what she's admitting to me. I shouldn't have made this choice
on my own. We're a team. My body is no longer my own...in a way...I
guess.</p>
<p>"Next time you both will have full knowledge before someone takes
over my body."</p>
<p>They both nod and I know that we're okay now. I'll probably have a
few nightmares about this later on down the road, but we're okay. I'm
okay. I'm here with my family and we're just fine. The only person
missing is Reese, but I think it's going to take a while for both of
us to actually get used to caring about each other in the family sort
of way. I could always use the advice of a big brother though.
Tomorrow I'll definitely give him a call.</p>
