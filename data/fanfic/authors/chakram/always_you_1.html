<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 1 -->

<p><i>Okay. Tonights the night. Tonight is definiteley the night.</i> </p>
		<p>The beautiful brunette stared at herself in the mirror, gathering up every little ounce of courage she had inside her. <i>You can do it Sam, you can do it! Just go out there and tell them.</i></p>
		<p>Them being her family. Jane, her mother, Mike, her stepfather, and Brooke, her stepsister. Her beautiful, stunning, gorgeous stepsister. Sam quickly ended that train of thought and stared resolutely into the mirror, priming herself up for what lay ahead.</p>
		<p>She had been in the bathroom for over an hour, staring at herself, wondering whether her announcement to her family was the right thing to do. Sam had come to the realisation, months ago, that she was gay. Of course, denial wasn't just a river in Egypt, and Sam came up with a million and one excuses as to why she began having more than friendly thoughts towards women.</p>
		<p>So she had seen the odd episode of Xena now and then. It was a good show!  </p>
		<p><i>The odd</i> <i>episode now and then!</i> Sam thought sarcastically. <i>More like watched the show every</i> <i>chance I got and brought the dvd's!</i> But that didn't mean a thing! Just because she watched Xena and began scouring websites and reading fan fiction whenever she could didn't mean she was gay. It was a great show and a truly beautiful love story between two characters who just happened to be women. <i>And that Gabrielle sure had great abs. And that smile. And those beautiful green eyes...</i></p>
		<p>Sam's face reddened at the thought of some of the more interesting positions...adventures... she quickly amended,  the warrior and the bard had gotten themselves into when she first discovered the wonders of fan fiction.  It still didn't mean a thing, Sam told herself stubbornly. As a writer herself she was simply admiring the amazing talent of many of the fans online, ignoring the little voice in her head informing her of her preference for "plot what plot?" stories.</p>
		<p>And of course, dreaming of fucking Angelina Jolie wasn't enough to prove she was gay. Everybody wanted to fuck Angelina Jolie! The woman was hot!  Checking out women wherever she went meant nothing either. <i>Just simply appreciating the female form</i>, Sam happily told herself. Everybody knew that women were more lovely to look at, with their smooth skin and feminine curves. <i>Men really did look better with clothes on,</i> Sam thought to herself, <i>especially from the waist down</i><i>.</i></p>
		<p>These thoughts weren't enough to convince Sam of her new found love for women, so she continued merrily on her way, convincing herself that everything was fine.</p>
		<p>And it was, for a while. She and Brooke had come to a truce of sorts, and things weren't so tense between them. Her grades at school were good and she had even begun dating a new student at Kennedy High, that also shared her interest in writing.</p>
		<p>Alex.</p>
		<p>Tall, handsome Alex, with his gorgeous blonde hair, and deep hazel eyes.  And that smile. He had come up to their table one lunchtime, causing Sam to swoon off her seat, and unknowningly setting off a chain of events which led to her standing in the bathroom for over an hour, staring at her face in the mirror.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Excuse me? Sam?"</p>
		<p>She had been sitting with Harrison, Carmyn and Lily when Alex had interrupted them. She was barely paying attention to what they were talking about since she couldn't stop thinking about the movie she had seen for the first time on Saturday night. </p>
		<p>Bound. <i>Good movie, that.</i> </p>
		<p>From what she could gather Harrison had been gushing over some woman from one of the Star Trek series, Sixty Nine or something. Lily was on one of her crusades, berating him for ogling just her body, demanding to know what colour eyes Sixty Nine had. Harrison, of course, couldn't answer the question.</p>
		<p>"Uh, yeah. Something I could do for you?". <i>Wow, he's gorgeous.</i></p>
		<p>"Yeah. I've been told that I should speak to you if I wanted to write some articles for the school paper. Do you think we could get together some time?"</p>
		<p>"You want to write for the paper?" <i>No way!</i></p>
		<p>"Sure".</p>
		<p>"You want to write for the paper?" <i>Didn't I just ask him that?</i></p>
		<p>"Um, yeah. Is that a problem?"</p>
		<p>"No! I mean, no. Of course not. How about we meet after school to discuss it?"</p>
		<p>"Great. I'll see you around". And with a big smile, he left.</p>
		<p>"Wow! Sex on legs!" Carmyn gushed, not taking her eyes off his tight jeans.</p>
		<p>"I second that". Lily chimed in, already forgetting her argument with Harrison.</p>
		<p>"Mmmmmm". Sam helpfully added.</p>
		<p>"Oh, come on! He's not that hunky dory! So he has perfect hair, and perfect eyes, and a perfect body! Doesn't mean he's all that!" Harrison argued, wondering whether it was normal for a sixteen year old heterosexual guy to appreciate another guy's ass.</p>
		<p>The girls just stared at him. </p>
		<p>"I'm outta here". And with that, Harrison left the table, wanting to surround himself with guys, to talk about guy things. <i>Like football and golf, and he did have a nice ass though.</i> </p>
		<p>Meanwhile, at a table not far away, Brooke and Nicole watched the proceedings with varying degrees of interest. </p>
		<p>"Why the hell would a gorgeous guy like that go anywhere near the vicinity of Spam McPherson?" Nicole wondered, glaring in the direction of the brunette.</p>
		<p>"I'm just wondering that myself actually", Brooke replied, not too happy with what she had seen. <i>He likes her.</i> </p>
		<p>Being the most popular girl in school meant that it was mandatory to be desired by every heterosexual male student she came across, consequently making Brooke quite the expert on men. <i>And that look on his face means that he likes her.</i> Judging by Sam's reaction the feeling was mutual. </p>
		<p><i>And I don't like it.</i></p>
		<p>Brooke was comfortable with the fact that she had a crush on her stepsister. After all she had months to get used to the idea. <i>I would have to be blind to not see how hot she is!</i> But it was more than that. Sam was smart and funny and nice and Brooke genuinely liked her and deep down even loved the arguments and screaming matches they had. <i></i></p>
		<p><i>She's so beautiful when she's angry.</i></p>
		<p><i>A crush? No. I love her.</i> And she did, with an intensity that even scared her at times. She remembered one recent evening when she was home alone with Sam. It was a time where the two were actually getting along, the parents had gone out to dinner and they were sitting on the couch, close together,  Brooke thought with a smile, watching...<i>what was it again? Oh yeah, Dick. Great movie, that.</i></p>
		<p>Sam was laughing, genuinely laughing, a sight that Brooke rarely ever got to see. <i>Especially with the fighting and all.</i> She tore her eyes away from the screen, captivated by the brunette laughing beside her.</p>
		<p>Realising that Brooke was staring at her, she stopped, a little embarrassed.</p>
		<p>"What?" </p>
		<p>"Nothing. You're just..." <i>Beautiful and I love you and kiss me now, please.</i></p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing".</p>
		<p>Of course, the peace between them didn't last too long after that, but that night, watching a movie while sitting close to Sam was one of the greatest moments of her life. </p>
		<p><i>Gods, I'm a mushball.</i></p>
		<p>"He sort of looks like you, actually". Nicole informed her, cutting off her thoughts.</p>
		<p>"No way!" <i>Really?</i> </p>
		<p>"Yeah, way! He's like a male version of you".</p>
		<p>"I don't see it." <i>If Sam is attracted to him than maybe, just maybe...</i></p>
		<p>"Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"Why are you grinning like that? You're freaking me out!"</p>
		<p>"Sorry".</p>
		<p>Brooke continued to smile.</p>
