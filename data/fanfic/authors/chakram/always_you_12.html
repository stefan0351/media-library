<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 12 -->

<p>"Are we there yet?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Are we there yet?"</p>
		<p>"Sam?"</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"Don't make me hurt you".</p>
		<p>Silence.</p>
		<p>"Are we there yet?"</p>
		<p>"Aaaaarggghhh!"</p>
		<p>Sam smiled. <i>She</i>'s <i>so cute! </i></p>
		<p>She loved annoying Brooke.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I'm just teasing you, that's all."</p>
		<p>"It's okay." Brooke shot her a smile.</p>
		<p>Sam paused.</p>
		<p>"Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"We there yet?"</p>
		<p>"Damn it!"</p>
		<p>Sam laughed. She glanced at Brooke and smiled as the cheerleader tried hard to contain her own.</p>
		<p>"Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"Don't even THINK of saying it Sam." Brooke warned.</p>
		<p>Sam shot her an innocent look.</p>
		<p>"What I was going to say was, where the hell are you taking me?"</p>
		<p>Brooke shrugged.</p>
		<p>"I'm a little short of funds at the moment so I'm kidnapping you for ransom".</p>
		<p>"Is that so?"</p>
		<p>"Yep. Meet my darkside".</p>
		<p>"So, what's your asking price?"</p>
		<p>"One hundred dollars".</p>
		<p>"What?!" Sam cried, offended. Brooke shrugged.</p>
		<p>"I need new shoes. Besides, in this economic climate, I'll take what I can get".</p>
		<p>"You cheerleading tight ass! I want you to increase it!"</p>
		<p>Brooke glanced at her and smirked. "Two hundred dollars? I can do that."</p>
		<p>Sam smacked her on the arm. "Two hundred! More like two hundred billion!"</p>
		<p>Brooke laughed. "Yeah right! You're not worth that!"</p>
		<p>Sam smacked her again and glared. Brooke smiled, and quietly continued.</p>
		<p>"You're priceless, Sam".</p>
		<p>Embarrassed by her admission, Brooke kept her eyes straight ahead, focused on the winding road in front of them. Had she taken the chance, she would have seen a shocked, and suspiciously teary eyed, brunette frozen beside her.</p>
		<p>Unable to voice her reply, Sam simply leaned over and kissed her on the cheek.</p>
		<p>And for the second time that night, Brooke nearly swerved off the road.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Wow." Sam gaped at the scene in front of her.</p>
		<p>"I take it you like?" Brooke asked, smiling.</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful!" Sam replied, still taking in the stunning view of glowing, distant lights. They were sitting on the hood of Brooke's car which was parked on the side of a quiet stretch of road.</p>
		<p>"Yeah", Brooke agreed, not taking her eyes off Sam.</p>
		<p>"I was wondering where the hell you were taking me. I wasn't expecting this". Sam said, shooting Brooke a grin. "Where exactly are we?"</p>
		<p>"Mount Forstaff. A lot of people come up here to check out the view".</p>
		<p>"You've obviously been here before".</p>
		<p>"When I need some time on my own. You're actually the first person I've bought up here with me." Brooke admitted.</p>
		<p>"Well, I'm glad you did". Sam replied, touching Brooke's arm in thanks.</p>
		<p>"Yeah", Brooke said, embarrassed.</p>
		<p>Sam smiled. "As much as I want to sit here and simply enjoy the view with you, I'm guessing that you bought me up here to talk".</p>
		<p>"Your powers of perception astound me" Brooke joked.</p>
		<p>Sam laughed and gently punched her in the arm. "Smart ass".</p>
		<p>Brooke smiled then turned serious.</p>
		<p>"We need to talk about what happened at lunch today. And what's been happening between us."</p>
		<p>Sam froze. "Between us?"</p>
		<p>"You haven't noticed that lately we've been one step away from pulling each other's hair and clawing each other's faces?" Brooke asked, a little confused.</p>
		<p>"Of course I have", Sam replied, a little relieved. "How could I not?"</p>
		<p>Brooke stood up and faced her.</p>
		<p>"I am really sorry Sam, I know that I've morphed into Little Miss Grumpy Ass lately. I haven't been dealing with some things all to well, but that's no excuse to take it out on you and Alex".</p>
		<p>"I can't believe it!" was Sam's response.</p>
		<p>"What?" Brooke asked.</p>
		<p>"You actually got his name right!" She answered, a little surprised.</p>
		<p>Brooke laughed. "I may be blonde and a cheerleader, but I'm not that dumb!"</p>
		<p>"You have no idea how much that annoyed him", Sam confided.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I did. Why do you think I kept doing it," Brooke said, smiling.</p>
		<p>Sam shook her head, trying not to laugh. "Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"Why don't you like Alex?"</p>
		<p>Brooke froze.</p>
		<p><i>How the hell do I explain that?</i></p>
		<p>Buying herself some time, she settled herself beside Sam and focused her gaze on the view in front of them.</p>
		<p>"What makes you think that?" She asked instead.</p>
		<p>Sam shot her a disbelieving look. "You're kidding me right?"</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed. "Look, I barely know the guy".</p>
		<p>"Which is exactly my point! You are not a vindictive person Brooke, despite the horrifying company you surround yourself with".</p>
		<p>"I don't know. I just...I don't know". Brooke paused. "Haven't you ever met someone who immediately rubs you up the wrong way? They don't necessarily do anything to you, they just...annoy you."</p>
		<p>Brooke prayed that Sam would accept her lame reason.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I have", she replied.</p>
		<p>"Who?" Brooke asked, curious.</p>
		<p>"You".</p>
		<p>Brooke stared at her for a moment, then laughed.</p>
		<p>"We didn't have the best of starts did we?" She said, smiling.</p>
		<p>Sam grinned back. "Talk about stating the obvious".</p>
		<p>She turned her gaze to the sky, her expression thoughtful.</p>
		<p>"You know, I think we're going to be okay", she finally said.</p>
		<p>Brooke nudged Sam with her shoulder and smiled.</p>
		<p>"I think you might be right".</p>
