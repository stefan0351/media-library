<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 6 -->

<p>"What's so funny?" Sam demanded to know. She was tempted to check Brooke for a fever but remained seated.</p>
		<p>Brooke stopped laughing, but couldn't stop herself from smiling. She settled herself beside Sam and just shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about it". Brooke glanced at Sam. "How was your date anyway?" </p>
		<p>Brooke wondered why she insisted on torturing herself. </p>
		<p><i>As if falling for my straight stepsister wasn't bad enough.</i> </p>
		<p>She was tired and confused and she really didn't want to feel any worse by listening to details of Sam's wonderful date with Adam, Alex, whatever, but she just couldn't help herself. </p>
		<p>She needed to know.</p>
		<p>"The restaurant we went to was wonderful. Great Italian food, nice romantic setting, I should take you sometime." Sam paused.</p>
		<p><i>Shit! I can't believe I just said that.</i></p>
		<p>Brooke raised her right eyebrow and smirked. "I might just take you up on that offer".</p>
		<p>Sam blushed and cleared her throat. "Yeah. Um. Yeah. What was I saying? Oh yeah, nice food". </p>
		<p>Brooke smiled to herself. Sam was so cute when she got all flustered.</p>
		<p>"We just spent the night talking. He's a great guy, I really like him".</p>
		<p><i>Yeah, I bet. </i></p>
		<p>"You seeing him again?".</p>
		<p>"Yeah".</p>
		<p>"Oh".</p>
		<p>Silence.</p>
		<p>"Sam?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not in love with Josh".</p>
		<p>"You're not?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Oh".</p>
		<p>They settled into an awkward silence, one trying to ignore the relief she was feeling, the other fighting back the tears.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"<i>There's a moment when I look at you</i></p>
		<p><i>And no speech is left in me</i></p>
		<p><i>My tongue breaks</i></p>
		<p><i>And fire races under my skin </i></p>
		<p><i>And I tremble</i></p>
		<p><i>And grow pale</i></p>
		<p><i>For I am dying of such love</i></p>
		<p><i>Or so it seems to me".</i></p>
		<p>Sam quickly glanced around the room, making sure that no one was around. Satisfied that she was safe, she quickly wiped away a few tears and blew her nose.</p>
		<p><i>God, how romantic!</i></p>
		<p>Of course, it would take the threat of somebody torturing her, or somebody  torturing her with N'Sync, for Sam to ever consider admitting that to anyone. </p>
		<p><i>You don't share your feelings, you don't get hurt.</i></p>
		<p>That philosphy had kept her in good stead ever since her father had passed away. His death had nearly destroyed her and she never wanted to feel anything like that again, making a vow that day to never let anyone get too close.</p>
		<p>Her mother and Mike.</p>
		<p>Carmen, Lily, Harrison. </p>
		<p>Even Alex. </p>
		<p>She loved them, trusted them but even they were kept at arm's length.</p>
		<p>Brooke.</p>
		<p>Sam was quite the master at denying her feelings but even she couldn't escape the fact that the one person who could make her, or break her, was Brooke.</p>
		<p><i>I wonder if she realises the power she has over me?</i></p>
		<p>She didn't even want to think about how the blonde cheerleader her feel. </p>
		<p>It was too strong. </p>
		<p>So Sam did what she did best. She pretended these feelings didn't exist.</p>
		<p>The logical part of herself knew that it wasn't a healthy way to live one's life but she ignored that too. Life was fine. She was happy and content and had everything she needed and wanted.</p>
		<p><i>You keep telling yourself that dear, and you just might believe it.</i></p>
		<p>Growling at the annoying voice, who, as of late, kept permanent residence in her head, Sam picked up the remote and rewound the tape.</p>
		<p>She had to watch that scene again. </p>
		<p><i>Those words.</i></p>
		<p><i>That's how I feel.</i></p>
		<p><i>About...</i></p>
		<p>Brooke walked in just as Sam pressed play.</p>
		<p>"What are you watching?"</p>
		<p><i>Shit! </i></p>
		<p>Sam stopped the tape.</p>
		<p>"You watch Xena?" Brooke asked, laughing.</p>
		<p>"Got a problem with that?" Sam replied in a defensive tone. "Have you ever seen it?"</p>
		<p>"As if! It looks lame".</p>
		<p>Brooke stepped closer and took a good look at Sam's face. Had she been crying? </p>
		<p>"The show that bad, huh?" Brooke asked, not sure why she was being such a bitch.</p>
		<p>Sam stood up and confronted Brooke, who stepped back, surprised by the sudden assault. </p>
		<p>"What's happened Brooke? Satan suck out all the goodness out of you?" </p>
		<p><i>Why are you doing this to me? </i></p>
		<p>With one last glare, Sam slammed the door and left.</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed, wishing she could take back the last few minutes. She didn't mean to lash out, but her grumpy side always got the better of her whenever Sam had plans to go out with Wusboy. </p>
		<p>It had been over a month since Sam had first started seeing whatever his name is, and as the weeks progressed, their relationship had slowly started reverting back to the old days, where arguements and insults and constant sniping were the main feature between them.</p>
		<p>She sat down on the couch. </p>
		<p><i>Xena, huh? Let's see what's gotten you so interested, Sam.</i></p>
		<p>Pressing play, Brooke watched as the Warrior handed Gabrielle the poem for her birthday present.</p>
		<p>"<i>There's a moment when I look at you</i></p>
		<p><i> And no speech is left in me...."</i></p>
		<p>Brooke sat, frozen, as the scene faded to black. </p>
		<p><i>Those words. </i></p>
		<p><i>That's how I feel. </i></p>
		<p><i>About her.</i> </p>
		<p>She rewound the tape.</p>
