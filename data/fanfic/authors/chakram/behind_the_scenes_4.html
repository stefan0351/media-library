<!-- Behind the Scenes \ Part 3 -->

<p>Rob shifted nervously in his seat as Sam and Brooke stared at him. </p>

		<p>"What?" Sam finally asked, wanting to make sure she heard correctly.  She was certain that Rob couldn't have said what she thought he just said. </p>

		<p>No friggin way. </p>

		<p>"Alex and Jeri will become a couple, Sam" Rob confirmed quietly, glancing at his colleagues, his expression a desperate cry for help. They looked away suddenly, finding the floor utterly fascinating. </p>

		<p>"A couple?" Brooke asked, finally finding her voice. "In the gay way?"</p>

		<p>"Yes Brooke, a couple in the gay way" Rob stated, inwardly amused as both actresses stared at him with identical bewildered expressions. He sat up in surprise as Sam started to laugh hysterically.</p>

		<p>"That is sooo funny! You almost had me there Rob! Good one!" Sam replied between fits of laughter. "Alex and Jeri, a couple!" She continued chuckling, stopping when she realised no one else found this as amusing as she did. </p>

		<p>"Why isn't anyone laughing?" Sam turned towards the writers. "Helen? Please tell me this is a joke! Come on now, this isn't funny anymore! Sarah?"</p>

		<p>"It's true, Sam" Sarah replied with a shrug. "It wasn't our idea to do this but we have orders from above." </p>

		<p>"You don't expect us to believe that do you?" Sam asked, bluntly. </p>

		<p>"This is Gen X-TV, remember? You know, "Television with an Edge" Jack commented sarcastically, emphasizing the stations motto with quotation marks. "They think having your characters in a sexual relationship will boost the ratings."</p>

		<p>"Which it will!" Rob continued, enthusiastically. "Look at Xena and Gabrielle! Willow and Tara! Look how popular they are!"</p>

		<p>"And look what happened to them! Xena got beheaded and Tara got shot!" Sam exclaimed. "How is the Alex and Jeri relationship going to end? One of us getting run over by a car?"</p>

		<p>Brooke snickered quietly.</p>

		<p>"This is just a ratings stunt!" Sam continued heatedly. "I bet they're more interested in doing an "Ally McBeal" and having them make out for a couple of episodes, before Alex and Jeri realise men are the true way to go."</p>

		<p>"I admit that's what they probably want, but we're not going to let that happen" Helen reassured them. "This will be a proper relationship and the lesbian isn't going to die in the end."</p>

		<p>"The fans want this and the show could use the extra spark" Rob chimed in. "Look, I wasn't too fond of the idea either, but it's really grown on me. The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that this could work."</p>

		<p>"Hello? Are we the only ones getting oxygen in this room?"  Brooke replied finally, gesturing to Sam and herself. "Have we conveniently forgotten that they're stepsisters?"</p>

		<p>"And your point?" Rob asked.</p>

		<p>"It's practically incest!" Sam cried out.</p>

		<p>"It isn't and you bloody well know it!" Rob replied, finally losing his temper. "I don't care what problems you two have with each other! You are going to do this!"</p>

		<p>"I don't have issues playing a lesbian character, but why with her?" Sam asked with annoyance. Brooke shot her a glare, preparing to offer an insult of her own.</p>

		<p>"Okay, Sam. We'll pair Alex up with Stacey" Rob interrupted innocently. "I'm sure you will love the extra time you get to spend with Nicole on set." </p>

		<p>"Brooke it is then!" Sam replied immediately. "Really, Brooke's fine!"</p>

		<p>"No she isn't" Brooke muttered sarcastically, slumping further into her seat. </p>

		<p>"Great! I knew you'd come around!" Rob exclaimed with a grin. He stood up and adjusted his tie, preparing to offer the troops one of the many inspirational speeches he was world famous for. Realizing the gesture, everybody groaned inwardly, glancing desperately at the clock and making themselves comfortable. </p>

		<p>"This, ladies and gentlemen, will be a love story that viewers will talk about for years to come! Daring! Dramatic! Bold! A love story that will unite the world, and make the audience laugh! Cry! Cheer! A love story that will have all who see it on the edge of their seats begging for more! We can make history!"</p>

		<p>Rob paused dramatically, raising his arms in the air.</p>

		<p>"Can't you see THE VISION!!!"</p>

		<p>Rob grinned at them proudly before he walked out the door, leaving the others staring after him in bored silence.</p>

		<p>"Who thinks he is on drugs?" Jake finally asked, raising his hand.</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah..."</p>

		<p>"Absolutely off his face..."</p>

		<p>"Definitely..."</p>

		<p>"Was there ever any doubt?"</p>
