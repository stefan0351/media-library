<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 2 -->

<p>"You know, he sort of looks like...someone." Carmyn said, the girls still discussing the gorgeousness that was Alex.</p>
		<p>"You got that too?" Lily said, turning to Carmyn. </p>
		<p>"Yeah. I mean, I couldn't really place it at first but now that I think about it, he sort of looks like Brooke". </p>
		<p>"No he doesn't!" Sam cried, her eyes widening with horror.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, he does".</p>
		<p>"No, he doesn't".</p>
		<p>"Yeah, he does". Lily joined in this time, backing up Carmyn.</p>
		<p>"No. He. Does. Not". And with that Sam fled the table.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. He. Does". Carmyn said to the empty space, wondering for the millionth time if Sam had finally lost her mind.</p>

		<p><i>After school tv sux. </i></p>
		<p>Brooke continued to flip through the channels, not finding anything remotely interesting. <i>Okay. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or Pokemon?</i></p>
		<p>She was saved from making that very difficult decision when the door bell rang. <i>Who the hell is that? </i>It couldn't have been Nicole or Mary Cherry since she knew they had gone shopping. Brooke, to the surprise of her friends, wanted to go home instead. </p>
		<p><i>Preferring to catch Sammy at home, huh Brookie?</i></p>
		<p>Opening the door, she felt a surge of annoyance when she saw who had turned up. <i></i></p>
		<p><i>Him.</i></p>
		<p>"Yes". <i>That sounded civil enough.</i></p>
		<p>"Hi. Is Sam home?" <i>Why is she glaring at me?</i></p>
		<p>"Hi Alex".</p>
		<p>Both turned to see Sam coming down the stairs. <i>Oh my god, she's beautiful.</i> Brooke, unaware, that the exact same thought was ringing inside Alex's head. </p>
		<p>"Hi Sam. You look great."</p>
		<p>"Thankyou, please come in. Alex, this is my stepsister Brooke. Brooke, Alex."</p>
		<p>"Hi, nice to meet you Brooke".</p>
		<p>"Yeah". Brooke walked passed and resumed her position on the couch, feeling a little guilty about being so curt with him, but she really couldn't help it. He was handsome and nice, and worst of all, Sam liked him, in the girl likes boy sort of way. <i> </i></p>
		<p><i>Green eyes doesn't suit you Brookie.</i></p>
		<p>"Alex, why don't you head on through that way, into the kitchen. I'll join you shortly, okay?"</p>
		<p>Once Sam was sure that Alex was out of hearing range, she turned her eyes on Brooke, her face clearly displaying the anger and confusion she felt. <i>Oh oh, hear it comes. Sam explosion. </i></p>
		<p><i>Yay!</i></p>
		<p>"What the hell is wrong with you?"</p>
		<p>"Whatever do you mean?"</p>
		<p>"Could you try being any more rude?"</p>
		<p>"If you want me to".</p>
		<p>"Why are you being like this? Did he say something to you?"</p>
		<p>"No. He just interrupted my television viewing, that's all".</p>
		<p>"I didn't know you were such an avid fan of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."</p>
		<p>"Yes, well, we all have different tastes".</p>
		<p>"Whatever. I don't have time for this".</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed. <i>So much for spending quality time with Sam. Should've gone shopping with the girls. </i>And with that, she focused her attention on the television screen, wondering how the hell that show ever became successful. </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sam gazed dreamily across the kitchen table, as Alex continued browsing through the past issues of the school newspaper. He had bought with him some of his own written pieces, and if they were any indication, Alex would no doubt be a real pleasure to work with. </p>
		<p><i>Not to mention gorgeous too look at.</i></p>
		<p><i>He does look like Brooke. They could be twins! </i>An annoying voice replied in her head.</p>
		<p><i>Does not!</i></p>
		<p><i>Does too!</i></p>
		<p><i>Does not!</i></p>
		<p><i>Does too!</i></p>
		<p>"Shut your hole!" </p>
		<p>"Excuse me?" Alex looked up, confused.</p>
		<p><i>Did I just say that out loud?</i></p>
		<p>"Sorry, I, uh, was just thinking. Please, continue". Sam replied, her face red with embarrassment. </p>
		<p>"You know, you are a talented writer."</p>
		<p>"Thankyou. So are you." </p>
		<p>"Does that mean I'm in?" </p>
		<p>"Of course. You'll prove a valuable addition to the team!" </p>
		<p>"Great! I look forward to working with you". Alex smiled. As did Sam, and this is how Brooke found them as she wandered into the kitchen.</p>
		<p><i>Kill me. Kill me now.</i></p>
		<p>"Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt". Brooke said, not sounding sorry at all. "Anyone want a drink?".</p>
		<p>"No, thanks Brooke. I better get going. It was nice to meet you".</p>
		<p>"Mmmm." Brooke replied, smiling at him, happy at the thought of Alex leaving.</p>
		<p>"Sam, thankyou for this opportunity. I really appreciate it". </p>
		<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. <i>What a suck!</i></p>
		<p>"Before I go, I was wondering..."</p>
		<p>"Yes?" both Sam and Brooke replied. Sam glared at Brooke.</p>
		<p>"If you would be interested in going out to dinner with me tomorrow night?"</p>
		<p>Brooke inwardly groaned. <i>No! Say no! With the power of my mind, you will say no, Sam McPherson!</i></p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p><i>Damn.</i></p>
		<p>"I'd love to".</p>
		<p>"Great! How about I pick you up, at seven?" Alex grinned, showing off his dimples.</p>
		<p><i>Oh great, </i>Brooke thought, <i>how could she resist that?!</i></p>
		<p>"Sounds good. I'll see you then".</p>
		<p>Sam showed Alex to the door, while Brooke slumped into the chair with a sigh. <i>Banging my head against the table sounds good. </i></p>
		<p>So she did.</p>
