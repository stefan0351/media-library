<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 29 -->

<p>Sam held Brooke from behind as they continued watching the words in silence. She honestly had no idea how long they'd been standing there. It could have been ten seconds, it could have been ten minutes and with each passing moment Sam began to wonder whether this was a good idea after all. Brooke hadn't said a word, and she did not dare remove her arms which encircled the blonde's waist. </p>
<p>It was the only thing keeping Sam upright.</p>
<p>She couldn't go on like this. She had to know what Brooke was thinking.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to say anything?" Sam asked softly, her chin resting on Brooke's uninjured shoulder.</p>
<p>"I don't want to move," Brooke finally replied. "I'm afraid that if I do, I'll wake up."</p>
<p>"This is real Brooke. You're not dreaming," Sam responded with a smile, her fears and doubts disappearing with the blonde's simple words. </p>
<p>She straightened up, but didn't let go, as Brooke finally turned around and faced her. They gazed at each other with silly grins on their faces before Sam spoke up in amusement. </p>
<p>"You know, this is the part where you kiss the girl."</p>
<p>Brooke didn't hesitate this time, her right hand gently cupping Sam's face as she leant forward and captured the brunette's full lips within her own. She had spent many days and nights dreaming of this very moment and she noted absently that her imagination was truly lacking when compared to the real thing.</p>
<p>Her lips tingled, her heart thudded loudly in her chest and a warm glow was rapidly spreading throughout her body, consuming her. She opened her eyes as they parted, smiling at the look of wonder on Sam's face.</p>
<p>"I had no idea."</p>
<p>Brooke gently rested her forehead against Sam's. "Neither did I."</p>
<p>Sam pulled away slightly after several moments. "Kiss me again, please."</p>
<p>"God, yes" Brooke replied with a slight growl, the passion between them escalating quickly as the months of repressed sexual tension made itself known. Sam's hands traveled from her waist, sliding up her back, tangling themselves in Brooke's hair as she pressed herself more firmly against the blonde. Waves of pleasure swept through her body at the contact, as Brooke sucked insistently on her lower lip before parting Sam's lips with her tongue. </p>
<p>They continued this way for several minutes, Sam eternally grateful for Brooke's firm hold on her waist, she was fairly certain her knees would have given way long ago. Realizing that lack of oxygen was fast becoming an issue, Sam pulled her lips away reluctantly and nuzzled the blonde's neck, planting several kisses there as she tried to regain control of her erratic breathing.</p>
<p>"The things you do to me" Brooke muttered softly, amazed at the multitude of feelings hammering at her from all sides. "I am so in love with you." </p>
<p>"And I love you, Brooke McQueen." Sam replied reverently before she kissed her again, pulling away before things got too heated. She stepped back and held out her hand, smiling as Brooke immediately reached for it. "I want nothing more than to stand here with you, but it's late, and we need to head home before we're grounded again."</p>
<p>Catching Brooke's disappointed look, Sam smiled and squeezed her hand gently. "It definitely doesn't mean the night's over. I'm not letting you go just yet."</p>
<p>"Good, because the way I'm feeling, sleep is the furthest thing from my mind" Brooke replied, causing Sam to blush. Brooke didn't notice however, as she glared at her injured shoulder. "Of all the weeks to land on my ass..."</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "At least it got us talking again."</p>
<p>Brooke shot her a guilty look. "I'm sorry Sam. I shouldn't have treated you like that. Seeing you with Jessie just...."</p>
<p>"I understand" Sam interrupted. "I think we need to buy Jessie a present actually."</p>
<p>"What for?" Brooke asked, darkly. "Kissing you?"</p>
<p>"For making me see sense" Sam explained, amused at Brooke's jealousy. "She knew about my feelings for you and guessed that you felt the same way. I spoke with her earlier tonight, and she told me, in no uncertain terms, that if I didn't tell you how I felt, she'd kick my ass."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. Yep, she owed Jessie big time. She let go of Sam's hand and searched the grass for several moments, picking up a large rock as she walked over to the tree. </p>
<p><i>Sam loves Brooke</i></p>
<p><i>Brooke loves Sam</i></p>
<p>"What do you think?" Brooke asked as Sam joined her.</p>
<p>"Perfect" Sam responded happily, rewarding Brooke with a quick, but thorough kiss.</p>
<p>Walking back home, Brooke smiled at the sight of their tightly clasped hands. She still found it hard to believe, never imagining that Sam would be the first to reveal her feelings. In her fantasies, she was the one who always took the first step.</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"When did you write that? Those words on the tree?" </p>
<p>"The night of Michael's party" Sam responded shyly, glancing at Brooke. "Do you remember that, uh, dance?" </p>
<p>Brooke stopped suddenly, surprising Sam with a short, but heated kiss. </p>
<p>"How could I forget?" Brooke asked, her voice thick with desire, her eyes sweeping hungrily over Sam's body. "You drove me crazy. And once this damn shoulder is healed, I'm going to..." Brooke stopped, the expression on her face conveying more than words ever could.</p>
<p>"Let's hope for a speedy recovery then" Sam finally replied, repressing the urge to jump Brooke then and there. In the space of an hour, she had been reduced to a sex maniac. Walking on, she continued her explanation in the hopeless attempt to distract herself from the many lustful thoughts invading her mind.</p>
<p>"After the, um, dance, I went to Alex and we nearly..." She faltered. "You got me so fired up and I felt so bad that you were causing these feelings instead of him. I tried to go through with it, but I just couldn't. I left and went to the park and sat there for ages, just thinking about everything."</p>
<p>Brooke listened quietly, pulling Sam close as she continued. "I was so confused. I mean, what do I do? Live a lie or let him go and love from afar, someone I thought would never love me back? I'm just fortunate that everything worked out in the end." She paused, thinking sadly of Alex. "For most of us anyway."</p>
<p>Brooke nodded sympathetically. If Alex felt even a quarter of what she felt for Sam, he would never get over her.</p>
<p>"He figured out that I was in love with you" Brooke admitted, with a sheepish glance. "I wasn't very good at hiding my feelings I guess." </p>
<p>"He did?" Sam asked, surprised. "He never told me."</p>
<p>"It was just before you broke up with him. We had a little chat" Brooke explained wryly. "Did you tell him the real reason why you ended it?"</p>
<p>Sam shook her head. "He was hurting enough, I don't think he needed to hear I was leaving him because of you."</p>
<p>Brooke nodded. "Josh knows of my feelings for you."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"And Nicole." Brooke waited for the explosion and was not disappointed.</p>
<p>"WHAT?! Are you INSANE?!" Sam yelled, loud enough to wake the entire street. She began pacing, her arms flailing about as she continued with her tirade, not happy when Brooke simply stood there and laughed. "What's so funny?"</p>
<p>"Sam, she figured it out weeks ago."</p>
<p>"She did?" Sam asked, confused. "And she didn't do anything about it?"</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged. "She wasn't very happy and she threatened too, but I told her where she could stick it, basically. I gave her a choice. Me or my popularity. She chose me."</p>
<p>"Maybe she has a heart after all" Sam commented awkwardly. </p>
<p>"She does" Brooke confirmed, "she just has trouble showing it."</p>
<p>"Especially to me" Sam replied with a smirk, as they continued their walk home. She paused as a thought struck her. "This doesn't mean we have to get along, does it?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. "It wouldn't hurt to try."</p>
<p>"Oh my god, Mary Cherry" Sam replied with horror, causing Brooke to laugh loudly. "We're not going to tell her, are we?"</p>
<p>"She's still overseas, trying to find a specialist for her feet" Brooke explained, both girls shuddering at the image Mary Cherry had traumatized them all with. "Besides, I think we should keep this new development to ourselves before we tell everyone."</p>
<p>"I agree" Sam replied. She cast Brooke a worried glance. "And what about..."</p>
<p>"I don't even want to think about that" Brooke interrupted gently. She couldn't even begin to imagine how that particular conversation would go.</p>
<p><i>Oh hi Dad, Jane. How are you? Great. Oh, guess what? Sam and I are a couple now. You know, in the gay way. Um, dad, Jane just fainted. You're going to join her? Okay, just watch the table, you don't want to hit your head on the way down.</i></p>
<p>"I think I'll join you on that river denial" Sam replied with a slight smile. </p>
<p>"We should settle into this first, before we start bothering with how everyone else feels." Brooke suggested. "Sound like a plan?"</p>
<p>Sam nodded her agreement as they walked up the driveway to the front door, the darkness making it difficult finding the right key. Brooke wasn't helping matters as she stood behind her, her lips firmly attached to Sam's neck.</p>
<p>"Brooke."</p>
<p>"Mmm?"</p>
<p>"You're not helping."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to stop?"</p>
<p>"I never said that."</p>
<p>Brooke smirked as Sam finally managed to open the door, walking into the living room to find Jane and Mike sitting on the couch, watching television.</p>
<p>"Hi girls" Mike greeted cheerfully. He glanced at his watch. "Right on time, too."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I'm not interested in washing the dishes alone for another two weeks" Sam commented wryly, slapping Brooke on the arm as she started laughing. "It's not funny, you!" She scolded, the smile taking the sting out of her voice.</p>
<p>"I thought it was" Brooke replied teasingly, remembering how she stood beside Sam every day of her punishment, helpfully offering advice on how to correctly go about washing the dishes, each time resulting in Sam chasing her around the kitchen with a wooden spoon.</p>
<p>Jane watched in amusement as they continued teasing each other, happy that they were once again on speaking terms. Both girls had been moody and irritable for most of this week, her questions and offers to listen regarded with stony silence. </p>
<p>"I take it you had a good time" Jane commented with a smile, amused as both girls responded with huge grins.</p>
<p>"You can say that" Brooke replied vaguely.</p>
<p>"What did you do?" Mike asked absently, his attention focused on the television.</p>
<p>"Nothing really" Sam answered, casting Brooke a smile. "We went for a walk."</p>
<p>"How's your arm Brooke?" Jane asked. "Not too sore, I hope."</p>
<p>"It's annoying, but fine." Brooke replied, pretending to yawn. "Well, I'm pretty tired, so I should get to bed." She glanced at Sam with a pointed look.</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too" Sam continued, catching on. "Have a good night."</p>
<p>"We'll be gone for most of the day tomorrow" Jane informed them before they headed upstairs. "We've been invited to play golf with some friends, so you might wake up to find us gone."</p>
<p>"Great!" Sam replied enthusiastically. For once the gods were smiling down on them. Jane laughed as Sam shot her a sheepish look. "I mean, have fun." </p>
<p>"Sure you do" Jane commented with a smile. "Good night, girls."</p>
<p>Once they reached their bedrooms, Sam stopped uncertainly, unsure of what to say as they regarded each other in awkward silence. She knew she didn't want to sleep alone and figured being direct was the best approach.</p>
<p>"Your room or mine?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled, relieved. "Mine?"</p>
<p>"I'll meet you there in a few" Sam replied, kissing Brooke on the cheek before she headed inside, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>Heading into her own room, a permanent smile attached to her face, Brooke slowly got ready for bed, and not for the first time, cursed her stupid shoulder. She felt like taking off her sling and choking someone with it. Slipping into bed, Brooke smiled as she heard Sam enter. </p>
<p>Making sure the bedroom door was locked, Sam walked over and slid under the covers. Mindful of her sore shoulder, Sam positioned herself so that she straddled Brooke's right thigh, her elbows on each side of Brooke's head. </p>
<p>Wordlessly, she leant forward and greeted her with a long, searing kiss.</p>
