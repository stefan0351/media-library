<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 9 -->

<p>"You okay?" Nicole asked.</p>
		<p>Brooke glanced at her. After leaving the cafeteria, they had gone straight to the Novak, where they had sat in silence, contemplating the events of the last ten minutes.</p>
		<p>Brooke shrugged. "Yeah". </p>
		<p>"I can go punch him if you like". Nicole offered.</p>
		<p>The head cheerleader laughed, shaking her head. "Thanks for the offer Nic, but no".</p>
		<p>Nicole stood up suddenly and began to pace. </p>
		<p>Something isn't right here. </p>
		<p>There was something she wasn't seeing and it was driving her insane. She had kept a close eye on Brooke for the past several weeks, perfectly aware that something was up, but no matter how often she asked, or how many threats she dished out, Brooke hadn't said a word.</p>
		<p>And what had just happened with Alex in the cafeteria didn't make that much sense either. To be honest, she didn't really understand why Brooke took such a disliking to the guy. He was good looking, quite popular, and from all accounts, pretty damn nice .</p>
		<p>Brooke wasn't the type of girl to hold grudges for no reason. </p>
		<p>She stopped.</p>
		<p>Her weird behaviour had started when Alex had come onto the scene.</p>
		<p>Maybe Alex was right? Maybe she was jealous that he was dating Spam?</p>
		<p>Nicole shook her head, dismissing the thought. No. It wasn't that. Brooke had laughed in his face, and Nicole knew that it was genuine. <i>She's not interested in him. </i></p>
		<p>So if she isn't jealous of Spam, than what the hell could it be?</p>
		<p>Nicole growled. Spam McPherson. </p>
		<p>It had to involve her somehow. It was always about Spam. </p>
		<p>Nicole replayed the Brooke/Alex confrontation in her head, trying to connect that with everything that had gone on in the past several weeks.</p>
		<p>The glaring, the anger, the body language, Brooke's unexplainable dislike of Alex, her weird, jealous behaviour ever since he came along.</p>
		<p>And Spam. </p>
		<p>She frowned.</p>
		<p>If she didn't know any better, Nicole would have said that the situation was similiar to two guys going territorial over a girl.</p>
		<p>But Brooke wasn't a guy.</p>
		<p>Nicole froze. </p>
		<p><i>Oh fuck. </i></p>
		<p><i>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!</i></p>
		<p>She took a deep breath and slowly walked back to Brooke, the shock plainly clear.</p>
		<p>Brooke, meanwhile had watched Nicole's pacing with some sense of amusement, but tensed up when she saw the expression on her face.</p>
		<p>"Nic? Something wrong?" She asked, not really sure she wanted to hear the answer.</p>
		<p>"Tell me it isn't true." Nicole pleaded.</p>
		<p>"What are you talking about?" Brooke asked, suddenly feeling like she wanted to throw up. </p>
		<p><i>She knows. Shit!</i></p>
		<p>Nicole began to pace again, shaking her head, throwing her arms in the air.</p>
		<p>"It all makes sense now. Everything! You've been acting like a jealous freak ever since he got here and I thought it was because you wanted him. But I was only half right".</p>
		<p>She paused and stopped.</p>
		<p>"You're jealous of him, because you want her".</p>

		<p>Sam sat in the library, trying to focus on the book in front of her. To say she wasn't succeeding was an understatement. She looked around and found only three students and a librarian present. She laughed to herself. </p>
		<p>The school library was the perfect place to go if you wanted to be alone. </p>
		<p>She looked up. Or maybe not. </p>
		<p>She sighed as Alex walked in. She didn't want to speak to him at the moment, especially not in the confused state she was in. He stopped in front of her, uncertain. </p>
		<p>"Mind if I sit down?" He asked.</p>
		<p>Sam shrugged. "Sure".</p>
		<p>He ran his fingers through his hair, trying to read the expression on Sam's face. He couldn't. And it suddenly dawned on him. </p>
		<p><i>I barely know you.</i></p>
		<p>They had been dating for weeks and he barely knew her. </p>
		<p>"I'm sorry Sam." He said, breaking the awkward silence between them.</p>
		<p>"It's not me you should be apologizing too." She replied.</p>
		<p>"I know". He looked away. "I crossed the line and as soon as I see Brooke, I'll apologize first thing." </p>
		<p>He stopped, trying to organise his thoughts.</p>
		<p>"Before I went and said....that thing...I said, I had every right to confront her. From the first moment we met, she hasn't been nice to me, and you've told me yourself that lately she hasn't been that nice to you either". </p>
		<p>He paused.</p>
		<p>"Why are you angry at me?"</p>
		<p>She looked at him. "I'm not angry at you Alex." </p>
		<p>Alex stared back, clearly not believing her.</p>
		<p>"Don't lie to me Sam. I admit that I never should have made that last crack, but everything said before that was more than valid. I know that I could have gone about confronting Brooke in a more....mature way....but can you blame me for finally losing it? For god's sake, she can't even get my name right!" Alex finished, frustrated.</p>
		<p>"I understand Alex, and frankly, I'm surprised that you didn't confront her sooner. That said, whatever happens between Brooke and me is none of your concern, and there was no need for you to bring that up in front of the whole school", Sam replied, her voice rising with annoyance.</p>
		<p>"Not my concern? Not my concern? Do you realise what you have been like lately?"</p>
		<p>Sam looked away. "I don't know what you mean".</p>
		<p>"There it is again! You don't tell me anything!" He stopped, lowering his voice. "I'm your boyfriend Sam, you can tell me things! That's what couples do!" </p>
		<p>She glared at him. "Thanks for the advice, Oprah".</p>
		<p>He reached out and covered her hand with his, his tone pleading.</p>
		<p>"I don't want to fight with you Sam. Please talk to me." </p>
		<p>He continued when Sam didn't respond. </p>
		<p>"I know that you've had things on your mind, Brooke being the main reason, and it's obviously getting to you. You've been quiet and withdrawn and I want you to know that I'm here if you ever want to talk about it". He paused. "You need to trust me. Don't lock me out".</p>
		<p>After a long moment, Sam replied.</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine, thankyou".</p>
		<p>Alex pulled his hand away, and got up.</p>
		<p>"You don't get it, do you Sam?! Keep knocking people back and you'll get to a point where they're not going to bother with you anymore".</p>
		<p>He turned to leave, then stopped, asking one last question before he strode angrily from the library. "Why do you care so much about Brooke anyway?"</p>
		<p>Sam watched him go, and for the very first time, allowed herself to admit freely what she knew all along.</p>
		<p><i>Because I'm in love with her.</i></p>
