<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 21 -->

<p>"The girls still not up yet?" Mike asked as he walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Jane shook her head. "No, and it's almost one. It's not like them to sleep in this late".</p>
<p>"Must have been one hell of a party" he commented with a frown. "Do you know when they got in?"</p>
<p>"No idea" Jane answered, as she browsed through the refrigerator. She glanced at him over the door. "We should have a chat with the girls when they get up, hmmm?"</p>
<p>"Definitely" Mike said. "Though it is nice to see them getting along lately. I was quite surprised when Brooke told me she was going with Sam and her friends."</p>
<p>Jane smiled. "Who knows? We might actually get some peace and quiet in this house".</p>
<p>"Don't jinx it honey" Mike joked with a grin. "Any juice left?"  Moving over to the refrigerator he stopped as the door bell sounded. "I'll get that".</p>
<p>Opening the door, he smiled when he saw Alex standing there.</p>
<p>"Alex, good to see you" he greeted, ushering him in.</p>
<p>"How's it going Mike?" he asked, stepping inside. </p>
<p>"Not to bad Alex. Yourself?".</p>
<p>"Could be better" Alex said with a shrug. "Is Sam around?"</p>
<p>"Would you believe she's still asleep?" Mike answered, a little amused. "Was the party that good?"</p>
<p>"What party?" Alex asked, confused.</p>
<p>Mike stared at him for a moment. "You didn't go?"</p>
<p>Alex shook his head.</p>
<p>"Oh. Right, well, Sam went to some party. Michael's, I think it was". Mike explained, trying to remember the vague details Brooke had given him.</p>
<p>"With Brooke?" Alex asked sharply.</p>
<p>"Yes" Mike confirmed, a little surprised at his tone. "Along with Carmen, Lily and Harrison". He wondered briefly why Alex would ask about Brooke first, rather than Sam's regular friends. </p>
<p>"Oh" he replied, distracted. "I can come back later".</p>
<p>"Hold on Alex" Mike said stopping him. "It's about time Sam got up anyway.  Go on up".</p>
<p>"You sure?" </p>
<p>He nodded. </p>
<p>"Thanks Mike".</p>
<p>He watched thoughtfully as Alex walked up the stairs, replaying the conversation in his mind. He liked Alex and thought that he and Sam made a nice couple, but even he had picked up that something wasn't quite right between them.</p>
<p>In the beginning of their relationship, he would come home from work to find Sam out with Alex, or on the phone with Alex, or sitting with Alex watching some movie. He was over every other day, but gradually his visits tapered off to the point where this was the first time Mike had seen Alex in days.</p>
<p>Recalling the disappointed, almost angry expression when he mentioned Brooke's name, Mike knew that somehow his daughter was in the thick of it. He looked towards the stairs and wondered whether it was such a good idea to send Alex up.</p>
<p>He shrugged, heading towards the kitchen. What harm would it do?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Alex knocked softly on the door. No answer. </p>
<p>Knocking one more time, he slowly opened the door and closed it behind him. Taking a moment to adjust to the darkness, he walked over to the window and drew open the curtains. Turning around, he froze, staring blankly at the scene before him.</p>
<p>Sam asleep.</p>
<p>In Brooke's arms.</p>
<p>Alex took a couple of steps closer and continued to watch them silently for several minutes. Shock soon gave way to anger and jealousy as he took in their position; Brooke lying on her back, her arms wrapped tightly around Sam, whose head was resting comfortably on her shoulder.</p>
<p>He didn't move as Brooke groggily opened her eyes and focused on his own.</p>
<p>"Alex?" she asked in surprise, her voice thick with sleep. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>He glared at her for several moments before he answered.</p>
<p>"Visiting MY girlfriend. What are you doing?" He asked pointedly, gesturing at them. She blushed as she tried to sit up without disturbing Sam. </p>
<p>"We had an impromptu sleep over" she explained calmly, clearly aware that Alex was not happy. "I'm afraid of storms and Sam kept me company".</p>
<p>"By sleeping on top of you?" he asked sarcastically, making no effort to lower his voice.</p>
<p>"Would you keep your voice down?" Brooke snapped. "We can talk outside".</p>
<p>"I want to know what you are doing here" he answered, angrily. </p>
<p>"I just told you" Brooke replied, glaring at him. "What the hell is your problem?"</p>
<p>"You are my problem" he snarled, stepping closer. The sight of Sam and Brooke entwined so intimately made him want to lash out, especially at the blonde in front of him. </p>
<p>He had done everything possible to make Sam feel more comfortable around him, giving her as much time and space she needed to settle into the relationship and no matter what he did, she still pushed him away.</p>
<p>Glaring at the blonde, he couldn't help but feel resentful of the fact that her volatile relationship with Sam didn't interfere with the unmistakable closeness between them, their bond still obvious even when they fought and argued and bickered.</p>
<p>He wanted what Sam and Brooke had. He wanted to wake up with HIS arms around Sam. </p>
<p>He shook his head in amazement. Only days ago Sam and Brooke were barely on speaking terms and now they were sleeping together. Alex had no idea what the world was coming to.</p>
<p>"Then I suggest you leave" Brooke replied, standing up. "You can come back later without the attitude".</p>
<p>"I'm here to see Sam" Alex said as he crossed his arms. "Not you".</p>
<p>"She's sleeping. Get the hell out!" Brooke snapped, losing what little control she had. </p>
<p>"What's going on?" Sam mumbled sleepily as she sat up, glancing between them. "Alex?"</p>
<p>"I came to see you so we could talk about last night" Alex explained. He turned his attention to Brooke. "I didn't expect to find you in bed with her".</p>
<p>"Oh for fucks sake, get your mind out of your pants!" Brooke cried out, barely resisting the urge to punch him. "Nothing happened, you freak!"</p>
<p>"Brooke!" Sam chided, all traces of sleep disappearing.</p>
<p>"He's an idiot Sam!" she responded angrily, turning to Alex. "What do you think happened last night Alex? You think we fucked?!"</p>
<p>"You'd like that wouldn't you" he sneered, stepping closer. </p>
<p>"Alex! Enough!" Sam cried out, watching in shock as Brooke punched Alex square in the face. He reeled back in surprise, bracing himself against the door. </p>
<p>Xena would have been proud, Sam thought unnecessarily, as she jumped out of bed. </p>
<p>Rushing over to Alex, she gently pulled his hands away to find blood gushing out of his nose. She cringed, looking over at Brooke who was trying not to smirk. She glared at her as she lead him into the bathroom. Minutes later, she walked back out to find Brooke sitting on her bed.</p>
<p>"The bleeding has stopped" Sam informed her coldly. "You shouldn't have done that".</p>
<p>Brooke nodded sheepishly as she stood up. "I know, I'm sorry".</p>
<p>She sighed as she gently grasped Brooke's right hand. "Does it hurt?"</p>
<p>"A little" Brooke admitted. </p>
<p>Sam simply raised her right eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Okay, a lot" she amended with a small smile, glad that Sam wasn't too angry at her. </p>
<p>"What am I going to do with the both of you" Sam muttered to herself, gently running her fingers over Brooke's knuckles. She looked at her. "This is going to hurt like hell".</p>
<p>"The bitch deserves it" Alex sneered as he walked back into the room, his face twisting in anger as he found them huddled closely together. </p>
<p>"Bite me" Brooke replied, glaring at him. She flexed her other hand, wanting to punch him again.</p>
<p>"Enough!" Sam yelled. "I'm so sick of this".  </p>
<p>Striding over to Alex, Sam grasped him by the arm and steered him towards the door.  </p>
<p>"I'll talk to you later, when you've calmed down." </p>
<p>He looked at her sadly. "I just want to fix things between us Sam" .</p>
<p>"I know" she said softly. "But not right now, you're too upset. I'll meet up with you later tonight".</p>
<p>"You promise?"</p>
<p>"I promise".</p>
<p>He nodded, glaring once more at Brooke before he left.</p>
<p>"And you".</p>
<p>Sam turned around and walked over to Brooke, who shrugged. </p>
<p>"When you see him tonight, tell him to lose the paranoia. It's not a good look".</p>
<p>"You didn't have to hit him!" Sam cried out, frustrated. </p>
<p>"He was the one who came in here and lay into me, so don't start!" Brooke snapped, glaring back. </p>
<p>Sam held her gaze momentarily before she calmly replied. "Just go, please".</p>
<p>Brooke brushed past, slamming the door on the way out.</p>
