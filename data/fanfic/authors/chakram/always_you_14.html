<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 14 -->

<p>Sam picked up the phone then put it back down. She had been doing this for the best part of fifteen minutes and still hadn't found the nerve to call Alex.</p>
		<p>She sighed.</p>
		<p>The events of last night was all she could think about. If there was ever any doubt about how Sam felt about Brooke, last night had easily destroyed them all.</p>
		<p>She was one hundred per cent, head over heels in love.</p>
		<p>With her stepsister.</p>
		<p>That reason alone was enough to give Sam a migraine, but having a boyfriend on the side wasn't helping matters either. Brooke had managed, by standing mere inches away, what Alex couldn't in the two months she had been with him.</p>
		<p>Make her heart race.</p>
		<p>Sam sat up and reached for the phone. She needed to talk to him.</p>
		<p>Wanting a distraction, she had invited Lily and Carmen over for lunch earlier that afternoon and on the spur of the moment, had subtly bought up her problems.</p>
		<p>Sam shook her head and smiled. Okay, so it wasn't exactly subtle. And the conversation hadn't helped a bit. She was still as confused as ever.</p>
		<p>Sam put down the phone.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Sam, Lily and Carmen were scattered around the lounge room, absently flicking through channels.</p>
		<p>"You know, it might have been wise to rent a movie. Saturday afternoon television isn't exactly riveting," Carmen dryly commented.</p>
		<p>"I still think Moulin Rouge was more depressing than Titanic!" Lily stated, continuing the discussion.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, at least, when Rose died, she met up with Jack in heaven or whatever", Carmen agreed.</p>
		<p>"I can think of a more depressing movie than that", Sam said. She had wanted to breach the topic of Alex and Brooke for a while now but hadn't found a way to do it without arousing suspicion.</p>
		<p>Now was the perfect opportunity. She took a deep breath and told the story of a movie she had never seen.</p>
		<p><i>Make it convincing, Sam. </i></p>
		<p>"It was some foreign movie that I came across one night when I couldn't sleep. There was this girl, and she was going out with this guy. But she was in love with this other guy".</p>
		<p>"Did they get together in the end?" Carmen asked.</p>
		<p>"No. She never told him how she felt", Sam answered.</p>
		<p>"Well, did the other guy feel the same way?" Lily wanted to know.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"How do you know that?" Carmen asked.</p>
		<p>Sam took a moment to respond.</p>
		<p>"You just knew. Well, they were becoming good friends...", Sam replied.</p>
		<p>"I still think Moulin Rouge is more depressing", Lily interrupted.</p>
		<p>Sam shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Think about it! At least they got to spend some time together. Even Jack and Rose had three or four days together. But this girl would never know what it would be like to be with her soulmate!" Sam argued.</p>
		<p>"Well, when you put it that way..." Carmen said, her expression thoughtful.</p>
		<p>"So this girl thought her guy friend was her soulmate?" Lily asked.</p>
		<p>Sam paused. <i>Is that how I view Brooke? As my soulmate? </i></p>
		<p>After a long moment, she finally answered.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I guess she did. She just knew that she had always loved him, even when she didn't realise it, and there was no one else who made her feel the way that he did."</p>
		<p>Sam paused.</p>
		<p>"It's always been her".</p>
		<p>"Him", Lily corrected.</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"It's always been him. You said her". Carmen said.</p>
		<p>Sam blushed. "Right. Him."</p>
		<p>"I think she should have taken the risk and let him know how she felt", Lily said.</p>
		<p>"There were obstacles in the way", Sam answered.</p>
		<p>"Like what?"</p>
		<p>"Well, um, he had a girlfriend. Yeah. He had a girlfriend." Sam quickly replied, making it up as she went along.</p>
		<p>"So? Take the risk I say!" Lily said with conviction.</p>
		<p>"Oh come on! What if he didn't feel the same way about her? She could ruin a perfectly good friendship!" Carmen shot back.</p>
		<p>"Rewards can outweigh the risk! She should have told him! He could have been the love of her life!"</p>
		<p>Sam watched on as Carmen and Lily became more heated in their debate.</p>
		<p>"He had a girlfriend! You can't expect her to just walk in and try to steal someone who's already taken!"</p>
		<p>"What about the poor guy she's with! It's not fair she stays with him, when she's in love with someone else!" Lily argued.</p>
		<p>Sam cringed.</p>
		<p>"The fact is, this guy is with someone else! And sometimes, the one you love doesn't love you back. So, you love the one you're with!" Carmen reasoned.</p>
		<p>"Love the one you're with, huh?", Sam asked, quietly.</p>
		<p>"Unless she has a fairly good idea that the guy loves her back, then I think that she should forget about him and move on with her life". Carmen said.</p>
		<p>"Easier said than done, Carmen", Sam replied.</p>
		<p>"You better love the one you're with!" Carmen began singing.</p>
		<p>"That is so unromantic!" Lily cried out.</p>
		<p>"It's reality! Life isn't like the movies where everthing turns out alright in the end!" Carnen responded. "I don't like it, but that's just the way it is!"</p>
		<p>"Love the one you're with, huh?" Sam repeated again, her heart breaking.</p>
		<p>Lily glanced at Sam. "Alright, you win".</p>
		<p>She paused.</p>
		<p>"That movie is more depressing."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>A knock interrupted Sam's thoughts. Sitting up, she grinned as the cause of her problems walked through the door and sat down beside her.</p>
		<p>"Hi". Brooke said, returning the smile.</p>
		<p>"Hi." Sam responded.</p>
		<p>They stared at each for a moment.</p>
		<p>"Hi".</p>
		<p>Sam laughed. "You said that already."</p>
		<p>"What are you up to?" Brooke asked, trying to cover her embarrassment.</p>
		<p>"Just thinking. I was going to give Alex a call actually".</p>
		<p>Brooke stood up, trying to hide her disappointment. "Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt."</p>
		<p>"No! I mean, no, you're not. I wasn't really up to it, to tell you the truth."</p>
		<p>Brooke sat down. "Problems?"</p>
		<p>"We had a little disagreement."</p>
		<p>"Oh".</p>
		<p>"What about you? Any plans for tonight?" Sam asked quickly, wanting to change the subject.</p>
		<p>"Michael's birthday party". Brooke answered.</p>
		<p>Sam nodded, remembering. "That's right. Everybody was talking about it."</p>
		<p>"You going?"</p>
		<p>"Wasn't invited."</p>
		<p>"Oh". Brooke paused. "You can come with me if you like"</p>
		<p>"Are you serious?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, why not? You're allowed to bring a date", Brooke replied without thinking.</p>
		<p>Sam shot her a surprised, but pleased look, smiling as Brooke began to blush.</p>
		<p>"You know what I mean! And while we're at it, invite the others."</p>
		<p>"Lily, Carmen and Harrison? Are you sure that would be allowed? We might curse the place with our presence", Sam said sarcastically.</p>
		<p>Brooke shot her a grin and shrugged.</p>
		<p>"Being the most popular girl in school does have it's advantages. Believe me, nobody will say a word. Besides, Michael has a crush on me. He won't mind."</p>
		<p>Sam laughed. "You are such a tease".</p>
		<p>"Am not! I am using my feminine charms for good, not evil." She stood up. "I better get ready."</p>
		<p>Sam looked at the clock. "When does the party start?"</p>
		<p>"Eight, I think."</p>
		<p>"Brooke, it's six." Sam pointed out.</p>
		<p>"You're point?"</p>
		<p>With a grin, she walked out.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Time?" Sam asked.</p>
		<p>Sam, Lily, Carmen and Harrison were gathered around the kitchen table.</p>
		<p>"Quarter past eight", Harrison replied.</p>
		<p>Sam shook her head in disbelief. How it could possibly take Brooke more than two hours to get ready for a party was beyond her. It had taken her twenty minutes!</p>
		<p>"Sorry, I'm late everyone".</p>
		<p>Sam turned and stopped in her tracks.</p>
		<p><i>Oh my god. </i></p>
		<p>She had fully intended to greet Brooke's long awaited arrival with a sarcastic comment, but was left speechless instead.</p>
		<p>And drooling.</p>
		<p>Brooke shuffled nervously as four sets of eyes stared at her. One in amazement and envy, one in part disgust and fascination, the other two with lust.</p>
		<p>"Red leather pants. Interesting choice", Lily finally commented.</p>
		<p>"Sorry Lily", Brooke answered, sheepishly.</p>
		<p>"YoulookreallygoodBrookereallysexywownicewow", Harrison mumbled, eyes wide.</p>
		<p>"Thanks. I think", Brooke replied, having no idea what Harrison said.</p>
		<p>"You look great Brooke! I mean, really!" Carmen gushed.</p>
		<p>"Love your top Carmen", she replied, causing the brunette to nearly faint with happiness.</p>
		<p>Turning her attention to Sam, Brooke noticed that she was still staring at her leather clad legs. She grinned, inwardly doing the happy dance.</p>
		<p>"Sam? Sam? SAM?!"</p>
		<p>"Huh?! What?!" Sam reluctantly tore her eyes away.</p>
		<p>"We should get going", Brooke said, amused.</p>
		<p>Sam shot her a look. "Right. After you."</p>
		<p>As soon as the blonde cheerleader turned away, heading for the door, Sam lowered her gaze and focused her attention completely on Brooke's ass, a part of her ashamed for acting like a horny old man.</p>
		<p>She couldn't help it. Brooke looked hot!</p>
		<p>She was more than hot. She was fucking hot!</p>
		<p>Brooke meanwhile, silently congratulated herself. It seemed that Sam had a fondness for leather.</p>
		<p><i>Note to self: Need more leather in my closet...</i></p>
