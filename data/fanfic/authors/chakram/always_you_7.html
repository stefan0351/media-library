<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 7 -->

<p><i>I'm so not hungry.</i></p>
		<p>Sam shoved the mush the school called food around her plate with her fork, nodding occasionally and providing the odd "yeah" or "I agree," as Lily spoke animatedly about something or other.</p>
		<p>Lily stopped mid sentence as she realised Sam wasn't paying the least bit of attention to her. She continued.</p>
		<p>"Then the President knocked on my door and for the rest of the afternoon, we talked about global issues over several cups of tea and scones".</p>
		<p>Sam nodded. "Really? Fascinating".</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah! Then an elephant walked past our window, where we proceeded to ride it around the backyard".</p>
		<p>"Amazing."</p>
		<p>"It was!" Lily paused, then smiled when a thought occurred to her. "Hey, Brooke just walked in".</p>
		<p>"Where?!" Sam sat up and turned, scanning the cafeteria for the blonde cheerleader.</p>
		<p>Lily laughed.  "Now you pay attention". She shook her head and smirked. </p>
		<p>Sam paused when she realised she had been tricked. She put the fork down and smiled sheepishly. "Sorry". </p>
		<p>Lily shrugged. "You know, I'm getting the distinct feeling that something is on your mind. Is it Brooke?"</p>
		<p>"What makes you think it's Brooke?" Sam replied, immediately on the defensive. "Maybe I'm thinking about Alex?"</p>
		<p>Lily stared at her for several moments. "No. It's always about Brooke."</p>
		<p>Sam looked away and frowned. <i>I can't be that obvious. Am I? </i>She sighed.</p>
		<p>"We're having some problems. Again".</p>
		<p>"Sam, you and Brooke always have problems." Lily replied, confused. </p>
		<p>"You don't understand. We were beginning to get along and I honestly  thought we might actually become friends, but lately...", Sam trailed off as the blonde cheerleader and Nicole came into view, sitting at their regular table. </p>
		<p>"Have you tried talking to her?" Lily asked.</p>
		<p>Sam tore her eyes away from Brooke and focused her attention back on Lily. </p>
		<p>"No. We keep out of each other's way." She paused. "I miss her", she admitted quietly.</p>
		<p>Had Lily been standing, she was quite positive she would have fallen over in shock. </p>
		<p><i>Sam misses Brooke? Huh?!</i></p>
		<p>Lily paused. </p>
		<p><i>Oh I get it! It's a dream. I'm having a really weird dream.</i> <i>That must be it!</i></p>
		<p>Lily pinched herself.</p>
		<p>"Owwwww! Damn it!"</p>
		<p>Sam stared at her. "What are you doing?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing, nothing", she replied as she rubbed her arm.</p>
		<p><i>Okay, so it's not a dream. </i></p>
		<p>After several long moments, she opened her mouth to comment but was interrupted by the arrival of Alex. He sat down beside Sam and kissed her on the cheek. He smiled at Lily.</p>
		<p>"How's it going there, Lily?"</p>
		<p>"Not too bad Golden boy, how about you?"</p>
		<p>Alex laughed. "It's all good. I'm not interrupting anything am I?" </p>
		<p>Lily glanced at Sam and shrugged. "Just your normal girl stuff".</p>
		<p>He grinned then turned to Sam. "Can I talk to you about something?"</p>
		<p>Lily stood up. "Well, I guess that's my queue to leave". </p>
		<p>"No, you don't have to do that. It's nothing personal, just some stuff about the paper",  Alex replied.</p>
		<p>"No, it's okay. I'm busy anyway. There's an ant hill that needs saving". </p>
		<p>Everybody laughed.</p>
		<p>"Sam, call me if you want to talk, okay?" Sam nodded and with a wave Lily left.</p>
		<p>"Something wrong?" Alex asked, placing an arm around Sam's waist and pulling her closer. </p>
		<p>She leaned into him. "No. Just a little tired". She quickly changed the subject.  "What did you want to talk to me about?"</p>
		<p>Alex paused but let the matter drop for the moment. <i>She can tell me later.</i></p>
		<p>"I was thinking that we need to make some changes to the newspaper."</p>
		<p>Sam frowned. "Changes? What kind of changes?"</p>
		<p>"Haven't you noticed that hardly anybody reads it?"</p>
		<p>Sam shrugged. "So? What do you want us to do? Write articles about the latest dress Gwyneth wore to one of the six million award ceremonies they hold every year?"</p>
		<p>"Well, yeah". </p>
		<p>"WHAT?!"  Sam's outburst attracted the looks of those sitting around them. She lowered her voice. </p>
		<p>"Are you insane?"</p>
		<p>"Just hear me out, okay?" </p>
		<p>Sam nodded.</p>
		<p>"I'm just thinking that we should include stuff that people our age would be interested in. Fashion, music, sport, movies, stuff like that".</p>
		<p>Sam opened her mouth to comment but Alex jumped in and raised a hand.</p>
		<p>"That doesn't mean we stop what we have been doing. We just expand the paper a little, and hopefully get more people involved. Besides, it would be nice to see more than four people reading it." He stopped and waited for her reaction. </p>
		<p>He continued once he was sure that Sam wouldn't rip his head off. </p>
		<p>"You can't really expect many sixteen year olds to be that interested in the latest news regarding government legislation or genetic cloning. It's a little boring. We can make the paper both informative and entertaining". </p>
		<p>He paused and patiently waited for Sam to speak. She looked at him and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, okay. You're right. It would be nice to see more people appreciate the hard work we put in. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Have three people read it?"</p>
		<p>He grinned and hugged her. </p>
		<p>"Fantastic! It'll be great Sam, just wait and see."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, yeah". </p>
		<p>He kissed her.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Brooke glared in Sam's direction. </p>
		<p>"Would you look at that? It's disgusting! It should be illegal!".</p>
		<p>Nicole lifted her gaze from the magazine she had been reading.</p>
		<p>"I couldn't agree more. Releasing Sam on a poor and unsuspecting public? It's criminal, I tell you". Nicole went back to her magazine.</p>
		<p>Brooke shot her a look. "That's not what I meant." She went back to glaring.</p>
		<p>"You still haven't answered my question from before, Brooke." Nicole said.</p>
		<p>"What question was that?" Brooke asked, not taking her eyes of the happy couple.</p>
		<p>"Why I found you at home, several nights ago, watching Xena. Trying to get in touch with the dyke within?"</p>
		<p>Brooke smiled to herself. <i>You have no idea.</i></p>
		<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "It's not that bad a show".</p>
		<p>"I've seen an episode or two myself, actually." Nicole commented casually.</p>
		<p>"You have? When?" Brooke asked, surprise evident in her tone. </p>
		<p>"When that psycho bitch was on it. Callisto, I think her name was. Such an inspiration. I want to be like her when I grow up."</p>
		<p>Brooke stared. "Nic?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
		<p>"I fear for you sometimes".</p>
		<p>Nicole smiled, pushing aside her magazine. "You have a thing for Alex?"</p>
		<p>"What?! No! God, no! What makes you think that?" </p>
		<p>"If I didn't know you any better Brooke McQueen, I'd say you were jealous."</p>
		<p>Brooke looked away. <i>You got it half right, Nic. </i></p>
		<p>Before she could comment, Nicole stood up and called out across the room.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Spam! Why don't you and your toy boy get a room!"</p>
		<p>Brooke cringed. </p>
		<p><i>Oh oh.</i></p>
