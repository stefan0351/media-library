<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 23 -->

<p>"You make it sound like a bad thing" Brooke called out finally, as she stood up to follow Sam out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Sam asked, turning around to face her.</p>
<p>"I like the fact that we have become closer lately" Brooke answered "and I am not going to stop just because your boyfriend can't handle it". </p>
<p>Sam frowned. "I'm not asking you to stop. This isn't about you and me".</p>
<p>"The hell it isn't" Brooke replied fiercely. "Weren't you listening when he was ranting like a maniac? He was insinuating that we did something last night!"</p>
<p>"So you keep saying. I think you're reading too much into it Brooke" Sam said calmly, sitting against the arm rest of the couch.</p>
<p>"Tell me" Brooke asked, "would he have had that same reaction if it was Lily instead of me?"</p>
<p>"He likes Lily" Sam commented simply. "She actually gets his name right".</p>
<p>"He was acting like a jealous boyfriend who just found you in bed with another guy" Brooke argued, ignoring Sam's last point.</p>
<p>"You are not another guy" Sam answered, pointing out the obvious.</p>
<p>"Thankyou for establishing that" Brooke said, wryly. </p>
<p>"So what is YOUR point Brooke?" Sam asked, confused. "You punched him because...?"</p>
<p>Brooke just stood there, staring blankly at the brunette. Thinking about it, she had no idea why she kept on insisting that there was a deeper meaning to Alex and his behaviour. Sam's explanation was perfectly reasonable after all.</p>
<p>"So, in other words" Sam continued as Brooke made no effort to respond, "you punched him because you thought that he thought we did something. Is that it?" Sam asked, trying to keep the disappointment out of her voice. </p>
<p>"Huh?" Brooke asked intelligently, still trying to find the words to answer to Sam's previous question.</p>
<p>"I don't get it. I just don't get it" Sam rambled, more to herself. "This feud you two have, I can't figure it out". She stared at Brooke, puzzled. "And it goes deeper than 'Boo hoo, she calls me Adam' and 'Oooo, Adam is annoying" She continued, putting on a voice. </p>
<p>"Sometimes two people just don't get along" Brooke explained lamely.</p>
<p>"Don't give me that!" Sam cried out, standing up. "If you don't want to tell me, fine! Just don't lie to me! You don't like him, do you? Just say it!".</p>
<p>"No, I don't! Okay?!" Brooke blurted out, a part of her ashamed for acting so irrationally. "Is that what you want to hear?!". </p>
<p>"Why?" Sam asked quietly. </p>
<p><i>He has what I want and I hate him for it!</i></p>
<p>Brooke stared at her before she looked away, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I need to go" Sam said finally. "I promised Alex I would see him".</p>
<p>Brooke watched her walk out the door, before she headed up to her room.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Coming!" Brooke called out, as she bounded down the stairs. </p>
<p>After Sam had left she had played her stereo on full blast, wanting the noise to drown out all her thoughts, if only momentarily, and it was only by sheer luck that she heard the door bell when changing c.d's. Praying that it was Sam, she eagerly flung open the door.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" She asked confused, inwardly cringing at the large patch of purple that covered most of his nose and some of his left eye. </p>
<p>She really did whack him one.</p>
<p>"I'm here to sell you cookies" Alex answered sarcastically. "Where is Sam?"</p>
<p>"She left half an hour ago, to see you" Brooke replied, stepping aside to let him in.</p>
<p>"I haven't been home since I left here earlier, and I haven't got my phone on me" Alex said, annoyed. "Damn it". He turned to Brooke. "Can I use your phone?"</p>
<p>"Whatever" Brooke said, shutting the door and brushing past him. </p>
<p>She sat on the couch, unashamedly listening in to the one sided conversation, casually noticing how soft and gentle his voice was when speaking to Sam, a definite contrast to the harsh, angry tones he used to address her. </p>
<p>Hanging up the phone, Alex turned to Brooke, regarding her silently for a few moments. She returned the look, raising an eyebrow in surprise when he sat down across from her.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you be leaving?" she asked in confusion, wondering where Sam had suggested they should meet to talk.</p>
<p>"In a minute" he replied, sitting back. He glanced at her bruised hand. "Nice".</p>
<p>"Matches your face" she commented wryly, causing him to smile. Brooke surprised herself by apologizing. "I shouldn't have punched you Alex. I'm sorry".</p>
<p>"Are you?" he asked. "Or are you more sorry that it upset Sam more than it hurt me?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer, conceding his point with a nod.</p>
<p>"You know, despite her so called unpopularity, Sam has her fair share of admirers" Alex continued casually. "Even if they won't admit it. She turns heads, wherever we go".</p>
<p>"Of course she would" Brooke replied proudly. "She's beautiful".</p>
<p>"Yes, she is. Beautiful. Intelligent. Compassionate" Alex answered, with a smile. "I'm very lucky to have her".</p>
<p>Brooke didn't respond, wondering where he was heading with this conversation.</p>
<p>"The guys at school talk about how hot she is all the time, and it amazes me that the simple fact of Sam not being accepted by your peers, stops a horde of people from asking her out" Alex said, shaking his head at their stupidity. "The moment she is accepted by people like you, I'm in trouble. They'd be banging down the door to take my place, and in that way, I have many rivals. Even if they are all silent".</p>
<p>"What's your point, Alex?"</p>
<p>Alex continued as if Brooke hadn't spoken. "It never used to bother me. I never felt threatened because I knew that Sam would choose me over any of them".</p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. "Is there a point to this bragging session?"</p>
<p>Alex leant forward, his gaze piercing. "For the very first time, I have a genuine rival. One who is actually a threat to me". He paused, watching as Brooke shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her demeanor confirming all of his suspicions. "You, Brooke. And I'm not wrong when I say you are in love with her, am I?"</p>
<p>Brooke didn't reply.</p>
<p>"I thought so" he replied casually, though he felt like his insides were being ripped out.<i> </i>He tried to ignore the feeling of inevitability surging through him. </p>
<p>"I want you to stay away from her, do you understand?" he ordered, standing up and stepping forward as Brooke rose to greet him.</p>
<p>"That's going to be a little hard, considering I live with her", Brooke replied sarcastically, a little unnerved by the face that bared such a resemblace to her own. "Whatever she feels or doesn't feel for me, there is no way I'm giving her up. Especially for you".</p>
<p>Alex glared at her. "Sam is with me, and I'll do what it takes to keep it that way. Don't interfere, Brooke. I mean it".</p>
<p>He turned away without another word, slamming the door on the way out.</p>
<p>"Could this day get any worse?" Brooke asked to no one in particular.</p>
