<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 15 -->

<p>Sam rolled her eyes as yet another guy came up and asked Brooke to dance. How many was that now? She wracked her brain, trying to remember.</p>
<p>She had lost count after thirteen.</p>
<p>"You should go and dance Brooke. You don't need to babysit me", Sam said, more harshly than she intended.</p>
<p>They had arrived at the hall Michael had rented out, to find the music blaring and what Sam thought was the entire school in attendance. They were everywhere! People making out on the grass outside, people smoking something or other on the roof, people drinking on the street.</p>
<p>She stole another glance at Brooke, again admiring her appearance. To say those red leather pants had caused quite the uproar was an understatement and Sam knew that come Monday, leather clad Brooke McQueen clones would be invading the school.</p>
<p>Before the blonde could respond, Michael appeared in front of them. He smiled at Brooke, offering her a drink. "Glad to see you could make it."</p>
<p>He turned to Sam, his smile disappearing.</p>
<p>"I don't remember inviting you or your...friends". He gestured to Lily, Carmen and Harrison who were dancing with Josh.</p>
<p>"That's because I did", Brooke replied, with a pointed look. "I hope you don't mind".</p>
<p><i>Stupid prick. </i></p>
<p>Michael just stared in awe at the goddess before him.</p>
<p>"No, no, that's fine Brooke, whatever you want, it's all good."</p>
<p>Brooke grinned. "I'm glad".</p>
<p>She took the drinks from his hands and offered one to Sam. "Happy Birthday, by the way".</p>
<p>"Thanks." He stopped, gathering his courage. "Would you mind dancing with me later? Since it's my birthday and everything?" he asked, putting on what he thought was his best grin. The girls loved it.</p>
<p><i>Argh. Kill me.</i></p>
<p>"Sure. Later, okay?" Brooke turned to Sam, grabbing her by the hand and pulling her away. "Let's go".</p>
<p>They walked outside to a more secluded area. Sitting down against the wall overlooking the garden, Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Maybe coming here wasn't such a good idea", she said.</p>
<p>Sam patted her on the thigh. "Or maybe you should have worn something else. The guys really can't get enough of you tonight."</p>
<p>"They're idiots. They wouldn't know what beauty was if it kicked them in the ass", Brooke replied, taking a swig of her drink.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Sam asked confused.</p>
<p>"If they had any sense at all, they'd be drooling over you, not me".</p>
<p>Sam blushed, as Brooke continued.</p>
<p>"I know that I'm attractive, but it's the image I have that they're more attracted too", Brooke finished, taking another sip.</p>
<p>"You may have a point Brooke but still those pants are pretty hot" Sam paused. "Hell, if I wasn't your stepsister, I'd jump you".</p>
<p>They stared at each other for a moment then laughed.</p>
<p>"Want to guess how many people will be wearing leather on Monday?" Brooke asked, with a smirk.</p>
<p>Sam laughed harder. "I was thinking that before, actually!"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled, then changed the subject. "Did you notice that Lily and Josh were dancing just a little too close?"</p>
<p>Sam thought for a moment. "Now that I think about it." She glanced at Brooke. "Does that bother you?"</p>
<p>The cheerleader shook her head. "No. Like I said, I don't love him like that. I'm just surprised he didn't tell me."</p>
<p>"Maybe they don't realise how they feel yet", Sam said, shrugging.</p>
<p>"You just might have a point." Brooke turned to Sam with a sly look on her face. "How about we make a bet?".</p>
<p>"A bet? What kind of bet?" Sam asked, intrigued.</p>
<p>"Well, if they're not already a couple, I'll give it a week".</p>
<p>"A week! No, I'd give it more than two", Sam countered.</p>
<p>"Okay. Then if I win...", Brooke paused for a moment, thinking. "If I win, you'll have to be my slave for a week!"</p>
<p>Sam shot her a look. "How very original. And if I win?"</p>
<p>"I'll draw you a certificate", she answered.</p>
<p>Sam stared at her while Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Actually, I wouldn't mind bossing you around for a week. I'll go with that." Sam replied.</p>
<p>"As if you don't boss me around already", Brooke shot back.</p>
<p>"Oh, you love it!" Sam smirked, holding out her hand. "So it's on?"</p>
<p>Brooke shook it firmly. "I'm looking forward to it McPherson! My car needs a good wash."</p>
<p>Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"Lily and Josh. Wow, I didn't see it coming", Brooke said, shaking her head in amazement.</p>
<p>"We could be completely wrong, you know," Sam pointed out.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so. You can tell a lot just by analysing body language. They had eyes only for each other and there was barely any space between them", Brooke replied, neither girl realising that the blonde cheerleader had just described their own situation perfectly.</p>
<p>"Nobody ever said love was logical", Sam said, finishing off the remainder of her drink. She stared at the empty bottle and frowned.</p>
<p>"Want me to get you another?" Brooke asked, noticing Sam's disappointment.</p>
<p>"No, it's okay." Sam grabbed Brooke's bottle and began drinking.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Brooke cried out, trying to snatch it back. Sam laughed as she held the bottle away from her.</p>
<p>"Hand it over McPherson!" Brooke threatened. "Or I'll...."</p>
<p>"You'll what?" Sam teased.</p>
<p>"I'll do this!" Brooke yelled, lunging at Sam, who was still trying to hold the bottle away.</p>
<p>"Brooke get off me!" Sam laughed, trying to stop herself from falling on her side.</p>
<p>"Not until you give it back!" Brooke replied, tickling the brunette.</p>
<p>"Never!" Sam shrieked as Brooke tickled a particularly sensitive spot. "Stop it! Brooke!"</p>
<p>She laughed harder as she dropped the bottle, trying to protect her ribs by slapping away at Brooke's hands.</p>
<p>"That's what you get for taking what doesn't belong to you" Brooke said, laughing as Sam's face turned even more red. She was suprised when the brunette suddenly sat up and flew at her, her momentum causing Brooke to fall backwards, with Sam lying half on top of her.</p>
<p>Brooke grinned, enjoying this turn of events.</p>
<p>"Ha!" Sam cried out triumphantly. "Who's the Queen now, bitch!"</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. She loved seeing the more playful side of Sam, a side she didn't show often enough.</p>
<p>Especially around her.</p>
<p>"Okay you win, you're Majesty", Brooke said with a smile.</p>
<p>"And don't you forget it!" Sam replied with a smirk, not making any effort to move.</p>
<p>They stared at each for a few moments.</p>
<p>"You should do this more often", Brooke said, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>"What? Leap on top of you?" Sam replied, smiling.</p>
<p><i>Great idea, Sam!</i></p>
<p>"No", she answered with a laugh. "Let your guard down".</p>
<p>"I'n trying" Sam replied seriously. "Though I must admit I'm finding it much easier to do that around you".</p>
<p>She reluctantly pushed herself off Brooke and sat beside her.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear that", Brooke said, shifting so she could place her head on the brunette's lap.</p>
<p>"Comfortable enough?" Sam inquired, with a small smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, thankyou", Brooke replied with a cheeky grin. "Besides, you owe me for stealing my drink. I'm dying from dehydration over here!"</p>
<p>Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"You poor baby" she said with mock sympathy. "Though, if you are truly suffering from dehydration, I recommend good old fashioned water, rather than Baccardi Breezers".</p>
<p>"Smart ass".</p>
<p>"Just doing my duty", Sam replied with a grin. She began running her fingers though Brooke's hair.</p>
<p>"That feels nice", Brooke purred, closing her eyes.</p>
<p>"You've got bits of grass stuck in your hair", Sam said. "Unless of course you want to keep them and start a new fashion trend. Leather and grass. You never know, it just might take off."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I sincerely doubt it".</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and gazed at Sam.</p>
<p>"Don't stop please."</p>
<p>"I won't", Sam replied softly.</p>
