<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 18 -->

<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Are you actually a dyke? Or just a Spam-o-sexual?" Nicole asked, laughing loudly at her own joke.</p>
<p>"Ha. Ha." Brooke replied, trying not to smile. </p>
<p>"Well?" Nicole inquired, still snickering.</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I've never been attracted to another woman before. Hell, I've never felt like this about anyone ever, male or female. I just love her". </p>
<p>Nicole rolled her eyes and pretended to gag. Brooke glared at her.  </p>
<p>"I must admit, you've got good taste. Personally, I find her as interesting as watching the stock market, but even I can't deny the girl's a fox." She leant forward. "And if I ever hear she found out I said that, I'll kill you". </p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "Ever thought about getting a girl of your own, Nic?"</p>
<p>"No!" She answered quickly.</p>
<p>"You've thought about it!", Brooke cried out gleefully. "Is it someone from school? Go on, you know you want to tell me!"</p>
<p>Nicole glared. "Someone from school? Don't make me giggle".</p>
<p>"Then who?"</p>
<p>Nicole debated internally for a few moments then sighed. "I think Melissa Etheridge is pretty hot".</p>
<p>Brooke just stared at her. </p>
<p>"You know, the singer!", Nicole continued, shifting uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Brooke continued to stare then exploded with laughter.</p>
<p>"It's not that funny", Nicole grumbled, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" Brooke managed to say, holding her aching sides. She took a deep breath, trying to compose herself. "I just wasn't expecting....that".</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, that's the last time I tell you anything", Nicole said, glaring. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry Nic", Brooke apologized, still giggling.</p>
<p>"And if you tell Spam that, I'll torture you first before I kill you!" She threatened, causing Brooke to laugh all over again. </p>
<p>"Bitch", Nicole muttered, trying not to smile. She couldn't help it, Brooke's laugh was infectious. </p>
<p>Brooke stood up and grinned. "Thanks for making me laugh".</p>
<p>"I wasn't trying too!" Nicole exclaimed, standing up. </p>
<p>"Etheridge isn't bad". Brooke paused. "For an old lady".</p>
<p>"Damn it!" Nicole yelled.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed, then stepped forward and hugged her.</p>
<p>"I needed cheering up and you helped me out. I wasn't expecting it from you but I'm glad that it was." She told her sincerely. "Thankyou".</p>
<p>Nicole stood there speechless for a moment. She really wasn't good with the sappy stuff.</p>
<p>"You leaving?" She asked finally.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm tired and I've had enough. You?"</p>
<p>Nicole shrugged. "I can go for a little while longer."</p>
<p>Brooke nodded, then shook a finger at her. "No more drinking, young lady. Okay?"</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am", Nicole replied with a mock salute. Brooke gave her one last hug and walked away. Just before she turned the corner to leave, she stopped suddenly and called out.</p>
<p>"Nic?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Brooke started singing. "Does she love you, like the way I love you...."</p>
<p>"BITCH!" Nicole yelled out, stomping her foot.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed and gave her a final wave. Nicole sighed, realising that she had just provided her with teasing material for the next fifty years. </p>
<p>She turned around and headed for the hall, a definite bounce in her step. She smiled, glad that she'd made the right decision to stand by her best friend. She looked around the crowded room.</p>
<p><i>Now where is that Jack?</i></p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam quietly entered the house, half disappointed to find Brooke not waiting up for her. Rubbing her eyes, she made her way upstairs to her bedroom and switched on the light, nearly jumping in shock as she found the blonde cheerleader asleep on her bed. </p>
<p>After taking a moment to recover, Sam grinned at the precious scene in front of her. Brooke was on her side wrapped around one of her pillows, dressed in the baggy Garfield pyjamas Sam had given her last Christmas. </p>
<p>She silently crossed the room and grabbed her camera, making sure the flash was off. After taking several pictures, she found a couple of spare blankets and covered the gently snoring blonde with them.</p>
<p>She debated sleeping in Brooke's bed but quickly dismissed the idea. She wasn't going to pass up this opportunity to spend the night with her, even if it meant they were both unconscious through out it.</p>
<p>She climbed in, facing Brooke. Leaning forward, she gently  kissed her on the forehead. </p>
<p>"I love you", she whispered, watching her for a few moments. Settling back, she closed her eyes, falling asleep instantly.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You ready to get going?" Carmen asked as she walked over to Harrison.</p>
<p>Harrison shrugged. "Sure". He looked around. "Where's Lily?" </p>
<p>She smirked. "Off with Josh somewhere."</p>
<p>Harrison raised an eyebrow, shooting her a surprised look. "Having a deep and meaningful conversation?" he joked.</p>
<p>Carmen laughed. "Something like that." </p>
<p>She hooked her arm through his as they began the trek home. </p>
<p>"Who would have predicted that?" Harrison said moments later, shaking his head in amazement. He stopped suddenly as a thought came to him. </p>
<p>"What happened to Sam and Brooke?"</p>
<p>Carmen shrugged. "I think they left a while ago." </p>
<p>"Oh".</p>
<p>They continued walking.</p>
<p>"Carmen?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Have you noticed something different about those two?"</p>
<p>Carmen glanced at him. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>He thought for several moments before responding. </p>
<p>"I think they like each other now."</p>
<p>Carmen shot him a weird look. "Wow. You deep thinker, you!"</p>
<p>He nudged her and laughed.  </p>
<p>"It's nice to see Sam and Brooke getting along at least", Carmen continued innocently.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Harrison asked, glancing at her.</p>
<p>Carmen smiled inwardly. She had suspected for quite some time that Harrison's feelings for Sam went deeper than he was willing to admit. It was time to test her hypothesis.</p>
<p>"I think Sam and Alex are having some problems", she confided mysteriously.</p>
<p>"Really?" he asked concerned, not quite succeeding in keeping the hope out of his voice. He turned to her suddenly, his expression dark. "He hasn't hurt her has he?"</p>
<p>Carmen shook her head. "No, nothing like that."  She glanced at him.  </p>
<p>"You don't like him much do you?"</p>
<p>"He's a nice guy", Harrison replied, a little too quickly. </p>
<p>Carmen just stared at him.</p>
<p>"What?" he finally asked, growing increasingly uncomfortable under the scrutiny.</p>
<p>She laughed. "You are soooo jealous".</p>
<p>"And you have no idea what you're talking about!" Harrison denied, glaring at her.</p>
<p>"No need to lie to me, Harrison", she responded calmly. "Until Alex came along, you were the only guy in her life, now sombody has taken your place and you can't stand it!" </p>
<p>"Who are you?" He finally asked. "A mind reader disguised as Carmen Ferreira?"</p>
<p>She laughed, then continued with her inquisition.</p>
<p>"Do you like her Harrison? I mean, really LIKE her?"</p>
<p>He didn't respond, looking away. </p>
<p>Carmen grinned. </p>
<p>This was going to be so much fun! As their best friend, it was her duty to make sure that Sam and Harrison realised the love they had for each other. She could do nothing less.</p>
<p><i>Operation: Matchmaker begins!</i></p>
<p>"Harrison?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"I had an interesting conversation with Sam today."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I think she's in love with you."</p>
<p>"WHAT?!"</p>
