<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 19 -->

<p>Sam turned over, slowly opening her eyes. </p>
<p>Sitting up, she focused her gaze on her bedroom window, jumping slightly as a streak of lightening flashed across the sky, accompanied by a loud clap of thunder.</p>
<p>She smiled. She loved thunderstorms. </p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>She turned, finding Brooke staring up at her with wide, frightened eyes.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Sam asked, noticing that Brooke was shivering.</p>
<p>"Not really", she answered, huddling deeper into the blankets. "I hate storms. They scare me".</p>
<p>"Is there anything that I can do?" Sam asked, concerned. She had considered teasing her a little but quickly set it aside as she realised that Brooke was truly afraid.</p>
<p>"Could you close the curtains?" she asked, closing her eyes as another flash of lightning lit up the room. </p>
<p>"Sure", she replied getting up. "Anything else?"</p>
<p>Brooke nodded. "My walkman. It's on my desk". </p>
<p>"Thanks", she said gratefully, as Sam returned moments later.</p>
<p>"No problem", she replied getting into bed. </p>
<p>Turning over, and making herself comfortable, she faced Brooke.</p>
<p>"The chances of you being hit by lightening is very small, you know", Sam commented, smiling reassuringly. "Especially, when you're inside".</p>
<p>"You try and say that to the guy who got struck seven times", Brooke replied, with a horrified look on her face.</p>
<p>Sam giggled. "Are you serious? Seven times? Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" Brooke exclaimed, glaring as Sam began to laugh. "It's not funny".</p>
<p>"I'm sorry", Sam apologized, trying to stop. She didn't mean to laugh at another person's misfortune, but being struck by lightening seven times was kind of funny. She wondered briefly what the man had done in his life to deserve such rotten luck.</p>
<p>"How long have you been awake?" she asked, sympathetically.</p>
<p>"About half an hour", Brooke replied.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you wake me?", Sam chided gently. She frowned. "What time is it anyway?" Lifting herself up, she glanced over at the clock. "Four thirty? Is that all?"</p>
<p>"I didn't want to disturb you", Brooke explained.</p>
<p>"Well, you should have. Besides, I love watching storms. They're beautiful", Sam said, dreamily.</p>
<p>"They are hazardous to the human race", Brooke replied gruffly.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "You are so cute when you get all indignant". </p>
<p>"Well, they are!" Brooke responded, yelping as a particularly loud thunder clap made itself known. </p>
<p>"I used to be afraid of them too" Sam confided, once Brooke calmed down.</p>
<p>"What happened?" she asked, curiously.</p>
<p>"There was this one night, years ago. The storm was so bad, I hid under the kitchen table and refused to come out". </p>
<p>"That's what I used to do", Brooke interrupted, laughing.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. "After an hour or so, my dad finally joined me and told me what was causing the storm. I was about seven at the time, so I believed him of course".</p>
<p>"What was it?" Brooke asked, intrigued. Sam rarely spoke of her father and she couldn't help but feel honored that Sam was sharing what was obviously a treasured memory. </p>
<p>"When I was younger I had this weird fascination with elephants. I think it's because I loved Babar. You know, the cartoon? Anyway, he told me that when elephants died, they would have a party when they reached elephant heaven. The lightening was the disco ball, and the thunder was all the elephants dancing", Sam explained, smiling sheepishly.</p>
<p>Brooke stared at her for several moments before she burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"So everytime after that, whenever there was a storm, he'd say "The elephants are dancing, Sammy!" I remember sharing that story at school for show n' tell so the other kids wouldn't be afraid either. I didn't understand at the time why the teacher couldn't stop laughing", Sam said with a grin.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. She could just imagine a seven year old Sam standing in front of the class, a serious expression on her face as she informed them that storms were caused by partying elephants. </p>
<p>"Once I got older and realised that the story my dad told me was not exactly meteorologically correct, we used to watch them through the window. I'd sit on his lap and we'd give each lightening strike a score", Sam said, tearing up at the memory. She missed her father so much. </p>
<p>"Sounds nice", Brooke commented, wistfully.</p>
<p>"It was" Sam replied, with a smile. She stood up suddenly. "Come on, let's go."</p>
<p>"Where?" Brooke asked, confused.</p>
<p>"To watch the storm", Sam informed her.</p>
<p>"No way in hell", Brooke replied immediately, clutching at the blankets.</p>
<p>"Please?" Sam begged softly. "I promise nothing will happen".</p>
<p>Brooke didn't reply, watching as Sam moved her bean bag and placed it several feet in front of the window. Grabbing a blanket, she waited patiently for Brooke to join her. </p>
<p>"Come on Brooke" Sam encouraged with a smile.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. All Sam had to do was look at her like that, and she'd do anything, even if it meant running the risk of electrocution. She stood up, casting wary glances at the now visible sky. Sam sat down on the bean bag and beckoned Brooke to join her, holding her arms out. </p>
<p>"I'll hold you", Sam commented softly, Brooke suddenly fighting the urge to run to her.</p>
<p>"Okay", was her only reply. </p>
<p>Leaning back against Sam's chest, Brooke smiled inwardly as Sam covered them both with a blanket then encircled the blonde with her arms.</p>
<p>"See, it's not so bad is it?" Sam said softly into her ear.</p>
<p>"Fucking hell!" was Brooke's response, burying her face into Sam's neck as multiple lightening streaks zig zagged across the sky.</p>
<p>"I'd give that a five out of five", Sam replied with a laugh. Brooke tried not to smile as she willed her heart to stop racing. Once she was sure it was safe, she turned her gaze back to the window.</p>
<p>"If I die, I swear I'm going to kick your ass" Brooke threatened, snuggling deeper into the brunette. Sam laughed, tightening her hold.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'll protect you", she replied, resting her cheek against the blonde head.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke asked several moments later.</p>
<p>"Mmmm?"</p>
<p>"We suck".</p>
<p>"Why?" Sam asked, confused.</p>
<p>"Remember our bet we made earlier tonight?"</p>
<p>Sam nodded. "Josh and Lily. What about it?"</p>
<p>"I saw them making out".</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "You're right, we do suck."</p>
<p>"At least I said one week, you said two. I win!" Brooke replied happily.</p>
<p>"No way!" Sam argued. "You said it would take them a week to get together. It took them a couple of hours! We both lose the bet".</p>
<p>"I was closer to the answer than you were, now be my slave, bitch", she joked, not giving up.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "Face it Brooke, you'll just have to find someone else to wash your car. Or better yet, do it yourself".</p>
<p>"I don't think so", Brooke responded, shocked that Sam could say such a thing. "Car washes do exist for a reason". </p>
<p>Sam shook her head, smiling. "Someone is a lazy ass".</p>
<p>"Especially at five in the morning", Brooke said, jumping slightly at another lightening strike. She watched as the rain began to pour harder.</p>
<p>"I'd rate that a five", she commented.</p>
<p>"A five!" Sam exclaimed. "That wasn't even worthy of a two!"</p>
<p>"Was so", Brooke argued.</p>
<p>"Someone just has to say the word lightening and you'd give it a five". Brooke responded with a smile. Brooke was so cute sometimes.</p>
<p>"Are you mocking me?" she asked, a touch of warning in her voice.</p>
<p>"Yes", was Sam's reply.</p>
<p>Brooke growled. </p>
<p>Sam kissed her on the cheek. "You're cute when you get all indignant."</p>
<p>The blonde cheerleader smiled. "Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Sam grinned. "Ooo, that rocked! A definite four!" She glanced at Brooke. "And you barely even jumped".</p>
<p>"You said you'd protect me, remember?" was Brooke's answer, making the brunette smile. </p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Mmmm?"</p>
<p>"Why did you leave the party?" Brooke asked, feeling Sam stiffen behind her.</p>
