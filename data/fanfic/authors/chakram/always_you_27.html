<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 27 -->

<p>Sam stood there, frozen, as Brooke practically flew out of the room.</p>
<p>"Shit" she finally muttered, turning towards Jessie.</p>
<p>Jessie shot her an embarrassed look. "I shouldn't have done that."</p>
<p>"I wasn't exactly pushing you away, was I?" Sam replied, placing a hand on Jessie's arm. "Don't feel bad about this, okay?" She looked towards the door. "I better go after her."</p>
<p>Jessie nodded as Sam walked out. Leaning against the table, she covered her face and groaned. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke sat there, staring blankly ahead, her hands gripping the steering wheel. She couldn't feel anything and she was barely aware of Sam sliding into the passenger seat beside her.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" Sam asked softly, as she too, stared directly ahead.</p>
<p>"I thought I'd pick you up after the meeting and take you out to dinner somewhere" Brooke replied finally, her voice calm and even.</p>
<p>"Do you still want to?" Sam asked, turning towards her.</p>
<p>Brooke shook her head as she started up the car. </p>
<p>"I'm not hungry".</p>
<p>They drove home in silence.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p><i>I wake up in the morning</i></p>
<p><i>Put on my face</i></p>
<p><i>The one that's gonna get me </i></p>
<p><i>Through another day</i></p>
<p><i>Doesn't really matter</i></p>
<p><i>How I feel inside</i></p>
<p><i>This life is like a game sometimes</i></p>
<p>Sam smiled as she cranked up the volume on her walkman. She loved this song.</p>
<p><i>Then you came around me</i></p>
<p><i>The walls just disappeared</i></p>
<p><i>Nothing to surround me</i></p>
<p><i>Keep me from my fears</i></p>
<p><i>I'm unprotected</i></p>
<p><i>See how I've opened up</i></p>
<p><i>You've made me trust</i></p>
<p>Absently moving her unidentified lunch around with a plastic fork, Sam blinked away tears as she wondered how it was possible to miss someone so much.</p>
<p>Especially someone who lived in the same house she did.</p>
<p><i>I've never felt like this before</i></p>
<p><i>I'm naked around you</i></p>
<p><i>Does it show?</i></p>
<p><i>You see right through me</i></p>
<p><i>And I can't hide</i></p>
<p><i>I'm naked around you</i></p>
<p><i>And it feels so right</i></p>
<p>Brooke didn't ask about what she had seen and Sam didn't explain. </p>
<p>The last couple of days had seen them purposely avoid each other and Sam wished that she could say something, anything, that would have them talking again, instead of the forced, polite facade they had between them now. </p>
<p>She turned around as she felt a tap on her shoulder. </p>
<p>"What are you listening to?" Harrison asked with a grin, as he sat down.</p>
<p>"Avril" Sam replied, as she put her walkman away.</p>
<p>"She's hot" he replied with a leer, making Sam smile for the first time in days. She contemplated voicing her agreement but decided to stay silent. After all, she didn't want to give Harrison a heart attack.</p>
<p>"You really should check them out" Harrison said with a grin "They're quite good".</p>
<p>"What?" Sam had no idea what Harrison was going on about.</p>
<p>He shot her a look. "Haven't you wondered why the cafeteria is practically empty?"</p>
<p>Sam looked around for the first time, surprised. She had been so lost in thought, she hadn't realised there were only a handful of students scattered through out.</p>
<p>"The cheerleaders" Harrison explained, as he unwrapped his sandwich "are trying out some new moves. Brooke is amazing".</p>
<p>Sam nodded silently.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Harrison asked concerned, pushing his lunch aside. "You've been real quiet lately". He stopped as Sam looked away. "Sam? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Sam stared at him intently for a moment.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been in love Harrison?" She asked finally, surprising him. "I mean, truly in love? So bad, that it consumes you, and all you do is think about that person, all the time. You think about what they're doing, and what they're thinking, and if they're thinking of you, and you'd do anything to have them feel the same way." </p>
<p>She stopped, her gaze flickering towards the empty table where Brooke normally sat.</p>
<p>"Ever felt that Harrison?" She asked softly, looking at him sadly.</p>
<p>"We're not talking about Alex, are we?" Harrison asked, as he leant forward. "You broke up with him, because of this...person you're talking about."</p>
<p>Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Have you told them how you feel?"</p>
<p>Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"You should!" Harrison encouraged strongly, leaning forward. </p>
<p>He had harbored secret doubts about what Carmen and Lily had told him, which is why he hadn't done anything about it, despite their impatient pleas for him to get off his ass. Hearing the words from Sam herself changed everything and Harrison couldn't wait to tell her that he felt the same way. Now wasn't the right time though. </p>
<p>He wanted everything to be perfect.</p>
<p>"With things like this, it's worth the risk Sam" He continued, as he stood up and sat beside her. "What if they feel the same way about you?"</p>
<p>"And what if they didn't?" Sam countered.</p>
<p>"At least you would know" Harrison replied. "Love is the one thing worth risking everything for, right?"</p>
<p>"SAM!" </p>
<p>Turning around, Sam watched in confusion as Carmen and Lily ran frantically towards her.</p>
<p>"It's Brooke" Carmen gasped out, trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>"What about her?" Sam asked immediately, standing up. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"She's hurt herself, it's..." Carmen stopped as Sam left before she could finish explaining. </p>
<p>"I never knew she could run so fast" Lily commented wryly before all three followed in pursuit.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Get the hell out of my way!" Sam yelled, as she tried to push through the large crowd. It would have been nice if everybody had automatically parted like the Red Sea, but Sam knew that would have been too much too ask for. </p>
<p>Finally reaching the front, Sam found Nicole gingerly holding Brooke, whose face was a ghostly white, her cheeks streaked with still flowing tears, her jaw tightly clenched as she tried to stop herself from screaming in pain. </p>
<p>Glancing at Brooke's left shoulder, Sam winced. It was dislocated.</p>
<p>Rushing forward, she knelt behind Brooke and tried to support her, relieved to feel the blonde leaning back into her touch. Placing a kiss on her cheek, Sam gently began stroking the blonde hair.</p>
<p>"Hey" she said softly, her eyes tearing up in sympathy. </p>
<p>"It hurts like a bitch, Sam" Brooke gasped out, as she turned to bury her head in the crook of Sam's neck. She had never been so happy to see the brunette in her life, though she couldn't say the same for everybody else who simply stood there and stared at her.</p>
<p>"I know" Sam said, "but just hang in there okay?" </p>
<p>She glanced towards Nicole.</p>
<p>"Did anyone get help?" Sam asked, smiling as Nicole and everyone else responded by holding up their mobile phones.</p>
<p>"We should be expecting a fleet of ambulances any minute now" Nicole answered with a small grin, her animosity towards the brunette set aside for the time being.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"We were trying a new move and she..." Nicole trailed off, recalling Brooke's scream as she landed awkwardly on her side. Nicole knew that she wouldn't be forgetting that sound anytime soon.</p>
<p>Sam nodded, turning her attention back to Brooke.</p>
<p>"I knew getting "Bring It On" on dvd was a bad idea" Sam joked, smiling as Brooke managed a weak one of her own. </p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You love me, right?"</p>
<p>Sam paused before she answered. "Yeah, I do".</p>
<p>"Then please punch me in the head and knock me out" Brooke pleaded as she closed her eyes, groaning in pain as another wave of agony tore through her body. Sam looked up as the crowd parted, relieved when Ms Glass came through, accompanied by two paramedics.</p>
<p>"They're here" Sam whispered, placing another kiss on her cheek. She stood back, watching as they carefully placed Brooke onto the stretcher. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke called out.</p>
<p>"Right here, Brooke" Sam answered as she stepped forward. Grabbing Brooke's hand, she followed beside them as they slowly made their way toward the ambulance. </p>
<p>"Gee Blondie, you've got yourself quite a fan club" Jack, the paramedic, commented to Brooke as he glanced backwards, amused by the large group of students following them.</p>
<p>"Brooke's the head cheerleader" Sam stated with a laugh, as if that explained everything. </p>
<p>Jack nodded, smiling. "I dated the head cheerleader when I was in high school".</p>
<p>"What happened?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"We got married" he replied happily. "Twenty years, last month".</p>
<p>"No offence Mister" Nicole interrupted, overhearing the conversation "but you don't look like a quarter back".</p>
<p>Sam and Brooke rolled their eyes as Jack laughed. </p>
<p>"I was never good at sports" He answered with a smile. "She left him for me".</p>
<p>At that last comment, Sam glanced at Brooke, to find the blonde gazing at her with a small smile on her face, despite the obvious pain she was in. Returning the smile, Sam stepped aside as Brooke was lifted into the ambulance.</p>
<p>Jack turned towards her.</p>
<p>"Your girlfriend's waiting for you" he said with a grin, waving her over. "You coming or not?"</p>
<p><i>Brooke's girlfriend?! </i></p>
<p>Not replying immediately, Sam was pushed forward by a gentle nudge from Ms Glass.</p>
<p>"Go on" she said, with a smile. "I'll call your parents to tell them what has happened".</p>
<p>Sam nodded gratefully before she jumped in.</p>
