<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 22 -->

<p>"Nice of you to join us ladies" Jane greeted them wryly, exchanging a concerned look with Mike, as Brooke and Sam sat on opposite ends of the couch, doing their very best not to look at each other.</p>
<p>"Brooke!" Jane gasped. "Your hand! What happened?"</p>
<p>"She banged it on something hard" Sam muttered sarcastically as she glared at the blonde, ignoring the impulse to get up and fetch some ice.</p>
<p>"More like hard-headed" Brooke sniped back, returning the glare. </p>
<p>Jane rolled her eyes. She should have known their truce was too good to be true. She held up her hand before Sam could respond.</p>
<p>"That's enough. Brooke, do you need to have that seen to?" She asked kindly.</p>
<p>"I'll be fine, thanks" Brooke replied gratefully. "Why did you call us down anyway?"</p>
<p>"It's three in the afternoon and this is the first time we've seen you today" Mike answered pointedly. "Which begs the question, what time did you get home last night?" </p>
<p>Brooke shrugged. "Around 1.30". </p>
<p>"Sam?" Jane asked, glancing at her daughter.</p>
<p>"We came home together" Brooke answered quickly, knowing that Sam would get into trouble for breaking their curfew. "Isn't that right Sam?"</p>
<p>"Right" Sam lied, putting on her best 'innocent' expression.</p>
<p>"What time, Sam?" Jane asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>"Just before three" Sam answered guiltily, looking away.</p>
<p>"You know you're supposed to be home by two" Mike commented sternly. "Where were you?"</p>
<p>Sam didn't answer, causing Jane to sit up in alarm.</p>
<p>"You weren't with...Alex were you?" Jane asked, horrified. "You didn't..."</p>
<p>"No!" Sam exclaimed, glaring at her. "No! We were just...talking..."</p>
<p>"Oh my god!" Jane whispered, clearly not believing her. </p>
<p>"Talking? You were talking? Is that what you kids call it these days?" Mike replied sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Dad!" Brooke said, shooting him a look.</p>
<p>"What the hell is wrong with you people?!" Sam cried out, watching in disbelief as her mother began to hyperventilate. "Mum, I promise you, I did not sleep with Alex!"</p>
<p>"It's true" Brooke jumped in, trying to help Sam out. "She slept with me".</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Mike exclaimed, standing up.</p>
<p>"I think I'm going to faint" was all Jane said.</p>
<p>"Everybody, sit down and SHUT UP!" Sam yelled, watching in satisfaction as everybody immediately complied. She stood up and knelt in front of her mother.</p>
<p>"I did not sleep with Alex, okay? I went to see him for a little while after the party, then I came home. Nothing happened!" Sam explained forcefully. "Understand?" </p>
<p>She stood up as Jane finally nodded, relieved that some colour was returning to her mother's face. If the situation wasn't so personally annoying, she would have laughed herself silly. This was easily the worst family meeting she'd ever had. </p>
<p>Sitting back down, she glanced at Brooke who was trying not to laugh. Sam hid her smile as she focused her attention back to her parents.</p>
<p>"Did you hear the storm last night?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Oh sweetie, I forgot" Mike interrupted, casting Brooke a sympathetic look. </p>
<p>"I couldn't sleep so Sam and I spent most of the night talking" Brooke explained, "which is why we slept in so late."</p>
<p>"Okay, that makes sense" Jane replied with a relieved smile, before she cast both girls a stern look. "However, both of you will still be punished".</p>
<p>"Excuse me" Brooke said, raising her hand, "I did not break any curfew". </p>
<p>"You lied so Sam wouldn't get into trouble" Mike explained, glancing over at Jane with a smile. "So, what can we deny them this time?"</p>
<p>"This sucks" Brooke grumbled, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>"Your loving every minute of this, aren't you?" Sam asked Jane, narrowing her eyes.</p>
<p>"It's one of the perks of teenage parenting" Jane answered with a grin, causing Sam to shake her head in amusement. She turned her attention to Brooke.</p>
<p>"For the rest of this week, your phone calls will be limited to one a day, for fifteen minutes" she informed her "rather than the usual three hours for every six hundred people you talk to".</p>
<p>Sam giggled as Brooke continued to glare.</p>
<p>"And you, young lady will be in charge of washing the dishes for the next two weeks" Mike continued, wiping the smile off Sam's face. Brooke snickered, knowing how much she hated cleaning up after dinner. </p>
<p>"Can we leave now?" Sam pleaded, standing up.</p>
<p>"Actually, we are" Mike replied, putting on his jacket. "Anyone interested in seeing a movie?"</p>
<p>"No" Sam and Brooke answered immediately.</p>
<p>Jane looked at them affectionately. "Please, don't think about it too hard." </p>
<p>"Why would anyone willingly hang out with their parents?" Brooke asked rhetorically. "Especially evil parents who enjoy punishing their beautiful and oh so innocent daughters".</p>
<p>"Right, innocent" Mike drawled as he kissed Brooke on the cheek. "Don't wait up for us."</p>
<p>"Ewww" Sam said, cringing. "Too much information".</p>
<p>Jane turned toward Sam just before she followed Mike out.</p>
<p>"You and Alex really didn't...."</p>
<p>"Mum!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay..." she replied sheepishly, before she closed the door.</p>
<p>"They are mental" Brooke commented wryly.</p>
<p>"You're telling me" Sam said, shaking her head. </p>
<p>They watched each other awkwardly, before Sam stepped forward and grabbed Brooke's left hand, pulling her towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>"I'm hungry" she explained simply.</p>
<p>As Brooke sat down at the kitchen table, Sam retrieved a small package from the freezer, wrapped it in a tea towel then gently placed it on Brooke's right hand.</p>
<p>"Should help with the swelling" she explained unnecessarily.</p>
<p>"Thanks" Brooke replied, her eyes following Sam around the kitchen.</p>
<p>"We've got some left over pizza. Is that okay?" she asked, glancing over.</p>
<p>"Sounds good" Brooke replied, having no idea what Sam had just asked her. </p>
<p><i>You might if you would stop staring at her ass, Brooke. </i></p>
<p>"Do you need any help?" Brooke offered, realising that she was just sitting there.</p>
<p>"No, I'm done" Sam said, taking the pizza out of the microwave and bringing it over. Grabbing a couple of glasses she sat beside Brooke and poured them each a drink.</p>
<p>"Want me to feed you?" Sam teased, gesturing at Brooke's injured hand.</p>
<p>"I'll manage" she replied, shooting her an amused glance. <i>You can sit on my lap though.</i> </p>
<p>Brooke found it best to keep that request to herself.</p>
<p>"Thanks for trying to help me out earlier" Sam said, after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged. "It's what friends do, right?"</p>
<p>Sam smiled, taking another slice of pizza. "Friends also help out with the dishes".</p>
<p>"Now that's pushing it" Brooke joked, making Sam laugh. </p>
<p>"Brooke, about earlier..." Sam faltered, not quite knowing what to say. Brooke sighed, shifting in her seat so she faced Sam. </p>
<p>"I know I shouldn't have hit him" she said.</p>
<p>"Why did you?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"I woke up to find him just staring at us with this look on his face! He was angry, jealous, like we were doing something wrong!" Brooke exclaimed, frustrated. </p>
<p>"What do you mean? What were we doing?" Sam asked, almost afraid of the answer.</p>
<p>Brooke blushed. "You were, um, we were, sort of, um, we..." She stopped, taking a deep breath. "I was holding you".</p>
<p>"Holding me?" </p>
<p>"Yeah, you had your head on my shoulder" Brooke explained with a smile. "And I had my arms around you".</p>
<p>"Oh" Sam replied with a grimace. It all made sense, now.</p>
<p>"Well, you looked pretty comfortable" Brooke commented wryly, wondering whether she should be offended.</p>
<p>"You don't understand Brooke" Sam said. "Last night, with Alex..."</p>
<p>Brooke's eyes widened. "You didn't..."</p>
<p>"No we didn't, but it wasn't for my lack of trying" Sam admitted. "I just couldn't go through with it. He asked me to stay the night so we could talk and I said no."</p>
<p>"I don't understand Sam" Brooke replied, confused. "What does this have to do with us?"</p>
<p>"He should have been in your place" Sam answered, pointedly. "I mean, think of it from his point of view. He walks into my room to find you holding me, when last night I said no to him wanting that very same thing. Of course he would be jealous".</p>
<p>"It's not as if we planned it" Brooke argued. "It happened while we were sleeping."</p>
<p>"I asked you to stay with me Brooke" Sam said. </p>
<p>"I was afraid, remember?" </p>
<p>"The storm had ended by then" Sam countered.</p>
<p>"Why are we debating this? What is your point?" Brooke asked, annoyed.</p>
<p>"My point is, in the last few days, I have been more of a girlfriend to you, than I have been with him!" Sam exclaimed, standing up. "The only thing we haven't done is kissed!"</p>
<p>Brooke sat there speechless, as Sam walked away.</p>
