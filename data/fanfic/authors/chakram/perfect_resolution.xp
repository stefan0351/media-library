<chapter>
<p>I cannot believe this is how I am spending New Years Eve.</p>
<p>There were a handful of clubs that I could have gone too, would have gone too, but Dad and Jane insisted that since this was our first New Years as a family, we should celebrate together.</p>
<p>Can you just feel my excitement? </p>
<p>So here I was, serving champagne to a myriad of people; relatives, family friends, Dad and Jane's business colleagues, neighbours and people from school, including my friends, who crashed the place. </p>
<p>Dad wasn't too happy at first to see so many high schoolers around, but after a few glasses of champagne that I innocently served to him, he doesn't seem to mind so much now. The last time I saw him, he was standing on one of the chairs trying to do the Ketchup Dance. I'm fortunate that I'm the most popular girl in high school. I think only I can get away with an embarrassment for a dad. </p>
<p>Could it get any worse?</p>
<p>"Brookie!"</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>"Hey Uncle Dave."</p>
<p>Actually, Dave isn't really my uncle. In fact, he's my dad's boss and I've known him forever. I'm like a granddaughter to him and he has this infuriating habit of pinching my cheeks whenever he sees me, which is why I have been avoiding him all night.</p>
<p>Owwwww! Does he have to pinch so damn hard?</p>
<p>"How's my favourite girl!"</p>
<p>And wait for it! Here it comes..."My haven't you grown."</p>
<p>"My, haven't you grown!"</p>
<p>I mentally roll my eyes though I plaster a smile on my face.</p>
<p>"You saw me last week Uncle Dave."</p>
<p>"Humour me Brookie." His face lights up as Sam walks by. </p>
<p>Whose Sam you may ask? </p>
<p>Well, she is my step sister and the biggest pain in my ass. </p>
<p>My arch nemesis. </p>
<p>My enemy. My adversary. </p>
<p>My foe. </p>
<p>My...I think you get the point. </p>
<p>She is also the love of my life, but that's a minor detail.</p>
<p>"Sammy! How's my favourite girl?"</p>
<p>"Hi Dave."</p>
<p>Hey! Hang on a minute.</p>
<p>"I thought I was your favourite girl?"</p>
<p>"Humour me Brookie." He turns back to Sam. "You just keep on getting more beautiful, don't you honey." He grabs Sam by the shoulders and turns her around so she's facing me. "Don't you think Brookie?"</p>
<p>I try my best not to stare but I can't help it. That hair, those eyes, those lips, oh my god, those lips, they definitely deserve a second mention, and those gorgeous curves. Okay, I think I'm staring at her breasts a little longer than I should be. Wouldn't you? Exactly! Just give me a couple of seconds. Oh yeah, just a couple more...okay, I'm done.</p>
<p>"She's not bad." </p>
<p> I'm such a liar. She's gorgeous.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Stunning.</p>
<p>Captivating.</p>
<p>Irresistible.</p>
<p>Magn...I think you get my point.</p>
<p>"Don't listen to her Sammy! Brookie doesn't know what she's talking about!"</p>
<p>This is how Uncle Dave treats his favourite girl?! Oh, excuse me, co-favourite girl?!</p>
<p>Sam smirks. "That's what I keep telling everybody but they don't listen."</p>
<p>I glare at Sam. Why am I in love with her again?</p>
<p>"Whatever."</p>
<p>Okay, so I've had better comebacks. </p>
<p>I leave Sam to deal with Uncle Dave and proceed to the living room, where Nicole, Mary Cherry, Sugar Daddy, Josh, Carmen, Lily and Harrison have gathered in front of the television. Since I've been doing my part playing the good little hostess, this is the first time I get to chill out for a bit.</p>
<p>I look at them with pride. It's amazing, but they're actually getting along. </p>
<p>I mean, sure, Nicole accidentally spilled her drink on Harrison five times, and made the suggestion to my dad that we use Carmen as kindling for the fireplace. And there was a very small confrontation when Mary Cherry sat next to Lily, rubbing her hands all over her leather jacket, informing her about how good cow felt on her body. Other than that, it's been quite peaceful. Believe me, this is one of the more uneventful unions between the two groups.</p>
<p>They practically pounce on me when they see me. I can't help but feel touched. </p>
<p>They've missed me.</p>
<p>"Champagne. Thank god," Josh mutters.</p>
<p>For once, they all nod in agreement. </p>
<p>Gee, thanks guys. </p>
<p>I sit on Sugar Daddy's knee and place my arm around his huge shoulders. He smiles at me. I love Sugar Daddy. He's like my big teddy bear.</p>
<p>"Sugar Daddy?"</p>
<p>"Yo."</p>
<p>"Can you fix this travesty the older generation call music?"</p>
<p>He grins. "I'm on it."</p>
<p>Sugar Daddy has the biggest collection of c.d's I've ever seen and I congratulate my foresight when asking him to bring them along in case of emergency situations like this. I don't doubt that Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Tony Bennett are legendary, and I know that most of the people here are fossils, but can you say zzzzzzzzzzz? </p>
<p>We all jump up once Sugar Daddy hi jacks the stereo, and the sounds of Kylie's "Love At First Sight' come blaring through the speakers. Dad wasn't really pleased at this new development and tried to change the music, but the sight of really bored teenagers glaring at him was enough to make him run away. It wasn't too long, and a couple of beers later, that he was back in the thick of it, dancing with Mary Cherry of all people.</p>
<p>Scary, scary visual.</p>
<p>The music and the dancing allows the time to pass quickly and one glance at my watch tells me that there is approximately ten minutes to go till 2003. I look back up to realise that the object of my intense scrutiny has disappeared. </p>
<p>In other words, I was perving at Sam while she was dancing. I leave the makeshift dance floor and do a quick circuit of the first floor, heading upstairs when I realise she's not amongst the many drunk people scattered through out. My stalking finds her sprawled on her bed.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" I ask, as my eyes slowly rake over her gorgeous, gorgeous body. </p>
<p>She looks up quickly and I force my eyes to meet hers. "Oh, it's you."</p>
<p>I smile. She actually sounded pleased when she said that.</p>
<p>"You actually sounded pleased when you said that."</p>
<p>"Don't flatter yourself Princess."</p>
<p>My smile disappears. Bubble bursting in T minus 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Three...Two...One....owwwww, that hurt.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to hide from Sean" she continues, sitting up.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"This guy doing work experience with my mum. She has it in her thick head we'd make a nice couple."</p>
<p>I think for a moment, then glance at her with wide eyes. "The guy you were dancing with" I confirm, as I try to stop the grin from splitting my face. She glares as I start laughing. </p>
<p>Oh my god, that's hilarious.</p>
<p>"He was trying to dance with me" she corrects, shooting daggers in my direction. "And stop laughing. It's not funny."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is" I manage to say, as I lean against the wall for support, holding my aching sides. The guy looks like an eighteen year old version of Austin Powers, complete with bad teeth, and minus the mojo. </p>
<p>"Why are you here?" Sam asks, scowling at me as she stands up. </p>
<p>I give her one last smirk and glance at my watch. "Five minutes till midnight."</p>
<p>Sam nods and we stare at each other for a moment and all I can think about is how much I want to kiss her. I really want to. I really really really really really want to. And damn it, I think I will.</p>
<p>If I screw up, I'll blame it on the champagne, despite not touching a drop. I can't stand the stuff, but I'll blame it anyway. That's what it gets for tasting so disgusting.</p>
<p>And if that doesn't work, I'll explain that it was a simple case of mistaken identity. "I'm sorry Sam, I thought you were Josh!" Sounds believable, right? Either way, I'm going to kiss those lips. Even if it's the first and last time, even if I get sued for sexual harrassment, at least I can say that I did it.</p>
<p>"Got any resolutions?" Sam finally asks, interrupting my one track mind.</p>
<p>"I've got a couple."</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"This."</p>
<p>She stares at me, confused. "This what?"</p>
<p>"This" I reply, clearly enjoying Sam in all her flustered glory.</p>
<p>"Would you speak English, you..."</p>
<p>And before she can finish insulting me, I close the door, and step forward, one hand tangling itself in her hair, the other pulling her towards me, and I finally do what I have been dreaming of doing for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>I kiss her slowly, thoroughly, and if it were even possible, I find myself even more turned on when I hear her moan into my mouth. Without stopping, I gently guide her backwards until we hit her desk, and with super cheerleader strength, (we do work out, you know) I grasp her hips and lift her on to it, so I'm standing between her legs.</p>
<p>I pull her against me and moan when I feel her breasts press up against mine, shoving my tongue into her mouth, my knees almost buckle when she begins sucking on it. I can feel myself losing control and I'm not sure how far we would have gotten if the knock at the door didn't scare us apart.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"  I call out as calmly as possible, Sam and I trying our best not to look like we were interrupted doing very naughty things. </p>
<p>It's Jane. "Two minutes till the countdown, girls." </p>
<p>She steps into the room and glances at us suspiciously, noticing our flushed faces and crumpled clothing. "What have you two been up to?"</p>
<p>I shrug and put on my best "innocent" face. "Nothing. We were just talking."</p>
<p>"You weren't fighting, we're you?" She asks, concerned. I send a quick thankyou to whatever higher power is up there for clueless parents. </p>
<p>"Of course not, mum" Sam replies with a laugh, like it's the most absurd thing she has ever heard. I nod enthusiastically, backing Sam up. </p>
<p>"Actually, we were just about to go down..." I feel myself turning red. "I mean, come down.." I clarify, glaring at Sam who begins snickering. Jane watches us for several moments before she shakes her head and walks out, muttering something about "strange, teenage girls". </p>
<p>Sam and I glance at each other before we silently follow her downstairs, joining everyone else in waiting for the countdown to start. Everybody grabs a glass of champagne, their attention on the screen, Dick Clarke once again hosting the celebrations in Times Square.</p>
<p>Sam stands beside me, as close as she dares, lowering her voice so only I can hear her, our eyes facing the television.</p>
<p>TWENTY</p>
<p>"Interesting resolution, Brooke"</p>
<p>NINETEEN</p>
<p>"I kind of like it myself, Sam"</p>
<p>EIGHTEEN</p>
<p>"I'm glad you shared it with me"</p>
<p>SEVENTEEN</p>
<p>"You did ask"</p>
<p>SIXTEEN</p>
<p>"I encourage you to continue with it"</p>
<p>FIFTEEN</p>
<p>"You do?"</p>
<p>FOURTEEN</p>
<p>"Definitely continue with it..."</p>
<p>THIRTEEN</p>
<p>"Any other words of wisdom?"</p>
<p>TWELVE</p>
<p>"Do it as often as possible"</p>
<p>ELEVEN</p>
<p>"I see"</p>
<p>TEN</p>
<p>"And I'd gladly help you out Brooke, with anything..."</p>
<p>NINE</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>EIGHT</p>
<p>"Of course..."</p>
<p>SEVEN</p>
<p>"I really appreciate that Sam..."</p>
<p>SIX</p>
<p>"In fact, the sooner we get started, the better..."</p>
<p>FIVE</p>
<p>"What do you suggest?"</p>
<p>FOUR</p>
<p>"My bedroom, ten minutes"</p>
<p>THREE</p>
<p>"Done"</p>
<p>TWO</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Brooke"</p>
<p>ONE</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Sam"</p>
<p>I grin as everybody begins celebrating. I turn towards Sam and embrace her tightly against me, exchanging a secret smile before we part ways to wish everyone else a Happy New Year. </p>
<p>I glance at my watch and feel like flying. Five minutes till Sam time. </p>
<p>This is going to be the best year yet.</p>
