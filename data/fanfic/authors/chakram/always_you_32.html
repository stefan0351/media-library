<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 32 -->

<p>"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes" Brooke greeted happily, smiling as Sam blushed and glanced discreetly around the crowded cafeteria to make sure no one had overheard. "Have you spoken to Carmen and Lily yet?" </p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes as she poked at her lunch with her fork. "I try, but whenever they see me, they scream and run in the other direction."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I would too if I knew you were after me."</p>
<p>"I just want to talk to them, that's all" Sam replied innocently.</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at her knowingly. "If you promise not to beat and torture them, I'll tell you where I saw them last."</p>
<p>Sam laughed, pushing her tray away. "I promise."</p>
<p>"The Novak" Brooke replied. "I saw them go in before I came here."</p>
<p>"Thanks Brooke" Sam replied gratefully, covering her hand and squeezing gently. "I'll go talk to them now before they allude me again." Standing up, Sam's expression fell as she observed Nicole heading for their table.</p>
<p>"Spam, leaving already?" Nicole asked with mock disappointment, before grinning brightly. "Good!"</p>
<p>"I tend to do that when I smell something nasty in the area" Sam sneered, secretly enjoying the verbal sniping that went on between them. She suspected that Nicole did as well.</p>
<p>Brooke stood up, glaring at them both. "Would it be too much to ask for you to try and get along?" </p>
<p>Nicole thought about it for a moment before turning to Sam. "We could at least pretend."</p>
<p>Sam shrugged. "Sounds good to me." </p>
<p>Not in the least impressed, Brooke watched as Nicole walked over to Sam and pulled her into a quick hug, eliciting shocked gasps and surprised looks from everybody present. </p>
<p>"Sam, it's so very good to see you" Nicole exclaimed with a grin. "How are you on this fine day?"</p>
<p>"I'm well Nicole, how about you?" Sam replied, amused despite herself.</p>
<p>"Couldn't be better, thank you for asking" Nicole answered sweetly, before turning to Brooke with a smirk. "How was that?"</p>
<p>"You're a riot, Nic" Brooke replied sarcastically, secretly pleased as Nicole and Sam stood together and smiled back at her. The unexpected alliance did not last long as Nicole once again returned to one of her favourite past times. </p>
<p>Spam baiting. </p>
<p>"Brooke told me the joyful news this morning" Nicole explained, her tone conveying everything but happiness. "I still don't get what she sees in you."</p>
<p>"Right back at you, Satan" Sam retorted, crossing her arms. She noticed Brooke's disappointed expression and sighed. She could never resist Brooke anything when she looked at her like that. "So I guess we're both lucky to have someone like her in our lives" she continued, this time more kindly.</p>
<p>Nicole regarded her for a moment before nodding her agreement. They smiled slightly at each other before growing increasingly uncomfortable, neither of them ever expecting to find themselves on the same side. Not knowing what else to say, they glanced desperately at Brooke, who simply responded with an amused grin.</p>
<p>"Right" Sam mumbled, breaking the awkward silence. "I'm going now."</p>
<p>"Sam, wait!" Brooke walked over, whispering in her ear. "I love you."</p>
<p>Sam smiled back, pulling Brooke into a gentle hug. "I love you too."</p>
<p>Overhearing this, and observing Brooke gazing fondly after Sam as she walked away, Nicole rolled her eyes. "I think I'm going to be sick and I've already done that twice today."</p>
<p>"You need to get used to this Nic" Brooke replied with a frown, returning to her seat. "She'll be sitting with us from now on."</p>
<p>"I said I would support you Brooke" Nicole answered. "It doesn't mean I want to hear the lovey dovey stuff and I never said I had to be happy about it."</p>
<p>"Happy about what?" Josh asked, joining them.</p>
<p>"Sam and I got together over the weekend" Brooke informed him with a huge grin.</p>
<p>Josh smiled, pulling her into a hug. "That's great, Brooke!"</p>
<p>Nicole stared at him in disbelief. "What? You're okay with this?"</p>
<p>"Sure" Josh replied, before turning to Brooke. "I've never seen you so happy. It's a nice look on you."</p>
<p>"Thanks Josh" Brooke replied, leaning over and kissing him on the cheek. </p>
<p>"You and Spam" Nicole gestured to Brooke, before directing her scowl towards Josh. "You and Lily. Whose next? Me and Harrison?"</p>
<p>"How about you and Carmen?" Josh suggested cheekily, as Brooke laughed loudly at Nicole's horrified expression. Looking up to see Jessie enter the cafeteria, she excused herself from the conversation, which now consisted of Nicole berating Josh for introducing a terrifying concept that her perfect and delicate ears had no business hearing, and walked over, sitting down uninvited and simply grinning. </p>
<p>Jessie regarded the happy blonde with great amusement. </p>
<p>"I'm guessing that Sam followed my advice." </p>
<p>Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"And I'm also guessing that Sam got the girl" Jessie continued.</p>
<p>Brooke nodded again.</p>
<p>"I'm very happy for the both of you" Jessie replied with a genuine smile. "You can tell her to send the cheque in the mail."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed, then turned serious. "All the money in the world couldn't adequately represent how grateful I am to you. I can't thankyou enough."</p>
<p>"I didn't really do anything Brooke" Jessie replied, embarrassed. "You would have found each other eventually."</p>
<p>"Maybe" Brooke answered "but I'm glad I found her now, rather than eventually."</p>
<p>Jessie nodded as she conceded the point, then smiled. "You're welcome."</p>
<p>"Oh, and Jessie?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Don't ever kiss Sam again."</p>
<p>Jessie glanced at her sheepishly, her face red with embarrassment. They both</p>
<p>laughed, Brooke trailing off as Alex stopped by their table. She glanced at him warily. </p>
<p>"Brooke" Alex greeted, cordially.</p>
<p>"Alex."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about your shoulder."</p>
<p>"Thankyou."</p>
<p>He dismissed her, turning towards Jessie. "Is the Zapruder meeting still on tonight?"</p>
<p>Jessie nodded. "Yeah. Are you coming?"</p>
<p>"Could you tell Sam that I'll be there?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell Sam herself?" Brooke suggested casually.</p>
<p>"Why don't you mind your own business, Brooke" Alex snapped, glaring at her.</p>
<p>Brooke ignored his last comment. "You're hurting her, you know that."</p>
<p>"Not half as much as she has hurt me" Alex replied bitterly. "Besides, I'm sure you've been there every step of the way, doing the very best you can to comfort her." He sneered at her knowingly. "Isn't that right, Brooke?" </p>
<p>"Does he know about the two of you?" Jessie asked, as Alex stormed off without waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>"No" Brooke replied, clearly disappointed. She hadn't wanted another confrontation, just a chance to patch things up. "He only knows how I feel about Sam."</p>
<p>"And he didn't tell her?"</p>
<p>"No he didn't, which has always confused me."</p>
<p>"Maybe he sensed she felt the same way about you and was afraid of losing her" Jessie suggested. "That would explain why he never said anything."</p>
<p>"You might be right."</p>
<p>"I'd be careful Brooke" Jessie offered. "It's obvious he isn't over her and who knows what he might do once he finds out."</p>
<p>Brooke cast her a worried glance. "You might be right about that too."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Carmen and Lily glanced at each other before staring fearfully up at the angry figure towering over them. They were seated in the Novak, their last chance of survival dashed as the last two occupants of the room quickly hurried out the door.</p>
<p>Carmen shot Lily another look and cursed inwardly at their collective stupidity. What on earth made them think the Novak would be a good hiding place? </p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>Lily cringed at Sam's calm tone, knowing it wouldn't last long. "We're sorry Sam."</p>
<p>"That's it?" Sam replied, angrily. "You're sorry?"</p>
<p>"What else do you want us to say?" Carmen asked meekly.</p>
<p>"How about you tell me" Sam started, her voice rising with every word "WHAT THE HELL YOU WERE THINKING?"</p>
<p>Lily grabbed onto Carmen's arm, shrinking back in fear as the yell echoed scarily around the room. "We just wanted to help out that's all."</p>
<p>"By telling Harrison that I was in love with him? Why?" Sam asked, confused. "Why would you tell him that?"</p>
<p>"Well, when you broke up with Alex, it sort of confirmed what we knew" Carmen replied, relieved as Sam's initial anger slowly drained away.</p>
<p>"That I loved Harrison?"</p>
<p>"That you loved someone else" Lily corrected.</p>
<p>"And we guessed it was Harrison" Carmen continued.</p>
<p>"I don't understand" Sam replied, throwing her hands up in confusion. "What did I do to make you think that?"</p>
<p>"Remember that foreign movie you supposedly caught one late night?" Carmen asked, watching as a look of stunned realisation crossed Sam's face. "About the girl who was in love with that guy friend of hers, despite being in a relationship already?"</p>
<p>"Oh my god" Sam muttered as she sat down beside them and leaned forward, covering her face with her hands. </p>
<p>"It was pretty obvious you were talking about yourself" Lily said. "You had been pretty down over the whole Alex break up and we thought you finally getting together with Harrison would be a nice surprise."</p>
<p>"Which is why we helped him plan everything" Carmen finished off.</p>
<p>"He isn't at school today!" Sam exclaimed, standing up once more. "Who knows how long it'll take for him to get over this! Do you have any idea what you've done?"</p>
<p>"We are so sorry, Sam" Lily apologized. "We honestly thought we were doing the right thing."</p>
<p>"I know that" Sam answered, taking in their sad expressions. "I appreciate you guys trying to look out for me, but next time, when you want to set me up with someone, let me know first okay?" She paused, then reconsidered. "Better yet, don't ever do this again. Ever!"</p>
<p>"Sure, Sam" Carmen replied. "We are so sorry."</p>
<p>"Did you speak to him at all yesterday?" Sam asked, as she sat down once more. </p>
<p>"He rang us both and from the way he was slurring his words" Carmen replied, "I'd say he had a few to drink."</p>
<p>"A few?!" Lily cried out. "That would be the understatement of the century! I could barely understand what he was saying!"</p>
<p>"That's because he was swearing at us in many different languages" Carmen replied wryly, making Sam laugh. </p>
<p>"I think you should stay out of Harrison's way, at least for a little while" Sam suggested. "You're too young to die."</p>
<p>"Point taken" Carmen replied sheepishly, silently vowing to never interfere with anybody else's love life ever again. She quickly dismissed that noble idea as a thought struck her suddenly. "Sam, if you're not in love with Harrison, then who is it?" Sam stared at her as Carmen shrugged unrepentantly. "Inquiring minds want to know."</p>
<p>"Inquiring minds got us into this mess in the first place" Sam pointed out.</p>
<p>"You're not even going to tell us?" Lily asked, hurt. "Your best friends?"</p>
<p>"Maybe if you had confided in us then..."</p>
<p>"What?" Sam interrupted Carmen. "So all this is my fault, is it?"</p>
<p>"Well, she does have a point Sam" Lily replied cautiously, aware of Sam's rising anger. "You've been pretty distant lately. I mean, you didn't even tell us that you broke up with Alex! We had to figure that out for ourselves. You tell Brooke, but not us?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, what's up with that?" Carmen asked, backing Lily up.</p>
<p>"Don't turn this around on me! I don't remember asking either of you to play Ms Matchmaker" Sam snapped, glaring at them both. "Your interfering may cost me one of the most important relationships in my life, so don't push me any further on this. You're getting off lightly and you know it."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay" Lily replied, holding up her hands in a placating gesture. "We've been there and said sorry for that and we will till the end of time."</p>
<p>Sam rubbed at her face tiredly. "Look, a lot of things have happened and I'll be the first to admit I've struggled to deal with it all..."</p>
<p>"Then let us help you Sam" Carmen replied, placing an arm around her shoulders. "That's what we're here for, right?"</p>
<p>"You trust us, don't you?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>"I do, but you know me. I'm not exactly Ms Share My Feelings With The World."</p>
<p>"We're not the world Sam" Carmen pointed out. </p>
<p>"I don't mean to shut you out."</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Lily asked, concerned.</p>
<p>Sam smiled, thinking of Brooke. "All things considering, yeah, I'm okay."</p>
<p>"Are you going to answer the question or not?" Carmen blurted out, curiosity getting the better of her. Sam chuckled softly as Lily shot her a look. "Carmen!"</p>
<p>"Don't Carmen me! You want to know this just as much as I do!" Carmen replied, defensively. "Come on Sam, spill. If it isn't Harrison, than whose the lucky guy?" </p>
<p>"Who says I broke up with Alex because of someone else?"</p>
<p>Carmen and Lily exchanged exasperated looks. "Remember the conversation we just had?" Lily asked. "About sharing your feelings?"</p>
<p>"And what next?" Sam replied. "Do we hold hands in a caring circle and sing kum-by-ya?"</p>
<p>"Samantha McPherson!" Lily cried out, frustrated. "Stop delaying the inevitable and answer the damn question!"</p>
<p>"And don't you even think of denying it" Carmen continued, pointing a finger at her. "We may have ruined the cake but we got the ingredients right!"</p>
<p>Sam and Lily stared at her blankly. "Huh?"</p>
<p>"We're right about you liking someone" Carmen explained impatiently, "however, we got the subject of your affections wrong."</p>
<p>"Interesting choice of analogy there Carmen" Sam replied, with a laugh.</p>
<p>"I'm hungry" Carmen replied with a shrug. "And don't you change the subject, Sam! You've got that glow!"</p>
<p>Sam frowned. "Glow?"</p>
<p>"The glow of getting some!" Lily replied smugly, smiling at the stunned look on Sam's face. "Come on Sam, if Alex and Harrison didn't steal your heart, who did?"</p>
<p>Before Sam could even consider her reply, the door opened wide and the answer to Lily's question walked in, smiling brightly at Sam before turning to acknowledge the other two. "I'm happy to see you're still alive" Brooke greeted them wryly, before glancing at Sam who sat there chuckling at the blonde's perfect sense of timing. "What's with you?" </p>
<p>Sam smiled as she stood up and took her place by Brooke side. "Lily and Carmen have it in their big prying heads that I'm in love with someone else."</p>
<p>Brooke gazed at her affectionately. "Is that so?" Sam nodded, as Carmen and Lily watched their interaction in confused silence. "Should I tell them?"</p>
<p>"I don't see why not." </p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind making them wait a little longer. You know, for punishment."</p>
<p>"SAAAM!"</p>
<p>Finally taking pity on them, Sam laughed, then placed her arm around Brooke's waist, pulling her close. "You want to know who has stolen my heart?" Sam smiled. "You're looking at her."</p>
<p>The couple watched with amusement as their eyes widened and jaws dropped simultaneously. Removing herself from Sam's embrace, Brooke stepped forward and knelt in front of the two stunned brunette's, waving her hand in front of their faces. No response. </p>
<p>"I think we put them in a coma" Sam said, leaning over Brooke's shoulder. The blonde laughed, then glanced at her watch, slightly concerned. "It's been almost five minutes."</p>
<p>"Wha...I...when...how...what?"</p>
<p>Sam laughed at Carmen's less than coherent response. "She's alive!"</p>
<p>Lily blinked, still shocked. "I think what Carmen is trying to say is since when?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. "Friday night."</p>
<p>Carmen shook her head in amazement. "Wow! I can't believe this!"</p>
<p>"You're okay with this aren't you?" Sam observed them intently, suddenly afraid of their answer. "I mean, you're happy for us right?" </p>
<p>Carmen glanced at Lily. "Should we tell them?"</p>
<p>Lily smirked. "I don't see why not."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind making them wait a little longer" Carmen added, smiling evilly. "You know, for punishment." Seconds barely passed as their excitement got the better of them, Lily and Carmen throwing themselves at the uncertain couple and hugging them tightly, before they pulled away and beamed at them.</p>
<p>"Of course we're happy for you!" Carmen exclaimed, jumping up and down with excitement. "Why wouldn't we be?"</p>
<p>"Looking back, I can't believe we didn't see it earlier" Lily admitted. "It seems so obvious now." She grabbed them both by the arm and pulled them towards the seat. "Now sit your happy couple asses down, and tell us everything!"</p>
<p>Sam laughed and did just that.</p>
