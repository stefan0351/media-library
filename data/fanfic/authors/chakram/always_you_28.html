<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 28 -->

<p>Shutting the door with her foot, Sam blindly walked into the living room and placed the assorted flowers, cards and chocolates on the floor. Taking a look around, Sam snickered as the once clean and tidy living room now resembled their outside garden. </p>
<p>She had been stopped in the corridor all day, by almost everyone, wondering how Brooke was doing, and whether Sam could give this to Brooke when she got home, and when was Brooke coming back to school and...</p>
<p>Sam sighed. She had talked to more people in the last day than she had in the entire time she had been attending Kennedy High. Her car had been filled with so many flowers, some smart ass actually asked if she was thinking of opening a nursery.</p>
<p>Picking up the box of chocolates closest to her, Sam sat down with a sigh. The chocolates were meant for Brooke but Sam felt she deserved some compensation for being the messenger. Who knew being sociable could be so exhausting? Besides, it had taken four trips to unload everything from her car, she needed the energy.</p>
<p>"Sam? Is that you?" Brooke called out as she walked down the stairs. "I was wondering..." She stopped. "Oh my god".</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "Your loyal subjects have showered you with gifts."</p>
<p>Brooke narrowed her eyes as she took in the opened box of chocolates. "Are you eating one of those gifts?"</p>
<p>"Yes" Sam replied without shame. "Want one?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled as she sat down beside her. "When have I ever said no to chocolate? Especially chocolate that belongs to me?"</p>
<p>Sam smirked. "How are you feeling?"</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged with her good shoulder. "It's still sore, but the pain killers help". She smiled cheekily. "I like those."</p>
<p>Sam laughed as she unwrapped another piece of chocolate. </p>
<p>"So, did you miss me at school?" Brooke asked, as she adjusted her sling.</p>
<p>"Brooke, you've been gone one day" Sam answered in amusement. <i>And yes, I did.</i></p>
<p><i>"</i>Hey, I missed you" Brooke replied with mock hurt.</p>
<p>"Is that so?" Sam asked, glancing at her.</p>
<p>"Yes I did." Brooke paused. "I needed a drink and I couldn't be bothered getting up."</p>
<p>Sam laughed, slapping her on the thigh. "If you weren't already a cripple..."</p>
<p>"That's shoulderly challenged, Missy" Brooke replied, taking another chocolate. Popping it into her mouth, Brooke shifted so she could lie down, placing her head in Sam's lap. "Now, be a good dear and fill me in on the day's gossip".</p>
<p>Sam shot her an amused look. "Okay, well..."</p>
<p>"Sam, you're forgetting something."</p>
<p>Sam stared at her for a moment, then smirked. "Right, sorry." She began running her fingers through Brooke's hair, grinning as she heard the blonde sigh in pleasure.</p>
<p>"You know what I'm getting you for your birthday?" Sam asked with a grin.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"The orgasmatron".</p>
<p>"The what?" Brooke cried out, her eyes widening in surprise.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "It's this metal thingie that messages your head."</p>
<p>"Is it any good?" Brooke asked, interested.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah" Sam purred blissfully, blushing as she realised Brooke was staring at her.</p>
<p>"That good, huh?" Brooke asked, amused.</p>
<p>"Oh ye.." Sam stopped as Brooke began to laugh. "You, shut your face".</p>
<p>Before Brooke could comment any further, the phone rang. Standing up, Sam went to answer it, walking back to the couch where Brooke immediately resumed her previous position.</p>
<p>"Hello?" </p>
<p>Sam laughed silently as Brooke grabbed her hand and placed it on her head, in a not so subtle hint to continue her head message. </p>
<p>"Sam, it's Harrison."</p>
<p>"Hey, what's up?" Sam asked in surprise, before silently letting Brooke know who it was.</p>
<p>"I was wondering if you were doing anything on Sunday?" He asked nervously.</p>
<p>"Uh, no, I don't think so, why?" Sam asked, bewildered. </p>
<p>"Well, I just found out my parents are out for the day, and I was wondering if you'd like to come over?" </p>
<p>"Harrison, is something wrong?"</p>
<p>"No, no, nothing's wrong" Harrison replied with a laugh, which sounded more like a squeak. Sam pulled the phone away and stared at it. Catching Brooke's concerned look, she shrugged, pulling the phone back to her ear.</p>
<p>"It's just that there's something I'd like to talk to you about. It's important." </p>
<p>"Do you want me to come over now?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"No, it can wait." Harrison replied. "I'll make lunch and everything, okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure" Sam answered hesitantly. "I'll see you then."</p>
<p>Saying their good-byes, Sam hung up the phone.</p>
<p>"What was that about?" Brooke asked, reaching for more chocolate.</p>
<p>"He wants me over at his place for lunch on Sunday. Apparently he has something important that he wants to talk to me about". </p>
<p>"Any ideas what it could be?" </p>
<p>"Your guess is as good as mine" Sam replied, confused. "He sounded weird, nervous even".</p>
<p>"Just the two of you?"</p>
<p>Sam shrugged. "I think so."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a date" Brooke commented casually, playing with the chocolate wrapper.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "With Harrison? Yeah right! Besides, he's in love with you, remember?"</p>
<p>Brooke shook her head. "No he isn't. Not anymore. Not for a long time".</p>
<p>"I think you're reading too much into it Brooke" Sam commented. "Lay off the pain killers for a little while, okay?"</p>
<p>"If you say so." Brooke paused. "You've certainly become everyone's love muffin, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Sam asked, shooting her a look.</p>
<p>"Jessie" Brooke answered simply, sitting up. "Never knew you swung that way, Sam. Is that why you left Alex? For her?"</p>
<p>Sam watched her for several moments before replying. "Jessie and I are not a couple. We just kissed, that's all."</p>
<p>"As you do" Brooke replied sarcastically, not quite succeeding in hiding her jealousy. </p>
<p>"I don't owe you any explanations, Brooke" Sam answered angrily. "If you don't want to believe me, fine." She stood up. "I don't see why you care so much anyway."</p>
<p>Brooke shook her head, laughing bitterly. "Oh get a clue, Sam". </p>
<p>And with that, Brooke headed up to her room, leaving a very confused Sam in her wake.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Hi, can I speak with Jessie please?" </p>
<p>"Can I ask who is calling?"</p>
<p>"It's Sam."</p>
<p>"Just a sec, Sam"</p>
<p>"Thankyou."</p>
<p>"JESSIE! PHONE!"</p>
<p>Sprawled on her bed, Sam winced as Jessie's brother screamed directly into her ear. Sam smiled, once the ringing in her ears stopped. She always did that to Nicole whenever the blonde rang for Brooke.</p>
<p>She continued listening as Jessie came to the phone.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" She asked her brother</p>
<p>"Some girl called Sam. Is she hot?"</p>
<p>"Give me that!"</p>
<p>"She sounds hot."</p>
<p>"Piss off Brian!" </p>
<p>Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"Hello?" Jessie croaked on the other end, once her brother left the room.</p>
<p>"You sound awful," Sam greeted, cringing as Jessie began coughing over the phone.</p>
<p>"Remind me not to come to you whenever I need cheering up, okay Sam?" Jessie replied, once her cough subsided.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "I guess I don't have to ask why I haven't seen you at school lately."</p>
<p>"Remember when I told you that I was visiting Sarah?" Jessie asked rhetorically. "She repaid my kindness by passing on her germs".</p>
<p>"That's a beautiful story" Sam commented wryly.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it" Jessie replied with a laugh, then a sneeze. She paused for a moment before she continued seriously. "I'm glad you called Sam. I felt so bad after what happened, I was thinking that maybe you weren't happy with me or something".</p>
<p>"I told you not to feel bad about it." Sam admonished gently. "It's okay, Jess, really."</p>
<p>"Did you talk things over with Brooke?" Jessie asked, before a thought struck her. "How is she by the way? I heard about what happened yesterday, that's gotta suck." </p>
<p>"She's pretty sore" Sam replied. "But otherwise fine."</p>
<p>"Have you been taking good care of her?" Jessie asked cheekily.</p>
<p>Sam laughed sadly. "I was until we got into another argument."</p>
<p>Jessie rolled her eyes. "What is it with you two? What did you fight about this time?"</p>
<p>"You, actually."</p>
<p>Earlier that week, after Brooke had caught them kissing, Sam had considered coming out to her family. She had locked herself away and revved herself up, forcing herself to believe that admitting her homosexuality out loud would be the right thing to do and may then, all the chaotic thoughts and feelings surging through her would finally leave her alone once she did. </p>
<p>In the end, she couldn't go through with it. </p>
<p>This afternoon, Sam had once again barricaded herself away from everybody else, refusing to come down for dinner, spending hours thinking about everything that had happened in the past several months. This time it wasn't about her sexuality. </p>
<p>Brooke had told her to get a clue, and she did. </p>
<p>A big one, and everything had finally made sense. </p>
<p>"Why do you think she left the room?" Jessie asked, once Sam had finished explaining her earlier conversation with Brooke.</p>
<p><i>She loves me the way I love her. And it terrifies me.</i></p>
<p>"I don't know" Sam answered meekly</p>
<p>"Bullshit" Jessie replied bluntly. "You know why, Sam. Just say it." </p>
<p>She sighed, when Sam didn't respond. </p>
<p>"Fine, I'll say it if you need me to confirm what you already know. Brooke is jealous, because she is in love with you."</p>
<p>"What if we are wrong?" Sam finally asked.</p>
<p>Jessie laughed. "Do you want me to tell you how I know?"</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"When Brooke saw us kissing, I imagined that was how I looked liked when I first walked in on Sarah kissing her boyfriend. Hurt, confused, angry, jealous as hell. It was all in her face, Sam" Jessie explained softly. "Now it's up to you. Don't you even think of wasting this opportunity".</p>
<p>"Jessie, I..."</p>
<p>"I don't want to hear it Sam!" Jessie interrupted, frustrated. "Do you have any idea how much I envy you right now? To know that the one person you love feels the same way you do? What I wouldn't give to know Sarah felt the same way I did! I'll kick your ass if I have to, I mean it!"</p>
<p>Sam laughed softly. "Okay, Jess. I'm just scared, you know?" </p>
<p>"I know Sam, but this is what you want. Don't let fear get the better of you" Jessie encouraged, with a cough. "Now, I'm going to let you go, because one, I'm about to faint, two, my throat is killing me, and three, you're going to make one gorgeous blonde, a very happy girl. Yes?"</p>
<p>Sam snickered. "Yes, boss".</p>
<p>"Now we're talking" Jessie replied, clearing her throat. "Let me know how it goes, okay?"</p>
<p>"I will" Sam answered. "Take care of yourself, and thanks Jess. I owe you big time."</p>
<p>Hanging up the phone, Sam stood up and began pacing. How the hell was she going to do this? </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Walking into the living room, Sam found Brooke sitting on the couch, impatiently flicking through the channels. Smiling inwardly at the frustrated expression on her face, Sam gingerly sat down on the seat across from her, trying her very best to control her frayed nerves.</p>
<p>She wasn't succeeding. </p>
<p>"Where are they?" She asked, referring to their parents.</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged, having difficulty meeting her eyes. "They said something about visiting a friends house. I wasn't really paying attention".</p>
<p>Sam nodded, not really caring where they were. She was just glad Brooke was talking to her.</p>
<p>They sat in awkward silence for several moments, before Sam stood up and gently grabbed the remote control from Brooke's hands, switching the television off. Turning to Brooke, she shoved her hands into her pockets, wanting to hide the fact that they were shaking slightly.</p>
<p>"Listen, I know it's a little late, but do you want to go for a walk?" Sam asked, surprised at how calm she sounded. "If you're not up to it that's okay, um, if you need to rest..."</p>
<p>Brooke stood up, smiling gently. "My legs work fine."</p>
<p>Sam nodded, relieved. "After you."</p>
<p>Switching off the lights, Sam shut the door behind them.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Where are we going?" Brooke asked finally, several minutes into their journey. </p>
<p>"Jacob's Reserve."</p>
<p>"Wow" Brooke replied, surprised. "It's been a while since I've been. You go there often?"</p>
<p>Sam nodded. "It's peaceful".</p>
<p>"It's definitely a nice place" Brooke agreed. "I used to love the pond."</p>
<p>"It's where my parents got together, actually" Sam commented casually.</p>
<p>"Really? How romantic" Brooke replied, with a grin. "What happened?" </p>
<p>"From what my mother tells me, she was wearing this hat that got blown away by the wind and of course, it landed in the pond. My dad was nearby and tried to reach it with a long branch, but fell in" Sam explained with a laugh.</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. "And your dad's version?"</p>
<p>"He took off his shirt and gallantly retrieved the hat by swimming for it" Sam replied, amused. "Once mum got a look at his manly chest, it was love at first sight."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"He asked her out then and there and she said yes" Sam finished with a shrug.</p>
<p>"That's a great story Sam" Brooke commented sincerely, knowing how difficult it was for Sam to talk about her father. </p>
<p>Sam nodded, clearing her throat. "That place means a lot to me. When I was a kid, we used to go there all the time." She paused, trying to regain her composure. "I don't think Mum has been there since he died." </p>
<p>"But you have" Brooke said, gently.</p>
<p>"I can't give it up" Sam replied, looking at her tearfully. "It's my way of remembering him, you know? It's like, when I'm there, he's watching over me. I know it sounds crazy..."</p>
<p>"It doesn't" Brooke reassured her with a smile. She paused thoughtfully. "I hope he wasn't watching over me when Josh and I went there to make out."</p>
<p>Sam burst out laughing. "How do you do that?" She asked finally, glancing at Brooke in amusement.</p>
<p>"Do what?" Brooke asked with a grin. She loved Sam's laugh.</p>
<p>"Know exactly what to say to cheer me up?"</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at her shyly. "I know you".</p>
<p>Sam watched her for a few moments before she smiled. "One of my earliest memories of you was at the park" Sam admitted. "I don't think you'd remember, though."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"I think we were about seven" Sam explained. "We were playing in the sand pit and we decided to build a castle together."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "That's right! I was there with my mum and she told me to go play with the nice, pretty girl in the sand pit."</p>
<p>"Do you remember what happened next?" Sam asked, shaking her head ruefully.</p>
<p>"I think so." Brooke replied, trying to remember. "I wanted the castle to have a garden, but you wanted to build a moat and we started yelling at each other." She laughed. "We had to be separated".</p>
<p>"Yep" Sam confirmed, with a grin. "You even pulled my hair!"</p>
<p>"You pushed me face first into the sand" Brooke replied, with a mock glare. "And squashed all my flowers that I collected for the garden, you brat!"</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "It was definitely a sign of things to come wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Brooke grinned. "Who would have thought that nine years later we'd be heading towards the same place as friends?"</p>
<p><i>And hopefully leaving later as more,</i> Sam added silently<i>.</i></p>
<p>"We're here" Brooke commented unnecessarily, shooting Sam a smile. </p>
<p>They walked down the pebbled path which took them towards the pond, Sam clenching and unclenching her hands to keep them from shaking. She was so nervous, she felt like throwing up.</p>
<p>Reaching the pond, she turned to face Brooke, the fear clearly visible on her face.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Brooke asked, concerned.</p>
<p>"We need to talk." Sam responded shakily.</p>
<p>Brooke gazed at her for a moment before she looked away. "I know."</p>
<p>Sam grabbed her by the hand, leading Brooke to her favourite spot which lay several metres away. She stopped as they both stared at it.</p>
<p>"It's a tree, Sam" Brooke commented in amusement, despite the millions of butterflies that were trying to escape her stomach. "A big tree, to be sure..."</p>
<p>Sam let go of her hand, watching her. "Step closer and take a look."</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at her nervously, but did as she asked. Walking hesitantly towards the tree, she peered at the bark, not really sure what she was supposed to be looking at. Shooting Sam a look over her shoulder, Brooke turned back towards the tree and glanced down.</p>
<p>And that's when she saw it. </p>
<p><i>Sam loves Brooke.</i></p>
<p>She froze. Not quite believing what she was seeing, Brooke slowly reached out and traced the words with her fingers. </p>
<p>They were real. </p>
<p>Not wanting to turn away, fearful that the words might disappear, Brooke continued gazing at them, hot tears sliding down her cheeks, overcome with awe at how three simple words could inspire such unimaginable feelings inside her. </p>
<p>She never knew that it would feel like this. </p>
<p>Sam watched on as Brooke simply stood there. Forcing her legs to move, and pushing aside her urge to run, Sam hesitantly stepped forward and encircled Brooke's waist with her arms, tightening them as the blonde leaned back against her. Resting her cheek against Brooke's, they regarded the words silently before Sam whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>"It's always been you."</p>
