<chapter title="Part 1">
<p>It was almost midnight as Sam sat at her desk, her eyes glued to the monitor in front of her. </p>

<p>"You need to lay off the fan fiction, dearie!"</p>

<p>Letting out a startled yelp, Sam leapt out of her chair. Taking a few moments to recover from the shock, Sam turned around, ready to blast whoever dared interrupt her reading. She froze, unable to believe what she was seeing. </p>

<p>Blinking rapidly, Sam was convinced that hours sitting in front of the computer had reduced her eyes to mush. She rubbed her eyes and continued to stare wide-eyed at the vision before her. </p>

<p>"Relax Sam, you're not going to mental. I'm really here."</p>

<p>"I know this is a stupid question, but who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm you, just from another timeline. An alternate universe if you will."</p>

<p>"This cannot be happening."</p>

<p>"Well, it is, so get over it."</p>

<p>"Alternate universe? That stuff is true?"</p>

<p>"Hey, Star Trek isn't just for geeks, you know! Besides, there isn't just one alternate universe. There are millions. Every action, every reaction, every choice has it's own path, it's own timeline."</p>

<p>"You're kidding me."</p>

<p>"Nope. For example, yesterday you decided to eat chocolate ice-cream, after debating for hours whether you should eat strawberry."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Well, in another universe, you went with strawberry. In another, you ate both. It may be an insignificant detail, but something as small as that can lead to a completely different outcome in your life. In another timeline, Sam McPherson is a guy, and in another, you live in Australia. There are endless possibilities and each timeline reflects that!"</p>

<p>"Should you even be telling me this?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, doesn't that change everything? Me knowing all this, what if I go and tell everybody what you told me?"</p>

<p>"And they will believe you, why?"</p>

<p>"Good point."</p>

<p>"Besides, I'm not here to tell you your future. I'm here to offer you guidance and all that sappy stuff."</p>

<p>"What about you're life?"</p>

<p>"I'm dead."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I died a few months ago."</p>

<p>"What? How? Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, to cut a long story short, Brooke and I were fighting for Harrison."</p>

<p>"Harrison?!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, can you believe it? I don't know what I was thinking either. Anyway, we all went to the prom together where he informed us that he wanted to date Brooke."</p>

<p>"Gee, what a surprise."</p>

<p>"It's not what you think. Harrison, at least my Harrison, loved me. I guess he just loved Brooke more."</p>

<p>"So, what happened?"</p>

<p>"Brooke ran off crying."</p>

<p>"I don't understand! She wanted him, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"I'll get to that. So she runs off, and I went after her. I get outside and I see Nicole trying to run her over with a car."</p>

<p>"What?!"</p>

<p>"She was drunk, she and Brooke weren't on speaking terms."</p>

<p>"Oh my god. And you..."</p>

<p>"Yep. I pushed Brooke out of the way, and got hit. Hurt like a bitch, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I can't believe this..."</p>

<p>"Sounds like some insane plot from a television show, huh?"</p>

<p>"And you died."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"What about Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Physically, she's fine."</p>

<p>"That's good to know. How is she dealing with my...your death?"</p>

<p>"She's devastated."</p>

<p>"She is?"</p>

<p>"She was in love with me."</p>

<p>"She was?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. She told me as I was dying."</p>

<p>"And you..."</p>

<p>"Love her too."</p>

<p>"And how's mum?"</p>

<p>"Not much better."</p>

<p>"Jesus."</p>

<p>"He's a nice guy."</p>

<p>"What? Don't answer that, just let me think about all this okay?"</p>

<p>"I know it's a lot to take in."</p>

<p>"You think?"</p>

<p>"I never realised how annoying my sarcastic side was."</p>

<p>"Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to make the same mistake that I did."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You're in love with Brooke."</p>

<p>"Am not!"</p>

<p>"Oh give it up Sam! You're talking to yourself remember!"</p>

<p>"Isn't my timeline different than yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. But there are plenty of similarities, which is why I'm here. Your feelings for Brooke are exactly the same as mine."</p>

<p>"Does my Brooke feel the same way about me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know?"</p>

<p>"I can't read minds Sam!"</p>

<p>"And you want me to tell her how I feel."</p>

<p>"That pretty much sums it up."</p>

<p>"No way. Can't you go haunt another Sam or something?"</p>

<p>"Nope, you're stuck with me."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"Till I drive you crazy."</p>

<p>"You're doing a good job of it so far."</p>

<p>"Thankyou."</p>

<p>"Well, do you have to stand there the entire time? Go for a walk or something."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'm stuck to you. Like that Heart and Souls movie."</p>

<p>"Oh great."</p>

<p>"Let's go visit Brooke!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh come on! I haven't seen her up close in months. Please!"</p>

<p>"Would she be able to see you?"</p>

<p>"No. Only you can."</p>

<p>"You won't be able to take over my body will you?"</p>

<p>"No, unfortunately. If I did, the first thing I'd do is kiss Brooke senseless."</p>

<p>"Hey! She's my Brooke and if there is any kissing, I'll be the one to do it, okay?!"</p>

<p>"D'uh! That's why I'm here, dumb ass!"</p>

<p>"Do you miss her? Your Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Like you wouldn't believe."</p>

<p>"I'm really sorry. About what happened to you."</p>

<p>"I'd do it over and over, a million times, if it meant she was safe."</p>

<p>Sam watches her silently for a few moments. "Let's go visit Brooke."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Sam."</p>

<p>"You're welcome...uh, Sam."</p>

<p>Entering the bathroom, Sam hesitantly raises her hand to knock on the door. Alt Sam stops her by placing a hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"She won't hear you. She's got her head phones on." </p>

<p>"Oh, okay."</p>

<p>Sam silently opens the door and they step inside, watching Brooke type away furiously at the computer, humming away to whatever song she is listening to. Alt Sam walks over and places a kiss on Brooke's head before she crouches beside her, tears making their way down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh my god."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"She's so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"My Brooke was a brunette"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. She looks great as a blonde too."</p>

<p>Brooke, sensing that someone is with her, removes her headphones and turns around to find Sam hovering in the doorway talking to...no one.</p>

<p>"Sam?"</p>

<p>Sam looks up, surprised, not realizing that Brooke is now aware of her. "Uh, yeah?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing?"</p>

<p>"Why are you staring at me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not staring at you."</p>

<p>"And why are you talking to yourself?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't." Sam watches in amazement as Alt Sam sits on Brooke's lap and places an arm around her shoulders. "What are you doing? Don't sit there!"</p>

<p>Brooke looks at her, confused. "Sit where?"</p>

<p>Alt Sam glares at Sam. "Hey, I'm a dead girl. Let me have some joy, okay?"</p>

<p>"Sam?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What the hell is wrong with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's wrong."</p>

<p>"What are you staring at?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Um, okay. Is there something you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Uh..."</p>

<p>"She smells so good! Just like I remembered" Alt Sam interrupts happily.</p>

<p>"Would you stop talking?" Sam asks Alt Sam.</p>

<p>Brooke frowns. "I wasn't saying anything."</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't talking to you."</p>

<p>"Who were you talking to?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't meant to bother you. I'll be going now."</p>

<p>Alt Sam jumps up. "No!"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Brooke stands up, annoyed. She wonders if Sam is on drugs. "Yes, what?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight, Brooke. Sorry to interrupt whatever you were doing!" </p>

<p>Brooke watches as Sam then speaks to the empty space beside her. "Come on! Don't make me drag you!" Alt Sam takes one last look at Brooke as she reluctantly gets pulled away. </p>

<p>Brooke just stares in bewilderment as Sam shuts the door behind her.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 2">
<p>Alt Sam yawns loudly as she sits besides Sam who is using her free period at school to work on her article for the newspaper.</p>

<p>"Thanks for reminding me what a boring life I used to lead."</p>

<p>"Hey, I didn't ask you to leave Heaven! Blame yourself."</p>

<p>"Are you nearly done?"</p>

<p>"If you would shut your mouth for just one minute, I would have finished this ages ago." Sam finishes typing the last few lines. "There, done."</p>

<p>"For all my bitching, I must offer my congratulations. That's a great article."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>She stands up and realizes that everybody has been staring at her the entire time. She glares at Alt Sam, before she offers a sheepish look towards the rest of the class.</p>

<p>"I like talking to myself sometimes."</p>

<p>Alt Sam laughs. "If only they knew!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!"</p>

<p>She offers one last smile before she runs out of the class room.</p>

<p>"You're making me look demented."</p>

<p>"You don't need my help with that, Sam. What do we have next?"</p>

<p>"Bio."</p>

<p>"Oh no!"</p>

<p>"Look at it this way, you get to stare at Brooke the entire time."</p>

<p>"Lead the way, Oh living One!"</p>

<p>Sam takes her seat while Alt Sam leaps onto the bench.</p>

<p>"There was one advantage to being dead."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"No more staring at Bio Glass."</p>

<p>They share a laugh, Sam quieting down as the rest of the class files in.</p>

<p>"Can you try and stay quiet, please? Just this once."</p>

<p>"I've been on my best behaviour the entire time I've been with you."</p>

<p>"I don't need your extra commentary while I'm in class. It distracts me!"</p>

<p>"It's not my fault you laugh."</p>

<p>"The teachers are beginning to wonder if I'm insane! You've been with me less than a day and you've caused me nothing but trouble!"</p>

<p>Alt Sam grins as Brooke walks through the door. "Brooke's here!"</p>

<p>"Behave!"</p>

<p>"Hi Sam."</p>

<p>"Hi Brooke" Both Sams reply. Sam shoots her double a look. They look up as Bio Glass walks in, her customary scowl a permanent fixture on her face.</p>

<p>"Now that's one thing that hasn't changed. Bio Glass, charming as ever."</p>

<p>Sam snickers.</p>

<p>"What's so funny Sam?" Brooke whispers.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Oi! McMorons! Enough chatter." Bio Glass turns to the blackboard and begins writing, while Alt Sam takes the opportunity to lie down on the bench, staring dreamily up at Brooke.</p>

<p>Sam glares. "Would you sit properly please?"</p>

<p>"You're just jealous."</p>

<p>"Your legs are covering my notebook! I can't see"</p>

<p>"It's always whinge whinge whinge with you, isn't it Sam?"</p>

<p>Brooke and the rest of the class watch on perplexed, as Sam continues whispering to the bench. Bio Glass interrupts the one sided conversation.</p>

<p>"McPherson? Or should that be McMental? What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing ma'am, sir."</p>

<p>"Then stop talking to the air."</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am, sir."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sam walks by the cafeteria with Alt Sam in tow.</p>

<p>"Ah, the cafeteria."</p>

<p>"You sound like you actually miss the place."</p>

<p>"I do, though the food is another story. I always thought if anything would kill me, it'll be that."</p>

<p>"I don't know how you do it."</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Handle death so well."</p>

<p>"I'm used to it."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it hurt? Knowing all the things you'll be missing out on?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does! But shit happens! Maybe I didn't get the chance to live, but you can! It's why I'm here, following your stubborn ass!"</p>

<p>Sam enters the Novak, relieved it's empty. She still had trouble remembering that only she could see her twin which meant everybody had been shooting her weird looks all day. She turns toward the cause of her problems. </p>

<p>"I was doing fine without you."</p>

<p>"You were, were you? Tell me Sam, are you living?"</p>

<p>"What kind of question is that?"</p>

<p>"If I told you that you had ten seconds to live, how long a list would your regrets be? Exactly. You're not living. No one in this damn school is." She paused sadly. "Everybody hides! It's okay to be an individual just as long as everybody else is! We don't take risks and we don't do the things we want to just because somebody else might take exception to it! People don't live for themselves, they live according to how others think they should!" She turned to Sam. "I learnt it the hard way and I'm not going to stand by and watch you make the same mistake. Live a little!" </p>

<p>"And me telling Brooke how I feel is supposed to change that?"</p>

<p>"It's a start! Don't you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, but I don't want to get hurt!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't have to be about you!"</p>

<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>"I gave up my life to save her and I'd do it again without a second thought." </p>

<p>"What's your point?"</p>

<p>"Offering your heart to someone is one of the most courageous things you could ever do. What's even more selfless is offering it without any strings attached."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can do that."</p>

<p>"Most people can't which is why most people don't."</p>

<p>"In other words, you want me to tell Brooke that I love her."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Even if it means she might not feel the same way, or she might laugh in my face."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's insane."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"So what's the point?"</p>

<p>"I can imagine that if you decide to tell her, your heart would start thumping, your palms will be sweaty, your stomach will be churning and you'll probably feel like throwing up."</p>

<p>"And that's a good thing?"</p>

<p>"That's how you know you're living Sam."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 3">
<p>"Remind me why I'm here again?"</p>

<p>"Don't try and act all innocent! You want to see Brooke in her cheerleading uniform just as much as I do!"</p>

<p>"Whatever."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you insist on lying to me! Hello! I'm you!"</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not a host for your ghost, okay?!"</p>

<p>"Ha. Ha. Very funny."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"I hope I wasn't this annoying when I was alive."</p>

<p>"You're this annoying even when you're dead!"</p>

<p>Nicole stops her stretching exercises and stares strangely at Sam.</p>

<p>"B? I think Spam's spaz gene finally kicked in for good this time."</p>

<p>They watch on in silence as Sam talks animatedly to herself. </p>

<p>"She's being doing this for a while now."</p>

<p>"I vote we get her institutionalized as soon as possible and throw away the key."</p>

<p>Brooke glares at Nic. "Great help, thankyou." She walks over to Sam.</p>

<p>"Sam? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Perving, honey" Alt Sam replies with a leer, then turns to her double. "Doesn't she have great legs?" Sam shoots her a glare while Brooke watches on in confusion, waiting for Sam's answer.</p>

<p>"Nothing, just hanging around."</p>

<p>"You never watch me while I practice."</p>

<p>"First time for everything, right?"</p>

<p>"I guess."</p>

<p>"If my being here makes you uncomfortable, I can go."</p>

<p>"No, damn it!" Alt Sam cries out. "I wanna watch!"</p>

<p>Sam turns toward her with a glare. "Don't yell! I've got a headache already because of you!"</p>

<p>"We're not leaving!" Alt Sam replies stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Fine, just shut it!"</p>

<p>Brooke rubs her fingers with her temples then shakes her head. She places her hand on Sam's forehead, checking for a fever. "Sam, I'm really worried about you. I think I should take you to a doctor. Do you have a head injury or something?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine Brooke. It's just a little...complicated."</p>

<p>Nicole walks over. "Still talking to yourself, huh Spam? Even I didn't realise you were that desperate for friends."</p>

<p>"Hit the bitch Sam!" Alt Sam hisses with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Nicole, enough. Go, please" Brooke interrupts before Sam can respond.</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"Go. Now."</p>

<p>"That's my girl." Alt Sam grins proudly, sticking out her tongue at Nicole's retreating back.</p>

<p>Brooke turns towards Sam. "You sure you're okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Brooke, thanks."</p>

<p>Alt Sam suddenly stands up and throws her arms around Brooke. Sam can't help feeling touched at the scene and smiles gently. "I guess I'll see you at home."</p>

<p>Brooke offers a reluctant nod before she walks away. Alt Sam sits beside her sadly. "She didn't feel me. She didn't feel a thing." </p>

<p>"I'm sure she did" Sam offers sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't." Alt Sam stands up, clearly upset. "Can we go?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Dumping her school bag on the floor, Sam sprawls on the couch while alt Sam sits on the arm rest impatiently. "When is she coming home?"</p>

<p>"Soon. Normally we eat together at breakfast but sometimes Mum goes in to work early."</p>

<p>"I can't wait to see her again. I miss her."</p>

<p>"I know. Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"When you...died, did you see dad?"</p>

<p>"Sam, in my timeline, Dad never died. They got divorced."</p>

<p>"He's alive? Why did they get divorced?"</p>

<p>"They weren't in love anymore. Simple as that."</p>

<p>"Wow. What other differences can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Let's see. Lily isn't a vegetarian and she couldn't give a rats ass about any animal or environmental issues. She doesn't even recycle, the bitch!"</p>

<p>"You're kidding me!"</p>

<p>"Nope! What else...oh yeah, Josh is gay."</p>

<p>"The musical?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"So, if that is when he figured it out, does that mean Brooke and he didn't...you know?"</p>

<p>"She didn't lose her virginity to Josh, no."</p>

<p>"Who, then? Harrison?"</p>

<p>"No. Me."</p>

<p>"WHAAAAT?!" </p>

<p>"It happened one night."</p>

<p>"That's it? That's all you can say?"</p>

<p>"We were drunk and being silly and it just happened."</p>

<p>"And you didn't tell her how you felt?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?!"</p>

<p>"We were both stubborn and stupid and scared. We pretended it never happened."</p>

<p>"Jesus!"</p>

<p>"He's a nice guy."</p>

<p>"Would you stop that!"</p>

<p>"And you shouldn't use his name in vain. He doesn't like it."</p>

<p>"How can you...I can't believe this! You slept with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just that one night."</p>

<p>"How can you be so stupid?"</p>

<p>"I don't regret it. I mean, it wasn't exactly the most romantic of circumstances, but I don't care. It was the best night of my life."</p>

<p>"That's not what I mean! How could you not say anything to her?"</p>

<p>"For the very same reason you won't Sam."</p>

<p>"She slept with you! You don't just sleep with anybody!"</p>

<p>"Some people do."</p>

<p>"I'm talking about me! You! You and Brooke! We don't go around just fucking anyone we come across, no matter how drunk we are! There has to be some sort of emotional attachment. You know this! What did you need? A big fucking neon sign telling you that she loved you?"</p>

<p>"When you're scared, you can miss the obvious. Besides, don't get all high and mighty with me. I went for it and yes, it didn't work out the way I wanted, but at least I tried. Can you say the same thing Sam?"</p>

<p>"Don't preach to me!"</p>

<p>"And don't judge me! I screwed up, I know this, and it cost me my life. I think about this every fucking second, of every fucking day, and I don't need you shoving it down my throat, okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. This is just so wrong!"</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be here! You shouldn't be dead! You're sixteen, you should be alive and with Brooke and...it's just so wrong."</p>

<p>"Shit happens."</p>

<p>"That doesn't help, you know."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"What happened to Nicole? Is she in jail?"</p>

<p>"Hospital actually, under watch. She's attempted suicide three times."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Believe me, she feels bad about what she did."</p>

<p>"So she should!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I'm thinking once I'm done with you, I might see if I'm allowed to pay her a visit. Tell her, that it's okay."</p>

<p>"She took your life, your future! She doesn't deserve forgiveness!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but she's genuinely sorry for what she did. No one else needs to die over this mess and I'm not going to spend eternity in anger."</p>

<p>"Why not visit Brooke instead?"</p>

<p>"Brooke needs to accept my death. If I visit her, she's won't be able to do that. We'll be together again, one day."</p>

<p>"Does death do that to you?"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Make you wise?"</p>

<p>Alt Sam shrugs casually. "You get a new perspective on things." They both look up as Jane walks through the door. Alt Sam immediately begins to cry as she wraps her arms around Jane's waist. Sam stands up and stares at them momentarily before she too, envelopes Jane in a big hug.</p>

<p>"Not that I'm complaining Sam, but what's this for?" Jane asks puzzled, but obviously pleased with Sam's unexpected greeting.</p>

<p>Sam smiles. "Just because."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sam wakes up and looks around to find Alt Sam has disappeared. Wondering where she could have possibly gotten to, she smiles and heads straight into Brooke's bedroom, to find Alt Sam sitting on the bed, watching Brooke sleep.</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to wake you."</p>

<p>"You didn't. It's 4 in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ghosts don't need sleep."</p>

<p>"I guess not. How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"A while. I don't know."</p>

<p>"Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to sound insensitive or anything, but why can't you do this with your own Brooke?"</p>

<p>"She's not the only one who needs to accept my death."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"I watch over the people I care about, but not like this. Not so personally."</p>

<p>"If you did, you'd never leave."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"You're saying goodbye to her. You're leaving me aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm needed elsewhere and besides, I'm getting too attached. It's easier to look over a Sam who isn't so much like me."</p>

<p>"Like the guy Sam or the Sam from Australia?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Does the aussie Sam say G'day mate?"</p>

<p>"No, she doesn't and she doesn't say "Crikey!" and they don't have kangaroos as pets, okay?"</p>

<p>"Just asking!"</p>

<p>"You are the most frustrating Sam I've ever met!"</p>

<p>"What can I say, it's a gift."</p>

<p>"Haven't I taught you anything while I've been haunting you?"</p>

<p>"More than you know."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that something has penetrated that thick head of yours."</p>

<p>"It has."</p>

<p>"Good." </p>

<p>"I must admit, if I'm anything like you, I'm a pretty cool person."</p>

<p>"And don't let anyone say anything different! We McPhersons rock!"</p>

<p>"Damn straight! Well...sort of."</p>

<p>They share a laugh. Alt Sam places a gentle kiss on Brooke's lips before she turns towards Sam and hugs her tightly.</p>

<p>"Good luck Sam. With everything."</p>

<p>"Aren't you disappointed?"</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"That I won't tell her."</p>

<p>"You will. When you're ready."</p>

<p>"How can you be so sure?"</p>

<p>"Because you don't want to end up like me."</p>

<p>"What? Dead?"</p>

<p>"No, brainfreeze! You don't want to live a life of "what ifs."</p>

<p>"And if she doesn't love me back?"</p>

<p>"You move on and find someone who will. We McPhersons are pretty easy to love."</p>

<p>"Simple as that, huh?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't, but it shouldn't stop you from trying."</p>

<p>"Okay. I'll think about it."</p>

<p>"That's all I ask. Besides, she might tell you first."</p>

<p>"I'll keep dreaming."</p>

<p>Alt Sam places a kiss on her cheek before she fades away.</p>

<p>"You do that, and don't ever let go." </p>
