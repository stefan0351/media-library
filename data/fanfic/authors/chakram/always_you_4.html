<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 4 -->

<p>Brooke wandered into the living room, drink in hand. She contemplated giving Nicole a call, but decided against it, not really in the mood for company. She settled herself comfortably on the couch, when the doorbell rang.</p>
		<p><i>Of course.</i></p>
		<p>"Hi Brooke".</p>
		<p><i>Grrrrrrrr.</i></p>
		<p>"Hi Adam".</p>
		<p>"Alex".</p>
		<p>"Alex, right. Sorry. Come on in. Have a seat. I'll let Sam know you're here". </p>
		<p>Alex sat down gingerly, not feeling at all comfortable being alone with Brooke. He had the distinct feeling that she did not like him and he couldn't imagine what he had said or done to offend her. <i>Do I smell? </i></p>
		<p>"SAM! YOUR DATE IS HERE!" Brooke yelled, causing Alex to jump three feet in the air.</p>
		<p>"She should be down soon. Drink?" Brooke asked. Yes, he was taking away the love of her life but it didn't mean she had to be totally rude.</p>
		<p>"No thankyou." </p>
		<p>"Suit yourself". And with that, Brooke sat down and focused her attention on the screen. </p>
		<p>Alex kept glancing towards the stairs, praying that Sam would come down so they could leave quickly. The atmosphere was tense and akward and frankly he wasn't used to this. Girls usually jumped him, not ignored him. </p>
		<p><i>Hurry up, Sam!</i></p>
		<p>Brooke suddenly spoke up. "So, where are you taking her?"</p>
		<p>"McDonald's". Alex grinned, hoping that  a small joke, and his dimples, would diffuse the situation.</p>
		<p>Brooke stared. Alex cringed. <i>Oooo. Tough crowd.</i></p>
		<p>Alex cleared his throat. "Just kidding. Um, there's a nice new Italian restaurant that has opened downtown. Supposed to be great from what I've heard."</p>
		<p><i>Damn. Sam loves Italian! Annoying, nice, handsome guy!</i></p>
		<p>"I'm sure it is."</p>
		<p>As Brooke once again ignored him, Alex discreetly studied the blonde cheerleader. <i>She is beautiful. And, hey! We sort of look alike!</i></p>
		<p>"Alex. Hi."</p>
		<p>Both Alex and Brooke turned to see Sam standing at the foot of the stairs, a sheepish smile on her face. </p>
		<p>"Sorry, I took so long".</p>
		<p>"It's okay. You look beautiful."  Brooke shot him a dark look. <i>A bloody understatement, Adam!</i></p>
		<p>"Thankyou. You don't look half bad yourself. Should we get going?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, please. I mean, sure, whenever you're ready."</p>
		<p>Sam turned to Brooke and noticed her slumped shoulders. She was still worried about the blonde and felt bad about leaving her here on her own. </p>
		<p>"You know, you are most welcome to join us". </p>
		<p>A look of horror was quickly masked by a small smile from Alex. </p>
		<p>"Of course." <i>No! No! No!</i></p>
		<p>Brooke smiled at Sam's thoughtfulness and chuckled at Alex's discomfort. </p>
		<p>"Thanks Sam, but you know what they say. Three's a crowd." She turned to Alex. "Take a walk".</p>
		<p>Sam laughed while Alex plastered a smile on his face, struggling to fight the urge to slap the blonde. Brooke smirked.</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine. Go on and have some fun".</p>
		<p>"You sure?" </p>
		<p>"I'm sure, thanks Sam".</p>
		<p>"Okay. Call me if you need anything." </p>
		<p>With an arm around her waist, Alex shot the cheerleader a less than friendly glance and guided Sam out the door. </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>It wasn't too long after Sam and Alex had left that the doorbell rung, waking Brooke up from her slumber on the couch. <i>Why is it that whenever I get comfortable, somebody has to make me get up!</i></p>
		<p>"Josh?"</p>
		<p>"Hi Brooke".</p>
		<p>"Not that I'm not happy to see you, but what the hell are you doing here?"</p>
		<p>"I was passing by, saw your light on". He smiled.</p>
		<p>Brooke stared. Josh shifted uncomfortably.</p>
		<p>"We haven't had the chance to talk much, so I thought I'd come by and catch up."</p>
		<p>Brooke stared. <i>He's lying, his ears go red when he is lying.</i></p>
		<p>"Okay! Okay! Sam called me and said that you were feeling down and if I minded keeping you company for a little while. So here I am."</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed. </p>
		<p>"Come on in."</p>
		<p>"So, want to tell me what's up?"</p>
		<p>"Not really".</p>
		<p>"Come on Brooke. I know that things between us didn't work out but I'm still you're friend and I care about you. Talk to me."</p>
		<p>"Josh, I appreciate you coming over, and checking up on me, but I'll be fine. It might take a little while (<i>More like a lifetime</i>, Brooke thought) but it'll be okay in the end."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh. So where is Sam anyway?"</p>
		<p>"Out on a date". It didn't go unnoticed by Josh that Brooke practically spat out the words.</p>
		<p>"I see."</p>
		<p>They sat in comfortable silence for a while, staring at the television but not paying much attention to it, both lost in their own thoughts.</p>
		<p>"You're in love with Sam".</p>
		<p>Brooke froze. <i>Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! How does he know! Stay calm, Brooke and just simply deny it.</i></p>
		<p>"Am not." <i>Good one, Brookie! That's telling him. </i></p>
		<p>"Are too".</p>
		<p>"Am not"</p>
		<p>"Are too."</p>
		<p>"Am not".</p>
		<p>"Are too."</p>
		<p>"Tell me Josh, did the football hit you in the head at training today, disrupting your logical thought processes?"</p>
		<p>Josh stared at her. "Are too", he finally replied.</p>
		<p>They glared at each other. </p>
		<p>"Don't deny it Brooke! I'm not just a dumb jock despite popular belief! I've got eyes and if there is one thing I know in this world, it's you. And you, are in love with Sam".</p>
		<p>Brooke opened her mouth to deny it but stopped. She fought back tears and after a long moment of debating with herself, she came to a decision.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. I am".</p>
		<p><i>So I was right. </i>Josh expected to feel great pain at Brooke's admission but realised that it wasn't as bad as he thought it would be. He knew that she never felt for him the way he felt for her, but had always held the hope that one day it would all work out. </p>
		<p><i>I guess not. </i>He paused. <i>And I think I'm okay with that. </i></p>
		<p>She glanced up at him, a look of confusion on her face. </p>
		<p>"How did you know? I didn't think it was that obvious".</p>
		<p>"It isn't".</p>
		<p>"So how did you know?"</p>
		<p>"It was a little while ago. I noticed that you were staring at Sam with this look on your face. I remember thinking to myself that I hoped that one day, you would look at me the same way. And it hit me then, why we never worked out. I realised it was her all along. It's always been her."</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry Josh. I never meant to hurt you". Brooke felt genuinely bad.</p>
		<p>"It's okay Brooke. I guess I knew deep down that we were never going to work out. I'm just glad I had you for a little while". He smiled at her.</p>
		<p>Brooke grinned at him, her first true smile for the day.  "You're a great guy, Josh".</p>
		<p>He blushed, then blushed even more when he realised that he was blushing. Brooke laughed.</p>
		<p>"Yes, well, I try." He grinned at her then became serious. "You going to tell her?"</p>
		<p>"Hell no! Are you insane?"</p>
		<p>"Why not?"</p>
		<p>"Gee! Let me count the ways! She's my stepsister, she's straight, we can barely tolerate each other's presence for long periods of time and she is currently on a date with some guy!"</p>
		<p>"Who happens to look like you".</p>
		<p>"So what? That doesn't mean anything!"</p>
		<p>"In all the time I've known her, she's barely shown zero interest in any guy that she's ever come across! Now, all of a sudden, a good looking guy, whose tall and blonde with hazel eyes, comes along and she starts dating him! Doesn't that sound a little weird to you?!"</p>
		<p>"No." Brooke replied, unconvincingly.</p>
		<p>"In fact, the only person she's ever shown genuine interest in, is you."</p>
		<p>"That's because we fight all the time".</p>
		<p>"You know what they say. There's a thin line between love and hate." He paused. "Maybe I should've started calling you names and arguing with you. We might have stood a chance then".</p>
		<p>He ducked as Brooke threw a pillow at him. "Smart ass." She smiled.</p>
		<p>He laughed.</p>
