<p>I was really getting tired of playing mediator to Xander and
Cordelia's little spats. I didn't even know how I got dragged into
the role in the first place but there I was again that morning, stuck
in between the two of them as they sniped at each other about their
latest bone of contention which I couldn't even remember now, a half
hour later. I think if I asked them, they wouldn't remember either.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I wondered what it was that was holding them together as a
couple. A few seconds after that, I'd remind myself it was none of my
business even though they were pulling me into their business every
time they argued. But their arguments always ended up with them
making up so I wasn't too worried that morning when they had another
spat.</p>

<p>Xander had dragged me out of my own house to cool off which took a
couple of blocks. Usually when he was in that mood, he just needed
someone to sound off on and, aside from a few well placed "yeah's"
and "uh-huh's", I didn't really have to say too much. </p>

<p>The first thing he did when we got back home was to call out to
Cordelia who came rushing out of the kitchen to meet him. That was
weird though because, usually, she'd act aloof, waiting for him to
apologize or make the first move. Instead, she smiled when she saw us
and pulled him out of the house before I even got a few steps inside.
I was left standing inside the front door, wondering what had just
happened when Faith walked out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hey," she said, giving me a tenuous smile.</p>

<p>"Hey," I said back, giving her an equally tenuous smile. And that
pretty much sums up what it's been like between us for the past week -
-- awkward, tense, polite to the point of rudeness ... does that even
make sense?</p>

<p>We stood there, silent and unsure. I was just trying not to fidget
when she gave me a last wan smile and went into the living room. As
soon as she did, I leaned against the wall next to me and bumped my
forehead against the smooth surface.</p>

<p>Strangers.</p>

<p>That's what we had turned into. Strangers that just happened to live
in the same house together, that just happened to sit across from
each other at dinner every night, that just happened to have been
lovers, and that just happened to still love each other after
everything that had happened.</p>

<p>Strangers.</p>

<p>The word was like a curse, making me feel hollow and empty. I pushed
off of the wall, stopping by the kitchen for some soda before walking
towards the living room, hesitating only a second before moving to
sit on the couch next to Faith. The TV was on, tuned into a local
news report that was talking about the weather forecast for the next
five days.</p>

<p>"So what's with Xander and Cordy?" She asked, surprising me so much
so that I almost spit out the sip of soda I'd taken. It wasn't the
question that surprised me so much as that she'd actually said
something without me asking something first.</p>

<p>"They had their usual weekly argument," I said, composing
myself. "What else is new?" I hadn't intended to sound so callous
about it but when it's just one after another and you keep finding
yourself dragged into the middle, it just wears a little thin after a
while.</p>

<p>But I wondered why she would bring it up at all. Maybe Cordelia had
mentioned it to her just now since Faith had never shown much
interest in their rocky relationship before. Sometimes, I even
thought she got a kick out of seeing them trading barbs back and
forth.</p>

<p>I glanced over at her to see what she was thinking about and saw a
faraway look in her eyes. "Faith?" I called out, getting her
attention back.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she said, suddenly looking like she'd been caught doing
something wrong. And then the sneaking suspicion I'd had ever since
I'd walked through the front door and seen Cordelia almost running
out of the kitchen began to swallow me whole. I saw the knowledge
come into her eyes just as it flared in my mind. I didn't have to say
anything for the question to pass between us so I waited grimly for
her answer because I knew I wouldn't like what she had to say.</p>

<p>"Nothing much happened," she said calmly although she wouldn't look
me directly in the eyes while she was saying it. "We just kissed ...
one little kiss. It just happened."</p>

<p>"It just happened?" I repeated dully to myself, trying to wrap my
mouth around those bitter words. And then the resentment that had
built up during all those weeks I'd been made to feel like the bad
guy in the relationship after I'd kissed Angel boiled over. "How the
hell can you say that to me with a straight face?!" I yelled. "Is
this your twisted way of getting back at me for what I did?"</p>

<p>"Tit for tat," she answered with a hollow look in her eyes as a sneer
came over her lips. "The way I see it, we're even now."</p>

<p>And right then, I wanted nothing more than to slap that expression
from her face, slap her until she realized how not right things had
turned out. It was almost like somewhere along the way, someone had
turned off all the lights and we were shuffling around blind,
pretending like we weren't bumping into things every other step and
hoping that someone would come help us.</p>

<p>I looked at her, disgusted. "Was that how you saw this? As a way to
get back at me?"</p>

<p>"Unlike what you might think," she said. "Not everything's about you,
B. The whole fucking universe doesn't revolve around you and I didn't
go in kissing Cordy to prove some point to you. But you can't really
throw it back in my face without looking like some kind of hypocrite,
now can you?" </p>

<p>"I don't even know you anymore," I said, squeezing the words from my
throat as I stood up. But apparently, she hadn't finished yet either
because she stood up too, standing in my way so I couldn't move past
her.</p>

<p>"And what the fuck is that supposed to mean?" She asked, hotly, her
face inches from mine. "So, when you kiss someone, I'm just supposed
to shut my eyes and forgive you but when I kiss someone, you get on
your goddamn high horse and stare down your nose at me like I'm lower
than shit?"</p>

<p>"I never kissed Angel --- he kissed me. There's a difference."</p>

<p>"Not to me there isn't. So tell me how you feel now, B. Do you feel
like your heart's been ripped out, squeezed dry and then shoved back
down your own throat?" She cracked a humorless smile, looking me up
and down with contempt. "If you do then you have a little sample of
what I've been feeling for the last couple of weeks. Cause whatever
lame excuses we come up with, whatever words we use to try and
explain things away, it doesn't matter for shit in the end cause we
both hurt each other. We can't fucking change that."</p>

<p>I felt tired all of a sudden. All the energy sucked out by the weight
of what had happened and what might yet happen. I slumped back onto
the couch, closing my eyes and welcoming the darkness that
immediately surrounded me. After what seemed like forever but was
probably more like a few minutes, I felt something warm touching the
inside of my thigh.</p>

<p>My eyes slid open, watching Faith who was crouched on the floor
between my legs, her hand so hot, it was scorching where it was
touching my thigh. As soon as I saw her eyes, lit behind with
something so primal that it literally took my breath away, I
instinctively reached out, pulling her closer. Running my hands
through her hair in nothing so much as a rough gesture that let us
both know that nothing was forgiven, I closed the space between us,
crushing our lips together in a kiss brutal enough to draw blood.</p>

<p>She rose up onto the couch, her knee starting to dig into my crotch,
making me gasp into her mouth. I pulled her in closer, needing to
feel her skin against mine, needing to feel the familiar burn running
through my body when I touched her.</p>

<p>"Buffy?!" Shit.</p>

<p>"MOM!"</p>

<p>Faith shot to her feet, a panicked expression on her face, leaving me
sitting on the couch and looking over at my mom who was standing at
the doorway, her hand fluttering over her chest like some kind of
heroine in a cheesy romance novel. "Wh--what are you doing here?" I
asked, stalling for time as my mind raced with all the possible
excuses I could give her for what she'd seen.</p>

<p>"I needed to get some pictures I'd forgotten." She shook her head as
if to get her focus back on track. "What ... what was going on here?"
She asked, gesturing vaguely between us.</p>

<p>I looked over at Faith who was looking at me, her eyes as wide as
saucers. I looked back at mom who had the same look in her eyes and
was staring at me just as intently. "I ... *we* were kind of ...
kissing?" It came out sounding like I was ashamed of what we'd done,
that we'd been caught doing something dirty when that was the
furthest thing from the truth.</p>

<p>"When ... how ...?" I don't think she knew what to ask. If I were in
her position, I don't think I would know either. But before I could
even begin to diffuse the situation, the phone rang, making all three
of us jump up a little. It continued ringing, grating on every one of
my nerves until I finally walked over and picked it up since no one
else seemed inclined to move.</p>

<p>"Hello?" I asked, the strain of the situation making me snap out the
greeting.</p>

<p>"Um ... hello? Buffy? This is Giles."</p>

<p>"Can this wait?" I asked, my eyes flitting between my mom and Faith,
both of whom still looked like they were frozen to their respective
spots. "I kind of have a situation here."</p>

<p>"I don't think it can Buffy," he answered. And for the first time, I
finally noticed the tension running through his own voice. "I think
it would be a very good idea if you and Faith come down to the
library right away. It actually concerns her more than you."</p>

<p>"All right," I said, wondering how I could get away from mom without
giving her the real reason why I had to leave. "We'll be right
there." I hung up as mom looked at me expectantly. "We have to go."</p>

<p>"Go?" she asked, her eyebrows hiking up into her hairline. I grabbed
Faith by the arm, pulling her towards the front door. "Buffy? Faith?
Where are you going? I want to sit down and talk to you both about
this."</p>

<p>"We'll be right back," I promised. "We just have to go to the library
first --- overdue books, y'know?" </p>

<p>I hope she bought that. </p>

<p>I hope she even bought half of that.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God --" Buffy had been
mumbling that over and over since we'd walked out of the house and I
don't even think she knew she was doing it.</p>

<p>"B, I don't think God's gonna help us with this one," I said, cutting
her off around her hundredth 'Oh God'.</p>

<p>"What?" She looked at me blankly and then shook her head. "Did she
look mad to you? Don't answer that. She probably is." She groaned,
looking heavenward as if that would bring about her salvation or
something. "This is like some bad made for TV movie of the week.
Could she have found out in a worse possible way?" </p>

<p>"We could have had our clothes off." Somehow, my little joke didn't
go over so well.</p>

<p>"We practically did," she moaned, a horrified expression on her
face. "If she'd come in a few minutes later ... Faith, my mom would
have seen us naked." She actually shuddered at the thought and I
couldn't say it didn't send a shiver down my own spine too.</p>

<p>"Hey, c'mere," I said, making up my mind to do something about this
right now. I wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her to a
stop. "So what do you want to do, B? We both know it hasn't been
going too well lately. It hasn't since --- fuck, I don't want to get
into that again but now's the time for *you* to tell me what you
want."</p>

<p>"What do I want?" She asked as if asking herself the same question.
Looking at me in that way she has which always makes me feel like I
was burning up all over, she wrapped her arms around my neck. "I want
you, Faith. Forget everything else --- forget about everyone for a
second. Let's just pretend it's just us. Me and you, Faith. I can't
get over you because I don't want to."</p>

<p>A tiny smile flitted around the corners of her mouth, waiting
patiently for me to make my decision. I took a deep breath, saying
something I knew I should've done awhile ago if only I weren't being
such a total moron. "So, uh, I'm sorry about being such a total bitch
before," I apologized, my eyes staring down somewhere around her
neck. "It's not that I don't trust you, B. I know you love me." I
looked up, drawn into her eyes again which looked like two shimmering
pools of warm green. "You do love me, right?" I asked, suddenly
feeling the doubts creep in. As she nodded, I continued. "It's just
that ... I have a hard time believing that someone like you could
love someone like me. And it scares the living shit out of me that
you'll finally realize that sometime down the road and leave me. I
couldn't take it, B."</p>

<p>She placed a gentle hand on my cheek. "So you'll live your whole life
scared?" She asked, a sadness in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't want to," I whispered, my voice strained, almost to the
point of cracking. "I just don't know how to stop myself."</p>

<p>"Believe in *us*, Faith," She said, pulling me closer like she was
trying to protect me from myself. "It's that simple."</p>

<p>I barked out a laugh as she looked at me through her lashes. "This is
me you're talking to, B. Nothing with me is that simple ... but I
guess that's what I'll have to do if I don't want to mess this up."</p>

<p>"I guess that's what you'll have to do," she repeated, moving so
close that I thought I could almost hear her heartbeat starting to
increase. "And I guess I'll have to be there to remind you every so
often." </p>

<p>I watched in amazement as a grin started to form on her face, not
that I hadn't seen it often enough, just that every time I saw it,
something inside me just melted. A simple smile, a touch, a look. No
one made me feel like this besides Buffy and as I closed that final
distance between us, I knew in my heart, she felt the same way about
me --- she told me often enough and I think it was finally starting
to sink in. </p>

<p>We pulled apart only cause we were standing in the middle of the
sidewalk and some people were starting to walk around us. "Mom will
understand ... I hope," she added as we continued walking towards the
school. Unlike Buffy, I wasn't that worried about mom. Mrs. Summers
was a pretty understanding woman --- she adopted me when nobody else
wanted to and that ranks high on my list. But I did have to wonder if
she regretted it now. I really hope not cause to me, Joyce *is* my
mom and I need her in my life.</p>

<p>Buffy's hand reached for mine and we held onto each other. It was one
of those things that just feels *right*, so natural that it happens
even when you're not aware of it and if you don't do it, you feel
like you're missing out on something. We walked in a comfortable
silence until we got to the library.</p>

<p>"--usually very prompt. I'm sure... " </p>

<p>Giles' voice trailed off as Buffy and me walked through the swinging
doors. He looked almost relieved as he glanced back at the woman he'd
been talking to before we came in.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Buffy asked, stopping in front of the two of
them. "What's the big emergency? If it's not about some big demon
bent on the total annihilation of the human race or something equally
important for you to pull me away from a family situation that was
just about to blow up, you'll have two pissed off Slayers on your
hands."</p>

<p>Giles got really red in the face as he took off his glasses and began
cleaning them. I think if he rubbed any harder, the lenses would pop
out. The woman began looking me and B over and there was something in
her eyes that I didn't like. It was the same look that told you the
person looking was just wondering how to screw you over. She spoke up
then with this accent that sounded even more English than Giles ---
something I never thought I'd be able to say.</p>

<p>"I presume you two are the Slayers," she said, her eyebrow cocking
and her arms folded behind her back like some kind of wannabe school
teacher about to start lecturing ... two things I can't stand right
off the bat.</p>

<p>"What's it to you?" I asked, getting into what Buffy would call my
defensive mode which meant I was gonna give nothing but lip.</p>

<p>"My name is Gwendolyn Post," she said, totally ignoring my
attitude. "I was sent from the Watcher's Council to be your new
watcher, Faith. And from what I've seen so far ... " She aimed a
little sneer at Giles that wasn't missed by anybody. "I couldn't have
come at a better time. From what I've been able to gather from Mr.
Giles, summers in Sunnydale are unusually idle in terms of demon
activity so we'll have plenty of time to work on undoing the
substandard training you've been exposed to so far."</p>

<p>"Wait, what gives you the right to march in here and ... give orders
and start training?" Buffy asked, clearly bristling at the dig at
Giles.</p>

<p>"The Council gives me that right," she said with a supremely cocky
attitude. </p>

<p>I looked over at Giles, hoping he'd tell her something different but
he gave me nothing to work with. "If the Council thinks it's
appropriate for a second Watcher to be assigned ... it would be best
if we cooperate," he ended lamely, starting to fold his arms but then
lowering them to his side again. I'd always thought of Giles as some
kind of super research guy --- cute and nerdy, not always calm but
definitely always in control. But now he was getting his cage rattled
big time.</p>

<p>"Let's go, Faith," Post said, grabbing her jacket from the back of a
chair and brushing past me to walk to the door. I took one last look
at both Giles and Buffy before following her out the door. If she
turned out to be a total uber bitch, I could always just walk away. I
mean, what the fuck could she do to me? Put me on probation? Yeah
right. She needed me more than I needed her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Giles suggested the gym as the most optimal place to train," she
said as I followed her down the hall. And even her walk looked like
someone had rammed a rod straight up her ass. Fuck, you'd think the
Council had a required class to teach that trait to all its Watchers
cause even Giles had some of that stiff English 101 in him --- not as
much but still ...</p>

<p>I've gotta say this much for her though--- her idea of training is
about a hundred times tougher than what Giles usually puts me through
so by the time she called a stop to it, I was about ready to fall
down, dead. "I think that's about as much as you can take today," she
said, coming over to stand in front of me. "Not as bad as I thought
but you can use improvement."</p>

<p>"Yeah, thanks," I said as sarcastically as I could sucking in air
like a friggin Hoover. I would've told her to go screw herself but
some small part of me liked it --- not her exactly but her style. No
nonsense, tells you straight out when you're not giving a hundred and
ten percent and a split second before you're ready to throw down, she
gives you that little bit of praise that makes you think that, hey,
maybe the pain was worth it after all. At least to me it does. </p>

<p>"I was going to share this information with Mr. Giles but I think
this will prove to be a valuable training exercise," she continued,
handing me a towel. "Plus, if you succeed, I'll have something
positive to report to the Council ... that Miss Summers isn't the
only capable Slayer in this town."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? Me and B are a team."</p>

<p>She looked at me as if pitying a dog that had gone lame. "I know you
think that," she said, her voice going soft. "But other people ...
they only see you as an accident. A back up to the one true Slayer.
Expendable. But we're going to prove them wrong, aren't we Faith?"</p>

<p>I tried pretending like her words didn't matter to me but I could
feel it fucking with my head already. Being second best and a
fallback girl weren't exactly the labels I wanted tacked onto my back
even if it was Buffy standing in front of me. "What do you want me to
do?" I asked, watching the smile creeping across her face.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of a Demon named Lagos?" </p>

<p>It might've been the blank stare on my face that tipped her off as to
my total and complete lack of knowing. So she went on to tell me how
Lagos was here in Sunnydale looking for some Glove that would make
him powerful and shit. Whatever. All I needed to know was that Glove
+ Lagos = Bad fucking news. So I didn't gripe when she suggested I go
hunt around the graveyards that night to try to find this Glove
before Lagos did.</p>

<p>Buffy found me just after I left Post and right before I was going to
run a patrol. She seemed real pissed off about something and I didn't
need to guess what it was that had set her off either cause the first
words out of her mouth were, "Can you believe what that Mary Poppins
said to Giles? It got him so rattled that he's actually having me do
extra training. Like there's going to be anything happening anyway."</p>

<p>"She's just doing her job," I muttered, walking out of the school's
door with her.</p>

<p>"You sound like you're defending her. Did she brainwash you or
something?"</p>

<p>"Fuck it, no," I said, getting irritated over all of the stupid
questions she was asking. "Look, the way she treated G-man wasn't
right but she just got here and she's trying to get the hang of it.
So just cut her a break, okay?"</p>

<p>"All right. I'm sorry," she said, touching me lightly on the arm. "I
didn't know you felt that way, Faith. I promise I'll try and cut her
some slack from now on, okay?" She smiled at me, apologetic and
sweet, melting the anger building inside.</p>

<p>"You wanna meet at the Bronze later?" I asked, returning her
smile. "I've been itching with cabin fever lately and anyway, I miss
dancing with you." I said in that husky voice I know turns her on and
I wasn't surprised to see the faint blush spreading across her cheeks
in the dimming light. "After that, we can go home and tell your mom
everything. But I'd just like to have some kickass fun before facing
the music. What d'ya say?" </p>

<p>"All right," she said, giving me a good-bye kiss that gave me some
extra motivation to get the patrol over and done with. I left her, my
fingers trailing down her chest and made a turn to the right. If I
was lucky, I'd find this Glove tonight and still have plenty of time
left over to melt the dance floor with Buffy.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Oh, not again!" I couldn't hear my own shout as Faith threw Angel
onto a low slung table, causing it to splinter with a resounding
crack. Xander had come running into the Bronze earlier, telling me
he'd spotted them trying to tear each other apart. And, of course,
I'd immediately followed him back to the mansion Angel had moved into
a couple of weeks ago where the scene of them pounding on each other
had immediately greeted my eyes.</p>

<p>I ran over, pushing Faith firmly out of the way. "Stop!" I shouted,
putting one hand in front of me to ward her off as I gestured for
Angel to stay down with the other hand. "What the hell are you
doing?" I asked, not trying to temper any of the anger I felt.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask him?" Faith asked just as hotly, her fists
clenching tightly at her sides. I looked at Angel, keeping an eye on
Faith who still looked like she wanted to kill him.</p>

<p>"She was trying to take the Glove of Myhnegon," he said tersely,
staring reproachfully at her.</p>

<p>"Wait," I said, stopping him. "What Glove?"</p>

<p>"It's some power boosting gadget," Faith irritably interjected. "But
that's the fucking point. Can we really trust a fucking vampire to be
holding this big power in his hands?"</p>

<p>I gave her another look which made her snap her mouth shut. "Angel?"
I said, giving him the verbal go ahead to explain what was going on.
He got to his feet, brushing the tiny shards of wood off his clothes.
Faith visibly tensed but didn't try to make another move. </p>

<p>"I got it from a source that Lagos was in town hunting for the Glove.
I just happened to know where it was before he did so I took it."</p>

<p>"Give it to me?" I asked, directing the question to him as I walked
over to Faith. The situation momentarily diffused as far as I could
tell, I placed a hand on her arm which was still tense. "Faith?
What's going on?"</p>

<p>She looked at me, some strange amalgamation of resentment and apology
swirling around the brown depths of her eyes. And without answering,
she turned, walking out the door past Xander who I had completely
forgotten had been standing there the whole time in the first place.</p>

<p>"Xander," I said, getting his attention. "Take the Glove and get it
over to Giles, okay? We'll deal with it in the morning." I barely
waited for him to nod before taking off out the door. Standing in the
courtyard, I wasn't sure which way Faith had gone but I just let my
instincts take over, guiding my feet down one street after another
until I saw the familiar shadowy form walking in the distance. I ran
up to her, not calling out because I didn't think she'd stop. Quite
the opposite, she'd probably run. </p>

<p>Grabbing her arm and spinning her around, I asked again, "What is
going on?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think anything's wrong?" She asked with a smirk and then
said in a mocking way, "There's nothing more to fear when Super B's
here."</p>

<p>"Why are you saying this?" I asked, desperately trying to make sense
of what was happening even as everything seemed to pass me by too
fast. "Faith?" I said, the simple word entreating her to open up.</p>

<p>Her eyes softened by degrees. "I'm sorry ... it's just my head ---
it's all fucked up." She bit out a frustrated grunt as she took me by
the shoulders, her hands wrapping behind my neck as she placed her
forehead against mine. "The Glove," she whispered. "Post was telling
me how I had to get it cause I needed to show the Council guys I
wasn't just some second string backup who couldn't pull her own
weight."</p>

<p>"No --" I tried to tell her that that was a lot of bull but she
kissed me, abruptly cutting me off. It was more as a comfort than a
passionate outlet and as she pulled away, I hugged her, resting my
head against her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I know it's all a load of crap," she continued in a soft
voice. "Hell, I knew it as soon as she said that stuff but some of it
got to me anyway. And when I saw Angel with the Glove ... it was just
easier to blame him, y'know?"</p>

<p>"There's something wrong about her and it's not just because I don't
like her," I said, pulling away so I could look at her. </p>

<p>"I know," she nodded. "But can we just deal with this in the morning?
I think I've been pulled around by the nose enough for one night."</p>

<p>"Yeah, the Glove's not going anywhere. I sent Xander to take it to
Giles for now." I hesitated, hating to bring it up right when she
thought it was over but ... "There's also mom to deal with." Before I
even got the last syllable out, she groaned out loud, throwing her
head back and staring up into the sky. </p>

<p>"Fuck," I heard her mutter, eventually lowering her head to look at
me again. "We are so fucked," she said and I couldn't argue that. </p>

<p>We walked back to the house, neither one of us really going that fast
but sooner than I wanted, we were standing in front of the front
door, debating which one of us would actually go in first. But we
didn't have to worry about that because the door suddenly jerked open
with mom staring at us from the other side. </p>

<p>"Where were you two?" She asked, clearly seething. I opened my mouth
to answer but she held up a hand, stopping the words in my
mouth. "Get in." She stepped aside, letting us both go in, our heads
bowed as we sat down on the sofa. She came to stand in front of us,
her arms folded across her chest. I couldn't tell what she was
feeling from her face because I absolutely refused to look above her
chin but even her chin looked kind of angry.</p>

<p>"I don't even want to know where you've been for the last five
hours," she finally said after being silent for a few
minutes. "Because that's not really what's concerning me right
now ... How long has this been going on?"</p>

<p>The leather squeaked as Faith squirmed in her seat next to me. "Since
last summer," she answered, her voice surprisingly steady as she
glanced over at me before her eyes settled on mom. "A little while
before I got dragged away."</p>

<p>Mom didn't say anything for a moment as she looked intently at Faith
but then she closed her eyes, one hand going up to rub at the spot
right between her eyes. "Why didn't you tell me?" She asked, her
voice fainter than it had been a minute before.</p>

<p>"We weren't sure how you'd react," I said, feeling suddenly guilty
for the deception.</p>

<p>"So you didn't tell anyone else?" </p>

<p>Again, I felt like burying my head in the sofa cushions or better yet
Faith's shoulder. "Well ... " I hesitated as she looked at me, an
expression of dread crossing her face. "Everybody else kind of knows
already." </p>

<p>She sighed, looking back and forth between the two of us as if trying
to come to some sort of decision. "There's really nothing I can do,"
she finally said as if the realization was just now dawning on
her. "I don't ... it's just that I've never ... " She struggled
trying to find the right words. "You haven't ... have you?" We both
tried looking anywhere but at her and she gave a little whimper,
covering her mouth with one hand. </p>

<p>A tense silence blanketed all three of us before being broken by
Faith. "I love Buffy," she said, directing the statement at both mom
and me. "I can't help it. My life wouldn't be worth living without
her because she's the best thing in it. Please understand that," she
pleaded, looking at mom with an utterly heartbreaking expression,
waiting for her to say something.</p>

<p>"There's going to be some new ground rules from now on," mom said,
her arms dropping to her sides in resignation. I turned to Faith,
watching as a grin started splitting her face --- the same one which
was probably being mirrored in mine. Mom was actually okay with this,
with 'us'. I couldn't believe it had been so easy ... that was until
she actually detailed the ground rules which included, among other
things, no more sleeping in the same room together at night.</p>

<p>"But mom -- " I said starting to complain. But the look in her eyes
made me think better of it and instead, I ended up sulking about it
in silence. When she was done listing what we could and could not do
from now on, she blew out a sigh and stated that she was going off to
bed because the conversation we'd just had had tired her out more
than an eighty hour work week could ever do, accompanying the
statement with a wan smile that took most of the sting out of it.</p>

<p>That finally left me and Faith alone in the living room and I
immediately laid down, resting my head in her lap as soon as mom
disappeared up the stairs. Her fingers stroked my hair in a gesture
that soothed me to my core and I closed my eyes, just enjoying this
private moment together.</p>

<p>"It went a hell of a lot better than I expected," I heard her say,
the smile in her voice apparent as it floated down to my ears. </p>

<p>"I know but did she have to lay down those rules?" I asked, not
surprised when it came out more of a whine than an actual question. </p>

<p>"I think it's more for her peace of mind that we're not doing it in
her house. Kinda like a buffer zone." </p>

<p>I waited a beat before abruptly switching topics on her. "So what was
with the kiss between you and Cordelia?" I turned onto my back and
opened my eyes so I could see her face. And right then, it was
reddening slightly.</p>

<p>"Like I said, it wasn't ... she was feeling depressed ... " she
trailed off.</p>

<p>"And you thought kissing her would cheer her up?"</p>

<p>She quirked one eyebrow as she stared down at me. "It works for you
doesn't it?" Now it was my turn to blush. "But seriously, B, you've
got nothing to be jealous of. Queen C's got nothing on you." Her
fingers came down, stroking my cheek.</p>

<p>"So we're okay now?" I asked, hesitantly, trying to gauge her
reaction. She seemed to be giving the question due consideration and
after a brief silence, her eyes regained their focus and she tenderly
caressed the side of my face.</p>

<p>"I think we are," she stated simply, a smile beginning to form on her
face. I raised my hands, wrapping them around her neck and urging her
head lower as I met her halfway in a gentle kiss.</p>

<p>I groaned again as we parted. "I can't believe she won't let us sleep
in the same room together," I said again, sitting up in her
lap. "It's not fair." She chuckled softly, as her arms slid around my
waist. "This isn't funny," I said, pouting at her.</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," she said, grinning up at me. "But knowing you and
how stubborn you are, I'm guessing it won't be long before you get
her to bend that rule."</p>

<p>"You have that much faith in me?" I asked, smirking at her.</p>

<p>"I figured it was 'bout time I started living up to my name."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Fun, fun, fun," I muttered, right before I got thrown halfway across
the room by Lagos. But at least my pain distracted him enough so that
Buffy could chop off his head with an axe when he bent down to pick
up the Glove. A sharp pain lanced through my back as Xander lent me a
hand up and I spent a couple of minutes trying to stretch it out.</p>

<p>"He chased me all the way here," Xander was saying. And by 'here', I
guess he was talking about Giles' bachelor pad which we'd pretty much
trashed in about five minutes.</p>

<p>"Is this ... is this the Glove of Myhnegon?" Giles asked, picking the
ugly ass thing off the floor.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it started with an M," Buffy said, looking over at me. </p>

<p>I shrugged. Like I could remember --- all I knew was, this thing had
caused me nothing but trouble all day. No sooner had we started
winding down then the phone call had come from Giles telling us that
his door was being kicked in by a very ill tempered demon. And off we
had gone like two mice in the night, trying hard not to tip off mom
that we'd gone out again.</p>

<p>I zoned back into the conversation just in time to hear Buffy talking
about how Post had told me to find it for her.</p>

<p>"Highly unusual training method," he muttered to himself. "Pardon me
while I make a few calls."</p>

<p>"You all right?" Buffy asked, coming over to me and placing a hand on
my back.</p>

<p>"Yeah, just a bad bounce. You know me, I'll be fine in a few hours."
I dropped down onto the couch, lying on my front side with my head
resting on my folded arms as I waited for Giles to finish his phone
call.</p>

<p>"So guys, anyone want to enlighten me on who this Post woman is?"
Xander asked, picking up a vase from off the floor.</p>

<p>"If Mary Poppins and Dwight Eisenhower had a love child, she'd be
Post," Buffy answered with a grimace. "And, can you believe it, this
is the person the Council appointed as Faith's new Watcher."</p>

<p>"Actually, that's not quite true," Giles said, hanging up the phone
and taking off his glasses. "That was the Council on the phone.
Apparently, Mrs. Post was fired from the Watcher's Council for misuse
of dark power. They're sending someone over to deal with her. In the
meantime, I think the Glove will be safer with the two of you." </p>

<p>Buffy gingerly took the Glove from his hand like it was going to bite
her. And all three of us turned to hustle out of there but mom was
standing in the frigging doorway, looking like she was gonna be sick. </p>

<p>"Mom," Buffy said, looking like she was about ready to get sick
too. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I followed you," she muttered, peering past us to the headless body
still lying in the middle of Giles' living room floor. "What's going
on here?"</p>

<p>The next half an hour or so felt like deja vu --- y'know that feeling
that you've done it already? It was pretty much like the coming out
talk we'd had earlier, only with more Hellmouthy parts thrown in.
Actually, mom took it a hell of a lot better than I thought she
would. Maybe cause she was probably still in shock about the first
talk. Whatever it was, there was no yelling, no screaming, no
arguments and after that half an hour, we left Giles' pad with the
headless guy still hanging in the middle of the room. Thing about
slaying that I've always hated has been the cleanup. And for that
night at least, we weaseled out of it. I knew he was gonna bring it
up tomorrow but that was tomorrow. </p>

<p>We made it back to the house without any other big revelations
spilling out. Mom went to up to her room immediately. I gave Buffy a
good night kiss before going into my own room and I didn't miss the
pout on her face either when the door swung closed on her but what
were we gonna do? Shit always sorts itself out sooner or later.</p>

<p>And that was pretty much how it went for the next couple of days.
Post disappeared --- she didn't even stop by to say good bye. But
that was probably cause the Council was on her ass by that time. One
of the fashionably tweedy also stopped by to pick up the Glove and
was I glad to finally be rid of that ugly ass thing. I'd been keeping
it in the back of the closet till then cause I didn't even want to
look at it and it gave everybody else the creeps.</p>

<p>So almost everything was squared away. True, Cordy and I had been
kinda avoiding each other but I think both of us knew that there
ain't never going to be anything developing between us so, as far as
that was concerned, the ignoring thing probably would probably blow
over after awhile. That left me with one other thing I needed to do --
- something I'd been putting off cause I knew it was gonna get messy.</p>

<p>Pushing open the door, I looked around in the dim room. "Knock,
knock," I said, closing the door behind me and shutting out the
slanting rays of the sun. "Anybody home? I swear I'm not here for
another fight." </p>

<p>The room was what you'd call real under-furnished. Not much in the
way of creature comforts but there were a couple of books scattered
on the desk with titles that I couldn't even pronounce.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" </p>

<p>I looked up and saw Angel skulking in a dark corner of the
room. "Believe it or not, I'm just here to apologize for what
happened. I jumped to conclusions." I shrugged. "My bad."</p>

<p>He took a step forward, still looking nervous. "Honest mistake."</p>

<p>"Right ... anyway, that doesn't mean I like you or anything. First
sign of you even thinking about going evil and I'll happily stake
you."</p>

<p>He nodded. "And I'm sorry about what happened with Buffy -- "</p>

<p>"I know, I know," I said, cutting in. "You're sorry. Yeah, well, that
don't count for shit. All I know for sure is that you've got the hots
for my girl and as long as you still do, we're never gonna be bosom
buddies. But I'm over being the jealous girlfriend now cause I know
she loves me. It took me awhile to get that but trust me, I've got
it ... plus, I can't really blame you for falling in love with her. I
sure did." I gave him a tiny smirk as I left him standing there with
a thoughtful expression on his face. He was probably going to brood
on it for awhile. He looked like the kind that did that a lot.</p>

<p>Finally getting that unpleasant business out of the way, I walked
towards the mall where Willow had planned some movie thing for all of
us to go to so we weren't laying around the house ... again. I hoped
this time, I could talk Buffy into getting some nachos and cheese. I
couldn't believe her the first time we'd gone and she absolutely
refused to buy it cause she didn't want to kiss me with nacho breath.</p>

<p>Like I'd mind.</p>
