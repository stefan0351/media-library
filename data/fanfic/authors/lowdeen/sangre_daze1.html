<p>"Miss Spencer!"</p>

<p>I literally froze midstride, biting back the curse that automatically
came to mind as I slowly turned around. I must've put on the fakest
fucking smile on my face as Snyder came walking up to me.</p>

<p>"You do realize school started thirty minutes ago, do you not?" He
asked with a gleam in his cold, cold eyes. </p>

<p>"Kinda hard when you don't have a watch," I said, holding up my bare
wrist. Smartass remarks like that don't help me get on his good side
either but no way was I gonna be a toadie for him.</p>

<p>His lips pinched together, making it look like he had no lips.
Frightening. "Detention. Today. You know the room." With that
pronouncement, he stomped his way up the hall.</p>

<p>I swear, since Buffy's taken off for college, he's been using me as
his personal pin cushion, writing me up for the stupidest little
things. So I was half an hour late. What was the big deal anyway? It
wasn't like I was going to miss some earth shattering lecture that
was gonna change my life --- bore me to death was more like it.
Without Buffy and everybody else around, school was even more of a
fucking chore than it'd ever been. And it wasn't like my grades
really mattered after junior year. If I were to go to college ---
which I'm still not sure about --- they wouldn't care about senior
year cause they know everybody slacks off by then. So I gotta believe
that Snyder's being a prick for the sake of being a prick.</p>

<p>I pulled out some big, heavy textbook from my locker before slamming
the door closed and walking to a class which is more than half over
already. I'm sure the teacher will appreciate my presence anyway,
seeing as how I contribute so much by sleeping in the back of the
room and not disturbing the learning process going on around me. I've
been late so many times that he barely glanced over at me when I
walked in.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>Like I said, it sucks ass that all of my friends have graduated.
There's nobody to talk to, nobody I want to talk to anyway cause
let's face it, I'm not some social butterfly. Never been one to seek
out other people, especially if most of 'em are total and complete
morons. You'd have to be if you're still living in Sunnydale. Nine
out of ten times, you'll end up vampire chow even if you've got two
full time Slayers on the prowl. That's just the odds.</p>

<p>I slouched further down in my seat, my eyes about glazed over as I
tapped the end of my pen on the textbook lying unopened on the desk.
Looking past one of the varsity players sitting to my left, the urge
to get the fuck out of here struck again as the perfect sunny day
called to me like some siren's song. Weather like that just begs to
be enjoyed. I could be having tons of fun exposing vamp nests to
natural light but instead, I'm stuck inside listening to ... the
process of human reproduction? As taught by the phys. ed. teacher.</p>

<p>I just want to gouge my eyes out right now. Health is one of those
classes that I've been putting off and putting off till it sneaked up
behind me and took a nice honking chunk out of my ass. Now I realize
with excruciatingly painful clarity why I've been avoiding it for as
long as I have. It friggin bites. And no sooner does the bell ring,
then I bolt the hell outta there.</p>

<p>And to think, if Howard hadn't doctored my records, I'd still be a
junior for having missed most of last year. If I ever see that guy
again, I'm totally giving him a thank you card or something cause he
did it without me even asking. The rest of the day passed by in some
sort of haze but at least Coach got me out of detention cause she
said I had more important things to do. Running around a big oval
track beats sitting in a room staring at the teacher anyday.</p>

<p>So after I put in the miles, I finally went off to do something I
actually wanted to do. Or at least, I *was* going when Giles came out
of nowhere and stopped me.</p>

<p>"Hey G-man. I'm kinda in a hurry. Whassup?"</p>

<p>He gives me this look that tells me to shut up only he's too polite
to actually say that out loud. "We need to step up your training
before patrol tonight," he says instead. "I think we've all been too
lackadaisical lately on that front. Please let Buffy know."</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. No prob," I said, already walking away with a wave and a
wink. Every so often, Giles gets into one of these moods where he
thinks we need to work harder. You get used to it after awhile. I
think he's just trying to justify the big bucks the Council pays him.
But I don't ask the reasons why, I just *do*.</p>

<p>The parking lot was mostly empty but you could've spotted my car from
a mile away even if it were full. That was the first big money I'd
spent. And when I'd slapped that cold hard cash down on the desk for
the down payment, the feeling was one I hadn't been too used to --- I
was finally getting some respect. I almost laughed at how fast that
guy's eyes lit up. One minute, he can't even bother with making eye
contact, the next, he's sucking major ass.</p>

<p>It was like some magic switch had been turned on and I was finally
*somebody*. Not just the second Slayer, not just fuckup Faith, but a
player. All my life, I've always been the one played ... not anymore.
I took out the keys, pressed the button to shut off the alarms and
smiled like every other time cause the little beeping was just so
much music to my ears.</p>

<p>I slipped into the bucket seats of my silver Porsche convertible and
put on the sunglasses which were in the glove compartment cause the
sun's rays were just starting to slant horizontal. As I drove towards
the University of Sunnydale with the hard strains of a guitar solo
blasting from the radio, I wondered again if this wasn't all a
fucking dream.</p>

<p>I could afford anything I wanted and with that, my life could be
lived any *way* I wanted it. And even though I wouldn't admit it to
anybody, that fact scared me more than being some poor, unwanted kid
ever could cause I was used to that --- been that my whole entire
life and all. But now ... now, I could actually do something besides
living hard, dying young, and hoping I didn't make too much of a mess
on the sidewalk when someone finally took me out.</p>

<p>Yeah, that 'get out of jail free card' scared the shit outta me.</p>

<p>And mom had started bringing up the question of what I wanted to do
after high school. Hell, I didn't even know what I wanted to do
tomorrow, let alone next year. She kept hinting about college but
another four years of doing time in a classroom wasn't something I
dreamed about. If I really wanted, I could do nothing at all --- the
cash ain't gonna run out. But everybody keeps trying to tell me what
was best for me. The only question I have is --- how the hell do they
know when I don't even know?</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes, I pulled the car into a parking space and
climbed out, my mood lifting as I walked towards the dorms. When
everything else turns to shit, I know it'll all be okay in the end
cause there's always Buffy. It was Wednesday and it was after six so
I knew she'd already gone to all her classes. When she first started
college, I never knew when she was gonna be around cause she had some
really messed up schedule but, eventually, I memorized it. So I knew
exactly what times I'd be able to catch her. Beats waiting around in
her dorm room, that's for damn sure. </p>

<p>And speaking of dorm room --- I pushed open the door to hers,
smirking when I saw her sprawled under the covers of her bed. Aw,
fuck. I could've stayed there and stared forever if I weren't still
standing in the middle of the frigging hallway. I eased myself
through the door, closing it behind me with a slight click as I
walked softly to the bedside. Crouching down, I let my eyes wander
where my hands itched to touch. She was an angel. And she was *my*
angel.</p>

<p>Before I met her, love was just a word tossed around in the movies
for a sappy audience. </p>

<p>Before I met her, I didn't know you could want to live your entire
life for someone else. </p>

<p>Then I met her.</p>

<p>I placed a gentle kiss on her cheek that barely brushed her skin
before taking off my shoes and slipping under the covers with her. It
was a tight fit but she moved just enough that I could rest
comfortably on my side, my arms wrapping around her as she burrowed
into my body with a sleepy sigh.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed and I thought she was still asleep when a
mumbled, "I like how you smell" reached my ears. </p>

<p>I did a double take, wondering if she was talking in her
sleep. "What?"</p>

<p>"I like how you smell," she said again and I saw the grin spreading
across her face as I looked down at her. "You smell like how
a 'Faith' would smell. I've always wanted to tell you that."</p>

<p>"Uh, thanks, I guess," I said, smirking. "Are you hitting the sauce
again, B? Y'know, just cause you're out of the house now -- "</p>

<p>She raised herself up on her elbows, staring down at me with a lazy,
seductive smile on her face. "Shut up," she whispered, dipping her
head to capture my lips in a warm kiss. "I've wanted to do that all
day," she said, breathing out the words in a soft rush.</p>

<p>"Glad you waited for me." I smirked up at her as a mock growl rumbled
deep in her throat. She lowered herself on top of my body again but
before she could make another move, the door suddenly opened.</p>

<p>There was a gasp and then Willow's strained voice. "Sorry, sorry ...
I didn't ... I'll wait ... " The door slammed shut again as the
redhead backed out.</p>

<p>"Willow, wait!" Buffy yelled, getting off of me and out of the bed to
run out the door and drag Willow back inside with an ever placid Oz
trailing behind them.</p>

<p>"I should've knocked ... definitely should've," Willow muttered like
she was in some sort of daze. "I will next time, you betcha."</p>

<p>"A system is good for this," Oz said, speaking up. "Some kind of Do
Not Disturb signal like a sock hanging from the door knob."</p>

<p>"I'll write a memo to myself," Buffy said with a smirk. "Sock,
doorknob, got it."</p>

<p>"Anybody else hungry?" I asked, hoping someone was cause my stomach
was about ready to jump out and make a break for it. "We've gotta
make it fast cause Giles wants us back at the library for some extra
training."</p>

<p>Buffy groaned as she went for her shoes. "I thought when I graduated,
I wouldn't ever have to step foot in that school again. Why couldn't
Giles have gotten a job here or something? There are plenty of books
here too. If I run into Snyder again -- "</p>

<p>"B, sometime this century?" She stuck out her tongue at me which I
thought was real cute. "We'll do that later," I said, licking my
lips. She froze for a second and then rushed me out the door,
refusing to look at Will who was as red as her hair and Oz who had an
eyebrow raised.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"I've been thinking, B."</p>

<p>"What have you been thinking, F?" I grinned at the tiny smirk
rippling the corners of her mouth as I ran a hand through her hair.</p>

<p>"Y'know how I've been wanting to get a place of my own?" I
nodded. "Yeah, well, I think now's about the time. I mean I got the
money. Shit, I've got more than enough and ... "</p>

<p>"And?" I prompted, seeing that she was avoiding my gaze.</p>

<p>"And ... you're gonna make me say it, aren't you?" I kept grinning at
her as she heaved a melodramatic sigh. "And cause I thought, maybe,
you'd move in too ... y'know, if you wanted to. It'd be cool."</p>

<p>"I'll give you my answer after we take care of them," I said, hefting
my crossbow. I glanced down the hall where the paramilitary duo had
stopped at a closed door. They didn't know it but they were standing
outside the janitor's closet. All they were going to find in there
were a couple of mops and buckets of gray water instead of what they
were really hunting for --- us.</p>

<p>Faith and I crept up behind them and when we were two steps away, she
called out, "Yo, homeboys." As when they turned around, we fired. The
bolts found their marks, right in the heart. They dropped to the
floor, their weapons clattering to the ground. "That was quick, yet
satisfying," Faith said, as she stepped over the bodies and opened up
the closet door. </p>

<p>Bending down, she picked up the tiny transmitters which we'd been
inadvertently carrying around all night. That's how these two soldier
types had been able to track us --- that's how we'd been able to
track them too. She squeezed them in her hand, reducing them to
pieces of useless metal.</p>

<p>"Whatever happened to a nice date where we're not hunted for sport?"
I asked, walking with her back up the hall.</p>

<p>"Ah, the good old days," she quipped, placing an arm across my
shoulders and pulling me closer. "But you know you'll miss the
adrenaline rush --- get that vibe running through your system like
liquid fire."</p>

<p>"But I won't miss the being shot at or the running or the hurting or
the -- "</p>

<p>"So you thought it over yet?" She suddenly interrupted my diatribe of
the many and diverse ways in which being a Slayer sucked.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The moving in with me part," she said ducking her head.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but grin at her suddenly shy reaction. Did she really
think I would say no? "Faith, as soon as you find an apartment,
you're going to have to help me move."</p>

<p>She looked up at me again, a look of shock briefly flashing across
her features before a grin replaced it. "You like jerking me around,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Only you."</p>

<p>We both had grins on our faces when we walked into the library where
Giles was still nursing the minor head trauma he'd gotten from one of
our cowboy hunters. For whatever reason, today had been declared open
season on all Slayers. I think one of them even called
it 'Slayerfest'. The name sounded like some sort of perverted holiday
to me.</p>

<p>"Did you ... take care of the rest of the hunters?"</p>

<p>"They're dealt with," Faith said, going over to lean against the
table.</p>

<p>"The janitor might find a little surprise waiting for him
tomorrow ... nothing he hasn't seen before," I rushed to assure him.</p>

<p>"Well, if that's all, I think I'll retire for the night before this
headache turns from splitting to devastating," he said, getting up.</p>

<p>"Take care Giles." I watched him leave and then turned to
Faith. "What do you want to do now?" I asked, sidling up next to her.</p>

<p>She cocked an eyebrow, placing an arm around my waist. "Well, let's
see. We *did* just kick some major ass and you know how I get after
we do that ... "</p>

<p>"Hungry and ... " I pretended like I was trying to remember exactly
what it was but I couldn't keep it up any longer as she pressed
closer to me. </p>

<p>Placing her lips close to my ear, she finished the sentence in a low
rumble. "Horny." I tried suppressing the shudder as she continued
torturing me with little kisses placed alongside my jaw, backing me
up so that I ended up lying on top of the table.</p>

<p>"Faith ... what are you going to do?" I asked, looking up to find an
enigmatic smile gracing her lips.</p>

<p>"I've always had this fantasy," she said in a conversational tone, at
the same time, casually taking off my skirt in one fluid
motion. "About making you come in the middle of the library." I
gasped a little as she moved in between my legs, pressing her hips
against me. The tongue of desire that had started in my lower belly
had travelled lower. "The only thing that's missing is the audience
but I think we'll manage, don't you?" She bent down, taking my lips
in a thorough kiss that erased all my misgivings about the
whole 'having sex in the library' taboo.</p>

<p>I wrapped my legs securely around her waist, feeling her push my top
up, exposing my stomach to the cool air. I felt her hands on my
breasts. Her lips everywhere. And I couldn't control myself any
longer, rocking my hips against her body, feeling the delicious
friction, losing myself in her touch.</p>

<p>In the back of my mind, the outside chance that someone could and
might possibly walk in on us at any minute only made me want her more
but thoughts weren't digesting so well in my mind as Faith did that
thing with her tongue which always sent me over. I think I screamed
her name when I came but I couldn't really remember.</p>

<p>What I do remember is the "I love you," she kept repeating over and
over as I came back to myself. *This* was my Faith. The Faith only I
saw, the Faith I wouldn't share with anyone. I don't think anyone but
me knew just how tender she could be. She pulled me up, wrapping her
arms around me as she held me close.</p>

<p>"I think I'd better get dressed now," I finally said, going over to
pick up the skirt from where it had been dropped.</p>

<p>"I like you better without it," she said from behind me. And I knew
she meant it too.</p>

<p>"Yeah but I've got to get back. I'm going to fail so badly tomorrow
if I don't study tonight. Teaches me to put it off till the last
minute."</p>

<p>"You're ditching me for a study session?" She asked, standing there
with the cutest pout on her face. "And after I rocked your world too."</p>

<p>"Rocked my world?" I asked, trying to suppress a chuckle. I walked
over, putting on my skirt as I went. "Baby, you know I wouldn't if
this wasn't massively important," I said, trying to placate her.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll just have to find the fun by myself tonight," she said
with a convincing leer.</p>

<p>"Don't get into too much 'fun'. You've got to save some for me."</p>

<p>"I've always got some for you, B." </p>

<p>I was almost tempted to ditch studying and face whatever consequences
tomorrow might bring when Faith gave me a good night kiss that left
my knees quaking like jello. But somehow, through some inner
fortitude which I did not know I had possessed, I stopped just short
of throwing myself at her as she left me standing outside my dorm
after having driven me from the high school in her new toy. I kept
watching as she literally swaggered away, the few students who were
still outside instinctively getting out of her way.</p>

<p>Heaving a self-pitying sigh, I trudged inside, not looking forward to
either the books that awaited my soggy mind or the room mate who was
seriously getting on my nerves. I knew going in that living with
someone, Faith notwithstanding, was going to be a change but I just
didn't know it was going to be as much of a pain in the ass as it
was. </p>

<p>"Hey," I said with all the enthusiasm I could muster as I walked
through the door and saw Kathy sitting on her bed with a book in her
hands. I went over to the minifridge and my eyes almost bugged out
when I saw that almost all the food in there was labeled. Okay, back
up one second and let me say that again.</p>

<p>All the food was *labeled*... how sick is that?</p>

<p>"What is this?" I asked, holding up an egg with a label on its shell.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that a good idea?" She asks all chippy and peppy from the
bed. "This way, there won't be any confusion over what's yours and
what's mine."</p>

<p>What's mine turned out to be an apple and a half bottle of water.</p>

<p>"Oh and someone came by here looking for you."</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked growling out the word as I grabbed the bottle and a
book from off the desk.</p>

<p>"Someone named ... Parker? Since you weren't here, I entertained him
for the afternoon."</p>

<p>I didn't know why I felt like I was about to explode. Parker was just
some guy I'd met in the cafeteria. He seemed nice enough but I'd just
met him today. So it shouldn't have mattered that the two of them had
hung out. But for some reason, it did. And I was starting to suspect
why Kathy was annoying me like a red hot poker being jabbed through
my eye. </p>

<p>She had to be evil.</p>

<p>She had to be stopped.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>I flopped back onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling of *my*
apartment. </p>

<p>Damn, that was a trip. </p>

<p>*My* apartment. Shit, I don't think I'll ever get over the sound of
that. The furniture and all the other stuff just came in yesterday.
Mom was real good about me moving out of the house and all, even
helping me pick out the lamps and bed and everything. And she didn't
pass out when Buffy told her she was going to move in with me. I
think, in the back of her mind, she knew that was gonna happen sooner
or later but just being confronted with it, you kinda get jolted out
of that secure place you've built up around your mind.</p>

<p>But it was past due anyway. Buffy had been going totally psycho bitch
over her roommate lately. Maybe she needed a vacation or something
cause she wasn't acting like her usual calm and steady self. And here
I thought I was the only one with a license to act like a loose
cannon. But what was really starting to worry me was that whenever we
were together, all she'd talk about was how Kathy was doing this or
how Kathy was doing that and how it was annoying the shit out of her.</p>

<p>The phone rang suddenly and when I picked it up, the sound of
Willow's voice came through the line. "Faith? Hey, it's Willow."</p>

<p>"Whassup Red? How's my favorite research girl."</p>

<p>"Faith, I just talked to Buffy. She's ... well, she's scaring me. All
she kept talking about was how Kathy was all evil and she was going
to kill her and she had toenail clippings. Toenail clippings, Faith.
That's what she's basing the evilness on."</p>

<p>"OKay," I said slowly, trying to get my mind to wrap around the fact
that my girlfriend had picked up someone else's toenail clippings for
analysis. "Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"I sent her off the Giles'. I already called over there to warn him
but you might want to be there too in case ... "</p>

<p>She didn't finish the sentence. "All right. I'll go over there now.
Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine." I hung up, hoping that what
I'd just said wouldn't turn out a total lie.</p>

<p>All the way over to Giles' apartment, I wondered what the fuck had
happened. How the hell did it get to this point? I knew she was
acting crazy all of a sudden but I didn't think it was Leatherface
crazy. I mean, thinking her roommate was evil? Yeah, the girl was
anal and shit but not on the level of say, a snake demon. Maybe
Willow had been exaggerating. Maybe it wasn't as bad as she'd thought.</p>

<p>But when I walked through Giles' apartment, I saw Buffy tied to a
chair and Xander, Oz, and Cordy looking like they were about to shit
their pants. I'd probably feel the same way if I was on the receiving
end of the Slayer death stare like those three were. If looks could
kill ... well, they'd be the dearly departed.</p>

<p>"Faith, help me!" Buffy yells as soon as she sees me. </p>

<p>"NO!" Xander shouts, looking positively terrified. "No hurt Xander."</p>

<p>I walked over to stand in front of Buffy, giving Xander a look as I
walked past him. "What's going on?"</p>

<p>"Giles thinks it's a possession by the demon she ran into in the
woods the other day," Oz answered. "He's looking up a spell to get
the demon to reveal itself now."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordy added. "Your girlfriend's acting like a real loon ...
even more than usual."</p>

<p>"They don't know what they're talking about," Buffy says, drawing my
attention again. "Faith, you know me. Kathy's evil. You've seen her.
She listens to nothing but Celine Dion. You have to believe me. Don't
you trust me?"</p>

<p>"I ... " Glancing between the two camps, I was torn between what to
do. "Fuck it," I finally said, ignoring the guys' protests as I went
over to her side and began untying her. </p>

<p>"Um, Faith?" Xander stammered. "This might be the worst bad judgment
call in the history of bad judgment calls. Think about it. Do you
really want to be ranked higher than Neville Chamberlain?"</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked, loosening the last of the knots. "Look, if I'm wrong
then I'm wrong but ain't no way I'm just gonna stand here while my
girlfriend's asking for my help."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Buffy said, getting up. "Come on. Let's go." She glared at
the trio of Xander, Cordy and Oz as she passed them but they still
followed after her. See, that's the thing about Buffy. Even when you
think she might be crazy and homicidal, you're still gonna follow her
into hell and back. There's just an overwhelming sense of power she
carries within herself that has nothing to do with her as the Slayer
and everything to do with her as the woman. </p>

<p>We took my car while the other three took Oz' van.</p>

<p>"You don't believe me, do you?" She asked. I glanced over at her but
she was looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>"I took your side, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it like I was criticizing you or anything. It's just
that even when you didn't believe me, you stuck up for me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, what'd you think I was gonna do?" </p>

<p>She didn't say anything to that but when I glanced back at her again,
she had a soft grin on her face. The grin was long gone though by the
time she stalked into her dorm room with the rest of us following
behind her. I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't
half of Kathy's face getting peeled off, revealing the demon within. </p>

<p>While the knock down, drag out brawl took place between Buffy and
Kathy, the rest of us stood by the doorway. I know the reason I
didn't do anything was cause Buffy was handling things all right. At
least until these other demons showed up in some kinda portal or
something. But all they did was drag Kathy away.</p>

<p>"Told you she was evil," Buffy said as we all piled into the room.</p>

<p>"She looked normal enough," Cordy said, putting in her two cents. "It
wasn't like she had horns growing out of her head."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Buffy. It wasn't like we didn't trust you ... " Xander said,
trailing off.</p>

<p>Wrapping an arm around her waist, I asked, "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," she said, instantly sagging into me. "Can we just get out of
here for awhile?" </p>

<p>We took off, making a stop along the way for some burgers and since
Buffy wasn't too high on staying at the dorm another night, I drove
us back to my apartment.</p>

<p>"Nice," she said, glancing around as I set the food on the
table. "I'm guessing you picked out the home entertainment system
yourself."</p>

<p>"Sixty inch flat screen television, surround sound speakers plus
subwoofers, VCR, DVD, Playstation --- come on, B. It's just the
barest necessities."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," she said with a grin as she stretched and yawned. "I am
*so* tired. But at least now, I'll get a good night's sleep without
waking up to a demon trying to suck my soul out of my mouth."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, B. I'll keep the Bogey man away." She poked me
in the stomach on the way to the food, deflating my bravado with a
smirk.</p>

<p>The next day when the alarm clock snapped me awake, I was all ready
to go right back to sleep when Buffy actually pushed me out of bed,
telling me it was for my own good. I groaned and mumbled all the way
from the bed to the bathroom and from the bathroom to the closet.
Leaning over my still curled up girlfriend, all comfortable in the
sheets, I whispered, "You are a cruel, cruel woman, B."</p>

<p>She turned over, a sleepy grin gracing her face as she pulled me down
and planted a kiss on my lips. "Bye, Faith," she mumbled before
turning over again. I sat there for a moment just staring at her back
before hauling myself up and going out the door. If I was real lucky,
I wouldn't run into Snyder today. </p>

<p>Lately, he'd been on the warpath or something, leaving a trail of
broken morale and weeping students in his wake. So I'd been doing
everything I could to avoid the troll all week. When I walked through
the entrance of the school though, the first person I saw was Snyder.
It was almost like he was waiting for me to show up cause he made a
beeline straight for me, shoving other people out of his way.</p>

<p>"You," he says, coming to a stop in front of me.</p>

<p>"Me? What?"</p>

<p>"You're an instigator, Miss Spencer. Don't think for a moment that I
don't have my eyes on you. Here." He shoved a box of candy into my
hands. "I've got ten more boxes with your name on it. The band needs
new uniforms and I think it would be in your best interest to help
out by selling some candy."</p>

<p>"You're kidding right?"</p>

<p>His right eye started twitching as he glared at me. "I assure you I'm
not kidding." </p>

<p>He walked right past me, yelling at another poor bastard who'd gotten
in his line of sight. I bounced the box a couple of times in one hand
before going over to the library where Giles was probably already
well on his way to a third cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Faith. Good morning," he said, absently looking up from a book.</p>

<p>"Hey G, whassup?"</p>

<p>"I've been reading an entry in the Watcher's journals. It's very
enlightening actually -- "</p>

<p>"Yeah? Great." I tossed him the box, almost making him drop the
book. "Go ahead, take it. I got like ten more anyway."</p>

<p>"Really? Uh, thank you."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Did you see that? Did you ... wait!"</p>

<p>"Let it go, B," Faith said, snagging me by the arm and preventing me
from going after my mom and Giles who I'd just found out might have
had sex ... together. "They're consenting adults."</p>

<p>"They weren't. Not really. Not when they had the candy." I knew I was
losing the argument but the idea of my mom having sex with anybody,
let alone Giles, turned my blood cold.</p>

<p>"I kinda think they make a cute couple."</p>

<p>I shot her a look which, of course, she chose to ignore as she turned
her back and began to make her way towards the door. Throwing one
last dirty look in the direction where the two "adults" had taken
off, I followed her, linking my arm through hers when I caught up. We
walked for a little while in silence, me because I still couldn't get
that nasty mental picture of mom and Giles out of my head and I'm not
really sure why Faith was so quiet all of a sudden.</p>

<p>"What's up?" I asked, glancing over at her and simultaneously wishing
I could wash my brain out with soap.</p>

<p>"What?" She asked, giving me a blank stare.</p>

<p>"You're quiet," I said, stating the obvious. </p>

<p>"It's nothing," she said, getting into her car. </p>

<p>Getting into the passenger side, I resisted the urge to dig for more
information because I knew she'd tell me eventually if it was
important enough. But I just hated the wait. Sometimes, I wished she
would come out and tell me everything that was going on inside her
mind but that wasn't Faith. That's never been Faith. If she didn't
think I needed to know, it would stay cooped up in her mind.</p>

<p>"You know what we could do?" I asked, trying just as much to get my
mind away from its problems as well as getting her off hers. "We
could go visit Xander. You know he's got that bartending job now."</p>

<p>She smirked before asking in a half joking tone, "That's not your
snide little way of getting me drunk, is it, B?"</p>

<p>"And if it was?" I asked, using the same tone. </p>

<p>"Trying to get a minor intoxicated? Oh B, is that what you've sunk
to? What would the Watcher's Council think?"</p>

<p>"Shut up and drive," I said, punching her in the thigh, making her
chuckle. </p>

<p>We made it to the bar in record time, mostly because Faith didn't
know the meaning of the words speed and limit put together. I swear,
sometimes, I think the girl actually wanted a cop to pull her
over ... or at least make the attempt. And seeing as how I really
didn't want to spend the night trying to outrace the cops, I
constantly had to remind her to slow down which of course she took to
mean she could nickname me grandma when we were in the car together --
- which is *so* not true.</p>

<p>I mean, I just didn't see the point of going over 50 in a residential
neighborhood. Does that mean I'm acting like an old fuddy duddy now?
I think not.</p>

<p>"See, I got us here with all major limbs still intact," she said,
grinning at me triumphantly as we walked through the doors of the bar.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I think you left my sanity behind somewhere on Maple
Street." I think I heard her mutter 'Like you've ever had that' but
the noise from a nearby table drowned it out. That didn't stop me
from shooting her a look though.</p>

<p>"I'll get us a table," she said more loudly.</p>

<p>I nodded, going over to the bar where Xander was busy filling up mugs
from the tap. "Hey," I said, getting his attention. He waved back
before realizing he still had a full mug in his hand which wasn't
full much longer.</p>

<p>"Gah!" He shouted, getting a towel to mop up the mess. "Three arms.
Three. That's what I need right now. Why couldn't I have been born a
freak?"</p>

<p>Choosing not to answer the question, I asked one of my own. "Busy?"</p>

<p>He looked up at me incredulously before slowly nodding his head. "You
could say that."</p>

<p>I nodded back sympathetically before going ahead and making his life
even 'busier' by ordering a beer plus a Jack and coke. Lucky for me,
he didn't spill the order so I was able to deliver both drinks back
to the table Faith had staked out. She looked at me questioningly
when I placed the Jack and coke in front of her. I shrugged. "You
just seem like the type."</p>

<p>"Good guess," She said, giving me a wry grin before taking a sip.</p>

<p>I took a couple of swallows of beer, wondering vaguely why it tasted
like horse shit or at least what I would think horse shit tasted like
if I were ever of a mind to taste horse shit. I looked up and saw the
mildly ... cocky? gaze on Faith's face which made me swallow the
swill in my mouth and take another sip. She could probably drink me
under the table. She probably would. But that only made me want to
try and prove both her and myself wrong. And if that meant drinking
some nasty beer ... bottom's up. </p>

<p>I don't know how it happened but when I looked down a while later, I
saw an empty mug staring back at me. "What happened to the ... " I
pointed distractedly down at the empty glass, frowning as I heard my
words coming disjointedly out of my mouth.</p>

<p>Faith was looking at me with a strange combination of worry and
teasing concern. "B, are you all right?"</p>

<p>Why was she asking if I was all right? All I'd asked was why my glass
was empty. "What happened to my beer?" I asked again, irritated that
she couldn't just answer me the first time.</p>

<p>"You drank it," she said slowly, watching me like I was out of my
mind or something.</p>

<p>I was beginning to get irritated at her attitude. "Then get me
another one," I grumpily said/demanded.</p>

<p>"No," she answered shortly, looking pissed off. "I think you've had
enough for one night."</p>

<p>"But I only had one!" I practically shouted. She was just acting
bitchy now.</p>

<p>"That's it. Let's go." She stood up, trying to drag me up too but I
wrenched my arm away. "What the fuck is wrong with you, B?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me like I'm a kid. I'm older than you are."</p>

<p>Suddenly another voice cut in. "If you want more beer, we've got
plenty." I turned my head to see an average looking blonde guy but
what really held my attention was the two full pitchers of beer he
was carrying.</p>

<p>"Hey, was anyone talking to you?" Faith looked about ready to hit
him. "Why don't you go back to your little fuck face buddies and stop
trying to hit on my girlfriend?"</p>

<p>Mr. Beer Guy started to look angry but before he could say anything
back, I turned to Faith and let her have it. "What the hell is your
problem? If I want some beer, I'll get some beer. And if I want to
sit with someone else who's nice enough to invite me for some beer,
then I'll do that too. If you don't like that then go."</p>

<p>I went with Mr. Beer Guy towards his table where a couple of other
Beer Guys were sitting, leaving Faith staring at me with her mouth
slightly open. I sat down and everybody around me was smiling. Much
nicer than Faith who was over at the bar talking with Xander,
probably bitching about not being able to control me any more.</p>

<p>. . . . .</p>

<p>Beer.</p>

<p>Nice beer.</p>

<p>Good beer.</p>

<p>No more beer. "Get more beer." </p>

<p>I push boy. </p>

<p>He fall. </p>

<p>Everybody laugh.</p>
