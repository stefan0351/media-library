<p>"It, uh, could've been worse." Damn. That sounded so lame, I almost
bit my own tongue off trying to push it out. I glanced over at Buffy
who was still frozen to the spot, her eyes fixed on the car, or what
was left of it. If there was a vehicular heaven, her dad's sweet ride
was definitely there right now. The hubcabs were gone. So were the
wheels, the radio, the doors, the hood, the engine. The only thing
left that hadn't been pried off was the license plate which had been
how the police were able to identify it in the first place. Even the
damn hood ornament was gone. What pathetic fuck would take a hood
ornament anyway?</p>

<p>"Faith?" I looked over at her again, grimacing at the hollow tone of
her voice. "Please tell me this is some awful nightmare and that I'm
going to wake up any minute."</p>

<p>I gave her a sympathetic look but kept my mouth shut. She closed her
eyes and groaned low in her throat. That's when I happened to catch
the deskjock cop behind her checking out her ass. I gave him a hard
look once his eyes dipped back up and I moved closer to Buffy,
wrapping an arm around her waist, giving him a silent warning that
he'd better not do anything more than look. Buffy rested her head on
my shoulder then turned her face, nuzzling into my neck as if
searching for comfort.</p>

<p>"C'mon. Let's get out of here," I said, rubbing a hand soothingly
across her back. She nodded her head and we followed the cop back
upstairs where we were supposed to fill out some paperwork. "I'll be
right back," I said, letting her take care of that as I wandered a
couple of doors away where I thought I'd seen a soda machine. Instead
of finding a coke though, I came face to ratfink face with a
sleazebag that I thought I'd seen the last of two years ago.</p>

<p>He sat on a wooden bench and if you didn't know better, you'd think
he was lounging in the park, enjoying a lazy Sunday afternoon by how
relaxed he looked. The handcuffs kinda burst the bubble to that
illusion though. He had on a black leather jacket, dusty black jeans,
and a white turning to gray T-shirt --- all well-worn, all making him
look like the perfect image of a wannabe James Dean. He'd filled out
some since the last time I'd seen him, his hair a little shaggier, a
five o'clock shadow showing around his jaw, and his eyes still the
same electric blue that'd made me fall for him when I was younger and
dumber. </p>

<p>"Faith," he said, a smile starting to spread across his face as he
cocked his head to the side to look up at me. "Long time no see,
baby."</p>

<p>"Fuck you, asshole," I snarled back. It only made his smile wider. I
knew it would.</p>

<p>"What's with the grouchy greeting? You act like I killed your old man
or something. Don't you remember the good times me and you had?"</p>

<p>My hands fisted at my sides, wanting to punch a hole in the smug
bastard's face. "The only thing I remember is that you tried to pimp
me out to your friends, Troy. I'm not that stupid little girl who
followed you around like a dog anymore. I'm not your fucking whore,
you sick shit."</p>

<p>"Faith?" I looked down the hall and saw Buffy walking towards us, a
concerned expression on her face.</p>

<p>"Who's the schoolgirl? I bet she's a wild one in bed." I turned and
lifted him up by the front of his collar. I saw the fear the instant
it entered his eyes and grinned, enjoying it, enjoying the power.</p>

<p>"I'll cut off your fucking dick and stuff it down your throat if you
come near me or her," I hissed in his ear, making sure that my voice
was low enough so that only he would hear me. I shoved him back down,
hard enough to make him smack the back of his head against the
concrete wall. Walking towards Buffy and cutting her off with a hard
look before she could ask, I took her arm and led her back to the
front of the station. When we were outside, she stopped, refusing to
move. She remained silent until I finally looked up at her. I was
dreading the words coming out of her mouth before she even said them.</p>

<p>"Faith, who was he?"</p>

<p>I blew out a frustrated breath, breaking into a half grimace, half
grin. Of course she'd want to know. "A prick," I said, looking her in
the eye and making sure she knew I was dead serious about that.</p>

<p>"Faith..."</p>

<p>I rubbed a hand across my face. "What do you want me to say, B? He's
a fucking asshole who I thought I was in love with before I grew a
brain." I shook my head, still not believing how gullible I'd been,
falling for a creep like him. "Can we not talk about him please? He
was a bad mistake and talking about him makes me sick." I took her
hand, silently pleading that she'd give me a little room on the
subject.</p>

<p>"Sure. It's just that..." Her eyes wandered back to the police
station and then back to me again. "He's forgotten," she simply said.
Just like that. Forgotten. I wish I could forget so easily.</p>

<p>I reached out a hand, brushing back a lock of blond hair that'd
fallen across her face and cupped her cheek in my palm. She stepped
into me, wrapping me up in a tight hug while my own arms
automatically folded around her. But I couldn't get him out of my
mind, couldn't burn his face from my brain. And thinking about him
while I was with Buffy made me feel so dirty that I broke away from
the comfort she offered because I didn't ever want to feel that way
with her.</p>

<p>"So you got the paperwork filled out?" I mumbled, looking away so she
couldn't see the disgust in my eyes.</p>

<p>"Yeah." She cleared her throat. The kind where you don't really need
to but you do it anyway because it was too uncomfortable not
to. "Starting now, I have less than a day before facing the firing
squad," she said with a wry grin.</p>

<p>"Will you feel better if I buy you lunch?"</p>

<p>"One last meal?" She grinned, genuinely this time. "Wouldn't miss it."</p>

<p>We started walking down the street. It was only after a couple of
steps that our hands seemed to naturally find each other, our fingers
tangling, twining. We spent the rest of the afternoon pretending that
everything was all right. Buffy pretended like she wasn't about to be
grounded for the rest of her life and I pretended like I'd never met
Troy. Easier said than done but we managed. I think we did pretty
well too. Had some fun, had some laughs...what more could you ask for?</p>

<p>Oh right.</p>

<p>As soon as we walked into the house and closed the door behind us, I
looped an arm around Buffy's waist, pulling her back and hugging her
from behind. Now it was perfect.</p>

<p>She let out a sigh and relaxed into my chest. "I wish we could stay
like this forever," she whispered, tipping her head back to rest
against my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Who says we won't?" I brushed my lips down the span of her neck,
feeling the flutter of her pulse.</p>

<p>"No one --- but no one knows yet either."</p>

<p>I stopped, suddenly getting a nervous sensation in the pit of my
stomach. "Is that a problem?" I tried making the question sound like
it was no big deal but it sounded strained anyway.</p>

<p>She didn't say anything for a long moment. "I thought...I don't
know." She shook her head. "Don't you want them to know about us?" </p>

<p>I turned her around cause I wanted to see her. I wanted to know
exactly what she was thinking. The truth was, I hadn't really thought
about it until she'd bought it up. Hadn't had the the time. But there
wasn't that much to think about when you came right down to it. "This
is between you and me, B. If people know about us, that's fine. If
they don't, that's fine too cause the only thing that matters is what
we feel for each other."</p>

<p>"But my mom, Giles, Willow..."</p>

<p>"What about them?" I was starting to get irritated now. "How come it
always comes down to what other people think? Who gives a flying
fuck? Life's too damn short for all this crap. You should know that
more than anyone."</p>

<p>"What are you saying? You just want to ignore it?"</p>

<p>I gave her a look like 'why not'?</p>

<p>"it doesn't work that way, Faith. These people are our families, our
friends. They're not strangers." </p>

<p>I walked away, her words fading or maybe she just stopped talking.
Didn't really matter. I walked into the kitchen, reaching into the
fridge to get some OJ.</p>

<p>"What is this about anyway?" I asked after taking a big gulp, knowing
she had followed me in, knowing she was right behind me. "You want
them to know? Fine, we'll tell them. We'll do whatever you want. Will
that make you happy?"</p>

<p>"Why are you so mad?" She asked in a soft voice.</p>

<p>All the breath was knocked out of me then. No more anger or
irritation in the face of one simple question asked by someone who I
never wanted to upset. "I'm not mad," I said just as softly, turning
around and putting down the carton of juice near the sink. "I guess I
just don't want to think about it cause I already know how they're
going to take the news. I'm sorry, B. I didn't mean to take it out on
you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean you know? Faith, what do you think's going to
happen?"</p>

<p>I smirked, leaning back against the counter. "I can see it now, B.
Everybody would freak out. Then after the yelling and the same
questions being asked over and over, they'll say it's all a phase ---
something you'll grow out of. Oh, but hey, then they'll start to
realize this isn't a phase for skanky little Faith. She's just fucked
up like that. Shoulda seen it from the start, really. What were we
thinking? And who ends up getting her ass shipped off and labeled
a 'problem'? Give ya one guess."</p>

<p>"That's not going to happen."</p>

<p>I smiled, mostly at how much I wanted to believe her but I had more
experience in the shit hitting the fan than she did. "Only thing
different this time around is that I'm gonna hate it. I'm gonna hate
leaving." Even thinking about leaving Buffy put a sharp pain in my
chest like someone was squeezing my heart. This was a new experience
for me and not one I was liking all that much.</p>

<p>"You're not going to leave, Faith," she said again with an urgent
intensity burning in her eyes and taking my hands in a strong grip.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" I almost begged her to tell me something,
even if some part of my brain screamed at me that she was going to
tell me nothing but lies.</p>

<p>"I know it because I love you. I never knew I could feel like this
about *anyone*. It's feels like I'm burning up every time I'm with
you. Like I'm one of those shooting stars that blaze up in the sky.
And when I'm not with you, all I can think about is the time when I
can be with you again." She smiled, cocking her head to look at me
like I was something precious, something beautiful. "I don't care if
everybody disapproves. Where you go, I go."</p>

<p>I swallowed hard at her words, along with the look in her eyes which
told me I could trust her. "I don't think that's a promise you're
ready to make, B."</p>

<p>She leaned in, pressing her lips to mine. "Let me be the judge of
that, Faith."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I think maybe you should sit down for this, dad." He looked over at
me with a wary expression on his face as if he were expecting to be
hit but just didn't know when it was coming. His suitcase wasn't even
unpacked yet, he'd walked in the door not five minutes ago and now he
was being asked to sit down...I didn't know whether to feel more for
him or for me for having to tell him.</p>

<p>"Honey, is something wrong?" He asked, taking a seat on the recliner
and loosening the knot on his tie.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath, getting ready to spill everything but before I
could get a word in, Faith stepped from behind me and started
talking. At first, I didn't even know what she was saying but then it
became too clear.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Mr. Summers," Faith said. "Your car got stolen and
stripped because I wouldn't listen to Buffy and I took it out for a
drive two nights ago. She tried to stop me but I was acting stupid. I
reported it to the cops and they found it the next day but everything
valuable on it was gone."</p>

<p>"Faith, what are you doing?" I hissed, taking a hold of her arm. But
she wouldn't even look at me. </p>

<p>"B, stop," she said, her eyes downcast. "Stop trying to cover for me.
This is all my fault and I'm not going to let you lie for me. Not
this time."</p>

<p>"No, dad. This isn't...that isn't what happened." Dad wiped a hand
across his eyes like he was really tired. "Dad."</p>

<p>"This isn't the first thing I wanted to hear when I walked through
the door," he said, running a hand though his hair in a weary sign of
exactly how tired he was feeling. "Look, Faith. I don't really know
you as well as Joyce or Buffy might but this still comes as
a...complete surprise to me. I'm sure you thought you had a very good
reason to do this but for the life of me, I can't deal with this
right now." He stood up, barely glancing at either one of us. "I'm
going to call Joyce. Maybe it would be better if..." He let out a
sigh and started up the stairs, snagging his suitcase on the way. And
I heard him mutter something about hoping his insurance covered it
but that wasn't what I was focusing on anymore.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" I asked, spinning Faith around so we were
finally facing each other.</p>

<p>Her eyes were still focused somewhere off to my right. "Seemed like a
good idea at the time."</p>

<p>"Faith, stop joking about it. I'm being serious here."</p>

<p>"So am I, B," she said, her eyes coming up to flick across my
face. "But I won't let you take the heat for this one."</p>

<p>"You planned it all along?"</p>

<p>She smirked. "Trust me. I'm used to being seen as a screw up but
you're not. This is nothing to me, B." When I tried to object again,
she quickly placed a finger across my lips. "It's done. Hey, but at
least this vacation wasn't a total waste." She grinned happily at me
as if every problem revolving around us was nothing but smoke,
inconsequential and weightless.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't," I agreed, feeling myself getting lost in her liquid
brown eyes. Those same eyes turned and looked upstairs and when they
were sure my dad was no where in sight, Faith brushed her lips across
mine in a tender gesture that made me realize again the depth of her
feelings towards me. Nobody saw this side of her except me and I
suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to protect this sweet, vulnerable
girl in front of me who, to the rest of the world, might as well have
never existed.</p>

<p>My dad came down a couple of minutes later and basically told us to
pack our bags because we were going back to Sunnydale in the morning.
He told me I could stay if I wanted but there was no way I would, not
without Faith.</p>

<p>"I understand, Buffy," he said, giving me a weary grin. "I do but I
just wish this trip could have turned out differently."</p>

<p>"Me too, dad."</p>

<p>We made promises to 'do it again sometime' but the words all sounded
hollow. Not entirely lies but not entirely the truth either. I didn't
want to leave like this. Before I'd even come to LA, I had the whole
summer planned out but nothing had gone according to plan. We were
supposed to spend time together, have fun. Instead, we'd barely spent
a whole day in each other's company and the vacation was being
aborted not even halfway through. But Faith was right. It hadn't been
a total waste because she and I had finally admitted how we felt
about each other. And, so what if it'd taken a ton of liquor, the
aftereffects of a near death experience and a stolen car for it to
happen? The important thing was that it had happened.</p>

<p>All of my clothes had been neatly packed away when there was a soft
knock on my door and after a moment, Faith poked her head in.</p>

<p>"Hey, all packed?" She asked, looking over at my suitcases.</p>

<p>"Yep. Everything in its right place and all that."</p>

<p>"Cool." She sat down on the edge of my bed and I immediately went
over, sitting across her lap as she loosely wrapped me up in her
arms. "B, you know your mom better than anyone, right? What do you
think she'll be like on the punishment front?"</p>

<p>"The worse thing I've ever done was burn down the gym and you know
what she did after that."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that reminds me. Aren't you *still* grounded?" She asked,
quirking an eyebrow.</p>

<p>I leveled a stare at her and muttered, "I'd rather not think about
it, thanks." She gave me an apologetic grin. "But are you sure about
this Faith? You can still tell them the truth..."</p>

<p>"No, B. Don't worry about it. I'll be fine." Her words were supposed
to comfort me and I did feel relieved which only made me feel more
guilty than I already did. She was taking the rap for me...which
sounds funny even when I say it in my own head. But the point was,
she was going to get punished for something I did. "Hey," she said
softly, touching my cheek with the tips of her fingers. "You all
right? You got a spaced out expression there."</p>

<p>"I was just wondering how Willow and Xander were enjoying their
vacations," I said, not voicing what I was really thinking. Faith
just smiled at me and said nothing.</p>

<p>At an ungodly hour the next morning, the alarm clock sounded and
after a quick and awkward good-bye to my dad, Faith and I boarded a
cab to the bus station. We actually got there right on time so we
didn't have to sit around and wait which was great because otherwise,
I think we would have fallen asleep on the benches and missed the
bus. As it was, we fell asleep *on* the bus and I didn't wake up
until we were just entering Sunnydale. My head was pillowed on
Faith's shoulder and even through the dirty windows, I could see it
was going to be a great day, weatherwise anyway.</p>

<p>"Faith," I muttered, nudging her gently in the stomach. "Faith, we're
almost there." She moaned but other than that, didn't react. I sighed
and rested my head back on her shoulder since it didn't seem like she
was going to wake up until she felt like it. On the short way over to
the bus depot, I had time to think and brood over the fact that when
we got back home, we couldn't be as physical with each other as we'd
gotten used to anymore. It was almost as if my body was naturally
attracted to Faith and sometimes, I found my hands wandering to
places where, if my mom were to see, she'd definitely have a few
questions about.</p>

<p>Faith was still leery about what would happen if we were to come out
about our relationship and I had to agree that right now wouldn't be
the very best time to do so. But I wanted to touch her, I wanted to
kiss her, I wanted everyone to know that I loved her because she was
my girlfriend and not being able to do that was going to be pure hell.</p>

<p>When we climbed off the bus fifteen minutes later, mom was already
there waiting for us with a stony expression on her face. I knew it
was bad then. Whenever she was very upset like I knew she'd be now,
she would get that cool, intense look on her face. It was like the
calm before the storm and I flinched just thinking about how much
destruction and damage the storm would bring this time around. She
waited for us to get the bags but didn't say a word to us in the
meantime. </p>

<p>As soon as we got back to the house, mom said, "Buffy, why don't you
go unpack. I'd like to talk to Faith alone."</p>

<p>"But mom --" She cut me off with a look that could've given Medusa a
run for her money. I caught Faith's eye, trying to give her some
level of comfort. She gave me a wan smile back before I got my stuff
and climbed up the stairs as slowly as I could possibly get away
with. But I still couldn't catch any of the conversation that went on
between them. Several times as I was pacing back and forth in my
room, I felt like running downstairs and telling my mom that I was
the one that lost the car.</p>

<p>Around the two hundredth time I'd walked across my room, I heard the
muffled sound of footsteps coming up the stairs and then the door to
Faith's room opening and closing. At least it was over now. I opened
up my door, torn between seeing Faith right away and going downstairs
to see mom. But it was probably a good idea to give Faith some time
alone for a little while at least so I went downstairs. Mom was
sitting on the couch, her head in her hands.</p>

<p>"Mom?"</p>

<p>One eye peeked out and then her head rose as she gave me a tired
rendition of a smile. "Buffy, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You all right?" I moved closer.</p>

<p>She shrugged and rubbed two fingers across that spot on her right
temple which, to me, always indicated that she was near the end of
her rope. "Buffy...Faith told me what happened. I think she was
trying to do it in as few words as possible." She pinned me with that
patented gaze that I think all mothers learn, designed specifically
to extract information by exploiting mountains of guilt built up
since childhood. "Now, I want to hear it from you."</p>

<p>If I lied now, not only would I be lying to my mother but in some
way, I'd be betraying Faith too although it was essentially her idea
to begin with. This was just too unbelievably 'fucked up' as Faith
would say. "There's not really much to say," I mumbled, unable to
meet her eyes. "I'm sure you got pretty much the whole version from
Faith."</p>

<p>She didn't say anything in answer to my response and I risked looking
up to find that she had a faraway expression on her face. "Mom?" I
called out softly, not all that enthusiastic about breaking her away
from whatever trance she was in. When I got her attention back again,
I began pleading Faith's case. "I know she's sorry for what she's
done. Please don't be too hard on her."</p>

<p>She nodded but wouldn't say anything more on the subject. Instead,
she suggested rather pointedly that I go back to my room until she
called us down for lunch and, by then, I was more than ready to run.
When I reached the top of the stairs, the thought of going into my
own room seemed as distasteful a thought as eating lunch. Instead, I
walked right into Faith's bedroom and couldn't help the little grin
that popped onto my face as I saw her sprawled on her bed. And,
somehow, even in that utterly relaxed position, she still managed to
look sexy as hell.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Hard as it is to believe, being grounded wasn't something I was used
to. For one thing, before I got adopted, nobody really cared what I
did as long as I kept them in the dark about it. I think we all
bought into that whole philosophy about ignorance being bliss. But
now, that was all out the window cause I had people who actually
thought that what I did with my life was important and worth knowing.
So being grounded wasn't too bad. Just really boring cause,
basically, I wasn't allowed to do shit. </p>

<p>We'd been back for two weeks and I'd been cooped up for each and
every one of those fourteen days. Shit but that tends to wear on you
especially when there's nothing good to see on TV besides some goofy
ass soap opera. Even Jerry Springer was starting to get retarded. I
mean, you'd think the guests would use that one brain they share
between them and figure out that they're acting like total white
trash whores which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't act so surprised
every time their girlfriend/boyfriend/whatever told them they were
sleeping with their best friend(s)/relative/hooker. </p>

<p>And because I was grounded, I couldn't just go out and find the fun
whenever the hell I felt like it. I'd barely even seen Xander and
Willow since I got back which sucked big cause I kinda missed them.
Not like I'd ever say it though cause I'm what most people would call
emotionally fucked up. And it was getting real tired pushing Buffy to
go out with them instead of spending all her free time cooped up in
the house with me. It wasn't like I didn't want her around. It was
just that I didn't want her sharing the punishment with me when she
didn't have to. It made me feel guilty and I hated feeling guilty.</p>

<p>Cause if I really wanted to, I could've gone out. It wasn't like mom
was there to check up on me every minute of every day to make sure
that I was doing what I was supposed to be doing. But there was that
guilt thing again, making me stay the line --- even I didn't believe
it sometimes. When had I become responsible? You'd think I would've
noticed the change especially since it was me doing all the changing. </p>

<p>Anyway, the only times I went out was for a jog in the morning and an
occasional patrol at night. I'd convinced myself it was all business
but the truth was, not only was killing vamps my sacred duty as a
Slayer but it was fun too. Added bonus if you ask me. It's kinda like
a power rush. You're holding someone's life in your hands and you can
either let them go or kill them and since they're evil, not much of a
brain teaser there y'know. I keep telling myself it's not supposed to
be so much fun cause it's life and death, either mine or theirs but
shit...I guess I just like my job. At least I ain't gonna be one of
those disgruntled workers you read about who go to work and shoot up
their co-workers cause they feel that's the only way to get on the 11
o'clock news. Not like I have a lot of coworkers to begin with cause
it's all Buffy. Always will be if I have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>I shook myself out of the rambling daydream. Damn but I've been
having them way too often since coming back to Sunny D. There's just
something about this town that makes me want to retreat into my mind
and not come out until next year. Thankfully, I hear the lock turning
on the front door and I know that Buffy's home and at least, I'll
have someone to share the boredom with.</p>

<p>"Faith?"</p>

<p>"In here," I respond, smiling as I see her coming into view at the
entrance of the living room. But before she can even come in, there's
a loud knock on the front door. She turns to me with a quizzical
expression on her face and turns right back around to answer it. A
minute later, she comes back with two people following behind her. It
was a woman and a man but my attention wasn't so much on the guy as
riveted on this woman who looked so fucking familiar that it sucked
the breath right out of me like some goddamn vacuum cleaner had been
turned on in my chest. Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a
long ponytail. Her face was lightly made up but still beautiful in an
exotic sort of way which still showed through despite the little
wrinkles and crow's feet she was getting.</p>

<p>"Faith?" It comes out half question, half exclamation. This stranger,
looking at me with these big brown eyes and a tentative smile starts
taking baby steps towards me and then her bottom lip starts quivering
and the next thing you know she's bawling her eyes out, grabbing me
and using me like a giant handkerchief as she buries her face in my
chest. I look over the top of her head at Buffy, barely able to stop
from freaking out. Then I hear the woman muttering something and it
finally gets through to my brain that what she's saying over and over
again was "My baby." Whose baby? What baby? I'm the baby?</p>

<p>She finally pulls away enough to hold my face in between her hands,
staring at me with tears streaking down her cheeks. And all I can do
is stare blankly back.</p>

<p>"You--you don't know who I am," she almost whispers, her right hand
gently brushing my hair back. Her eyes start to cloud over again as
more tears leak out.</p>

<p>"Should I?" I take her hands in mine and push them away. This was
really starting to freak me out. A complete fucking stranger was
crying in my arms and she looked like she hadn't even begun to tap
the waterworks. I look over at Buffy again but she was just standing
there with her eyes darting back and forth between me and the
woman. "B," I say, snapping my fingers and carefully trying to move
away without making any sudden movements. But I couldn't even get a
foot away before the woman pulls me back, looking at me with such
intensity that I almost couldn't meet her eyes. That's when Buffy
walks next to me, resting her hand on my arm. The woman standing in
front of me doesn't even seem to notice as her eyes search mine...for
what, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>"Faith," she says again. "Faith, it's me...your mother."</p>

<p>I suck down a deep breath, trying to fight down the nausea that's
already turning my stomach around. I look at her looking at me and
all I can do is push her away as hard as I can. She would've fallen,
maybe even hurt herself if the man behind her hadn't caught her.</p>

<p>"Faith ---" she starts to say again, a stunned expression on her face.</p>

<p>"You're not my mother!" I shouted, hearing the blood thrumming in my
ears. "My mother is dead so unless you're a fucking ghost, you're not
her!" </p>

<p>She looked like she was going to cry again but instead she suddenly
got this hard look in her eyes and it was almost like I was staring
at a different person. It threw me for a second and then I didn't
have time to think about it as she started speaking again, this time
in a measured, even tone of voice. "That's a lie. You've been told
lies all your life but I'm standing right here in front of you. I
know you remember me, Faith. I saw it the moment I walked into this
room." She paused, probably waiting for me to say something but I
couldn't. I didn't know what to say. My brain was running in circles
trying to catch its own tail.</p>

<p>The man behind her then stepped forward with a supposedly reassuring
smile plastered on his skeezy mug. "I'm sure this is all a lot to
absorb coming as it is but there's really no other way around it." I
eyed him, in his thousand dollar suit, perfectly cut sandy hair, and
fake sympathetic expression which screamed 'trust me' and I knew he
was a lawyer --- a good one by the looks of it. "Sara really is your
mother. If you want proof, we can get you birth certificates, social
security cards, pictures of the two of you together with your
father..." He quirked an eyebrow, studying me like I was some sort of
puzzle. "There's really no doubt about it. The physical appearance
itself is startling to say the least."</p>

<p>"No." I shake my head. "This can't be true." But the words coming out
of my mouth sound hollow to my ears.</p>

<p>She steps up to me and her expression softens again. "But it is," she
says and almost makes as if to touch me again but I step backwards,
nearly bumping into the couch. "Faith, my little baby." And she
starts choking up, her hand wiping away the wetness from her
cheeks. "I never wanted to leave you...I'm so sorry baby."</p>

<p>"Wh--what do you want?" Buffy asks. It's almost like she doesn't even
realize she's doing it but she's putting herself between me and them.</p>

<p>My mother or whoever the crazy fuck was peels her eyes away from me,
giving Buffy a quick look. But before she can say anything, smarmy
lawyer guy smoothly cuts in. "We should really sit down and talk
about this, preferably over some coffee. It's really a pretty long
story. I know this must come as a shock to you, Faith but I think
you'd want to hear it."</p>

<p>I don't remember if I actually said yes to his idea but before I knew
it, we were all sitting in the living room with assorted drinks in
front of us like some perverted dream of a Norman Rockwell painting.
I was on the recliner and Buffy sat on the arm, lending me support by
just being close by. The other two were on the sofa. We'd been
sitting like that for a couple of minutes. The only sounds around the
house were the soft ticking of the clock and an occasional sip being
taken. When that...woman, Sara finally started talking, I almost
dropped the can of coke in my hand cause my nerves were pulled so
tight, I was on the edge of snapping.</p>

<p>"I was seventeen when I had you." Her head was down, staring into the
coffee mug which she had a death grip on. "I met your father and..."
She shrugged in weary acceptance. "We fell in love. He was so
different from anyone else I'd met in my life --- so attentive, so
loving, full of enthusiasm for life." I couldn't help smiling at the
memory of my father. To me, he was all that and much more. Nothing
could ever take those memories from me. "But as much as I loved him,
I hated what he turned out to be. It started out small. Just a little
betting on the side during the weekends on the games. Small time
stuff --- 10, 20 dollars. Then it became a hundred dollars, two,
three. Then he started spending more money than we had, more money
than we could have made in a year, five years. But by the time I
began noticing, it was too late."</p>

<p>"Yeah, he died," I interrupted harshly. I didn't need her telling me
about that cause I'd lived through it. Still did every fucking
night. "Now why don't you turn your Mother Goose storytelling ways
onto why you disappeared. If you didn't die, why did you abandon me?"
The last two words came out about as hard as I'd felt during all
those times when I got teased for being an orphan, having absolutely
nobody in the world I could call my blood.</p>

<p>"I didn't," she says, her bottom lip quivering. I give her a smirk
that showed her exactly what I thought about it but she didn't miss a
beat. "I had a mental breakdown. After I lost your father, I was left
all alone with a small child. There was no money, I had debts to pay
off, I didn't even have a job...I couldn't cope anymore. When one of
those men forced his way into the house demanding his money, I had no
choice. If I didn't stop him, he would've killed me. I don't remember
what happened after that but they say I killed him and they sent me
to this hospital. Whenever I asked them about you, they wouldn't tell
me anything."</p>

<p>"Sara's rights as a mother were stomped on," Lawyer guy added, taking
her hand in a pseudo-empathetic way. "And when they finally let her
out, she was coldly informed that her daughter has been under the
misconception that she's been dead all these years."</p>

<p>"And who the hell are you and what do you have to do with any of
this?" I narrowed my eyes at him, fed up with his greasy attitude.</p>

<p>"Faith, this is Howard," Sara butts in. "He helped me find you.
Actually..." A wide smile began spreading across her face, the first
genuinely happy smile I'd seen her give since she'd walked through
the door. "That's the other big shock I've got for you."</p>

<p>I quirked an eyebrow at her and murmured, "Like this wasn't enough of
a shocker. Well, don't keep me waiting 'mom'. Let's hear your uber
sedative-worthy news."</p>

<p>Her smile falters only slightly before she forges ahead like I hadn't
said anything. "I've met someone and we're going to get married." She
paused dramatically, probably to let the news sink its claws into my
brain. </p>

<p>"Congratulations," I said in a deadpan monotone.</p>

<p>"You're going to be very happy living with us from now on. I promise
you, Faith, I'll make everything up to you."</p>

<p>"Wait. Hold the fuck up!" I jump up and so does Buffy. "Please tell
me I didn't hear you right. Live with you? What are you still brain
dead? Did I say I wanted to live with you? Hell, up till today, I
didn't even know you were still alive and anyway, I've got a family
already. I don't want to go anywhere with you."</p>

<p>Her whole face falls but her voice as she continues to speak is rock
steady. "You're my baby, Faith. Even though you might not believe it
now, I'm doing what's best for you and us being together is what's
best for you. We're going to be a family again, Faith...a family."
The light blazing in her eyes makes me wonder if those guys in white
labcoats didn't let her out too early.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>This wasn't fair. </p>

<p>It was the total opposite definition of fair and if I wasn't so angry
right now, I'd dredge up the word from my brain and say it out
loud. "They can't make you do this," I said to Faith's back as I
paced back and forth across the width of her room.</p>

<p>"It's already done," came the soft response.</p>

<p>"Would you please stop packing?" I asked, stopping in the middle of
the room in a huff.</p>

<p>"I could but what's the point?" </p>

<p>I went over to her and forcibly took the shirt she was folding from
her hands. "I can't believe you're just going. You sound like you've
given up."</p>

<p>She looked at me for a couple of seconds, just looked at me with an
unbearably sad expression in her eyes. I had a momentary glimpse of
exactly what this was doing to her and I hated myself for making it
any worse than it already was by bitching about something that
neither one of us could change. Half worked out thoughts of running
away had been discussed almost desperately throughout the last two
days as we laid together in bed during the night but it was clear.
There was nothing we could do. We were the Slayers, two of the most
powerful women on the face of the earth and there was nothing we
could do against the legal system.</p>

<p>"B," Faith said, calling my attention back. She ran her fingers
lightly down my cheek, stopping briefly to trace my bottom lip with
her thumb before turning back to the bag on her bed. </p>

<p>I wrapped my arms around her waist, hugging her side to my chest and
resting my head on her shoulder. "I'm sorry. I know how hard this
must be for you." I heard her letting out a small sigh. "I just love
you so much and the thought of us not being together..." I stuttered
over the last couple of words. 'Not being together'. I couldn't even
imagine it without feeling my heart constrict painfully.</p>

<p>"How old am I, B?" </p>

<p>My head rose up at the unexpected question. "What? You're sixteen."</p>

<p>"Right, and I'll be seventeen in a couple more days. After that it's
only another year before I'm eighteen."</p>

<p>"And they can't tell you what to do anymore," I said, finally
realizing what she was trying to tell me.</p>

<p>"That's the plan." She turned around in my arms and wrapped her own
over my shoulders. "Look, B. There's nothing else we can get away
with. Believe me, if there was anything, I'd have done it by now. I
don't want to leave you, B. But --"</p>

<p>"I know," I said. "I know."</p>

<p>"So you think you can wait for a year?" Her expression told me I
didn't have to. That she wouldn't hold it against me if a year was
too long a time for me to wait for her to come back. But it was about
time I set her straight about what I thought about that particular
option. </p>

<p>"If I had to, I'd wait forever."</p>

<p>She smiled almost shyly as if she couldn't quite bring herself to
believe what I said but then eventually, she seemed to accept it and
leaning in, she brought her lips to mine and kissed me. It was a
desperate kiss, one that was shared by two people who knew their time
together was slowly ticking away. But underneath all that, there was
always the promise, the hope that there would be an 'us' somehow or
another. And it was that which I sought now, almost frantically in my
haste.</p>

<p>She let me take control. Allowed me to touch her wherever I wanted
and when she pulled away, I saw that she had her eyes screwed tightly
shut. I placed feather light kisses across her lips which were a bit
swollen from our previous go. Eventually, she opened her eyes which
were watery and so full of pain that I ached to put an end to it. She
turned away without another word, going back to packing her bag which
was almost full already.</p>

<p>"You mind if I just leave the trophy here?" She asked, pulling the
zipper closed. "It's kinda too much hardware to be lugging around.
And, anyway, I'll be back soon." I almost lost it right there, my
eyes straying to the trophy sitting on the floor which Faith had won
a couple of months ago from her first meet. "It'll be all right, B,"
she said, picking up the bag from her bed and walking towards the
door. "See me out?" She gave me a weak smile, her hand poised on the
doorknob.</p>

<p>We walked downstairs and the mood between us was almost like we were
in mourning. Maybe we were. It certainly felt like an appropriate
situation for black attire. Mom came up to us and gave Faith a big
hug and I could hear her trying to choke down the sobs. She'd tried
everything she could but Sara and Howard had already beaten us by
five steps in the legal department. Her adoption papers were revoked
and there was nothing she could do about it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to miss you, Faith," she said, separating enough to look
at her.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Faith said and, for the first time I heard her voice
cracking over the words. "Thanks for everything, mom."</p>

<p>We walked outside where a car was already parked with a driver I
didn't recognize standing beside it. He took the bag from Faith's
hand without even being asked and put it in the trunk. Faith turned
to me one last time and grabbed me, hugging me to her as hard as she
could and whispered "I love you" into my ear. The tears were rolling
down my cheeks with abandon by the time she broke away and got into
the car's back seat.</p>

<p>I watched the car pull away with mom's arm wrapped protectively
around my shoulders. "It'll be all right, Buffy," she said,
inadvertently echoing Faith's earlier words. "I'm sure after she gets
settled down, she'll call..." I watched until the car turned a corner
and disappeared from view. I turned to mom and she pulled me into a
hug.</p>

<p>But it didn't make me feel better. I knew nothing would until Faith
was back again.</p>

<p>All I had to do was wait a year. </p>

<p>She'd promised that she'd come back to me and I knew she'd keep her
word. </p>
