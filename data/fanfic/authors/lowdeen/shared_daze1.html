<p>//Clothes strewn across the floor with a wholly random, careless air.
Shirts peeled off so fast and with so much violence that a button
would be found missing later. Pants crumpled in a heap next to shoes
that stood on its side.</p>

<p>All the discarded apparel formed a loose trail leading from the door
to the bed.</p>

<p>Flesh touching flesh.</p>

<p>Moans stifled. Breath short and heavy.</p>

<p>Hot mouths moving over sweat covered skin. Tongues flicking off salty
sweet moisture, tasting, drinking rolling desire.</p>

<p>Screams swallowed, muffled.</p>

<p>Desires flared, sated, shared.//</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I pressed my lips against the back of her shoulderblade, settling my
head against her back. I could still smell 'us' in the air. A musky
reminder of what we'd done hanging like a curtain over everything,
making me hug her tighter against my skin, hearing her breathe out a
soft breath of air.</p>

<p>"Faith," I whispered her name, forming the single syllable lovingly
with my tongue. "I love you," I breathed out with a gentle
exhalation, feeling her fingers running lightly over mine which were
wrapped around her waist.</p>

<p>I didn't expect an answer and I didn't receive one. But I had to say
it anyway because the feeling ran so deeply within me that it felt
like it was pounding a hole through my heart. It was summer already
and it seemed like senior year had flew by in a blur. Graduation had
come and gone with all the requisite pomp and circumstance. Caps,
gowns, diplomas...the whole ceremony had gone surprisingly smoothly.
And when I say surprising, I was referring to the lack of a demon or
vampire interrupting the festivities. In Sunnydale, you have to be
grateful for small favors like that.</p>

<p>My eyes slipped shut and my mind began closing up shop when the phone
next to the bed suddenly rang, loudly snapping me awake and eliciting
a muffled curse from Faith who picked the receiver up with a
gruff "Hello?" A pause. "What?" Pause. "Wait, no hold up..." A sigh
and then she hung up.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" I asked, snuggling into her back.</p>

<p>"Xander," she said irritably. "He's coming over."</p>

<p>I groaned, burying my face into a pillow as Faith sat up, getting off
the bed. "What time is it? Why is he coming over now?" I asked,
peeking out with one eye and letting my gaze slide lazily along
Faith's lithe frame. She turned her head, caught me looking at her
and gave me a lopsided smile as she began picking up clothes off the
floor.</p>

<p>"Better get dressed, B," she said, tossing me my shirt. "You're gonna
give Xander a heart attack if you don't."</p>

<p>I groaned again but took the shirt and began putting it on. My arm
was barely through one sleeve when Faith suddenly crawled onto the
bed, capturing my lips and kissing me hard, her tongue invading my
mouth, sweeping across my own, dominating and submissive at the same
time as she let me pull her closer.</p>

<p>Her eyes danced as she pulled back, softening as she continued
looking at me. "Better get a move on," she said in a throaty purr,
getting off the bed once again as she headed outside.</p>

<p>I sat dazed for a second before shaking it off, feeling a goofy smile
beginning to form on my face. I continued dressing, finding that the
second to first button on my shirt didn't seem to be there anymore
and for some unfathomable reason, I found that amusing. It might have
just been the gloriously good mood that I'd found myself in for the
last few hours. Whatever the reason, I almost skipped down the stairs
a few minutes later, just in time to hear the doorbell ring.</p>

<p>"Hey Buff," Xander said as soon as I opened the door. "We bought
doughnuts," he said, brushing past me with Willow and Cordelia
following behind him.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" I asked, closing the door behind them. "Is
something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think something's wrong?" Willow asked, turning her head
to ask me before disappearing into the living room.</p>

<p>"Well...you're all here," I said, scrunching up my brows as I
followed after them. "Not that I'm not glad to see you guys
but..well, why are you here?" I asked again, looking at them already
settled onto the couch, the bag of doughnuts quickly disappearing.</p>

<p>"I'm here because I was bored out of my skull at home," Cordelia
said, picking at her doughnut instead of just eating it like a normal
person. "I'm not sure if it'll be any more exciting around here. I
doubt it," she shrugged. "But I'm already here so, whatever."</p>

<p>I looked over at Xander again, annoyed that he had to bring Cordy
along with him. It seemed like their love-hate relationship was
leaning more towards the love side after all these years although the
fact that they were in a relationship at all kind of blindsided me.
Xander looked at me apologetically before taking a big bite out of
his doughnut. Willow surreptitiously rolled her eyes. I knew she
didn't get it either but her long time crush on Xander aside, she
seemed to have taken the whole thing in stride. Of course, that might
have had something to do with Oz. They really were the cutest couple
alive, and if not that, they were definitely runner ups in the
category.</p>

<p>"This is the last summer we're going to have together before we step
into the uncharted territories of being a grown up," Xander quipped,
wiping his mouth with a napkin. "I think we should use every last
moment wisely."</p>

<p>I openly smirked because he had been acting all nostalgic since
graduation. "You sound like we're about to take a step off a high
cliff without a parachute."</p>

<p>"And we're not?" He asked, raising an eyebrow. "Trust me Buff. When
we're all old and pruney, we'll look back on this as the last summer
of our lost innocence."</p>

<p>"Who lost their innocence?" Faith asked, coming into the room to
stand beside me.</p>

<p>I turned to look at her, feeling the goofy grin making its
reappearance on my face. "Nobody," Xander sputtered, almost choking
on his next bite. "Hey Faith," he said, trying to smile and cough at
the same time. We all turned to look at him strangely which only made
him duck his head and blush.</p>

<p>She took a seat on the armrest as I grabbed a doughnut and grabbed a
seat on her lap. I reached back, letting her take a bite out of it
before eating it myself. She wrapped a loose arm around my waist and
placed a sticky kiss on my cheek. "Stop that," I said, laughing
softly as I elbowed her playfully in the stomach.</p>

<p>"If you guys get any cuter, I might get a cavity," Cordy drily
commented.</p>

<p>"Aww, don't be jealous Queen C," Faith shot back with a smirk. "Or
aren't you getting enough from Xander?"</p>

<p>Cordelia's mouth snapped shut as she glared in our direction but
Faith acted totally oblivious, guiding my hand to her mouth so she
could get another bite. She licked the crumbs off her lips in a
clearly sensuous display which made me almost lean in to take a lick
myself and she must have known what I was thinking because she looked
up at me with a wicked smile gracing her face. But as soon as the
smile appeared, it was gone just as soon...like it always was. </p>

<p>"So who's up for doing something?" Xander asked, putting an end to
the silence that I didn't even notice had settled on the room until
it was broken. When nobody answered immediately, he added, "Come on,
guys. We've done nothing for the last week. Aren't you bored?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?" I asked, my good mood dampened just
slightly.</p>

<p>His wide smile was infectious as he paused dramatically. "Miniature
golf," he finally said, sitting back with his arms folded against his
chest and a satisfied expression on his face.</p>

<p>There were four raised eyebrows in the room, greeting his
pronouncement. "You've gotta be kidding me, X," Faith finally
said. "That's what you come up with for fun? I'd rather be facing off
against five vamps with my hands tied behind my back."</p>

<p>"It's not all bad," Xander protested, sitting up to defend his sport
of choice. "It's a game of skill, of strategy ... and you get to play
with a colored ball."</p>

<p>"I think I'll pass," she said, lifting me off her lap as she got up
and stretched. "Let me know how it turns out though," she said,
walking out of the room and back upstairs.</p>

<p>I wasn't much up for miniature golf either, much rather preferring to
stay home with Faith but Xander was so persistent that I finally just
went along with them. But Xander was right about one thing. It *was*
nice that we still had the summer together. And it was also nice that
none of us were planning on going away for college --- well, I'm not
sure if Xander's going to college at all. He was still kind of
reluctant talking about it, making it sound like it was his decision
not to go but you could tell that wasn't really the truth.</p>

<p>We all got a ball and a club as we started out on the first hole. My
ball was pink and I could already guess what Faith would say if she
saw me holding a pink ball.</p>

<p>"You're thinking about Faith again."</p>

<p>"What?" I looked up to see Willow watching me with a knowing grin on
her face. "Uh, yeah. I guess I was."</p>

<p>"Well, duh," Cordy said, holding her blue ball between thumb and
forefinger. "When is she *not* thinking about her Slayer?" She asked
dismissively.</p>

<p>"Well, I think it's sweet," Willow argued. I kind of felt
uncomfortable, what with them discussing me and Faith like this. It
sounded too much like they were gossiping about me while I was
standing right in the middle. "They're perfect for each other, don't
you think?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>Cordelia made a noise that I think signified partial
agreement. "Ladies, how about we start playing?" Xander asked,
breaking in. "There are eighteen holes just waiting for us to conquer
them."</p>

<p>Cordelia went up next as she put her ball on the rubber pad and sized
up her shot. "Buffy," Willow asked, getting my attention. "Do you
think Faith's acting kind of distant lately. You know ... ever since
she got back?" I turned my eyes away, focusing on the artificial
green of the course as I thought about the answer I was going to
give. Of course I'd noticed. And I knew exactly where that distance
had come from. But I wasn't going to talk about it, especially not
while playing miniature golf.</p>

<p>"She's just trying to get back into the groove of things," I said
with a forced smile. "It'll just take a little time." I guess my
answer must have satisfied her because she nodded like she understood.</p>

<p>"I think I know what it is," Xander interjected with a serious
expression.</p>

<p>My heart sped up a little as I looked at him, my brows
furrowing. "What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's because you're going to be starting college in the fall and
she's still going to be in High School ... Buffy, you're going to be
dating a high school student," he covered his mouth with one hand as
a goofily shocked expression appeared on his face.</p>

<p>"When he gets like that," Cordelia advised, "Just smack him."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's my name. Sometimes, I wondered if my parents were
playing some kind of joke on me when they named me that cause as far
as I can tell, whenever I do scrape together a nickel's worth of it,
I get it thrown back in my face. And it's not like I'm trying to
throw a pity party and invite myself as the honored guest. It's just
the truth of my life.</p>

<p>I had faith in my dad. I had faith that he would be there for me
whenever I needed him, that he wouldn't die in front of my eyes,
beaten to death by his bookies ... but he did. I know he couldn't
help dying but shit, the fact was that he'd left me all alone. And he
could've changed if he wanted to, if not for himself, then for his
family. But that was just ancient history, stuff I can't change,
couldn't have changed no matter how much I wanted.</p>

<p>And after that I got passed from one home to another. At first, I
didn't know any better. I actually let myself get attached, let
myself trust them, let myself have faith. And then what happened?
Same shit each and every time. I got my ass shipped off time after
time so after while, I smartened up and walled myself off, didn't let
myself feel for anyone cause the way I figured, they'd only leave me
sooner or later.</p>

<p>That kept going on until I finally met Buffy. For the first time in a
long time, I put all my faith in her, let my walls down, told her
things I never would've told anyone else. And guess what? That's how
I got hurt again. And this time, hurting wasn't even the right word
for what I felt. It was like I'd died and my body was somehow still
walking around as if it hadn't gotten the memo yet. I didn't like
dwelling on that for too long though cause I'd just end up feeling
like I had to smash something to feel better. And if I did that, half
the furniture in the Summers' home would need to be replaced.</p>

<p>But then something amazing started happening. Well, not amazing
exactly but it seemed like that to me. Things actually got better ...
took a while but the pain started to dull. It wasn't gone, still
there lurking in the background but it was better.</p>

<p>That didn't mean everything was back exactly to the way they were
cause every time I looked at Buffy, I felt like I had to look away.
If I looked away then she couldn't see me. If she couldn't see me,
then she couldn't hurt me. Damn, that sounds insane even in my own
mind but I can't help it. Whenever I see Buffy, logic and commonsense
take a hike and all I'm left with are all these 'feelings' I don't
know how to deal with.</p>

<p>I can see that it hurts her when I act like this. Fuck, it hurts me
too. It hurts like hell that every time I look at my girlfriend, all
I can see is her kissing another guy. It tears me up when I can't
even tell her that I love her without the words catching in my throat
and silence coming out of my mouth instead. And I *do* love her. More
than anyone else in my life. And that's what makes it hurt so goddamn
much.</p>

<p>So instead of hanging with her and Willow and Xander and Cordy, I'm
by myself, alone in the cemetery, sitting on someone's gravestone.
How fucking pathetic is that, huh? I know the only way things can go
back to the way they were is if I let myself open up to her again,
let myself trust her again. Basically, I had to put my faith in her
and live up to my name despite all that had happened. </p>

<p>If I loved her like I knew I did, a little voice was saying in the
back of my head, then I should start doing something about it before
I totally screwed up what we had. After a few seconds, I hopped off
the stone marker and walked out of the cemetery before I had time to
second guess myself. Fifteen minutes later, I was standing outside
Sunnydale's mini golf course, pacing back and forth in front of the
entrance.</p>

<p>What was I afraid of, I kept asking myself. This is stupid. I should
just go in there.</p>

<p>And I did ... after another ten minutes.</p>

<p>I scanned the courses and saw them on the twelfth green. I walked
over, trying not to look like I was hurrying even though I was.
Willow was the first to spot me and she waved, a big grin on her
face. I smiled back, not entirely sure why there was a queasy feeling
at the pit of my stomach as I kept getting closer. Maybe it was the
way Buffy was looking at me with that soft, concerned expression on
her face. It made me feel that someone like me really didn't deserve
someone like her. </p>

<p>"Hey," I said, giving a nod to everyone, my eyes flitting over their
faces but never staying put for more than a second. "Who's winning?"</p>

<p>"Xander is --- by two strokes," Willow said. </p>

<p>I nodded like I actually cared and just hoped I didn't look like I
was about ready to jump out of my skin. My palms were sweating and I
shoved them into my pants' pockets. Why the fuck couldn't I just take
Buffy aside and talk to her? Cause that's really what I wanted to do -
-- not stand here like an idiot with my mouth shut and their eyes on
me.</p>

<p>"So what's up Faith?" Xander asked. "Have you finally come to your
senses and realized that miniature golf is where it's at?" </p>

<p>"Uh, no..." I kept standing there as they kept staring at me waiting
for me to say more. What was I doing here? I thought everything would
be all right but it wasn't. I thought that as soon as I saw her, I'd
know what to say, know what to do but I didn't. Fuck, I couldn't even
meet her eyes without flinching.</p>

<p>Then she was next to me, standing mute by my side and I knew she was
just waiting for me to make the first move but like every other time
before, I couldn't speak --- not that I didn't want to, I just ...
*couldn't*. And it made me feel like I was some sort of dummy with a
painted mouth on my face that didn't actually work cause it was only
there for show.</p>

<p>"Okay then," Xander said with forced enthusiasm as he clapped his
hands together, going back to concentrate on hitting his ball into
the hole at the other end of the green. Willow and Cordy turned their
heads to watch him. I don't think they were actually that interested
in his game, more like they wanted to turn away from the train wreck
that was about to happen behind them.</p>

<p>"Do you want to take a walk?" Buffy softly asked from my side. I
slowly nodded, not really wanting to move but definitely not wanting
to stay there either. She gave her club and ball to Willow and I
noticed them sharing a look before she turned back towards me. I
wondered as we walked slowly out of the park if they'd talked ---
talked about this shit between Buffy and me. Now that I thought about
it, I figure they must have. They're best friends and they were both
heavily into the share and care mode.</p>

<p>And it's not like it bothers me that they talk to each other about
personal stuff. It's just that now, it's got me wondering. I shot a
quick look at her from the corner of my eye and she was staring
straight ahead, a blank expression on her face. She's a pretty hard
read when she doesn't want to be read and I guess this was one of
those times.</p>

<p>"You think this is really working anymore?" I seriously don't know
where that came from. I know I must've said it cause it was my voice
filling out the silence but those words just totally came out of
nowhere.</p>

<p>She stopped walking, making me come to a stop too. I turned to look
at her and I knew I was fucked when I saw the hard edge that'd come
into her eyes. Maybe I'd finally pushed her too far, made her realize
what a fuckcase she had on her hands.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to say, Faith?" She asked in a soft voice that
was a hell of a lot more dangerous than any growling, snarling vamp
could ever hope to be.</p>

<p>"You know what I'm saying. *This*. *Us*. It ain't working!" What the
fuck was going on? I couldn't be saying this, could I?</p>

<p>... But I was. And, who knows, maybe I needed to say it cause it was
coming out whether I wanted it to or not.</p>

<p>She didn't say anything for the longest time, making me fidget as I
waited for the big blow up that I was sure was gonna happen. If it
was me, it would've happened already.</p>

<p>But she didn't shout or scream or yell. Instead, she lowered her eyes
and said in a tired voice, "I don't know what else you want me to do,
Faith. I've told you what happened. I've told you I love you ... you
*know* I do. But you won't let yourself trust me and I don't know
what else to do." Her shoulders were slumped as her eyes found mine
again.</p>

<p>I bit my lower lip, feeling the pain like a friend who'd been bumming
too long on your couch. She wanted me to say something. Probably
waiting for me to tell her how to make it better but I didn't know
where to start. "Maybe I'm just not the relationship type," I finally
said, looking away. </p>

<p>"Do you want an easy way out?" She asked, her voice rising with each
word. "Fine, you're off the hook. If anybody asks, you can just tell
them it was all my fault --- that I messed up." She turned on her
heel, quickly walking away from me. </p>

<p>I had to ask myself what had happened as I stared after her. I'd come
here to work it out with her cause I didn't want our relationship to
get stomped on. And I end up stomping on it myself. I wanted to run
after her but I just stayed there like there were roots growing out
of my feet. I stayed there, staring in the direction she'd gone off
to for a few minutes before turning and walking in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>That somehow brought me to a park and I figured it was as good a
place as any to waste some time. I sat on one of those little horses
with the spring under it and just rocked up and down ... back and
forth ... side to side. </p>

<p>I couldn't tell you how long I stayed there, trying to pretend like I
was a kid again, all innocence, with no worries in the world and
nothing hanging over my head like a fucking black cloud. In the end
though, it didn't work cause I still felt dirty. I'd screwed up. </p>

<p>Yet again, I've screwed up, fucked up, messed up, whatever upped. All
I had to do was place my trust in her again, let her see me ... the
whole me without being scared that I was fixing myself up for another
fall. But from what had taken place so far, it didn't look like it
was gonna happen for shit.</p>

<p>And who should show up when I was feeling my lowest low? The fucker
who'd made me feel this low in the first place.</p>

<p>Angel.</p>

<p>I got off the horse, cracked my knuckles and smiled cause this was
the first really good thing that'd happened to me the whole fucking
day.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I didn't go back miniature golfing. I just wasn't up to a night of
forced fun after what had happened.</p>

<p>And I had to wonder. Was that it? Had we broken up? How can you break
up with someone who you're still in love with, who you know is still
in love with you? How do you just shut yourself off like that?</p>

<p>I turned down one of the main streets in Sunnydale, passing by too
many groups of smiling, laughing people and in the mood I was in, I
wondered sourly what they had to be so happy about. I stopped at a
brightly lit store front window and stared in at the display which
happened to be a mannequin dressed in leather. I could definitely
picture Faith in that leather. She would look hot too --- of course,
she always looked hot and that wasn't just the girlfriend in me
speaking.</p>

<p>Maybe I was being too hard on her. Maybe I just had to give her more
time and be there for her when she needed me ... maybe, I should grow
a damn backbone because I deserved better than to be treated like a
lover one minute and an enemy the next. I blew out a frustrated sigh
at all the different directions my thoughts were taking.</p>

<p>I remembered the first time we had made love. It had been right after
the prom. We had actually skipped most of it because Faith had looked
like she'd wanted to bolt the moment she stepped through the doors to
the gym. We were still trying to get comfortable around each other at
the time and I didn't want to push her if she didn't want to stay.</p>

<p>So we drove around for a little while after that and somehow we ended
up at a motel thirty minutes later ...</p>

<p>After that, I thought everything would get better. I thought we would
get closer again but we didn't. There was still that distance between
us that we couldn't bridge ... that she *wouldn't* bridge and nothing
I could say, nothing I could do would close that space unless she
wanted it to close. And, obviously, she wasn't ready yet.</p>

<p>Turning away from the display, I walked aimlessly down the street
again. I didn't know what to do and I wondered if I shouldn't just
leave it that way for the time being because that was what it all
came down to --- time. We had to give each other that.</p>

<p>When I got home, all the lights were already out so that meant mom
was asleep. I crept up the stairs, trying to use the Slayer stealth
to my advantage and hesitated outside Faith's door which still had a
light under it. Time, right? I said I'd give it time and that's just
what I would do. But I didn't move and I found my hand was slowly
reaching out to the doorknob. Hey, what could it hurt to apologize
for my outburst earlier? That's all I would do. And then I'd let time
do its thing ... yeah, that's it.</p>

<p>I pushed the door in and the first thing my eyes settled on was the
bed where Faith was half sitting, half lying on.</p>

<p>"Faith?" I hurriedly closed the door and went to stand next to her.
There were icepacks on her right knee, one on her left hand and what
looked like a shiner on her right eye. All in all, she looked like
she had just gone twelve rounds with a vampire and lost. "What
happened?"</p>

<p>She turned her head, refusing to look into my eyes so I reached out a
hand and tilted her face back. "You should've seen the other guy,"
she said with a cocky grin that lacked any of its usual mischievous
attitude.</p>

<p>"Who *was* the other guy?" I asked, perching carefully on the side of
the bed.</p>

<p>"Some vamp," she said, adjusting the pack on her hand. And from the
tone alone, I knew she was leaving out something important. Faith was
never the best liar.</p>

<p>"Faith, who was the vamp?" I asked again, already knowing the answer
but just needing to hear it from her.</p>

<p>She just looked at me with a placid look on her face, not saying
anything at all. "Why?!" I shouted, jumping off the bed as I stared
down at her. I noticed her wince a little at my sudden movement but
she immediately recovered.</p>

<p>"Why do you think?" She asked, her eyes narrowing in contempt. "In
case you didn't hear it the first thousand times, B, the guy's a
fucking vampire. What would you have liked me to do? Invite him to a
tea party and serve him punch and pie?"</p>

<p>"You know that's not the real reason you did it."</p>

<p>"What? You're reading my mind now?"</p>

<p>I turned around quickly to stop myself from saying anything I was
just going to regret the minute it would leave my mouth but I had to
clamp down hard on the urge. I took a few seconds to calm down before
turning around and sitting down again. "Do you feel better now?" I
finally asked, holding onto the ice on her knee so it wouldn't keep
slipping off.</p>

<p>"Some parts feel better than others," she admitted in a quiet voice,
giving me a smirk which I couldn't help returning even though I knew
I shouldn't. "Don't worry, he's not dust yet," she added, almost as
if she were regretting that very fact.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>She snorted out a bitter laugh as she turned her eyes away. "How the
fuck should I know? If it was up to me, he'd still be laying
unconscious in the park when the sun comes up."</p>

<p>"You *left* him there?" I knew she did. I just couldn't believe she
had.</p>

<p>She turned back to stare at me, her eyes unreadable and cold. "You
want to help him? Just leave."</p>

<p>I stared back. I knew what this was --- if I left, whatever hopes I
still had for our relationship would fizzle out. Maybe they wouldn't
completely die but it would be so much harder to patch things up like
I'd wanted. If I didn't go, I would be knowingly abandoning someone I
still thought of as a friend, someone who had risked his own life to
save mine on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Was there even a choice in the end?</p>

<p>I turned away and left the room, silently closing the door behind me.
There were no words. Nothing from her saying I shouldn't leave,
nothing from me to say I'd be back. And as I left the house, I felt
like something had changed which couldn't be fixed. Pessimistic,
wasn't I? But Faith is Faith. And Faith isn't a person who bends
easily. She doesn't forgive. It just wasn't in her nature.</p>

<p>I walked to the park, every step of the way making me want to turn
right around and go back. What I want and what I have to do --- it
seems like I've had that quandary my whole entire Slayer life. It
comes par for course, I guess. When you have to protect the world and
maintain a life at the same time, some things are just bound to
clash. And where did that leave me now? In the land of uncertainty
where I've had a lot of vacation time lately.</p>

<p>When I finally got to the park, it wasn't too hard to spot Angel. For
one thing, he was lying in the middle of the park, under the swing
sets, unmoving and deadly still.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" I asked, my voice cutting through the silence
like a knife as I stood above him, staring down at his opened eyes
which were staring unblinking up into the sky.</p>

<p>His eyes slowly tracked towards me and blinked before he answered in
a tight voice, "I'm fine."</p>

<p>"I can see that," I said, bending down to help him sit up. </p>

<p>He groaned, grabbing onto his stomach as he looked at me from under
his brows. "I guess you know what happened," he said, gritting his
teeth and trying to look tough.</p>

<p>I shrugged, neither denying or concurring with it. "Let me see," I
said instead, pulling his shirt up to look at the wound despite his
weak protests. His whole front side, as far as I could tell, was a
mish mash of black and blue marks.</p>

<p>"It's not as bad as it looks," he said, hastily pulling his shirt
back down. I didn't have the energy to argue with him. If he said he
was fine, I was just going to take him at his word. I went over to
one of the swings, sitting down heavily on the seat as I rested my
forehead on one of the chains.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean for it to happen," I heard him say. "I just wanted to
explain what happened to her."</p>

<p>"Let me guess," I chuckled humorlessly. "She wasn't in the mood to
listen."</p>

<p>I was met with silence as he picked himself painfully off the ground
and sat down on a swing next to me. We sat there for a few minutes
until he broke the silence with a soft admission. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"For what?" I asked, not because I was curious but because that's
what you're supposed to say to be polite.</p>

<p>He didn't seem to mind my lack of interest as he answered. "When I
kissed you, I didn't know that you two were ... "</p>

<p>"You couldn't have," I said, feeling like we'd been here before. "I
never told you, Angel. How could you have known? So stop blaming
yourself. And, in the future, if you feel the need to talk to Faith
about this, to square it away with her? Don't."</p>

<p>He nodded, scuffing his shoe on the ground. "Is she okay?" He asked
in a guilty voice.</p>

<p>I pulled the swing back, tucking my legs up slightly as I swung
gently, the wind ruffling my hair across my face. "I think you're in
worse shape than she is," I finally said, aiming a teasing half grin
in his direction. He returned it uncertainly and then ducked his head
back to stare at the ground. We stayed like that for a long time. I
don't think either one of us really wanted the peaceful mood that had
somehow developed between us to disappear just yet and we stubbornly
clung to it even as it faded away with each passing minute. </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"What the fuck are you doing here?" It was too early in the morning
to be seeing Cordelia in the kitchen, looking at me with her
usual 'you're lower than dirt' stare. </p>

<p>"I suppose that's the type of greeting I should come to expect from
you," she said, not giving me a second glance as she turned back to
the magazine on the counter. As I passed by, I snuck a peak over her
shoulder and saw that it was flipped open to one of those stupid
girlie polls in one of those stupid girlie magazines.</p>

<p>I opened up the fridge and asked, "Do you feel your brain dripping
stupid when you read that trash?" I was just trying to start a
conversation but she kind of saw it as me making fun of her so she
stomped out of the room in a big huff. And then, as if that weren't
bad enough, I started feeling bad for dumping my bad mood on her.
What had she done to me anyway? Nothing ... much.</p>

<p>"Hey," I said, going into the living room where she'd parked herself
on the couch. "Sorry about that. I didn't mean to be so bitchy." She
didn't even look at me, pretending like I wasn't even in the room.
And she was doing a pretty good job of it too. Seeing as she *was*
one of the popular kids, maybe it came from all the practice she got
in at ignoring people.</p>

<p>'Was' is the operative word though cause ever since she'd hooked up
with Xander, her points have been free falling. I still didn't know
how those two happened. They'd probably win the prize if there were a
contest calling for the unlikeliest couple. I sat down heavily next
to her, taking a swig from the glass of OJ in my hand.</p>

<p>"So where is everybody?" I asked, trying not to show too much
curiosity at the question. Aside from sitting down at dinner, I
hadn't seen Buffy for a week and I was kinda starting to miss her.
Okay, I was probably way past the missing stage.</p>

<p>"They went somewhere," she said, crossing her legs and staring
straight ahead at the turned off television. </p>

<p>"Uh huh."</p>

<p>She whipped her head around, pinning me with an angry stare. "What is
that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>I quirked an eyebrow. What crawled up her butt and died? "It means,
uh huh," I said slowly, pronouncing the two syllables with a hard
edge. She didn't say anything and we spent a couple of seconds just
trying to stare each other down.</p>

<p>I finally just decided that I'd had enough and I was starting to get
up when she reached out an arm and pulled me down, almost sloshing my
orange juice onto my lap. "Hey!"</p>

<p>"Sorry," she said, her hand going to steady the glass in my hand and
the apology actually sounded halfway decent this time.</p>

<p>"So you wanna start over?" I asked as she pulled her hand away. At
her faint nod, I added, "Good. So, how are you this morning, C?" </p>

<p>She pushed herself up, crossing her arms and looking at everything
but me. "We had an argument again. Nothing new." I didn't have to ask
who she was talking about. Who else but Xander could get under her
skin so much. "And as usual, nobody sees my side of it," she went
on. "I don't even know how we lasted this long without killing each
other."</p>

<p>"I can't either," I muttered under my breath, grinning as innocently
as I could as she turned an icy stare at me. Pausing, I
said, "Sometimes, we can't help who we love."</p>

<p>"Did you get that out of a fortune cookie?" she asked, leaning back
against the couch. But it didn't come out as biting as it could
have. "Is that what's going on between you and Buffy?" She asked,
studying me from the corner of her eye. I could tell she was curious
more than anything else but it wasn't like this was something I
wanted to be thinking about cause if I did, it'd just make me feel
like shit. Like I wasn't feeling enough of that lately.</p>

<p>"Whatever's going on between me and B is between me and B." I caught
what looked like a hurt expression flashing across her face before
she composed her features again. Shit, sometimes, I forgot that
Cordelia was actually a human being so, intentionally softening my
words, I added, "But I still love her ... maybe too much."</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh that was this side of melodramatic. "Hey, Faith?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>She looked at me, her mouth opening but nothing coming
out. "Nothing," she finally said, turning her head away. Now that's
strange --- Cordelia having nothing to say but I didn't push it. I
gulped down the rest of the orange juice and got up, walking back
into the kitchen to put the glass in the sink. When I turned around,
I was a little surprised that she was standing behind me, closer than
I thought she'd be able to get without me knowing. I looked at her,
waiting for her to say something cause I could tell she wanted to but
it sure took her a long time to get it together.</p>

<p>"You told me ... " she started, looking like she was having a hard
time finding the right words. "When you first saw me that day in the
quad, that you knew I was different from the crowd I hung around
with."</p>

<p>I nodded, not really sure of what she was getting at. But I did
remember that conversation. It was one of the few times we'd been
alone together and she'd flat out asked me why someone like me was
even in the same room with someone like her. And I'd told her
honestly, after I told her what a bitch she was, that I thought we
were more alike than she thought.</p>

<p>I snapped myself from the trip down memory lane and nodded that I
remembered. "What did you see?" She asked. "Was there something about
me that was flashing 'different' like some kind of neon sign?"</p>

<p>"What is this about?" All of a sudden, she looked like she was on the
cusp of a breakdown. Maybe she'd been on the cusp since I'd walked
into the kitchen and I just hadn't noticed the desperation in her
eyes. But it looked so clear now.</p>

<p>She turned away, her back towards me as her arms folded across her
chest again. "Why am I even talking to you?" She asked but I think
she was asking herself more than me.</p>

<p>I leaned against the counter behind me, knowing that she'd tell me
cause Cordy was a to the point kind of girl and I wasn't disappointed
as she spoke again. "It's just that sometimes, I feel like whatever's
inside of me that makes me *me* dies a little whenever I'm with
Harmony and those other sheep."</p>

<p>"Then what's the problem? I thought you cut it off with those guys."</p>

<p>She turned back, a bitter smirk on her face. "And what do I have to
show for it? For the last couple of months, I've been a social
pariah, laughed at behind my back by the same people who used to suck
up to me. But I thought that's all right because now I have new
friends --- friends that won't abandon me at the first sign of
trouble, friends who see me for who I am and like me because of
that." She pushed agitatedly at a few strands of hair that had fallen
across her face. "But it never feels like I'm a part of this group
either. It never feels like I belong ... "</p>

<p>She trailed off, looking at me with something between a plea and
condemnation in her eyes. "Have you talked to Xander about this?" I
asked, swallowing uncomfortably. I kinda wanted to back up but there
was no space to back up to.</p>

<p>She snorted as if what I'd said was ridiculous. "Do you really think
I can talk to Xander about this? That I can talk to him about
anything?"</p>

<p>"So why are you talking to me about it?" I looked at her curiously as
she shrugged.</p>

<p>"Because you're right ... we're more alike than I thought."</p>

<p>I didn't know what to say after the things she'd told me but as I
kept looking at her, I knew that I had to say something. I guess I'll
start with the truth. "I don't know about anybody else, C but to me,
you are a part of this group ... as much as anybody else is."</p>

<p>"You're just saying that," she said softly and I knew the tone. It
was the same one you used when you wanted the last piece of cake but
said you didn't cause you didn't want to be seen as a pig. Basically,
she wanted to believe me.</p>

<p>"I could be ... " I looked at her with the most honest expression I
could muster. "But I'm not."</p>

<p>The corners of her mouth quirked up and I gotta say, the girl's even
prettier when she's smiling and trying to look like she's not and I
wonder how she'd look if she were smiling full out. As I kept
wondering, I felt myself leaning forward, mirroring what Cordelia was
starting to do herself and before you knew it, we were making out in
the middle of the kitchen. </p>

<p>It felt good. Hell, it felt better than good. Nothing slow, nothing
tentative --- so hot and fast that it made everything else seem like
it was just standing still watching us. And when I pulled back, I
didn't have to wonder how she'd look anymore cause she was wearing a
smile that lit up her entire face. A smile that made her look
absolutely fucking beautiful, even more so than she already was.</p>

<p>But then it turned confused and I could see the wheels beginning to
turn in her head. She'd probably do one of two things now. Either she
was gonna freak that she'd just kissed a girl, that she'd kissed *me*
of all people or she was gonna want to 'talk'. And I didn't want to
fuck around with any of that cause I knew the kiss didn't mean a
thing when you came down to it. </p>

<p>"What was that?" She asked.</p>

<p>"I'm just taking a wild guess here but I'd say that was a kiss."</p>

<p>"I know that," she said, looking at me like I was retarded. "Why
did ... I mean, not that it wasn't good but --"</p>

<p>"But we can't be going down that road," I finished for her. Maybe it
would have been different if we'd hooked up earlier but as it was
now, there was no chance for this to get off the ground.</p>

<p>We lapsed into silence and I think both of us were trying to come up
with something to say which would smooth over what had just happened
but before we could do that, the sound of the front door opening
almost made her bolt out of the room.</p>
