<p>I just had the strangest dream.</p>

<p>Like most dreams, --- most dreams I have anyway. I'm not vouching for
anyone else. --- I didn't even know it was a dream in the beginning.
I found myself just standing. It was almost like someone had slapped
me in the face when I finally realized that I was standing on the
beach with no friggin clue as to what the hell I was doing there or
how I got there in the first place. You'd think I'd remember
something important like that. </p>

<p>I kept thinking that maybe I got up that morning, ate breakfast and
came out here to get out of the house for awhile. Or maybe I was
taking a swim in the afternoon heat and then came back onto shore to
dry off. Like I said, I had no friggin clue. And as I looked around,
I knew that something was totally off. Everything was fuzzy around
the edges but sharply real at the same time. It was a fucking trip.
The cool wind was ruffling my hair but I couldn't feel it.</p>

<p>And the color kept fading in and out...of everything. The sky, the
ocean, the sand, the trees, the grass --- it was like trying to get
reception out of on an old TV. And the switching back and forth gave
me a godawful headache. Can you even get a headache from a dream? I
never did before. As I reached up a hand to massage my temple, I
looked up and realized I wasn't as alone as I thought I was. Sitting
just a few feet in front of me and making me wonder how I could've
missed her before, was some blonde sitting in the sand with her back
turned towards me. </p>

<p>"H-Hey," I called over, still getting used to the freaky color
transitions.</p>

<p>For the longest moment, the woman doesn't even move and I begin to
wonder if she heard me at all. Then, cool as you please, she turned
around and I almost choked even though my mouth had gone bone dry
cause the face I saw looking back at me, smiling at me was Buffy's.
Yeah, I knew I had to have been dreaming then but I didn't give a
shit. Buffy was there, she was with me again, and so what if she was
like everything else in this place and her color kept fading in and
out. I'll take Buffy anyway I can get her.</p>

<p>"B, fuck am I glad to see you," I said, crouching down and grinning
at her like an idiot. I reached out a hand and cupped her face. "I've
missed you so much. Everything's fucking bland without you."</p>

<p>She didn't say anything as she cocked her head, closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" I asked, seeing that her smile had turned into a sad
wince. </p>

<p>Her voice sounded hollow and soft when she finally talked. "You
didn't call. Why didn't you call?" </p>

<p>"I wanted --" Her eyes opened, focusing blearily on me. "I want to,
B. You don't know how much I do but they keep giving me the run
around. It's like I'm in a damn prison."</p>

<p>"I'm forgetting, Faith."</p>

<p>I dropped my hand to my side. "What? What are you forgetting?" I
asked, my eyes drawn upward for a second as I noticed that the day
had changed to night all of a sudden and there was a full moon
hanging in the sky. The colors were still fading in and out but it
wasn't as noticeable anymore.</p>

<p>"I have to be with *someone*."</p>

<p>I shook my head, frustrated that I couldn't understand her. "What are
you talking about? B, who are you going to be with?"</p>

<p>"I love you," she said, casting her eyes down. "I always will."</p>

<p>"Great, cause I love you too. So what's the problem?"</p>

<p>She just stared at me with a bone deep sadness in her eyes. I was
going to ask her again what she meant but then this high pitched
whining, shrieking sound came out of nowhere and I had to cover my
ears, completely missing what she was saying. And here I am now,
sitting up in bed, my heart beating a mile a minute, trying to figure
out what the fuck it was that had woken me up so suddenly...again. </p>

<p>This was the second time. Until now, I'd written off that first time
I'd woken up with my heart in my throat as some kind of a fluke. But
twice wasn't a fluke. Twice was a pattern. And twice meant I had to
shake myself out of this panic mode I was in and find out what the
damn noise was. So I threw off the covers and hopped out of the bed
with my mind totally set on checking out the rest of the house. Only
I couldn't cause, as I found out by yanking on the door, the sucker
was locked.</p>

<p>The thing that really shocked me though was that it still didn't open
on my second try. Usually, I couldn't stop things from breaking cause
I kept forgetting my own strength. But the door didn't budge. I
slammed my hand against it in frustration and it didn't sound right --
- it didn't sound like wood. I hit it a couple more times and got a
wicked sore hand in the end but at least the door was now open. The
lock was broken but at least it was open.</p>

<p>I took one last look at my room and then walked out. I didn't really
know where I was going. I just hoped the sound would come again or
there'd be some other clue to let me know what was going on cause I
was getting tired of all this mysterious bullshit. The halls were all
dark but that didn't bother me as much as the total quiet did. I
walked towards Sara's room and placed an ear to her door, listening
for a minute but I heard nothing. I was debating whether to go in
when the noise came again.</p>

<p>Unlike all the other times, I wasn't asleep when the noise hit so I
could really listen to it. It started out as a barely noticeable high
pitched whine in the background and then turned into something far
louder. Something between a scream, a yell, and a growl. I wasn't
even sure if it was human. It was so distorted, full of rage and
pain. I've never heard anything like it before and just like the
first night I'd heard it, I knew that if I could help it, I really
didn't want to hear it again.</p>

<p>How could anyone not wake up from that? It was a hell of a lot more
powerful than an alarm clock. It seemed to last much longer than it
did even though it was only about five seconds later that it
completely stopped. And when it ended, my ears were ringing with the
silence that followed which, strange as it seemed, sounded even
louder than the actual noise itself. But I still couldn't hear
anything from Sara's room. Not that it was really all that surprising
though since she was probably medicated up the ying yang. </p>

<p>I wasn't real sure where the sound had come from but I thought it'd
come from downstairs somewhere so I headed towards the staircase. The
shadows from the window panes were thrown across the stairs, squares
of light painting the steps and I almost went down but something
stopped me. Some gut feeling that I shouldn't, coming so strong that
I actually backed up. </p>

<p>I looked around, almost sure that something was lurking in the
shadows, ready to jump me. But there wasn't shit. Just more darkness,
more silence, and more of a creepiness factor every minute I stood
there doing absolutely nothing. I decided to head towards the other
side of the house instead of going to the ground floor --- not that I
was scared or anything...shit, maybe I was. Just a little.</p>

<p>I was kinda hoping that investigating the other half of the house
first would settle me down a little, make this feeling go away. Of
course I felt scared some of the times. Who doesn't, right? But that
doesn't mean I like it or I'd live with it.</p>

<p>Howard and Stepano's rooms were on this side of the house. Don't ask
me why Stepano doesn't sleep with Sara. The only reason I know he
doesn't is cause she told me one time, for no good reason at all,
that she slept alone. Didn't seem like she was too broken up about it
either. It was just like she was reciting a fact.</p>

<p>So I headed towards Howard's room cause I figured if he wasn't the
one making the noise, he'd be the one to know about it. I tried the
doorknob. It turned easily in my hand and I wondered what was with
the double standard. Why was my door locked? More importantly, why
wasn't his? I mean, give me a break, who was more dangerous here, me
or a sleazebag lawyer?</p>

<p>The door opened, not making a sound as it swung on its well oiled
hinges. The bed was in the middle of the room and I could see a lumpy
shape under its covers and a painting hanging right above it that
looked godawful even in the semi-darkness. It was just a white canvas
with blobs of paint thrown over it for all I could see but there's no
accounting for taste.</p>

<p>The lump on the bed didn't move as I walked closer until I was
standing right next to the head of the bed and staring at Howard's
peacefully sleeping face. I spent a couple of minutes just staring at
him. Whoever said there was no rest for the wicked was way off track
cause the proof was right in front of me. Obviously, he hadn't woken
up to the noise like I had which was weird cause it had been real
loud.</p>

<p>I reached over, placing a hand over his nose and mouth. It was only
after a couple of times that he tried to breath and couldn't that he
finally snapped his eyes open, flailing around like a fish out of
water. He tried throwing my hand off but that wasn't gonna work.
After a while, he quieted down some.</p>

<p>"You're not a screamer, are you?" I asked, conversationally.</p>

<p>He seemed to consider the question for a second and then shook his
head no. I slowly took my hand away and smiled when he sucked in a
deep breath. He looked warily at me as he shrank back, seeming to
shrink into the bed itself.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" He finally asked, getting up on his elbows.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you something," I said, getting to the point. </p>

<p>"Trying to suffocate me is a weird way to start," he said, looking at
me with a hard stare.</p>

<p>I smirked. "I hope you know I don't do this to just anybody."</p>

<p>"You hate me that much, huh?"</p>

<p>I just smiled at him.</p>

<p>"So what did you want to ask me about?"</p>

<p>"A noise." He stared blankly at me. "How could you not have heard it?
It was so fucking loud."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I've been sleeping like a baby --- that is,
before someone started choking me...I didn't hear anything."</p>

<p>"It was something between a scream and a yell. You sure you haven't
heard it? I know I heard it a couple of weeks ago too but I just
thought it was a bad dream until I heard it again tonight. Twice." </p>

<p>He quirked an eyebrow and asked in a condescending tone of voice, "I
don't know what to say to you but I didn't hear anything. Are you
sure you didn't dream it?" </p>

<p>"You know what?" I blew out a frustrated breath. "Forget it." I
walked out of the room, leaving him still sprawled on the bed.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The table we were sitting at in the Bronze was covered with
acceptance letters to every prestigious college and university in,
and around and out of the nation.</p>

<p>"Wow," I said, glancing up at Willow.</p>

<p>"I second your wow and raise you a whoo," Xander added, eyeing all
the thick envelopes. "I always knew you were too good for us, Will,"
he said, giving her a baleful gaze. </p>

<p>"Stop it, Xander." Willow slapped him lightly on the arm and then
looked down uncertainly at the table. "I'm not even sure if I want to
go to any of these schools."</p>

<p>"Well at least you have a choice --- a whole lot of them. The only
thing in my immediate future is a deep fat fryer and a funny hat."</p>

<p>As Willow tried to cheer Xander up, I kept looking at the mountain of
letters. It was funny. This was my senior year. After this year, I
would graduate from high school. I would be an adult. But it just
hadn't seemed real to me...until now. I finally began to realize what
it meant and I was scared. Everything suddenly began looking like it
was going in fast motion, changing right in front of me and I just
wanted it to stop for a second so I could collect my thoughts.</p>

<p>"Buffy, how about you?"</p>

<p>""Huh?" I looked up at Willow. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"What college are you thinking about going to?" She asked, looking at
me expectantly.</p>

<p>"Any one that'll accept me, I guess," I said, trying to make light of
it. "It doesn't really matter though. I mean, it's not like I don't
already know what I'm going to be when I grow up."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but obtaining a higher education is always a good thing in my
opinion. And anyway, it'll give you something to do during the day
time."</p>

<p>"Yeah, something to do," I agreed halfheartedly. I left the Bronze
not long after that. I didn't feel much like partying anymore and as
I walked through the cemeteries on my way home, I wondered what I
*was* going to do. Willow was a surefire bet to leave Sunnydale and
make something of herself and in a way, I was happy for her. If
anyone deserved to get out of the killzone, it was her. But she had
also become my best friend and I was starting to miss her already
even though she hadn't even left yet.</p>

<p>We were all going in different directions and much as I wanted
everything to remain like they were right now, I had to face the
facts. Things were changing and I couldn't stop that from happening.
Walking through one of the many cemeteries inside Sunnydale was
probably not one of the best places to mull over my future. I hadn't
even walked halfway through when I saw that the doors to one of the
big mausoleums was open and a light was dancing around inside.</p>

<p>Vampires. They had absolutely no respect for the dead. I peeked in
and saw one digging through a wall and pulling out something I
couldn't make out in the dark. I decided to wait outside until he
came out --- give him a little surprise.</p>

<p>"Hand it over," I said, when he finally made an appearance. His eyes
widened and I could sense the total fear gripping him. I could also
sense the presence of another vampire behind me so I spun around,
kicking the stalking vamp in the stomach. He gathered himself, taking
two swings at me which I ducked. I caught his third wild swing and
used his own momentum to spin him around, grabbing a stake from
inside my jacket and punching it through his heart. I turned around
to look for the other vamp but he'd taken the hint and split.</p>

<p>I wondered briefly what he'd stolen but my mind wasn't exactly in it.
I kept going back to brooding about my future or lack thereof. Why
did I even bother? I was a Slayer, destined to do one thing and one
thing only. To kill demons. What could college possibly teach me that
would make me a better Slayer? I was still thinking about it later
that night when I climbed through my bedroom window and slumped down
onto my bed.</p>

<p>Mom had been real encouraging about college, even manic about it. I
guess she just wanted what was best for me, even if she really didn't
know me, know that other side of me. My eyes wandered over my room,
settling briefly over all the things that had defined my childhood.
From Mr. Gordo to a pair of figure skates to photos of my family, me,
my mom and my dad. Then my eyes wandered to a picture of me and Faith
on the bedside table. </p>

<p>I picked it up, an involuntary smile creeping onto my face as I
thought back again to the time when we'd taken it. It was one of the
few times Faith had been willing to let someone take a picture of
her. We were eating lunch at an outdoor cafe in LA and I'd asked
someone to take a picture of us together. Faith had grumbled about it
but I'd pushed her, giving her the puppy dog look until she'd finally
caved. She had this cute pouty face going on when the picture was
snapped and I think that's why I liked it so much.</p>

<p>She still hadn't called me yet. Not even a letter. And sometimes, I
laid awake at night wondering if she'd forgotten about me in her new
life. Mom couldn't get anything out of the tightlipped people at the
state offices. They wouldn't even tell us if she was still in
California and, honestly, what would be the harm in that? I pressed
the frame into my chest, holding it in my arms and sat like that
until there was a tapping at my window.</p>

<p>Angel was peering at me from outside and I got up, opening up the
window to let him in. "Hey, what's up?" I asked as he stepped
through, coming into my room. "You don't usually visit me unless
there's something dire brewing so, lay it on me."</p>

<p>"There's nothing," he said, sounding almost embarrassed. "I just
wanted to see how you were. Willow told me you left the Bronze and
might need some cheering up."</p>

<p>"And you were recruited?" He flinched slightly like I had hit
him. "Sorry. I didn't mean for it to come out like that. It's just
that you don't strike me as the cheerer upper type."</p>

<p>"I'm not," he admitted. "But I'm a very good listener so if you
wanted to talk..."</p>

<p>I looked at him speculatively and then sat back on my bed. "It's just
the usual stuff --- being the Slayer and the destiny deal. Only now,
it seems so much worse because everybody else seems to either have a
future or are making plans for the future. What do I have to look
forward to? An inevitable early death at the hands of a lucky demon?
Sacrificing myself yet again for the greater good? Been there, didn't
like that."</p>

<p>He took a seat next to me and was quiet for a moment. "I wouldn't let
that happen to you."</p>

<p>I looked over at him, a little surprised at the totally serious
expression on his face. And I wasn't sure how to take his
assertion. "Uh, thanks. I guess it couldn't hurt to have you watching
my back." I smiled at him and then looked down again at the picture I
was still holding in my hands.</p>

<p>The next day, I told Giles about the vamp at the mausoleum that had
gotten away and aside from a little bitching that I hadn't bothered
to find out what he'd stolen --- nothing I hadn't expected --- he
took me on a field trip back to the cemetery. Only in Sunnydale.
That's all I have to say concerning that.</p>

<p>"Du Lac," he noted, reading off the engraving above the tomb. "Oh
dear." I hate it when he says that because it always means something
bad in store for me. A hundred percent freshly squeezed badness.
Basically, he filled us all in later at the library that what was
stolen was some cross that you could use to decode a book that was
also coincidentally stolen last week from the library. As you could
probably predict, anyone going to this much trouble definitely had
evil on their mind. And not just your regular, decaffeinated evil
either. If I had to make a guess, I'd say this had Spike and
Drusilla's prints all over it. They'd been giving me trouble since
they first came to Sunnydale and this was just the kind of planning
and foresight I'd come to expect from them.</p>

<p>"So how can we stop them if we don't know what's in the book?" I
asked.</p>

<p>Giles came back with his typical cure all answer to everything ---
research. "Be prepared to stay late tonight," he said which got an
enthusiastic smile from Willow --- the only enthusiastic smile. We
researched straight through the afternoon with a couple of snack
breaks to give us an added sugar boost. We finally figured out that
the book could be used to "restore" a vampire who was sick. The only
vampire we knew who fit that to a T was Drusilla. So, at least now,
we knew for a fact that Spike and Dru were the ones that stole the
book and the cross. </p>

<p>I was in the middle of stretching and letting out a yawn when the
doors to the library crashed open and some guy rushed in, immediately
tackling me off the chair. He had me pinned and was choking me with a
hand around my throat when Giles hit him with a book across the back.
It didn't even make him flinch. I reached my hand out, scraping him
hard across the face which did make him flinch and I used the
opportunity to raise my knees to my chest and kick him off of me.</p>

<p>Giles had by then found a weapon better suited to dealing with the
maniac and he fired a bolt from the crossbow in his hand, landing it
easily in the guy's chest. Xander and Willow helped me up as Giles
went over to inspect the body crumpled on the floor.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what just happened and what that is?" I asked, going
over and seeing him studying a ring on the dead guy's finger.</p>

<p>"This is very serious," he muttered, standing back up.</p>

<p>"Good. I wouldn't want my near death to have been flippant."</p>

<p>"This isn't a time for jokes, Buffy," he said sternly as he turned to
face me. "The ring is worn by members of the Order of Taraka ---
assassins. And it seems they're after you."</p>

<p>When things go bad, they go really, really bad. As if having to worry
about Spike and Dru weren't enough, now I have to worry about a group
of assassins trying to hunt me down. And Giles made it sound real bad
too. Something along the lines of a relentless assault, a continual
attempt to kill me by members of the Order who were an eclectic mix
of humans, demons, and everything in between so I couldn't really
count on knowing who was who. Yeah, things were looking real bad.
After I heard that, I was glad my mom was on a trip to buy some art
stuff for her gallery. At least she wouldn't be caught in the
crossfire and the worse that would happen was her coming back home to
find me dead. </p>

<p>This morbid thought just bought me down even more and the next day at
school didn't go any better than the last two because everywhere I
looked, I thought I could see people looking at me. Everywhere I
looked, I thought I could see another assassin staring back at me. I
was so spooked that when I heard someone walking up behind me in the
hallway after third period, I immediately spun around, throwing the
person against the wall of lockers and pushing an elbow into his
throat. But as soon as I did that, I let go because this wasn't an
assassin.</p>

<p>"Daniel?" I asked, completely taken by surprise at his presence. It
had been nearly a year since I'd last seen him in LA. "What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>He cocked one blonde eyebrow. "Trying not to get throttled would be
priority number one," he said in that familiarly dry, understated way.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," I said, apologizing for the over reaction. "I thought
you were...someone I didn't want to see."</p>

<p>"He must've gotten on your bad side."</p>

<p>"You could say that." I said, trying to shrug it off.</p>

<p>"So where's Faith? I thought I heard something about her living with
you now."</p>

<p>"Um, yeah...she's uh." As I struggled to find the right words for
what had happened, I caught sight of Willow walking towards us.
Great, I needed a distraction. "Hey, Will," I said, waving her
over. "This is--"</p>

<p>"Oz!" </p>

<p>'Oz?" I mouthed at Daniel. He shrugged as Willow began explaining how
they'd literally bumped into each other the other day. As she was
talking, my eyes wandered behind her, coming to rest on the advancing
figure of a female cop. I was just wondering what had happened at
Sunnydale High this time to bring the cops around when she pulled her
weapon. "Down!" I shouted, pulling Willow and Oz onto the floor a
split second before the gun went off. I guess this would be Assassin
#2.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>You've never lived until you've spent some time looking for something
and you're still not entirely sure what it is, in an enormous mansion
on an island in the dead of night. Made me feel like I was in a
Scooby-Doo cartoon only without the fake. After I'd left Howard's
bedroom, I'd went to Stepano's, just to see if he was there. Turned
out he wasn't. His large bed didn't even look like it'd been slept in
and as I wandered around his room out of curiosity more than anything
else, I began to think he didn't spend all that much time in there at
all. No knick knacks, no personal items, nothing but the clothes and
shoes laid out neatly inside his closet told anybody that anyone
slept there at all.</p>

<p>I slipped out of his room and steeled myself again to go downstairs.
I had to pass by Howard's room again to get to the staircase and I
noticed he'd closed his door after I'd left. I had a feeling he was
lying about not hearing the noise but I couldn't exactly beat the
truth out of him --- well, I could but he'd probably sue me or
something which would totally suck.</p>

<p>I got to the top of the stairs and this time, that really bad
feeling, the one that had made me chicken out the first time, didn't
come back again so I started going down. When I got to the bottom
though, I wasn't sure which side of the house I should look into
first. I finally decided on going towards the left which is also
where the dining room is just because I was more familiar with that
side. </p>

<p>The dining room looked especially cold and forbidding in the
unwavering moonlight and I paused for a second before going to the
other end of the room where I opened up a set of double doors,
leading into a relatively small room. As far as I could tell, this
room really wasn't built for anything except to act as a kind of
buffer between the dining room and the kitchen which, as I walked in,
still shocks me with its size. You can probably cook for five hundred
people in a place like this --- not that I would know seeing as I
can't really cook much more than water but that's what it seems like
to me.</p>

<p>The mostly stainless steel room even impressed me with the number of
ranges, ovens, sinks, pans, and other cooking instruments I couldn't
even name, sitting ready for someone to use them. I'd only been in
here once before when I was politely shooed out by some guy in a
chef's uniform who looked scared and angry at the same time for
telling me to leave. Now there was nothing smoking, nothing cooking
and nothing but silence met my entry.</p>

<p>I walked through the aisles --- yeah, there were aisles, as in more
than one --- glancing back and forth, looking for...something. Not
knowing what I was looking for was really starting to piss me off. I
looked everywhere but didn't find anything that wasn't supposed to be
in a kitchen so, after getting a popsicle from the freezer, I walked
back through the dining room to the right side of the house, hoping
I'd find something there. I hadn't really visited the right side of
the house, mostly cause every time I thought about going there, I'd
get distracted and do something else instead. If you think about it,
it's pretty strange. I mean, I've already been here for a couple of
months and I've never even been to the right side of the house. Kinda
makes you think. And if I had more time, I'd be thinking about it too.</p>

<p>I walked past the front door and opened up the doors that led to the
other side of the house. I found myself in a large room --- surprise,
surprise --- and hanging right there in the middle of the ceiling was
some big ass chandelier. The floor was all polished hardwood and
there wasn't a stick of furniture in the entire room which just made
it seem larger than it already was. I figured this might be the room
to use if you needed a wicked nice place to throw a party. Since the
entire room was already bare, I didn't have to look through every
single nook and cranny to see that there was nothing suspicious in
there so I walked across to the other side where I could see another
set of doors.</p>

<p>Opening that up, I suddenly found myself in a library. Rows upon rows
of books filled every available shelf and the shelves ran up to the
very top of the ceiling. There was even a ladder; the kind that rode
along tracks built into the wall. Giles would probably appreciate
this room better than I could ever do. As it was, I just gave it a
quick once over before walking to another set of doors on the other
side of the room. I was getting a workout just walking through the
ground floor of the house. How fucked was that?</p>

<p>The next room did kind of surprise me though. It contained an indoor
swimming pool --- I'd say it was regulation sized too if I was into
that sort of thing. The blue chlorinated waters shimmered slightly
from the bright, florescent lights that were still on overhead,
humming with electricity. Unlike every other room in the house, this
one had no windows, only a mural painted on one wall showing a
sunset. There were also two changing rooms off to the side but there
was nothing in there either. With the pool room, I'd officially run
out of anymore rooms on this side of the house to search.</p>

<p>So about forty five minutes after I'd first woken up, I still hadn't
found the noise that had woken me. I stood there by the side of the
pool, trying to come up with something I could do next when a loud
crashing sound suddenly came out of nowhere, echoing around the tiles
inside the room. And because it echoed, there was no way for me to
pinpoint exactly where it had come from. All I could tell was that
the general direction which it seemed to come from was one of the
changing rooms.</p>

<p>I went back in, more cautiously this time and came face to face
with...well...nothing. The same scene greeted my eyes. A couple of
benches, a couple of towel racks with towels neatly arranged on them
and a shower stall. That was it. Nothing else. I went over and sat
down on one of the benches, tossing the popsicle stick and bringing
one knee up to rest my back against the side of a wall.</p>

<p>After a moment, I banged my head back, hitting it against the wall in
frustration. I wasn't getting anywhere. That was fucking obvious. It
had to be Stepano though. He wasn't in his room and, let's face it,
the guy totally creeped me out. But where the hell was he? Was he in
the house? Was he outside? He had to still be on the island, right?</p>

<p>I sat there for a moment and then I saw something that made me get
up. I'd been staring at a spot inside the shower and, somewhere along
the line, my eyes must have finally passed the info to my brain that
something wasn't right about it. I walked over and ran my fingers
along the tiles and there, barely visible was the outline of a door
or something. I pushed against the wall. It didn't move. I kicked the
wall. It didn't move. </p>

<p>I looked up at the showerhead and from whatever deep down compulsion
drove me to it, I decided to yank on it. I guess I must've done the
right thing cause the shower wall immediately slid back with a soft
grinding sound. Shit, imagine that. A mansion with hidden
passageways. I wondered if it came prepackaged like that or if
Stepano put them in after he bought the place to give it that haunted
house feel.</p>

<p>I poked my head in, saw that it was well lighted and stepped the rest
of the way through. I found myself facing a stairway leading down. It
was pretty steep but there was no way I was gonna fall cause there
were handrails on both sides. If I had to guess, I'd say it took me
down about 3 stories deep where I found myself in a rich man's boom
boom room if said rich man were psycho and into the occult-er side of
life.</p>

<p>As I walked further into the room, I got a better picture of what was
inside. It was a big room, lit by torches placed every feet or so.
The stone walls were covered in writing I couldn't understand and
symbols I didn't want to understand. They looked like they were done
in red paint...at least, I hoped it was paint. They were scrawled
everywhere, even some on the floor and ceiling. There was a high
stone block sitting in the very middle of the room that looked like
it was five feet tall.</p>

<p>I was still looking around when my senses went off all of a sudden.
Isn't that always like the bad guys? To sneak up on you when you're
just starting to tour their pad? Spinning around, I figured I'd
backhand whoever was sneaking up behind me and take them by surprise
for once.
The plan went well, except for the surprising them part. I hit him
all right but it was like hitting up against a brick wall. Nothing
budged. I grabbed my hand back, cradling it against my chest as I
looked up into Stepano's dead eyes.</p>

<p>I tried backing away but his hand shot out, grabbing me across the
face so what ended up happening was that my mouth and nose was
covered and I couldn't breathe. Was this some fucking karma thing for
what I'd done to Howard? The damn bastard had a hold like iron and I
couldn't pry his fingers off for nothing. And then he started lifting
me up, bringing me to my tippy toes. My head felt like it was going
to squish like a grapefruit as his fingers began digging in deeper.</p>

<p>"You're not supposed to be here yet," he said in a totally calm tone
of voice.</p>

<p>I would have offered to leave if I could *talk*. As it was, I knew I
was damn near to passing out from the spots dancing in front of my
eyes and my lungs screaming for air. By now, my legs were dangling in
the air and I tried once more to get myself free. Using all of my
strength, I braced my feet against his chest and pushed off.</p>

<p>My face felt like it was going to tear off but at least he finally
let go and I bounced onto the hard, stone floor, trying to suck in
some air while scrabbling backwards like some sorta crab. Stepano was
bent over from my kick but he immediately straightened back up again,
angrily staring at me. I wished then that I'd packed a knife or
something but I hadn't been thinking.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, you're a demon?" I asked, slowly getting back on my
feet as I carefully eyed him for any sudden movements. </p>

<p>He didn't answer, charging right at me and lowering his shoulder. I
didn't give him a chance to slam me though as I crouched down,
sweeping his legs out from under him. He landed on his back, staring
blankly up at the ceiling and I was all set to jump on top of him
when he suddenly sat up again, getting back on his feet like nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>I grabbed a torch from the wall and threw it at him to buy some extra
time as I ran to the other side of the room, hoping to find something
that could help me. But I found nothing but more torches. I turned
around and he was almost right on top of me, his arms open as he
lunged forward, intent on grabbing me. I ducked, moving around him
and ran over to the stone block in the middle of the room, hauling
myself up. I should've probably ran for the staircase but then it
would've been too much like a shlocky horror movie or something.</p>

<p>I figured, this way, I could give him a good kick in the head. Maybe
shatter his skull or at least give him something to think about
before he came chasing after me again. But I didn't do that. I didn't
do it cause I found something better. </p>

<p>The sword was just lying there like someone had forgotten it during
spring cleaning or something. It was covered in dust from the handle
on down to the tip but I barely noticed as I picked it up cause the
only thing I cared about was that it was sharp enough to cut someone
open. But I couldn't even straighten up before my legs were taken out
from under me.</p>

<p>I went tumbling over the other side, landing hard on my knees. I
looked up in time to see his head bobbing up and down as he walked
around the block. As he turned the corner, I got up, swinging the
sword in a wide arc, easily chopping off his head. The sound of my
own breathing seemed to fill the entire room as the head bounced
twice on the floor before rolling a couple of feet away to land on
its side. Stepano's eyes were still wide open, his mouth slightly
open as if surprised he was in two separate pieces now. </p>

<p>The rest of his body dropped down on its knees almost like it was in
slow motion and before it could completely hit the floor, it began
rotting, turning into a greenish, purplish, spoiled hunk of meat. I
turned back to the head which looked about as bad as the body. Only
the eyes were still the same. Still giving me the creeps. Same as
always.</p>

<p>I turned slowly towards the stairs, almost expecting that Stepano
would pop back up again. But he didn't. Instead, I saw Howard
standing at the bottom of the stairs, his eyes lazily moving between
me and the head on the floor.</p>

<p>"You won. Congratulations."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me," I said, pointing the sword at him. "You're gonna
tell me you're on my side now, right?" </p>

<p>"I'm on the side that wins." He glanced again at Stepano's head. "And
you're it, Faith."</p>

<p>I walked towards him, placing the tip of the sword at his
throat. "Give me a reason why I should trust you."</p>

<p>"The fact that you're asking me to give you a reason tells me that
you *want* to trust me."</p>

<p>I stared at him for a minute and then slowly let the sword fall to my
side. "I want off this island." He tilted his head forward and then
turned on his heels, climbing up the stairs. I took one last look at
Stepano before following him.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Spike went crashing into the organ, bringing down the entire thing on
top of him and Drusilla. I almost went over there to check if they
were both dead or as dead as vampires could get but the flames from
the fire were starting to really get uncomfortably close. I could
still hear the echoey clanging of the pipes hanging in the air as I
helped Angel up off the floor, following everybody else out of the
church. I sat him down on the ground on the outside as I knelt in
front of him.</p>

<p>"You all right?" I asked, touching him lightly on the cheek with my
fingertips to get his attention. One of the main ingredients in
Drusilla's miracle cure all turned out to be the life of her sire.
Her sire just so happened to be Angel. If we had taken a minute
longer in getting here, Angel would probably be dead.</p>

<p>"Fine," he said even though he sure didn't sound fine. More like
shaky and weak. I looked up at the circle of people gathered around
us: Giles, Cordelia, Xander, and Willow. We had worked as a team to
beat down the Order of Taraka along with the vampiric duo and here in
the aftermath, I was just going to thank them all when the words
began drying up in my throat before it even made it past my lips.</p>

<p>"It seems like every time I hang around you people," Cordelia said,
looking over her dress, "I get my clothes ruined."</p>

<p>"Kind of not caring about that right now," Xander quipped, shooting
her a sidelong glance as I turned my attention back to Angel.</p>

<p>"Come on," I said, helping him up again. "I'll take you home."</p>

<p>Cordelia, even though she whined and griped about it the whole way,
drove me over to Angel's apartment before screeching out of the
parking lot like a bat out of hell. Angel was still leaning heavily
on me as I walked him up the stairs. We made it through the door,
walking over to his bed where he sat down heavily.</p>

<p>"Do you need anything?" I asked, looking down at him, focusing on his
hand which still looked red and raw from where the knife had gone
through.</p>

<p>He looked up at me and it looked like he wanted to say something but
his eyes ended up wandering down to the vicinity of my shoes. "Stay
with me?" The question was said so softly that I wondered if I had
heard right. Then his eyes were focusing on me again, looking so
vulnerable. "You don't have to," he said weakly, amending his earlier
statement.</p>

<p>"No, it's all right," I said, pulling up a chair next to the
bedside. "I'll stay."</p>

<p>He looked almost relieved as the tension drained out of his body. So
we sat there in complete silence for a couple of minutes. I didn't
know about Angel but I wasn't too sure what to say to someone who'd
just been chained up and nearly killed by two psychotic vamps. 'I'm
glad you're okay?' I winced just thinking about the utter shallowness
of the comment.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're okay." </p>

<p>"What?" I asked, looking up at him in confusion. Did he say what I
think he just said?</p>

<p>"I said, I'm glad you're okay."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I be the one saying that?" I asked, chuckling lightly at
the way we were both thinking.</p>

<p>The corner of his lips quirked up in amusement. "So we're both okay."</p>

<p>"It's good that we got that clear," I said with a wry grin,
unthinkingly placing a hand on his knee. It was meant to comfort him
and I swear that was all I had in mind. But somewhere along the line,
our eyes met and our gazes held. He leaned towards me, his lips just
inches from mine and I could have pulled back but I didn't even
realize what was happening until it was too late. His lips were on
mine for a full five seconds before my mind finally registered the
what was going on part and I snapped my head back. "Don't."</p>

<p>He looked at me, his eyes full of what looked like longing. "Buffy,"
he said, reaching out for me. "I didn't --- I'm sorry," he said as I
pulled away from his grasp. He looked almost like I'd slapped him.</p>

<p>"No, I'm sorry," I said, standing up. I stood in the middle of the
room uncertainly for a second. "I should go."</p>

<p>"Please," he said, stopping me with a hand to the arm. "I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable." </p>

<p>Uncomfortable? How else did he think I would feel? "It's all right,
Angel. It just took me by surprise, that's all. We'll just put this
behind us okay? You know what I think it is? It's the post-Slayage
stress--"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What?" He placed both hands on my elbows and looked at me with so
much intensity that it made me want turn away.</p>

<p>"It's not that way for me, Buffy. I've wanted to...kiss you since the
first time I saw you."</p>

<p>"I really think you should stop now," I said, trying to pull away
from his grasp.</p>

<p>"But that's just it," he said, with a pained expression on his face
as he let me go. "I've stopped myself too many times in the past. If
I don't say what I have to say now, I never will. When I thought
there was no hope, you gave me hope. You gave me a reason to live
again. You made me believe that I can be redeemed. You made me feel
human again...Buffy, I'm in love with you."</p>

<p>I shook my head, refusing to believe what he'd just said. "I *really*
don't need this right now." He kept looking at me with a hang dog
expression and I relented a bit, explaining that "Things are more
complicated than you think, Angel."</p>

<p>"Then explain it to me...please, Buffy."</p>

<p>I sighed, turning my head away. Why did he have to make this so
difficult? Why did he have to be such a nice guy, making it even more
difficult? Because even though I didn't want to admit it, I *was*
attracted to him. It was not a huge attraction, not even medium sized
but it was there, underlying our every interaction. Sometimes, I
thought that if it weren't for Faith, I could have easily fallen for
him and it scared me because I didn't want that to happen, not even
in the relatively private waters of my mind.</p>

<p>"I have to go home," I said, ignoring his plea. "I'll check up on you
later." </p>

<p>He didn't try to stop me this time. I walked out the door without
looking at his face even once. I already knew what I would see if I
did and I couldn't deal with it, knowing that I had hurt him. I
walked all the way home, stuck on autopilot as my brain began
processing what had just happened. If I could have done anything
differently, I think I would have told him the truth. Told him
exactly why I couldn't return his feelings. That was the only thing I
regretted.</p>

<p>I almost walked to the side of my house before I remembered that mom
wasn't home and I didn't need to sneak in. It was so quiet as I
walked through the door, putting the keys back in my pocket. I almost
wished mom *was* home just so I'd have someone to come home to. I
didn't bother putting on the lights as I trudged up the stairs. </p>

<p>For having just defeated the forces of evil with the help of my
friends, I didn't feel very triumphant or even mildly jubilant. I
turned into Faith's room which I'd practically made into my room by
now --- I spent so much time in there --- and sat down on the floor
next to the two trophies. If she was here, everything would be okay,
I often thought. I was thinking that right now actually. </p>

<p>I knew that probably wasn't true. Not all my problems would magically
disappear if she were here. Not everything would be roses and
sunshine. But they didn't need to be. That was the point. Not
everything needed to be perfect because if Faith were here, we could
deal with the bumps along the road together --- just like we did
before.</p>

<p>How many more months? I tried keeping track for awhile. The hours,
the days, the months. That lasted for about a week before the numbers
began looking too large and too daunting. Now I wished I'd kept up
the obsessiveness just so I could think about something besides
Angel. My mind kept flashing back to his apartment against my will.</p>

<p>I hoped he was going to be all right. He didn't look like the kind of
guy to have a breakdown. He was too even keeled for that but I also
knew he must be hurting. After having just poured your heart out to
someone you were secretly in love with, the last thing you want is
for them to say they didn't feel the same way. Talk about ripping out
your heart.</p>

<p>And I'd done it.</p>

<p>Ripped out his heart.</p>

<p>I got up off the floor, slipping off my shirt, shoes and pants to let
them fall to the ground as I crawled under the covers of the bed. I
tried to make my mind blank, tried not to think about anything
anymore and for once, it worked.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I slipped into the seat next to Howard and reached up to turn on the
air conditioning. We were on a plane, the same one that I was on
before I think. After the thing with Stepano where I sliced his head
off, Howard had taken off for about a week, telling me that he had to
take care of some business, make sure all the necessary paperwork was
filled out before he could get me back to the US</p>

<p>I'd let him go but not without threatening him with some serious
assault and battery if he tried to pull anything over on me. He'd
given me his word he wouldn't and I'd just laughed in his face,
showing him exactly how much I thought about his "word". But the
thing was, I had to trust someone. Wasn't a matter of wanting to, it
was a more a matter of needing to. I was kinda surprised that he
actually showed up a week later like he promised but he did, riding
in on a speedboat, his shirt and tie chucked for a polo shirt and
preppy shorts. I wasn't sure which outfit I found less gag worthy on
him.</p>

<p>I packed up whatever clothes would fit into the duffel bag I'd bought
in with me and left. Actually, that's not true. I didn't leave right
away. I visited with Sara one more time. She was asleep when I
dropped in and maybe it was better that way. I didn't know what was
going to happen to her now that Stepano was gone but I was going to
make sure Howard took care of her. She wasn't really my mother...but
she was at the same time and I couldn't keep ignoring it forever.</p>

<p>Before I left the room, I bent over, kissing her on the forehead.
Call it my one sentimental moment for the year. And then I finally
left that island. It was only after we left that I found out where we
actually were. Somewhere off of Greece, Howard said, volunteering the
information over the loud roar of the motors and the whipping of the
wind.</p>

<p>Now as I sat here on the plane, I wanted him to volunteer more
information.</p>

<p>"So what happens now?" I asked.</p>

<p>He looked up from the magazine he was reading, something with really
small print and no pictures. "Things will proceed like nothing has
happened," he said, putting down the magazine onto his lap as he
turned to face me. "For all anyone knows, nothing has happened."</p>

<p>"Won't someone find it a little strange that Stepano's suddenly
disappeared?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Okay...you wanna explain that one to me again? I think it went by
way too fast the first time."</p>

<p>He began tapping his fingers on the magazine."Stepano wasn't what
anyone would call a very sociable person. I took care of his finances
and legal troubles. He took care of the sacrifices and blood rites.
No one saw him besides me and a few maids. Trust me, nobody will miss
him."</p>

<p>"And what happens to me now?"</p>

<p>"You'll go back to your life in Sunnydale. I assumed that's what you
wanted?"</p>

<p>I nodded. Yeah, that's what I wanted.</p>

<p>"And of course, you'll have a sizable trust fund set up and a weekly
allowance."</p>

<p>I almost did a double take as I looked at him like he was totally
shitting me. "Why would you do that for me?" I asked
suspiciously. "What's in it for you?"</p>

<p>"Let's call it payment," he said, staring at me blandly. "For
services rendered."</p>

<p>"For offing someone you didn't have the balls to do yourself," I
guessed. His eyes narrowed just a slight bit. "Let me toss this in
the air and see what sticks. You're the one that set Stepano up with
me, aren't you? I bet you know what I am too, right?" He didn't say
anything so I just kept going. "And why would you do something like
that to someone who paid you the big bucks? Oh, wait, I think I got
it. You wanted more. More money, more power, more control. Am I
close?"</p>

<p>"Bull's eye."</p>

<p>I smirked at him and stood up, moving back to my seat which happened
to be right behind him. At least now, I had some answers. Didn't make
me feel all that much better but still...</p>

<p>I looked out the window, staring at the blue nothingness outside. I
didn't care about whatever powerplay Howard had masterminded. I
didn't even care that he'd used me like some pawn in his game. As
long as he kept his word again and got me back to Sunnydale, I
couldn't give a shit what he did on the side. And then I thought
about this trust fund business. It was probably his way of buying me
off now that I'd served my purpose. I couldn't be all high and mighty
about it. If he wanted to give me cash, I'm all for it. In a way, I
think I kinda deserved it for having put up with so much crap for so
damn long.</p>

<p>I reached over and pulled down the shade on the little window,
darkening the cabin even more since all the other shades were drawn
too. I closed my eyes, resting my head back against the seat and
tried to fall asleep because there was no better way to get through
an airplane trip than doing it unconscious.</p>

<p>When I woke up, it was to the sound of the pilot's voice coming over
the intercom, helpfully telling us that it was 11:00 local time and a
mild forty five degrees outside. I swiped a hand through my hair,
still thinking about the dream I'd just had. It was about Buffy
again, of course. About what it would be like when we saw each other
again. Shit, just thinking about it made me get all tense cause there
was this niggling fear in the back of my mind that kept saying she
wouldn't be as happy to see me as I would be to see her.</p>

<p>It wasn't true. I knew it wasn't true.</p>

<p>But I couldn't help being scared. The plane was already starting to
go down as I raised the shade on the window and looked outside. "Hey,
Howard. Where the fuck are we?" I asked, staring blankly out at the
city below.</p>

<p>"New York. The plane's going to refuel before flying to California."</p>

<p>That's when I noticed the Statue of Liberty, looking like one of
those miniatures you buy in a souvenir shop, standing in the middle
of the water. And then all the buildings crowded onto the tiny island
began to make sense cause, yeah, this was New York. We landed a
couple of minutes later and Howard took off, telling me that I should
go on to California alone. Before he left though, he gave me his
card, telling me I could call him if I needed anything. </p>

<p>I sat down in the lounge, waiting for them to get some more gas into
the plane. Then I started thinking that I should give everybody at
Sunnydale a heads up that I was coming home. It wasn't like they were
expecting me for another six months. I went over to a phone, inserted
a couple of quarters and called Buffy's house but after waiting for
fifteen rings, I finally hung up. That's when I noticed that I was
gripping the phone hard enough to break it and I took a breath,
trying to get the nervous feeling out of my gut. I was all ready to
hear Buffy's voice but that had turned out to be a total wash out.</p>

<p>I was about to head back to my seat, maybe get a cup of coffee or
something when I thought about calling someone else. Inserting a
couple more quarters, I dialed another number and waited as the phone
rang.</p>

<p>"Hello?" The voice on the other end of the line almost floored me.</p>

<p>"Red? It's me."</p>

<p>"Faith? Faith is that you?!" Willow almost screeched, making me pull
the phone away from my ear and laugh. </p>

<p>"Yeah, it's good to hear your voice too. Listen," I said, getting to
the point cause I was almost out of change. "I called Buffy but she
wasn't home. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that I'm going
to be coming back. Actually, I'm in New York right now."</p>

<p>"Are you serious? Oh God, Buffy's going to be so happy to see you,"
she gushed, putting a smile on my face. "Oh wait, Faith, are you
going to be back by five today?"</p>

<p>"Shit, I don't know Red. The time zones and all that other crap give
me a headache but I should be in Sunnydale by tonight. Why? What's
up?"</p>

<p>"We're throwing Buffy a surprise birthday party tonight at the
Bronze. If you can make it back, it'll probably be the best birthday
present she could get."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn. I forgot it was her birthday today," I said, slapping
myself on the forehead with the receiver. "Red, listen. I'll be
there, okay? I've got to go now cause this phone's ate all my
quarters but I'll see you later."</p>

<p>"All right, Faith. Take care, bye."</p>

<p>I hung up the phone, feeling a whole lot better having talked to
someone --- having talked to a friend. Now that the knot in the pit
of my stomach had loosened a bit, I began worrying about what to get
Buffy for her birthday. I had a total of three dollars left in my
pocket and I wished now that I'd hit Howard up for a few bucks before
he'd left. I could've gotten her flowers or something.</p>

<p>A guy in a pilot's uniform came up to me, putting my gift giving
plans temporarily on hold. "Miss Spencer?" </p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"The plane's refueled. We're all ready to go." </p>

<p>"Yeah." I followed him out of the lounge. One good thing about plane
rides, I'd have plenty of time trying to come up with the least
craptacular present I could give to Buffy.</p>
