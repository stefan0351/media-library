<p>The summer was almost over. Actually, in Sunnydale, it would
officially end tomorrow when all the kids would be going back to
school, back to 'the routine'. Usually, around this time every year,
I'd be feeling that certain mix of dread and depression with the
tiniest dash of expectation as the day loomed ever closer. This year
though, I felt none of that. But the truth was, I wasn't feeling much
of anything lately. I think I could pinpoint the exact moment when
inconsequential things like school and sleeping no longer meant
anything to me. Even though it was my senior year and I should have
been excited about picking colleges and looking towards my future.</p>

<p>I wasn't.</p>

<p>There was a very simple explanation for this. One that my mom knew
about so at least I didn't have to explain my sudden and intense
malaise. But she didn't really know exactly how deep it went. How
could she when she didn't know the whole story? I wondered idly if
she would freak had she known the truth. You see, the truth is that
the love of my life had just been ripped away from me and if that
sounds a little over the top and melodramatic, something straight out
of the mouth of a teenager, I don't care because it's the truth.</p>

<p>I didn't lay in my bed all day with the curtains drawn and country
music playing on the stereo. The only reason I didn't though was
because I didn't want to be alone in a place where every little thing
reminded me of Faith. So I didn't spend much time at home anymore.
Not if I could help it. Mom noticed but she didn't say anything about
it. I knew she missed Faith too but we never actually sat down and
talked about what we were feeling. If we did, I don't think I could
stop myself from crying once I started. That's the funny thing. You
would think I'd have cried but I haven't. </p>

<p>Not once.</p>

<p>It's not like I didn't feel like crying a lot of the time but it's
like there's a dam blocking the tears from falling. And along with
the tears, my emotions seem to have been shut off behind a wall that
I can't break down either. Maybe, deep in my heart, I didn't really
want to put in the effort because if I didn't acknowledge it, it
wouldn't hurt so much. At least that's the theory. And as most people
know, theory and reality aren't always one and the same.</p>

<p>I raised my head up, feeling the blazing sun scorch my skin and melt
my thoughts away. Then it got to be too much and I lowered my head
again. Like I said, I didn't spend much time at home anymore. Most
days, I spent it in the park, just like I'm doing right now actually.
The day after Faith left, I was just wandering around and somehow, I
ended up here. It was peaceful and most important of all, it let me
concentrate on other things outside of my own problems if only for a
few minutes and only to stare indifferently at the children playing
around under their mothers' watchful gazes.</p>

<p>Xander and Willow tried cheering me up but their forced brand of
cheer only made me want to escape more. To keep them off my back, I
told them all I needed was a little time so they gave me that for a
day or two after which they'd be on my back again. They just didn't
seem to realize that I didn't give a shit anymore. And when they made
a big deal about it like they kept doing, that would make me just
want to retreat from them even more.</p>

<p>Night was a little better because at night, I had a purpose. And that
purpose was basically to kick as much demon ass as I could aim my
foot at. It wasn't as much fun without Faith and the easy banter we
always shared on patrols but if I didn't do something at night, I
seriously think I would have gone crazy within a few short days.
There's only so many hours in the day that you can spend brooding
before you just want to do something...*anything*, even if it's just
walking around looking for trouble to find you.</p>

<p>And whenever I do find it which hasn't been very often because for
some reason the vamp activity dips down during the summer, I lose
that part of myself that always wants to be in control. And I don't
just lose it, I toss it out the proverbial window because in some
way, beating some vamp senseless makes me feel closer to Faith. I
think I'm even beginning to understand her unrelinquished joy when it
comes to fighting for the sake of fighting. It's a high, a rush that
I've only let myself experience in its most watered down form before.
But now...now I can't seem to get enough of it. </p>

<p>"Hey Buff." Xander came out of nowhere, sitting on the seat next to
me. Why couldn't they leave me alone and accept the fact that I
didn't want to be around anyone? "I knew we'd find you here," he said
after I didn't answer his greeting. Willow came up and sat on the
other side of me, in effect flanking me. I wondered if they planned
it that way.</p>

<p>"So what are you doing?" She asked, smiling as she looked at me
expectantly.</p>

<p>I suppressed the sigh that wanted to rip out and answered as civilly
as I could. "Sitting and staring."</p>

<p>"Wow, fun as that sounds," Xander said with a goofy grin, "Why don't
we all do something together. Maybe something that involves a little
more..."</p>

<p>"Activity?" Willow helpfully supplied.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Well, what say you Buffy?" I was just about to give him an
unequivocal no when he interrupted. "Oh, did I tell you? We won't
take no for an answer." That's when the sigh made it past my lips. I
knew they were just trying to help but...it really wasn't helping.</p>

<p>"Come on Buffy," Willow started to say. "We know how lousy you must
be feeling. We feel the same way. Faith was our friend too but you
can't keep dwelling on it. She isn't gone forever and you did say she
promised to come back."</p>

<p>"I know," I said, wishing that it did make me feel better. A year ---
that's how long I have to wait. I've started counting down the days,
the hours and even the minutes until her eighteenth birthday. And it
was starting to drive me up the wall. It just seems so futile and
such a long time until I could see her again. She said she would be
back and I trusted her but what was I going to do in the meantime?</p>

<p>"I'm betting ice cream will cheer you up," Xander said, breaking into
my chain of thought. "Couldn't hurt. And anyway, do you guys realize
that this is the last day of our freedom? For tomorrow...we learn."
He said it in such a ridiculously somber way that I couldn't help
chuckling weakly at him which earned me a full out grin. "You see, I
knew we could cheer you up. So how about it, Buffy? One last hurrah
for old time's sake?"</p>

<p>I shrugged, finally giving in and letting them first drag me to get
the promised ice cream and then to 'find the cheer' as Xander put it.
And, at the end of the day, I surprised myself, realizing that I did
indeed have fun. Not a lot of it but still more than I'd had in what
felt like the longest time. So by the time I went on patrol, I almost
felt normal again. Of course, normal in Sunnydale is a relative term.
For instance, what 'normal' teenager spent their nights wandering
around cemeteries with a stake in their pockets? I can count the
number on one hand and still have fingers left over.</p>

<p>I was making my way through the second of the cemeteries on my route
when a noise caught my attention. Immediately snatching the stake
from out of my pocket, I waited, every nerve ending tense and every
sense attuned for anything that didn't belong.</p>

<p>"It's just me," the familiar voice called out from the bushes a
second later. I relaxed, lowering the stake as Angel came out to
stand there in his usual black ensemble. The disappointment that I
hadn't found a real threat must have shown on my face because he
asked "You don't want to see me?"</p>

<p>"No, it's just that...I was hoping I could get a little action
tonight." I replaced the stake in my pocket and turned, knowing that
he'd follow me. I'd seen him a couple of times since coming back to
Sunnydale and strange as it might sound coming from a Slayer, I liked
his company. If the Watcher's Council could hear me now, I think
they'd choke on their tea. But at least with Angel, I didn't have to
maintain a front. I didn't have to repeat how fine and dandy I was
every five minutes.</p>

<p>"Things *have* been a little slow," he admitted, walking beside me.</p>

<p>"Yeah, what is it with demons anyway? Do they all go on vacation or
something?"</p>

<p>"You could say that," he answered thoughtfully. "Even demons need to
get away sometimes." I looked over at him and he looked right back at
me. No matter how hard I've tried, I could never read what he was
thinking and the same held true now.</p>

<p>"Why do you do it?" I suddenly asked, needing to know what made this
vampire tick. </p>

<p>"Do what?" He asked in the same exact monotone he used to say
everything.</p>

<p>"Why do you help me? You're a vampire. You're supposed to want me
dead. You're supposed to kill and murder and maim with abandon...but
you don't."</p>

<p>"You really want to know?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have asked if I didn't."</p>

<p>He came to a stop and faced me, steadily gazing into my eyes as if he
was gauging exactly how sincere I was. I didn't flinch away from the
intensity suddenly aimed at me, placidly returning his gaze.</p>

<p>"I did do all those things," he finally said, seeming to have come to
a silent decision. "Kill, murder, maim. I've done it and a lot worse.
I'm sure you know some of it already." I nodded, remembering what I'd
read about Angelus in one of Giles' old books. He wasn't kidding when
he said he'd done a lot worse. "I've done things that will plague me
for the rest of my life, things that haunt me every time I close my
eyes. And I'd still be doing those things if it weren't for a gypsy's
curse. You see, they gave me back my soul and, in addition, the guilt
of over two hundred years worth of death on my hands. So you want to
know why I help you? I help you to atone for myself. I help you to
wash the blood from my hands."</p>

<p>I stood, looking at him as he finished with something akin to
compassion stirring in my chest. I couldn't even imagine what that
must be like, to live, knowing that you'd spent centuries doing evil.
How could you ever make up for that? I silently watched as he looked
away, his gaze landing on everything but me.</p>

<p>"You're on the right path," I said, bringing his attention
back. "You're not that demon anymore and at least now, you're trying
to atone."</p>

<p>"But it'll never be enough," he said, echoing the thoughts in my own
head.</p>

<p>I didn't try to contradict him --- they were all words anyway, flung
between us and meaningless. The only thing that counts in the end is
what you do. So we continued walking, making our way through the rest
of the cemeteries in and around Sunnydale and even though there
should have been some tension between us after we had that little
talk, there really wasn't. Not in any vastly noticeable way. We
didn't find any vamps that night but that didn't come as much of a
surprise. By the time we got back to my house, it was around 2:30 in
the morning --- still early by my standards, at least for the last
couple of days but tomorrow was a schoolday after all. That early
wake up call was going to be a bitch.</p>

<p>Standing underneath my window, I motioned uncertainly inside. "You
wanna..."</p>

<p>"No. That's all right," he said, already turning away. "Maybe next
time."</p>

<p>"Maybe," I mumbled, watching him disappear into the night before
climbing up the tree that conveniently deposited me inside my room. I
changed and immediately went across the hall to Faith's room. I'd
discovered very early on that sleep was something frustratingly hard
to come by and it only came, if it came at all, surrounded by Faith's
comforting presence, however superficial it was. I wrapped myself in
the sheets that still had her lingering scent on them and closed my
eyes, immediately picturing her in my mind.</p>

<p>I wrapped the sheets tighter.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I turned my head away from the speck that was coming closer, growing
larger in the hazy, rolling heat. I knew who it was already. It was
the maid --- can you fucking believe this shit? I've got a fucking
maid. Yeah, at first I couldn't believe it either. I couldn't believe
it when the driver took me from Buffy's house to the airport where I
met up with Sara to board a private jet. But it's the truth. Up till
then, I hadn't even thought about where we were going to go. I'd just
assumed that we were still going to be living somewhere in
California. A ten hour flight kinda put an end to that assumption. I
mean, there's no way we could still be in California unless we were
doing circles in the air for all that time.</p>

<p>I'd never been on an airplane that long before --- hell, I'd never
been on an airplane period. It's kind of a drag. You can't really
walk around and stretch your legs --- well, you can but walking back
and forth in a two by four space made me dizzy. I don't know how
Buffy does it...there I go again. I'm thinking about her. Shit, I'm
always thinking about her and it's driving me up the friggin wall
that I can't see her. I can't even talk to her cause as far as I
could tell, there ain't no phones around this place. I don't even
know where this place is. All I do know for sure is that there's
water everywhere I turn. That's the definition of an island, isn't
it? </p>

<p>The maid was standing next to me now, wiping a hand across her sweaty
brow. I looked up through the dark tinted lenses of the sunglasses,
only able to make out her dark shape hovering over me, back lit by
the glaring white sun. She wasn't some French maid you see in movies
wearing fru-fru dresses and carrying a feather duster. No, this woman
was built like a truck, efficient as hell and a wearer of orthopedic
shoes. You know you don't mess with anybody wearing those ugly ass
shoes.</p>

<p>She spoke in some language I didn't understand, a language I couldn't
even begin to place with a particular country. When she first rattled
off words at me in that strangely, rhythmic rapid-fire pace, all I
could do was stare at her, wondering if there wasn't something wrong
with my ears. Then she spoke again and I realized I was in deep shit
cause obviously, she didn't speak English and I didn't speak whatever
the fuck her language was and Sara sure wasn't helping cause as soon
as we'd boarded that plane, she'd started popping pills and was now
loopier than a roller coaster ride.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's right. I've discovered that my mom is a damn junkie. She
can't go two hours without popping some prescription drug into her
mouth. I guess spending nine years in a mental institution will do
that to you. And what the fuck was I supposed to do? I'm supposed to
be her daughter, right? I'm supposed to help her. But the thing is,
she's a stranger to me. I don't know her, I don't love her, and a
piece of paper that says I'm her blood ain't gonna change that fact.</p>

<p>The maid's talking to me again, gesturing back towards the way she'd
come. I think her name's Mara but I'm not going to swear to it.</p>

<p>"All right, I get it," I said out loud. "Lunch, right? I'll be there
in a minute, okay?" She still stood there, a hulking shadow looming
above me. "Go!" I shouted. "I told you, I'll be right there." She
finally nodded and left, trudging clumsily through the pure white
sand in her black orthopedic shoes that I'd only ever seen nurses
wear.</p>

<p>As soon as she moved, the sun again found its way onto my face and as
I stared up into its too hot, too bright face, I wondered what Buffy
was doing then. I know she said she'd wait for me, whatever that
means to a seventeen year old but I wondered if she knew what that
meant. A year...a year was a long time. And it wasn't just her, it
was me too. I didn't know how a year would change me. Would I be the
same person I was now? I honestly believe that I would still love
her --- there's no way I wouldn't...but would it still be the same?</p>

<p>I sit up, removing the sunglasses and squinting as the brightness of
everything around me made my eyes hurt. I stare out at the crystal
blue water, knowing that a lot of people would call this place
paradise --- a friggin tropical paradise. But would they still feel
the same if they didn't have a choice about being here and there was
nobody to talk to, nobody at all? This wasn't paradise. This was a
fucking jail cell with a better view.</p>

<p>I finally tore my gaze away from the hypnotizing rolling of the waves
and got up, dragging the beach towel behind me as I made my way back
to the house. I walked for about ten minutes until I spotted the very
top of the house. The house wasn't really a house. It was more like a
big ass mansion. And the mansion sat atop a hill like a king on a
raised dais, surveying his domain. I also have a couple of other
names made up for it. Eyesore is probably my favorite. It's just so
friggin huge, like it was plopped down by a child who didn't know
where else to put it.</p>

<p>The mansion had red orangey tiles, white walls, and floor to ceiling
windows on the ground floor. It had green clinging ivy growing up the
front of the wall which kinda made it look a bit more decent. There
were wide stairs cut right into the hill which led up to the big
double doors that could have easily let a car pass through. There
were a lot of other smaller houses bunched up at the base of the hill
which I think the servants lived in. Sometimes, I wondered if these
guys missed their families or even if they had families in the first
place. I couldn't exactly ask cause of the language barrier but I
hadn't seen any kids since I'd been here.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, I really hadn't seen many of the servants
either. I knew they were around cause I could sense them, I could
hear their feet shuffling across the Spanish tiles. And anyway, it's
got to take a lot of people to run this place. But so far, aside from
Mara, I'd only seen one or two other people, not including Sara.
Whenever I catch a glimpse of them, they'd smile, mutter something I
couldn't understand and then they'd turn and walk away. It was almost
like they were trying to avoid me.</p>

<p>I pushed open the front doors, taking a moment for my eyes to adjust
from the almost blinding light that was outside. The foyer could
probably fit Buffy's whole house and still have room left over.
That's how monstrously big this place is. I really don't understand
why anyone would want to build something so huge. What's the point?
It's not like you really need this much space to be comfortable. In
fact, it's actually kind of uncomfortable to be surrounded by so much
nothingness.</p>

<p>I dumped the towel by the door, knowing that someone was going to
come and pick it up and walked towards the dining room. One thing I
can't complain about is the food. They feed me three square a day and
I don't think I've ever eaten better in my life. Breakfast, lunch and
dinner are served like clockwork --- each dish neatly laid out on the
table by the time I come in. The dining room was basically a big hall
with a long table in the center --- you know the kind, an updated,
modernized version of the tables you see in medieval castles. There's
twenty chairs all around, including the ones at either end and I
always eat at the head of the table. Makes me feel all important and
stuff.</p>

<p>The windows looked out to the sea, just like every other room in this
place. The water sparkled with sunlight playing across its surface,
drawing my eye again. It really was beautiful and who would've
thought I'd be living in a place like this. God, it feels so much
like a dream sometimes, a dream that I go from wishing I'd wake up
from to one where I thought I could stay forever. Bringing my eyes
down again, I look over the selection of food they'd prepared today.
Bowl of cold soup, salad with croutons, bread, cheese and a glass of
wine.</p>

<p>Like I said, it's the nicest I've ever eaten in my life. I dig right
in, not waiting for Sara to show up cause if she hasn't already made
an entrance, she wasn't going to. I didn't know what her deal was.
She tells me she wants to know me better, be a mom to me again but as
soon as we get to this place, she holes up in her room. Yeah, we did
get to 'talk', if that's what you want to call it, the first couple
of days we were here. But they only lasted around fifteen minutes and
most of the time was completely occupied by dead air and an awkward
tension so thick, I almost choked on it.</p>

<p>I finally asked her straight out on the third day why she even wanted
me here. It was wicked obvious she couldn't give a flying fuck either
way. She looked me right in the eye and told me it was cause I was
her only daughter and she wanted us to be a family again. Basically
the same shit she's been dishing since day one. Fine, if she wants to
keep sticking to that lame line then I'll accept it but when I ask
her about calling Buffy, she's all evasive, saying how the phone
lines are down or some other bullshit. And she seems so fucking
stoned most of the time, it's not even worth arguing with her about
it.</p>

<p>I finish off the soup, pass on the salad and take the bread, cheese
and wine out towards the back where there's a backyard as big as a
football field. I walk over to the big tree whose leaves overhang the
edge of the hill. I think this is my favorite place on this whole
island. Sitting down, leaning against the tree, you get a view of
everything, including the mainland where we had to board a helicopter
to get over here. It doesn't look so far away from here, almost close
enough to touch. Sometimes, I daydream about swimming there, just
leaving this place behind and taking off. But I don't even know where
I am, much less how I could get to California from here. Cause that's
basically what it boils down to. How do I get back to California?
Back to Buffy?</p>

<p>I bite off a big chunk of the bread, slowly chewing it as I gazed off
at that little bit of land floating on top of the water. After taking
a gulp of wine, I breathe in deeply, taking in the warmth and clean
scent in the air. There are no monsters here. No vampires terrorizing
the night. No big evil brewing in the dark corners. No excitement at
all.</p>

<p>I missed the fight, the adrenaline kick as I went face to face with a
suck ass vamp who wanted nothing more than to tear open my throat. It
might sound like I'm crazy but if you've never done it before, you
don't know how addictive it becomes. And, of course, I miss patrols
the most cause that's the only time me and Buffy can totally be what
we are --- Slayers. We were in our true element. We *were* creatures
of the night and what we did --- well, that was pure cat and mouse,
seek and destroy, hunting. Buffy never thought about it like that but
that's because she's who she is. But I was dark enough for the both
of us.</p>

<p>I still remember the last time we went on patrol together. It was in
LA actually, a couple of days after we first got there. We were both
feeling it, the restless energy that eventually drew us outside.
There weren't words to describe it. We acted like one that night. We
hunted, we stalked, we killed and it was so beautiful how fluid we
were. I missed that so much that I sometimes dreamed about it --- not
just Buffy and me being together but the way we moved together.
*That* was poetry in motion if ever there is such a thing.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, imagining it now in my mind in the lazy, hazy
afternoon. And I must have dozed off sometime later cause when I
opened my eyes again, the sun had already set and the stars were out.
I wondered vaguely why Mara hadn't called me in for dinner like she
usually does but I used the opportunity to gaze up into the sky,
looking at the stars through the leaves of the tree. </p>

<p>It was awesome. You know those shows you see in planetariums when
you're a little kid where they show you how the night sky might have
looked like two hundred years ago? This beat that by a mile. There's
just so many lights up there, sparkling, twinkling, however you want
to describe it, it's incredible. Just looking up makes you feel like
you're insignificant, a small speck of nothing living out your life
in the blink of an eye. Or it makes you feel like you're a part of
something so much bigger than yourself that you can't even take it
all in even if you live till you're a thousand years old. Whichever
way it makes me feel, it all depends on my mood at the moment.</p>

<p>I suddenly wished Buffy were here to see this with me and since she
wasn't, that bought me crashing back to earth. I got up and trudged
back to the house which was lit up like a christmas tree. I was so
fucking caught up in my own thoughts that I didn't notice the sound
of the helicopter until it was almost directly overhead, stirring up
the wind and whipping my hair around my face. It was probably a
hundred feet up and coming down slowly. I knew there was a helipad on
the roof of the house and it landed there a couple of minutes later.</p>

<p>Was this the mystery man Sara said she was going to marry? I'd been
surprised he wasn't here in the first place but I guess he was home
now. I continued inside, not entirely sure about what to expect. If
this guy thought I was gonna kiss his ass just cause he was stinking
rich and about to be my future stepdad, he was gonna get a nasty
surprise. Then again, maybe I could finally get some answers on the
phone issue. I mean, a guy like him's got to have an actual working
phone, right?</p>

<p>I walked through the back doors and towards the front entrance where
the grand staircase was located and I heard something I hadn't heard
for days. The sound of people's voices...that I actually understood.
I looked up, seeing two people walking down the stairs. One of them I
recognized right away. It was the skeezy lawyer guy, Howard. The
other person though I couldn't place. He was stockier, taller. He had
black hair, a tan, a full beard and for some reason, I kept thinking
this must be what a sea captain looks like. Kind of weathered, hard
bitten. But instead of a skipper's uniform, he had on a tailored dark
blue pinstripe suit that framed his body and made him look almost
elegant.</p>

<p>I stopped at the bottom of the stairs waiting for them to get down. I
was about to open my mouth and say something but the words froze in
my throat as soon as he turned towards me. His eyes seemed to lance
right through me, pinning me to the spot. And I couldn't move. I
couldn't move a fucking muscle. I'd never seen that color in anyone's
eyes before. An ice blue, almost clear. Like crystal and just as
hard. The rest of him was normal but those eyes...they weren't.</p>

<p>And they continued looking at me until he brushed past me followed a
moment later by Howard who had a smirk on his face as he looked my
way. I couldn't keep the shudder from running down my spine and I
closed my eyes, trying to get my nerves under control again. I heard
them walking towards the right wing of the house and their steps
echoed through my brain like the sounds were bouncing around the
inside of a large cave.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I hefted the sledge hammer that some vamp had been kind enough to
bring in with him before I'd staked him through the chest. The fang
gang had decided to dig up the Master's skeleton, hoping to revive
him from the dead or where ever he was now. Needless to say, they
hadn't been successful. I walked up to the still bloody skeleton on
the raised dais and stared at it. What I saw wasn't just a pile of
bones. I saw the fear in my own eyes right before he killed me. I saw
my mortality. I saw the dreams I'd had every night for weeks on end.</p>

<p>And now I saw pulverized powder as I lifted up the hammer and brought
it down again and again, crushing the bones beneath the heavy iron.
When I was finally done, when there was nothing left but splinters, I
let the hammer drop, staring almost disbelievingly at what I'd done.
But I didn't feel any remorse for my loss of control. Instead there
was only exhilaration. I allowed a grin to slip across my face as I
turned to everybody else in the room who either had stunned
expressions or no expressions in the case of Angel.</p>

<p>"Wow," Xander said, clapping his hands together in a sign of
finality. "I guess he won't be rising again...ever."</p>

<p>"And if he does, " Willow added, "He won't be looking too good as a
pile of goo."</p>

<p>Giles took a step forward, glancing at the Master's remains. "A job
well done, I'd say." That was about as good a compliment as it got
coming from him and I smiled wider, taking it for what it was worth.</p>

<p>"I think a celebratory night of Bronzing is in order seeing as how we
put down the Master *again*," Xander said, hooking an arm across
Willow's shoulders. "That is if it's really safe now." </p>

<p>Giles nodded and volunteered to stay behind to clean up which earned
him some silent appreciation from the rest of us. I took one last
look at the remains of something which had haunted me for so long
before finally turning my back on it for the last time and following
my friends out of the cavern.</p>

<p>We walked into the Bronze just as the band on the stage was starting
up a new song. It was crowded tonight and I started to get into the
mood of the hectic energy and pace running through the atmosphere
which mingled nicely with my own high after the fight. It didn't take
me long to notice how hyped I got every time out. It was like this
spring inside of me had been loaded and now I was just waiting for it
to pop back up again. And the only person who could know exactly how
I felt right now wasn't with me. </p>

<p>I couldn't sit still. It just wasn't in me. I looked around the club,
watching some people shuffling on the dance floor and I had a sudden
overwhelming urge to be out there with them, just moving. I looked
back to the three people at my table and made a quick
choice. "Angel," I said, getting his attention. "You wanna dance?"</p>

<p>His eyes widened slightly, almost imperceptible if you weren't
looking for it and then he nodded. I stood up, taking his hand and
leading him out onto the dance floor. I wasn't sure how long it had
been since the last time he'd danced --- was dancing even very
important in vampire society? --- but he looked really awkward at
first, as if he were trying to remember where to put his arms and
feet. Finally, after a few wince inducing moments, I took his hands
in mine and moved us closer, showing him the rhythm and letting him
follow along. By the end of the song, we were moving together almost
smoothly and I silently congratulated myself for being such a good
teacher.</p>

<p>But before I could get a bloated head, someone bumped into me from
behind and when I turned around, I got a faceful of attitude in the
form of Cordelia Chase. She didn't even bother acknowledging my
presence as she somehow managed to weasel her way in between me and
Angel.</p>

<p>"I don't think we've met," I heard her say with saccharin sweetness
and I couldn't help rolling my eyes as I made my way back to the
table, not bothering to call her on her manners of lack thereof.
Angel was on his own as far as I was concerned because I didn't much
feel like dealing with the self anointed queen of Sunnydale right now.</p>

<p>"Hey guys, why are you just sitting here? Go out, dance, have a
little fun," I said, sitting down and sipping from my water bottle.</p>

<p>"We are having fun," Willow said with a secretive grin. </p>

<p>"Yeah, your little dance with fangboy was very entertaining," Xander
added, with a quick glare to where Angel and Cordelia were still
talking.</p>

<p>"So?" Willow asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"So what?" I asked, utterly confused by what she was getting at.</p>

<p>"So what about you and Angel?" she asked, grinning again.</p>

<p>"What about me and Angel?" I looked over at Xander, hoping he'd clue
me in on what she was talking about but he was staring just as
intently at me and I couldn't help feeling a bit unnerved. "What are
you guys talking about? As far as I know there is no me and Angel." I
almost laughed at the thought of us being an item of conversation but
they didn't seem to be finding it as funny as I was. "Come on, he's a
vampire," I said, thinking that that was the end of it.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but he's...hot," she continued, glancing towards Angel again.</p>

<p>I did laugh then, watching as my innocent little Willow checked out a
guy for studliness. She was growing up so fast. "He's not exactly my
type," I said with a grin.</p>

<p>"So what is your type?" Xander quickly asked. "I mean, just for
future reference of course."</p>

<p>I hesitated, wondering if this area of discussion was really a wise
one to get into. But the words just seemed to tumble out of my mouth
before I really even knew what I was saying. "My type? A little on
the wild side. I like them with an edge. I like them strong and
beautiful. I want someone who I can trust with my life and with my
emotions. To hold me when I'm scared and make the whole world
disappear when we're together. I want someone who I can share my
whole life with, every aspect of it." When I finished, I focused on
the faces of my two friends who were almost gawking at me at this
point. "What?" I asked blankly.</p>

<p>Xander seemed to shake himself out of his stupor first. "That's
just...really specific."</p>

<p>Willow nodded along. "Kind of." Then she knit her brows together. "It
almost sounds like you have someone in mind. Do you?" She asked,
watching me curiously.</p>

<p>I looked away which wasn't such a great move since they seemed to
take it as an admission. I couldn't think of anything else to say. I
think I must have been blushing because I could feel my cheeks
beginning to burn up.</p>

<p>"Come on Buffy. Spill. If Faith were here --" Willow immediately
clamped her mouth shut. "Sorry."</p>

<p>"Why are you apologizing?" I asked, wondering at her contrite
attitude. "Faith isn't a hands off topic. She's very hands on..."
After reviewing that statement in my own head, I think I blushed a
deeper shade of red. "I mean...well, you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"It's just that we know how you get whenever we mention Faith,"
Willow said after a significant pause.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked even though I already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"Somber, moody, depressed as hell, on the verge of tears...Ring any
bells?" Xander asked in his usually blunt way.</p>

<p>I took another sip of water, more as a way of buying some time than
from being truly thirsty. "Faith's leaving was really hard on me," I
finally said to the silent agreement of my friends. "I guess because
we were so close...I mean *really* close." I had debated off and on
about whether to tell them just how close we were but every time I
got close to spilling the beans, I chickened out at the last minute.
And now was no exception. "But that doesn't mean I want you guys to
tip toe around the subject either," I continued. "So stop it, okay?"</p>

<p>Xander nodded. "Sure thing and since we're on the subject anyway, how
do you think she's doing right now?"</p>

<p>I shook my head, staring at the half empty bottle in my hand. "I
don't know. She hasn't called me yet."</p>

<p>"She hasn't?" I looked up, just catching Willow's furrowed brows
before she composed her features with a less overtly worried
expression. "Maybe she's just busy, unpacking and adjusting..."</p>

<p>"Yeah, maybe," I agreed, halfheartedly although I highly doubted that
unpacking could seriously take two weeks. With Faith, it's more like
two minutes. She just unzips her bag and dumps everything onto the
floor. I grinned fondly at the memory of her messy, sloppy ways which
inevitably led me back to my melancholy place. "You know what guys. I
kind of feel like going home now." When they began getting up too, I
motioned them back down. "No, you two stay. Have fun. I'll see you
tomorrow." I gave them a quick smile and began walking out of the
club.</p>

<p>"You want some company?" Angel slipped beside me, looking at me with
an almost expectant expression.</p>

<p>"From the look in Cordelia's eyes, I would have thought she'd wrap
you up for the rest of the night," I said, pushing through the club's
doors and walking out into the night.</p>

<p>"She had a hair emergency."</p>

<p>"Sounds urgent."</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>If I didn't know any better, I would have sworn I saw the smallest
flicker of a grin on his face. But I shook it off. Angel expressing a
sense of humor? That'll be the day.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" He asked after we'd been walking for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do a few more sweeps around the cemeteries," I
answered, my eyes scanning ahead, trying to pick out any vamp
activity. The fact that I was patrolling with a vamp didn't escape my
irony detector.</p>

<p>"You just foiled a plot to raise the Master. I think you've deserved
some R and R."</p>

<p>I glanced over at him. "You don't have to come."</p>

<p>He remained quiet, continuing to walk beside me.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I sat straight up, my heart pounding in my chest a mile a minute as
my eyes tried to focus in the dark room. I made an effort to slow my
breathing, straining to hear the sound that had woken me up but there
was nothing but silence, punctuated even more so by the soft lapping
of the waves outside on the beach. I brushed back the covers and got
off the bed, still trying to hear something...anything. It hadn't
been a dream. I didn't know how I was so sure but I was.</p>

<p>The only light in the room was pouring in from the moon outside,
casting a silver glow over everything. And it looked even brighter
than it really was cause everything in the room was either white or
pretty damn close to it. Made me feel like I was living in an old
movie where they hadn't learned how to add color yet.</p>

<p>Whatever noise it was that had grabbed me like a fucking hand
reaching into my dream didn't come again even though I waited for
five minutes just standing in the middle of the room, listening for
it. Finally, I walked towards the sliding doors which led out onto a
small balcony and, opening them, I stepped outside into the humid
air. Leaning on the rails, I stared out into the ocean which still
looked beautiful, even at night. I think especially at night. There's
just some peaceful vibe around the place that isn't there when the
sun's burning up the sky, making everything look artificially sweet.</p>

<p>I know I heard something. And it wasn't just the sound of an alarm or
a bird's cry or something cause I wouldn't have woken up, shaking
from my head to my toes if it were. I closed my eyes, feeling the
wind blowing softly across my face and thought about what I was doing
here, out in the middle of nowhere. If I was going to wake up to some
scary noise in the middle of the night, I wanted to wake up in
Buffy's arms.</p>

<p>Fuck. I still hadn't been able to call her yet. I hope she wasn't
thinking I'd forgotten her or something. That would totally go beyond
suckage into the tragic territory. Howard kept promising in his
slippery, greasy way that the phone lines would be back up soon but
for some reason, I didn't trust the guy. Call me strange but lawyers
just don't inspire much confidence in me, especially when they're
beaming that smarmy smile while they're talking and playing with
their gold pinkie ring the whole time.</p>

<p>And arguing with him didn't do much good. It's like insults rolled
right off this guy's back. So basically, I'm right back where I
started. I'm stuck on an island with no way out, no way to contact
anyone on the outside, and no one to talk to. No one I wanted to talk
to anyway. I was seriously beginning to wonder if I could swim the
distance to the mainland. Cause if something didn't change quick, I
sure wasn't going to stick around just so I could go slowly insane.</p>

<p>It's fucking funny you know? Here I am surrounded by beautiful things
and I couldn't give a crap about any of it. All I wanted was to get
away. Screw the clothes, screw the house, screw the food, screw the
scenery. It all meant nothing to me if my heart was breaking every
second of every day cause I couldn't have what I really wanted.</p>

<p>I wanted Buffy. Plain and simple. That's all. And if, by some
miracle, a fucking angel suddenly appeared out of nowhere and said
they could make my wish come true, you'd see me with my knees on the
floor, begging my little heart out.</p>

<p>But no matter how many crazy thoughts and daydreams run through my
brain, I know none of them will ever pan out cause if I ever did
manage to run away and get back to Sunnydale, they'll just come
looking for me again. And they have the money, the power, and the law
on their side to make life miserable for Joyce and everyone else I
cared about. That's what Stepano had said in his own measured,
expressionless way as he talked about the quality time me and Sara
were going to have together, like it or not.</p>

<p>Stepano.</p>

<p>Now there's one guy you don't want to be meeting in a dark alley. Not
even a light alley. It's the eyes. It's his freaking me out, scary as
hell eyes that frighten the piss out of me. Every fucking time he
looks my way, it makes my skin want to crawl off my body and make a
run for it. That's why I try to avoid him. Not too hard actually,
especially since there are so many damn rooms in this place that I
can just duck into one of 'em if I hear him coming.</p>

<p>But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if I'm the only one
who sees it. Am I the only one who's doing an Edgar Allan Poe? And if
I am, then what the hell is wrong with everyone else?</p>

<p>I take one last look at the stars and go back into my room, making
sure to slide the door shut behind me. The noise didn't come back for
an encore performance. At least I wasn't woken up again and the
morning just made it seem like a bad dream. Maybe it was some bad
cheese. Whatever it was, I'd almost forgotten about it by the time
I'd finished eating breakfast. </p>

<p>As usual, I was alone in the dining room. Even though Howard and
Stepano were around, they never came around when I was eating which
was good cause I seriously didn't think I'd be able to stomach
anything if they were. But just when I was polishing off the last of
the pancake, using the last piece to mop up the syrup, the sound of
patent leather shoes striking the tiled floors made me look up. </p>

<p>Howard strolled into the room, something between a smirk and a grin
across his face. "Morning."</p>

<p>"You noticed that too, huh?" I smirked back at him as I got up, ready
to motorvate.</p>

<p>"You don't like me much do you?" He suddenly asked in the same tone
of voice you'd use if you were ordering from a menu.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "What's there to like?"</p>

<p>He chuckled, moving closer. "You need a friend right now, Faith."</p>

<p>"Are you volunteering?" I asked, breezing past him towards the door.</p>

<p>"Maybe not a friend then. Perhaps an ally."</p>

<p>I hesitated at the doorway, wanting very much to tell him to screw
himself but at the same time, wanting to hear what he had to
say. "What do you mean?" I asked, finally turning around to face him.
Whatever he had to say, at least it might be amusing.</p>

<p>He was wearing a grin like he'd just gotten away with something as he
sidled up to me. "Things around here are about to go to hell real
soon," he whispered, his lips inches from my ear. "And when that
happens, I just want us to have a mutual agreement in place. If you
watch my back, I'll watch yours."</p>

<p>I ignored how his aftershave was making my nose itch and
asked, "What's going down?"</p>

<p>He pulled back, giving me a shit eating grin. "You'll know it when it
comes." And with that touch of wisdom, the smug bastard walks out.
But he did leave me with something to think about. Something was
going to happen and Howard was offering to help me out. Things were
getting interesting.</p>

<p>But if Howard was thinking he could play me like a puppet, I'd just
have to show him I wasn't his fucking Pinocchio. Shaking off his
slimy afterglow for now, I left the dining room and started towards
my room. The sun was shining like it always was and I was developing
a wicked nice tan from spending so much time lying on the beach. If
it wasn't for the fact that they had no TV's around this place, I
would've been a spud lying on the couch instead of a beach bum.</p>

<p>As I was walking down the hall towards my room on the second floor, I
had a strange urge to drop in on Sara. I couldn't even call her mom
in my own head. It's always Sara. And before I could think about what
I was doing, I walked in her room, closing the door quietly behind
me. Her room was alot like mine, only...fluffier and rufflier. It's
kinda ridiculous how many ruffles they could cram into one room, even
though that one room is huge and everything in it is on the same
scale.</p>

<p>The dresser's huge, the closet's huge, the mirror's huge. And the bed
she's lying on like an over-the-hill, exquisitely medicated ex-porno
star, is also huge, making her look tiny and shriveled in comparison.
They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree so what do I have
to look forward to? If this was it, I might as well kill myself now. </p>

<p>"Faiii--aaaa--thhh," she says, drawing out my name into three
syllables. "Baby, come here."</p>

<p>I go over, sitting on the edge of the mattress and look at her. She
was still young. Fuck, she was just thirty four. What the hell was
she doing lying in bed, night and day like a cripple, fucking up her
head with drugs?</p>

<p>She took my hand and stared at me with a glazed over expression in
her eyes. I waited for her to say something but she just kept petting
my hand and staring back at me.</p>

<p>"So...how's it going?" I finally asked. Can you say awkward?</p>

<p>"I'm feeling very good," she said with an innocent smile. "Especially
since Stepano's come back."</p>

<p>"Yeah, about him. How did you two meet anyway?" That part always
bugged me. How in the world did a rich bastard like Stepano meet my
mother, the former mental patient?</p>

<p>For a brief moment, I got a glimpse of something intelligent
sparkling in her eyes before it was gone. "I don't remember," she
said in a dead voice. "But I'm very happy with him. I love him."</p>

<p>"Right," I said, removing her hand which was clamped on mine like a
bear trap. "I'll just..." I motioned to the door and left as she
stared glassily after me. Well, that hadn't been too productive. It
made me sick in a way just seeing her like that and I had to wonder
what she was like before all this, before she had me. She must've had
dreams, hopes, and all that other nice shit that you have when you're
young and the whole world hadn't turned mean yet.</p>

<p>Listen to me. I sound like a jaded, bitter old woman. Hadn't wanted
to sound like that till I was at least thirty. At times like this,
there's only one way to get my mind back on track and I stride
towards my room again with a purpose. Walking in, I moved towards the
closet which is about as big as my room back in Sunnydale...no, make
that bigger. At first, I'd just dumped my stuff on the floor like I
always did whenever I got to a new place. But then Mara or whoever
had taken everything and hung it up which really looked pathetic
cause my shit doesn't even take up a fraction of the space inside
this closet. Then two or three days after I got here, new clothes
began appearing. It was like the clothes fairy had visited me during
the night. And this kept happening every other day since then till
the closet was almost half full.</p>

<p>And most jaw dropping of all, the clothes were all decent. Not one
pastel number hiding in the mix. But I didn't reach for any of the
new clothes as I passed them by. Instead, I took down my jogging
outfit --- Sunnydale H.S. T-shirt and shorts. Yeah, they're only
clothes but they're clothes that remind me of what I have waiting for
me if I just make it through this year, this month, this day.</p>

<p>Stripping off my clothes, I slipped on the familiar gray cotton
uniform which smelled of fabric softener and left the room, jogging
all the way outside. This place had just about everything you could
want but it didn't have a track so, basically what I did when I
wanted to work out was run around the entire island as many times as
it took to get me heaving and covered in sweat. </p>

<p>No better way to spend the day.</p>
