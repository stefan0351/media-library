<p>She was getting a splitting headache. And why do you ask was she getting a splitting headache? Because the friggin baby next door was screaming its bloody head off. The non stop wailing was still going strong after nearly half and hour. She'd tried pounding on the tissue thin walls hoping that the parents would get a clue and do something about it but knowing her neighbors, they were both probably passed out on the floor or getting high. Whatever the reason for the infernal crying, she'd had about all she could stomach. Grabbing a light denim jacket, she crawled out the window and onto the fire escape. Normally, nobody used it cause it didn't even extend halfway down the building. But that was never a problem for her since she'd always jump the remaining two stories.Anyway, it was better than taking the stairs which were always cluttered with garbage and other people. She listened with an attentive ear and damn if she couldn't still hear that damn baby. So focused was she on the irritating wail, she almost didn't hear the guy trying to sneak up behind her...almost. She kicked behind, connecting with something soft and hearing the sudden whoosh of air escaping from stunned lungs. Turning around, she narrowed her eyes at the bent over figure.</p>

<p>&quot;You didn't--you didn't have to kick me,&quot; he gasped, still trying to catch his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;And you didn't have to sneak up on me either. What do you want Donny?&quot;</p>

<p>The young man finally straightened up, brushing a stray lock of brown hair from out of his eyes. He couldn't have been more than eighteen judging from his baby face and thin, lanky build but the hardened expression on his face belied his age. &quot;Got a job you might be interested in...that is, if you still need the money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of job are we talking about here? Last time you hooked me up, I spent three months in juvie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know last time was an unfortunate freak accident. That guy shouldn't have come home for another hour at least. But this time, I'm telling you, nothing like that's gonna happen. It's practically foolproof.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Call me cynical but, somehow, I doubt that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I know you need the money so it's either this way or you working a nine to five job and, personally, I can't see you stocking shelves at the supermarket. Can you, B?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy involuntarily clenched her hands into fists, unable to deny the truth of his statements. With a false smirk that had been practiced to perfection, the blonde nodded slightly. &quot;Tell me about the job.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew I could count on you,&quot; Donny said, leading the way out to the street. &quot;Come on, I'll explain on the way.&quot;</p>

<p>Against her better judgement, Buffy followed because, at that moment, she had fifteen dollars to her name and a landlord riding her ass. Easy cash was easy cash no matter who offered it.</p>

<p>Donny explained the &quot;plan,&quot; if you could call it that as he led her to the parking garage downtown. They were each going to steal a car but not just any crappy old car. They were high end sports cars all the way. And once they delivered the cars to the buyers, they were home free with a couple thousand each. Actually, Donny had two things going for him which might help them pull it off. First, he knew the buyers and second, he had a partner inside the garage who would let them in and out. It was all about the connections. </p>

<p>When they got to the garage, Donny's contact came rushing up to them, annoyed that they had come so late in his shift. &quot;You got fifteen minutes Donny and then you're on your own. The cars are on level three. Get going.&quot;</p>

<p>Donny nodded and led Buffy past goatee boy as she'd dubbed him as soon as she'd caught sight of the oh so trendy cut that everyone was getting in a desperate and misguided attempt to show off their cool. Smirking slightly, she followed Donny down to the subterranean depths of level three where the two cars sat, parked side by side. Even though they weren't the only cars there, they were definitely the hottest things around. The sight automatically drew wandering eyes like a magnet. One was a fire-engine red Ferrari that was just waiting for an adventurous soul to climb in and race it down a highway at 100 mph, cops and the right lane be damned. The other car was a forest green Jaguar that was as sleek and muscular as its namesake and streamlined for speed.</p>

<p>They each went up to a car, Donny to the Ferrari and Buffy to the Jag and began to efficiently practice their craft. Within ten minutes, they were both tearing out of the garage in their recently acquired vehicles. Buffy flicked a glance back to see Donny's pal staring after them with hands on his hips. Gripping the steering wheel a little more tightly, she turned her attention back to the flashy red car she was trailing. So far, the plan was panning out to perfection and if it continued on its current course, she'd finally get some money back in her pockets. Leaning back, she luxuriated in the butter soft seats and reflected on the fact that she could very well live in this car and it'd still be a hundred times better than her crappy, little apartment.</p>

<p>Weaving in and out of traffic, they drove all the way to the warehouse district next to the docks. And it was into one of these warehouses that Donny drove into. Buffy slowed to a stop and got out of the car, scrupulously looking around the cavernous, dim interior.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Cecil! We're here!&quot; Donny yelled, walking to the back of the warehouse as Buffy rubbed her hands together, trying to alleviate the sudden, inexplicable tingling going up and down her arms. A strangled yelp made her snap her head up, trying to look into a particularly dark corner of the warehouse.</p>

<p>&quot;Donny?&quot; She called out. An eerie silence was the only answer she got back. &quot;Donny, where the fuck are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think he'll be answering you anytime soon.&quot; An unfamiliar voice said. Stepping out of the shadows, a rather formidable looking man appeared, followed by two other people of shorter stature. All three were dressed in long, black trenchcoats and the only woman of the trio had what looked like blood smeared across her lips. The rather creepy sight unnerved the blonde and sent alarm bells ringing throughout her body. Suppressing the urge to shudder, she attempted to back slowly away.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh good, you're going to run. How...pedestrian.&quot; The large man moved with a fluid grace and a lightening quickness that Buffy had never before witnessed. He had every intention of grabbing the blonde around the neck and draining every ounce of blood from the human's body but the crashing sound of glass as one of the large window panes shattered inwards stopped him mid-stride.</p>

<p>&quot;Starting the party without me?&quot; The person that had flown through the window in such high dramatic fashion still crouched with a knee to the floor and as she lifted her head, dark brown hair parted to reveal the grinning countenance of a young woman. Finally moving to stand, she laconically folded her arms across her chest, daring anyone to question her presence there.</p>

<p>&quot;And who are you supposed to be?&quot; The apparent leader asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Not keeping up on your current events, jack?&quot; Twirling a wooden stake from seemingly out of nowhere, the brunette suddenly hurled it into his heart and before Buffy's very eyes, instead of bleeding or even dropping to the ground, the man turned to dust...literally disintegrating. She stood stunned as did the other two trench-coated followers while the newcomer launched immediately into an attack. Shaking out of the paralysis, she ran over to the dark corner that the three...creatures had emerged from to find Donny slumped on the floor. A pool of blood laid below his head and she could tell he was already dead. His torn and shredded neck told her as much. For a minute, she almost felt sad for the guy. It wasn't like he was bad or anything. He just knew what it took to survive. Thing of it was, you had to do a lot of nasty shit to survive. Closing her eyes briefly, she looked back to the center of the warehouse to see that the brunette had already taken care of the other two creatures. From the delighted smile on her face, Buffy surmised that she really enjoyed her work.</p>

<p>&quot;You all right blondie?&quot; She asked, wiping the dust from her clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;The name's B,&quot; Buffy corrected irritably, stepping up to the other girl. &quot;What were those things you killed. They couldn't have been human cause humans don't turn to dust when you stick it in the heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B? What's that stand for?&quot; She asked, selectively hearing what she wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;Who cares?&quot; Buffy yelled, letting the stress of the situation get to her. &quot;You've got to tell me what those things were.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; She asked smirking. &quot;You know, you're beautiful when you pout,&quot; she added smiling, before turning around to walk out of the building.</p>

<p>Buffy stood rooted to the spot, feeling the unexpected blush creeping up her neck. A few words and this is what she turns into? Disgusted at herself, she ran to keep up with the other girl, unable to keep the anger from her voice. &quot;Look, I think I deserve to know...they killed a friend of mine and they probably would've done the same to me if you didn't come along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Believe me B, you'd be better off not knowing. C'mon, you've got to tell me what your real name is. I can't keep calling you a letter of the alphabet. Tell you what, I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours.&quot; She aimed a lascivious grin at the still unsettled blonde. Usually, after she saved someone, she would just leave, ignoring any and all questions but this girl was too cute to walk away from.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy all right? The name's Buffy. Now do you see why I'd rather be called B?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don't know. I think it's kinda cute. Suits you actually. You can call me Faith or F if you're still hung up on one letter names.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy stepped in front of Faith, stopping her from walking. &quot;Please Faith, I need to know what those things were. Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith stopped short and looking into Buffy's eyes, she started to speak. For whatever reason, she decided to tell this girl the truth. &quot;They were vampires. Just like in the stories. They need to drink blood to survive and the only way to kill them is to put a stake through their undead hearts.&quot; Faith waited for the inevitable nervous laughter that always preceded accusations that she was crazy and just making this stuff up but Buffy did neither. Instead, she asked a question Faith didn't expect and it was asked in all seriousness.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you then?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith couldn't keep the proud lilt out of her voice when she answered. &quot;I'm a vampire slayer. Half of the Chosen Two. In every generation, there are two chosen to defeat the forces of darkness. And vampires are high up on the totem pole of darkness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what you're telling me is that not only is there someone else like you but there's more than just vampires out there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; she said, impressed that Buffy had gotten all that and still seemed relatively calm. &quot;You're taking this rather well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I _did_ just see some guy get dusted, literally. Kind of hard to ignore something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'd be surprised. People like to label things and put them in neat little categories , only when it doesn't fit, they put it out of their mind like they hadn't even seen it---the power of denial.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you. So where are you going now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm done for the night so I guess I'm going back home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on. Wait here, I'll be right back.&quot; Buffy ran back to the warehouse as Faith watched in amusement. She knew she should just take off now before the blonde got back but her feet refused to move. It had been so long since she had had anybody else to talk to besides her watcher that she couldn't pass up the opportunity now. And, of course, the other girl was just too cute. Smiling, she waited patiently until Buffy came running back with a smile on her own face.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you do?&quot;</p>

<p>Pulling a hefty roll of bills from her jacket pocket, she answered, &quot;Just going back for my share.&quot;</p>

<p>With a raised eyebrow, Faith nodded and proceeded to walk in the general direction she was headed before, only this time,&nbsp; with Buffy in toll.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>They stopped on the way to Faith's apartment to get some junk food after Faith said something about being hungry and Buffy, well, she hadn't eaten all day unless you counted that hard piece of bread she found in the back of the fridge. And as they ate, Faith told her more about what she did, why she did what she did, and who helped her in the fight against evil.</p>

<p>&quot;So you work for him?&quot; Buffy asked, taking a big bite from her burger.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's more like a partnership. He finds the demon and I slay the demon. You see how that works?&quot; At the curious stares the statement drew from the few remaining patrons still dining at the fast food restaurant, Faith lowered her voice somewhat. &quot;And he's cool too, for an old guy. Even gives me an allowance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When did you start doing this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I was fifteen.&quot;</p>

<p>'How old are you now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sixteen. But that's normal cuz all slayers are around my age when they're called.&quot; Taking a healthy swig from her milkshake, she asked, &quot;How old are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Older than you,&quot; Buffy answered with bravado which only made Faith grin at her in that oh so smug way of hers. &quot;You said something about the Chosen Two. Where's your other half?&quot;</p>

<p>At the question, Faith lost all traces of the grin and began tearing little pieces from the napkin in her hand. &quot;...She's dead. Some vamp got her,&quot; she mumbled, continuing her compulsive tearing. Buffy didn't comment, not being very good in the role of comforter but she was saved from the awkward situation when Faith started speaking again. &quot;Whenever one of us dies, there's supposed to be another girl called but we still haven't been able to find her yet.&quot; She shrugged, playing with the small mountain of tissue pieces she'd created. &quot;Whatever, I can handle things fine on my own.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don't doubt it.&quot; The words all but slipped out as Buffy looked up to see that the grin was back on the other girl's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Faith said simply.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded, shrugging off the acknowledgement and finishing her fries.</p>

<p>They finally arrived at Faith's apartment around two in the morning. It was in a blue collar section of the city but still world's apart from the slums Buffy was used to. She followed the brunette up the stairs to the second floor and waited as she jiggled the lock to get the door open.</p>

<p>&quot;Screwy lock&quot; was her only explanation as she went in.</p>

<p>Buffy followed into the living space and immediately staked out all the valuables lining the room. It was a reflex action, much like the knee jerk thing the doctor would do to you. They had some pretty weird shit too. A bunch of old looking books, masks, and...weapons. There was a stockpile in the corner: a couple of knives, a crossbow, and a bunch of stakes spilling out of a bag. Tearing her attention away from the sight, her eyes roamed to the couch where a middle aged man laid, apparently asleep. </p>

<p>&quot;Giles?&quot; She asked Faith, pointing her head at the slumbering figure.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's him,&quot; Faith whispered, pulling the covers more tightly around the man in a tender gesture that made Buffy uneasy. Actually, any kind of tenderness or show of affection made her uneasy. She just wasn't used to people acting like they might care. It didn't fit in with her life philosophy. Turning away, she wandered into one of the bedrooms off to the side. With its cluttered appearance and Playstation console prominently on display, she guessed it was Faith's room.</p>

<p>&quot;Like my room?&quot; Faith asked, sliding past her to enter, her breasts brushing lightly off Buffy's arm.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up with a quirked eyebrow, unsure if the gesture was deliberate or not. As she searched Faith's face, all she saw was the ever-present grin that she'd grown used to by now. Hit on by a sixteen year old girl, Buffy thought with a frown. &quot;Nice,&quot; she finally said to both the observation and to Faith's earlier question. &quot;Did you do the decorating yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, the whole thing does have a woman's touch, doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only if that woman were a slob of a teenager,&quot; she teased. Buffy walked over to the only photograph in the whole room, taped to the wall next to the bed. &quot;Who's this?&quot; she asked, pointing to the figure of the pretty young black woman in the picture, whose shoulders Faith had thrown an arm across.</p>

<p>&quot;That's Kendra,&quot; Faith said softly, moving to stand behind the blonde. &quot;She was a slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy turned around, catching the morose expression on the younger girl's face. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be. She died doing her job.&quot; Faith turned away and, walking out of the room, she added, &quot;And anyway, I got the bastard who killed her.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy took one last look at the photo before walking slowly out of the room. &quot;I gotta go,&quot; she said to Faith's back.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sure...it's kinda late though. You sure you're gonna be all right going home?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy almost laughed at the concern she was being shown but managed to stop herself in time. &quot;I think I can make it home all right. I'll see ya around Faith.&quot; She walked out of the apartment before Faith could answer.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>Faith looked on wordlessly as Buffy walked out the door without a backward glance. That had been different, she thought leaning against the back of the couch. What had possessed her to tell this stranger so much? Things she wouldn't have even told her mother, if the bitch hadn't ditched her way back when. She shifted uncomfortably, trying to come to terms with her actions. If Giles ever found out, he'd be all 'You have to act more responsibly, Faith.' Like she wasn't trying to do just that. She would never admit it to anyone but sometimes, the&nbsp; whole saving the world and beating back evil schtick really got to her. It would get to the point where she felt like she were trying to carry an elephant&nbsp; on her back&nbsp; Ever since Kendra died, she felt the strain even more so but she couldn't tell Giles. The guy trusted her, he treated her like she could do anything if she put her mind to it. How was she going to tell him that she was about to break? Combing back her hair wearily with one hand, she made her way back to her room. Curling up on the bed, she waited for sleep to overtake her mind which was swirling with insecurities and doubts.</p>

<p>The next few days passed like all the days before. In the morning, Giles would cook breakfast and that was the time when they would discuss what had happened the night before. Afterwards, she would be homeschooled by her watcher until she thought her brain would ooze out of her ear. Whenever she complained that studying wasn't her thing, Giles would shoot her that exasperated look from his repertoire of confused, annoyed and thoughtful expressions and tell her that it was his duty to make sure she became an educated member of society. Faith never brought up the fact that she'd probably be dead within a year anyway so why bother. If he wanted to waste his time, far be it for her to ruin his sense of usefulness. She just wished some of the subjects he taught were more interesting than Mycenaen pottery and nineteenth century novella structures. After the force fed educational time, they'd train. The physical activity always perked up her spirits. Being a slayer, she had a natural aptitude for all things physical and it always gave her a kick to see what her body could do and how fast it could recover after she'd pushed it to its limits. </p>

<p>After training, she was free until patrol at night. She usually spent that time rotting her brain away in front of the television, playing with her games, or walking around the city, looking for an arcade. She couldn't socialize, what was the point? They either asked too many questions or they tried to monopolize too much of her time. She was just better off being alone, no ties, no worries. Sometimes, the loneliness got to her though. And the ache became especially apparent ever since she met Buffy. She thought about the other girl constantly, wondering what she was doing, who she was with, who she was doing. She thought about the blonde so much, it was almost bordering on the obsessive. She tried telling herself that it was stupid to think about someone who she knew nearly nothing about and who had probably forgotten all about her anyway but she couldn't put it out of her mind. Every night, during patrol, she'd make up an excuse to wander by the warehouse where they'd first met, hoping to catch sight of the other girl. And every night, she was disappointed, finding no trace of Buffy. What she did run into were a couple of scabby demons, some slimy fish people and vampires, lots and lots of vampires. Of course, such a large population crammed into such a tiny little island practically screamed &quot;All you can eat buffet&quot; to the undead bloodsuckers. She was so worn down by the time she returned home that she was unconscious as soon as her head hit the pillow. Giles was concerned also by the sudden hike in demonic activity. Even in a place such as New York, it was a bit unusual but he had yet to find out the reason behind it. All he could offer his charge were the unnecessary caution to be careful whenever she went out at night. She was just coming home from one such patrol, bruised and weary, when she finally ran into Buffy by pure accident. Cutting across a dark alleyway, she was nearly knocked over by the blonde who was barreling down the other way.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; she called after the retreating figure.</p>

<p>On hearing her name, Buffy turned back, grabbed Faith's hand and pulled the other girl out of the alley with her. Faith didn't know where she was being led, only that they were flat out running away from the cops trailing at their heels. Cops who kept yelling at them to stop or they'll shoot. Eventually though, the two girls lost their pursuers huffing and wheezing on the side of the street.</p>

<p>&quot;YEAH!&quot; Buffy shouted, slowing to a stop a few blocks away. &quot;HOOOO!&quot; Laughing heartily, she turned to look at her companion who was having a little less fun than she seemed to be enjoying. &quot;Hey Faith. We've got to stop running into each other like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith had literally dreamed of seeing the blonde again but now that the dream was fulfilled, she found herself tongue-tied. It didn't happen very often and she didn't like it one bit that it was happening now.</p>

<p>&quot;So whatcha doing?&quot; Buffy asked when Faith failed to say anything. &quot;Out slaying late?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, actually,&quot; she finally managed to get out. &quot;I was just heading home when I got involved in this little police chase. Wanna tell me about what's happening?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you know the cops. Always chasing after you for one thing or another,&quot; Buffy said, trying to evade the question. &quot;Sorry you had to get involved but it's not like they got a good look at you...I need to go meet some people so, I'll see ya around, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; Faith said immediately. &quot;Do you want to go get lunch or something later?&quot;</p>

<p>An amused grin appeared on the blonde's face as she slowly asked, &quot;Are you asking me out on a date?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith matched her grin for grin, clearly getting more comfortable the longer they talked. &quot;Yeah Buff. I'm asking you out on a date. So what do you say?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy sidled right up to the brunette, bringing her lips within an inch of Faith's own and whispered, &quot;I'll pick you up. One okay with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith had to fight herself not to move that extra inch to bring their lips together. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she muttered, eyes entirely focused on those soft, velvety lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Great,&quot; she said, eyes lighting up. Placing a soft kiss on the tip of the other girl's nose, she ran off completely missing the wide smile forming on Faith's face.</p>

<p>Buffy tore off down the street, away from the cops that were chasing her. They'd been waiting outside her apartment and had jumped her as soon as she'd walked up to the front door. Of course she'd run, why wouldn't she? Cops and trouble were synonymous in her mind. Most of the time, the trouble landed squarely on her shoulders and if they went so far as to stake out her apartment, she didn't even want to imagine the amount of trouble she was in for. And now, she couldn't even go back to her apartment cause she had to lay low until the cops lost interest which could take days at the least. In the meantime, she had to find some place to stay and some money since all her cash was still in her room. Winding her way across town, she stopped in front of a building, most of whose windows were boarded up. She really didn't want to be here but neither did she feel like spending the night out on the streets. Steeling herself with a deep breath, she buzzed the intercom and waited for the familiar voice to come through.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah? Who is it?&quot; Came the crackling hiss from the electronic device.</p>

<p>&quot;It's me. Can I come in?&quot; There was a long moment before the buzzer sounded loudly.</p>

<p>As Buffy climbed up the stairs, she experienced a nervous fluttering in the pit of her stomach. She hadn't seen him for awhile and didn't know what kind of reception to expect. What she was met with as soon as she walked through the apartment door was cold animosity.</p>

<p>With hair tousled from sleep and clad in a t-shirt and boxer shorts, Xander looked like he'd just been woken up. &quot;What do you want B?&quot;</p>

<p>Getting right to the point since she knew she couldn't get anything past him anyway, Buffy said, &quot;I need a place to stay for awhile. The cops are all over my place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you want to stay here?&quot; He asked with an incredulous undertone.</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged and then nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;You think you can just come here--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Save me the lecture,&quot; she interrupted, cutting him off. &quot;Look, if you don't want to put me up, I'll just leave, all right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it is not all right. You can't just waltz in here and then walk out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what do you want me to do?&quot; </p>

<p>Xander stared at her in frustration before finally coming to a decision. &quot;Take the couch and don't make too much noise.&quot; He shuffled back to his room and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Buffy laid down on the couch, reflecting on her good fortune to have such a nice ex-boyfriend. She didn't understand why he let her get away with most of the things she did but damn if she wasn't grateful for it.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>The next morning, Faith woke up earlier than usual, nearly giving Giles a heart attack that he didn't have to go through the morning ritual of slowly prodding her awake. Faith shrugged off the astonished expression on her watcher's face, embarrassed enough that she was this excited over the coming lunch date. And as the hour approached, she grew so tense, she was nearly vibrating off her chair. She hadn't listened to a thing Giles had been saying all day and by his irritated look, he knew it too. He finally let her go with an exasperated sigh, knowing that nothing would be seeping into her mind until she got whatever it was out of her system. Gladly accepting the early dismissal, she bounded out of the room to wait for Buffy outside on the stoop. And that's where she was still waiting when the blonde finally showed up an hour late, running up to her with an apologetic smile affixed to her features.</p>

<p>&quot;Been waiting long?&quot; She asked, standing on the bottom step.</p>

<p>&quot;Nah,&quot; Faith replied, beaming in delight. She was just glad that Buffy showed at all.</p>

<p>Buffy walked slowly up the steps to stand in front of the still seated brunette. &quot;Well what are we waiting around here for? Let's go.&quot; Offering her hand, she pulled the other girl up so they stood toe to toe, bodies pressed lightly together. As she had done the night before, Buffy planted a soft kiss on the other girl, only this time it was on the lips before breaking apart to walk down the steps. The reason she kept doing that was that it seemed to throw Faith off so much. Looking back at the glazed over expression on the young woman's face, her grin widened just that tiny bit.</p>

<p>The morning had started off on the decidedly crappy side of the bed. Xander had poked her awake at around seven to announce that he was going to work. The sadistic gesture earned him a nasty look and a groan as Buffy rolled over onto her side and went back to sleep again. She didn't wake up until it was nearly one. And then, she forgot where Faith lived, spending another hour searching the general neighborhood where she kinda remembered dropping the other girl off. But now that she was here, her mood&nbsp; improved drastically.</p>

<p>They spent the rest of the day together, each getting the opportunity to forget their individual problems for a few precious hours. Each one couldn't remember the last time they'd had this much fun and Buffy continued teasing Faith at every turn, deriving as much pleasure from the younger girl's refreshing bashfulness as well as from the act of teasing itself. And it was cool that Faith paid for everything without even having to be asked. In a way, it was almost kinda old-fashioned, if she were a guy that was. But it was sweet nonetheless. They ended up winding down the day sitting in Bryant Park watching the people walking past as night descending across the sky. The only word to describe the moment was peaceful. But the moment passed way too quickly as the beeper at Faith's waist started beeping. Looking down reluctantly, she knew what it would say without even needing to see it. Giles was paging her, no doubt pissed that she went missing the entire day.</p>

<p>&quot;The world needs you already?&quot; Buffy asked, leaning back on the bench.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it always seems to need me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't want to go, blow it off. It's just one night,&quot; she said lazily, glancing at her briefly before turning her focus back to the fountain.</p>

<p>Faith was sorely tempted to do just that but the voice in her head, which sounded suspiciously like Giles, would have none of it. &quot;I can't do that,&quot; she said in frustration.</p>

<p>&quot;You are _way_ too mature for your age,&quot; Buffy lamented, turning fully around to look the other girl in the eyes. At Faith's dejected expression, she amended her statement quickly. &quot;Which is great, y'know cause if you were like me, the world would go to hell and shit.&quot;</p>

<p>That brought a smile back to the brunette's face which in turn brought out a similar one to Buffy's own. The beeper sounded again, if possible, even more annoying than the last time. But before Faith could get up, Buffy pulled her close, bringing their lips together, her tongue asking for and receiving a quick welcome. Faith could easily see losing herself in the sensation, in Buffy because she was starting to do just that. It was only because the blonde broke away that Faith didn't lose all recollection of her duty. As it was, she wished more than ever that for one night, for _that_ night, she could forget about her responsibilities. But it weighed too heavily to toss off so easily. Faith groaned a bit, biting back the many temptations swirling in her head to ask, &quot;You have my number, right?&quot;</p>

<p>At the nod, Faith got up and moved in for one more kiss before finally leaving. As expected, when she reported back, Giles was up in a tizzy though he did manage to express it in an oh-so-stiff English manner. She endured the stern lecture, all the while thinking about Buffy until she was finally dismissed to go on patrol. Having spent the day together, she was still rather unclear on some crucial aspects of her friend's life, such as where she lived, what she did, or even a phone number where she could be contacted. All that aside though, she knew one very important thing for sure which was that she was totally falling in love. She'd had crushes before but this was a whole other experience. It was comparable to being consumed from the inside, the emotion allowing precious little else in. The only thing that that did squeeze through was the omnipresent responsibility of being the slayer and of course, the terrified yell that just split through the air. Quickly taking off to the source of the sound, she found a familiar sight: Two men advancing menacingly on a huddled figure.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Fresh meat over here!&quot; She yelled, drawing their attention. She knew immediately that they were vampires. Being a slayer, she had an affinity for such things. &quot;I'm nice and juicy and yours if you can get me.&quot;</p>

<p>She easily dusted the first one who charged head on into her stake but the second one required more work, alerted to the fact that she wasn't just an easy meal. More work but eventually dusted anyway. Hearing a noise behind her, Faith whirled around to find the vamps' victim walking unsteadily towards her.</p>

<p>&quot;They weren't human,&quot; he said, stating the obvious. &quot;They had fangs popping out and their face was all contorted and...Oh Goddamn, you kicked their ass into dust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you hit your head or something buddy? You must have hallucinated it or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, denying it emphatically. &quot;I saw you kill them. And you saved me too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to me, you didn't see anything, understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know what I saw,&quot; he insisted, unwilling to let it go. &quot;You saved my life.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith turned away, intent on leaving but the guy followed her.</p>

<p>&quot;Those were vampires weren't they? I've read about stuff like this. So if they're what I think they are, does that make you Professor Von Helsing or what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or what,&quot; Faith answered shortly. Why couldn't this guy be like all the others? Why couldn't he just chalk it up to bad weed or something? Why wouldn't he shut up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name's Xander, Xander Harris...&quot; he waited for her to supply a name but got absolutely nothing. &quot;I'd just like to know your name so I know who I'm thanking.&quot;</p>

<p>She sighed, finally giving in to his persistence. &quot;Faith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Faith? That's a nice name.&quot;</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes at the originality of that line.</p>

<p>&quot;When you took on those vampires, it was a thing of beauty. It belonged in the Met or something. And they didn't even stand a chance against you either.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith couldn't help but smile a little at the lavish compliments and Xander happened to catch it right before it disappeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me buy you dinner. It's the least I can do for the person who saved my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's really not necessary--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lunch? Breakfast? I'm a pretty persistent guy so I have to warn you, I'll probably bug you until you say yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Stopping, Faith looked at him, not doubting in the least that he would do just that. It was only one meal, she thought ruefully, what harm could it do? &quot;All right, fine,&quot; she relented to which Xander beamed a euphoric smile. &quot;Tomorrow, lunch. You know the diner on West 4th a couple of blocks from the subway station?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I know it. One o'clock good with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith nodded tersely, continuing to walk down the street, thinking that he'd leave her alone now. He didn't. Xander ended up following her for most of the night and she couldn't yell at him for doing it cause he actually thought he was watching her back and that there was safety in numbers. She got rid of him by finally threatening to cancel the lunch date. She'd really have to stop doing this. That was two people she'd told too much to in just the past couple of days. Buffy, she wasn't so worried about since the blonde didn't really seem all that affected by the information. But Xander was a whole other story. He acted as if he just gained admittance to the Justice League of Superheroes and now had a duty to help her fight vampires. She'd have to set him straight tomorrow when they met for lunch before he got himself into real trouble.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>Buffy woke up the next morning at the same ungodly hour, poked awake by the same ungodly person. But instead of announcing that he was going to work and then leaving her be, he continued sitting there on the couch, preventing her from going back to sleep again. She saw that words were spewing forth from his mouth but it wasn't until she concentrated that the words began making sense. She caught the tail end of &quot;...and she's great y'know. Beautiful, strong, smart.&quot; Either Xander was obsessing about Janet Jackson again who he had a thing for or the Boy Wonder had finally met someone.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's all great and good Xander,&quot; she interrupted. &quot;I'm real happy for you but can we talk about it later. I didn't get to sleep until three and I'm hung over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B, when are you going to learn that this lifestyle of yours is going to kill you some day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know it. I just don't care,&quot; Buffy said, tossing the covers back over her head, hoping that he'd get the hint. He did, after sitting there for a moment longer and Buffy promptly fell back to sleep again only to be awoken a few hours later by a loud pounding at the door. Even in her groggy state, she knew better than to open it. Whoever was on the other side should've used the buzzer. That's what it was there for. The pounding sounded again, this time accompanied by an authoritative voice, &quot;Police, open up!&quot;</p>

<p>That got Buffy hopping in a hurry. Pulling on her shoes and pants in record speed and not necessarily in that order, she ran to the only window in the whole apartment, located in Xander's room and cursed upon seeing the bars running vertically across the only route of escape she had. Not giving up just yet, she pulled the window pane up and grasped one of the iron bars, pulling for all she was worth. It broke off in her hand, nearly sending her tumbling backwards at the ease with which it ripped out. Regaining her balance, she heard a loud crash in the other room, no doubt indicating the door had just been rammed in. Before she could work on the remaining bars, the cops were busting into the room, guns drawn, shouting and yelling up a storm. Buffy knew when she was beat as she slowly raised her hands in the air, making sure not to make any sudden movements in case either of the men had a hair-trigger finger. No matter how many times it'd happened or continued to happen, the indignity of being cuffed and handled by the cops never sat well with her. In fact, it was one of the things she truly hated in life.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>Xander came back home in a supremely good mood. He'd been in a good mood ever since his lunch with Faith. She was one of the most extraordinary women he'd had the good fortune to meet and it wasn't only because she was the slayer either, although that was pretty amazing in and of itself. &quot;The slayer&quot;---his mind warped at the concept. He had wrangled the information out of her even though she was adamant at the start about his total non-involvement in that side of her life. But he was good at the art of persuasion. It was about the _only_ art he was good at and he'd taken full advantage of his natural talent, managing to wheedle the story from Faith plus a promise for dinner at a later date. All in all, he couldn't help but be in a great mood by the time he returned home from work. Unfortunately, the mood ended as soon as he walked through his apartment door. </p>

<p>First off, he didn't actually walk through the entrance---more like he stepped over the broken shards of the door that used to stand there had it not been busted wide open. He'd been in situations like this--who in New York hadn't been in situations like this? Grabbing a bowling trophy from the top of the TV set, he warily walked through the apartment, checking to make sure that any and all robbers were long gone. He ended the search in his bedroom, having found absolutely nobody and having ascertained the fact that nothing was missing. Which was weird to be sure, assuming that it had been a robbery. As he gazed in mild astonishment at one of the bars that should've been lining his window instead lying on the floor, Xander had to wonder if it was a robbery at all.</p>

<p>Buffy came back a few hours later like she was wont to do. Having spent the majority of the day being interrogated by the police, she was in a sour disposition. They'd grilled her on the night Donny had been killed, no doubt getting her description from the garage attendant. They didn't know shit, that much was for certain. Otherwise, they'd have charged her with something. Instead, they'd tried every angle to get her to talk about what had happened, even plying the good citizen card, telling her that there was a gang of occult practitioners responsible for various deaths committed throughout the city and that Donny's death was no doubt linked to them. But after awhile, it became painfully apparent that she wasn't going to cooperate so they let her go, reminding her not to run the next time they wanted her for questioning. Opening the door which had been propped up somehow, she met Xander's gaze evenly, surprised he was even awake this late.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll pay for the door,&quot; she said, sitting down on the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;Forget the friggin door. What happened?&quot; As much as he tried to muffle the concern from his voice, it came through anyway, causing the familiar smirk to form on Buffy's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Xander, are you genuinely concerned over my well being?&quot; She asked, smiling at him seductively.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop doing that. I hate it when you do that. Just tell me what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The cops busted in. Wanted me for some questioning. No big.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No big? They broke down the door. And what about that bar in my window? What happened to that?&quot;</p>

<p>She carelessly shrugged, &quot;It broke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was an iron bar, fixed in concrete. How did it break?&quot; By now, Xander was used to Buffy's flippant attitude concerning most things in and around her life but he wanted a real answer nonetheless.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, I grabbed it and it broke. I'll pay you for that too all right? Actually, I don't even know why I'm here. Thanks for putting me up, you've been a doll as always X. I'll talk to you later.&quot;</p>

<p>Giving Xander a quick peck on the cheek, Buffy walked out, leaving him to wonder yet again why he put up with her crap.</p>

<p>Buffy wandered back to her apartment, happy at least that she could do that much without having to constantly watch her back. Retrieving the cash from in the freezer, she let out a happy little sigh accompanied by an impish grin. Now she could really party.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>Over the next few days, Xander managed to finagle his way into meeting Giles and how he managed that Faith was still not sure. Fortunately Giles took the news rather well that Xander was privy to the slayer secret.&nbsp; He didn't exactly cheer about the fact but he didn't pull out his hair either and she took that as a good sign. Xander, meanwhile, looked as if he'd stumbled into Shangri-La. He tried to help wherever he could, either with research, patrol or training which Faith appreciated although he still had a long ways to go if he wanted to train effectively with her. However, with Xander around, she felt less of the biting loneliness chipping away at her mind. Even though Giles was great and all, he was still an adult in her eyes and she couldn't hang with him like she could with Xander. If she had a choice, Faith would've gladly spent all her time with Buffy but the blonde had yet to call her, yet to make contact. And she was starting to resent that fact. She was getting sick of waiting in anticipation only to meet disappointment each day when Giles told her that nobody had called while she was out. Both Xander and her watcher noticed her listlessness and all-around despondency but neither could get her to open up about the reason why.</p>

<p>However, when Buffy finally _did_ call her, all was forgiven. Resentment flew out the window and Faith almost bubbled over with happiness. In the back of her mind, she was berating herself savagely for giving in so easily but that feeling was pushed aside fast enough. On the spur of the moment, she asked Buffy to come over to her apartment, figuring that since the other woman was such an important part of her life already, it was only fair that Giles get to meet her. Buffy readily agreed, saying that she'd be there within the hour. As Faith correctly predicted though, the blonde arrived late, this time, claiming that she had some unexpected business to take care of.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not mad at me, are you Faith?&quot; Buffy asked, showcasing her hang dog look to Faith's amused laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm not mad,&quot; she said taking Buffy in a loose hug. &quot;I was just kinda disappointed y'know, that you hadn't called in so long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm here now,&quot; Buffy said placing a soft kiss on the other girl's lips. &quot;What do you want to do with me?&quot;</p>

<p>Smiling, Faith kissed her back, allowing her hands to be led from Buffy's waist all the way up to her breasts. She heard as well as felt the blonde's moan as she squeezed, rubbing the pads of her thumbs across the already erect nipples.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; The astonished sentiment caused them to break apart abruptly although Buffy refused to let go of Faith's waist completely. Giles had one foot inside the apartment and one foot out, frozen to the spot, blushing to the roots of his hair. &quot;Am I interrupting something...I can come back,&quot; he said, already taking a step back.</p>

<p>&quot;No Giles, wait,&quot; Faith called, walking over to her watcher and physically pulling him back into the room. &quot;I want you to meet someone. This is Buffy. Buffy, Giles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you do?&quot; Giles greeted with an extended hand which Buffy took with an amused grin. The Englishman squinted, peering more closely at the blonde for a long few seconds before asking, &quot;Have we met before?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy bristled at the close scrutiny. &quot;I don't think so,&quot; she said, not hiding the annoyance from her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I could swear--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right Giles,&quot; Faith interrupted quickly. &quot;While you're thinking about that, we're gonna go out for awhile. See you later.&quot; Grabbing Buffy's hand, she led her out of the apartment, leaving Giles with a puzzled expression still on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;What was with him?&quot; Buffy asked irritably, following the brunette down the stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;He's usually not that weird,&quot; Faith said in apologetic tones. Hoping to change the subject, she asked, &quot;So what have you been doing the last couple of days?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you know, this and that,&quot; she replied carelessly.</p>

<p>Heaving a silent sigh, Faith wondered why she even bothered to ask. It wasn't like Buffy ever told her anyway. &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask away.&quot;</p>

<p>Against her better judgement, she asked what'd been nagging her for days. &quot;Are we like, together? I mean, not just 'I'll see ya around cause you're my friend' but...a couple?&quot; Stepping out onto the stoop, she waited expectantly for Buffy's answer.</p>

<p>&quot;That kinda depends,&quot; she answered with a grin.</p>

<p>&quot;On what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On what you want us to be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want us to be together,&quot; Faith said in all earnestness. &quot;I want us to be together for more than a few hours every couple of days. I want us to be so close that you'll actually tell me what you've been doing instead of brushing me off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So in other words, you want us to be a couple.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy didn't answer for a long while, causing Faith to slowly regret ever bringing the topic of conversation up.</p>

<p>&quot;The two are mutually exclusive,&quot; Buffy finally said causing Faith to frown in confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;What is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Being close and being together. One doesn't necessarily cease to exist without the other. And to be honest, I've never been too fond of either.&quot; She watched the dejection wash over Faith's face, never having met someone that wore their feelings so openly for all the world to see. And surprising even herself, she felt a slight twinge of regret at the reaction her blunt words had elicited. &quot;Hey, look kid. I'm sorry but that's the way it is. I didn't mean to lead you on...&quot; She trailed off, uncomfortable with the apology and with the reason why she was apologizing. Technically, she'd never actually said she wanted anything even approaching the seriousness a relationship would bring so she shouldn't be held at fault.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's all right.&quot; Faith turned away, sure in her heart that it wasn't all right. It was as far from all right as black was from white.</p>

<p>&quot;But we can still have fun together, right?&quot; Buffy asked, trying to salvage whatever was left of the situation.</p>

<p>But before Faith could answer, the door behind them burst open revealing a normally reserved Giles in a frantic state.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, Buffy Summers!&quot; He pronounced, staring intently at the blonde. &quot;You're Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know my last name?&quot; Buffy asked, eyes flashing liquid fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Uhm...I think this discussion would be better served in a less public place,&quot; he said, indicating that they should all go back upstairs.</p>

<p>Buffy hesitated only a minute before acquiescing and once they were all packed into the apartment again, Giles began explaining. &quot;I know I had seen you somewhere before but I just couldn't place where and then I remembered...You're on the list of potential slayers. Buffy Summers, gone missing nearly a year ago---a runaway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Potential slayer?&quot; Faith asked, hoping that repeating it would help sink the fact in.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, potential slayer,&quot; Giles said, grinning excitedly. &quot;And you could very well be the slayer we've been looking for and so far haven't had much luck in finding yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I might be a slayer?&quot; Buffy asked, speaking for the first time as Giles nodded emphatically. &quot;Interesting. But I gotta tell you--If you thing that'll make me want to automatically take on the forces of evil like our little Faith here, you'd better think again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you are the slayer, you have a sacred duty--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Says who? The only duty I have is to myself. And I don't see how saving other people's asses does me any good. So, if that's all you've got for me, I'll see ya around. Faith, you coming?&quot; Still stunned, Faith didn't answer, prompting Buffy to shrug and leave.</p>

<p>&quot;Faith,&quot; Giles urgently gestured for her to follow the blonde. &quot;We have to know.&quot;</p>

<p>Nodding wordlessly, Faith ran outside leaving Giles to ponder the possibilities.</p>

<p align="center">****</p>

<p>Buffy woke up the next morning next to some guy she had no recollection of hooking up with. She threw him out quick enough, not being one for next day talks. The last thing she remembered was going into some club, trying to drink everybody under the table. It was no small wonder that she'd actually made it home after that. Now that she thought about it, she remembered that Faith had tagged along right up until then too. Wonder what had happened to the other girl? The thought brought her down even more so then she felt already, knowing that she'd probably acted like a total ass. She tended to do that when she was drunk. But the other girl had kept bugging her, unwilling to let the slayer thing go. So she went into a club. At least then, she wouldn't have to listen to it anymore. </p>

<p>Opening the fridge, she glanced in, hoping that there'd be something edible. Unfortunately, it was a pitiful sight that greeted her eyes. Some slices of bread that she'd brought a couple of weeks ago, a jar of peanut butter, and a carton of orange juice were the only items in the fridge. And she didn't really want to drink the juice cause the expiration date had long since past. All that meant one thing: either she got dressed to go out and get something to eat or she went back to sleep. A knock at the door saved her from making the weighty decision. Opening the door, Buffy was more than a bit surprised to see Faith standing there but her expression remained bland, giving nothing away. They stood there, each trying to size up the other until Buffy suddenly asked, &quot;Is that sausage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That smell, is it sausage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uhm...yeah.&quot; Faith held up a large bag in one hand. &quot;You hungry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I let you in, you're not going to talk my head off about the slayer thing, are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not if you don't want me to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then come in.&quot; Taking the bag off of Faith's hand, she led the way to the couch, placing the food on the TV tray. Not bothering with pleasantries, she dug right in. Her only concession to manners came in the form of a grunting gesture meant to ask Faith if she wanted any to which Faith shook her head no.</p>

<p>&quot;So how did you know where I lived?&quot;</p>

<p>Without preamble, Faith replied, &quot;I followed you home last night. You probably don't remember much from yesterday, do you?&quot; There was almost an accusing tone to her question.</p>

<p>&quot;What's there to remember?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith visibly bristled at the question. Yesterday was about as horrible a day as she'd had and to hear Buffy speaking so cavalierly was like rubbing salt in the wound. She'd watched Buffy get increasingly drunk as the night progressed, eventually leaving with some random guy who Faith had an almost physical need to punch the daylights out of. She watched helplessly as they wandered back to what she assumed was Buffy's apartment and stood outside the rest of the night. She hadn't felt as frustrated and...dirty as she had standing there. And sometime during the night, she'd made a promise to herself that she wasn't going to pine away for Buffy anymore. In fact, whatever they had was gone as far as she was concerned. Who was she kidding though? It wasn't like Buffy would notice either way.</p>

<p>Watching with hooded eyes as the sleazebag came out of the apartment the next morning, she'd made her way over, purposefully bumping him hard as she passed. Smirking as he nearly fell, she walked into the apartment, searching for Buffy's name under the mailboxes. Seeing a B. Summers on the third floor, she hesitated, not too sure about how to handle the situation. She couldn't just pop up there unannounced so she bought some takeout from a nearby diner, hoping that the food would put Buffy in a good mood.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Faith, you in there?&quot; Buffy snapped her fingers in front of Faith's face, pulling the brunette from her thoughts. Looking steadily at Faith, she sighed dramatically. &quot;Okay, go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm giving you a free pass to nag since you bought me breakfast and all. So go for it. Convince me to be a slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith looked up uncertainly for a moment. &quot;I shouldn't have to convince you. If you are a slayer, you'll do what's right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought we were talking about slayers, not a friggin boy scout group.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The fate of the world depends on us Buffy. Why can't you take it more seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy was just about to open her mouth, no doubt all ready with a smart ass reply when there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, it's Xander. Open up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xander?&quot; Faith asked. &quot;You know him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's at my door, isn't he?&quot; Buffy got up and opened the door, not bothering with pleasant greetings of any kind. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p>
<p>Xander made a face. &quot;Can't you just say hello once in awhile like a normal person?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like to be eccentric,&quot; Buffy said smoothly, smiling at his distasteful expression.</p>
<p>Xander was about to utter another reprimand when he caught sight of movement behind the blonde. &quot;Faith? What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here to see Buffy. You two know each other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, we've known each other for awhile. This is kind of a weird coincidence, isn't it?&quot; Xander squeezed past Buffy who still stood in front of the door and went over to stand by Faith. &quot;So how do you know her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's a potential slayer,&quot; Faith answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Y'know, I'm right here,&quot; Buffy interrupted, slamming the door shut. &quot;Stop talking about me like I'm not. And anyway I thought being a slayer was supposed to be some huge secret. How come even Xander knows about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He kinda stumbled into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, some vampires attacked me. Good thing Faith was nearby.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You still haven't told me what you're doing here,&quot; Buffy complained, walking over to sit on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wanted to see how you were doing. You act as if that's a crime.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not exactly but forgive me for doubting your sincerity, when was the last time you popped in to 'check on me'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whether or not you believe me, that's the truth. So, did I interrupt something...slayery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Faith was just trying to convince me that duty is more important than self-interest. Wasn't doing such a great job at it though.&quot;</p>
<p>At Xander's still confused expression, Faith elaborated on the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't be serious,&quot; Xander exclaimed after the explanation. &quot;Buffy, I don't know how you can just sit there and tell me that saving the world is beneath you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; I can do it very easily,&quot; Buffy said winking. &quot;And besides, Faith's doing a good enough job all by her lonesome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe you!&quot; Xander gesticulated, throwing his hands in the air. &quot;You can't take anything seriously. Hell would freeze over before you care about anybody but yourself. If I had an opportunity like this to make the world a better place...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By all means, go for it if you have a death wish. But as for me, unless I get paid for it, I'm not doing it.&quot;</p>
<p>Xander gave a short nod. &quot;Come on Faith, let's get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>Faith glanced at Buffy one last time with disappointment etched in her eyes before following Xander out the door. Buffy would never admit it but she felt stung&nbsp; by the look. She wasn't a hero or self-sacrificing or the martyr type but that's exactly what they wanted from her. That's what they demanded. But she could never be that person. It just wasn't in her nature. But she knew it went even deeper than that. Not even wanting to acknowledge it herself was the fact that she didn't want to disappoint, didn't want to be entrusted with another person's life because she knew she would fail. It was a vulnerability that she didn't want anyone to know about so instead, she acted callous and disinterested, preferring that everybody think of her as a selfish bitch rather than a useless loser.</p>
<p align="center">****</p>
<p>Xander was positively fuming. Even he hadn't thought Buffy would be this irresponsible. And he let Giles and Faith know exactly what he thought of his former girlfriend. Unfortunately, Faith didn't seem to share his outrage. For that matter, neither did Giles.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't there some way we can make her perform her duties or even take her powers away so someone else can get them?&quot; Xander asked exasperated.</p>
<p>&quot;Only if she dies,&quot; Giles answered matter-of-factly. &quot;And, of course, we still don't know for sure if she is the slayer. It could very well be that we're mistaken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, she's the slayer,&quot; Xander adamantly stated. &quot;She pulled an iron bar from my window the other day. Either she just happens to have the strength of ten men or she'd the slayer. I vote for the latter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then there's really nothing we can do except to inform the Council that the second slayer has been found.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait. Can't the Council do something? I mean, they have an official sounding name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid not. Their resources have been sorely taxed over the years and what's left is nothing more than a shell organization.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't we just leave her alone?&quot; Faith said, finally speaking. &quot;If she doesn't care enough to fulfill her birth right then maybe we shouldn't care enough to make her.&quot; Standing up abruptly, she walked into her room and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>Xander and Giles exchanged looks but neither one wanted to be the one to walk into that room.</p>
<p align="center">****</p>
<p>She had never intended to do what she ended up doing but, for the life of her, she couldn't believe that Buffy would be this cold and apathetic. The fact that she didn't actually know that much about Buffy was pushed from her mind. That's why she ended up sneaking out in the middle of the night and going over to Buffy's apartment. Not until she was there did she consider the possibility that Buffy might not even be home. Fortunately, when she knocked on the door, the blonde answered.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; She asked with a hint of weariness.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Faith answered honestly.</p>
<p>That bought a creeping smile to Buffy's face as she allowed the other girl to enter. &quot;Isn't it past your bedtime or something? Or did you come here just to crash on my couch?&quot;</p>
<p>Faith looked as if she desperately wanted to say something but had no idea how to do so. &quot;This was a bad idea,&quot; she finally muttered, moving to let herself out.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't know why she did it but her hand shot out, immediately, almost of its own accord to grab the other girl's arm. They both looked at each other, surprised and unsure of what to do next.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I could do it?&quot; Buffy almost bit her tongue off at her own question. The words had bypassed her brain and tumbled out of her mouth unheeded.</p>
<p>Faith didn't need to ask what &quot;it&quot; was. &quot;I think you're better than you give yourself credit for,&quot; she answered thoughtfully. &quot;We're slayers Buffy. There's only two of us in the world and you're one of the few people I'd trust to watch my back. Remember when you told Xander that I was doing a good enough job on my own? That's not true. I need you to help me. Will you help me?&quot;</p>
<p>Buffy turned pale at what this moment meant. This was a chance to pull herself out of the darkness she'd been building around herself for a lifetime if only she would take it. For whatever face she showed the world was false and nothing more than a mask she donned to keep everybody around her at arm's length which tended to make ones life miserable. Her life held no meaning, no value to anyone, least of all herself and she hated that fact. And here was this girl she'd met for less than two weeks, holding out the promise of something better, something more substantial. But she had to take that first step to meet her halfway and, of course, it was the hardest step of all. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, nodding her head slowly. &quot;It might be fun to save the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Faith smiled encouragingly, clasping Buffy's hand which was still on her arm. The slayers were finally together.</p>
<p align="center">****</p>
<p>When Faith returned to her apartment the next day, Giles was nearly beside himself. He'd gone to wake Faith up earlier like he did every morning and found a rumpled bed with nobody occupying it. Fortunately for the brunette, Giles cut his tirade short after he saw Buffy walking in behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;I changed my mind,&quot; she said simply.</p>
<p>Giles stuttered somewhat at the blonde's statement. &quot;That's...that's wonderful,&quot; he finally exclaimed. &quot;We'll have to start training immediately. You'll have to be apprised of the different classifications of demons occupying the city and, oh yes...&quot;</p>
<p>Buffy looked over at her fellow slayer with a &quot;help me&quot; expression on her face as Giles continued to drone on but even as Faith sympathized, she wasn't about to intervene. After all, she'd had to go through the same lecture and it was only fair that Buffy endure it too. </p>
