<p>"Damn." I looked over at the guy who'd fallen out of his chair. The
whole frigging table was laughing, especially Buffy. "What the fuck
is in that beer, X?" He shrugs at me. No help at all. "Fuck, I can't
take this shit anymore." </p>

<p>I walked over to the table o' fun, trying to put on a nice smile
cause Buffy was looking at me suspiciously. "Hi B. Having fun?" She
nods, her face immediately lighting up. "Great, that's good. But, um,
don't you remember that you need to get up early for class tomorrow?
You don't want to skip class, do you?"</p>

<p>She looked confused and I pressed the advantage. "We can always come
back tomorrow if you like ... I promise." That seemed to do it and
she got up, waving good-bye to everybody else at the table and
stumbled into my arms. She was a dead weight as I tried to lift her
up back onto her feet. I waved to Xander and just decided it was
easier to carry her back to the car than to wait for her to remember
how to use her feet. </p>

<p>When I got out to the parking lot, I found out that trying to open a
car door while holding someone in your arms is a lot harder than I
would've thought. I finally hooked the handle with a finger and, half-
crouching, half-stooping, shoved Buffy inside. Of course, it was only
after I'd done all this gymnastic maneuvering that my brain piped up,
telling me I could've just put her down and *then* opened the door.</p>

<p>Yeah, no shit. Now it tells me.</p>

<p>Buffy was out like a blown fuse. She didn't even twitch once the
whole way home and if it wasn't for her chest rising up and down,
you'd think she was dead. I pretty much figured she was a lightweight
when it came to putting away the liquor but shit, I never expected
this. And shoot me but tomorrow morning is not gonna be a pretty
sight when she finally *does* wake up.</p>

<p>Can you say hangover from hell boys and girls?</p>

<p>I glanced over at her again when I pulled up in front of my
apartment. Her mouth was slightly open, her head lolled on the back
of the seat, her hair was kinda mussed up but I still thought she was
one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life. I guess
love does that --- puts a filter over your eyes so even though you
know the person you're in love with isn't perfect, they still seem
pretty damn close anyway. </p>

<p>I wonder if she sees me like that ...</p>

<p>She must see something if she's still with me.</p>

<p>I shook my head, getting it back on track cause thinking too much
into this was kinda depressing me. I always was more a woman of
action than of words. The struggle to get Buffy into the apartment
was a lot easier than getting her into the car --- mostly cause I put
her down before trying to open up any more doors.</p>

<p>Now, normally, if I was undressing Buffy, one piece of clothing at a
time, it'd be some sort of erotic foreplay --- a lead in to some mind
blowing, flying high in the sky, sex. But when she's barely conscious
like she is now? </p>

<p>"Aw, B. You know we're missing a grand opportunity, doncha?" I
whispered, brushing my lips across her forehead before laying down
and wrapping an arm around her waist. My last thought before I
drifted off was that this wasn't so bad --- not too bad at all.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes again, the sunlight had lit up my room but not
so much that it would've woken me up. Then I felt it again. The
fingers running up and down the side of my ribs like they were
playing the piano. "I'm guessing you're awake," I mumbled, putting my
hand over the wandering digits under my shirt.</p>

<p>A mumble came from somewhere near my chest.</p>

<p>"Let me guess. That's hangover talk for yes, right?"</p>

<p>Buffy's head popped out from under the covers, her eyes starting to
focus on me. "You smell good," she said as she started sniffing me.</p>

<p>"I think we've been down this road before. B?" I took her head in
between my hands. Hangover or not, this was pretty fucking
strange. "You all right?"</p>

<p>She grinned at me all of a sudden and then jumped on top of me,
straddling my waist. "Want you" was all she said before her mouth was
on my neck --- sucking, nibbling, kissing --- growling?? </p>

<p>"Shit!" I bucked my hips, throwing her off of me and scrambling out
of bed. "Look, you know I'm all for sex, whenever, wherever ... but
you should be puking your guts out with all the booze you put away
last night, not jumping my bones." Did I just refuse sex? Shit, maybe
I'm the sick one here.</p>

<p>She sat up, looking at me like I was a four course meal and she
hadn't eaten for a week. "FUCK!" That was the only word I got out
before she jumped me again ---- literally jumped on top of me. I got
knocked back, my head hitting the hardwood floor. I laid there for a
couple of seconds, feeling dazed and out of it. Meanwhile, Buffy's
still sitting on top of me, trying to get me out of my shirt when I
hear this ripping sound.</p>

<p>"That's it!" I shouted, flipping her up and over my head. "This is my
favorite fucking shirt B!" I looked down at the tear down the center
of it. "What the fuck is wrong with you?!"</p>

<p>Her eyes got all big and round. Her bottom lip started trembling as
she sat there on the floor and I started cursing myself for being so
harsh. "I"m sorry. I didn't mean it like that, B." I crawled over to
where she was and pulled her into a hug. She sniffled a little,
grabbing onto the tatters of my shirt. When she quieted down a bit, I
tilted her chin up so I could look into her face.</p>

<p>It was the same face I'd woken up to for the last couple of months,
the same one I dreamed about constantly almost every day. So I knew
right off the bat that something was off. It was her eyes. They were
vacant, not empty exactly but not reflecting the vibrance I usually
saw there either --- where was my Buffy? She pulled her head out of
my grasp and burrowed back against my chest again.</p>

<p>"Come on," I said, gathering her up and leading her back to the bed
where she plopped down. I looked down at her as I wondered what to do
now. Even odds this is another patented Sunnydale joke. Magic maybe --
- Giles would know what to do. "Hey B. You wouldn't happen to know
Giles' number would you?"</p>

<p>As expected, she gave me a blank stare and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Okay ... stay here. I have to go somewhere but I'll be right back."
She grabbed my hand and it felt like a vice was clamping down on it.
Biting back a wince, I tried not to yell out. "Like I said, I'll be
right back. B, would I lie to you?"</p>

<p>She looked damn confused at the question but she slowly let go of my
hand and I shook it out to get the circulation back. Giving her a
last look, I smiled and quickly slipped into something that wasn't
giving me a draft up front. As soon as I got out the door, I broke
into a full out run to my car. Giles would know what to do, I kept
repeating to myself all the way to the school. He always knows what
to do.</p>

<p>Before the car even came to a full stop in the parking lot, I was
already out and running towards the entrance. "Giles!" I shouted,
throwing open the doors to the library. "Yo G, emergency happening
here. Where are you?"</p>

<p>He came rushing out of his office, a book still in hand. "What's the
problem?"</p>

<p>I tired summing up what was going on but it too friggin bizarre even
for me and if I were talking to anybody else besides Giles, they'd be
committing my ass before I'd even finished. "I mean, shit, she's
acting like ... like she's lost a hundred IQ points overnight."</p>

<p>He tapped an index finger against his chin, going into thoughtful
Watcher mode. "And you say she had a lot to drink last night."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but this ain't no ordinary hangover. I *know* what a hangover
feels like and that was not it." He gave me a look but didn't comment
on it or anything.</p>

<p>"Yes, but that's all we've got to work on right now so it's as good a
place to start investigating as any."</p>

<p>"Hey you're the brains," I said, shrugging. "I just hit things. Look,
I'm gonna go back to the apartment. The pub doesn't open till tonight
anyway so ... "</p>

<p>"I'll meet you there and in the meantime, if Snyder asks as to your
whereabouts, I'll come up with a suitable excuse for your absence."</p>

<p>"You're the best," I said, winking at him before charging out the
door again. So, all in all, the whole round-trip took about thirty
minutes. You'd think Buffy couldn't have gotten into too much trouble
but then you'd be seriously deluding yourself and on crack to boot.
The first step I took into the apartment and I was already stepping
on peanut butter. "What the ... " </p>

<p>I looked up and it just got worse from there on out. The walls were
covered in peanut butter graffiti. Now, I'm all for defacing
property ... just not mine. This really pissed me off. And there,
crouching on the floor on the other side of the room is Buffy with
the jumbo sized jar of creamy peanut butter, one hand covered in the
stuff as she's finger painting on the wall.</p>

<p>"Don't expect me to clean any of this up, B." She turns to look at me
with an oh so innocent expression on her face. "Soon as you get
better, I'll show you where I store the mop and bucket."</p>

<p>She runs over to me with arms wide open and the thought of ducking
out of the way entered my mind for about a split second before it
flies out just as quickly. The air gets knocked out of me as she
wraps both arms around my shoulders and starts squeezing. "Love you,
Faith," she mutters, nuzzling against my neck which kinda makes not
being able to breath not so bad --- kinda.</p>

<p>"Love you too, B," I said, croaking the words out and trying to suck
in some air before untangling the arms around my body. "But, uh, not
so tight next time, 'k?"</p>

<p>She smiles again --- bright and cheery as she goes back to the arts
and craft. What was I gonna do? Stop her? She looked too happy. Come
to think of it, I've never seen her like this. Normally, she always
held some part of herself back. It was all about the control. Control
of her instincts, her body, her mind, her surroundings. But now ...
now, it was like she'd cut all the strings and let herself go wild.</p>

<p>I plopped myself down on the couch, feeling something digging into my
ass and when I reached a hand down for it, came back with a
snowglobe. </p>

<p>A snowglobe? When the fuck did I buy a snowglobe?</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>I had to spend a whole weekend cleaning peanut butter gunk off the
wall. That's all the reason I'll ever need to never indulge in beer
again ... that and the fact that Faith keeps teasing me about being
Cave Slayer Buffy. She keeps forgetting that if I hadn't been such a
thoughtful girlfriend and not gotten her a Jack and Coke in the first
place instead of beer, she'd have been dabbling in the art of wall
painting right along with me.</p>

<p>And speaking of Faith ... I looked down at the notebook in front of
me, brought for the express purpose of holding my notes but which
instead held the word 'Faith' scrawled, printed, scripted, decorated
all over the page. I took a look around and was glad nobody was
looking this way because I could feel the blush coloring my cheeks.</p>

<p>This behavior was fine for junior high --- maybe even high school if
you're stretching it but I'm a college freshman. What was I doing
writing my girlfriend's name all over the page? If anybody saw
this ...</p>

<p>A blurry red blob hovered at the edge of my peripheral vision.
Turning my head sharply to glare at my best friend, I slammed the
cover of the book shut but not before catching Willow's smirk as she
turned back to her own notes. It wasn't like I hadn't caught her
doing some really mushy things with Oz lately so I didn't see what
she was laughing at.</p>

<p>Once class let out, I pointedly ignored the knowing look in her eyes,
instead wondering out loud what we should get for lunch. She was just
in the middle of debating the merits of either getting deli food or
the more exotic choice of Japanese when a large silver metal and
chrome streak screeched to a stop in front of us. Instinctively
pulling Willow out of the way so she wouldn't end up a piece of
roadkill, I stared at the car's driver who just happened to be openly
grinning at the both of us, oblivious of the fact that she was
receiving nothing but glares in return.</p>

<p>"Faith!" I practically yelled. "What do you think you're doing? You
nearly -- "</p>

<p>"Get in," she says as if I hadn't even opened my mouth. When I still
stood there, my arms crossed over my chest, she leans over and opens
the door. "Get in."</p>

<p>Willow's standing there almost as shocked as I was as I finally climb
into the passenger seat. The door wasn't even closed before the car
shot out of the quad, scattering people aside and I was almost
surprised we didn't run anybody over ... although I can't say for
sure that nobody got injured, trying to jump out of the way.</p>

<p>I couldn't believe that through it all, Faith's still got that grin
on her face --- the same one that crops up whenever we're eradicating
some vamp nest --- raw joy with a dash of lust. She glances over at
me, quirking an eyebrow as somebody else jumps out of the way, barely
making it without bumping the fender.</p>

<p>My mouth was hanging open and I immediately shut it as soon as I
realized that I was doing it. "What's going on?" I asked, hating the
whining note in my voice before my shoulder got jammed into the door
when she swerved into a hard right turn.</p>

<p>"Found a vamp nest this morning. I just thought you might like to
have some fun," she said, one hand resting easily on the steering
wheel as the other hand brushed off a stray lock of hair from her
face. She said it so casually that you wouldn't think anything was
wrong but the fact was she'd almost run down half the student body
and she didn't even seem to care.</p>

<p>"Faith, is something wrong?" I asked, trying to make sense of her
behavior.</p>

<p>"Wrong?" She asked, reaching up to adjust the rearview mirror and, in
the process, nearly mowing down some blonde girl who was crossing the
street. "What are you talking about? Nothing's wrong. Why would
anything be wrong?" Pressing down on the gas some more, we shot
through an intersection, the sound of blaring car horns following in
our wake as we roared down the street. "Damn B. I come all the way
over here cause I thought you might like to have a little fun and I'm
getting the third degree. You think you could lighten up a little
bit?"</p>

<p>"You're acting like a maniac!" I finally shouted, getting frustrated
beyond belief that she didn't see anything wrong with the way she was
acting. "Would you slow down before you hit someone?"</p>

<p>She immediately swerved to the side of the road, braking so suddenly
that I was thrown against the dash, banging my forehead in the
process. "You happy now?" She asked as I scraped myself off the
leather and glared at her, resisting the overwhelming urge to just
reach over, grab her and shake her as hard as I could. "Hell, if you
don't want to come ... " she gestured with one hand, basically
telling me to fuck off but not in so many words.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that though, I reached over and took the key out of
the ignition before she could stop me. Her hand immediately clamped
down on my wrist as she squeezed, just enough to be painful even for
a Slayer. "Don't play with my key," she says, the words barely
recognizable through her gritted teeth.</p>

<p>Yanking my arm away, I stared her down, tightening my grip on the key
so hard that the metal began to bite into my flesh. We sat there,
staring at each other for the longest few minutes of my life. And the
worse part was that I didn't even know what had happened to cause
this sudden and dramatic shift in personality. "Faith," I began
slowly, reaching out with a free hand to place it on hers which were
now gripping the steering wheel so hard, her knuckles were white.</p>

<p>"I need to go," she said, her eyes turned forward. "If you're not
with me then put the fucking key back in the fucking ignition and
step out."</p>

<p>I sat staring mute for a few more seconds, torn between wanting to
strangle her and wanting to keep talking. But what I ended up doing
instead was tossing the key back at her and getting out of the car. I
stood there as she started the engine again and left, leaving the
faint scent of burning rubber and swirling dust blowing across my
face. I don't know how long I just stood there looking in the
direction where she'd gone because when my mind finally clicked back
on, I found myself back in my apartment, sitting on the floor with my
back resting against the side of the bed.</p>

<p>The room was dark --- guess I hadn't bothered to turn on the lights.
It wasn't really clear how I'd gotten back here or when for that
matter but here I was ... waiting for Faith to come back, hopefully
in a saner frame of mind than when she'd left. Something must have
happened. I mean, nobody flips out like that without something having
happened, right?</p>

<p>But that left the question of what. *What* exactly had happened?</p>

<p>The sound of the key jiggling in the lock made my head snap up and
the question flew from my mind as the door opened and Faith strolled
in, flipping the light switch on the wall as she walked past. Our
eyes met for a brief instant before she turned away to walk into the
small kitchenette.</p>

<p>Not one word. Not one acknowledgment that I was even there. And as I
listened to the cheery whistling floating towards my ears as she
browsed through the contents of the fridge, something just snapped ---
 *I* snapped.</p>

<p>"You are *not* going to treat me like I'm not even here!" I shouted,
stomping up behind her.</p>

<p>She kept her back to me, still looking through the fridge like I
hadn't even spoken and for a second --- just for one second, I almost
pushed her. The desire was there, so strong that my hands started
trembling with the effort to stop myself. I took a moment to swallow
the yell threatening to tear from out of my throat and instead backed
up a step, standing silently until she closed the fridge and finally
turned around.</p>

<p>"We need to get more water," she says, a bland look on her face,
leaning back and appraising me with a cool gaze. </p>

<p>I'm sure my mouth dropped open again but by that point it didn't
really matter anymore. My girlfriend was acting like a complete
stranger and I'd had about all I could stand. Moving forward and
gripping her by the elbows, I shook her hard. "What's the matter with
you? Why are you acting like this, Faith? Did something happen?"</p>

<p>She looked at me, the same bland expression on her face as she slowly
pulled away. "I think I should be the one asking that question, B,"
she said, fixing me with a stare. "I come looking for you this
afternoon cause I thought you'd *want* to slay some vamps. Instead,
you keep asking me 'what's the matter?', 'what's the matter?' ----
Well, fuck it. I wanted to slay. I went to slay. I slayed. What'd
*you* do today?" She smirked, turning around and walking into the
living room to flop down on the couch. "I think maybe you should take
a look at yourself before you come down on me like some holier than
thou Mother Theresa," she blithely continued, raising her voice so I
could still hear her from across the room. "We're Slayers, B. That's
what we do --- that's what we are. So what are you trying to prove
with this college shit? At the end of the day, you and me both know
where we're going to end up."</p>

<p>"And where's that?" I mumbled. </p>

<p>She seemed to hear me just fine though because she answered, "Dead,
B. Six feet under cause some demon got lucky or we just got
sloppy ... but that's fate, I guess. I'm not fighting it anymore. I'm
embracing the Slayer within." I heard the smirk in her voice even
though I wasn't looking directly at her. "And out of everybody, I
thought you'd understand ... but you don't," she finished dully. "Why
don't you understand?"</p>

<p>Finally looking back up at her, I saw a lost look on her face before
it was gone, hidden away behind a patina of disinterest. "That's not
you," I said softly, hoping to convince her as well as myself.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" She asked, a note of irritation
creeping in. "Of course this is me. This has always been me. I just
had to do a little digging to find it."</p>

<p>I made my way slowly over to the couch as if any sudden movement
would startle her into running. Sitting down gingerly on a black
cushion, I reached for one of her hands, wrapping my fingers around
warm flesh. "Faith, look at me," I pleaded, waiting until our eyes
met before continuing. I had no idea what was going on and, up until
that point, I had no doubt that this was still Faith --- this was
still the love of my life. At least, that's what I was thinking until
I actually sat there and looked into her eyes --- I mean, really
*looked*, coming to a realization that felt like a punch to my
stomach. I didn't recognize anything. Those cold brown depths were as
dead as they were alive, burning with some emotion I couldn't even
place.</p>

<p>This wasn't my Faith.</p>

<p>This wasn't the person I loved.</p>

<p>And as I absorbed that sobering fact, a disgusted look crept onto her
face. Mumbling something about having better things to do than
sitting around, she turned away. I didn't try to stop her when she
got up and left, closing the door a little too loudly behind her
because I didn't know what I would say to this person who looked
exactly like my girlfriend but who I was also absolutely sure wasn't
my girlfriend.</p>

<p>But if she wasn't --</p>

<p>A frantic knocking at the door shook me out of my thoughts, making me
jump a little. Whoever it was on the other side must have really
wanted to come in because the knocking continued almost compulsively
before I finally got up and opened it. My eyes widened slightly,
taking in a rumpled and distressed looking Faith, staring back at me
with tears clouding her eyes.</p>

<p>"Fa -- "</p>

<p>The first syllable wasn't even out of my mouth before wiry arms
pulled me into a long, desperate hug that ended with a softly
spoken "Buffy."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Who says killing is hard? I'm staring at the blood running off my
hands and I feel ... </p>

<p>I feel?</p>

<p>I feel nothing.</p>

<p>He gulped like a fish before he slid to the ground --- like he was
going to be okay if he only had enough air. But he's dead now.
Another pityass human getting in my way.</p>

<p>Did I say 'human'?</p>

<p>Human?</p>

<p>Then what am I?</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>It's kinda weird. Cause, one minute, there are two of me and then,
before I even knew it actually, there's only one --- kneeling in the
middle of the street. And then, as if that weren't enough to mess you
up, there are all these thoughts and memories that you didn't even
know you had but you didn't know you didn't have either.</p>

<p>Y'know?</p>

<p>But I guess you wouldn't know cause it's not like it's every day that
some scabby demon blasts you with his magic glow stick, splitting you
into two people. 'Two halves of the same whole' as Giles would say or
some other shit like that.</p>

<p>And I think I'm just babbling now cause I don't wanna think about
what had happened a couple of hours ago. I hear Buffy's voice next to
my ear whispering that everything's all right now and I want to laugh
out loud cause she doesn't know shit. She doesn't know ... what I
did. She tells me to open my eyes and that's when I realize I've
got 'em shut tight.</p>

<p>So I do as she tells me like a well trained puppy cause she knows
what's best for me. She always does. Right? </p>

<p>And the first thing I see is her hazel green eyes staring back at me,
making me suddenly realize how fucking bad I've screwed up. Hell,
it's no secret to anyone how she's stuck by me even when I didn't
deserve her ... but this ... this'll probably *break* us.</p>

<p>*If* I tell her.</p>

<p>"Faith, are you all right? Honey, talk to me."</p>

<p>I'm that close to spilling it --- that close. "I'm fine. Never
better." Not close enough, I guess. And I even throw in a weak ass
smile to try and convince her I'm telling the truth. She finally
seems to buy it after staring at me for a few minutes like I was
gonna say more but I've got nothing else to say. Helping me get back
on my feet, she's all mother henning me, even brushing some dirt from
my clothes. </p>

<p>The gang's all there, looking like I was gonna jump them at any
second. I guess I can't blame them, seeing as how I ripped into all
of 'em earlier.</p>

<p>"If you're all right, does that mean I can do this now?" Cordy
reached over and smacked me on the back of the head.</p>

<p>Buffy immediately came to my defense like I knew she
would. "Cordelia!"</p>

<p>"Forget it, B," I interrupt before she can say anymore. "I kinda
deserve that."</p>

<p>"What? Why?" She asks, glancing between the two of us. None of us say
anything. Xander's got an equally pissed off expression on his face
and you can tell he's really trying not to blow up. Willow's standing
close to Oz. She can't even look at me.</p>

<p>Damn --- I can't fucking believe I said some of that stuff back there
but I did cause I remember the words coming out of my mouth and the
thing is --- it sounded pretty right at the time. Shit, a part of me
still thinks everything I said is pretty much true and that scares me
more than anything.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why." It's Cordelia again. Of course, it *would* be
her. </p>

<p>Fucking bitch. </p>

<p>No I didn't mean that.</p>

<p>Did I?</p>

<p>What the fuck is up with my head? They put me back together again ---
squished my two halves into one --- so why does it still feel like
I've got someone else in my head? Or is that, someone else has got me
in their head? Damn, it's too friggin confusing. And it's not helping
that Cordy's running at the mouth --- something about me ruining her
life which is kinda blowing it out of proportion if you ask me. All I
did was tell her how friggin useless she was, the whole Scooby gang
included, as a matter of fact so I wasn't singling her out personally.</p>

<p>"It's true, isn't it?" I didn't so much speak it as mutter it but as
soon as those words came out of my mouth, everyone's looking at me.
At least Cordy's finally shut her trap.</p>

<p>"Faith, are you sure you're all right?" Buffy asks, breaking the
silence. Then, she looks over at Giles as if to beg him to tell her
something useful --- like she always does. She calls herself a Slayer
but you wouldn't know it by the way she depends on everybody. God, it
makes me ... it makes me sick? </p>

<p>"... there aren't any side effects I'm aware of ..." Giles squinches
his eyes as he looks me over as if he could find what was wrong with
me if he looked closely enough, mumbling "Maybe it's just the
disorientation of being split into two distinct entities. I'm sure
it's quite ... jarring."</p>

<p>Yeah, I'd say. On the one side, there's wussified me and on the
other, it's badass Slayer me. It's like some bad acid trip.</p>

<p>"But she'll be fine, right?" Buffy sounds like she's grasping at
straws, kinda cute in a desperate sort of way. </p>

<p>Kinda pathetic. </p>

<p>It makes me want to shove her up against a wall for being so weak.</p>

<p>God! What the fuck is wrong with me?</p>

<p>They talk some more. I don't know what about but I'm not really
caring all that much by that point. Buffy ends up taking me home,
driving *my* car which I don't normally let her do cause she grinds
the gears and drives through red lights like she was colorblind
but ...</p>

<p>I've got other shit to worry about. Like how I'm gonna get myself
feeling *me* again. The normal me, the me that can shut out these
thoughts --- the same thoughts that I've always been able to keep in
the background cause I know they're just one big neon sign inviting
trouble if I think about them too much. But now it's like, they've
gotten a taste for freedom and they want out. And that just makes me
want to find the nearest concrete wall and bash my brain in. At least
then, it'll be quiet up there.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>The question jerks me back to reality and I lurch forward a little as
she steps too hard on the brake. "Um, no. That's all right. I just
want to lie down for a little while." No, that's not entirely true.
What I really want to do is hurt something. Anything. That always
dulls the pain --- for me anyway. But didn't I already hurt something
tonight? I hurt him so bad, he died.</p>

<p>"Okay. But if you change your mind ... just let me know."</p>

<p>"Yeah," I say, staring out the side window and watching the houses
fly pass. My mind keeps going in split directions at the same time.
The guy was an idiot, plain and fucking simple. What the fuck did he
think would happen coming out of nowhere like that? And the way he
looked at me ... even when he was sliding down the wall ... I was
only trying to do my job. I'm the Slayer. He's a nobody.</p>

<p>And ...</p>

<p>And I killed him with my own hands. I've never done that before. Not
to a person. No shit. So what exactly should I be feeling right now?
If it were Buffy, she'd probably be in the police station copping to
everything 'bout now but I'm not Buffy. I don't want to be Buffy if
it means I'll be spending the rest of my life behind bars with a
cellmate named Bertha.</p>

<p>Screw that.</p>

<p>The total silence finally makes me realize that we've stopped which
freaks me out cause I have to wonder how long we've been sitting
there like that. I was just moving for the door lock when her hand
clamps down on my arm, not so hard that it hurts but enough for me to
look over at her. I thought she was going to talk some more, probably
ask more questions that I'll just have to lie about but instead, she
pulls me close, wrapping her arms around my neck, giving me a hug.
After a second, I return it, finally feeling like myself for the
first time that whole entire night. </p>

<p>It feels so good to hug her and to have myself hugged that I
practically pull her across the seat and into my lap. I didn't want
to let go and she didn't make me, just letting me bury myself against
her.</p>

<p>Everything will be fine now. I'm me. I am. </p>

<p>And nobody's gonna find the body.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Faith?" I rubbed my eyes which were still gummy from sleep. "What
are you doing?"</p>

<p>She's crouched over on the floor at the foot of the bed,
concentrating on doing something but from my angle, I can't see what
it is. The sound of a zipper closing makes me sit up slowly and I
feel the covers slip across my skin, pooling around my
waist. "Faith?" I call out again, confused now as I see the corner of
a bag peeking up from the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"I gotta leave for a little while," she finally says, her eyes still
focused on whatever it was she was doing.</p>

<p>"What?" I couldn't have heard right, could I? She didn't just say she
was leaving. She's not packing. I've got to be dreaming.</p>

<p>She stands up, bag in hand, eyes shifting restlessly all over the
room, landing everywhere but on me. "I'm sorry about the last minute
thing but I have to get out of town."</p>

<p>"You're sorry?" I mutter half to myself. "You're sorry?! Faith, this
doesn't make any sense at all. I know you've been a little out of it
since that run-in with the Toth demon but I thought that was behind
us now. But here you are telling me that you're leaving and I'm
supposed to what? Just accept it? Hug you and wave sayonara?"</p>

<p>She finally looks at me, her expression going from harried to angry
in a matter of seconds as she slings the bag over one
shoulder. "Look, I'm not asking for your permission here. I'm telling
you --- I'm leaving," she carefully enunciates as if to say that was
the end of the story.</p>

<p>I think I surprised her when I threw back the covers and walked over
to stand in front of her but she quickly covered it up, hiding behind
a bland expression. "And I'm telling you, I want to know why," I
said, staring her in the eyes and very aware that I was completely
naked. "Faith," I said, my voice softening as I took in her
features. "You've been so distant lately --- not just to me but to
everybody and I just want you to let me back in. I want to share
whatever it is that's happening with you. Let me help you, Faith.
Don't keep shutting me out ... What are you thinking?" I let the
fingers of one hand play along the edge of her jaw, hoping that
whatever it was she was trying to work out in that head of hers,
she'd include me in on the plans.</p>

<p>Biting the bottom of her lip, she opened her mouth as if to say
something but instead, clamped it shut again to bend down and pick up
something off the floor which turned out to be the remote. She turned
on the television, gesturing for me to sit down as she slid to the
floor, head reclining on the edge of the bed. Even though I was
getting frustrated at her confusing behavior, I did as she wanted, my
eyes turning to the TV which was tuned into a newscast. A reporter
was standing at the docks talking about a body some fishermen had
hauled up last night and as I watched, my eyes kept shifting back to
Faith, wondering what this had to do with anything.</p>

<p>She finally shut the TV off, her eyes closing briefly before saying
in a dead monotone, "That guy they dredged up ... "</p>

<p>"Yes?" I prodded after she lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"... I killed him, B. The night that I got split in two, I was out
patrolling --- the Slayer half of me anyway, and he came out of
nowhere. I couldn't stop the stake in time ... and he died." Her eyes
had squeezed shut by this time as her arms wrapped around upraised
knees, looking for all the world like a scared little kid. I wanted
more than anything to wrap her in my arms and protect her forever ---
tell her everything was going to be all right but instead, I just sat
there, the shock of what she'd told me still seeping through my brain.</p>

<p>She abruptly scrambled up, bag still in hand as she stared down at
me. "So that's why I need to leave town. The cops might be stupid
around here but I don't want to stick around in case they manage to
grow a brain cell or two."</p>

<p>"Faith, you can't just go," I say, finally snapping into action as I
stand up too.</p>

<p>"Why not?" She asks with that same defiant look in her eyes I've seen
countless times before. "I'm not turning myself in, B. You can forget
about it if that's what you're thinking. It was an accident and he
probably deserved it anyway. I mean, what kind of guy skulks around
an alley in the middle of the night anyway? A bad guy, that's what."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No, that's not what I wanted you to do. I don't
want you to turn yourself in." A look of surprise flashes across her
face. I don't know why she's surprised though. Did she really think I
wanted her in jail? "But you've still got to talk to somebody about
it. These past couple of days ... it's got to be eating you up
inside."</p>

<p>"But I am talking. I'm talking to you." She flashes me a smile that
disappears just as quickly. Regripping her bag, she looks up at me
with a lost expression on her face.</p>

<p>Her mood swings have been so off the wall lately, I can't believe I
didn't call her on it sooner. But I guess, on some level, I wanted to
write it off and hope that it'd go away if we both ignored it long
enough. At least, now I know what's been behind it. </p>

<p>Swallowing back the sizable knot in my throat, I reached for her
hand, gently coaxing the bag from her white knuckled grip. "I know
but we can at least tell Giles. It'll be fine --- you'll see. And
I'll be right there with you. He'll know what to do. He always does. "</p>

<p>She looked uncertain at first but finally nodded her head, her
shoulders slumping in either defeat of acceptance, I'm not sure
which. Taking the bag from out of her hand, I placed it by the side
of the bed and seizing on the lull in the emotional rollercoaster we
were on at the moment, I decided it was the perfect time to get
dressed.</p>

<p>By the time I got out of the bathroom, Faith had moved from her spot
at the foot of the bed to lay sprawled across it, her eyes staring
blankly up at the ceiling. And it's then that it suddenly hits me.
She's *killed* a man. To live with that --- to live with the
knowledge that you've taken someone else's life, someone else's
future ...</p>

<p>And it could have so easily been me in her shoes. The Toth demon
wasn't all that hung up on which Slayer he took out as long as he got
one of us.</p>

<p>"So, you ready to go?" She asks, listlessly sitting up and looking at
me, breaking me abruptly from my thoughts.</p>

<p>Taking her hand in mine, I pulled her up into a standing
position. "Let's go," I said with what I hoped was a reassuring smile.</p>

<p>She returned it with one of her own. "What would I do without you, B?"</p>

<p>"I guess you'll never know because I'm never leaving you, Faith." </p>

<p>Her smile grew wider as she leaned in, softly kissing me on the lips,
making everything seem perfectly fine for that all too brief moment.
But as soon as we parted, there was an awkwardness laying between us
that seemed to have come out of nowhere. She was the first to make a
move, walking to the door as I followed. </p>

<p>No words were spoken and the drive to the high school was just an
extension of the silence. It seemed to take hours before we finally
cruised to a stop in the parking lot but in reality, the drive
probably only took a few minutes. </p>

<p>We were halfway to the library when a snarky, unforgettable but how I
wish I *could* forget voice that sometimes makes an appearance in my
nightmares, boomed out from behind us, "Hold it!"</p>

<p>Both of us did just that. Faith swore under her breath but put on her
fakest, brightest smile as she pivoted on one foot, facing down our
pursuer.
"Good morning, sir." I don't think I've ever heard her use 'sir' in a
sentence before and Snyder certainly hasn't either because he looks
like he's just swallowed his tongue. "I was so worried I wouldn't run
into you today but ... here you are. I just wanted to let you know
that I've been out sick these last couple of days --- nasty flu bug
going around, y'know? But don't worry, I'm fine now."</p>

<p>Snyder eyes her suspiciously but then turns his undivided attention
to me. "You!" He says like he was accusing me of something. I always
knew he had a special place in his heart for me --- granted it's way
in the back in a deep, dank corner full of spider webs. </p>

<p>"Hi." I even manage a lackluster imitation of a wave.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "I needed to use the
bathroom" and immediately grimaced at how stupid that sounded.</p>

<p>"Actually, since this *is* her alma mater, she wanted to come back
and visit with a few teachers --- do the nostalgia thing," Faith said
without missing a beat. "So if you'll excuse us, I have to be at the
library researching a paper for class."</p>

<p>Faith takes my hand and drags me away, leaving a sputtering Snyder in
our wake. "Out sick?," I questioned, surreptitiously looking back
over my shoulder to catch my former Principal turning an interesting
shade of purple.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it later," she promised with a sheepish look in
place as she led the way to the library.</p>

<p>"Giles!" I immediately shouted as soon as we stepped through the
swinging doors. How many times had I shouted his name in the past,
the volume usually modulating in accordance with the badness of the
situation? It was almost a reflex by now. But I stopped short just
inside the room as I took in the unfamiliar form looking back at the
two of us.</p>

<p>He was like a younger version of Giles, complete with glasses and
musty book in hand. As soon as I saw him, my brain just
screamed 'Watcher'. Did the Council make a mode and just stamp them
out like cheap roadside trinkets or had they stepped into the
twentieth century and experimented with cloning? I could feel Faith
already backing up and I caught her hand before she could make her
way completely out of the room. One look at her eyes was enough to
see she wasn't happy with this unexpected development.</p>

<p>But before I could say anything to try and calm her down, the new guy
steps towards us, introducing himself just as Giles comes out of his
office, looking slightly pissed off.</p>

<p>"Uh, Wesley?" I said, cutting short his long winded speech which he'd
launched into as if he'd been practicing for it all day. "We came to
talk to Giles ... alone."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>This guy just can't buy a fucking clue. Buffy had told him flat out
he wasn't wanted here but ... he's still here! And he's annoying the
crap out of me, talking about how he has a responsibility to be here
cause he's my new Watcher now. Yeah ... what the fuck ever.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask for this," I muttered, low enough that he wasn't
supposed to hear but the guy's got some big ears so he catches me
anyway.</p>

<p>"Pardon?" He asked with one eyebrow raised, trying to stare me down.
Imagine it --- this fucking suit's trying to stare *me* down. I've
faced guano scarier than him.</p>

<p>"I said, I didn't ask for a new Watcher!" I shouted, smiling when I
saw him jump back a little. "So just go pack up your bags and get the
fuck gone."</p>

<p>"Faith!" I got a stereo shout of my name as both Buffy and Giles jump
in to save his ass.</p>

<p>"Look this isn't a good time," Buffy finally says as she places
herself between Wes and me. Maybe she thinks I might attack. "And
anyway, we didn't have much luck with the last Watcher that showed up
here what with her trying to kill us and all -- "</p>

<p>"But I *was* sent by the Watcher's Council. Ask Mr. Giles," he almost
pleaded.</p>

<p>Giles nodded. "His credentials check out."</p>

<p>"Fine. You wanna stay? Stay," I said, suddenly tired of arguing. If
he was so bent on being my Watcher, I'd just let him know early on
what a screwed up assignment he'd been given. Walking over and
slouching onto a chair, I let myself sigh once and then repeated what
I'd told Buffy before, not once lifting my eyes off the table in
front of me until I'd finally finished.</p>

<p>It was easier in a way. The words were familiar. Hell, I'd just said
them not more than an hour ago. But the reaction --- the reaction
ripped me up inside just like it did the first time. There were
gasps, mostly from my new Watcher and when I finally lifted my eyes
to catch the look on his face, I saw a hint of disgust before it was
hidden as the glare from the lights bounced off his glasses.</p>

<p>But what the fuck did I care what he thought? He was nobody to me.
When I looked over at Giles though, he was actually able to meet my
eyes and I saw that he understood ... a little anyway. Maybe Buffy
was right. Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea.</p>

<p>"We have to inform the Council."</p>

<p>Then again, what the fuck did I know?</p>

<p>"NO!" I didn't care that I shouted. I didn't care that he flinched
back like I was going to hit him or something cause right then, I
really did want to hurt him. "You tell anybody anything and I'm outta
here." I wasn't joking either. My bag was already packed, the money
was in the bank --- there was absolutely nothing holding me here.</p>

<p>"You can count me in too." I look over at Buffy. Her jaw's set in
that way she has when she's made up her mind on something and I
realize that, yeah, maybe there *was* something tying me here after
all. </p>

<p>I'm not gonna lie to myself. I mean, what would be the point? That
morning when I spilled my guts to her, I thought she would've totally
freaked but I didn't give her enough credit. She said she'd be there
for me and I knew she wouldn't lie. It's still a strange feeling
though ... having someone to back me up no matter what I do.</p>

<p>We both left Wesley sputtering in the middle of the library still
talking about protocols and rules --- whatever. He should've read my
background. If he did, he would've known I'd wipe my ass with
the 'rules' before I'd follow them. I thought about ditching the rest
of the day again but before I could come up with something decent to
do with the afternoon, Buffy grabs my arm and almost shoves me into
the girl's bathroom.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's the deal, B?" I turn around to face her and she's got a
scowl on her face. "What?" I ask again.</p>

<p>I think that might've been the wrong thing to say cause her scowl
only deepens and I wonder if she's mad at me or something.</p>

<p>"He's going to tell."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Wesley," she says, folding her arms and leaning back against a
sink. "He's going to go to the Council with this. No matter what he
told us, we can't trust him." </p>

<p>"I've got the same feeling but what am I gonna do about it? I can't
stop him from ratting. Like I said, if things go bad, I'm outta here."</p>

<p>She just looks at me, making me feel uncomfortable so I start
squirming and when I realize I'm squirming, I try to stop which just
irritated the hell outta me. And still she keeps staring at
me. "What?" I finally ask, knowing that it was probably something I
should have already known. </p>

<p>"You were just going to leave today weren't you? Just like that. Were
you planning on dropping me a note or were you going to wait until
you'd hit the road before giving me a call?"</p>

<p>"Well ... it wasn't like that ... "</p>

<p>"You were ready to do it not five seconds ago!" She practically
yelled. "Faith, do you even think of me as your girlfriend or am I
just someone you toss aside when it becomes convenient." </p>

<p>"Shit, will you give me a goddamn break? You think this is easy for
me? I just killed someone, B ... I *killed*. This ... thing ... has
been on my mind 24/7 and it's driving me crazy. I can't talk or eat
or drink or piss or sleep without seeing this guy's face, staring
back at me." I felt the slow burn of tears in my eyes but I couldn't
let them fall. "And it kills me that a part of me doesn't give a
shit." We're both staring hard at each other with nothing but silence
between us.</p>

<p>"What?" She asks, uncrossing her arms and looking a little confused.</p>

<p>I take a deep breath, feeling like I'm one step from taking a dive
off a steep cliff. One more step. "It doesn't matter in the end, B.
One guy, ten, a hundred ... What does it matter when we've saved
millions already? We're Slayers --- rules don't apply to us. They
don't cause we're not 'like' them ... right?"</p>

<p>She stares at me for a few more seconds and I was beginning to think
she was just gonna blow up but instead, she moves right in front of
me, cupping my face in between her hands.</p>

<p>"And you start wondering why you have to risk everything to keep
other people safe ... people you don't even know. And if you're going
to do this night in and night out, the least they can give back is a
little leeway if you mess up," she whispers, her eyes so intense that
I thought I was going to burn in them.</p>

<p>"Exactly." I breathe out the word, surprised that she understood.</p>

<p>She must've noticed the look I was giving her cause the next words
out of her mouth were, "I understand, Faith. I do. And I'm not saying
what you did was wrong because I can't judge you. If that demon had
run into me first instead of you, I would be the one in your shoes
right now. But you need to know you're not alone. I'll always be here
for you ... no matter what."</p>

<p>There was a definite lump in my throat so instead of answering, I
just nod and let her wrap me up in a hug. And I had to ask myself as
I buried my face against that warm neck, what had I done to deserve
someone like Buffy Summers? It just didn't seem right somehow that
she could love me like this. But damn, was I glad that she did.</p>

<p>"We'll get through this, Faith," she murmurs against my ear. "We've
gotten through so much already."</p>

<p>It was forever and a day before we let each other go but people were
starting to filter in through the bathroom doors ... not that I
minded an audience but it wasn't the best place to be communing with
my girlfriend. Cordelia came in once, took one look at the two of us
and left without a backward glance. I guess Queen C and I still had
issues. I seriously didn't know why she was so hung up ... it was
just one kiss. Even Buffy about forgotten about it.</p>

<p>"Let's go," Buffy says, pulling me from my thoughts.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Back home."</p>

<p>I smile a little. The words sound so right coming from her and it
warms me to know that, yeah, we do have a home together. "But what
about the new Watcher?" I ask, my mood already turning sour as I
thought back on what he could be doing right now.</p>

<p>"Forget him," she said simply. </p>

<p>That was about the only thing we could do anyway. So I let myself be
led out by the hand. "Oh," she added, almost as an afterthought, "We
still need to talk about your habit of cutting classes."</p>

<p>"Hey, as I remember it, you didn't win any awards for attendance
either."</p>

<p>"Well ... that was different."</p>

<p>"Gotta do better with the witty zingers, B. I'd have to give you a D -
 for that one on principle alone." It felt good to joke around.
Seemed like months since we'd done the banter thing.</p>

<p>Pushing me towards a side entrance, she scowled which still managed
to look cute on her face. Slapping me on the arm, she stealthily led
me out of the school. "Which reminds me," she adds, shooting me a
sideways glance that told me I wasn't going to like what she'd been
reminded of. "Don't you take your SAT's soon?"</p>

<p>I groaned, long and loud as she snickered, not offering me the least
bit of compassion. </p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Sometimes, things happen so fast and so suddenly that part of my
brain shuts down until I can gather myself together, find a nice
quiet, preferably dark spot and reflect on the situation better. This
is the Hellmouth. Needless to say, I've cornered the market in
finding these nice quiet, preferably dark spots.</p>

<p>I was already planning ahead, not even realizing it --- 'it' having
become habit by now. And as I watched Faith striding towards the
boarding terminal, I let all those doubts and uncertainties filter to
the back of my mind because they could all wait. Everything around us
was a swirling, hyperactive mess that seemed to be spinning out of
control even as we rushed to make sense of it.</p>

<p>We finally got to the counter and Faith slapped down our tickets,
barely controlling herself as she fidgeted while the woman behind the
desk looked the papers over like she was poring over the Dead Sea
Scrolls.</p>

<p>"One moment please," she says and before even waiting for a response
from us, she walks into a room behind her and closes the door.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," Faith grumbles, looking around suspiciously. I
couldn't say I blamed her because my hackles had stood up as soon as
we'd stepped inside the airport.</p>

<p>We heard the shuffle of footsteps behind us --- cautious and fast
approaching. We shared a glance before pivoting in sync.</p>

<p>"Come with us now." I'm sure Wesley had on his most intimidating,
authoritative glare but the fact that he couldn't keep the squeak out
his voice pretty much destroyed whatever image he'd wanted to convey.</p>

<p>"You should've let us go." Faith's voice, in comparison, is deadly
calm as she leveled a glare at the little group that was in front of
us. Four in all besides Wesley, all dressed in black.</p>

<p>"Don't make us force you," Wesley shot back, puffing up his chest
even as he backed up a couple of steps. "If you would just come with
us ... this is for your own good, Faith. Besides which, it's from
direct orders of the Council." </p>

<p>Faith struck first, her booted foot striking against the side of one
man's face before he could bring his hands up to block and from then
on, it was like playing shadow --- no thinking required, just follow
the leader until no one was left standing except the two of us. That
was supposed to be the end of it. We would leave now --- not forever
but just long enough for things to cool down. </p>

<p>That was the plan.</p>

<p>At least that *was* the plan until what felt like a sledgehammer hit
me from behind. I looked up at Faith and saw her looking back at me,
her mouth hanging open and her eyes growing wide as saucers. I looked
down at myself and finally notice that somehow, I'm on my knees
instead of standing up like I thought I was and there's blood seeping
out of my chest --- the stain blossoming like a rose. </p>

<p>Faith?</p>

<p>Everything's starting to get numb.</p>

<p>Faith?</p>

<p>I can't see anymore.</p>

<p>Faith?</p>

<p>Please don't let me die without seeing you. </p>

<p>Faith!!!</p>

<p>The chair scraped harshly across the floor as I pulled it closer to
the bed. Buffy's hand is warm as I take it in my own and like every
other time I come back into this room and see her still lying here, I
want to go back and kill the asshole that put her in this bed. I
would've done it the first time around if Giles and the others hadn't
shown up and tackled me before I could crush the bastard's windpipe.</p>

<p>Instead, I have to live with the fact that the son of a bitch is
still walking around somewhere.</p>

<p>"I wish I could've killed him for you Buffy," I whisper, the words
hoarse as they escape my throat. "He doesn't deserve to live ---
piece of scum ... " I reached out with my other hand, stroking a pale
cheek as I started talking. The first couple of days, I would just
sit here and hold her hand but somewhere along the way, I'd started
holding these one sided conversations, hoping that some of it was
getting through and maybe, just maybe, she'd answer me one of these
days. "Sorry, I know I'm repeating myself and you're probably bored
to death of hearing me say the same things over and over but ... it's
not fair. It's not fair when he gets to walk around while you're
stuck here." I dragged the chair even closer, brushing my lips across
her knuckles. "I know you're in there Buffy. Please wake up. I'm
tired of hearing myself talk."</p>

<p>Silence. Off in the distance there's a page over the PA system.</p>

<p>"I miss you so much. I miss the way you smile at me when I come into
a room. I miss the way you laugh when I do something stupid. I miss
the way you dump me out of bed when I'm too lazy to get up for
school. I miss the way your hand always find mine when we're walking.
I miss the way you say my name ... I miss *you*."</p>

<p>I start tearing up again and my vision starts to blur.</p>

<p>"B, I'm not as strong as you --- never was. So you have to come back."</p>

<p>If I beg enough. If I plead enough. Maybe she'll hear me.</p>

<p>"Please don't leave me, B."</p>

<p>I hear them opening the door but I can't look up. They talk to me but
I don't know what they're saying. They leave and I don't know how
long they've stayed.</p>

<p>"Please don't leave me here alone." </p>
