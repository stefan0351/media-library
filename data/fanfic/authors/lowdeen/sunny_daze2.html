<p>"So let me just get this straight," I said, pulling up to sit on the
edge of the table. I noticed the disapproval in Giles' face but it
wasn't like I was the only one on the table. Faith was almost
sprawled on the top of it with a towel covering her face. "This
Harvest is supposed to happen tonight?" Giles and Willow had just
given us a report on what their research had come up with. Apparently
some really old vampire was planning to break out of his magical
prison by sending one of his minions out to suck as much blood as he
could. I didn't know the specifics but that wasn't my job. My job was
to find the 'vessel' and take him out. </p>

<p>"Now, all we have to figure out is where they're going to attack,"
Giles continued. </p>

<p>"And I kill the vamp with the funky symbol on his head and the crisis
is over." I brought up my legs, sitting Indian style on the table
next to Faith's head.</p>

<p>"They'll be at the Bronze," Xander stated with absolute
certainty. "You said the vessel will need to feed as much as he can,
right? What decent vampire worth his salt could resist all that
young, fresh meat crammed into one place?"</p>

<p>"All right," I said nodding slowly. "We'll go to the Bronze tonight.
You guys are in charge of getting everybody out if it comes to that
and Faith and me will stop the vampires." Once everybody had agreed,
all we had to do for the rest of the day was wait. And Giles, being
the tweed wearing Watcher he was, proposed the perfect way to the
pass the time. He opened up the book cage and began pulling out this
bag full of weapons and I groaned, knowing he'd expect me to train
now. Glancing down next to me, I reached out one hand and lifted up a
corner of the towel, uncovering part of Faith's face. "You alive
under there?" I asked her with a frown.</p>

<p>Her hair had still been damp from the shower when she'd walked into
the library and promptly walked over to the table, laying herself
out. I think she grunted a hello to everyone before throwing that
towel over her face and then spent the time Giles was explaining
everything lying there like the dead.</p>

<p>"Twenty friggin laps," the voice under the towel said very slowly and
very clearly. I replaced the edge of the towel, letting her get back
to whatever it was she was doing. </p>

<p>Xander and Willow were standing over the weapon's bag commenting on
how exactly some of the weapons were supposed to be used. Willow
picked up a small mace, poking a finger at one of the sharp points
sticking up around the head. </p>

<p>"This looks pretty simple," she said, turning it around in her
hand. "You swing it back and forth and hope it hits something...it's
kinda heavy."</p>

<p>"Blunt force object," I said, going over and taking the mace from her
hand. "Has to be heavy to crush the head or the ribs or..." Looking
over at her, there was a squeamish expression on her face. "Maybe
we'd better lay off the weapons for awhile. Hey Will," I
added. "Thanks for being research girl. You've been a big help
especially since Giles refuses to step into the twentieth century."
She smiled brightly and went back to doing her thing at the computer
in the corner.</p>

<p>"I don't see any reason for me to have to use that blasted machine,"
Giles griped coming over, adjusting his pads as he talked. "Books
have been more than adequate for centuries and there'll be more than
adequate for centuries to come." </p>

<p>"All right Giles. You've made your point. Books have the staying
power," I said with a smirk. "We won't try to corrupt you anymore."
He gave me a long suffering look and then we started with the
training which was basically me taking shots at Giles and him saying
I was opening up too soon. After about half an hour of this, he
backed up, rubbing his arms and wherever else I'd been hitting him
and said that maybe it was time for me to practice with the crossbow. </p>

<p>He walked stiffly towards his office. I looked over at the table and
saw Xander grinning at me. I wonder if he'd been watching the whole
time. Faith was still laid out on the table, her breaths coming in a
slow and even rhythm. </p>

<p>"You need any help?" Xander quickly asked, getting up. </p>

<p>"Uh, yeah, could you set the targets up for me?" He almost stumbled
on his way to the book cage as I walked back to the table. </p>

<p>Lowering my head until I was right next to Faith's toweled head, I
whispered her name. She didn't respond or move an inch so after a
couple of seconds, I carefully lifted the towel off her face. Her
eyes were closed, her expression totally peaceful. I pushed the towel
to the side, letting my fingers trail a soft pattern down one soft,
smooth cheek. What am I doing I vaguely wondered. My thumb grazed,
barely touching full lips that parted a little wider, feeling the
soft exhalation of breath warm on my skin.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" I looked up and saw Xander looking strangely over at me.</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said moving away reluctantly and walking towards where he'd
set up the target. "Thanks Xander." I took the crossbow out of his
hands and loaded it with an arrow as he walked back to sit at the
table. Things remained quiet like that until it was time for us to
take off for the Bronze. Giles packed some weapons. I took the
crossbow and a few extra arrows. Faith woke up, seeming more
refreshed than she'd looked when she first walked into the library.
We were as ready as we'd ever be to take down some major bad guys.</p>

<p>We piled into Giles' poor excuse of a car and waited while he tried
to start it up. Xander was sitting shotgun. "Do they really pay
librarians that little?" He asked when the car still wouldn't start.</p>

<p>"This is a perfectly serviceable vehicle," he stated as he turned the
key again. This time, there was a loud booming sound as the car
backfired and the engine finally turned over. </p>

<p>"When exactly would that have been true?" Xander joked again. "Back
in the '50's?"</p>

<p>Next to me, Willow stifled a giggle as Faith, not being much for
diplomacy, snorted out loud. Giles ignored us all as he pulled out of
the parking lot. I really hoped the drive over wouldn't be as
traumatic as what was about to go down tonight. Although, it was a
close call, we made it to the club just when the vampires were
muscling the bouncer around out front. Faith hopped out of the car
and threw herself against one of them while I shot a crossbow bolt in
another one's heart, turning him to dust.</p>

<p>I saw the big vamp from yesterday who had been tossing me and Faith
around coming right at me. He also had a symbol painted on his
forehead which meant that he was my target. So much the better. I
tossed the crossbow at him which he knocked away but that slowed him
down just enough so I could move into him and throw him onto the
ground. Taking the stake from inside my jacket, I rammed it down but
he caught it in his hand just before it entered his chest. So we were
deadlocked in that position, me on top and him on the bottom when
someone threw some liquid at in his face which made him screech like
a baby. I took that as my cue to jam the stake down as hard as I
could, turning him into a cloud of dust. </p>

<p>I looked up and saw Willow standing with an empty bottle of holy
water in her hands. She had an excited expression on her face as she
helped me up. "Thanks Will," I said, giving her a brief smile before
going to help Xander and Giles who were finishing off the last of the
vamps who weren't smart enough to run yet. It didn't take too long
for us to finish the rest of them off. They were mostly newbies
anyway, thinking they were invincible and all that. When we were
done, I looked around and saw that Faith was still busy...busy
pounding on someone struggling beneath her. They were partially under
the light thrown off from the bulb on top of the club's door but I
couldn't see who she was pounding on until I stepped closer and saw
that it was Darla, the blonde from yesterday.</p>

<p>She just kept hitting and hitting, her fists coming down again and
again. "Faith," I said, trying to get her attention. She didn't stop.
If anything, she just hit harder. "Faith!" I shouted, grabbing her by
the shoulders and falling back when she turned around and lashed out
at me. She seemed to suddenly realize what she'd done and she froze.
Darla was still pinned underneath her but she bucked her hips,
throwing Faith off. She would've run away if I hadn't thrown the
stake in her back, reducing her to dust.</p>

<p>I crouched down to where Faith was still sitting on the ground, a
look of absolute revulsion in her eyes. "Faith?" I reached out slowly
to cup her face in my hand.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she began to say, her voice thick with whatever emotions
she was feeling.</p>

<p>"Shhhh...it's all right," I said, going down on my knees in front of
her and pulling her into a hug. She held on tight and I could feel
her entire body trembling before she suddenly pushed me away and
stood up.</p>

<p>I watched, confused by her actions as she walked towards Giles and I
heard her ask "So, are we done here?" When Giles said the situation
was neutralized for the moment, Faith walked into the Bronze without
saying anything else. </p>

<p>"Is she going to be all right?" Willow asked, looking to me. I didn't
know what to say to her because I didn't know. It was like Faith
hadn't even known where she was when she was hitting Darla. It was
almost like she was lashing out for the sake of lashing out at
something. Whatever it was, I was going to find out. </p>

<p>"I'll let you know as soon as I do," I said, following Faith into the
club. Everybody inside was clueless as to how close they'd come to
being vampire chow. They danced and they laughed and they talked and
I envied them that innocence that I could no longer afford. It took a
few moments for my eyes to find Faith at the bar. I was just going
over to her when I felt those spidey senses kicking in and turning
back around, I spotted the 'special' vamp from yesterday coming in
through the door. I couldn't get that label out of my head and he
wasn't really helping me out since he still hadn't told me his name
yet. His eyes darted all over the club and I tensed, half expecting
him to change into game face and go crazy in here. But he didn't. He
only motioned me over to a quiet corner.</p>

<p>"You're tougher than I expected," he said as soon as I followed.</p>

<p>"I guess you saw me waste your buddies outside," I said, still tense.
Why am I talking to a vampire anyway? Even if he didn't seem so bad,
he was still a vampire and I haven't met one yet who didn't want to
kill me.</p>

<p>"They're not my buddies," he said, almost growling it out. "I'd kill
them all if I could."</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" I asked, squinting at him through the dim light. He
had a black duster on and everything else on him, that I could see at
least, was also black. I think he and Faith would get on real well,
what with their simple yet bold fashion statements. Thinking of
Faith, I looked back to the bar but she wasn't there anymore. He was
saying something else but I only caught the tail end of it.</p>

<p>"...watch out. The Master won't be pleased." What? He began to walk
away.</p>

<p>"Wait," I said. "I don't even know your name."</p>

<p>Without stopping, he turned his head slightly and said, "Angel."
Whoa. That was probably about the worse name you could have if you
were a vampire...well, besides Jesus anyway. </p>

<p>Shaking the encounter off, I looked around once again for Faith. When
I finally spotted her, I felt my eyes practically popping out of
their sockets. She was dancing but that wasn't what was freaking me
out. The person she was dancing with was...Cordelia? Since that first
day when I'd seen Faith checking out Cordelia's ass, I hadn't even
seen the two of them in the same room together. And now they were
dancing together? This wasn't even hands off, with a foot in between
them dancing. This was every body part coming into contact at least
once dancing. I just stood there watching them and thinking that I
shouldn't be so angry. But I was. It was the same feeling I'd gotten
the last time I'd seen them together, only a lot worse.</p>

<p>I'd told myself that I shouldn't feel like this. Faith can talk to
anyone she wants, flirt with anyone she wants, and dance with anyone
she wants because she has no reason not to. Why should she care if
I'm standing here feeling like I'm about to blow up when *I* didn't
even know why I'm feeling this way? I should've just turned around
but I couldn't move, I couldn't take my eyes off them even though I
wanted to shut it out, burn the whole thing from my brain. I finally
broke from my trance when some guy bumped me from the side, spilling
half his drink on my clothes.</p>

<p>Shaking off his apologies, I took off for the bathroom, still shaken
up from what had just happened. The only good thing about the night
turned out to be that the drink I'd been spilled with was only water
and not fruit juice or something. After I dried that up some with a
paper towel, I looked at myself in the mirror, trying to see if I
looked any different, trying to see if what I was feeling was stamped
across my face. It wasn't...not really. I looked the same as I always
did. It was the same face staring back at me that I'd seen every
morning for the last seventeen years or however long it'd been since
I'd learned how to use a mirror. But the more I stared, the more I
kept flashing back to the two of them outside. Faith and Cordelia.
Dancing.</p>

<p>The bathroom door opened and I watched in the mirror as three girls
walked in. I was just about to leave because I vaguely remembered
them as being part of Cordelia's group and I really didn't need to be
around that right then. But what they said caught my attention.</p>

<p>"What is Cordy thinking?" The blonde one almost squealed,
disbelieving. "She's dancing...with a girl! And, hello, she's *so*
skanky." The other two nodded and agreed like she was some kind of
prophet spouting pearls of wisdom. "You think someone slipped
something in her drink? You know, I heard this kind of thing happens
all..." I slipped out of the room before I had to listen to anything
else they had to say because, honestly, if I stayed any longer, I
think I would have done something physically violent to them all.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>There was a soft knock on the door and I heard Buffy's voice asking
if she could come in. I wanted to say no. I wanted to so badly that I
thought about barring the door with a chair so she couldn't come in
here and ask the questions I was sure she was going to ask. It was
why I'd slipped out of the Bronze without her earlier and come home
without her. Mom was so pissed off that we didn't come home for
dinner or even bothered to call her that she'd grounded me. The thing
was though, the punishment wasn't what bugged me, it was the
disappointment in her eyes when she said she expected more from me.
Why? Why would she expect any more from me than all those other
people who've come in and out of my life all those times before?</p>

<p>It was almost as bad as the look Buffy had given me when I flipped
out back there. </p>

<p>I'd almost hit her.</p>

<p>Shit, that thought scares me so much. That I could just lose it like
that and hurt someone close to me...closer to me than anyone's ever
been. But, at the same time, it felt so good to let go and wail all
out on someone. She was evil anyway, she was going to be staked no
matter what so why couldn't I take out some of my anger on her? Buffy
had just come at me at the wrong time. I was spaced out. I didn't
know who the hell she was and the last thing I wanted to do was talk
to her about what had happened. I'd done everything to avoid her. I'd
gone into the Bronze, I'd danced, and I'd left before she saw me
going.</p>

<p>She came home fifteen minutes after I did and probably gotten
grounded like I did which meant she was supposed to be in her room,
not outside of mine, wanting to check up on me.</p>

<p>"Please, Faith. I need to talk to you." I could just picture her. The
look on her face as she's talking to my door. That look that said she
understood me, that she forgave me, that she's there for me. So what
did I do? I buried my face into the pillow, hoping she'd give up and
leave me alone. But instead, I heard the door turning and I felt a
weight getting on the bed next to me. She didn't talk immediately and
I wondered what she could be thinking about. Her hand started running
through my hair, her fingertips massaging the back of my neck and I
felt like just curling up and dying cause she shouldn't have to make
me feel better. I'm the one that messed up. But I couldn't make
myself shake her hand off.</p>

<p>"You can talk to me about anything." Her voice was soft, gentle. "I
won't judge you, Faith. Whatever happened back there, we can just
pretend like it never did. It doesn't matter cause we won, right?"
There was a forced chuckle and when I turned my face to look up at
her, that sadness in her eyes which had always been there for as long
as I had known her just seemed so much more magnified, so much
deeper. Did I do that to her? Oh, fuck me if I did.</p>

<p>I sat up and pulled her into my arms, feeling her sink into me and I
felt like everything would be all right if we just stayed like that
and forgot all that other shit. "Can you tell how sorry I am?" I
asked, hoping she really did. I felt her chuckling again but it was
for real this time. I pulled back and I knew it was about time I gave
something of myself up to someone who'd already done so much for me
but it was just so hard to open up. Wanting to was one thing,
actually doing it was another. "I, uhm...sometimes," I started over
again, feeling like the words just wouldn't come out of my
mouth. "Sometimes, I lose myself and it's like I'm watching myself
but from a distance, y'know? And it's like there's something inside
that makes me want to lash out, hurt whoever's in my face at the time
and I can't stop." I wasn't looking at her. I was focusing on the
pattern on the bedspread cause I didn't want to see what she must be
thinking of me. Of how fucked up I was.</p>

<p>"Stop thinking that," she said, making me look up at her. How the
hell? Was she reading my mind or something? "I know what you're
thinking cause it's written all over your face." Oh. "I'm not going
to pretend that I know everything that's going on inside of you right
now but I just want you to know that I'm here, okay? I'll always be
here for you because...because we're family now." </p>

<p>I think about that word. Family. I had a family once. And now I
realize more than ever, staring as I was at Buffy, that I have a
family again. She left my room after giving me another hug and I
spent the rest of the night lying in bed, wondering how I could ever
live up to this image she has of me. That night, I dreamed about her.
My mom, I mean. I don't really ever dream about her...anymore. I
wondered why I was dreaming about her now. </p>

<p>When I woke up the next morning, the clock on the desk said it was
noon. I couldn't believe I'd slept so late and nobody bothered waking
me until I remembered today was Saturday. I would've just rolled over
and gone back to sleep but I heard laughter and loud voices from
downstairs and that made me curious enough to get up.</p>

<p>When I got downstairs, Xander, Willow and Buffy were all on the couch
acting like old buds. Xander grinned that goofy, cute grin when he
saw me walking in. "Look who's coming in to join us," he said, his
eyes looking a little too long at my chest. Typical guy behavior but
at least he was one of the good guys.</p>

<p>"Hi Faith." Willow was in one of those two sizes too big sweaters she
seems to like so much. Something's gotta be done about that girl and
her confidence cause I know there's a body in there somewhere.</p>

<p>I sat on the armrest next to Buffy who placed her hand on my knee,
giving me a grin. "Good sleep?" She asked.</p>

<p>"One of you guys shoulda woken me up," I said, running a hand through
my hair. "Did I miss anything good?"</p>

<p>"Only the whole entire Saturday morning lineup of cartoons," Xander
said, gesturing towards the TV. "But you're in time for Soul Train."</p>

<p>"Think I'll pass." I got up and walked into the kitchen about to get
something to eat when the doorbell rang. "I'll get it," I said,
detouring towards the front door. The person I saw on the doorstep
was about the last person I expected to see standing there. Cordelia,
little Miss Cheerleader herself was standing there, looking like she
wanted to bolt. </p>

<p>We stood there, staring at each other for a minute before she looked
at me pointedly and asked, "Don't you have any manners? Aren't you
going to invite me in?"</p>

<p>I smirked, moving aside so she could brush past me like a diva. I
shut the door and turned around and she was all up in my face, asking
me what I thought I was doing yesterday, that I'd probably single-
handedly ruined her reputation, that I'd ruined her image and a lot
of other bullshit like that. I was rubbing a hand over my face,
wishing she'd just shut up for a second when Buffy walked out of the
living room with Xander and Willow not too far behind her. Cordelia
turned around with this horrified expression on her face and we were
all just standing around staring at each other when she suddenly
turned to me and hissed that she needed to talk to me alone. Emphasis
on the alone. </p>

<p>Yeah, like I needed to spend any more time letting her walk all over
me. I was just about to kick her ass --- and a really nice ass she
has --- out the door when she friggin dragged me upstairs and into
Buffy's room. She slammed the door shut and turned to me. I was all
ready for another bitch session but she just went over to the bed and
sat down, putting her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"What did you do to me?" She asked. Her voice was muffled but I could
still hear the confusion and fear in there.</p>

<p>"What did I do to you?" I asked, just as confused. "Shit, I have no
idea what the fuck you're talking about. I didn't do anything to you.
Hell, I'd remember if I did." I think.</p>

<p>She looked up at me like I was the worst kind of scum and she slapped
me before I knew what was coming. I grabbed her arm when she tried to
just up and leave. I almost wanted to hit her back but, instead, I
asked, "You can't just leave without telling me why you slapped me,
not after laying all that shit on me." I let go of her arm when she
started wincing. "I want to know what you think I did, okay?"</p>

<p>She looked like she was going to slap me again and I tensed,
preparing myself. "You danced with me," she finally said, gritting
her teeth as she folded her arms across her chest.</p>

<p>I had to let that thought sink in first. Yeah, she was right. We'd
danced. But so what? I'd seen her on the dance floor when I was at
the Bronze and she hadn't been dancing with anyone, just swaying to
the music. "If you didn't want to dance with me, you could've just
walked away," I said, watching her for her reaction.</p>

<p>"You...I...I couldn't..." She kept stuttering, trying to come up with
something. Trying to come up with some reason she didn't, I guess. </p>

<p>If I waited around for her to come up with a reason, I'd probably be
up here all day so I stepped right into her, smirking slightly when I
heard her inhale a sudden breath. I put a hand on her arm and
said, "Why don't you come and tell me when you've thought about it a
little?" I gave her my most winning grin and let my hand reach around
her to the doorknob. "See ya." I winked at her and went downstairs
into the kitchen. I heard her walk down a couple minutes later,
followed by the sound of the front door opening and closing.</p>

<p>Taking a bowl of cereal into the living room, I sat down, squeezing
next to Red and Buffy. I could see they really wanted to ask but I
wasn't sure who exactly would be the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Was that Cordelia who breezed in and out of here without insulting
me once or was that just some hormonally charged teenage fantasy?"
Xander. I should've known he'd be the first to put in his two cents.</p>

<p>"You have fantasies about her?" I asked, looking over at him and
quirking my eyebrow. He ducked his head and shrugged. He was just too
damn easy. I grinned and looked over at Buffy whose eyes were zeroed
in on the TV screen.</p>

<p>"'Sup B?" I asked, shoveling another spoonful of cereal into my
mouth. "You don't look so good."</p>

<p>"I'm fine," she said, almost cutting off my sentence before I'd
gotten it out. Her eyes were still glued to the screen. For someone
who insisted she was fine, she didn't really look it but I wasn't
going to push her if she didn't want to talk. </p>

<p>Xander and Willow spent the rest of the day at the house even though,
technically they weren't supposed to be there since Buffy and me were
still grounded but I saw it this way. Whatever mom didn't know
wouldn't hurt her. Buffy was still kinda out of it but she kept
insisting that she was fine and nothing was the matter. I started
thinking that maybe it was cause of Cordy since it was only after she
came over that Buffy started acting all weird. Maybe she didn't like
her or some other shit like that. I didn't know cause she wouldn't
tell me.</p>

<p>The weekend passed way too quickly and, pretty soon, it was Monday
again. Back to the same old grind. Same old classes. Same old boring
teachers. But at least Buffy seemed to be back to her normal self
again. Of course, that was before I walked into the library and found
her in a cheerleader's uniform. I'd just walked in on Giles' lecture
on how much of a waste of time cheerleading was.</p>

<p>"Maybe you can talk some sense into her," he muttered, walking back
into his beloved stacks.</p>

<p>"So what do you think?" She asked, running both hands down her
uniform and smiling expectantly at me.</p>

<p>I was just gonna open my mouth and tell her exactly how sexy she
looked when Xander and Willow walked in.</p>

<p>"Holy shi--uhm, wow!" Xander's mouth was gulping air like a fish.</p>

<p>I looked back to Buffy and grinned. "I guess that pretty much sums up
what I'm thinking too," I said, watching as her face lit up. The
three of us walked her over to the gym where the cheerleading tryouts
were taking place.</p>

<p>"How could you not get in?" Willow asked. "You're you know, the big S
plus you've got cheerleading experience. They'd be nuts not to pick
you."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," Buffy said with a nervous grin. "But I still
have butterflies in my stomach."</p>

<p>When we got inside the gym, there were a bunch of girls already
standing around, some were going over their routines, some were just
standing still, some looked totally confident but they were all there
trying out for a spots on the team.</p>

<p>"Um, Buffy?" Xander was looking about as nervous as some of those
girls. "I got you something. Kinda like a good luck charm." He handed
her a bracelet with the inscription 'Yours Always' and then blushed
when Buffy thanked him. If I didn't know better, I'd think someone
had crushy feelings. He and Willow moved off to get seats. </p>

<p>"Are you sure you can stay and watch me?" Buffy asked, turning me
around to face her. "Don't you have practice today?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. I have practice every day but I'm only going
to get to see you wow these people once." I gave her a wink. "So go
wow 'em." She gave me a wide smile before I went over to the
bleachers and sat down next to Xander and Willow and let my eyes roam
around the room. I wasn't too surprised seeing Cordelia in the middle
of a group of her cronies. I caught her eye for a minute and gave her
a grin which seemed to really freak her out cause she turned away so
fast, I think she almost gave herself whiplash. I had been wondering
what her problem was ever since she'd come to my house and slapped
me. It couldn't have been just me dancing with her cause it wasn't
like I forced her to dance with me. Then again, maybe she was just a
psycho but it was something interesting to gnaw on.</p>

<p>Then my attention turned back to the gym floor where some girl was
starting her performance. "Damn, she's good," I muttered as she did
some flips and splits that were absolutely phenomenal.</p>

<p>"That's Amber," Willow said. "I heard she turned down an offer of
being a Laker girl." I couldn't say I didn't believe her cause this
girl was really *that* good. But then she started smoking --- I mean
really smoking and then she caught on fire. Damn, couldn't this weird
stuff lay off for just one day?</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Amber had gone down in a ball of flames and that's not really
stretching the truth too much. To top it all off, I didn't even have
a chance to try out before the fire department came roaring in
although there wasn't much of a fire to put out by then. There wasn't
much we could do besides research and I left that for Willow who was
going to hack into Amber's files and see if she had had episodes of
spontaneously combusting in the past. That had all been yesterday.
Today was another day and I was determined to have my try out and
make the squad.</p>

<p>The idea had burrowed into my head sometime during the weekend...some
time after Cordelia's unexpected, unwelcome visit. She'd just barged
into my house like some blue blood royal and dragged Faith upstairs
to do god knows what. If their dance had bothered me, this incident
was literally eating me alive inside. I couldn't deal. I just
couldn't. Just thinking about them being together made me want to go
out, find a vampire and stake him over and over again. And that was
probably when the idea of trying out for the squad started forming in
my mind. Not only was it something extracurricular, i.e. non-Slayer
related activity, but I figured Cordelia would probably be trying out
as well. And seeing as I couldn't exactly stake her, the next best
thing was to beat her during the course of competition. Not as bloody
but it would feel just as good. It wasn't very rational but then
again, I wasn't really feeling too rational.</p>

<p>When they called my name, I went out there and did an old routine I'd
learned from my old school, only I added a couple more gymnastic
moves to spice it up. I looked for Faith after I finished but I
didn't see her anywhere and my mood just fell. Xander came up to me
though. He'd been there every minute of the competition rooting me on
and I told him exactly how sweet I thought that was.</p>

<p>"You're w-welcome," he said. "By the way...I was wondering...if you
weren't too busy..." </p>

<p>I was listening to him talking. I really was but when I caught sight
of Faith coming into the gym, I just couldn't concentrate
anymore. "Xander, I'll talk to you later, okay?" I left him and
hurried towards Faith who smiled as soon as she saw me.</p>

<p>"Sorry, B," she said, running a hand through her hair. That was her
signature gesture which meant she was agitated about
something. "Coach was really riding my ass for yesterday so she made
me stay longer. Did I miss your routine?" I nodded. "Shit! I'm sorry.
I really wanted to be here to cheer for you."</p>

<p>"It's all right, you couldn't help it," I said. "Xander was here so I
still had a cheering section -- person. So, don't worry about it."
She glanced behind me at Xander.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she said with a thoughtful expression on her face. I wonder
what she was thinking? "Oh, by the way," she said, looking at me
again. "Did Cordelia go yet?" Okay, now I really wished I didn't know
what she was thinking.</p>

<p>"Uh, no, not yet." I followed her to the bleachers as we sat down to
look at the rest of my competition. When Cordelia went on to perform,
I glanced over at Faith and saw that she had this intense look in her
eyes and a grin on her face. As soon as Cordelia finished her
routine, Faith got up and excused herself as she walked up to the
cheerleader and whispered something in her ear which made Cordelia
drag her outside the gym.</p>

<p>"What's up with them?" I'd forgotten that Xander was even sitting
next to me when he spoke up. "I've never seen anyone get to Cordy
like Faith does. It's kinda neat to see."</p>

<p>I didn't say anything. I just continued to mopily look at the rest of
the cheerleaders. But I didn't see them. What I saw was the mental
image of Cordelia and Faith --- Faith and Cordelia. And when everyone
had done their routine and all there was left to do was post the
names of the people who had made the team, Faith and Cordelia still
hadn't come back. Willow came by just as they were putting up the
results. It turned out that I didn't make the team, not the first
string anyway. But, of course, Cordelia did. I was so wrapped up in
my failure that I almost didn't notice when Amy, another one of the
try-outs, ran away, crying.</p>

<p>"What happened?" I asked. Willow turned to me and told me that Amy
hadn't made first team either. "But that's still kind of over
reacting a bit, don't you think? Or am I missing something
fundamental?"</p>

<p>"Amy's mother was a cheerleader too. But she was like this perfect
cheerleader and she won all these awards. We even have a trophy from
her displayed in the case in the hallway. So, Amy's got a lot to live
up to."</p>

<p>My mind started working again as I processed this new information.
Since the Amber lead pretty much went nowhere, Amy was now moving way
up in my list of suspects. We walked to the library to see if Giles
had dug up anymore information. When I walked in, my eyes immediately
found the two people I'd been looking for. Cordelia was seated on a
chair as Giles and Faith hovered over her with concern on their
faces. </p>

<p>"What's going on?" I asked, going over to the three of them.</p>

<p>Giles answered. "It seems there's been some type of witchcraft
performed. A binding spell is my guess. Cordelia's vision has been
impaired."</p>

<p>"I'm blind," Cordelia corrected with a hint of anger and fear. Xander
went up and waved a hand across her face. "Whatever you're doing,
stop it! I can smell your cheap cologne, Xander. Do you bathe in that
stuff?" Xander backed off sheepishly. Since we didn't have any other
suspects on my extremely short list, we all went over to Amy's house
to confront her. Cordelia was in a good mood when we left because
Willow had told her she'd made first string. When Faith had asked me
if I'd made it, I'd muttered something about being an alternate and
walking out of there before she could say anything else. </p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon passed by in a blur as we were all caught
up in the Nancy Drew routine. It ended with Amy's mom getting herself
zapped into that trophy of hers in the school hallway and Amy getting
her hijacked body back from her mom who had wanted to relive her
youth a little too much. All in all, I'd say it was a productive
afternoon, although no actual slaying was involved and Cordelia
hadn't even said so much as a thanks when she'd left. I walked
through the cemetery, having sneaked out to do my nightly patrol of
the town. Faith had wanted to come but I'd given her some excuse
about needing to have some time alone. I thought I saw a flash of
hurt in her eyes when I'd said that but I might've just imagined it
because it was gone just as fast as it had appeared.</p>

<p>Everything was getting too confusing. And it was true. I needed some
time alone to get my head together because, right now, everything was
muddled up, especially my emotions. They were all over the place and
I didn't know why. A soft rustling behind me made me turn around, a
stake already in my hand. No matter how preoccupied I was, this was
still a cemetery and this was Sunnydale so my instincts and senses
were still very much tuned in even if my brain wasn't. "I don't have
time for the stalking routine so just come out like a good little
vampire." There was another rustling and then Angel walked out of the
shadows. I lowered the stake but didn't put it away. "What do you
want?" </p>

<p>"Why do you think I want anything?" He asked, coming closer. "I
could've just been walking through and spotted you."</p>

<p>"Were you?"</p>

<p>"No," he admitted. "But I could have been." Great, a joker. I turned,
putting the stake back in my pocket and continuing my patrol. I heard
his footsteps following behind me and eventually, after a few moments
of silence, he spoke again.</p>

<p>"That was very impressive what you did to Luke and Darla."</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me that already?" I asked as he walked up next to me.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to start some conversation...I'm not too good at it yet."
We lapsed into silence again and I glanced at him out of the corner
of my eye. For a vampire, he was still pretty hot looking.</p>

<p>"You're not really like other vampires, are you?" I asked, sneaking
another glimpse at him.</p>

<p>"What gave it away?"</p>

<p>"You're not trying to kill me," I said bluntly. "That's pretty
different." I wasn't sure I heard it right but I think I heard a
chuckle coming from him.</p>

<p>"You were thinking about something before I turned up," he said. I
guess he wasn't kidding about the lack of conversational skills
because that had been a pretty abrupt change of topic. </p>

<p>"Yeah, but not like I don't want to share it with you --- wait,
that's right. I really don't want to share it with you." </p>

<p>"Fair enough." The conversation, what there was of it, pretty much
stalled there but he still ended up walking me back to my house.</p>

<p>"Okay," I said, turning to him. "This has been...pleasant but you'll
understand if I don't invite you in." He nodded and stood there as I
climbed the tree up to my window. When I looked down again, he was
gone which capped off a perfectly weird day to begin with. I crawled
through the window and plopped down on the bed as soon as I got in. I
laid there for a few more minutes before changing into my pajamas
and, on the spur of the moment, I went across the hall to Faith's
room and knocked on her door.</p>

<p>"Come in, B."</p>

<p>"How'd you know it was me?" I asked, walking over and sitting on the
bed next to her. She was lying on her belly, leafing through a book.</p>

<p>She quirked her eyebrow as she looked up at me. "Who else wants to
come into my room in the middle of the night besides you B?" She
turned towards her book again and then just as quickly looked back at
me. "What was with the vamp escort downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel?"</p>

<p>"You've gotta be kidding me," she said with a big grin as she sat
up. "That's his name?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, pretty ironic, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty pathetic. So what's up with the two of you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, he just decided to show up for patrol tonight and then
he walked me home."</p>

<p>She gave me a skeptical look. "Are you sure he's not dangerous, B?"</p>

<p>I frowned as I thought about it. "I can't be a hundred percent sure
but all he's done is help us so far."</p>

<p>Faith still looked unconvinced but she let it drop. I watched as she
turned back to her book again, a hank of her hair falling forwards
from where she'd tucked it behind one ear. I almost reached out to
tuck it back for her but instead, I asked, "What are you reading?"</p>

<p>"The Odyssey. I've gotta get the crip notes in the morning cause this
shit's boring." She tossed the book across the room where it landed
on top of her bookbag which I've never actually seen her use. She
turned over so that she was lying on her back. "So are you going to
sit there all night or are you going to get in bed already?" She
asked with a smirk, looking at me.</p>

<p>I grinned and crawled over her, slipping under the covers beside her.
She stifled a yawn and turned off the lamp before getting under the
covers herself. The first thing she did was wrap an arm around my
waist and pull me close as she rested her head on my shoulder. I
think I forgot to breathe for a second. She let out another yawn and
then snuggled closer. "I hate books that make me want to go to
sleep," she muttered, under her breath. I didn't say anything at the
comment. I just enjoyed the feeling of being close to her like that.
After a few minutes, I thought she'd gone to sleep but then she
rolled onto her back again. I missed the contact immediately.</p>

<p>"Hey, B. Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said, rolling onto my side and resting my chin on her
shoulder. I could make out her expression just fine --- one of those
cool Slayer powers --- and she looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Do you hate Cordy or something?" The question blind sided me from
out of nowhere. Why was she asking about Cordelia of all people? "B?"
She prompted when I still hadn't answered.</p>

<p>"Um, no, why would you think that?" </p>

<p>"Cause, every time she's around, you act weird and spazzed out." I
turned my head so I wouldn't have to see her face.</p>

<p>"Just because I don't hate her doesn't mean I like her either...but
if you want to be friends with her...it's fine with me." I think I
actually choked over those last few words.</p>

<p>Faith took a deep breath as she moved her arm to wrap it around
me. "Do you know what I was thinking the first time I saw Cordy? I
was basically thinking the same thing the first time I saw you too.
You're both different from that bunch of sheep you hang out with.
There's actually someone in there worth knowing and I wanted to crack
Cordy's act so I could get to know that person. But she's turning out
to be a real hard case."</p>

<p>"Oh." That was the only thing I could think of saying. She thought we
were alike?</p>

<p>"But if you don't like her, then I can just forget the whole thing."</p>

<p>"No...it's not that..." I was starting to feel guilty about hating
Cordelia and I hated that. "Look, Faith. Why does it matter if I like
her or not? She's your friend. If you want to hang with her then you
should just do it."</p>

<p>"It matters cause you're the most important person in my life, B.
Don't you know that? And if something upsets you, it upsets me as
well." I was shocked at what she'd just said and, at the same time,
warmed over completely by it. For the rest of the night, I laid
there, listening to Faith's heartbeat under my ear until I fell
asleep.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I jogged off the track, my lungs feeling like they were burning,
fighting for every breath. The sweat was just rolling off of my face
and I shut my eyes to stop the stinging saltiness.</p>

<p>"Faith," Coach's voice boomed out my name as she came up behind me
and slapped me on the back. Sometimes, I don't think that woman knows
her own strength. "Great practice today. You're going to knock their
socks off on Sunday. I know this is your first meet but don't be
nervous. I haven't seen anyone as good as you...well, just don't be
nervous." She punched me this time on the arm and walked off to yell
at someone on the other side of the track. I think that's her way of
encouraging me. At least I hope that's what that awkward attempt at
closeness was.</p>

<p>I looked around as my breath started coming in easier. Sunnydale.</p>

<p>God, what a fucked up town. How long have I been here? Three, four
months? And in that time, I'd seen more weird shit than some people
do in their whole entire lifetime, even if they lived to be a hundred
and fifty. In that one month, one cheerleader was blinded, one was
set on fire, Xander had dated a suped up praying mantis, Xander had
turned into a pig eating hyena demon, the Principal had died
under 'mysterious' circumstances, the Master Vampire was still trying
to break out of his prison to wreak havoc on the world and that was
on top of the daily dosage of vamps I saw when patrolling with Buffy.</p>

<p>But if someone were to come up to me and ask if I'd trade in this
life for another, I would've said a quick and firm no before I
grabbed that person and kicked their ass all over this field. Cause,
for the first time in a really, really long time, I was happy.
Totally and completely happy. And I'll be damned if anyone was going
to try and mess with that. </p>

<p>Willow and Xander were two of the coolest people I'd ever met and I
was proud that they called me their friend. Mrs. Summers, mom, was
nothing but good to me and never treated me like I was anyone but her
daughter. Sometimes, when I looked at her, I wondered what she could
possibly have seen in me to want to adopt me. But whatever it was, I
am so glad she saw it. Giles...Giles was Giles, a tweedy, stuffy
Watcher. But I knew he cared about all of us in his own stuffy,
English way. Maybe more than he's supposed to.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there's Buffy. I can feel the grin spreading
across my face just thinking about her. I remembered back to that
night when I'd told her she was the most important person in my life
and I could feel her smile against my skin. That hadn't changed. In
fact, I think she means even more to me now, if that's at all
possible. She's not just my friend, she's not just my adopted sister,
she's the only person I think I could ever open up to...if I ever
decided to open up that is. She's someone who makes me want to wake
up in the morning just so I can see her face and talk to her.
Usually, I don't even have to get up for that cause she's in my bed
already.</p>

<p>I walked over to my duffel bag which I'd dumped off to the side and
took out a towel, wiping the sweat from my face and neck. It was
pretty sweet having something outside of demons, witchcraft, and
vampires to spend my time on, not that it wasn't fun and all but
spending 24/7 on that stuff would make me go crazy. I don't know how
Buffy does it. That's also another thing I love about the girl. She's
as tough as they come and she handles anything this freaking town can
throw at her. I seriously don't know how a dinky town like Sunnydale
even survived for as long as it did without her.</p>

<p>After I showered and changed into something a little less soaked with
sweat, I wandered over to the library where the gang always hung out.
It was like our unofficial, official headquarters. Kinda like the
batcave, only without the cave or the bats or the super cool
equipment. They were all in there. Xander, Red, Giles, and Buffy, all
hunkered down researching about another demon who'd threatened to end
the world. I'd lost track of which one it was this time but it didn't
matter cause whatever it was, Buffy was gonna kick its ass. I had
absolutely no doubt about that at all. </p>

<p>"Hey Faith." Xander was the first one to look up. "Pull up a chair
and join the party." He patted the one next to him, giving me an
inviting grin.</p>

<p>"Thanks a lot, Chuckles," I said, sitting down and pulling a heavy,
musty book towards me. If they're not heavy then they're musty and if
they're not musty then they're heavy. I honestly don't think this
library has any books of the thin and new category. After about
fifteen minutes, which was pretty much average for me, my eyelids
started feeling heavy and I felt myself nodding off. Before I knew
it, someone was shaking me and waking me up. I opened my eyes and saw
Buffy standing over me with a smirk on her face.</p>

<p>"Have a good sleep?" She asked, resting her elbows on the table and
her head in her hands.</p>

<p>"The goodest," I said, making sure I wasn't drooling on myself again.
That happened *one* time and nobody would let me hear the end of
it. "Where is everybody?" The library was empty except for the two of
us. Even Giles, who I was beginning to think lived here, was gone.</p>

<p>"Xander and Willow dragged Giles out of here, kicking and screaming
to get some pizza," she said with a crooked grin.</p>

<p>"Okay," I said, leaning back in my chair and looking at her in
confusion. "So why aren't we with them?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said, straightening up and pulling me with her. "We
promised mom that we'd be back for dinner. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>I followed her out of the library. "Y'know, I think I've been
researching too hard. My brain's melting or something." She looked
back at me like I was shitting her but I just put on my innocent face
until she walked back to me and punched me on the arm. "You keep that
up, B and I might just stop researching all together." She gave a
little groan and dragged me out of there. I don't think she's taking
my threat too seriously. </p>

<p>"Guess what?" She asked excitedly as we walked down the empty hallway.</p>

<p>"Um, they found Snyder dressed like a transvestite and soliciting
himself to some truckers?" I guessed, referring to our new Principal
who looked like a troll and acted like one too.</p>

<p>"No, be serious," Buffy said but I saw that smile creeping onto her
face. "We're going to be spending summer vacation with my dad in LA.
Isn't that great?" </p>

<p>I looked over at her and she had this big, happy grin lighting up her
face. "We?" </p>

<p>"Yeah," she said, her smile faltering a bit. "Don't you want to go?"</p>

<p>"It's not that, B. You know I'd love to go with you. I mean, can you
imagine me spending vacation here without you? I think I'd go crazy
by the first day." She shot me another bright smile. "But...I don't
know. Does your dad want me there? I haven't even really met the guy."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Don't worry about it. He really wants to meet
you and anyway, you two will love each other. He's just as goofy as
you are."</p>

<p>"I'm not goofy."</p>

<p>"Uh huh." She turned her head away and I'm sure she's smirking at me
right now.</p>

<p>"I'm not," I said again and I definitely heard some kind of a chuckle
that time. "So, who are you going to take to the dance?" Really nice
segue there, Faith. Could I sound like more of a dork? Shit.</p>

<p>Buffy whipped her head around to look at me again. "Dance?" She
looked like someone had flashed her. "The dance next week?"</p>

<p>"That'd be the one...I was just wondering cause I wanted to know who
the lucky guy was." That wasn't exactly true. I wanted to find out so
I could threaten to break every bone in his body if he tried doing
anything that Buffy wasn't ready for, which, if it were up to me
would be anything beyond holding hands.</p>

<p>She shrugged as her eyes wandered down to the floor. "I wasn't going
to go."</p>

<p>"What? C'mon B. I know there must be a bunch of guys that must have
asked you."</p>

<p>"A couple," she admitted. "But it's just so hard to relate to them.
We live in the same town but we might as well be living in different
worlds. I mean, what can I talk to them about? The kind of demon I
slayed last night? Whether it had two eyes or three? I don't think
that applies as polite, after dinner conversation in the normal
world. And the only two guys who know about that other side of my
life are Giles and Xander. Just thinking about going to a dance with
either one of them makes me want to go ewwww."</p>

<p>"I don't know, B. I think Giles is pretty hot for an old guy." She
made a face at me. "But seriously, I can't let you skip out on the
fun just because we can't find you a decent date in this dipshit
town."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" She asked, squinting at me.</p>

<p>"I'm saying..." I took a deep breath. Here goes nothing. "We can just
go to the dance together."</p>

<p>"Is that your roundabout way of asking me to the dance with you?" She
asked with a teasing grin.</p>

<p>I matched her grin for grin. "Is that your roundabout way of
accepting to go to the dance with me?" She tapped a finger on her
chin and looked around thoughtfully for a minute. "C'mon, B, stop
jerking me around." She finally turned towards me again, a wide grin
spreading across her face and the word 'yes' slipping from her mouth.</p>

<p>Once word got around that we were going to the dance together, there
were immediate plans made to doll us up all nice and fancy. Mostly
plans made by mom and Red who got way too excited about it if you
asked me. They dragged us off to some hoity toity dress shop on
Saturday and made me try on about a dozen dresses with all the
appropriate ooh's and ahh's in between. I don't think I've actually
worn a dress since I was six but that was for a funeral so I don't
think it counted. It felt strange to be trying on so many different
ones now all of a sudden and having to twirl and pose in front of
people. I finally just put my foot down and told them that if they
didn't just pick one, I was outta there cause this was just insane. </p>

<p>So I ended up with a strapless, black dress, cut low but not too
low. "Classy" was the word Willow used. I looked over at Buffy who
was just staring at me. "B?" Her eyes dragged themselves up until
they focused on my face. "What d'ya think?" She nodded and kept
nodding until I walked back into the dressing room. For some reason,
as soon as they'd picked out a dress for me, they almost pushed me
out the door. But I wasn't going to complain cause I didn't want to
sit through another hour of dress shopping even if Buffy were going
to be the one modeling this time.</p>

<p>By the time they came home two hours later, I was halfway through a
big bag of potato chips and a 2-liter bottle of soda. Red came in
with a big grin on her face. "What's up with you?" I asked, stuffing
another chip in my mouth.</p>

<p>"Nothing." The way she said it made me do a double take. </p>

<p>"You're hiding something," I said, staring at her. She started
squirming uncomfortably and that's when I knew it was something big.
But before I could grill her about it, Buffy came galloping
downstairs, hopping over the back of the couch and taking the chips
from out of my hand.</p>

<p>"Aren't athletes supposed to be health conscious?" At least that's
what I think she said. Wasn't too sure with her mouth stuffed like
that.</p>

<p>"And who told you I was an athlete?" I asked, grabbing the bag back.</p>

<p>"You're meet is tomorrow, right Faith?" Red asked from her
seat. "We'll be right there in the stands cheering for you. Xander
even has some homemade signs."</p>

<p>I tried not to wince but failed miserably. "Whoopee," I said drily,
glaring as Buffy stole the chips again.</p>

<p>After dinner, Buffy and me went out patrolling through the usual
vampire haunts. We were supposed to meet up with Xander and Willow
for some Bronzing as soon as we got done but it was so dead around
town tonight that we were going to cut it short. Buffy was twirling
her stake around in her hand as she explained the many ways in which
she thought Snyder was out to get her.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you," she was saying. "He has some personal agenda
against me. It's like every time he sees me, he gives me this
*look*." She squints her eyes up and squares her jaw, tilting her
chin up slightly trying to impersonate the *look*. "And I know he's
just thinking up more evil ways in his tiny, reptile brain to make
school a living hell for me." </p>

<p>I chuckled at her attempt at an impersonation. "Anybody ever tell you
you're paranoid? Snyder has it in for everybody."</p>

<p>She was just about to reply when she clamped her mouth shut again and
looked all around in that way that I've come to be way too familiar
with. There was some kind of baddie nearby and those hyper Slayer
senses of hers have just kicked in. Even though Buffy can usually
handle it solo, I take out my stake just to be on the safe side. But
the only baddie that steps out of the shadows like he was one himself
was Angel. Did I ever tell you that I didn't like this guy? That's
not exactly right --- I *hate* this guy. It's either the way he
slinks around like he has something to hide or the way he acts so
much like stalker guy around Buffy. Either way, this guy grates on me
like sandpaper.</p>

<p>He stands there looking at the two of us with this brooding, tortured
expression. Shit, doesn't this guy have any other look or would that
stress his facial muscles too much? </p>

<p>"I need to talk to you," he says, looking at Buffy. I roll my eyes. I
can't help it. Every friggin time he shows up, it's always to see
Buffy to talk about this demon or that monster or whatever. It's
obvious he's just jonesing for a little Slayer quality time. But if
he thinks I'm going to leave and give him some alone time, he doesn't
know me too well. I stand there as he gives his latest report about
the happenings around the Hellmouth, otherwise known as Sunnydale,
and then leaves, disappearing back into the shadows.</p>

<p>"That guy creeps me out," I said, not caring if he heard from where
ever dark little place he'd taken himself off to.</p>

<p>Buffy raises her eyebrow at me and smirks. "Don't think I haven't
noticed how you roll your eyes every time he drops by."</p>

<p>"I was that obvious?" I grinned with satisfaction. "Good."</p>

<p>Buffy gave me an exasperated look before pulling me in the direction
of the Bronze.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>My stomach was twisting around so much that it was like I was out
there on the track instead of Faith. Obviously, the late night
yesterday hadn't hurt her because she'd already won the 200 meter
race without even looking like she'd broken a sweat. I'd actually had
to physically drag her home from the Bronze even though she insisted
that midnight was just way too early to leave. Xander raised the
homemade sign he'd promised, cheering like a maniac as Faith lined up
for the last race she was scheduled for --- the mile. Mom and Willow
clapped excitedly next to me. I was too nervous to cheer. My hands
were clenched tight in my lap as my eyes fixed on Faith's figure.</p>

<p>She looked so focused. Her eyes were staring straight ahead, her body
rigid before exploding into motion as the starter's gun went off. I
watched almost mesmerized as she took the lead from the start and
never looked back. When all the other girls were bunched up into a
group, struggling for position, she was pulling further and further
ahead, like she was running against something that only she could
see, nipping at her heels and chasing her ever faster. It was a
forgone conclusion when she finally crossed the finish line in first
place. The first thing she did was look up, searching the stands. And
when her eyes settled over the four of us, she beamed, her smile wide
and victorious.</p>

<p>We all made our way down and enveloped her in a group hug as we all
told her how proud we were of her. We finally had to let go when they
called her up to receive her trophy but when the ceremony was done,
the group hug was back on until Coach Foster took Faith aside for
some words of her own. I hid a smirk behind one hand when I saw Faith
wincing as the Coach enthusiastically slapped her on the back a
couple of times. She was just about to jog back when the ground began
doing something it doesn't normally do. I felt it through the soles
of my shoes, at first just a slight trembling which quickly changed
to a violent shaking. It lasted less than a minute and when it seemed
like it was finally over, everyone began picking themselves up from
where they'd been thrown, astonished that something like that had
happened out of the blue.</p>

<p>Luckily, nobody seemed to have gotten any serious injuries. Just a
lot of bruises and scrapes. After all the excitement passed, we all
piled into mom's car and drove home for a celebratory pizza party
slash post earthquake party and somehow that turned into a
competition of who could eat the most slices of pie by Faith and
Xander. Faith won of course. She's like a bottomless pit when it
comes to food, especially after she's done something strenuous like
run beforehand. Mom muttered something about us eating her out of
house and home before taking off for the gallery because she still
had to catalogue some new shipment of antiques she'd just gotten.
Before she left, she gave us strict instructions to pick up all of
the doodads that had been knocked over by the quake.</p>

<p>And that left the four of us hanging out at the house which was nice
because, for once, we didn't have some dire demon situation hanging
over us like a cloud --- at least not too dire. Nothing that couldn't
be left till Monday to figure out anyway. I walked into the kitchen
for a drink, the conversation between Willow and Faith about why Fred
and Daphne from the Scooby Doo cartoon always left to 'investigate'
things together following me out of the room. I was rooting through
the refrigerator when Xander's voice interrupted.</p>

<p>"Hey Buff," he said, walking into the kitchen. "Do you have any more
of that artificially sweetened, made from concentrate fruit punch I
adore so much in there?" </p>

<p>I popped back up with another bottle. "You're in luck. This is the
last one." As I handed it to him, our fingers inadvertently grazed
and he almost dropped the juice.</p>

<p>"Uh, thanks," he said, recovering. </p>

<p>I turned back around, pretending that I was still looking for
something. Way before I'd decided to go to the dance with Faith,
Xander had asked me. At first, I didn't know what he was talking
about because he was stuttering so much. When I finally figured out
that he was trying to ask me out, I almost didn't know how to handle
the situation. Here was a real good friend of mine who I'd never
thought of in any other way *but* as a friend, asking me to go out on
a date with him. In hindsight, I guess he must have had crushy
feelings towards me from the start but I'd just never noticed, or
never *let* myself notice. In the back of my mind, I must have hoped
it would blow over. But obviously it hadn't. I'd given him the speech
about how I only saw him as a friend and he'd cut me off halfway
saying he understood. But no matter what he says or how much he
might 'understand', I know you can't just turn your feelings off
because someone doesn't return those feelings. So now, even though I
hate that it's there, there's an awkwardness that surfaces between
the two of us from time to time. I turn back towards him and we
smile, not a comfortable smile, not even a very believable one, but
we smile because we're friends.</p>

<p>I followed him out of the kitchen, squeezing in between Faith and the
armrest of the couch, putting the can of soda in her hands.</p>

<p>"Thanks, B," she says absentmindedly, still focused on the
conversation she was having with Willow. She's so cute when she's
having a serious discussion even if that serious discussion is about
the sexual predilections of two cartoon characters. I scrunch up my
brows because, now that I think about it, that is just too weird.</p>

<p>She turns towards me suddenly, a question lighting her face. "You
agree with me, right, B?" I don't even know what I'm supposed to be
agreeing with but I couldn't have said no if my life depended on it.
Willow protested from where she was sitting, mad that I was taking
sides and I shrug sheepishly because, in effect, I was.</p>

<p>Later that night as I was lying on my stomach on Faith's bed, staring
at the two huge trophies she'd left standing on the floor, I vaguely
wondered if mom would be lonely staying in Sunnydale all by herself
during summer break. I'd wanted her to come to LA with us but she had
insisted that she had way too much work left to do at the gallery for
her to take any time off. And thinking about summer left me thinking
about dad. I'd spoken with him on the telephone at least once a week
since coming to Sunnydale. I was really excited to spend two months
with him and even more excited to introduce him to Faith. I smiled
just planning everything out in my head because I wanted the summer
to be perfect.</p>

<p>Faith walked through the door just then, pink and clean from the
shower and I smiled even wider as she walked over and sat on the edge
of the bed. </p>

<p>"What are you thinking?" I asked, watching her stare thoughtfully at
the two trophies on the floor.</p>

<p>She turned her head, smirking. "I was just thinking that if I won
anymore of those damn things, I wouldn't be able to walk into my own
room without tripping."</p>

<p>"Aren't we confident?" I asked, teasing her gently.</p>

<p>She gave me a smug grin and slipped into bed as I made room for
her. "If you got it, flaunt it as I always say." </p>

<p>It just seemed natural to stay here even though my room was right
across the hall, just a couple of steps away. But why would I want to
do that if I'm already so comfortable right where I was? It wouldn't
make sense, I thought as I wrapped myself around Faith's side.
Invariably, my fingers started tracing the small, circular scar on
her right bicep. It was either that or the tribal tattoo which was
also on her right arm. Both fascinated me but for different reasons.
The tattoo was like Faith herself --- bold and unapologizing. Its
design, a jagged vine, winding around her arm, almost like it
belonged there and had been there forever. She told me she got it
awhile back by a friend who was training to be a tattoo artist. </p>

<p>The scar, on the other hand, fascinated me for the exact reason that
it looked like it didn't belong. Because it looked so out of place
and it felt so out of place as my fingers ran lightly over it. The
only time I'd asked how she'd gotten the scar, Faith had moved her
arm away and said that she didn't want to talk about it. I haven't
asked since then but I still like touching it just to feel it
contrasting with the smooth, perfect skin surrounding it on all
sides. </p>

<p>I fell asleep still playing with it and I knew I was dreaming the
minute it hit me. But this wasn't any old dream. It was strange, too
real, too sharp but with that displaced quality about everything that
told me that it was still a dream. I pulled up from the bed, glancing
beside me to see that Faith was asleep. Somehow, I knew I wasn't
supposed to wake her, that she wasn't supposed to be involved so I
slipped out of bed, automatically heading towards the bathroom.
There, in the mirror, I saw myself. But I didn't look right. I was
too pale, too sick. I turned on the faucet, hoping that a cold splash
of water would help me look more like myself but there was no water,
only blood as it coursed out of the pipes, staining the white sink
red.</p>

<p>That's when I woke up.</p>

<p>"You look like shit, B." I glanced over at Faith quickly before
flicking my eyes back to the road. </p>

<p>"That's good because I feel kind of like shit too." I'd told her
about the dream. She'd told me not to worry about it but I couldn't
get it out of my mind. As soon as I got to the school, I went
straight to the library hoping that Giles could tell me more about
it. I saw that he still had some cleaning up to do since the quake
seemed to have overturned a few shelves of books. I just hope he
didn't expect me, feeling the way I am, to help too much in that area.</p>

<p>I didn't see Giles immediately but I heard his voice coming out of
the office. I walked towards his door, my mouth already open,
preparing to form his name when something he said caught my attention
and the words froze on my tongue. I looked through the door, his back
was to me, talking on the phone. </p>

<p>"There's no way around it as far as I can tell...Yes, the signs all
point to it. Everything written in the Codex is coming true, only the
last leg of the Prophecy remains..." He ran a hand through his hair
in agitation. "I've gone over it and over it but it's very clear.
Buffy will face the Master Vampire when he rises a-and, she will
die." </p>

<p>I felt like the ground had dropped out from under me. His words were
still ringing in my ears as he turned around, a look of shock coming
into his face when he saw me standing there. I idly wondered if it
mirrored my own at the moment. "I'll call you back," he quickly said,
hanging up.</p>

<p>"When were you planning on telling me?" My voice sounded strange to
my own ears. </p>

<p>"I had to make sure," he said, his eyes pleading for me to
understand. "To make sure that there were no other interpretations--"</p>

<p>"So that's it?!" I nearly shouted. How? This couldn't be happening.
How could my life end on the say so of a book? "Some stupid book says
I'm going to die and I'm supposed to just lay down and take it?" </p>

<p>"N-no, of course not." He took off his glasses, rubbing his eyes
wearily. "But--"</p>

<p>"But nothing!" I interrupt again. "You're not the Slayer. You don't
risk your life every night going out there and fighting monsters. No,
you stick your nose in some book and call it helping me. Well how are
you going to help me now, Giles?! Are you going to fight him for me?"
All he could do was look at me with a sadness in his eyes. "No, of
course not. I have to fight this myself, right? It's all up to me or
the world's going to end and people are going to die." I turned
around and walked out. I couldn't look at him anymore, couldn't
listen to him preach about how it was my destiny because, right now,
I could care less about destiny. I was seventeen years old. I just
didn't want to die.</p>

<p>I ran out to the parking lot and jumped into my car, thoughts of
running away swirling through my mind. I felt like banging my head
against the steering wheel because there was no way I could run away.
Not when the Master was about to rise. Not when everyone I loved
would be put in danger because I was too much of a coward to face up
to him. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know how to act so I
started the car and drove, hoping that would clear my mind. </p>

<p>I don't know how long I drove. I don't know how long it'd been since
I'd parked in this lot and just sat here staring outside the
windshield at the minimart. I don't know how long until there was a
tapping on the driver's side window and I looked up to see a vampire
standing outside, a placid look on his monstrous face. I don't know
how long I had sat there but as I peered out at my would-be escort, I
knew I couldn't stay there any longer. So I climbed out and followed
because this was more than my job. This was my duty, my
responsibility.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I walked behind Angel with a flashlight in my hand as we walked
through the tunnel. I wanted to yell at him to hurry up cause every
second we wasted was a second that Buffy was by herself. A second
that could mean the Master had already broken free, had already
killed her. My throat started seizing up at the thought. No, Buffy
couldn't die no matter what Giles said. Him and his stupid prophecy
could both go to hell along with everyone else as long as Buffy was
okay. He hadn't even bothered to tell me what was going on until I'd
walked through the library at the end of school and asked where Buffy
was. Then he'd broken down. Then he'd told me.</p>

<p>And now we were all following Angel through this tunnel because he
was the only one who knew where the Master was --- where Buffy was. I
had no doubt she'd be there already cause that was so like her. She
wouldn't have been able to live with herself if she didn't try to
stop him from rising. She would have risked her life to protect the
rest of us. And when I found her, I'd tell her what a crazy bitch I
thought she was before I'd hug her and hold her to me and never, ever
let go again.</p>

<p>A light glowed at the end of the tunnel and all of us tensed, knowing
that this was it. This was the bastard's lair. Xander and Giles were
behind me. Angel was one step in front of me and Buffy was on the
other side. I knew it in my gut. I ran forward, slipping past Angel's
outstretched hand and heading straight towards the light. And as I
ran, it was like my body was rearranging itself, shifting, changing.
I didn't know what was happening and I didn't care cause when I came
out, I saw Buffy, lying facedown in a shallow pool of water. My world
turned dark as I dimly watched Angel rushing in and tackling the
vampires who were just about to attack me. I watched as Xander and
Giles ran in after him, pulling Buffy's lifeless body out of the
water. I watched as they turned her face, looking for any signs that
she was alive and seeing nothing. Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>And then I heard the laughter. The laughter, grating on my every
nerve, coming from behind me. I turned and saw him. The murderer ---
the one who'd taken Buffy away from me --- the one I was going to
kill with my bare hands. I ran at him and I punched and I kicked and
I ignored the dull pain as he hit me back cause nothing he could do
could hurt me anymore than I already was. I didn't stop my fists or
my feet until my stake was in my hands and I'd rammed it into his
chest. I was kneeling there, breathing hard and looking at the bloody
skeleton he'd become when I heard my name. </p>

<p>The voice was unmistakable but it couldn't be true. I turned around
slowly, wanting it to be true so badly that every part of me ached
for it. My eyes found hers and I choked on the sob rising in my
throat. She walked towards me on shaky legs and kneeled in front of
me. My Buffy. I did what I swore I'd do. "You fucking, crazy bitch."
My voice was hoarse, torn. I grab her and hold her to me, feeling her
warmth, her life, her breath and I held on until I wasn't shaking
anymore, until everything started getting black.</p>

<p>They tell me I fainted. That's the first time that ever happened to
me...ever. I can't say I liked the whole experience either. Cause,
for one thing, I missed out on all the great shit that happened next.
Buffy tells me they cleaned out the rest of the vamp nest and took me
home. Okay, maybe it wasn't such great shit after all but I still
missed it. What with them bringing me back unconscious and all, I
still don't know what inventive bullshit they came up with to get
pass mom. I woke up sometime around four in the morning, felt Buffy
snuggled up against me and fell right back to sleep cause I knew
everything would be all right now.</p>

<p>It wasn't like either one of us wanted to go to school that day but
there was stuff that needed clearing up cause if you think about it,
there ain't no way I could've taken down that freaking Master Vamp by
myself. Giles who looked all nervous and wouldn't even look me in the
eye most of the time I was there, told me in a roundabout 'why-won't-
you-get-to-the-point?' way that I was now a Slayer.</p>

<p>"Say what?" I just stared at him. I mean, how could I be a Slayer?
This had to be a weak-ass joke, right?</p>

<p>"It's true," he says, playing with a book in his hands. "During that
whole episode, Buffy was technically dead, albeit for a few seconds
before Xander was able to revive her. So, another Slayer was called
in her place even though she's still very much alive."</p>

<p>I looked over at Buffy and she shrugs at me as if to say this didn't
make sense to her either. "All right, fine," I say to Giles. "But why
me? Did you know it was going to be me?" I ask suspiciously.</p>

<p>He kept playing with the book as if that would help him think
better. "Not exactly."</p>

<p>"Then what exactly?"</p>

<p>"You were a potential Slayer," he said, blowing out a soft
breath. "Along with dozens of others. We didn't know if you would
actually be the next called, only that you were a possibility."</p>

<p>I didn't know whether to be pissed or relieved. If I hadn't
been 'called' right then, everybody could have died, including Buffy.
And now, I've got all these cool new super powers but after you get
pass that, then comes the responsibility part, the duty part, the
destiny part, the part that sucks. Not to mention that I think Giles
should've told me about the possibility I'd be a Slayer and come out
with it before it actually happened. I sat there a few more seconds
before I got up and left. Buffy came out after me like I knew she
would and stopped me as I was opening my locker.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" She asks.</p>

<p>Was I? "Not mad," I said, grinning weakly at her. "Just a little
pissed that he didn't tell me anything about it before." I looked
back towards the hallway and narrowed my eyes just thinking about
it. "Was it that hard for him to mention it? Give me a warning, a
wink-wink, something?"</p>

<p>She leaned her shoulder against the bank of lockers and tilted her
head, staring in that patient way she always does at me. "You know
Giles. He's this totally English, by the book, research is the only
solution, and did I mention English, Watcher and he has to answer to
the Council who are even more English and by the book than he is. But
I know he cares for all of us even if he doesn't openly show it. I
know, at the end of the day, he's only doing what he thinks is the
best for us."</p>

<p>Now how was I supposed to argue against that? "You've gotta at least
give me a couple of days to get over being pissed," I said, giving
into the logic with a mock exasperated look.</p>

<p>"I think I can do that," she said, walking me down to my class which
I was already late for. When we got there, we loitered outside until
she finally said, "Why don't we just skip this period? We're already
incredibly late anyway. No point in disturbing the class with our
intrusion."</p>

<p>I smiled broadly at her, won over by her logic yet again. "What do
you have in mind, B?"</p>

<p>"Early lunch?" She suggested with a quirked eyebrow and a dancing
smile of her own.</p>

<p>We never did make it to the rest of our classes that day. It was just
too much fun hanging out with Buffy to ever even think about going
back to listen to some stupid lecture again. We'd both survived death
yesterday and I guess we were still getting off the high, the relief.
During the rest of that afternoon, sometimes, I found myself looking
over at her and wondering how it was that I could've lost her so
easily --- that I might never have seen her face, her smile, her eyes
looking at me as if I were the only person in the world. And that's
when I know that I'll take all the responsibility, all the duty, and
all the bullshit Giles can dish out at me just so I can be there for
her, watching her back, making sure that nothing like that will even
come close to happening again. And, of course, during those times,
she looks over at me with a gentle smile on her lips, almost as if
she knows what I'm thinking. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm reading more into it than there was but that's the same
smile I see on her lips three days later when she walks down the
stairs, absolutely, hands down the most beautiful girl I've ever
seen. I was standing there, my mouth hanging open as she walked down
wearing a deep blue dress, so blue, it was almost black. It draped
her body and showed off just what an incredible figure she had and
her hair was done up with a silver tiara or headband holding it in
place. </p>

<p>She looked like something out of a fairy tale.</p>

<p>"Oh, wow, B..." That was about all I could get out before mom came in
with a camera, making sure to record this Kodak moment for posterity
before shooing us out the door with the advice that we have fun. I
kept slipping her looks all through the drive to the school. My eyes
just seemed to wander over whenever the rest of me wasn't paying
attention and that was every few minutes. I'm sure she noticed. How
could she not notice the way I'm gawking at her. But she doesn't say
anything.</p>

<p>When we get to the dance, Xander and Red come right up to us. Xander
was almost creaming down on the floor himself when he saw us but the
boy wasn't that bad looking himself. He was almost respectable in his
black tux and bow tie. Red was in a white number that managed to show
off a bit of flesh which for her was pretty risqu. Giles was off to
the side acting as a chaperone. Him and me had made up over the last
couple of days. It wasn't like we apologized to each other, we didn't
sit down and have a heart to heart about our problems --- he wasn't
Buffy for Christsakes. But after I showed up for training one
afternoon, everything was basically cool from then on.</p>

<p>The one time my eyes weren't on Buffy, I caught sight of Cordelia's
entrance --- fashionably later than everybody else of course and
decked out to the full. She was hot and she knew it. She caught me
looking and gave me a little smirk before turning back to her adoring
public. Even though I'd told Buffy I wasn't going to keep hanging
with Cordy, that wasn't exactly true. We still talked whenever her
snotty friends weren't around. It's just that nobody knew it. It was
just better that way for the both of us.</p>

<p>I felt Buffy tugging at my arm as she led me to the dance floor and
as her arms looped around my neck, I forgot all about Cordy, about
everybody else, I think I even forgot my name. Cause, right then,
there was only Buffy and me dancing to a slow song pumping out of the
speakers. And that's the way it would always be if I had anything to
do about it. Buffy and me. Together. The Chosen Two. Hey, that's
kinda catchy. My arms went around her waist and I pulled her closer
and the word 'forever' kept bumping around in my mind.</p>

<p>Forever? </p>

<p>I smiled. That sounded about right.</p>
