<!-- Senior Daze \ Part 3 -->

<p>"SURPRISE!"</p>

<p>"Oh...you guys shouldn't have," I said, looking around at everyone
assembled in the Bronze. Giles walked up from behind me, having
dutifully delivered me here. I noticed that Oz was here too. Him and
Willow really seemed to have hit it off and they were an undeniably
cute couple. I looked behind Xander and Cordelia who had already
started sniping at each other to see Angel skulking in the
background. He gave me a tentative smile which I returned. "Really
shouldn't have," I quietly muttered to myself.</p>

<p>It had been nearly a week since what I had started labeling"the turn
down" in my mind and it still didn't look like we were ever going to
be comfortable around each other again. We'd spent time with each
other since then but never alone and never making direct eye contact
for more than a few seconds at a time. I knew this was starting to
get out of control. He was my friend. He'd been there for me during a
couple of tough situations and I didn't want this rift dividing us to
the point where we couldn't even look at each other without flinching.</p>

<p>I resolved right then that I would talk to him --- try to make
everything right again, or as right as it could get. I walked towards
him, distracted for a second at the blinding smile Willow was
shooting me. I wondered what she was so happy about but I knew she'd
tell me later.</p>

<p>"Hey," I said, standing in front of Angel. "I'm glad you came."</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to," he said, looking down at his shoes. "I didn't
want to make you feel uncomfortable at your own party." </p>

<p>"Look," I said, glancing around to make sure that nobody was standing
too close to overhear. "I want us to be friends, Angel, like we were
before. And I don't want this...space between us."</p>

<p>"I don't either," he said, finally looking me in the eyes. I was
smiling encouragingly up at him when the Bronze's doors banged open
behind me. I turned around and had to blink a couple of times to make
sure I wasn't hallucinating.</p>

<p>"Faith!" Someone said. I wasn't even sure who.</p>

<p>Faith, because that was definitely who it was, smiled, her eyes
glancing over everyone in the room before finally locking on mine.
She dropped her duffel bag and the box she was holding as she walked
across the room to stand in front of me. </p>

<p>"I, uh, got you this," she said with a small shrug, holding out a
Snickers bar. "It's not much but it's got peanuts...and nougat..."</p>

<p>"And caramel," Xander said from behind her, a wide grin on his own
face.</p>

<p>"Happy Birthday, B," she said softly with a lopsided grin.</p>

<p>My eyes were already unfocused as the tears started welling
up. "Faith," I said, my voice breaking up halfway through. I threw
myself at her, my arms wrapping tightly around her neck as I closed
my eyes tightly.</p>

<p>She held me around the waist as I started crying. And I didn't know
why I was crying either. I was happy. More than happy. I was floating
on cloud nine so why couldn't I stop crying? I finally pulled away
but still clung to her as I looked into her eyes which were red. I
think --- no, I know she was trying not to cry herself.</p>

<p>"How did...when did..." I closed my eyes, trying to compose myself to
ask a simple question.</p>

<p>"I just landed," she said. And I caught her giving Willow a look and
I had an inkling of why my best friend looked like she was the cat
who just ate the canary. "As for the how part, I think we'll have to
sit down for that."</p>

<p>"Well, it's good to have you back," Giles said, giving us an
indulgent smile.</p>

<p>"Heck, yeah," Xander enthused. "The Slaying Duo back together again.
You don't know how much I've missed you, Faith." He put his arms
around the both of us. "I mean, how much *we've* missed you," he
quickly amended. "Especially Buffy."</p>

<p>"Slaying Duo?" Oz asked, quirking an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Danny Boy." Faith greeted him with a wide smile as he nodded back.</p>

<p>"Vampires --- they're real. Faith and Buffy slay them, thus the
name," Xander expounded succinctly as he walked over to stand beside
Cordelia who immediately seemed to shrink away. Everybody began
talking all at once after that so they didn't really notice when I
dragged Faith into the bathroom. As soon as we walked in, I turned
around and hugged her again. Not the bone crushing hug like earlier
but a comforting one, a loving one.</p>

<p>"I've missed you so much," I said, my words muffled as my mouth
pressed against the skin of her neck. She lifted my head up, her lips
finding mine, her mouth hot as her tongue slipped between my lips and
explored every inch of my mouth. It felt like I had waited for this
for a lifetime. I never wanted it to stop but eventually, we had to
separate for air. "I love you," I said with my forehead leaning
against hers.</p>

<p>"I love you too," she said, her voice rasping over the words in a way
that made my stomach twist. She pulled her head back and began wiping
a thumb across my cheek, wiping away the tears.</p>

<p>"I look like a mess," I said, turning to look at my mascara stained
face in the bathroom mirror. I turned on the faucet as I began
cleaning up my face. Faith came up behind me to give me a kiss on the
neck before leaning casually against the frame of a bathroom stall.
Our eyes met several times in the mirror and I couldn't help smiling
every time they did.</p>

<p>"You don't know how glad I am to be back, B." She leaned her head
back to stare up at the ceiling. </p>

<p>"What happened?" I asked, turning around. Before she could answer,
Willow burst through the door.</p>

<p>"Xander's being strangled!" she shouted, her voice strained as she
ran back outside.</p>

<p>I looked over at Faith before rushing outside to see what the
hellmouth had in store for us today. I got outside just in time to
see Angel slamming what looked like a severed arm in armor back into
the box Faith had bought inside with her.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" He asked, looking past me to Faith after
shutting the lid.</p>

<p>"Found it outside. Some vamp was trying to load it onto a truck. I
figured whatever it was, it'd be better off being with me than him."</p>

<p>"You were right," he said, wearing the doom and gloom expression
which always meant evil was afoot. He went on to explain how the arm
belonged to this demon called the Judge whose whole demonic purpose
was to wipe out humanity. Talk about single-minded focus. Some people
must not have agreed with the slash and burn attitude though because
he was later chopped up into chunks and spread throughout the world.
And I didn't have to think too hard to come up with the likely vamps
who were trying to put Mr. Humpty Dumpty back together again after
all this time.</p>

<p>"Looks like Spike and Dru are working on another project," I said
glumly. Much to our dismay, the two love birds hadn't died when the
organ went crashing down on their heads. But apparently, it had hurt
Spike enough that he was spending his nights in a wheelchair now.</p>

<p>"Spike and who?" Faith asked, looking at me with a blank expression.</p>

<p>"Vampires. I'll tell you more about them later." She nodded, seeming
content with that as Angel outlined his plan to stop them from
putting the Judge back together again. Basically, he was going to
board a freighter and take the arm somewhere far away to bury it
which sounded about as good a plan as any. I might have just been
imagining it but before he left, he gave me a meaningful look that I
didn't quite know how to take.</p>

<p>The party pretty much pooped out from there. All I really wanted to
do was take Faith home to mom just to see them back together again.
So around nine, we finally took off. We held hands walking down the
street and it just felt so good to be able to do that. They're right
about not appreciating what you have until it's been taken away from
you and I swore to myself that I wasn't going to take *this*, what we
had together, for granted again because it was too precious.</p>

<p>"So he was a demon?" I asked, after she outlined the bare basics of
what had happened to her after she had left.</p>

<p>"Or a demon worshipper --- one or the other," she said rather
blithely. She had been looking around, her head turning back and
forth like she were at a tennis tournament. She gazed with a sense of
awe as if everything were brand new to her. The streets, the lights,
the stores, even the people. I found it adorable and I told her so.
She grinned back at me and continued observing everything with wide
eyes. When we got back to the house, mom was in the kitchen and she
almost dropped the dish she was cleaning when she saw who was
trailing behind me.</p>

<p>"Faith!" She exclaimed, moving quickly from behind the counter to
wrap her up in a bear hug. She was even happier after she found out
that Faith was here to stay. "But what happened with your mother?"
She asked.</p>

<p>Faith averted her eyes. "We bonded enough to last us both a
lifetime," she said not too convincingly. "Don't worry about it.
She's fine with me being here."</p>

<p>After some fretting by mom about the legal paperwork and needing to
enroll Faith back in school again, the two of us walked upstairs to
get her settled in. I hurried to pick up some of my clothes off the
floor where I'd dumped them the previous night when I was getting
changed. "Sorry," I said, apologizing.</p>

<p>Faith smirked, tossing her duffel bag to the side as she slumped onto
her bed. "Don't worry about it, B. It just makes the place look lived
in." She patted a spot on the mattress beside her for me to sit on
and as I did, she gazed at me for a long moment. "Damn, I missed
you," she finally whispered hoarsely. </p>

<p>My smile quavered slightly as the tears started forming in my eyes
again. Faith pulled me towards her, holding me tightly as we sat on
the bed, rocking slowly back and forth. And I kept thinking that,
despite all the tears, this was hands down the best birthday I'd ever
had.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Fuck, I can't believe we got beaten down by a handicap vamp and a
blue demon." I punched the wall of Angel's apartment, putting a fist
sized hole in the cheap dry wall. I pulled my hand back and shook off
the white dust from my knuckles. The first real action I'd seen since
last summer and it turned out a bust. The Judge-bits had already been
assembled and we didn't even know it until we did some recon on their
hideout/factory and saw it for ourselves. The arm Angel was supposed
to bury far, far away? He got it stolen before he even got a foot out
of Sunnydale. Should've figured you couldn't send a vampire to do a
Slayer's job. </p>

<p>Then I noticed that Buffy was shaking wet on Angel's bed and the
anger I was feeling so strongly just a second before just left like
it had never been burning at all. I walked over, sat down and pulled
her close. "Are you okay?" I whispered. Not only had we gotten our
asses kicked, we'd had to trudge through the sewers and a rainstorm
to get here.</p>

<p>"Yeah, just a little...ugh," she winced, doubling over as she tried
to flex her back. I caught her immediately as Angel sat down on the
other side of her, a worried look on his face.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's the matter?" I asked, lifting the back of her shirt up
to see. I hissed softly as I saw the blood oozing slowly out of the
wound on her back, right next to her spine. "Shit, you have any
bandages?" I asked, looking over at Angel.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I ran out."</p>

<p>I sighed, wondering if this night could get any worse. "I'll be right
back," I said, getting up. When Buffy shot out a hand to hold me
back, I gave her a comforting grin. "Five minutes," I told her,
letting myself out of the apartment.</p>

<p>I ran outside, back into the rain cause apparently, Angel didn't have
an umbrella either. I guess he liked getting sopping wet or maybe he
was one of those sensitive guys who enjoyed long walks in the rain.
But I didn't and by the time I walked into the drugstore, I was in a
pretty pissed off mood and it didn't help that the guy behind the
counter kept looking at me the whole time I was in there like he
expected me to jack his entire store if he tuned his back for one
second. I almost felt obliged to lift something just to meet his
expectations but I just plopped down some bandages, antiseptic, and
chips for myself, paid for it and left.</p>

<p>I ran all the way back to the apartment with the bag of stuff under
my jacket so it wouldn't get wet and I was at the door, all set to
knock when I remembered that I hadn't locked it when I left. So I
turned the knob, pushed the door in and almost felt my heart actually
being ripped out of my chest when I saw my girlfriend kissing another
guy.</p>

<p>The bag dropped from my hands and hit the floor with a soft thud and
they both looked at me. Angel had been kneeling on the floor, his
back turned towards me. Buffy was still sitting on the bed but she
shot straight up when she saw me standing in the doorway. I noticed
in a slight daze that she looked like she'd hurt herself again from
the sudden movement but call me a bitch for not caring at the moment.</p>

<p>I could've blown up, probably did some damage in the process but it
just didn't seem worth it. All I wanted to do was to get away from
them, from the words they were both saying that my brain refused to
understand. They both sounded like they had cotton stuffed in their
mouths or maybe it was more like I had cotton stuffed in my ears.
Whatever. I turned around and walked off, back into the beating rain
that didn't seem so bad anymore.</p>

<p>Buffy came running after me, coming to stand right in front of me so
I couldn't even slink away like I wanted to.</p>

<p>"Faith, it's not what it looked like...it just happened."</p>

<p>It would've been fine if she'd just let me go. But fuck no. She *had*
to give me that lame excuse, the one that just absolutely broke
whatever dam was holding me back from doing something violent for the
sake of doing something violent. A sound between a scream and
guttural growl came out of my mouth as I pushed her, sending her
stumbling and falling hard onto the ground. But I wasn't even done
yet. Not by half. I ran up next to her and kicked her in the ribs,
hearing her cry out as she rolled away. I followed her and I had no
doubt in my mind that I was about to kick her again when Angel
blindsided me, running into me from the side and sending us both
rolling on the ground.</p>

<p>We came up, crouched and facing off. His game face was on and he
looked like he really wanted to beat the shit out of me. I kinda felt
like doing the same thing --- beat myself up, that is. I looked off
to the side where Buffy was just now getting up, a hand clutching her
side and I felt like throwing up. But I forced the nausea aside and
stood up from the crouch. I couldn't look at her. I couldn't look at
him either cause I didn't know if I could control myself if I did.</p>

<p>So I walked away again. I walked through the rain. I walked through
the cold. I walked until I was in front of the house I'd thought of
as home for the last year. All I was going to do was pack up some of
my stuff and leave. I didn't know where I would go or what I would
do, I just knew I had to leave. But soon as I walked through the
door, mom called out my name and said she needed to talk to me. I
looked longingly up the stairs and left a trail of water along the
floor as I walked into the living room. Strangely enough, that really
depressed the hell outta me, messing her house up like that and I
wondered if I should mop it up or something before I left.</p>

<p>"Faith, what happened?" She asked, running over to me as soon as she
took one look at my sorry dripping ass. </p>

<p>"I forgot my umbrella." My lips moved but the cold made the words
come out sounding slurred. She left the room and came back with a
towel that she used to wrap around me. When she asked if I was all
right, I nodded but I couldn't meet her eyes. I couldn't move my eyes
up past her waist and when she sat me down on the couch, I stared
down at the floor. She didn't say anything for a minute and I just
wanted to tell her to hurry up so I could get out of her house before
she was forced to kick me out.</p>

<p>"Faith," she finally said in a tentative voice. "I received a letter
today. It's from...Howard?"</p>

<p>I pulled the towel tighter around me. "Yeah?" </p>

<p>"It says, among other things that they've set up a trust fund for
you." I didn't say anything, waiting for her to finish whatever she
had to say. "It's ten million dollars," she said in an unbelieving
voice. I wasn't sure how she thought I'd react but I guess sitting on
my ass, dripping all over her sofa and not saying peep wasn't what
she was expecting. "Faith, did you hear what I said?" Yeah, I heard
what she said. I also heard the thread of excitement that had come
into her voice when she announced it. When I still didn't react, she
took an envelope off the coffee table and put it on my lap. "They
also said they're going to give you a weekly allowance until your
twenty-first birthday...it's a thousand dollars a week." My eyes
wandered slowly to the white envelope on my lap but I made no move to
pick it up. "Honey, are you all right?" She asked, putting a warm arm
around my shoulders and making me feel sick again with the concern in
her voice.</p>

<p>I almost pushed her away from me when the sound of the front door
opening made me jump up instead, the envelope caught before it
dropped on the floor. I tossed the towel on the sofa and walked out
of the living room almost running into Buffy who was just standing
there, looking miserable shaking in her soaked through jacket.</p>

<p>My eyes flicked over her and then I was climbing up the stairs, in my
room and shoving clothes back into my duffel bag.</p>

<p>"Faith, listen to me," she was saying before she was even in the
room. "There's nothing between me and Angel."</p>

<p>I lifted up my bag and tried to push past her but she wouldn't move.
Instead, she slammed the door closed behind her and tried placing her
hands on me.</p>

<p>"Don't, okay?" I said, backing up immediately. "Just don't fucking
touch me." I kept my eyes off to the side and stood there, gripping
and re-gripping the strap in my hand.</p>

<p>"I know you're mad at me but please don't leave..."</p>

<p>I barked out laughter I didn't feel as I tossed my bag against the
wall. I didn't miss the flinch she tried to hold back either as the
bag hit with a thump. "Mad at you, B?" I asked, my voice coming out
strained and thin. "You have absolutely no idea what I'm feeling
right now so don't even try to say you understand because that's
bullshit."</p>

<p>"And you don't know how I feel!" She shouted back, tears brimming in
her eyes. We stared at each other, frozen in the tension and just
when I thought the situation was close to exploding, there was a
knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Girls? Are you all right in there?" Came the worried question.</p>

<p>"We're fine mom," Buffy answered tersely, her eyes remaining on me.
There was a silence and then I heard her footsteps going back
downstairs. As soon as she was gone, Buffy said, "If you're not going
to stay for me, stay for mom."</p>

<p>I didn't say anything, staring at her so hard that I thought for a
second I'd stare a hole through her. But no hole miraculously
appeared and she didn't hurt, not like I did. As she shifted slightly
under my gaze, I turned around and sat down on my bed, keeping my
eyes straight ahead, staring at a wall rather than her. She stood
there for a few more seconds before quietly leaving my room, closing
the door softly behind her. As soon as she left, my head fell back
against the wall and my body went limp as everything that had
happened that night came crashing down on top of me all at once.</p>

<p>I'd thought...I'd hoped that when I came back, everything would still
be the same as when I'd left. And it had looked that way for awhile
but then *this* had to happen. </p>

<p>Angel.</p>

<p>The thought of that fucking bastard made my fists clench up and my
teeth grate together. What the fuck did he think he was? He wasn't
human. He was a *vampire*. And he wanted to do it with a Slayer? He
wanted Buffy?</p>

<p>I sat there for God knows how long, my anger flaring and fading as my
thoughts wandered all over the place until my body finally shivered
violently, reminding me that I was still dressed in wet clothes which
were not only wet but cold as ice too. I struggled, trying to take
off the clothes which were plastered to my skin. By the time I had
everything off, I was so wiped that I just fell onto the bed and with
one arm, dragged the covers over my body, waiting a few minutes for
the shivers to go away.</p>

<p>I woke up three times during the night. The last time was around four
in the morning. When I actually *had* to wake up though, I was bone
tired. I got washed and dressed, still somewhere between Never Never
land and the real world, wandering around in my own haze. But before
I left my room, I remembered the envelope that mom had given me the
night before and I took it out of the bag I'd stuffed it into and
looked inside. There were ten hundred dollar bills inside the
envelope and, if I weren't feeling so out of it, I would have taken a
second look before pocketing it.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I stopped at a red light and glanced briefly over at Faith who had
spent the entire ride staring out the side window and pointedly
ignoring me. Ever since she'd come down in the morning, it had been
the silent treatment and aside from a few words to mom, she didn't
say another word. I knew mom probably figured out there was something
wrong between us but I was glad she didn't push it. My eyes felt
tired like I'd been crying all night but that was mostly because I
had been.</p>

<p>"Fa--"</p>

<p>"Stop, right now with whatever you're going to say," she said as soon
as I opened my mouth. She was still staring out the window as she
continued speaking. "What we had between us --- that's gone and I
really don't want to try and patch it up again cause it's only going
to be a house of cards waiting for the next stiff wind to come and
knock it down. I should've stuck with my old philosophy --- get some,
get gone. It's a lot simpler that way. But fuck it, let's just get to
school and pretend like nothing happened, all right?"</p>

<p>I sat there, trying to come up with something to say but the honking
of a car horn startled me into starting the car again. I drove for a
few feet before pulling over to the side. "Faith, listen to me." I
grabbed her arm, turning her to face me even as she tried to shrug me
off. "Faith, I love you. I love you," I repeated again.</p>

<p>She finally turned to glare at me, looking as if she wanted to yell
but when she opened her mouth, her voice was a harsh whisper. "Fuck,
I'd hate to see what you'd do if you hated me."</p>

<p>There was so much anger in her eyes that I almost flinched. "I'm
sorry." The words sounded so inadequate that I did flinch then. I
reviewed last night in my mind and I didn't know what I had been
thinking. I should've pushed him away faster, told him beforehand
that nothing could ever happen between us but now it was too late.
He'd surprised me. One minute he was getting me more towels, the next
minute he was kneeling on the ground telling me he couldn't stop
himself from loving me. He'd looked so vulnerable and hurt and...it
was just supposed to be a comforting kiss...</p>

<p>"I believe you, B," she said, her lips twisting into a cruel
smile. "I just don't give a shit." I turned away, feeling the tears
building up again. "Now can we please get to the school already? I'm
gonna be late for class." </p>

<p>I swallowed the lump in my throat and started up the car again. The
rest of the morning, I spent it walking around in a daze. Somehow,
things had turned out terribly, horribly wrong and it was probably
all my fault. It *was* all my fault. And somehow, I had to fix it
because I was not going to let Faith go without a fight. When lunch
rolled around, I went to the library, remembering that I had promised
to check in with Giles and the others last night. Unfortunately, I
only remembered just now and I hoped I hadn't made them worry too
much. I didn't need something else to add to the list of stuff which
I had messed up.</p>

<p>But when I opened the door, nobody looked too distressed. Willow,
Xander, Cordelia, Giles and Faith, all gathered in the room like we'd
done this a hundred times before and we probably had. "Ah, Buffy,"
Giles said, looking up from a book. "Are you all right? Faith relayed
to us what happened last night." </p>

<p>I looked over at Faith who was slouched in a chair at the big table,
staring at its surface. "I'm fine," I said, walking next to the table
and making a concerted effort to concentrate on business. "So what
are we going to do about the Judge? I couldn't even touch him without
hurting."</p>

<p>"That's interesting," he commented, taking off his glasses and
staring off into space.</p>

<p>"No, interesting is deciding what I'm going to wear to the prom,"
Cordelia from her seat next to Faith. "This is *not* interesting.
It's more like badness squared."</p>

<p>"It's not that bad Cordy," Xander said, sitting across the table from
her. "I have total confidence in our newly reunited Slayers to kick
some major demon ass." He looked between Faith and me but neither one
of us said anything which seemed to dampen his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, your confidence aside, I think some more research about the
Judge will ease my mind considerably," Giles said sarcastically,
putting his glasses back on.</p>

<p>Faith got up, heading towards the door and brushing past me.</p>

<p>"Faith, where are you going?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Research ain't my thing. I'll see you guys later." Faith continued
walking out the door without a backward glance, her words fading as
the doors closed behind her.</p>

<p>"I'll be right back," I said, going out the door. I caught up with
Faith walking down the hall and stepped in front of her. "Haven't you
ever regretted something so much that you would give anything to go
back and change it?" I asked, cutting her off before she could say a
word. "I'm not asking you to forget what happened, Faith but to give
me a second chance because I love you and I think you still feel the
same way about me too. Please don't give up on that because I made a
stupid mistake."</p>

<p>I stopped, catching my breath as I waited for her to say something.
Her expression was unreadable as she looked at me but at least there
was no hatred in her eyes this time. I didn't think I could take it
if there was. The first time, the only time she'd looked at me like
that and I thought the pain would swallow my soul. I didn't fully
realize how bad it'd gotten until then and I just hoped it was still
not too late.</p>

<p>"Faith, please say something," I begged when she still didn't speak.</p>

<p>Her jaw worked several times before she grabbed me right above the
elbow and pulled me towards the back of the school. We walked outside
to the bleachers near the track. She stood in front of me as I sat
down, a hand running through her hair.</p>

<p>"You know I'm not the kind of person to share and open myself up to
examining my feelings but fuck, you hurt me, B." I got up, intending
to reach out to touch her but she backed away, her hands up in a
nonverbal request for me to sit back down. When I did, she sighed and
continued, "So what do you feel for him?" She asked, not even trying
to hide the disgust in her voice.</p>

<p>I hesitated, choosing my words carefully. "He's become a friend to
me. He says he loves me but I've told him I couldn't be with him."</p>

<p>"And the guy just won't take no for an answer, right?" She asked with
a sarcastic edge. I didn't answer as I bit down on my lower lip. She
looked contrite for a second before taking a seat next to me, far
enough away so that we weren't touching. "Look, it's going to take me
some time. I felt...I felt like my heart's been squeezed dry."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said again.</p>

<p>She waved it off, placing her elbows on her knees and staring out
contemplatively on the track. "Let's take care of this Judge. Then,
we can worry about the other stuff."</p>

<p>I looked at her, wanting so much to touch her but knowing that I
couldn't, not yet. "Sure," I said. We sat there, neither one of us
knowing quite what to say now. </p>

<p>Finally, she broke the uncomfortable silence. "I'm going to skip the
rest of my classes today. I'll see you guys in the afternoon or
something." She got up and left, leaving me to sit on the bench.
Things were better. They were certainly alot better than last night
but last night had been the complete nadir of my existence. I didn't
think I could've sunk any lower and if, in the future I did, it was a
depressing thing to look forward to. </p>

<p>I sat there for a few more minutes and then walked back to the school
and with my current run of luck, I should've known I would run right
into Principal Snyder as I was letting myself back in.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," he said in his smug, evil way. "Don't tell me
you're playing hooky again Miss Summers. That would make me have to
give you detention and you know how much I hate to do that." His
sneer made me doubt very much that he wouldn't find extreme, orgasmic
pleasure in doing just that. No amount of bullshit could stop the
little troll from giving me detention and as he sent me to my next
class, I wondered briefly if he would ever be able to find anyone he
could enjoy torturing as much as me after I graduated.</p>

<p>As I slipped into my next class which happened to be Chemistry, a
class I was taking with Willow and Xander, I wished I weren't there --
- I wished I was outside, with Faith because even though she might
still be angry at me, I still wanted to be near her. Willow smiled at
me in greeting as I took the seat in front of her. As soon as I did,
she passed me a piece of paper, making sure that the teacher's head
was turned at the time.</p>

<p>I opened up the note and the question 'Are you and Faith all right?
You two seemed really distant today. Did something happen yesterday?'
was written in small, neat print on the center of the page. I folded
the note back up again but I didn't write back an answer because I
didn't know what to write that wouldn't sound contrite or an outright
lie. And if I did decide to write down the truth, I didn't think I'd
get finished by the end of class.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" She called out my name when class ended thirty minutes
later. I looked behind me and they were both looking at me with
concern.</p>

<p>"I'm all right guys," I said with what I hoped was a smile that
proved that. </p>

<p>"Are you sure because, from where we're standing, you don't look all
right," Xander observed. "And Faith...she looked barely together
today."</p>

<p>I finally relented, shifting my notebook to the other hand. "There
*is* something going on," I admitted. "But I can't really talk about
it right now." They looked ready to protest so I held up a hand. "It
doesn't have anything to do with the Judge or any other apocalyptic
issue. I just need some time to sort this out myself and then, I
promise, I'll tell you about it."</p>

<p>They seemed uneasy about that arrangement but accepted it
nonetheless. Willow walked with me to my next and last class and
right before we reached the room, she suddenly announced that she had
decided on going to the University of Sunnydale in the fall. I
immediately smiled because my best friend would be staying. Then I
remembered exactly where she was deciding to stay and I tried urging
her to go to a hundred different schools that weren't lying on top of
a hellmouth but she was adamant.</p>

<p>"I've already decided, Buffy. I'm going to stay. I want to help you.
Do you realize that I've done more good in the last year than some
people do in their entire lifetime? I can't give that up," she said,
shooting me a teasing smile.</p>

<p>I could have kept arguing with her but my heart just wasn't in it.
Deep down, I wanted her to stay and even though it was a selfish wish
and I was guilty about feeling so happy about her decision, I
couldn't keep the smile from my own face as I hugged her. When the
teacher finally came out into the hall to not too subtly tell us to
get a move on, I grinned at her once more before following him into
the room. Suddenly, I felt not so alone anymore.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>We were all gathered in one room, gawking at all the weapons Xander
had swiped from the military base. Apparently, while I was gone, he
had acquired a few new skills that weren't taught in woodshop.</p>

<p>"Remind me to give you my wishlist for Christmas, X," I said, eyeing
the big artillery. </p>

<p>Xander almost started beaming at my pseudo-compliment. "Since the
Judge can't be killed with forged weapons, I figured this might work."</p>

<p>As they were talking about where the Judge would most likely head to
to get his feeding frenzy on, I looked over at Angel hunkered down
next to Giles and congratulated myself for not having thrown a punch
when I first came in here and saw him. I think the only reason I
didn't was cause we had this whole apocalypse thing hanging over us.
When I caught his eye, he looked like he wanted to throw a punch
himself. I figured if we didn't die after this, then we'd fucking
have it out. Right now though, we had the world to save first.</p>

<p>Oz suggested that since the Bronze was closed tonight, the Judge
would probably head for the mall to feed so we took his van, speeding
all the way there. It's funny what kinds of thoughts run through your
mind when you think you might die. Some things just start making
sense all of a sudden. For me, right then, huddled in a van,
surrounded by my friends and heading straight towards what might be
our deaths, I kept thinking that if something happened to me tonight,
I didn't want to go out feeling the way I was feeling.</p>

<p>I debated with myself for a few minutes before I let my hand reach
down, moving over Buffy's which were loosely folded over her lap. I
slipped my fingers across her palm and held her hand, watching
intently as her fingers curled around mine. My eyes wandered slowly
up from our linked hands and saw that she was looking at me as if she
were afraid to let herself hope and that forced me to swallow, trying
to moisten my suddenly dry mouth.</p>

<p>'I love you,' she mouthed, her eyes locked on mine and making me wish
we could both take back what we'd said and done over the last twenty-
four hours. But it wasn't that easy --- it never was. No matter how
much I wanted to say it back to her, I couldn't make my lips move
over the words and I hated myself for that. So instead, I looked
away, finding it easier to breathe when I wasn't looking into her
eyes. But I didn't let go of her hand until we got to the mall where
Angel and Xander carried the box of weapons as we all followed Buffy
inside.</p>

<p>The party had already started without us. When we stepped through the
doors, the Judge was draining people left and right, yellow bolts of
energy shooting out from him as vampires guarded the exits. Spike and
Dru were there, watching the action from the back with happy little
grins on their faces as they saw their pet work his magic.</p>

<p>He stopped though when he saw us coming in, almost daring us to try
and take him out. Buffy didn't even bother with the puns as she
whipped out the rocket launcher, leveled it at him and fired. The
stupid bastard didn't even know enough to duck as the missile hit him
square in the chest, sending Judge bits flying everywhere. As soon as
they saw him go kaboom, Spike and Dru took off and the rest of the
vamps who didn't have a clue were quickly picked off. The rest of the
night was spent picking up demon chunks from where ever the hell they
flew. Angel volunteered again to get rid of them and I didn't even
try to stop the snide comment from shooting out of my mouth about the
last time he'd volunteered. </p>

<p>I left with a smirk on my face, leaving everybody standing around
uncomfortably as I walked out the doors. I only got a couple of steps
in before Buffy came out after me and began walking next to me. We
didn't say one word to each other until we reached one of the
cemeteries, dotting Sunnydale's landscape like pockmarks. Instead of
passing it by, I walked in, knowing the place by heart even though I
hadn't patrolled this one in months. Buffy walked beside me, her
hands shoved into her jacket pockets and her eyes on the ground two
feet in front of her.</p>

<p>When I stopped at one of the graves, she kept walking a couple of
steps before she realized I wasn't with her anymore. She turned back,
a wary expression on her face as she looked back at me. I took a deep
breath, trying to remember the speech I'd practiced over and over in
my mind for the last fifteen minutes but my mind drew a blank.
Figures, the one time I need my brain to work and it spazzes out. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I finally blurted out, digging the toe of my shoe into
the dirt. "For kicking you. I didn't mean it --- well, actually I did
at the time but I shouldn't have done that." </p>

<p>She nodded, stepping closer to me. "Do you think we could ever be
like we were before?" She hesitantly asked, her eyes silently
pleading for me to say yes.</p>

<p>Instead of answering the question, I reached into my pocket and
brought out a silver ring with a small heart on it and held it out to
her. </p>

<p>"What's this?" She asked, taking it from me.</p>

<p>"Your birthday present," I said, watching her put it on. "I bought it
for you today...Even when I was angry at you, I couldn't really be
angry at you, y'know?" </p>

<p>I looked up into her shimmering eyes and I almost broke down myself
when she asked in a quiet voice, "Can I hug you...please?"</p>

<p>I nodded, not trusting my own voice at all. She took one more step
forward until she was standing right in front of me and then her
hands moved tentatively around my waist, pulling me into a gentle hug
that was all the more real because I could feel her trembling, trying
to hold in her emotions. She let out a shaky breath as her arms
tightened around me, her head resting on my shoulder. And even though
I wanted to just wrap my own arms around her and hold her back, they
stayed at my sides until she pulled away a few minutes later. She
smiled at me faintly and we continued walking through the cemetery.</p>

<p>When we got home, for some reason, the whole gang had decided they
were going to hang out at Buffy's house and they were all lounging
around when we stepped through the door.</p>

<p>"Hey, about time you guys showed," Xander said with a toothy grin.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" Buffy asked, looking around at everyone.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me," Cordelia said, her arms folded. "I don't know why
I'm here either."</p>

<p>Willow ignored Cordy's comment. "We noticed how you two
seemed...upset lately and we were wondering if we could help --- not
in a butting in kind of way, but more like a friendly helping hand
kind of way," she said as delicately as she could.</p>

<p>Buffy turned back to look at me and I shrugged. If she wanted to tell
them all about us, I wasn't going to stop her. She looked back
around, running her eyes over everyone in the room and then said, in
a much more confident voice than I expected, "I don't know how to
tell you this without making it sound like it's coming out of left
field so I'm just going to say it." She paused and all eyes were on
her. "I'm in love with Faith."</p>

<p>That little announcement was met with total silence. I happened to
look over at Cordy and she was just flat out gawking at me and I
wondered exactly what she could be thinking. Xander finally, slowly
closed his mouth, gulped and asked, "Wow...what?"</p>

<p>"That certainly is left field quality," Willow added, scrunching up
her brows. "But when...?"</p>

<p>"Last summer," Buffy answered, sneaking a peak over at me.</p>

<p>"If anybody's got any problems with that, you might as well lay it
out for us now," I finally said, adding my voice to the conversation
and getting a grateful look from Buffy. I waited around for somebody
to say something but none of them did. "Great. Glad that we got that
out of the way." I went over, plopping down on the sofa and leaned my
head back to watch TV.</p>

<p>"Aren't we the grumpy one?" Cordy said under her breath. I shot her a
cold look which she met with a raised eyebrow. </p>

<p>The doorbell rang then, taking some of the tension with it. Turned
out it was the pizza which they'd ordered before we got there. As we
were chowing down, Xander kept looking at Buffy and me whenever he
thought we weren't looking but he wasn't doing such a great job at
trying to hide it. I wish he'd just come out and ask whatever it was
that was on his mind but I could've guessed even if he didn't.
Knowing Xander, he was probably daydreaming about a threesome with
him in the middle.</p>

<p>But aside from that, everybody else seemed cool about Buffy and me
being together. Of course, they didn't know the whole story and I
wondered if they would change their minds if they did.</p>

<p>"I think they took the news well, don't you?" Buffy asked kinda
nervously, after they'd left for the night.</p>

<p>I looked over at her standing next to the couch. "Yeah, I guess," I
said slowly, watching her play distractedly with the ring on her
finger. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Wrong? Nothing's wrong," she said, sitting down next to me. Then
after a pause, she added, "This is probably the worst time to bring
this up and I don't know why I'm even talking about it but
it's...it's about the prom."</p>

<p>"B?" I asked, quirking an eyebrow at her. "Are you trying to ask me
to go with you?"</p>

<p>"If you'd like to go," she said, smiling shyly. "You don't have to
feel like you have to go but it might be fun."</p>

<p>I shrugged. "Sure," I said which put a brilliant smile on her face. I
turned away and rubbed a hand across my eyes, trying to get myself
under control cause every time she smiled at me, it made me remember
what had happened and whenever I remembered what had happened...Damn,
I just wanted to forget so much. </p>

<p>I felt her putting a hand on my back, rubbing in small circles and I
didn't know whether to get up or just sit there and let her make me
feel better. We sat for a few minutes until I got up the nerve to
turn back and face her again. She was giving me an understanding look
and after everything that had happened, I finally let myself put my
arms around her, hugging her to my body. I knew things between us
would be all right cause I honestly couldn't see myself loving anyone
else besides this girl in my arms...even after everything. Now that's
gotta count for something</p>
