<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 2 -->

<p>Sam made it home and her Mom was waiting for her at the door.
			Placing her sister in her arms, Jane gave her a stern look.</p>
		<p>"You are late.  We will talk more when I get home."  Placing a
			kiss on both her daughter's cheeks and she was gone. Sam let out a
			relieved breath, looking at her sister she smiled speaking to little
			Mac.</p>
		<p>"Mommy wasn't too mad, was she Mac?" Turning to Lily, "Lets go
			see what's on the TV to keep Mac's interests."</p>
		<p>Shannon and Jason got all the work done quickly.  Shannon
			decided to also print her own poem to Sam and conveniently left out
			her name. Thinking since someone else did it for Brooke, she wouldn't
			be the only one sending out secret admirer notes.  And besides, it's
			for Valentine's Day, everyone will think nothing of it.  Hers wasn't
			as good as Brooke Addict's, she admitted, so hers probably wouldn't
			even be noticed.</p>
		<p>When they were done, they printed them out and placed them in
			the out going box  to be distributed in the morning. They locked up
			and headed home. Shannon wanted so bad for an excuse to call or visit
			Sam. She knew there wasn't any so she gave up but decided she was
			going to try and get Sam's attention somehow.</p>
		<p>Sam and Lily had just put Mac down for a nap after a long
			drawn out game of Peek- A- Boo. Lily smiled at how good Sam was with
			the baby. They didn't say a word until both of them were out of the
			room and heading down the stairs. </p>
		<p>"Sam, have you ever thought about having kids?" Lily inquired.</p>
		<p>Sam looked at her like she grew 2 heads.</p>
		<p>"Well, I guess, yeah. But not until I'm ready.  I want to excel
			in my career first," she stated simply but Lily's inquiry made her
			wonder.  What it would be like?  And of course, the other person came
			to her mind was in the form of Brooke. Visions of Brooke with little
			Mac filled her mind and how natural the blonde was at it.  Even she
			was still a little stiff with their little sister but Brooke from day
			one looked completely at ease. She smiled to herself at the beautiful
			smile that always spread across Brooke's face while she was playing
			with little Mac. Coming out of her little day dream she realized Lily
			was calling her name.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Lil, what did you say?"</p>
		<p>Lily just smiled and said: "I was just saying you could have
			both.  You do the career and Brooke could stay home with the kids."
			She giggled at the imagery. "I could see that.  You coming home from
			a hard day of reporting, walk through the door and kiss your loving
			wife Brooke hello.   Having 2 kids bouncing around you wanting to
			show you what they did in school and Brooke placing the baby in your
			arms while she heads back to the kitchen to finish dinner." </p>
		<p>Sam watched Lily as she seemed to be far away in thought.
			Sam elbowed her and laughed.</p>
		<p>"Seems like you have given this a lot of thought. You have got
			one vivid imagination." Lily giggled again.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." Both looked toward the door as it opened to reveal a
			radiant Brooke chatting on her cell phone excitedly.  Sam just stood
			there thinking how beautiful Brooke looked in her cheerleading
			outfit. Lily nudged her and cleared her throat.</p>
		<p>"Close your mouth, Sam, before she sees you gaping at her.  You have
			seen her in her uniform before,"  rolling her eyes as she finished.
			Sam closed her mouth with an audible pop.</p>
		<p>"I know.   It's just that she's excited.  Look at her chest
			rising and falling with each quick breath and the flush that is
			covering her face and the." before she could continue Lily covered
			her mouth just as Brooke hung up the phone and noticed them standing
			there. Looking at the two other girls with a somewhat amused but also
			curious expression.</p>
		<p>"Hey, what's up?" Brooke asked as the longer they stood
			there the more weird the scene looked. Brooke was beginning to wonder
			what the two girls were on.</p>
		<p>Shaking her head to free her mouth from Lily's hand Sam just
			smiled.</p>
		<p>"Nothings up.  What makes you think some things up?" Sam said a
			little nervously looking to Lily for her agreement. </p>
		<p>Lily just shook her head and agreed "Yeah, nothings up."</p>
		<p>Brooke looked back and forth between them. "Yeah, I think Sam
			just said that." Deciding she wasn't going to get any answers, she
			headed for the kitchen to get something to eat.</p>
		<p>Lily looked at Sam rolled her eyes and said, "I am going home
			now."</p>
		<p>Sam grabbed her arm. "Wait now that Brooke is here, I'll
			drive you.  Brooke? I'm going to drive Lily home be back in about 20
			minutes. Mac is sleeping, OK?"</p>
		<p>Brooke poked her head out of the kitchen. "Yeah, whatever."</p>
		<p>So Sam took Lily home, needing to get out of the house and
			away from Brooke so she could do some thinking without it being
			fogged up by the blonde.</p>
