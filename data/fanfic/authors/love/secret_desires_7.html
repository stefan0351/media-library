<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 7 -->

<p>Sam ran up to Lily, "I've decided that you were right. I
		am going
		to use the poem contest, but only to help Brooke out of her
		funk."
		Sam told Lily of hers and Brooke's conversation in the bathroom,
		and
		that she planned on giving Brooke what she needed. So Lily and Sam,
		thought up some little romantic things to do besides the poems in
		the paper.</p>

		<p>When they got to homeroom everyone was again reading the paper
		huddled together. Lily looked up from her copy and gave Sam a look
		that showed she was very much impressed with this one. They heard
		the murmurs all around them, saying how sexy this one was and how
		lucky Brooke was.</p>

		<p>Brooke felt very warm after reading it, and couldn't help
		but
		wish that these words were coming from Sam. She looked up in time to
		see Shannon squatting down in front of Sam. She felt that familiar
		burn in her chest, She wanted to get up and kick her ass, but she
		knew she really had no right. Sam was a single girl and if she was
		attracted to Shannon than there was really nothing she could do.
		Even though her mind was screaming at her, that there was, just let
		Sam know there is another person interested.</p>

		<p>Brooke could tell that Sam liked Shannon, she got all shy and
		giggly when they were together and she didn't miss the way Sam
		checked her out. Brooke could swear that Sam looked at her with
		desire a couple of times but part of her was still to afraid to
		admit it to herself that she wasn't just imagining it.</p>

		<p>Shannon asked Sam "Would it be ok if I drove you home after
		school? I need to talk to you about something." </p>

		<p>Sam nodded "Sure, Is everything ok? Is something wrong?"
		she
		asked a little worried. Shannon smiled and reassured Sam that
		everything was fine and she just wanted to talk. And when Shannon
		stood up she looked to Brooke and gave her a huge smile and turned
		and left.</p>

		<p>Brooke stared at the girls retreating back trying to burn holes
		in the back of her head with her eyes.</p>

		<p>Again Nicole's interest was peaked, having witnessed
		everything
		including the almost longing looks Brooke was throwing in Spam's
		direction. Nicole just shook her head and turned her attention to
		more important things like her makeup application. She would wait
		and see what happens before she confronted the other blonde, maybe
		she was wrong, but than she just smirked to herself and
		thought, "I'm never wrong."</p>

		<p>Lily laughed as Shannon left and shook her head.
		 "What are you laughing for?" Sam asked with a puzzled look
		on her
		face.</p>

		<p>Lily just shrugged "Oh come on Sam. You can't tell me that
		you
		didn't notice that Shannon has it bad for you. It is so
		obvious." </p>

		<p>Sam stared at the shorter girl like she has two heads, "We
		are
		just friends Lil." Than she turned and looked where Shannon
		disappeared and smiled "That wouldn't be so bad though."
		She said
		lowly and giggled.</p>

		<p>Lily rolled her eyes "Sam, think about it, while you are in
		love with Brooke you would only end up breaking that girls heart.
		And I bet that is what she wants to talk to you about. She wants to
		tell you how she feels."</p>

		<p>Sam stared at Lily for a minute and realized she was right and
		she didn't want to hurt Shannon. "Damn I hope you aren't
		right."</p>

		<p>Brooke heard Sam and Lily giggling and just knew it was
		something Shannon said, and she was fuming now. She never got this
		jealous over anyone else, and she didn't like it. Sighing loudly
		she
		put her head down as the morning announcements started.

		   Sam wrote a short but sweet letter, and gave it to Lily so she
		could slip it into Brooke's things during their next class
		together. </p>

		<p>Then Sam wrote a short very sexy poem, and decided to slip it into
		the blonde's locker during next period. </p>

		<p>The day progressed like that making sure Brooke got the letter
		and the poem without being seen. Then as Lily was leaving Sam
		slipped her some money and asked her to buy a single long stem rose
		and told her that she would be by after she talked to Shannon to
		pick it up.</p>

		<p>Shannon was waiting outside for Sam, and when the journalist
		walked out she couldn't help the 100 watt smile that spread
		across
		her face.</p>

		<p>"This is going to be interesting" Sam thought to herself.
		The ride
		to her house was quite, Shannon was trying to figure a way to tell
		Sam that she liked her without freaking her out, especially if Sam
		didn't like girls.</p>

		<p>Sam didn't know what to say so she pretty much just stared
		out
		the window. Hoping Lily wasn't right, as flattering as it would
		be,
		she didn't want their friendship to suffer. Turning to look at
		the
		other girl Sam thought again "She is beautiful, maybe Lily
		isn't
		right, maybe all she needs is someone to take her mind off of
		Brooke." She shook her head and looked back out the window
		feeling
		so confused.</p>

		<p>Shannon and Sam went straight out to the pool and sat down with
		their feet dangling in the water, and had been sitting there for 15
		minutes before Shannon finally spoke. "I know you are wondering
		what
		I wanted to talk to you about, so I am going to just say it. I like
		you Sam, I am very attracted to you, I don't know if it's
		just me
		but at times I think that you are look at me like you feel the
		same." Taking a deep breath she went on "I'm not
		expecting anything,
		I would just like to take you out sometime and maybe see where it
		could lead." </p>

		<p>Pulling a little wrapped box out of her pocket she handed it to
		Sam "This is an early Valentines gift, I want you to have, so
		please
		except it." </p>

		<p>Sam smiled, unwrapped and opened the box gasping at the
		contents "Wow, it's beautiful." Inside the box was a gold
		chain with
		Sam's Initial dangling from it.</p>

		<p>"Do you like it? Shannon asked a little nervous.</p>

		<p>"I Love it, but I cant except this, It's to much."
		But before
		she could continue Shannon cut her off.</p>

		<p>"Please keep it, I didn't get it for any other reason
		than that
		you are a great friend." She pleaded with Sam and Sam smiled and
		gave it. "Here let me put it on for you."  </p>

		<p>After she clasped it she ran her fingertips slowly down and
		over
		Sam's neck and shoulders. She than leaned in and whispered
		"Sam, You
		are so beautiful."</p>

		<p>Sam felt chills coursing through her body at the soft caresses,
		and couldn't help but lean into it and close her eyes, letting
		out a
		soft moan at the whispered words. She than let Shannon turn her head
		slightly so that she was looking into longing eyes. </p>

		<p>Not being able to fight her own desires anymore Shannon leaned
		in and kissed Sam softly, when she didn't pull away she slowly
		deepened the kiss. </p>

		<p>Sam slid her right hand up and around the other girl's neck
		and
		couldn't help the moan that escaped. Shannon just pulled Sam
		tighter
		against her.</p>

		<p>Brooke pulled into the drive, after getting frustrated with
		Nicole and Merry Cherry all she wanted to do was come home and relax
		and maybe watch a movie with Sam. But than she saw Shannon's
		Trans
		Am sitting in the driveway she just shook her head, her mood just
		got worse.</p>

		<p>Walking into the house she noticed that she didn't hear any
		movements, or talking. Walking up the stairs she noticed there was
		no one up there either. She decided to make a snack and watch some
		tv till Sam showed up. On her way to the kitchen she heard voices
		coming from near the pool, Letting her curiosity get the better of
		her she looked out and saw Shannon give Sam a little box. She knew
		it had to be something nice from the look on Sam's face.</p>

		<p>She watched from where she stood feeling first shock than sick,
		and when Shannon started kissing Sam, she felt like she was just
		kicked in the stomach.
		 Wishing she didn't see that, now that vision was burned in her
		mind, knowing it will be what she sees every time she sees Shannon
		and Sam together.</p>

		<p>Changing her mind about the snack, having lost her appetite she
		went up to her room and laid down hoping sleep would just take her
		as tears started to fall.</p>
