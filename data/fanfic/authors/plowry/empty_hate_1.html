<!-- Empty Hate \ Part 1 -->

<p>"I hate Brooke," Sam thought, as the bell rang, and she walked out of
her class, towards her locker. She was supposed to meet up with Lily
and Carmen, but she just didn't have the energy today. She was single-
minded, and all of her brain was right now in use pondering the full
depths of her hatred. Not only did that righteous stuck up
cheerleader invaded her home, her friends; Harrison was in love with
her and Carmen idolized her, but now she had gone to far. She had
asked Josh out. She had asked Josh out! And there they were. She saw
Brooke peering into her locker, and Josh was right beside her,
whispering into her ear, and she saw a slight smile creep onto
Brookes face. "Ugh," she muttered, as she systematically opened her
locker and reached for her biology book.</p>

<p>The one night that they had bonded, sitting on the couch and talking
about the movie they had just watched, Sam had admitted that she had
a crush on Josh. It was like they had been friends. And that was only
a week ago. Now, Brooke and Josh were dating, and the whole idea made
her sick.</p>

<p>"Get out of the bathroom!" Sam said forcefully, as Brooke started
fiddling with the bathtub taps, adjusting the hot water. "No, I was
here first, get lost," Brooke said, not even bothering to look
up. "Listen you self-centered cheerleader, the world does not revolve
around you, no matter how firmly you believe it." At that Brooke,
turned her head, her blue eyes flashing with fire. "That's the best
you could do? You egotistical brat, you think I'm self-centered? Who
was here first, and who came barging in suddenly thinking that anyone
else would leave just because you want something? Think again." Sam's
jaw set, and they stared at each other, both girl's eyes filled with
contempt and hatred. "Of all the people to be my step sister, it had
to be you," Sam muttered as she turned and walked into her room.</p>

<p>The second Sam got into her bedroom, she slammed her books down
beside her desk, closed her blinds, and crawled into the center of
her bed, feeling the soft sheets against her skin, and she gave
herself up into the softness, promptly pulling the covers up and over
her head. It was her cocoon, and nothing could harm her here. Inside
it was dark, and she could barely see the design of the comforter. It
had been a long day. At lunch Carmen had gushed about how great the
cheerleading squad was, and how much she liked Josh and Brooke
together. "Ohh, they're such a cute couple, ohh, she's so perfect,
ohh, she's so smart," Sam muttered sarcastically into the pillow, as
she closed her eyes and let sleep slowly overcome her.  She was
startled when she felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up and saw
that it was nighttime, and the moon was seeping softly through the
window, and Brooke was standing there, standing dripping wet in a
cotton towel. "Hey,' Brooke uttered softly, as she sat down on the
bed. "I just wanted to say that I'm sorry I lashed out on you, I just
had a bad day too." Sam was startled. "No, it's ok," she stutter,
unsure of what to say...</p>

<p>"No it's not. Of all the people that I want to hurt you aren't one of
them," Brooke said as she held out her hand. Sam put her hand in
hers, and she let Brooke guide her off the bed. "Where are we going?"
she asked, but Brooke didn't answer her, and suddenly she didn't
care. She led her into the bathroom. The bath was still full, but now
the lights were off, and she could see white candles spread out
around the sinks, casting strange shadows all around the room. Brooke
let go of Sam's hands, and reached up, and slowly began fiddling with
the first button on Sam's shirt. "What are you doing?" Sam asked, her
voice breaking in three separate places.</p>

<p>"What I have wanted to do for a very long time," she whispered, the
timbers of her voice low and filled with lust. Sam saw her shirt drop
to the floor, and felt Brooke's eyes rake across her body, taking her
in.  "You are so beautiful," she said, and she fingered with the
button on Sam's pants, "I've wanted this for so long", she said
softly, as she slid Sam's pants down, which Sam dutifully stepped out
of. Brooke dropped the towel that she was in, and Sam gasped. She was
so beautiful, her porcelain skin and her smooth curves.  Her heart
was hammering away in her chest and she started shaking
softly. "Don't be nervous," Brooke whispered, as she stepped forward
and cupped her cheek Sam's cheek with her hand, and slowly brought
her lips to hers. Sam knew she should step bask, that this was
crossing all the boundaries that had ever been set, but she didn't
care anymore, and she slowly, tentatively reached out, feeling
Brooke's warmth against her hands, as she felt Brooke's lips gently
make their way down to her neck, sensuously kissing her tender skin,
before coming up and gently biting on her earlobe, whispering
something so softly Brooke could barely hear it, but she did, and she
could feel her feet give away as a sea of pleasure overcame her. " I
love you."</p>

<p>Sam woke up, and as she felt the blankets all around her, and as her
heart was still dutifully hammering in her chest, she knew that she
was solidly placed in reality. "Oh my god," Sam whispered, panicked,
although about what she wasn't quite sure. "Oh my god," she said
again as it hit her. She had just had a dream about Brooke. "Oh my
god," Brooke said, as she suddenly sat up, fully awake, anxiety
tingling through her chest.  "All girls have dreams at one time or
another about other girls," Sam thought, and strained to believe it.
There was nothing that was unusual about this, but even at that
moment she could still feel Sam's soft lips against hers, and her
strong hands holding her, loving her. "Honey, dinner's ready," she
heard a voice call out from the kitchen. "Dinner, I can do dinner,
sit down, eat, dinner." She crawled out of bed, and struggled to get
her trembling legs under control as she walked down the hall, and to
the dining room.</p>

<p>Sam fiddled with her mashed potatoes, absent mindedly making little
designs with her fork, barely registering the word that her mother
was saying, something about an art exhibit she wanted to go to on
Thursday.  Slowly she peered across the table, where Brooke was
sitting. She was looking at her father, and saying something about
the artist, but she didn't really even hear her. She was noticing, as
if for the first time, how truly captivating she was, how the light
reflected off her golden hair, how her mouth curved ever so slightly
into a smile, how she excitedly moved her hands. She heard her mother
address her, but before she could turn her head, Brooke was looking
at her, straight at her. She quickly averted her eyes, and picked up
her plate. She could feel her face go deathly pale, and as if to
compensate, she could feel herself blush, an interesting shade of
red. "Umm, I'm not feeling well, I'm going to lie down," she
muttered, a thinly-veiled excuse, while making her escape to the
kitchen, where she put her plate in the sink and then stood there
with her hands at the sink's edges, grasping for support.</p>

<p>"Honey what's wrong," her mother said as she walked in, and placed
her hand against Brooke's forehead. "I think you have a fever, you're
warm.  Do you want some Tylenol?" she said, concern clear in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I'll be fine." Her mother was quiet for a second, as if she
was trying to figure out what was really bothering her, so Sam took
that time to make her escape. In her room she crawled under the
covers, and the only thing she wished for was for a black
peacefulness, a nothing in which she could attempt to escape from the
confusion that was tearing at her hear. She tried to recollect the
hatred she felt, but it wasn't there. It wasn't ever there, she
realized. She had wanted to hate her, so she could try to cover up
what she really felt, something that she had pushed down along time
ago. Now, she remembered the time in eighth grade, where they had
been going on a field rip, and Brooke had been assigned to sit next
to her. She could remember even then how nice she had been, and about
how little butterflies had seemed to cascade into her stomach. And
even though she hadn't known what that had meant, she had felt her
head get light, as she realized that her heart had gone out as she
heard Brooke's soft tender voice seeping through her, and leading her
to places that were beautiful and haunting, places she had never been
but felt like she belonged. She didn't hate Brooke; she hated Josh.
She wanted to be the one that Brooke smiled for, the one that she
thought about each night, and the one who could hold her in her arms,
together they would let world fade away.</p>
