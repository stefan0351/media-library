<p>"I hate Brooke," Sam thought, as the bell rang, and she walked out of
her class, towards her locker. She was supposed to meet up with Lily
and Carmen, but she just didn't have the energy today. She was single-
minded, and all of her brain was right now in use pondering the full
depths of her hatred. Not only did that righteous stuck up
cheerleader invaded her home, her friends; Harrison was in love with
her and Carmen idolized her, but now she had gone to far. She had
asked Josh out. She had asked Josh out! And there they were. She saw
Brooke peering into her locker, and Josh was right beside her,
whispering into her ear, and she saw a slight smile creep onto
Brookes face. "Ugh," she muttered, as she systematically opened her
locker and reached for her biology book.</p>

<p>The one night that they had bonded, sitting on the couch and talking
about the movie they had just watched, Sam had admitted that she had
a crush on Josh. It was like they had been friends. And that was only
a week ago. Now, Brooke and Josh were dating, and the whole idea made
her sick.</p>

<p>"Get out of the bathroom!" Sam said forcefully, as Brooke started
fiddling with the bathtub taps, adjusting the hot water. "No, I was
here first, get lost," Brooke said, not even bothering to look
up. "Listen you self-centered cheerleader, the world does not revolve
around you, no matter how firmly you believe it." At that Brooke,
turned her head, her blue eyes flashing with fire. "That's the best
you could do? You egotistical brat, you think I'm self-centered? Who
was here first, and who came barging in suddenly thinking that anyone
else would leave just because you want something? Think again." Sam's
jaw set, and they stared at each other, both girl's eyes filled with
contempt and hatred. "Of all the people to be my step sister, it had
to be you," Sam muttered as she turned and walked into her room.</p>

<p>The second Sam got into her bedroom, she slammed her books down
beside her desk, closed her blinds, and crawled into the center of
her bed, feeling the soft sheets against her skin, and she gave
herself up into the softness, promptly pulling the covers up and over
her head. It was her cocoon, and nothing could harm her here. Inside
it was dark, and she could barely see the design of the comforter. It
had been a long day. At lunch Carmen had gushed about how great the
cheerleading squad was, and how much she liked Josh and Brooke
together. "Ohh, they're such a cute couple, ohh, she's so perfect,
ohh, she's so smart," Sam muttered sarcastically into the pillow, as
she closed her eyes and let sleep slowly overcome her.  She was
startled when she felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up and saw
that it was nighttime, and the moon was seeping softly through the
window, and Brooke was standing there, standing dripping wet in a
cotton towel. "Hey,' Brooke uttered softly, as she sat down on the
bed. "I just wanted to say that I'm sorry I lashed out on you, I just
had a bad day too." Sam was startled. "No, it's ok," she stutter,
unsure of what to say...</p>

<p>"No it's not. Of all the people that I want to hurt you aren't one of
them," Brooke said as she held out her hand. Sam put her hand in
hers, and she let Brooke guide her off the bed. "Where are we going?"
she asked, but Brooke didn't answer her, and suddenly she didn't
care. She led her into the bathroom. The bath was still full, but now
the lights were off, and she could see white candles spread out
around the sinks, casting strange shadows all around the room. Brooke
let go of Sam's hands, and reached up, and slowly began fiddling with
the first button on Sam's shirt. "What are you doing?" Sam asked, her
voice breaking in three separate places.</p>

<p>"What I have wanted to do for a very long time," she whispered, the
timbers of her voice low and filled with lust. Sam saw her shirt drop
to the floor, and felt Brooke's eyes rake across her body, taking her
in.  "You are so beautiful," she said, and she fingered with the
button on Sam's pants, "I've wanted this for so long", she said
softly, as she slid Sam's pants down, which Sam dutifully stepped out
of. Brooke dropped the towel that she was in, and Sam gasped. She was
so beautiful, her porcelain skin and her smooth curves.  Her heart
was hammering away in her chest and she started shaking
softly. "Don't be nervous," Brooke whispered, as she stepped forward
and cupped her cheek Sam's cheek with her hand, and slowly brought
her lips to hers. Sam knew she should step bask, that this was
crossing all the boundaries that had ever been set, but she didn't
care anymore, and she slowly, tentatively reached out, feeling
Brooke's warmth against her hands, as she felt Brooke's lips gently
make their way down to her neck, sensuously kissing her tender skin,
before coming up and gently biting on her earlobe, whispering
something so softly Brooke could barely hear it, but she did, and she
could feel her feet give away as a sea of pleasure overcame her. " I
love you."</p>

<p>Sam woke up, and as she felt the blankets all around her, and as her
heart was still dutifully hammering in her chest, she knew that she
was solidly placed in reality. "Oh my god," Sam whispered, panicked,
although about what she wasn't quite sure. "Oh my god," she said
again as it hit her. She had just had a dream about Brooke. "Oh my
god," Brooke said, as she suddenly sat up, fully awake, anxiety
tingling through her chest.  "All girls have dreams at one time or
another about other girls," Sam thought, and strained to believe it.
There was nothing that was unusual about this, but even at that
moment she could still feel Sam's soft lips against hers, and her
strong hands holding her, loving her. "Honey, dinner's ready," she
heard a voice call out from the kitchen. "Dinner, I can do dinner,
sit down, eat, dinner." She crawled out of bed, and struggled to get
her trembling legs under control as she walked down the hall, and to
the dining room.</p>

<p>Sam fiddled with her mashed potatoes, absent mindedly making little
designs with her fork, barely registering the word that her mother
was saying, something about an art exhibit she wanted to go to on
Thursday.  Slowly she peered across the table, where Brooke was
sitting. She was looking at her father, and saying something about
the artist, but she didn't really even hear her. She was noticing, as
if for the first time, how truly captivating she was, how the light
reflected off her golden hair, how her mouth curved ever so slightly
into a smile, how she excitedly moved her hands. She heard her mother
address her, but before she could turn her head, Brooke was looking
at her, straight at her. She quickly averted her eyes, and picked up
her plate. She could feel her face go deathly pale, and as if to
compensate, she could feel herself blush, an interesting shade of
red. "Umm, I'm not feeling well, I'm going to lie down," she
muttered, a thinly-veiled excuse, while making her escape to the
kitchen, where she put her plate in the sink and then stood there
with her hands at the sink's edges, grasping for support.</p>

<p>"Honey what's wrong," her mother said as she walked in, and placed
her hand against Brooke's forehead. "I think you have a fever, you're
warm.  Do you want some Tylenol?" she said, concern clear in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I'll be fine." Her mother was quiet for a second, as if she
was trying to figure out what was really bothering her, so Sam took
that time to make her escape. In her room she crawled under the
covers, and the only thing she wished for was for a black
peacefulness, a nothing in which she could attempt to escape from the
confusion that was tearing at her hear. She tried to recollect the
hatred she felt, but it wasn't there. It wasn't ever there, she
realized. She had wanted to hate her, so she could try to cover up
what she really felt, something that she had pushed down along time
ago. Now, she remembered the time in eighth grade, where they had
been going on a field rip, and Brooke had been assigned to sit next
to her. She could remember even then how nice she had been, and about
how little butterflies had seemed to cascade into her stomach. And
even though she hadn't known what that had meant, she had felt her
head get light, as she realized that her heart had gone out as she
heard Brooke's soft tender voice seeping through her, and leading her
to places that were beautiful and haunting, places she had never been
but felt like she belonged. She didn't hate Brooke; she hated Josh.
She wanted to be the one that Brooke smiled for, the one that she
thought about each night, and the one who could hold her in her arms,
together they would let world fade away.</p>

<p>"Something is wrong," Brooke thought as she entered the house. It was
quiet, an eerie threatening silence that seemed only to hide
something more sinister. All the lights were off, and the hallway was
dark. "Nobody home," she thought, which was odd. Outside it was
rainy, and the sky was cloudy, gray and bleak, and a bitter wind
stung her; the polar opposite to a normal California day. And strange
enough, her house didn't seem to be a haven at. It was like the storm
had seeped in, making the atmosphere as gloomy as the wild sky. When
she had woken up, it had been a sunny day, but there had still had
been an uneasy undercurrent that ran through her family unit. At
breakfast Sam had just stayed hunched over a bowl of cereal, not even
eating. And of course, Brooke had jovially muttered a comment
criticizing Sam's choice of apparel, as was the custom. The weird
thing was, Sam just nodded, didn't even look up.  Of all the way's to
hurt her feelings, that was probably her most effective way;
indifference. I mean, love was something, hatred was something, both
strong feelings, equally consuming. Indifference was, well,
unacceptable.</p>

<p>Brooke broke off that train of thought, and tried to think about more
positive things. Tonight was her first official date with her
boyfriend Josh, even though they had already been going out for a
week. Brooke unconsciously frowned as she pondered over the last
week. Every good argument had its merits, but for the last week Sam
had barely spoken to her, and whenever she had made some snide quip
to provoke a reaction, any reaction, all she had gotten was a glance.
Truth be told, she was getting desperate, and fast. It was like they
weren't frien......"Hold up," Brooke muttered. And just when did that
annoying incident take place? They were not friends, but they
probably weren't exactly enemies. They were completely in the
category of something. Or nothing. Or....</p>

<p>Brooke's thoughts were cut off by a soft pitiful sound that came and
left so quickly, she couldn't even be sure that she had heard it at
all. Brooke tentatively walked from her room, across the bathroom,
and gripped the doorknob to Sam's room. She was a little bit afraid.
She would be an unwelcome intruder, promptly thrown out of the room.
But another small sound escaped from the door, and she stepped in,
and gasped. The room was dark, and the blinds only let in the tiniest
bit of light. That wasn't what she was noticing, though. All she saw
was Sam's curled up figure lying on the bed, with her face in a
pillow, as if she was trying to muffle the sobs, her whole body
silently shaking. Brooke gasped, and Sam slightly pulled her head
from the pillow. Even in the soft light, her eyes sparkled with
unshed tears, and shining with an intensity that was somehow breaking
her heart. "What's wrong?" Brooke whispered, as she tentatively made
her way over to Sam's bed.</p>

<p>For a minute Sam didn't answer, and just before Brooke gave up, there
came a reply. "When I got here, I was really depressed, because, this
was our day. Me and my dad's. Every year we would drive down to this
festival in Seattle, and we would get our face painted, and cotton
candy," Sam said as she wiped her eyes with her sleeve. "But the year
before he died, I didn't go with him, I said I was to busy." Sam's
voice broke for a second, and she wiped at her overflowing eyes with
her sleeve. Sarcastically,  Sam muttered, "to bust with my life to
bother with him." Her tone changed, and now it was filled with
sorrow, "If I had only known that it would be the last time, I would
have given anything, I would give....;"</p>

<p>Brooke reached over and gathered Sam up in her arms, holding Sam to
her. She felt Sam's weight against her, and she felt Sam tense up,
and then slowly relax in her arms, letting her cry, murmuring soft
things in her ear. Eventually Sam's breathing began to lengthen and
she realized that she had fallen asleep on her shoulder. Brooke laid
Sam down onto the pillow, and impulsively, she placed a soft kiss on
her forehead, and walked out of the room, hoping that the morning sun
would cleanse the earth with it's morning ray's, and carry away her
grief.</p>

<p>Brooke propped herself against the side of the car and opened her
mouth to accept the ministrations of her boyfriends tongue. As much
as she wanted to give in to him and let herself get carried away, she
couldn't. Every time she closed her eyes all she saw was Sam's crying
face, her beautiful dark eyes filled with tears. "Wait, beautiful?"
Brooke's eyebrows contracted in confusion.</p>

<p>"Ow," Josh yelped, "you bit my tongue!"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Brooke apologized, letting Josh continue on.
Who was she kidding? Anyone could see that Brooke's face, filled with
sorrow and regret and longing, was piercingly beautiful,
breathtaking. All she had wanted to do was just to hold her.</p>

<p>But wait, this was Sam, Sam her worst enemy, her EVIL soon-to-
be stepsister. Brooke desperately tried to believe this, but it rang
hollow in her ears, ands she knew she didn't believe it, didn't
believe it at all. All she could think of was Sam's sot tender lips,
curled in a clever smirk, and then Brooke covering them with her own.
And for a second, she was no longer with Josh, but it was Sam's
limber body that was pressed against hers, holding her close. And it
was her hand's that traveled the expanse of Brooke's body, Sam's
tender lips that nipped at her neck. And it was Sam that sent shivers
running all through her body.</p>

<p>In the back of her mind, an alarm was going off. It was telling her
that her heart was going to get broken, and that she would never be
able to hold Sam again like she wanted to right then. But it didn't
matter, because something inside her was broken, and she didn't know
how to fix it, or even if she wanted to.</p>

<p>Sam shuffled through her papers, angrily. Goddammit, she
muttered. Deadlines, goddamn awful no-good deadlines. And what's the
worst thing about deadlines? The word dead, which was exactly what
she would be if she didn't find her drug article for the newspaper.
Which incidentally was due tomorrow. `Where was I working on it?'Yes!
epiphany, glorious wonderful epiphany. `Living room, sofa,' she
muttered as she got up and ran to the living room to feel the rush of
disappointment, bitter and stinging flood through her veins. She got
down on her knees and lifted up one of the cushions. Ah ha! In the
corner, bunched into a little ball, was her paper. She grabbed it and
sat down on the ruffled couch and began to tenderly un-rumple it,
resisting just barely the urge to kiss it. Her smile dropped. Her
once beautiful, well thought out paper was now an unreadable well
thought out paper due to the very large purple stain looking
suspiciously like grape juice. And then Sam had another, but not so
glorious epiphany. She understood what it meant to see red. Her
vision was foggy and yet she felt remarkably clear-headed. She was
going to kill Brooke, who was the only person in the house who drank
grape juice. Ohh and it was going to hurt. Badly. For the last week
she had, oh god, been nice to Brooke. Sure, there had been those un-
sisterly and therefore awkward thoughts she had been having about
putting her hands on her in a very un-sisterly ways may have had
something to do with it, but nice it had been regardless. She had let
Brooke hog the T.V! She had even made her dinner, yes dinner, while
her parents were away at some art thing. All right, it had been fun
and she had left feeling all tingly...but now! Look at what she had
done. Wanton lesbian thoughts aside, somebody was going to pay.</p>

<p>Sam slowly stomped over to Brooke's room, and even stopped to
knock. All deaths that would have to occur would be done with a
civility of sorts. "Come in," a soft voice said. Sam opened the door
to see Brooke's lanky form sprawled across the bed, twirling a pencil
in one hand and looking unbelievably sexy, which Sam was too livid to
fully notice at the time. </p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam started in a tone so level and calm matched
with such an ambiguous expressions as to be scary, "how are you
doing?" Sufficient to say, she had captured Brooke's attention, and
her pencil stopped mid swirl. "Fine?' she said uncertainly,
sensing bad undertones. "And yourself?" she questioned tentatively.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not doing quite as well, considering that someone
who drinks gape juice spilled it all over my report and that same
someone forgot to at least tell me and that someone just it away and
now I am screwed!" Sam's voice had risen steadily until she was
shouting. Brooke's face had become completely pale and flushed at the
same time and she scooted back into the bed and ducked her face as if
maybe if she couldn't see Sam, then maybe Sam wouldn't be able to see
her. This just made Sam all the more furious, "You know, despite all
the crappy things you've done to me, for some ungodly reason, I
forgave you. But for what? What? Are you trying to sabotage my
writing? Imagine that for a little while I had actually thought I like
you!" </p>

<p>"Wait,' Brooke started, "what have I done to you, you
being the person who wrote editorials about me, insulted me, and now
you have the nerve to stand here and tell me that I `m the bad one.
What gives you the right?"</p>

<p>"How in the world can you pretend you are Little Miss Innocent?
Do you remember, say, when you stated dating Josh even though I had
just told you I liked him? I bet you don't even like him you, just did
it to hurt me."</p>

<p>Maybe it was the way Sam was shouting or maybe it was because the
words rang a little bit too true, but she snapped. "Well,
it's not like he would have ever gone out with you, Sam, you're only
like one of the most awful people I know. Who would ever date you?"
Sam snapped back like she had been physically slapped. Her eyes began
to tear but she closed them, promising herself she would never ever
cry in front of Brooke.</p>

<p>In a voice trembling with emotion, Sam said, "Don't speak to
me anymore" and she left, locking the door to her room when she got
there. `I can't believe I thought she was my friend. God, how
can I love somebody who thinks of me like, like somebody who's
horrible! No one will date me? Well let's just see about that.'
Sam picked up the phone and pressed speed dial, waiting through a
couple of rings before somebody picked up. </p>

<p>"Hey Harrison, it's Sam."</p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Brooke sat in a stunned silence, the recent exchange
weighing heavily on her mind. Had Sam actually said that she liked
her? `Or used to,' she reminded herself. `Oh god, I
can't believe I... she probably hated me right now. Ironic much? I just
called her -the person who I can't help but look at and smile, the
person who sends shivers of warmth through me by a simple touch - a
horrible person. God, she's the best person I know! She goes out of
her way to be nice to everyone, she even brings me green mint tea
when I don't feel well, and that was when we were still enemies' She
could feel her words burning inside of her.</p>

<p>`The friendships gone,' she thought as a tear slowly trekked
its way down her cheek. </p>

<p>`Well, I might as well tell her how I feel.' She knew Sam
wouldn't be hurtful about it no matter how weirded out she was.
`Tomorrow,' she whispered into the pillow as she slipped under the
blankets, which were as bare and lonely as she felt.</p>

<hr>

<p>"She's what?!?" Brooke gasped in disbelief.</p>

<p>"Yea, I know it's pretty sick."</p>

<p>"But..., since when?"</p>

<p>"Well, since today, I think. Who really cares when the two losers
hooked up anyway,' Nic replied as she applied her bright pink lip
gloss, smacking her lips while staring at the mirror and then turning
to address Brooke. "I'm surprised you didn't know about
Spam and Harrison considering how you've been unfortunately trapped in
that living situation with her."</p>

<p>"Come on, let's just go to lunch."</p>

<p>Sitting across the table from Nicole and staring down at her tray,
she wondered why everything had gotten so bad so quickly. `Well,
at least it can't get any worse. I mean, she won't talk to me
and she has a boyfriend. Whatever bridge that was in the process of
being constructed between her and myself has been officially torched.
I might as well keep any feelings that I might have entertained to
myself.' With a certain masochistic edge Brooke turned her head
and stole a glance at where Sam was sitting. There she was, sitting
next to that brat, Harrison. She watched as Harrison leaned in close
to Sam and murmured something into here ear, and she continued to
watch as Sam's eyes lit up and she saw her erupt with giggles. `Oh
god,' Brooke thought to herself as she clenched her jaw. Now she was
being torn in two different directions: while one part of her wanted
to stomp over there, grab Harrison by the collar, pull him outside
and beat him up, another part of her just wanted to go over to Sam,
wrap her arms around her and lay her head in the crook of her neck,
whispering that she was sorry and smelling her perfume and...
"Hello, earth to Brooke," Josh joked as he sat down and kissed
Brooke on the cheek, and then noticing who she had been staring at,
went on to ask, So I guess you've herd of Sam and Harrison?"
At the mention of Sam's name, Brooke finally started paying
attention." Oh yeah, it's great, they make a really cute
couple," she replied as she stared down at her lunch and poked at a
huge pile of red jello with her fork.</p>

<p>"Good to here you say, since we're all going on a double date
on Friday."</p>

<p>And now, it finally got worse. "What!?!"</p>

<p>Sam stared at herself in the mirror, her eyes making eye
contact with her own as she contemplated the night ahead of her.
Harrison was going to be at her house to pick her up any second, and
then he was going to take her to the movie theatre where they were
going to meet Brooke and Josh and watch Legally Blonde, some Reece
Witherspoon movie. The thought of having to spend an evening with
those two making lovey dovey eyes at each other filled her with
dread. Serious dread. Not the dread you have before sitting down in
front of a Chemistry test, but more like the dread you have before
you have to run in and save orphan children from the tenth floor of a
burning building or before you throw yourself at the rails of an
oncoming train. Without command, her mind simultaneously began
thinking of ways to get out of the date and reasons why she had to
go.</p>

<p>`Well, I could use the classic excuse of being sick, and
nausea is not that far form the truth. On the other hands, I'm
ready to go, clothes picked and put on, makeup done.' Sam had
spent
all of Thursday night at the mall with Lily and Carmen finding the
perfect outfit, the most perfect outfit that a person could by with
$72.50, which was a harder task then it looked considering her
shopping partners. Not only had Lily banned all forms of leather but
somehow she knew which stores used child labor and had banned those
too. And that, surprisingly, wasn't even the worst of it. Lily
and
Carmen had each devoted an hour to complimenting and praising her
budding relationship with Harrison by making such comments as
"Oh, you
two are sooo cute together," and "Oh my godddd, it's about
time you two hooked upp, you are the perffeect coupple." And then
of course, they had gone off to praise Brooke and Josh and the
cuteness of the double date in itself, and that was just twisting the
already very painful knife that had been implanted in he side.
`At
least it's paid off, though'. In the end, Sam was able to
find an
outfit that they could all agree on: a long bohemian skirt in blue
with green designs and a matching blue tank top.</p>

<p>`I could say that an old friend called who was very
depressed and I had to talk him out of suicide. But if I cancelled
I'd have to deal with disappointing Harrison and possible giving
Broke a sense of victory that I had been that one to back out. And
hey, the movie could be good.'</p>

<p>"Maybe I could break the Byzantine vase in the living room
and get grounded. But I have to go. I need to show Brooke that
somebody can like me and that somebody does like me, and I can act so
indifferent to her that she won't even know how much her words
hurt me.' She could hear the doorbell ring and she heard her mom
greet somebody. Applying a last coat of lipstick, Sam made up her
mind: she had gone this far, she wasn't going to give up now.
Especially because, well after all, the double date had been her idea.</p>

<hr>

<p>"There they are," Josh said, interrupting their small
conversation. Brooke and Josh were standing outside the movie theatre
waiting for the second party, and there they were. Brooke had shown
an almost scholarly interest in examining the pavement beneath her
but after a few moments she couldn't stand it and she looked over
to where Harrison and Sam were advancing. "Sam," she uttered
to herself. Sam was breathtaking, like a ray of light pushing it's
way through the storming clouds, the very image that painters have
slaved to recreate from dark studios hundreds of years ago. She was
absolutely perfect, perfect hair that was the plaything of the
petulant breeze, perfect eyes, and perfect lips. But then Harrison
stepped into the picture, linking his arm through hers, and the
perfect image shattered and freed her from the illusion that Sam was
hers and left her with the cold truth. "Hey Josh, did you ever
get Speedway IV for your Playstation 2?" Harrison asked. And
Harrison
and Josh were off, discussing and arguing which motorcycle was the
best to race with and why. "No, the Viper is heavier which
allow..." Josh argued, while Brooke had once again averted her
eyes,
and then slowly looked up and met Sam's gaze. It was so quiet
where
they stood, all the sounds seeming to fade and dull away, but inside
her head Brooke was pleading with Sam, invisible tears running down
her cheek. To see Sam with Harrison was sent a painful jolt that
resonated through her heart and stole her breath. `Sam, don't
go out
with Harrison,' she begged, `don't, he isn't good
enough for you,
nowhere near it. Just give me a chance and I'll try to be
everything,
do everything for you. I'll love you so much. Please don't,
Sam., you
could do better. Please.' All the words she wanted to say just
caught
in her throat and all she could say was "hi," which sounded
more
like a plea then a greeting. "Hello," Sam responded, her voice
normal if not tinged with ice. Inside, Brooke brought her painful
monologue to a halt. She was going to get through tonight. She
glanced at her watch and then said, "Hey guys, we should go in
now or
we'll miss the previews." After a chorus of agreement they went
in.</p>

<p>In the dark cinema, the two couples sat down, prepared to sit
for two hours in the dark room, carried away by the images displayed
on the big screen. Three quarters of the way through the movie, Josh
put his arm around Brook. Grateful for the comfort, Brooke leaned
into him. At the same time, however, she glanced over and locked eyes
with Sam. It lasted only a second, but there seemed to be a challenge
in the gaze that spoke of a little war that was going to take place.
Filled with so many emotions Sam couldn't even begin to identify,
she reached over and put her hand in Harrison's. Feeling bold, she
leaned over and kissed him on the cheek before settling back down and
once again locking eyes with Brooke. Brooke then reached up and began
to lightly kiss Josh along his neck, feeling him gasp in surprise. As
if to combat this, Sam gently but firmly covered Harrison's lips
with her own, initiating a small kiss. Brooke then laid her hand on
Josh's thigh. Sam took notice and froze. She remembered a couple
of
days ago, before the stupid fight, she and Brooke had been sitting n
the couch and had argued whether or not Ben, from Buffy, was really
good or evil. Being as opinionated as she was, Sam had begun listing
the reasons why Ben was a good guy. To get her attention, Brooke had
placed her hand gently on Sam's thigh. It had been the slightest
contact, and it had only been but for a moment, but she had felt the
heat from Brooke's hand even after Brooke had let go. The
slightest touch and it had made her feel more then she had fro
anybody else in a long time. All the walls that Sam had constructed
inside her head - the ones that had made her proved to Brooke that
somebody could like her and the walls that kept Brooke's words
for getting to close - crumbled and the horrible situation she was in
filtered through. She couldn't take it. "I, umm, have to go
to the bathroom, "She said as she quickly stood up and started
walking
out of the theater. Brooke watched her go, feeling slightly sick. She
decided it was time to stop. Time to tell the truth. "I, um, have
to go to the bathroom too,' she said as she followed after Sam.
Her
heart was pounding but she felt better then she had all night as she
opened the bathroom door. There was Sam, leaning against the counter
with both hands. As the door opened Sam looked up and Brooke could
see her face and the tear that was rolling down her cheek. Brooke
started to talk, ready to spill, but Sam cut her off. "I hate
you," she said in a voice that was like a whisper, and Brooke
stopped
in her tracks. "I hate you,' Sam repeated in a normal voice,
gathering strength. "I hate the way you make me feel when you
talk to
me, even when you just look at me. I hate the way you somehow got
under my skin, and I hate the way that I can't get you out of my
mind,
that you've managed to invade my life and my dreams. I hate the
way I
can feel so awful and somehow just seeing you makes everything feel
better." Sam's voice was trembling, but she continued,
"But most of all, I hate the fact that I can't make you love
me and I
hate the fact that I don't hate you at all."</p>

<p>Brooke felt her lower lip tremble and she felt her stomach do
slow back flips over and over as her heart pounded in her chest She
walked over to where Sam was standing and put her arms around her
from the back, resting her chin on Sam's shoulder, happy to
simply relish the warmth of Sam's back pressed against her.
Leaning in
she whispered into her ear, "I didn't mean anything I said
earlier. You are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out.
And if you would just give me a chance, I could make you so
happy."
Sam turned around, not for an instant breaking contact with Brooke
and she placed her hands on Brooke's hips. "You promise?"
she
whispered, her lips hinting at a smile. "Mmhmph," was all
Brooke
could say before Sam's lips captured hers, and she buried one of
her
hand's in Sam's hair, holding her, as the other hand played
with the
end of Sam's shirt, before Sam's soft whimpers gave her
permission
and her hand slipped inside...</p>

<p>Back in theatre, the movie had ended and Josh and Harrison were
standing next to the exit talking. "Hey Josh," Harrison
looked down shyly, "do you maybe want to go to my house and play
some Playstation or something?" Josh flashed one of his killer
smiles
and opened the door for Harrison. "I'd love too...."</p>
