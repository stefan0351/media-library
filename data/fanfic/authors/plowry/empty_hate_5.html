<!-- Empty Hate \ Part 5 -->

<p>Sam stared at herself in the mirror, her eyes making eye
contact with her own as she contemplated the night ahead of her.
Harrison was going to be at her house to pick her up any second, and
then he was going to take her to the movie theatre where they were
going to meet Brooke and Josh and watch Legally Blonde, some Reece
Witherspoon movie. The thought of having to spend an evening with
those two making lovey dovey eyes at each other filled her with
dread. Serious dread. Not the dread you have before sitting down in
front of a Chemistry test, but more like the dread you have before
you have to run in and save orphan children from the tenth floor of a
burning building or before you throw yourself at the rails of an
oncoming train. Without command, her mind simultaneously began
thinking of ways to get out of the date and reasons why she had to
go.</p>

<p>`Well, I could use the classic excuse of being sick, and
nausea is not that far form the truth. On the other hands, I'm
ready to go, clothes picked and put on, makeup done.' Sam had
spent
all of Thursday night at the mall with Lily and Carmen finding the
perfect outfit, the most perfect outfit that a person could by with
$72.50, which was a harder task then it looked considering her
shopping partners. Not only had Lily banned all forms of leather but
somehow she knew which stores used child labor and had banned those
too. And that, surprisingly, wasn't even the worst of it. Lily
and
Carmen had each devoted an hour to complimenting and praising her
budding relationship with Harrison by making such comments as
"Oh, you
two are sooo cute together," and "Oh my godddd, it's about
time you two hooked upp, you are the perffeect coupple." And then
of course, they had gone off to praise Brooke and Josh and the
cuteness of the double date in itself, and that was just twisting the
already very painful knife that had been implanted in he side.
`At
least it's paid off, though'. In the end, Sam was able to
find an
outfit that they could all agree on: a long bohemian skirt in blue
with green designs and a matching blue tank top.</p>

<p>`I could say that an old friend called who was very
depressed and I had to talk him out of suicide. But if I cancelled
I'd have to deal with disappointing Harrison and possible giving
Broke a sense of victory that I had been that one to back out. And
hey, the movie could be good.'</p>

<p>"Maybe I could break the Byzantine vase in the living room
and get grounded. But I have to go. I need to show Brooke that
somebody can like me and that somebody does like me, and I can act so
indifferent to her that she won't even know how much her words
hurt me.' She could hear the doorbell ring and she heard her mom
greet somebody. Applying a last coat of lipstick, Sam made up her
mind: she had gone this far, she wasn't going to give up now.
Especially because, well after all, the double date had been her idea.</p>

<hr>

<p>"There they are," Josh said, interrupting their small
conversation. Brooke and Josh were standing outside the movie theatre
waiting for the second party, and there they were. Brooke had shown
an almost scholarly interest in examining the pavement beneath her
but after a few moments she couldn't stand it and she looked over
to where Harrison and Sam were advancing. "Sam," she uttered
to herself. Sam was breathtaking, like a ray of light pushing it's
way through the storming clouds, the very image that painters have
slaved to recreate from dark studios hundreds of years ago. She was
absolutely perfect, perfect hair that was the plaything of the
petulant breeze, perfect eyes, and perfect lips. But then Harrison
stepped into the picture, linking his arm through hers, and the
perfect image shattered and freed her from the illusion that Sam was
hers and left her with the cold truth. "Hey Josh, did you ever
get Speedway IV for your Playstation 2?" Harrison asked. And
Harrison
and Josh were off, discussing and arguing which motorcycle was the
best to race with and why. "No, the Viper is heavier which
allow..." Josh argued, while Brooke had once again averted her
eyes,
and then slowly looked up and met Sam's gaze. It was so quiet
where
they stood, all the sounds seeming to fade and dull away, but inside
her head Brooke was pleading with Sam, invisible tears running down
her cheek. To see Sam with Harrison was sent a painful jolt that
resonated through her heart and stole her breath. `Sam, don't
go out
with Harrison,' she begged, `don't, he isn't good
enough for you,
nowhere near it. Just give me a chance and I'll try to be
everything,
do everything for you. I'll love you so much. Please don't,
Sam., you
could do better. Please.' All the words she wanted to say just
caught
in her throat and all she could say was "hi," which sounded
more
like a plea then a greeting. "Hello," Sam responded, her voice
normal if not tinged with ice. Inside, Brooke brought her painful
monologue to a halt. She was going to get through tonight. She
glanced at her watch and then said, "Hey guys, we should go in
now or
we'll miss the previews." After a chorus of agreement they went
in.</p>

<p>In the dark cinema, the two couples sat down, prepared to sit
for two hours in the dark room, carried away by the images displayed
on the big screen. Three quarters of the way through the movie, Josh
put his arm around Brook. Grateful for the comfort, Brooke leaned
into him. At the same time, however, she glanced over and locked eyes
with Sam. It lasted only a second, but there seemed to be a challenge
in the gaze that spoke of a little war that was going to take place.
Filled with so many emotions Sam couldn't even begin to identify,
she reached over and put her hand in Harrison's. Feeling bold, she
leaned over and kissed him on the cheek before settling back down and
once again locking eyes with Brooke. Brooke then reached up and began
to lightly kiss Josh along his neck, feeling him gasp in surprise. As
if to combat this, Sam gently but firmly covered Harrison's lips
with her own, initiating a small kiss. Brooke then laid her hand on
Josh's thigh. Sam took notice and froze. She remembered a couple
of
days ago, before the stupid fight, she and Brooke had been sitting n
the couch and had argued whether or not Ben, from Buffy, was really
good or evil. Being as opinionated as she was, Sam had begun listing
the reasons why Ben was a good guy. To get her attention, Brooke had
placed her hand gently on Sam's thigh. It had been the slightest
contact, and it had only been but for a moment, but she had felt the
heat from Brooke's hand even after Brooke had let go. The
slightest touch and it had made her feel more then she had fro
anybody else in a long time. All the walls that Sam had constructed
inside her head - the ones that had made her proved to Brooke that
somebody could like her and the walls that kept Brooke's words
for getting to close - crumbled and the horrible situation she was in
filtered through. She couldn't take it. "I, umm, have to go
to the bathroom, "She said as she quickly stood up and started
walking
out of the theater. Brooke watched her go, feeling slightly sick. She
decided it was time to stop. Time to tell the truth. "I, um, have
to go to the bathroom too,' she said as she followed after Sam.
Her
heart was pounding but she felt better then she had all night as she
opened the bathroom door. There was Sam, leaning against the counter
with both hands. As the door opened Sam looked up and Brooke could
see her face and the tear that was rolling down her cheek. Brooke
started to talk, ready to spill, but Sam cut her off. "I hate
you," she said in a voice that was like a whisper, and Brooke
stopped
in her tracks. "I hate you,' Sam repeated in a normal voice,
gathering strength. "I hate the way you make me feel when you
talk to
me, even when you just look at me. I hate the way you somehow got
under my skin, and I hate the way that I can't get you out of my
mind,
that you've managed to invade my life and my dreams. I hate the
way I
can feel so awful and somehow just seeing you makes everything feel
better." Sam's voice was trembling, but she continued,
"But most of all, I hate the fact that I can't make you love
me and I
hate the fact that I don't hate you at all."</p>

<p>Brooke felt her lower lip tremble and she felt her stomach do
slow back flips over and over as her heart pounded in her chest She
walked over to where Sam was standing and put her arms around her
from the back, resting her chin on Sam's shoulder, happy to
simply relish the warmth of Sam's back pressed against her.
Leaning in
she whispered into her ear, "I didn't mean anything I said
earlier. You are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out.
And if you would just give me a chance, I could make you so
happy."
Sam turned around, not for an instant breaking contact with Brooke
and she placed her hands on Brooke's hips. "You promise?"
she
whispered, her lips hinting at a smile. "Mmhmph," was all
Brooke
could say before Sam's lips captured hers, and she buried one of
her
hand's in Sam's hair, holding her, as the other hand played
with the
end of Sam's shirt, before Sam's soft whimpers gave her
permission
and her hand slipped inside...</p>

<p>Back in theatre, the movie had ended and Josh and Harrison were
standing next to the exit talking. "Hey Josh," Harrison
looked down shyly, "do you maybe want to go to my house and play
some Playstation or something?" Josh flashed one of his killer
smiles
and opened the door for Harrison. "I'd love too...."</p>
