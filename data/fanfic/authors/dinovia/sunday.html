<!-- Sunday Morning, Yellow Sky \ null -->

<p>"Be careful--" said a soft voice, only to be silenced.</p>

		<p>"Shhh!  You're gonna wake them up!"</p>

		<p>"We have to wake them anyway," replied the first voice logically.</p>

		<p>"Not yet!"</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine, awake for sometime but content to remain in the singular warmth of her bed, curled around her wife's slumbering body, opened one eye surreptitiously, hoping to see the cause of the disturbance by the door.  The sight almost made her smile but she couldn't bring herself to spoil all the work and effort that had obviously gone into the 'mission' now unfolding before her.  She quickly shut her eye and pretended to be asleep.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna Torres, wakened from a deep, restful sleep, by the tinkling of glass and an amusing conversation held in stage-whispers, opened her eyes to mere slits in order to see the procession coming through the door.  Early morning sunlight touched the 'culprits' in honeyed tones and B'Elanna had to forcibly restrain herself from grinning from ear to ear.  </p>

		<p>"Remain still, bangwi," admonished Seven, nearly inaudibly.  "You will ruin their surprise."</p>

		<p>"I'm trying!" she whispered back, making a concerted effort to relax every muscle in her body.  </p>

		<p>Mizati Nueves, 12, smirked.  She knew her mothers were awake.  But this Mother's Day celebration had largely been B'Etal's idea and she wouldn't ruin her sister's fun for all the latinum on Ferringar.  She helped the four-year-old get through the door with the unweildy breakfast tray.</p>

		<p>"Go on, Tali.  Wake them up."</p>

		<p>The little girl with the large, hazel eyes giggled.</p>

		<p>"Mama?  Sossi?  Are you awake?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna made a big production over 'waking up', smacking her lips and stretching with a long sigh of pleasure.  Seven, significantly less adept in the art of deception, merely fluttered her eyes and sat up on her elbow.</p>

		<p>"Surprise!" said Mizati and B'Etal together.  "Happy Mother's Day!"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna continued her production.  "Kahless, Seven!  Look at this!"</p>

		<p>She reached out for the tray, determined to get it before it crashed to the floor.</p>

		<p>"I am looking," Seven assured her wife.  And she was...hungrily.  Her daughters had managed to put all of her favorite breakfast foods on one tray.  </p>

		<p>B'Elanna passed the tray to Seven then turned back to the girls.</p>

		<p>"Come here, you two," she said, opening her long brown arms.  B'Etal and Mizati ran to her, accepting her fierce hug and returning it in kind.  The R&D engineer kissed them both on the forehead and pulled them up on the bed.  </p>

		<p>"You have to help us eat all this food," she said, turning her attention to the tray.  "We'll have a picnic right here, okay?"</p>

		<p>"But we have a present for you!" said B'Etal, her little brows furrowing.</p>

		<p>Seven stopped in the midst of bite of cinnamon babka.  "A present? Is this 'breakfast in bed' not considered a present?"</p>

		<p>"It is," said Mizati seriously.  "However, we determined it was not sufficient to honor mothers such as you.  Instead, we attempted to get something you specifically wanted but could not acquire."</p>

		<p>Seven and B'Elanna looked at each other and blinked.  </p>

		<p>"And what would that be?" asked Seven, her curiosity piqued.</p>

		<p>B'Etal giggled.  "You can come in now!" she yelled towards the door. Everyone turned to the entrance only to see three dozen pink and white roses enter the room...held by a grinning iCheb.</p>

		<p>"iCheb?"  Seven's voice failed her almost immediately as tears welled in her sky-blue eyes and slipped down her cheeks.  She nearly lept out of the bed to run to him.  He barely had enough time to put the roses on the table.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna blinked back tears of her own at the sight of her son, cutting an impressive figure in the blue uniform of Starfleet's science branch.  It had been almost two years since they had last seen him as he was currently assigned to a deep-space mission aboard the Bengal-class USS Hikaru Sulu.</p>

		<p>She turned a suspicious gaze on her daughters, Mizati in particular.  "iCheb's next leave isn't scheduled until October," she said narrowly.  "How did you two manage to arrange this?"</p>

		<p>Before the nervous little girls could answer, Fleet Captain Kathryn Janeway entered the room.  "They called me," she said, answering B'Elanna's question.  "Captain Tianu was all too happy to allow iCheb special leave...once I explained to her the importance of the day."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna looked from her former captain to her son to her wife back to her daughters, clearly in shock.  </p>

		<p>"Oh, you two are in so much trouble," she said, grinning lopsidedly.  "And when I figure out exactly what for, I'll be sure to let you know..."</p>
