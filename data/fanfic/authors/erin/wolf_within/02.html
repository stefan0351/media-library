<p>Buffy collapsed wearily in a chair that had been set down next to
Willow's bed. It had been a long day, what with Chris popping in and
out, giving talks to Willow on what being a Glass Walker was all
about, and fussing over the new computer he bought her. Buffy didn't
realize what a bundle of energy the young Garou could be. Then
Nichole showed up for awhile, after having closed the magick store for
the day, to check on her patient. Buffy wasn't sure what she did, or
how she did it, but the upshot of it was that Willow was almost
completely healed after she left.</p>

<p>And unfortunately Giles was little help; playing nursemaid was
apparently not his strong suit, so most of the work had gone to Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow looked at her friend sympathetically. &#34;Sorry I'm being such a
pain.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy waved it away. &#34;Don't be silly, Will!&#34; The Slayer moved from
the chair to sit next to Willow on the bed. &#34;I'm just glad that
you're almost a hundred percent. Better, even, a hundred and ten
percent.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow blushed, and dropped her eyes to the bedspread. &#34;That's
mathematically impossible,&#34; she said, smiling. &#34;I bet you'll be glad
not to have to play nurse for me anymore.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hey,&#34; Buffy said, lifting up Willow's chin until she was looking the
hacker in the eyes. &#34;Listen to me, I don't mind, ok? I'm just really
glad that you're ok. That whole thing really gave me a scare, Will.
If something happened to you...&#34; Now it was Buffy's turn to look
away.</p>

<p>Willow stared at Buffy, her eyes taking in every detail -- her
delicate profile; her mouth, so expressive in either sadness or joy;
her eyes... Willow could get lost in her eyes, and often did. She
reached out a tentative hand, and caught a few golden strands of hair
with her fingers. The light caught them, and danced across like
flames. Willow was entranced.</p>

<p>The hacker closed her eyes for a moment, and when she opened them, she
saw Buffy looking at her, her expression a mixture of wonder and
puzzlement. Willow suddenly went red, all the way to her ears. She
cleared her throat, and said, &#34;Well, I think I'd better rest now, I'm
getting a little light-headed, I think it must be the medication...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, and stood up to turn off the lights. &#34;Ok, Will,&#34; she
said, making her way to the door. &#34;Sleep well.&#34; She exited the room,
and shut the door behind her. The Slayer stood there for a moment,
trying to keep her heart from racing. Quietly, to no one in
particular, she said, &#34;You aren't taking medication.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>A short, hunched figure stood outside the door to room 214. He was
rubbing his arms as if he were cold, even though the dorm hallway was
climate controlled and quite warm. He reached out a tentative hand
and knocked. There was no answer, and the figure couldn't smell any
people inside the room either. He sighed.</p>

<p>The figure walked outside, and stood on a bench to try to see inside
the second story room. He couldn't see much, but what he could see
looked pretty much the same as it always did. Jumping off the bench,
he sat down, watching the entrance to Stevenson Hall. He had time.
He could wait.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy woke up to the sounds, and smells, of breakfast cooking. She
opened an eye experimentally, and from her vantage point on Giles'
couch she saw Willow bustling around the kitchen.</p>

<p>The Slayer stood up, shakily, rubbing her eyes. &#34;Just what do you
think you're doing, young lady?&#34; She asked, stumbling to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#34;Making breakfast for two of my favorite people in the world...not
counting me, of course,&#34; Willow replied, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#34;Aren't you supposed to be convalescing, or something?&#34; Buffy asked.
She tried to snatch a piece of cooling bacon, but Willow chased her
back with a spatula.</p>

<p>&#34;I feel too good to lay around in bed. As soon as I get the word from
Nichole, the last bandages are coming off.&#34; Willow flipped a pancake.
&#34;Could you go wake up Giles, please?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure... GILES! BREAKFAST!&#34; Buffy yelled. She busied herself with
pouring orange juice. &#34;I didn't know you were so into cooking, Will.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow shrugged. &#34;I like cooking, and my mom didn't really seem into
it, so I did a lot of cooking at home. I kinda miss living in a place
without a kitchen.&#34; The hacker even hummed a bit as she buttered the
toast.</p>

<p>Buffy raised her eyebrows, impressed. &#34;Gotta say, I'm loving the
positive attitude. You think you'll be up for some combat lessons
later?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure! A chance to learn all that punching and high-kicking stuff that
you do?&#34; Willow smiled, delighted. &#34;Just go easy on me, ok?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy chuckled. &#34;_I'm_ not the one who turns into a werewolf. You're
the one who should be going easy on _me_.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The hunched figure stared at the double doors which were the entrance
to the Stevenson Hall dorm. His eyes burned from fatigue, and he
ignored the curious looks he was getting from passersby. He hadn't
seen her all night, hadn't seen either of them; it could only mean one
thing. They weren't staying here. Not here.</p>

<p>Once that conclusion was reached, the figure rose and began walking
away briskly.</p>

<p>Not here, he thought. Not here.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;Oof!&#34; Buffy hit the floor, and started rolling. A clawed foot
slammed down onto the floor where her head once was. The Slayer leapt
to her feet and immediately executed a flawless leg sweep, sending her
opponent crashing down to the floor.</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhhhhh...&#34; Willow said, trying to stop the room from spinning. &#34;I
not do well,&#34; she said, her long snout having difficulty forming the
words.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned down at her friend. &#34;No, actually you did pretty well
for your first time. You're strong, which is definitely a bonus, and
you've got impressive natural weaponry.&#34; She walked around until she
was standing above Willow's head, and then she squatted down so that
she was looking the werewolf right in the eye, albeit upside-down.
&#34;Unfortunately, you're also a bit slow, and you're not sure how to
move. But that's what practice is for.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow looked up at Buffy, from her position on the floor. &#34;That good
I think,&#34; she said. The werewolf frowned. She discovered that in
Crinos it was very difficult to get her mouth to form words, so she
took to talking in abbreviated sentences.</p>

<p>Buffy stood, and offered Willow a hand up. Willow's clawed paw
engulfed the young woman's hand, but Buffy pulled her up with ease.
&#34;The best thing you could do is to change forms often, and live in
those forms as much as possible. You already know how your body moves
when you're human, you've been doing it for nineteen years. But your
other forms...&#34; Buffy shrugged.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, go to movies like this,&#34; Willow pointed at herself.</p>

<p>Buffy got a mental image of Willow, in full Crinos form, walking into
a movie theatre...followed immediately by screaming people pouring out
every exit. She giggled. &#34;Um, no, probably not. But the more you
spar in your different forms, the more you'll get used to 'wearing'
them.&#34;</p>

<p>The two took up positions facing each other, a few feet separating
them. &#34;Ok,&#34; Buffy said, &#34;again.&#34;</p>

<p>Mr. Hartwell,</p>

<p>I am writing to update you on recent events regarding the Lost Cub
Willow Rosenberg.</p>

<p>Contact was made with the Cub at 8:35 PM on 02/21/2000. She had
suffered serious injuries due to a recent fight with two Black Spiral
Dancers, a fight that she would not have survived if it were not for
her companion, a Slayer by the name of Buffy Summers. I will include
my impressions on the Slayer below.</p>

<p>The Cub was taken for emergency medical care to a Child of Gaia
Theurge by the name of Nichole Thompson. Our research did not turn up
the fact that she was in Sunnydale; I believe that adjustments should
be made to ensure that such important intelligence is not overlooked
again. The Theurge was able to call on spirits to aid her in healing
the Cub, and as of this writing, the Cub is completely healed from her
previously grave injuries.</p>

<p>I have begun Glass Walker orientation with the Cub, in preparation for
her coming to Los Angeles to become a full Tribe member, with all
benefits that it entails. She has shown great adeptness for computers
and modern technology, as well as a quick intelligence and a curiosity
to learn about Garou customs.</p>

<p>Her companion, Buffy Summers, is one of the Slayers that we have read
about in Human lore. She is a formidable fighter, which is proved by
the fact that she killed two attacking Black Spiral Dancers, unaided
and unarmed. She is a close friend to Cub Rosenberg, and defends her
from any possible harm. It is my estimation that she should be
cultivated as an ally, since she is already aware of the existence of
Garou, and she can be a formidible ally against the Wyrm.</p>

<p>It is my recommendation that Cub Rosenberg be kept here, in Sunnydale,
until such time as the Black Spiral threat is diminished.</p>

<p>I am investigating the possibility of setting up a Glass Walker
contingent in Sunnydale, to deal with Wyrm activity and potential Lost
Cubs. I would like to ensure that the recent incidents surrounding
Cub Rosenberg do not happen again.</p>

<p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell,</p>

<p>I read with interest your report on this Lost Cub. I am glad to hear
that she was delivered from the Black Spiral Dancers, and that she is
now recovering nicely.</p>

<p>Her companion troubles me, but if I have your assurance that she is
not Wyrm-tainted, then it will put my fears to rest. I have read many
legends about the Slayer, and that their primary purpose is to destroy
the Wyrm's minions; I trust that this is not myth, but truth.</p>

<p>Continue with your lessons to Cub Rosenberg. Unfortunately, at this
moment, we are involved in a conflict with Environ Oil, both in the
physical world, the financial world, and the spirit world. Their
Wyrm-taint reached farther than any of us realized, perhaps even back
to Pentex itself. Your skills will be missed, and unfortunately we
cannot send you any assistance in your mission. All of our resources,
however, financial and otherwise are at your disposal, as always.</p>

<p>I agree with your position about a Glass Walker contingent in
Sunnydale. Please keep me informed as to the results of your
investigation.</p>

<p>Also keep me posted, Chris, as to when you can bring the Cub back
here, to L.A.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow sat on the couch, watching Giles' little TV. The
Watcher himself had left after dinner to go to the store, muttering
something about werewolves eating him out of house and home. Buffy
pointed out that it was better than werewolves eating him, period, and
he was unable to argue.</p>

<p>Willow was very apologetic about eating so much, but everyone realized
that it was just a matter of her metabolism getting back into shape
from all that healing. When it was all said and done, Buffy and Giles
were very glad to have had Willow healed up in a matter of days for
wounds that, previously, would have taken weeks to heal, if her body
could heal them at all.</p>

<p>So the two friends were stuck at home, watching reruns of some inane
sitcom.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, it never fails,&#34; Buffy said, disgustedly. &#34;I've only seen
this show twice, ever, and each time it's the exact same episode.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think they plan it that way,&#34; Willow said, nodding sympathetically.
&#34;TV schedules do funny things. Like you know that show, 'To Be
Announced'? Well, I've always tried to see what that show is about,
but when I tune in, it's always some other show.&#34; She smiled at the
Slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned back. She didn't know what it was, but Willow always
had the ability to cheer her up, to make her forget all the bad things
lurking out there. For a Slayer, whose job was to confront all those
bad things, a friend like Willow was a godsend. &#34;You're amazing, you
know that?&#34; She asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Me, amazing?&#34; Willow said. &#34;Nah, I'm the most unamazing person out
there, pretty normal, pretty boring. Well, except for the werewolf
thing. And the witch thing. And the 'my best friend is a Slayer'
thing.&#34; She grinned. &#34;Other than that, I'm stuck solidly in
mediocrity.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Never,&#34; Buffy said softly, her eyes shining. &#34;All those other things
aside, you're exceptionally smart, exceptionally witty, and
exceptionally beautiful.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow blushed. &#34;You...you think I'm beautiful?&#34; She tried to look
away, to look down, but couldn't. She was captured by those eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;I do,&#34; Buffy replied, slowly inching closer. Her face was a mere few
inches away from Willow's, now, and the gap was closing. &#34;And I ought
to know.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why...why is that?&#34; Willow asked, her voice dropping to a whisper.</p>

<p>&#34;Because I can't stop looking at you,&#34; Buffy replied. She licked her
lips slightly and began to lean in, prepared to make vanish those last
few inches that kept her lips from meeting perfection.</p>

<p>And then it happened.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>DAMN! Buffy thought, as both she and Willow froze. I will tear this
person in half if they don't have a good reason for being here, she
thought, viciously. The Slayer stood, and made her way around the
couch to the front door. Opening it, she froze.</p>

<p>&#34;Who is it, Buffy?&#34; Willow called out, from the couch.</p>

<p>Buffy's jaw clenched.</p>

<p>&#34;Oz.&#34;</p>

<p>Oz stood on Giles' front step, his shoulders hunched and his hands
shoved in the pockets of his dusty leather jacket. &#34;Hi Buffy,&#34; he
said, in his soft, expressionless way. &#34;Is Willow here?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy glared at the young man. &#34;Why don't you just go, Oz,&#34; she said
in a low voice. &#34;Haven't you hurt Willow enough for one lifetime?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow came up behind Buffy, and touched her gently on the arm. &#34;It's
ok, Buffy. C'mon in, Oz.&#34; Her face was carefully kept neutral, as
was her tone.</p>

<p>Oz walked inside, carefully stepping around Buffy, who was still
glaring. &#34;I need to talk to you, Will.&#34; He afforded Buffy just the
barest of glances before he said, &#34;Alone.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy bristled. &#34;There's no way in Hell, Oz...&#34; she began, before
Willow intervened.</p>

<p>&#34;It'll be fine,&#34; she said, turning to face the Slayer. &#34;Go ahead and
go into the back room. I'll call if I need anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But, Will,&#34; Buffy protested. &#34;I don't--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, please,&#34; Willow interrupted. &#34;I need to do this. Everything
will be ok.&#34; She brushed a stray strand of hair back from Buffy's
forehead, her touch amazingly gentle. &#34;Please do this for me.&#34;</p>

<p>The Slayer couldn't refuse. &#34;Ok. If you need anything, yell.&#34; With
one last glare in Oz's direction, she retreated to the back room.</p>

<p>Willow turned to face Oz. &#34;Why did you come back?&#34; she said, her tone
flat. Her eyes were cold, and Oz knew that she wasn't willing to give
even an inch.</p>

<p>&#34;I came back for you,&#34; he said, looking up at her. His eyes were more
expressive than Willow could ever remember seeing, full of pain and
sorrow. Willow realized with a start that they were also bloodshot,
and underlined with dark circles. A worried look, manifesting as the
barest of lines between her eyebrows, began to appear on her face.</p>

<p>&#34;If I were that important to you, you'd have never left in the first
place,&#34; Willow replied, more harshly than she'd intended.</p>

<p>Oz dropped his eyes, guiltily. &#34;I...I had to get away.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Away from me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Away from everything!&#34; He ran a hand through his hair, irritably.
&#34;After what happened with Veruca, I didn't know who I was anymore. I
didn't know _what_ I was. All I knew was that I couldn't do that
forever. Chained up three nights a month, month after month for the
rest of my life. I escaped more times than I care to remember, and I
had only been a werewolf for a couple of years! Can you even imagine
what I was thinking the rest of my life would be like?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I have some idea...&#34; Willow said, softly.</p>

<p>&#34;So I had to get away. See if I could find some cure, or some way to
help myself. I knew I couldn't stay around here, and keep hurting the
people I loved.&#34; Oz looked up at the ceiling, his carefully
expressionless facade breaking under the stress.</p>

<p>Willow looked at him with concern. &#34;So where did you go?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Lots of places,&#34; Oz replied, wiping a hand across his sweating brow.
&#34;First to L.A. Thought I could lose myself there, but it was too
hard. Too many eyes in the city. I ended up driving out to the
desert, all the way to New Mexico. I guess I was on my way east,
maybe Texas, or New Orleans. I never got that far, though.&#34; His eyes
got very distant. &#34;I picked up a hitchhiker in the desert, someone
who recognized me as a werewolf. He told me...he told me that they
could help me. That I'd never have to be chained up again.&#34; Oz
swallowed around a lump in his throat.</p>

<p>&#34;And he taught you?&#34; Willow said, quietly.</p>

<p>Oz nodded. &#34;He brought me back to his group, taught me what being a
werewolf was all about.&#34; Oz met Willow's eyes with an intent gaze.
&#34;When I felt I knew enough, I knew I had to come back for you.&#34; He
moved swiftly, and caught Willow's arm in a firm but gentle grip. &#34;I
have to go back soon. Come with me, Willow. Back to the Caern, back
to the people who have taught me so much.&#34; He pleaded with her now;
his voice was earnest and his body started to shake.</p>

<p>Willow shook her head; she was disquieted by the intense look he was
giving her. &#34;Oz, I can't. I belong here, there's so much for me to
learn here, and so much good I can do. I'm sorry.&#34; She dropped her
gaze, rather than see the pain in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;You can't...&#34; He bit the words off abruptly. &#34;It's Buffy, isn't it?&#34;
Willow looked up at him in surprise. His face had hardened to anger,
and he spat out the Slayer's name like it was a curse. &#34;She's the
reason why you _won't_ come with me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, Oz,&#34; Willow said, shaking her head. &#34;That's not the reason. I
have things I need to learn here--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Forget about Buffy. You have to come with me, Willow. I can't be
apart from you any more,&#34; Oz said. His hand had been steadily
tightening around her wrist until it felt like a vise; it felt like it
was burning her, his hand was so hot and feverish.</p>

<p>&#34;Oz, stop,&#34; Willow said, trying to pull her arm away from his grasp.
This whole thing was too much to handle all at once; first Oz
returning, and then this manic need he had to be with her again, she
didn't understand it. &#34;Oz, stop, you're hurting me!&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was at her side in a flash, causing Willow to wonder briefly if
she had been listening the whole time. She grabbed Oz's arm, and said
fiercely, &#34;Let go or lose it, it's your choice.&#34;</p>

<p>The young man was taken aback for a moment, as if he had forgotten she
was there. He stared at her, bloodshot eyes meeting a cold gaze which
told him she meant business -- and then some. He dropped his gaze and
let go of Willow's arm.</p>

<p>&#34;I think you'd better leave. Now,&#34; Buffy said, already steering him
toward the door.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Oz just looked Willow in the eyes. &#34;I'll come
back for you, Will. We're meant to be together. You know that.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy didn't wait for her answer. She pushed him outside, not at all
gently, and shut the door. Looking back at Willow, she noticed the
redhead rubbing the arm that Oz had held. &#34;You ok, Will?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow sighed raggedly. A brief glance at the clock told her that the
entire exchange had taken just under ten minutes. Ten minutes, she
thought, it felt like ten hours. She smiled at Buffy, and said,
&#34;Yeah, I guess I'm ok. I think he just bruised me.&#34; She looked down
at the red marks on her arm from his grip.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the marks and frowned. Stepping forward, she lifted
Willow's arm so she could see the bruise in a better light. &#34;Will,
these aren't bruises. These are burns.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz walked away from the welcoming light streaming out of the windows
where Willow was staying. There'd be another time. The Slayer
couldn't be around all the time. And then he'd make her see. He'd
make her see how much he loved her, how much they were meant to be
together. She already knew; she just didn't want to admit it. He'd
make her see.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy spread some burn salve on Willow's arm. Things between them had
been subdued, to say the least, after the incident with Oz. I guess
she doesn't feel like talking much, Buffy thought. Though, I can't
say as I blame her.</p>

<p>Willow, meanwhile, had been having a hard time focusing her thoughts.
Things had finally started looking up for her; sure, she had some
strange stuff to deal with lately, but it was all going really well.
She made two great friends, both of whom were teaching her new stuff
about who she was and what she could do. And Buffy, who never liked
to leave her side, was teaching her how to defend herself. And...she
was teaching her something else, too, Willow realized. About what
best friends mean to one another. About how deep their feelings for
each other really seem to go. It was nice, and something that Willow
certainly wouldn't mind looking into further.</p>

<p>And then...Oz. Like a bolt out of the blue, he showed up just as
quickly as he had left before -- with no warning, no regard for her
feelings. She had loved him once, as deeply as she thought it was
possible to love someone. But when he showed up, she didn't feel that
same, familiar heartache. She hoped they could be friends, but...</p>

<p>&#34;All done,&#34; Buffy said, re-capping the salve jar. &#34;By tomorrow, that
should look a lot better.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I still don't know why it happened in the first place,&#34; Willow said,
worriedly. &#34;I mean, his hand felt hot, like he was running a fever,
but...&#34; She shrugged.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her friend sympathetically. &#34;Well, maybe it's some
kind of werewolf thing. We can ask Nichole about it tomorrow morning,
when she and Chris stop by.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow jumped at the change of subject, grateful for the opportunity
to lighten the mood. &#34;What's the deal with those two, anyway?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy grinned. &#34;Well, it sure looks like they love each other. I've
been subtly trying to get them to realize it, but it looks like
they're more interested in fighting.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow gave Buffy a worried look. &#34;But...they're both Garou. I don't
think they're supposed to fall in love with each other.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Buffy asked, puzzled. &#34;Is it the whole two different
tribes, Romeo-and-Juliet thing? That's been done to death. No pun
intended.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said, &#34;I think there's some rule about Garou not...you
know... 'mating' with other Garou.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; Buffy looked thoughtful. &#34;Well, I've never been keen on the
rules anyway. We'll see what happens. Now, young lady,&#34; Buffy said,
steering Willow toward the back room, &#34;You should get to bed. Long
day tomorrow.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Buffy, a smile which didn't touch the sadness in her
eyes. &#34;Um, Buffy? Could I ask you a favor?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure, Will, anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Could you stay with me tonight? That whole thing...it kinda shook me
up. I'd rather not be alone.&#34; Willow blushed, although whether it
was from embarrassment at her weakness, or excitement, she wasn't
sure.</p>

<p>Buffy threw an arm around Willow's shoulders. &#34;Sure, Will. I think I
can do that.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Nichole knocked on Giles' door promptly at eight o'clock the next
morning. Giles answered, holding a steaming cup of tea. &#34;Oh, hello
Nichole, hello Christopher. Won't you come in?&#34; He stepped back, and
allowed the two Garou to enter.</p>

<p>&#34;Hello, Giles. Is the patient up yet?&#34; Nichole asked, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, no, she isn't. I was about to check on her in a few minutes,
make sure everything is all right. I'm not sure where Buffy is,
perhaps she had an early errand to run.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, well, I'd better wake her up,&#34; Nichole said, heading off for the
back room.</p>

<p>Chris sniffed. &#34;Is that coffee?&#34;</p>

<p>Giles frowned, and looked at his cup. &#34;No, it's tea.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Could it be coffee?&#34;</p>

<p>Giles sighed, and went to the kitchen to brew a pot.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy woke up to the sound of voices in the living room. She looked
around groggily, taking stock of her surroundings. Ok, window, bed,
door, Willow lying with her head resting on my shoulder...</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>She looked down at the peacefully sleeping form, and remembered the
events of the previous night. All-in-all, it hadn't turned out too
bad, she thought, smiling. She heard the door open slowly, and saw
Nichole poke her head in. One look at the sleeping couple, and
Nichole was grinning like a Cheshire Cat.</p>

<p>Buffy frowned, and motioned Nichole out of the room with mock
ferocity. &#34;We'll be right out,&#34; she whispered, and was relieved when
Nichole nodded and shut the door.</p>

<p>Buffy looked down at Willow. She hated to disturb her, but some
things couldn't wait. &#34;Hey, sleepyhead,&#34; she said, giving the redhead
a gentle shake.</p>

<p>Willow groaned sleepily, and rubbed her eyes with the back of her
hand. &#34;Wha' 'me 's 't?&#34; She asked...sort of.</p>

<p>&#34;Eight o'clock.&#34; Buffy smiled. &#34;Time to get up, Nichole and Chris
are here.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow let out a tremendous yawn, and snuggled down onto Buffy's
shoulder. &#34;Don't wanna.&#34;</p>

<p>Ah, you're killing me here, Red, Buffy thought. Out loud, she said,
&#34;As much as I hate to say it, and believe me I do, it is time to get
up. C'mon, we can do this more tonight.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Promise?&#34; Willow looked up at Buffy, an eagerness in her eyes that
went straight to Buffy's heart and lodged there, firmly.</p>

<p>&#34;Promise,&#34; Buffy answered, somewhat breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, then,&#34; Willow said, jumping up out of bed. &#34;I get first dibs on
the bathroom!&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy stared after Willow for a moment, and then groaned and covered
her eyes with both hands. Shaking her head slightly, she whispered,
&#34;Oh yeah, you're definitely killing me, here.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Several minutes later, both young women emerged from the back and
greeted Giles, Chris, and Nichole. Nichole was smirking, Buffy
noticed, but it was a pleased, happy smirk. The Slayer shook her
head. Weird.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I'm glad to see you two look so...well rested,&#34; Nichole said,
barely suppressing a smile.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, there is something we are and it's well rested,&#34; Buffy
responded, pouring some orange juice for Willow and herself. If
Nichole could play this game, so can I, she thought.</p>

<p>Nichole decided to let it go for the moment. Turning to Willow, she
said, &#34;How are you feeling today?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Good.&#34; Willow pressed against the wounds which were now just fading
scars. &#34;Seems like everything healed up just fine.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Glad to hear it,&#34; Nichole said, walking over. She pressed against
Willow's side to make sure the wounds had healed internally, as well
as externally. Nodding in satisfaction, she said, &#34;I see no reason
not to give you a clean bill of heal--&#34; She cut herself off, staring
down at Willow's burned arm. &#34;What's that?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow followed her gaze, and lifted her arm a little. &#34;Oh, that. I
just got a little burn last night...&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole grabbed her arm, and looked at it more closely. &#34;How did this
happen?&#34; Her voice was tightly controlled, but rage burned in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;It's a long story,&#34; Willow said, bewildered at the peaceful Garou's
reaction. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You'd better tell me,&#34; Nichole said. &#34;This burn is Wyrm-tainted.&#34;</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part the Ninth</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Willow looked as if she had been struck. &#34;Wha...No, that's not
possible.&#34; She looked at Buffy for support, and Buffy just looked
back at her, sadly.</p>

<p>&#34;How did this happen, Willow?&#34; Nichole asked, her voice deathly quiet.</p>

<p>&#34;It...it was Oz, my ex-boyfriend.&#34; She felt numb, and stared at the
burn as if she could make it disappear through willpower alone.</p>

<p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Nichole asked, looking to Buffy for help.</p>

<p>&#34;Oz showed up last night,&#34; Buffy began, in a hushed voice. &#34;He had
been gone for a long time, he was off trying to deal with his werewolf
side, and yesterday he showed up on the doorstep. He and Willow
talked for a while, and then I heard Willow calling out that he was
hurting her. I ran out here, and he had grabbed her forearm and was
holding onto it. So I got him to let go, and threw him out.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;If he's Wyrm-tainted...&#34; Chris trailed off, ominously.</p>

<p>&#34;No!&#34; Willow yelled, snatching her arm from Nichole's grasp. &#34;He's
not a bad person! He was just confused, he just needed help... He said
he met someone, a hitchhiker in the New Mexico desert. That person
took him back to some place called Caern, where he taught him how to
control the change.&#34; Just like you taught me, Willow thought
silently.</p>

<p>&#34;_A_ Caern,&#34; Nichole corrected, gently. &#34;A place of spiritual power.&#34;
She and Chris exchanged glances. &#34;Only two tribes have Caerns in that
area: Wendigo, who do not allow any non-Native Americans to join
their tribe, and...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And Black Spiral Dancers,&#34; Chris finished.</p>

<p>&#34;We've got to help him,&#34; Willow said, eyes filling with tears. &#34;We
can't just let him go on with them, we've got to find some way to help
him.&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole looked at Willow, compassion and sadness evident in her eyes.
&#34;Willow,&#34; she said quietly, &#34;there's only one way to help him, and
that's to free him from his torment. Release him from this life, so
he can go on to the next.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You mean kill him,&#34; Willow said, flatly. She wiped her eyes, and
stared at Nichole angrily. &#34;I can't do that, and I won't let you do
it, either.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy stepped forward. &#34;Will, we can't let him go if he's going to go
on to hurt other people...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;He won't,&#34; Willow said, drawing back. &#34;He's not a bad person, he was
just confused. There's got to be a cure.&#34; She looked at Chris, and
pointed a finger at him accusingly. &#34;You said that Garou can renounce
their tribe. Choose another one. Well, we'll just give him the
chance to do that.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris shook his head. &#34;Willow, it isn't that easy in this case. When
a werewolf becomes a Black Spiral, voluntarily or not, they're forced
to go through a ritual which breaks their mind. It makes them insane,
and makes them _want_ to serve the Wyrm. Even if we could get through
to him, he wouldn't want to change tribes, and his Wyrm-taint is so
great that no tribe would have him anyway.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So are you going to kill me?&#34; Willow asked, brokenly. She held up
her burned arm. &#34;I have Wyrm-taint on me, too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Chris replied slowly, &#34;We can cure that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So why can't you cure Oz?&#34; Willow was starting to shake now, but
whether it was from remorse, fear, or anger no one could tell.</p>

<p>&#34;Because there's no way to remove the Wyrm-taint from a Black Spiral
Dancer,&#34; Chris replied, losing his patience. &#34;Even if we wanted to,
we just can't cure them!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We can't,&#34; Nichole interrupted, softly. &#34;But there might be beings
that can.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris looked at Nichole, sharply. &#34;That's insane, you're talking
about...&#34; He threw his hands up in the air in disgust.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm talking about the Gurahl,&#34; Nichole finished.</p>

<p>Willow looked from Nichole, to Chris, and back again. &#34;You know
someone who can help us?&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole shrugged. &#34;I don't know, but if anyone can, they can.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This is ludicrous!&#34; Chris exclaimed. &#34;Even if we can _find_ a
Gurahl, and even if we can get them to talk to us, there's no
guarantee that they'll actually help us.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the Garou, puzzled by the conversation. &#34;What's a
Gurahl?&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole sighed. &#34;Everyone should take a seat. This is a long story.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;A long time ago, long before the Wyrm was corrupted, all beings lived
in peace with one another. There were many different kinds of
were-folk back then. The Garou, or werewolves, were not the only
members of the Changing Breeds; many other races straddled the line
between animal and human.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Nuwisha, or Werecoyotes. Tricksters all, they forced
us to question our ways through the use of pranks and practical jokes.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Corax, or Wereravens. They were the spies and
messengers of the Changing Breeds.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Bastet, or Werecats. As cats do, they watch and
protect, and have an insatiable curiosity for knowledge and secrets.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Ratkin, or Wererats. They were the shepherds of
mankind, both protecting the cities from the Wyrm, and holding check
on the human population to make sure it didn't get out of control.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Moloke, or Werealligators. They protected the swamps
and deepest jungles from harm.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Rokea, or Weresharks. As the Moloke did in the
swamps, the Rokea protected the deep oceans from harm.</p>

<p>&#34;There were the Anasasi, or Werespiders. Servants of the Weaver, they
were the builders of the Changing Breeds.</p>

<p>&#34;And there were the Gurahl, or Werebears. Perhaps the Changing Breed
that was closest to Gaia, the Gurahl were peaceful folk who grew adept
at healing the land, the other Breeds, and each other. Their skill
grew so great that it was said that they knew the secrets of life and
death, and could raise creatures from the dead using their Spirit
Gifts.</p>

<p>&#34;There were many other Changing Breeds as well, and all lived together
in peace.</p>

<p>&#34;Then the Wyrm became Corrupted, and began sending His minions out to
destroy life, to bring it under His dominion. The Changing Breeds
worked together for awhile, and enjoyed great success in their fight
against the Wyrm. The Garou were Gaia's warriors, the Corax were Her
spies, the Bastet were Her guardians, and the Gurahl were Her healers.</p>

<p>&#34;And then came the War of Rage.</p>

<p>&#34;Few know how it started. Legend has it that the Garou, particularly
the Silver Fang Tribe which ruled over the others, demanded that the
other were-breeds bow to them, and obey their orders in the war
against the Wyrm. After all, the Garou were Gaia's chosen warriors,
it seemed only right that the other breeds obey.</p>

<p>&#34;But they didn't see it that way, of course. The other breeds
refused, and the Garou, believing that if the other breeds turned
against them they must be allies with the Wyrm, began to war against
the other were-folk.</p>

<p>&#34;It was our darkest time. We lost many of the advantages and gifts
that we had received from our peaceful co-existence with the other
breeds, and many innocent were-folk on all sides were needlessly
slaughtered. All because the Garou could not contain their Rage, nor
their vanity.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Nichole fell silent; the others sat stock-still. Finally, Buffy broke
the silence. &#34;I guess the Garou haven't always been the
happy-go-lucky pups you are now, huh?&#34;</p>

<p>Chris snorted. &#34;Still aren't. There are still a lot of us that can
think of nothing else than building up their own renown, or capturing
power however they can, even if it means flirting dangerously close to
the Wyrm. The Garou have made a lot of stupid moves over the years,
and the War of Rage was just one of them.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So these Gurahl, these werebears, can help us?&#34; Willow said, quietly.</p>

<p>Nichole shrugged. &#34;It's possible. After the War of Rage, the Gurahl
withdrew from the world, hiding themselves away in remote locations
where they wouldn't be bothered by man or Garou. They are peaceful,
though, and I doubt they would hurt you if you went looking for one.
I can't tell if they'd help you or not, but they probably wouldn't
hurt you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Forget it.&#34; Chris shook his head, vehemently. &#34;There's no way.
Willow is far too young and untested a pup to go searching for a
Gurahl. And what if the Black Spiral comes back? Are we supposed to
tell him, 'Oh, just take a seat there, Willow will be back shortly to
make everything better.' He'll try to kill us. The only thing we can
do is put him down--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Listen, you bastard,&#34; Willow said, teeth clenched. &#34;You're talking
about my friend, the person who at one time I was in love with. If
there's anything at all I can do to help him, I'm going to do it. And
if you try to stop me, it will be _your_ tribe that I'm going to
renounce.&#34; Ignoring Chris's shocked look, she sat back, arms folded
across her chest.</p>

<p>Nichole stepped between the two before Chris's Rage could kick in.
&#34;Ok, listen. Chris, you know as well as I do that every pup has to
undergo a quest before they receive the Rite of Passage and become a
full member of the tribe. I can't think of a better or more useful
quest right now, to be perfectly honest.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris opened his mouth to speak, and then closed it again. He
couldn't argue with the truthfulness of her words.</p>

<p>Nichole relaxed a bit. &#34;I can speak with the Wyld-spirits in the
area, see if I can get a general location on the closest Gurahl.
After that, it will be up to Willow.&#34; She turned to face the young
redhead. &#34;Generally, the quest is given to an entire pack of Garou,
but you are just one lone person. I don't think it's unreasonable for
you to take at least one other person with you, for assistance.&#34; She
shot Chris a look, but the Glass Walker just nodded.</p>

<p>Willow glanced at her best friend. &#34;Buffy?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded immediately. &#34;I'd go anywhere with you, Will.&#34; She
glanced over at Giles. &#34;Think you could handle patrol for a couple
weeks?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think so, yes,&#34; Giles answered. &#34;I'll get Xander and Spike to help
me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, then, it's settled,&#34; Nichole said, with some satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#34;Not so fast,&#34; Chris said, sourly. &#34;What happens if laughing boy
shows up?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We're going to have to capture him until we return,&#34; Buffy said,
matter-of-factly. &#34;How do you deal with prisoners among your kind?
I'm assuming you don't kill them _all_.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris gave Buffy a sarcastic look. &#34;We use a fetish, which is a
magical talisman that has had a spirit bound within it. It's a pair
of manacles which traps the wearer in Homid form, making him both
weaker and easier to manage. I could, presumably, have a pair here by
tomorrow morning if I tell them to FedEx it Priority.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Modern technology, gotta love it,&#34; Buffy remarked. &#34;Ok, then, sounds
like we've all got a plan.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy sighed, closing the door behind Nichole after she left. &#34;Well,
that was a lot of fun,&#34; she remarked.</p>

<p>Willow smiled crookedly, rubbing a pink spot on her arm. That was the
only evidence left that there had once been a bad burn there; Nichole
had healed the Wyrm-taint, and new skin began to grow in its place.</p>

<p>&#34;Will, I gotta ask you,&#34; Buffy said, slowly walking toward her friend.
&#34;This whole thing with Oz...Is it really worth it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't, Buffy.&#34; Willow shook her head. &#34;You of all people should
understand. Oz is our friend...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, but he's evil now. He doesn't even remember our friendship, or
he doesn't care. He doesn't want to be helped, and we may not even be
able to help him.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe we can't,&#34; Willow said, earnestly. &#34;But we can't sit here and
do nothing. He needs our help whether he asks for it or not...
Whether he knows it or not.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But, Will, we may have no choice--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;If we don't have a choice, then we'll kill him!&#34; Willow said, looking
Buffy in the eye, her expression angry. &#34;Or have you forgotten Angel?
We didn't stop looking for a way to give him back his soul, even
though we thought maybe it wasn't possible. Even though he killed the
people we loved, and sent some of us to the hospital.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy winced, Willow's harsh words opening up old wounds. She dropped
her head, and said quietly, &#34;I know, Will. I'm the one who tried to
kill him, who sent him to Hell even after he got his soul back,
remember?&#34; She turned abruptly and walked to the window, looking out
on the sunlit lawn beyond, her expression unreadable.</p>

<p>Oh, God, Willow thought, that was uncalled for. She walked up behind
the Slayer, and gently rested her hands on Buffy's shoulders. Her
friend immediately stiffened under her touch. &#34;I'm sorry, Buffy.
I...I didn't mean for it to sound like that. I'm scared.&#34; Her head
drooped, and she rested her forehead against Buffy's shoulder. &#34;A
part of me wishes that Oz hadn't come back, that I could go on
thinking he was ok, that he was just out there, somewhere, doing his
own thing. But he did come back, and I have to help him. I don't
love him anymore, but he is a part of my life, and rightly or wrongly
I feel some responsibility.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy turned and wrapped her arms around Willow, drawing her into a
close hug. The redhead, not expecting this act of forgiveness, of
love, began crying with relief. Shoulders shaking, she allowed Buffy
to tighten her grip around her.</p>

<p>&#34;Shhh, it's ok, Will,&#34; Buffy said, quietly. &#34;I understand. And don't
worry, I'll help you no matter what happens.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow smiled, and wrapped her arms around the Slayer. &#34;Thank you,&#34;
she whispered.</p>

<p>Buffy kissed the top of Willow's head, and said, &#34;Guess we got some
planning to do, huh? I'm not sure what to pack, I've never been the
outdoorsy type.&#34; She moved one hand up under Willow's chin and lifted
her head up so she could see her face. Gently brushing away her
tears, Buffy swallowed around the lump in her throat that had formed
from seeing her friend's beautiful, tear-stained face.</p>

<p>Willow looked up and met Buffy's eyes with her own. Those eyes...
they mesmerized her, made it impossible for her to feel sad, or alone.
They were eyes that said, you have nothing to fear, I'll always be
here for you. &#34;You always support me, Buffy,&#34; she whispered. &#34;Even
though I don't always deserve it. You've always been there for me.&#34;
She reached up a tentative hand, to cup Buffy's cheek. Buffy's
eyelids closed slowly, and the Slayer leaned into the caress. &#34;I love
you, Buffy.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes, and looked down at her best friend, the person
she loved more than any other. &#34;I love you too, Willow.&#34; Whether she
leaned down or Willow reached up, no one could tell, but at that
moment their lips met.</p>

<p>The kiss was gentle and tentative, as if neither one were sure that
this is what the other wanted. Willow brought her hands up, cupping
the back of Buffy's head, deepening the kiss. Buffy, in turn, brought
her arms around Willow's waist, holding her closely to her. Long
moments went by, moments where nothing else in the world existed for
the pair except each other.</p>

<p>Finally, they broke the kiss. Foreheads touching, each young woman
noticed the labored breathing of the other. As one, they smiled.
Speech became unnecessary, and superfluous.</p>

<p>Willow took Buffy's hands in her own, led her into the back bedroom,
and closed the door.</p>

<p>Chris entered the Dream of Gaia magick shop, his black &#34;Will Write
Code for Sex&#34; t-shirt, black jeans, and trenchcoat setting him off
from the rest of the store's clientele. He made brief eye contact
with Nichole, who was at the counter helping a customer. Some New Age
nut-job, he thought. Just like Nichole. Unconsciously, a smile crept
over his face.</p>

<p>&#34;Is this Lavender Oil synthetic, or essential? I need real essential
oil, no synthetic,&#34; the customer was saying. Nichole just kept
nodding, and making affirmations.</p>

<p>He wandered over to the book section and was simply amazed at how many
books had the words &#34;Celtic&#34;, &#34;Atlantis&#34;, or &#34;Pyramid&#34; in the title.
If I could write a book on the Celtic Pyramids of Atlantis, I'd make a
fortune, Chris thought.</p>

<p>Finally the last customer left, somewhat satisfied. Nichole walked
over to Chris and exhaled wearily, brushing her bangs back from her
forehead. &#34;Whew!&#34; She exclaimed, &#34;If I don't see another person who
needs aromatherapy questions answered, it will be too soon.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris quirked an eyebrow at the woman. &#34;Yeah, I guess I don't realize
how lucky I am, being in the software business. Most of _our_
customers are sane.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't make fun,&#34; Nichole replied, poking Chris in the arm. &#34;Besides,
you're one to talk about their beliefs. You've seen spirits all over
the place, and if someone called you a nut you'd be very offended.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's true,&#34; Chris admitted. &#34;But the difference is, I know I'm
right. I don't know that they're right.&#34; Nichole sighed in
exasperation. &#34;Speaking of spirits,&#34; Chris continued, &#34;have you had
any luck?&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole nodded, somberly. &#34;The best I could do was a general
direction and distance. I don't know how much good it's going to do
the girls, though.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris shrugged. &#34;Impossible to say until they find out for
themselves. Anyway, I held up my end. The manacles will be here by
tomorrow morning, latest.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I still can't believe we're doing this,&#34; Nichole said, shaking her
head. &#34;I mean, the Children of Gaia tribe is about as loving and as
understanding as they come, but it never even occurred to us to try to
reclaim a Black Spiral. It's just never been done.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;All the Garou tribes consider it a more efficient use of resources to
kill a Black Spiral, rather than take the time and effort into trying
to 'rehabilitate' them,&#34; Chris replied, matter-of-factly. &#34;We are
fighting a war, after all.&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole frowned. &#34;Maybe that's the problem, maybe we've been going
about it the wrong way.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, if they can do it, they'll be legends. Their names will go
down in the Silver Record. But to be honest...&#34; He trailed off.</p>

<p>&#34;You don't think they can.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris shook his head. &#34;No, I don't.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow looked at the woman dozing next to her, hair spread out on the
pillow like fine golden threads. She smiled; in sleep, Buffy was just
as beautiful as when she was awake. Here, lying in one another's
arms, they were completely at peace. All the worry lines faded, and
their eyes, which reflected the remembered pain which came from years
fighting on the Hellmouth, were untroubled. When Buffy was awake
though, she lost the peacefulness, but gained a vitality, a strength
of purpose about her which could not be ignored. It was that strength
of purpose and courage in the face of vampire and teenage foes alike
which drew Willow to the Slayer in the first place.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you sure you want to do this?&#34; Buffy had asked, as they lay down
together. Willow knew that the question grew out of a deep concern
for the hacker's well-being; Buffy would lay down her own life before
she'd do anything to hurt her friend.</p>

<p>She didn't reply, she just captured the Slayer's lips with her own.
They were so gentle, so tentative at first; light touches left trails
of fire across their skin, skin which was sensitive and ached to be
touched. There was no rush, though; it had taken them four years to
get to this point, and there was an unspoken decision to take their
time and enjoy every detail, every moment they had together.</p>

<p>Knowing what awaited them lent a sense of immediacy to their act.
This is what Buffy must feel like every day, Willow thought, knowing
that within hours, maybe, they could be fighting for their lives.
Willow had always been careful to try to stay out of harm's way
before; she was the witch, the hacker, the person who helped
behind-the-scenes. The fighting she left to her best friend. Not
anymore.</p>

<p>&#34;Mmmm...&#34; Buffy murmured, shifting closer to Willow and draping an arm
across the redhead's stomach. The redhead, in turn, began tenderly
stroking the Slayer's hair. Buffy opened an eye experimentally. &#34;So,
it wasn't a dream. I really am in bed with the most beautiful woman
on earth.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know about you,&#34; Willow replied, kissing the Slayer gently,
&#34;but I know I am.&#34; She looked over at the alarm clock. &#34;I suppose we
need to get up and get some practicing in today.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I thought we already did,&#34; Buffy said, with a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>&#34;Not that kind of practicing,&#34; Willow responded with a smile. &#34;I
think we need to get up, it's already mid-afternoon.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Mid-afternoon? How long have I been asleep?&#34; Buffy asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#34;Ten minutes.&#34; Willow grinned. &#34;We were just...ah...we were occupied
for a long time.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy sat up and looked at the clock. Her eyebrows shot up.
&#34;Apparently a three-hour long time.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You don't hear me complaining.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy stepped out of the shower and began toweling off. It was a good
workout, she thought. Willow was a fast learner, smart and didn't
flinch away from taking or giving a hit. The Slayer heard the phone
ring faintly from the living room.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll get it!&#34; Willow yelled. She was already showered and dressed,
so she ran to the phone to answer it. &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hi Willow!&#34; Willow immediately recognized Chris's cheerful voice from
the other end. &#34;Got a sec?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Willow replied, nodding to Buffy who had just entered the
room, clad only in a couple of Giles' fluffy white towels. It's
Chris, she mouthed to the Slayer, who nodded in reply.</p>

<p>&#34;Nichole has a pretty good lead on where you guys can find a Gurahl,
so she's going to map it out tonight and talk to you guys about it
tomorrow. I made some phone calls, so those manacles for your ex
should be arriving by FedEx, mid-morning tomorrow. Got it so far?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow nodded. &#34;Gurahl, manacles, gotcha.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Great. Now, the only problem is that Oz will probably try to come
after you tonight. Unless you make yourself scarce, you risk a deadly
confrontation, and I'm sure you don't want it to come down to kill or
be killed, right?&#34; The tone in his voice sounded more like 'Please
tell me I'm wrong,' but Willow ignored it.</p>

<p>&#34;No, I don't want that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok then. You, Buffy, and Giles have to get out of that house.
You're going to be staying at 431 Hemingstone Road. It's a motel.
I've made arrangements for you under the names Ann Heston and Robert
Young, got it? Now, you can't take a car straight there; don't forget,
you'll be tracked by someone who has all the senses of a bloodhound,
so you've got to confuse your trail. What you're going to do is take
the 311 bus to Market Street. At Market Street, transfer to the 116.
Take the 116 to Myers Road, at Myers Road get off the bus and walk
three blocks north to the bus stop there, where you will pick up the
78. The 78 will let you off right out on Hemingstone Road. Got it?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow furiously wrote all this down on a pad of paper. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, read it back to me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;All right, we're going to be staying at a hotel on Hemingway Street,
and we're going to take the 911 bus to Market Street.&#34;</p>

<p>She paused, and heard nothing but silence on the other end.</p>

<p>Finally, Chris said, &#34;I'll be right over.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow, Giles, and Buffy stepped off the number 78 bus. Giles took
his first deep breath since they began their little trek almost an
hour ago. &#34;Ah, public transportation. I had forgotten the joy,&#34; he
remarked mildly.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at the sign. &#34;Motel 6?&#34; She remarked incredulously.
&#34;Chris is some big, rich, powerful Glass Walker, backed by some big,
rich L.A. syndicate, and we're staying at a Motel 6? Oh he is so in
trouble.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;He mentioned something about being low profile,&#34; Willow said with a
shrug. &#34;Anyway, Giles is registering under the name Robert Young, and
for tonight I get to be Ann Heche.&#34; Willow frowned, and double
checked the paper Chris gave her.</p>

<p>&#34;You can say that again,&#34; Buffy mumbled, stifling a grin.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, Ann _Heston_. What was that, Buffy?&#34; Willow asked, arching an
eyebrow.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing!&#34; Buffy flashed a winning smile at the redhead. &#34;C'mon Ann,
c'mon Robert. Let's go.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow turned up the TV. She was trying to concentrate on the show,
but Buffy, who was chafing from being cooped up, was being
distracting.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't believe I can't even go out on patrol,&#34; she was saying,
pacing back and forth rapidly.</p>

<p>&#34;He doesn't want any of us to run into Oz,&#34; Willow replied, for what
seemed like the tenth time.</p>

<p>&#34;It would just be a little patrol. I miss the night air,&#34; Buffy said.
She stopped walking, and leaned up against the room's only table.
Idly, she tore a piece of paper off the notepad, and began folding it.</p>

<p>Willow looked at her sympathetically. &#34;I know you don't like to hide
like this, but it's only for one night. Once we get those manacles
we'll go looking for Oz, and see if we can capture him.&#34; She frowned
as a paper airplane bounced off her forehead. &#34;Surely there's
something else you could be doing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're right,&#34; Buffy replied. She walked over to stand in front of
Willow, who was sitting on the room's one queen size bed. Crouching
down, she practically straddled Willow's knees as she took the TV
remote from nerveless fingers. She clicked off the TV.</p>

<p>&#34;Wha...did you have in mind?&#34; Willow said, her breathing becoming
increasingly rapid.</p>

<p>Buffy leaned forward, her mouth close to Willow's ear. &#34;I thought I'd
make love to the woman I love, my best friend,&#34; she whispered. A jolt
of electricity went through Willow's body, causing her to gasp.
&#34;Unless you had a better idea?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow shook her head slightly. &#34;I was going to suggest a couple of
diet sodas and a rerun of ER, but I like your idea better.&#34; Buffy
flicked out a tongue, barely brushing Willow's earlobe. &#34;I _so_ like
your idea better,&#34; Willow added.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>A dark figure approached the house with trepidation. He couldn't
smell anyone, but their scent lingered in the air as if an
afterthought. He looked in the front window cautiously, and saw no
one inside; the house was dark. His eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>Rough, calloused hands grasped the door handle and shoved; the door
splintered and flew open. The figure entered the house, and looked
around, often emitting a loud, sniffling noise.</p>

<p>They were gone. They left again. _She_ left. She was hiding from
him.</p>

<p>Oz left the house, and caught the scent she left on the breeze. East,
the scent told him. He went East.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Willow lay in each other's arms, drowsing sleepily. Happily
too, I might add, Buffy thought. This whole thing with Oz, the
werewolves, all of it would be so worth it even if the only thing to
come out of it was their love for each other.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you, Willow,&#34; Buffy said, somewhat impulsively. The words
always gave her a warm feeling, but not quite as warm as when Willow
said them back to her.</p>

<p>&#34;Mmm, I love you too, Buffy,&#34; Willow replied, snuggling down closer to
the Slayer. Moments later, her breathing became low and regular.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, and allowed herself to follow Willow into sleep.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz stood, confused. The scent had told him East, and had led him to a
bus stop. He couldn't tell, though, which bus had been taken, or
where they had ended up. He growled through sheer frustration.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, buddy,&#34; Oz turned toward the source of the voice, a man dressed
in a shabby peacoat. The man had his hand out, palm up. &#34;You got any
spare change for the bus?&#34;</p>

<p>Oz grinned at the man, teeth bared. If the man didn't know better,
he'd swear that the kid's teeth were pointed. Oz's black eyes were
back-lit by a bright green flame.</p>

<p>The man immediately backed off. &#34;Uh, I think I'll walk. Better yet,
I think I'll ask Mr. Nice Policeman over there for some change.&#34; The
man backed away, almost running toward the police car driving slowly
down the street.</p>

<p>Oz's eyes narrowed as the police car approached, and he stepped back,
losing himself in the shadows.</p>

<p>The black Range Rover sped down the road, its occupants enjoying the
comfort only afforded by a high-price SUV. Or, at least, they would
be if they could be said to be enjoying themselves at all.</p>

<p>&#34;For the last time, no, there is no way you're playing that Arlo
Guthrie crap on my stereo,&#34; Chris growled, taking a right turn a bit
too quickly.</p>

<p>Nichole grabbed onto the door handle to try to keep herself upright.
&#34;And you would rather listen to that...that...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Techno, yes, I would. My car, my stereo, my music,&#34; he replied,
irritably. He glanced over at Nichole, his smile sardonic. &#34;Get
yourself a VW van with an 8-track and a tie-dye paint job, and you can
play whatever music you want.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You never had a problem with my music when we were in college,&#34;
Nichole grumbled.</p>

<p>&#34;Only because I always got stoned before I had to listen to it,&#34; Chris
replied, pleasantly.</p>

<p>Nichole opened her mouth, prepared to deliver a blistering retort,
when Chris pointed straight ahead. &#34;Looks like the lovebirds are here
already.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow stood outside the Dream of Gaia, waiting patiently.
Chris had called them that morning, and told them that he had received
the manacles from Los Angeles. They arranged to meet at the Dream of
Gaia so that they could discuss tactics.</p>

<p>Chris parked the car and he and Nichole jumped out, Nichole with a
FedEx box under her arm.</p>

<p>&#34;Morning!&#34; The Child of Gaia said, cheerfully. &#34;I see the two of you
are looking well.&#34; She winked briefly at Willow before unlocking the
door.</p>

<p>Willow blushed slightly, and replied, &#34;Um, yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No thanks to Mr. Cheapskate's travel arrangements,&#34; Buffy replied
sardonically, with a glance in Chris's direction.</p>

<p>Chris shrugged. &#34;Take it up with Accounting,&#34; he replied with a small
smile. &#34;I'm a werewolf, not a sugar daddy. By the way, where's
Giles?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. &#34;I don't even want to know why you made that
connection,&#34; she said. &#34;He went back to his house to check on
things.&#34; The four friends entered the store, locking the door
securely behind them.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles stepped over the ruins of his front door, grimacing at the mess
left by some nightly visitor. There was little actual damage done to
any of his belongings, but whoever searched the house last night
wasn't tidy. The ex-watcher slowly righted a small table, stacking
the cordless phone and the base unit on top.</p>

<p>&#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>

<p>The strained, gravelly voice startled Giles, and he turned slowly
toward the source. Oz stood in the hallway leading to Willow's room,
his already short frame hunched over, as if in pain. His eyes burned
with unhealthy obsession.</p>

<p>&#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>

<p>His voice was louder now, and Giles noticed Oz's body beginning to
shake. &#34;N-now Oz,&#34; he said, in what he hoped was a soothing voice,
&#34;she-she's not here.&#34; He began inching his way slowly toward the open
doorway.</p>

<p>&#34;WHERE IS SHE!&#34;</p>

<p>Oz took a step forward now, his hands clenching and unclenching. His
form began growing, slight limbs covering over with fur and knotted
muscle.</p>

<p>Giles turned and started running.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;They look like handcuffs.&#34; Buffy looked at the manacles, turning
them over in her hands. &#34;Are you sure this will hold a werewolf?&#34;
The only things that seemingly distinguished the manacles from a
regular pair of handcuffs were the etched runes that decorated the
sides. That, and the fact that the manacles were made of pure silver.</p>

<p>Chris nodded. &#34;They're what we call a fetish, an item that is fused
together with a spirit to imbue it with power. Stick those puppies on
a werewolf, even in Crinos form, and he'll instantly turn to Homid.
They grow or shrink to match the form the werewolf wears, and they're
stronger than they look.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I hope so,&#34; Buffy replied. She looked over the manacles one last
time, and then stuck them in her jacket pocket. &#34;It's my guess that
Oz will go right for Willow when he sees her, making her the bait in
this trap. Sorry, Will,&#34; Buffy said, with an apologetic look at the
redhead.</p>

<p>Willow shrugged with a resigned sigh. &#34;It's got to be done, I mean,
I'm the one who wants to help him,&#34; she replied quietly. Buffy placed
a comforting hand on her shoulder, and Willow reached up and entwined
Buffy's fingers with her own. She drew strength from the contact,
strength she knew she would need before the day was out.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, when Oz goes after Willow, I use the distraction to get in there
and slap the cuffs on him. Seems straightforward enough,&#34; Buffy
finished.</p>

<p>&#34;What do we do with him when we've got him?&#34; Nichole said,
uncertainly. &#34;I mean, he's dangerous, even assuming we can keep him
under control, it won't be easy.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy tightened her grip on Willow's hand unconsciously. &#34;We'll just
have to find that Gurahl werebear and get back as quick as possible.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So, it sounds like the only thing left to do is track down Oz,&#34; Chris
said, looking around the room for agreement.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles had almost reached the open doorway when he felt a large, clawed
hand with a grip of steel grab the back of his neck, wrenching him
backward. How can something that big move that fast, he thought
wildly before crashing into the recently-uprighted table. Giles
looked up into the mad eyes of the Black Spiral Dancer.</p>

<p>&#34;You tell me,&#34; the werewolf said slowly, wrapping his hand around
Giles' throat, &#34;where she is.&#34;</p>

<p>Giles felt himself hoisted aloft, dangling from the werewolf's massive
paw. His hands clutched futilely at the Dancer's arm, trying to
relieve some of the pressure on his throat. At this rate, he thought,
he wouldn't be able to tell Oz even if he wanted to. The ex-watcher
felt himself growing increasingly light-headed.</p>

<p>Some part of Oz's brain that was still rational must've realized that
Giles could never talk if he were being choked. He dropped Giles to
the floor, where the older man took in great gulps of air. &#34;I-I don't
know where she is,&#34; he gasped, &#34;but I can get her to come here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do it.&#34; Oz snarled.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;These Black Spiral Dancers seem to be a little more comfortable
coming out at night, than during the day, right?&#34; Buffy asked, looking
to the more experienced Garou for confirmation. Nichole nodded back
at her. &#34;Ok, then, so maybe Willow and I should go on patrol tonight,
as usual. If Oz shows up, we try to subdue him the best we can.&#34;
Chris's cell phone rang, and she briefly glanced over at him as he
walked over to the corner of the room to answer it.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you think we'll be able to do this without hurting him?&#34; Willow
asked. Her voice begged for reassurance from the more experienced
Slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles, what's going on?&#34; The urgency in Chris's voice caused the room
to fall into deathly silence.</p>

<p>&#34;Tell Willow that she needs to come to my house. It's very important
that she gets here as soon as possible. Pull her out of Dance class
if you need to.&#34; The call cut off before Chris could ask Giles what
he meant.</p>

<p>&#34;What's wrong?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Chris frowned. &#34;That was Giles. He needs Willow to go over to his
house right away.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow glanced at Buffy, puzzled. &#34;Think he found out something?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged. &#34;Possible, though I didn't think he had any research
planned.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris cocked his head to one side, favoring Willow with a quizzical
look. &#34;I didn't know you had a Dance class.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow stepped across the remains of Giles' front door, her eyes
adjusting quickly to the lack of sunlight indoors. What she saw made
her freeze.</p>

<p>Giles was sitting in a straight-backed chair, his arms rigidly at his
sides. Behind him stood Oz, in full Crinos werewolf form, one hand
wrapped securely around Giles' neck, the other hand resting on the top
of the ex-watcher's head.</p>

<p>Willow swallowed nervously. &#34;Oz, please don't do this...&#34; She forced
herself to take a small step forward.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you alone?&#34; Oz said, his growls and snarls understandable by
Willow alone. &#34;If you brought anyone with you, I might just have to
snap his neck like a twig.&#34; He tightened the grip he held on Giles'
head, and laughed shrilly.</p>

<p>Willow shook her head. &#34;I came alone. I was looking for you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;LIAR!&#34; Oz roared, letting go of Giles and taking a step toward the
redhead. &#34;I came for you last night, and you were gone! You weren't
here!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow's eyes shifted nervously, his sudden movement startling her.
&#34;I-I was afraid, Oz. But I realized this morning that I needed to
talk to you, to see you. That's why I'm here, that's why I came
alone. I want to help you.&#34;</p>

<p>Oz took another, shuffling step toward her. He held out his hands to
the young woman. &#34;I don't need help, I only need you. Now that we're
together, we can go back to the caern. There are a lot of people
there who want to meet you.&#34; He grinned, his eyes lighting up with
madness. &#34;You'll enjoy serving the Wyrm.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow involuntarily took a half step backward. &#34;Oz, you don't have
to work for the Wyrm. I can help you--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No!&#34; He growled, lurching forward and grabbing Willow's arms. &#34;The
Wyrm wants you--&#34; He stopped, sniffing the air suddenly. He whipped
his head around, looking toward where Giles sat. But Giles was no
longer there; Buffy was.</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry Oz-man,&#34; Buffy said. She stood next to the empty chair, and
began walking slowly, circling the werewolf. &#34;We couldn't let you do
it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;YOU LIED TO ME!&#34; Oz roared, turning back to fix Willow with a
hate-filled stare.</p>

<p>Willow immediately shifted into Crinos, breaking Oz's grip on her
arms. &#34;You're not the only werewolf here, Oz. And I'll never serve
the Wyrm.&#34;</p>

<p>Oz backed up a step, trying to keep both Buffy and Willow in his view.
Something about Buffy's scent puzzled him, though, something which
smelled awfully like...</p>

<p>He froze suddenly and looked at Willow, his eyes practically glowing
with green balefire. &#34;You...&#34; He spat out the word as if it were a
curse. &#34;You and she are...are mates.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow glanced over at a puzzled Buffy, who had been unable to
understand the Garou language. &#34;Oz...&#34;</p>

<p>Oz fixed his gaze on the Slayer. &#34;You took her from me,&#34; he said, his
voice deadly quiet. &#34;You stole her from me!&#34; He roared, bursting into
a frenzy of action. He leapt at the surprised Slayer who fell back
and brought her feet up, tossing Oz off of her with a heave of her
legs. She fumbled in her jacket pocket, and readied the manacles in
her hand.</p>

<p>Oz twisted in midair, landing in a crouch. He immediately sprang
again and this time landed a solid punch to Buffy's stomach, sending
her flying back into the upended furniture. The manacles flew out of
her hand, sliding across the hardwood floor.</p>

<p>He was on her in a second. &#34;You...will...die...slowly...&#34; he said,
punctuating each word with heavy punches that Buffy was barely able to
absorb. Dizzily, she dropped her arms, no longer able to lift them to
protect herself.</p>

<p>Oz pulled back his fist, ready to drive it into Buffy's skull.
Suddenly, he felt his wrist grabbed from behind. He pulled against
the grip, only to find that it was like iron, slowly pulling his arm
back. He roared, and looked up at his attacker.</p>

<p>Willow stood above him, grabbing his other wrist with her other hand,
and began pulling that one back as well. She planted a knee with
bone-jarring force into the small of his back, and began pulling his
arms back until he screamed with the pain of tendons and joints pulled
to their limit. His pain-filled eyes met Willow's rage-filled ones.</p>

<p>&#34;You ever, ever touch her again, and I will rip your arms out and beat
you to death,&#34; she said, her voice at once cold and furious. She felt
a small, human hand on her shoulder, and she stiffened.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you still want to capture him?&#34; Chris asked, quietly. He held the
manacles that Buffy had dropped, though he seemed reluctant to stop
Willow from killing the young Black Spiral.</p>

<p>Willow took a deep breath, feeling the Rage drain out of her. Seeing
Oz threaten Buffy like that had triggered something deep inside her,
the Rage that Chris and Nichole had told her about. She wasn't
fighting for the safety of mankind, or Gaia; she was fighting for
Buffy, the woman she loved, and it touched something so primal that
she didn't even know it existed.</p>

<p>She nodded sharply, and after a small hesitation, Chris snapped the
manacle on Oz's wrist.</p>

<p>Immediately, his form shifted back to that of the young man Oz was,
and maybe could be again. Chris took Oz's arms from Willow's grasp,
and handcuffed them behind his back. His head drooped, overcome by
the calming, weakening magick of the fetish. Chris dragged him over
to the side of the room, rather ungently.</p>

<p>Willow dropped next to Buffy, shifting back to human form as she did
so. &#34;Buffy?&#34; She asked, her voice shaking.</p>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes and smiled slightly. &#34;Yep, that's me,&#34; she
said, holding on to Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm so sorry,&#34; Willow said, her eyes shedding bright tears. &#34;I would
have never...If I'd known you would get hurt...It's not worth it...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, and squeezed Willow's hand. &#34;It's ok, Will. He just
knocked the wind out of me.&#34; She felt her ribs, pressing them with
tentative fingers. &#34;Couple of cracked ribs maybe, some bruises.
Nothing that won't heal in a few days.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow let out a breath she wasn't aware of holding. &#34;Oh, God, Buffy,
what if...&#34; She began, tears running unchecked down her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Shh,&#34; Buffy said, pushing herself up. She brushed her fingers gently
across Willow's cheeks, wiping away her tears. &#34;Shh, it's ok, Will.
It's over, we got him, no real harm done. You can't think about what
may have happened, ok, because there's no point. Everyone's fine,
except for maybe Oz, who almost got his arms ripped out of their
sockets. I didn't realize you would go all Terminator, Will.&#34; Buffy
grinned at her friend.</p>

<p>Willow smiled in return. &#34;I...I couldn't let him hurt you,&#34; she said
simply.</p>

<p>&#34;Just one of the many reasons why I love you,&#34; Buffy replied, raising
Willow's hand to her lips. Willow blushed, and squeezed Buffy's hand
a little tighter.</p>

<p>Nichole cleared her throat. &#34;Everyone ok here?&#34; she asked, Giles
standing behind her.</p>

<p>&#34;Everyone's just peachy keen here,&#34; Buffy responded, wincing as she
tested sore muscles.</p>

<p>&#34;I can probably do something to help those bruises,&#34; Nichole said,
helping Buffy and Willow to stand. &#34;If you'll let me, I can heal you
much the same way I did Willow.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I wouldn't say no,&#34; Buffy agreed. She glanced over to where Oz sat,
watched over like a hawk by Chris. &#34;So what now?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Chris is taking Oz to a 'safe house' that his 'syndicate' owns here
in Sunnydale,&#34; Nichole replied, her distaste for the Glass Walker's
methods evident. &#34;Then we'll need to meet, and plan your trip.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well,&#34; Giles said, cleaning his glasses with a handkerchief.
&#34;You don't suppose we could fit 'returning my home to a proper
semblance of order' in there anywhere, could we?&#34;</p>

</table>

<p>Buffy collapsed on the couch, letting out an exhausted sigh. After
Nichole healed her of her injuries, she felt like she could have
easily slept for a week; but she would've felt guilty for sticking
Willow with all the work of cleaning up Giles' house. Giles was out
arranging for a new front door.</p>

<p>Willow collapsed on the couch next to her. &#34;Well, that was a chore,&#34;
she said, wiping sweat from her forehead.</p>

<p>&#34;Yep.&#34; Buffy nodded. &#34;Next time we invite homicidal werewolves over
for lunch, I think we should move the party to the backyard.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Speaking of which,&#34; Willow said, &#34;well, not homicidal werewolves, but
werewolves anyway, Nichole and Chris aren't back yet?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Doesn't appear so. He said they had a lot of stuff to pick up to
help us with the trip.&#34; Buffy chewed on her lip, absently.</p>

<p>Willow rested her hand on Buffy's leg. &#34;Worried?&#34; She asked, thinking
she knew why Buffy was nervous.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy said, covering Willow's hand with her own. &#34;It's
just...I dunno, I'm not the outdoorsy type, you know? It's one thing
to wander around a graveyard for a few hours, and then wander back
home to sleep in your own bed. It's another thing to wander around
the woods with no idea where you are or what you're looking for,
exactly.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You could...I mean, if you don't want...&#34; Willow began.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. &#34;No, I want to help you. I told you I'd go
anywhere with you, right? I'm just a little concerned, I guess.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;There's no reason to be, sweetcheeks,&#34; Chris said, flippantly. He
stepped through the doorway, a large cardboard box in his hands.
&#34;Nichole and I have thought of everything.&#34; He dropped his box on the
kitchen counter, and helped Nichole set hers on the floor.</p>

<p>&#34;So what do we get,&#34; Buffy said, rising stiffly from the couch.
&#34;Tents, sleeping bags...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Chemical toilets?&#34; Willow finished, hopefully. Hey, it was better
than the alternative.</p>

<p>Chris scoffed. &#34;Please, you're a Glass Walker, none of that 'roughing
it' stuff for you. Some tribes send their cubs out into the
wilderness with just a swiss army knife; not us, though.&#34; He bent
down, and pulled out an amulet. It hung on a leather thong, and was
covered with runes which Buffy mistook at first for claw marks. Chris
tossed it to Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;And what does this do?&#34; Buffy said, looking at the amulet closely.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, since it would take way too long to hike through the mountains
to find this Gurahl--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Waitaminute,&#34; Buffy interrupted with surprise. &#34;Mountains? How far
away is this werebear, anyway?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Um,&#34; Nichole looked at her feet. &#34;Well, they tend to be secretive,
and there aren't many of them left...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Where?&#34; Buffy urged.</p>

<p>Nichole mumbled something. Willow blinked in surprise. &#34;The Cascade
mountains?&#34; She said, her eyebrows nearly disappearing into her
hairline. &#34;Aren't those in Washington?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Washington, Oregon, Northern California, parts of British
Columbia...&#34; Nichole corrected.</p>

<p>Buffy sat down with a thud. Luckily, there happened to be a chair
nearby.</p>

<p>&#34;But like I was saying,&#34; Chris interjected, &#34;it would take way too
long for you two to travel there, so you're going to be traveling
through the Umbra.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The what?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;The spirit world. Our people use it a lot for travel, for communing
with spirits, for fighting the spirit bane allies of the Wyrm, that
sort of thing,&#34; Chris said. &#34;Willow, you can travel there naturally,
as part of your Garou heritage; we'll teach you how tomorrow, before
you're ready to leave. But Buffy is going to have to use that amulet.</p>

<p>&#34;While you're in the Umbra,&#34; he continued, &#34;you won't get hungry or
thirsty. All your body functions will be suspended. Once you get
close to your destination, just come out into the physical realm.&#34; He
dug through his box and began pulling out equipment.</p>

<p>&#34;Where is our destination?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Besides a mountain range, I
mean.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I marked it on a map,&#34; Nichole said, handing a large wilderness map
over to Willow. &#34;I was able to narrow it down to a general location,
no more than four square miles or so.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's comforting,&#34; Willow responded, faintly.</p>

<p>&#34;Also, just in case, Chris and I picked you up some supplies.
Backpacks, some powerbars, water...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;...Cell phone, and Global Positioning System,&#34; Chris finished, with a
grin. &#34;Just in case you get lost.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Um, won't we be somewhat outside cell phone radius?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>Chris held up the object in question. &#34;It's a fetish, just like the
manacles. It's powered by spirits, so you don't need to worry about
range or batteries.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked on, impressed. &#34;You should really market those things.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;If I could figure out a way to mass-produce these, believe me I
would,&#34; Chris replied, regretfully. &#34;But since they require binding
spirits, they have to be made one at a time.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Looks like you guys have thought of everything,&#34; Willow said, playing
with the GPS.</p>

<p>&#34;Everything except how to actually find the Gurahl,&#34; Nichole said.
&#34;That's up to you.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Thraxuil paced the room, unable to believe his ears. This pup, this
Lost Cub was still loose; he had lost two warriors to her already, and
now he seemed to have lost a third. He turned to face the kneeling
Garou. &#34;What happened to him?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The spirit banes were vague,&#34; Kraxthus responded. &#34;He's not dead;
the banes were able to find him, but he is unable to respond to them,
unable to change form, and unable to escape into the Umbra.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I see.&#34; His calm voice belied the rage that leapt to his eyes. &#34;I
will not fail the Wyrm because of one little girl.&#34; You are a
failure... That inner voice, silent for so long through his string of
successes in leading this Hive of Black Spirals, began to surface once
again. He shook his head wildly, trying to stop the voice. You've
failed your Hive mates, you've failed the Wyrm, and you've failed
yourself, it said. It's only a matter of time before they find out,
and then you die... The fearsome werewolf known as Eater-of-Children
doubled over in pain, clutching his head.</p>

<p>&#34;M...my lord?&#34; Kraxthus asked, fearfully.</p>

<p>Thraxuil whirled around at the noise and knocked Kraxthus down to the
ground, massive clawed hands wrapped around his throat. &#34;STOP!&#34;
Thraxuil screamed, right into Kraxthus' face. &#34;I won't fail the Wyrm!
If we can't bring the cub here, then she will die!&#34; With one last,
bone-crunching squeeze, the werewolf rose to his feet, panting
heavily. &#34;A pack,&#34; he said, already thinking of his next plan. &#34;I
will send a whole pack after her. Kraxthus, tell the Hellfire Dancers
pack that I wish to see them.&#34; When Kraxthus didn't answer, the
werewolf turned, eyes finding the cooling body on the floor.
Sightless eyes bulged out of their sockets, staring blankly at the
rough-hewn ceiling.</p>

<p>Thraxuil backed up slowly, eyes searching the room. It certainly
wasn't the first time that one of his minions had turned up dead in
his throne room; he just wished that he could discover who the
murderer was, before he was next. &#34;Show yourself!&#34; He yelled, and
like the other times, there was no response.</p>

<p>Eater-of-Children growled, swallowing the paranoid fear he was
feeling, and walked out of the throne room. He would find the
Hellfire Dancers himself.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow looked around the back room at the Dream of Gaia, which was lit
only by early morning sunlight streaming in from the small window.
She shifted nervously, and felt Buffy's hand slip into hers, steadying
her.</p>

<p>They were as ready as they'd ever be, she thought to herself. They
had made sure to get a good night's sleep last night...eventually.
They had all their gear -- hiking boots, durable clothing, parkas, and
their backpacks which contained all the gear Nichole and Chris had
brought them the day before. Giles assured them that he could handle
patrols until they returned.</p>

<p>Nothing left to do, Willow thought with a stifled grin, except travel
through the spirit realm to the Cascade mountains, find a werebear,
and ask his advice. Oh, is that all.</p>

<p>Nichole brought out a large, dusty object which was covered with a
cloth tarp. It looked like a picture frame. When she removed the
cloth, Willow saw that it was actually a large, framed mirror.</p>

<p>&#34;You will be traveling through the spirit realm,&#34; Nichole said, her
normally light voice now serious. &#34;A mirror reflects our physical
realm, but distorts it. Similarly, the spirit realm is a reflection
of our own physical realm, but it too is distorted. The only way for
a Garou to step into the spirit realm is to step into, and _through_
the mirror.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow stepped up to the mirror, letting her fingertips touch the
cold, hard glass. &#34;But...it's solid.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You don't actually have to walk through the mirror,&#34; Chris said,
glancing at Nichole. &#34;That's hyperbole. You use the mirror to shift
your perceptions so that your natural abilities as a Garou take over.&#34;
He glanced over at Buffy. &#34;You are going to have to do this too.
That amulet will take the place of natural ability.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow stared at the mirror, seeing her own reflection and the
reflection of the room behind her. Her eyes unfocused, turning the
reflection into a barely distinguishable blur. Something pulled at
her now; instead of a mirror in front of her, she felt like it was a
doorway, beckoning her to step through.</p>

<p>Buffy saw Willow take a step forward, and vanish. Her eyes widened,
and she looked at Chris in shock.</p>

<p>Chris merely nodded, as if he expected it. &#34;Now, your turn.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow looked around the unfamiliar landscape; there was just too much
to see, all at once. She felt lightheaded, like that strange detached
feeling she sometimes got when she was on heavy cold medication.</p>

<p>The sky itself was dark, although she knew it was daytime. Was it
still daytime? She wondered. But the landscape itself glowed, as if
from an inner energy. She looked around her, and realized that the
building that surrounded her was partly translucent. Everywhere, she
saw creatures -- they could only be spirits -- some zipping around
where telephone and electricity wires should be; some floating through
the air; and some, in the shapes of spiders, weaving pattern webs
around the buildings and any spirits slow or unlucky enough to get
caught.</p>

<p>And, most shocking of all, she could _see_ pollution. Everything that
Chris told her about the Wyrm, and Gaia...nothing had prepared her for
this.</p>

<p>She saw black, oily, dripping smog spirits drifting through the
streets, coating everything and everyone they passed with taint. She
looked down, through the translucent floor to where the city sewer
system ran. Small, hideous spirits ran through the tunnels. They
were covered in boils which periodically burst, dripping toxins onto
the ground around their feet.</p>

<p>She took a step back, hand covering her mouth in horror. She felt a
hand on her shoulder, and she jumped.</p>

<p>&#34;Whoa, everything ok?&#34; Buffy asked, concern in her voice.</p>

<p>Willow grabbed on to Buffy, wrapping her arms around her waist and
holding her in a close hug. She buried her face against Buffy's
shoulder, tears filling her eyes. &#34;God, don't you see them? They're
everywhere, drowning everyone in poison...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy stroked Willow's hair gently. She looked around, her eyes
seeing the spirits that Chris and Nichole always talked about. Some
of them were quite beautiful, but others were disgusting and seemed
bent on corruption. It made her ill to see the toxins that permeated
the air she breathed, and probably the water she drank and food she
ate as well.</p>

<p>&#34;Now you know why we fight the Wyrm,&#34; Chris said quietly, appearing
next to them. Nichole appeared a moment later. &#34;If humans could see
what we see, there'd never be another debate about pollution, or clean
air.&#34; He sighed, looking at the spirit world around him.</p>

<p>Nichole fixed Willow with a sympathetic gaze. &#34;This is the choice all
Garou must make -- to fight for Gaia, or ignore Her suffering at the
hands of the Wyrm. As you can see, for most of us it's not very much
of a choice at all.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow raised her head, and pushed back from Buffy's shoulder. She
cleared her throat, and scrubbed away the tears with the back of her
hand. So this is what the Wyrm really is, she thought. Not just the
mad violence of the Black Spirals, but the slow suffocation of the
world, burned and choked and drowned in poison. How could she hope to
fight it all? She thought with despair.</p>

<p>By fighting one Wyrm-creature at a time, she realized. By healing
those she could, and destroying those she couldn't, so they wouldn't
do any more harm. And she knew right where to start. There was
suddenly more at stake here than Oz's life -- the real contest was
over his soul.</p>

<p>&#34;All right,&#34; she said, gritting her teeth. &#34;Let's get started.&#34;</p>
