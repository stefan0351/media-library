<p>&#34;And it came to pass in those days that the Brothers and Sisters of
Bear, called Gurahl, heard the pitiable cries of the new creature,
Man; and in response to his pleas for help, they allowed Man to hunt
the Bear, and take Bear's flesh for food, and his skin for clothing.</p>

<p>&#34;And when Man slept, the Brothers and Sisters of Bear would steal into
Man's cave and take back the clean bones of Bear. For the Great
Mother had taught them the secret of Life and Death, and they knew
they could make Bear live again for the next hunt.</p>

<p>&#34;But while they were performing the Rite, the youngest of the Skin
Changers, Garou, came upon them. And he hid, and he saw the miracle
of Bear rising again from death. And he said to himself, 'The Great
Mother has given Gurahl the secrets of Life and Death, and Gurahl has
not shared them with us. Surely this is wrong.' And so Garou came to
the Brothers and Sisters of Bear, and demanded this secret from them.</p>

<p>&#34;The Gurahl looked at Garou sadly, and said, 'You are impulsive, and
full of Rage, not Wisdom. You would not use the secret in a matter
fitting of the Great Mother. If you have wounded, bring them to us to
heal; if you have dead, bring them to us to raise. But we cannot give
you the secret.' With that, Garou went back to his kind, and in a fit
of Rage, told them, 'The Gurahl are conspiring with the Wyrm against
us. The Great Mother has given them the secret of Life and Death, but
they refuse to share it with us. Surely this goes against the Great
Mother's wishes!' And so the Garou were driven into a great frenzy,
and decided to make war upon the Brothers and Sisters of Bear.&#34; --

<p>Nichole removed some ash of some sort from a pouch at her waist.
Sprinkling it to let it float on the breeze, she said, &#34;I ask Your
assistance, Luna, Celestine of the Moon, Sacred Guide. Light the way
for these travelers, and know that they serve Your will, and that of
Mother Gaia.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow's attention was drawn downward, to the ground at her feet. A
long, silvery road stretching off to the north began appearing there;
after a moment or two it solidified, a ribbon of silvery moonlight
hugging the ground.</p>

<p>&#34;Stay on the road,&#34; Nichole cautioned. &#34;It will be safest. You'll
travel fast with the spirits of Luna guiding you.&#34; She undid the
pouch at her waist, and pressed it into Willow's hand. &#34;When you are
ready to return, do what I did, and the spirits will come to you. You
have the gifts of a Theurge, one who communes with spirits, as I do.
Born under the crescent moon, you pierce the darkness of inner and
outer mystery. Gaia guide you on your journey.&#34; With that, she
stepped back, and Chris stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#34;I've taught you a lot over the past few days, but now you have to see
some things for yourself. Good luck, Willow.&#34; He bent down to hug
the redhead. Pulling back, he handed her a small mirror in the form
of a compact. &#34;For when you want to leave the Umbra and come back.&#34;
He brushed her cheek with the back of his hand, eyes memorizing her
features. &#34;Gaia bless you,&#34; he said, and turned away. Stepping up to
Buffy, he hugged her as well. &#34;Good luck. Keep each other safe.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded, and looked at Willow. &#34;Ready?&#34; Willow nodded, and with
one look back at the two Garou, she and Buffy stepped on the silver
road, and began their journey.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Chris and Nichole emerged from the Umbra, back to the incense-laden
storage room of the Dream of Gaia. Chris let out a long breath.
&#34;Well, I guess I'd better get back to laughing boy,&#34; he said, grabbing
his jacket.</p>

<p>Nichole smiled. &#34;I'll come over after I close the store and give you
a hand. I bet he's not exactly the best company.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You got that right.&#34; Chris rolled his eyes. Nichole chuckled, and
he looked down at the Gaian fondly. Quickly, impulsively, he bent
down and kissed her tenderly on the cheek. Blushing, he cleared his
throat. &#34;Well, I gotta go,&#34; he said, and practically sprinted out the
door.</p>

<p>Nichole, hand touching her cheek, looked after him with a bemused
expression.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Chris entered the house, throwing his keys and his jacket on a side
table. He opened up a drawer in the same table, removing a Glock 17.
He removed the clip, checked the silver 9mm rounds within, and pushed
the clip back home. He stuck the gun in his jeans at the small of his
back, and went to go check on his prisoner.</p>

<p>Oz lay on the floor of the converted bedroom listlessly, wrists
handcuffed to a large ring set in the floor. His untouched, and now
very cold, breakfast still lay within reach.</p>

<p>&#34;What's the matter, aren't hungry?&#34; Chris asked, picking up the plate
and tossing the food in the garbage. &#34;How about some TV then?&#34; Chris
walked over and collapsed in a leather recliner, grabbing the TV
remote. &#34;I think they might be showing 'Old Yeller'.&#34; He looked over
at Oz, whose eyes were staring ahead, unfocused. &#34;I hope you realize
what that girl is doing for you. Otherwise, you'd be facing a death
sentence.&#34; Receiving no response to this, Chris snorted disgustedly
and turned up the TV.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Nichole walked up the street toward Chris's 'safe house', her coat
wrapped tightly around her to ward off the chill. An ever-increasing
sense of dread had settled around her ever since she watched Chris
leave, until finally she closed the store early and hurried over to
see him.</p>

<p>The bitter wind whipped around her, reminding her more of an autumn or
winter wind than early spring. She shuddered, and walked faster.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Chris heard Oz move for the first time in hours, shifting, stretching,
testing his handcuffs. &#34;It won't do you any good,&#34; he replied to the
restless Black Spiral. &#34;You'll never break those things in your
condition.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I wouldn't bet on that,&#34; a deep, grumbling voice answered from behind
Chris. In a split second, Chris was out of his chair, Glock pointed
directly at a Black Spiral in full Crinos who had materialized out of
the air behind him. Damn! Chris thought fiercely, he must've come out
of the Umbra!</p>

<p>The Black Spiral, eyes flashing sickly green, regarded Chris with
amusement. His eyes flicked over to where Oz lay, pulling on his
handcuffs so hard that his wrists grew slick with blood. &#34;Little
Garou, did you think you could just hold one of ours without
consequence?&#34; The Spiral laughed, a guttural sound.</p>

<p>&#34;Go to Hell,&#34; Chris said, raising the gun. Suddenly, he felt a hard
blow to the back of his head, knocking him across the room, into the
opposite wall. He fell to the ground with a moan, gun dropping from
his hand.</p>

<p>&#34;You first,&#34; an insane voice giggled. Chris raised his head, looking
at the Black Spiral that had hit him. This one looked more jackal
than wolf, his fur falling out in large patches to reveal sickly-white
hide beneath. His form shifted into Homid, and he picked up the gun
which was laying just outside Chris's reach.</p>

<p>Another Black Spiral who had just materialized from the Umbra walked
over to Oz, and grabbed the handcuffs which bound him. The silver
burned his Crinos hands, filling the room with the smell of singed fur
and flesh, but the werewolf didn't even flinch. With quick, strong
movements he broke the lock on each cuff and let go, allowing the
handcuffs to fall to the floor. Oz rose slowly, free from his
bondage.</p>

<p>&#34;Now, I think our business is almost complete. Once we track down the
little cub and strangle her with her own intestines, that is.&#34; The
first Black Spiral laughed madly, pleased at his own joke.</p>

<p>Chris growled, pushing against the wall to raise himself to his feet.
&#34;Over my dead body, Wyrm-lover,&#34; he spat, glaring at the lead Spiral.</p>

<p>&#34;That's the idea,&#34; Jackal giggled, and he raised the gun, pointing it
at Chris's chest.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Nichole practically ran up the front walk, terror seizing her now.
She tried the front door, which was locked, so she was about to bang
on the door to get Chris's attention when she heard the gunshots from
inside. Before she realized it, she had shifted into Crinos and
knocked aside the strong front door like it was made of balsa.</p>

<p>She rushed into the back bedroom just in time to see three Black
Spirals disappear into the Umbra, followed closely by Oz. A
semi-automatic pistol lay on the ground, barrel still smoking from
use. Her eyes went immediately to the collapsed heap of a man against
the wall.</p>

<p>Heart frozen in fear, she ran over to Chris, feeling for a pulse.
&#34;Thank Gaia,&#34; she breathed, feeling his pulse strong under her
fingers. Turning him over, she inspected his chest, looking for
bullet wounds.</p>

<p>Chris sat up, coughing heavily. &#34;Damn,&#34; he gasped. &#34;That wasn't
fun.&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole saw two bloodless bullet holes in his shirt, and she looked at
him alarmingly. Chris followed her gaze to the wounds, and shrugged,
wincing as he did so. &#34;Damn Black Spirals ruined another shirt,&#34; he
said, pulling his shirt off stiffly. Under his shirt he wore a thin,
yet strong and flexible, bulletproof vest.</p>

<p>Nichole sat down with a thud. &#34;Chris,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;I don't
want you to ever let me complain about your love of technology again.&#34;</p>

<p>Chris smiled slightly, wincing at the pain in his badly bruised chest.
&#34;Deal.&#34; He looked up at Nichole suddenly, fearfully. &#34;They're...
they're going after Willow and Buffy.&#34;</p>

<p>Nichole buried her face in her hands, holding back tears. &#34;We can't
interfere with a Passage quest, Chris.&#34; She swallowed around the lump
that formed in her throat. &#34;The best we can hope for is that the
Spirals won't be able to track them.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow was still adjusting to Umbral travel; it was odd, walking on
the road that Nichole had created for them. It acted like a moving
sidewalk, assuming moving sidewalks moved at 60 miles per hour; they
could walk on it, and the landscape appeared to be moving by much
faster than it would normally.</p>

<p>She wasn't sure how long they had been walking, or even if time really
mattered here.</p>

<p>Buffy seemed to find the Umbral landscape fascinating, her eyes
capturing every detail. She was stunned by the sheer number of
spirits that seemed to interact with the physical world, and in turn
had the physical world interact with them.</p>

<p>Gradually, the cities and suburbs gave way to thin forests. Even
here, in the midst of the 'wilderness', the pollution banes existed;
smog banes latched on to tree spirits, who were unable to shake their
poisoning influence. Toxic banes corrupted water spirits, who in turn
corrupted animals who came to drink. Willow was sickened.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh, Will,&#34; Buffy said, interrupting her dark thoughts. &#34;You notice
anything strange?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;In this place?&#34; Willow laughed, more harshly than she intended.
&#34;Wouldn't it be better to ask if I _didn't_ see anything strange?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's just it,&#34; Buffy said, chewing her bottom lip thoughtfully.
She hoisted her backpack a little higher on her back, and she said,
&#34;Where are all those weird little nature spirits? It's like they just
up and disappeared.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow looked around, alarmed. They were traveling through a dark,
rather spooky section of forest. Buffy was right; this place should
have been teeming with life, but it was silent.</p>

<p>Just then, a mad, piercing howl broke the quiet and caused both girls
to shudder.</p>

<p>&#34;Um, I think we should get moving,&#34; Willow said, increasing her walk
to a trot. Buffy followed suit, easily keeping up with the faster
pace. She looked around, trying to spot the source of the howl.</p>

<p>In the brush off to the left of the silver road, Buffy spotted
something keeping pace with them; whatever it was was big and it paid
no heed to the dense underbrush which should have slowed it down.
Crashing noises could now be heard off to their right as well, made by
similar, shadowy figures.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow...&#34; The two girls heard a hauntingly familiar voice emerge
from the darkness, cutting through it like razor claws. &#34;Willow, I've
come for you...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oz!&#34; Willow gasped, looking at Buffy wildly.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded, casting glances at the shadowy figures who still managed
to keep up with them on either side of the road. &#34;And he's brought
friends. C'mon, Will, run!&#34; The Slayer said, breaking into a full
run, and checking to make sure Willow kept up beside her.</p>

<p>The two girls ran for all they were worth, landscape flashing by,
barely discernable. A mad chorus of howls let loose then, and the
chase was well and truly on.</p>

<p>&#34;And so the Garou made war against the Gurahl, the Brothers and
Sisters of Bear. In their anger they invaded our dens and slaughtered
our Kinfolk, expecting them to have been corrupted by the Wyrm, who we
call Pattern Breaker. The Gurahl fell in great numbers before the
claws of the Garou; for they fought in packs, not alone as we did, and
they fought with a ferocity that had been gifted them by the Great
Mother to use against the Pattern Breaker.</p>

<p>&#34;And so a Great Council was held of the few Gurahl who remained. It
was decided that the Rage of the Brothers and Sisters of Wolf was too
great, and that if the war continued it could only spell doom for our
people.</p>

<p>&#34;Many of the Gurahl, in sadness, decided to disappear to the furthest
reaches of the world, and could only be found on the remotest
mountain, the furthest glacier, or the most distant river. Most chose
to cross the great Ice Bridge and dwell in the Pure Lands with their
nomadic Kinfolk; some chose to secret themselves in far-off dens, and
fall into centuries-long slumber. Still others gave up their physical
form, choosing to allow their spirits to travel to the Summerland, to
live with the Great Mother.&#34; -- From the tales of Artur
Mountainwind, Gurahl Tale-Spinner</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow ran, her blood pounding in her ears. Next to her, Buffy ran
hard, looking from side to side to check on the progress of their
shadowy pursuers. From the mad howls that erupted from time to time,
the Spirals were not only keeping pace, they were enjoying the terror
of their prey.</p>

<p>&#34;How are they keeping up?&#34; Willow gasped out. &#34;The spirits...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head, tossing sweaty bangs from her face. &#34;Maybe
they've got spirits helping them too.&#34; They ran hard for a few
minutes more before Buffy said, &#34;We can't keep this up, Will. We've
got to get out of the Umbra, try to lose them in the real world.&#34; The
girls slowed, then stopped on the silver road, panting with
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Buffy watched as their pursuers, four Black Spirals including Oz,
emerged from the shadows. They moved slowly now, sensing certain
victory over the two young women. They grinned and laughed, howled
and giggled, and closed in tightening the trap.</p>

<p>&#34;C'mon, Buffy,&#34; Willow said, shoving the mirror in front of her face.
Buffy concentrated for a moment, and disappeared from the Umbral
landscape. A moment later, Willow joined her in the moonlit forest of
the physical world.</p>

<p>&#34;How much you want to bet they brought mirrors too,&#34; Buffy said, still
catching her breath. &#34;We gotta get outta here, post haste.&#34; Willow
nodded, and they picked a direction and started running through the
woods. The air was colder here, and it felt good against Buffy's
sweat-slicked skin as she ran. She winced as she realized they were
leaving a trail a mile wide for the Spirals to follow.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, look,&#34; Willow said, tugging on her arm to get her attention.
&#34;See that light? It's a campfire, I can smell it!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Great, Will,&#34; Buffy said, tiredly. &#34;But what are we going to do,
lead the Black Spirals right to a bunch of soon-to-be-unhappy
campers?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Willow said, dejectedly. &#34;I thought, maybe...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's worth checking out, at least,&#34; Buffy said, giving Willow's hand
a squeeze. &#34;C'mon.&#34;</p>

<p>They slowed down, and crept to the edge of the firelight. A large,
grizzled man sat in front of the fire, his back against a fallen log.
He had no tent or camping gear that either one of the girls could see,
but he had somehow managed to skin and spit a rabbit, which was at the
moment roasting merrily over a crackling fire.</p>

<p>The friends looked at each other, trying to decide what to do, when
the man called out in an Irish brogue, &#34;Come on now, I know yer out
there. May as well step forward in peace, or step forward an' get
ready to fight. Either way, decide quickly, my rabbit's almost done.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy and shrugged resignedly. She stepped forward,
and said, &#34;Um, sir? I'm sorry to bother you. My friend and I will be
on our way, but there are some very dangerous...animals...around here,
and we wanted to warn you about them.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Dangerous animals, eh?&#34; the Irishman asked. &#34;I've handled a few of
'em in my day.&#34; He held out a large hand for Willow and Buffy to
shake. &#34;M'name's Finian, by the way.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow shook his hand, and gasped at the electric contact. &#34;You...
you're Garou,&#34; she said, incredulously.</p>

<p>Finian gave Willow an appraising look. &#34;Aye, of the proud tribe of
the Fianna. An' you are Garou as well, Glass Walker from the look of
ye.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How did you know?&#34; Willow asked, looking at Buffy askance.</p>

<p>Finian chuckled. &#34;No other Garou would come out here with such
trappings of the Weaver,&#34; he said, pointing at their backpacks. &#34;And
who are ye, miss?&#34; he asked, with a sideways glance at the Slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;My name is Buffy,&#34; she said, &#34;I'm not a werewolf, but I'm a friend of
Willow's.&#34; Buffy liked the old man instantly. Well, not old, she
thought, he was probably around Giles' age. Old enough.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, my greetings to the both of ye,&#34; Finian said. &#34;So, what are
these dangerous animals ye were talkin' about?&#34; As if to punctuate his
words, the three heard the hair-raising sound of Black Spirals on the
hunt. &#34;Oh,&#34; the Irishman said, raising an eyebrow. &#34;I see.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's a long story,&#34; Willow said, quickly. &#34;But there are too many to
fight, and we need to get away...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, well lass, you're in luck,&#34; Finian said, smiling. &#34;Y'see, it so
happens that I have a gift for dealing with these kinds of things.
See, back when I was a youngster, learning at me grandfather's knee in
the great Sept Tri-Spiral at the Brugh na Boinne...&#34; Another chorus
of howls, closer this time, prompted Buffy to interrupt.</p>

<p>&#34;I sense that it's a story for another time. Can you do anything
about this, or are we going to have to run for our lives?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Impatient pups,&#34; Finian mumbled. &#34;Of course I can. Come close to
the fire.&#34; When Buffy and Willow had stepped forward, Finian began to
sing.</p>

<p>&#34;I've been a wild rover for many a year
And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer,
And now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more...&#34;</p>

<p>The howls sounded again, still closer. Willow looked at the Irishman
wildly, saying, &#34;Are you sure that's the right song?&#34;</p>

<p>Finian thought for a moment, and replied, &#34;Probably not. Let me
think.&#34; After a moment, a very long, tense moment, he began to sing
again. This song was ancient, and the beauty of it heartwrenching.
Though neither girl could understand the words, they could tell that
it was a song filled with love, with loss, and bitter disappointment.
The howls faded now, the Black Spirals sent off, scenting their prey
in another direction. Buffy and Willow stared at the man in
amazement, as his song ended.</p>

<p>&#34;How...&#34; they both began at once.</p>

<p>Finian chuckled, and replied, &#34;'Tis a gift that the Mother has seen
fit to pass on to me. I am, as I said before, a member of the Fianna
tribe of Garou. We are one of the oldest tribes, and are one of the
only tribes that bothers to sing the old songs and keep the
histories.&#34; He shook his head sadly. &#34;Too many of the younger tribes
scorn the old ways. But as well as bein' a Fianna, I'm also a
Galliard.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow looked at the man quizzically. &#34;What's a Galliard?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's a Galliard?&#34; He repeated, aghast. &#34;Have yer elders taught ye
nothing? Is this what's come of Glass Walkers nowadays?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow blushed, and dropped her head. Buffy fixed the man with a hard
stare, and said, &#34;She was a Lost Cub, she hasn't had a chance to learn
everything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Aye, I suppose 'tis true,&#34; he said, nodding regretfully. &#34;With the
Apocalypse upon us, many pups get thrown into the world without the
proper teachings. Very well then, sit ye down and ye can share my
dinner.&#34;</p>

<p>The two girls sat gratefully, as Finian removed the rabbit and began
tearing pieces off. &#34;Now, ye know that all Garou consider Gaia to be
our Mother, and She gifts us with many weapons and songs to fight the
Wyrm. But She is not our only guide or protector.</p>

<p>&#34;Y'see, long ago when Gaia created the Garou, she invited all the
creatures of earth and spirit to come see us. Now some, like the
Wyrm's minions, were furious that Gaia would create such strong, noble
creatures, and they plotted our destruction. Some, like the other
Shapeshifters, the Bastet, Gurahl, and such, were jealous, and they
withheld their gifts and secrets from us because of envy.</p>

<p>&#34;But the spirit Luna looked down upon us, and put Her special mark on
us. She said, 'Just as I change shape, so do they,' and so She
blessed us with special gifts depending 'pon which moon we were born
under. She called this gift, Auspice.</p>

<p>&#34;An' that is why one who is born under the crescent moon gains the
gift of communin' with the spirits, and we call that Garou a Theurge.
One, like me, who is born under the gibbous moon is called to be a
Galliard. We are the lore-keepers, the ones who sing songs of great
deeds and valiant ancestors. Whenever a warrior falters, or forgets
why it is he fights, we sing our songs and put heart into him once
more.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow listened closely to his story while she was eating. That was
why Nichole had called her a Theurge, she thought. She was still
mulling that over few minutes later, when Finian interrupted her train
of thought. &#34;So what are ye two girls doin' out here, so far from
home?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy took turns telling the story. They didn't have
Finian's gift of storytelling, but he listened closely all the same.
When they were done, he let out a low whistle.</p>

<p>&#34;Gaia's breath,&#34; he swore softly. &#34;They must be makin' cubs out of
sterner stuff if yer elders sent ye on such a quest.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Willow asked, curiously.</p>

<p>&#34;What you are proposing to do has never been done before, girl. Not
since the Black Spirals devoured the noble White Howler tribe has any
of the Changing Folk discovered a way to change 'em back. An' to
leave it to a Lost Cub -- and one without a proper pack, besides! --
Gaia, it boggles the mind, an' that's a fact.&#34; The old Fianna sat
back against his log with an air of finality.</p>

<p>&#34;So...you think it can't be done?&#34; Buffy asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, there are a lot of things done every day that have never been
done before, an' no mistake about that. But if ye two succeed, it
could mean... Lord, it could mean the return of the White Howler tribe
itself!&#34; Seeing the curious looks of the girls, Finian sighed, and
muttered again about the neglect of their elders. &#34;Ye see, the White
Howler tribe was a brother tribe to our own. While we claimed as
Kinfolk the Celts of the British Isles, the White Howlers claimed the
Picts. They held the Highlands of Scotland against Rome, when the
Imperial Eagle set its sight on Britain. They were so fierce that the
corrupt Romans ordered mighty walls built just to keep the Howlers an'
their Pict Kinfolk out!</p>

<p>&#34;Well, the Romans were corrupt, as I said, an' the Wyrm had rested
comfortably inside their greedy, conquest-driven hearts. Many Wyrm
beasts, unable to defeat the Howlers through honest battle, began
opening Dark Caerns in the Highlands, hoping to give their allies
access to the physical realm.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hellmouths,&#34; Buffy breathed.</p>

<p>&#34;Aye, lass. An' so they opened great black pits, from which all
manner of beasts emerged, twisting the countryside into a painful
mockery of itself. Now, of course the Howlers, being the brave Garou
that they were, decided that the best way to strike at the Wyrm was to
strike at its heart. So they formed a mighty army, and entered one of
these Dark Caerns, slaying any Wyrm-beast that was unlucky enough to
cross their path.</p>

<p>&#34;They made their way to the center of the Caern, some might say that
they reached Hell itself; and there, they met a beast so terrifying
that half of them were driven mad from the sight. They had gone so
far into Hell that they came face to face with the Wyrm.</p>

<p>&#34;Only one White Howler survived to tell the tale. He fought his way
out of the inky darkness, only to see his former brothers emerge from
the pit. Where once they stood tall and proud, now they were horrid,
twisted by the power of the Wyrm. Their eyes glowed with the green
balefire of damnation. They mocked him, and said that they were no
longer White Howlers, but Black Spiral Dancers.</p>

<p>&#34;He fled then, knowing that it was his duty to warn others of these
twisted mockeries of Garou. He found one of our Septs, and passed
along his story. That night, as he slept, the Black Spiral Dancers
came for him, and when he was found in the morning, the only thing
left were his bones.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow heard a rustle in the bushes, and she immediately leapt up into
the air with a yell. Looking around frantically, she saw some small
animal scamper off. &#34;Ok, this whole thing has me seriously wigged,&#34;
she said, looking around fearfully. Buffy rose, and wrapped Willow in
a big hug.</p>

<p>&#34;But ye see, lass, what stands to be gained if ye succeed,&#34; Finian
said.</p>

<p>Willow nodded, taking comfort from Buffy's embrace.</p>

<p>&#34;Sleep here tonight,&#34; Finian said. &#34;Morning will be soon enough to
continue your journey, and you two could use the rest, I think.
You'll be safe in this clearing; the Spirals won't pick up your trail
until you leave.&#34;</p>

<p>The girls accepted his offer gratefully, and they pulled some thin
blankets out of their backpacks to use to keep warm. &#34;Aren't you
going to need a blanket or something?&#34; Buffy asked, eyeing the Fianna
and his lack of preparedness.</p>

<p>Finian chuckled. &#34;Ye forget who yer talkin' too, lass,&#34; he said, and
in an instant shifted into wolf form.</p>

<p>&#34;Not a bad idea, actually,&#34; Willow said, with a thoughtful look at the
Irish wolf. She gave her blanket to Buffy and then shifted into wolf
form, curling up next to the Slayer to help keep them both warm.
Buffy smiled and buried her face in warm red fur, falling asleep
within seconds.</p>

<p>&#34;And when She was done, Gaia looked down at the animals she had
created. 'Something is missing,' she thought. 'There are none here
whom I can trust to defend Me from the Wyrm.' And truly, it was so;
the animals had not the intelligence to defend Her. Man, in his own
blind way, barely understood who She was. And the other shapeshifters
were too preoccupied with their own agendas, their own desires.</p>

<p>&#34;And so Gaia took her fiercest, noblest creature, Wolf, and merged him
with Man. And this new creation she called Garou.</p>

<p>&#34;'Garou shall be My defender,' Gaia said to her other creations. 'His
Rage will know no bounds, and he will protect Me from the Wyrm, and
you will give him honor.' And the animals accepted this, and Man hid
from it, as always. But the older Changing Breeds objected. Gurahl,
who was the eldest and had long held favor in Gaia's eyes, said,
'Mother, it is not just that we who are the eldest and wisest must
give honor to the young and impetuous, and teach them all our
secrets.'</p>

<p>&#34;Gaia looked down on her children sadly. 'It is My wish,' she told
them, 'that the Garou be given every tool which may help them to fight
the Wyrm.' And the other Changing Breeds slunk away, looking
jealously on Garou, and vowing to fight against him.&#34; -- From the
histories of Nikolai Speaks-The-Past, Galliard of the Silver Fang

<hr width=100>

<p>After a light breakfast of powerbars and leftover rabbit, Buffy and
Willow said their goodbyes to the old Fianna.</p>

<p>&#34;Now, remember,&#34; he was telling Willow, &#34;you have the gift of
communin' with the spirits, so don't be shy about askin' them for
help. Gaia bless ye, and keep ye safe.&#34; With that, Finian smiled at
the two girls, shifted into wolf form, and loped into the brush,
leaving the two girls alone.</p>

<p>&#34;So, Will,&#34; Buffy said, breaking the silence. &#34;Where are we, and how
do we get from here to there?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow dug through her pack for the map and GPS. &#34;According to this,&#34;
she said, looking at the device, &#34;we're about five miles south from
the edge of the area Nichole marked off for us.&#34; She looked up at the
blonde Slayer. &#34;It looks like it will be a few hours walking, unless
we travel in the Umbra.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy frowned. &#34;Yeah, but it looked like they tracked us down pretty
easily there last time. I don't know about you, but I'd rather not
risk it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok,&#34; Willow nodded her agreement. Flashing a smile and giving the
Slayer a thorough kiss, she shouldered her backpack. &#34;We'd better get
going.&#34;</p>

<p>A dazed but happy Slayer followed her from the clearing.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz whimpered, the nightmare overtaking him once again. Every time he
slept it was the same -- _she_ would come, she would stand before him,
and he would reach out to her. And then, a flash of silver; the blade
would slide into his gut before he realized what happened. It burned
with cold fire, leeching all warmth, all life from his limbs.</p>

<p>He stumbles back, the blade slithering out of him with a sickening
hiss. As if a cork were removed from a bottle, blood starts pouring
out of the wound, splattering on the ground.</p>

<p>&#34;Why...?&#34; he gasps, looking up at Willow for some explanation, some
reason that makes sense. I thought you loved me, he thinks, but he no
longer has the energy to speak.</p>

<p>She looks down at him, sadly. &#34;I'm sorry. But I can't let you live
any longer.&#34;</p>

<p>He collapses, his eyes trying to focus on the ground which is now an
inch away from his face.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm really sorry, Oz,&#34; he hears her say, as always. &#34;But you have to
die.&#34;</p>

<p>The young Black Spiral woke with a start, his heart pounding. He
looked down quickly to see if he was bleeding, but the wound was not
there. Not yet, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Pushing himself upright, he looked around the small cave where his
pack had sheltered. The others were all still asleep, whining with
whatever nightmares tormented them, keeping them on the very edge of
insanity. Now that Oz was awake, he was restless. He felt the urge
to track Willow, to make her one of them. Then they could be together
again. And the nightmares would go away.</p>

<p>He sat, and waited impatiently for the others to awaken.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;Christ, we've been wandering this area for hours,&#34; Buffy said,
irritably. She brushed her sweat-soaked hair out of her face, wishing
for the thousandth time that she had brought a headband, scarf, hair
net, _anything_ to keep her hair out of her face.</p>

<p>Even though the temperature was much cooler this far north, the two
girls had been hiking through the woods for hours, trying to find any
evidence that they were in the correct area. So far they had found
nothing, leading both girls to wonder to themselves if Nichole had
screwed up. Neither one wanted to voice that opinion out loud,
though, afraid of what it would mean if it were true.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, according to the GPS we should be in the area,&#34; Willow said
defensively. &#34;Although we've covered most of it without any luck,&#34;
she was forced to add.</p>

<p>The tempers of both girls had been running short with the food, and
their water situation wasn't looking very good, either. If there was
one thing that Willow remembered from her disastrous sixth grade
camping trip, it's that you never drink standing water. She had to
coax Buffy away from a promising looking pond, asking the Slayer to
trust her personal experience.</p>

<p>&#34;We're going to get Blair Witched, I just know it,&#34; Buffy grumbled.
The air was gradually getting cooler as the day wore on toward
twilight. Both girls knew what could happen if they were stuck out in
the middle of the woods, no food, no water, and no shelter.</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe we should start looking for some place to hole up for the
night,&#34; Willow suggested. &#34;It's getting dark.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Start looking for some place to die, you mean,&#34; Buffy's temper
flared. &#34;There's no way we can find someplace where we won't be
tracked by Oz, either in or out of the Umbra.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, do you have a better suggestion?&#34; Willow snapped. &#34;Because if
you do Miss-Know-It-All-Slayer, I'd like to hear it.&#34;</p>

<p>Any tart rejoinder Buffy would have made at that moment was
interrupted by a blood-curdling howl. Both girls looked at each
other, knowing exactly what that howl meant.</p>

<p>&#34;Run,&#34; Buffy urged, grabbing Willow's hand and leading her deeper into
the forest.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The door to the Dream of Gaia magick shop chimed, and Nichole looked
up to see Chris enter, black trenchcoat flapping around his legs.
&#34;Got cold out there all of a sudden,&#34; he mumbled, closing the door
behind him.</p>

<p>Nichole nodded. &#34;Ever since yesterday.&#34; She was sitting behind the
counter, looking dully at a quartz crystal she held in her palm, idly
turning it over.</p>

<p>&#34;You hear anything?&#34; Chris leaned against the counter, picking up the
crystal to look at it.</p>

<p>Nichole shook her head. &#34;Nothing. I can't get a spirit to track
them, they're all too afraid.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sure they'll be ok, Nikki,&#34; Chris said, using a nickname he had
for her from long ago. &#34;Those two are very resourceful, they can take
care of themselves--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;They're young girls, Chris. Most other Garou are given years of
training before their Rite of Passage.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;They're strong girls, Nikki. Willow's been dealing with vampires and
such since she was fifteen. And Buffy, she's the Slayer.&#34; Chris held
her hand, clasping it tightly in both of his.</p>

<p>Nichole chuckled softly, looking down at their hands. &#34;What, you
believe they can do it, now?&#34; she asked, her eyes looking up to search
his. Needing the closeness, the reassurance.</p>

<p>&#34;I do.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow ran until she was sure her heart was going to burst, the mad
howls of the Spirals pursuing them every step of the way. She was
certain that they would have been caught by now, but it appeared that
the Spirals enjoyed the chase, and the fear.</p>

<p>&#34;Got...to stop,&#34; Willow panted, her legs slowing down seemingly of
their own accord.</p>

<p>&#34;No, Will, you've got to keep moving.&#34; Buffy pulled on her, but she
was just as exhausted as the redhead.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy.&#34; Willow stopped, nearly collapsing in the process. She
swallowed, and her throat felt raw and dry. Buffy skidded to a stop
and turned, also exhausted and out of breath. &#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow
continued, &#34;I want you to know that I love you.&#34; She reached out with
a trembling hand, and briefly caressed Buffy's cheek. Turning away,
Willow shifted into Crinos form, waiting for the Spirals to arrive.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her lover, her reddish fur illuminated by the cold
moonlight. A serenity had fallen over Willow's fierce features, and
Buffy couldn't help but think that at that moment she _was_ nobility.
And the Slayer was damned if she'd let her love face death alone.</p>

<p>She slowly removed her backpack and tossed it aside, only retaining
the slim silver blade that Giles had given her. She swung it once,
experimentally, adjusting to its weight in her hand. Satisfied, she
lowered the blade, and slipped her free hand into Willow's.</p>

<p>Both girls watched the treeline, hearing the howls of the approaching
Spirals.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz smelled her now; they were close, very close. The Alpha had been
holding the pack back from attacking, milking the fear of their prey
for all it was worth. Oz growled with impatience; he needed this
chase to be over, needed to be back with his Willow once more. He let
loose a howl of desire, of longing, only to have it answered with a
howl of challenge.</p>

<p>He and the pack burst forth into the clearing.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The howls woke him from a deep slumber, old instincts fighting to the
surface. How long did I sleep this time? he wondered, looking about.
His hidden cabin was still in the same shape in which he left it, so
he assumed he wasn't asleep that long.</p>

<p>A second howl broke him from his reverie. Warm brown eyes narrowed in
suspicion and he rose, cold joints creaking in protest.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow watched as the Spirals burst from the treeline into the
clearing. There were clearly four of them, just as she had seen in
the Umbra. The hackles on the back of her neck rose at the sight of
the Wyrm-Garou. She growled, watching their Alpha step forward, manic
grin plastered on his short-muzzled face.</p>

<p>She watched him as he moved, remembering the lessons that Buffy taught
her about how to size up an opponent, judge their strengths and
weaknesses. Her heart sank as she realized that he didn't seem to
have any.</p>

<p>He charged her then, the rest of the pack howling out their support.
He was fast, but she was just a little bit faster, dodging out of the
way of his tackle, and raking her claws across his face, unfortunately
missing his eyes. Blood welled from the deep cuts as he stopped and
pivoted to face her, still grinning.</p>

<p>Buffy backed up from the fight, keeping a close eye on the other three
Spirals. They seemed to be engrossed in their leader's fight with
Willow, which was all to the good as far as Buffy was concerned. As
long as we can face them one-on-one, Buffy thought, we might stand a
chance. She kept her blade up, waiting for anyone to make the first
move.</p>

<p>Oz watched as the Alpha charged Willow again. He knew that if the
Alpha could take her down, she would be theirs; they could kill Buffy
at their leisure, and take Willow by force to break her, make her
serve the Wyrm. And then she would be his.</p>

<p>Willow stumbled and dropped under the Alpha's attack, and Oz only
realized at the last second that it was a feint. The Alpha jumped on
her, lips pulled back in anticipation of a throating. Willow brought
her back legs up and caught him, managing one good rake with her claws
across his chest before she kicked him off, sending him sprawling
across the clearing.</p>

<p>The Alpha stood, his eyes blazing with fury. His grin was gone now,
and he howled in rage. He pointed at Willow, his hand starting to
glow with that same sickly green fire that was reflected in his eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't know what the green stuff was, nor did she want Willow to
be on the receiving end. The Slayer leapt forward, her silver blade
cutting neatly through fur, muscle, bone. The Alpha's arm hit the
ground, green fire snuffed out in an instant.</p>

<p>Time slowed. The Alpha stood there, jaw agape at his arm which now
ended abruptly right below the elbow. Black blood poured from the
wound, and the enraged Spiral aimed a killing blow for Buffy's head
which the Slayer was just barely able to dodge. Buffy ducked under
the blow, feeling her hair whipped by the force of its passing. She
thrusted up with her blade, the foot and a half of cold silver sliding
into the Alpha's chest like it was soft clay. In less than a second
she whipped the blade out, blood spraying as she did so, and jumped
back to avoid counterattack. The Spiral roared in pain, reaching out
for the Slayer with his one remaining hand -- and dropped to the
ground, dead.</p>

<p>The other three spirals let loose with howls of outrage, and came
after the two girls. So much for reprieve, Buffy thought.</p>

<p>Willow met the first attacker, a small, jackal-headed Spiral, with a
bone-crunching fist right to the muzzle which snapped his head back.
Suddenly, she felt an iron grip grab her arm, and she turned to see a
Spiral who had attacked her from the side. He grabbed her right arm,
and Jackal leapt forward to grab her left, bearing her down to the
ground.</p>

<p>Oz, upon seeing the Alpha fall, immediately went after Buffy,
blind-siding her with a tackle. She quickly discovered that having
five hundred pounds of snarling werewolf ram straight into you was not
a terribly nice feeling. She elbowed Oz in the face, trying to make
enough room to bring her blade up and into play.</p>

<p>Willow, unable to break the hold that the two Spirals had on her arms,
immediately shifted into wolf form, her smaller lupine shape easily
sliding out of the startled Spirals' grips. She darted around one
Spiral, feeling his claws rake her side as he tried to make a grab for
her. Noticing Buffy's struggle, she ran straight for Oz, only
shifting into Crinos at the last minute to slam into him, carrying him
off of the trapped Slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy jumped to her feet just in time to meet the attack of the third
Spiral. She tried to dodge the blow, but not quite fast enough; his
clawed hands ripped into her side, knocking her away like she was a
rag doll. The Slayer could only watch as the third Spiral walked over
to where Willow and Oz fought, grabbing the Glass Walker by the arms
and pinning them behind her back as Oz tore at her stomach and chest
with his claws.</p>

<p>Buffy tried to rise and felt the searing heat of bile in her throat.
She was getting cold, and she noticed with some detachment that her
entire side was covered in blood. Her blood. Her vision swam, and
she blinked several times to try to clear it, all the while crawling,
sword clutched in one blood-covered fist, to try to save Willow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, an ear-splitting roar erupted in the clearing; Buffy looked
up, her eyes unable to focus. A huge shadow, one which dwarfed the
smaller Garou, rose up behind the Spiral that was holding Willow.
There was a sickening tearing sound, and the head of the Spiral flew
across the clearing. The body dropped instantly, bearing Willow down
with it.</p>

<p>The two remaining Spirals, Oz and Jackal, disappeared, and Buffy's
last sight was of the huge shadow bending down to engulf her lover.
Then, darkness.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow opened her eyes, the dim firelight illuminating what appeared
to be a roughly made log cabin. A large, burly man bent over the
fire, stirring what looked like a soup kettle; he was softly humming
to himself.</p>

<p>The redhead could feel Buffy laying next to her, still in deep
slumber. She snored softly in a way that she always did when her
Slayer senses allowed her to fall into her deepest sleep. Willow
always found it insufferably cute.</p>

<p>The man turned, and saw Willow watching him. He smiled, a smile which
was nearly hidden by his full, salt-and-pepper beard. The man stepped
forward, laying a warm, dry hand on her forehead. &#34;Rest now, young
Garou,&#34; he told her, his rumbling voice drawing her into sleep. &#34;You
are safe here.&#34;</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part the Sixteenth</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Bright sunlight shining in her eyes brought Willow to full
wakefulness. She rubbed her eyes, careful not to disturb the figure
sleeping next to her; she looked down at the blond head fondly,
noticing that even in sleep Buffy held on to her protectively.</p>

<p>She shifted a tiny bit, kissing the top of Buffy's head.
Unfortunately, this also brought a corner of the dusty fur that served
as their blanket right underneath Buffy's nose; she snorted, then
sneezed, startling herself awake. Willow giggled.</p>

<p>&#34;Wha's so funny?&#34; Buffy mumbled, rubbing her hand over her face.</p>

<p>&#34;You,&#34; Willow replied, kissing Buffy soundly, and pulling her into a
big hug. &#34;You don't know how glad I am that you're ok.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Count me as a big ol' likewise, babe,&#34; Buffy said, smiling at her
lover delightedly. &#34;Not to look a gift life in the mouth, but do you
have any idea _why_ we're ok?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow frowned, remembering the events of the night before. &#34;I'm not
sure, the last thing I really remember is...&#34; she shuddered, not
wanting to remember the feel of Oz's talons tearing through her skin.
&#34;I woke up sometime after, and I think we were rescued, but by who or
what I'm not sure.&#34;</p>

<p>Any further conversation was forestalled by Buffy's stomach, which was
protesting its emptiness in a very vocal fashion. Willow laughed
again and jumped out of bed, her feet touching the cold, dusty floor.
Their backpacks had been placed next to the large, wooden bed they
both had slept in, so Willow grabbed hers and began to rummage through
it, looking for powerbars. Unfortunately, it appeared that they had
none left.</p>

<p>&#34;Bad news. Looks like we finished off our last powerbars already,&#34;
Willow said, watching Buffy stand and stretch. The sunlight played
over Buffy's limbs, and the mild ripple of muscles under skin always
fascinated the redhead.</p>

<p>&#34;What's that?&#34; Buffy asked, pointing at a large kettle warming over a
banked fire in the fireplace.</p>

<p>&#34;Dunno, could be laundry for all I know.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy lifted the cast-iron lid and peered in, sniffing experimentally.
&#34;Smells good for laundry.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's soup, and you can help yourself if you like.&#34; A deep voice
startled them both. The source of the voice was standing in the open
doorway, a canvas bag slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The man was nearly wider than the doorway itself, Willow noticed. He
was very tall and broad, and his long salt-and-pepper hair and beard
nearly hid an omni-present smile. His faded denim jeans and flannel
gave him a Grizzly Adams appearance.</p>

<p>He walked in without another word, and set his canvas bag down on the
rough-hewn wood table. Coming to stand in front of the girls, he held
open his arms in a welcoming gesture. &#34;Be well, young sisters.
Welcome to the knowledge of Gaia and Her creation. Be easy in all
your forms, and walk lightly upon the Earth. I am Artur Mountainwind,
Gurahl Tale-spinner of the Mountain Guardians. To meet you is my
honor.&#34; He inclined his head out of respect for his guests, and they
did likewise.</p>

<p>&#34;I, um...&#34; Willow was unsure how to respond after the formalness of
the man's greeting. Still, she gave it a valiant try. &#34;I am Willow
Rosenberg, Garou Theurge of the Glass Walkers, and this is my
companion Buffy Summers, the Slayer. The honor is, um, ours.&#34;</p>

<p>Artur smiled at the two girls. &#34;Geth-Uzmati,&#34; he said, turning to
Buffy. &#34;We have known about your kind for millenia. It was because
of the Gurahl that Gaia created the Slayers as protectors of mankind
against the Pattern Breaker.&#34; Knowing the questions that the two
girls would want to ask him, Artur held up a large, weathered hand.
&#34;But you are hungry, and the Ritual of Hospitality dictates that first
you must break your fast. Please sit.&#34; The two friends looked at
each other and then sat around the large table while Artur filled up
earthenware bowls and plates with food.</p>

<p>Setting the food on the table, he said, &#34;Take this fish and these
berries. The berries are the fruits of Gaia, which I bequeath to you.
Their sweetness is all we need to tell us why we nurture Gaia's
creation. The fish has been salted to remind us of the tears that
have been shed in protecting Gaia. The fish has given of itself so
that we may nourish ourselves; we honor its sacrifice. Never fail to
offer Gaia's bounty to any in need.&#34;</p>

<p>He poured large mugs full of water from a clay pitcher. &#34;This is
fresh spring water. It symbolizes life. Drink, and gain the wisdom
of Gaia.&#34;</p>

<p>The two girls drank deeply; Willow noticed how refreshing and clean
the water tasted, not at all like &#34;natural spring water&#34; found in
supermarkets, and certainly a far cry from city tap water. It was
cold, crisp, and slightly sweet, and she found it very refreshing.
The three of them ate in silence; it seemed almost sacreligious to
disturb the peacefulness of the meal.</p>

<p>Buffy thought about the different family dinners she had gone to over
the years, and how often her grandparents would say 'Grace' before a
meal. They always thanked God for their food, but never did they
actually thank the food itself. She began to wonder why not.</p>

<p>Finally, when they had eaten their fill of the fish soup and berries,
Artur leaned back and regarded his guests seriously. &#34;I am sure we
all have many questions; so since you are my guests protected under
the Ritual of Hospitality, I will let you ask yours first.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy exchanged glances, and after a moment Willow asked,
&#34;You are a werebear? A, um, Gurahl?&#34;</p>

<p>Artur nodded. &#34;I am.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow relaxed somewhat. &#34;I'm sorry, I just didn't realize what kind
of, uh, reception we were going to get, seeing as how I'm Garou and
Buffy is human.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You have no need to fear that.&#34; Artur smiled at them. &#34;We Gurahl
are protectors and healers. We enter combat only rarely, and then
never without good reason. Only those corrupted by the Pattern
Breaker have any need to fear us.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You said you knew about the Slayers,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;And how the
Gurahl created them?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Actually, Gaia created them,&#34; Artur corrected. His eyes became
distant, the flickering firelight reflecting in them like dark,
underground pools. The girls listened with rapt attention to his
story. &#34;In the early days, Man had a difficult time surviving in the
harsh wilderness. He was without claws, without fangs, without speed,
and without strength. We had sympathy for Man, and helped him build
shelter, make tools, and hunt and dig for food.</p>

<p>&#34;As the human settlements grew, the Soul-Dead known as Vampires came
in to hide among the cities and prey on the weak. Thus the Pattern
Breaker was served as more corrupted, soulless creatures were spawned.
Night by night they ravaged the human cities, spreading their plague
of corruption.</p>

<p>&#34;The terrified humans called out to the heavens for a savior, one who
would protect them from the Soul-Dead just as their hunters protected
them from the wild beasts. Our Kinfolk brought this before us, and we
brought it before Gaia. We pleaded with her to help Man fight against
the Pattern Breaker's minions, for we knew then that Man would be a
force in the world, and could tip the scales of the war. The Great
Mother said to us, 'If you can find someone who is willing to fight
and die on behalf of Man, I will make of him a savior.'</p>

<p>&#34;So we went into the human cities, and asked for one who would be
willing to take on the burdens of a savior, one who would fight and
die for their people. We travelled from city to city, and found no
one who was willing to stand up to the horrors of the Soul-Dead.</p>

<p>&#34;Finally, in a small village, we found someone. Not a warrior, or a
hunter, but a young girl, one who loved her people and wanted them
safe from harm. She boldly stepped forward and said, 'Wise ones, I
will give my life to save those of my people. I would do it ten or a
hundred times if I could, for I love them.' We heard the voice of
Gaia, then, and She said, 'So it shall be. This young girl and those
who come after her will be the saviors of Mankind, and they shall slay
the Soul-Dead who prey on her people.'</p>

<p>&#34;And so it was from that moment on that one young girl is chosen to
receive Gaia's gifts and be the savior of mankind, fighting the
minions of the Pattern Breaker to protect her people.&#34; Artur fell
silent, his tale finished.</p>

<p>&#34;How much of this is true?&#34; Buffy asked, quietly. &#34;I mean, I've heard
stories about how the Gurahl were jealous of Garou, so they started
fighting, and stories about how the Garou demanded obedience and the
other shape changers didn't like it... I guess I'm wondering what the
heck I can believe.&#34;</p>

<p>Artur just smiled. &#34;That is something you have to find out for
yourself.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz paced the dark cave, rubbing his arms vigorously as if to ward off
a chill. That...thing...had killed Anoorach and had taken the two
girls to god only knows where. It was all he and Onaalth could do to
get away before they were torn to pieces as well.</p>

<p>Oz looked over at the jackal-headed Spiral, who was busy whimpering
and whining in his sleep. Sickening. He had tried to convince Oz to
return to the Caern, to gather more Spirals, but Oz had refused. He
wasn't leaving here until Willow was his again. He had even refused
to sleep, because he could no longer bear the nightmares.</p>

<p>When it grew dark, he would track them and find them.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;Sir, were you the one who rescued us last night?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>Artur nodded. &#34;I found two brave souls who were fighting for their
lives against the minions of the Pattern Breaker. I brought you both
back here for healing, since you were sore in need of it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Willow bowed her head respectfully. &#34;We, that is, Buffy
and I, were looking for you. I am on a quest, and I had hoped that
you would be able to help me with it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What desperate situation has befallen the Garou that they would send
a questing pup after a member of my race?&#34; Artur asked, smiling
faintly.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, sir,&#34; Willow began, &#34;one of those Black Spirals we were
fighting last night is...was...a friend of ours. He was taken by the
Spirals and turned to the Wyrm -- er, Pattern Breaker.&#34;</p>

<p>Artur's smile faded, and he fixed a sad gaze on the two girls. &#34;I am
sorry to hear that. The Pattern Breaker touches many, and his touch
always brings corruption. Still, I don't know why you came so far to
bring this news to me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;One of my teachers thought that you knew of a way to cure Wyrm
taint.&#34;</p>

<p>The Gurahl stroked his beard thoughtfully. &#34;The problem is not only
the taint, it is also the madness, correct? The madness could quite
possibly be cured, but I know of no way to cure a minion of the
Pattern Breaker completely.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow felt her heart sink with bitter disappointment. After they had
come so far and fought so hard. She swallowed, feeling Buffy's hand
cover hers. Then Oz was well and truly dead if even the Gurahl could
not help.</p>

<p>&#34;So there's nothing we can do?&#34; Buffy asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;The spirit of Bear teaches all the Gurahl our healing gifts. He has,
on occassion, been known to teach certain gifts to Garou as well. You
may be able to call upon Bear, and He may deign to teach you something
that would help. But the confrontation would be dangerous; Bear is
not forgiving toward those who slaughtered His children.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow raised her head, looking Artur in the eyes for the first time.
Her tear-stained cheeks looked flushed, but she swallowed and said,
&#34;If that is what it takes, I'll do it.&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The late afternoon sun shone down on the small forest glade. There
was a tiny, bubbling spring here, just outside the cabin, and the
musical sound of rushing water was helping Willow focus her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#34;You must be purified of mind, body, and spirit in order to survive
your confrontation with Bear; if you have any lingering doubt you must
rid yourself of it before the ritual,&#34; Artur had told her.</p>

<p>The crunching sound of boots on dirt and leaves told Willow that Buffy
was walking up behind her. Sure enough, a quiet voice said, &#34;Willow,
please don't do this.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I have to, Buffy. It's the only way I can save him.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy crouched down next to her, hand clutching her shoulder tightly.
&#34;Will, please. I almost lost you last night. It...it would have
killed me. Will,&#34; she said, raising Willow's face to look into her
own, &#34;I can't live without you.&#34;</p>

<p>The redhead's eyes filled immediately with tears. &#34;God, Buffy, I
wouldn't want to live without you. But I can't...I have to do this.
I can't turn my back on it now, not after everything that's happened.
Not after everything I know now.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy dropped her gaze, and asked in a quiet voice, &#34;Aren't I worth
more to you than he is?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow nodded, tears spilling down her cheeks. &#34;Yes, Buffy, you're
everything to me.&#34; She stroked one downy-soft cheek with the back of
her hand. &#34;I've never loved anyone as much as I love you right now,
and every day I love you more.</p>

<p>&#34;But what I'm doing isn't just for Oz. It's for you too. You saw the
Spirit World -- everything is slowly being drowned in _poison_. You
can fight it, but you can only fight so much.</p>

<p>&#34;Every night you go out to risk your life, killing vampires and
demons, stopping apocalypses, all to save your friends and family.
This is something _I_ can do, something to stall the poison and let
us all live a little bit longer. I can do this, Buffy. Please
believe in me.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow felt herself get wrapped up in a hug, Buffy holding her tightly
to her. &#34;God, Will,&#34; she said, voice roughened by tears. &#34;I do
believe in you. I just worry so much about you, you know? I've been
doing it for so long now, I'm used to being everyone's protector.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow smiled, her lips brushing Buffy's neck. &#34;I know.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok. Well, I won't say I won't worry, but I believe in you. If
anyone can do it, it's my bad-ass werewolf.&#34; Buffy smiled, and hugged
Willow even tighter.</p>

<p>Willow allowed herself to remain in the embrace for several minutes,
gaining strength and comfort from her lover. Finally, she said,
&#34;Thank you. It means everything to me that you believe.&#34; She gave
Buffy one final hug, and then stood. &#34;Ok, I think I'm ready.&#34;</p>

<p>The two lovers allowed themselves one final kiss, and then they headed
back into the cabin.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part the Seventeenth</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Willow sat cross-legged on the dusty floor of the cabin, the deerskin
robes she wore heavy against her skin.</p>

<p>Artur made her change out of her normal clothing, because he said that
such trappings of the Pattern Weaver might anger Bear, and no one
wanted to take any more chances with that than necessary. She
breathed deeply, and felt the hot smoke of smouldering sage in her
nostrils.</p>

<p>&#34;We are here to witness the purification of this young cub. A sister
of the Garou, we ask for the peace and protection of Bear, and the
wisdom of the Great Mother on her behalf.&#34; The Gurahl anointed her
forehead with spring water, his large hand proving surprisingly
gentle.</p>

<p>Buffy sat to the side, watching the proceedings nervously. She knew
that Willow needed to complete this quest, for her own reasons if no
one else's. But it didn't mean that Buffy stopped worrying about her.
She was going someplace alone, without Buffy there to protect her, and
the Slayer didn't like it one bit.</p>

<p>Artur bent and placed an amulet around Willow's neck. &#34;I grant you
the blessing and protection of the Brothers and Sisters of Bear,&#34; he
said solemnly. &#34;May your journey prove fruitful, and your actions
honor your people and the Great Mother.&#34; Picking up Willow's small
mirror, he pressed it into her hand.</p>

<p>Willow rose, and with one last look at the Slayer, gazed into the
mirror. Taking a small step forward, she vanished.</p>

<p>&#34;So it begins,&#34; Artur said, quietly.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz padded through the silent forest, sniffing the air anxiously. He
and Onaalth had covered the blood-stained clearing that they were
forced to flee the night before; it was nearly impossible to pick up
the scent of the creature that had attacked them. It was as if it
were part of the earth itself.</p>

<p>So they had expanded their search in ever-widening circles. Onaalth
had dared to challenge Oz, saying that they should abandon the search
to travel back to the Caern; Oz had ripped in to the smaller,
jackal-headed werewolf, both literally and figuratively. He was here
for one reason: Willow; and there was no way he was going to let that
betraying bitch elude him again.</p>

<p>So close! They had been so close to taking her in the clearing. The
Slayer had been ripped to pieces, and Willow was _theirs_. She was so
close to being forced to walk the Spiral, and then she would be his
forever.</p>

<p>The Spiral... Oz remembered it only in brief, nightmare flashes of
repressed memory. He remembered the gauntlet he was forced to walk,
as the other Spirals in the Caern took their turns slashing him with
claw and fang, or branding him with hot Balefire. The pain ate into
his soul until it touched something deep inside him, and finally
unleashed the Rage which he had held down and kept hidden for so long.
He snarled with the memory of it; his faddishly jaded, carefully
indifferent persona shattered in an instant. He raged against
everything: against the Spirals who caused him pain, against his
family for never understanding, against Veruca for stripping away his
comfortable preconceptions, and most of all against Willow.</p>

<p>Willow.</p>

<p>Willow who insisted on loving him, even when he so obviously didn't
deserve it.</p>

<p>Willow who wanted to kill him, slide a silver blade into his gut,
spilling his blood and entrails on the floor.</p>

<p>He walked the Spiral, and it brought him face-to-face with all his
failures, all his disappointments, everything he lost. Except Willow.
The Wyrm told him that he could have her again; make her like he was,
bring her to the Caern, and she would be his forever. His to play
with, his to control.</p>

<p>All he had to do was find her.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow looked around at the forest glade, awash in nature spirits.
Unlike the forest areas closer to civilization, this place was
inhabited by spirits who exuded vitality and health. Water spirits,
untouched by toxin, played merrily in the natural spring. Tree
spirits, free from smog and blight, whispered long-forgotten secrets
to each other.</p>

<p>She started walking, for no better reason than that she felt she
should.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, watch where you're going!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow jerked back in surprise, looking down at her feet. A small
rabbit sat there, eating some ripe berries. He looked at her with
what she thought was a very pissed-off expression. Not that she'd
ever seen a pissed-off rabbit before to compare.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sorry,&#34; she said, feeling a little odd at talking to a rabbit.
&#34;I wasn't watching where I was going.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's for sure,&#34; he said, only slightly mollified. &#34;Why are you
stomping around here, anyway? Are you intentionally trying to crush
cute little animals?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow thought that the attitude this rabbit was pulling made him a
lot less than 'cute'. &#34;I'm just looking for Bear. I won't bother you
any more.&#34; She turned, and started walking away.</p>

<p>&#34;Bear, huh? Never liked the guy. Always throwing his weight around.
What're you looking for him for?&#34; Rabbit began hopping next to her,
trying to keep up with her long legs.</p>

<p>Willow, annoyed, looked down at the tiny rabbit. &#34;I was told that he
could help me, teach me a gift.&#34;</p>

<p>The rabbit made a rude noise that Willow didn't think was possible
considering the shape of rabbit lips. &#34;Bear? You've got to be
joking.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Willow stopped and folded her arms across her chest. &#34;I
heard that Bear has a lot of gifts he can teach.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, sure, if he wanted to. But he won't teach 'em to you. He'll
just kill you.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow blinked. &#34;He'll...why...I mean...&#34;</p>

<p>Rabbit looked at her critically. &#34;You're Garou, right? Yeah, he won't
teach you, he'll just kill you. Best to turn back now.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But, I can't!&#34; Willow put a hand up to her forehead, trying to still
the beginnings of a raging headache. &#34;I mean, I need to talk to him!&#34;</p>

<p>Rabbit cocked an eyebrow. &#34;It's really that important, huh? Hmm, well
maybe there is something you can do. Bear is a huge glutton, I mean,
he doesn't think about much _except_ eating. If you can lure him in
with food, he'll generally listen until the food runs out. Then he'll
eat you, unless you've convinced him otherwise.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;He'll eat _me_?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, yeah. You're the other, _other_ white meat.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok...&#34; Aside from the fact that this was all coming from a rabbit,
Willow couldn't find anything wrong with his logic. &#34;So what does
Bear like to eat? Like, nuts and berries and stuff?&#34;</p>

<p>Another rude noise. &#34;Hell no. Fish, preferably salmon,&#34; Rabbit
advised.</p>

<p>&#34;How do I catch salmon?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How do bears do it?&#34;</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz turned his head back and forth, trying to narrow down that elusive
scent. They had been searching for what felt like hours, and now he
thought he had it. There. Just a faint trace left on a few leaves,
but it was there. Willow.</p>

<p>He called out to his packmate, an ear-splitting howl of obsession and
triumph.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy heard the hair-raising howl, faint but still recognizable. It
was a mad sound, and the pure desperation that filled it made her
shiver.</p>

<p>&#34;Prepare yourself,&#34; Artur said, head cocked to one side. &#34;They come.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy walked over to her backpack, and drew her silver blade.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>&#34;Just like a bear,&#34; Willow mumbled, standing knee-deep in an ice-cold,
rushing river. She was able to find it with a little more help from
Rabbit. He turned out to be not so bad after all; she guessed they
just got off on, or under, the wrong foot.</p>

<p>The silvery fish darted around past her ankles; she was convinced that
they were taunting her and her inexperience. The few times she was
able to grab one, they slid right out of her grasp. She was cold,
wet, tired, frustrated, and just about ready to give up.</p>

<p>&#34;Come on!&#34; She yelled, after missing another catch. &#34;Can't you guys
cooperate just _once_?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why should we?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow jumped back from the voice she heard at her feet, nearly
slipping and plunging herself into the icy river. &#34;Wha...?&#34;</p>

<p>The voice came from a large salmon, darting back and forth under the
water. &#34;I mean it, what's in it for us? You're just going to eat us,
right?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Um, well...&#34; Willow said, thinking furiously. &#34;You'd...get to see
what life on land is like!&#34; She finished, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, goody. Then I can choke to death. Sign me up.&#34;</p>

<p>What is it with these sarcastic animals? Willow wondered. It was
really starting to tick her off. These guys were a lot pissier than
their Disney counterparts. &#34;Look, you guys are supposed to get eaten.
Isn't it some Circle of Life thing?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That doesn't mean I have to make it easy.&#34; The salmon darted off
through the water.</p>

<p>Willow sank down on the bank, dropping her head into her hands. This
whole world, everything in it was very weird and very disappointing.
She was really starting to hate it.</p>

<p>&#34;Now, that's pretty sad.&#34;</p>

<p>Now what? Willow looked up to see a hawk perched on a nearby tree,
regarding her solemnly. &#34;Can I help you with something?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, you can stop feeling sorry for yourself. You're a predator,
for Gaia's sake! Act like one.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know how!&#34; Willow cried, frustrated. &#34;I've been human my
entire life, and now all of a sudden I have to deal with all _this_!&#34;
She waved her arm around, indicating the surrounding forest.</p>

<p>&#34;You want to know how to deal with all this? By killing, that's how.&#34;
The hawk regarded her calmly. &#34;That's how things work around here.
Something tries to kill you, you kill it. Something looks like food
to you, you kill it. It's that simple. Some things have to die so
that others can live. It can't be done nicely, it can't be done
politely, it just has to be done, period.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow fell silent. She looked at the fish, darting around, each one
full of life. She thought of Oz, his mind consumed by madness.</p>

<p>She was a predator. She was a Garou.</p>

<p>She was a human.</p>

<p>She leapt up, startling the hawk, and ran off into the forest.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Oz tracked the faint scent to a small cabin, hidden in a forest glade.
The ground burned when he walked on it, it was so full of the spirit
of Gaia, the Jealous Mother. He ignored the pain and smell of burning
flesh. Each step brought him closer to her.</p>

<p>He reached the front door, and shifting into Crinos, nearly ripped the
door off its hinges in his haste. Inside, he saw a large man who
fairly _reeked_ of nature, and he saw...the Slayer. She stood near
the front door, silver blade bared to the firelight.</p>

<p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; He snarled, taking a fearless step toward the armed
Slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;You're too late, Oz, she's not here.&#34;</p>

<p>Not here... Oz looked around, noticing that even though her scent was
present, Willow was nowhere to be found. That could only mean...</p>

<p>&#34;The Umbra,&#34; Oz laughed triumphantly. &#34;The Umbra!&#34; He ran outside
again, followed closely by the smaller Spiral. Buffy cast a puzzled
glance over at Artur, and ran after them.</p>

<p>She ran around the side of the cabin just in time to see them reach
the small stream and use its reflective surface to slip into the
Spirit World.</p>

<p>Buffy ran back inside the cabin. &#34;They're going after Willow, we have
to follow them!&#34;</p>

<p>Artur looked at Buffy sadly. &#34;I cannot. I cannot travel into the
Spirit World at will, as can the Garou. It is not a gift that the
Great Mother has given us.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy clenched her jaw. &#34;You can't, but I can.&#34; She ran outside,
heading for the stream.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow jogged through the forest, yelling as she ran. &#34;Bear!&#34; She
screamed. &#34;Show yourself! Bear!&#34;</p>

<p>An ear-splitting roar brought her to a stumbling halt. Standing
before her on his hind legs, massive front paws tipped with huge claws
waving threateningly in front of her, was Bear. &#34;You dare to call
me!&#34; He roared. &#34;Daughter and Sister to murderers! I should crush
you!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow had had enough. Shifting into Crinos, her nine-foot form still
only half as tall as Bear, she yelled, &#34;Listen to me! I never killed
anyone, and I never wanted to, either! But _you're_ not making
anything any easier by continuing this, this _vendetta_! I don't know
if you've looked around the world lately, but no one could give a
flying fig about who killed who thousands of years ago! All I want is
to get past it, and get on to fighting the Wyrm. Now, can you
understand that, or do I have to say it more slowly this time?&#34;</p>

<p>Bear dropped to all fours, seemingly taken aback by her boldness. He
glared at her, but didn't attack. He didn't say anything, either, so
Willow continued. &#34;Now, I need your help to save a good person, but
I'm not going to beg for it. People tried to give me some advice on
how to deal with you, from begging to bribing, but I figure either
you're going to help me or you're not. If you do, I appreciate it,
and you can be sure I'll do whatever I can to honor you. If you
don't, well...&#34; Willow shrugged. &#34;I'll live, but a good person will
be lost to the Wyrm, and I don't want that to happen. I don't think
you do, either.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't think anyone has dared to speak to me that way,&#34; Bear
growled.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, well, there's a first time for everything, isn't there?&#34; Willow
shifted back into human form, truly dwarfed by the great Bear now.
She still didn't appear to be afraid. &#34;I've never had to deal with
animal spirits before. I've lived like a human for nineteen years,
and that's a heck of a long time, you know? My only experience with
animals was at the zoo, or Discovery channel documentaries. And you
know, things aren't nearly as calm and polite as they seem to be on
TV.&#34; She exhaled, brushing her hair from her eyes. &#34;I'm a Glass
Walker. Now, I'm not real sure what that means, but I'm pretty sure
it means that I was never supposed to go without indoor plumbing. To
be honest, I know I'm not cut out for this whole nature thing, as
beautiful as it is. As much as I want to protect it, and fight the
Wyrm, it's never going to be the place for me.</p>

<p>&#34;All I want to do is help my friend, and save him from the Wyrm.&#34;</p>

<p>Bear stared at her for a long moment. Finally, he said, &#34;What do you
need to know?&#34;</p>
