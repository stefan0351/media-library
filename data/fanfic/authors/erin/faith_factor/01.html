<p>&#34;Down!&#34; Buffy yelled at me, and I dropped like a stone, kicking the
vamp behind me in his kneecap.  I felt a satisfying crunch under the
heel of my boot, and the vamp howled.</p>

<p>&#34;YEAH! Take that, you fuckin' bloodsucker!&#34; I yelled, and followed it
up with a kick to his face.  The vamp went down and I was on 'em in a
second, driving the stake home.  I rose and dusted off my jacket; B
had already taken care of hers.</p>

<p>&#34;Ooh, yeah! That really gets the juices flowing,&#34; I said.  I was
bouncing up and down, trying to work off the excess adrenaline.
&#34;What's the matter, B, you sick? You only got two that time.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I figured I'd let you have most of them, since you so obviously
needed the practice,&#34; B replied, throwing me a wink.  She's such a
crack-up.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, I really missed this, B.  Just you and me, the Chosen Two.
Wicked cool.&#34;</p>

<p>B smiled at me, and wrapped her arms around my waist.  &#34;Yeah, I missed
it too.  I missed you.&#34;</p>

<p>I didn't answer, just leaned in for a quick kiss.  Throwing my arm
around her shoulder, I said, &#34;So, what's the plan for the rest of the
night?&#34;</p>

<p>I tried to keep my voice casual, but B saw right through me, as usual.
&#34;I bet I know why you're asking,&#34; she said, a sly smile on her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Slaying always gets me wicked hungry.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Among other things,&#34; she said, chuckling.  She had me there.  &#34;My mom
gets back in town tomorrow morning, so all we have to do is clean up.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said, my voice somewhat wistful.  &#34;Too bad, cuz...&#34;  I
stopped, deciding it would be best if I just shut the hell up before I
made a fool of myself.</p>

<p>&#34;Because why?&#34; Trust her to ask.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, nothing.&#34;</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at me.  &#34;Please tell me.&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged.  &#34;It's just...I really kinda liked hangin', and, ya know,
eating, and watching TV...and stuff.&#34;  God, what a dope.  I can't even
tell her that I liked living with her.</p>

<p>And since when did that happen? I've always been more of a 'my space'
kinda gal; even when I had boyfriends I never liked living with 'em.
Always such a pain in the ass trying to share your space with someone
else.  But with B, it just didn't seem that way.</p>

<p>She didn't laugh or anything.  She just smiled, and said, &#34;I know.  I
feel the same way.&#34;  We started walking again, crossing through the
cemetery on our way home.</p>

<p>&#34;So, those vamps seem a little tougher than usual?&#34; I asked, hoping to
change the subject.</p>

<p>B nodded.  &#34;Yeah, Adam's been putting some bad thoughts in their
heads.  It's almost like he's making them fearless.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Whatever.&#34;  I shrugged.  &#34;Just means they'll learn otherwise.  After
all, we're the Chosen Two, right?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Right.&#34;  She smiled up at me, and I felt my insides turn to mush.
Pissed me off.  I don't do the love thing, at least, I hadn't done it
until now.</p>

<p>Maybe I should recap for those just joining us.  Buffy loves me.  And
I love her.  End of recap.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>So I was waiting upstairs, pacing back and forth while B was
downstairs with her mom, &#34;explaining the situation.&#34;  I had nothing
against Joyce; she was actually a pretty spunky chick for someone's
mom.  Hell, she stood up to me even though for all she knew I would
have killed her without a second thought.</p>

<p>Would I have? Hell, maybe.  I was so fucked up at that point, I
couldn't see past hurting Buffy anyway I could.  But it wasn't part of
the plan.  I was just gonna hold her for a bit, really mess with her
to get to B.  But she still did a pretty good job of standing up to
me.</p>

<p>Ah, hell.  I never could handle suspense.  I opened the door a crack,
listening carefully.</p>

<p>&#34;...telling you mom, she's a lot different now.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Is she? How can you tell? She's dangerous, Buffy.  She doesn't see
any problem in hurting people to get what she wants.&#34;</p>

<p>Hmm.  Fair enough.  In my defense, though, I also don't go out of my
way to hurt anyone...anymore.</p>

<p>&#34;She's really making an effort this time.  You know, mom, I probably
made at least as many mistakes as she did.  If I had been a better
friend, none of this would have happened.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;People don't change, Buffy, not just like that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It wasn't just like that, mom.  It really took some trust.  But I
believe her, and so do Willow and Giles.&#34;</p>

<p>I heard Joyce sigh.  &#34;Ok, honey, I believe you think she's sincere.
But I'd like to talk to her, just the two of us.&#34;</p>

<p>Oh crap.</p>

<p>&#34;I think I can arrange that.&#34;</p>

<p>I eased the door closed, and parked myself on B's bed, flipping
through some magazine.  Wasn't long after that I heard the door open,
and B came in.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, I think I've got my mom talked down.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You've got a big 'but' there, somewhere.&#34;</p>

<p>She had to think about that for a second before she got it.  &#34;Yeah,
well, she wants to talk to you alone.&#34;</p>

<p>I tossed the magazine back on B's desk and stood up.  &#34;I can do alone.
I've been doing it for a long time now.&#34;  I wasn't scared really, just
uncomfortable.  But I wasn't weak or anything, I could pull my shit
together.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok.&#34;  She wrapped her arms around my waist.  &#34;Hey.  I love you.&#34;</p>

<p>I smiled back at her.  &#34;I love you too.  You didn't happen to tell
your mom...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Are you kidding? One bombshell at a time, please.&#34;</p>

<p>So I went downstairs to face the lioness in her den; only it wasn't a
den, it was a living room, and she was watching me like a hawk.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34;  She nodded to an empty chair, on the other side of the
coffee table from her.  Whether that was for her protection or mine, I
wouldn't have placed bets.</p>

<p>&#34;Joyce.&#34;  I sat down, resisting the impulse to plant my boots on her
coffee table.  Not the way to impress the girlfriend's mother,
especially not one that you held hostage.</p>

<p>&#34;My daughter tells me that you and she have worked things out.&#34;</p>

<p>Oh boy, she had no idea.  I just smiled, and said, &#34;Yeah, we have.
B--uh, Buffy's been really great about that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>

<p>Huh? &#34;Why her, why me, why what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why are you trying to work things out? Don't you just want to kill us
all and get over it?&#34;</p>

<p>Ouch.  Well, I suppose I deserved that, to a point.  &#34;No, I don't.
I'd much rather have Buffy as a friend than go through life knowing I
had hurt her again.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How do I know you're telling the truth?&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged.  &#34;You don't.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll tell you what the problem is,&#34; Joyce said, really milking it
now.  &#34;The problem is that you gladly hurt people if they don't give
you what you want.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't do that anymore.&#34;  Ok, I admit I deserve some of this, but I
hate people who ride my ass.  She was starting to piss me off now.</p>

<p>&#34;So who's to say that the next time Buffy or some of her friends tell
you no, that you won't turn homicidal _again_?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because,&#34; I said, teeth really clenched now, &#34;I won't.  I don't want
to hurt them.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Until you get in an argument and you feel they've 'abandoned' you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Listen!&#34; I yelled, bolting out of my chair.  I had had about enough.
&#34;You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.  Everyone made
mistakes back then, including me, including Buffy.  How do you think
your 'can-do-no-wrong' daughter put me in a coma, huh? She stuck a
goddamn knife in my gut.  She came after me to kill me and feed me to
her vamp boyfriend.  So don't tell me about homicidal, cuz I know it
from both ends!&#34;</p>

<p>I stared at her hard, saw that she was really uncomfortable now.  I
caught the slightest glance she threw over my shoulder, and I looked
to see Buffy standing at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>Oh, god.  She had a sickened look on her face, and I knew it was
because I had put it there.  She turned and ran up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I ran after her, catching the bedroom door just as she was
about to close it.  She walked over, sat on her bed, and covered her
face with her hands.</p>

<p>I stood there for the longest time watching her, wanting to take a
step forward and put my arm around her, but I couldn't.  I couldn't
get my legs to move, I just stood there, hands clenched.  &#34;Shit,&#34; I
said again, &#34;I'm sorry, Buffy, I'm really, really sorry.  I didn't
want to ever go back to that stuff again, but it's just... sometimes
I'm just stupid.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're not stupid.&#34;  She was all sniffly, and her voice was breaking.
&#34;It's not your fault.  I just feel really guilty about that whole
thing.  I still have nightmares...about hurting you, about us
fighting.  I hate it, I hate that we ever felt that way about each
other...&#34;</p>

<p>I finally got my feet to move, and I sat down next to her and hugged
her, feeling wicked awful about bringing it up.  We had promised each
other clean slates, and here I was dredging up some piss-poor ancient
history.  &#34;Hey, it's ok.  What's done is done.  If you can forgive me
for the Angel thing, then I can forgive you for that tiny little coma
you put me in, ok?&#34; And as long as I can keep my fuckin' mouth shut,
we don't have to even think about it again.</p>

<p>She seemed to chuckle a little at that.  &#34;Ok.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Great.  I don't think it would be a good idea if your mom and I talk
to each other again today, though.&#34;</p>

<p>She nodded.  &#34;Yeah, I'm really sorry for the kind of stuff she was
putting you through.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She's got some reason to be suspicious, hey? She might have gone a
little overboard, though...&#34; I mumbled.</p>

<p>Buffy blew her nose and stood up, grabbing her bag.  &#34;I'll just say
goodbye, and then we can go back to the dorm.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Didn't take long before B and I were walking back to campus.  Joyce
and I didn't say two words to each other when we left.  Fine by me; I
knew we'd have to have it out again soon, if only when Buffy told her
mom about us.  Hmm.  Speaking of which...</p>

<p>&#34;Will you...I mean, are you going to be telling your mom about us?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I thought I'd practice first on Willow and Giles...maybe Xander too
if he ever emerges from his hole.&#34;  We hadn't seen or heard from
Xander since the meeting a couple of days ago, when we told him I was
still in town.  Either he didn't want to deal, or his girlfriend found
out about us screwing.  From what B tells me, she's the vengeful type.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.  Ok.&#34;</p>

<p>She smiled and slipped her hand into mine.  I got a little tingle
every time she touched me; it's either because of Slayer powers, or
I'm really getting pathetically mushy about our whole relationship.  I
choose Slayer powers.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not trying to hide you, don't worry.  I want everyone to know how
happy I am.  It's just a little complicated.&#34;</p>

<p>Ah.  I nodded.  &#34;Not every day you involve yourself with an
ex-homicidal lunatic.&#34;</p>

<p>She frowned.  &#34;Well, not that so much as the fact that you're a
chick.&#34;</p>

<p>I laughed; I couldn't help it.  &#34;Oh yeah, guess so.&#34;  The whole sex
issue seemed a little silly considering how much else we had overcome
to get this far.  But it did still matter, I guess.  &#34;Eh, doesn't
bother me.  I've had girlfriends before.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah? Yeah, I guess you probably did, huh? Did you ever have to worry
about coming out?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;To who? I didn't have anyone else except me.&#34;  No family, and the few
friends I did have, mostly guys, just asked if they could watch.
Which they could, sometimes.</p>

<p>We made it back to the dorm, and Red was there reading a book.  &#34;Hey
guys.&#34;  She seemed a little down; guess things with Blonde Wicca Chick
weren't working out.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey Will.  Everything ok?&#34; B dropped her bag and went over to sit by
Red.  I just parked it on B's bed and kept quiet.</p>

<p>&#34;I dunno.  I don't think so.  Tara's been avoidance person lately.  We
used to spend a lot of time together, but now...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I wish I knew.  Whenever I try to talk to her, she gets all red and
stuttery.&#34;  Red smiled; just thinking about her Wicca chick was
getting her all mushy, you could tell.  &#34;We haven't done any spells
together in the past couple of days, either.  Every time I ask her,
she makes up some excuse.&#34;</p>

<p>I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe that Tara would just let
Red stew like that, when it was obvious to anyone that Red was
head-over-heels for her.  I also couldn't believe that Red didn't
realize it herself.  Well, fuck that.  This was getting pretty damn
annoying.</p>

<p>I cracked my knuckles and walked over to sit next to Red.  If there's
one thing I knew, it's girl-on-girl action.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you like her?&#34; I asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Of course I like her, she's a great friend.&#34;</p>

<p>I shook my head.  &#34;I mean, do you _like_ her?&#34; Nope, baffled look
still there.  Ok, time to be blunt.  &#34;Do you want to do the down and
dirty? You know, make the beast? Get goin' on with some hot lesbo
action?&#34;</p>

<p>Ok, baffled look became shocked look.  &#34;Wha...I...She...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy cleared her throat.  &#34;I think what Faith is trying to say is, do
you love her?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Love her?&#34; Red squeaked.  &#34;I don't--I mean, I do, but I don't...
Yeah.&#34;  She finished, with a sigh.  &#34;I mean, I think so.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Excellent, no worries then,&#34; I said, clapping her on the shoulder.
&#34;Just go over there and tell her how you feel.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; All this time I didn't think it was possible for a human voice
to hit that note.  &#34;I can't do that!&#34;</p>

<p>I raised an eyebrow.  &#34;Why not? It's pretty damn obvious she feels the
same way.&#34;</p>

<p>Red just stared at me.</p>

<p>&#34;Look, trust me on this.  I know the signs.  Hell, I made the signs.
You guys have 'shyly cute couple' written all over you.  Just go and
talk to her.  Worse comes to worst, at least you guys will be talking
again.&#34;</p>

<p>Red seemed to think about that, and she glanced over at Buffy, who
nodded back to her.  Finally Red nodded and grabbed her jacket.
&#34;Yeah, I think I'll do that.  Faith...thanks.&#34;  She smiled at me, and
I grinned back at her.</p>

<p>&#34;No problem, Red.  Good luck, and don't forget if it feels good on
you, it probably does on her too.  Light her up like a Christmas
tree.&#34;  I got some personal satisfaction out of the shocked look she
gave me before she left.</p>

<p>B just shook her head and smiled.  &#34;You're pretty good at that, you
know?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Good at what, embarrassing Red?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That too.&#34;  She dragged me over to her bed and pulled me down on top
of her.  She could be pretty butch when she wanted to be.  One kiss
sent my blood racing.  Two kisses, and I was fighting to get rid of
all those damn clothes that were in my way, both mine and hers.  Three
kisses -- and we were interrupted by a knock on the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I said, as B and I scrambled for clothing.  I pulled my shirt
over my head and backed up behind the door.  B straightened her
clothes and opened the door a crack.</p>

<p>&#34;Riley.&#34;  Hmm, this could get interesting.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Um, hi.  Willow said you were getting back today.  I know you said
you needed to think things out, but you also said you'd call in a
couple days, and...it's been a couple days.&#34;  The poor boy.  You could
just tell that Beefstick was jonesing for his Buffy fix.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I want to talk to you...hold on just a sec.&#34;  Again she shut
the door in his face.  Harsh.</p>

<p>She turned around to talk to me, but before she could say anything, I
said, &#34;Oh no.  Sorry B, but there's no way I'm going back in that
closet, not on any level.&#34;  A sudden chilling thought occurred to me.
&#34;Unless you're planning on going back to him...&#34;</p>

<p>B winced at the look I gave her, and pulled me into a hug.  &#34;I love
you.  I want to be with you.  But I care about Riley; I don't want to
hurt him.  Let's just...see if we can make this as gentle as possible,
ok?&#34;</p>

<p>I let out the breath I was holding.  &#34;Yeah, ok.  You know me, gentle
as a kitten.&#34;  I took a seat at B's desk, leaning back and propping up
my feet.</p>

<p>B shook her head a little, and then opened the door.  &#34;C'mon in.&#34;
Riley walked in and gave me a look.  &#34;Hello,&#34; he said; his voice was
pleasant enough, but he had a look on his face like he knew he should
hate me, but wasn't sure why.  Guess he hadn't placed the face yet.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey.&#34; I said, stifling a grin.  I'm probably a real bitch for saying
this, but I like winning.  I like it a lot.</p>

<p>Buffy walked over and sat on her bed.  &#34;Riley, I needed a few days to
get some things straight in my mind--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Are we going to talk about this here, with...&#34; He waved a hand in my
direction.</p>

<p>&#34;What I have to say concerns her as much as you or me,&#34; Buffy said.</p>

<p>He took a closer look at me now.  &#34;Faith.&#34;  Man, he was bitter.  Can't
say as I'm surprised, though.</p>

<p>There really must be no justice in this world.  Here I was, the person
who tried to make B's life miserable by sleeping with her boyfriend,
and she falls in love with me.  And now here is said boyfriend, as
sweet and vanilla a person to ever come out of the hideously dull
midwest, about to be dumped.</p>

<p>Well, cry me a fuckin' river.  I saw her first.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, Faith.  These past couple of weeks have really shaken things up,
made me look at things in my life--&#34;</p>

<p>Riley interrupted her.  &#34;Why is she _here_? I've heard nothing except
how she,&#34; he pointed at me now, &#34;is a criminally insane psycho killer.
And now she's hanging out in your dorm room like she's your best
friend? Buffy, what the hell is going on here?&#34;</p>

<p>B was trying her best to get Beefstick calmed down.  &#34;Look, Riley,
things between Faith and I have been very complicated in the past.
It's really not a pretty story, in fact some parts get really ugly.
But we're not dwelling on that anymore.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And what about all the terrible stuff she's done recently?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I've forgiven her for that.&#34;  B's voice was pretty quiet; I could
tell this was really hurting her.  I wanted to sit next to her, put my
arm around her like she did for me when I was hurting, but...</p>

<p>&#34;You've forgiven her, but you can't forgive me.&#34;</p>

<p>B shook her head.  &#34;It's not a matter of forgiving you.  I know you
didn't cheat on me, not really.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Then what's the deal, Buffy?&#34; He glanced at me sideways, and knelt
down in front of her, all 'sensitive new age guy' and shit.  He
wrapped his hands around hers, and I wanted to put my fist through his
face.  I almost did it, too, but I knew that B didn't want that and
I'd be making trouble for myself.  So I held off, just barely.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't be with you anymore, Riley.&#34;  She never looked at him; if I
knew B, I'd say she felt too guilty about hurting him.</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Damn, he was going to be an asshole and press her on it, I was
sure of it.</p>

<p>&#34;It's...There's someone else.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Who?&#34; Riley glanced at me, and I knew he already knew the answer, he
just wanted Buffy to have to say it.  Fuck that, this interview is
over.</p>

<p>&#34;That's it, just give her a break,&#34; I said, getting out of my chair
and opening the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Who?&#34; He repeated; fuckin' Beefstick just ignored me.  Well that's
it, I tried to play nice.</p>

<p>&#34;I told you, _that's it_,&#34; I said, grabbing Beefstick and tossing him
toward the door like he was a ragdoll.  He didn't put up much of a
fight; he tried, though.  I didn't mind.  I just pushed him outside
into the hall and shut the door behind me.  &#34;Just back off.  She's
obviously made her choice.&#34;  I grinned and lowered my voice so not
even Slayer hearing could pick it up past a few feet.  &#34;Why would she
want to bother with a mortal man when she could have a Slayer?&#34; I saw
the hatred in his eyes, and my grin widened.  I licked my top lip
slowly and turned my back on him, going back into the room.</p>

<p>B was still sitting in the same position as before.  I walked over to
her and put my arm around her shoulders, feeling her relax.</p>

<p>&#34;That wasn't fun,&#34; she said softly.</p>

<p>It could have been worse, I thought, but I decided that the story
about one of my mom's boyfriends holding her at gunpoint could wait
for another time.  &#34;Nope,&#34; I said, moving to lay down on the bed and
pulling her with me.  She wrapped her arm around me, and I felt her
smile.</p>

<p>&#34;Thanks for being here.&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged one-shouldered, not wanting to disturb her leaning on the
other one.  &#34;Hell, it's nothing.  If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
have had to do that in the first place.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I would have.  Riley is sweet and nice and everything, but he's
not who I thought he was when I started falling for him.&#34;  She stopped
talking, and I really didn't have anything to say.  Didn't take long
before her breathing got regular, like she was asleep.</p>

<p>I just watched her.  Wasn't the first time I watched her sleep, and
every single time I did, the thoughts were the same.  This is too
perfect.  Of all the people who want Buffy, there's only one person
she wants -- me.</p>

<p>I should leave.  My mind is screaming at me to leave, but my body
won't budge, won't move a muscle.  Because I know that I don't want to
give this up.  I can't.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I must've dozed off or something, because next thing I knew I heard a
key in the door.  I glanced over at the clock and saw that we were out
for a couple of hours.  That's ok, B needed it.</p>

<p>Red came in, grinning like she just ate the fuckin' canary.  Guess
things went pretty well with the Wicca chick.  She looked over at us,
so mushed out that she didn't even realize Buffy and I were in a
clinch.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey Red,&#34; I said, and I felt B wake up.</p>

<p>&#34;Hi guys!&#34; She said, obviously excited.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey Will,&#34; B replied, rolling off of me and rubbing her eyes.  &#34;How'd
everything go.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Great!&#34; She was so goddamn excited she almost squeaked.  &#34;Tara and I
talked...we're going out to dinner tomorrow night.&#34;  She looked
between Buffy and I, trying to gauge our response.  Hell, she should
know it by now.</p>

<p>&#34;That's great!&#34; B grabbed her up in a big hug, and I couldn't keep
from grinning.  Red really was a pretty cool chick, and now that she
had Wicca chick to loosen her up I figured we'd get along pretty well.
&#34;What are you going to wear?&#34;</p>

<p>Red gasped.  &#34;I don't know!&#34; She and B immediately went into &#34;fashion
consultant mode&#34;, and I just rolled my eyes.</p>

<p>They spent a good half hour trying to decide on Red's outfit for her
date; they finally settled on a light sweater and skirt combo.  It
looked good, in a wholesome sort of way.</p>

<p>The whole time I could see that B's mind was working away, trying to
come up with a good way to tell Red about us.  It wasn't a pretty
sight, and I could tell that if B didn't get it out soon, she was
going to start second-guessing telling her at all.  And after
second-guessing comes what I call 'reality leakage.'</p>

<p>I've seen it before with girlfriends who were closeted, but really
didn't want to be.  They bring up all sorts of weird topics of
conversation, in the hopes that they get their perfect chance to tell
family or friends or whoever that they're now dating a girl.  Usually
they end up chickening out, and just getting a rep for being a freak.
It's got to come out somehow, so it usually ends up leaking out around
the edges.</p>

<p>It better not go that far, because if it does, I'll have to do
something about it.</p>

<p>Luckily, Red saved the day.  &#34;Oh! I forgot to tell you before.  Riley
was looking for you.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy frowned.  &#34;He found us.&#34;  Her eyes shifted, like she was
nervous.  Hell, she probably was.  She'd never done this before.  &#34;I
told him I couldn't see him any more.&#34;</p>

<p>Red just nodded, like she was expecting it.</p>

<p>&#34;To tell the truth, there's someone else,&#34; Buffy continued.</p>

<p>Red just nodded again, and had a hard time not grinning this time.  I
almost laughed.  I wonder when the little witch figured it out.  &#34;I
figured as much...when I came in here and saw you and Faith all
snuggled up together.&#34;</p>

<p>B blushed, and I choked.  &#34;Snuggle? Now wait a goddamn minute, Red, I
do _not_ snuggle.&#34;</p>

<p>She just kept grinning.  &#34;Ok.  Cuddled, then.&#34;</p>

<p>I mock growled at the little witch, and B burst out laughing.  &#34;Down
girl.&#34;  She smiled at Red.  &#34;You're the first person we've told...
Well, except for Riley.  And if you hadn't been preoccupied with a
certain blonde witch, then you really would have been the first.&#34;</p>

<p>Red just smiled and pulled B into a big hug.  &#34;I'm happy for you
guys,&#34; she said, and looked over at me.  I knew she meant it, and I
couldn't help smiling in response.  Best of all, she seemed to really
snap Buffy out of the funk Riley put her in.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, Will, there's something...a favor I want to ask you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Anything, Buffy, you know that.&#34;  Red caught the serious tone of
Buffy's voice; made me wish I knew what the hell she was talking
about.</p>

<p>&#34;Now that the heat's off of Faith a little bit, I was wondering if
there's anything you can do to the police records, you know, work a
little of that hacker magic.&#34;  Oh.  That.</p>

<p>&#34;Cracker,&#34; Red corrected automatically.  She thought for a sec, and
then said, &#34;Yeah, I think there is.&#34;  She hopped up and down like she
was excited or something, and sat down and started typing away at her
computer.  B and I just looked at each other and sat down to watch TV.
Red wouldn't even talk to us until she was done.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Red said, leaning back and stretching.  &#34;The police have been
taken care of.  I messed with their profile of Faith; I even changed
your address, height, weight, race, everything.&#34;  B got up and went to
take a look over Red's shoulder.</p>

<p>I raised an eyebrow.  &#34;I don't feel any different.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You look pretty good for a five foot tall Samoan woman,&#34; Buffy said.</p>

<p>&#34;Just to be sure, I modified the status of the case, so that you
aren't even wanted for questioning anymore.  Oh, and one other
thing...&#34;  She looked at us like she was _so_ fuckin' pleased with
herself she couldn't stand it.  &#34;That apartment the Mayor bought for
you? I've switched the title from his name to yours.&#34;</p>

<p>I just stared at Red; I almost couldn't believe my ears.  &#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It belongs to you now.  I wasn't sure what to put down for your last
name, so I put down Summers.  We can change it.&#34;</p>

<p>I looked at Buffy for a long time and she looked at me right back,
smiling.  &#34;Faith Summers...&#34; I said.  &#34;Nah.  I think I like that just
fine.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok.&#34;  Red did some additional tapping away and soon after shut down
her computer.  Grabbing her jacket, she said, &#34;I'm going over to
Tara's.  There's a spell we can do that will cloud the police's memory
of you, Faith, so that they have to rely on those fake computer
records.&#34;</p>

<p>I smirked.  &#34;You're going over to Tara's...to cast spells.&#34;  Yeah,
right.</p>

<p>She blushed.  &#34;Among other things.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't do anything I wouldn't do,&#34; B added.  Red just grinned.</p>

<p>&#34;No fear of that, is there?&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Faith Summers.  What the fuck was I doing? Damn, girl, when you fall
you fall _hard_.  A few days together and you're ready to rent the
fuckin' U-Haul.</p>

<p>This isn't me.  Since when is this me?</p>

<p>Since B was willing to share her life with me, that's when.  It's what
I wanted all along, wasn't it? Poor, pitiful Faith.  Got no home, got
no family, got no friends.  Only... Now I have a home, family, and
friends.  So what the hell is the problem?</p>

<p>I'll tell you what the problem is.  The same goddamn thing that comes
up every single time I start to get close to someone.  That feeling
like it's all going to go away, like I'm going to fuck it up like I
always do.</p>

<p>&#34;What'cha thinking?&#34; B asks me.  She must've noticed I'm not really
watching the TV.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll fuck it up, as usual.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No you won't.&#34;  It's a familiar speech by now, but one which made me
feel a little better every time I hear her say it.  &#34;You're stuck with
me, because I'm not letting you go.  I love you too much.&#34;</p>

<p>I smile and shake my head.  Un-fucking-believable, what she does to
me.  &#34;I love you too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Glad to hear it.  You want to go check out your kinda-new place?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.  I think I do.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Guess whatever spell Red &amp; Tara did worked; either that, or the cops
lost interest in me, because there was no one watching my old
apartment.</p>

<p>&#34;How do we get in?&#34; B asked me.</p>

<p>&#34;I hid a spare key on the balcony...go ahead and go on up, and I'll
meet you at the front door.&#34;  I ran around the side of the building
and climbed the tree that was there, easily making the jump from the
tree to the adjoining balcony.  I searched under a couple of loose
stones and, sure enough, my key was still here.</p>

<p>Normally, balcony doors don't lock from the outside as well as the
inside, but this was a little modification the boss made at my request
a long time ago.  See, when you're out at all hours doing
god-only-knows-what, you don't want a whole lot of people seeing you
coming and going from your apartment.  It's just not a good idea.</p>

<p>I walked through the dark apartment; very little light filtered in
from outside, seeing as how it was nighttime and there weren't many
streetlights, and it took me a minute for my eyes to adjust.  I
noticed that all my furniture was still where I had put it.  Even the
comic book I was reading when Buffy came over that last time was
there, laying on the floor.  I bent over to pick it up, and brushed
off the thick layer of dust.</p>

<p>I shouldn't have come back.  Too many bad fuckin' memories here.</p>

<p>I heard a soft knock on the door, and I walked over and opened it.</p>

<p>B stepped inside and looked around.  I guess I really should give her
the tour, since the last time she was here it wasn't exactly a social
call.  I rubbed at my stomach, thinking I felt a dull ache there where
a scar would be, if I were anyone less than a Slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;It's pretty dark in here...do the lights work?&#34; B asked quietly, like
she didn't want to disturb the moment or something.</p>

<p>&#34;I dunno...&#34;  I went over and switched on the overhead track lights.
They worked; a little too well, actually, damn brightness made me
blink a few times before my eyes adjusted.</p>

<p>&#34;I should have known Willow would have thought of the electricity,&#34;
she said, smiling.  &#34;She's very thorough.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Isn't that stealing, B?&#34; I asked, with a little bit of a hard edge to
my voice.  I couldn't help it, this place was starting to get to me.</p>

<p>She looked at me a second before she answered.  &#34;Yeah, I guess it is,
but...&#34; She shrugged.  &#34;It's not like being a Slayer leaves a whole
lot of time for mundane work.  Considering all the good we do, I'm
sure that Southern California Edison can spend a few pennies for a
good cause.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Careful, B, you're starting to sound like me.&#34;  I walked over to one
of the leather chairs, the one that the boss liked to sit in when he
was visiting.</p>

<p>A sudden thought hit me, and I looked over at the window, the one B
and I crashed through during that last fight.  The boss had it
replaced.</p>

<p>He knew I'd be back.  He had confidence in me, in his Faith.  And I
fucked him over, when it came down to it, I failed him.</p>

<p>But if I hadn't failed, B would be dead.  Most everyone in this
goddamn town would be dead.</p>

<p>It's never easy, is it? Nothing in my life is ever just goddamn easy.</p>

<p>B must've gotten some clue that something was wrong, cuz she came up
to me and wrapped her arms around my waist.  Bad idea.</p>

<p>&#34;It was easy for _you_, wasn't it?&#34; My voice was hard, almost
accusing.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Coming here, killing me.  Killing the boss.  Easy choice for you to
make.&#34;</p>

<p>She let go, stepping back a couple of feet.  I missed her already.
&#34;If you think that was easy, you're wrong.&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged.  &#34;Sure didn't look hard to me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't do this.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't do what?&#34; I knew exactly fucking what.  &#34;I'm just saying it was
a pretty easy choice for you to make.  I had to choose between two
people that I loved.  The _only_ two people that I loved.&#34;  I looked
out through the window, imagining that I could still see the broken
glass on the floor, the proof of violence.</p>

<p>&#34;You think you're the only person who had to make that choice?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;As a matter of fact.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I had to choose between you and Angel.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Big choice there, the love of your life or the chick you hated with a
fiery passion.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't hate you, Faith; that's the point.&#34;  I heard her sigh, and
she walked up behind me again.  Didn't try to hug me, just put her
hand on my shoulder.  &#34;Even back then, I was falling for you.&#34;</p>

<p>What? I turned around and looked at her, but she wasn't playing me.
&#34;You can't be serious.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Dead serious.&#34;  She looked up at me, her gorgeous hazel eyes never
leaving mine.  C'mon, try to pull it together, Faith, she's talking.
&#34;I loved you back then.  At the risk of inflating your ego, I'll just
say you were gorgeous, impetuous, wild, confident -- everything I
wanted to be, you already were.  And you understood me, really
understood what it was like to be a Slayer.  No one else did, not even
Giles.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why? Why didn't you tell me?&#34;</p>

<p>She smiled, but not because she was happy; it was more of a self-pity
thing, I could recognize it a mile away.  &#34;You weren't the only one
who was 'fucked up' back then, Faith.  It was horrible, to have Angel
but not have him, to try to deal with High School, Slaying, SATs, and
then the Mayor and the Watchers...&#34;  She ran a hand through her hair,
steadying herself.  Like the whole thing gave her a headache.  &#34;But
the honest truth of it was that I didn't even recognize it in myself.
If you asked me, I would have been able to tell you what lesbians or
bisexuals were, but I never, ever thought that what I was feeling for
you made me one.  I just knew it was...different.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So, it was a choice between me and Angel, and you chose him.&#34;  Can't
let up on her for a second, can I?</p>

<p>She shook her head.  &#34;It was more than that.  More than just Angel's
life or yours.  The Mayor...he wanted to destroy the whole town.&#34;  She
sat down on the edge of the bed, shoulders slumped.  &#34;The choice I
made wasn't between you or Angel, but at the same time it was the only
one I could have made.&#34;</p>

<p>I couldn't argue.  In her position, wouldn't I have done the same
thing? Probably.  Maybe.  Hell, I don't know.  There was some reason
why I went back to that church, although I'll be damned if I
understand it.</p>

<p>We sat there in silence for a minute.  Thinking.</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I said, shortly.  &#34;About laying all that shit on you.&#34;</p>

<p>She shook her head.  &#34;It's ok.  We never did really talk about it, and
we probably should have.  I know the Mayor meant a lot to you.  I'm
sorry.&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged it off.  &#34;No big deal.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It was a big deal.  You cared about him.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Look, I'm not looking to share and grow here, ok?&#34; I said, walking
over to the window.  &#34;He was fuckin' psycho, and he had to be put
down.  I know that.&#34;</p>

<p>I heard a rustling behind me, and felt her light touch on my
shoulders, turning me around to look at her.  Ah hell, what now.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34;  I loved to hear my name coming from those lips.  I suspected
that Buffy knew it, too.  She knew exactly how to calm me down.  &#34;You
never did allow yourself to mourn for him.  You should, it's not a
good idea to hold it in.&#34;</p>

<p>I shook my head and kissed her, silencing her, at least for the
moment.  When I finally backed away, I said, &#34;I'm not like you, B.  I
can't just share everything and make it all better.  I need time to
think about it, time to deal with it on my own.  You understand?&#34;</p>

<p>She nodded, but she didn't look happy about it.  I figured I knew why.</p>

<p>&#34;I won't shut you out, I promise,&#34; I said, brushing her hair away from
her face.  &#34;As soon as I deal, I'll come talk to you about it, ok?&#34;
Yeah, she looked a lot happier after that.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, Faith,&#34; she said, and hugged me tightly.  I'd be a liar if I said
it didn't make me feel a whole hell of a lot better.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>After that, things seemed to lighten up a little.  I showed B around
the place, which wasn't hard to do since it was more or less a studio.
There was a nice, big bathroom/dressing area/walk in closet, though,
and I was glad to see all my clothes there even if they were a little
dusty.</p>

<p>&#34;Mmm.  Six pairs of black jeans, four pairs of black leather pants...
A remarkably diverse wardrobe you've got here, Faith.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Real funny there, B.  I'll tell ya, those beat the hell out of any of
your little pastel numbers anyday.&#34;  I caught sight of something over
by the TV, and laughed.  &#34;All right!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;All right what?&#34; B said, and followed me over there.  &#34;You got a
Playstation?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah...man, I'm gonna need some money, I'm probably way behind on all
the games right now.&#34;  I turned it on and tossed B a controller.
&#34;C'mon, we'll play.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh no,&#34; she said, looking at the controller like it was some alien
device or something.  &#34;I don't know how.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, I'll teach you,&#34; I said, starting a game of Tekken.  &#34;You'll like
it, it's just like Slaying.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Speaking of which, we should probably run a patrol...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh no you don't,&#34; I said, grabbing her.  &#34;C'mon, just a couple of
quick games and then we can patrol.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Okay...&#34; she sighed.  This was gonna be fun.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;I still can't believe I got my butt kicked so badly!&#34; Buffy said.  We
were walking through the graveyard, looking for fresh vamps.  &#34;I mean,
you haven't practiced in months, I should have done better than
that...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, but you just learned,&#34; I pointed out.  &#34;And besides...I didn't
exactly teach you how to use your special attack.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; She said, stopping and glaring at me.  &#34;You cheated?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't cheat,&#34; I said, mock indignation in my voice.  &#34;I just
strategically withheld information from the enemy.  It's a completely
valid move in warfare.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, you are so in trouble for that...&#34; she said, starting to tickle
me.  Let's get one thing straight, I am _not_ ticklish.  I don't know
how B manages to do it.</p>

<p>I started to laugh, and then I caught a noise somewhere off to the
right.  &#34;Shh!&#34; I said, grabbing B's hands to hold them still.  She
immediately froze, all her Slayer senses on full.  Sure enough, there
was a vamp, about a hundred feet away.  He took one look at us and
took off, leaping gravestones at full speed.</p>

<p>&#34;C'mon!&#34; Buffy yelled, running after him.  I was only a split-second
behind her, and we saw the vamp turn a sharp corner around one of
those family crypts, and disappear from sight.  By the time Buffy and
I got there, we couldn't tell where he ran off to.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, I'll go this way, you go that way,&#34; B said, pointing off down an
adjacent trail, &#34;and if we see anything, we'll yell, ok?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure thing,&#34; I said, running down the trail.  Didn't take too long
before the trail ended in a small clearing with a couple of picnic
benches nearby.  Who the fuck has a picnic in a graveyard, anyway?</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.  It's been a long time.&#34;  I turned around, looking for the
source of the voice.  It came from a vamp, medium height, black hair,
lame-ass goatee, like he wanted to look like Satan or something.  I
recognized him.</p>

<p>&#34;Should I have bothered to remember who the fuck you are?&#34; I said,
pulling a stake from my jacket.  God, what was his name, it was some
lame Mafia ripoff, like Vic, or...</p>

<p>&#34;Vinnie.  I used to work for the Mayor, just like you.&#34;  His eyes
flicked over me.  &#34;So, I see you're back to being the Slayer's lapdog.
Looks like the Mayor had a little too much confidence in you, huh?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why don't you just shut the fuck up, deadboy,&#34; I said, taking a step
toward him.</p>

<p>He held out his hands.  &#34;Now, that's no way to talk to a business
associate.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why the hell would I want to conduct any 'business' with you that
didn't end up with you inside a dustbuster, huh?&#34;</p>

<p>He just smiled.  &#34;Because.  There was one reason why you were with the
boss.  You don't like to lose.&#34;  He walked toward me, like he was
fearless or some shit like that.  &#34;It's all about winning and losing
to you.  You don't Slay because you're trying to beat some great evil,
or defend the innocent.  You Slay because you need to be a winner.&#34;</p>

<p>He walked around me, knowing I wouldn't hurt him.  Knowing I'd listen
to him.</p>

<p>&#34;So you chose the Mayor,&#34; he continued, &#34;because you thought he would
come out on top; and he would have, if the Slayer hadn't kicked your
little white ass, proved that you were, and always would be, second
best.&#34;</p>

<p>Fuck this, no one talked to me like that.  I grabbed him, shoved him
down on one of the picnic benches.  &#34;You don't know when to shut your
mouth, do you asshole.&#34;</p>

<p>He just kept smiling the whole time, the psycho.  &#34;It's all come down
to winning and losing again, Faith.  This time, it's Adam who is going
to be the winner.&#34;  I rolled my eyes.  &#34;Don't believe me? Ask your
master, the little Slayer.  She's fought him, and he's swatted her
like a fly.  She's scared of him, and for good reason.  She's on the
losing side.&#34;</p>

<p>He got up and dusted off his clothes.  &#34;You can be a winner again,
Faith.  You don't have to be second best.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith!&#34; I heard Buffy yelling from up the path, and it distracted me.
By the time I looked back, the fucking vamp was gone.  Didn't take
long before B came into the clearing.  &#34;Any luck?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nah,&#34; I said, glancing around the clearing once more.  &#34;Didn't find
what I was looking for.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, big strikeout for me, too,&#34; B said.  &#34;C'mon, let's go.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure.  Hey B, can I ask you something?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What do you know about Adam?&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy looked at me, all curious.  &#34;Why do you want to know about
Adam?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I was just thinking about him, and what he's doing to the vamps
around here.&#34;  Well, that part wasn't a lie, at least.</p>

<p>She nodded.  &#34;Well, he was some sort of demon/human/machine hybrid
that the Initiative created.  Only, now he's completely out of
control.&#34;  She sighed.  &#34;I only fought him once before, but he's
tough.  Really tough.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You couldn't take him down?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nope.  He acted like he didn't even notice I was there... I've never
fought anything like that before,&#34; she admitted.</p>

<p>&#34;But he's got a weakness or something, right? I mean, everyone has a
weakness.&#34;</p>

<p>She just shrugged.  &#34;If he does, we don't know it.&#34;</p>

<p>That wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear, right then.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once again, I have to ask:</p>

<p>What the fuck was I doing?</p>

<p>I knew that what that goddamn vamp said was right -- or, at least, it
_was_ right.  I didn't enjoy Slaying because of any righteous thrill,
or smug knowledge that I was doing the 'right thing.'  I loved it
because it was excitement, a challenge.  Winning and losing.  And
until B came along, I was all about winning.</p>

<p>She beat me.  She was the only one to put me down.</p>

<p>I looked over to where she slept, red and black blankets pulled up
around her shoulders.  We had come back to my place, and made love
until we fell asleep.  Well, until she fell asleep; I had too much on
my mind, and even Buffy couldn't really quiet the thoughts I was
having.</p>

<p>So I got up, pulled on a sweatshirt and some boxers, and just sat,
staring into space.</p>

<p>I thought about that chick in the alley outside the Bronze.  The one I
saved from being vamped.  That look in her eyes, when she thanked me
-- it had been a long time since the last time I saw it.  When you're
going around killing people for the Mayor, they just don't give you
that same look.  The look they gave was fear; fear was almost as good,
to be honest.  But gratitude, their honest get-down-on-their-knees
thankfulness that you are who you are and you decided to save their
lives -- that was something else entirely.</p>

<p>I decided I liked it.</p>

<p>But did I like it _enough_?</p>

<p>&#34;Faith?&#34; I heard B's soft, sleepy voice from the direction of the bed.
&#34;Everything ok?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.  Yeah, everything's fine.  Just couldn't sleep.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ok...&#34; Her voice was drifting off now.  &#34;Love you...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I love you too.&#34;</p>

<p>Ah hell.  I really did love her.  But, shit, that 'second best'
comment really tore at me, just like that fuckin' vamp knew it would.
I wasn't built to be second best, not to anyone.  Not even Buffy.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;You mind if I borrow a pair of jeans?&#34; B was getting ready for class,
and I was laying in bed, half-asleep.  It took me a long time to get
to sleep last night and I was still pretty wiped.</p>

<p>&#34;Go for it,&#34; I said, opening an eyelid carefully.  &#34;You'll need a
belt.&#34;  Even though I liked my jeans tight, B was a size or two
smaller than me, and they'd be a little baggy on her.</p>

<p>&#34;Thanks.&#34;  She finished getting dressed, pulling on her socks and
shoes.</p>

<p>&#34;You should just leave some of your clothes over here,&#34; I said, before
I even realized what the hell I was saying.</p>

<p>She looked over at me, kinda surprised.  &#34;You wouldn't mind?&#34;</p>

<p>Would I mind, ah hell.  I wouldn't mind if she brought all her
clothes, and stayed with me for the rest of my fuckin' life.  &#34;Nah.  I
mean, if you don't.&#34;</p>

<p>B just smiled, and leaned over to give me a kiss.  &#34;I don't.&#34;  She
grabbed her jacket.  &#34;I've got classes all day; want to meet me
tonight, at the dorm? We can grab some dinner or something.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sounds like a plan,&#34; I mumbled, and went back to sleep.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I had to find something better to do with my afternoons, I decided.
Daytime TV was really starting to piss me off, and you can only play
video games for so long before you start craving the real thing.  So
around dusk I cut through the graveyard on my way to the campus to
meet with B.</p>

<p>I had tried my best to avoid thinking about all the crap that had been
going through my mind lately; so, of course, life threw me a curve.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, if it isn't our favorite Slayer.&#34;  Of course, just my luck.</p>

<p>&#34;Just fuck off, Vinnie, before I dust your ass,&#34; I snarled.  My hand
clenched around the stake in my pocket.</p>

<p>He just looked amused.  Pushed off of the tombstone he was leaning on,
and came walking over.  &#34;You think about my offer?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why the fuck would I want to do that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You disappoint me.  I thought for sure you were a winner.  Instead it
looks like you're just as happy trotting after your little bitch in
heat.&#34;</p>

<p>I grabbed him, shoving the point of my stake against his chest.  &#34;No
one fucking talks about her like that,&#34; I said, gritting my teeth.  I
raised my stake to shove it into his chest, and he didn't even blink.</p>

<p>&#34;You're not going to do that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why the hell not?&#34; I said, and just as I was ready to shove the stake
into his chest, I felt it.</p>

<p>It was like getting hit by a truck, if a truck was the size of
someone's fist.  It sent me flying to the left several feet, and I
crashed against a tombstone, shoulder first.  Fuck, that hurt! Not
even B ever hit me that hard.</p>

<p>I stumbled to my feet and saw Vinnie standing next to some bizarro
demon/machine thing which could only be Adam.  The sucker must've
stood about six and a half feet tall, with muscles which could put
Arnie to shame.  He just looked at me, his head cocked to the side a
little, like a dog.  Or a robot.</p>

<p>&#34;You are Faith.  The extra Slayer.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Just a Slayer, asshole, there's nothing extra about me.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You were an accident, activated upon the death of the Slayer Kendra,
who was also an accident.&#34;  He spoke in a monotone, like he was
reading all this from the goddamn encyclopedia or something.  Slayer,
The.  &#34;After arriving in Sunnydale you turned renegade and took orders
from former Mayor Wilkins.  You fought with your counterpart, who put
you in a coma with acute neural trauma and severe lacerations.&#34;</p>

<p>I glared at Vinnie.  &#34;You feed him all that?&#34;</p>

<p>He just shrugged.  &#34;Some of it.  You'd be surprised how many records
the Initiative had about this town.&#34;  He walked toward me, totally
cool like I didn't just try to kill him.  &#34;Adam knows everything the
Initiative does.  They'll never catch him.  Neither can Buffy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't be too sure about that.&#34;  My voice sounded hollow, even to
myself.  I was never too convincing a liar.</p>

<p>Vinnie chuckled.  &#34;Adam can make sure that you're the only Slayer in
Sunnydale, if you get my meaning.  No being second best, no having to
live in the other Slayer's shadow.  I know how much that gets to you,
Faith.  I know how much it drives you nuts.&#34;</p>

<p>My jaw hurt from me clenching my teeth so hard.  &#34;I can't.  I won't.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why, because you think you love her?&#34; He laughed.  &#34;I remember you,
Faith, and your revolving bedroom door.  She's just another fuck to
you, and that's all you are to her.  Experienced.  I bet you give a
good ride.&#34;  My fists were clenched now, but I still didn't make a
move.  Not with Adam standing there a few feet away.  &#34;It will never
last between you two, anyway.  How long do you think she'll be able to
put up with your shit, huh?&#34;</p>

<p>I just shook my head.  Somewhere in my head, that voice tried to tell
me that he was right.  How many times have I tried to push Buffy away?
Did I really think our hormones would be enough to hold us together,
with all the shit that has gone down between us?</p>

<p>&#34;Listen, you don't have to do anything.  That's the beauty of it.
Just bring her here, and we'll do the rest.  You'll be the Slayer
here, just like you always wanted.  The only Slayer.  The Chosen One.
Sunnydale will be your town, like it was supposed to be.&#34;</p>

<p>I didn't answer, I just closed my eyes.  I heard movement, and I hoped
it was Adam coming up to rip my head from my shoulders.  Put me out of
my fucking misery.  But when I opened my eyes, both of them were gone.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Are you feeling ok?&#34; B asked me, all concerned about my welfare.
Damn her.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I'm fine.&#34;  I picked at my fries, not really hungry.  I met up
with B at her dorm, and she wanted to go to this burger place for
dinner, so here we were.</p>

<p>She frowned.  &#34;You don't look ok.  Did anything happen this
afternoon?&#34;</p>

<p>I looked at her, and gave her a half-smile.  &#34;Nah, everything's cool.
I'm just not hungry.  I ate a big lunch.&#34;</p>

<p>She seemed to accept that; either that, or she decided it would be
best to change the subject.  &#34;Will was pretty freaked out about her
date tonight.&#34;  She giggled.  &#34;She and Tara look really cute
together.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe we could all go out to dinner together some night? I'd like to
get to know Tara better.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>She cocked an eyebrow at me.  &#34;Are you sure you're ok? Do you even
want to go on patrol tonight?&#34;</p>

<p>I stiffened a little, and looked at her.  &#34;Yeah.  I'm fine.  Five by
five.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Okay.&#34;  She grabbed her wallet, and left a twenty on the table.
&#34;Ready when you are.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>We walked through the graveyard, the same one where I met Vinnie
earlier.  I suggested it.</p>

<p>Okay, Faith.  Time to find out what you're made of.</p>

<p>&#34;You hear something?&#34; B asked, looking around at the shadows.</p>

<p>&#34;Not sure,&#34; I said, feeling that prickling on the back of my neck,
like there's a knife headed right for it.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, well.  If it isn't the Slayer twins.&#34;  I recognized Vinnie's
voice immediately.  I should, by now.  I looked around and three
vampires came out of the shadows, surrounding us.</p>

<p>I measured up all three vamps.  Besides Vinnie, there was some biker
looking creep who dressed like a Hell's Angel wannabe, and a young
punk who looked like he used to be on Sunnydale High's football team.
Geez, they must really be scraping the bottom of vamp material since
the boss left.</p>

<p>&#34;Wow, that's really clever,&#34; Buffy said, sarcastically.  &#34;But if you
wanted to fight us, you should have brought a few more guys.  We won't
even break a sweat with you.&#34;</p>

<p>Vinnie just laughed.  &#34;We don't need more guys.  Not when we have
these.&#34;  He and the other two vampires pulled guns from their jackets,
and leveled them at us.</p>

<p>Guns, hell.  Those suckers were fuckin' hand cannons.  At least,
that's what it looked like from the barrel end.</p>

<p>Vinnie smiled, all smug and shit.  &#34;I don't care what Slayer powers
you have, they won't stop a bullet.&#34;</p>

<p>He was right.  I don't know why more vamps didn't think of it, to be
honest.</p>

<p>&#34;I have to thank you, Faith.  You did a great job bringing the Slayer
here.  Guess you decided to be on the winning side after all.&#34;</p>

<p>Oh, shit.</p>

<p>Buffy just looked at me...hurt, confused, betrayed...I don't have
enough words to describe that look.  She stared at me, like she
couldn't believe he was telling the truth, but also couldn't believe
he was lying.</p>

<p>It almost killed me.  That's when I _knew_.</p>

<p>&#34;Guess again, asshole,&#34; I snarled, and launched myself at the nearest
vamp, Mr. Hell's Angel.  I led with my stake, which buried itself in
his chest, turning him into dust in a second.</p>

<p>I have to give B credit; as soon as I moved, she ducked out of the way
and shots fired wildly over her head.  She aimed a leg sweep at
Vinnie, and brought him to the turf.</p>

<p>I saw that Jock was trying to get a bead on her, and I was on him
fast.  I buried my stake in his back, grabbing his gun away from him
with my right hand.  He dissolved into dust, and I aimed the gun in
Vinnie's direction.</p>

<p>&#34;I think you'll want to drop that,&#34; he growled, holding Buffy in front
of him, gun pressed against her temple.  &#34;One shot won't kill me, but
it will most certainly kill _her_.&#34;</p>

<p>I glared at him, gun leveled at his face.</p>

<p>&#34;You disappoint me.  I thought for sure you knew which side to bet on
this time.  Guess you're just a big loser after all.&#34;  He dug the gun
hard into the side of B's face.  &#34;I said, drop it.&#34;</p>

<p>I looked into B's eyes; she was scared, but it was more for me than
for her.  I looked away; I had to, or else I'd never be able to do
this.  &#34;Okay,&#34; I said, and ejected the clip.  Time seemed to slow down
in that weird way it does, right when you know you're gonna die; the
clip tumbled down, end over end, until it landed on the grass with a
dull thud.</p>

<p>Vinnie smiled at me, and pointed his gun right at my chest.  &#34;Like I
said.  Just a big, fuckin' loser.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not the one with a bullet in my brain,&#34; I said, and fired the one
round I knew was still in the chamber.</p>

<p>Vinnie's head snapped back, and I heard the sharp crack of another gun
firing.  I saw Buffy whip a stake out of her sleeve, dodge around
Vinnie and bury it in his back.  A second later, he was dust.</p>

<p>What a relief, I thought, and then I wondered why my legs weren't
holding me up anymore.  I dropped down to the turf, noticing with a
hell of a shock that my chest was covered with blood.  B ran over to
me, holding me.  I knew she was saying something, but I couldn't
figure out what.  My ears didn't seem to be working, or some shit like
that.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you, Buffy,&#34; I heard myself say, my words echoing inside my
head.  I wanted her to know it, to know that I didn't betray her.  Not
really.</p>

<p>I got tired all of a sudden.  After that, I don't remember a whole
hell of a lot.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>You didn't think the story ended here, did you? Fuck, I got knifed,
fell two stories down to the bed of a junk truck and pulled out of it.
Eventually.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was someone holding my hand.  Buffy,
definitely.  I got to know those hands pretty well.  She was talking
to someone, from the sounds of it.</p>

<p>&#34;No way.  I am not leaving her.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, be reasonable.  You have to go home, get some sleep.&#34;  That
voice, I knew I heard it before...</p>

<p>&#34;Forget it, mom.&#34;  Oh yeah.  &#34;I need to be here when she wakes up.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know you feel responsible for her, honey, but you have to think of
yourself now.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You don't get it.  She saved my life, mom, and she almost died doing
it.  Besides, I wouldn't leave her now anyway.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know she's a friend of yours, but--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We're more than friends, mom.&#34;  Oh, this was getting good.</p>

<p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We love each other.  We're in love with each other.  If you can't
deal with that right now, then it's probably best you leave.  I'm not
leaving her.&#34;</p>

<p>There was a long silence then.  I can only imagine the looks.  &#34;We'll
talk about this later.&#34;  A couple seconds later, I heard the door
close.</p>

<p>Now, if only I could get my voice to work.  &#34;Buffy?&#34; It was hoarse,
but not bad.</p>

<p>I heard a stifled sob, and I felt her hand brush across my face.  I
opened my eyes, just to have to shut them a second later from the
brightness.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm here, Faith.  I'm here...&#34;  I felt her lips on the back of my
hand, and I tried opening my eyes again.  It worked a little better
this time, and it only took me a few seconds to focus on Buffy.</p>

<p>God, she looked like hell.  Dark circles under her eyes, tear stained
cheeks, the whole bit.  She was wearing the same clothes, too, which
had big dried bloodstains all over.  Crap.  Those were actually my
clothes that she had borrowed.  Oh well.</p>

<p>&#34;How many months was I out this time?&#34; I asked, my voice still shaky.</p>

<p>B smiled at me, her eyes filling up with tears.  &#34;Two days.  They had
you in surgery for about four hours, from the time I brought you in.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How bad is it?&#34;</p>

<p>She licked her lips.  &#34;I don't know if--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Please, B, I want to know.&#34;  I looked at her, hoping my eyes would
tell her what I couldn't.</p>

<p>&#34;The docs said the bullet ricocheted off your ribs and tore through
your lung; it missed your heart by less than an inch.  But they were
able to get all the pieces out, and patched you up pretty good.  With
the amount of blood you lost, they didn't think you'd make it--&#34;  Her
voice broke, and she took a deep breath before continuing.  &#34;I knew
you would, though.  Slayer chicks are just too tough to put down for
long.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Tell me about it,&#34; I said, giving her a weak grin.  &#34;So when can I
get the hell out of here?&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>It wasn't long after that when B left, at my urging, to go tell the
docs that I was awake and see when I could get the fuck out of here.
She also left to go get some rest, a shower, and a clean change of
clothes.  That was at my urging, too.</p>

<p>The doc came in and checked me over; he was a short, pudgy guy who
looked like he hadn't gotten laid in about a year.  He called me &#34;Ms.
Summers&#34; about four times before I actually got that he was talking to
me.  Smooth, Faith.  Better not ever have to go into Witness
Protection.</p>

<p>He seemed really happy at my progress; he was surprised, actually.  I
wasn't.  Of course, I knew that I was a Slayer, and he didn't.  He
said I could be out in two days if I continued to improve and promised
to do some lame-ass breathing exercises, to &#34;extend the capacity of my
damaged lung.&#34;  Yeah, well, in a few days no one, including a doctor,
would be able to tell that I had been shot.</p>

<p>Fuck, I got shot.</p>

<p>I almost died.</p>

<p>Oh well, not like it hadn't happened before.</p>

<p>I was sitting there, flipping channels on the TV trying to find
something decent to watch.  Figures, here I was again watching
lame-ass Daytime TV, and I didn't even have my Playstation.</p>

<p>The door opened and Xander walked into the room, holding a stuffed
bear.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's what I said.  Surprised the hell out of me, too.</p>

<p>&#34;Um, hi,&#34; he said, handing me the bear.  I took it from him, wondering
if it contained anything explosive, he was so nervous giving it to me.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I heard about what happened, and I wanted to stop by... And you know
what they say, 'Say it with a stuffed animal.'&#34;</p>

<p>I raised an eyebrow.  &#34;And what is the stuffed animal trying to say?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Um, it's right there on his little t-shirt,&#34; he pointed, &#34;'Get Well
Soon.'&#34;</p>

<p>I smiled, and set the little guy down on the side of the bed.
&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>

<p>Things got pretty awkward after that; a few minutes passed, and
neither of us said anything.  Eventually, Xander mumbled, &#34;I guess I'd
better get going...&#34;</p>

<p>As he was heading out the door, I said, &#34;Hey, X-man?&#34; He froze, and
turned around to look at me.  &#34;I'm...sorry.  For everything back
then.&#34;</p>

<p>He grinned, that goofy, lop-sided grin he has.  &#34;Better have 'em check
you over for a concussion, Faith...cuz I don't remember any of that.&#34;
He waved goodbye, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Well, shit.  Buffy had some pretty wicked cool friends.  _I_ had some
pretty wicked cool friends.  I liked the sound of that, actually.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, was that Xander?&#34; B came into the room, looking like she had
showered and changed, but...</p>

<p>I made a point of looking at the clock on the wall.  &#34;There is no
freakin' way you actually got some sleep.&#34;</p>

<p>She grinned, a little sheepishly.  &#34;Who needs to sleep when you have
caffeine?&#34; She asked, sitting down next to me.  &#34;Hey, cute bear.&#34;</p>

<p>I decided to let her off the hook, seeing as how I started missing her
about five minutes after she left.  &#34;Yeah, Xander brought it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So that _was_ Xander...how cute!&#34; She picked up the bear and waved
one of its little arms at me.  &#34;Hi there, Faith,&#34; she said in a deep
voice, &#34;and how are you to-day?&#34;</p>

<p>I just looked at her.</p>

<p>&#34;I think someone's a little grumpy, Mr. Bear,&#34; she said, nodding the
bear's head in agreement.</p>

<p>I just kept looking at her.</p>

<p>She grinned, and kept playing with the bear.  &#34;So what did Xander
want?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;He wanted to bring that by.  Things look like they're going to be
five by five.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Great! Glad to know he's finally come to his senses.  Now all we have
to do is worry about telling him about us.&#34;  She licked her lips,
kinda nervous now.  &#34;Faith, I...um...I kinda told my mom about us.&#34;</p>

<p>I nodded.  &#34;I thought that's what I heard, right when I was coming out
of it.  Things...ok between you two?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged; she was pretty sad, it was obvious even to me.  &#34;I
haven't talked to her yet.  She stormed out of here, pretty upset,
just before you woke up.&#34;</p>

<p>God, what a piece of work I was, ruining Buffy and her mom's
relationship.  &#34;I wish I was surprised, I really fucked up any chance
I had of her liking me.  I'm sorry.&#34;</p>

<p>B's eyes got all wide.  &#34;Faith, you don't have to be sorry.  My mom
will come around, she's got to learn that I'm happy, and the choices I
make aren't always going to be the ones she wants me to make.  But too
damn bad, they're my choices.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you.  And if I had my way, I'd spend the rest of my life with
you.&#34;</p>

<p>I stared at her.  &#34;You don't mean that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The hell I don't.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, c'mon B,&#34; I said, looking away to stare at the wall.  &#34;You don't
want--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith, shut up,&#34; she said, leaning over and kissing me.  And I did.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>We sat and watched TV for a little while; B held my hand and wouldn't
let go.  Not like I was trying to get away, or anything.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You never did ask...why I brought us to the graveyard that night.&#34;</p>

<p>She shrugged.  &#34;Is it important?&#34;</p>

<p>I looked at her, confused.  &#34;Isn't it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You saved my life.  That's all I care about.&#34;  She looked at me
steadily the whole time.</p>

<p>I nodded, and didn't say anything for a long time.  Finally, I said,
&#34;I...I kinda need to tell you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she said softly.  She squeezed my hand and waited for me to
start.</p>

<p>The whole time I talked to her, my voice was real quiet.  I did things
I regretted before, hell, I did things I regretted _a lot_.  But now,
it was different.  I felt ashamed.</p>

<p>&#34;That vamp who was talking to us...his name was Vinnie, and he used to
work for the mayor, back when I was...working.  He wanted to talk to
me, said he worked for Adam now, and...and they wanted me to join
them.  He said he knew that I enjoyed being on the winning side.  He
told me Adam was the winning side, that he took you on and you were
scared of him.</p>

<p>&#34;He knew I hated the fact that I was always second best...to you...and
that I should be the only Slayer here.  That Sunnydale should be my
town, and I wouldn't have to be second best to you anymore.  He told
me he and Adam could make it so that...&#34;  God, I couldn't go on.  I
just thought about what would have happened if Vinnie hadn't turned
the gun on me, if instead he had shot--</p>

<p>&#34;Shh, it's ok,&#34; B said to me, smoothing my hair back.  &#34;What
happened?&#34;</p>

<p>I forced myself to take a deep breath.  &#34;I...I had to prove to myself,
to everyone, that I wasn't like that anymore.  When we got to the
graveyard, I didn't know what I was going to do.  But when I saw you
there, with that look in your eyes like I betrayed you -- I knew I'd
do anything to keep you safe.  I'd die to keep you safe.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Faith,&#34; Buffy said softly, still stroking my hair.  &#34;You're not
second best to me.  Some things I do better, but there are a heck of a
lot of things you do better than me too.  The two of us, we're
partners.  Equals.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I don't think
that you're second best, and neither do any of our friends.  And if
some dusted vampire and junk-yard Frankenstein do, then that's their
mistake.  Because they'll learn it the hard way.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, this whole Adam incident has really taught me two things.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's that?&#34; I asked, completely unable to believe my luck.  She was
right, what she was saying felt _right_ to me.  I don't know if it was
wishful thinking or whatever, but I felt like I could believe it.</p>

<p>&#34;First, that I am incredibly lucky that you love me, and that I love
you.&#34;</p>

<p>Shit.  I felt myself blush.  I never blush.</p>

<p>&#34;Second, that Adam is running scared.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I looked at her like she was nuts.  &#34;How do you figure?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because, if we Slayers are so inconsequential to him, why did he
bother having his flunkies try to get you to fight on his side? I'll
tell you why, because when he was making his little plans, he didn't
factor _you_ in.</p>

<p>&#34;One Slayer he figures he may be able to handle.  _Two_ Slayers... and
now he's in a world of hurt.&#34;</p>

<p>I couldn't help grinning at her, and she returned it.  I don't know if
what she was saying was true, but I couldn't argue with her logic.</p>

<p>The Chosen Two.  It meant a lot to me right then.  It meant everything
to me.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The next couple of days went by pretty fast, and with a couple of
exceptions, pretty uneventfully.  The doc was pretty astounded by how
quick I was healing; he prescribed me some painkillers which I never
took.  It doesn't pay to be all fuzzy-headed when you're a sitting
duck.</p>

<p>Along with Xander's stuffed bear, I also got a bunch of flowers from
Giles, and some balloons from Red and Tara.  Looks like things went
pretty well on their date after all.  Just like I predicted, they did
make a very cute couple.</p>

<p>Anyway, like I was saying, there was a big exception to all that dull
and boring-ness.</p>

<p>I finally made B go to class, since she had probably already missed
way too many because of me anyway.  I was sitting up, eating my lime
jello when the door opened, and who should walk in except Buffy's mom.
Ah, shit.  And me without my bulletproof vest.</p>

<p>&#34;Joyce,&#34; I said, nodding at her.  She came in without a word and sat
down right next to my bed.  Way too close for comfort.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy's not here,&#34; I said, knowing that Joyce had probably planned it
that way.</p>

<p>&#34;I know.  I came to talk to you.&#34;</p>

<p>I didn't say anything, but I knew my expression said, &#34;I'm here, so
talk.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll be straight with you, Faith.&#34;  Well, that makes one of us.  &#34;I
think you need help.  I'm willing to make allowances because of the
rough time you've had, but you have some serious problems.  You're bad
for yourself, and you're bad for Buffy, and I don't want you to see
her anymore.  If you're honest with yourself about loving Buffy,
you'll make the decision which is best for her.&#34;</p>

<p>I almost laughed.  After what we just faced, did she really think she
could get between us? &#34;Sorry to be the one to break this to you,
Joyce, but what you want and what you don't want is kinda irrelevant
here.  It's completely up to Buffy to decide what is bad for her, and
to be perfectly honest, you don't know enough about the situation to
make that kind of snap judgement.</p>

<p>&#34;Now, if you want _my_ advice, you'd better just accept what Buffy
decides and hope she chooses to talk to you about it.  Don't think
that you can just come here and guilt me into breaking up with her,
like you did with deadboy.  Because it just ain't gonna happen.&#34;  I
went back to eating my jello, and I heard her get up and leave.</p>

<p>Well, that won't make the inevitable family dinner any easier.  But it
had to be said.  Didn't it?</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>B came back later that afternoon, and helped me spring myself from
that place.  I kinda put off telling her about her mom; I wasn't gonna
lie to her about it, but I figured we should be somewhere a little
more private first.</p>

<p>And I learned that I really needed to practice signing 'Faith
Summers.'</p>

<p>Giles drove us to my place in his crappy little car.  It was an
improvement over his old crappy little car, but only because this one
was a few years newer.</p>

<p>B went around the side to get my spare key off the balcony; one of
these days I suppose I needed to make a couple of spares.  Giles and I
were left waiting on the doorstep.</p>

<p>&#34;Thanks for the flowers,&#34; I said, lifting the vase.  &#34;They're cool.&#34;</p>

<p>He smiled at me.  &#34;I'm glad you like them.&#34;  You could tell he still
wasn't really comfortable, but it was getting better.  And hell, if he
was willing to give it a try, I would too.</p>

<p>B opened the front door and we went inside.  As soon as we did,
though, she started with all the mothering crap.</p>

<p>&#34;Thanks for your help, Giles.  Faith, you need to sit or lay down;
we're following doctors orders on this, I don't want you going all
relapsy.&#34;</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes and laid down on the bed.  I kinda liked the
attention, as long as she didn't totally overdo it.  &#34;Only if you lay
down here with me,&#34; I said, giving her my best smile.</p>

<p>She froze for a second and looked at Giles, who was suddenly very
interested in one of my posters.  He cleared his throat and said,
&#34;Well, I suppose I should leave you two to...recover...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded.  &#34;Yeah, we'll call...later...&#34;  And shut the door behind
him.  She turned to look at me, and I just kept grinning at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Was that really necessary,&#34; she said, in that long-suffering way of
hers.</p>

<p>&#34;Completely.  We've got nothing to hide, B; they'll find out anyway,
and if they see how happy we are they won't second-guess it.&#34;  I
patted the bed next to me.</p>

<p>She walked over and laid down, putting her head on my shoulder.  &#34;I
guess you're right.  I just hope my mom sees it the same way.&#34;</p>

<p>Uh oh.  &#34;I wouldn't bet on it...&#34;</p>

<p>She sat up and looked at me.  &#34;Why? What happened?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Your mom came to see me this morning, after you left,&#34; I sighed.
&#34;She wanted me to stop seeing you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; B swore.  She looked really pissed.  &#34;When is she going to
learn that I'm an adult?&#34; She jumped up and grabbed her jacket.</p>

<p>&#34;Wait a minute,&#34; I interrupted, getting up with a small amount of pain
and walking over to her.  &#34;Far be it from me to keep someone from
going off 'half-cocked.'  I am, after all, the queen of half-cocked.
But do you really want to talk to her right now, now that you're
pissed off?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Guess not,&#34; she said, and dropped her jacket back on the chair.
&#34;Guess I should give it a couple of days, huh?&#34; She pulled me back to
the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Now this is more like it,&#34; I said, climbing on top of her and kissing
her.</p>

<p>I felt her laugh.  &#34;Are you sure we should be doing this?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; I said, pulling off her t-shirt.  &#34;I'll be six feet under
before I stop doing this.&#34;</p>

<p>From the sounds she was making, I'll assume she agreed.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Gotcha,&#34; I said, feinting with a kick, and then at the last minute
dropping into a leg sweep which dumped B right on her butt.  &#34;You
ain't goin' easy on me or anything, are ya?&#34;</p>

<p>B got up, rubbing her tailbone.  &#34;Trust me, I'm not going easy on you.
You're just getting better.  A lot better.&#34;</p>

<p>I grinned to myself, bouncing up and down on the balls of my feet.  B
and I were sparring in my -- our? -- loft; it was nice, and a hell of
a lot less lethal than the last time we fought here.</p>

<p>B was right, though; I was getting better.  I didn't feel that weird,
stretchy feeling in my chest anymore, and my breathing was back to
normal.  Gotta love Slayer healing; less than two days since I got out
of the hospital, and I'm already almost one hundred goddamn percent.</p>

<p>Maybe once I healed up, all those doubts I had about myself and B
would disappear too?</p>

<p>Who the hell was I trying to bullshit.</p>

<p>&#34;Guess we should call it a morning... We have that meeting at Giles'
to go to, and I'd kinda like to shower.  I'd rather not have our
friends smell me before they see me.&#34;  B gave me a quick kiss and went
into the bathroom.</p>

<p>Our friends.  B was saying stuff like that more often.  Our friends,
our place, us, we.  I'd never really been a part of anything before,
unless you count the Watcher's Council, and that was a major
clusterfuck.  But she always included me, I don't even know if she did
it on purpose or not.</p>

<p>When I came back here after getting out of the hospital, we both kinda
agreed it would be better for B to move in here, unofficially at
least.  She wanted to be near me, in case I needed anything, and I
wanted to be near her.  What a laugh -- big, bad Faith didn't even
like sleeping alone anymore.  But can you blame me? When you've got B
sleeping next to you, anything else is a wicked letdown.</p>

<p>What I tried to tell her was, &#34;Buffy, I think things between us are
better than they've ever been.  I love you, and I need you.  I would
be happy beyond words to have you move in here with me.  I know it's
not much, but it would mean a lot to me.&#34;  What I actually said was,
&#34;You know, you should bring over some of your stuff.  That way it
won't be such a pain in the ass if you spend the night over here.&#34;</p>

<p>She got it -- at least, I think she did.  B just smiled at me and
said, &#34;I think that's a great idea.  I'd love to.&#34;  And so she dragged
over a bunch of her clothes and stuff.  Red gave her a little bit of a
hard time, but it wasn't like she was spending a whole bunch of her
nights at the dorm room, either.  The little witch was keeping her
plenty busy.</p>

<p>I listened to the sound of the shower running for a couple of minutes
before it really sunk in, and then I began to wonder what I was doing
out _here_ when she was in _there_.</p>

<p>This is California after all; gotta do what I can to save water.  And
if that means showering together, I guess I'll just have to make that
sacrifice.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Okay, so what do we know about Adam?&#34; Buffy asked, looking around the
room.  The whole Super Friends group was there, sitting around the
G-man's living room:  Willow and Tara together on the couch, just
itching to hold each other's hand, but trying to play it cool in front
of everyone; Giles, all business now that he had something demonic to
focus on; Anya, sitting near Xander and glaring daggers at me; and
Xander, sitting in one of Giles' chairs, uncomfortably aware of Anya
and me in the same room.  Guess he told her what was what, and now
that we were talking again, she was pulling a jealous routine.  </p>

<p>As if she had to worry.  I sighed.  Guess I'd have to straighten that
out, too.</p>

<p>&#34;I've got a list of several of the different demon types from which he
was constructed,&#34; Giles said, holding up a piece of paper.  &#34;He has
been given extraordinary strength, and above-average speed.  He has,
of course, the skewers in his arms from the Polgara demon, but that
seems to be his primary weapon.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Aside from his fists,&#34; I said, rubbing my arm.  Giles nodded at me.</p>

<p>&#34;So he likes to get in close,&#34; B said, pacing around now.  &#34;Problem
is, so do we.  But we can't inflict the same damage on him that he can
on us.&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged.  &#34;Piece of cake, then.&#34;  They all looked at me like crazy,
so I explained.  &#34;I seem to remember hearing about the great Slayer
Buffy Summers, who once pulled out a fuckin' rocket launcher to finish
off some demon or other who couldn't be killed with normal weapons.&#34;</p>

<p>B thought about that for a second.  &#34;Yeah, but unlike the Judge, Adam
knows what a rocket launcher is, and he probably won't stand still for
it.&#34;</p>

<p>Xander spoke up.  &#34;He's got some computer thing in his chest...can't
we use that to attack him?&#34;</p>

<p>Everyone looked at Red now.  &#34;Maybe...but we'd have to give him a disk
and trick him into reading it,&#34; Willow said.  &#34;But I can't write a
virus unless I know a lot more about his hardware and operating
system.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Can you get that information from the Initiative's computers?&#34; Buffy
asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Probably...but the Initiative probably uses C2 security, at a
minimum.&#34;  Red got blank looks from everyone.  &#34;That means their
network is isolated.&#34;  More blank looks.  &#34;It means I can't just break
into their system from outside.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Can Riley help us get in to their system?&#34; Xander asked.</p>

<p>B and I exchanged looks.  &#34;I don't think we can count on Riley's help
with this one,&#34; Buffy said evenly.  &#34;He and the Initiative will be
hunting Adam separately.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Which leaves us with the massive brute force approach,&#34; I said,
jumping off the breakfast bar I was sitting on.  &#34;All we have to do is
make sure Adam doesn't see it.  He can't see it, he can't dodge it,
right?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Only one problem,&#34; Xander said.  &#34;Rocket launchers make a big noise
and a big flash before they make the big boom.  There's no way you'd
be able to keep that a secret.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So we can't use a rocket launcher,&#34; B said, looking around.  &#34;Is
there anything else we can use?&#34;</p>

<p>I grinned at her.  &#34;I think I have an idea.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>After a few more minutes of hashing things out, B and Giles left to go
stock up on a few weapons, and Xander left with his own laundry list
of stuff to rip off from the dupes at the military base.  It was only
so obvious that Anya didn't want to see him go, and she never stopped
glaring daggers at me the whole time.  Well, since Red and Tara were
researching some spell or other, I figured this would be a good time
to get some things straightened out.</p>

<p>I walked over and sat down next to her, watching with some smugness as
she moved over to try to get some of her personal space back.  I knew
all the intimidation tricks, and getting in someone's face is
definitely one of them.</p>

<p>&#34;You got a problem with me?&#34; I asked, wicked casual.</p>

<p>&#34;You're after Xander.&#34;  Direct and to the point.  I could get to like
this girl, if she stops being such a bitch.</p>

<p>&#34;He told you we slept together, didn't he?&#34;</p>

<p>She nodded, still glaring.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, trust me, I'm not looking for a repeat performance.  It was
just a quickie, I'm-horny-you're-horny thing, ok? Didn't mean
anything, and if I knew how B and her friends felt about casual sex,
it wouldn't have happened in the first place.  Got it?&#34;</p>

<p>The chick looked confused.  &#34;How can anyone have sex with Xander, and
not want to have sex with him again?&#34;</p>

<p>Now, see, this is a conversation I like to have; no BS, no beating
around the bush.  &#34;All I can say is that he must have practiced before
boinking you, because when we did it, he was ok, but not great.  I've
had better.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Really? Who?&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged.  &#34;Plenty of people.  I mean, if Xander is ringing all your
bells, that's great, stick with that.  He just doesn't do it for me,
ya know?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Because you have Buffy, right?&#34;</p>

<p>My eyebrows shot up.  Two points for perception.  &#34;Yeah.&#34;  No reason
to deny it.</p>

<p>&#34;You two are orgasm friends?&#34;</p>

<p>That's an interesting way to put it.  &#34;At least.  I...&#34;  Shit, Faith,
you can do this.  &#34;I love Buffy.  I wouldn't do anything to hurt her,
including cheating on her with Xander.  Okay?&#34;</p>

<p>She thought about that for a minute before she nodded.  &#34;Good,&#34; I
said, and glanced up just in time to see two pairs of eyes look down
wicked fast at a book.  I grinned to myself and got up, walking around
behind Red and Tara.  Leaning down, I said, &#34;See anything
interesting?&#34;</p>

<p>Two heads shook.</p>

<p>I just smiled and went over to turn on the TV.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Ohh yeah, baby, it's been too long.&#34;  I ran my hand over the smooth
surface, feeling the lethal tension just waiting to be released.  She
fit in my hand perfectly, like we were made for each other.  Hell, who
knows? We probably were.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith, if you're done having a religious experience with your new
toy...&#34; Buffy said, smiling.</p>

<p>I looked up, tearing my eyes away from the gorgeous, black compound
bow that Giles and Buffy picked up as part of their shopping trip.
&#34;Sure, sorry B.  But the experience I was having wasn't religious.&#34;</p>

<p>That got a grin from B, but Giles cleared his throat.  &#34;Well, we're
all familiar with the plan of attack.  The only question that remains
is, how do we implement it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We have to lure out Adam, right?&#34; Red asked.  &#34;How do we do that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;By giving him something that he wants,&#34; I said.  &#34;Me.&#34;</p>

<p>B shook her head.  &#34;No way.  Besides Faith, if the plan is going to
work you've got to be hiding when Adam comes out.  I'll need to be the
one out there.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;He'll know it's a trick,&#34; Red pointed out.  &#34;He's not stupid.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But he thinks _we_ are...&#34;  I thought for a sec, twirling a broadhead
arrow between my fingers.  &#34;When you're trying to pull a con, the best
thing to do is to feint, let the mark catch you goofing up on a
smaller con, so the big one doesn't get noticed.  It's a great way to
get someone to underestimate you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do I even want to know how you know all this?&#34; B shook her head,
smiling.  &#34;So he's going to assume it's an ambush, _unless_ we give
him another trick to figure out.&#34;</p>

<p>I grinned and nodded.  I was juiced now, all the pieces were clicking
into place.  &#34;You know, B, you'd look good as a brunette.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;She should have been back by now,&#34; I mumbled, pacing the floor.</p>

<p>Red looked up from the book she was reading.  She and Tara were
sitting a little closer together, getting a little more daring with
the whole PDA thing.  &#34;It takes a little while to get to Willy's and
back.  I'm sure she's ok.&#34;</p>

<p>I grunted and kept pacing.  I should have gone with her, but we didn't
want to make it _too_ obvious.  The trick is in making it just obvious
enough.</p>

<p>Seconds later, the door opened, and B walked in.  Goddamn, looking at
her, I could hardly breathe.  She was wearing stuff that I would
normally wear:  boots, tight black leather pants, black tube top and
black denim jacket.  The only difference was that she had a
brown-haired wig covering her hair; a wig which she took off as soon
as she got through the door.</p>

<p>I was gonna keep my cool, but I couldn't help it.  I jumped into her
arms as soon as the door closed, and gave her a nice, long kiss.  </p>

<p>&#34;I should be greeted like this more often,&#34; she whispered to me after
breaking the kiss.</p>

<p>&#34;I missed you,&#34; I told her, huskily.  We heard a small cough, and
looked over to where Red was clearing her throat.  Not that she gave a
rat's ass what we were doing, but she pointed at Giles and Xander,
whose eyebrows had reached their hairlines.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh oh,&#34; Buffy said to me, in a low voice.  &#34;Now we've done it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I couldn't help myself,&#34; I told her.  &#34;In that outfit, you're wicked
sexy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Guess I should hang onto it, then.&#34;  She grinned at me, and winked.
Turning to the two guys, she said, &#34;I guess it's kinda obvious that
Faith and I are a little bit more than friends.&#34;</p>

<p>Giles seemed to snap out of the haze he was in.  &#34;Ah, yes.  Well, I'm
sure everything is...good.  Can I get anyone a drink?&#34; And he beat a
hasty exit to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Xander just stared at us.  B frowned, all worried for the guy.  &#34;Are
you ok, Xander? Does this bother you?&#34; I snickered.  I coulda told her
he was ok, considering all the blood left his brain in a rush.</p>

<p>His jaw worked for a minute before any sound came out.  &#34;Two
beautiful, leather-wearing, strong, gorgeous -- did I mention
leather-wearing? -- Slayers french kissing right in front of me.  You
know, I can't tell if it's bothering me or not.  Could you do it
again, so I can make sure?&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged.  &#34;Sure,&#34; I said, and put my arms around B.</p>

<p>B, in turn, almost jumped out of her skin.  &#34;Xander! Faith!&#34; She gave
us both a glare that was completely unconvincing.</p>

<p>I just shrugged again.  &#34;Shit, wouldn't be the first time I let a guy
watch,&#34; I said.  That got a whole hell of a lot of shocked looks from
everyone, Xander included.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, that's enough,&#34; Anya said, dropping the magazine she was reading.
&#34;C'mon Xander, let's go back to your basement.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, that's a good idea, Anya,&#34; Xander said, still in a daze.  &#34;We
need to go and...do stuff.  You know...do stuff.&#34;</p>

<p>Anya looked pleasantly surprised.  &#34;That's the second time today.  I
should let him watch you guys kiss more often,&#34; she said, and dragged
him out of the house.</p>

<p>&#34;So,&#34; I said, casual as all hell.  &#34;How did it go over at Willy's?&#34;</p>

<p>B looked at me, and blinked a couple of times.  &#34;Oh, it went fine; I
found one of Adam's vamp goons, told him I was Faith and that I was
sorry our last meeting went bad.  Told him to let Adam know that I
could deliver him Buffy, and to meet me tomorrow night at the
cemetery.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Great.&#34;  I grinned.  &#34;Did he fall for it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Not really,&#34; B said.  &#34;He kept looking at me, like he recognized me
as Buffy.  But he didn't say anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So Adam will think the trick is an ambush by Buffy?&#34; Tara asked, her
voice so quiet it barely carried to the other side of the room.  Gonna
have to work on loosening that girl up.</p>

<p>I nodded.  &#34;That's the plan.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You know,&#34; Buffy began, facing the group, &#34;no one should feel like
they have to come with us.  This is going to be pretty dangerous, and
if anyone feels like they shouldn't risk their lives, that's cool.&#34;</p>

<p>Red looked at Tara, and the witch girl just slid her hand into Red's.
Guess that was her answer.  Red looked at B and said, &#34;We're with you,
Buffy.  We want to help fight the big, nasty evil.  You'll need our
help.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She's right, Buffy.&#34;  Giles nodded.  &#34;Not helping you is not an
option worth considering.&#34;</p>

<p>B grinned; I smiled, too.  It was nice having friends to watch your
back.  &#34;I love you guys,&#34; B said, getting all misty-eyed and shit.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah hell,&#34; I said, blinking.  &#34;If this is turning into the caring
circle, I'm going home.&#34;</p>

<p>Red and Tara got up from the couch.  &#34;Guess we'd better go back,
before it gets late.  Big day tomorrow.&#34;  They said their goodbyes,
and took off.</p>

<p>B looked at me, sliding her arms around my waist.  &#34;Tomorrow's going
to be pretty dangerous, huh?&#34;</p>

<p>I shrugged, holding her close.  &#34;Could be.&#34;</p>

<p>She was going to say something, and stopped to lick her lips; I barely
held back from doing it for her.  &#34;It's not too late; I'd kinda like
for us to visit with my mom.  Try to get things straightened out
before tomorrow.&#34;</p>

<p>Woah.  Didn't see that coming.  &#34;Now, I don't want you to be all
getting your affairs in order here, B.  Cuz you ain't going anywhere
tomorrow, ya know?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know.&#34;  B nodded.  &#34;But I want to get past that.  Go into the fight
tomorrow with a clear head.&#34;</p>

<p>I couldn't argue with that, but I didn't know how much would actually
get resolved.  &#34;Okay, I'm game.&#34;</p>
