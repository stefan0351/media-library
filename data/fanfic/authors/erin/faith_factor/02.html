<p>&#34;So,&#34; Joyce said, breaking the five-minute silence.  It felt more like
five hours, but the clock on the living room wall said differently.  I
was starting to wonder if it was broken.</p>

<p>I kept my mouth shut, and watched the looks that B and her mom were
giving each other.  Every so often Joyce would get that look in her
eyes when she was watching B, that &#34;oh, my poor baby&#34; kinda look.  And
then she'd glance at me, and she was all ice queen again.</p>

<p>&#34;So,&#34; B echoed back.  &#34;I'd kinda like to talk this out, mom.  Maybe
get things resolved.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What makes you think they can be resolved?&#34; Joyce asked, her voice
quiet. </p>

<p>I winced; damn, this wasn't going to be pretty.</p>

<p>It seemed to hurt B, too.  &#34;What is this about? Is this about Faith,
or the fact that I'm dating a girl?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Both,&#34; Joyce shot back immediately.  &#34;I could probably get used to
the lesbian thing--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not a lesbian, mom--&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;--god knows I've had to get used to some pretty strange things in
your life.  But why _her_?&#34; Okay, I'm still here, in the room.  &#34;Why
someone who has done so much to hurt you, to hurt all of us?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;First of all, dating a girl is _nothing_ compared to some of the
weirdness that has come in and out of my life since we moved here,
since before we moved here,&#34; Buffy said, her voice calm.  Yeah, her
voice was calm, but I saw the way she was gripping the arms of that
chair.  Any minute she was going to turn them into toothpicks.
&#34;Second, I trust Faith.  I trust her with my life.&#34;</p>

<p>Joyce glanced at me.  &#34;Do you trust her with all our lives?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes.&#34;  B didn't even hesitate.  I loved her for it.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, that makes one of us,&#34; Joyce said.</p>

<p>&#34;Two of us, actually.&#34;  I couldn't help it, I just had to say
_something_.</p>

<p>&#34;Since I've been told the decision really isn't up to me,&#34; Joyce gave
me a pointed look again, &#34;I don't know what else there is to talk
about.&#34;</p>

<p>She was pulling out the trump card, now.  Motherly guilt.  Bet she
still thought she could get between us, if she showed B all that
strict disapproval.</p>

<p>B was quiet for a long time, long enough for my heart to stop beating,
I think.  Finally, she looked up.  &#34;I'm sorry you feel that way, mom.&#34;
She got up, letting go of the chair's arms, which had developed small
cracks.  B held out her hand to me, and I reached out and took it.  I
was no dummy.</p>

<p>Then we left.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I guess I won; I mean, B chose me over her mom, right? So why didn't
winning jazz me like it usually did? </p>

<p>It only took one look at B to answer that question.</p>

<p>&#34;She'll come around,&#34; I said, with a hell of a lot more confidence
than I felt.  &#34;She loves you.  She won't stay mad at you for long.&#34;
Me, on the other hand, she could stay mad at.  But I didn't say that
out loud.</p>

<p>She didn't look convinced.  &#34;My mom has a long memory.  You don't know
how long it took her to trust me again after I ran away.&#34;</p>

<p>Actually, I did.  I was around during that time.  Out loud, though, I
said, &#34;She's still your mom.  She stuck with you through the Slayer
thing, even though it had to be pretty wicked strange for her.  She
just needs time to deal.&#34;</p>

<p>B gave me a weird look.  &#34;How come you're defending her, after what
she said about you?&#34;</p>

<p>I didn't even look at her, I just kept walking.  &#34;Personally, I don't
give a rat's ass about her.  But she's important to you.  That's all
that counts.&#34;</p>

<p>I felt Buffy's hand on my arm, and I stopped and looked at her.  She
didn't say anything, she just pulled me in for a hug.  Her skin was
cold, way colder than the night air; that confrontation with her mom
really cost her.</p>

<p>&#34;I guess I need to put this behind me, and focus on tomorrow,&#34; she
said, her voice muffled against my leather jacket.  I nodded, my cheek
rubbing against the top of her head.  The smell surrounded me, some
expensive conditioner she used that was like twenty bucks a bottle or
some shit.  It was my second favorite smell in the world.</p>

<p>&#34;C'mon,&#34; I said, breaking the hug but leaving an arm wrapped around
her waist.  &#34;Big day tomorrow.  We'd better go home and get some
sleep.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Home,&#34; she whispered, so quiet I wasn't even sure if she said it,
slayer hearing and all.  Louder, she said, &#34;That sounds like a good
idea.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ah, the life of a Slayer.  Twelve hours ago I was laying in a nice,
comfortable bed, the most beautiful woman in the world wrapped around
me, sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>Now, I'm hiding under some really thorny bushes, flat against the
cold, wet dirt.  I looked out across the moonlit graveyard and saw B
standing there out in the open by the graves, dressed like me with the
brown-haired wig and everything.</p>

<p>It was showtime.</p>

<p>We'd been in our positions for about an hour already, since a little
before sunset.  I glanced up into the tree which hung above the bushes
I was hiding in, and I could just barely see where I'd left my bow.
Damn California trees, way too bare for me to be hiding up there in
the branches; I'd have been spotted in a flat second.  That's why I
was down here, laying face first in the dirt and mud.  Scratched, and
cold, and grimy.</p>

<p>I was pissed.</p>

<p>I had just felt some mud ooze into the waistband of my black jeans --
good call avoiding the leather pants tonight -- and I was starting to
get seriously icked out when I spotted a tall figure stride out of the
shadows, heading right for Buffy.</p>

<p>Adam.</p>

<p>He looked as bad-ass as ever, walking up until he stood about 10 feet
away from B.  He cocked his head to the side, and his voice carried
easily to where I was laying.</p>

<p>&#34;You are not Faith.&#34;  He didn't sound at all surprised.</p>

<p>B stripped off the brown wig and sneered at him.  &#34;Figure that out on
your own, huh? Good boy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It was an obvious ruse,&#34; Adam replied in that same dull, monotone
voice of his.  &#34;You tried to use my interest in Faith to bring me here
alone, so you could fight me.  I had hoped that you would be smarter.
More of a challenge.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What makes you think I won't be?&#34; Buffy asked, still putting on the
arrogant act.  At least, I think it was an act.</p>

<p>&#34;Because you will not live through the night,&#34; he said.  And right
when he said this, the ground started to erupt all around her.  Dirt
and grass went flyin' into the air, as these huge, goddamn holes
appeared everywhere.  I was so freakin' surprised I couldn't move, and
I could see that B was pretty surprised too.</p>

<p>Vampires.  Goddamn vampires were bursting out of every grave in the
area; must've been about thirty of 'em.  They surrounded B almost
instantly, and I could see Adam standing there, totally calm and shit,
just waiting for her to die.</p>

<p>A pretty wicked smart little trap, I'll give him that.</p>

<p>Too bad for him we had our own wicked smart little trap, too.</p>

<p>&#34;Now, guys!&#34; B yelled, and she shoulder-rolled behind a gravestone,
coming up with a fierce double-headed axe that she had stashed there
out of sight.  It only took a couple of seconds after B gave the
signal before the troops put phase one into action.</p>

<p>Holy water balloons.  Ohhhh yeah.</p>

<p>I saw Giles, Red, Xander, Tara, and even Anya jump up from the various
bushes and shit they were hiding behind.  They chucked those goddamn
water balloons for everything they were worth, plastering vamp after
vamp with holy water.  I could feel a wicked grin break out on my face
when I saw at least a dozen vamps smoking and sizzling like bacon.</p>

<p>Man, the looks on their faces -- not to mention Adam's face -- were
fucking priceless.</p>

<p>Didn't take long for the vamps to dive for cover, and they totally
forgot about B.  They were too busy going after Giles and the rest.  I
heard Xander yell something, and the last water balloons were chucked,
and the holy water-filled super soakers came out.  I could feel my
hands clenching into fists; I was just itching to get into the action,
but I knew if I moved at the wrong time, the plan was blown.  Still,
this lying-in-wait thing was really just _not_ my speed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, B was circling Adam carefully, trying to get him into
position while the gang cleaned up on the vamps.  The vamps were
trying to close, trying to get near enough to take some of 'em out,
but those damn super soakers have a pretty wicked range.  Red and Tara
clasped hands, and I could hear 'em chanting something just seconds
before a beam of what looked like sunlight streaked out of their
palms, setting any vamps it touched on fire.  Giles picked up a
crossbow and was busy dusting any vamps that the holy water and
sunlight didn't burn to death.  I would've helped, but I had my own
shit to do.</p>

<p>B was having a hell of a time getting Adam into position; he didn't
look too happy that we were polishing off his army, and he was taking
swipes at B any chance he got.  He had his skewer thing out, and B was
dodging like crazy.  He lunged at her, and B threw herself to the
side.  It caught her jacket and tore it; if she'd been a half-second
later, it would have torn _her_.  I almost leapt out of the bushes
right then and there, headed for his throat.  I didn't, though.
Adam's last lunge had taken him further into the clearing, and now he
had his back to me.  There was only one thing I could do that would
make a difference, and it was time for me to be doing it.  It was time
for me to make like a sniper.</p>

<p>I scrambled back out from under the bushes and stood up, my heart
hammering hard inside my chest.  I was ready to climb the tree and get
to my bow, but something stopped me.  Someone, actually.</p>

<p>Riley &#34;Beefstick&#34; Finn.</p>

<p>He stood a few feet away, dressed in those commando fatigues that he
and all of his repressed homosexual buddies loved so much.  But what
stopped me wasn't really Beefstick, it was the blaster rifle he was
holding, pointed right at me.</p>

<p>Damn, I was really starting to hate people who point guns at me.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith,&#34; he hissed at me.  Don't ask me how, it's not like 'Faith' has
any s'es or anything.  He managed, though.  &#34;Looks like the odds are a
little more even now, doesn't it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Look,&#34; I said.  &#34;I do not have time for this.  You want to throw
down, we can do it whenever you want.  But for now, get the fuck outta
here.&#34;  I took a step toward the tree, and he raised his rifle.</p>

<p>&#34;You think I'm letting you go? Forget it.  I'm taking you down.  Now.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Shit! Would you listen to me?&#34; I said, getting really kinda nervous
now.  &#34;B is out there facing down Adam.  Now if I don't do what I
gotta do, she's in a world of hurt.  Do you get that?&#34;</p>

<p>Nothing.  He still just kept looking at me like I was slime, his Clark
Kent jaw set like it was wired shut.  Hell, I knew he hated me, but
this was really not the time or the place.  I could hear a couple of
blows being exchanged out there, where B and Adam were.  We were
running out of time; she couldn't dodge forever, and nothing she could
possibly do was going to put the hurt on him.</p>

<p>I heard a faint crackling sound coming from Corn-fed's headset.  After
a second, he said, &#34;This is Alpha 4, this sector is clear.  Repeat,
this sector is clear.  No sign of hostiles.&#34;  What the hell? </p>

<p>He just sneered at me, and said, &#34;Guess I should take you out first.
And then I can go out there, and Buffy and I can take down Adam.  Like
a team.  Like we were supposed to be, before _you_ came along.&#34;  </p>

<p>Yeah, like Beefstick would last even a _second_ against Adam.
Stubborn fucking son of a bitch, why couldn't he just leave us the
hell alone?</p>

<p>Just then I heard B's voice, strained, almost frightened.  &#34;Faith!
Come on...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Screw this,&#34; I said, and jumped up to grab the lowest branch on the
tree.  Of course, right after I did, Beefstick lit me up.</p>

<p>All that goddamn electricity hit me, and it felt like every nerve in
my body was on fire, all at once.  I totally lost my grip on the tree
branch, and dimly felt my body hit the ground.  Soldier-boy was really
gonna pay for that.</p>

<p>He tried to blast me again, but I rolled and got to my feet.  Sorta.
I mean, my knees weren't holding me up too well, and my legs felt all
tingly like they were asleep.  I just hoped it wore off quick, because
I knew he wasn't gonna give me a breather.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay, fun's over,&#34; I snarled, and half jumped, half lunged at the
asshole, doubling him over with a quick punch to the solar plexus.  I
grabbed the rifle out of his hand and hit him upside the head with it,
feeling his cheekbone crunch beautifully.</p>

<p>&#34;Not so tough without your toy now, are ya!&#34; I yelled, and kicked at
his face.  He dodged, my kick just glancing off his arm.  He turned
and swung at me with some black, baton-looking thing that he pulled
out of nowhere.  I ducked, but I still felt it smack into the side of
my head.  I blinked, and felt blood -- my blood, goddammit! --
trickling down my face.</p>

<p>He struck at me again, and I grabbed his arm, stopping it dead in
mid-swing.  I bent his arm back, wrenching away his baton.  I punched
it into his stomach, doubling him over, and brought it down across the
back of his shoulders.  He dropped to the ground like a pole-axed ox.</p>

<p>&#34;Stay down!&#34; I snarled, and ran to the tree, jumping up to catch a
branch.  B was counting on me to be up there, and there was no way I
was gonna let her down.</p>

<p>I pulled myself up about halfway when I felt a couple of big hands
wrap themselves around my boot, pulling me out of the tree.  I
scrambled to hold on to the tree branch, but the goddamn mud was
everywhere now, keeping me from getting a good grip.  I hit the ground
hard, and felt Beefstick's hands wrap around my throat.</p>

<p>His weight pressed down on me hard, but I'd fought off bigger than
him.  I smacked him hard, right in the broken cheek, and he rolled off
me, making nice little retching sounds.  I yelled something -- hell, I
don't even know what it was -- and picked him up by his commando vest,
throwing him as hard as I could.  He flew for a good ten, fifteen feet
before he touched ground, and that was only because a tree trunk got
in the way.  He smacked right into it, and I heard a crunching sound
which was probably a rib or two.</p>

<p>I took a step toward him, and he scrambled back, groaning from the
pain.  He threw me a look that would have killed me on the spot, if
that were possible; blood ran down his face, and I could see one of
his eyes swelling shut pretty nicely.  </p>

<p>&#34;Bitch,&#34; he mumbled, and stumbled into a run.  I _so_ wished I could
go after him, but I had taken way too long on him already, and the
thought of B out there alone with Adam scared the hell out of me.</p>

<p>I dropped the blaster, and scrambled up the tree lightning fast,
grabbing my bow.  I had a really sweet view of the clearing where B
and Adam were fighting, and I could see that she was definitely
getting the worst of it.</p>

<p>She was trying to hold him at bay by swinging the axe, but it was just
way too slow.  Every so often he'd close and land a punch on her and
she'd go flying, hitting dirt and stone with bone-crushing force.
Every time she got up, she got up a little slower, too.  She had
avoided his skewer-thingy for the most part; she had blood running
down her arm from what looked like a pretty wicked puncture, but at
least it was only her arm.  For the moment, anyway.</p>

<p>Okay, time to even those odds.</p>

<p>I grabbed one of the special arrows that Xander made for me, and
pushed the button on the timer to activate the ten-second delay.</p>

<p>I nocked the arrow, drew, and held it there, fully knowing that I'd be
dead if I held it just a little too long.  I had to wait, I had to get
the best shot possible, because I was only getting one chance with
this.  And if I fucked it up, B was dead.  And there was no way in
hell I was gonna let that happen.</p>

<p>Buffy swung the axe at him, and Adam grabbed it, ripping the axe out
of Buffy's hands and throwing it to the side.  It threw her
off-balance, and Adam pulled his left arm back to use his skewer.
Never gonna be a better time.</p>

<p>I let the arrow fly, and it buried itself deep into his lower back.  A
lot lower than I was aiming for, but the modified arrow flew like
shit.  Adam stopped his thrust, like he was surprised that someone had
shot him.  He turned to look at me, all puzzled and shit; B saw the
arrow sticking out of his back and she took that moment to dive over
some headstones.</p>

<p>The arrow in Adam's back exploded, mainly due to the half pound of
plastique Xander had packed into the aluminum shaft.  The shockwave
damn near knocked me out of the tree, and I almost fell out again a
second later when one of Adam's arms crashed through the branches next
to me.  Luckily, Adam wasn't attached to it.</p>

<p>I poked my head out, looking out over the remains of Adam and several
nearby headstones which had been pounded flat.  Dropping down to the
ground, I walked out into the clearing pretty damn carefully.  My ears
were still ringing a little bit from the explosion.</p>

<p>Adam was laying face-up on the ground, and all that was left was half
his torso, one arm, and his head.  His legs were laying a few feet
away, and several feet away, respectively.  </p>

<p>B poked her head up from behind the gravestone where she took cover,
and she walked over to pick up her axe.  Adam tried to reach for her
when she walked up, but it was a pretty fuckin' weak attempt.  B just
looked at him grimly, and clutched up on that axe of hers.  She swung
and brought the axe down right on his arm, taking it off the body with
one clean slice.  Her next shot was for his neck.</p>

<p>I walked up behind her and put my hands on her shoulders, kinda
letting her know it was me before I wrapped my arms around her and
held her against me.  Doesn't pay to startle a Slayer, I know that as
well as anyone.  I felt her relax, and she dropped the axe.</p>

<p>&#34;'Bout time you showed up,&#34; she said with a little smile, leaning back
into me.  &#34;I was starting to get a little worried about you.&#34;  She was
shaking a little, and I tightened my grip, holding her close.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, well, there was a distraction.  I'll tell ya about it later.&#34;
I kinda nuzzled her neck and inhaled deeply.  She smelled like sweat,
and a little bit of dirt, but mostly she smelled like Buffy.
Definitely my favorite smell in the world.</p>

<p>We were alive.</p>

<p>G-man and the crew walked up right then; Red and Tara were kinda
leaning on each other, and Xander was limping, one arm thrown across
Anya's shoulders for balance.  Bet he tried to go hand-to-hand at some
point and almost got his butt kicked.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, it would appear that the danger has been neutralized,&#34; G-man
said in that wicked obvious way of his.</p>

<p>&#34;For now, but he's still got his power source,&#34; B replied.  &#34;Unless
someone knows how to dispose of uranium?&#34; She looked around, but no
one seemed like they knew, and they were too tired for smart-ass
remarks.  &#34;Ok, then, we've just got to take the pieces that are left,
and scatter them.&#34;</p>

<p>I walked over and grabbed one certain piece by the hair, lifting it
up.  Pretty gruesome looking, actually; he still had this wide-eyed,
puzzled look on his face.  Betcha didn't think it would turn out this
way, did ya, you cyber-demon asshole.  &#34;So we all take a part and meet
back at G-man's?&#34; I asked.  I already knew exactly what I was going to
do with _this_ one.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I crouched there for a minute, just watching.  Straw-blond hair fell
down across his forehead, giving him a kind of tousled, little-boy
look; he was pretty cute.  If you ignored the huge bandage covering
half his face, that is.</p>

<p>Broken cheekbones are nasty.  An injury like that you have to be
careful about; could ruin a person's looks if it doesn't set right.</p>

<p>It hadn't taken me very long to figure out which room belonged to
Beefstick, and even less time than that to jimmy the window open.  No
obvious alarms, so it was all good.  They had him so high on
painkillers that he never heard me.</p>

<p>I eyed him with appreciation, noting his smooth chest and hard
muscles.  But that view was ruined too, by the large bandage they used
to wrap his ribs.</p>

<p>I wonder how he had explained it to them.  Did he say, &#34;Oh, I know I
told you guys it was all clear, but then I decided to jump this
chick&#34;? Or maybe he told them he ran into a door by accident.  A door
which then jumped up and pounded the crap out of him.  Maybe he just
went with the classic, 'I fell down the stairs.'</p>

<p>Bastard.  I could kill him in a flat second.  Just snap his neck.  Or
maybe suffocate him; that wouldn't leave any marks.  Buffy'd never
know, no one would know.  And he'd be off our backs, for good.</p>

<p>At times like this, I always remember those cool &#34;Choose Your Own
Adventure&#34; books they had when I was a kid.  You know, where they
would give you a story and then ask you to choose what you did next,
like &#34;Do you talk to the dragon?&#34; or &#34;Do you attack the dragon?&#34;</p>

<p>So guess which one I always chose?</p>

<p>Thing was, whenever I did that it almost always meant a quick and
painful end to the story.  And this story was just getting to the
point where it really meant a whole hell of a lot to me.</p>

<p>So I just shook my head, and climbed out the window.  I hope Beefstick
appreciated how close to death he came just now; but no, he'd never
know, cuz he was just laying there, doped up and sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>Of course, he'll be a damned sight less peaceful when he rolls over in
the morning and sees Adam's severed head in bed with him.  I chuckled;
I'd give anything to be able to see that.  But no, places to go and
all that.</p>

<p>You didn't think I was going to let him go without even a warning, did
you?</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>So I ran my &#34;errand&#34;, and hustled it back over to G-man's to meet with
the others.  They were all there, and in various stages of exhaustion,
but B still jumped up to meet me when I came in.</p>

<p>&#34;What took you so long?&#34; She asked, kissing me soundly.  I noticed
Xander trying to do the &#34;look but don't look&#34; thing, so I kept the
kiss going for a couple extra minutes.  Hell, he had been a real
trooper tonight, he deserved a thrill.</p>

<p>Finally, I broke for air.  &#34;Sorry, took me longer than I thought to
get rid of that thing.  We got anything to drink around here?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, we kicked demon butt.  I say it's Miller time,&#34; Xander said,
looking around.</p>

<p>Giles answered from the living room where he was slumped in a chair.
&#34;There's soda in the refrigerator.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hardly the drink of choice for brave warriors returning from battle,&#34;
Xander complained.  Giles just shot him a look.  &#34;Soda it is.&#34;  He
grabbed a few sodas from the fridge and began passing them out.</p>

<p>&#34;How awful...&#34; Red's voice was pretty quiet; she and the little witch
were sacked out on the couch looking pretty frayed and worn.  They
looked like B and I did when we'd gone fifteen rounds with the undead;
those spells must really be a bitch to cast.</p>

<p>&#34;Ok, I'm not a big fan of Tab either, but it's all Mr.
I-Don't-Know-Anything-About-American-Culture has in the fridge,&#34;
Xander answered, looking at the can with disgust.</p>

<p>&#34;No, I mean, yeah that's gross, but I was talking about Adam.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What about him, Will?&#34; B asked.  I sat down on one of the kitchen
stools and pulled her back against me, wrapping my hands around her
waist.  I didn't really feel like being away from her, right then.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, according to the information that Riley got to us, um, before,&#34;
she looked over at us in apology, &#34;Adam's brain wasn't really in his
head.  It was a processor chip in his chest, between his power source
and spinal cord.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oooookay,&#34; B said.  She wasn't alone; I didn't know what the hell Red
was getting at, either.</p>

<p>&#34;What did happen to Adam's chest?&#34; I asked B quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;Will and Tara sent it to a pocket dimension, or something,&#34; B said,
shrugging.</p>

<p>&#34;So...?&#34; Xander asked.</p>

<p>&#34;So, we've just gone all 'Johnny Got His Gun' with him,&#34; Red answered
sadly.</p>

<p>Blank stares all 'round.</p>

<p>&#34;I think you need to reach a little lower for the pop culture
references there, Will,&#34; Xander said, all puzzled and shit.</p>

<p>&#34;I think what Willow is saying is that Adam remains fully awake and
aware, yet he cannot move, cannot feel, cannot hear, or see, or speak.
He is trapped,&#34; the G-man explained.</p>

<p>&#34;Wow.  Heavy,&#34; I said.  Everyone nodded, serious looks on their faces.
&#34;So, who's up for microwave popcorn?&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ah, the life of a Slayer.  Twelve hours ago I was lying in dirt and
mud under a bunch of thorny bushes, not knowing whether we would
survive the night.</p>

<p>Now, I'm lying in bed, all warm and clean and comfortable, with the
most beautiful woman in the world wrapped around me.</p>

<p>What did B call it? Oh yeah, &#34;symmetry.&#34;</p>

<p>Adam was dead.  With any luck, Beefstick and the Commando Boys would
be laying off.  So that just left the normal assortment of demons and
vampires who were almost constantly trying to kill us.</p>

<p>And it left me.  Who was, at one time, Buffy's biggest enemy of all.</p>

<p>I looked down at B's face, so peaceful.  Open.  Honest.  We had been
through so much together the past couple of weeks.  I'll have to hand
it to her, she took all my doubts, all my self-loathing and self-pity,
and she weathered all of it.  She not only put up with it, she tried
to reassure me as much as possible.</p>

<p>Just how did a fucked-up, murdering bitch like me get to have someone
like her in my life?</p>

<p>&#34;Whatcha thinkin'?&#34; She murmured, looking up at me sleepily.  I didn't
realize until right then that I had been staring at her the whole
time.</p>

<p>Lie to her, I thought.  Lie to her and tell her, 'I was just thinking
you're the most gorgeous, sexy woman on Earth.'</p>

<p>&#34;He told me my days were numbered.&#34;</p>

<p>B blinked, and drew herself up, looking at me all alarmed and shit.
&#34;What? Who?&#34;</p>

<p>I never changed expression, I just kept talking in that same dull
voice.  &#34;The Mayor.  Had a videotape delivered to me not long after I
woke up.  Told me that once he was dead, there was nothing for me
anymore.  That I wouldn't have a place in the world...not without
him.&#34;</p>

<p>B took one of my hands in hers, and kissed it.  &#34;I hope you know
that's not true.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I thought it was true at the time.  Now...&#34; I shrugged.  &#34;I keep
waiting for the other shoe to drop, B.  It's hard.&#34;</p>

<p>She didn't jump to reassure me or anything, she just looked at me,
kinda sad.  &#34;What can I do to make you believe it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know.  Maybe nothing.  Maybe I'll get it eventually, maybe
it'll get through this thick skull of mine.  I just don't know.&#34;</p>

<p>We sat there for a while, B looking at me, and me just staring off
across the room.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you love me?&#34;</p>

<p>What? The question came totally out of left field, catching me off
guard.  &#34;Yeah, I mean, of course I love you.&#34;  What was she thinking,
wasn't I telling her that enough? Isn't she happy? God, if I've done
something to make her unhappy...</p>

<p>&#34;You know I love you,&#34; she said.  &#34;And you know that when you wanted
to pull away from me, I didn't let you go.  Don't you trust me?&#34;</p>

<p>I looked away, avoiding her eyes.  &#34;Of course I trust you.  It's me I
don't trust.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know why not.  You saved my life.  Twice.&#34;</p>

<p>I grimaced.  &#34;It's not that kind of trust.  I always make the wrong
choices, especially when it comes to relationships.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Why do you think that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Just look at my track record--&#34;</p>

<p>B cut me off.  &#34;Your track record tells me one thing:  you are looking
for someone to love you, to understand you.  Completely and totally.
And most everyone has fallen short.  Family, boyfriends, girlfriends,
the Mayor...most of them loved you, or pretended to love you, for what
you could give them.&#34;</p>

<p>She sat up, looking me straight in the eyes, no bullshit, no pretense.
&#34;I love you for who you _are_.  Completely and totally.  I know the
best about you, and I know the worst about you, too.  I've seen it
all, first hand.</p>

<p>&#34;I understand you, Faith.  And you understand me.  You're the first
person who really has.&#34;  She leaned over and kissed me tenderly.  I
never really knew what that felt like before I was with B.  She broke
the kiss and went into the bathroom, cutting off any argument I was
about to make.</p>

<p>I leaned back and stared up at the ceiling.  She was right.  Damn, she
had a way of looking straight into my soul.  I used to look there,
too, before I started hating the thing that was looking back at me.
Maybe it was time for me to start looking again, and trusting what I
found.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>B took off shortly after that to catch a couple of study sessions on
campus.  She was gonna invite Red and Tara to dinner with us, too; I
know she wanted to get to know Tara better now that she was Red's
girl.</p>

<p>So I kissed her goodbye, already having decided on what I was going to
be doing this afternoon.</p>

<p>The door chimed a little when I walked into the gallery.  I wandered
around for a couple of minutes, just looking at all the crap they had
up on the walls, and how much cash people were willing to drop for it.</p>

<p>&#34;Hello, may I help--&#34; Joyce cut herself off when she rounded the
corner and saw me standing here.  &#34;Faith.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Mrs. Summers.&#34;  I looked around a little and said, &#34;There somewhere
around here we can talk?&#34;</p>

<p>She nodded, and led me back to an office.  &#34;What do you want to talk
about?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy.  Look Jo--&#34; I corrected myself immediately.  &#34;Mrs. Summers.
It's tearing her up that you won't accept us.  I know a lot of stuff
has happened in the past, and I'm sorry for it.  All of it.  But I'm
not sorry, I won't _ever_ be sorry that I'm in love with your
daughter.&#34;</p>

<p>I saw her wince a little at that.  Tough; she had to get used to
hearing it.  &#34;It's not that I really mind that Buffy is involved with
a girl...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know, it's me,&#34; I said, finishing her thought.  &#34;If it's any
consolation, I didn't believe it either.  And I tried not to accept
it, I really tried my best to run away from her.  But she didn't let
me.  She knew everything I'd done, everything I was, and she still
didn't let me.&#34;</p>

<p>I looked Joyce in the eyes, hoping that she saw something there that
would let her believe me.  &#34;I understand if you don't trust me; shit,
most of the time _I_ don't trust me.  But I have learned to trust your
daughter.  I hope you can too.&#34;</p>

<p>She stood there, quiet.  Thinking.  That was good enough for me.</p>

<p>I turned around with a mumbled, &#34;See ya,&#34; and walked out of the
gallery.</p>

<p>I didn't do it for Joyce, and I sure as hell didn't do it for me.  I
did it for Buffy.  I just hope I got through to her, cuz I hate having
these little heart-to-hearts.  I know B's mom can be stubborn, but
goddammit, so can I.</p>

<p>I sighed.  Sometimes I missed the old days.  Things were so much
simpler when I just beat the crap out of people if they didn't give me
what I wanted.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Wow, that was _so_ amazing!&#34; Red exclaimed.  &#34;You're really good at
this!&#34;</p>

<p>Don't get your hopes up, it wasn't even half as much fun as it
sounded.  Miniature Golf.  It was boring as shit when the boss used to
drag me out here, and even with the current company it really hadn't
gotten all that much more exciting.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, nice shot Tara,&#34; Buffy said, smiling at the shy witch.</p>

<p>B had asked Red and Tara out to dinner with us, and somehow that
morphed into a night of hamburgers -- except Tara, who was a
vegetarian; go fig --, frosty chocolate milkshakes, and miniature
golf.  How I had gotten sucked into this Pleasantville nightmare, I
had no idea.</p>

<p>Thing was, I knew exactly how.  I looked over at Buffy, who was lining
up to take a shot, her face scrunched up in that look she always got
when she was in deep concentration mode.  I caught Red giving me this
knowing glance, and I realized that I was grinning like a total goof
for everyone to see.  I shot Red a pretty fierce glare and she just
smiled, and pretended she was looking somewhere else.</p>

<p>This 'love' crap was really ruining my rep.</p>

<p>&#34;We need something to make this more interesting,&#34; I said smoothly.
At B's arched eyebrow, I continued.  &#34;Like a wager.&#34;</p>

<p>Red's eyebrows came together worriedly.  &#34;Um, what kind of wager?&#34;</p>

<p>I leaned against my putter as casually as possible, and said, &#34;Like if
I get a hole in one on this next shot, I get to pick the next activity
for the evening.&#34;</p>

<p>B and Red exchanged glances, but Tara just shrugged.  &#34;S-sure, I mean,
that sounds fine.&#34;  Red gave Tara a kind of worried look, like she
didn't trust Tara to be able to handle whatever I had planned.
Couldn't say I blamed her.</p>

<p>B was a little harder to convince, though.  &#34;What do we get if you
miss?&#34;</p>

<p>I gave her a winning smile.  &#34;If I miss, you get to drag me anywhere
you want tonight.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;We're already doing that,&#34; B shot back with a grin.</p>

<p>&#34;_And_, I won't bitch about it,&#34; I finished.</p>

<p>&#34;Done,&#34; B replied almost instantly.</p>

<p>&#34;Good.&#34;  I swaggered, yeah swaggered, up to the tee and dropped my
ball.  I lined up and took a couple practice swings, even going so far
as to sight down my putter to see if the shaft curved.  Out of the
corner of my eye, I saw B roll her eyes and I smiled.</p>

<p>What they all didn't know, what they couldn't know, was that I always
got a hole-in-one here.  The Boss was a lot of things -- psychotic,
devil-worshipping, power-hungry, homicidal -- but the man knew his
miniature golf.</p>

<p>I took my shot, and seconds later three pairs of eyes turned toward me
in surprise.  I blew on my putter like it was a smoking gun.</p>

<p>&#34;I believe that's game,&#34; I said, grinning widely.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; Red asked, all worried and shit.  You'd almost
think she didn't trust my noble intentions.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't worry, it's only a club,&#34; I answered.  &#34;Just some music, some
dancing, some hangin' out...stuff like that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.  Like the Bronze?&#34; Red asked hopefully.</p>

<p>I flashed her a grin.  &#34;Something like that.&#34;</p>

<p>Didn't look like I reassured her much; she still kept picking at the
sleeve of her jacket.  I had made Red, B, and Tara stop by the dorms
to change into something a little more rave-appropriate.  But even
with the new outfits, Red and Tara still had that air of wholesomeness
that a real predator could spot a mile away.  You just couldn't cover
up that kind of thing with black Docs and eyeshadow.</p>

<p>A couple blocks from the club the two of them shot each other alarmed
glances at the fact that you could feel the bass of the music in the
sidewalk.  A block or so from the club, and they caught their first
glimpse of it:  the unassuming steel door, the scraggly, tattooed
bouncer, the goths and hardcore ravers stumbling in and out.</p>

<p>Their eyes wide, they stared up at the big piece of spray-painted
steel over the door which read, &#34;The Succubus.&#34;</p>

<p>B leaned close and whispered to me, &#34;Are you sure this is a good
idea?&#34;</p>

<p>I flashed her a wicked grin.  &#34;This is sure to get those two loosened
up.  It worked on you, didn't it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Good point,&#34; she mumbled.</p>

<p>I tossed a bill at the doorman, herding everyone inside the lion's
den.</p>

<p>Red and Tara immediately wigged, their eyes nearly popping out of
their heads from the sight of the dancers and various other people in
the club.  I don't know if it was because of all the leather, or the
fact that they had never seen so many nipple piercings in one place
before.</p>

<p>The Succubus was just about the same as usual.  Hell, a place like
this was never really different, it just rotated people and music
every so often, like a full blood change.  Dirty halogens lighting up
the dance floor, dark shadows everywhere else; music which pounded the
air, leaking from the club at the seams; and people who had a tendency
to wear their fetishes for everyone to see.  Kinda like me.</p>

<p>&#34;C'mon,&#34; I said, steering them toward a table on the edge of the dance
floor.  They stumbled over and sat down; Red couldn't stop staring at
everyone, and Tara couldn't stop blushing.  I swear, if that girl
pulled into herself any more, she'd implode.</p>

<p>I grabbed B by the elbow and leaned in close so she could hear me
above the music.  &#34;I'm going to grab some drinks, see if you can keep
Red's girl from having a heart attack, k?&#34;</p>

<p>She smiled and sat next to Tara, using that wanna-be Homecoming Queen
charm to start a conversation.  Or try to, anyway, considering some
Marilyn Manson remix was blasting through the speakers at a volume
level roughly equivalent to a jet engine at full throttle.</p>

<p>I got the drinks from the bar, and when I came back I noticed that B
had done a bang-up job; she had actually gotten the two witches to
start smiling a little.  I set down the drinks and dropped into the
chair next to B, draping my arm across the back of her seat.  The
Wiccan Two drank up, either not really noticing the added taste of JD
to the Coke, or not caring.</p>

<p>The music switched to a remix of Rob Zombie's &#34;Living Dead Girl&#34;, and
I jumped to my feet.  &#34;I love this song!&#34; I said, looking around the
table.  &#34;Who wants to dance?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Dance?&#34; Red squeaked.  &#34;You mean dance, dance-in-public dance? Of
course you mean dance-in-public dance, I mean, there's no place around
here to dance-in-private dance, at least not that I've seen, but...&#34;</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes and went over to stand behind Tara's chair.  Leaning
down close, I said in her ear, &#34;You want to dance, don't you?
C'mon...&#34;  I got her out to the dance floor without any trouble, but
it wasn't because she wanted to dance, it was more because she was
almost paralyzed with nervousness.</p>

<p>I started moving to the beat, but the blonde witch just kinda stood
there, head bowed and her hair covering her face.  Apparently more
drastic measures were needed, so I got up right behind her and put my
hands on her hips.  She stiffened, ready to bolt as soon as she could
figure out where to run.  &#34;Relax,&#34; I said in her ear, guiding her with
my hands.  &#34;Just loosen up and have fun.&#34;</p>

<p>I don't know if my words had an effect or if it was the alcohol, but
she started swaying under my touch, and after a minute or so she was
moving without any prompting from me whatsoever.  She even tossed her
hair back, and I could see a small smile forming.  I glanced over at
Red who had such a look of raw _need_ on her face that it would have
almost put my best to shame.  She had it bad for the little Wiccan,
and at that point she didn't care who knew it.</p>

<p>I pointed an index finger at her and gave her a 'come here' gesture.
She came over to us and I slid out of the way so Red could take my
place behind her blonde witch.  I turned around -- and came
face-to-face with B, who slid her arms around my waist and began to
dance.</p>

<p>There was a little bit of a rocky start at the beginning, but this
evening was turning out damn near perfect.  Kind of like the whole
big, crazy thing that was my life lately.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>B and I were just standing there on the beach, looking out over the
ocean.  The moon was real low against the horizon, it made the water
look like there was a road cutting across it that anyone could walk
on...as long as they wanted it bad enough.</p>

<p>By the time we left the club, the two witches had been three sheets,
not to mention all over each other, so we had walked 'em home.  Rather
than head back to my apartment right away, though, we had decided to
take a walk on the beach; work out some of the alcohol before we hit
the sack.  B really didn't want a repeat performance of her last
hangover.</p>

<p>&#34;I had a really great time tonight,&#34; B said, leaning back against me.
My arms were wrapped around her waist, to shield her from the cold
wind.  Whoever came up with the term &#34;ocean breezes&#34; obviously never
came to Sunnydale beach at 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, me too.&#34;  </p>

<p>B chuckled.  &#34;I think Willow and Tara had a pretty good time, too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I knew we could loosen them up,&#34; I said, feeling a smug grin coming
on.  </p>

<p>&#34;You know what I love most about you?&#34; She asked.</p>

<p>I raised an eyebrow.  &#34;What's that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The way you walk into a room and change everyone's lives,&#34; B replied,
smiling.  &#34;No one's ever prepared for it, but it happens anyway.
Kinda like a...&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Natural disaster?&#34; I supplied helpfully.</p>

<p>She smirked at me.  &#34;I was going to say 'force of nature'.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And is this a good force of nature, or bad force of nature?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Good, of course.  Usually it happens to people whose lives really
need shaking up.  Like mine.&#34;  </p>

<p>I smiled slightly.  &#34;Well, I did such a bang-up job with my own life,
why not turn my talent to someone else's?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You did a great job with your life.  I wouldn't have you any other
way,&#34; she said quietly.</p>

<p>I bowed my head, resting my cheek against the top of her head.  We
stood there for a few minutes, just listening to the surf.</p>

<p>&#34;Faith?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Would you marry me?&#34;</p>

<p>I froze, like I always do whenever I'm scared of fucking things up.
Sure, my body wasn't moving, but my heart and mind both were racing
around a hundred miles a minute.  &#34;I don't think that's legal,&#34; I
chuckled weakly.</p>

<p>B turned around, her arms slipping around my waist.  She looked up at
me, her eyes dark in the moonlight.  &#34;Yeah, you're probably right.&#34;
She sounded disappointed, and it hurt.  &#34;But would you want to?&#34;</p>

<p>I reached up to stroke her face; my hand was trembling just a little
bit, and I think she noticed.  &#34;Buffy.  You know I'm not that good
with the whole caring and sharing thing,&#34; I said, smiling
sarcastically at myself.  &#34;But I do love you.  I've loved you since
the minute I saw you, since before I saw you, even.  Hell, probably
ever since I heard the stories about a chick who had such a pair on
her that she pulled out a rocket launcher to waste some demon twice
her size.</p>

<p>&#34;You saved me.  And I don't mean 'saved my life', cuz we've done that
plenty of times for each other.  I mean you saved _me_.  My soul.
Shit, if it weren't for you, I'd probably be dead or in jail by now.&#34;
I took her hands in mine and kissed them; as someone who up until
recently fought and fucked with pretty wild abandon, it was the most
gentle thing I've ever done.</p>

<p>I bared my soul to her, and I never meant anything as seriously as I
did right then.  &#34;B, we are forever.  As far as I'm concerned, there
is no place I'd rather be, and no one I'd rather be with.  And not in
a till-death-do-you-part way either.  Because after I'm gone, hell
won't be able to hold me.  I will fight to be by your side no matter
where I am, and no one, _no one_ is going to keep me away.  I love
you, Buffy Summers.&#34;</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears and she buried her face in my jacket,
holding me tightly.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you, Faith Summers.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith Summers.  Now that's a love-hate relationship for the
ages.  Not everyone can say they've stabbed their girlfriend in the
gut and put her into a coma, or stole her body and took it on a
joyride, or tried to kill each other time after time and still had it
come out a happy ending.  Cinder-fuckin'-ella this was not.</p>

<p>Yeah, we'd had a pretty turbulent past, you could say.  It was amazing
to think that we were together at all, and a goddamn miracle that the
two of us could stay together for months, much less years.</p>

<p>But that's a whole other story, isn't it?</p>

<p>Don't make any mistake about it, there are more stories.  When it
comes down to it, nothing and no one could stand against the Chosen
Two.  Because what I told her that night was absolutely true.</p>

<p>We are forever.</p>
