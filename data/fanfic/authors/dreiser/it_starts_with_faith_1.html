<!-- It Starts With Faith \ Prologue -->

<p>There are many diverging realities where someone's role and
personality can change according to the events in their life. These
realities effect how the world exists and how we exist in the world.</p>

<p>In some realities the girl known as Faith was the third slayer to
be called.</p>

<p>In some realities Faith arrived in Sunnydale by order of the
Watchers Council to help the first slayer, Buffy Summers, in her battle
against evil.</p>

<p>In some realities Faith and Buffy became lovers only to have
their bond eroded by the reappearance of Angel.</p>

<p>In some realities Faith turned on Buffy and worked for the
Mayor to help bring about the Ascension.</p>

<p>In some realities Faith realized her mistake and helped Buffy
prevent the Ascension only to die in the end.</p>

<p>In some realities Buffy mourned the loss of her lover and
slowly pieced her life together then went on.</p>

<p>But in some realities none of this happened. In some realities it
wasn't Buffy who was the first slayer to be called.</p>

<p>In some realities it was Faith who was the first.</p>

<p>This is the story of just such a reality.</p>
