<p>Brooke threw open the door to see Mary Cherry and Nicole on the
doorstep, their best sympathetic expressions in place.  They'd
obviously practiced them on the way over as Mary Cherry's looked like
it had come straight out of a bad TV soap opera.  The expressions
almost slipped when they witnessed the state of Brooke.  She was
dressed in old grey sweatpants and a faded sweatshirt.  She had no
make up on and her hair was tied back in a loose ponytail.  She'd
patently been crying.  </p>

<p>"Oh God, thanks for coming you guys." </p>

<p>"Brookie, honey, did you really think we'd leave you all alone in
your time of need?"  Nicole swept into the house with Mary Cherry at
her heels.</p>

<p>"Yes Brooke, fear not, your guardian angels have arrahved, and we've
brought supplahs!"  Mary Cherry grinned and held up two bags, one
obviously contained alcohol as was evidenced by the clinking
emanating from it.  The other was more of a mystery.</p>

<p>"I just...I can't believe she's gone…I mean we were so great and now…
it's just so…"</p>

<p>Brooke's voice caved in and she started sobbing afresh.  Nicole
gestured to Mary Cherry to close the door and then moved to embrace
Brooke.  She pulled the taller girl to her and patted her on the back
in an attempt to console her.  She looked at Mary Cherry over
Brooke's shoulder and rolled her eyes.  This was going to be more
difficult than she'd thought.  Mary Cherry headed off to the kitchen
to mix up some Margaritas, calories be damned – they were talking
lesbian relationship traumas here!</p>

<p>"OK, B…tell you what, let's get the drinks sorted out and then you
can tell us your woes.  Then we can all sit and have a good old
fashioned bitch-fest about Spam."</p>

<p>"I don't want to bitch about her…I just want her back."</p>

<p>Brooke looked so sad and pathetic that Nicole's heart almost melted…
almost.  </p>

<p>Mostly she just wanted to find Sam McPherson and inflict some serious
pain on her.  Firstly for corrupting her best friend and turning her
into a lesbian.  And secondly for seemingly breaking the poor girl's
heart. </p>

<p>Yep, Spam had better watch her back.</p>

<p>"No, see Brookie, the point of a post break-up girl's night is so
that you can totally trash the useless bastard…or in this case bitch,
who made you feel this way so that you can get them out of your
system and move on…."</p>

<p>Brooke was shaking her head vehemently and she interrupted Nicole
before she could get any further.</p>

<p>"Wait a second…who said anything about break-up?  We didn't break
up.  We had an argument.  It wasn't like…I mean, we're still…oh God
do you think she wants to break up with me?"</p>

<p>"I thought you said that you told her you never wanted to see her
ugly face again?"  Nicole was mightily confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah…I did…but I didn't mean it, I just said it…she knew I didn't
mean it, we live together for God's sake, how could I possibly avoid
seeing her face…I wish I hadn't used the word ugly though…I mean, if
there's one word that doesn't apply to Sam it's ugly right?"</p>

<p>"Right, she's a regular stunner B," Nicole tried to pacify Brooke
while ushering her into the living room and into a chair.  She really
couldn't deal with any more tears just at the moment.</p>

<p>"Ok girls, the drinks are here!" Mary Cherry appeared from the
kitchen with a pitcher and three glasses on a tray.  </p>

<p>"My lord, ah feel just lahk those gals in that movie, Coyote Ugly, ah
may have to start pourin' water all over mahself and mimin' to Leanne
Rimes songs."</p>

<p>She smiled happily to herself as she poured the drinks.  Brooke and
Nicole just shook their heads, sometimes it was just better to let
Mary Cherry say things and not try to over analyse them.  </p>

<p>Once everyone had a drink and was seated Nicole turned the
conversation back to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>"Alright.  Brookie, take your time and tell us again what happened…
and hun, try to keep the waterworks in check OK we only have a
limited supply of Kleenex."  Nicole's sensitive side wasn't quite
shining through.
Brooke took a deep breath and a long drink of her cocktail.</p>

<p>"Right…well, I can't ever remember how it started…no actually that's
not true, it started because I found rice krispies in my bed…now I
don't eat dry cereal in bed…Sam does…"  Brooke's eyes misted over as
this suddenly sounded like the cutest thing in the whole world.  "…
she likes to keep a box at the side of the bed all the time, she
keeps one by my bed too so that when…"</p>

<p>"OK B, we get the picture."  Nicole wanted the juicy details of the
fight, not some fuzzy tale about Sam's nocturnal eating habits.  "So
what happened next?"</p>

<p>"Next?  Right, ummm, well I kind of shouted at her `cause the
krispies were making me itchy…and then she said something about me
blunting her razor when I shave my legs, so I said that she'd better
quit leaving dirty underwear all over my room for me to put in the
laundry hamper, so she told me to…"</p>

<p>"Right right, so what I'm hearing here is that you had a run through
of all the little things that annoy you about each other?"</p>

<p>"I guess…"</p>

<p>"Ah hope you had more things that annoy you about her than she did
about you…cuz it's never good ta leave them thinkin' they've got the
upper hand."  Mary Cherry added helpfully.</p>

<p>"Uh, I think we were about even." said Brooke, trying to remember.</p>

<p>"So how did you get to the point where she stormed out?" Nicole hoped
this bit was more interesting than the rest of the so-
called `argument'.</p>

<p>"I have no idea…one minute we were listing out faults, the next thing
I knew we were calling each other names and that's when I made the
ugly crack."</p>

<p>Brooke dropped her head into her hands.  Nicole looked at Mary Cherry
and nodded.  Mary Cherry clapped her hands together and lunged for
the other bag she'd brought in.</p>

<p>"Well Brookie, in honour of your first Lesbeeyan break-up…"</p>

<p>"It's not a brea…"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever hun, we decided that a reverse girl's
naght was called for…usually after a break up a gal wants to swear
off menfolk for the rest of her natural lahf.  But you probably want
to swear back onto them, raght?"  Mary Cherry grinned widely and
expectantly at Brooke.</p>

<p>"I already told you, I don't want to break up with her."</p>

<p>"OK Brookie, but why don't we take advantage of this little hiatus in
your sapphic lifestyle to remind you of how the other half live.  Who
knows?  You might even come to your senses again."  Nicole clapped
her hands together twice.  "Mary Cherry, show her what we got."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry assumed the role of game-show hostess type person with
relish.</p>

<p>"Tonaght for your viewin' pleasure Ms McQueen, we have carefully
selected only the movies with the most hunkalicious male leads."  She
proceeded to bring out tapes one by one with a flourish as she
announced the titles and the stars.  "First off we have an oldie, but
still a goodie: Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire…what's wrong Brooke?"
Brooke's bottom lip was trembling.</p>

<p>"It's just…for our one month anniversary Sam did the `you complete
me' speech for me in a restaurant and…"</p>

<p>"Movin' on." said Mary Cherry as she tossed the tape over her
shoulder.  "Now we have one of mah personal favourites, the panty
moistenin' Ben Aff-leck in Armageddon…what is it this tahm sweet-
cakes?"</p>

<p>"Nothing…well, Sammy and I went to see that movie in the afternoon
back when we were still sneaking around and things got…sort of heated
and we were asked never to return to that particular theatre."
Brooke looked dangerously near tears again so Nicole intervened.</p>

<p>"And what else do we have Mary Cherry?" her voice had taken on a
desperate quality.</p>

<p>"Well, last but by no means least we have…wait a minute, this isn't
raght…they've given us the wrong movie." She held up the box in
confusion.  </p>

<p>"Are there any hunky men in somethin' called `Broadcast News'?"</p>

<p>"Oh God!  That's Sam's favourite movie."</p>

<p>Brooke's tears made a comeback and she downed her second margarita,
dropped her head to the arm of the chair and sobbed.   Nicole grabbed
the bag from Mary Cherry and glared at her.  Mary Cherry just
shrugged and sat down, sipping her drink daintily like a refined
southern lady should.</p>

<p>"OK, I think it's time to break out the big guns."  She reached in
and pulled out some magazines.  "OK B, which will we do first,
Playgirl or Stud?  My vote goes to Stud because this guy is seriously
packing."</p>

<p>She held up the centrefold.  Mary Cherry was immediately by her side
to get a better look.  They tilted their heads and sighed
simultaneously at the perfect specimen of man in all his naked glory
emblazoned on the page.  Nicole turned to get Brooke's verdict and
found that she wasn't even looking in the right direction. She
appeared to have her nose stuck in the sweatshirt she was wearing and
was inhaling deeply.</p>

<p>"Uh, Brooke, that's not Spam's sweatshirt is it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, she wore it yesterday to work out in…I took it out of the
laundry basket."</p>

<p>Nicole almost threw up then and there at the thought of her best
friend being reduced to sniffing Spam McBitchson's day old work out
clothes.  She closed the magazine, eliciting a whine of despair from
Mary Cherry.</p>

<p>"OK, this obviously isn't working…but before we go any further, I'm
gonna need an awful lot more to drink if I have to sit in the same
room as Spam's sweaty laundry.  Mary Cherry bring in the tequila and
shot glasses."</p>

<p>As Mary Cherry trotted off to the kitchen Nicole eyed Brooke sadly.
This was gonna be a long night.  And the outcome she had hoped for
(i.e.  eradicating any trace of Spam from Brooke's mind) was looking
less and less likely.</p>

<hr size=1 width=75% color=black>

<p>Lily and Carmen watched as Sam paced angrily back and forward.  They
were at Carmen's house having an emergency summit to hear what Sam
had to say regarding the unexpected turn of events in her
relationship.  Lily, ever practical, had brought chocolate and ice-
cream to help them get through the night.  A great deal of both had
already been consumed and Sam didn't look ready for stopping any time
soon.</p>

<p>"I mean, she actually told me that I hog the covers in bed…can you
believe that?  I so do not hog anything.  And it's not like I talk in
my sleep like she does, I can't tell you the amount of times I've
been woken up by Brooke babbling incoherently in my ear…although,
sometimes she says the sweetest things…and she's so adorable to watch
when she's sleeping…but that's not the point here is it?"  Sam
stopped pacing and looked at Carmen and Lily.</p>

<p>"What was my point again?"</p>

<p>"You were telling us that you were in the right and she was in the
wrong." said Lily, wearily.</p>

<p>"Totally.  God I so wish I hadn't walked out…I wish I'd stayed and
held my ground.  Now I so look like the weak one who ran away from
the argument.</p>

<p>But she said she never wanted to look at my ugly face again…and that
wasjust uncalled for."</p>

<p>"Sam, there's no way she meant that.  Come on, it's so obvious to
everyone in the world that Brooke adores you and worships you like a
goddess…she doesn't think you're ugly.  I don't think you should
wreck a great relationship over something that was said in the heat
of, what sounds like, a very silly and childish argument."</p>

<p>Sam looked at Carmen quickly.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about wrecking the relationship.  I didn't say
anything about the relationship being over.  Why, do you think that
provoking this argument was her way of telling me she wants to end
it?  Oh God, I never thought of that…we've never really argued before
and this just came out of the blue…I bet that's it…I bet she wanted
to finish with me and this was her way of doing it!"</p>

<p>Sam threw herself down onto Carmen's bed and buried her face in the
pillows. </p>

<p>Lily and Carmen watched her helplessly.  They wanted to help but they
were unsure whether to go along the traditional route of making
Brooke out to be a horrible person and telling Sam that she'd be
better off without her, or alternatively, persuading Sam that this
had just been a temporary glitch and to go back and talk things over
with Brooke.   Both were inclined to go with the second option.  They
liked Brooke and since Sam had started going out with her there had
been slightly less animosity between the two groups.
Before either of them could offer their opinion on the matter to Sam
she had started speaking again.</p>

<p>"The thing is that I probably shouldn't have taken the cereal to bed
in the first place…it is annoying to find bits of it in the sheets.
And Rice Krispies are the worst because they're so little that it's
hard not to drop them.  So maybe that was my fault.  But she did
overreact."</p>

<p>Sam stood up again and started pacing.  Carmen was starting to feel
dizzy watching the back and forth movement.  She decided that now was
the time to butt in.</p>

<p>"OK Sam, it sounds like you both said some stuff you didn't mean.
The question is are you gonna stay here and walk up and down like a
crazy person all night or are you gonna go back over there and sort
the whole sorry mess out and get back to being the most vomit-
inducingly sweet couple at Kennedy High?"</p>

<p>"I can't go back…on the way over here I passed Mary Cherry and Nicole
driving in the direction of my house.  And I swear to God I think
Mary Cherry tried to swerve into me.  Luckily there was a sale in one
of the stores on the other side of the road that caught her eye just
in the nick of time."  Sam sighed.  "I bet they're over there right
now bitching about me to Brooke, trying to turn her against me."  She
leaned against the wall and slid down it until she was sitting on the
floor.  She put her head in her hands.  "I just love her so much."
she said in a small voice."</p>

<p>"We know sweetie." said Lily, coming to sit beside Sam and offering
her a tub of Haagen-Dazs.</p>

<p>She slipped an arm around Sam's shoulders as they tucked into the ice-
cream. </p>

<p>They all sat in silence for a while, contemplating the possible
scenarios at the McQueen residence.  Sam was having visions of Brooke
getting all dressed up for a night on the town, ready to get herself
a new boy/girlfriend.  Carmen was imagining them practising cheers
with the recurring theme of how Sam was a bitch.  And Lily was still
trying to get the picture of a wild-eyed Mary Cherry heading towards
Sam's car out of her head.  She'd always said that girl was unstable.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you call her?" asked Carmen after a moment.  "Then
at least you could clear the air between you and agree to talk more
about the whole thing tomorrow."</p>

<p>Sam thought about this for a moment.  "Wouldn't that be like, saying
that I was in the wrong?"</p>

<p>"I thought we'd just established that you were both in the wrong.
God Sam, tell me you're not gonna let your stupid pride get in the
way again?  Wasn't that what stopped you and Brooke getting together
in the first place?  And plus, I don't think Lily and I could take
much more of you moping around like this, right Lily."</p>

<p>Lily turned to look at Sam.</p>

<p>"Right.  Sorry Sammy but it's just pointless you not being with
Brooke, and it makes everybody's life a misery.  So just call her
already and get it over with, then we can finish off the chocolate
and go to bed, I'm working in the morning."  Sam looked back and
forth between her friends.  She knew they were right, it was just
hard for her to admit when other people were right.  She sighed
heavily and stood up, heading for the phone.  She dialled the number
to her own house and listened to the ringing with a flutter in her
stomach.  After four rings the answering machine picked up and Sam's
stomach dropped into her shoes – she had been right, the bitches had
taken Brooke out on the town.  Expecting to hear Mike's voice on the
other end, it came as quite a shock when a woman with a deep southern
accent started speaking.</p>

<p>"Howdy y'all.  You've reached the McQueen residence.  Nobody can come
to the phone raght now.  Mr McQueen and his live-in lover are on yet
another convenient holiday.  Brookie is goin' through a traumatic
tahm and is incapacitated through alcohol as we speak.  And if you're
lookin' for Sam McPherson she's not here…but if you fahnd her before
Ah do, tell her that she'd better watch out cuz me and Nic are gonna
git her for ruinin' poor Brookie's…what's that hun?  Another shot?
Sure…oh mah Lord, she's not cryin' again is she…"
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.</p>

<p>Sam looked at the receiver in her hand in shock.  Carmen and Lily
feared the worst as Sam had not spoken into the receiver which either
meant that Brooke was out or that she'd answered and hadn't given Sam
a chance to speak before hanging up or screaming at her. </p>

<p>"Uh…was she not home?" Lily asked apprehensively.</p>

<p>"I…I don't know…it was the answering machine…but Mary Cherry had re-
recorded the message."</p>

<p>She shuddered as she remembered the blatant threat of physical
violence aimed at herself.  All of a sudden Sam was spurred into
action.  She moved round the room like a tornado, putting on her
shoes, looking for her car keys, searching for her jacket.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Carmen, watching Sam doing her Tasmanian
Devil impression.</p>

<p>"I have to get over there.  They've been drinking and it sounds like
Brooke is really upset…I have to get to her and apologize."</p>

<p>Lily and Carmen smirked.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"Sorry, it's just the thought of you apologizing is really funny."
said Lily, trying to keep her face straight.</p>

<p>"Will…ummm…will you guys come with me?  It's just that Mary Cherry
said that she and Nicole were going to `git me' for hurting Brooke
and I'm kind of…"</p>

<p>"Scared?"</p>

<p>Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Of course we'll come with you!" said Carmen.  "Do you think we'd let
you walk into that Lion's Den on your own?"</p>

<p>Sam smiled. "Thanks you guys, you've been really great tonight."</p>

<p>"Plus we really want to see you apologize." said Lily.</p>

<p>"Whatever, come on, let's go." Sam hurried out of the room with Lily
and Carmen scampering after her.</p>

<hr size=1 width=75% color=black>

<p>Nicole tipped her head back and poured another fiery shot of tequila
down her throat.  She raised her head and looked over at Brooke,
mercifully passed out in her chair.  She never could hold her
liquor.  She wasn't
sure which was worse: hearing Brooke extolling Spam's virtues, or
listening to her wailing and crying.  The former was quieter so she'd
probably go for that.  She shook her (slightly fuzzy) head in disgust
at what her best friend had been reduced to.  Brooke had always been
so aloof, very much the ice-queen.  In her relationship with Josh she
never allowed herself to be seen as needy or desperate…much less be
caught wearing his smelly old sweatshirts.  Nicole grudgingly
reasoned that this was because the relationship with Josh had been a
big falsehood…which led her to admit that whatever this thing was
with Sam, it was real.  That thought was just sodepressing that she
poured herself another shot.  Mary Cherry held out her glass for a
refill.  She was also recovering from the onslaught of Sam worship
they had been subjected to.  Nicole sighed as she cradled her glass.</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry…as much as I hate to say it, I think we're gonna have to
admit defeat on this one."</p>

<p>"Ah think you're raght Nic, ah mean, if the girl isn't tempted by the
thought of Ben Aff-leck all covered in oil and oozin' sex appeal out
of every last gorgeous pour on his studly body…what was ah sayin'?"
Mary Cherry had lost her train of thought…it had been derailed at
lustville.</p>

<p>"That Brooke really is smitten by Spam."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah…now, ah was all for helpin' her get over this thing…but if
ah hafta listen to one more cutesie little story about how Ms
Samantha has a freckle behind her left earlobe or somethin'…well ah
think ah'm gonna hafta hurt someone…and as much as ah love our
Brookie here, ah think it maght just be her."</p>

<p>"Yep, where did we go wrong Mary Cherry?  One of our own, the most
popular girl in school…a confirmed dungarees wearer.  It's just not
right."</p>

<p>"And it's wrong too."  The alcohol was affecting Mary Cherry slightly
more than it was Nicole.
"So, I think we should give up trying to put Brookie off Spam…it's
getting us nowhere…what we need to do is get to Spam and knock some
sense into her."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry's eyes lit up.  "Are we gonna beat her up?"</p>

<p>"If need be…I just want her to realise how damn lucky she is to have
Brooke…and to make sure that she never, ever leaves her in this state
again…I don't think I could handle another night like this."</p>

<p>Brooke emitted a sound that was a half snore and half cough, Nicole
held a finger to her lips, terrified that Brooke would wake up and
start blubbering on about how sensitive Sam's big toe was or
something equally disgusting.  </p>

<p>Brooke turned over and settled back down, mumbling something that
sounded like `Please Sammy' but it was too muffled to make out
clearly and Nicole prayed to God that Brooke wasn't going to start
having a sex dream right there in front of them…that might just push
her over the edge.  When she was satisfied that Brooke was sound
asleep she allowed herself to breath again.  And that was when she
heard the key turning in the back door. </p>

<p>"And now the fun begins."</p>

<hr size=1 width=75% color=black>

<p>Sam opened the door cautiously.  She couldn't hear anything, but all
the cars had been outside so it was unlikely that they had gone out.
Sam had been relieved at this discovery; so Brooke wasn't out getting
herself someone new.  She motioned for Carmen and Lily to follow her
into the kitchen.  She turned back around and let out a high pitched
shriek as her eyes fell upon Nicole.  She looked less than pleased to
see Sam and her buddies.  Her hands were on her hips and she was
scowling, just for a change.  A movement behind Nicole alerted Sam's
attention and she looked up just in time to see Mary Cherry stagger
past the doorway, having misjudged the distance completely.  After a
few seconds she reappeared and steadied herself on the doorframe,
offering her somewhat unstable support to Nicole.</p>

<p>"Look Satan, I don't know what you've done to Brooke but I didn't
come here to get into a fight with you."
Sam moved to step around Nicole but a very firm grasp on her arm
stopped her progress and pushed her back to her former position.</p>

<p>"What I've done to Brooke?  Hah!" Nicole laughed
humourlessly.  "You're one to talk."  When confronted by Nicole's
smug face Sam automatically went on the offense.</p>

<p>"Look, just shut up and let me talk to Brooke."</p>

<p>"So that you can break her heart some more?  Not a chance.  You and I
are gonna have a little chat and you'll listen to what I've got to
say or I'll get Mary Cherry to do some damage to your face."</p>

<p>Sam glanced at the Southerner who was gradually sliding down the door-
frame. </p>

<p>This threat wasn't really worthy of Nicole, she must be drunk indeed. </p>

<p>Nicole continued, unaware of Mary Cherry finally collapsing to the
floor behind her.</p>

<p>"OK Spam, it's no secret that I don't like you and that finding out
about you and Brookie almost caused me to throw myself off the
nearest bridge.  That is still the case here.  But, I have come to
the realisation that Brooke for some reason likes you…something to do
with your lumim…lunim…really bright smile."</p>

<p>The alcohol finally took its toll on Nicole's speech.</p>

<p>"We came here tonight with the hope that we'd be able to convince
Brookie to forget all about you and move back to being nice and
normal and heterosexual.  That's not quite what happened, despite our
efforts at counseling her…"</p>

<p>"What the hell gives you the authority to give relationship advice to
anybody?" Lily interjected.  "When was the last time that either of
you two was in a meaningful and lasting relationship?  And by lasting
I don't mean that he stays until after the post-coital cigarette."</p>

<p>"Ah heard that Lil' Lily."  Mary Cherry's voice floated up from the
floor.  Nicole was moving towards Lily with a predatory look in her
eye.</p>

<p>"Look twinkie, we're not all confused about our sexuality…some of us
know what we want, and we have chosen not to form emotional
attachments at such a young age, we are enjoying our youth.  And
we're not hedging our bets to increase the likelihood that someone
will, by some miracle, find us attractive."</p>

<p>Nicole's chest was now pressing against Lily's less impressive one.
Sam pushed her back.</p>

<p>"So is that what you wanted to tell me?  That you hate me and you
don't want me going out with your best friend?  Like that's supposed
to be news to me?"</p>

<p>"No Spam, keep up.  What I'm telling you is that if you ever decide
to storm out and leave my Brookie in a state like she was tonight I
will personally see to it that your kneecaps face the wrong way from
what nature intended."</p>

<p>Sam looked down as she felt something touching her legs.  It was Mary
Cherry and she was hugging Sam around her thighs.</p>

<p>"Please Sam, don't ever make us sit through another naght of Brookie
tellin' us about your erogenous zones and where y'all are most
ticklish."  She looked up imploringly at Sam.</p>

<p>"I…uh…she talked about me?"</p>

<p>"Well duh!" said Nicole. "We've had to listen to her detailing every
single date you've been on, what your favourite ice-cream flavours
are in descending order…we drew the line when she started bringing
out the baby pictures."</p>

<p>"So…so she doesn't want to break up with me?"  Sam asked, feeling her
throat constricting.</p>

<p>"Have you been listening?  We tried our best to get her to kick you
to the kerb but she wouldn't.  The last thing she wants to do is
break up with you."  Nicole caught herself just before she smiled
encouragingly at Sam.  That would have been too much.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" asked Sam, suddenly needing to see Brooke more than
anything else in the world.</p>

<p>"She's unconscious through there."</p>

<p>Sam nodded at Nicole, she wasn't going to come right out and say
thanks, so a nod was her concession.  She moved past Nicole after
detaching Mary Cherry from her thighs and sprinted into the living
room.  When she saw Brooke all curled up in the armchair her heart
almost broke.  She was wearing her sweatshirt…which was sweet, if
slightly icky.  She walked over and brushed some errant hairs from
Brooke's brow and placed a gentle kiss there.  Brooke stirred in her
sleep and then opened her eyes.  She blinked, trying to clear her
head and get her eyes to focus.</p>

<p>"Sammy?"</p>

<p>"Yeah baby, I'm here." Sam whispered through a throat thick with
emotion.</p>

<p>"Oh Sammy I'm shhoo shorry `bout today."</p>

<p>The slightly slurred speech just added to Brooke's adorability in
Sam's eyes.</p>

<p>"No I'm sorry, I should never have left like that."</p>

<p>"I was `fraid you wouldn't come back.  Shorry."  Brooke added for
good measure.</p>

<p>"No I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"OK, everybody's friggin sorry.  Just get on with it so we can get to
bed."  </p>

<p>Nicole's dulcet tones interrupted the couple's little world.</p>

<p>Sam smiled at Brooke before leaning in and kissing her softly on the
lips, tasting tequila and salt.  Brooke put her arms around Sam's
neck and hugged her tightly, burying her nose into Sam's neck.  The
assembled crowed uttered a collective `Awwwww'.  Except Nicole of
course.</p>

<p>"They're so cute together aren't they?" asked Carmen.</p>

<p>"Ah must admit that they seem ta be made for each other."</p>

<p>"Yep, for once we agree Mary Cherry." Lily conceded.</p>

<p>"It makes you wonder if there's one special person for everybody…like
a soul-mate….and if you don't find them you're never gonna be truly
happy." </p>

<p>Carmen wondered allowed.</p>

<p>"Carm, I though I told you to stop watching Dawson's Creek?"</p>

<p>However, the four of them pondered this possibility.  Its
implications were slightly depressing as there was always the chance
that one's soul-mate lived in deepest Africa or somewhere equally
unreachable.  The thought that they might spend the rest of their
lives never finding the happiness that Brooke and Sam had already
discovered was not pleasant and took its toll on Carmen.</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, do you have any of that tequila left?"</p>

<p>Mary Cherry handed her the bottle and held up her glass for a shot.
Nicole too joined in with the round, which went to prove that she did
have a heart underneath all that cleavage.</p>

<p>An hour later the room had lost its sombre mood and there was no
evidence of the normal division between the two groups.  Sam was
sitting with Brooke on her lap, they were listing all the things they
were going to do to each other when Brooke was sober to make up for
the argument.  Nicole was styling Carmen's hair to make her look like
Macy Gray, who she assured Carmen was the cutting edge of style.
Sam noticed that there were a couple of people missing from the group.</p>

<p>"Uh, where are Lily and Mary Cherry?" Sam was slightly worried at
what the psychotic teenager was doing to Lily.  Or vice versa.</p>

<p>Just then the thundering opening chords of a song erupted from the
sound system.  Nicole and Brooke looked at each other, thinking
perhaps that they should have taken notice of what Mary Cherry was
saying earlier.  Brooke attempted to stand up and follow Nic who was
already on her way to the kitchen.  Sam saw Brooke struggling with
the demanding task of being upright and decided to help her…plus she
was curious to see what was happening in the kitchen, the look of
horror on Nicole's face was just too intriguing.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the kitchen door Sam totally understood Nicole's
expression.  For there, standing on the counter, using wooden spoons
as microphones, were Mary Cherry and Lily.  They were engaged in some
very suggestive dancing…with each other…and Lily had acquired a pair
of leather trousers from somewhere.  Leather.  Lily.</p>

<p>[You can try to resist<br>
Try to hide from my kiss<br>
But you know, yes you know that you<br>
Can't fight the moonlight]</p>

<p>Mary Cherry picked up a conveniently placed jug of water and poured
its contents over herself and Lily who didn't seem to object at all.
A flash of light caught Sam's attention and she turned to see Carmen
grinning evilly with a camera in her hand.  Well, at least they'd
have proof to embarrass Lily with.  Highly disturbed by the scene
playing out in the kitchen, the sane four returned to the living
room, resuming their activities and trying to ignore the sounds of
ecstasy coming from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hey Sammibear?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Let's never fight…ever again."</p>

<p>"It's a deal."</p>

<p>"Oh and Sam?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh?"</p>

<p>"I think I'm gonna be sick."</p>
