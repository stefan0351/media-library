<p>Sam sat in the stark whiteness of the hospital room.  She looked at  the clock for what felt like the hundredth time to find that the  hands had barely moved at all.  Waiting was difficult at the best of  times.  Waiting for news of someone's condition in a hospital made it  even harder.  Again Sam felt tears well up in her eyes.  Her throat  was raw and sore from crying, she'd cried so much she felt sick.  But  she couldn't stop.  She kept seeing it in her mind.  Brooke running  into the road, the car heading straight for her…not slowing down… speeding up.  She'd cried out in terror, trying to warn Brooke, but  she'd been too late.  Brooke only saw the car a split second before  it hit her.  Too late.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam had heard that accidents can happen so quickly they become a  blur, even to witnesses.  But every detail of the event was crystal  clear in her head.  She could still hear the awful crunch of metal as  Brooke's slight body was hit with such force that it caused the hood  of the car to buckle.  She relived the sensation of utter  helplessness she felt as she watched Brooke be thrown into the air.  The dull thud as she made contact with the unrelenting ground still  rang in Sam's ears.  She remembered her body feeling like lead as she  tried to move towards Brooke.  Her limbs weren't co-operating even as  her mind screamed for them to work.  Time seemed to slow to a crawl  as she approached the prone figure on the dark, cold road.  The dread  in her stomach had only been paralleled on one previous occasion;  when she'd walked into her house on the day her father had died to  find her mother waiting for her.  She had known from the expression  on her face what had happened, but she dreaded hearing the words  spoken aloud.  As she walked towards Brooke's unmoving body that same  feeling pervaded her being.</p>

<p>Upon her arrival at Brooke's side, Sam knelt down and held two  fingers to her neck.  It had seemed so detached, so clinical, but she  had to know.  She had to know if she was alive.  Then she would be  able to react.  But she had to know first.  Her hands were shaking so  badly that it had taken a second for her to locate a pulse.  The  relief that flooded her body when she felt the distinct, steady beat  was visceral.  Her body immediately felt lighter.  But relief was  tempered by the fear caused by the state of Brooke.  A trickle of  blood was running from the side of her mouth and her leg was twisted  into an unnatural position.  Those were Sam's main worries, various  other cuts and bruises were evident but seemed minor.  The fact that  she was unconscious was also of concern.  As she heard shouts and  calls for ambulances, Sam simply lay down on the ground beside  Brooke, being careful not to move her.  She placed her forehead  gently against Brooke's and softly stroked her cheek.  She didn't  know what else to do.  She just knew she wanted Brooke to be  alright.  She wanted everything to be alright.   She needed Brooke to  be alright.</p>

<p>People had started to come out from the interior of the building.   Sam heard Harrison's voice calling out Brooke's name but she ignored  him and continued to stroke Brooke's cheek.  She heard his footsteps  as he ran towards them but paid him no heed.  He was talking to her,  crying and asking questions but she neglected to look at him,  focusing on Brooke's face.  The blood from her mouth was still  flowing, pooling as it reached the ground.  And then a sound cut  through the voices.  The siren of an ambulance.  Sam stayed in her  position on the ground until a paramedic urged her to move.  She  stood to the side as they worked to stabilise Brooke.  Harrison put  his arm around her shoulders but she shrugged him off, not wanting  his touches any more than she wanted to hear the sound of him weeping.</p>

<p>After moving Brooke onto a stretcher, the paramedics quickly moved  her into the back of the ambulance.  Sam rode in the front to allow  them room to help Brooke.  During the ride to the hospital she was  silent and still.  Speaking only when required to give some detail  about Brooke. Once at the hospital, Brooke had been whisked through a  set of doors.  Sam moved to follow but had been blocked by an elderly  nurse.</p>

<p>"You can't go in there honey, they have to try to help her now.  You  can wait here."  </p>

<p>She smiled sadly at Sam, a lifetime of watching people leave their  loved ones in the hands of doctors had provided her with an  understanding of pain that was often more than she wanted to have.   Sam shook her head vehemently, trying to get around the woman only to  be gently pushed back.</p>

<p>"But…but I…she…you don't understand…she's my sister…" </p>

<p>Sam struggled to get the words out around the lump that was suddenly  in her throat.  Panic swelled in her chest at the thought of Brooke  being out of her sight.  If she could see her she could reassure  herself that she was OK.  She had to be near her.  </p>

<p>"I know sweetie, I know you want to be with her but she's in the best  place possible right now with the people who can fix her.  The best  you can do is wait here and pray for her."</p>

<p>Sam looked up into the woman's kind eyes and stopped trying to move  forward.  For the first time since the accident a tear escaped Sam's  eye.  It was quickly followed by another, and another, until she was  sobbing uncontrollably in the nurse's arms.   The numbness that had  set in earlier in the evening was thawing out.  And what replaced it  was pain.  Sheer pain that tore through Sam's heart like a blade.   She cried out her agony on the nurse's shoulder, allowing herself to  be held like a child and rocked.  </p>

<p>After crying for an eternity she had finally pulled herself together  enough to be led to the relatives room.  She didn't want to be in the  waiting area where she was sure people from school would start  arriving.  She wanted to be by herself.  She didn't want to be with  people telling her that everything was alright and that Brooke would  be fine.  They didn't know that, couldn't know that.  And she  especially didn't want to see Harrison.  </p>

<hr>

<p>So she now sat alone, watching the clock and praying as the nurse had  suggested.  Sam put her face in her hands.  She wanted to scream in  frustration.  No-one had told her anything since Brooke had been  taken away, taken out of her sight.  </p>

<p>All of a sudden the door was opened and there stood her mother and  Mike, red-eyed and scared.  Wordlessly Sam stood and walked into her  mother's waiting arms.  Jane squeezed her tightly and kissed the top  of her head.  Jane had thought that she might have felt relief upon  hearing that it wasn't Sam who was hit.  But she had felt no such  thing.  If she had needed proof that Brooke was as much her daughter  as Sam was this was it.  And no-one needed this kind of proof of  anything.  Sam regarded Mike over her mother's shoulder.  He was  holding Mackenzie, cradling her, as if protecting this baby girl  would somehow help his other baby.  Sam moved out of her mother's  arms and walked up to Mike.  He held out his arm and pulled her to  him, hugging her fiercely.  Sam held onto him as she felt sobs shake  his body.  Jane gently took the baby from his arms.  Sam buried her  face in his strong shoulder as she felt her own tears coming back.  </p>

<p>Just at that moment, a soft knock was heard at the door.  Mike and  Sam separated and composed themselves.  A doctor peered around the  doorframe.</p>

<p>"Mr and Mrs McQueen?"</p>

<p>"Yes…yes that's us, how is she?  What's happening to our daughter?"   Mike asked, his voice breaking slightly.</p>

<p>The doctor came fully into the room and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Could we sit down?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>Sam felt dizzy, her breathing had become quick and shallow.  She sat  down heavily on a chair as her earlier feeling of dread returned with  a vengeance.  The expression on the doctor's face did not suggest  that he was about to impart good news.  She saw her mother clasp  Mike's hand tightly as they sat together on a sofa across from Sam.</p>

<p>"Mr and Mrs McQueen, the injuries sustained by your daughter were  very severe.  We took her to the OR where we attempted to deal with  the internal haemorrhaging but we experienced complications."</p>

<p>Sam's heart was thundering in her ears.  </p>

<p>"We used every option available to us, but despite our efforts we  were unable to save her.  I am so terribly sorry."</p>

<p>Sam felt like she had left her body as she watched her mother and  Mike collapse into each other's arms, wailing and crying.  The doctor  sat with his head bowed, knowing there was nothing he could say or do  to make things better.  Sam sat and tried to comprehend what had just  happened.  He had said Brooke was dead.  Brooke was dead.  Brooke was  dead.  Sam felt her world crumbling around her, falling slowly, piece  by piece.  The anguish threatening to erupt within her scared her  with its intensity.  If she let it out it would overwhelm her.  But  what was the use of containing it?  Brooke was dead.  There was no  point in anything.  Brooke was dead.  Dead.  Dead.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam sat bolt upright in bed, breathing heavily, face wet with tears.   She took a moment to collect herself before thinking back to her  dream.  It was so real.  It was so vivid.  But that's because it had  happened.   Everything in the dream, the events, the feelings, the  places, the sounds, everything had happened just the way it had in  the dream.  Except the doctor's words.  He hadn't said those words.   He'd said she was OK, he'd said she would be fine.</p>

<p>Sam hugged her knees to her chest and cried with relief.  She rocked  herself back and forwards, trying not to cry out loud and wake up the  other members of the household.  The grief she had felt in her dream  was still fresh in Sam's memory.  She realised that the dream had  been her own personal worst nightmare.  Brooke dying, Brooke not  being in her life anymore, that was her worst nightmare.  And during  the endless wait at the hospital two days ago she had come to realise  why.  She loved Brooke.  And not merely in a `sisterly' manner.  She  was in love with Brooke, deeply and wholly.  The fight over Harrison  had been a way to interact with Brooke in a safe way, without  revealing any feelings.  They had become closer.  And Sam now knew  that she wanted more from Brooke than Brooke would ever want to give  her.</p>

<p>But the thought of losing her was too much to bear.  The dream had  been far too realistic and had shown Sam exactly how much she needed  Brooke.   Sam was filled with a sudden need to see Brooke and be near  her.  A glance out of the window told her it was nearly dawn.  She  could make it to the hospital in fifteen minutes and reassure herself  that her dream had been just that, a dream.  She could make sure  Brooke was OK then come home before anyone noticed she'd gone.   Without giving it another thought Sam slipped out of bed and quickly  got dressed.  She crept down the stairs and out of the door.  She  just needed to know that Brooke was OK.  She needed to know.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the drive to the hospital Sam got more and more worked up about  her dream.  What if it hadn't been a dream?  What if the other  version, the one where Brooke was OK, was the dream?  She drove  faster than strictly legal but she didn't care.  She just had to get  there.</p>

<p>Sam abandoned her car in the parking lot and ran into the hospital,  careering along corridors, dodging gurneys.  As she neared Brooke's  room she slowed to a brisk walk, trying to look like she was supposed  to be there at this ungodly hour.  She couldn't risk being stopped by  a member of staff.  But she went unchallenged and finally she arrived  outside Brooke's room.  She took a deep breath, opened the door  quietly and slipped in unnoticed.  It was with immense relief that  her eyes came to rest upon Brooke, asleep, peaceful, alive.  </p>

<p>Sam covered her mouth with her hand and closed her eyes as she felt a  wave of nausea wash over her.  That was when she realised how nervous  she'd been, her stomach was in turmoil.  She leaned back against the  wall, covering her face with both hands as she wept silently.  She  slid down the wall until she was seated on the floor, still sobbing  into her hands, unable to control the emotions the experience had  aroused in her.</p>

<p>"Sam?" a groggy voice drifted over from the bed.</p>

<p>Sam looked up sharply to find that Brooke was awake and trying to sit  up.  Instantly Sam was on her feet and by Brooke's side, urging her  back onto the pillows.</p>

<p>"Sam what's wrong?  What time is it?  It's still dark."  Brooke was  very confused by Sam's presence.</p>

<p>"Shhhhh, nothing's wrong, just lie down and go back to sleep."  Sam  said as she got Brooke settled and fixed the blankets back around her.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong Sam, you're here in the middle of the night crying  your eyes out."  </p>

<p>Brooke paused and reached out for Sam's hand.  Sam was both comforted  by the gesture and saddened by how weak Brooke's grip felt.  A  combination of the drugs she was on and the stress of the accident.   Sam held her hand tightly, trying to keep her tears from re-emerging.</p>

<p>"So come on McPherson, spill it, what's up?"</p>

<p>Sam took a deep shuddering breath in an attempt to clear her head.   She debated whether or not to tell Brooke the truth about why she was  in her current state.</p>

<p>"And don't try to make something up…you're a really bad liar so I'll  be able to tell."</p>

<p>Sam looked at Brooke's face.  She looked so pale and drawn.  And yet  still breathtakingly beautiful.  Sam decided that her best way  forward was the truth.  Brooke was right, she was a terrible liar.</p>

<p>"I…uh…I just had a kind of…a bit of a bad dream, that's all."</p>

<p>"It must have been one heck of a bad dream for you to come all the  way over here…was it about the accident?"</p>

<p>Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"It must be hard for you.  I can't really remember anything about it… but you saw the whole thing.  What did you dream?"</p>

<p>Sam swallowed several times and suddenly became very interested in a  piece of lint on the blanket.  She was determined not to cry again so  she had to kill some time before speaking.  Brooke knew what she was  doing but she allowed her to take the time she needed.  After a  moment or so Sam started speaking.</p>

<p>"I saw the whole thing again in my dream, exactly how it happened.   Every detail was the same, I felt the same way I did that night."</p>

<p>The first tear made its way down Sam's cheek but she decided that  she'd have to finish now that she'd begun.</p>

<p>"I just remember being so scared, terrified.  I thought you were… well, you were on the ground and I just…anyway, so in the dream  everything was the same.  I came to the hospital with you, I waited  in a room, Mom and Mike came in with the baby…then a doctor came to  speak to us…"</p>

<p>A sob escaped Sam's throat and she brought a hand up to try to  smother the sound.  Without a word Brooke lifted up the edge of the  bed covers.  Sam understood the gesture.  In her heart she knew she  shouldn't get into bed with Brooke, not when she had feelings for  her, unrequited feelings.  But she just needed to be comforted.  And  nothing in the world would have held more appeal than lying close to  Brooke at that moment in time.  Sam kicked off her shoes and gently  climbed under the blankets with Brooke.  Brooke stretched her arm out  so that Sam had no choice but to lay her head on Brooke's shoulder.   Brooke brought her arm around Sam and held her, stroking her hair.</p>

<p>"…like I said, the doctor came to talk to us…but when he told us…he  didn't say you'd be OK, he told us that you'd…that you'd died and  then I woke up and oh God I felt like I'd been kicked in the chest,  it actually physically hurt and I just had to come over here to make  sure you were OK, I know it's silly but the thought of you being…well  it just…I just…"</p>

<p>"Shhhhh."  </p>

<p>Brooke shifted slightly so that she was able to put both arms around  Sam and hold her as she cried.  Brooke closed her eyes as she tried  to imagine how she'd feel if the positions were reversed.  She  couldn't begin to envision how she'd react if Sam had been hurt…or  killed.   She held Sam tighter as she felt tears well up in her own  eyes.  </p>

<p>"It's OK, I'm fine…I'm not dead…I'm OK."</p>

<p>Sam pulled away slightly so they could look into each other's eyes.   She offered Brooke a watery smile.</p>

<p>"I know…I knew that you were OK before I even got here.  But the  possibility that you might not be…it really frightened me.  And the  dream was so real…it was just horrible Brooke…horrible."</p>

<p>And she buried her face in Brooke's neck once more, crying at the  refreshed memories talking about the dream had brought back.  Brooke  cradled Sam.  She felt something needed to be said.  Something that  should have been said a long time ago.</p>

<p>"I love you Sam."</p>

<p>For a second Sam didn't respond.  She wasn't sure she'd heard  properly.  Or that she had misunderstood the sentiment.  Then she  realised that Brooke was waiting for a response.</p>

<p>"I love you too Brooke…that's why I was so worried…I mean I know we  argue and stuff but I really think…"</p>

<p>"I don't think you got my meaning…I'm in love with you Sam."</p>

<p>Again Sam refrained from answering straight away.  OK, there was very  little room for ambiguity in that statement.   She stared mutely into  Brooke's hazel eyes.  Sensing she wasn't about to get a reply any  time soon Brooke continued speaking.</p>

<p>"I've been in love with you for a while…and at the risk of sounding  immodest, I'm pretty sure you're in love with me too…and if you're  not I'm going to be so embarrassed in a moment.  But I don't think  I'm wrong…am I?"</p>

<p>Sam shook her head, still unable to speak.  Brooke breathed a sigh of  relief.</p>

<p>"Thank God, I'd have required serious therapy after a mortification  like that!  But anyway, you might be wondering why I've never said  anything about this before.  And you have every right to wonder  that.  And the simple truth is that I was scared.  I was scared of  what people would think.  I was scared that you'd reject me.  I was  scared of telling our parents.  I was scared of being thought of as  anything other than `normal'.  But if this accident has taught me  anything, then it's that life is far too short to be lived in fear.   And that it's far too short to live a lie.  The only truth that I'm  sure of in this world is that I'm in love with you...and if you want  to I'd really like to give us a chance.  Do you…want to, I mean?"</p>

<p>Sam nodded.  Then she cleared her throat and spoke in a slightly  trembling voice.</p>

<p>"I want…I very want.  I mean, I'd love to give us a chance.  And I  totally get what you were saying about being scared…for the longest  time I was scared even to admit it to myself.  I had almost convinced  myself that I couldn't stand you…then you'd look at me or smile at me  or talk to me and I'd melt inside.  But I don't think I truly  admitted it to myself until the other night after you were brought in  here…when I thought about the possibility of losing you…well, let's  just say there was no way I could explain away the feelings it  brought to the surface."</p>

<p>Sam smiled.  Brooke returned the smile and stroked Sam's cheek softly  unconsciously mirroring the action Sam had performed at the scene of  the accident.</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to Harrison yet?"</p>

<p>"No, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, he came in to visit me yesterday…he said that you wouldn't  take his calls and that you wouldn't even talk to him."</p>

<p>Sam looked away.  </p>

<p>"I know I shouldn't…but I kind of blamed him for what happened.  I  kept thinking if only he'd picked you then none of this would have  happened…but then I kept coming back to the fact that the whole thing  was my fault anyway…if I hadn't kept up the whole farce of wanting  Harrison then you'd be OK."</p>

<p>Brooke hooked a finger underneath Sam's chin and made her look up.</p>

<p>"Hey, stop that right now.  This is not your fault.  And it's not  Harrison's either.  It was an accident, shit happens and all that.  I  was pretending to want Harrison as well if you recall."</p>

<p>"I know but…"</p>

<p>"But nothing…it's not your fault.  Just forget all about it.  It's  history, done and dusted.  I want to move on with my life and I hope  that you want to move with me."</p>

<p>Sam nodded.  She smiled shyly at Brooke.</p>

<p>"So…should we…you know?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Kiss?"</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"I mean…yeah…sure…we should probably kiss."</p>

<p>"It feels strange…especially now that we've just discussed that we're  going to kiss…I mean, I probably shouldn't have brought it up, I'm  not the most experienced person when it comes to romantic spontaneity  so you'll have to bear with me, I'm probably not the world's best…"</p>

<p>"Sam?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh?"</p>

<p>"Shut up and kiss me."</p>

<p>Sam looked into Brooke's gently teasing eyes and felt immediately at  ease.  She brought her hand up Brooke's back and let it rest on the  back of her neck.  Slowly she leaned over and brought their lips  together in a soft, tender kiss.  They savoured the feeling for a  brief moment before parting.  Sam laid her head back on Brooke's  shoulder, allowing herself to be held.  They stayed in that position,  enjoying the warmth and security it brought to them both.  They felt  so warm and secure that they fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>They were in much the same position when Jane and Mike entered the  room a little while later.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that answers the riddle of where Sam went."  Jane  whispered.</p>

<p>"Yep."  Mike smiled at the two sleeping girls.  "They look so cute  like that don't they?"</p>

<p>Jane nodded, happy that the girls seemed finally to have accepted  each other as sisters.</p>

<p>"In fact, I'd say this is an ideal photo opportunity." </p>

<p>Mike pulled out the camera that had never been far from his hand  since Mackenzie had been born.  He snapped a picture of the  slumbering duo.  He chuckled, sure that neither of them would  appreciate being photographed while asleep.  Little did he know just  how much embarrassment the photo would cause.  After all, how many  couples can say that their parents took snapshots of them in bed the  first time they slept together?</p>
