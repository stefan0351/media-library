<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 9 -->

<p>Kelsey found Karen, as usual, in the staff lounge with her friends. She noted right off that they were not drinking and were huddled together talking. The room was fairly crowded noisy, but as soon as Kelsey stepped through the doorway, all conversations quieted and everyone watched her as she walked directly toward Karen. Karen looked up cockily, but Kelsey saw her flinch when she got close and knew that she had her attention. Kelsey calmly sat down at the table with the three women, when Pam attempted to get up and leave, Kelsey leveled her a look and quietly said, "Sit down!" Pam response was to drop back down in her seat and look back at the tall women in fear.</p>
		<p>Turning her attention back toward Karen, Kelsey moved her chair closer to the woman in an attempt to intimidate her and she would tell by the woman's demeanor that it was working. "Now, that I have your attention, I want to know exactly what happened on the beach today! Don't get smart with me either because I'm in no damn mood right now!"</p>
		<p>Karen just looked at Kelsey and didn't respond, but Kelsey could see that she was gearing up for a full-blown battle and wasn't about to be very cooperative. "Who the bloody hell do you think you are strolling in here and demanding anything from me!" Karen's voice was loud enough for the entire room to hear clearly and all talking stopped as their attention was on the table in the corner.</p>
		<p>Kelsey leaned forward a little more and kept her voice at an even timbre, but there was no mistaking her anger. "I'm not looking for a fight, but if you want trouble, I'll be your worst nightmare! That's who I am!" </p>
		<p>Karen laugh was more like a sharp bark. "Let me tell you something, Miss High and Mighty! Your little girlfriend was flaunting herself all day on the beach and when someone called her bluff, she panicked." </p>
		<p>"Let's get one thing straight. She is my roommate and assignee, not my girlfriend. I'm here as a senior officer, to find out what happened. I have no personal stake in this at all!" Kelsey's patience was beginning to quickly drain away and she wanted nothing more than to remove that smug look from off Karen's face. She looked at the blonde and held her breath as she saw a malicious look cross her face.</p>
		<p>"Yeah right! You must be losing your touch to let a virgin get away from you, or is that what you are so mad about?" Karen stood up laughing and challenging Kelsey's patience to the max. "That's it! You think I got there ahead of you and you're pissed!"</p>
		<p>Kelsey stood up and towered slightly above the other woman. "What the hell is it with you? Does every woman you meet have to be a conquest for you?"</p>
		<p>"Look whose talking!" Karen looked around Kelsey to the group at the table and shrugged her shoulders. "I'd say that's calling the kettle black."</p>
		<p>Kelsey realized that she was not going to get anywhere with Karen, except make a scene, which is exactly what the woman seemed to want. Kelsey just shook her head sadly at Karen. "You really are one sorry excuse for a woman. I feel pity for you." Kelsey looked at the women at the table to let them know that she included them in the same statement. The other two women looked away sadly and Kelsey almost felt sorry for them, but it was their choice to be friends with Karen, no one had forced them into the situation.</p>
		<p>"You pity me? I pity you...you've got your work cut out for you with your girlfriend. She doesn't know what the hell she wants, but I will say, she is a fairly decent kisser and she really has nice tits!" Karen smiled smugly and cupped her hands making a gesture to let Kelsey know that she had first hand physical knowledge of both of these facts.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's anger was hotter than she could remember it being in a long time and didn't like the way she was feeling. She didn't need this hassle, nor did she think that she should feel this strongly about the situation. She hated Karen and everything that women like her stood for, but that was no reason to get into a fight. With her hands clenched in to fists at her side, she stiffly turned and began walking away until she heard something whispered loudly behind her that sent her over the edge.</p>
		<p>"Too right! Perky little tits they were too! I tell you, I had my hands on them and she was beginning to respond nicely...half a chance and I could have had her singing my praises!" Neither of the women were looking at Karen as she talked to them, all attention was focused on Kelsey's response. Karen had gone too far this time, and they both knew it. They were quickly becoming ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with the woman, she had never really acted this badly in front of everyone before. They both knew that she hated Kelsey because since the woman had joined the crew, Karen had tried everything to get Kelsey to notice her and she had flatly refused and never hid her feelings of dislike for the blonde. This had been a bone of contention for the past three years and now, it was going to a head, a nasty one for sure. </p>
		<p>No one expected Kelsey to do what she did, but afterward, they had to admit that it was the perfect reply. Kelsey turned around and just backhanded Karen across the face. Karen fell backward into her chair from the full effect of the blow. Kelsey's voice was razor sharp and there was no mistaking what she was saying. "If I ever see you near Alyssa or hear you speak of her or any other woman in that manner, I will personally tear you apart. I suggest you go back to your cabin and start packing because before I'm through, you will have one-way ticket back to England! We don't need your kind aboard this ship!" Kelsey spun on her heels leaving Karen sitting surprised and dazed holding the side of her face. A few cheers were called out to Kelsey and she walked out and Pam and Kellie quickly got up and followed her out the door. They weren't about to lose their jobs for Karen or anyone else for that matter. </p>
