<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 10 -->

<p>Kelsey opened the cabin door to darkness and tiptoed to the bathroom. Closing the door halfway, she flipped on the light and used it as a nightlight to see in the main cabin. Kelsey walked over to Alyssa's bed and saw that the woman was sound asleep. In sleep, Alyssa's face was unmarred by the events of the day and she looked at peace, but the box of half-empty tissues on the nightstand told another story. <i>'Damn it, why couldn't you listen to me!' </i>Kelsey thought angrily and grabbed her things to go into the bathroom to change. Climbing into her bed, her mind was racing, but her body was exhausted from the adrenaline rush of earlier and she finally fell into a restless sleep.</p>
		<p>As hard as Alyssa tried she could not get out from under the heavy darkness that pressed against her. She was finding it hard to breathe and was beginning to panic. She tried pulling at what was holding her down, but only grabbed air. It seemed to wrap around her body of it's own accord and she could feel it pressing against her face cutting off her air. She could feel her lungs burning as they became starved for air and she could hear her heartbeat loudly in the darkness. She began to fight in earnest and screamed as she could feel the darkness tightening its hold on her and her world began to quake.</p>
		<p>"Alyssa, wake up! Alyssa! Your dreaming...wake up, honey!" Kelsey had grabbed the thrashing woman to try to calm her down before she hurt herself. Her arms and legs were flailing and twisting with the sheet. Kelsey realized what Alyssa was fighting and began pulling the sheet away from her body and freeing her arms and legs, once that was complete she could feel the blonde's body began to relax and she pulled her into her arms and called to her. Green eyes fluttered once and then opened and Kelsey smiled when recognition lit up in them.</p>
		<p>Alyssa was fighting with all her strength and suddenly the cloth began to lift and she could feel the cool dark air caress her overheated body. She felt a comfort from the darkness, it touched her but, she wasn't afraid and it was then she heard someone calling her and followed the voice. Opening her eyes to semi-light, she looked directly into blue eyes that changed from worried to relieved. </p>
		<p>"Are you okay?" Kelsey heard the deep soft voice ask and she felt confusion cloud her mind. "Huh?"</p>
		<p>"You were having a nightmare, do you remember?" Kelsey watched as the confusion turned to remembrance and the eyes closed against the memory. "Its okay, it' over now."</p>
		<p>"Damn." Alyssa whispered and opened tear-laden eyes. "That was so real." She took a deep breath and tried to slow her breath and her heart rate down.</p>
		<p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Kelsey continued to sit on the edge of the bed leaning over Alyssa. Her hands still holding the woman's arms lightly and debating moving, but she didn't want to let go of the connection. The hip that she rested on was beginning to cramp, but she didn't care and remained still.</p>
		<p>Alyssa thought for a long moment looking up at the ceiling. She wasn't sure how to explain what had happened to her. It seemed so real, but yet she felt so foolish now. Kelsey shifted to try to alleviate the ache that was now running from her hip down to her foot. Alyssa sensed her distress and shifted over closer to the wall in an unconscious effort to give her more room to sit. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you sit all hunched over like that."</p>
		<p>"It's Okay." Kelsey smiled and shifted further up on the bed to get off her hip and looked down and realized she couldn't see Alyssa's a face in the darkness at this distance. Kelsey finally just switched hips and leaned down on an elbow on the bed so that she could see her face and waited for Alyssa to speak. When Alyssa didn't answer for a bit, she lay her arm along Alyssa's as it rested across her waist.</p>
		<p>"If you don't want to talk, I understand."</p>
		<p>Alyssa shook her head but kept her focus on the ceiling as she began to explain. "I was trapped in the darkness and it wrapped around me and I couldn't breath. The harder I struggled the tighter the darkness held me until I could feel my lungs burning." Alyssa voice still shakily from the experience and she didn't look at Kelsey until the end when she added, "I feel really stupid now. I don't know what came over me. I don't normally have nightmares!"</p>
		<p>"Hey, it's not stupid at all given the circumstances today." Kelsey hadn't meant to let Alyssa know that she knew more about what happened today or what she had done in the staff lounge earlier. She didn't want the woman to get offended by her protective attitude. She was still trying to deal with that one herself.</p>
		<p>"You talked to Karen didn't you?" Alyssa focused her attention on Kelsey's arm on top of hers and wouldn't look the woman in the eye. She kept her voice neutral, as she wasn't really sure how she felt about it.</p>
		<p>"Yes, are you mad?" Kelsey hoped the answer would be no and she didn't give out any more information than necessary.</p>
		<p>"I guess not. So, she told you, huh?" Alyssa could feel the flush rising in her cheeks and wanted to look up to see if Kelsey was laughing at her and wondered <i>'So, are you going to make fun of me too?'</i></p>
		<p>"I don't know exactly what happened except that she hurt you and that was enough." Kelsey answered and thought about her next step. "And, I don't think you will have to worry about her much anymore. I'm going to see that she is dismissed and sent packing to England!" The bitterness in Kelsey's voice was unmistakable and Alyssa shivered wondering if she was mad because it happened to her, or that it happened in general.</p>
		<p>Kelsey moved closer and squeezed the arm she held. "There is nothing more to worry about. I don't think you will have any trouble from Pam or Kellie either."</p>
		<p>"No, Pam and Kellie weren't even there when it happened." Alyssa's voice was low, almost a whisper as if speaking of it made it more real.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's anger spiked as she thought about all the possibilities of what actually did happen. Finally, she took a chance and asked, "Did she hurt you?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa looked up surprised at Kelsey. <i>'Karen didn't tell her!'</i> And when she noticed the worry begin to creep back into the blue eyes, she quickly shook her head and looked away. "It wasn't that bad."</p>
		<p>"Meaning?"</p>
		<p>"At first she just kissed me and then things progressed until she pinched my...umm...you know...umm...boob really hard." The flush fully infused her face and she wished it wasn't so warm in the room.</p>
		<p>"Is it okay?" Kelsey asked quickly looking from the green eyes down to the chest and back up. Alyssa grinned as her face reddened and shook her head affirmative. "It's just a little tender that's all."</p>
		<p>"Damn her!"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry." Alyssa looked away afraid to see the anger and disappointment in the other woman's eyes. She had wanted to prove herself to everyone and had, instead, shown how naive she really was. <i>'I'm such a jerk!'</i></p>
		<p>Kelsey's anger waned at the catch in Alyssa's voice and she lifted the blonde's face toward her. "No, you have nothing to apologize for, you did nothing wrong." </p>
		<p>"You tried to warn me, but I was too stubborn to listen."</p>
		<p>Kelsey stood up and smiled down at Alyssa. "Unfortunately, we all do that sometimes."</p>
		<p>"I guess so. I just wanted to prove I could take care of myself and instead, I prove just the opposite." Alyssa shook her head disgusted.</p>
		<p>"Well, it's your first tour and we all learn the hard way. Now, I think it's time that Karen learned a valuable lesson." Kelsey moved toward the door and stopped when Alyssa called out.</p>
		<p>"Wait! What are you going to do?"</p>
		<p>"I'm going to have a talk with the Staff Director about a one-way ticket for Karen."</p>
		<p>Alyssa shook her head, she just wanted to forget the whole matter and not have anyone else know about what happened. It was bad enough she had to tell the story to Kelsey. "I really rather you didn't get involved and just let this go."</p>
		<p>"It's too late, I'm already involved. As your senior officer, I have a duty to report Karen, and it's about time she was put in her place. There is no room for people like her on this crew." Kelsey turned toward the door with a purpose. She wasn't thrilled that Alyssa was still trying to cover for Karen and wondered, <i>"She can't still want Karen?'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa bristled at the comment reacted harshly. "Well, I wouldn't want you to shirk your duty or anything, but I'd rather things were just forgotten."</p>
		<p>Kelsey looked back at Alyssa and her blood flared at the rebuff. "Well, you should have thought about that before you got yourself involved in grown up things you weren't ready to handle."</p>
