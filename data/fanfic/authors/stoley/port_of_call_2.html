<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>Hanging up the telephone, Alyssa realized that the only person she would miss would be her mother, but she promised to call and write and often as possible. She could hear the catch in her mother's throat as they said good-bye and the enthusiasm of an hour ago dimmed as Alyssa thought seriously about the task she was undertaking. The job itself was a 'no-brainer' as far as ALYSSA was concerned, but what about the hours in between her duty schedule. She knew no one on this job and had never been one to make friends quickly, and she would be far away from everyone she had ever known.</p>
		<p>The doubt and fears began to creep in causing Alyssa to second guess her decision. But, before she let these fears take root, she decided to get out of the hotel room and take a walk over to the shops at Bay Shore. She bought a couple of trinkets to send back home and ended up sitting down by the water to decide where she wanted to eat. Deep in thought she didn't realize anything was wrong until she felt her purse being ripped from her shoulder. She held on as hard as she could to the one strap, but it broke and the assailant began to run between the tables of diners at the outdoor café and suddenly found himself sprawled out on the pavement. Rising from one of the tables was the tall woman from the Cruise lines. She bent over and retrieved Alyssa's purse and the man scrambled to get away from the growing crowd. </p>
		<p>Kelsey had seen the whole thing coming and got lucky when the man ran in her direction. She just stuck her leg out at the last minute sending the thief flying threw the air. She leaned down and picked up the purse as he ran away. She had no intentions of following him or getting involved as she was shipping out the next morning and didn't need anything to get in the way. Holding the purse she looked over at the startled blonde and blew out a breath as she walked over toward her thinking, '<i>She had better start getting a grip on life before she finds herself in trouble or worse.'</i> </p>
		<p>"I think this is yours." Kelsey stated matter of fact and held out the purse by its broken strap. Close up she saw that she was average height, blonde and kind of cute, but when she looked up into the brilliant green eyes , they caused her to take a second look and then a third. </p>
		<p>"Thank you. I never saw him coming." Alyssa gushed as the women stood looking at her so intently. She could feel the flush running up her cheeks at the close scrutiny. "Umm, my name is Alyssa."</p>
		<p>Kelsey hadn't heard a word the woman was saying and didn't realize that she was even talking until she saw her expression change to that of embarrassment. <i>'Damn Kelsey! Pay attention yourself!' </i>Kelsey scowled thinking.</p>
		<p>"You need to pay attention around here or you are going to get hurt." Kelsey's voice sounded more curt than she had intended it to, but she had been caught off guards and was angry with herself. </p>
		<p>"I'm sorry." Alyssa quickly replied to the woman. She hadn't even acknowledged the pleasantries of an introduction and Alyssa was taken back at the brusque behavior.</p>
		<p>"Okay, but be more careful and less sorry." Kelsey answered and turned to walk away. She didn't know why she was being so obnoxious right now and decided to take her moody self away before said anything more.</p>
		<p>"Your welcome!" Alyssa murmured tersely under her breath as she watched the raven-haired woman walk away. "I'm glad to meet you too."</p>
		<p>Kelsey's back stiffed as she heard the woman's comments, it was a pain to have such good hearing sometimes. Now, she felt like a bitch for acting the way she had to the woman. Feeling guilty, Kelsey turned at the first row of stores and decided to keep and eye on the woman to make sure there were no repeat performances tonight, at least that is what she told herself she was doing. She watched the blonde intently as she got up and went over to the nearby café and was seated at one of the tables. Kelsey waited long enough to watch the blonde order her dinner and then left to pick up a few things. She figured the blonde was safe for the moment as waked away thinking, <i>'What did she say her name was? Oh yeah, Alyssa. Hmm, nice enough name.' </i>Kelsey walked down to the drugstore to stock up on some of the items she would need for the time being. </p>
		<p>Alyssa looked at her purse strap and knew that it was irreparable and shrugged. She really didn't think she would need a purse for awhile anyway. Staring out over the ocean she remembered the conversation between the woman and the receptionist and the remark about having dinner with her aunt. "Guess we know that wasn't true." Alyssa couldn't help but wonder about the dark haired stranger and if she possibly worked on board ship too. Her musings were interrupted by the arrival of her dinner and she concentrating on eating it. She hated to eat alone and ate quickly and while she waited for her bill, she decided she had enough excitement for one night. Staring out over the water and the evening sky, she decided to just go back to the hotel to get some sleep. </p>
		<p>Kelsey returned to her lookout spot and was slightly relieved to see that Alyssa was still there. She watched the young woman for a few moments and noticed the sadness in her face as she sat alone. Kelsey was no stranger to that look, it was one that stared back at her every time she looked into a mirror. <i>'Maybe she doesn't have anyone either' </i>Kelsey quickly shook off these remorse thoughts, <i>'Hey, it's not the end of the world!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa made her way back past the shops toward her hotel. She was glad that they had put her up so close to everything so that she wasn't stuck in her hotel the entire time. Even with her little purse mishap, she was happy that she had a chance to look around a bit before she sailed in the morning. <i>'I'm sailing in the morning!'</i> She kept chanting to herself with one huge smile on her face. So wrapped up in her own little world again, Alyssa never realized that she was being followed again as she entered the hotel lobby and took the elevator up to her floor. </p>
		<p>Kelsey followed at a discrete distance and smiled when she realized they were staying at the same hotel. <i>'Good, I won't have to go out of my way playing Good Samaritan. I'm just walking back to my hotel.'</i> She told herself as she followed the blonde into the lobby and waited for the next elevator to take her up to her own floor.</p>
