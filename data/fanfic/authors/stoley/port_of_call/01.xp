		<p>The minutes seemed to drag on into hours as Alyssa waited to be called for her interview. She was taking a step out of her ordinary life and trying to get a position with a cruise line. Adventure and sailing the high seas for living was the ticket for her. No more working in the dull, dusty library of a small down where each day blended into the next. She was beginning to feel like one of the old worn out books that she watched being reshelved every day. Her job was the total sum of the Accounting Department, which basically meant that she was in charge of all accounts payable and receivable from overdue book fines to the purchase of new books. Each day she arrived at the library at dawn and didn't leave until dusk, putting in long hours as part of her duties. She was beginning to feel like one of the children of the night and her pale skin reflected this lack of sunlight. Her family consisted of her mother and father and two brothers, both of which worked construction alongside their father. Her mother remained a housewife, because that is what her father wanted. Alyssa had lived in this town for all of her 28 years and, although she was attractive, she never seemed to date anyone for very long. Her brother's told her that she was looking for Mr. Perfect and would never find anyone. Her mother's response was that she didn't have to settle for less either. Her mother had always been her source of encouragement and had made sure that she had gone to the community college to get her degree. She was happy with her life, but she didn't want her daughter to have to settle if it wasn't what she wanted to do with her life. Alyssa wasn't sure what she wanted to do, she just knew that working in the library wasn't it. So, when the Recruitment Fair came to the local community college, Alyssa was one of the first in line to get in. She walked along the booths that had been set up for various local and national recruiting organizations until she came to the Holiday Cruise Line booth. There as big as life, was a poster of the deck of a ship with a group of people standing in their starched white uniforms, tanned and smiling encouraging her to join them in their fun. ALYSSA walked directly toward the table and began to leaf through the brochures, before she knew it, a week later she was sitting in their offices in Miami waiting for her final interview before receiving her assignment. She had flown in this morning and had been met and taken directly to her hotel to register before being bussed to the Cruise Line's offices. She had never been to Miami, let alone Florida and couldn't wait to get out and see the sights.</p>
		<p>The door opened and Alyssa looked up as a tall dark-haired woman walked in. She had the most striking blue eyes that Alyssa had ever seen. The woman walked with an assured grace, comfortable in her tall body and with life in general. Her white shorts and pale blue polo shirt contrasted well against her firm tanned skin. Alyssa watched with in awe as she strolled over to the counter and leaned against it waiting for the woman behind it to look up.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Kelsey! It's been too long, welcome back! You ready for another tour at sea?" The receptionist looked up with unveiled interest. "We've missed you!" "Kelsey?"</p>
		<p>Kelsey looked around at all applicants that were waiting and thought, <i>'I'll just bet you have'</i>. Her attention was caught by a blonde in the corner who, to her embarrassment, was looking straight at her with a look all to familiar to Kelsey. She looked like a deer caught in the headlights, a 'newbie', scared to death and looking for adventure on the high seas. Unfortunately, what she would find is a lot of long hours and hard work for very little thanks. But, the pay was good and Kelsey loved the open air and the smell of the see so she kept coming back each season. Hearing her name called again, Kelsey turned back toward the receptionist. </p>
		<p>"Yes sorry, umm thanks Sandy...I guess I'm ready to head back out. The break never seems long enough though, does it?" Kelsey smiled down at the receptionist trying to be polite. She had continually rebuffed the woman's advances, but that didn't stop her from always trying. Kelsey wasn't interested in getting involved with anyone right now, at least not Sandy.</p>
		<p>"No, I guess it doesn't, but at least you aren't stuck behind this desk all the time." Sandy pulled out a packet and handed it to Kelsey. "Here is your room and duty assignments. Ship Orientation is tomorrow at 10 AM in the ODR (officers dining room), you are expected to board at 8 AM and get settled before the meeting." Kelsey nodded her understanding, nothing new just the usual routine.</p>
		<p>Sandy laid the packet on the top of the counter but didn't let it go when Kelsey tugged on it. Kelsey looked up questioningly into the hazel eyes and instantly knew what was coming. "If you aren't doing anything tonight, maybe we can get dinner and catch a movie before you ship out?"</p>
		<p>Kelsey plastered a look of regret on her face and shook her head, "Oh, I'm sorry. I've made plans to spend the evening with my aunt."</p>
		<p>Sandy didn't seem pleased as her eyes narrowed when she remarked. "I didn't know you had any family, you folder lists your parents as deceased."</p>
		<p>"Yes, they are. My aunt is my only living relative and is listed as my next of kin for emergency purposes." Kelsey replied trying hard to keep her solicitous look on her face. One of these days she was going to tell the woman off and be finished with her constant fishing expeditions, but she didn't want to jeopardize her assignments either. She knew that Sandy had pull when it came to the assignment of rooms and duties. Kelsey had tried every other way to let Sandy know that she just wasn't interested in her. It wasn't because she was a woman, because Kelsey was a lover of all things female, just not this one.</p>
		<p>"Maybe when you get back then." Sandy murmured and let go of the packet and Kelsey whisked it quickly away before turning and waving good-bye on her way out. <i>'Whew! Another reprieve!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa watched the interaction between the women and for some reason was happy when the tall one turned down the receptionist. She hadn't been real thrilled with the way the redhead had eyed here when she first came in, too pushy for Alyssa's taste. Alyssa had never dated a woman before, but the idea was far from foreign to her. There were little opportunities in her town, which was one of the reasons why she never had a date. Alyssa grinned thinking, <i>'If her brother's only knew!'</i> Caught in her daydream, she didn't hear her name called the first time. The second time she looked up and the receptionist was looking at her impatiently as she called her name again.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, that's me." Alyssa quickly rose and went toward the counter. Sandy looked at her curiously before shaking her head and giving her directions where to go for her interview. Nodding in understanding Alyssa finally thanked her and went down the hallway that the woman had indicated.</p>
		<p>"12-B, this must be the room." Alyssa mumbled to herself and smoothed out her shirt before knocking on the door and waiting for a response. She heard a muffled voice call come from behind the door and she turned the knob to open the door and enter. The room turned out to be a small conference room consisting of a table with a couple of chairs around it. Seated on the other side of the table was a man in an officer's uniform of the cruise line. He quickly stood smiling and looked down at the packet and then back at her and said, "You must be Alyssa..."</p>
		<p>"Yes, I am." Alyssa walked up to the table and stopped.</p>
		<p>The officer held his hand out for a handshake and introduced himself. "Great, I'm Mark, Chief Purser. Welcome to Holiday Cruise Lines. Please, have a seat."</p>
		<p>He waited until Alyssa was comfortably seated before beginning. "May I call you Alyssa? We run a pretty informal ship in the Pursers office."</p>
		<p>Alyssa nodded and replied, "Yes, Please do."</p>
		<p>"Great! I'm not sure how much they have told you, but should you accept this assignment you will be attached to the Pursers Office. With your background, we can certainly use you." Mark replied opening up the manila envelope with her name on it.</p>
		<p>"So, far all I've been told are the basics about employment, salary, benefits, etc. They told me I would learn about the job assignment itself at this interview." Alyssa leaned forward on the desk excited with the knowledge that she actually had the job if she wanted it. At the last interview, they had left her to believe that nothing was final until she received an actual assignment, and this was it!</p>
		<p>"Well, then let me tell you about your assignment then." Mark answered happily and began to turn the papers in Alyssa's direction so that she could follow along. "Your assignment, as I stated before, is with the Pursers Office. Your duties will include manning the Pursers Desk in the main atrium. Most of your role will be to act as a cashier of sorts, cashing checks, exchanging currency and things of this nature. You will rotate with three other Officers on a set schedule. We are all a pretty friendly group and I don't mind any switching of schedules between officers as long as it is noted on the rooster ahead of time. Other than that, at the end of each shift, the officer is expected to total out their transactions for the day and log them in the computer system. This will ensure that we have ample funds and various currencies available for the passengers. Most of which is kept in a safe and either myself or the Assistant Chief Purser, Monica have access to, and in rare emergencies, the captain. But, we don't like to trouble him with the day to day running of our office." Mark sat back smiling and waited for everything to sink in before continuing, "So, do you have any questions?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa thought for a moment before answer. It didn't sound like that difficult of a job to her and actually it might be fun to actually talk to the various passengers. In the library, she never got to talk to anyone. "Well, the job sounds good. You've seemed to explain it fully."</p>
		<p>"So, think you might be interested in joining us this season?" Mark waited for her response before going into the rest of the details of uniforms and rules.</p>
		<p>"Oh yes! I think I'd like that very much!" Alyssa was so happy that her smile must have stretched from ear to ear. She was going to sea!</p>
		<p>"Terrific!" Mark rubbed his hands together in excitement for the young woman. She seemed to be an easily likable person and would have no problem fitting in with his staff. "Okay, next let me tell you about your uniform, room assignment and the rest."</p>
		<p>Mark pulled out more papers from the envelope and went over them with Alyssa. Since this was her first season with the Cruise lines she had been assigned to room with an experienced officer who could show her the ropes. Alyssa had been assigned to bunk with the Assistant Sports Director for the duration of this cruise. It was the Cruise line's policy to mix their officers from the various departments so that everyone could get acquainted and also get to know how other parts of the ship operated. Mark signed her slip for her uniforms and after welcoming her again, sent her along on the next phase of her employee orientation. </p>
		<p>By late afternoon, all arrangements for uniforms and essentials, medical releases and paperwork had been filed and taken care of, and Alyssa was free until she was to report to the ship at 8 AM the next morning. Exhausted but exhilarated, Alyssa headed to her hotel room to call home and change. She wanted to get something to eat and check out the sights before it got to late. The call home was the hardest thing she would have to do. It was for sure now, that she would be gone for at least 12 months on this duty assignment. She wouldn't be able to see her family unless they booked passage aboard her assigned ship. She could call and write, but that was about all the she would have time to do. There were no side trips unless for an emergency.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 2">
		<p>Hanging up the telephone, Alyssa realized that the only person she would miss would be her mother, but she promised to call and write and often as possible. She could hear the catch in her mother's throat as they said good-bye and the enthusiasm of an hour ago dimmed as Alyssa thought seriously about the task she was undertaking. The job itself was a 'no-brainer' as far as ALYSSA was concerned, but what about the hours in between her duty schedule. She knew no one on this job and had never been one to make friends quickly, and she would be far away from everyone she had ever known.</p>
		<p>The doubt and fears began to creep in causing Alyssa to second guess her decision. But, before she let these fears take root, she decided to get out of the hotel room and take a walk over to the shops at Bay Shore. She bought a couple of trinkets to send back home and ended up sitting down by the water to decide where she wanted to eat. Deep in thought she didn't realize anything was wrong until she felt her purse being ripped from her shoulder. She held on as hard as she could to the one strap, but it broke and the assailant began to run between the tables of diners at the outdoor café and suddenly found himself sprawled out on the pavement. Rising from one of the tables was the tall woman from the Cruise lines. She bent over and retrieved Alyssa's purse and the man scrambled to get away from the growing crowd. </p>
		<p>Kelsey had seen the whole thing coming and got lucky when the man ran in her direction. She just stuck her leg out at the last minute sending the thief flying threw the air. She leaned down and picked up the purse as he ran away. She had no intentions of following him or getting involved as she was shipping out the next morning and didn't need anything to get in the way. Holding the purse she looked over at the startled blonde and blew out a breath as she walked over toward her thinking, '<i>She had better start getting a grip on life before she finds herself in trouble or worse.'</i> </p>
		<p>"I think this is yours." Kelsey stated matter of fact and held out the purse by its broken strap. Close up she saw that she was average height, blonde and kind of cute, but when she looked up into the brilliant green eyes , they caused her to take a second look and then a third. </p>
		<p>"Thank you. I never saw him coming." Alyssa gushed as the women stood looking at her so intently. She could feel the flush running up her cheeks at the close scrutiny. "Umm, my name is Alyssa."</p>
		<p>Kelsey hadn't heard a word the woman was saying and didn't realize that she was even talking until she saw her expression change to that of embarrassment. <i>'Damn Kelsey! Pay attention yourself!' </i>Kelsey scowled thinking.</p>
		<p>"You need to pay attention around here or you are going to get hurt." Kelsey's voice sounded more curt than she had intended it to, but she had been caught off guards and was angry with herself. </p>
		<p>"I'm sorry." Alyssa quickly replied to the woman. She hadn't even acknowledged the pleasantries of an introduction and Alyssa was taken back at the brusque behavior.</p>
		<p>"Okay, but be more careful and less sorry." Kelsey answered and turned to walk away. She didn't know why she was being so obnoxious right now and decided to take her moody self away before said anything more.</p>
		<p>"Your welcome!" Alyssa murmured tersely under her breath as she watched the raven-haired woman walk away. "I'm glad to meet you too."</p>
		<p>Kelsey's back stiffed as she heard the woman's comments, it was a pain to have such good hearing sometimes. Now, she felt like a bitch for acting the way she had to the woman. Feeling guilty, Kelsey turned at the first row of stores and decided to keep and eye on the woman to make sure there were no repeat performances tonight, at least that is what she told herself she was doing. She watched the blonde intently as she got up and went over to the nearby café and was seated at one of the tables. Kelsey waited long enough to watch the blonde order her dinner and then left to pick up a few things. She figured the blonde was safe for the moment as waked away thinking, <i>'What did she say her name was? Oh yeah, Alyssa. Hmm, nice enough name.' </i>Kelsey walked down to the drugstore to stock up on some of the items she would need for the time being. </p>
		<p>Alyssa looked at her purse strap and knew that it was irreparable and shrugged. She really didn't think she would need a purse for awhile anyway. Staring out over the ocean she remembered the conversation between the woman and the receptionist and the remark about having dinner with her aunt. "Guess we know that wasn't true." Alyssa couldn't help but wonder about the dark haired stranger and if she possibly worked on board ship too. Her musings were interrupted by the arrival of her dinner and she concentrating on eating it. She hated to eat alone and ate quickly and while she waited for her bill, she decided she had enough excitement for one night. Staring out over the water and the evening sky, she decided to just go back to the hotel to get some sleep. </p>
		<p>Kelsey returned to her lookout spot and was slightly relieved to see that Alyssa was still there. She watched the young woman for a few moments and noticed the sadness in her face as she sat alone. Kelsey was no stranger to that look, it was one that stared back at her every time she looked into a mirror. <i>'Maybe she doesn't have anyone either' </i>Kelsey quickly shook off these remorse thoughts, <i>'Hey, it's not the end of the world!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa made her way back past the shops toward her hotel. She was glad that they had put her up so close to everything so that she wasn't stuck in her hotel the entire time. Even with her little purse mishap, she was happy that she had a chance to look around a bit before she sailed in the morning. <i>'I'm sailing in the morning!'</i> She kept chanting to herself with one huge smile on her face. So wrapped up in her own little world again, Alyssa never realized that she was being followed again as she entered the hotel lobby and took the elevator up to her floor. </p>
		<p>Kelsey followed at a discrete distance and smiled when she realized they were staying at the same hotel. <i>'Good, I won't have to go out of my way playing Good Samaritan. I'm just walking back to my hotel.'</i> She told herself as she followed the blonde into the lobby and waited for the next elevator to take her up to her own floor.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 3">
		<p>Kelsey was up at the crack of dawn, packed and ready to get onboard and get settled. She knew the ship orientation by heart, but it was mandatory for all officers to attend. <i>'Yipee!'</i> she thought glumly and headed down to the lobby to find a newspaper and a cup of coffee to kill some time.</p>
		<p>Alyssa heard music playing in the background and rolled over and fell back asleep. It wasn't until the phone rang that she jumped up awake, it was her wake up call from the front desk. She had used it as a backup in case she failed to wake up to the alarm in the room. She quickly hung up the phone and ran for the shower, grateful that she had the presence of mind to call the desk or she would still be sleeping as the ship pulled out of the harbor. Getting up early had never been a favorite past time for Alyssa, who liked to sleep as late as possible in the mornings. But, she knew that those days were long gone with this new job. She would be on a rotating schedule of shifts. The Purser's Desk was to be manned from 5 am to 9 PM every day, seven days a week. Being new woman on the totem pole, so to speak, she had a feeling she would be pulling a lot of early morning shifts.</p>
		<p>Alyssa caught the second employee bus pickup to the cruise ship and stumbled on board with the rest of the arriving crew. All her things had been previously sent to the ship except for her overnight bag, which she carried. As she waited on the dock to board the ship she rummaged through her bag for her ID<i>. </i>Each ID listed, beneath their photo, their name, rank and country of citizenship.<i> 'Photo ID must be worn by all employees at all times, and must be carried on their person even off duty.' </i>Her mind quoting what she had read from the Employee Handbook. Placing the chain around her neck, the ID badge hung to almost her waist. Frowning, she let it go. Enough time later to worry about the small stuff. When it was her turn to board, she showed her ID and her paperwork and was directed toward her cabin. She had never been on a cruise ship before and she could feel the excitement building as she walked down the passageway looking for her cabin number. She knew that officers received better quarters than other employees, but usually cabins that the paying customer wouldn't want. Either they were too small, or too out of the way. Alyssa was surprised to find that she had to go up two decks to find her cabin. She didn't think that the crew were actually bunked above the level she was currently on and hoped that it wasn't a mistake. Now, was not the time to be running around trying to find her cabin, orientation was in 30 min. and she had wanted to be early to make sure she got a good seat. She hadn't realized how long it would take to go through the boarding process or that there were this many employees on a cruise ship. This was a whole new world for Alyssa and she was constantly amazed at what she didn't know.</p>
		<p>Kelsey made her way forward on the Promenade Deck and was happy to see that she had gotten one of the better officer cabins. She wondered if she had Sandy to thank for this and if she shouldn't give in and go to dinner her just once. Cringing at the thought, she figured she would just enjoy her good fortune while it lasted and take the bad with the good later. Entering the cabin, Kelsey chose the bed farthest away from the door, remember past nightmares with roommates that came in all hours of the night, usually drunk and falling on the nearest bed, hers. She would not only be jarred awake, but she would have to get up and put her roommates to bed, before getting back in her own and trying to fall back asleep while they snored in their liquor induced comas. Nope, this time she was taking the rack by the window and going to get some sleep at night! Their gear was all sitting outside the door and she went and pulled her familiar duffel bags into the room and began the task of unpacking. She wondered who her roommate would be this year and hoped it wasn't some starry-eyed newbie that thought every night was made for a new conquest. The only rule that Kelsey loved about the Cruise line was that no opposite sexes were allowed in employee's cabins. Kelsey smiled glad that she wouldn't have to put up with the new recruits bringing home a new man every night. Only with one roommate had Kelsey closed her eyes to the infraction and allowed her to bring a man to the cabin. It was one of the few friends' that Kelsey had ever made on her voyages. Carol and her husband were fresh out of college and both on working the season to save money to get their own home. Carol and Kelsey had set up a schedule where three nights a week Kelsey wouldn't come back to the room until midnight. On those nights, Kelsey spent a lot of time hanging out in the employee lounge and other creative places while she waited until she could get back into their room. Her favorite place was on a deck chair in the front of the ship where no one usually went. She could look up at the stars as the evening breezes washed over her body. It was the nearest she ever came to feeling at peace in her entire life. With the billions of stars above her and the gentle caress of the wind, she felt she wasn't alone. Kelsey had many relationships in her lifetime, but none had ever made her feel that way, which is probably why she had given up searching for someone to complete her world. Now at 33, she just did what she had to, to live and left the foolish ideas of romance to the youth. Kelsey felt a presence at the door and turned to face to face with her new roommate, a quick spark tingled her heart and startled her, instantly jolting her out of her revere. This sudden uncertainty allowed her to shut down all emotions and inwardly she groaned, <i>"Oh great! Babysitting detail!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa stood looking from the paper in her hand to the number of the door and then back to the tall raven-haired woman that stood in her cabin. <i>'No, please tell me this isn't happening! Tell me, that I'm not going to spend the next year of my life with 'happy' here!' </i>The two women stood looking at each other with neither one making the first attempt to break the silence. Finally, Alyssa cleared her throat and asked, "Promenade B4?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"I think this is my cabin." Alyssa replied uncertainly, afraid to enter the room and not sure of what to do otherwise.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's patience did not seem to be at it's best today and her reply was anything but cordial. "Are those your bags in the corridor?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa looked down at her things next to the door and nodded without speaking.</p>
		<p>"Well, then I guess you in the right place." Kelsey replied flippantly and finished her packing. She silently kicked herself for her behavior and didn't look at the blonde and she struggled to pull her things into the room and stood looking around unsure of herself. </p>
		<p>Kelsey turned to face the woman and maintained her composure to calmly instruct her new roommate. "That bed is yours and this dresser and the closet on the right behind you. You need to hurry and unpack as ship orientation is in 20 minutes in the ODR." Not waiting for a response from the blonde, KELSEY walked past her and out the door and headed down to the briefing wondering what it was about the woman that made her act so stupidly.</p>
		<p>Alyssa sat down on the edge of her assigned bed and felt a rise of panic well up in her. Taking a deep breath, she got herself under control and let her anger take over. Getting up she yanked her suitcase upon the bed and began to pull out her things and shove them into drawers. Opening up the closet, she noticed her new uniforms and placed the few other dressy items that she had brought next to them on the hangers. Finished, she shoved her suitcases under her bed and looked at her watch. She had 5 minutes to get to the Officer's Dining Room for orientation. Hesitating at her dress, she remembered that her roommate hadn't changed into her uniform either and grabbed what she assumed was her cabin key off the dress and went in search of where she needed to be. She finally found a stream of people heading and one direction and tagged along, hoping they knew where they were going. Arriving at the orientation, ALYSSA took a seat in the back next to a group of women who seemed friendly enough and introduced themselves. They were all from one department and worked the various lounges. ALYSSA was glad that she seemed to find some friendly faces and possible future friends and looked around the room to find her roommate sitting up near the front talking to a group of people who all looked as equally tanned and fit as she did. She began to wonder what exactly their assignments were.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm...honey, don't even bother there, nothing but ice." Alyssa turned to face the accented voice that she heard next to her. The woman's bade said that her name was Karen and she was from England.</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>Karen pointed toward Alyssa's roommate. "Kelsey. Yeah, she is gorgeous, but a dead end for sure. Now Terri, the brunette next to her, she is really a nice yank!" Karen winked and smiled at Alyssa.</p>
		<p>Flushed and embarrassed Alyssa stammered, "No, you don't understand....she's my roommate."</p>
		<p>"KELSEY?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa nodded to the woman. "You are one lucky yank!" Karen patted her on the arm proudly and turned to tell the group of her new discovery. All the women laughing and congratulating Alyssa, which made her feel very uncomfortable. She wasn't sure what she had expected, but certainly not this, she had expected there to be some gay women on the cruise, but not everyone she met! <i>'This is too funny!'</i> Alyssa thought smiling and looked back over at Kelsey and saw that she was looking directly at her with a very unhappy look on her face. Alyssa quickly lost the smile and looked away as the speaker approached the microphone. The entire orientation was spent with Alyssa trying to pay attention and not look over at her new roommate. She wasn't being very successful, but on more than one occasion, she found those blue eyes looking right back at her.</p>
		<p>After the orientation, lunch was served and the women began to talk about the opening of the season party that evening in the crew's lounge. It was B.Y.O.B and most of the women had planned ahead and brought alcohol on board with them. Alyssa had never thought about that when she packed as she had never been much of a drinker. The woman assured her that there would be plenty to go around and that she should just show up. After lunch, the crew was released to meetings in their various departments. Alyssa parted ways with her new friends with a promise to show up at the party later that evening and headed toward the Purser's office. Kelsey watched as the women watched Alyssa away from their group and the whispering that went on among the little gang. <i>'Damn, of all the groups to attach herself to...she goes out of her way an picks the worst! Lord knows what they've already told her.'</i> Kelsey shoved her papers in her portfolio and headed toward the equipment room with her team. There were still schedules to decide upon and events to plan, she knew that she had a full afternoon ahead of her. She wouldn't be able to talk to Alyssa and warn her until later that evening. <i>'Let's just hope she doesn't have a problem with it, cabin switching at this late date would cause a world of trouble for both of them.'</i></p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 4">
		<p>Alyssa actually enjoyed the afternoon she spent with the other officers in her team. She got a copy of her schedule, which didn't look too bad, but as she has thought, she had a lot of early morning shifts. From what she had learned, being an officer had it's advantages. Their days were markedly shorter than the average crewmember. An average crewmember worked anywhere from 12 to 16 hours a day, where and officer only worked 10 to 12, with one day a week off to go ashore. She found that some crew members never went ashore due to their visa status, but being an American with a passport, meant she could get off at any of the stops long the way. Alyssa had dinner with her co-workers before heading back toward her cabin to change for the party. She was looking forward to spending some time making some friends to go ashore sightseeing with. Alyssa hadn't seen her roommate since the orientation and when she entered the empty cabin, she assumed Kelsey was still with her teammates. Quickly, showering and changing into Khaki shorts and a black tank top, Alyssa dabbed on some perfume for good measure and headed toward the Crew's lounge.</p>
		<p>It had been a long exhausting day for Kelsey and she wanted nothing more than to relax and get things organized for tomorrow's passengers. Her days of idle relaxing were over now that her tour had started. As Assistant Sports Director it was her duty to see that every schedule and activity was planned and manned throughout the entire cruise. The first cruise was usually the hardest, getting everyone adjusted and then after that they pretty much followed the same pattern for each cruise. She had a good crew working with her this season and things should run pretty smoothly once all the bugs were ironed out, which is what they had been trying to do this afternoon and evening. It was later than Kelsey had thought and she hurried toward the cabin hoping at best to find Alyssa sound asleep, but at worst wide awake and ready wanting to talk. As soon as Kelsey entered the cabin and got one whiff of the air, she knew the worst would have been preferable to what was probably happening. Throwing her things on her bed, she headed back out the cabin door toward the party. Kelsey looked down at her watch, it was already 11:30 PM and the party had been in full swing since about 9:30 PM. "Damn!" Cursing under her breath, Kelsey hurried toward the Crew's Lounge. Knowing the party of women in question, it was anyone's guess as to what had already transpired this evening. She just hoped that her fears were unfounded and that Alyssa was actually more intune then she gave her credit. </p>
		<p>Kelsey entered the smoky lounge to loud music and a packed room of partygoers having a good time. Kelsey relaxed until she heard a roar of cheers over the din of the room and looked toward the corner. On a table in the back stood a very drunk Alyssa trying to sway seductively to the music as a group of men and women circled the table cheering her on to take her clothes off and handing her drinks to keep her primed. Alyssa looked completely out of touch with what was going on and was just following the crowds lead as to what to do next. Kelsey took a deep breath and let it out slowly before she made her way through the crowded room. <i>'This isn't going to be fun.'</i></p>
	</chapter>

		<p>Kelsey took a deep breath and made her way through the crowded room or party goers and slid in between the revelers that surrounded the table Alyssa stood atop. <i>'Here goes nothing!'</i></p>
		<p>"Well roomie, I think you've had enough excitement for one night." The tall raven-haired woman reached a hand up to help Alyssa down off the table, but her arm was jerked around stopping her. Spinning around quickly, Kelsey faced a blonde-haired man and the look on her face gave him reason to think twice about what he was doing. </p>
		<p>"Hey, no harm mate. We was just having a spot of fun with the 'newbie'. He raised his hands in a mock surrender and backed off. Kelsey looked at the group around the table before resting her eyes on one of the women that she knew was behind this. "I think this 'newbie' has had enough. I don't want any trouble, I just came to collect my roommate."</p>
		<p>"Maybe she isn't ready to go, isn't that right love?" Karen reached up to hand Alyssa another drink and looked back at Kelsey challengingly. Kelsey shook her head slowly and looked up at the blonde to see if what Karen said could possibly be true. Alyssa's expression was one of confusion as she first looked toward Karen and then at Kelsey. The full affect of the alcohol was finally beginning to hit her. Kelsey watched as the confusion turn to fear and then something else that triggered a response in her. Kelsey quickly pushed the drink away from the blonde and reaching up again, she pulled Alyssa down off the table and over her shoulder firemen style. Turning, she roughly pushed her way through the crowd, her stride and demeanor dared anyone to stop her. Even carrying the weight this way, was a struggle for the strong woman, but she kept moving until the fresh air hit her in the face and she bean to hear Alyssa moaning. Quickly setting Alyssa on her feet, she followed the blonde as she ran for the rail, and almost climbing over it in her attempt to litter the high seas. Kelsey held on to Alyssa so that she wouldn't fall overboard and waited until the woman could on her own on the deck.</p>
		<p>"Feeling better?" Kelsey asked sarcastically, keeping her arm around the woman's waist to steady her.</p>
		<p>"Just peachy!" Alyssa responded snidely to Kelsey's tone of voice wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.</p>
		<p>"Good, because you are going to feel a lot worse come morning." Kelsey replied dryly and began leading the blonde back toward their cabin.</p>
		<p>Alyssa didn't feel like commenting on Kelsey's humor and stumbled along until they reached the cabin where she quickly threw herself down on her bed.</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't do....." Kelsey called out to the prone woman. Alyssa lay still for only a few moments before jumping up and running to the bathroom.</p>
		<p>"...that." Kelsey shook her head and began to get changed for bed. After about twenty minutes and no sign of Alyssa, she went into the bathroom to find the woman sitting on the floor sound asleep with her head resting against the vanity.</p>
		<p>Leaning down, she lightly shook Alyssa and grasped her by her arms in an effort to pull her to her feet. "Come on, time to get into bed."</p>
		<p>"No, this is good!" Alyssa slurred sleepily. "I like it here."</p>
		<p>"Come on...I promise you will like it better in bed." Kelsey replied and tugged the woman to stand and steadied her by grabbing on to her belt in back, and began directing Alyssa back toward the bedroom.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah...I will?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I promise." Kelsey replied as she fought to maneuver the tottering woman through the narrow bathroom door without sending both of them down onto the floor in a heap.</p>
		<p>"With you?" The garbled response caused Kelsey to stumble and almost drop the young woman. She stopped dead in her tracks and she looked down at Alyssa, whose eyes were still closed in a dreamy haze of alcohol induced sleep. Kelsey knew that if Alyssa actually knew what she was saying she would definitely be embarrassed. Thinking about it, a mischievous smile crossed her lips and she figured paybacks were in order.</p>
		<p>"Is that what you would like?"</p>
		<p>"Will you be nicer to me or mean like you have been?" Alyssa's voice was raspy and slurred, but her words cut through to Kelsey's heart. She hadn't really been very nice to the woman and it wasn't entirely Alyssa's fault. She didn't understand why she touched off this spark of anger either. </p>
		<p>"Yes, I will." Kelsey murmured without realizing she was actually speaking the words outloud.</p>
		<p>"Good...then oh yes, that's exactly what I want!" Alyssa's voice sang out loudly as she tried to propel herself forward toward the bed and only succeeded in stumbling and almost falling. Kelsey grabbed her and held her tightly against her as she tied to get Alyssa to the bed without dropping her. Kelsey was beginning to feel guilty about the conversation and decided to stop it right here. Finally, getting her positioned next to the bed, Kelsey let Alyssa fall backward onto the bed.</p>
		<p>"Well, why don't you get some sleep and ask me again tomorrow." Kelsey removed the woman's shoes and lifted her legs onto the bed.</p>
		<p>"Chicken!" Alyssa giggled and was sound asleep before Kelsey pull the covers over her.</p>
		<p>"You got that right!" Kelsey murmured and turned to get into her own bed. Sleep did not come as easily for Kelsey as she lay listening to the light snoring of her roommate. Finally, her mind was so exhausted from tormenting itself that she fell into asleep to the rhythm of Alyssa's heavy breathing.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 6">
		<p>Alyssa was rudely awaken to the sound of two short, but very loud, blasts of the ship horn and sat up quickly. Instantly regretting this action, she fell backwards on to the bed with a thud. "Oh....My....God!" she moaned.</p>
		<p>"Good morning Ms. Party Animal!" Kelsey's voice sang out wryly. "And how are we feeling today."</p>
		<p>"Just shoot me now!" Alyssa's voice was a thick plea from beneath the pillow she had pulled over her face to block the world. Her head was playing a tune that only her stomach seemed to understand and she wished they would both just be quiet this morning.</p>
		<p>Kelsey leaned down and lifted the pillow slightly watching Alyssa's eyelids clench tighter as the sunlight hit them. "Unh-uh, that nice little horn you just heard was the warning that the passengers will be boarding in an hour. You have approximately 30 minutes to get to your duty station. So, I 'd get hopping into the shower if I were you." Kelsey let the pillow unceremoniously drop back down and turned to tie her shoelace. Alyssa had a clear view of a long tanned leg attached to the foot that rested on the other bed. Following the long leg upward, she noticed that her roommate was dressed in what must be her working uniform of navy shorts and a white polo shirt with the cruise line emblem on it. </p>
		<p>Alyssa moaned more at where her mind seemed to be wandering than at the banging that was going on in her head. Slowly she sat up contemplating her distress. Kelsey pick up her agenda and notebook and turned toward the noise, she wondered if maybe the woman wasn't going to be able to handle the after effects of last night afterall.</p>
		<p>"Are you going to be okay?"</p>
		<p>"Just ducky! I think I need a cold shower!" Alyssa replied trying to smile to offset the sharpness of her words. Her stomach was doing a fast dance in time to the pounding in her head and the flush that accompanied her new thoughts was not helping the situation.</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't take a cold one...unless you love shocking your system to death. I usually reserve that pleasure for the coffee they serve in the ODR." Kelsey chuckled and turned toward the door to leave. Alyssa would be okay, definitely hurting, but the wiser for her misery.</p>
		<p>Alyssa sat on the edge of the bed with her head bowed wishing Kelsey would hurry up and leave so that she could be sick with a modicum of dignity, but if the woman didn't hurry, this was not going to be the case.</p>
		<p>"Good luck today!" Kelsey called out as she opened the door and closed it softly. Chuckling at the sight of her roommate, she made her way down the hall toward the Officer's Dining Room.</p>
		<p>The door slammed loudly and Alyssa was up and running to the bathroom to make good on her prediction. <i>'Oh, God and they call this fun! I think I can do without all this excitement in my life!'</i> After a few minutes of rest, she rose to her feet shaky and she turned the water on and stripped for her shower. Alyssa let the warm water run down her body until she felt reasonable human and finished her shower. Dressed and ready for duty, she looked in the mirror and marveled at how the uniform made her look more mature and confident. <i>'Amazing what a uniform will do for your morale!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa spent the majority of the morning working alongside the Chief Purser until it was time for the Passenger Orientation in the Lido Lounge. She sat with her group to the side of the stage and noticed Kelsey sitting on the other side of the podium talking with a striking blonde. She briefly wondered who the woman was, but was soon distracted by the audience that filled the room. The passengers were excited and impatiently waiting to get this mandatory orientation over so that they could start their vacations. There were only two mandatory meetings for the passengers, this one and the lifeboat drill, which would happen later that day. The room soon hushed as the Cruise Director took the stage and introduced himself. He did his usual welcoming bit and then began introducing his staff. As the introductions went along, Alyssa soon found out that the striking blonde was the Sports Director and also Kelsey's boss. The woman spoke briefly before introducing Kelsey. As the tall raven-haired woman took the stage, Alyssa noted how beautiful she actually was as applause and whistling from the audience followed her introduction. She was obviously a favorite with the passengers, many of whom seemed to know her. She waved to a couple of them and took over the microphone, describing the activities available and telling a few anecdotes that had the audience relaxed and enjoying themselves. The woman was obviously was suited for her job and Alyssa was amazed at how personable her roommate could be thinking, <i>"yeah, too bad she wasn't more personable to me!'</i></p>
		<p>When it came time for her own introduction, Alyssa just stood and smiled at the audience until she heard a loud wolf-whistle from the back of the room. Embarrassed, she looked to the back and saw Karen standing behind the bar smiling innocently. She looked down at feet as she felt the heat rise up her face and looked back up to find two very blue and very serious eyes staring at her from across the room. Not liking the feeling she was getting from the look, she returned her focus on the floor for the remainder of the orientation and fretted. <i>'What did I do?</i> <i>Why did I get that look? I didn't ask Karen to do that! Damn, what's her problem anyway?'</i></p>
		<p>The Orientation was finally complete and Alyssa went back to her duties. She didn't finish until almost 11 PM and gratefully made her way back to the cabin. She hadn't even wanted to think about eating anything but aspirin the entire day. Feeling nauseous and closed in, she felt the need to get some air and took a walk around the deck, but found herself continually stopped by passengers asking if she could help them cash travelers checks at that late hour. Finally, tired of saying no and apologizing, she headed out to the top deck up to the bow of the ship where the winds were the strongest. It was quiet up here as most of the passengers preferred the gentle winds from the sheltered lower decks, but Alyssa like the way the rough breeze whipped her hair back and smelled strongly of the sea. She went as far forward as she could and leaned against the rail looking up at the multitude of stars in the sky. She could hear the slap of water as the ship parted the seas before them. She looked down over the rail to watch as the bow cleanly sliced through the dark waters. For no particular reason she began to think of her mother and felt a bit homesick. She missed being able to tell her mother about all that had been going on and what she was doing. She didn't really miss her brothers or father in the slightest because they represented the oppression that she was trying to escape. Her mother was different. She had always been the one to praise and encourage her in whatever endeavor she chose. Alyssa also know that it was due to her mother's efforts that she had been allowed to do some of the things she had, like college and taking this job. Her father would have rather she just settle down and get married or continuing working at the library, but Alyssa had wanted so much more out of life. </p>
		<p>"You aren't going to jump already are you?" Alyssa started when she heard the deep voice behind her until she recognized its familiarity and turned to see Kelsey sitting in a deck chair in the shadow of a smokestack.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was up here. I hope I didn't disturb you." Alyssa hesitated moving as the woman stood and began approaching her. She wasn't sure what personality she would encounter this evening. The woman was so confusing, one moment she was helpful and the next angry with her for some unknown reason. She'd be darn if she could ever figure her out.</p>
		<p>"No, I don't own the space, I just come up here to enjoy the view." Kelsey instantly wished she hadn't been so flippant with that remark but, it was said and, she couldn't take it back. Alyssa fell silent unsure of how to respond to the woman and just kept looking out over the star filled night.</p>
		<p>"See that? That's the North Star, it's the brightest one so sailors use it to navigate by." Kelsey wasn't sure why she was giving the blonde an astrology lesson, but just felt the need to slow down and break the ice.</p>
		<p>"Then what about that one, it's just as bright?" Alyssa pointed to another light in the sky and heard a soft chuckle from next to her.</p>
		<p>"That's a plane. If you watch it long enough, you will see that it moves."</p>
		<p>Alyssa strained to watch it and sure enough, it moved. "Wow! I never realized you could see planes way out here."</p>
		<p>'You'd be surprised what you can see on a clear night." </p>
		<p>The two women fell silent again, Alyssa trying to think of something to say that didn't sound stupid and Kelsey debating how she should approach the issue of Karen and her little buddies. Finally, Kelsey just took the bull by the horns and started talking frankly.</p>
		<p>"I need to tell you something and as your senior officer, its kind of my job to do it. This is your first cruise and well, things aren't always the way they seem. We are all thrown together for a long time, in close quarters, and it's easy to misconstrue feelings and friendships. I think you need to be careful with the people you associate with on the ship. They aren't always what they appear to be." Kelsey tried to explain things without really mentioning any names and realized that it wasn't coming out the way she had intended.</p>
		<p>Alyssa almost thought that Kelsey had known some of her thoughts earlier that morning, but soon realized she was talking about Karen. At first she felt shunned when she thought Kelsey was talking about her and then when she realized that wasn't the case, she felt the familiar walls of constraint and recrimination that she would get from her family and it rubbed her the wrong way. These all added up to her taking offense to everything and answered her roommate a little too hastily and harshly. "If you mean earlier today, I had no control over that situation. As for my friends and the other night, it wasn't their fault that I didn't watch how much I was drinking. I think I'm old enough to take care of myself right now and I take full responsibility for what happened. Does being senior officer give you the right to tell me who can and can't be my friends?" Alyssa bit her tongue on the last barb and couldn't believe she had actually said it. But, when she let her fear and anger, take control of her brain and it had always spelled disaster for her and this time was no exception.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's eyes narrowed at the backlash she was receiving after trying to help Alyssa. "As your senior officer it is my duty to help you become adjusted to life aboard this ship and to show you the ropes. I have neither the time, nor desire to play nursemaid to anyone. And just for the record, it is frowned upon for junior officers to socialize with crewmembers during duty hours. What you do on your own time or between cruises is no concern of mine. As far as I'm concerned this conversation is over and my job where you are concerned is done. You are on your own, I hope you enjoy the company!" Kelsey let everything go and even said more than she had realized she was thinking. Taking a step back she almost apologized, but instead, turned on her heals and walked away.</p>
		<p>Alyssa stood stunned watching the tall woman walk away from her. She wasn't sure where that all came from, but she knew that most of it she deserved. The last barb had hit home and it made her feel more alone than she had felt in a long while. She stood looking out over the rail for a long while contemplating what to do and kicking herself for being such a jerk. Now, she had a roommate who hated her. <i>'Why didn't she just keep her mouth shut and let things go!</i>' Because she was tired of always giving in and letting everyone else have control. She needed to make a stand, but she didn't need to stand on top of the person trying to help her. Shaking her head sadly, she made her way to the cabin and was relieved, but secretly disappointed, to find Kelsey had not returned to the cabin. Tired, she stripped and climbed into bed falling instantly to sleep. She slept so deeply that she didn't hear Kelsey come in an hour later. Kelsey had purposely gone to her office and stewed over the events of the evening. She could have handled the situation better, but somehow, the blonde's rebuff had hurt and she had reacted emotionally instead of using her head. But if Alyssa didn't want her help then, Kelsey wouldn't bother her anymore. Slipping into bed she tossed and turned until dawn and finally gave up and took a shower. She was dressed and walking into the Officer's Dining Room as Alyssa's alarm sounded.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter 7">
		<p>Kelsey purposely stayed away from the cabin when she knew that Alyssa would be there, coming in late every evening after the woman was already asleep and leaving the cabin early before she woke up. She had thought, if nothing else, her warning had gotten through when she noticed that Alyssa had steered clear of Karen and her bunch until today, when she saw Karen hand the blonde a note which she read and nodded an affirmative reply. Today was the first Port of Call stop in St. Martaan and Kelsey knew that Alyssa was free in the afternoon to go into town with her friends. Kelsey had a sinking feeling that was exactly what the group had planned. She also knew exactly where they would take Alyssa during her first excursion. There were two sides to the island, the French and the Dutch. She knew the group would head to their usual hangout on the French side where the beaches were a bit more colorful, to say the least. </p>
		<p>Finishing her duties, Alyssa hurried back to the cabin to change. She was excited about her first excursion into town. She had never been out of her own state before, let alone to a new country. She was thrilled when Karen had invited her to join them for a beach party. She put her bathing suit on under her shorts and tank top and grabbed her bag with a change of towel and long sleeve shirt, and ran down the corridor toward the launches. Karen, Pam and another woman were waiting for her at the gangway and they boarded the tenders to shore. Climbing toward the back of the launch, Alyssa didn't notice Kelsey until she was seated and the vessel was underway. Kelsey looked briefly at her and then turned away to look out over the water. Alyssa felt a pang of regret, but quickly pushed it down and turned to the group that was already laughing and carrying on.</p>
		<p>As expected, Kelsey saw Alyssa board the tender along with Karen and her usual entourage. She tried not to stare, but caught the blonde's eye briefly before looking away. She kept her eyes focused on the shore until they boat docked and they were going ashore. She could see that Alyssa wore her bathing suit under her khaki shorts and white tank top, and it confirmed her suspicion of exactly where the group was headed as they boarded their bus. As much as she hated to, Kelsey turned and boarded the bus heading in the opposite direction. She just hoped that Alyssa knew what she was doing and would be all right. Kelsey spent the two hours going through the shops and having lunch. Finally, bored with her solo excursion, she headed back toward the ship. She went directly to the cabin and showered and changed before going down to her office to check on things. It was dinnertime and growing dark and Alyssa had yet to return to the ship. The last launches left the island at 7 PM and it was 6 PM already. Kelsey made her way to the deck above the launch docking and looked down at the passengers disembarking and noticed Karen and the other two women, but no Alyssa. She scanned the group and wondered if she had missed the blonde earlier. Heading back down to the cabin, she still found it empty with no sign of her roommate. </p>
		<p>"She's a big girl and can take care of herself. It is not your responsibility to watch every step she takes. She is probably down in one of the crew cabins thumbing her nose up at regulations!" Kelsey paced the cabin talking to herself and reminding her self to stay uninvolved. "You don't need this kind of trouble. Things are just starting to go smoothly and you don't need to get yourself involved with anyone!"</p>
		<p>After a few moments of self-incrimination and berating she spat out, "Bite me!" and went out of the cabin down to the crew's lounge where she found Karen and her crew still partying.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me, have you seen Alyssa?" Kelsey stood her whole 5'10" above the group with her hands on her hips and a no bullshit look on her face. Karen looked up and smiled, but somehow the smile didn't look very receptive.</p>
		<p>"Well, let's see...." Karen drawled in her English accent while a smattering of nervous giggles could be heard from one of the other women with Pam. "You could say we all saw her!" Karen broke out into laughter at that comment and it set Kelsey's blood boiling. She picked up Karen by the collar and pulled her out of her seat sending the chair flying backwards.</p>
		<p>"What did you assholes do to her?" Kelsey's blue eyes were almost black, but Karen was just drunk enough to stupidly see it as a challenge.</p>
		<p>"What the hell is it to you...you don't have exclusive rights to her...or do you?" Karen was grinning and looking over at her friend and winked. "Didn't seem so today, did it Pam?"</p>
		<p>Before anyone had an idea or thought process to answer the question, Kelsey had Karen up against the wall and was definitely 'in her face'. "I'm going to ask you one more time. Where is Alyssa?"</p>
		<p>Karen sobered at the intensity of Kelsey's actions and knew she was playing games with the wrong woman. Her stomach knotted, but she wasn't about to let her friends see her back down to anyone. "How the hell should I know! We were having a party and she split!"</p>
		<p>Kelsey tightened her grip on Karen's shirt and looked Pam directly in the eye. "Is that all?" The woman paled visibly and replied, "We didn't see her when it was time to come back to the ship. I don't think she's come back yet."</p>
		<p>"Damn!" Kelsey swore under her breath and pushed Karen back against the wall and hurried from the room to the launch area. She was at the gangway when she heard someone calling her name and turned to see Pam running toward her.</p>
		<p>"Wait!"</p>
		<p>"What? I don't have time right now!" Kelsey was angry and was ready to throw someone over the side, it didn't really matter whom at this point.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I just want you to know that I tried to stop what was going on, but I was outvoted. We were at the beach sunbathing, you know the nude one.....and everyone was partying and drinking and Karen was trying to get Alyssa drunk again and succeeded in getting her to loosen up enough to go topless. She seemed to be having fun so I didn't think too much of it and then I went with Kellie to get more beer. When I got back, I could tell that Alyssa was upset, she had put her top back on, but I knew something had happened. Karen acted like nothing was going on, I tried to talk to Alyssa but she wouldn't say anything. We were sitting having another beer when the bus pulled up at the stop and Alyssa just jumped up and grabbed her bag and ran for it. I tried to go after her, but Karen said to let her go and I'm sorry, but I did." </p>
		<p>Kelsey watched the woman look away regretfully, but it didn't matter to the tall woman, she was seeing red about that time. "So, you just let her go because Karen told you to? My God woman, don't you have a brain? I don't know what happened, but you can rest assured I'm going to find out and if any of you have done anything to Alyssa....you all had better start growing wings, because someone's leaving this ship without benefit of a ride!" Kelsey turned and walked down the gangway and took a seat. She was only one of two passengers headed back to the island. The crewmembers had been listening to the entire conversation and looked at Kelsey worriedly.</p>
		<p>"Let's go!" She barked and they quickly launched the tender back to shore without comment. </p>
		<p>Kelsey jumped from the boat before it had even been secured and headed down toward town where the buses unloaded. She wasn't sure where to even start looking when she saw blonde hair walking up the street slowly, her head bend looking down at the sidewalk and not where she was going. Kelsey stopped and waited for the woman to reach her without moving or saying a word. Alyssa almost bumped into Kelsey when she realized someone was in front of her looking up and seeing familiar blue eyes was all it took unhinge the blonde and she pushed the tall woman away crying.</p>
		<p>"Well, go ahead! Say it! 'I told you so'!" Alyssa's eyes were red from crying as she spat the words out with a vengeance.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I came looking for you because I was worried, not to reprimand you!" Kelsey tried to keep her voice even to calm Alyssa down.</p>
		<p>"Well, don't worry! I can take care of myself!" Alyssa moved past Kelsey and began walking down the street, this time with a purpose.</p>
		<p>Kelsey turned and in two quick strides had caught up to the woman's shorter legs. "Why are you mad at me...I'm not the one who hurt you!"</p>
		<p>Alyssa stopped dead and swung around to face the taller woman, "Who said anyone hurt me? Is that what they said? What did they tell you?"</p>
		<p>"Easy!" Kelsey replied and grabbed Alyssa by the arm to stop her. This turned out to be a mistake and Alyssa pulled back quickly whispering through gritted teeth, "Don't touch me!"</p>
		<p>"Okay! I won't touch you, but slow down for a moment and talk to me. What the hell happened today?" Kelsey waited for a response from Alyssa, but all the blonde did was turn and begin walking back toward the boats. </p>
		<p>"Alyssa?"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk about it. Nothing happened." Alyssa threw over her shoulder and picked up her pace. Kelsey kept right along side easily and kept pushing the issue. "If nothing happened, why are you so angry and why are you out here alone?"</p>
		<p>"What do you need to hear it? Okay, you were right! They weren't nice to me and they aren't my friends, okay! I was just the butt of someone's joke. Does that make you feel any better?" Kelsey could see that there was no reasoning with the woman and just pushed her to board the launch back to town.</p>
		<p>"No, it doesn't make me feel better in the least." Kelsey whispered under her breath and sat down opposite Alyssa and didn't say anything more. The ride back was in done in silence and when they re-boarded the cruise ship Kelsey walked Alyssa back to the cabin and then went in search of some answers.</p>
		<p>Alyssa was glad when Kelsey left, she wasn't in the mood to relive the afternoon's events. It had been Alyssa's first experience at a nude beach and between the beer and the encouragement from the other woman, she had stripped off her top along with the rest of them. It was a wild but exciting experience for her. She had been careful not to drink as much as she had the other night and was feeling slightly buzzed, but no worse. Pam and Kellie left to get more beer, leaving Karen and herself alone on the beach. They group had settled away from the other bathers and Alyssa had been relieved early with the privacy. It wasn't long before she felt a shadow over her and opened her eyes to see Karen leaning over her. Before she could say anything Karen's lips had descended upon hers and she was trying to deepen the kiss. Alyssa hadn't fought the new sensation until Karen's hand began to pinch and roll her nipple hard. It hurt and when Alyssa tried to push Karen off, Karen increased the intensity of the kiss. Finally, pushing Karen away, she sat up breathlessly and grabbed for her top. Struggling into it, Karen watched laughing and remarked, "Oh my God! You're a virgin! Jeez, what are you doing saving yourself for Kelsey? Well, forget it honey...she ain't interested in your type!"</p>
		<p>Alyssa didn't answer, but she could feel her face growing red. Karen continued laughing and when the others had returned she was afraid that Karen would say something and they all would be laughing. As the conversation went on, the tension was building and Alyssa was sure that every time Karen opened her mouth she was about to ridicule her in front of everyone. When Pam asked her if she was all right, she tried to ignore the comment in hopes that Karen hadn't heard it either. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore and when she saw the bus pull up, she just grabbed her things and ran. She didn't care where it was headed as long as it was away from that group. She road around the island the remainder of the day crying and berating herself for being so blind and stupid. What she couldn't explain was the fact that, at first, the kiss hadn't bothered her. It wasn't until Karen had added pain to the sensation that she had reacted against it and Karen. By the end of the day, she was tired, confused and headed back toward the cruise ship wondering just what did Karen meant by, "not interested in my type". Was it women, or me in general? It saddened her to think that it would be either. When she had seen Kelsey and knew she had been looking for her, she had exploded and all her fears had come to the surface. She struck first before she allowed anyone else to hurt her again.</p>
		<p>Alyssa stepped out of shower and dressed for bed, still relieved that Kelsey hadn't come back. Maybe she just didn't want to be with her right now. Whatever, the reason it didn't matter, Alyssa curled up into her bed and made a promise that she wouldn't get involved with anyone, not even as a friend. She would do her job and stay strictly to herself. She fell asleep thinking, '<i>it didn't matter what she did or where she went, nothing would ever change for her. There must be something wrong with me.'</i></p>

		<p>As expected, Kelsey saw Alyssa board the tender along with Karen and her usual entourage. She tried not to stare, but caught the blonde's eye briefly before looking away. She kept her eyes focused on the shore until they boat docked and they were going ashore. She could see that Alyssa wore her bathing suit under her khaki shorts and white tank top, and it confirmed her suspicion of exactly where the group was headed as they boarded their bus. As much as she hated to, Kelsey turned and boarded the bus heading in the opposite direction. She just hoped that Alyssa knew what she was doing and would be all right. Kelsey spent the two hours going through the shops and having lunch. Finally, bored with her solo excursion, she headed back toward the ship. She went directly to the cabin and showered and changed before going down to her office to check on things. It was dinnertime and growing dark and Alyssa had yet to return to the ship. The last launches left the island at 7 PM and it was 6 PM already. Kelsey made her way to the deck above the launch docking and looked down at the passengers disembarking and noticed Karen and the other two women, but no Alyssa. She scanned the group and wondered if she had missed the blonde earlier. Heading back down to the cabin, she still found it empty with no sign of her roommate. </p>
		<p>"She's a big girl and can take care of herself. It is not your responsibility to watch every step she takes. She is probably down in one of the crew cabins thumbing her nose up at regulations!" Kelsey paced the cabin talking to herself and reminding her self to stay uninvolved. "You don't need this kind of trouble. Things are just starting to go smoothly and you don't need to get yourself involved with anyone!"</p>
		<p>After a few moments of self-incrimination and berating she spat out, "Bite me!" and went out of the cabin down to the crew's lounge where she found Karen and her crew still partying.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me, have you seen Alyssa?" Kelsey stood her whole 5'10" above the group with her hands on her hips and a no bullshit look on her face. Karen looked up and smiled, but somehow the smile didn't look very receptive.</p>
		<p>"Well, let's see...." Karen drawled in her English accent while a smattering of nervous giggles could be heard from one of the other women with Pam. "You could say we all saw her!" Karen broke out into laughter at that comment and it set Kelsey's blood boiling. She picked up Karen by the collar and pulled her out of her seat sending the chair flying backwards.</p>
		<p>"What did you assholes do to her?" Kelsey's blue eyes were almost black, but Karen was just drunk enough to stupidly see it as a challenge.</p>
		<p>"What the hell is it to you...you don't have exclusive rights to her...or do you?" Karen was grinning and looking over at her friend and winked. "Didn't seem so today, did it Pam?"</p>
		<p>Before anyone had an idea or thought process to answer the question, Kelsey had Karen up against the wall and was definitely 'in her face'. "I'm going to ask you one more time. Where is Alyssa?"</p>
		<p>Karen sobered at the intensity of Kelsey's actions and knew she was playing games with the wrong woman. Her stomach knotted, but she wasn't about to let her friends see her back down to anyone. "How the hell should I know! We were having a party and she split!"</p>
		<p>Kelsey tightened her grip on Karen's shirt and looked Pam directly in the eye. "Is that all?" The woman paled visibly and replied, "We didn't see her when it was time to come back to the ship. I don't think she's come back yet."</p>
		<p>"Damn!" Kelsey swore under her breath and pushed Karen back against the wall and hurried from the room to the launch area. She was at the gangway when she heard someone calling her name and turned to see Pam running toward her.</p>
		<p>"Wait!"</p>
		<p>"What? I don't have time right now!" Kelsey was angry and was ready to throw someone over the side, it didn't really matter whom at this point.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I just want you to know that I tried to stop what was going on, but I was outvoted. We were at the beach sunbathing, you know the nude one.....and everyone was partying and drinking and Karen was trying to get Alyssa drunk again and succeeded in getting her to loosen up enough to go topless. She seemed to be having fun so I didn't think too much of it and then I went with Kellie to get more beer. When I got back, I could tell that Alyssa was upset, she had put her top back on, but I knew something had happened. Karen acted like nothing was going on, I tried to talk to Alyssa but she wouldn't say anything. We were sitting having another beer when the bus pulled up at the stop and Alyssa just jumped up and grabbed her bag and ran for it. I tried to go after her, but Karen said to let her go and I'm sorry, but I did." </p>
		<p>Kelsey watched the woman look away regretfully, but it didn't matter to the tall woman, she was seeing red about that time. "So, you just let her go because Karen told you to? My God woman, don't you have a brain? I don't know what happened, but you can rest assured I'm going to find out and if any of you have done anything to Alyssa....you all had better start growing wings, because someone's leaving this ship without benefit of a ride!" Kelsey turned and walked down the gangway and took a seat. She was only one of two passengers headed back to the island. The crewmembers had been listening to the entire conversation and looked at Kelsey worriedly.</p>
		<p>"Let's go!" She barked and they quickly launched the tender back to shore without comment. </p>
		<p>Kelsey jumped from the boat before it had even been secured and headed down toward town where the buses unloaded. She wasn't sure where to even start looking when she saw blonde hair walking up the street slowly, her head bend looking down at the sidewalk and not where she was going. Kelsey stopped and waited for the woman to reach her without moving or saying a word. Alyssa almost bumped into Kelsey when she realized someone was in front of her looking up and seeing familiar blue eyes was all it took unhinge the blonde and she pushed the tall woman away crying.</p>
		<p>"Well, go ahead! Say it! 'I told you so'!" Alyssa's eyes were red from crying as she spat the words out with a vengeance.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I came looking for you because I was worried, not to reprimand you!" Kelsey tried to keep her voice even to calm Alyssa down.</p>
		<p>"Well, don't worry! I can take care of myself!" Alyssa moved past Kelsey and began walking down the street, this time with a purpose.</p>
		<p>Kelsey turned and in two quick strides had caught up to the woman's shorter legs. "Why are you mad at me...I'm not the one who hurt you!"</p>
		<p>Alyssa stopped dead and swung around to face the taller woman, "Who said anyone hurt me? Is that what they said? What did they tell you?"</p>
		<p>"Easy!" Kelsey replied and grabbed Alyssa by the arm to stop her. This turned out to be a mistake and Alyssa pulled back quickly whispering through gritted teeth, "Don't touch me!"</p>
		<p>"Okay! I won't touch you, but slow down for a moment and talk to me. What the hell happened today?" Kelsey waited for a response from Alyssa, but all the blonde did was turn and begin walking back toward the boats. </p>
		<p>"Alyssa?"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk about it. Nothing happened." Alyssa threw over her shoulder and picked up her pace. Kelsey kept right along side easily and kept pushing the issue. "If nothing happened, why are you so angry and why are you out here alone?"</p>
		<p>"What do you need to hear it? Okay, you were right! They weren't nice to me and they aren't my friends, okay! I was just the butt of someone's joke. Does that make you feel any better?" Kelsey could see that there was no reasoning with the woman and just pushed her to board the launch back to town.</p>
		<p>"No, it doesn't make me feel better in the least." Kelsey whispered under her breath and sat down opposite Alyssa and didn't say anything more. The ride back was in done in silence and when they re-boarded the cruise ship Kelsey walked Alyssa back to the cabin and then went in search of some answers.</p>
		<p>Alyssa was glad when Kelsey left, she wasn't in the mood to relive the afternoon's events. It had been Alyssa's first experience at a nude beach and between the beer and the encouragement from the other woman, she had stripped off her top along with the rest of them. It was a wild but exciting experience for her. She had been careful not to drink as much as she had the other night and was feeling slightly buzzed, but no worse. Pam and Kellie left to get more beer, leaving Karen and herself alone on the beach. They group had settled away from the other bathers and Alyssa had been relieved early with the privacy. It wasn't long before she felt a shadow over her and opened her eyes to see Karen leaning over her. Before she could say anything Karen's lips had descended upon hers and she was trying to deepen the kiss. Alyssa hadn't fought the new sensation until Karen's hand began to pinch and roll her nipple hard. It hurt and when Alyssa tried to push Karen off, Karen increased the intensity of the kiss. Finally, pushing Karen away, she sat up breathlessly and grabbed for her top. Struggling into it, Karen watched laughing and remarked, "Oh my God! You're a virgin! Jeez, what are you doing saving yourself for Kelsey? Well, forget it honey...she ain't interested in your type!"</p>
		<p>Alyssa didn't answer, but she could feel her face growing red. Karen continued laughing and when the others had returned she was afraid that Karen would say something and they all would be laughing. As the conversation went on, the tension was building and Alyssa was sure that every time Karen opened her mouth she was about to ridicule her in front of everyone. When Pam asked her if she was all right, she tried to ignore the comment in hopes that Karen hadn't heard it either. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore and when she saw the bus pull up, she just grabbed her things and ran. She didn't care where it was headed as long as it was away from that group. She road around the island the remainder of the day crying and berating herself for being so blind and stupid. What she couldn't explain was the fact that, at first, the kiss hadn't bothered her. It wasn't until Karen had added pain to the sensation that she had reacted against it and Karen. By the end of the day, she was tired, confused and headed back toward the cruise ship wondering just what did Karen meant by, "not interested in my type". Was it women, or me in general? It saddened her to think that it would be either. When she had seen Kelsey and knew she had been looking for her, she had exploded and all her fears had come to the surface. She struck first before she allowed anyone else to hurt her again.</p>
		<p>Alyssa stepped out of shower and dressed for bed, still relieved that Kelsey hadn't come back. Maybe she just didn't want to be with her right now. Whatever, the reason it didn't matter, Alyssa curled up into her bed and made a promise that she wouldn't get involved with anyone, not even as a friend. She would do her job and stay strictly to herself. She fell asleep thinking, '<i>it didn't matter what she did or where she went, nothing would ever change for her. There must be something wrong with me.'</i></p>

	<chapter title="Chapter 9">
		<p>Kelsey found Karen, as usual, in the staff lounge with her friends. She noted right off that they were not drinking and were huddled together talking. The room was fairly crowded noisy, but as soon as Kelsey stepped through the doorway, all conversations quieted and everyone watched her as she walked directly toward Karen. Karen looked up cockily, but Kelsey saw her flinch when she got close and knew that she had her attention. Kelsey calmly sat down at the table with the three women, when Pam attempted to get up and leave, Kelsey leveled her a look and quietly said, "Sit down!" Pam response was to drop back down in her seat and look back at the tall women in fear.</p>
		<p>Turning her attention back toward Karen, Kelsey moved her chair closer to the woman in an attempt to intimidate her and she would tell by the woman's demeanor that it was working. "Now, that I have your attention, I want to know exactly what happened on the beach today! Don't get smart with me either because I'm in no damn mood right now!"</p>
		<p>Karen just looked at Kelsey and didn't respond, but Kelsey could see that she was gearing up for a full-blown battle and wasn't about to be very cooperative. "Who the bloody hell do you think you are strolling in here and demanding anything from me!" Karen's voice was loud enough for the entire room to hear clearly and all talking stopped as their attention was on the table in the corner.</p>
		<p>Kelsey leaned forward a little more and kept her voice at an even timbre, but there was no mistaking her anger. "I'm not looking for a fight, but if you want trouble, I'll be your worst nightmare! That's who I am!" </p>
		<p>Karen laugh was more like a sharp bark. "Let me tell you something, Miss High and Mighty! Your little girlfriend was flaunting herself all day on the beach and when someone called her bluff, she panicked." </p>
		<p>"Let's get one thing straight. She is my roommate and assignee, not my girlfriend. I'm here as a senior officer, to find out what happened. I have no personal stake in this at all!" Kelsey's patience was beginning to quickly drain away and she wanted nothing more than to remove that smug look from off Karen's face. She looked at the blonde and held her breath as she saw a malicious look cross her face.</p>
		<p>"Yeah right! You must be losing your touch to let a virgin get away from you, or is that what you are so mad about?" Karen stood up laughing and challenging Kelsey's patience to the max. "That's it! You think I got there ahead of you and you're pissed!"</p>
		<p>Kelsey stood up and towered slightly above the other woman. "What the hell is it with you? Does every woman you meet have to be a conquest for you?"</p>
		<p>"Look whose talking!" Karen looked around Kelsey to the group at the table and shrugged her shoulders. "I'd say that's calling the kettle black."</p>
		<p>Kelsey realized that she was not going to get anywhere with Karen, except make a scene, which is exactly what the woman seemed to want. Kelsey just shook her head sadly at Karen. "You really are one sorry excuse for a woman. I feel pity for you." Kelsey looked at the women at the table to let them know that she included them in the same statement. The other two women looked away sadly and Kelsey almost felt sorry for them, but it was their choice to be friends with Karen, no one had forced them into the situation.</p>
		<p>"You pity me? I pity you...you've got your work cut out for you with your girlfriend. She doesn't know what the hell she wants, but I will say, she is a fairly decent kisser and she really has nice tits!" Karen smiled smugly and cupped her hands making a gesture to let Kelsey know that she had first hand physical knowledge of both of these facts.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's anger was hotter than she could remember it being in a long time and didn't like the way she was feeling. She didn't need this hassle, nor did she think that she should feel this strongly about the situation. She hated Karen and everything that women like her stood for, but that was no reason to get into a fight. With her hands clenched in to fists at her side, she stiffly turned and began walking away until she heard something whispered loudly behind her that sent her over the edge.</p>
		<p>"Too right! Perky little tits they were too! I tell you, I had my hands on them and she was beginning to respond nicely...half a chance and I could have had her singing my praises!" Neither of the women were looking at Karen as she talked to them, all attention was focused on Kelsey's response. Karen had gone too far this time, and they both knew it. They were quickly becoming ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with the woman, she had never really acted this badly in front of everyone before. They both knew that she hated Kelsey because since the woman had joined the crew, Karen had tried everything to get Kelsey to notice her and she had flatly refused and never hid her feelings of dislike for the blonde. This had been a bone of contention for the past three years and now, it was going to a head, a nasty one for sure. </p>
		<p>No one expected Kelsey to do what she did, but afterward, they had to admit that it was the perfect reply. Kelsey turned around and just backhanded Karen across the face. Karen fell backward into her chair from the full effect of the blow. Kelsey's voice was razor sharp and there was no mistaking what she was saying. "If I ever see you near Alyssa or hear you speak of her or any other woman in that manner, I will personally tear you apart. I suggest you go back to your cabin and start packing because before I'm through, you will have one-way ticket back to England! We don't need your kind aboard this ship!" Kelsey spun on her heels leaving Karen sitting surprised and dazed holding the side of her face. A few cheers were called out to Kelsey and she walked out and Pam and Kellie quickly got up and followed her out the door. They weren't about to lose their jobs for Karen or anyone else for that matter. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 10">
		<p>Kelsey opened the cabin door to darkness and tiptoed to the bathroom. Closing the door halfway, she flipped on the light and used it as a nightlight to see in the main cabin. Kelsey walked over to Alyssa's bed and saw that the woman was sound asleep. In sleep, Alyssa's face was unmarred by the events of the day and she looked at peace, but the box of half-empty tissues on the nightstand told another story. <i>'Damn it, why couldn't you listen to me!' </i>Kelsey thought angrily and grabbed her things to go into the bathroom to change. Climbing into her bed, her mind was racing, but her body was exhausted from the adrenaline rush of earlier and she finally fell into a restless sleep.</p>
		<p>As hard as Alyssa tried she could not get out from under the heavy darkness that pressed against her. She was finding it hard to breathe and was beginning to panic. She tried pulling at what was holding her down, but only grabbed air. It seemed to wrap around her body of it's own accord and she could feel it pressing against her face cutting off her air. She could feel her lungs burning as they became starved for air and she could hear her heartbeat loudly in the darkness. She began to fight in earnest and screamed as she could feel the darkness tightening its hold on her and her world began to quake.</p>
		<p>"Alyssa, wake up! Alyssa! Your dreaming...wake up, honey!" Kelsey had grabbed the thrashing woman to try to calm her down before she hurt herself. Her arms and legs were flailing and twisting with the sheet. Kelsey realized what Alyssa was fighting and began pulling the sheet away from her body and freeing her arms and legs, once that was complete she could feel the blonde's body began to relax and she pulled her into her arms and called to her. Green eyes fluttered once and then opened and Kelsey smiled when recognition lit up in them.</p>
		<p>Alyssa was fighting with all her strength and suddenly the cloth began to lift and she could feel the cool dark air caress her overheated body. She felt a comfort from the darkness, it touched her but, she wasn't afraid and it was then she heard someone calling her and followed the voice. Opening her eyes to semi-light, she looked directly into blue eyes that changed from worried to relieved. </p>
		<p>"Are you okay?" Kelsey heard the deep soft voice ask and she felt confusion cloud her mind. "Huh?"</p>
		<p>"You were having a nightmare, do you remember?" Kelsey watched as the confusion turned to remembrance and the eyes closed against the memory. "Its okay, it' over now."</p>
		<p>"Damn." Alyssa whispered and opened tear-laden eyes. "That was so real." She took a deep breath and tried to slow her breath and her heart rate down.</p>
		<p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Kelsey continued to sit on the edge of the bed leaning over Alyssa. Her hands still holding the woman's arms lightly and debating moving, but she didn't want to let go of the connection. The hip that she rested on was beginning to cramp, but she didn't care and remained still.</p>
		<p>Alyssa thought for a long moment looking up at the ceiling. She wasn't sure how to explain what had happened to her. It seemed so real, but yet she felt so foolish now. Kelsey shifted to try to alleviate the ache that was now running from her hip down to her foot. Alyssa sensed her distress and shifted over closer to the wall in an unconscious effort to give her more room to sit. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you sit all hunched over like that."</p>
		<p>"It's Okay." Kelsey smiled and shifted further up on the bed to get off her hip and looked down and realized she couldn't see Alyssa's a face in the darkness at this distance. Kelsey finally just switched hips and leaned down on an elbow on the bed so that she could see her face and waited for Alyssa to speak. When Alyssa didn't answer for a bit, she lay her arm along Alyssa's as it rested across her waist.</p>
		<p>"If you don't want to talk, I understand."</p>
		<p>Alyssa shook her head but kept her focus on the ceiling as she began to explain. "I was trapped in the darkness and it wrapped around me and I couldn't breath. The harder I struggled the tighter the darkness held me until I could feel my lungs burning." Alyssa voice still shakily from the experience and she didn't look at Kelsey until the end when she added, "I feel really stupid now. I don't know what came over me. I don't normally have nightmares!"</p>
		<p>"Hey, it's not stupid at all given the circumstances today." Kelsey hadn't meant to let Alyssa know that she knew more about what happened today or what she had done in the staff lounge earlier. She didn't want the woman to get offended by her protective attitude. She was still trying to deal with that one herself.</p>
		<p>"You talked to Karen didn't you?" Alyssa focused her attention on Kelsey's arm on top of hers and wouldn't look the woman in the eye. She kept her voice neutral, as she wasn't really sure how she felt about it.</p>
		<p>"Yes, are you mad?" Kelsey hoped the answer would be no and she didn't give out any more information than necessary.</p>
		<p>"I guess not. So, she told you, huh?" Alyssa could feel the flush rising in her cheeks and wanted to look up to see if Kelsey was laughing at her and wondered <i>'So, are you going to make fun of me too?'</i></p>
		<p>"I don't know exactly what happened except that she hurt you and that was enough." Kelsey answered and thought about her next step. "And, I don't think you will have to worry about her much anymore. I'm going to see that she is dismissed and sent packing to England!" The bitterness in Kelsey's voice was unmistakable and Alyssa shivered wondering if she was mad because it happened to her, or that it happened in general.</p>
		<p>Kelsey moved closer and squeezed the arm she held. "There is nothing more to worry about. I don't think you will have any trouble from Pam or Kellie either."</p>
		<p>"No, Pam and Kellie weren't even there when it happened." Alyssa's voice was low, almost a whisper as if speaking of it made it more real.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's anger spiked as she thought about all the possibilities of what actually did happen. Finally, she took a chance and asked, "Did she hurt you?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa looked up surprised at Kelsey. <i>'Karen didn't tell her!'</i> And when she noticed the worry begin to creep back into the blue eyes, she quickly shook her head and looked away. "It wasn't that bad."</p>
		<p>"Meaning?"</p>
		<p>"At first she just kissed me and then things progressed until she pinched my...umm...you know...umm...boob really hard." The flush fully infused her face and she wished it wasn't so warm in the room.</p>
		<p>"Is it okay?" Kelsey asked quickly looking from the green eyes down to the chest and back up. Alyssa grinned as her face reddened and shook her head affirmative. "It's just a little tender that's all."</p>
		<p>"Damn her!"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry." Alyssa looked away afraid to see the anger and disappointment in the other woman's eyes. She had wanted to prove herself to everyone and had, instead, shown how naive she really was. <i>'I'm such a jerk!'</i></p>
		<p>Kelsey's anger waned at the catch in Alyssa's voice and she lifted the blonde's face toward her. "No, you have nothing to apologize for, you did nothing wrong." </p>
		<p>"You tried to warn me, but I was too stubborn to listen."</p>
		<p>Kelsey stood up and smiled down at Alyssa. "Unfortunately, we all do that sometimes."</p>
		<p>"I guess so. I just wanted to prove I could take care of myself and instead, I prove just the opposite." Alyssa shook her head disgusted.</p>
		<p>"Well, it's your first tour and we all learn the hard way. Now, I think it's time that Karen learned a valuable lesson." Kelsey moved toward the door and stopped when Alyssa called out.</p>
		<p>"Wait! What are you going to do?"</p>
		<p>"I'm going to have a talk with the Staff Director about a one-way ticket for Karen."</p>
		<p>Alyssa shook her head, she just wanted to forget the whole matter and not have anyone else know about what happened. It was bad enough she had to tell the story to Kelsey. "I really rather you didn't get involved and just let this go."</p>
		<p>"It's too late, I'm already involved. As your senior officer, I have a duty to report Karen, and it's about time she was put in her place. There is no room for people like her on this crew." Kelsey turned toward the door with a purpose. She wasn't thrilled that Alyssa was still trying to cover for Karen and wondered, <i>"She can't still want Karen?'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa bristled at the comment reacted harshly. "Well, I wouldn't want you to shirk your duty or anything, but I'd rather things were just forgotten."</p>
		<p>Kelsey looked back at Alyssa and her blood flared at the rebuff. "Well, you should have thought about that before you got yourself involved in grown up things you weren't ready to handle."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 11">
		<p>Kelsey walked down the corridor unsure of whom she was madder with, Alyssa or herself. <i>'Maybe Alyssa isn't gay!' </i>Kelsey thought suddenly stopping in her tracks. Every signal indicated Alyssa was interested, then again, maybe she is just beginning to figure it all out for herself? <i>'Damn! Not a great introduction.' </i>Now the anger was finally focused on who it needed to be...Karen. Picking up her step once again, she headed to the Staff Director's Office with a purpose.</p>
		<p>Alyssa fell backwards on the bed after the door firmly closed behind Kelsey. '<i>Man, all I keep doing is mess things up. But, what is Kelsey's problem? Why does she always take everything so personal?' </i>Alyssa lay thinking for awhile but all she was getting in return was a headache. She got up to shower and dress, and then headed out for an early morning walk on the deck. She was sure that any moment she would be getting a call to report to the Director's office. Stopping at the rail she looked out over the wide expanse of ocean and shook her head. "Great soon everyone will know what a dolt I am." <i>'But, I don't appreciate the comment about not being grown up. Just because I'm not experienced doesn't mean I don't understand.' </i></p>
		<p>"Damn! I'm from a small town, people didn't run around with Lesbian tattooed on their foreheads!" It was one of the reasons she had taken this job, to get away from the small town mentality and the need to meet different people. "Well, I can't say I haven't fulfilled the latter wish. I've certainly met some different people, very different indeed!" Frowning, she leaned against the rail and let her mind reflect over her current situation. After a silent inner argument, she came to the decision that enough was enough. She was tired of always being on the short end of everything<i>. 'I'm going to show them I'm no one's patsy anymore!'</i> "You wanna play hardball, well then Let's play! I'm going to give as good as I've been getting!" Talking outloud to no one and everyone, she slapped her palm against the top off the rail, spun around and headed down toward the Officer's Dining Room for breakfast. <i>'Gotta fuel up for battle!'</i> Alyssa thought smiling at her decision.</p>
		<p>Kelsey emerged from the Director's office and headed out toward the deck. She needed some fresh air after her go-around in the Director's office. Standing against the rail she took a deep calming breath and let the early morning breeze wash over her. After all the arguing and complaining, Karen would still be able to stay aboard with only a warning and loss of shore privileges for the next two weeks. Kelsey had been livid, but was beginning to calm down burdened with the futility of it all. "Well Alyssa, it looks like you are going to get your wish after all." Feeling a sense of loss she turned and headed down to the cabin to shower and get ready for work. Luckily she would be busy all day with a sporting contest. They were to be at sea for the day and had scheduled a shipboard athletic contest to keep the passengers amused. It was usually a fun day and anyone who didn't want to lay in the sun or stay indoors usually showed up for the function, either to participate or cheer on the various teams.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter 12">
		<p>Kelsey watched as the contestants vied for points laughing at their antics and announcing the winners as they finished. During one particular race, she leaned on the rail and looked down at the pool area instantly regretting her actions. Karen looked up from serving her drinks and saw Kelsey looking down at her and waved, the smug smile on her face said it all. Kelsey started to turn away until she saw Alyssa walking along the pool headed toward Karen and herself. She quickly wondered which one of them it was. Alyssa wore a loose fitting black tank top over gray sports bra and a pair of white shorts. Kelsey subconsciously appreciated how the shorts accented her newly tanned legs. Karen saw the change in Kelsey's focus and the look on the taller woman's face. She turned to see Alyssa walking past her station and quickly moved to intercept her. </p>
		<p>"Hey girl! How are you doing?" </p>
		<p>Alyssa was stopped short of her goal when a figure stepped in front of her blocking her progression. She hadn't seen the Karen until now and instantly regretted coming this way. She put on a fake smile and began to play the game. "Me, Oh, I'm doing great!" Until now, her day had past smoothly and the dreaded call to the Director's office had never come. She began to wonder what exactly had happened with Kelsey's threats. After her shift had ended her curiosity got the better of her and she went back to the cabin to change out of her uniform before heading over to the forward deck to where the Shipboard Olympics were being held.</p>
		<p>"Oh, that's not what I heard this morning in the Director's office. Seems your girlfriend doesn't think so either." Karen was pushing all sorts of buttons to get a rise out of the young woman. She owed her for the trouble she had caused her. She had almost lost her job this morning and wanted a little paybacks.</p>
		<p>"Jealous?" Alyssa countered back spitefully. She just wanted to get Karen off her back permanently and let the woman know that she wasn't interested in playing her games.</p>
		<p>"For what, keeping you virginal?" Karen whispered laughing at the barb.</p>
		<p>"Who said I was?"</p>
		<p>"Ha! Don't go and try to tell me that you and her have gotten together. No way!" Karen replied looking at Alyssa closely for a hint of the truth in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"No? Well, maybe you should ask her that." Alyssa smiled a coy smile and looked up to see Kelsey looking down at them with a scowl. Against her better judgment she waved up at the tall woman and blew her a quick kiss. She heard the intake of breath from the woman next to her and she knew that her action had the desired effect. </p>
		<p>Kelsey had been watching the interaction between the two women intently until Alyssa turned her attention upward toward her. What happened next completely floored the dark-haired woman and she took a step backward as her breath caught in her throat. <i>'What the hell.....'</i></p>
		<p>As Karen looked from Alyssa up to Kelsey, the blonde could tell that the woman next to her was becoming extremely irate. Alyssa quickly winked at her and attempted to walk around the waitress.</p>
		<p>Karen grabbed Alyssa's arm tightly and stopped her dead. "Well, since you are giving it up for that trash, how about you and me get together tonight after my shift."</p>
		<p>Alyssa tried to pull her arm free, but the woman had a tight grip on it and Alyssa could feel the anger rising within. She stopped for a moment and looked at Karen coolly before responding. "With you, why ever would I want to do that? What makes you think I would settle for less?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa sidestepped Karen when she shifted backwards in surprise at the blonde's rebuff. She quickly headed on shaky legs toward the stairs and began to climb to the upper deck. Reaching the top of the stairs she came face to face with Kelsey and looked up in cool blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"I'm not even going to ask what that was about, but are you okay?" The low smooth voice held a faint quiver and Kelsey bit her tongue to keep her voice from cracking.</p>
		<p>Green eyes continued to stare blue and the blonde shrugged her shoulders replying, "Yes, I'm fine." Alyssa didn't break eye contact, which disconcerted the taller woman and made her stammer. "Are you...you sure?" With a quick nod of her head, she moved away toward the far end of the deck and Kelsey watched as she sat down at an empty table and looked out over the ocean. <i>'Damn, what the hell was that all about?'</i> Kelsey heard her name called and turned her attention back to the contest. She didn't have time for this right now, she had a job to do. During the course of the next hour she couldn't help but glance over where the blonde was sitting.</p>
		<p>Alyssa's legs were still shaky, she took each step carefully focusing on walking away coolly without giving away her weakness. She couldn't believe what she had just done and the look in Kelsey's eyes had floored her. She had expected anger and a lecture from the tall roommate, but instead she saw a flicker of something she just couldn't put her finger on and it made her stomach flutter. Reaching for a deck chair, she sat and focused her eyes on the water, afraid to look toward Kelsey for fear the woman would still be watching her with that look. Finally, Alyssa diverted her attention from the ocean to the competition being held. After a bit her eyes wandered toward the tall woman in charge and she watched in rapt attention at the way Kelsey carried herself. There was an assured grace that showed she was comfortable in her own skin. <i>'I wonder what that would feel like, to actually be at the point in life where I have that kind of confidence?'</i> </p>
