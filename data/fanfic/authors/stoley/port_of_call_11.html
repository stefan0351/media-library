<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 11 -->

<p>Kelsey walked down the corridor unsure of whom she was madder with, Alyssa or herself. <i>'Maybe Alyssa isn't gay!' </i>Kelsey thought suddenly stopping in her tracks. Every signal indicated Alyssa was interested, then again, maybe she is just beginning to figure it all out for herself? <i>'Damn! Not a great introduction.' </i>Now the anger was finally focused on who it needed to be...Karen. Picking up her step once again, she headed to the Staff Director's Office with a purpose.</p>
		<p>Alyssa fell backwards on the bed after the door firmly closed behind Kelsey. '<i>Man, all I keep doing is mess things up. But, what is Kelsey's problem? Why does she always take everything so personal?' </i>Alyssa lay thinking for awhile but all she was getting in return was a headache. She got up to shower and dress, and then headed out for an early morning walk on the deck. She was sure that any moment she would be getting a call to report to the Director's office. Stopping at the rail she looked out over the wide expanse of ocean and shook her head. "Great soon everyone will know what a dolt I am." <i>'But, I don't appreciate the comment about not being grown up. Just because I'm not experienced doesn't mean I don't understand.' </i></p>
		<p>"Damn! I'm from a small town, people didn't run around with Lesbian tattooed on their foreheads!" It was one of the reasons she had taken this job, to get away from the small town mentality and the need to meet different people. "Well, I can't say I haven't fulfilled the latter wish. I've certainly met some different people, very different indeed!" Frowning, she leaned against the rail and let her mind reflect over her current situation. After a silent inner argument, she came to the decision that enough was enough. She was tired of always being on the short end of everything<i>. 'I'm going to show them I'm no one's patsy anymore!'</i> "You wanna play hardball, well then Let's play! I'm going to give as good as I've been getting!" Talking outloud to no one and everyone, she slapped her palm against the top off the rail, spun around and headed down toward the Officer's Dining Room for breakfast. <i>'Gotta fuel up for battle!'</i> Alyssa thought smiling at her decision.</p>
		<p>Kelsey emerged from the Director's office and headed out toward the deck. She needed some fresh air after her go-around in the Director's office. Standing against the rail she took a deep calming breath and let the early morning breeze wash over her. After all the arguing and complaining, Karen would still be able to stay aboard with only a warning and loss of shore privileges for the next two weeks. Kelsey had been livid, but was beginning to calm down burdened with the futility of it all. "Well Alyssa, it looks like you are going to get your wish after all." Feeling a sense of loss she turned and headed down to the cabin to shower and get ready for work. Luckily she would be busy all day with a sporting contest. They were to be at sea for the day and had scheduled a shipboard athletic contest to keep the passengers amused. It was usually a fun day and anyone who didn't want to lay in the sun or stay indoors usually showed up for the function, either to participate or cheer on the various teams.</p>
