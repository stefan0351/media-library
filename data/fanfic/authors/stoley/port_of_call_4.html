<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>Alyssa actually enjoyed the afternoon she spent with the other officers in her team. She got a copy of her schedule, which didn't look too bad, but as she has thought, she had a lot of early morning shifts. From what she had learned, being an officer had it's advantages. Their days were markedly shorter than the average crewmember. An average crewmember worked anywhere from 12 to 16 hours a day, where and officer only worked 10 to 12, with one day a week off to go ashore. She found that some crew members never went ashore due to their visa status, but being an American with a passport, meant she could get off at any of the stops long the way. Alyssa had dinner with her co-workers before heading back toward her cabin to change for the party. She was looking forward to spending some time making some friends to go ashore sightseeing with. Alyssa hadn't seen her roommate since the orientation and when she entered the empty cabin, she assumed Kelsey was still with her teammates. Quickly, showering and changing into Khaki shorts and a black tank top, Alyssa dabbed on some perfume for good measure and headed toward the Crew's lounge.</p>
		<p>It had been a long exhausting day for Kelsey and she wanted nothing more than to relax and get things organized for tomorrow's passengers. Her days of idle relaxing were over now that her tour had started. As Assistant Sports Director it was her duty to see that every schedule and activity was planned and manned throughout the entire cruise. The first cruise was usually the hardest, getting everyone adjusted and then after that they pretty much followed the same pattern for each cruise. She had a good crew working with her this season and things should run pretty smoothly once all the bugs were ironed out, which is what they had been trying to do this afternoon and evening. It was later than Kelsey had thought and she hurried toward the cabin hoping at best to find Alyssa sound asleep, but at worst wide awake and ready wanting to talk. As soon as Kelsey entered the cabin and got one whiff of the air, she knew the worst would have been preferable to what was probably happening. Throwing her things on her bed, she headed back out the cabin door toward the party. Kelsey looked down at her watch, it was already 11:30 PM and the party had been in full swing since about 9:30 PM. "Damn!" Cursing under her breath, Kelsey hurried toward the Crew's Lounge. Knowing the party of women in question, it was anyone's guess as to what had already transpired this evening. She just hoped that her fears were unfounded and that Alyssa was actually more intune then she gave her credit. </p>
		<p>Kelsey entered the smoky lounge to loud music and a packed room of partygoers having a good time. Kelsey relaxed until she heard a roar of cheers over the din of the room and looked toward the corner. On a table in the back stood a very drunk Alyssa trying to sway seductively to the music as a group of men and women circled the table cheering her on to take her clothes off and handing her drinks to keep her primed. Alyssa looked completely out of touch with what was going on and was just following the crowds lead as to what to do next. Kelsey took a deep breath and let it out slowly before she made her way through the crowded room. <i>'This isn't going to be fun.'</i></p>
