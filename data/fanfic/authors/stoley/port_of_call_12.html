<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 12 -->

<p>Kelsey watched as the contestants vied for points laughing at their antics and announcing the winners as they finished. During one particular race, she leaned on the rail and looked down at the pool area instantly regretting her actions. Karen looked up from serving her drinks and saw Kelsey looking down at her and waved, the smug smile on her face said it all. Kelsey started to turn away until she saw Alyssa walking along the pool headed toward Karen and herself. She quickly wondered which one of them it was. Alyssa wore a loose fitting black tank top over gray sports bra and a pair of white shorts. Kelsey subconsciously appreciated how the shorts accented her newly tanned legs. Karen saw the change in Kelsey's focus and the look on the taller woman's face. She turned to see Alyssa walking past her station and quickly moved to intercept her. </p>
		<p>"Hey girl! How are you doing?" </p>
		<p>Alyssa was stopped short of her goal when a figure stepped in front of her blocking her progression. She hadn't seen the Karen until now and instantly regretted coming this way. She put on a fake smile and began to play the game. "Me, Oh, I'm doing great!" Until now, her day had past smoothly and the dreaded call to the Director's office had never come. She began to wonder what exactly had happened with Kelsey's threats. After her shift had ended her curiosity got the better of her and she went back to the cabin to change out of her uniform before heading over to the forward deck to where the Shipboard Olympics were being held.</p>
		<p>"Oh, that's not what I heard this morning in the Director's office. Seems your girlfriend doesn't think so either." Karen was pushing all sorts of buttons to get a rise out of the young woman. She owed her for the trouble she had caused her. She had almost lost her job this morning and wanted a little paybacks.</p>
		<p>"Jealous?" Alyssa countered back spitefully. She just wanted to get Karen off her back permanently and let the woman know that she wasn't interested in playing her games.</p>
		<p>"For what, keeping you virginal?" Karen whispered laughing at the barb.</p>
		<p>"Who said I was?"</p>
		<p>"Ha! Don't go and try to tell me that you and her have gotten together. No way!" Karen replied looking at Alyssa closely for a hint of the truth in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"No? Well, maybe you should ask her that." Alyssa smiled a coy smile and looked up to see Kelsey looking down at them with a scowl. Against her better judgment she waved up at the tall woman and blew her a quick kiss. She heard the intake of breath from the woman next to her and she knew that her action had the desired effect. </p>
		<p>Kelsey had been watching the interaction between the two women intently until Alyssa turned her attention upward toward her. What happened next completely floored the dark-haired woman and she took a step backward as her breath caught in her throat. <i>'What the hell.....'</i></p>
		<p>As Karen looked from Alyssa up to Kelsey, the blonde could tell that the woman next to her was becoming extremely irate. Alyssa quickly winked at her and attempted to walk around the waitress.</p>
		<p>Karen grabbed Alyssa's arm tightly and stopped her dead. "Well, since you are giving it up for that trash, how about you and me get together tonight after my shift."</p>
		<p>Alyssa tried to pull her arm free, but the woman had a tight grip on it and Alyssa could feel the anger rising within. She stopped for a moment and looked at Karen coolly before responding. "With you, why ever would I want to do that? What makes you think I would settle for less?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa sidestepped Karen when she shifted backwards in surprise at the blonde's rebuff. She quickly headed on shaky legs toward the stairs and began to climb to the upper deck. Reaching the top of the stairs she came face to face with Kelsey and looked up in cool blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"I'm not even going to ask what that was about, but are you okay?" The low smooth voice held a faint quiver and Kelsey bit her tongue to keep her voice from cracking.</p>
		<p>Green eyes continued to stare blue and the blonde shrugged her shoulders replying, "Yes, I'm fine." Alyssa didn't break eye contact, which disconcerted the taller woman and made her stammer. "Are you...you sure?" With a quick nod of her head, she moved away toward the far end of the deck and Kelsey watched as she sat down at an empty table and looked out over the ocean. <i>'Damn, what the hell was that all about?'</i> Kelsey heard her name called and turned her attention back to the contest. She didn't have time for this right now, she had a job to do. During the course of the next hour she couldn't help but glance over where the blonde was sitting.</p>
		<p>Alyssa's legs were still shaky, she took each step carefully focusing on walking away coolly without giving away her weakness. She couldn't believe what she had just done and the look in Kelsey's eyes had floored her. She had expected anger and a lecture from the tall roommate, but instead she saw a flicker of something she just couldn't put her finger on and it made her stomach flutter. Reaching for a deck chair, she sat and focused her eyes on the water, afraid to look toward Kelsey for fear the woman would still be watching her with that look. Finally, Alyssa diverted her attention from the ocean to the competition being held. After a bit her eyes wandered toward the tall woman in charge and she watched in rapt attention at the way Kelsey carried herself. There was an assured grace that showed she was comfortable in her own skin. <i>'I wonder what that would feel like, to actually be at the point in life where I have that kind of confidence?'</i> </p>
