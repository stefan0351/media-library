<!-- Congratulations \ null -->

<p>"Brooke, hun, slow down on those nails. What is eating at you today?" The second most popular girl in Kennedy High waited for a response.</p>
<p>Brooke McQueen continued scanning the cafeteria as she crunched another fingernail with her teeth.</p>
<p>"Come on girl." Still nothing came from the girl's lips. "You know whatever the problem is, that you can talk to me. I'm right here for you, B." The taller blonde remained silent as she ignored her best friend.</p>
<p>Nicole grew tired of being ignored, leaned across the 4' lunch table and started shaking Brooke out of her comfort zone. Brooke had no choice but to give Nicole he attention she had been wanting...no, demanding.</p>
<p>"What Nicole? What do you want?" It was obvious to the short curly haired blonde that Brooke had totally been ignoring everything she had said for the past few minutes.</p>
<p>"She really has no idea what I said. Who does she think she is ignoring me? She is no better than me and how dare she talk to me in that manner." thought the selfish girl.</p>
<p>"Hey Brookie, you know Glamazons don't snap like that toward other Glamazons. We have a reputation to uphold, you know. I was just concerned about you. You haven't been your normal self the past few days. Is there a problem that you need to talk about? There was a hint of real concern in the normally manipulative girl.</p>
<p>"It's Jane."</p>
<p>"Sam's mother, Jane?"</p>
<p>Brooke lowered her head and raised her upper lip as she gave Nicole her best 'I can't believe you just said that' look. "Do I need to remind you that she is now my mother as well?"</p>
<p>Ignoring the look she was receiving, "Sorry Brookie, but you and Sam will never be sisters in my book. I don't see why your dad had to go off and destroy yours and my quite happy lives by marrying that..."</p>
<p>"Okay Nic, I get your point. And I would like you know that our lives haven't been destroyed, but enriched. Living with Sam and Jane has been an overwhelming experience. You really don't know someone until you've shared a bathroom and living quarters with them. Sam and I have become closer and I've only prospered from out relationship."</p>
<p>"Oh please, this is me you're talking to, not 60 Minutes or some other media mongers. You can drop this facade of yours and speak your mind. I hate your sister as much as you do."</p>
<p>Brooke let Nicole's comment slide. "Nic, you should lighten up some and give Sam a break. Maybe you should spend some quality time with her and I promise you my throne of 'Queen of Kennedy High' that you would be singing a different tune afterwards. Yes, Sam's family and mine came from different sides of the tracks, but we are no different. We all encounter the same day-to-day stress and problems."</p>
<p>"Whatever. You just go on believing that you all are a family."</p>
<p>"I feel in the last few weeks...we have grown closer and have become a family. Ans as for your constant and continuing feud with Sam..." Nicole knew when her friend was going to break out with a speech and quickly cut her off.</p>
<p>"Oh, look at the time. Wouldn't want to be late for class will we?"</p>
<p>Looking up at the clock, "Girl, lunch lasts another fifteen minutes."</p>
<p>"You look here. You know what they say, the early bird gets the worm...and all the hot looking jocks. Talk to you later." The short blonde hastily exited the cafeteria, grabbing a jock's jacket as she and him exited through the doors. Brooke was left to only her own thoughts.</p>
<p>Looking up and across the room, the blonde's eyes were met with someone else's staring eyes.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Across the same cafeteria sat Sam McQueen as she played with her food and stared across the room at her sister's equally staring eyes. Sam's friends, Harrison and Lily, attempted to include her in their most recent debate, but as of late the girl had kept herself bottled up.</p>
<p>Emotions ran wild through the brunette's body and yet she had no way to release them. Since her mom had married Mike McQueen and Brooke McQueen became her sister, she had to admit her life had been better. in school the two girls kept to their individual clicks and tried their hardest to stay out of each other's way, but once they were in the confines of their mutual home they paled around and cut up with each other. Sam had gotten used to her sister, Brooke, and hated that they couldn't have the same type of fun at school as they had at home. Here, they are judged...there they are free.</p>
<p>It had become a custom for he two girls to lean against each other's bodies while watching television or one sitting on the floor between the other's lap while they brushed through the other's hair. The feuding had even lessened and the barriers and rules governing over their rooms had been lifted. Now, on occasion, they shared a bed while they talked about their day or life in general. Sam had even persuaded Brooke to start writing herself; she gave her a journal as a gift.</p>
<p>To say Brooke and Sam McQueen had grown accustomed to each other's presence would be an understatement. Their lives had in fact become one and the same...or at least it seemed that way. They each knew that in the transition of becoming sisters that they had bonded...possibly more than was initially intended.</p>
<p>Now as they continue on with their lives and sit starring back at each other, they wonder how they can ever stand to be apart again. Love had become a mutual feeling between the two, yet they didn't know how to progress it or even if they wanted anything more from it or even what it really was.</p>
<p>Sitting in the school cafeteria at a lunch table, there was Sam, lonely in her own right. To the brunette, Lily and Harrison's issues were of little importance or concern at that time. She dismissed them as being a source of unwanted noise pollution and decided to do something to remedy her problem.</p>
<p>Grabbing her book bag, she stood up and reached back for her lunch tray; her friends noticed her sudden attempt at a retreat.</p>
<p>"Sam, where are you going?"</p>
<p>Slapping the boy across his arm. "Like that is any of your business, Harrison."</p>
<p>"I'm just going over to give Brooke some company. She looks lonely. It's the least a sister should do."</p>
<p>"I'll be honest with you Sam; I never thought your parents would tie the knot, but they did and you seem okay with the whole sister thing. Good for you. I still can't get over the fact that the rival enemies that you two once were, have settled your differences and have become a family. Truly amazing."</p>
<p>"Yeah, what a concept." smirked the male of the group.</p>
<p>"Oh please. I bet Brooke and me being sisters has only fueled your fantasies and nightly activities." His smile was enough to reassure her comment.</p>
<p>"Okay, that is just nasty." The other two both look at the short dark haired Latino, causing a redness to flush across her face. "Okay. You got me. It's more fun than nasty."</p>
<p>"See Lily, isn't it much nicer when you can open up with other people around?" Sam's eyes drifted back to Brooke's awaiting ones.</p>
<p>For the first time, Lily saw Sam's face and new the expression engulfing it, way to well. She turned around in her seat to see the source and cause of Sam's body language. Oddly, she wasn't surprised to see the same wanting and lust-filled expression radiating from Brooke McQueen's direction.</p>
<p>Standing up herself, Lily whispered into Sam's ear, "Go to her." Sam faced her short friend for a brief moment before making her way across the room to sit across the table from her sister. Lily watched Brooke's face light up as Sam neared her table. The Latino sat back down at her own table and returned to her debate with her other friend. Harrison wasn't stupid and knew Sam probably better than anyone. He also knew the face of love when he saw it adn as he glanced back over his shoulder and saw Sam sitting with Brooke, right of way, he knew what he was seeing.</p>
<p>"Hey Sam. I didn't know if you would join me or not."</p>
<p>"What was a sister to do? You looked lonely. What, Nicole gone off to steal someone else's soul?" She quickly changed the subject when she saw the look her sister was giving her.</p>
<p>"So, how about that game?"</p>
<p>"What game?"</p>
<p>"Any game! Anything to break this extreme amount of tension we have going on."</p>
<p>"Is that what it is...tension?" A response would have been lost in their mutual staring. Silence crept over their bodies as they lost themselves in each other's eyes.</p>
<p>Little did they know that their stare down and actions didn't go unnoticed. Mouths of students within their obscenity dropped as the two girls' fingers interlaced and rested against their table. Words weren't needed for Brooke and Sam McQueen to out themselves and the love they shared for each other. The tension between the two lessened as the seconds past.</p>
<p>Their depleting tension was finally dropped when an observing Josh Ford, Brooke's ex-boyfriend, laid a hand upon her shoulder and spoke so the two girls could hear him. "Congratulations. Sam, you have something real special in your hands."</p>
<p>The two girls were broken out of their lust-filled trances and looked up at Josh, then around at their fellow students, and finally down toward the table where their fingers rested upon each others.</p>
<p>Brooke was the first to break the silence. "Sam, I think they know." Sam smiled back at her.</p>
<p>"I think you're right." Seconds later, the bell ending their lunch period sounded and the spacious cafeteria filled with the sound of clanging plates, trays, and scuffling feet as the students rushed to empty trays and get to class.</p>
<p>Brooke and Sam, Kennedy's new couple, casually stood up and walked hand-in-hand toward the cafeteria exit doors and a into a new life; a life filled with struggles, successes, happiness, and love.</p>
