	<chapter title="Part One">
		<p>"Brooke?" Sam said as she leaned against Brooke's open door frame.</p>
		<p>"Yeah?" The blonde answered, looking up from her calculus homework.</p>
		<p>"I was just wondering if I could borrow your computer for a moment. I
			need to install a program on my laptop, so right now it's in defrag
			mode." Sam replied.</p>
		<p>"And you need my computer to...?" Brooke asked.</p>
		<p>"I have a mass email to send out to my team at the paper. I told them
			I'd have it out by 8:00, it's now, 8:15." She said looking down at her
			watch.</p>
		<p>"I guess that's fine. Just don't fill my comp full of internet porn.
			I've seen your laptop." Brooke said trying to look serious.</p>
		<p>Sam just smirked as she walked over to Brooke's desk. "I'm not the one
			with scantily clad bodies as my desktop wallpaper." She retorted,
			moving Brooke's wireless mouse, removing the blonde's annoying,
			bouncing, "Bring It!" Pep Squad screensaver. She pointed to the screen
			as if reiterating her point.</p>
		<p>"It's a United Colors of Bennetton ad." Brooke huffed, sticking out of
			her tongue.</p>
		<p>"Whatever you say." Sam replied with a huge grin as she turned back to
			the computer. She popped her disk in the A drive and began to type
			furiously.</p>
		<p>The two worked in companionable silence. Brooke was somehow oddly
			comforted by the brunette's presence and the light sound of the keys
			tapping, barely able to be heard over the mixed cd playing in the
			blonde's stereo. At one point, they were both humming along with the
			sweet sounds of the Cranberries "Linger." It wasn't long before Brooke
			was done with her homework, and Sam was thanking her and bidding her
			goodnight.</p>
		<p>She took up the journalist's still warm spot on her desk chair and
			looked at her AIM away message screen. She had several messages from
			Carmen and Mary Cherry. She decided to answer their inane questions as
			quickly as possible. She had a test first period, and she was hoping
			to get to bed early.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Hey Carm, what did you need?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Hang on, one sec Brooke. Sam's asking me about
				my notes from our French class.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: K...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Sam was online? Brooke looked at her buddy list and sure enough the
			brunette's screen name was there at the top of her list. It was weird
			Sam hadn't messaged her. In the short time since Mac had been born and
			she'd almost lost her life to insane ex-best friend, she and Sam had
			become almost inseparable. That tends to happen when that person saves
			your life, Brooke thought. She was so grateful to Sam, and not only
			for pushing her out of the way that fateful night, but the journalist
			had proven to be the best friend she'd ever had. She opened up a
			window to message Sam, when another popped up in the way.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Hey Brookie!</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Hey Mary Cherry...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: R we still on 4 practice 2morrow after school? Joe
				and I have plans.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Of course we still have practice, weren't you at
				the pep rally last week? We looked like a flock of uncoordinated seagulls.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: I know, Brookie, but Joe's takin' me to see the new
				Gwyneth movie.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Well if you and Carmen can manage to get the
				others whipped into shape, I might let you go early.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: But Brooke, you know that's damn near impossible.
				It's bad enuff that none of them are as coordinated or stunnin' as you
				and I are. I can't work miracles, hun...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Just then Carmen's window started blinking. She clicked on it pulling
			up the conversation.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: OK sorry about that. I swear you would think she
				wasn't even in class...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Carm...?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Oh right! I just made this ah-mazing mix for
				next week's game. I was wondering if you might want to hear it tomorrow.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Uh yeah, sure I guess. We can listen to it on the
				way to school. I'll be by at 7 btw. I have a test first period.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: OK cool, I'll be ready.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke brought up the window for Sam's screen name again, ignoring the
			flash from the other two conversations that apparently were still
			taking place.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Hey are you mad at me or something?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>Auto response from LoisLane082884: trying to finish my
				homework...damn my procrastinating ways....</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Damn I missed her, Brooke thought. She closed Sam's window and brought
			Mary Cherry's back up.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Brooke? Brooke? Where'd ya go?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: I'm here...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Well I have to get goin hun. Joe is on the phone.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Oh ok, see you tomorrow</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Bye hun...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe signed off at 9:06:47 PM</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Now to get rid of Carmen...</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: My mom is totally psyched for Homecoming this
				year. Are you gonna run?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: I haven't really given it much thought. I'm
				probably going to just keep a low profile this year. The Bring It
				squad is more than enough for me to handle.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>And that was true, ever since Nicole had transferred from Kennedy this
			year, she'd been named Captain of the squad and Carmen co-captain. So
			far, things had been going great, and the groups had merged
			harmoniously, the last piece falling into place when Harrison had
			started dating Mary Cherry two months ago, much to everyone's
			surprise. Brooke shuttered, wondering what she'd ever seen in him. She
			just chocked it up to a momentary lapse in judgment.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Well I'm definitely gonna run again if I'm
				nominated. OMG! What if I'm not nominated? Brooke what am I gonna to do?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. She didn't know how Sam had put up with this
			constantly talking Carmen off of a ledge routine. They'd been good
			friends for almost two years now, and she was definitely tired of it.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Relax Carm, I'm sure you'll be nominated.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Thanx, well anyway I have one more calc problem
				to do, and then I'm heading to bed. See you in the morning.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Night, Carm...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002 signed off at 9:24:55 PM</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed with relief. She checked her list one more time, annoyed
			to see that little yellow "post-it" next to Sam's screen name. Josh
			and Sugar were both online, but she really wasn't up to talking to
			either one of them. So instead she pulled up her Internet Explorer and
			typed Yahoo Mail into the address bar. She clicked on the inbox tab
			and saw she had several emails. Her eyes were immediately drawn to the
			email saying she had a reply to a comment she'd made in someone else's
			livejournal. She hadn't updated or really read any comments for a
			couple of weeks, but she always got the random response or something
			from one of the arbitrary communities she belonged to.</p>
		<p>Her hazel eyes scanned the email reading the lame response. When she
			came to the original comment she realized she hadn't written it. Not
			only had she not written it, it wasn't even her journal name. It
			wasn't a name she'd recognized at all. She closed the email, looking
			at the name displayed on the inbox. Sam had forgotten to sign out of
			her email. What's more, Sam apparently had a secret journal.</p>
		<p>She immediately opened her journal in another window. She signed in
			and did a quick perusal of all of their friends' user profiles. None
			of them had the journal saved as a friend. She typed in the journal
			name and looked up the user information. Apparently Sam really didn't
			want this journal to be found. Sam had used the pseudonym "Tippy
			Typewriter" and had registered it to a completely different city and
			state. She didn't have really any friends, saved for a few names
			Brooke didn't recognize. Brooke perused the communities "Tippy"
			belonged to. Most of them were musical group communities, a couple of
			fanfiction communities, more importantly, lesbian fanfiction
			communities, and lgbt communities. Sam's gay?! Brooke thought.
			She was shocked. Then again, as she thought about it, she wasn't all
			that surprised. Sam had always marched to her own beat, and didn't
			care about what others thought. It would explain why she got so upset
			that time when they were locked in the Novak, and Lily had confessed
			she'd kissed Carmen. Maybe she'd wished it had been her instead of
			Carmen.</p>
		<p>Brooke thought she should be more upset about this. Sam was gay! Only
			it didn't bother the cheerleader in the least. It wasn't like she
			hadn't ever considered it, but then she'd fallen for Josh again, and
			then Jaime, and then Harrison, so she'd pushed those thoughts from her
			mind. Now she was intrigued. She knew she shouldn't, but she really
			wanted to read this "secret" journal. She got up and crossed her room
			to close her bedroom door. A part of her felt bad for what she was
			about to do, but curiosity seemed to overpower those feelings.</p>
		<p>In all the time she'd known Sam, she'd never been able to figure her
			out, not completely. They'd been living together for almost three
			years, and the brunette was still an enigma. Somehow Sam managed to
			deflect attention away from herself whenever it came to her emotions
			and thoughts, and Brooke hoped that this would give her insight into
			Sam's world, and eventually bring them closer together.</p>
		<p>The blonde checked over her shoulder one last time before clicking the
			link to "Tippy's Journal." The entries had started about three weeks
			after junior prom, back when she'd been dating Harrison. It hurt her
			to read how upset Sam had been about Harrison picking Brooke. It had
			ruined her relationship with Harrison, which was the thing that she'd
			tried to avoid all along. It hadn't done much for her and Brooke's
			relationship in the beginning either. She skipped ahead a few entries,
			not really wanting to dwell on the negative things that had happened.
			She stopped when she found the entries that were about Sam's budding
			sexuality.</p>
		<p>Sam had taken a very journalistic approach on her road of discovery.
			She'd read about it, and watched all of the movies. In fact it seemed
			the only thing Sam had yet to do was put her experiment to practice.
			Brooke ignored the slight feeling of relief she got at that thought.
			She could read all of Sam's frustrations, hopes, concerns, and fears,
			and for a moment, she wanted to walk into the journalist's room and
			wrap her arms around her, but she couldn't. Sam could never know she'd
			found this journal. She was just about to stop reading the entries,
			when she came across a few that caught her attention. It seemed that
			Sam had a crush on someone. She read on, and discovered that whoever
			this mystery girl was, it was someone who went to Kennedy High with
			them. She tried to read the entries closely, looking for hints as to
			who it was. Sam had been very clever in keeping the identity a secret.
			She would only descried a smile that was thrown her way or a faint
			brushing of the hand in the hallway.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Why would I be mad at you?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>The AIM window popped up out of nowhere, earning a startled gasp from
			Brooke.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: You were online and didn't message me. You also
				declined my offer to study together earlier tonight.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Oh...well I only signed on to get the French
				notes for our homework assignment. I wasn't ignoring you, and I'm
				certainly not mad at you. I just really needed to get it done.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Oh ok...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: So, what are you doing? I could be there in two
				shakes, and we could hang out.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke panicked. The last thing she wanted was Sam here as she read
			her diary.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Actually, I'm about to turn in. My test...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: That's right, your test. Say no more...I'll see
				you tomorrow. Goodnight Princess :p</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Goodnight, Mucky :p</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke quickly closed her window, and shut her computer off, just in
			case Sam decided to stop by anyway. She walked down the hall to the
			bathroom to brush her teeth and wash her face. Sam's journal had
			certainly been an eye opener. Tomorrow she was determined to figure
			out who Sam's crush was.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part Two">
		<p>Sam couldn't figure out why Brooke had been looking at her all day.
			Even now as she tried to listen to "The Claw" and take physics notes,
			she could feel the hazel eyes burning a hole in her face. She waited
			until Ms. Glass' attention was turned back towards the board before
			looking over at the blonde in confusion. Brooke just sent her an odd
			smile before turning back to the front. Sam shrugged and continued
			writing.</p>
		<p>The bell rang shortly after that and Sam stood grabbing her bag and
			books. She was heading out of the room towards her locker, when she
			heard Brooke calling her name from behind her. Brooke caught up to her
			as she entered the combination on her lock.</p>
		<p>"Hey are you headed to lunch?" Brooke asked a little winded.</p>
		<p>"Of course, where else would I be going?" Sam asked a little
			suspicious. Something was going on with the cheerleader.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well I didn't know if you had to go to the newspaper office or
			something."</p>
		<p>"Nope, just heading to the cafeteria." Sam replied closing her locker.
			"You coming?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, yeah of course." Brooke answered walking along side the brunette.</p>
		<p>They walked into the cafeteria and got in line followed by Josh and
			Lily. Sam took the proffered sloppy joe, ignoring Lily's look of
			disgust. "If it's any consolation, Lily, I'm pretty sure there's no
			meat in this whatsoever." She said before walking over to their lunch
			table.</p>
		<p>They all now sat at the "Popular" table, having long ago squashed the
			stupid rift that existed between the groups. She knew that was due, in
			large part, to her and Brooke becoming best friends. Sam was forever
			grateful to whatever force had landed them in this place at this time.
			Brooke had proven to be a great friend. Her home life had never been
			better. Her mother and Mike were planning another wedding, and Mac was
			growing up nicely. She was even making slow progress repairing her
			friendship with George. She was just happy she hadn't lost Harrison
			after the whole fiasco last year.</p>
		<p>She sat down in between Brooke and Carmen. The two immediately began
			talking about cheerleading. Sam wasn't really interested in anything
			they had to say, so she spaced, allowing the sweet lilt of Brooke's
			voice to lull her while she ate. She leaned over a little trying to
			catch the scent of Brooke's perfume and shampoo. Spending time as much
			time with Brooke as she now did, afforded her a lot of opportunities,
			benefits that fed and often fueled her little crush. She had finally
			admitted to herself, months ago, that her feelings for Brooke would
			never be sisterly. They were far from anything remotely close to
			sisterly affection.</p>
		<p>Sam would never disrespect her newfound friendship with the blonde,
			but that didn't mean that she didn't take advantage of when the
			opportunity presented itself. She now knew how to get Brooke to smile
			or laugh a certain way, or what cheered her up when she was having a
			bad day. Sam especially liked the last part because it usually ended
			with her receiving a hug for her troubles, and Sam would do just about
			anything to receive one of those warm embraces. The memories had kept
			her company on many a lonely night.</p>
		<p>"Hey ya'll" Mary Cherry said as she and Harrison sat at the table.</p>
		<p>A chorus of 'hey' rang up from the table. Harrison became engrossed
			in the conversation Josh and Sugar were having while Mary Cherry
			joined into the riveting conversation Brooke and Carmen were having
			about routines, leaving Sam to listen to Lily's latest crusade. She
			felt Brooke shift next to her and their thighs brushed against each
			other. She fought hard to bite back the gasp, hoping no one would
			notice. She saw Harrison shoot her an odd look, but smiled back,
			pretending nothing was wrong.</p>
		<p>She ignored the warmth of her body when Brooke reached across her to
			grab a book from Josh, and the slight brushes she was forced to
			endure. Such bittersweet torture, she wished she could just right an
			angsty poem about it and get it out of her system, but she'd tried
			that, and it hadn't worked. She needed something to distract her, and
			Lily's ranting was only making her wish she could bury her head in
			something to drown out the sound. She could think of a few choice
			places her head could be buried at the moment. Having the lurid
			thoughts at the moment was anything but conducive to her current state
			of being. She looked over at the oddity that was Harrison and Mary
			Cherry's relationship. That always did the trick. They were like some
			Maury, 'When Opposites Attract,' topic of the day guests. Never in a
			million years had she ever thought those two would end up together,
			but as she watched Harrison watching Mary Cherry, it somehow fit. He
			brought out a softer side to the blonde cheerleader, and she knew that
			Mary Cherry really loved him.</p>
		<p>He'd been right last year when he'd said that she and Brooke didn't
			really like him, they'd just disliked each other. Well, he'd been half
			right anyway. The only reason she'd even gone after him was because
			Brooke had somehow convinced her to exact revenge on him, but then the
			blonde had changed the rules midstream, and Sam had had no other
			choice but to play along. And now watching as he and Mary Cherry feed
			grapes to one another, she was glad he'd finally 'gotten the girl.'</p>
		<p>She looked over at Brooke, and the blonde offered her a big toothy
			grin. She just for once she could 'get the girl.'</p>
		<p>Sam sat on her bed with her laptop checking her email. Someone had
			responded to one of her posts in one of the communities she belonged
			to. She quickly signed into her clandestine journal and quickly
			replied to the comment. She really needed to post to her journal after
			enduring the day that she had. Brooke continued to stare at her with a
			suspicious look in her eye, and every time she would catch her, the
			blonde would blush and give her a shy smile. Sam wasn't sure how to
			take this new side of Brooke.</p>
		<p>"I guess tonight's post will be rather short. I have a pretty busy
			schedule of vegging to do and I would like to get to it in a hurry.
			School was pretty brutal today, but for more than one reason.. My evil
			physics teacher loaded me down with so much homework it took two hours
			to get through. She is totally heinous. I'm beginning to wonder about
			the mental health of our fair school system that puts these ghastly,
			power hungry, tyrannical dictators in charge of our education.
			Seriously, do they go out of their way to find these people or do they
			just pick them off the street at random.</p>
		<p>The other totally brutal part of my day was the beautiful torture I
			had to do endure from the oblivious object of my affection. She sent
			me sly glances the entire day, not even bothering to hide the fact she
			was caught staring. She just kept giving me these sweet smiles, and
			brushing up against me whenever she was near me. If I didn't already
			have her scent memorized I would have by the end of today. She just
			kept showing up everywhere I turned. I'm not sure if it was a
			coincidence or just the fates trying to play some sort of game with an
			unsuspecting mortal. Either way, if this continues, I don't know how I
			will be able to keep my feelings a secret with her constantly invading
			my every thought, and now every move. I am so totally screwed."</p>
		<p>She clicked the button that would post the entry. She then checked her
			email one last time, before messaging the blonde she'd just written about.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Ready to watch the oh so sexy, pelvis gyrating,
				Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Always...the rents are in bed, and I need the mind numbing
				sex appeal of Mr. Swayze to ease the tension from my very stressful day.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: lol...I wouldn't go that far, but there's just something
				about that movie...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: I know. So why are we still on here talking? I already
				went and got the snacks. Let's just watch it in my room.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: How come we never hang in my room?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: My bed's more comfortable, and like I said, I already
				got the snacks. Besides your room has a funny smell. :p</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Hey!!</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Just get your ass in here, Mucky!</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: On my way, Princess.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>With that, she put her away message up and walked two doors down to
			the blonde's room.</p>
