<!-- Mixed Messages \ Chapter 7: Mary Cherry finally has something of importance to say! (Mark this one in your diaries, folks!) -->

<p>Sam and Brooke were already safely in Bio before Mary Cherry came
hurtling in, careened around the corner and practically fell on
Nicole's lap, panting and salivating over her latest piece of news.
The cheerleader and the journalist watched with mild amusement, but
were not interested and soon returned to their conversation. </p>

<p>"You're beautiful, you know that?" Brooke murmured to Sam, keeping
her eyes ahead. </p>

<p>"Beautiful? Maybe you are, but I wouldn't go that far on me. I'm
more... sort of cute. Like a homeless puppy, I get taken home and
little children ask their mommies if they can keep me. That sort of
cute."</p>

<p>"I think you're gorgeous. Can I keep you?"</p>

<p>"Forever."</p>

<p>The two touched hands briefly under the table, then pulled away so as
not to draw attention to themselves. Brooke looked at Nicole's table
again. Mary Cherry had her mouth close to Nicole's ear and was
whispering frantically, and Nicole's mouth and eyes seemed to be
getting wider by the second. "What do you think is going on there?"
she muttered to the brunette. </p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about it. If Mary Cherry was any dumber, she'd have
to be watered twice a week. What can she possibly have to say that
would be of any importance? And how did she become popular, anyway?
Mysteries of the universe, I guess."</p>

<p>"Not really," Brooke answered wryly. "I'm popular because people
think I'm beautiful, Nicole's popular because she's feared. We're
good examples. I don't know about Mary Cherry... well, if you can't
be a good example, be a horrible warning, I guess."</p>

<p>Sam cracked up laughing, much to the surprise of everyone around
them. They all turned to look, and Brooke had to kick her under the
table to make her stop looking like she was enjoying sitting next to
the blonde. Sobering up immediately, Sam asked again, "What can she
possibly have to say that would make Nicole react like that?"</p>

<p>But they had no further time to ponder it, because Bio Glass walked
in then, and everything but the task in hand (and a little footsie)
had to be put out of their minds. </p>

<p>Bio Glass was one of the mysteries of the world. What gender it
actually was remained to be seen. It put them through their paces for
the duration of the period, and Sam and Brooke were left mentally
exhausted. This was probably why they failed to notice Nicole, Mary
Cherry and Poppy Fresh looking at them strangely as they left the
room together. </p>
