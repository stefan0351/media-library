<!-- Mixed Messages \ Chapter 3: I should be so lucky... lucky, lucky, lucky... -->

<p>Sam couldn't believe her luck. Yesterday she'd been trying to tell
Brooke how she felt and was being avoided. Now, today, she was in
Brooke's arms, crying because she was loved by the one person who
mattered most to her in the world. After at least ten minutes of
crying and hugging, Sam pulled back and regarded Brooke seriously. </p>

<p>"What? Can I help you with something, or are you just going to stare
at me for the rest of the night?"</p>

<p>"Well, see, I was just wondering when you were going to kiss me."</p>

<p>Brooke cut her off. Sitting up on her knees, she leaned close to
Sam's face and put her finger to the brunette's lips, silencing her.
Inches apart, they stared into each other's eyes, and slowly,
millimeter by millimeter, they came closer together...</p>

<p>Brooke didn't think she could stand it much longer, and she was just
about to pounce and put them both out of their misery, when Sam
leaned in and touched their lips together, ever so gently. They both
stayed like that for a second, then they pulled back, reluctantly. </p>

<p>"Did you feel..." "what I felt?"</p>

<p>They both had. For Sam, kissing Brooke felt like liquid fire, and she
knew now that she'd had a taste she was addicted for life. For
Brooke, kissing Sam was the answer to her prayers, the reason things
with Josh were so screwed up, and now that she'd found her she never
wanted to let go. Brooke screwed up her courage and initiated another
kiss, this one much deeper and longer. As they kissed, their mouths
opened and their tongues hesitantly began to explore. </p>

<p>Brooke moaned and her arms snaked up around Sam's neck, playing with
her long and silky brown hair. She began to dominate the kiss,
becoming more and more aggressive and passionate as Sam's hands began
to wander. </p>

<p>Sam let Brooke dominate for now, she had other things to attend to.
Not really thinking about what she was doing, her hands ran up and
down Brooke's spine, causing the blonde delicious shivers. Growing a
little bolder, Sam let one hand roam over Brooke's chest, lightly
cupping one breast. </p>

<p>Brooke gasped. Sam jumped, thinking she'd done something wrong, and
pulled away. "Sorry," she gasped, out of breath. </p>

<p>"For what?" Brooke asked her. Her face was flushed and her hair was
mussed, and Sam didn't think she'd ever looked more beautiful. </p>

<p>"For taking liberties... I shouldn't have touched you... and you
gasped, so I got the message: Don't touch the goods."</p>

<p>"I gasped because I've never felt anything more exciting, Sam.
Nothing with Josh ever felt like this. I want... I want you to keep
going, Sam. Do it again." Brooke's face was red, she was blushing at
her own forwardness, but she needed to say these things. Sam leaned
closer. </p>

<p>"Kiss me," she demanded, and Brooke was only too happy to oblige. </p>

<p>This time Sam completely dominated everything, from the kiss to the
groping. Her tongue explored the deepest recesses of Brooke's mouth,
while her hand, emboldened by Brooke's words, went to her breast
again and squeezed gently. Brooke squealed, and pressed against Sam's
hand. The brunette's thumb came up to caress Brooke's nipple, and
Brooke again squealed, tackling Sam and pinning her to the bed while
covering her face and neck with tiny little kisses. Sam laughed. </p>

<p>"If you liked it that much, Princess, you should have said something!"</p>

<p>"Sammy, I love you! But, don't call me Princess, okay?" Brooke sat
up, smiling down on Sam, and then lay down next to her, snuggling
into Sam's side. Sam put an arm around her and they both sighed in
contentment. </p>

<p>"How about Brookie? Is that all right?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh. Kiss me?"</p>

<p>Sam kissed her on the nose, and then on the lips, prompting another
sigh from Brooke. Then Sam shivered. "You know," she said, "it's kind
of really cold in here. I might, um, go and get into my nice warm
electric-blanket heated bed, if you don't mind too much."</p>

<p>"No, don't leave me here! I'm cold too!"</p>

<p>"I can tell," Sam commented wryly. In fact, from the look of Brooke's
nipples, you'd think that the bedroom was in the Arctic rather
than California. "So come with me," she invited. </p>

<p>"What, you mean sleep in your room?" Brooke queried. "Won't the
parentals think that's a bit... odd?"</p>

<p>"We can tell them we're finally getting over the irrational hatred
thing and we're having a sleep over to... share girly secrets."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled. "I'll share all my girly secrets with you if you'll
share yours with me," she purred, sending Sam a wicked grin. </p>

<p>"Damn, woman, let's get to my room fast, before you jump me in the
hallway!"</p>
