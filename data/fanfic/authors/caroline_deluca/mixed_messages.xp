<chapter title="Chapter 1: Bemused, Befuddled and Bewildered">
<p><i>Sam POV</i></p>

<p>Sam was confused to say the least. Anyone who knew both her and the
cause of her confusion, Brooke McQueen, would have noticed a major
difference in their... relationship... of late.</p>

<p>"All right," Sam admitted. "They would have noticed that
instead of
verbally battling to the death like normal, for the past week and a
half Brooke has been avoiding me like the plague. She hasn't even
insulted my outfit, although God knows Nicole has done enough of that
for the both of them."</p>

<p>Sam was more than confused, she was worried. This whole "not even
surfacing to insult me" thing was uncharacteristic of Brooke, and
much as she was relieved at the absence of verbal sparring (oh, the
pressures of having the perfect comeback every time!) she kind of
missed Brooke.</p>

<p>Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen lived together along with their
respective parents, a mom McPherson and a dad McQueen, and supposedly
hated every minute of it. At least, Brooke did. Sam had at first, but
after six months of fighting over who got the best sink in the
bathroom, she'd given up such trivial problems and really begun
to enjoy having a sister-type person for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>The show of hating Brooke was kept up for Sam's friends and the
rest of the Kennedy populace, but at home Sam had been known to be
civil, sometimes downright friendly to the blonde. It did not,
however, seem to be wearing down Brooke's `hate shield'.
And this, at
times, made Sam sit and feel sorry for herself. But never for more
than five minutes at a time.</p>

<p>"Sam," Sam said to herself (because that's what shecalled
herself
when she talked to herself), "Sam, you've just got to face
it. You
miss Brooke. And not because she was such this great sister or
anything. You miss the little dance your heart and your stomach do
together when you see Brooke."</p>

<p>Sam listened carefully to what she had to say to herself, and then
replied.</p>

<p>"Sam," she began, (see above) "Sam, I think you're
right. Just admit to yourself that Lily's not the only one who
has
questioned her sexuality lately."</p>

<p>This was also true. The thing was, while Lily was still searching for
answers, Sam had reached her conclusion. Conclusions.</p>

<p>She, Samantha McPherson, was gay.</p>

<p>And in love with Brooke McQueen.</p>

<p>Having admitted this to herself, she now asked herself what she would
do next. And the answer?</p>

<p>"I honestly don't know."</p>

<p>The safest course of action would be to a) sleep on it and then b)
track down Brooke and ask her about the avoiding. This in itself
would not be terribly difficult, as they lived in the same house, and
were therefore such with each other for extended periods of time. The
real trick would be getting Brooke to talk to her.</p>

<p>"And that," Sam muttered, "is going to take all of my
considerable
charm."</p>

<p><i>Brooke POV</i></p>

<p>"Shit!" was all Brooke could say. Far from being good at this avoiding thing,
she was discovering from her many near misses just how much she
sucked at it.</p>

<p>This had been the third time today she'd had to run to avoid
being confronted by Sam, this time outside the Novac, and although
she was getting tired of it, she knew she wasn't ready to see Sam
and
have to insult her again.</p>

<p>The way she felt, insulting Sam was the last thing Brooke wanted to
do.</p>

<p>Her `friends' (A/N: if you can call Satan's offspring and
an inbred duck billed platypus friend material!) had noticed nothing
untoward - in fact Nicole had actually praised her on her improved
Spam ignoring techniques.</p>

<p>Brooke couldn't ignore Sam. Not if she tried. And she'd
tried.</p>

<p>"The problem is, Brooke," Brooke said to herself (because
Sam's not the only one who talks to herself!) "is that
you've spent so
much time and energy on this Sam-hating facade and now, when the
tables are finally turned, you're too much of a chicken to admit
maybe
you were wrong, maybe she's not so bad after all."</p>

<p>These revelations had come, Brooke was sad to say, while she was in
the shower after a particularly... um... interesting dream, involving
her and Sam at a cabin in the woods. Just thinking about it made
Brooke need a very sudden dramatic drop in water temperature.</p>

<p>There were only three things she knew for sure these days. 1. She was
in love with Sam. 2. Sam was straight. 3. If Sam found out about
Brooke being in love with her, Brooke could kiss her popularity good-
bye. Not that she cared.</p>

<p>Not that she cared! After having the dream (different locations, same
characters and general content) several times, she realized that just
having Sam in her arms, finding out if she was as good in real life
as in the dreams, was worth a lifetime of lying to herself for false
popularity. And this scared the hell out of her.  So she was avoiding
Sam, putting off the next time when they would be alone together.
Because Brooke knew she wouldn't be able to keep from blurting it
out.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 2: He said, then she said, and then I had to sit down and put my head between my knees...">
<p><i>Sam POV</i></p>

<p>She walked the halls of Kennedy High with her head held high, her
shoulders back and her stride confident. </p>

<p>She felt like such a fraud. </p>

<p>Here she'd made this huge revelation to herself, but she
couldn't admit it to Brooke, who her revelation was (sort of) about.
Her thoughts, judging by that last sentence, were going in crazy
circles. </p>

<p>Actually, she was in the process of rectifying the Brooke situation.
She was trying to track the cheerleader down so as to get to the
bottom of the `avoiding' fiasco. But she wasn't having
much luck. Here it was, the end of the day, and she hadn't been able
to get Brooke alone. So, she reasoned, the only thing left to do was
wait and trap her at home. Eeexcellent! (Picture Mr Burns!)</p>

<p>Sam sat in her last class, Bio, and stared gloomily at her teacher,
Bio Glass. The `woman', and she used the term loosely, made
the class sit alphabetically, so Brooke had no choice but to sit next
to her for the duration. But even though they were forced to share a
biology table, Brooke was sitting as far away from Sam as possible,
looking as if she'd rather be licking Mary Cherry's webbed toes than
be sitting by Sam. Sam, for her part, was trying to sit as normally
as possible, which was hard considering she could almost sense the
hate vibes emanating from Brooke. It was making her feel physically
ill. </p>

<p>Sam sighed. She couldn't wait until they were home so she could put
operation "stop hating me, Brooke" into action. </p>

<p><i>Sam POV</i></p>

<p>It was 9pm on the dot. Tea had been a strained affair, neither girl
speaking nor looking at the other. Of course, they had acted the same
at every meal for the past 10 days!</p>

<p>Now, at 9pm, Sam was pacing the floor of her room, and waiting for
Brooke to come upstairs for bed. An ambush was in store for Brookie
dearest. </p>

<p>9.03. Brooke climbed the stairs reluctantly. She'd tried every
excuse
she could think of, but it was well known in her household that
Brooke McQueen went to bed at 9pm to perform her complicated beauty
routine and get plenty of beauty sleep. Brooke was anxious to avoid
Sam, but not so anxious that she would risk deviating from her set
routine and arousing suspicion. </p>

<p>9.04. Brooke reached her room. She looked around furtively, then
entered. </p>

<p>9.04 and a half. Sam pushed open the door to their adjoining
bathroom, hid behind the shower curtain and waited. </p>

<p>9.05. Brooke pushed open HER door to their bathroom, and walked over
to her sink. Running the cold tap, she splashed water on her face and
began her beauty routine. </p>

<p>9.07. Sam inched her way out from behind the curtain, making her face
visible an inch at a time to Brooke, who tensed. </p>

<p>9.08. Sam spoke. </p>

<p>"Why have you been avoiding me for so long, Brooke? What did I
do?"</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes glazed over in a look of what she hoped desperately
was blank disinterest. "Oh, I'm sorry," she mumbled dully. "I didn't
realize you were in here, I'll come back."</p>

<p>"No!" Sam stamped her foot. "I want to talk to you. I want to
understand this. Is it me? Do I need to up my dose of deodorant?"</p>

<p>This was a pathetic attempt at lightening to mood, and it almost
worked. Brooke's eyes lost that glazed sheen and she nearly smiled. </p>

<p>"No, it's not that" she whispered. </p>

<p>"Then what? Cos... I miss you," Sam finally admitted with a
rush of breath. She looked at the sinks, at the shower head, at her
shoes, anywhere but at Brooke. But out of the corner of her eye, in
the mirror she saw Brooke's face crumple up and then Sam watched the
blonde as she fled from the room in tears. Feeling terrible, Sam
followed her. </p>

<p>Brooke was sitting on her bed in the corner where the two walls met,
crying as if her heart would break. </p>

<p>"Brooke? I'm sorry, but I don't know what I'm sorry for. Can you tell
me why you're crying?" Sam said this in her gentlest voice, fearing
Brooke would run again. But for the first time in 10 days, Brooke
stayed put. And spoke. </p>

<p>"I'm crying because I've got something I need to tell
you, but I can't tell you. Cos, I would never want you to think less
of me,and I could certainly do without the exposé in the school
newspaper that'll be sure to follow."</p>

<p>Sam stared at her. Brooke, having said her piece, buried her head in
her arms and cried harder. </p>

<p>"Are you pregnant, Brooke?"</p>

<p>She shook her head mutely. </p>

<p>"Well, then what?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I can't. I just can't face your reaction."</p>

<p>Something in Sam's head was telling her to pursue this avenue, but
something was telling her that now was perfect confession time, and
boy was it time to fess up. </p>

<p>"Well, if you can't tell me yours, I'll just have to tell you mine.
Because let me tell you something, Brooke. I've been trying to track
you down for the last two days, to tell you something that's been on
my mind for months now, but you keep avoiding me. Since you don't
seem to be going anywhere now, I guess now's the time to tell
you..."</p>

<p>"Tell me what?" Brooke breathed, still crying but not as hard because
her attention was riveted on the brunette. </p>

<p>"Tell you... that I love you..." Sam let out with a burst of breath,
again trying to look anywhere but at the blonde. </p>

<p>Brooke's head snapped up in disbelief and anger. "How dare you," she
ground out. "How dare you read my diary and then openly mock me. Are
you even human at all?"</p>

<p>"What? Read your diary? - that's ridiculous, Brooke. I didn't even
know you kept a diary. I'm telling you the truth, the way I feel
about you. Wait a minute... mocking you? Do you mean you... love me,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Brooke sobbed. "But I know you would never feel the same way,
cos you're straight..."</p>

<p>"I think you've got that backwards, YOU'RE straight, I'M gay, I
thought..."</p>

<p>"Well obviously you thought wrong, because it would appear that we
love each other."</p>

<p>They both paused for breath, each looking at the other warily. Brooke
cracked first. Holding out her arms, she sniffled back fresh tears.
Sam was having trouble containing her own tears. They streamed down
her face as she walked towards Brooke on the bed. When she got there,
she climbed up on the bed and into Brooke's waiting arms. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 3: I should be so lucky... lucky, lucky, lucky...">
<p>Sam couldn't believe her luck. Yesterday she'd been trying to tell
Brooke how she felt and was being avoided. Now, today, she was in
Brooke's arms, crying because she was loved by the one person who
mattered most to her in the world. After at least ten minutes of
crying and hugging, Sam pulled back and regarded Brooke seriously. </p>

<p>"What? Can I help you with something, or are you just going to stare
at me for the rest of the night?"</p>

<p>"Well, see, I was just wondering when you were going to kiss me."</p>

<p>Brooke cut her off. Sitting up on her knees, she leaned close to
Sam's face and put her finger to the brunette's lips, silencing her.
Inches apart, they stared into each other's eyes, and slowly,
millimeter by millimeter, they came closer together...</p>

<p>Brooke didn't think she could stand it much longer, and she was just
about to pounce and put them both out of their misery, when Sam
leaned in and touched their lips together, ever so gently. They both
stayed like that for a second, then they pulled back, reluctantly. </p>

<p>"Did you feel..." "what I felt?"</p>

<p>They both had. For Sam, kissing Brooke felt like liquid fire, and she
knew now that she'd had a taste she was addicted for life. For
Brooke, kissing Sam was the answer to her prayers, the reason things
with Josh were so screwed up, and now that she'd found her she never
wanted to let go. Brooke screwed up her courage and initiated another
kiss, this one much deeper and longer. As they kissed, their mouths
opened and their tongues hesitantly began to explore. </p>

<p>Brooke moaned and her arms snaked up around Sam's neck, playing with
her long and silky brown hair. She began to dominate the kiss,
becoming more and more aggressive and passionate as Sam's hands began
to wander. </p>

<p>Sam let Brooke dominate for now, she had other things to attend to.
Not really thinking about what she was doing, her hands ran up and
down Brooke's spine, causing the blonde delicious shivers. Growing a
little bolder, Sam let one hand roam over Brooke's chest, lightly
cupping one breast. </p>

<p>Brooke gasped. Sam jumped, thinking she'd done something wrong, and
pulled away. "Sorry," she gasped, out of breath. </p>

<p>"For what?" Brooke asked her. Her face was flushed and her hair was
mussed, and Sam didn't think she'd ever looked more beautiful. </p>

<p>"For taking liberties... I shouldn't have touched you... and you
gasped, so I got the message: Don't touch the goods."</p>

<p>"I gasped because I've never felt anything more exciting, Sam.
Nothing with Josh ever felt like this. I want... I want you to keep
going, Sam. Do it again." Brooke's face was red, she was blushing at
her own forwardness, but she needed to say these things. Sam leaned
closer. </p>

<p>"Kiss me," she demanded, and Brooke was only too happy to oblige. </p>

<p>This time Sam completely dominated everything, from the kiss to the
groping. Her tongue explored the deepest recesses of Brooke's mouth,
while her hand, emboldened by Brooke's words, went to her breast
again and squeezed gently. Brooke squealed, and pressed against Sam's
hand. The brunette's thumb came up to caress Brooke's nipple, and
Brooke again squealed, tackling Sam and pinning her to the bed while
covering her face and neck with tiny little kisses. Sam laughed. </p>

<p>"If you liked it that much, Princess, you should have said something!"</p>

<p>"Sammy, I love you! But, don't call me Princess, okay?" Brooke sat
up, smiling down on Sam, and then lay down next to her, snuggling
into Sam's side. Sam put an arm around her and they both sighed in
contentment. </p>

<p>"How about Brookie? Is that all right?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh. Kiss me?"</p>

<p>Sam kissed her on the nose, and then on the lips, prompting another
sigh from Brooke. Then Sam shivered. "You know," she said, "it's kind
of really cold in here. I might, um, go and get into my nice warm
electric-blanket heated bed, if you don't mind too much."</p>

<p>"No, don't leave me here! I'm cold too!"</p>

<p>"I can tell," Sam commented wryly. In fact, from the look of Brooke's
nipples, you'd think that the bedroom was in the Arctic rather
than California. "So come with me," she invited. </p>

<p>"What, you mean sleep in your room?" Brooke queried. "Won't the
parentals think that's a bit... odd?"</p>

<p>"We can tell them we're finally getting over the irrational hatred
thing and we're having a sleep over to... share girly secrets."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled. "I'll share all my girly secrets with you if you'll
share yours with me," she purred, sending Sam a wicked grin. </p>

<p>"Damn, woman, let's get to my room fast, before you jump me in the
hallway!"</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 4: Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining, this is the night... when Brooke sleeps over in Sam's room">
<p>They ran to Sam's room, stopping only to grab Brooke's pillow. Upon
reaching the holy land, they sprinted inside and jumped onto the bed,
laughing as the blankets got hideously mussed. But they didn't care.
All they cared about was getting warm. Together. </p>

<p>Pushing Brooke off of her, Sam remade the bed as quickly as she
could, then climbed in. Brooke kind of stood there, not sure whether
she should climb in with Sam or pull out the mattress and sleep on
the floor. Sam solved her dilemma by saying, "Are you getting in? Cos
I don't plan on holding the blankets open for you all night."</p>

<p>Brooke slid into bed beside Sam, suddenly unsure of herself. She lay
down, but held herself stiffly. She'd never spent the night in
another girls bed when she'd just kissed them senseless. Sam was
making everything easier, and this was no different. She curled up by
Brooke, and nuzzled her head into the blonde's shoulder, smelling the
sweet smell of Brooke's hair. Brooke relaxed, and put her arm around
Sam's waist. </p>

<p>"Are we gonna talk about anything?" Sam asked, still wide awake. It
was only a quarter to 10, after all. Brooke looked at her, and sighed
happily. </p>

<p>"I love you," she whispered. Sam smiled into her shoulder. </p>

<p>"I love you too," she replied, meaning it. For Sam, this was the
first time she'd actually been in love. Sure, she'd had a thing for
Harrison for a while there, but nothing like this. This felt real.
Brooke had been in love, but it was not the kind of lone meant to be
consummated, and the fact that she and Josh had, had ruined the
relationship. With Sam, Brooke felt safe. </p>

<p>"What do you wanna talk about?" Brooke asked, softly. They were
already beginning to calm down a bit, enjoy each other's company, and
just drift off. </p>

<p>"Us, I guess. Why we always hated each other. What we're gonna do
now. And-"</p>

<p>Brooke cut her off by kissing her firmly, and then she said, "Quiet.
We're together, and that's all that matters now. Everything else will
all fall into place. It has to."</p>

<p>Sam smiled into Brooke's second kiss. Everything was going to be
fine, that was for sure. Brooke got adventurous, her hand seeking the
hem of Sam's pajama top, and upon finding it, she began to work her
hand under it, feeling the taut skin of Sam's stomach, and working
her way higher. Sam froze, not wanting to move for fear she would
stop. She didn't. When her hand felt the underside of Sam's left
breast, Brooke began to caress it, while Sam melted into her hands
and shuddered in delight. </p>

<p>Feeling incredibly sleepy, but not wanting to miss a moment of
Brooke's tentative exploration, Sam forced her eyes open and let
her own hands wander once more. Her left hand found Brooke's butt and
smoothed over the curve, squeezing gently. Brooke giggled, and
pressed her butt into Sam, wanting more. Sam wanted more, as well.
She arched into Brooke's hands as she traced the line of Brooke's
inner thigh, winding upwards, then abruptly changing direction,
prompting a murmur of disappointment from the blonde. </p>

<p>"What, you wanna go all the way on the first night? Why Miss McQueen,
you little skank, you!"</p>

<p>"I just love you, that's all, and I want you to do anything you want
to do to me," Brooke replied, seriously. But she settled down, and
snuggled her head over Sam's, breathing in the strawberry-banana
smell of the brunette's favorite shampoo. She suddenly felt very
sleepy and contented, and it could have had a lot to do with the
brunette lying beside her. Thinking of how incredibly lucky she was,
Brooke gently drifted into sleep. </p>

<p>Sam felt the same way, and joined Brooke in sleep less than five
minutes later. Slumbering peacefully, they stayed asleep until the
alarm clock buzzed at half past seven the next morning. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 5: Uh, oh, Spaghetti O's!">
<p>Brooke opened her eyes slowly to an annoying sound that she couldn't
quite place, and looked around. There was something not quite right
about her surroundings, but she couldn't place that either, until her
brain registered the warm weight beside her on the bed. Actually, the
warm weight was sort of half on top of her, but seven thirty in the
morning is too early for details. </p>

<p>Finally she clicked. She was in Sam's room, and that sound was Sam's
alarm clock, and that warm lump was Sam herself! They'd slept
together last night, in the actual sense of the word, rather than
actually had sex, but Brooke still felt... satisfied. Like she'd
finally got what she wanted, and in a sense, she had, hadn't she?</p>

<p>Sam opened her eyes to see Brooke staring at her. It didn't register
with her, either, until she felt where Brooke's hand was: inside her
pajama top! And with that in mind, she reached over and kissed Brooke
on the forehead and jumped out of bed, suddenly energized beyond
belief. </p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke moaned. "Come back to bed." But Sam laughed and ignored
her, pulling off her pajamas and heading for the shower. </p>

<p>"School day, McQueen, or had you forgotten?"</p>

<p>Brooke groaned. "Selective memory," she giggled. "You hoping for that
shower solo, or are visitors welcome?"</p>

<p>"Visitors are always welcome if they're you," Sam purred. </p>

<p>Having showered (together) and dressed (reluctantly) the two bounced
down the stairs. Breakfast was fun. Making pancakes was so much more
fun with two! They made enough to feed the whole house, then settled
down to eat them. They sat across the table from each other like
usual. Sending each other sultry looks and playing footsie, they
bolted their food and prepared to leave for school about twenty
minutes early, so as to get in a spot of necking in the car before
school. This plan was cut to ribbons by Jane McPherson's appearance
in the doorway. </p>

<p>"You about to leave, girls?"</p>

<p>Sam gave her mother her biggest smile. This was the last nail in
their coffin, Jane thought to herself. She knew something was up, and
the change in Sam from yesterday's moping to today's beaming was even
more of a giveaway than what she'd seen last night. </p>

<p>"Yep! Brookie's just agreed to give me a ride to school, isn't that
nice of her?"</p>

<p>"But if we don't hurry, Sammy, we'll be late. Gotta beat that
traffic!" Brooke replied, equally chirpy. They prepared to bounce out
the door, but Jane stopped them. </p>

<p>"All right, you two. This has gone far enough. Do you want to tell me
what's going on, or do you want me to tell you what I know?"</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke stopped in their tracks. Turning around, Sam said,
carefully, "Why don't you tell us what you know."</p>

<p>Jane took a deep breath and began. "Okay. Well, for starters, your
behavior over the past couple weeks has been baffling. One day you're
fighting like cats and dogs, next thing Brooke's avoiding Sam. And
you think I didn't notice?"</p>

<p>The pair nodded. So far, so disturbing... </p>

<p>"And then today? Big smiles? And what did you have for breakfast, to
be calling each other by PET NAMES? Brookie? Sammy? Where did that
come from? But the thing that is the most damning, by a long shot, is
probably the fact that I noticed Brooke's bed wasn't slept in last
night. Hoping against hope you two were having a friendly sleep over,
I checked your room, Sam. And what did I find but the two of you,
dead to the world, in the same bed?"</p>

<p>"Mom, it's hardly fair to make Brooke sleep on the floor. She
volunteered to leave her room, just so we could have a... girly chat
sleep over. So I said to her, we're both adults, I think we can share
the bed. I share beds with Lily and Carmen all the time! Hell, I even
used to share a bed with Harrison, and you didn't care! What's the
big deal?"</p>

<p>"Since I obviously haven't got my point across well enough, I'll tell
you what the big deal is. I would have been fine with a `girly chat
sleep over', but how many `girly chat sleep overs' have you been to
where you fall asleep with your hands up each other's tops?"</p>

<p>Busted. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 6: How many times can you be busted in one morning?!?">
<p>"Well, it's like this, Mom," Sam began. </p>

<p>"No, let me," interrupted Brooke. "Jane, I'm in love with your
daughter. She, to my great surprise and joy, feels the same way about
me. We are an item, as of last night. Is this going to be a problem?"</p>

<p>Sam and Jane stared at her, dumbstruck. Sam had had no idea she would
blurt it out like that. Frankly, neither had Jane. Opening and
closing her mouth, but hearing no sound come out, she looked to Sam.
She trusted her daughter, and whatever she said would set the tone
for her entire response. </p>

<p>"Mom, I love you, and I want very much for you to accept this. If
you're not okay with it, then I don't think I can be happy. And at
the moment, mom, I am really happy. More than I've been in a long
time. I think Brooke is really going to make me feel happier than I
ever could on my own. She already is."</p>

<p>Finally, Jane found her voice. "Sam, you know I love you and I'll
support you in anything you want to do," she began. Sam and Brooke
had a sinking feeling there was going to be a `but'. </p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>Yep, there it went. </p>

<p>"But this is a lot to throw on a person first thing in the morning.
I'm going to use your time at school to think about it, okay? And
when you get home I'll tell you whether I'm okay with it, or whether
Sam and I need to move to Alaska. Does that sound all right?"</p>

<p>To Sam and Brooke, this was not a no. That meant it was okay with
them. Both hugging her, they bounded out the door and to school. The
ride was normal as ever, except maybe for Sam's hand taking up semi-
permanent residence on Brooke's thigh. All in all, they made it to
school in one piece, and even ten minutes before first bell, so they
looked around for a place to make out. </p>

<p>The Novac was suggested and just as quickly disregarded, as it was
the stomping ground of Nicole and her cronies for much of the school
day. It would just not do to be caught by them, not at this stage in
their relationship. A list of locations ran through both of their
heads, until Sam suggested the newspaper office, which was officially
closed until at lease third period. It took all of twenty seconds for
them to get there and barricade themselves in. Then they turned to
each other and...</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I've missed this," Brooke gasped in between frantic kisses. </p>

<p>"Missed this? We've only been together all morning! And the last time
we kissed was..."</p>

<p>"Too long ago," Brooke moaned, tracing the line of Sam's lips with
her tongue, begging for entrance. Sam gave up and let her in, both of
them gasping with the sheer pleasure of being in each other's arms.
Brooke's hands started to wander, but Sam stopped her. </p>

<p>"None of that, Brookie," she warned. "I'm like a can of Pringles.
Once you pop, you can't stop."</p>

<p>"Who says I want to stop?"</p>

<p>"Neither do I," panted Sam. But we've got to get to class, and if we
don't want everyone to know what we've been doing, we're going to
have to pay a visit to the Novac to clean ourselves up."</p>

<p>Pouting prettily, Brooke let her go. They straightened themselves up
the best they could, and then opened the door and headed for the
Novac. Meanwhile...</p>

<p>Mary Cherry stood a little way from the newspaper office, out of
sight of it. She was open mouthed, wide eyed, and web-toed (is that
even a word?), and she'd heard everything, including assorted moans.
Gathering what faculties she still had left (and her webbed toes) she
raced off to find Nicole. In `tahmes of need', Mary Cherry still
turned to the age old chain of command, which involved passing all
such information to their beloved leader and benefactor, Nicole
Julian. </p>

<p>"May Gahd have mercy on their souls," Mary Cherry murmured to
herself, rubbing her web-fingered hands together in glee. Did I
mention that Mary Cherry is inbred and web-toed (and fingered?!)</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 7: Mary Cherry finally has something of importance to say! (Mark this one in your diaries, folks!)">
<p>Sam and Brooke were already safely in Bio before Mary Cherry came
hurtling in, careened around the corner and practically fell on
Nicole's lap, panting and salivating over her latest piece of news.
The cheerleader and the journalist watched with mild amusement, but
were not interested and soon returned to their conversation. </p>

<p>"You're beautiful, you know that?" Brooke murmured to Sam, keeping
her eyes ahead. </p>

<p>"Beautiful? Maybe you are, but I wouldn't go that far on me. I'm
more... sort of cute. Like a homeless puppy, I get taken home and
little children ask their mommies if they can keep me. That sort of
cute."</p>

<p>"I think you're gorgeous. Can I keep you?"</p>

<p>"Forever."</p>

<p>The two touched hands briefly under the table, then pulled away so as
not to draw attention to themselves. Brooke looked at Nicole's table
again. Mary Cherry had her mouth close to Nicole's ear and was
whispering frantically, and Nicole's mouth and eyes seemed to be
getting wider by the second. "What do you think is going on there?"
she muttered to the brunette. </p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about it. If Mary Cherry was any dumber, she'd have
to be watered twice a week. What can she possibly have to say that
would be of any importance? And how did she become popular, anyway?
Mysteries of the universe, I guess."</p>

<p>"Not really," Brooke answered wryly. "I'm popular because people
think I'm beautiful, Nicole's popular because she's feared. We're
good examples. I don't know about Mary Cherry... well, if you can't
be a good example, be a horrible warning, I guess."</p>

<p>Sam cracked up laughing, much to the surprise of everyone around
them. They all turned to look, and Brooke had to kick her under the
table to make her stop looking like she was enjoying sitting next to
the blonde. Sobering up immediately, Sam asked again, "What can she
possibly have to say that would make Nicole react like that?"</p>

<p>But they had no further time to ponder it, because Bio Glass walked
in then, and everything but the task in hand (and a little footsie)
had to be put out of their minds. </p>

<p>Bio Glass was one of the mysteries of the world. What gender it
actually was remained to be seen. It put them through their paces for
the duration of the period, and Sam and Brooke were left mentally
exhausted. This was probably why they failed to notice Nicole, Mary
Cherry and Poppy Fresh looking at them strangely as they left the
room together. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 8: Oh, my Gahd!">
<p>Nicole had known something was up. </p>

<p>There had been such a change in Brookie, for the better, if you asked
her. And now, she was reverting to her old, wimpy, let's be nice to
Spam ways. Well, thought Nicole, if you asked her, it stunk. </p>

<p>As Mary Cherry nattered in her ear, she wondered how she could have
missed it. Brookie was in love with Spam! It made perfect sense, now
she thought about it. And she was thinking about it. </p>

<p>"Oh, my Gahd, Nic," MC blurted. "You'll never believe what Ah just
witnessed with mah own two Gahd given eyes!"</p>

<p>"What, there's a sale at Saks?" Nicole had asked, disinterestedly. </p>

<p>"No, much more worse than that," MC panted. "Ah have just witnessed
the downfahl of our dear Brookie, to that dreadful Ms. McPherson. As
Ah was standing outsahde the newspaper office, Ah did happen to see
the two in question slip insahde, and they did seem in a mahty hurry,
if you know what Ah mean," she explained. </p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"AND, Ah then heard the most... incriminatin' bunch o' sounds Ah
think Ah'll ever hear. Moanin' and gaspin' like nobody's business.
Well," she amended, "nobodies but ours, Nic."</p>

<p>"So what, Mary Cherry? Is there a point you'd like to get to sometime
soon?"</p>

<p>"Mah point IS, Nicole, our dearly beloved Brookie was obviously
pressured into the swappin' of salivah with Spam McPherson," Mary
Cherry finished in a whisper. </p>

<p>Nicole bolted upright. "You mean..."</p>

<p>"Yes. Brookie is no longer playing for our team, and it is our Gahd
given duty to bring her back to the fold," Mary Cherry recited
righteously. However, Nicole was no longer listening. Brookie was
gay? And in love with Spam? What was the world coming to? But if she
thought about it (and as Mary Cherry babbled on, she did think about
it, extensively) it made sense, given her behavior this past couple
weeks. First with the flawless avoiding, and then with the spaced out
thing? Nicole had known something was up, but this? Well, she would
have to do something about it. </p>

<p>The bell rang and she jumped up from her chair, interrupting Mary
Cherry in mid rant and stormed from the room, leaving Mary Cherry to
scuttle along behind her. Where was Nicole heading? For the newspaper
office. She had a feeling that Brookie and her newest `love' might
return to the scene of the crime. Thinking that, she abruptly spun
around to face Mary Cherry, who skidded to a halt and waited for her
instructions. </p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, go to our next class and make our apologies."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Nic, but whose apologies am Ah making?"</p>

<p>"Mine, Brookie's... and Spam's."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry spun and hurried in the opposite direction, anxious to
follow the orders to the letter. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 9: And the mighty wrath of Brooke descended upon her...">
<p>Nicole hurried to the newspaper office, fearing the worst. And boy,
did she get it.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke gasped, "we need to find a safer place to do this."</p>

<p>Sam was too busy sucking on Brooke's nipple to reply. Brooke gave up
the fight and let her head loll back, letting the sensations wash
over her, when there was a timid rap at the door. Both froze. </p>

<p>"If we don't move, they'll think no one's here," Sam hissed. Brooke
nodded, frantically trying to get her top done up. The rap sounded
again, followed by Nicole's voice. "Brookie? Mary Cherry saw you go
in there, and I need to talk to you alone, so I thought I'd follow
you in."</p>

<p>Sam looked around for a hiding place just as the door handle started
to turn, spotted the desk and dived under with only a split second to
spare. Nicole walked into the office, and spying Brooke, went to
stand in front of her. She'd heard all manner of strange noises, some
of which she recognized as Brooke's pleasure, some of which she
reasoned must be Spam. But now was not the time to focus on that. </p>

<p>"Brookie, tell me the truth. Why have you been so down lately?"</p>

<p>Brooke gaped at her, then rearranged her face into what she hoped was
depression. "Just the usual," she said, eyes downcast. "Unrequited
love, feeling fat, and just family shit."</p>

<p>Nicole's eyes narrowed. "You're twig thin, your family shouldn't
bother you because the McPhersons are NOT a part of it, and as for
unrequited love, Brookie, you can have any guy in this school. In
this state, for God's state. So what's the problem?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I don't want any GUY in this school," Brooke muttered under
her breath. Nicole pretended not to hear. </p>

<p>"Okay, here's what I'm going to say to you. I know who you've been
pining away for, and I've got witnesses who can place you with said
person, doing things I'm sure you don't want spread over school, so
perhaps it's time you actually told me the truth."</p>

<p>Brooke suddenly couldn't remember what had possessed her to keep
Nicole Julian as her best friend for so long. Sam was a better friend
than Nicole would ever be, and not that she'd kissed Nicole, but she
imagined Sam was a better kisser, too. "I don't have to justify
myself to you!" Brooke spat. "I don't know what you think you know,
but if it's the truth, I'm certainly not going to deny it!"</p>

<p>"So you won't deny that you're in love with your soon-to-be-
stepsister, Spammie the luncheon meat McPherson."</p>

<p>Sam, listening hard under the table, found herself holding her
breath, waiting for Brooke's response. </p>

<p>"No, I'm not going to deny that. I love Samantha McPherson, do you
have a problem with that? And she loves me, and we are an item, and
her name is SAM, not Spam. So stop calling her Spam!" Brooke was
right in Nicole's face now, her every word bit off clearly and
angrily. Sam burst into tears. Brooke wasn't afraid of telling
Nicole? Well, then, neither was she. She slowly crawled out from
under the table, but stopped when she heard Nicole's next words. </p>

<p>"Brookie, why? Why her, when you could have had..." she trailed off.
Sam decided to stay where she was. Something was about to be spilled. </p>

<p>"Could have had who, Nicole? Which poor dumb guy were you planning to
set me up with? After Josh, which guy could you possibly deem worthy
of your presence, let alone mine? Well here's a newsflash, Nicole. I.
AM. GAY. And nothing you try to do is going to turn me away from Sam,
because I really do love her. So what? What were you going to say,
Nicole?" </p>

<p>Brooke's voice had turned threatening, and Nicole wasn't sure she
wanted to continue this conversation now. Hell, even Sam, under the
table, was glad it wasn't her who had to face the wrath of Brooke.
But the barn door was open, and the horse had well and truly bolted,
so Nicole mustered her strength and blurted it out. </p>

<p>"You could have had me," she blurted, starting to cry. "You could
have had me, and you didn't even notice that all this time we
were  friends, I've had a gigantic crush on you, did you? No, you
were too busy pining away for everyone and anyone else! All those
popstars, all guys, and then Josh, conveniently the star of the
football team, also conveniently male, and now Sam, who is the first
female crush you've had. But why her, Brooke? Why... not... me?"</p>

<p>Nicole was sobbing now, her shoulders heaving with the effort to
control herself. She slid to her knees, her hands over her face and
gulped and sniffled as she finally succeeded in gaining control. Then
she looked up, because Brooke was speaking.</p>

<p>"You're gay?" she asked, incredulously. Of all the things Nicole
could have said, this was the last thing she had expected. And she
wasn't sure if she was at all happy about this new development. </p>

<p>"Yes, I'm gay, and I'm in love with you," Nicole spat, having
progressed past despair to anger. Anger, she did well. "What are you
going to say, Brooke? You pity me now? Well? What are you going to
say?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to say... I don't know. What do you say to something like
that?"</p>

<p>"Well, ideally, you say you love me too, but I guess that's not going
to happen, so I guess all we're left with is finding out who is
better, Brooke. Who is better out of Sam and me?"</p>

<p>Brooke started to back away. "No, Nicole, I'm not doing this. I love
Sam, and I don't want to cheat on her. I'm not going to kiss you."</p>

<p>Hot tears sprang to Nicole's eyes, but she choked them back, and was
about to retort when out of the corner of her eye she saw Sam crawl
out from under the desk. "What the fuck?" she gasped. "Spam's been
here the whole time? Probably recording everything, so she could do a
fucking exposé in the newspaper on Monday."</p>

<p>"No," Sam said. "I heard everything, but I'll never tell. And I have
to admit, I'm kind of curious. I want you to kiss her, Brooke. So you
can never say to me, I wonder what would have happened if I'd kissed
her. You'll know. Just do it."</p>

<p>There wasn't a trace of sadness or fear in Sam's voice, just genuine
curiosity. Brooke nodded, and this time when Nicole approached her,
she didn't back away. "Just once," Brooke clarified. "And when it's
over, I'm still going to be with Sam. Nothing will change that."</p>

<p>"Okay," Nicole agreed. When their lips touched, Sam was watching them
carefully. Nicole's eyes closed instantly, and she leaned into
Brooke, savoring the moment. Brooke's eyes stayed open, and they
seemed to be sending a message to Sam. &amp;lt;I wish this was you,&amp;gt; they
said. &amp;lt;Only you.&amp;gt;</p>

<p>The blondes broke apart a second later, and looked at each other.
Nicole, for once, was speechless, but Brooke had plenty to say. </p>

<p>"Okay. We kissed. It was okay, but I still love Sam. I don't want to
upset you or anything, but I think she's a better kisser than you.
That could be because I love her, but oh well. And now, since you
made Sam watch that, and I don't care how okay she says she is with
it, it must have hurt her just a little, since you made her watch it,
I think it's only fair you see us kiss, so there's no mistakes. So
you'll know how much we love each other, and you won't try any of
your schemes to break us up."</p>

<p>She walked over and put her arms around Sam's waist, and felt Sam's
arms snake around her neck. As soon as their lips touched, everything
around them dropped away, leaving only the two of them in the room.
Nicole watched enviously, but when Brooke's hand came up to cup Sam's
breast and tweak her nipple, Nicole left. The last thing she heard
was Sam's rapturous groan. </p>

<p>"...I know there's nothing worse/than unrequited love" The Corrs,
Love to Love You</p>

<p>And as Nicole walked down the hall to her next class, the one Mary
Cherry had got her out of, the one she was hideously late for, she
cried, just a little, for the happiness that would never be hers. </p>

<p>"I guess the better woman won, Spammie. You better treat my Brookie
right."</p>
