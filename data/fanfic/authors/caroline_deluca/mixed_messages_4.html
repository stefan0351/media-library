<!-- Mixed Messages \ Chapter 4: Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining, this is the night... when Brooke sleeps over in Sam's room -->

<p>They ran to Sam's room, stopping only to grab Brooke's pillow. Upon
reaching the holy land, they sprinted inside and jumped onto the bed,
laughing as the blankets got hideously mussed. But they didn't care.
All they cared about was getting warm. Together. </p>

<p>Pushing Brooke off of her, Sam remade the bed as quickly as she
could, then climbed in. Brooke kind of stood there, not sure whether
she should climb in with Sam or pull out the mattress and sleep on
the floor. Sam solved her dilemma by saying, "Are you getting in? Cos
I don't plan on holding the blankets open for you all night."</p>

<p>Brooke slid into bed beside Sam, suddenly unsure of herself. She lay
down, but held herself stiffly. She'd never spent the night in
another girls bed when she'd just kissed them senseless. Sam was
making everything easier, and this was no different. She curled up by
Brooke, and nuzzled her head into the blonde's shoulder, smelling the
sweet smell of Brooke's hair. Brooke relaxed, and put her arm around
Sam's waist. </p>

<p>"Are we gonna talk about anything?" Sam asked, still wide awake. It
was only a quarter to 10, after all. Brooke looked at her, and sighed
happily. </p>

<p>"I love you," she whispered. Sam smiled into her shoulder. </p>

<p>"I love you too," she replied, meaning it. For Sam, this was the
first time she'd actually been in love. Sure, she'd had a thing for
Harrison for a while there, but nothing like this. This felt real.
Brooke had been in love, but it was not the kind of lone meant to be
consummated, and the fact that she and Josh had, had ruined the
relationship. With Sam, Brooke felt safe. </p>

<p>"What do you wanna talk about?" Brooke asked, softly. They were
already beginning to calm down a bit, enjoy each other's company, and
just drift off. </p>

<p>"Us, I guess. Why we always hated each other. What we're gonna do
now. And-"</p>

<p>Brooke cut her off by kissing her firmly, and then she said, "Quiet.
We're together, and that's all that matters now. Everything else will
all fall into place. It has to."</p>

<p>Sam smiled into Brooke's second kiss. Everything was going to be
fine, that was for sure. Brooke got adventurous, her hand seeking the
hem of Sam's pajama top, and upon finding it, she began to work her
hand under it, feeling the taut skin of Sam's stomach, and working
her way higher. Sam froze, not wanting to move for fear she would
stop. She didn't. When her hand felt the underside of Sam's left
breast, Brooke began to caress it, while Sam melted into her hands
and shuddered in delight. </p>

<p>Feeling incredibly sleepy, but not wanting to miss a moment of
Brooke's tentative exploration, Sam forced her eyes open and let
her own hands wander once more. Her left hand found Brooke's butt and
smoothed over the curve, squeezing gently. Brooke giggled, and
pressed her butt into Sam, wanting more. Sam wanted more, as well.
She arched into Brooke's hands as she traced the line of Brooke's
inner thigh, winding upwards, then abruptly changing direction,
prompting a murmur of disappointment from the blonde. </p>

<p>"What, you wanna go all the way on the first night? Why Miss McQueen,
you little skank, you!"</p>

<p>"I just love you, that's all, and I want you to do anything you want
to do to me," Brooke replied, seriously. But she settled down, and
snuggled her head over Sam's, breathing in the strawberry-banana
smell of the brunette's favorite shampoo. She suddenly felt very
sleepy and contented, and it could have had a lot to do with the
brunette lying beside her. Thinking of how incredibly lucky she was,
Brooke gently drifted into sleep. </p>

<p>Sam felt the same way, and joined Brooke in sleep less than five
minutes later. Slumbering peacefully, they stayed asleep until the
alarm clock buzzed at half past seven the next morning. </p>
