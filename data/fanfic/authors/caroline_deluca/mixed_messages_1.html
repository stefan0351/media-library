<p><i>Sam POV</i></p>

<p>Sam was confused to say the least. Anyone who knew both her and the
cause of her confusion, Brooke McQueen, would have noticed a major
difference in their... relationship... of late.</p>

<p>"All right," Sam admitted. "They would have noticed that
instead of
verbally battling to the death like normal, for the past week and a
half Brooke has been avoiding me like the plague. She hasn't even
insulted my outfit, although God knows Nicole has done enough of that
for the both of them."</p>

<p>Sam was more than confused, she was worried. This whole "not even
surfacing to insult me" thing was uncharacteristic of Brooke, and
much as she was relieved at the absence of verbal sparring (oh, the
pressures of having the perfect comeback every time!) she kind of
missed Brooke.</p>

<p>Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen lived together along with their
respective parents, a mom McPherson and a dad McQueen, and supposedly
hated every minute of it. At least, Brooke did. Sam had at first, but
after six months of fighting over who got the best sink in the
bathroom, she'd given up such trivial problems and really begun
to enjoy having a sister-type person for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>The show of hating Brooke was kept up for Sam's friends and the
rest of the Kennedy populace, but at home Sam had been known to be
civil, sometimes downright friendly to the blonde. It did not,
however, seem to be wearing down Brooke's `hate shield'.
And this, at
times, made Sam sit and feel sorry for herself. But never for more
than five minutes at a time.</p>

<p>"Sam," Sam said to herself (because that's what shecalled
herself
when she talked to herself), "Sam, you've just got to face
it. You
miss Brooke. And not because she was such this great sister or
anything. You miss the little dance your heart and your stomach do
together when you see Brooke."</p>

<p>Sam listened carefully to what she had to say to herself, and then
replied.</p>

<p>"Sam," she began, (see above) "Sam, I think you're
right. Just admit to yourself that Lily's not the only one who
has
questioned her sexuality lately."</p>

<p>This was also true. The thing was, while Lily was still searching for
answers, Sam had reached her conclusion. Conclusions.</p>

<p>She, Samantha McPherson, was gay.</p>

<p>And in love with Brooke McQueen.</p>

<p>Having admitted this to herself, she now asked herself what she would
do next. And the answer?</p>

<p>"I honestly don't know."</p>

<p>The safest course of action would be to a) sleep on it and then b)
track down Brooke and ask her about the avoiding. This in itself
would not be terribly difficult, as they lived in the same house, and
were therefore such with each other for extended periods of time. The
real trick would be getting Brooke to talk to her.</p>

<p>"And that," Sam muttered, "is going to take all of my
considerable
charm."</p>

<p><i>Brooke POV</i></p>

<p>"Shit!" was all Brooke could say. Far from being good at this avoiding thing,
she was discovering from her many near misses just how much she
sucked at it.</p>

<p>This had been the third time today she'd had to run to avoid
being confronted by Sam, this time outside the Novac, and although
she was getting tired of it, she knew she wasn't ready to see Sam
and
have to insult her again.</p>

<p>The way she felt, insulting Sam was the last thing Brooke wanted to
do.</p>

<p>Her `friends' (A/N: if you can call Satan's offspring and
an inbred duck billed platypus friend material!) had noticed nothing
untoward - in fact Nicole had actually praised her on her improved
Spam ignoring techniques.</p>

<p>Brooke couldn't ignore Sam. Not if she tried. And she'd
tried.</p>

<p>"The problem is, Brooke," Brooke said to herself (because
Sam's not the only one who talks to herself!) "is that
you've spent so
much time and energy on this Sam-hating facade and now, when the
tables are finally turned, you're too much of a chicken to admit
maybe
you were wrong, maybe she's not so bad after all."</p>

<p>These revelations had come, Brooke was sad to say, while she was in
the shower after a particularly... um... interesting dream, involving
her and Sam at a cabin in the woods. Just thinking about it made
Brooke need a very sudden dramatic drop in water temperature.</p>

<p>There were only three things she knew for sure these days. 1. She was
in love with Sam. 2. Sam was straight. 3. If Sam found out about
Brooke being in love with her, Brooke could kiss her popularity good-
bye. Not that she cared.</p>

<p>Not that she cared! After having the dream (different locations, same
characters and general content) several times, she realized that just
having Sam in her arms, finding out if she was as good in real life
as in the dreams, was worth a lifetime of lying to herself for false
popularity. And this scared the hell out of her.  So she was avoiding
Sam, putting off the next time when they would be alone together.
Because Brooke knew she wouldn't be able to keep from blurting it
out.</p>
