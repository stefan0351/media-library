<!-- Mixed Messages \ Chapter 8: Oh, my Gahd! -->

<p>Nicole had known something was up. </p>

<p>There had been such a change in Brookie, for the better, if you asked
her. And now, she was reverting to her old, wimpy, let's be nice to
Spam ways. Well, thought Nicole, if you asked her, it stunk. </p>

<p>As Mary Cherry nattered in her ear, she wondered how she could have
missed it. Brookie was in love with Spam! It made perfect sense, now
she thought about it. And she was thinking about it. </p>

<p>"Oh, my Gahd, Nic," MC blurted. "You'll never believe what Ah just
witnessed with mah own two Gahd given eyes!"</p>

<p>"What, there's a sale at Saks?" Nicole had asked, disinterestedly. </p>

<p>"No, much more worse than that," MC panted. "Ah have just witnessed
the downfahl of our dear Brookie, to that dreadful Ms. McPherson. As
Ah was standing outsahde the newspaper office, Ah did happen to see
the two in question slip insahde, and they did seem in a mahty hurry,
if you know what Ah mean," she explained. </p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"AND, Ah then heard the most... incriminatin' bunch o' sounds Ah
think Ah'll ever hear. Moanin' and gaspin' like nobody's business.
Well," she amended, "nobodies but ours, Nic."</p>

<p>"So what, Mary Cherry? Is there a point you'd like to get to sometime
soon?"</p>

<p>"Mah point IS, Nicole, our dearly beloved Brookie was obviously
pressured into the swappin' of salivah with Spam McPherson," Mary
Cherry finished in a whisper. </p>

<p>Nicole bolted upright. "You mean..."</p>

<p>"Yes. Brookie is no longer playing for our team, and it is our Gahd
given duty to bring her back to the fold," Mary Cherry recited
righteously. However, Nicole was no longer listening. Brookie was
gay? And in love with Spam? What was the world coming to? But if she
thought about it (and as Mary Cherry babbled on, she did think about
it, extensively) it made sense, given her behavior this past couple
weeks. First with the flawless avoiding, and then with the spaced out
thing? Nicole had known something was up, but this? Well, she would
have to do something about it. </p>

<p>The bell rang and she jumped up from her chair, interrupting Mary
Cherry in mid rant and stormed from the room, leaving Mary Cherry to
scuttle along behind her. Where was Nicole heading? For the newspaper
office. She had a feeling that Brookie and her newest `love' might
return to the scene of the crime. Thinking that, she abruptly spun
around to face Mary Cherry, who skidded to a halt and waited for her
instructions. </p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, go to our next class and make our apologies."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Nic, but whose apologies am Ah making?"</p>

<p>"Mine, Brookie's... and Spam's."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry spun and hurried in the opposite direction, anxious to
follow the orders to the letter. </p>
