<p>An enraged Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres was about to deliver her first blow to the deserving former drone that she held immobile with her other fist by clutching the tight material of the plum biosuit.  The doors of Engineering swished open and a small, commanding figure in red strode through them.</P>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres!"</P>
<p>She came closer as B'Elanna hesitated.</P>
<p>"Throw that punch and I promise you, you will spend the rest of this trip in the brig."</P>
<p>The words forced their way through the red haze of anger that clouded B'Elanna's judgment.  Seven did not move although her eyes followed Janeway's entrance into the room and then quickly shifted back to B'Elanna's face.  Her eyes narrowed a she waited to see what the outcome of the words would be.</P>
<p>B'Elanna did not swing but nor did she lower her arm.  She was still trying to decide.  She was tired of dealing with the interfering and extremely annoying Borg.  Today's confrontation was the last straw, honor demanded satisfaction.  The human side tried to reason with B'Elanna.  She knew the Captain did not make idle threats.</P>
<p>"Release her, B'Elanna.  Or face the consequences."</P>
<p>Anger and concern for Seven's safety roughened the already raspy voice.</P>
<p>Abruptly B'Elanna dropped Seven and she shoved the bigger woman away from her as though to push temptation out of arm's reach.  B'Elanna raised both hands in the air and dipped her head in surrender.  She was breathing heavily and fought to retain control of her emotions.  She didn't look up as Janeway came nearer.</P>
<p>"Are you alright, Seven?"</P>
<p>Janeway asked as she surveyed the young woman's body for any outward signs of injury.</P>
<p>"Yes, Captain.  I am unharmed."</P>
<p>Seven was touched by the Captain's concern but it was unnecessary.  She was never in danger of being damaged.  The half Klingon surprised her with the suddenness of her attack but Seven's strength was more than a match for B'Elanna's.  She was merely waiting until B'Elanna committed to an action before she made her move to counter it.</P>
<p>A snort of laughter erupted from the Engineer.  She looked her Captain hard in the eye.</P>
<p>"I'm fine too, Captain.  Thanks for asking."</P>
<p>Without breaking the gaze that B'Elanna initiated, Janeway growled.</P>
<p>"My Ready Room.  Both of you.  Now!"</P>
<p>Without another word she spun on her heel and marched out of the room.  B'Elanna followed close behind wanting to get Seven out of her sight as quickly as possible.  Seven rolled her eyes and sighed as she trailed them.  She was not looking forward to this discussion.</P>
<p>Once in the Ready Room the two women stood side by side as their Captain paced restlessly in front of them.  No words were spoken.  Janeway sighed inwardly and then forced herself to sit down in her chair.  She eyed them both until even Seven looked away at last.  Then she spoke.</P>
<p>"I am aware that you two have never gotten along but I believed that you were both professional enough not to allow an incident like this to occur particularly in front of other crew.  Crew that you command, Lieutenant Torres."</P>
<p>B'Elanna started to speak but Janeway held up her hand and stopped her.</P>
<p>"I'm not finished yet.  In fact I haven't even begun."</P>
<p>B'Elanna gave a short nod.</P>
<p>"I don't know what the argument was about and I don't think I even want to know.  It doesn't matter.  You two have been at each other from the moment Seven arrived and I will not allow it to go on any more.  You are two of my best officers but that gives you no excuse. In fact, that leaves you with less than no excuse because I know you know better."</P>
<p>She paused for a moment to assess what affect her words were having on them.  B'Elanna was slightly flushed and would not look Janeway in the eye.  Seven showed no emotion as she listened to the words.  On the surface it appeared as though she didn't realize the Captain was even speaking about her.</P>
<p>But Janeway knew better.  If you looked closely you would see the signs that signified that Seven was very upset.  The tic on the side of her face, the compulsive swallowing and the rigid stance with her hands held tightly behind her back told Janeway everything she needed to know.  Seven had displeased her Captain and this bothered her intensely.</P>
<p>"Today's actions will be noted in my log and on your record, Lieutenant Torres.  Seven, since you are not an official member of Star Fleet I cannot threaten you with this same course of action so I will have to hope that this verbal reprimand, the one in my log, and the knowledge that I am most unhappy with you will suffice."</P>
<p>The seemingly unfairness of this caused B'Elanna's to twist her lips in anger as she tried to suppress the outburst she felt rising.  Janeway noted the look but did not challenge it, she finished her speech.</P>
<p>"I hope I'm making myself clear when I say that I do not want to see or hear another incident like today and that I am ordering both of you to adjust your attitude towards one another immediately and find a relationship that works better than the one you currently have.  If we meet like this again there will be significant consequences.  Understood?"</P>
<p>"Understood, Captain.  I will endeavor to do as you order."</P>
<p>Seven was the first to speak.  Her words were clipped as the side of her face twitched once again and her stance got even stiffer.  B'Elanna was silent.</P>
<p>"Lieutenant?"</P>
<p>"Captain," the words were ground out between clenched teeth.</P>
<p>The Captain accepted the inevitable, "I didn't really think we were going to get through this without you having to say your piece.  I'd only hoped we could.  Before you say whatever it is you feel you must say let me make something perfectly clear."</P>
<p>B'Elanna managed to contain herself now that she knew she would be allowed to talk.</P>
<p>"Fair or unfair, I hold you more responsible for what happened than I do Seven.  And it's not favoritism or whatever you're thinking it is.  You were the senior officer in this situation.  Your experience as an officer and as an individual far exceeds Seven and I expect you to set the tone in your interactions.  You should be leading by example not reacting like a raging bull chasing a red flag every time you see Seven."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was incensed beyond reason.  She took a number of breaths before she spoke, trying to calm down and to find the words she needed.</P>
<p>"It's like you said, Captain.  You don't need to know what the argument was about, that isn't the point nor is it the problem.  The problem is bigger than that...it's you."</P>
<p>Janeway straight up very straight and her gaze hardened.</P>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Lieutenant?  I suggest you be very careful about what you say."</P>
<p>B'Elanna went on.</P>
<p>"You made me the head of Engineering and I appreciate that more than you will ever know and I also know what a chance you took giving me that opportunity.  No matter what you think of me, I remember that every day and I work hard to acknowledge the trust you placed in me."</P>
<p>Janeway relaxed slightly at these words.</P>
<p>"But you undermine my authority when you allow Seven to come into my department and run rampant."</P>
<p>"I do not run rampant, Lieutenant."</P>
<p>Seven was insulted by the suggestion that her actions were anything but logical and clearly laid out.</P>
<p>"She comes in there ordering my people around, pulling them off projects or work that I assigned them to and taking over computer stations as though they were all hers to command."</P>
<p>Seven raised a brow at this but did not deny what B'Elanna described.  She admitted it was true but how else was she supposed to get anything done in an efficient manner.  Protocol was inefficient.</P>
<p>"I realize that, B'Elanna.  But you've got to understand.  Seven is still learning..."</P>
<p>"She's not learning anything, Captain.  Why should she be?  She doesn't need to ask because you allow her to get away with it."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was becoming more agitated.  Her arms waving with her words and her body moving in closer to where the Captain sat.</P>
<p>"Learning takes time, B'Elanna.  You can't expect it to happen overnight.  Seven learns from her mistakes just as we all do.  So yes, I cut her slack at times."</P>
<p>"You do more than cut her some slack.  You don't have her on a leash at all!"</P>
<p>B'Elanna looked over at Seven almost with contempt.</P>
<p>"Your pet project does whatever she wants.  She can do no wrong.  I'm not in charge down there, she is.  And the crew all knows it.  They don't obey her because want to, they do it because they know she has your blessing."</P>
<p> B'Elanna was practically shouting at this point.</P>
<p>"Enough, Lieutenant."</P>
<p>Janeway rose from her seat and slammed her hand down on the desk, loudly.</P>
<p>"You're right!  It is enough!  I've had it.  You expect me to run the department and then you do everything in your power to make it as difficult as possible."</P>
<p>"Lieutenant."</P>
<p>Janeway's voice warned B'Elanna she was crossing the line but B'Elanna didn't hear it.</P>
<p>"I can't command Engineering the way it should be run if your damn drone is going to be in my face every time I turn around."</P>
<p>As she said these final words B'Elanna pointed at the object of her derision with a shaking finger and a clenched fist.  Seven looked coolly down at the finger waving beneath her nose and then at the raging woman attached to it.  She drew on all her will power to not flinch at the words B'Elanna flung at her with such hatred but something flickered in her eyes for a moment.  Janeway saw it.</P>
<p>"Silence!"</P>
<p>She roared at B'Elanna and B'Elanna, stunned by the anger behind the command did indeed shut up.  She felt a sinking feeling in her stomach as she realized she'd gone too far.</P>
<p>"Right now I can't think of one good reason why I should leave you in command of Engineering.  Your words here make it perfectly evident to me that your prejudice will never allow you work with Seven as I require.  It was my intention to remove you from your position if there was another incident of this nature but I can see now that there is no point in waiting for the inevitable."</P>
<p>B'Elanna felt as though the world was about to come to a complete stop as she heard these words.  Janeway was about to take it all away.  The blood rushed through her head so loudly she almost didn't hear what happened next.</P>
<p>Seven interrupted Janeway.</P>
<p>"Captain, may I please speak?"</P>
<p>"Seven, I..."</P>
<p>"Please, Captain," Seven was insistent.</P>
<p>"Very well, Seven."</P>
<p>"I do not deny that Lieutenant Torres and I have our....difficulties.  We do not work well together but we do our best to accomplish the goals that you assign us.  As in all things, sometimes we do better and sometimes...things do not go well.  Today was one of those less than better days."</P>
<p>Janeway nodded and allowed Seven to continue.</P>
<p>"I believe that it would be inefficient and detrimental to the crew and its safety to remove Lieutenant Torres from her duties.  The words she has spoken here today were said in anger and haste."</P>
<p>"I realize that, Seven.  But they also reveal a deep lying anger and prejudice towards you that I will not tolerate from any crew member towards another."</P>
<p>"I believe that is an incorrect assumption on your part, Captain."</P>
<p>"Indeed."</P>
<p>"Strong emotions cause irrational behavior and speech.  Accepting what one hears when someone in this state as truth is not recommended.   I do not believe that it accurately reflects how the individual really feels or believes.  Once Lieutenant Torres has calmed down this matter can be resolved."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was listening to all this with growing horror. What was worse?  Losing her beloved job or having that job saved by the very person who almost caused her to lose it?  It was like a nightmare that never ended.</P>
<p>"Seven, you are more optimistic than I ever imagined you could be."</P>
<p>Janeway was surprised by Seven's defense of the angry Klingon.</P>
<p>"I only request that Lieutenant Torres and I be given the opportunity to work out our differences.  It is not optimism I am expressing but determination and I think you will see that the Lieutenant will be just as determined."</P>
<p>"I don't know, Seven."</P>
<p>"I would suggest that you think about it.  What is the human phrase, perhaps you should  'sleep on it' and decide in the morning."</P>
<p>Janeway's half smile rose at the decidely odd phrase coming from the young woman's mouth.  She gave a nod.</P>
<p>"Very well.  I'll do that."</P>
<p>She looked at B'Elanna as though she expected her to say something more.</P>
<p>In a quiet voice she said, "Thank you, Captain."</P>
<p>She turned and left before the Captain dismissed them without realizing it.  She was angry and confused, today was one of the worst days of her life.  And considering the number of candidates up for nomination since they'd hit the Delta Quadrant, it was a bad day indeed.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna never slept that night.  Instead she replayed the day's events over and over in her mind.  By morning she wasn't sure if she hoped she still had a job or not.  She'd never been angrier and as her anger grew and became more irrational she blamed Seven for everything.  She felt like a supernova on the brink of explosion.</P>
<p>Fortunately the Captain chose to deliver her decision via the comlink instead of in person.</P>
<p>"Janeway to Torres."</P>
<p>"Torres here, Captain."</P>
<p>B'Elanna, fighting to hide her feelings, sounded deeper than usual.</P>
<p>"You will be continuing your duties."</P>
<p>"Yes, Captain."</P>
<p>There was a pause.</P>
<p>"Fine.  See you in the Conference Room for the senior staff meeting shortly."</P>
<p>"Yes, Captain.  See you there."</P>
<p>B'Elanna sagged down onto the bed in relief.  She still had a job.  She sucked in a shaky breath of air and tried to sort out her thoughts before she left the privacy of her quarters.  Then she left and headed for the Conference Room.</P>
<p>The meeting was shorter than most.  Everyone sensed the tension in the room so comments were minimal and business was conducted as quickly as possible.  When everyone was dismissed B'Elanna was the first one out the door as she headed for Engineering.</P>
<p>Seven lingered and waited for everyone else to leave.</P>
<p>"You wanted to know what I decided, Seven?"</P>
<p>Janeway enquired of the waiting Borg.</P>
<p>"No, Captain.  Lieutenant Torres' presence here this morning made the answer apparent.  You decided to allow us a chance to work out the matter."</P>
<p>"Yes I did.  I have to be honest and tell you I don't have high hopes on the two of you succeeding however."</P>
<p>"Hope is irrelevant.  Either Lieutenant Torres and I will find a way to sort out our differences or we will fail."</P>
<p>"Alright then.  But for everyone's sake I do hope you succeed."</P>
<p>"Thank you, Captain."</P>
<p>Seven did not move to leave.</P>
<p>"Was there something else on your mind?"</P>
<p>"Yes."</P>
<p>Janeway waved at the chair next to hers to indicate that Seven should stop hovering over her and sit down instead.  Seven sat down diffidently and turned the chair so she was facing the Captain.</P>
<p>"I, too want to see us succeed and I will do everything I can to bring the proper conclusion to this.  I would like to make suggestion that I think will assist us immeasurably."</P>
<p>"Yes, what is it?"</P>
<p>"Stop protecting me."</P>
<p>"Seven?"</P>
<p>"While Lieutenant Torres was very upset yesterday and said many things that were untrue she was correct when she stated that you do not treat me as you do the others."</P>
<p>"But you know why that it is."</P>
<p>Janeway protested.</P>
<p>"I understand that you have the best of intentions in your actions and I cannot deny that I appreciate the assistance you have given me.  However, I think the time has come where I must....stand on my own two feet."</P>
<p>Janeway idly wondered where Seven got these colloquialisms from....the doctor or some database.</P>
<p>"I have learned a great deal in my time on this ship and in particular I have learned most of it from you.  But now I am at a time in my development where I need to move beyond what I have learned, to extend myself.  I cannot do this if I know you will be there to correct each mistake I make and that you will protect me from others."</P>
<p>Janeway whispered sadly, "Is that what I do, Seven?"</P>
<p>"My need for you has not ended.  There is still so much that confuses me and that I need to learn.  And I want you to be the person who performs this action for me.  I....I trust you more than anyone.  I have learned that relationships change because they grow and that is what we must do.  You have been my mentor and guide but now I would like for you to be.....my friend."</P>
<p>Janeway smiled as she absorbed the words.  She could see that Seven was right.  She was only pointing out what was happening already.  Janeway needed to trust the lessons she'd taught Seven and to trust the woman herself to make her own decisions.  To do any less was disrespectful of her right to be an individual.</P>
<p>"I will always be your friend, Seven.  You mean so very much to me.  I care about what happens to you but you're right.  I'll do as you ask."</P>
<p>Seven's smile wasn't big but it didn't need to be.  Janeway could see she was touched by the words.  Seven nodded at her as she stood up and left the Conference Room.  Janeway watched her leave and knew, without a doubt, that Seven would be alright.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna took her tray of food and headed over to the table where her two friends, Tom and Harry, were already seated with their dinners.  They paused in their eating to greet her with a smile and nod as she joined them.  She looked at her tray doubtfully and then at their half empty trays containing similar remains.</P>
<p>"What is it?"</P>
<p>Both men shrugged.</P>
<p>"I don't know."</P>
<p>Harry answered first, then Tom chimed in.</P>
<p>"I stopped asking a long time ago.  It makes it easier to eat."</P>
<p>B'Elanna snorted and nodded her head in agreement as she began to eat.
Conversation was sporadic to start with as their food remained their main objective.  As they finished their meal B'Elanna noticed Tom and Harry exchanging glances with Tom looking like he was about to speak and Harry trying to discourage him from whatever he was going to say.</P>
<p>The utensil clattered on the tray as B'Elanna dropped it and gave both startled men the evil eye.</P>
<p>"Ok, what is it?"</P>
<p>Harry answered quickly, cutting off Tom in his haste.</P>
<p>"Nothing, nothing at all."</P>
<p>B'Elanna fixed her gaze on Tom, the weak link obviously.</P>
<p>"Spit it out, Tom.  You know you will eventually, so why not do it now and not force me to beat it out of you."</P>
<p>Tom swallowed hesitantly, hoping that was an idle threat.  You never knew with the volatile Klingon woman.</P>
<p>"We, uh, heard about what happened with you and Seven."</P>
<p>B'Elanna stiffened and picked up her fork again, shoving it hard through the congealing mass of whatever it was that lay on her plate.</P>
<p>"Oh yeah?  And what exactly did you hear?"</P>
<p>The question was asked in a soft, menacing voice.</P>
<p>Tom looked over at Harry desperately sending a request for assistance with his eyes.  Harry looked back at him blandly, he'd told Tom to leave it alone but Tom wouldn't listen.</P>
<p>"Well, we heard that there was an altercation between you and Seven and you were about to knock Seven's lights out when the Captain intervened."</P>
<p>"Uh-huh."</P>
<p>"Sounded like the Captain was pretty pissed," Tom continued.</P>
<p>"She was."</P>
<p>B'Elanna could feel her anger rising all over again so she kept her replies short.  She wondered how much of this story was wandering around the ship already.</P>
<p>"They said she threatened to throw you in the brig."</P>
<p>No response.  Tom looked at her curiously.</P>
<p>"Well, did she?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna could feel all the bitterness welling up in her once again, the emotion loosening her tongue.</P>
<p>"Huh, she did more than that.  She was about to demote me."</P>
<p>"What!"</P>
<p>This actually came from Harry but both men looked equally shocked at B'Elanna's words.  Tom spoke next.</P>
<p>"You're kidding, right?  Captain Janeway would never do that."</P>
<p>B'Elanna's lips twisted with anger.</P>
<p>"You couldn't be more wrong, believe me.  Mess with her pretty little Borg playmate and pay the consequences.  The message was loud and clear."</P>
<p>Both men looked uncomfortable at her words.  Harry spoke softly.</P>
<p>"Come on, B'Elanna.  That doesn't sound fair."</P>
<p>"Fair, Harry?  This has nothing to do with fair.  I know that.  This has to do with the Captain throwing her weight around and letting Seven do whatever she damn well pleases."</P>
<p>Harry argued.</P>
<p>"You were about to hit her!  You're an officer, you can't do that.  The Captain had to act.  She had no choice."</P>
<p>B'Elanna stared at Harry, anger blazing in her eyes and flooding her countenance.  Tom attempted to change the subject slightly.</P>
<p>"You said the Captain was going to relieve you of duty.  What changed her mind?  Why didn't she?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna's laughter was bitter and painful, "Oh, that's the best part of it all.  You see after Seven breezes into Engineering disrupting everything I'm working on, then ignoring me when I tried to kick her out, and finally arguing with me endlessly in that relentless, unemotional way of hers then she's the one that talks the Captain out of doing it!"</P>
<p>"No way,"  Tom was hanging on every word.</P>
<p>"I'm telling you, it was a done deal."</P>
<p>B'Elanna didn't mention how it escalated to that point.</P>
<p>"The Captain all but ripped the pips off me when Seven for whatever misguided reason spoke up and talked her out of it."</P>
<p>Harry offered, "Maybe she was sorry about what happened."</P>
<p>B'Elanna sneered, "Sorry would be an emotion, Harry.  That's not why she did it."</P>
<p>Harry countered, "Well at least she did the right thing and saved your job."</P>
<p>B'Elanna's face burned with indignation.</P>
<p>"She didn't do the right thing, dammit.  She did it to humiliate me."</P>
<p>Tom looked surprised at the outburst.</P>
<p>"Aw, come on B'Elanna.  You don't really believe that, do you?"</P>
<p>"You're damn right I do.  It was just one more demonstration of what I've been saying all along.  She has more influence over the Captain than anyone else on this ship.  That cold piece of machinery just has to whisper in the Captain's ear and she gets what she wants."</P>
<p>The two men exchanged glances, agreeing that B'Elanna was pretty well over the top on this one.  Neither of them could think of anything to say.  An awkward silence ensued until finally Tom, grasping at conversational straws, spoke.</P>
<p>"Well, you're sure right about Seven's lack of emotions.  I thought once she was separated from the Collective and returned to her humanity that her emotions would just naturally resurface.  But I don't think I've ever seen one single instance of a spontaneous emotional outburst come out of her."</P>
<p>B'Elanna nodded, "She's incapable of feeling one if you ask me."</P>
<p>Harry shook his head, "No, I disagree.  She feels a lot.  I think she just hides it all."</P>
<p>Tom laughed, "How do you figure that?"</P>
<p>Harry replied, "She has to have feelings.  She's human."</P>
<p>"Barely," muttered B'Elanna.</P>
<p>Tom continued, "Seven has been on this ship for almost two years now and she hasn't shown any yet.  She isn't ever going to."</P>
<p>"We'll see," was Harry's answer.</P>
<p>Tom continued to argue.</P>
<p>"Yeah right, I think practically everyone on the ship would love to see but it isn't going to happen.  Ever."</P>
<p>Harry didn't bother to reply.  Tom kept talking.</P>
<p>"There isn't anyone on this ship that could get to her show an emotion.  I'm telling you not even Naomi Wildman could get anything out of her.  No one."</P>
<p>A small thought began to nag at B'Elanna as Tom argued with his friend.  A small, feral smile crossed her face as an idea blossomed quickly.</P>
<p>"I bet I can."</P>
<p>Both men were staring at B'Elanna as she said it.</P>
<p>"You bet you can what?" asked the confused Tom.</P>
<p>"I bet I can get an emotional response out of Seven."</P>
<p>"Sure, all you have to do is beat the crap out of her."</P>
<p>"No, not that way."</P>
<p>"Then what?"  Tom couldn't see where she was headed with this.</p>
<p>"I'll bet you, and anyone else who wants in on this, that I'll get an emotional outburst out of Seven that will shock the hell out of you."</P>
<p>"How?"</P>
<p>"I'm not saying.  You willing to take the bet?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna could feel her eagerness rising as she thought about her plan.  It was perfect.  She'd get her revenge and have a little fun while she was doing it.</P>
<p>Tom was always ready to make a wager.</P>
<p>"Tell me how this is going to work."</P>
<p>"Ok, if I can get a strong emotional reaction out of Seven without physically harming her I win.  If I don't, you win."</P>
<p>"How long do you get and how will you prove it?"</P>
<p>"It'll happen in public somewhere so there'll be plenty of witnesses."</P>
<p>Witnesses, she thought, are crucial to my plan.  She intended to fully humiliate Seven just as the ex-Borg did to her.  She went on.</P>
<p>"And I'll need, let's say four months."</P>
<p>"Four months!  I don't know, B'Elanna"</P>
<p>"Hey come on, it's going to take time for me to get her to trust me.  If I can't physically harm her to get my reaction then its going to take some work for me to get anywhere."</P>
<p>Harry spoke for the first time.</P>
<p>"This doesn't sound like a good idea, you two.  I don't think you should do this.  You know how the Captain feels about gambling."</P>
<p>Tom scoffed, "It's all in fun, Harry.  You heard B'Elanna, she's not going to actually hurt Seven."</P>
<p>B'Elanna kept her mouth shut.  She hated lying to her friends.</P>
<p>"It doesn't sound like fun.  I think someone is going to get hurt.  The whole thing is going backfire on you and is going to cause you even more trouble, B'Elanna.  You're making a big mistake.  I don't want any part of it."</P>
<p>B'Elanna's laughter wasn't pleasant, "You worry too much.  This is going to be a breeze.  I'll win the bet without breaking a sweat.  No problems, no trouble."</P>
<p>The Borg won't know what hit her thought B'Elanna.  Harry shook his head and got up from the table, taking his tray with him.</P>
<p>"Count me out," and he walked away.</P>
<p>The remaining pair watched him walk away and then Tom turned to her.</P>
<p>"I'm in.  I'll take your bet.  How much?"</P>
<p>"A month of rations."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was feeling confident.  Tom hesitated, he hated losing especially losing a lot.  He thought about it, B'Elanna was crazy if she thought she could get that close to Seven, it didn't matter if he gave her till they got home to the Alpha Quadrant.  Seven wasn't going to change.  B'Elanna's judgment was clouded by yesterday's situation.  He shouldn't take advantage of his friend in this state, he chided himself.  But he couldn't resist.</P>
<p>"Done."</P>
<p>They shook on it.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna's mind wandered during the staff meeting as she went over her plan of attack. She eyed her oblivious prey as she thought about her first move.  Seven felt the unwavering gaze and shifted her attention to the staring Klingon woman with curiosity.  She was mildly surprised to see no anger or hostility in the look she intercepted, only.....speculation.  She raised her brow minutely as she wondered why B'Elanna didn't appear more agitated about her presence.  Captain Janeway's voice interupted her thoughts and she focused once again on what was being said.</P>
<p>B'Elanna knew the best way to tackle this was logically.  While it wasn't her way of doing things, it was Seven's, and if she did this right Seven wouldn't ask very many questions about her motives.  She waited till the meeting was over and as everyone got up to leave the Conference Room she called to the departing Borg.</P>
<p>"Seven, could I have a moment of your time."</P>
<p>Seven and the Captain both turned around as B'Elanna spoke.  Seven stepped back readily and waited to hear what B'Elanna would say.  Janeway eyed the Lieutenant suspiciously as she paused in her departure.</P>
<p>B'Elanna reassured her, "It's alright, Captain.  I just want a few moments alone with Seven."</P>
<p>B'Elanna smiled tentatively and tried to appear non-threatening.  Hard to do for a woman who was used to letting the people around her know that they shouldn't be fooled by her dimunitive size and to tread lightly.  The warning was completely nonverbal and was part of her natural movements and behavior.  She tried not to project anything as best she could.  The Captain was a lot savvier than Seven about human nature and might detect any deception that B'Elanna would attempt.</P>
<p>Seven nodded at the Captain, "Thank you, Captain.  We will be fine."</P>
<p>B'Elanna hid her annoyance by turning around and sitting back down at the table once again.  Janeway eyed them both once more, turned and left.</P>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres," the words were more of a question.</P>
<p>"Yes, ah, thank you Seven.  Won't you sit down?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna gestured at the seat next to her.</P>
<p>"I prefer to stand."</P>
<p>B'Elanna looked up at the tall woman towering over her and bit back the retort she was about to make.</P>
<p>"Fine.  Look, I wanted to talk about what happened."</P>
<p>"You are angry."</P>
<p>"No."</P>
<p>Seven raised a doubtful brow at this reply.  B'Elanna knew she would need to be careful.  Her plan was to blend a careful mix of truth and lies, enough truth to get Seven to accept what she said.  The more truth the better, subterfuge was not B'Elanna's strongest suit.</P>
<p>B'Elanna sighed, "Yes, I am angry.  But I'm not stupid."</P>
<p>"No, you are not.  You are one of the most intelligent women I have ever encountered."</P>
<p>Seven said this without inflection.  She did not mean it as a compliment, it was the truth.  B'Elanna lost her train of thought for a moment.  She knew that whether it was meant as praise or not, it was meaningful.  Seven was no slouch in the brain department.  B'Elanna went on.</P>
<p>"Well, I like to think I'm smart enough to realize when it's time to change my behavior."</P>
<p>"Indeed?"</P>
<p>Seven did not expect this turn of events.  She assumed that they would go back to the their less antagonistic ways but that would be the most she could hope for.  Perhaps not.</P>
<p>The next part was easy for B'Elanna because it was the truth.</P>
<p>"Seven, my job means everything to me.  I'm not about to do anything that would jeopardize it."</P>
<p>She quashed the thought that this whole plan of action might fall into that category.  The Captain would have a hard time proving that B'Elanna did anything against regulations.</P>
<p>"You and I don't get along, we never have.  But I'm willing to try to change that."</P>
<p>Seven was just short of amazed at these words.  She was sure she'd understood Klingon behavior better than this.  She assumed that the result of the confrontation with the Captain and the Captain's decision to retain the Klingon as Engineer thanks to Seven's intervention would only create more hostility and resentment.  Once again, she appeared to have miscalculated an emotional response.</P>
<p>"What precisely do you mean, Lieutenant?"</P>
<p>"I mean I'll attempt to control my temper better when it comes to working with you.  I know that ultimately we both have the same interests at heart and that's to keep this ship running at it's optimum and to get us home as quickly as we can.  I think that if I can remind myself of this when we're together that I can work more cooperatively with you."</P>
<p>Seven nodded in agreement, "A sound assessment, Lieutenant.  I concur with conclusion."</P>
<p>B'Elanna wasn't going to let her off that easily though.</P>
<p>"But you have to do your part too."</P>
<p>"What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Seven, I need you to work with me not around or over me.  I am in charge of Engineering and I need you to respect that by having you communicate with me about your plans before you start them."</P>
<p>"A reasonable request.  I will comply."</P>
<p>"I think for this to work we need to agree that if one is unhappy about the other's actions that we tell one other."</P>
<p>Seven straightened and tilted her head as she answered.</P>
<p>"You have always told me when you are unhappy with my activities.  Loudly.  How will this be different?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna smiled, "I'll turn down the volume."</P>
<p>"That would be acceptable."</P>
<p>"And in return you have to agree that you will speak to me when you are disturbed by me instead of going to the Captain."</P>
<p>"Agreed."</P>
<p>B'Elanna looked at her in surprise.  She didn't expect it to be this easy.  She wondered briefly if a lot of the past grievances could have been avoided if they'd only talked before this.</P>
<p>"Great.  That's all I have to say then.  Is there anything you'd like to add?"</P>
<p>Seven considered this for a moment and then spoke thoughtfully.</P>
<p>"Only that I am gratified that we had this conversation.  I will endeavor to do my best in making our relationship more efficient.  As you said, our goals are the same and we are more likely to achieve them together than we are in our present situation.  Thank you."</P>
<p>These last two words came out somewhat stilted as Seven was not yet accustomed to the use of courtesies but the Doctor informed her that others appreciated them.  And she wanted B'Elanna to know that she was pleased that they were going to make this attempt.</P>
<p>B'Elanna smiled in agreement and got up to leave.  The two women exited the room heading for Engineering as B'Elanna mentioned the plasma manifold problem she was working on and asked for Seven's advice.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>Weeks passed with very little progress in B'Elanna's plans.  As the time passed she could feel her anger lessen and she questioned her reasons for still pursuing them.  She and Seven seemed to reach a new understanding and respect for one another as they worked together on a multitude of new problems.  While there were no emergencies or life threatening situations occurring they still found themselves naturally seeking one another out as new ideas arose or new maintenance problems manifested themselves.</P>
<p>B'Elanna came to realize that Seven's skills and abilities complimented her own.  Her intutitive leaps of deduction were nicely balanced by Seven's orderly and methodical way of approaching a question.  Seven felt it too even though at first  she was annoyed by B'Elanna's random thought patterns she came to appreciate them as seemingly insurmountable problems were solved by the ideas that formed from them.</P>
<p>There were two things that stopped B'Elanna from abandoning her revenge altogether.  The first was the Captain and the second was Tom.  Janeway said very little to B'Elanna and B'Elanna still burned with embarrassment when she thought about that day in the Captain's Ready Room.  She assumed that Janeway was still angry at her and that's why the Captain stopped coming to down to Engineering on her rounds as she used to do.  There was little interaction elsewhere and B'Elanna realized how much she missed that and how much she needed her Captain's approval.  She fought these feelings by stoking the fires of her anger, replaying that day in her mind, until all she felt was the need to avenge her honor.</P>
<p>And if that wasn't enough there was always Tom asking her how things were coming along.  His favorite thing to do was to plan, outloud, how he would use B'Elanna's month of rations once he won their wager.  Each idea was more outrageous than the next and described in minute detail to B'Elanna as she attempted to eat her meals with the grinning Lieutenant.  Harry continued to say nothing, just looking at the two of them with disgust if the subject was mentioned.</P>
<p>And so B'Elanna clung to her need for revenge, not accepting that the time and need for it was already passed.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>Seven and B'Elanna sat in the messhall together their heads bent over a series of padds as they argued amicably about what they were reading.  Their relationship progressed to the point where the two of them were often seen together in their offduty time here and in Sandrine's. While their discussions were filled with their work they appreciated finding a kindred spirit to share it with.</P>
<p>B'Elanna's voice rose as she got agitated about her point.</P>
<p>"No, Seven.  That's not how it works.  Look I'll show you."</P>
<p>She wrested the padd out of the ex-drone's hand.  Or at least she tried to but Seven was holding it with her Borg implanted hand and she did not relinquish it to the grabby Klingon.</P>
<p>"Give it to me."</P>
<p>B'Elanna demanded.</P>
<p>"Please."  Seven prompted the woman.</P>
<p>B'Elanna stared at her in annoyance.  She saw Seven's lip twitch and she relaxed abruptly.  She barked a short laugh.</P>
<p>"Sorry, Seven.  Sometimes I get caught up in my ideas and I get carried away."</P>
<p>"You are passionate about what you do."</P>
<p>Seven stated this simply.  B'Elanna smiled at her in agreement.</P>
<p>"Yeah, I guess I am.  But that's no reason for me to be so rude."</P>
<p>Seven forestalled her apology.</P>
<p>"This quality of yours is one that I have to come to appreciate.  I find it.....stimulating."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was startled.</P>
<p>"I would have thought you'd find it annoying, even inefficient."</P>
<p>"Yes, I do."</P>
<p>She paused while B'Elanna laughed again and then continued.</P>
<p>"However, I have learned that it is your passion that motivates you and allows you to think the way you do.  I find I sometimes envy it.  At times I wish I could feel it as well."</P>
<p>"Really.  That's funny because there are times that I envy your oh so analytical mind.  Your mind is unclouded and objective, allowing you to think at an incredible rate while I seem to run around in mindless circles looking for the right answer."</P>
<p>The two women stared at each other in silence, thinking about these admissions.  And then B'Elanna hestitantly reached out and laid her hand on Seven's.</P>
<p>"Besides, you do have that passion, Seven.  You just don't realize it."</P>
<p>Seven tilted her head questioningly at her.</P>
<p>"You work every bit as hard as I, even harder at times, and your desire to accomplish your goal as well as your need to do a good job is every bit as passionate as mine is.  You just hide it under that cool exterior of yours."</P>
<p>Seven moved uncomfortably at these words.  She sensed that they were true and was torn between feeling disconcerted that she did not realize this before and that there was now someone who knew her well enough to see it themselves.  She was unsure which bothered her more.</P>
<p>She looked down at the hand that covered hers and then at B'Elanna, sensing the warmth of it and finding that she liked it.  B'Elanna forgot it was there as she looked into the blue depths of Seven's eyes, seeing beyond the coldness there and into the person who hid behind it.  Time stood still as the two became absorbed in one another for a moment.</P>
<p>The sound of a tray hitting the table between them jerked them from their reverie as they both turned their attention to Tom as he seated himself at their table.</P>
<p>"Ladies, mind if I join you?"</P>
<p>He was jovial and loud.  Seven looked down at the tray and watched as Tom picked up his napkin.</P>
<p>"Lieutenant Paris.  The question is pointless since you already have done so."</P>
<p>B'Elanna, still recovering from what just happened, grinned at this.</P>
<p>"You're right, Seven.  I'm not sure why you bothered to ask, Tom."</P>
<p>Tom smiled good humoredly and ignored their jibes.  The atmosphere at the table eased as the three of them began to talk and finish their meals.  Conversation eventually turned to the pool competition that was happening in Sandrine's next week.</P>
<p>Tom and B'Elanna teased one another, bragging about how they planned to wipe the table with each other.  Seven listened bemusedly, trying to understand their words and attempting to figure out why this competition seemed to engender their enthusiasm.  She finally decided to ask.</P>
<p>"I fail to comprehend the point of this game, pool.  What is its purpose?"</P>
<p>Tom grinned at the question.</P>
<p>"You've never played, have you?"</P>
<p>Seven shook her head in the negative.</P>
<p>"It's a great game, Seven.  It requires a lot of skill."</P>
<p>"Hitting balls with a stick until they fall into designated holes does not seem skillful nor even interesting."</P>
<p>B'Elanna spoke up, "Actually I think you'd like it, Seven."</P>
<p>"Indeed."</P>
<p>B'Elanna explained, "In a sense it's like Velocity.  The game is about angles and manuevers.  Figuring out how to get your balls off the table and creating a situation where you make it difficult for your opponent to do so."</P>
<p>Seven thought about what she observed of the game and compared it to her favorite game that she played with the Captain.</P>
<p>"It does not have the physical aspect that Velocity does."</P>
<p>She argued.  B'Elanna nodded in agreement.</P>
<p>"You're right.  It's a much more cerebral game than Velocity.  You need to calculate angles, friction, speed and force.  I bet you'd be very good at it considering your mental abilities.  You'd be a natural."</P>
<p>"Perhaps."</P>
<p>B'Elanna could see Tom's mouth opening up and she spoke before he did, knowing  very well what he was about to say.</P>
<p>"I could teach you."</P>
<p>Tom's mouth snapped shut in annoyance as he glared at B'Elanna.  She smiled back at him beautifically.  Seven watched the interchange, confused.  She was unused to people desiring her company in this fashion. She thought about those moments before Tom arrived and felt more confusion.  She looked at B'Elanna trying to understand what was happening.</P>
<p>"Perhaps."</P>
<p>She said the single word again, unsure of what she wanted.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna worked hard to convince Seven to meet her at Sandrine's so that she could teach the young woman the game of pool.  She sensed that Seven still distrusted her and did not understand why B'Elanna was making overtures of friendship towards her.  A feral grin crossed B'Elanna's face as she awaited Seven's arrival.  One thing you had to say about the drone, she wasn't stupid.  B'Elanna was patient though and she was determined to win in the end.</P>
<p>Her thoughts were disturbed by the opening of the bar door and Seven stepped inside.  Thoughts of revenge vanished for a moment as B'Elanna took in the beautiful woman standing framed within the doorway.  By the gods, breathed B'Elanna, the woman was stunning.  She admitted to herself that affected it her.  The momentary feeling of lust and something else was quickly vanquished as B'Elanna forced herself to focus on her objective.  Time to play her part....</P>
<p>"Seven, you look..."  She hesitated as she was about to say nice but found herself saying instead, "lovely."</P>
<p>It was true.  B'Elanna's ridged brow furrowed as she felt bewildered for an instant.  It's alright, she told herself, the plan is to charm her.  I'm supposed to being doing this.  Unsettled, she smoothed her face and looked at the gorgeous woman before her.</P>
<p>Caught off guard by the Klingon's words, Seven swallowed as words escaped her.</P>
<p>"I am as I always am."</P>
<p>She was uncertain as to what she should say. B'Elanna smiled faintly at the sensible words.</P>
<p>"Yes you are, Seven.  And that is always....lovely."</P>
<p>The last word fell from her lips with a soft purr as she gazed up at the now bemused confused blonde.</P>
<p>"Th-thank you."</P>
<p>Seven was grateful to remember some of the Doctor's training concerning the acceptance of compliments.  She was not clear on the purpose of such comments and was perplexed to find herself feeling disoriented by the sensation B'Elanna's words caused her physically.  She could not identify the feeling nor rationalize why they were occurring.</P>
<p>B'Elanna was pleased to see the effect she was having on the former drone.  This wasn't really going to be that hard after all.  It was going to be like taking food from a t'gla.  Mentally, she rubbed her hands together in glee.</P>
<p>"Sit down, Seven.  Will you join me in a drink while we wait for a pool table to become available?"</P>
<p>She indicated the chair next to hers, encouraging her to sit down.  Seven looked at the chair B'Elanna was pointing to and the other, the one across the table farther from the smiling Klingon woman.  She hesitated and then chose the chair that B'Elanna directed her to sit in.  Their knees brushed against one another as Seven sat down.  Seven felt her disorientation increase for a moment until B'Elanna's leg withdrew from hers.  For a brief second, before B'Elanna pulled away from the warm length of limb near hers, she pressed her leg firmly against Seven's.</P>
<p>"A drink?  I do not require-"</P>
<p>Seven attempted to pull herself together in order to respond to the question coherently.  B'Elanna overrode what she was about to say.</P>
<p>"I know, I know.  You do not require liquid refreshment at this time."</P>
<p>She laughed as she repeated Seven's rote phrase of declination.  Then she leaned forward until her lips were almost touching Seven's ear and whispered.</P>
<p>"It's not about requirement, Seven.  It's about want and desire.  What is it you want?  What do you desire?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna withdrew from Seven and leaned back into her chair to watch the effect her words elicted from the utterly disconcerted woman.  She was having more fun than she expected.  She'd never heard of revenge being fun but decided it was just an unexpected bonus of her well laid plan.</P>
<p>Seven still didn't answer the questions, any of them.  B'Elanna put her out of her misery.</P>
<p>"Relax, Seven.  I'm just teasing you a bit.  It's alright."</P>
<p>Seven regained some of her composure and responded.</P>
<p>"I see.  I believe, in actuality B'Elanna, that you are attempting to flirt with me.  Is this a correct analysis of your behavior?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna winked at her and covered Seven's hand with her own.</P>
<p>"Why yes, Seven, I do believe I am."</P>
<p>The little composure she regained quickly vanished once more upon hearing B'Elanna's response.  Before she could speak B'Elanna jumped up still clutching her hand.</P>
<p>"Ah, I see our table is ready.  Let's go rack'em up."</P>
<p>For the next hour or so B'Elanna focused on teaching Seven the rudimentary rules of pool.  Just as she predicted to Seven when convincing to come on this date, Seven was a natural.  It didn't surprise B'Elanna in the least as the young Borg quickly calculated shots and angles.</P>
<p>B'Elanna laid off the verbal flirtation and began a more subtle and perhaps a more dangerous kind of beguilement.  Her hands guided Seven's, adjusting her arms, shoulders, legs, and the rest of her body into position for each shot.</P>
<p>At first Seven seemed uneasy by B'Elanna's nearness but eventually became used to the soft, but firm pressure that directed her body as it suited. She was puzzled by her inability to concentrate on B'Elanna's instruction.  It felt as though everything needed to be explained to her twice before she could carry out the directions given in the sultry voice that followed her around the pool table.</P>
<p>As B'Elanna expected, her proximity was affecting Seven's behavior as well as her senses.  She could see that Seven was intrigued by what was happening to her.  What B'Elanna didn't take into consideration was the affect that Seven's nearness was having on her senses.  She found herself forgetting what the objective was and just enjoying the sensation of intimacy as they circled one another in an intricate dance around the table.</P>
<p>Within the hour Seven retained enough understanding of the game that she could have continued playing without B'Elanna's assistance but neither of them pointed that fact out to the other.  Seven found herself reflecting on B'Elanna's earlier comment about want and desire, trying to assess their meaning in relation to what she appeared to be feeling when B'Elanna was near.  B'Elanna was thinking along the same lines, thoughts of revenge and the bet a distant memory.</P>
<p>The game's progress was excructiatingly slow as the two player's attention centered more on one another and less on the balls that lay on the table.  Despairing of ever having a turn, the group waiting so patiently finally worked up the nerve to ask when the game would be over.  B'Elanna and Seven felt dazed as they realized the world contained other living beings.  They relinquished the pool table and went to sit down once again in the corner.</P>
<p>B'Elanna felt strangely alert and was aware of every breath Seven drew.  Seven's breathing was almost labored as she attempted to evaluate her feelings and the sensation of heat that coursed through her body.  Their eyes locked and they read on the other's face what they were experiencing themselves.</P>
<p>B'Elanna inhaled deeply and her smile was tentative as she spoke.</P>
<p>"It's getting late.  We should probably call it a night."</P>
<p>Seven stared at her trying to guess if there was a hidden meaning behind B'Elanna's words.  If there was, she could not discern it so she decided to follow B'Elanna's lead.  It was unclear to her where this was headed but she knew she did not want it to stop.</P>
<p>"You are correct.  We both have the early shift tomorrow."</P>
<p>"Yeah, we do.  I'd like to walk you to your quarters though, if that's alright?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna wasn't ready to flat out invite Seven back to her place.  She thought things were going exactly as she planned but began to sense something was wrong.  She couldn't tell if she was getting cold feet or what the problem was but she was reluctant to let Seven go quite yet.</P>
<p>"Acc-, I would like that."</P>
<p>Seven corrected herself.</P>
<p>"Good.  Shall we?"</P>
<p>The two rose from the table and proceeded out of the Holodeck.  They walked in silence to Cargo Bay Two.  They did not touch as they walked but the space between their bodies was insignificant.  They reached the door of the place Seven called home and stopped.</P>
<p>Seven was uncertain as to what was going to occur next.  B'Elanna looked up into her eyes and looked for something she would not admit to herself that she was seeking.  She spoke awkwardly.</P>
<p>"I had a good time tonight."</P>
<p>"As did I, B'Elanna."</P>
<p>Seven responded with an honesty that surprised even her.  B'Elanna could see it in her eyes as they widened inappreciably as she said the words.</P>
<p>B'Elanna reached up with her right hand and cupped Seven's cheek, enjoying the sensation of the warm, silky skin that lay under her hand.  Seven's eyes widened again, more than before.  B'Elanna remained silent as her hand moved across and down Seven's face, tracing her ear and jawline until she reached her chin.</P>
<p>She raised her hand once more to touch the ocular implant that rested above Seven's eye.  As Seven realized her intentions she pulled back, away from the caress.</P>
<p>"Please," whispered B'Elanna.</P>
<p>Seven relaxed once more and watched B'Elanna's eyes darkened as her hand touched the cool metal and her finger explored the crevices of the metal.  Her left hand moved up to join her right examining the star implant below Seven's right ear.  Her light touch sent waves of emotion through the astounded former Borg.  Her lips parted as the feelings grew exponentially.</P>
<p>B'Elanna's hands now grasped each side of the taller woman's head and gently, but firmly pulled her down to her waiting lips. As their lips touched for the first time Seven's body appeared to melt down into the smaller woman's as B'Elanna reached up with her entire body to merge with Seven.</P>
<p>The kiss deepened quickly as B'Elanna's mouth engulfed Seven's and her tongue pushed gently against Seven's lips.  Instinctively Seven parted her lips and a wave of new sensations, more intense than any she'd felt before, filled her completely.  She moaned involuntarily as her desire expanded.  Her continued moans elicited a responding low-pitched growl in answer.</P>
<p>B'Elanna was unprepared for the panic that overwhelmed her suddenly.  She gave a sharp cry and tore her lips from Seven's.  They did not let go of one another for fear of collapsing.  Seven wanted to ask why B'Elanna stopped but she could not speak.  B'Elanna was trying to understand it herself.</P>
<p>Everything was going just as she'd planned it.  She could sense that Seven was more than willing, she was eager to consummate what they began in the bar tonight.  B'Elanna should be pressing her advantage, completing her planned act of revenge.  So what if she was enjoying it, it would just make it that much sweeter in the end.  But B'Elanna wasn't thinking about revenge, sweet or not, she was thinking about Seven and how much she....she what?  B'Elanna was utterly bewildered, she didn't know what she was feeling or what it all meant.</P>
<p>"B'Elanna?"</P>
<p>Seven's anxious voice made her name sound like a question.  B'Elanna looked up into her worried face.</P>
<p>"Have I done something incorrectly?  I am inexperienced in these matters and perhaps I have..."</P>
<p>"Shhhhhh"</P>
<p>B'Elanna placed her hand against the soft lips she tasted only seconds ago.</P>
<p>"You've done nothing wrong.  Believe me."</P>
<p>She laughed ruefully.</P>
<p>"You're wonderful.  You kiss....."</P>
<p>Her words trailed off as she relived those kisses in her mind once again.</P>
<p>"Then why have we stopped?  I do not wish to cease this activity. I- I want more"</P>
<p>She asked this of B'Elanna even though she was not completely certain what all of 'more' entailed.  She understand the actual physical behaviors involved but sensed that like the kiss she just enjoyed that there was far more to it than met the eye.  She only knew that she wanted it with B'Elanna.</P>
<p>B'Elanna looked up and contemplated the grand prize that was there waiting for her to snatch it up in her greedy, little hands.  All she needed to do was reach out and take her.  She willed herself to move but could not.  She stood frozen in place and tried to understand why she was about to walk away.  She took a shaky breath.</P>
<p>"So do I, Seven.  I really do.  But we need to stop here."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>The question almost sounded plaintive.</P>
<p>"Everything is happening so fast, Seven.  I want us to take it slowly and think about what we're doing."</P>
<p>For the first time in her life Seven realized that she didn't want to think, that she didn't want to analyze her actions or do the logical thing.  She let B'Elanna continue to speak.</P>
<p>"Please don't take this as a rejection.  It isn't, I promise.  I-I want you very badly right this moment but I can't let it happen."</P>
<p>"What if I want it to happen?" asked Seven.</P>
<p>"Trust me, Seven."</P>
<p>The hypocrisy of these words struck B'Elanna like a thunderbolt but she persisted.</P>
<p>"It seems really hard right now for us to being doing this but in the long run it'll be better for us.  We need to time to get know one another, to talk to each other."</P>
<p>"You and I have known each other for almost two years.  How much longer will we be waiting?"</P>
<p>Seven wanted something quantifiable.  B'Elanna could almost laugh at the earnest look on Seven's face, it was so dear.</P>
<p>"I don't know.  We'll have to see how things develop.  We've spent most of those two years at arm's length, we both know it.  This is completely different, we need time to adjust to this....this change."</P>
<p>"Very well.  As I stated, I am inexperienced in these matters so I will rely on you to determine how we should proceed and when."</P>
<p>She paused momentarily and then spoke once more.</P>
<p>"I only request that you do not take too much time or I may be forced to expedite the situation."</P>
<p>Seven's face betrayed nothing.  B'Elanna couldn't tell if she was joking or threatening her.  Then Seven quirked her implant for a moment to let B'Elanna know she was being teased.  B'Elanna laughed softly and patted the soft cheek once again.</P>
<p>"I'm going to go now.  But I want to see you again.  Soon."</P>
<p>"0700 hours in the Conference Room is only six hours from now."</P>
<p>B'Elanna groaned, "Don't remind me.  I'm going to pay for this tomorrow."</P>
<p>She raised her head and grinned impishly at Seven.</P>
<p>"And you know that's not what I meant.  I meant I want to see you."</P>
<p>"I am eager to do so as well."</P>
<p>"Good!  Tomorrow night then?"</P>
<p>Seven's face fell.</P>
<p>"I-I cannot.  I have already made arrangements to meet with the Captain for a Velocity match."</P>
<p>"That's ok.  How about the night after instead?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna reassured Seven.</P>
<p>"Yes.  It's a date?"</P>
<p>Seven searched for the correct terminology.</P>
<p>"A date."</P>
<p>B'Elanna confirmed.  She thought about sealing the promise with a kiss but didn't trust herself to stop. Instead she spoke softly to Seven.</P>
<p>"Good night, then."</P>
<p>"Good night.  I will see you tomorrow."</P>
<p>Seven entered the cargo bay and B'Elanna began the walk home to her quarters.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>The two days before their next date were hectic.  Several minor disasters in Engineering kept B'Elanna more than occupied much to her frustration.  She'd been looking forward to a night alone to sort through her feelings in order to understand why even though everything seemed to be going as planned but she knew that they were not and instead she sensed some unknown disaster looming ahead of her.</P>
<p>The memory of that day in the Captain's Ready Room was a dim and unimportant memory suddenly.  B'Elanna tried to recreate the anger that carried her this far but all she sensed was disquiet within her.  She felt as though she was moving towards some undiscovered truth about herself and something else.  She didn't have enough to work through what it was.  She only knew she could hardly wait to see Seven again.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>The women sat in companionable silence.  B'Elanna for all her tempestuousness was not one to tolerate inane conversation and Seven, now separated from the cacophony of voices in her mind, had come to appreciate silences when they occurred.</P>
<p>B'Elanna  looked down at the table where Seven's hands lay quietly still.  Impulsively she reached out a hand and softly traced the implants on her left hand, enjoying the mixed feeling of soft human flesh and cold, hard metal.  Seven started to draw her hand away, a look of confusion and embarrassment on her face.</P>
<p>"Don't," whispered B'Elanna as she held Seven's hand in place.</P>
<p>"My implants are unattractive.  I do not like them."</P>
<p>Seven attempted to move her hand out from under the Klingon's.  B'Elanna's grip tightened and refused to let go of her.</P>
<p>"They are not unattractive.  They are a part of who you are."</P>
<p>B'Elanna tried to explain.</P>
<p>"The part of me that is Borg.  It would be better if I could rid myself of that part of me."</P>
<p>Her tone was more bitter than B'Elanna ever heard from her.</P>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna  leaned forward and pulled the hand in question across the table, closer to her and curled it into her own small hand.</P>
<p>"Don't hate this.  It's like hating yourself.  That's self destructive and will not help you.  I should know."</P>
<p>Seven stared intently into the anxious, brown eyes of the half human, half Klingon woman.  B'Elanna shared some of her life story with her in these past few weeks and Seven heard the voice of truth and experience in what B'Elanna told her.  She nodded her head slowly.</P>
<p>"I think I understand.  I will take it under consideration."</P>
<p>B'Elanna continued, "I couldn't imagine you any other way and I wouldn't change anything about you."</P>
<p>She raised the hand to her lips for a brief caress.</P>
<p>At this Seven smiled and quirked her implanted brow, "Nothing?  Nothing at all?  I find this difficult to believe."</P>
<p>B'Elanna laughed and raised a hand in mock self-defense.</P>
<p>"I refuse to say any more.  I don't want to get myself into trouble."</P>
<p>Their warm glances collided across the table and for a moment they were frozen, caught up in the emotion they shared and each sensing there was more to the moment than they realized.</P>
<p>B'Elanna broke the gaze first and looked down at the table.</P>
<p>'Maw'tok!,' she swore mentally. 'When did this happen?'  It was true, it wasn't a game anymore.  It hadn't been a game in some time.  She looked up at the blue-eyed blonde who was looking at her with a quizzical stare.  Seven's question seemed to be internal, as though something just occurred to her as well.</P>
<p>B'Elanna swallowed hard as she accepted the truth of the situation.  She was in love with Seven.  She didn't know how it happened or when but she knew why.  In the course of her harebrained attempt to win the bet she'd gotten to know the real Seven.</P>
<p>The Seven she knew now, and loved, was not only beautiful and highly intelligent but also the most curious, honest, and guileless woman she'd ever met.  There wasn't a mean bone in her body and somewhere along the way B'Elanna came to realize that Seven wasn't the one responsible for the incident in Engineering that day nor the one later in the Captain's Ready Room.  She was.</P>
<p>She thought about what she'd been doing these last few weeks and she was ashamed of herself.  She wanted to tell Seven how she felt but how could she explain everything else.  And she would need to explain it all because sooner or later it would come out.</P>
<p>If she was right in her feeling that Seven was feeling some of the same emotions for her she needed to be the one to tell her.  Coming from someone it would be devastating.  B'Elanna worked so hard to get Seven to trust her.  She prayed that this trust would survive what was about to pass.</P>
<p>"Sev-" B'Elanna began.</P>
<p>"I would like to dance."</P>
<p>Seven began to stand.</P>
<p>"What? Uh- Seven, I want..." she attempted to pull Seven back into her chair with the hand she still held.</P>
<p>Seven looked at her in silence for a long moment and then spoke again.</P>
<p>"I want to dance with you.  I have attempted this activity before with no success but I believe that with you it will be....different.  Enjoyable.  Please."</P>
<p>B'Elanna smiled, Seven so rarely used common courtesies such as this.  It wouldn't hurt to postpone their talk for a few moments while they danced.</P>
<p>B'Elanna got up from the table still holding Seven's left hand and they walked slowly to the dance floor together.  The song began and was a slow, sexy blues tune from twentieth century Earth.  As they turned to face one another and their eyes met they glided easily into one another's arms perfectly.</P>
<p>The intimacy of the motion stilled them for a moment and then they began to move around the dance floor as though they had danced together a thousand times before.  As they relaxed and felt the warmth of the body pressed close against their own they moved closer together until they moved as one.</P>
<p>B'Elanna's head lay pressed against Seven's warm chest with Seven's cheek touching the sensitive ridges of B'Elanna's forehead.  Seven inhaled deeply, taking in the softly scented odor of B'Elanna's clean hair.  Both women had their arms wrapped tightly around one another. Their bodies moved in rhythm to the music as their senses ran wild.  The world disappeared and there was only one another in the universe they danced within.</P>
<p>The music came to a close and as they slowed their movement B'Elanna looked up into Seven's eyes and saw the desire reflected there that she felt inside.  Her lips parted slightly and Seven chose that moment to lean down and kiss her.</P>
<p>The kiss was soft and sweet, tentative but inquisitive.  B'Elanna declared her willingness to the embrace by answering it, letting Seven know she welcomed her attention and encouraging it.  Seven accepted the invitation and their kiss deepened as their bodies stopped moving completely and their entire focus rest with the connection between their two mouths.</P>
<p>A small, unending growl from B'Elanna's throat was answered by a series of soft moans eminating from the young Borg's mouth.  Hands began to roam without thought, exploring new curves and sensations.  Lack of oxygen finally ended the moment as the two women drew away from each other infinitismally, both panting and looking deeply into the other's face.</P>
<p>Almost simultaneously they both remembered where they were and they looked around furtively.  Except for a few of the holographic characters the entire room was looking at them.  They quickly looked back at one another in mutual desperation and embarrassment.</P>
<p>"Let's get out of here," muttered B'Elanna.</P>
<p>"Agreed," Seven spoke decisively albeit breathlessly.</P>
<p>"My quarters?" B'Elanna hesitated as she asked.  She didn't want to assume anything but she hoped.</P>
<p>"Acceptable."</P>
<p>Seven smiled at her as she said it.  The transformation was incredible as her whole face lit up. B'Elanna was transfixed by the sight.  She didn't want it to stop.  Seven pulled on her arm and B'Elanna broke free from her trance and followed Seven's lead.</P>
<p>They were almost out of the bar when Tom Paris stepped in front of them and stopped them.  Harry was in tow and seemed to be trying to pull Tom away from the two women.  Tom shook off Harry's hand on his arm in annoyance and blocked their exit.  B'Elanna's heart sank.</P>
<p>"I see that congratulations are in order, B'Elanna."</P>
<p>His tone didn't sound very congratulatory.  Seven's brow raised in annoyance.  She did not wish to speak to the Lieutenant at this moment.  She had other plans in mind.</P>
<p>"Not now, Tom."</P>
<p>B'Elanna's words were low and aggressive as she attempted to get around the smirking man.</P>
<p>"Why not, B'Elanna?  Wasn't that part of the plan?  Don't you want to Seven to know how she's been tricked and manipulated?  I thought you wanted revenge."</P>
<p>Each word felt like a body blow to B'Elanna and she seemed to get smaller.  Harry shook his head sadly and walked away from Tom in disgust.</P>
<p>"What are you talking about, Lieutenant?" asked Seven.  She was completely bewildered by what Tom was saying.</P>
<p>"Come on, B'Elanna.  You won the bet."</P>
<p>He thrust a padd at her.</P>
<p>"Here's the month's rations as promised. You won, fair and square."</P>
<p>Tom's viciousness was clear even to Seven.</P>
<p>"B'Elanna?"  Her voice faltered and she sounded scared.</P>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna started.</P>
<p>"You were great, B'Elanna.  You played her perfectly."</P>
<p>Tom was relentless.</P>
<p>"She never had a chance, did she?  You had her eating out of your hand from the very beginning."</P>
<p>"That's enough, Tom!"</P>
<p>B'Elanna's tone of voice seemed to get through to Tom this time.  He realized he'd pushed it far enough and it was time to back off.</P>
<p>"B'Elanna.  Please explain."</P>
<p>Seven's voice was calm but it was like the quiet of space before entering an ion storm.</P>
<p>"Seven.  Let's talk about this in my quarters."</P>
<p>She tried to lead Seven out of the bar.</P>
<p>"No.  You will explain it here.  Explain to me the nature of this wager between you and Lieutenant Paris."</P>
<p>"Seven, please."  B'Elanna's voice sank to a pleading whisper.</P>
<p>"This concerns the matter with Captain Janeway and our altercation in Engineering, does it not?"</P>
<p>She looked at B'Elanna and then at Tom.</P>
<p>"Yes."</P>
<p>Seven could barely hear the word as it fell from B'Elanna's trembling lips.</P>
<p>"You are still angry and blamed me for what occurred.  So you decided to seek revenge.  Is that correct?"</P>
<p>"Yes, but-" B'Elanna's head came up sharply and she grabbed Seven's forearm.</P>
<p>"Please explain the wager to me.  Now."</P>
<p>This was directed at Tom.  Tom eyed B'Elanna and spoke reluctantly.</P>
<p>"B'Elanna was angry because of the outburst that almost cost her her job.  She felt that your lack of emotion during the incident only made her look worse.  She was mad at you and wanted to see some kind of reaction.  Any reaction."</P>
<p>"And so you wagered on it?"</P>
<p>Seven was slowly starting to understand and with this understanding came a strange, sick feeling in the pit of her stomach.</P>
<p>"Right.  The bet was that she would try to get you to show an emotion, any kind of emotion in public with witnesses."</P>
<p>"I see."</P>
<p>And Seven did.  She looked at B'Elanna in horror as her world seemed to spin out of control.</P>
<p>"Seven.  Please, listen to me.  I-"</P>
<p>B'Elanna stepped closer to Seven and held her two upper arms trying to bring Seven into her embrace.</P>
<p>"Release me at once."</P>
<p>The coldness and anger in the tone brooked no argument.  B'Elanna's arms dropped to her side.</P>
<p>"Seven," said B'Elanna desperately.</P>
<p>"Everything has been a calculated deception. There is nothing you can say that will explain it."</P>
<p>Seven's world collapsed like a black hole within her heart.  How could she have been such a naive fool?  To think that B'Elanna might love her and want her as much as she did B'Elanna.  Pain seemed to radiate out of her from everywhere.  She could not hear or see anything, everything was pain.  There was nothing else.  She stumbled out of Sandrine's and into the rest of the ship.</P>
<p>B'Elanna stood and watched her leave, her heart frozen with despair.  Dear gods, what had she done.  She looked up at Tom who stood there.  He looked uncertain, trying to grasp what just happened.</P>
<p>"You, bastard!"</P>
<p>B'Elanna's fist connected with his jaw and the wave of pain and force of the blow threw him to the ground.</P>
<p>"Report me if you want.  I don't give a damn."</P>
<p>With that, B'Elanna strode out of Sandrine's without looking back.</P>
<p>Harry walked over and looked down at his fallen friend.  Tom looked up holding his jaw, a questioning look in his eye as Harry failed to offer a hand up.</P>
<p>"She's right.  You are a bastard."</P>
<p>Harry followed B'Elanna out of the bar, leaving Tom where he lay.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>If Seven seemed cold to B'Elanna before, now she felt down right glacial.  At the next senior staff meeting her blue eyes bored through B'Elanna with a look that seemed to say she was about as significant to Seven as the chair she was sitting in.  Any attempts B'Elanna made to engage her in conversation since the disaster in the bar were met with monosyllables or stony silence.</P>
<p>Captain Janeway noticed the change immediately and wondered at it.  She was so sure that they were getting along a lot better.  She even wondered if there was something more going on besides them setting aside their differences.  She'd sensed something but now it was gone.  She'd asked Chakotay about it but he was being uncharacteristically silent about the whole thing.  She suspected he knew but didn't want to interfere or perhaps he was protecting B'Elanna.  She was uncertain the reason but she trusted him enough to let it go.  For now.</P>
<p>Whatever was going on at least the meetings were quieter.  The two officers in question no longer contradicted each other the moment one of them spoke.  If anything, they seemed to somehow unconsciously agree on which of them would determine the outcome of a specific topic or project without any interference from the other.  It was uncanny and it should have been a positive outcome but Janeway sensed that their lack of interaction was actually detrimental to the teamwork that used to exist.</P>
<p>"Are the upgrades to the warp core almost finished," Janeway continued through the morning's agenda.</P>
<p>"Yes, Captain."</P>
<p>B'Elanna straightened up and tried to look only at her and ignore the blonde woman staring at her so intently.  She continued.</P>
<p>"We should be finished some time this afternoon and I think we can expect a 2% increase in efficiency as a result."</P>
<p>Seven stirred slightly.  The Captain and B'Elanna turned to look at her expectantly.  B'Elanna almost hoped that Seven would contradict her.  Seven tilted her head but did not speak.</P>
<p>"Seven, do you have anything to add?"</P>
<p>Janeway prompted her.  Seven was involved peripherally with some of the work done, mostly doing calculations since this would not require her to have actual contact with the Head Engineer.  She could just send the results via the computer.</P>
<p>Seven hesitated.  She struggled between her desire not to engage in anything remotely to do with the treacherous Klingon and her need to please the Captain and to do the best job possible.  Duty won out, it could not be otherwise.</P>
<p>"I believe that there are some other adjustments that have not yet been considered that would raise the results to 2 1/2%."</P>
<p>"Really?" B'Elanna questioned her skeptically.</P>
<p>Without another word Seven stood up and strode over to the large viewing screen on the wall and brought up the schematics in question.  She quickly outlined her proposal and then turned around and stared at B'Elanna challengingly.</P>
<p>She was mildly shocked by B'Elanna's response.</P>
<p>"Looks good.  I think we should do it.  We can do them at the same time we finish up this work.  Good idea, Seven."</P>
<p>Janeway suppressed a smile as she watched B'Elanna and Seven's interaction.</P>
<p>"Very well."</P>
<p>Seven regained her composure and sat down again.</P>
<p>"Seven, I'd appreciate if you would join me this morning when we begin the work.  I could use your assistance.  Would 1000 be alright?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna asked her innocently.</P>
<p>Seven hesitated.  She did not want to comply but to do otherwise would appear churlish in front of her fellow officers and her reputation had suffered enough in the recent past.  For a moment, she contemplated the idea that she cared about her reputation.  When did that occurred?  She filed the thought for later.</P>
<p>She reluctantly nodded her head in acceptance.</P>
<p>"I will be there."</P>
<p>"Thank you, Seven."</P>
<p>This newfound politeness on B'Elanna's behalf was shocking more than Seven, everyone at the table was staring at her.  B'Elanna continued to act as though it was business as usual.  Inside, she was falling apart.  She didn't know what prompted her to do it but she was determined to make Seven see her and talk to her.  She wasn't ready to give up yet.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna lay on the floor, the upper half of her body obscured by the panel she was working on.  Seven stood above her scanning the results of the work B'Elanna was doing.</P>
<p>"Seven, could you hand me the tricorder"</P>
<p>B'Elanna 's voice was muffled as she held her hand out, waiting for the requested tool.  Seven placed the ???? in her hand without touching her.  She said nothing.</P>
<p>"Thank you."</P>
<p>The silence continued as the work progressed.</P>
<p>"Now I need a spanner"</P>
<p>Once again the hand was held out expectantly.  As Seven placed it in her hand B'Elanna wrapped her fingers around it and unexpectedly wrapped them around Seven's hand as well.  Seven pulled her hand back like it burned and the tool clattered to the floor. An almost inaudible sigh rose from under the console.</P>
<p>"My-my apologies," stammered Seven as she retrieved the tool and gave it B'Elanna again.</P>
<p>"No problem."  B'Elanna's voice was steady and calm even if her heart was fluttering madly.</P>
<p>Unknown to B'Elanna, Seven closed her eyes tightly and gripped the sides of the workstation as she fought back tears and attempted to regain control.</P>
<p>"Hu'tegh!"  B'Elanna swore loudly as she caught her hand on the edge of the spanner and sliced through her palm.</P>
<p>Quickly, Seven bent down to look at the injured woman.  She grabbed B'Elanna by the waist, one hand on either side of her and pulled B'Elanna out from under the panel.</P>
<p>"What has happened?"</P>
<p>As she asked the question she saw the blood pouring from B'Elanna's hand.</P>
<p>"You are damaged.  We must go to Sick Bay immediately."</P>
<p>"It's ok, Seven.  It hurts but I'm not going to die."</P>
<p>B'Elanna smiled reassuringly.</P>
<p>"It's just a little blood."</P>
<p>Seven nodded stiffly as she tried to rein in her galloping emotions.  She swallowed hard.</P>
<p>"I am aware of that.  However you will be unable to work in this condition.  You should go to Sick Bay."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was sorry to see the concern fade from Seven's face as it resumed its icy composure.  She bit her lip and bent her head slightly so that her hair fell forward and covered her face from Seven's view.  At least I know she still cares, she tried to reassure herself.</P>
<p>"Yes, I'll do that."</P>
<p>B'Elanna agreed.</P>
<p>"Very well.  I will continue working until your return and then we will resume."</P>
<p>Seven turned back to the computer and began working without waiting for B'Elanna's answer.  B'Elanna stood there for a moment and stared at Seven's erect back and then she headed for the exit.</P>
<p>When she returned a short while later she found Seven still at work.  Seven paused and looked up.</P>
<p>"The doctor has repaired the damage?"</P>
<p>She enquired politely.</P>
<p>B'Elanna's smile was wry.  She wanted to laugh but was sure it wouldn't be appreciated, all things considered.</P>
<p>"Yes, Seven.  I'm fine.  Thanks for asking."</P>
<p>She couldn't resist verbally poking the Borg just a bit.  Seven raised a brow without comment and returned to her work.</P>
<p>"Right.  Let's get back to work then, shall we?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna crawled back under the workstation and they resumed.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna and Seven stood before Captain Janeway in her Ready Room as they completed their report on the upgrade.  Janeway praised them.</P>
<p>"Congratulations to you both.  You did an excellent job."</P>
<p>"Thank you, Captain."</P>
<p>B'Elanna smiled as she spoke.  Seven said nothing but she nodded her head in acknowledgement of the appreciated words.</P>
<p>"And for your next project?"</P>
<p>Janeway grinned at them.</P>
<p>"Because I know you have next project.  Don't you?"</P>
<p>She teased them.  She knew both these women were dedicated to their work and were constantly thinking of ways to improve their chances of getting home or at least speeding those chances up.</P>
<p>"As a matter of fact, Captain.  I do have an idea."</P>
<p>B'Elanna grinned back and clasped her hands together the forefingers of both hands pointing out at Janeway as if to make her point.   She began to explain.</P>
<p>"I'm thinking of some alterations to the warp plasma mix that could increase their output significantly."</P>
<p>"How significantly?"</P>
<p>Janeway was immediately intrigued.</P>
<p>"Let me show you."</P>
<p>As she began her explanation the two women listened intently.  She showed them the figures on the padd she brought with her for that very purpose.  Her fingers flew as she spoke rapidly, confident in the ability of the other two to understand what she proposed.</P>
<p>"Then if I realign-"</P>
<p>Seven interrupted her.</P>
<p>"This idea will not work."</P>
<p>"Wait, Seven.  I'm not finished yet."</P>
<p>B'Elanna was annoyed by the intrusion.  Seven continued as though B'Elanna had not spoken.</P>
<p>"The plasma will become unstable.  It will result in a warp core breach."</P>
<p>"That's not true.  I've run the calculations and..."</P>
<p>She tried to explain to the unlistening Borg.</P>
<p>"Then your calculations are incorrect."</P>
<p>Seven was imperturbable.</P>
<p>"Dammit, Seven.  Would you at least let me finish what I'm saying before you tear it all apart?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna was angry.</P>
<p>"Enough."</P>
<p>Janeway cut them off before things began to escalate.  It would do neither of them any good to continue in this vein.</P>
<p>"B'Elanna leave this with me."</P>
<p>She waved at the padd B'Elanna was swinging around like it was a weapon.</P>
<p>"Seven, write a report explaining why you think it won't work.  I'll read both of them and let you know my decision as soon as possible."</P>
<p>Both women stared hard at each other.  B'Elanna could feel her temper rising and knew she should leave at once.</P>
<p>"Very well, Captain."</P>
<p>Seven wasn't in much better shape.  It didn't seem to matter if she ignored the engineer or attempted to engage in normal conversation.  The pain was ever present and just seemed to get worse. She could feel her control slipping.</P>
<p>"Acceptable."</P>
<p>She masked her feelings behind the cold word.</P>
<p>"Dismissed."</P>
<p>Janeway could sense that they needed to leave immediately.  Both women turned quickly to leave the Ready Room.  They headed for the turbolift.  Only as the door opened did they realize that they were about to get in together, alone with one another.</P>
<p>Each hestitated and they looked at one another.  B'Elanna's face tightened, she was getting on and Seven could do what she damn well pleased.  Seven read the determination on B'Elanna's face and her own visage hardened in anger.  She strode into the elevator, turned, and looked at B'Elanna with a challenge in her eye.  B'Elanna accepted and stepped in as well.</P>
<p>They stated their respective destinations through clenched teeth and stood in dark silence. B'Elanna looked out the corner of her eyes up at Seven and stared.  Seven looked drawn as though she hadn't slept well.  B'Elanna wondered how that could be since regeneration didn't seem to work like sleep.  She watched Seven's features shift as emotions passed.  To her, it looked like more than anger, if she didn't know better she would guess that Seven was about to cry.</P>
<p>She felt all the anger lift out of  and floated away.  Her shoulders slumped and she leaned back against the wall of the turbolift in exhaustion.</P>
<p>"Seven."</P>
<p>She spoke softly.  Seven's head moved towards her and she looked her straight in the face.  Her lips clenched with unspoken words.</P>
<p>"Seven. Please can't we talk about what happened?"</P>
<p>"There is nothing to speak of."</P>
<p>The tone was icy and her face frozen.</P>
<p>"You know that's not true.  We need to talk about it."</P>
<p>B'Elanna implored her.</P>
<p>"I do not need anything.  I do not wish to speak of the incident nor do I wish to speak to you.  This conversation has ended."</P>
<p>Seven stood up straighter, if that was possible, and looked forward once again, avoiding B'Elanna's pleading gaze.  B'Elanna could feel her frustration mounting.</P>
<p>"Unacceptable."</P>
<p>B'Elanna threw Seven's own words at her and persisted.</P>
<p>"It has not ended.  You can't hide from this forever.  You and I are going to be on this ship for a very long time, Seven.  Perhaps the rest of our lives."</P>
<p>"It is of no consequence.  We will continue as we are."</P>
<p>The doors opened and Seven stepped out of the turbolift and headed towards Cargo Bay Two without looking back.  B'Elanna charged out of the lift behind her.</P>
<p>"I'm not going to drop this, Seven.  You'll have to listen to me."</P>
<p>Seven's stride did not falter as she failed to acknowledge B'Elanna's words or her presence.  Her long legs forced B'Elanna to walk swiftly.  In her agitation, she did not find this difficult to do.  They entered the Cargo Bay in this manner.</P>
<p>Beyond annoyance, B'Elanna grabbed Seven's arm stopping her forward momentum and swinging her around to face the shorter woman.</P>
<p>"Do not touch me!"</P>
<p>Seven's voice was tight with emotion as she jerked her arm out of B'Elanna's hands.</P>
<p>"Why not?"</P>
<p>"Because I do not wish for you to touch me."</P>
<p>"Liar.  Tell me the real reason.  Isn't it because you're afraid you might feel something, you might feel anything?"</P>
<p>B'Elanna taunted the extremely agitated drone.</P>
<p>"No!"</P>
<p>The retort was sharp with pain.</P>
<p>"Liar again.  You are afraid.  You don't want to feel anything.  Just like yesterday when we were working in Engineering. You dropped the spanner because you felt something when our hands touched.  And it scared you."</P>
<p>B'Elanna would not give up.  She would get some kind of reaction one way or another.</P>
<p>"That is untrue!"</P>
<p>Seven did not care if she was lying.  She could feel herself falling, she was confused with her emotions pinging around inside of her like frenzied atoms.</P>
<p>"BiHnuch!"</P>
<p>B'Elanna snarled the word at her.  Seven's head rose up sharply as she recognized the Klingon insult that accused her of being a coward.  She snapped her hand back across B'Elanna's jaw without a thought.  All she could feel was the icy, hot rage that swallowed her whole.</P>
<p>B'Elanna flew back with the weight of the blow and fell to the floor.  Before she could recover from the assault Seven was on her, incoherent in her anger and striking out blindly.  Fortunately for B'Elanna, Seven blows was relatively ineffectual as she battered at the object of her anger trying to force the pain out of herself and onto the Klingon who held up her arms in self defense but did not strike back.</P>
<p>The blows did not stop nor did their intensity lessen.  B'Elanna wasn't really hurt but she needed to end them.  She waited for an opening and quickly grabbed Seven's wrists and held them immobile.  She rolled her body and forced Seven to fall over on to the floor next to her.  She climbed onto the soft, struggling body before Seven could recover.</P>
<p>B'Elanna lay across Seven, pinning her down with her body and her hands.  Seven continued to struggle in her attempt to displace the Klingon above her.</P>
<p>"Stop it, Seven!  I'm not going to let you go until you hear me out."</P>
<p>B'Elanna tightened her grip on Seven's hands that she held above the blonde's head.</P>
<p>"You have nothing to say that I wish to hear," ground out the humiliated Borg.</P>
<p>"Seven, I love you."</P>
<p>Even B'Elanna was surprised by her own words.  They were not what she meant to say.  But they were true.</P>
<p>Seven stopped struggling.  B'Elanna pressed her advantage.</P>
<p>"I-I admit that this whole thing began as a bet.  I was so angry with you, Seven, after that meeting with the Captain that day.  I unfairly blamed you for what happened and I wanted revenge."</P>
<p>"Now you have succeeded.  You should be satisfied.  Leave me."</P>
<p>Seven began to struggle slightly.</P>
<p>"No!"</P>
<p>B'Elanna shook Seven's arms to grab her attention again.</P>
<p>"I said that was how it started.  But that isn't how it ended."</P>
<p>Determined to make a clean breast of the entire debacle, B'Elanna continued.</P>
<p>"I bet Tom that I could make you show some emotion in a public place.  He didn't care what emotion it was.  I was the one that decided to win the bet by.... seducing you."</P>
<p>The last two words were spoken softly.  B'Elanna seemed slightly flushed.  She did not stop.</P>
<p>"So that's what I set about doing.  Somewhere along the way, I think it was the night I taught you how to play pool, it became something else.  Something real.  It wasn't about a bet any more."</P>
<p>"I do not believe you," Seven spat out.</P>
<p>"I know you felt it too.  When we touch, the feelings that spark between us.  And when we've kissed... Do you think I could fake that kind of emotion?"</P>
<p>She challenged Seven.</P>
<p>"I think you have enjoyed the chase.  I believe you do desire me but it is as a trophy in the hunt to humiliate me and win the bet.  If you were able to combine the pleasure of our being together sexually with the pleasure of beating Tom you would only double your gratification."</P>
<p>Seven spoke clearly though her voice trembled momentarily as she spoke of desire.</P>
<p>"No, Seven.  I swear to you.  That is not true."</P>
<p>B'Elanna implored Seven.</P>
<p>"I have fallen in love with you."</P>
<p>"I will not be fooled again," Seven spoke flatly.</P>
<p>Frustrated, B'Elanna said "Fine, if you won't believe what I say.  Believe this."</P>
<p>Abruptly she dropped her head and covered Seven's lips with her own.  She poured all her feelings into that kiss.  Love, desire, and need flowed endlessly as those soft lips came into  contact with her own.  She did not demand, she begged, as she bit gently on the former drone's full lower lip and brushed her tongue lightly across Seven's closed mouth.  She asked for permission to enter, delicately but insistently, murmuring her love to Seven.</P>
<p>B'Elanna released her hold on Seven's hands as she felt the need to touch the woman's face, stroking it deftly.  The body beneath her moved at last but not in protest.  As Seven's mouth opened to allow her entrance she moaned with feelings that began to rise within her.  Her newly released hands came up to grasp the sides of B'Elanna's head pressing her deeply into her eager mouth.</P>
<p>Encouraged, B'Elanna continued her actions.  Their kiss deepened, tongues exploring one another in quick, hard motions.  Their grip on one another tightened as their passions rose.  B'Elanna's hand drifted down, caressing the soft breast she felt arching into her.  She could feel the nipple harden to her touch beneath the soft material of the biosuit.</P>
<p>Suddenly the body beneath her stiffened and Seven tore her mouth away from B'Elanna's, frightened.</P>
<p>"No!" she cried softly.</P>
<p>"Wha-?" Bewildered, B'Elanna tried to understand what was happening.</P>
<p>Seven took advantage of the moment and heaved B'Elanna up high and swung her over onto the ground.  She followed with her own body, switching their positions as B'Elanna body and head slammed hard onto the cargo bay floor.  Dazed by the blow, B'Elanna put up no fight as Seven now captured her in the almost identical grip she just escaped.</P>
<p>The abruptness and fierceness of the move made B'Elanna react instinctively.  She growled loudly as she attempted to dislodge the immovable force above her.  She could find no leverage and could not escape.  Reasoning gradually returned and she looked up into the face that she loved and stopped struggling.</P>
<p>"What's wrong, Seven?"</P>
<p>The remnants of passion on Seven's face were quickly fading as rage took its place.</P>
<p>"You are still attempting to seduce me.  I will not allow it."</P>
<p>She was on the verge of tears but she would not let this warrior see them.  She tightened her grip on B'Elanna's hands until she saw pain flicker across her face.  She did not release her grip in the least.</P>
<p>"S-Seven, you're hurting me."  B'Elanna said simply.</P>
<p>"I am aware of that."</P>
<p>There was no apology in her tone or on her face.</P>
<p>B'Elanna looked deeply into the emotionally wracked eyes of the woman who held her.  She saw the intense pain there and suddenly all the tension melted from her body.  Seven could feel the body beneath her relax completely but she did not change her hold on those arms.  A new emotion entered B'Elanna's eyes.</P>
<p>Her tone was soft when she spoke.</P>
<p>"I won't fight you, Seven.  I can't.  I've hurt you too much already, haven't I?  I won't do it anymore.  I love you."</P>
<p>Seven's grip increased as the words were spoken.  B'Elanna's body arched up into Seven's involuntarily as pain coursed its way through her.  She cried out from it and then quickly forced herself to accept it and relaxed once again.</P>
<p>Seven's voice was rasped with agony.</P>
<p>"Stop saying those words!  You are attempting to deceive me, still.  You know nothing about my pain nor do care you are about it."</P>
<p>"I care, Seven.  I may never forgive myself for what I've done to you.  I've been a fool."</P>
<p>A tear slipped from one eye as she looked up into Seven's face and followed the emotions she watched playing across it.  The tear seemed to enrage Seven even more.</P>
<p>"Stop that at once.  You are not in pain.  My pain....my pain is...."</P>
<p>Anger, hurt, and other unbidden emotions filled her so deeply that words became lost to her in the sea of feelings that swirled around her, carrying her away till she was lost and disoriented.  Seven looked down at the woman who watched her, B'Elanna's lips parted slightly as she breathed carefully in order to keep the physical pain away that emnated from her tightly held wrists.</P>
<p>"My pain..."</P>
<p>This time it was Seven who bent down and kissed B'Elanna but the kiss was nothing like the other.  Her lips were bruising and hard as they surprised B'Elanna and forced their way into B'Elanna's mouth.  The kiss was relentless and would not be refused, B'Elanna accepted that.</P>
<p>As all of Seven's hurt feelings poured into her B'Elanna absorbed it, even welcomed the punishment.  She tried to show Seven that she accepted the responsibility of what she had wrought with her acquiesence.  She returned the kiss with supplication, telling the lips that were attempting to destroy hers that she wanted the pain and would do whatever it took to sooth it.</P>
<p>B'Elanna no longer felt the pain in her arms even though the grip tightened even further at some point.  The pain she felt coming from Seven was greater and was all she could feel.  Her eyes opened abruptly as she felt splashes of wet touch her face.</P>
<p>Seven had not stopped her relentless assault on B'Elanna but now she was crying as she continued to ravage the pliant lips of the Klingon.  Sobs shook her body but she wasn't finished.  B'Elanna pushed herself up into Seven's quaking body trying to hold and comfort her without her trapped arms.  A soft, crooning sound pulsated through her as she tried to quell the pain Seven was floundering in.</P>
<p>The hold on B'Elanna's arms and the attack on her lips lessened slightly.  B'Elanna did not stop what she was doing.  Her face and body told Seven that she would not fight her, that Seven was in charge of what happened next.  The grip no longer hurt but did not allow movement yet. The purpose of the lips on hers altered its course, still demanding but no longer punishing.  The tears still fell upon her face but the body above her was quieting.</P>
<p>She met the passion that confronted her with her own.  Trying with all her heart and soul to tell the beautiful Borg that she was loved and desired for herself.  Seven's lips seem to hesitate and she looked down into the brunette's face who had nothing but acceptance and love written across it.</P>
<p>"I-I do not..." Seven stumbled, she felt she should apologize but was overwhelmed.</P>
<p>"Don't stop, Seven.  Kiss me again.  Please."  B'Elanna did nothing to initiate the move, it had to come from Seven of her own free will.</P>
<p>"I have hurt you."  She released B'Elanna's arm from one of her hands as she caressed B'Elanna's bruised and tender lips carefully.</P>
<p>"Not as much as I've hurt you," whispered B'Elanna.</P>
<p>Seven's head bent slightly and she bit her lower lip.  She nodded faintly.</P>
<p>"I love you, Seven.  Please, believe me."</P>
<p>Seven looked at her unflinchingly.</P>
<p>"I believe you.  And....and I love you as well.  I cannot fight it anymore."</P>
<p>The joy that crossed B'Elanna's face ended any fading doubts Seven had about her sincerity.  It was true, this complex and passionate woman chose her in her heart.  Seven leaned into her and the kiss they shared was one of undeniable passion and love.</P>
<p align=center>***</P>
<p>B'Elanna and Seven re-entered Sandrine's to find Tom and Harry at the same table.  They were deep in conversation and Harry was the first to notice them as they approached the table.  He abruptly stopped what he was saying.  Tom looked at his friend curiously and then looked around to see what quieted him so quickly.  He saw B'Elanna and Seven as they arrived at the table.</P>
<p>B'Elanna stepped forward with Seven close behind her.  Tom smiled awkwardly and greeted both of them.</P>
<p>"B'Elanna....Seven..." he drawled, wondering what was going on.</P>
<p>"Tom," B'Elanna nodded evenly.</P>
<p>Tom took the plunge.</P>
<p>"Look, Seven, what I said...."</P>
<p>"It's ok, Tom."  B'Elanna interupted him.  "Seven knows everything."</P>
<p>Tom looked embarrassed and sighed.</P>
<p>"Look," he said.  "I'm really sorry.  That was dumb of me...."</P>
<p>Harry muttered under his breath, "No kidding."</P>
<p>Tom gave him a dirty look.</P>
<p>"Tom, the reason we're here is I've come to tell you that I lost the bet."</P>
<p>"Lost the bet?" Tom said incredulously.</P>
<p>He looked sharply at Seven.</P>
<p>"I don't..."</P>
<p>Seven raised a brow and the look on her face challenged him to finish his sentence.</P>
<p>"Uh...." he sputtered into silence.</P>
<p>"No.  Tom, I did lose the bet."</P>
<p>At this point she turned to Harry and looked at him.</P>
<p>"Harry, do you remember what you said when we made the bet?"</P>
<p>Harry shook his head slightly, "I said a lot things.  Like don't do it."</P>
<p>"You told me there was no way I'd win this bet without causing a lot of trouble.  And remember what I said?" she smiled ironically at herself.</P>
<p>Harry smiled faintly as he recollected her words.</P>
<p>"That's right," she answered.  "I boasted to you that this would be no problem.  That I could win this bet without breaking a sweat."</P>
<p>Seven seemed to be amused somewhat at this point but she said nothing.</P>
<p>B'Elanna went on, "That may not have been an official stipulation of the bet but I have to honestly say that I did cause a lot of trouble.  In fact it would be safe to say...," and at that this point she turned and looked up at Seven with a smile on her face.  In fact it would be safe to say I'm in a lot trouble."</P>
<p>To the surprise of both men seated at the table Seven seized B'Elanna's wrist firmly and looked down at the woman with amused ferocity and said, "I must concur.  You will be in trouble for some time."</P>
<p>The two women smiled at each other, secure in their feelings for one another at last.  They turned and walked out of the bar, Seven led the way still firmly clutching B'Elanna's wrist in her possessive grasp.</P>
