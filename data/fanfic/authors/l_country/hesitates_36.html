<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 36: Home -->

<P>Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and squeezed it as she looked at Ty. Her eyes were
full of emotion, and she nodded at her wife, letting B’Elanna take the lead.</P>
<P>"Nara, we love you more than we can say," B’Elanna began. She looked over at
Janeway, seeing the older woman’s eyes locked on her. "But, <I>Voyager</I> is
our home. We will miss you, and our hearts will always feel your loss, even when
we get back to the Alpha Quadrant, but we can’t leave this ship, this crew. This
is our family…Our collective." B’Elanna smiled at Seven.</P>
<P>"Tach told me you’d say that," Nara said with a sad smile. "But we had to
ask."</P>
<P>Neelix came over to the table and shook his head. "Nara, your cooking is
quite a success. I’ve never seen anything like it," he said as he stood at the
end of the table. "The crew begged me to ask you for the recipe."</P>
<P>"I’ll give you all of my recipes, Mister Neelix. It will be nice for Seven
and B’Elanna to have some reminder of us," Nara said.</P>
<P>"We will always remember you," Seven said as she squeezed B’Elanna’s hand.
The exdrone had tears in her eyes and she couldn’t look at the Narian.</P>
<P>B’Elanna cleared her throat and reached around Ty to eat her meal. She
silently broke off a piece of her biscuit and gave it to the boy. He happily
chewed it, unaware of the topic being discussed.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The next three weeks passed too quickly for Seven but she was happy to have
the time with Tach, Nara, and especially Ty. She enjoyed as much time as she
could with her friends, but she had started up her regular duty schedule after
taking only one week off. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Narian children generally walked by the time they were one year old yet Ty
didn’t bother with walking. He went from crawling to sprinting, not wanting to
waste his time moving slowly. He dashed from one thing to the next. His two
favorite targets were B’Elanna and Seven, followed closely by Naomi Wildman and
Tuvok. Many nights B’Elanna would end her shift and meet Seven in the holodeck
with Naomi and Ty running the Flotter program. That wasn’t too surprising, but
finding Tuvok there the majority of the time had taken some getting used to.
Tuvok explained by saying that he wanted to make sure that Seven didn’t have a
relapse of her metabolic spike. That didn’t explain why he was usually on the
forest floor with Ty using him for a ladder. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>B’Elanna was on the same work schedule as Seven, and she too was not looking
forward to losing her Narian friends. B’Elanna tried to keep Seven’s mind off of
the impending loss of her friends, but it was an impossible task.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway found herself spending many hours with Nara, the spunky woman
reminded the captain of a younger version of her own mother, and it was
comforting to have someone on board who wasn’t a member of her crew to confide
in. She understood how B’Elanna and Seven had bonded with Nara and her family,
and she found herself feeling a sense of loss as they approached the system
where Tach and Nara lived.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn sat at her desk busily working on the latest energy consumption
rates. With Tach’s wheat replacing replicated food, <I>Voyager</I> had an
amazing amount of surplus energy. Add to that the fact that Tach was currently
helping to plant twelve fruit trees, and the energy totals would only be getting
better. Kathryn’s door chime sounded and she leaned back, glad for an excuse to
take a break.</P>
<P>"Come in," the captain said as she pushed away the data padd.</P>
<P>"Good afternoon, Kathryn. Don’t you ever take a break?" Nara came through the
door carrying a stasis tray.</P>
<P>"Time just got away from me," Kathryn said as she stood. "What’s that?" She
pointed to the tray.</P>
<P>"A snack," Nara said as she came up the step to Janeway’s desk. "I know you
haven’t eaten all day and I spent two days figuring out this recipe. I need you
to tell me if I got it right." Nara lifted the cover off of the tray revealing a
steaming loaf of bread.</P>
<P>Kathryn inhaled deeply, a smile covering her lips as her mouth watered. "It
smells wonderful," Kathryn said. "Where did you get the recipe?" She reached out
and took a slice from the end of the loaf and began covering it with butter.</P>
<P>"The recipe was easy," Nara said. "Tell me, who was this Betty Crocker? She
was quite prolific."</P>
<P>"She was fictional character used for advertising campaigns." Kathryn laughed
as she let the bread melt on her tongue. Her own mother would have been proud of
the baked delicacy.</P>
<P>"The recipes are well written, and precise." Nara took a slice of bread for
herself. "The hard part was coming up with yeast. Mister Neelix didn’t want me
to have it in his kitchen."</P>
<P>"We had a bad experience with cheese. It was contaminated with bacteria and
infected the gel packs… It did quite a bit of damage. I guess Neelix didn’t want
to risk a repeat, so he got rid of all the food cultures…including yeast,"
Kathryn explained.</P>
<P>"Well, I can’t imagine giving up on bread over a mishap," Nara said as she
flopped into the chair across from Janeway.</P>
<P>"I can’t imagine you giving up for any reason," Kathryn said with a sincere
smile. "Is that a trait with all Narian women, or just you?"</P>
<P>Nara’s eyes lost their spark and she suddenly looked very sad. "No, I wish it
were," she said after a moment of reflection.</P>
<P>"I didn’t mean to upset you, Nara," Kathryn said. She pushed the bread aside
and leaned forward. Her slate blue eyes darkened with concern.</P>
<P>"I am lucky," Nara said as she leaned back and crossed her arms over her
chest. "As are most of the women on Nador Omega. We are the descendants of first
terra-formers. Our ancestors were atypical, strong women who were allowed to
speak their minds. It is not so on Sha’Lar."</P>
<P>"Sha’Lar?" Kathryn asked quietly.</P>
<P>"The Narian home world. Sha’Lar means sacred land," Nara explained. "Ours is
a culture that has many contradictions. We worship the great goddess, yet women
are subjugated to the role of servants. If we lived on Sha’Lar, Tach would be
mocked, or worse for letting me have a voice in our home."</P>
<P>"I had no idea," Kathryn said. "It’s a way of thinking my people thankfully
outgrew centuries ago."</P>
<P>"Well, I’m lucky enough to live as a post terra-former. With only ten
thousand settlers, many of them are descendants of the original three hundred
terra-formers. We don’t waste our time with silly gender roles. We all do
whatever needs doing."</P>
<P>"What about the rest of your people?" Kathryn asked. She was intrigued by the
history unfolding with Nara’s tale and impressed by the strength her friend
showed in the face of societal oppression.</P>
<P>"Sha’Lar is approximately three years away at warp five, but the journey took
much longer when my grandparents made the trip. My grandmother was only fifteen
when she left with my grandfather. They were both top graduates from the Academy
of Sciences," Nara smiled, her pride showing. "Grandmother was the first woman
to graduate. It took ten years to reach Nador Omega, and they helped set up the
initial planetary meteor nets." She looked up at Kathryn and put her feet up on
the desk, smiling when Janeway’s only response was to pull the bread out of her
way. "Tach’s grandfather invented the laser targeting mechanism. There’s a large
continent named after him," Nara said.</P>
<P>"So he’s famous?" Kathryn asked, and she shook her head. Nara was entirely
too comfortable with her feet on the captain’s desk, but she didn’t want to ask
her move. "What does the targeting mechanism do?" Kathryn asked as she sat and
leaned back and rested her own feet on the desk.</P>
<P>"Nador Omega orbits through seventeen asteroid belts. Before the planet could
be terra-formed, they had to stop the impacts. The targeting mechanism aims and
fires the orbiting phaser cannons up to thirty-three hundred times per second.
It’s the backbone to the defense system." </P>
<P>"That’s pretty impressive." Kathryn sat up, her mind trying to wrap around
the necessary programming to fire that many times on a regular basis. "And here
I thought Tach was just a farmer."</P>
<P>"No," Nara shook her head. "He’s a brilliant programmer, and a damn good
pilot too. He was decorated when he served in the Stellar Guard. All of the men
are drafted when they turn seventeen and they serve at least five years. Tach
served eight."</P>
<P>"I look forward to seeing the meteor net. It sounds fascinating," Kathryn
said. "Although I don’t look forward to losing you or your family."</P>
<P>"Your crew has been incredible." Nara stood and put the stasis lid over the
bread. "I’ll ask Tach to call the Second Commander of the Stellar Guard. He went
to the academy with Tach. I’ll get you a first class tour of the
facilities."</P>
<P>"I love having connections," Kathryn said with a smirk.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna collapsed onto the couch in her quarters and let her head fall
against the headrest. She was exhausted. A blown out plasma coil had meant that
she had to spend an extra five hours working after her regular shift. She had
spent four of those extra hours on her back, crammed into a crawl space that a
Ferengi wouldn’t have fit into. It had been hot and uncomfortable and she had
banged most of the skin off of her knuckles as she used a spanner to remove the
burned out coil. All she wanted to do was take to a hot bath and crawl into bed
with her wife, but since her wife wasn’t home, she knew the second half of her
wish would have to wait.</P>
<P>She kicked off her boots, then stood and peeled off her sweat-stained uniform
and left a trail of clothes to the bathroom. "Oh yeah," she said when she saw
the fresh apple blossoms in a bowl near the tub. Seven must have left them for
her. Her wife knew how much she liked to use them to add fragrance to her bath.
She filled the tub with steaming water and was just about to step into it when
she heard the door to her quarters open. She debated whether or not to climb
into the beckoning oasis, but then remembered when Ty had dove headfirst in
after her on a previous occasion. She grabbed her robe with a sigh and headed
out to make sure Seven hadn’t brought home company. She leaned around the door
and saw Seven collapsed on the couch just like B’Elanna had been only minutes
earlier.</P>
<P>"Hey, are you just getting off duty?" B’Elanna asked from the door. She
noticed that Seven was wearing her adapted biosuit. It was blue and grey but had
a smock that she wore to cover her growing stomach. She had almost finished her
sixth month and her tall, lean frame could not hide her obviously pregnant
belly.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said as she leaned back into the couch and sighed. "We will be
reaching the Nador system tomorrow and the aft sensor array chose this time to
go off-line." Seven closed her eyes and sighed again as exhaustion settled into
every pore of her body.</P>
<P>"What was wrong?" B’Elanna moved closer, amazed by how much Seven had
mirrored her earlier actions. She sat next to her wife and kissed her temple.
Seven didn’t even open her eyes but she did smile.</P>
<P>"There was a gamma radiation leak that corroded the wiring to the array. It
took a great deal of time to find the damaged circuitry," Seven explained as she
rolled over and rested her head on B’Elanna’s shoulder. She nuzzled the fuzzy
robe and sighed again, but this time it was a sound of contentment.</P>
<P>"Radiation?" Concern filled B’Elanna’s voice.</P>
<P>"Be’nal, I had Ensign Harris handle the decontamination. I am aware of the
protocol forbidding pregnant crewmembers from knowingly exposing themselves to
any radiation." Seven groaned and rolled away from her wife. She tried to lean
forward to remove her boots but her center of gravity had her pinned to the
couch. "Lana, I am as big as a shuttle," Seven whined.</P>
<P>"I don’t even like you on the same deck with a radiation leak," B’Elanna
grumbled. "You should have been evacuated." She caressed Seven’s cheek and then
left a lingering kiss where her fingers had been. "And you are not as big as a
shuttle… maybe a class four probe, but not a shuttle."</P>
<P>"Do you enjoy our couch?" Seven asked as she tilted her head and studied
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Yes, why?" B’Elanna scooted closer to her wife.</P>
<P>"Because if you continue to tease me, you shall sleep on it," Seven
announced.</P>
<P>"How about if I help you out of that smelly uniform and we take a hot bath?"
B’Elanna offered.</P>
<P>"Smelly?" Seven asked as she watched B’Elanna stand and then kneel in front
of her.</P>
<P>"Kidding," B’Elanna said with a laugh.</P>
<P>"Couch," Seven responded. She smirked and lifted her foot.</P>
<P>"You’ll forgive me once we slide into that hot bath," the Klingon said. She
knew the water would have cooled enough to be comfortable for Seven. B’Elanna’s
higher temperature allowed her to tolerate much hotter water.</P>
<P>"We shall see," Seven said as she let B’Elanna pull her to her feet.</P>
<P>"Yes, we shall." B’Elanna leered at her wife.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven stood on the bridge at the auxiliary science station as <I>Voyager</I>
entered the Nador system. Tach and Nara stood at the back of the bridge ready to
speak to any of the Stellar Guard who might meet the Federation Starship at the
border.</P>
<P>"We’re dropping out of warp," Tom Paris said as the forward viewscreen
changed from streaks of stars to a beautiful solar system with a huge gas giant
in the distance and a scattering of planets throughout the area. The most
dominating features of the system were the many meteor fields. The closest
meteor belt was right off of <I>Voyager’s</I> aft side and extended out of the
scanners’ range.</P>
<P>"Oh my," Janeway said as she studied the massive expanse of meteors and
planetoids. "I’ve never seen so many meteors."</P>
<P>Tach moved forward from his position at the back of the bridge. "The field is
wide, it covers hundreds of thousands of kilometers, but it isn’t very deep,"
Tach explained. "We can fly over most of it."</P>
<P>"Mister Paris?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"He’s right," Tom said as he adjusted the course.</P>
<P>"This is odd." Tach rubbed his jaw.</P>
<P>"What?" Janeway turned and faced him.</P>
<P>"The Stellar Guard usually keeps ships out here on maneuvers for eight months
of the year. The new recruits spend days out here using these meteors for target
practice," Tach said.</P>
<P>"I remember," Nara said as she took her husband by the arm. "You’d be out of
contact for weeks."</P>
<P>"Why would they cancel the maneuvers?" Chakotay asked.</P>
<P>"That’s just it," Tach said. "They wouldn’t. This is one of the largest
meteor fields and the Stellar Guard tries to destroy as many of them out here as
possible. The recruits shoot at them for the eight months that Nador Omega is
out of orbital range of this field. The remaining four months we must rely on
the meteor net targeting system."</P>
<P>"The meteor field is immense. How can your people hope to make a difference?"
Tuvok tilted his head to one side.</P>
<P>Nara let out a bark of laughter. "Mister Tuvok, in the last eight decades,
the meteor fields have been reduced by over twenty percent. Hope is an endless
well, and we drink from it often."</P>
<P>"Impressive," the Vulcan responded.</P>
<P>"Harry," Janeway said as she sat in her command chair. "Send a greeting on
subspace to Nador Omega. Ask for an escort or at least permission to enter the
system."</P>
<P>"Aye ma’am," he said.</P>
<P>"Captain," Seven said quietly. </P>
<P>"Yes?" Janeway turned. Something in the tone of the former drone’s voice
alarmed her.</P>
<P>"I believe I know why the Narians would abandon their target practice," Seven
said. She had been using her long-range scanners to reach across the solar
system. "The forth planet from the Nador sun is displaying massive amounts of
radiation. There are also unusual heat readings."</P>
<P>"That’s Nador Omega," Nara said. She moved closer to Seven and looked at the
comm panel. "What does it mean?"</P>
<P>"I believe," Seven said slowly," That given the amount of sedimentary
material in the atmosphere… the meteor net has failed."</P>
<P>"That’s not possible," Tach said, but his voice was full of genuine fear.</P>
<P>"I believe Seven is correct," Tuvok said as he checked the readings. He had
routed Seven’s scans through his terminal. "The level of radiation and heat
would suggest at least four…perhaps five Extinction Level Events."</P>
<P>"No," Nara said as she saw the data. "Can you get more precise readings?"</P>
<P>"We are still a great distance away," Seven said gently. "Only the Borg
enhancements to the sensors allowed us to get this much information."</P>
<P>"Mister Kim," Tach said quickly. "Can you hail them using frequency 160.95?
It’s the channel of the Stellar Guard."</P>
<P>"Harry, do it. Use a general greeting. Tom, set a course for Nador Omega,
maximum impulse," Janeway said. "Let’s get a closer look."</P>
<P>"Already on it," Tom said as he finished his calculations. "Course set."</P>
<P>"Engage," Janeway said.</P>
<P>"How long before we get there?" Nara asked. She moved to Tach and linked her
arm through his.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Three hours and seventeen minutes," the former Borg responded.</P>
<P>"Harry?" Janeway said, "Any response on that frequency?"</P>
<P>"No, Ma’am," Harry said grimly.</P>
<P>Tach squeezed Nara’s arm, suddenly glad that Ty was in the mess hall with
Samantha and Naomi Wildman. "Try 94.25," Tach said. "It’s a private
channel."</P>
<P>Harry nodded and than then gave Tach a startled glance. "I’m getting
something," Harry said.</P>
<P>"On screen," Janeway said as she faced the viewscreen.</P>
<P>"This is Commander Betoc. Who am I addressing?" A Narian man filled the
screen. His straight black hair was streaked throughout with grey. His eyes were
dark, and deep, and his thick eyebrows were bushy and had almost grown together
in the middle. He looked at the screen, then his eyes widened. "Tach?"</P>
<P>"This is Captain Kathryn Janeway, and yes…Tach is a guest on my ship," she
said. She looked back at Tach and motioned for him to come down to the command
level.</P>
<P>"Betoc, what’s going on?" Tach asked immediately as he came down and stood
next to Commander Chakotay. His years in the Stellar Guard had taught him that
even with an invitation to join the captain on the command deck, that didn’t
mean he should stand in her personal space.</P>
<P>"Tach, thank the goddess you are safe." Betoc ran both hands through his
hair. "We had listed you and Nara as lost."</P>
<P>"What happened?" Janeway asked gently.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, I did not mean to be impolite," Betoc said. "We are dealing
with a planetary catastrophe. We have had multiple meteor strikes and are busy
evacuating our people."</P>
<P>"How bad?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"Level five," Betoc said as his eyes drifted down. "A freighter lost control
and struck the laser cannon at Astgar. We lost the link."</P>
<P>"The other cannons should have compensated," Tach said as he calculated the
damage to the system in question.</P>
<P>"It is Spring Solstice," Betoc said sadly. "There were already three cannons
down for barrel changing."</P>
<P>Janeway turned to Tach, dozens of questions in her blue grey eyes.</P>
<P>"Spring Solstice is the most dangerous time of the year," Tach explained.
"There are more meteors per minute than at any other time. The cannons overheat.
The system can only handle losing any three at one time. If there was a
catastrophic starship impact at one of the net’s key stations that shut it down,
meteors could get through."</P>
<P>Betoc nodded. "And with the electromagnetic pulses from the impacts, we lost
long range communications. We couldn’t call in help from the Stellar Guard. By
the time they returned, it was too late."</P>
<P>Tach’s expression grew dark, and for the first time since Seven had known
him, she saw true pain in his features.</p>
<p>"What does this level of damage
suggest?" Seven asked as she moved toward her friend.</p>
<p>"The carbon dioxide
as well as ash and debris in the atmosphere are at levels intolerable to
habitation," Tach explained grimly. "With levels this high, it will take decades
to repair the damage...and that’s using the most modern terra-forming
techniques."</p>
<p>"We have an even greater problem," Betoc said on the screen.
"The primary targeting array that was damaged... we can’t get it back online
because of the structural damage. The fission reactor is off-line and we don’t
have anyone who can fix it."</p>
<p>"How can that be?" Janeway asked, thinking
that if the Narians built it, they should be able to repair it.</p>
<p>"There
was an engineering conference at Caldori," Betoc said with a grimace. "It is, or
rather was, one of our coastal communities on the Tacarad continent. One of the
larger meteors hit two kilometers off of the coast. The impact caused a sonic
wave that toppled most of the structures even as the steam and vapor cloud came
inland. It vaporized all organic material for 200 kilometers, and then a tidal
wave over 300 meters high hit the coast." He looked away from the screen and
sighed, then turned back. "The wave struck the shore and continued inland over
700 kilometers until it hit the coastal range. There were no
survivors."</p>
<p>"None?" Tach asked as Nara buried her face into his
chest.</p>
<p>"None," Betoc confirmed.</p>
<p>Tach looked over at Janeway. "We
are from the Caldori province. I can make the repairs," Tach said.</p>
<p>"No,"
Nara said as she pulled away from her husband. "With the cannons down, it won’t
be safe. You’re not in the Guard anymore."</p>
<p>"Nara," Tach said gently. "You
know it’s the right thing to do." He turned to the viewscreen. "Have any of the
orbital cannons been hit?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Betoc said. "The array at Lesander
three. One of the meteors got through and hit it. The cannon station was pushed
into the planet’s atmosphere and was vaporized. The remaining cannons are
focusing on the larger meteors, but dozens of smaller meteorites are getting
through and impacting the planet." He rubbed his temples and looked at the
viewscreen. "Tach. If you’re going to help, you must hurry. We haven’t been able
to shut down the remaining cannons for maintenance and they are overheating.
We’ll start losing them within the day."</p>
<p>"What can we do to help?"
Janeway asked.</p>
<p>"It would be most helpful if you could provide cover for
the repair crew," Betoc said. "Our planet will enter the densest meteor belt in
just under 9 hours. With the trajectory we’ve plotted, we expect to lose the
station in the first volley. The cannons have to be online before we reach the
belt."</p>
<p>"I will assist him," Seven said. "I have engineering skills that
will be useful."</p>
<p>"You’re not going with him," Nara snapped. "My
bull-headed husband may fly off into harm’s way, but you two are not going with
him." She pointed at Seven’s belly. "Don’t make me call B’Elanna down in
Engineering."</p>
<p>"Let’s not jump the gun," Janeway said. "We have three
hours before we reach Nador Omega. I’m calling a staff meeting. Betoc, by the
time we reach your location, we will have everything ready."</p>
<p>"Thank you,
Captain Janeway," Betoc said. "I look forward to meeting you in person. May the
goddess guide your journey."</p>
<p>"Thank you" Janeway said.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p>Kathryn Janeway sat at the table in the conference room and watched her
First Officer pace. They were having a last minute discussion before the rest of
the staff arrived.</p>
<p>"We can’t interfere," Chakotay said as he crossed his
arms over his chest. This is a clear violation of the Prime
Directive."</p>
<p>"They are a space fairing race who we’ve already had first
contact with," she countered.</p>
<p>"Contact, yes," he said as he walked over
and stared out the window. "But that doesn’t mean we should go flying in there
and solve all of their problems. We can’t change the course of their natural
history."</p>
<p>"We’ve done it before," she said without getting
up.</p>
<p>"That doesn’t make it right, Kathryn," he said as he rubbed a smudge
on the transparent aluminum. "And you know it."</p>
<p>"They asked for our
help," Janeway said as she stood and went to where he was standing. "That makes
us a part of their history."</p>
<p>Chakotay smiled and turned toward her. "Good
point," he said. It was his job to play Devil’s advocate, but at the moment, he
didn’t like it and was happy to be wrong.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p>The rest of the command staff arrived and sat around the table. Tach and
Nara sat at the far end of the table and helped explain the situation. After
thirty minutes, they had a working plan. Unfortunately, Tach insisted on going
to the station alone.</p>
<p>"That’s insane!" B’Elanna said. "You can’t even do
the repairs by yourself. I’m going with you."</p>
<p>Seven’s eyes widened. "No,"
she said firmly. "I am the logical choice. I am stronger and have more
experience with alien technology."</p>
<p>"No way in hell are you going,"
B’Elanna said. "I forbid it."</p>
<p>The room went dead quiet as the entire
senior staff waited for the explosion. Seven turned to B’Elanna and folded her
willowy arms across her bosom, then raised one eyebrow and tilted her head to
the side.</p>
<p>"I am going," Seven said, not even addressing the fact that her
wife had forbid her action. </P>
<P>B’Elanna saw the edge of Seven’s lip twitch, letting her know that the matter
was not closed.</p>
<p>Janeway cleared her throat. "The last time I checked, I
made the crew assignments on this ship."</p>
<p>Chakotay smirked, not mentioning
that he was in charge of assignments. He figured it was not the time to cut her
off.</p>
<p>"Captain," Tach said quietly. "I am touched by your concern, but
this is my planet’s problem. It is too dangerous to allow any of your crew to
assist. I will fly my ship over and dock with the station and do the
repairs."</p>
<p>"I can’t force you to let us help you," Janeway said as she
leaned forward. "But your chances would be a lot better if you let
us."</p>
<p>"Tach, you are a stubborn ass." B’Elanna stood and went to where he
was sitting and spun him in his chair. "I’m going with you. You need help, and I
am the most qualified. It’s my right."</p>
<p>"Your right?" Tach leaned back
wondering if the Klingon was about to knock some sense into him.</p>
<p>"Yes,
you old goat," B’Elanna said. "You are like a brother to me... a pain in the
ass, obnoxious, condensing, teasing and annoying brother...but a brother none
the less." She smiled down at him. "So I’m going."</p>
<p>Tach was touched, and
looked over at Nara who was trying not to cry, then looked at Seven who was torn
between the touching display and her anger at being overlooked.</p>
<p>"Seven,"
Tach said as he took her by the arm. "I’ll borrow your wife, but I’ll bring her
back. You have my word. I’d take you...but that station is gonna’ be full of
radiation. That’s no place for a baby...even an unborn one."</p>
<p>"That all
right with you, Captain?" B’Elanna asked.</p>
<p>"Let’s get to work," Janeway
said as she stood. "We’ve got a lot to do before we get there."</p>
<P>The staff began to file out of the room, but Janeway stayed behind.
"B’Elanna, Tach, can I talk to you?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Tach said as he
stopped. Nara stopped and waited with him.</p>
<p>"Ma’am?" B’Elanna asked. She
looked over at Seven, who had stopped near the door waiting as
well.</p>
<p>Janeway looked at the two couples, knowing that the spouses had
just as much right to be in the meeting as did Tach and B’Elanna.</p>
<p>"Why
don’t we all have a seat," Janeway said as she pointed at the long table. "Tach,
I want some more information about these meteor storms. Just how many meteors
are we talking about?"</p>
<p>Tach sighed as he sat. "More than I can count," he
said.</p>
<p>"I pulled up the sensor scans," Seven said. "There are hundreds of
meteors that would be impacting if not for the phaser cannons." She accessed her
data padd and put the projections onto the screen for the others to
see.</p>
<p>"Kahless," B’Elanna said as she leaned forward and studied the
image. There were hundreds of streaks slamming toward the planet, most being
destroyed by the remaining phaser cannons. "It’s gonna’ be like flying into a
machine gun barrel! That’s not a meteor shower, it’s a sandstorm with sixty-ton
grains of sand."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you should stay behind," Tach suggested. "I can
try to handle it myself."</p>
<p>"That’s not an option," B’Elanna
said.</p>
<p>"She’s right," Janeway said. "Going alone would guarantee your
failure. What if you took the <I>Delta Flyer</I>? It’s a lot more maneuverable
than your freighter."</p>
<p>"No," Tach said as he pointed to the many meteors.
"My ship has complex programs that let the phasers self-target. If we take your
shuttle, we will have to focus on firing and not the repairs. It would take days
to convert my program to your systems."</p>
<p>"All right," the captain said. "I
don’t like it, but all right. What if I had someone else fly you in there? Keep
a transporter lock on you from the ship? Tom Paris is the best pilot I’ve
got."</p>
<p>Seven looked over at B’Elanna. "He is skilled. He would be the
logical choice," Seven admitted.</p>
<p>"No," Tach said. "The ship is only set
up for two in an emergency, and once we beam onto the station, we’ll need all of
the ship’s energy focused on us."</p>
<p>"Why can’t <I>Voyager</I> beam you
over?" Seven asked. "That would be safer."</p>
<p>"That won’t work," Janeway
said. "We need to keep away from the atmosphere, and we need room to maneuver.
The farther we are from the station, the better chance we have of shooting the
meteors."</p>
<p>"Looks like it’s you and me...brother," B’Elanna said with a
smile.</p>
<p>"We will succeed, Fas’na," Tach said.</p>
<p>"Fas’na?" Seven
asked.</p>
<p>"It means sister," Nara explained. "And since you are family... I
guess Ty will have to get used to calling you Nana. That’s Narian for
aunt."</p>
<p>"Oh no," B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "No way in Hell I am
going to be called... Nana B’Elanna. Forget it. It’s not gonna’
happen."</p>
<p>Seven smiled, but the captain actually laughed. "Well,
Lieutenant, how about Nana Lana?" Janeway asked. She was glad the mood had
lightened.</p>
<p>"No," B’Elanna said. "I’ll be aunt B’Elanna. That’s
final."</p>
<p>"Nana Ba?" Nara asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," B’Elanna said with a
snarl. "Why not just call me Ba Nana."</p>
<p>Janeway covered her mouth and her
eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with that?" Tach asked.</p>
<p>"A Banana is
a terrain fruit," Seven explained.</p>
<p>"So?" Tach asked.</p>
<p>"Hey,
brother," B’Elanna asked him. "Did I ever tell you what Tach means in
Klingonasse?"</p>
<p>"No," he said slowly.</p>
<p>"It means a tavern, a place to
get falling down, stupid drunk." B’Elanna smirked. "And generally, it means a
tavern that isn’t known for its cleanliness."</p>
<p>"Sounds perfect to me,"
Nara said.</p>
<p>"Well," Janeway said, "Nana B’Elanna, why don’t you and Tach
go do a last minute check of his freighter." She stood and looked at the two
couples, hoping they would all be together when the mission at hand was
finished. "I’ll be on the bridge making sure <I>Voyager</I> is ready for our
part in this."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain," Tach said sincerely. "I will do
everything in my power to return B’Elanna safely. You have my
word."</p>
<p>Janeway nodded as she left, her expression confident and full of
trust. Inside she was going over the thousands of the ways that the mission
could go wrong. She knew all too well from personal experience that one’s
intentions to keep someone safe didn’t mean anything to the universe. A meteor
hurling through space didn’t know or care about vows of honor, and faced with a
meteor, Tach’s promise was worthless.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven said their good-byes in the shuttle bay while Nara and Ty
did the same with Tach. Seven was angry with her wife for taking the dangerous
mission, but she understood it, and she wasn’t about to part on negative
terms.</p>
<p>"You will be careful?" Seven asked as she wrapped her arms around
B’Elanna.</p>
<p>"Of course, Be’nal," B’Elanna responded. "I have too much to
come back to. I don’t want you worrying. It’s not good for the little one." She
rested her hand on Seven’s belly and smiled warmly when she felt the child stir.
She bent down and lifted Seven’s shirt and then pressed her lips onto her belly.
After planting a lingering kiss, she eased back and growled onto Seven’s rounded
stomach. The baby began moving immediately in response.</p>
<p>"I will keep us
safe, my wife," Seven said. "You focus on returning. That is an
order."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma’am," B’Elanna said. She smiled and leaned against Seven,
wanting nothing more than to go back to their quarters. "Kiss me?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"Always," Seven replied. She kissed B’Elanna gently, letting her
love envelop the shorter woman and then pulled her tightly against her chest.
They continued the sensual exchange as each woman let her fear fuel the passion.
They broke apart, their breathing raged. "Come back to me and I will finish what
we just started," Seven promised.</P>
<P>"Nothing will stop me," B’Elanna swore.</P>
