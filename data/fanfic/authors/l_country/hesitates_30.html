<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 30: Hope -->

<P>Seven groaned and her fully human hand move up to caressed B’Elanna’s neck.
It took every ounce of concentration to force her muscles to do her bidding but
she needed to feel B’Elanna’s skin, to feel the warmth of her body and the
strength of the blood pulsing through her veins. Seven’s fingers were cold, but
B’Elanna turned her face toward them anyway, needing the connection even in
slumber. The Klingon was sleeping fitfully, having spent the last nine hours
laying next to Seven, holding her and listening to every whimper or groan the
exBorg made. Seven’s fingertips lingered on B’Elanna’s pulse point, the thrum of
blood surging through her body tapping gently under her cool touch.</P>
<P>Neelix was sitting with his back propped against a nearby bulkhead. He caught
Seven’s movement out of the corner of his golden eyes and stood up immediately.
He paused long enough to twist his back, releasing a crackling cascade as he
groaned in protest of the hours sitting on the hard deck plating.</P>
<P>"Seven?" he whispered as he made his way to her side. "Seven? Are you awake?"
He rested his hand on her shoulder and studied her face looking for any sign
that she was conscious.</P>
<P>"Umm…" B’Elanna blinked her eyes and then opened them completely as she
looked over at Neelix. His furry yellow hair was sticking up on one side and
pressed to his face on the other. "Neelix?" she whispered. "What are you doing?"
She started to ease herself out from under Seven and then felt the exdrone’s
grip intensify as Seven refused to let her go.</P>
<P>"She moved," Neelix said as he stroked Seven’s shoulder. It was an
unconscious act on the Talaxian’s part, as if he were trying to draw her out of
her dangerous sleep.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna noticed the hand resting on her neck and the way Seven’s
breathing wasn’t as labored as it had been. She looked over at Neelix. "Find the
Doctor."</P>
<P>"Of course," Neelix said as he rushed off to get the Doctor from the next
room. Tuvok had taken him into B’Elanna’s office for a discussion almost an hour
earlier.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna put her hand on Seven’s cheek. </P>
<P>"Hmm," Seven moaned and burrowed her face into B’Elanna’s chest. Her lips
parted and she sighed, then she let her hand drift down to caress the Klingon’s
breast. "Lana," she whispered. Her voice sounded like she was chewing gravel,
deep and raspy, and her mouth would need a great deal of moisture to even be
called dry.</P>
<P>"Oh, darling." B’Elanna shifted her weight and lowered Seven onto the
stretcher and kissed her face, dozens of tiny kisses filled with affection, but
placed gently on her skin so that she wouldn’t injure her recovering wife. "You
scared me." Tears joined B’Elanna’s lips on Seven’s pale skin. "You scared me so
much," B’Elanna said as her kisses slowed, her lips pressed a bit more firmly,
lingering as she used the opportunity to test the temperature of Seven’s face.
She was beginning to warm up.</P>
<P>"It hurts," Seven whispered, not quite awake yet.</P>
<P>"Where?" B’Elanna eased back and her hand moved down to Seven’s belly. </P>
<P>"There," Seven said. She inhaled sharply as B’Elanna’s hand touched her
aching abdominal muscles. </P>
<P>"Doctor?" B’Elanna half-yelled as she turned to look for the hologram. She
turned back to Seven and her sable eyes studied the deep blue eyes looking up at
her. "What can I do?" B’Elanna asked. Her brave Klingon composure was
crumbling.</P>
<P>"Hold me," Seven responded and tugged B’Elanna back down to her. She didn’t
have to ask twice. B’Elanna molded to her body, careful to keep her weight off
of Seven and instead settled along her side.</P>
<P>They embraced, and for the first time since the ordeal began B’Elanna felt
like she could let her heart consider what the next day would bring. She had
been focusing on the next minute, and avoiding what dawn would bring, because up
until Seven opened her eyes again, B’Elanna was terrified that she would wake up
without a wife, a child, or a life. She took a deep breath and let the tears
come. She knew that she wouldn’t have faced the day alone; she wouldn’t have
faced anything alone. She was ashamed that she had already taken steps to assure
that she wouldn’t have had to face waking up alone ever again. </P>
<P>"You’re awake," the Doctor pointed out needlessly. "Come on, now, Lieutenant,
up, up up. I need to scan her." He was in better spirits, relieved that he had
been mistaken about Seven’s chances. </P>
<P>B’Elanna slid off of the stretcher but held Seven’s hand, refusing to lose
contact for even a second. The engineering crew that was around didn’t give it a
second look, having gotten used to seeing the tough Klingon offer her soul to
the beautiful exBorg.</P>
<P>"Well," the Doctor said with a smile. "It’s about time those nanoprobes
kicked in." He looked down at Seven, his eyes actually showing his fatigue. It
was emotional exhaustion because his physical stamina was endless. "I take it
your little nanoprobe vacation is over?"</P>
<P>"Emergency Medical Hologram," Seven said coldly, her eyes looking more Borg
than human. "I am recovering…as is my child…no thanks to you."</P>
<P>"I…ahh, Seven?" He seemed lost, staring at his patient without any idea how
to proceed.</P>
<P>"How is she?" B’Elanna asked. She felt Seven’s grip intensify so she rubbed
her thumb over the back of the exdrone’s hand to calm her. Seven’s eyes never
left the Doctor, never softened, and if anything, her glare became more
intense.</P>
<P>"The fetus is doing well," the Doctor said as he focused on the familiar role
of physician. "The nanoprobes have repaired the cardiac necrosis." He looked at
Seven and flinched when he saw the anger radiating from her face. He quickly
averted his eyes and looked at B’Elanna. "It’s a miracle… one that I can’t claim
any credit for. If you…and the captain hadn’t thought of moving her in
here…"</P>
<P>"Our child," Seven said. She had regained her voice, but it was hard and cold
and trembling with emotion. "You will refer to her as <I>our child</I>…not
‘<I>the fetus</I>.’ You dismissed <I>our child</I> as expendable. I will not
forget that…ever." </P>
<P>"Seven, please, try to understand," the Doctor asked as he closed his
tricorder. "You can’t believe I wanted to hurt the… your child. I just didn’t
want you to die."</P>
<P>"Leave," Seven said. She turned to B’Elanna. "Make him leave, or I will."</P>
<P>"Doctor, will Seven be okay without you for a while?" B’Elanna asked as she
moved around the makeshift bed. </P>
<P>"Well, yes," he answered. "I just need to give her another dose of the triox
compound, and then she should be fine for now. I need to repair the damaged
muscles in her abdomen, but I can’t do that here. It will have to wait until we
can take her sickbay."</P>
<P>"Then leave," B’Elanna said. Her eyes were not as intense as Seven’s, but the
resentment just beneath the surface was obvious. "I’ll call you if there’s any
change."</P>
<P>"I was trying to save her," the Doctor whined. "Doesn’t anyone see that?"</P>
<P>"Doctor, perhaps this is for the best," Tuvok said calmly. "It would be an
excellent opportunity to investigate the matter we discussed."</P>
<P>The hologram glared at Tuvok. "Fine, but I want someone to monitor the
medical tricorder at all times. Call me if there is any change."</P>
<P>"I’ll see to it," Neelix said as he reached out for the tricorder. He was
still uncomfortable with the hologram even after the Doctor had healed the
bruises from the scuffle in sickbay.</P>
<P>"Please don’t let your anger with me keep you from letting me help Seven."
The Doctor gave Neelix the equipment and pointed out what he should look for.
Neelix had some medical training and he nodded in understanding.</P>
<P>The captain chose that moment to enter Engineering. She stared at the Doctor
as he left for sickbay and then went to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna said with a half smile.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, may I help you?" Seven turned to Kathryn and smiled
weakly.</P>
<P>"I think you should just stay right where you are," Kathryn said with a wry
grin. "Glad to see you’re feeling better. You gave us all quite a scare," she
said as she moved over to the stretcher and looked down at the blonde. "I am
ordering you to get healthy and stay that way. Is that understood?" Kathryn gave
Seven a stern glare tempered with genuine affection.</P>
<P>"Aye, Captain," Seven said, then smirked.</P>
<P>"That’s one order I will personally make sure she keeps," B’Elanna chimed in.
She went to the other side of the stretcher and took Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"Here, here," Neelix said. </P><I>
<P>*"Bridge to Janeway,"*</I> Chakotay said over the comm badge.</P>
<P>"Go ahead," Janeway said as she straightened to her full height.</P><I>
<P>*"We’re clearing the gravitational river as expected…"*</P></I>
<P>"And?" the captain asked. She had just left the bridge, and knew he wouldn’t
be calling to tell her what she already knew.</P><I>
<P>*"There’s a ship on long range scanners. I thought you might want to be here
for first contact. We don’t recognize the configuration, but it’s a good sized
freighter with phasers and a few antimatter charges."*</I> Chakotay’s voice was
calm, but had a hint of concern lacing through his rich tones. <I>*"How’s
Seven?"*</P></I>
<P>"Mother and child are doing well." Janeway smiled down at the blonde who was
still much paler than usual. "I’m on my way." She shook her head and rolled her
eyes. "Just couldn’t manage without me, could you, Commander?" </P><I>
<P>*"I know you hate it when I have all the fun,"*</I> he said. Kathryn could
hear the smile in his voice. *<I>"Tell Seven and B’Elanna congratulations.
Chakotay out."*</P></I>
<P>Janeway quirked her brow and frowned. "I’m the captain. I’m supposed to close
the channel." </P>
<P>B’Elanna cleared her throat and wouldn’t look at the captain.</P>
<P>"Well, I’ll leave you two alone. I trust Mister Neelix will be an ample
chaperone?" Kathryn’s eyes sparkled for the first time since the day had
begun.</P>
<P>Seven raised her eyebrow in response. "I am sure we would tax Neelix’s
ability to chaperone us, but we also have Lieutenant Tuvok… and I am not at my
best. I believe Engineering is safe."</P>
<P>"Glad to hear it," Janeway said as she turned and left.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway sat in her command chair and watched the main viewscreen as
they approached the damaged ship. It was twice the size of <I>Voyager’s</I>
largest shuttle, but it was bulky and cumbersome, obviously designed for
carrying cargo and not for speed. The ship was drifting, with severe damage to
its main nacelle, and judging from that damage, it had come through the
gravitational river with much more difficulty than <I>Voyager</I> had.</P>
<P>"Open hailing frequencies, Mister Kim," Janeway said quietly. "Looks like
they’ve had a rough go of it. Let’s see if we can offer some assistance."</P>
<P>"Open," Kim responded.</P>
<P>"Alien vessel, this is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship
<I>Voyager</I>, can we be of assistance?"</P>
<P>"They’re responding," Harry said after a brief delay. "Audio only."</P>
<P>"Let’s hear it," Janeway ordered.</P><I>
<P>*"Starship Voyager, this is the freighter Galnor. Any assistance would be
greatly appreciated."*</I> His voice was deep and sounded extremely stressed.
Static broke up the signal momentarily. <I>*"Voyager… our engines are
overloading. If you can grab us with a tractor beam, we can shut them
down."*</P></I>
<P>The captain looked over to Ensign Kim and raised her eyebrows in silent
question. She didn’t like the idea of having her shields down when there was a
well-armed, unknown element just off of her bow.</P>
<P>"Weapons systems seem to still be intact," Harry said.</P>
<P>"<I>Galnor</I>, if you’ll take your weapons off line, we’ll bring you in with
a tractor beam," Janeway said cautiously.</P>
<P>The static intensified and then the viewscreen flickered as the image came in
from the freighter. The small bridge was in disarray and a woman was in the
background pounding a console with what appeared to be a shovel. The small woman
turned and yelled off screen. "Tach, you fool, they think we’re a couple of
pirates. Shut down the phaser banks, you big goat."</P>
<P>The big goat in question walked into the screen and sat at the Conn.
"Shutting down phaser banks," he said as he turned to look into the screen. His
dark features were flushed and sweat beaded on his thick browridge.
"<I>Voyager</I>, do you have a pair of crewmembers by the name of B’Elanna and
Seven?" he asked hopefully. "Have you rescued them from Jusari Prime?"</P>
<P>Janeway stiffened. The last mention of Jusari Prime ended up with her in a
firefight on her own ship. "Can I ask why you want to know?" the captain
responded.</P>
<P>The small woman on the freighter laughed and tossed her makeshift hammer
aside and stalked over to the man. "I can’t let you do anything, can I?" she
asked playfully. "Captain Janeway, I am Nara, and this… brilliant
conversationalist is Tach, my husband."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled, remembering B’Elanna’s descriptions of the couple. Tach was
even more whipped than B’Elanna had claimed. "Nice to meet you," Janeway said.
"I’ve got two crewmembers who will be very happy to see you."</P>
<P>Nara smiled. "You tell Seven that I haven’t been able to get Ty down for a
nap since we last saw her, and tell B’Elanna that Tach’s been moping around like
his best calf died since we left." </P>
<P>Tach glared at his wife and his heavy brow blushed.</P>
<P>"Any chance we can talk to them?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"Actually, if you’d like, we can beam you over. I will need to have a
security team escort you until we verify who you are," Janeway explained.</P>
<P>"That must be the ‘fiery redhead’ we heard about," Tach whispered. The comm
system picked up his words and let the entire bridge hear the comment.</P>
<P>Kathryn felt her cheeks burn as she blushed bright red. Chakotay leaned over
and smiled at her. "I think that proves they know who <I>you</I> are," he
said.</P>
<P>"Keep it up, Commander… Tuvok would look quite nice in red," she told him as
she eyed his tunic and the rank insignia on his collar. She turned back to the
screen. "Nara, Tach, we would be honored to welcome you on board, and your
son…umm, Ty?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Ty," Nara said. "Thank the great goddess he’s asleep. One mention of
Seven and he looks around for her and just cries."</P>
<P>"How are our friends, Captain?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"I’ll talk to you when you come on board," Janeway said. She hoped Seven was
up to visitors. The two animated aliens on the screen seemed like they could
offer Seven sincere support and love.</P>
<P>"Great," Nara said. "We’ll shut down all the systems on board and wait for
beam over."</P>
<P>"Good enough," Janeway.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Well?" B’Elanna stood next to Seven, looking over Neelix’s shoulder as he
scanned her. </P>
<P>"Everything looks normal," the Talaxian said with a smile. "We must be far
enough from the Gravity River that it’s not effecting her anymore."</P>
<P>The doors to Engineering opened and the Doctor hesitated in the entrance.</P>
<P>"I want to go home," Seven said wearily. She rested her forearm over her eyes
and sighed. She was tired of being on display in main Engineering. </P>
<P>"Not so fast," the Doctor said as he came closer. "Now, I know I am the last
person you want to see right now, but…you need to let me repair the damage to
your muscles…please."</P>
<P>Seven lowered her arm and sat up. "Commander Tuvok will be there?" she asked,
looking over at the Vulcan. B’Elanna edged closer, then leaned down and kissed
Seven’s temple and began massaging the blonde’s neck.</P>
<P>"Yes." Tuvok nodded. "I will stay with you until you have recovered." Tuvok
had been worried about Seven, but the displays of emotion were very trying. It
seemed when Seven and B’Elanna were in the same room, they both became most
illogical. It was as if the two were in a constant state of Pon Far. He cringed,
remembering B’Elanna’s brief brush with the Pon Far when Vorik had initiated a
bond with her. She was fierce, aggressive and passionate in her distaste of
Vorik’s actions. He was suddenly glad that Klingon’s couldn’t initiate Pon Far
because if Seven and B’Elanna had the added fire of the Pon Far in their veins,
he was certain that even an ancient Earth firehose wouldn’t slow the pair
down.</P>
<P>"I will comply," Seven said. </P>
<P>"I’ll be with you all the way." B’Elanna pulled back and trotted to a nearby
crate to get her jacket. When she hurried back to the stretcher, she lost her
grip and the jacket almost fell to the floor. The Klingon caught it, but not
before something dropped from the inside pocket and bounced off of the deck
platting with a loud clang.</P>
<P>Seven straightened on the stretcher and her eyes narrowed as she stared at
the dagger she had made for B’Elanna. The Klingon reached out quickly, as soon
as it quit bouncing, and tried to cover it with the jacket. She was too
late.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres," Seven said harshly. "What is that doing here?" Even as she
asked the question the former Borg had a very good idea of the answer.</P>
<P>Neelix stepped forward in full ambassadorial mode. "I brought it to her," he
said. "She wanted to have something near her that you made."</P>
<P>"She has the jacket," Seven responded. Her eyes were locked on B’Elanna who
had the good sense to look guilty.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and moved to the stretcher. "You know what it’s doing
here…and before you blow up, answer me one question."</P>
<P>Seven nodded, too frightened and angry to speak.</P>
<P>"What would you have done? If I had been carrying our daughter and you lost
us both?" B’Elanna rolled the jacket around the knife and set the bundle onto
the edge of the stretcher.</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and bit her lip. She knew how much B’Elanna had been
hurting through the ordeal, but the idea of her taking her own life was a
tangible reminder of what her wife had been through. "The same," Seven
whispered.</P>
<P>"What?" the Doctor demanded. He was livid. "Are you telling me that you would
just kill yourself? Gut yourself right here in Engineering? What kind of great
warrior’s death would that be?" He stalked closer and put his hands on his hips.
"I will not have you wasting your life. I forbid it."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and shook her head. "You just don’t get it, do you, Doctor?
Without Seven and my daughter…I wouldn’t have a life."</P>
<P>"You did just fine before you two got together, and if this suicidal behavior
is a sample of what your union has to offer, well, frankly, I’ve seen enough.
First Seven refuses treatment and almost loses her life, then I find out that
you were going to just ‘fall on your sword.’ You two shouldn’t be allowed in the
same room… let alone to be married."</P>
<P>"Back off, Hologram." B’Elanna lunged at him and tossed in a growl for good
measure.</P>
<P>Tuvok wished he were anywhere else at the moment. "Lieutenant, Doctor… there
are other more pressing matters. We should get Seven to sickbay."</P>
<P>"Yes, of course," the Doctor agreed instantly. He was overwhelmed, he had
resigned himself to the possibility that he might lose Seven and the child, but
it hadn’t occurred to him that B’Elanna would choose death over life without
Seven. He would have been the first doctor in Starfleet history to have a
three-hundred percent mortality rate.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven whispered and pulled her wife closer. "If I ever lose you
and our child… make them hold the barge. I will follow in the next
heartbeat."</P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven’s forehead. "You’re fine, the baby’s
fine, and I’m fine. That Barge isn’t gonna’ be taking any of us for a very long
time."</P>
<P>"Be’nal, I am sorry I hurt you." Seven wrapped her hand around B’Elanna’s
neck holding her in place. </P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna murmured as she rested her forehead against Seven’s. "You
didn’t do any such thing. You fought hard and came back to me…again. Now, let’s
get you better so we can go home."</P>
