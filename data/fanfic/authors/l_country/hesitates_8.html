<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Eight: Voyager to The Rescue -->

<P>Captain Janeway had a knot in her stomach, and that meant something was
wrong. If you asked her, she would deny believing in such obvious superstition,
but years of experience had taught her not to ignore the feeling.</P>
<P>"Mister Kim, see if you can hail the away team on subspace," Janeway
ordered.</P>
<P>"Aye, Ma’am." The handsome ensign quickly sent out a message, never thinking
to question why the captain would need to call the shuttle that had only left
two days earlier.</P>
<P>Janeway sat in her chair and stared at the stars on the viewscreen with a
casual expression while waiting for Harry’s report.</P>
<P>"Everything all right, Captain?" Chakotay whispered as he leaned over from
his position beside her.</P>
<P>"Fine," she said casually. "Just thought I’d make sure our missing black
sheep haven’t killed each other yet," she joked. She often referred to the crew
as her flock, and surely her devotion to them rivaled any shepherd.</P>
<P>"Good idea," Chakotay said with a gentle smile. "Those two are like oil and
water."</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said, shaking her head. "Water isn’t explosive. They’re more
like matter and anti-matter."</P>
<P>Tom Paris nodded his head. "And just as dangerous."</P>
<P>"Captain," Harry said from his comm station. "I’m not getting any response,
and there’s no sign of them on long range scanners. I’ve checked their entire
flight path, all the way to the planet."</P>
<P>Janeway stood and turned to the worried Ensign. "Extend the scans outside the
flight path." She looked over at her Chief of Security. "Tuvok, scan for debris
and look for any sign of raiders."</P>
<P>"Aye, Captain," Tuvok said, having already begun the scans as soon as Ensign
Kim had said he couldn’t find the shuttle.</P>
<P>Tom turned and looked at the captain, his eyes asking if he should set a new
heading.</P>
<P>"It’s probably nothing, Tom," she said calmly, but inside she knew something
was terribly wrong.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Three hours later Kathryn Janeway felt like a cat in a room full of hunting
hounds. There had been no sign of the lost shuttle, and she was beginning to
lose patience with the sensors, the scanners, and the crew manning them.</P>
<P>"Report," Janeway barked as she turned to give Harry Kim a deadly glare.</P>
<P>"Nothing ma’am," Harry said as he continued to reset the scanners hoping to
find something.</P>
<P>Tuvok straighten his already perfect posture. "Captain, I have detected a
small nebula in sector 3259. It could be masking the shuttle’s signature," the
Vulcan said.</P>
<P>Janeway looked at her dark skinned officer, her eyes asking him if it was
worth a detour. She had known him longer than anyone else on board, and his deep
brown eyes were telling her that it was the only thing left to check.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris, set a course for that nebula." Janeway sat in her chair,
crossed her legs, and waited.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two hours later, <I>Voyager</I> was sitting at the Dengari board, nose to
nose with a battlecruiser.</P>
<P>Alloc, the Dengari leader spoke with an almost lyric tone, soft and soothing.
"Captain Janeway, we do not wish to enter conflict with you. Be on your journey
and all will be well." His face was tense and the thick ridges on his cheeks
reddened as he spoke.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so." Janeway remained in her chair, her shoulders squared and
her jaw set. Her voice was calm, and deep, and left no question that she would
not be toyed with. "You are holding one of my shuttles at your space station. I
want to speak to my people, now."</P>
<P>Alloc looked off to the side of the viewscreen, then nodded and turned back
toward Janeway. "That will not be possible."</P>
<P>"Why?" Janeway demanded.</P>
<P>"Because your crewmembers," he paused to look at a data padd, "Torres and
Nine, are no longer here."</P>
<P>"Where are they?" Janeway’s eyes darkened and her voice became even more
menacing.</P>
<P>"They violated our space. They have been sent to our penal colony," Alloc
said quietly.</P>
<P>"I need to speak to whoever runs this penal colony of yours," Janeway said.
It was not a request.</P>
<P>"Captain, you are in no position to demand anything." Alloc shifted in his
chair, uncertain of his own words. </P>
<P>"You can either arrange a meeting with the head of the penal colony, or I
will go in there and get my crewmembers on my own. I’d rather do this
diplomatically, but I will do it." Janeway stood, and crossed her arms. Behind
her, Chakotay mirrored her body language, folding his own arms.</P>
<P>Alloc hesitated, and Kathryn Janeway knew she had him.</P>
<P>"I’m waiting," she said.</P>
<P>"Follow me to the space station, but remain at impulse and do not charge your
weapons. All sensors must be kept off-line. This is a correctional facility. If
you wish to enter the station you must use the docking facility and leave your
transporters off-line." Alloc seemed more confident handing out orders. "Follow
us to the station and maintain station keeping 2000 meters off of the port
docking ring and await orders."</P>
<P>"We’ll be right behind you," Janeway said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After an hour of stalling, the Dengari allowed <I>Voyager</I> to dock and
then sent a ‘welcoming party’ to meet them at the airlock. Janeway headed the
away team herself, bringing Tuvok, the Doctor, and Neelix as well. </P>
<P>"Captain Janeway," Alloc said when the airlock hissed open. "If you will come
this way." He motioned down the corridor.</P>
<P>"Where are my crewmembers?" she asked as she moved into step with him. Tuvok,
the Doctor and Neelix walked directly behind her, followed by four muscular
Dengari guards.</P>
<P>"As I said, they are not here. I will take you to the Overseer’s office. She
will explain." Alloc moved quickly and said nothing more.</P>
<P>They stopped at the end of a long corridor and stood next to a large metal
door with a guard on either side. They nodded to Alloc and the door opened
revealing a stark waiting area.</P>
<P>"This way," Alloc said.</P>
<P>"My patience has limits," Janeway said as she paced the small room.</P>
<P>Before Alloc could answer, a smaller door opened and a woman stepped forward.
She was almost seven feet tall, and had long, impossibly straight, jet-black
hair pulled back neatly over her ears and had faint ridges on her cheeks. </P>
<P>"I am the Overseer," she said with a deep, sensual voice.</P>
<P>"I am Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship <I>Voyager</I>."
Janeway tended to use a formal introduction when she wanted to intimidate
someone, but she doubted this woman intimidated easily. "I’m here to get my
people."</P>
<P>"Their sentence has begun. You are too late." The Overseer stopped in front
of the captain and looked down at her, studying the much shorter woman.</P>
<P>"What was the sentence?" Janeway asked. Behind her, Tuvok and the rest of the
away team stood at attention, but said nothing.</P>
<P>"Two and one half years." The Overseer moved past Janeway and studied Tuvok.
</P>
<P>"For trespassing?" Janeway asked and then moved around the Overseer and
blocked her path.</P>
<P>"It is the minimum sentence for entering a restricted area. We cannot
tolerate any incursions into our correction facility," the Overseer explained.
Her voice was gentle as if she understood the stress the captain was going
through.</P>
<P>"I’m sure it was just a misunderstanding. If I could talk to my people we
could figure this out and find some way to end this amiably." Janeway edged
closer and gentled her own voice. "I’m sure your government has dealt with
cultural misunderstandings in the past. Isn’t there some way to work this
out?"</P>
<P>The Overseer studied Janeway and then nodded. "Cultural misunderstandings are
not uncommon, but we cannot allow our laws to be broken with impunity. Chaos
would ensue."</P>
<P>"Well, we wouldn’t want chaos," Janeway said with a disarming smile. "I
hardly think that two crewmembers wandering off course would start the breakdown
of your social structure."</P>
<P>The Overseer smiled and nodded. "I will contact the Magistrate and ask him to
review the case."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Janeway said warmly.</P>
<P>"Wait here," the Overseer said. She nodded at the guards and they exited
through the large door. "I will return after speaking with the Magistrate." She
turned and exited through the smaller door.</P>
<P>"That went well," Janeway said as she turned to her away team.</P>
<P>"Perhaps too well," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>Neelix stepped forward and whispered despite the fact the guards were no
longer in the room. "Captain, this place has a bad feel to it."</P>
<P>Tuvok raised his eyebrow. "Mister Neelix’s ‘feelings’ aside, I believe the
Overseer was too easily convinced."</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Janeway asked, wanting his unique input as well.</P>
<P>"The guards don’t seem to enjoy their work," he said.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Well," the Doctor explained. "They don’t even make eye contact. I’ve been
studying humanoid interactions, and these guards don’t want to face us. They
don’t like what’s going on here."</P>
<P>"Did it occur to you, Doctor, that the cultural norms may be different for
Dengari?" Tuvok asked. "It may not be acceptable for lesser workers to make eye
contact with someone of our stature."</P>
<P>"Enough," Janeway said. "I think we need to keep on our toes. I get the
feeling," Janeway paused and looked at Tuvok, "Sorry, old friend… I get the
<I>feeling</I> that there is more going on with this Overseer than meets the
eye."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Overseer entered her stark office and went directly to a communications
panel on the far wall. She tapped in several commands and then stood at
attention as an elderly man appeared on the screen. His ridged cheeks were
wrinkled and his black hair was streaked with grey. He looked at her and then
frowned.</P>
<P>"Magistrate," she said quietly.</P>
<P>"What news?" he asked.</P>
<P>"The Captain of <I>Voyager</I> is most insistent. She is demanding that I let
her speak to her crew." The Overseer sighed and cleared her throat. "She is
persistent."</P>
<P>"How long have the convicted been on Jusari Prime?"</P>
<P>"They began their sentence yesterday," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>"Does Captain Janeway understand Jusari Prime’s unique nature?"</P>
<P>"No, Magistrate. She has no idea. What should I do?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Stall her. Tell her that I have to mediate a dispute and I will return in
seven days. After she objects, argue with her for at least an hour, then return
to your office and wait another hour. Then go tell her that I have canceled my
mediation and will arrive in four days." The Magistrate smiled and picked up a
small statue from his desk. "Justice will be served."</P>
<P>"Yes, sir. And if she discovers the temporal differential?"</P>
<P>"See that she doesn’t. In five days their sentence will be completed. You
know the law. If they do not serve their term, you as Overseer will complete the
sentence."</P>
<P>"Yes, Magistrate," she said. </P>
<P>"Good day," he said and then closed the channel.</P>
<P>The Overseer accessed the panel and an image of Jusari Prime appeared. It was
a blue and white planet with swirling patterns around its length. The poles had
deep sinkholes dipping into the core of the planet. She sighed and rubbed her
ridged cheek, wishing she hadn’t been born into her position as Overseer. She
would see that the sentence was served, if only to avoid being sent to Jusari
Prime herself. She didn’t like the idea of spending even a second on the planet
that existed outside regular timespace causing it to experience an accelerated
existence. She sighed and sat in her chair and decided to let the Starfleet
captain wait a while longer. She briefly wondered what had become of the two
officers in question, knowing that they would have already experienced months on
the planet. She pushed the idea from her mind. As Overseer, such thoughts were
unacceptable.</P>
