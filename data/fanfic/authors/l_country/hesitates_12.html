<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Twelve: Revelations -->

<P>"I want my people off that planet now," Captain Janeway demanded as she
stalked into the Overseer’s office and grabbed the data padd from the tall
woman’s hand.</P>
<P>"I have already informed you…" the Overseer began.</P>
<P>"I don’t care," Janeway said, her voice dangerous and deep. "You led me to
believe they were in a prison, not thrown into a free for all where they would
be stalked like animals."</P>
<P>"Someone on my staff has been a bit too generous with information," she said
as she came around her desk and took the data padd back from the smaller
woman.</P>
<P>"Thank you for not insulting my intelligence by denying it. I want my people
and I want them now." Janeway looked up at the imposing woman and locked her in
her gaze, daring the Overseer to argue.</P>
<P>"I wish I could help you, Captain, but it is not within my power," the
Overseer said quietly.</P>
<P>"Not good enough," Janeway said menacingly. "Give me the coordinates and I’ll
get them myself."</P>
<P>"I’m afraid it will take you seventeen years to get there at maximum warp."
The Overseer moved the comm panel on the wall. "Unless you have access to your
own wormhole."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Janeway moved closer to her, inside the taller
woman’s comfort zone, causing her lean away from the small but imposing
captain.</P>
<P>"The Nebula is artificial, as is the wormhole it conceals. Without the
wormhole, there is no way for you to reach Jusari Prime."</P>
<P>"Then I’ll use your wormhole," Janeway said. Her mind was reeling at the
possibilities an artificial wormhole represented, but until she had her missing
crewmembers, that would have to wait.</P>
<P>"That will not happen." The Overseer shook her head slowly and laced her
fingers together under her chin.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway challenged.</P>
<P>"Your ship is not able to access the wormhole or handle the gravimetric
stress once inside." She sighed and studied the captain and then stared at the
comm panel. "Even if your ship could handle the increased stress, the wormhole
cannot be opened on a whim."</P>
<P>"A Whim?" Janeway put her hand across the comm panel and leaned against the
wall. "I don’t call rescuing my people a whim."</P>
<P>"A poor choice of words," she replied. "What I meant, captain, was that the
wormhole opens when it opens. We know the gateway schedule, but you do not. And
before you think about using the previous battlecrusier flights into the nebula
to decipher the timetable, you should know that it changes each day. We have no
control over it, but after years of study we do know its complex cycle."</P>
<P>"Sounds like you’ve covered every angle." Janeway turned and rested her back
against the comm panel. "The problem is, you’ve lied to me so many times, I
don’t believe you."</P>
<P>"Your beliefs are immaterial," the Overseer said. She looked into Janeway’s
eyes and for the first time, allowed her remorse to show. "It is too late," she
whispered.</P>
<P>"What does that mean?" Janeway asked. She felt fear grip her, squeezing her
heart, pushing her down into a place so dark she wasn’t sure she could ever
climb back out. Her mind supplied the worst case scenario, that they were both
already dead.</P>
<P>"The Magistrate will be here before we can dispatch a retrieval ship. You
must speak with him, and he does not share my attitudes about this issue," she
explained.</P>
<P>"Are they alive?" </P>
<P>"As far as I know," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>"I want to know everything about this planet that you do," Janeway
demanded.</P>
<P>The Overseer said nothing for a moment as she considered the request. She
nodded and went to the comm panel. "I can show you an image of the planet, but
it will not show you much beyond the climate and continental configuration."</P>
<P>"It’s a start," Janeway moved closer to the panel and waited while the other
woman pulled up the data. The image filled the screen; Janeway stiffened and her
jaw clenched as she recognized the unusual make up of the planet. "What is the
temporal differential?" Janeway asked, her voice at its most deadly
register.</P>
<P>"I, you… how did you know?" The Overseer stepped away from the captain,
surprised by Janeway’s recognition of a planetary mutation she hadn’t know
existed anywhere else and more than a little intimidated by the chilling quality
of the small woman’s voice.</P>
<P>Janeway turned and grabbed the taller woman by the jacket and shoved her
against the wall, surprising the Overseer with her strength. "What is the
temporal differential?" </P>
<P>"Time moves 180 times faster on Jusari Prime than in the rest of the
Universe." The Overseer’s voice cracked. "By the time we can recover your
people, their sentence will be complete. Each day here is more than a half year
for them."</P>
<P>Janeway pushed away from the taller woman, her hands shaking. Every instinct
told her to choke the life out of the woman in front of her, but she was a
Starfleet Captain, and she would not give in to the primal desire. She walked to
the door and took several deep breaths before turning.</P>
<P>"I want to talk to someone who has been there," Janeway stated.</P>
<P>"That isn’t… I…I will arrange it. There is a group docking in two hours. You
may observe their arrival, but I cannot allow you to speak with them." The
Overseer saw the determined look on Janeway’s face. "It is the best I can do.
The Magistrate will be displeased that I have even offered to let you witness
their arrival." </P>
<P>"<I>Displeased</I>? I don’t think you have any idea of how <I>displeased</I>
I am, and you don’t want to see what that is going to mean to you." The
captain’s eyes narrowed, they were cold, showing no hint of the compassion
Janeway was known for.</P>
<P>"You may witness the arrival… and no more," the Overseer said. She reached
down and signaled for the guard and the door opened. The guard immediately
stepped inside.</P>
<P>"Overseer?" he asked.</P>
<P>"See the captain to her ship, and then escort her and her party to the
observation room for the next arrival."</P>
<P>"Ma’am?" he asked, obviously confused.</P>
<P>"You have my orders," the Overseer said and turned her back to the captain.
</P>
<P>"Yes, Overseer," he said. </P>
<P>Janeway followed without a word. She was too busy picturing Seven and
B’Elanna and wondering how they could survive on the planet. She walked back to
<I>Voyager</I>, her thoughts traveling back to Seven. She was still so new to
humanity and Kathryn wondered what emotional scars the beautiful young woman
would return with. She had only been on <I>Voyager</I> for three years, but she
had made so much progress. Now, trapped for almost as long on a planet full of
inmates without any humanity, all of that had probably been erased. She hoped
B’Elanna could look beyond her dislike of the tall blonde and keep her safe,
although, even as that thought crossed her mind she felt guilty. Of course
B’Elanna would do everything she could to keep Seven out of harm’s way. The
Klingon was an honorable woman with fierce loyalties to her crew. She would give
her life to save any of <I>Voyager’s</I> crew. A shiver ran through the
captain’s spine as she realized that the situation could very easily call for
that. "<I>Keep each other safe,"</I> Kathryn thought as she reached the docking
clamp to her ship. "<I>And for god’s sake don’t kill each other." </I></P>
<P>She entered the familiar corridors of her ship and headed for the bridge so
that she could call the senior staff together. On her way, she passed the
holodeck and briefly thought of Michael Sullivan. The weight of the past hit her
like a phaser blast. She couldn’t love him…it. It wasn’t real; she couldn’t go
to him and share her anguish because he could no more understand the dilemma
than he could walk off of the holodeck. Worse, she realized as she continued
toward the turbolift, there was someone she desperately needed to talk to,
needed to touch, if only for an instant to get the grounding sense of peace
their connection always offered. That someone was on Jusari Prime. </P><I>
<P>"I’m in love with her," </I>Kathryn thought, the words shocking her, causing
her to stop and lean against the wall for support. "<I>It’s always been
her.</I>" She pictured Seven standing in Astrometrics, smirking when she had
just pointed out some error the rest of the crew had missed. She remembered the
day on the shuttle when Seven had been convinced a conspiracy would be her
undoing. She remembered in exacting detail how she had asked the former Borg to
trust her, and how relief had washed through her when the forcefield came down.
She remembered kneeling down beside Seven, so close that she could see the tiny
crinkles around Seven’s eyes that were evidence of her fear, but something else
had been revealed as well. Seven eyes were a deep blue, so deep they begged to
be drowned in, blue and pleading. Those eyes that so many saw as cold chips of
ice were full of life and hope and love. "<I>She loves me,"</I> some part of
Kathryn’s mind had whispered as she had knelt at Seven’s feet like a lover
proposing marriage. That was the moment, the moment that sent her running to the
holodeck like a coward to find someone, something, to hide behind. Her love for
Seven had peeked out on the shuttle, and Kathryn had run screaming for the
nearest exit.</P>
<P>"You have to be all right, Seven," Kathryn whispered in the empty corridor.
"Come back to me and I swear I won’t let my fear stand in our way." She entered
the turbolift replaying her last conversations with Seven and realized how much
she had hurt the woman she loved. Seven had struck out at the Michael Sullivan
character, and Kathryn had missed the jealousy it exposed. "Come home to me,"
she whispered before ordering the lift to the bridge.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Snow fell lightly each day on Jusari Prime and the weeks passed quickly. The
adults in the Homestead adjusted to the routine established by its newest
member. The tiny child had a name bigger than he was. Tyralanar had been Nara’s
favorite uncle, and she proudly gave her son his name, but it was quickly
shortened to Ty. She would reserve the use of his full name for when he was
older and in trouble, much like humans who only used a child’s first and middle
name when serious discipline was about to ensue.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tach seemed content to stay at the cabin with his new son, which was fine
with B’Elanna and Seven. They would go out each morning to hunt, relishing the
time alone in the beautiful snow covered setting, although Seven let B’Elanna do
the actual killing. When Tach and B’Elanna had gone out at the break of dawn,
they quickly found a few rabbits to bring down and returned in a few hours. With
Seven along there seemed to be no reason to hurry. The two women took their
time, often pausing under the cover of a tree to just hold each other and enjoy
their surroundings. They would eventually find a rabbit or small deer, and
sometimes they would watch the animals going about the forest. B’Elanna learned
quickly to kill and dress out their meal before ‘nature watching’ because once
they had seen a rabbit hopping around in the snow or wrinkling its nose, Seven
invariably found some reason to spare the animal. Of course it was always a
logical, unemotional reason; it was too thin, or too small, or it had too much
fat, or it looked tough. B’Elanna would frown and grimly agree that yes, it was
a miserable looking animal and they would find another. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The day came to repay Kahless, and B’Elanna was both excited and nervous.
Tach had prepared the sweathouse in only a few hours, creating a domed frame and
covering it with heavy hides. He built a huge fire at the front and placed
carefully chosen stones to heat while he waited for B’Elanna to arrive.</P>
<P>"It is ready," Nara said as she stomped the snow off of her boots. She was
standing in the doorway with a smile B’Elanna couldn’t quite identify.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she wrapped herself in a thick cloak. "I’m almost
ready."</P>
<P>"We are almost ready," Seven corrected as she stood up from the chair next to
the hearth. She cradled Ty in her arms, his face nuzzling her breast as if he
expected her to provide a warm meal like his mother always did.</P>
<P>"Wait a minute." B’Elanna turned and shook her head. "I made this promise and
I will pay the debt. You are not going through this."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked as she walked past the flustered Klingon and handed Ty
to his mother. Nara smirked and went to her bedroom to change Ty’s clothes.</P>
<P>"Seven, you have no idea what this involves. It’s very demanding." B’Elanna
stood with her hands on her hips watching helplessly as Seven gathered a thick
fur cloak around her willowy frame.</P>
<P>"Are you implying that I am unable to handle its demands?" Seven leaned over
a stack of diapers and grabbed her boots.</P>
<P>"Well, no…I…" B’Elanna growled and threw her hands into the air. She was
screwed and she knew it. If she agreed that her wife couldn’t handle the ordeal
the stubborn blonde would do it just to prove her wrong, and if she conceded
that Seven could handle it, well, Seven would climb into the sweathouse with
her.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven asked with a knowing smile.</P>
<P>"Fine, but don’t come crying to me when it gets too hot," B’Elanna
grumbled.</P>
<P>"Borg do not cry," Seven said as she pulled B’Elanna into a gentle kiss.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well…what was I saying?" B’Elanna leaned against Seven and pulled her
face down for another kiss.</P>
<P>Nara cleared her throat, but the two women didn’t break their kiss. She
cleared it again, more loudly, and rolled her eyes as the two deepened the kiss.
"Let’s go," the tiny woman finally ordered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven looked at the sweathouse and thought it was the most incorrect
designation anyone could have come up with. It was a fur hut in the snow, and
she couldn’t imagine anyone sweating with the foot and half of snow that covered
the surrounding area. To call the structure a house was indeed generous. She
knew that even B’Elanna couldn’t stand up in it, and doubted she and her spouse
would be able to fit inside at the same time. </P>
<P>"You can still back out," B’Elanna said smugly as if reading Seven’s
mind.</P>
<P>"I will…adapt." Seven looked over at Tach who had settled by the fire with
his back to the sweathouse. He had Ty on his lap and was telling the infant some
long involved tale.</P>
<P>"Okay," Nara said crisply. "Take off those clothes."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened. "I am already cold. How am I supposed to sweat if I
remove my clothing?"</P>
<P>"Strip, Borg," B’Elanna said as she began tossing her clothes into a pile
next to the small dwelling.</P>
<P>Seven glanced back at Tach, and once she was convinced that he was not
looking at her wife, she smiled. "We are both going to be nude?" she asked. She
watched as B’Elanna’s nipples hardened instantly when the frigid air hit them.
Suddenly she liked this idea very much. Obviously she and B’Elanna would go
inside the cramped building and create their own heat. Seven ripped her clothing
off and stood naked in front of Nara awaiting the next command.</P>
<P>"That was fast." Nara was a bit surprised by how quickly the tall woman had
disrobed and more than a little distracted by her perfect body. She might be
married, but she was not immune to Seven’s considerable assets.</P>
<P>"Inside, my little exhibitionist," B’Elanna said. She shivered and rubbed her
arms, moving from foot to foot on the cold ground.</P>
<P>"Little?" Seven asked as she bent down to crawl into the sweathouse. B’Elanna
didn’t answer, distracted by the tantalizing view of Seven’s backside as she
wiggled through the small opening.</P>
<P>It was hot, hot and impossibly dry inside the sweathouse. Seven felt like
someone had pushed her into a plasma manifold, or perhaps under it, because the
heat was oppressive, making her feel like it was forcing her to the ground. She
felt B’Elanna’s hand on her hip, and what should have been a pleasant, arousing
caress became a distant, dull reminder to keep moving. Once inside, the former
Borg drone wondered what she had gotten herself into.</P>
<P>"Kahless, it’s like gre'thor in here," B’Elanna said. It seemed odd that a
payment to Kahless would be so much like a visit to the Klingon equivalent of
hell.</P>
<P>Seven nodded, and pressed her body onto the heat-baked soil hoping to find
cooler air at the lowest point in the tiny structure. Her body was already
covered in sweat and she realized that Tach was indeed an expert builder of
sweathouses. She sucked in air trying cool her body but the air was like an oven
and seemed to only heat her from within. This was not what she had expected.</P>
<P>B’Elanna settled onto her back on the ground beside Seven and looked over at
her. Seven’s blonde hair was soaked in sweat and sticking to her face. B’Elanna
enjoyed the silky strands and was happy that Seven was letting it grow out. She
reached over and wiped it off of her closed eyes. "I like the longer hair," she
whispered.</P>
<P>Seven opened one eye, and did not look amused. "Right now, I miss my Borg
hair style."</P>
<P>"Not on your life," B’Elanna said quietly. "I love your hair and I can’t wait
‘til you can braid it down one side."</P>
<P>Nara crawled into the tiny space and handed each woman a container of water
that they eagerly drank down. "Easy," she said. "Not too fast." Nara’s thick
brow was cover in sweat, but she seemed unaffected. She took another container
of water and poured it over the rocks filling the room with steam. Seven
instantly missed the annoying, dry heat. The steam seemed to add to her misery.
Nara noticed her discomfort and poured some water onto Seven’s back. It felt
amazing. B’Elanna raised her eyebrows in silent request and Nara poured the
water over her chest then ducked out of the room and left them alone.</P>
<P>"How long must we stay in here?" Seven asked without opening her eyes.</P>
<P>"Until we a have a vision or turn into jerky."</P>
<P>Seven kept her eyes closed and tried to relax despite the weight of the heat
on her body. She took small breaths, trying to avoid too much over heated air
entering her lungs at once and fought to relax. She had tried meditating with
Tuvok on board <I>Voyager</I> but found it inefficient. Now, she had no where
else to be, so she focused on the sound of her beloved B’Elanna beside her and
the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears. She reached over and gripped
B’Elanna’s smaller, darker hand, smiling when she felt a reassuring squeeze.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt Seven take her hand and her body relaxed, but then Seven always
had that effect on her. She shifted on the ground and took slow breaths and
waited for her Klingon side to do something. She hoped it would show up soon,
but she also hoped it wouldn’t send her running outside naked in full blood lust
looking for an enemy to slay.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Ahem." Nara cleared her throat and put her hand on her husband’s back. Tach
had his forehead gently pressed against Ty’s tiny belly and was growling, not
the most dignified thing for a scared firekeeper to be caught doing.</P>
<P>"How are they?" he asked, smiling down at Ty who whimpered when his playmate
pulled away.</P>
<P>"They will be fine," Nara said and sat next Tach. She reached over and pulled
Ty’s covers around his neck against the cold.</P>
<P>"They argue as much as we do," he said with a wry grin.</P>
<P>"Yes, and B’Elanna loses every time… just like you." </P>
<P>"Not true," he said. "Seven lets B’Elanna win sometimes…unlike you."</P>
<P>Nara smiled and snuggled closer thinking about their two friends. It was true
of course, B’Elanna won some of the daily conflicts, but more often than not,
Seven would cheat. She would look at B’Elanna with her big sky blue eyes, tilt
her head to one side, flash a meek smile, and the Klingon would give up.
Although, whenever they discussed something serious, they seemed able to come to
the best resolution, no matter who was the winner of the argument. Nara thought
she might just take that into mind the next time Tach seemed to have a valid
point.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven felt like her body was shrinking and she thought she was suffocating.
She was still stretched out on the ground with her face pressed to the dried
mud, but now she was using her Borg hand to dig a tiny hole next to her face in
hopes of finding cooler air to breathe. She felt as if she were floating, and
the only sound was her heart, or was it a drum? She had a vague memory of a
Klingon myth about the drum of Kahless, how warriors with true hearts could hear
its beat, and if they were worthy, their hearts would pound in time with it. But
that was a myth, and she didn’t believe in myths.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna remained on her back, the earth was a grounding presence until she
felt it begin to sway from side to side. She opened her eyes and realized that
she was on a ship, a ship she had seen before.</P>
<P>"Not again," she said disgustedly, and then the bargemaster turned, but
instead of the keeper of the Klingon dead, she saw her mother, Miral.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, Ka’pla," the older Klingon said.</P>
<P>"Please tell me this is a heat induced hallucination."</P>
<P>"Do not concern yourself. You are not going off to Stovocor just yet." Her
mother slapped her on the back, almost knocking her over. </P>
<P>"I should have known better than to try one of these damn Klingon rituals."
B’Elanna walked to the edge of the ship and looked over at the swirling sea of
lava. "Probably fried my brain. Seven’s gonna’ kill me if I ever wake up."</P>
<P>"You chose well, daughter. She has a true heart." Miral leaned against the
rail and mirrored B’Elanna’s gaze over the fiery surface.</P>
<P>"Yes, she does." B’Elanna turned to the hallucination. "But she’s not a
Klingon. I can’t imagine that pleasing you."</P>
<P>"She does not have to please me. It is enough that she pleases you. You must
find your own way, and not worry so much about living your life for others." She
reached out and turned B’Elanna toward her.</P>
<P>"Now, I know you’re a hallucination." B’Elanna studied the older version of
herself.</P>
<P>"You walk a path of honor. Nothing else matters. You adapt our ways for
yourself, as it should be," Miral said with a wistful smile.</P>
<P>"So, am I to believe that you are dead? Or do you just happen to be on your
own Klingon vision quest right now somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant?" B’Elanna
asked.</P>
<P>"You think too much." Her mother took her chin and turned her face to the
side and kissed her on the cheek the way B’Elanna had done to Seven during their
bonding ritual. "Be happy daughter."</P>
<P>"Thank you," she said. "I am."</P>
<P>"She is worthy of you," her mother said with a smile. "And I never thought I
would say that about anyone."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled. Hallucination or not, she was enjoying this talk.</P>
<P>"You must go back," her mother told her. "Your Be’nal needs you. She listens
to the drum of Kahless, and you must call her back."</P>
<P>"Call her back? How?" B’Elanna asked. "From where?"</P>
<P>"She hears the drum, and will leave with it unless your heart calls to her."
She leaned forward and gripped B’Elanna’s arms in a warrior’s grasp. "Go,
daughter. Be happy."</P>
<P>"What drum?" she asked as the ship began to fade. She tried to remember where
she had heard of the drum, then it hit her. It was an old myth, one she had
loved as a very small child. The warriors who had true hearts would hear the
drum of Kahless and their hearts would begin to beat with in time with it. It
was said that the truest of hearts would sometimes fade as the drum slowed and
Kahless would take them with him to Stovokor.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna yelled as she sat up, but she lost her balance in the steam
filled room.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven heard a sound, it was relaxing, and it comforted her. She opened her
eyes and found that she was in a cave. There were two people standing several
feet away with their backs to her and another was far in the distance.
"<I>Apparently</I>," she thought, "<I>I have mastered meditation, and am having
a vision." </I>It was annoying that her once rational mind was being cluttered
with such human jumbles of archetypal images.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct to unimatrix zero one," the darker figure on
the left said as it turned. It was Seven, or rather the drone she had been. "We
have been polluted by humanity. Return to the collective where we belong."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her former self and frowned, and then raised an eyebrow. "You
are an imperfect vision. I do not wish to engage you."</P>
<P>The second figure turned and Seven was looking at the person she would have
been if she had not been assimilated, Annika Hansen, beautiful, and fully human.
"Hello, Annika," the apparition said to Seven and smiled warmly. She was wearing
a billowing white dress that was waving gently despite the lack of a breeze.</P>
<P>Seven glared at the newcomer, not finding it any more appealing. "Why am I
seeing versions of myself? What kind of vision is this? Am I not supposed to
speak to great masters who will enlighten me?"</P>
<P>Annika laughed, her voice carefree and playful. "Who better to explain
yourself than us?"</P>
<P>"This human is insignificant. Seven of Nine, why do you insist on reclaiming
that which makes you weak?" the drone demanded.</P>
<P>"I am her strength," Annika said. "I am the part of her that loves."</P>
<P>"Love is irrelevant," the drone responded.</P>
<P>"And that is why the Borg will never achieve the perfection they seek,"
Annika said as she crossed her arms over her chest.</P>
<P>"Humans are weak, their necks snap easily," the drone said as she moved
toward Annika. "We will demonstrate."</P>
<P>"How can you do that?" Annika asked. "You are alone here, without the
collective to guide you, you’re a puppet with its strings cut. And you don’t
look much like Pinocchio."</P>
<P>Seven looked at the two and then sighed. She turned and walked back toward
the sound of the drum in the distance. She found the arguing pair tiresome and
didn’t want to see either one. They continued arguing even as Seven left, which
seemed wasteful since it was Seven’s vision and they were bickering out of her
range of hearing.</P>
<P>"Seven, Be’nal of B’Elanna," a deep voice said. It was a commanding voice,
yet there was a sincere quality to it. Seven turned and saw a robust and
familiar Klingon standing behind her.</P>
<P>"Well," she told the third being. "At least you are what I expected to see in
a self-induced hypnotic state. Kahless, I presume?" She studied him, and decided
that he seemed rather unremarkable. "For a god, you lack the perfect physique I
would expect. You have a rather large protruding stomach, and your incisors
needed sharpening. My wife’s teeth have a much finer edge."</P>
<P>He laughed a held his large belly. "I like you," he said taking her by the
arm and leading her away from the other two apparitions who were still arguing
with each other. "You spend your time denying both sides of yourself when you
should be embracing both."</P>
<P>"Predictable quasi-religious advice. I believe I have fallen asleep and I am
dreaming," she said.</P>
<P>"Ha," Kahless said, waving his hand dismisively. "You must do as you choose;
heed my advice or not. It matters not to me."</P>
<P>Seven walked around the cave examining the walls. "When do I wake up?"</P>
<P>"I am a warrior, not a nursemaid sent to wake you. I must go," he said and
started to fade, as he did, the drum began to slow. Seven was being tugged away
with him, then something pulled her back, away from the drum and the peace it
offered.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna yelled again. She leaned over and felt her wife’s neck, her
pulse was weak and so slow that the Klingon almost couldn’t find it. Seven
didn’t move and her hand was limp when B’Elanna squeeze it.</P>
<P>Nara crawled into the sweathouse. "What’s wrong?"</P>
<P>"It’s Seven," B’Elanna pulled Seven to her, carefully shaking her.</P>
<P>"She passed out. It happens. Let’s get her outside." </P>
<P>"No, her pulse is weak," B’Elanna said, trying not to panic. They carried
Seven outside and placed her on a fur that was spread out nearby. Tach looked
away, thinking that they were just coming out to cool off.</P>
<P>Nara knelt beside Seven and grabbed handfuls of snow and began rubbing them
onto her overheated skin. "Seven," she whispered. "Wake up. You’re scaring your
wife." She noticed that Seven had stopped sweating, despite the fact that she
had made sure both women drank plenty of water. "Tach," she said. "Go to the
cabin and bring back the medical kit."</P>
<P>Tach stood and turned, quickly averting his eyes from the two naked women.
"I’ll leave Ty over here," he said. Ty was snugly wrapped in a hard backed
carrier, which Tach set close enough to the fire to stay warm, but far enough
away to be safe and then ran for the cabin.</P>
<P>"Seven, come on, wake up," B’Elanna said as she held her lover’s face in her
hands. She felt her pulse, and realized it had slowed even more. She thought of
her mother’s words, and the drum of Kahless. She was watching her wife leave
her.</P>
<P>"I don’t know what else to do," Nara said. "She should be waking up." She
rubbed Seven’s arms and legs with snow, but nothing seemed to reach her.</P>
<P>"Help me," B’Elanna said quickly. She stretched out on her back next to
Seven. "Put her on top of me," she ordered.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Put her head here on my chest." Nara helped as B’Elanna guided Seven to her.
She held Seven’s face to her breast and breathed slowly. </P>
<P>"She should be on her back. It’s harder to breath the way you have her," Nara
protested.</P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna said. She used one hand to hold Seven’s cheek to her, and
pressed her other hand over Seven’s shoulder. She prayed she was doing the right
thing.</P>
