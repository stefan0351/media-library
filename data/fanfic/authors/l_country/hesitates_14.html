<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Fourteen: Waiting -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway calmly explained the temporal differential of Jusari Prime to
her senior staff while her stomach was turning inside out.</P>
<P>"Two and a half years?" Chakotay asked. He was always the one to ask the
question immediately after the answer had been explained.</P>
<P>"Well, I can certainly empathize with their plight," the Doctor said smugly.
"After all, I was stranded outside of the universal time differential for
<I>three</I> years on MY planet."</P>
<P>Tom Paris wasn’t one to be outdone by a hologram. "Well, Tuvok and I were on
that planet of ours for months, and we didn’t have a nice cozy apartment like
you did," the strawberry blonde said.</P>
<P>"If you remember correctly, Mister Paris, I was on that away mission as
well." The Doctor wiped an imaginary dust particle from his holographic
tunic.</P>
<P>"You didn’t have to eat spiders," Tom responded.</P>
<P>"Enough," Janeway said, halting the escalating contest. "This isn’t a game of
‘one-ups-manship.’ B’Elanna and Seven are alone on a dangerous planet." </P>
<P>"Harry," Tom whispered loud enough for everyone at the table to hear. "After
two and half years alone with Seven, B’Elanna’s gonna’ be so happy to be back on
board I’ll be right back in with her. All that time… I’m sure she’ll have
forgiven me. Hell, Seven will have driven her nuts; she’ll be begging me to take
her back."</P>
<P>"Shut up, Ensign," the captain said. "You don’t know what the hell you’re
talking about."</P>
<P>All eyes fixed on the auburn haired captain. They weren’t accustomed to her
using such harsh words with her crew. </P>
<P>"They’re going to need all the support we can give them when they get back.
This planet is… it would make a Cardassian labor camp look like Risa." Janeway
rubbed her temples and her staff knew that if the always in control captain was
letting her tension show to this extent, the news must be grim indeed. She
proceeded to explain just how grim it was.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several hours later the Dengari escort took Janeway, Tuvok and the Doctor to
the viewing area to witness the arrival of a group of prisoners. Any hopes
Janeway had harbored were quickly dashed. They watched from behind a one way
mirror as the small groups came into the medical facilities. Most had empty eyes
that testified to the unspeakable acts they had been through. They only saw two
women arrive. </P>
<P>One was a tall Dengari, almost seven feet tall, and she looked as hard as the
planet she had just arrived from. Her features were stark and her cheeks gaunt,
but her eyes were not as dead as so many who had arrived before her. It soon
became apparent why. One of the doctors bumped into her and she grabbed him by
the arm, snapping the humerus in her grip. She was obviously one of the
predators. </P>
<P>The second woman they saw arrive was about Tuvok’s height, with light brown
hair and features almost human except that her eyes were set almost twice as far
apart. Those eyes were haunted, and her features that may have once been pretty
were darkened with bruises of various ages, suggesting many beatings. She moved
around the room like a domestic animal, going wherever the doctors pulled her,
never saying a word. They moved her to an exam area and scanned her, pausing
over her belly, then the doctors spoke off to the side and approached her again.
She nodded and they led her off to another room.</P>
<P>"What was that about?" Janeway asked the guard who had been left in the
observation room to watch them.</P>
<P>"An unwanted conception. They will terminate it." He was gruff, and the
captain had not seen him before. </P>
<P>Janeway turned back to the window and watched silently as they disappeared
through a door and out of sight. She wondered where Malok was, hoping that the
Overseer hadn’t discovered that he was the one who had told her about the
conditions on Jusari Prime.</P>
<P>Tuvok and the Doctor were quiet, but for vastly different reasons. Tuvok’s
Vulcan sensibilities were indeed put off by the vile display, but the only show
of emotion he allowed was an unconscious darkening of his features. The Doctor
was horrified by the scene in front of him and was busy trying to come up with a
treatment for Torres and Seven when they returned. His one attempt at adding a
psychiatric subroutine had been disastrous, but he knew the <I>Voyager</I>
crewmembers would need far more help than he was capable of.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After they had watched the arrival, the trio returned to <I>Voyager</I> and
the captain went immediately to her ready room. She hadn’t eaten anything all
day and despite her stomach’s growling she knew she couldn’t eat. Even coffee
didn’t interest her. She had one cup in an attempt to find some sense of
normalcy, and her body rejected it. The calm, cool, collected captain found
herself rushing for her restroom as her stomach discarded the coffee. She hadn’t
been sick to her stomach over stress since she was a cadet, and even then it had
only happened once before her first command of a war game that her father was
coming to watch. As she rinsed her mouth with the cool water from the sink she
realized that it wasn’t just the stress of not being able to do anything, it was
also the constant worry about what her two lost crewmembers were going through.
</P>
<P>B’Elanna had been through so much in her young life, but the Klingon hybrid
had made it through and was flourishing as <I>Voyager’s</I> Chief Engineer. She
had gone through a rough spot after hearing about the massacre of the Maquis
back in the Alpha quadrant, but she had managed to work through it. B’Elanna was
no stranger to horrific conditions, having witnessed Cardassian brutality first
hand. Janeway hoped that B’Elanna would draw on those experiences to make it
through her current ordeal. She also hoped that B’Elanna could help Seven
survive it as well. She knew the Klingon would physically protect Seven, but she
wondered how or if she would help Seven deal with the emotional side of what
they were going through. Neither woman was very good at expressing their
emotions and their constant animosity toward each other was legendary.</P>
<P>Seven was a great cause for concern for many reasons. Not only was Kathryn in
love with her, but Seven had issues B’Elanna did not. Where as B’Elanna had a
lifetime of humanity to draw from, Seven in reality had only the three years she
had spent on <I>Voyager</I>. Spending almost as long on the prison planet could
warp her beyond repair. Kathryn stood and went to the window and looked out at
the space station, it was clean, and well designed, and gave no outward sign of
the horrific secrets it held. She sighed and went to her couch and sank into the
cushions remembering a night she had visited with members of her crew on
"Ancestor’s day." Seven had sat next to her, their bodies leaning slightly
toward each other. Kathryn had noticed, but pushed it aside as the bond between
mentor and student. Now she knew better. </P>
<P>She thought about the gentle soul Seven hid within, about the way Seven
interacted with Naomi Wildman, and the way Seven continued to stand up for the
Doctor, despite his many hurtful actions. Janeway had been hurt and angry when
the Doctor had wanted to stay and live with his adoring "fans" on a planet
recently, as she had when he had tortured Seven on Ransom’s order during the
<I>Equinox</I> fiasco. But Seven, she took it all in stride, accepting that in
the case of the <I>Equinox</I>, he had no choice once his ethical subroutine was
deleted. She even offered to help him add safeguards against further tampering,
and as for the Doctor’s willingness to abandon <I>Voyager</I>, Seven took that
in stride too. She had been hurt, but when the Doctor’s fans found a new flavor
of the week, it was Seven who went to the Doctor to make him feel better.
Kathryn prayed that by some miracle that gentle soul would find a way to endure
on Jusari Prime. She prayed that when she returned she would be able to reclaim
the humanity that was new to her, and most of all, she prayed that Seven could
forgive a foolish captain for not admitting her love. Kathryn became more aware
with each passing second how much her heart belonged to the former Borg. So much
so that the captain had accessed the hologrid and deleted the Michael Sullivan
character, which took some doing considering she had locked herself out of the
hologram’s character subroutine weeks earlier to avoid making anymore changes.
Luckily, Kathryn was quite experienced at bypassing computer lockouts. She
sighed and stretched out on the small blue couch, and wished that people were as
easy to alter as holograms. If they were, she could simply erase any bad
memories Seven brought back with her from Jusari Prime. It never for once
entered Kathryn’s mind that the memories Seven was forming on the planet were
the happiest of her life, or that those pleasant memories would form an
impossible barrier to the exdrone’s heart that negative ones never could
have.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Nara and Tach sat near the fire with Ty between them, not wanting him out of
their reach when the beam out began. The entire day before they had let B’Elanna
and Seven keep the boy with them. They knew the two women would miss their son
and they wanted to give Ty a chance for a few more memories with his aunts. What
would have been a day of celebration anywhere else on the prison planet was a
somber one for the cabin’s occupants. They felt like their family was being
split in half.</P>
<P>"Now, B’Elanna," Tach said seriously. "You take care of Seven, and keep her
out of trouble."</P>
<P>"I will," B’Elanna responded. Her eyes kept being drawn back to the dark
haired boy in Nara’s arms. Ty was sleeping after his breakfast and didn’t
understand why he didn’t have to go to his bed for his nap, but he seemed more
than willing to doze off in his mother’s arms.</P>
<P>"I will make sure that B’Elanna does not continue to follow in Tach’s clumsy
footsteps," Seven said with a halfhearted smile. In the time the Narians had
been on the planet, Tach had broken his leg twice and his arm once. B’Elanna had
tumbled down a hillside recently and dislocated her shoulder. All of the
injuries were easily treated, but painful nonetheless.</P>
<P>"Oh, hush," B’Elanna whispered as she leaned back against Seven.</P>
<P>"We’ve come to love you both." Nara had tears in her eyes. "When you leave
here, if you can’t find that Starship of yours, you come live with us on Nador
Omega. We can always use help on a farm, and I know Seven is a great
seamstress."</P>
<P>"There’s always room for family," Tach added.</P>
<P>"<I>Voyager</I> has a long head start, although I don’t know how long they
may have stayed to search for us." B’Elanna turned and smiled at Seven. "Our
shuttle is pretty fast, and maybe Seven can rig us a slipstream. I’m not giving
up on getting home just yet…but, if we can’t find them… we will keep your offer
in mind."</P>
<P>"<I>Voyager</I> is the first family I knew after leaving the collective. I
seem to have a knack for finding members of my family I never knew I had." Seven
looked over at Ty and then squeezed B’Elanna to her chest. "B’Elanna’s home is
in the Alpha Quadrant, and we must try to return, but if that is not to be, I
would be happy to come to Nador Omega."</P>
<P>"You’re wrong," B’Elanna whispered and turned to look into Seven’s eyes. "The
Alpha Quadrant isn’t my home. It’s just a place. My home is right here,"
B’Elanna said as she placed her hand over Seven’s heart.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed, trying to move the lump in her throat.</P>
<P>"You two act like you’re still newly joined," Tach said as he rolled his
eyes. Nara hit him with a well-placed elbow to the ribs and he winced. "See what
I have to put up with?" he said.</P>
<P>"It is almost time," Seven said quietly. They all grew serious, knowing that
Seven’s ability to track time was almost flawless. If the Dengari were true to
their word, the beam out would be very soon. </P>
<P>The talked for several more minutes and Tach held a small box of tools to his
chest, hoping that they would be beamed out with them. They had belong to his
father, and he cherished them, but if they were left behind, at least B’Elanna
and Seven could use them for the last months of their own sentence. Without
warning Tach and Nara and Ty began to sparkle and then disappeared, taking the
toolbox with them. Seven squeezed B’Elanna tighter and began to cry. She was not
alone; B’Elanna’s own cheeks were wet with hot, salty tears.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The night shift came and went on board <I>Voyager</I>, and Janeway was awake
the entire time. She was a woman of action, and not used to waiting helplessly
while people she was sworn to protect suffered. Especially when one of them was
the woman she loved. Hours passed for her, but she knew days were whipping by on
Jusari Prime. So she waited, enduring each minute, knowing that certainly Seven
and B’Elanna were going through hideous atrocities at the hands of god knew
who.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Wake up, Lana," Seven whispered to her lover who was slumbering deeply. </P>
<P>B’Elanna was in a comfortable, warm place, but the graceful hand that was
teasing her nipples awake was too much to resist. She smiled and arched into the
caress.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven repeated and began kissing her wife’s throat, nipping the
delicious caramel skin.</P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna moaned and then wrapped her arms around Seven’s shoulders.
"Yes?" she asked, drawing the word out.</P>
<P>"Wake up…I am ready for breakfast." Seven ran her hand over B’Elanna’s belly.
Neither woman wore anything to sleep in, enjoying the feel of flesh on
flesh.</P>
<P>B’Elanna pried one eye open and studied her lover incredulously. "Breakfast?"
She groaned and kissed Seven’s temple. "I am so whipped," she whispered. "All
right, Be’nal. You want breakfast… I’ll get you breakfast. Are there any of
those duck eggs left over from yesterday?" </P>
<P>"I do not want eggs," Seven whispered and moved her lips down to B’Elanna’s
nipple.</P>
<P>"Oh, god," B’Elanna said as her body screamed out for more. "You keep that up
and I’m not gonna’ be willing to get out of this bed."</P>
<P>"That is exactly what I had in mind for breakfast." Seven pressed her leg
onto B’Elanna’s center causing the Klingon to growl deeply, the sound making
Seven moan and bite her lover’s chest in response. Seven loved the deep, feral
sounds her wife made when she touched her.</P>
<P>"And here I thought I was gonna’ have to make Borg barley." B’Elanna ran her
hands though Seven’s hair, which had grown out and now reached more than halfway
down to her waist.</P>
<P>"Lay back… I will get my breakfast ready. You need only be awake to enjoy
it." Seven continued rubbing her leg from B’Elanna’s hips down her legs and then
back. Each pass made the Klingon more vocal. </P>
<P>B’Elanna sucked in a breath, fighting the urge to flip Seven onto her back
and get her own breakfast from between the former drone’s long legs. There were
some advantages to having the cabin to themselves again, the most wonderful
being the fact that their lovemaking was as spontaneous as it had once been.
There didn’t seem to be anywhere in the Homestead that Seven didn’t find
arousing, be it the kitchen table, in front of one of the two fireplaces, in the
pantry, or the more traditional bedroom.</P>
<P>"Umm," Seven whispered into B’Elanna’s chest as her hand slid down and tested
the waiting wetness between B’Elanna’s legs. "I believe my breakfast is
ready."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah, it’s ready," B’Elanna responded. She had handfuls of Seven’s
blonde hair, loving the way it felt between her fingers. She let the satin
strands slip away as her lover moved ever southward on her overheating body.</P>
<P>"Good," Seven answered. She kissed the well toned abdomen and raked her teeth
over the muscles while her leg expertly parted B’Elanna’s. Her hands were
lingering higher, one over each of B’Elanna’s breasts, gently tugging at the
nipples in unison. She would shift her grip and rub the palms of her hands over
the rigid peaks and then grip the entire fleshy weight of Lana’a breast in an
unhurried massage that drove the Klingon to brink of oblivion. Many times
Seven’s attentive touch on her breasts would bring B’Elanna to release, but
Seven had other plans on this morning. </P>
<P>"Oh, yes," B’Elanna whispered as she felt Seven moving further down.</P>
<P>Seven inhaled deeply once she reached her goal, her eyes closing when the
musky fragrance filled her senses. She placed her mouth over B’Elanna and
exhaled, her hot breath heating the area even more. B’Elanna screamed
incoherently and relaxed her body, awaiting whatever Seven had in mind for
her.</P>
<P>"Mine," Seven said with a wicked grin. She raked her tongue up the length of
her wife’s opening gathering the thick juices as she went.</P>
<P>"Sweet Kahless, yes. I’m yours…yours, Seven."</P>
<P>"I know," the exBorg answered and went back for another leisurely swipe. She
moved her hands down and wrapped them around her lover’s strong thighs and
parted them further, then drove her mouth into B’Elanna’s pulsing center. The
contact was firm, but unhurried, lingering with thorough enjoyment. When Seven
needed more contact, she lifted one of B’Elanna’s legs over her shoulder and
drove her tongue inside the Klingon.</P>
<P>"Yours, only yours," B’Elanna promised, her hands finding Seven’s head and
stroking her temples to encourage her.</P>
<P>"Mine," Seven growled into her lover. She needed more, so she brought
B’Elanna’s other leg up over her shoulder, but didn’t stop there. She pushed the
coffee colored leg higher, opening Lana to her, then twisted so that she could
get a better angle and enjoy every bit of the divine essence. B’Elanna, always
willing to offer assistance, grabbed her own leg and opened herself even wider
and Seven rewarded her by releasing the leg and letting her hand join her
mouth.</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah," B’Elanna managed to whisper as she began to hyperventilate. She
felt Seven’s fingers tease her opening, dipping only slightly inside, and then
backing out to circle her. A thin sheen of sweat covered both of their bodies,
testimony to their mutual enjoyment of the activity, and B’Elanna arched into
her lover.</P>
<P>Seven sucked on B’Elanna’s engorged lips, and then moved back up to give the
painfully hard nub a slow, gentle suck. She let her fingers edge inside of
B’Elanna, moaning as she felt the slickened muscles quiver as she drove deeper.
She shifted her face from side to side, letting her whole face stimulate her
lover. Seven’s fingers drove even deeper, then paused as the muscles around them
pulsed and then clinched to keep them in place. Once B’Elanna’s inner walls
gripped her in place, she knew her lover was close. She tugged her fingers back,
not enough to pull out, but enough to cause B’Elanna’s grip to tighten to hold
her. This was Seven favorite moment. She knew she had her beloved wife in the
palm of her hand, in more ways than one. She could shift her fingers, just
enough to imply movement and cause her lover to spasm, and that was exactly what
she did, over and over again until B’Elanna was howling for release.</P>
<P>"Please, my Be’nal, let me go," the proud warrior begged. "Let me fall."</P>
<P>"Never," Seven responded. "I will never let you fall. I will always catch
you." She went back to the salty sweetness and drove the Klingon higher. "But I
will let you come," she said. With that she pinned B’Elanna’s center in place
with a gentle bite, not hard enough to cause pain, but enough to trap the
hardened clit as it peeked out of its hood. Seven’s tongue danced across the
tiny muscle and she began to thrust inside B’Elanna, the length of her fingers
drawing in and out of the fevered passage. </P>
<P>B’Elanna was lost, awash in the sensations, and then, her body froze, and she
drew in a long ragged breath and held it while her very being shook with
release. After the little death she released the breath in a long howling cry of
Seven’s name.</P>
<P>Seven crawled up the sweat-covered body of her lover and collapsed onto her
chest. She had climaxed several times while pleasuring her wife. She buried her
face between B’Elanna’s breasts while she tried to bring her heartbeat back to
normal, then just relaxed and let her weight press down on the exhausted
Klingon. </P>
<P>They clung to each other like shipwreck survivors to a log in a storm. Each
woman’s arms heavy from her sated exhaustion, but unwilling to relinquish their
grip for fear the moment might be lost. Seven finally began to stir, her body
recovering first, and she placed tiny kissed on the skin beneath her.</P>
<P>"I love you, Lana," she whispered and then climbed up and fell half onto the
pillow, with half of her weight still on her wife.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna whispered, turning her head to kiss whatever part of Seven
that she could, which happened to be her narrow nose. </P>
<P>"Forever." Seven edged a bit closer so that their sweat covered foreheads
pressed together. She would have crawled inside of B’Elanna’s skin if possible,
so deep was her need to connect on every level. They stayed there for several
minutes, silly grins covering their faces like lovestruck teenagers, and then
B’Elanna’s eyes darkened and she eased back.</P>
<P>"I want to have a baby," B’Elanna whispered. "I know we don’t have any way to
do that while we’re trapped here, but as soon as we leave here in three months,
I want to find a doctor to help us get pregnant… I mean, if you want to…" </P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. "I want to. But, we don’t have to wait unless you want
to," she added.</P>
<P>"Darling, I know you’re a regular Swiss Army knife, but unless you’ve got an
implant I haven’t seen…I don’t see how we can." B’Elanna smiled, relieved that
Seven was as eager to have a baby as she was.</P>
<P>"While the Borg found single cell fertilization slow and much more time
consuming than assimilation, there were times when it was necessary," Seven
explained.</P>
<P>"Borg sex?" B’Elanna asked, then jealousy flashed across her features. "You
never…you didn’t, did you?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She leaned over and gave B’Elanna a chaste kiss. "However I
am…equipped to perform the procedure."</P>
<P>B’Elanna pulled back and then took a lingering look between her wife’s legs.
</P>
<P>"I don’t think so, love," B’Elanna said and broke into a fit of very
non-Klingon giggles.</P>
<P>"Very funny. Your ability to amuse yourself never ceases to amaze me." Seven
raised her eyebrow and the Borg eyepiece along with it.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry, Seven, but…okay…" She pulled Seven back to her. "I really am
sorry. How can you… we… you know?"</P>
<P>Seven paused, uncertain if she should continue. She had made the offer
without considering that B’Elanna might not be willing to endure all that the
procedure entailed. </P>
<P>"Hey?" B’Elanna lifted Seven’s chin so that she could look into her eyes.
"Can you really do this? Can we?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but it would be… it would involve my assimilation tubules."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened, but then she realized that Seven would never do
anything to hurt her. "Tell me how."</P>
<P>"It is simple," Seven said. "When Borg ships became stranded, or passed
through an area devoid of any new species to…assimilate, the Collective used
other methods to increase the number of available drones. Drones considered to
have the most desirable traits were used to procreate."</P>
<P>"Oh?" B’Elanna said, the jealousy edging back to the surface.</P>
<P>"I was never in the position to need this technique," Seven said. "But I am
capable of utilizing it. I can explain it to you in detail." </P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. "Don’t explain it to me. Show me."</P>
