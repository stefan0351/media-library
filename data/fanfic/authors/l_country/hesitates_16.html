<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Sixteen: Changes -->

<P>Seven leaned into the toilet and promptly lost the contents of her stomach.
B’Elanna knelt beside her and held Seven’s thick blonde braid out of the way and
then wiped Seven’s face with a wet towel as soon as she stopped retching.</P>
<P>"Easy," B’Elanna said as soon as Seven leaned back against the wall.</P>
<P>"<I>Your</I> child is obviously doing some Klingon dance on my stomach,"
Seven accused. She rolled her head back against the wall and let out a
whimpering sigh.</P>
<P>"How come when you feel great she’s <I>our</I> child, and when you’re tossing
your cookies, she’s <I>my</I> child?" B’Elanna pressed the cool cloth to Seven’s
forehead.</P>
<P>"Do <I>not</I> mention cookies," Seven demanded, then leaned forward as if
deciding whether or not to throw up again. The urge passed and she rested
against the wall again.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," B’Elanna said. She was biting the inside of her cheek to keep
from laughing, which experience had proven, was not a good idea. The only thing
worse than a sick Borg was a pissed off and sick Borg.</P>
<P>"My memories from the Collective did not include this…this…morning sickness,"
Seven whined.</P>
<P>"Well, from what my mother told me," B’Elanna explained gently. "It only
lasts for the first trimester…usually."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes popped open. "The first trimester! Three months of this?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and looked for a way to escape the tiny room before her wife
became really angry.</P>
<P>"You knew this? And you did not tell me?" Seven stood up, now more pissed off
than sick, that and the fact that her breakfast had already been ejected.</P>
<P>"It’s different for each person," B’Elanna offered. She watched as Seven’s
eyes teared up, her hormones raging. "I’m sorry, love," B’Elanna said and opened
her arms. </P>
<P>Six feet of blonde Borg filled her arms, knocking her back several steps and
then she began crying. It was going to be a long three months.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>By lunch time, Seven was convinced she was dying of starvation… dying of
starvation and it was all B’Elanna’s fault. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>By dinner, the sun, the moon, and the stars all rose and set for B’Elanna,
and Seven was committed to proving it to the Klingon. This was one aspect of
Borg mood swings that B’Elanna enjoyed because in addition to Seven’s
declarations of undying love, the tall blonde was incredibly amorous.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Luckily for B’Elanna the roller coaster ride smoothed out after two months,
too very long months.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>They prepared for the upcoming beam out, excited at the prospect of getting
back to the <I>Delta Flyer</I> and heading out in search of <I>Voyager</I>. At
the beginning of their last month they stopped hunting at all. They wanted to
use up all of the meat they had in storage, the animals of the valley had
provided well for them, and they didn’t want to leave any meat unused. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The storeroom was empty by the last week, so B’Elanna went out each morning
to bring down a rabbit or sometimes a duck from the lake. Seven had initially
wanted to accompany her, but the sight of the fresh kill always made her sick.
The morning sickness had disappeared early in the second month, but the sight of
blood was just too much for her. It was easier for both women if B’Elanna went
alone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked as she came into the cabin from her morning hunt.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven asked from the kitchen. She came out, her hands covered with
some sticky substance.</P>
<P>"You up for a walk?" B’Elanna asked. She knew that Seven missed their walks
in the valley when they had hunted together. "What’s that?" B’Elanna asked,
pointing at the dripping mess on Seven’s hands.</P>
<P>"Honey," Seven answered. "I was making tea, and it was not sweet enough, and
well…" her voice trailed off.</P>
<P>"You hate ‘bee spit,’" B’Elanna said as she moved closer. She could see the
honey at the edges of Seven’s full lips.</P>
<P>"I know, but I believe this is one of those cravings you warned me about."
Seven met B’Elanna half way, then paused at looked down at her sticky hands. Her
blue eyes then locked on B’Elanna and lit up with mischief.</P>
<P>"Don’t even think it," B’Elanna ordered when she saw what Seven was
planning.</P>
<P>"You are not the Queen of me," Seven said with a wicked grin and moved
closer. "You cannot control my thoughts."</P>
<P>"Please, Seven… not on my jacket…" the Klingon cherished the chocolate brown
jacket Seven had given her. "Be’nal?"</P>
<P>"Oh, all right," Seven said and held her arms away from her body. "But I
require a kiss as payment."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and moved forward, then paused to make sure it wasn’t trap.
Convinced, she leaned into her taller wife’s chest and kissed her. "Mmm,"
B’Elanna moaned. "You taste sweet." She licked the remaining honey from the
edges of Seven’s mouth. "Maybe we should bring some of that to bed with us
tonight."</P>
<P>"An intriguing, though somewhat messy thought. Would you settle for the rug
in front of the fireplace?" Seven nodded to the location in question.</P>
<P>"Yes. Yes, I would." B’Elanna kissed her again, sliding her hand along
Seven’s arm and grasping her wrist and bringing her honey covered hand to their
mouths. They licked the honey off together, then cleaned off the other hand in
the same fashion.</P>
<P>"I believe I underestimated my enjoyment of honey," Seven said when they were
finished.</P>
<P>"Told you," B’Elanna said. "Are you up for a walk?"</P>
<P>"I would like that," Seven said with a coy smile. "I will get my cloak."</P>
<P>They walked out along the lake and across that valley to the huge meadow.
B’Elanna led the way and finally stopped under a tall tree and sat, then pulled
Seven down between her legs.</P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna whispered.</P>
<P>Seven settled in front of B’Elanna and leaned back using her as a Klingon
pillow. She felt B’Elanna’s smaller hands wrap around her and rest on her belly.
It was a familiar position. Every night in bed B’Elanna’s hand would migrate to
Seven’s belly and stay there the entire night, and Seven loved the feel of it.
After several minutes under the tree, B’Elanna leaned forward and placed a
lingering kiss on Seven’s ear.</P>
<P>"Over there," B’Elanna whispered and nodded off toward the meadow.</P>
<P>Seven looked over and saw reddish blonde movement through the trees. The
calf, Naomi Wildcow, had grown into a beautiful heifer. She meandered out of the
trees, then turned back and made a deep braying sound. A tiny calf came prancing
out of the tree cover and trotted over to Naomi.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened and she pulled B’Elanna’s arms tighter around her. They
sat in silence and watched the cow and new calf enjoying the sun, Naomi chewing
contentedly on the grass, the calf romping around his mother. Occasionally the
calf would make his way back to the cow and nudge her bulging udder and then
drink aggressively before running off again. After a while, they moved on, but
B’Elanna and Seven remained where they were for some time.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven finally said. She turned and kissed B’Elanna, pressing her
into the bark of the tree. </P>
<P>"You’re welcome." B’Elanna helped Seven stand by pushing her shapely behind
from below, using the opportunity to enjoy the firm buttocks.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven asked as they walked back to the cabin.</P>
<P>"Yes?" B’Elanna held Seven’s hand on one side, and carried a crossbow in the
other. She didn’t want to surprise any bears without some serious firepower.</P>
<P>"Did you see the way the calf…ate?"</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna drew the word out, not quite sure why Seven was asking.</P>
<P>"Will your breasts get that…full?"</P>
<P>"Kahless, I hope not." B’Elanna laughed and tugged Seven closer.</P>
<P>"Will our daughter be as… eager when she eats?"</P>
<P>"I… I don’t know," B’Elanna said. Her dark face suddenly went pale as she
imagined a baby attacking her chest the way the calf had rammed the mother and
lifted her hind quarters off of the ground… and cows were herbivores with flat
teeth, Klingon’s were known for there sharp incisors.</P>
<P>"I am glad you will be handling that particular chore," Seven said
sweetly.</P>
<P>"Oh…god." B’Elanna stopped and Seven had to tug her along. Seven didn’t
volunteer that she had never once seen Nara’s breasts that swollen and that Ty
had always seemed quite gentle when eating. She would let her wife think about
it for awhile…perhaps until she remembered it for herself. After all, if
B’Elanna could neglect to mention morning sickness, Seven could neglect to
mention Nara telling her that breast feeding wasn’t uncomfortable.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The beam-out came thirteen minutes after Seven had anticipated. She and
B’Elanna had been sitting together in front of the fireplace, exactly where
Tach, Nara, and Ty had beamed out from. Whereas Tach had been clutching his
toolbox, B’Elanna was wearing the jacket Seven had given her with her cherished
knife tucked into an inside pocket. Seven had wrapped herself in the Bearskin,
determined to take the precious fur with them.</P>
<P>They materialized on a large transporter platform and turned to see three
fully armed guards pointing formidable looking compression rifles at them, but
they recognized one of the men.</P>
<P>Malok stepped forward. "Your sentence has been completed, but you must remain
in custody until we reach the space station." He motioned toward B’Elanna with a
scanning device. "Place your weapon into the waste unit on the wall and the
animal skin as well."</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said firmly, but she made no movements toward them, actually
holding her hands over her head. "Please, you can take our things until we get
back, but please don’t make us destroy them."</P>
<P>The other two guards started to move forward, but Malok stopped them with a
shake of his head, then he lowered his weapon. "I will handle these two," Malok
said. "Remain here and continue subject retrieval while I take them to the
holding cell." He walked to B’Elanna and held out his hand. His eyes were
trusting, and he didn’t bother to point the weapon at her again. She nodded and
slowly reached in and took the large, very deadly knife from her jacket and
handed it to him in its leather sheath.</P>
<P>"Thank you," B’Elanna said quietly "It’s a gift from my wife." She turned to
Seven and the exdrone took the fur off of her shoulders and moved toward
him.</P>
<P>"Shh," he said. "Keep the nature of your relationship a secret until you are
out of custody. There are those here who would not approve," he explained out of
the other guards’ range of hearing.</P>
<P>"Because we are both female?" Seven handed him the fur, and stood close to
him. </P>
<P>"No," he said with a confused look. "Because most who come back are not
nearly as…happy as you two, the other prisoners especially, and even some of the
guards would be…jealous. Our lives are not happy ones," he whispered and ushered
them to the door.</P>
<P>"Hey," one of the guards yelled as they were almost out of the door. He was
short for a Dengari, just barely six feet tall, his face was hard, and his eyes
mean. "Malok, don’t take too long to…’<I>settle’</I> them. Although I know I
would with that golden haired one."</P>
<P>Malok stopped, his eyes flashing, he spun and faced the man. "Dehar, you
would do well to remember your position. You keep the law, but you are not
immune to it. You would also do well to remember that <I>former</I> guards do
not generally survive their sentences on Jusari Prime."</P>
<P>"Understood, sir," Dehar said quietly while the remaining guard turned away
to hide his smile.</P>
<P>Their cell was not as large as the one they had been locked in when they had
been held before sentencing. The bunks were barely big enough for one, and the
room was much smaller, but it didn’t matter, they were almost free. Malok had
put them into the cell and warned them to avoid speaking to the other prisoners,
explaining that they had retrieved several men who had just finished extremely
long sentences for unpleasant crimes. They didn’t argue. Their cell was one of
many in a long room, and the walls were solid, except for the front where the
forcefield was. They could see completely into the cell directly across from
them, as well as partly into several cells in each direction. It was not a
pleasant view. </P>
<P>Seven sat on one bunk, with B’Elanna’s jacket under her; the Klingon had
insisted that the hard bunk was too uncomfortable for her without it. B’Elanna
leaned against the wall near the forcefield.</P>
<P>"Do you think I am getting fat?" whispered Seven. She was leaning back and
studying her belly. Even three months pregnant, the lanky blonde was stunning.
Her stomach had only barely begun to show any signs of weight gain, and most
would not have noticed anything.</P>
<P>"You are not fat," B’Elanna said as she came over and sat next to her. "My
god, Seven, you’re thinner than I am."</P>
<P>Seven nodded, but continued frowning at her leather pants. </P>
<P>B’Elanna followed her gaze, mesmerized by her wife’s beauty. The pants were
dark brown, almost black, and were looser fitting than her biosuits on
<I>Voyager</I> had been, but seemed much more alluring. The leather was snug,
but not tight enough to reveal each curve, merely hinting at the treasures
beneath the fabric. Her top was cream colored leather and was designed like a
man’s dress shirt. B’Elanna loved the way it curved over Seven’s full breasts
and then tapered at the waist.</P>
<P>"You are staring," Seven said without looking up from her belly.</P>
<P>"Can’t help it." B’Elanna had a very non-Klingon grin plastered on her face.
She continued gaping at Seven, and her eyes wandered up to the long braid that
hung down her left side almost to her navel, the hair like honey spun into silk.
"I love you," she whispered.</P>
<P>"As do I you," Seven said. A smirk covered her features as she brought her
eyes up to meet B’Elanna’s eyes. The Klingon’s eyes were dark and bright, and
spoke of the promise their future held. Movement behind them broke the moment.
They turned to see Dehar bringing two men into the holding cell across from
them.</P>
<P>"Well, now," one of the prisoners said, stopping and staring at Seven. "What
do we have here? How did that golden one escape me for all these years?"</P>
<P>"Move along," Dehar said, his own eyes lingering on Seven. B’Elanna stood and
blocked their view of her wife, her hands defiantly on her hips.</P>
<P>The prisoner held his arm out to Dehar revealing a thick bracelet made of
white gold, or perhaps platinum. "This would look very nice on you," he said to
Dehar. "This cell looks a little…dingy. My friend and I wouldn’t mind sharing a
cell with others," he let his gaze move toward Seven.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was at the forcefield in a single leap. "He does that and you’ll
part with more than that bracelet." B’Elanna smiled like a shark looking into a
tank of guppies, her sharp Klingon incisors gleaming in the light.</P>
<P>Dehar said nothing and shoved the man into his cell, but as he walked away,
there was something in his movements that made B’Elanna’s skin crawl.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The wait was longer than Seven had expected, with prisoners being shuffled in
every few minutes. She finally gave up and stretched out on the bunk and tried
to sleep. She hadn’t been able to regenerate the morning before they had left,
and the pregnancy made her tire easily. B’Elanna perched on the edge of the bed
next to Seven’s head, shielding her long blonde hair from view as best she
could. After a few more hours, B’Elanna balanced on the bed beside Seven. The
Klingon slept, her muscles couldn’t relax because she was hanging off of the
side of the bunk, but moving to the other bunk never entered her mind. As
B’Elanna slept, her hand made its way behind her to find Seven’s belly, and once
her hand molded to the soft, warm curve, she drifted off. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna wasn’t sure what it was that woke her, but she was off of the bunk
and leaping toward something before her eyes were fully open. She collided with
a dense body and felt a sharp pain in her ribs.</P>
<P>Seven was up a moment after B’Elanna. She had reacted instinctively,
uncurling from the bunk to her full height. She saw movement out of the corner
of her eye, but was distracted by the scene in front of her. She watched in
horror as her wife struggled with the prisoner who had spoken to them earlier.
Her Borg hand shot up but it was too late. She felt something hard and
unforgiving hit her face, then felt a rush of warmth as her own blood gushed
from her brow down onto her chest. She pivoted, her hand grabbing with Borg
precision and she heard the satisfying crunch of her attacker’s neck breaking.
She didn’t even look at the man who had hit her, letting his lifeless body slump
to the floor as she went to help B’Elanna.</P>
<P>B’Elanna had the man in a death grip of her own. Both of her hands were
digging into his face and he was screaming. Seven’s fist crossed within a
centimeter of B’Elanna’s cheek as it shot past her from behind. Her Borg fist
caught him squarely in the nose propelling him into the forcefield.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna? Are you all right?" Seven ignored her own bleeding face as she
searched her wife for injuries.</P>
<P>"You’re hurt," B’Elanna said, reaching to stop the flow of blood from a deep
gash over Seven’s eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Irrelevant," Seven said harshly. Her expression was completely Borg, cold
and focused as she reached under B’Elanna’s arm and pulled back her own blood
stained Borg hand. "You are bleeding. I must find something to make a bandage
with."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened, and Seven knew without turning that the man behind
her had regained consciousness. She would see that he never woke up again. She
stood and turned, letting her rage completely loose for the first time in her
life. He gripped a crude shiv in his fist. His nose was oozing blood and his
eyes showed the anger that was churning inside him.</P>
<P>"I’m going to enjoy making you watch me kill her," he said to Seven as he
pointed B’Elanna. "Then I’m going to make you wish you were dead." </P>
<P>"Doubtful," Seven said. She stepped forward and waited for him to make his
move.</P>
<P>He lunged at her with surprising agility for a man of his size, but he had
not counted on her Borg reflexes and superior strength. She caught him by the
wrist, just below the shiv he was holding, and crushed the bones like a
Styrofoam cup. He would have dropped to his knees from the pain, but Seven
lifted him by the shattered appendage, dangling him like a fish on a line. The
last thing he saw was the look of absolute unconfined rage in her lapis blue
eyes. All of the power and speed available to Borg drones was now aimed at the
man but it was not held in check by the logical hive mind, it was raw, untamed
energy turned loose, like unleashing a hurricane. But this hurricane had free
will, free will intent on his destruction. </P>
<P>"No…" he begged as she flung him into the wall as if brushing dust from her
sleeve. She pounced on him before he even hit the floor and gripped him by the
neck and squeezed his throat until her fingers met. She climbed off of him and
returned to B’Elanna. The Klingon was bent over, trying to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven eased her up so that she could look at her. B’Elanna was pale,
her face was covered in sweat, and her were eyes glazed over. "B’Elanna, talk to
me," Seven demanded.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna whispered as her body went limp.</P>
