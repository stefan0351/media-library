<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Seventeen: Freedom -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway prowled the observation room like a caged tiger, a tiger that
hadn’t eaten in days and had several thorns in her paws. The few hours of sleep
the night before had been filled with nightmares about B’Elanna and Seven. She
had awakened somewhat rested, but it only served to add fuel to her anger
because now she was rested enough to lash out.</P>
<P>"This is ridiculous," Janeway said angrily. "Their sentence ends today, why
can’t we see them?"</P>
<P>"Because," the Overseer explained, "Until they have been checked for injuries
and cleared to leave, they are still in our custody, and the Magistrate will be
here at any moment."</P>
<P>"I have my own Doctor," Janeway said. Her voice was calm, but her slate blue
eyes were beginning to show signs of the rage bubbling to the surface. It would
not have been a good day for Janeway to play poker.</P>
<P>"Please, it is only a while longer," the Overseer asked.</P>
<P>"Captain, please sit down," the Doctor said as he put his hand on Janeway’s
shoulder.</P>
<P>"I tired of waiting," Janeway told the hologram as she shrugged her shoulder
out of his grasp. "I would think that you would want to be there to treat them
as soon as possible," she accused.</P>
<P>"Believe me, I do. But getting kicked off of the space station won’t help
matters." The Doctor looked away, giving Janeway his best insulted sigh.</P>
<P>"How much longer?" the Captain demanded.</P>
<P>"The ship is docking. It will not be long," the Overseer said. Her face
showed genuine concern.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor began, "I’ve been upgrading my program, with an
emphasis on post traumatic stress disorder and internment mentality."</P>
<P>Janeway sighed, and pinched the bridge of her nose. "Doctor, the last time
you tried to add a psychiatric subroutine, you ended up on the holographic couch
yourself."</P>
<P>"I am aware of that," he said indignantly. "I did not alter my matrix. I have
been studying every available text on the subjects. I am learning how to treat
them, going back to school you might say."</P>
<P>"I don’t think your playing Freud is going to help matters," Janeway said.
She knew it was unkind, but the hologram’s self-inflated attitudes usually
ending up hurting people.</P>
<P>"I assure you, Captain, my studies have given me excellent insight into the
issues at hand." The Doctor went to the window and stared in at the empty
medical facilities and then turned. "I had to try something, Captain. I was
simply out of my professional league." It was an admission he had never made
before.</P>
<P>"I hope it’s enough," Janeway said. She thought of Seven and B’Elanna on the
prison planet for two and a half long years, and her patience ended. "Overseer,
what difference could a few minutes possibly make to your people? After all
the…inconsistencies with what you’ve told me, I think a little flexibility would
be a good show of faith. Please, let my Doctor and I be present for the medical
check up."</P>
<P>The Overseer seemed torn, then lifted a small device from her neck and
checked it. Apparently it was a timepiece. "The Magistrate will be here within
the hour. We must hurry."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Doctor studied the various medical devices in the facilities like a
Ferengi in the Great Treasury, moving excitedly from one device to the next.</P>
<P>"You have an optical regenerator?" the hologram asked, as he picked up a
small hand held device. "The Federation has only begun to work with these."</P>
<P>"It is a useful tool," said Dr. Alteron. He smiled and seemed intrigued by
the hologram, patiently answering each question.</P>
<P>Janeway paced for several minutes before finding a quiet corner to stand
where she was near the doorway. She wanted to be close when Seven…and B’Elanna
came in. </P>
<P>The door opened, and two guards came in half leading, half carrying Seven of
Nine. Her fully human eye was swollen shut with a ragged gash from her eyebrow
over her forehead and disappearing into her hairline. She kept turning her head,
which made it difficult to get a clear look at her injuries.</P>
<P>Janeway’s knees felt like they had turned to water and her stomach clinched
as looked at the damage Seven had endured, worse yet, she had probably been
enduring similar hardships the entire time.</P>
<P>"Let me go," Seven said as she yanked one of the guards back around in a half
circle.</P>
<P>"Our doctors are doing their best," Malok said gently. He was on Seven’s
left, his grip more supporting than restraining.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Janeway said tentatively. Her voice was deep and rich and full of
love, even the Dengari doctors paused to look at the captain.</P>
<P>Seven spun, not believing her ears, to see Captain Janeway standing five feet
away. "Captain? You waited?" Relief washed through her; <I>Voyager</I> had
waited. Seven tugged her arms, and the guards released her. She went toward the
captain who had opened her arms.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled as Seven rushed toward her, but just before their bodies met,
Seven’s eyes widened when she saw something off to the captain’s left.</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Seven yelled, and sprinted past Janeway. She grabbed him by the arm
and yanked him toward the door where she had just entered. If he had been flesh
and blood, that flesh would have been ripped when she yanked his arm with enough
force to dislocate his shoulder. Being a hologram, it merely struck him as a
trifle rude.</P>
<P>"Seven, I’m a doctor not a pull toy," he said, though he was thrilled to see
her excited greeting.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna has been injured," Seven said as if that explained everything. "You
must assist the Dengari surgeons."</P>
<P>"Well right now, I think I should take a look at that nasty gash," he said as
he stopped, yanking Seven to a halt with him. There were advantages to
holographic strength.</P>
<P>"No," Seven stated. "Anyone can treat my injury. The Dengari do not have
experience with Klingon physiology. You must go to her." There was a pleading in
her voice that the Doctor had never heard.</P>
<P>"All right, Seven, but you stay here," he said. He looked over to Dr.
Alteron, who nodded and pointed to the exit.</P>
<P>Janeway put her hand on Seven’s shoulder. "Seven, let these people help you,"
she said. "Come on." She guided Seven toward an exam table. </P>
<P>"Let me take a look at that cut," Dr. Alteron said as he guided Seven onto
the high exam table. "Easy, we’re here to help."</P>
<P>"Help?" Seven asked angrily. "Your people’s help is exactly what caused this,
and if B’Elanna dies I will destroy your entire race," she said, her voice like
caustic venom.</P>
<P>"Seven, take it easy," Janeway said, clearly concerned. Dr. Alteron didn’t
take the threat seriously, but the Starfleet captain knew that the tall blonde
could probably pull off the threat.</P>
<P>"These people put vicious convicts into our cell while we were sleeping,"
Seven told Janeway in a deadly, calm tone.</P>
<P>Janeway’s protective streak went on Red Alert. "What?" She spun and faced the
Overseer but didn’t take her hand off of Seven’s shoulder. "Is this how you run
your facility?"</P>
<P>"I assure you, the offenders will be punished," the Overseer insisted.</P>
<P>"I have already dealt with them," Seven said dangerously. "As I will deal
with all of your species if B’Elanna does not survive." </P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway said, putting her other hand onto the former drone’s
opposite shoulder mimicking a lover’s embrace. "The Doctor will help her," she
promised, though it was an empty promise considering that she had no idea how
badly Lieutenant Torres was injured.</P>
<P>"He must," Seven whispered. Her lip trembled, and to Kathryn’s stunned
amazement, tears rolled down Seven’s cheeks. Seven burst into tears and Kathryn
pulled her into a hug, feeling a little guilty for enjoying the warmth of her
body when she was obviously so upset.</P>
<P>"Shh," Kathryn murmured. She was glad that Seven and B’Elanna had apparently
bonded. Having a good friend would have made the ordeal more manageable,
although Seven didn’t seem too much worse for wear despite the cut on her head.
In fact, she looked healthy, and her long blonde braid was quite attractive.
Kathryn pushed that thought aside, realizing how inappropriate it was under the
current conditions. </P>
<P>Dr. Alteron interrupted. "I need to heal that wound." He stood with a dermal
regenerator in his hand.</P>
<P>"Come on," Kathryn said in a husky whisper. "Let’s have a look at you."</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said as she let Dr. Alteron scan and then heal her.
</P>
<P>Seven studied the captain while Dr. Alteron worked. This was a woman she had
once thought she loved, but now, as she looked at Janeway’s soft features, she
knew it hadn’t been love. Well, it may have been love, but not in same way that
she loved B’Elanna. Her love for the Captain had been a distant admiration that
never could have lead anywhere, not with the Captain’s rank in the way. Janeway
was reserved, she had to be because of her position, and now Seven knew how
truly unappealing that would have been. She had tasted… no, savored, every
minute with B’Elanna, both women grabbing onto their love with both hands and
squeezing very ounce of happiness from it, and Seven couldn’t imagine settling
for any less.</P>
<P>Alteron finished and stepped back, smiling at the beautiful woman sitting in
front of him. "Okay," he said. "I need to complete the exam."</P>
<P>Seven nodded, then turned to Janeway, suddenly realizing that she should not
have been there at all. "Captain, why is <I>Voyager</I> still here?"</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway began carefully. "Do you remember the planet we got trapped
in orbit around? With the unusual temporal differential?"</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said, somewhat offended. It had only been two and a half
years after all, and her eidetic memory retained information much longer than
that.</P>
<P>"Jusari Prime is like that planet," Kathryn said delicately.</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven said as if she had just been told the day’s lunch menu. "How much
time has passed for <I>Voyager</I>?"</P>
<P>"You were on the plant for five days, our time," Kathryn said. She smiled at
the blonde’s resilience, one of the many things she loved about her.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna will be pleased," Seven said, then her eyes filled with tears. "She
must be all right."</P>
<P>Dr. Alteron stopped his scan, pausing over Seven’s stomach, then he stepped
away and spoke to a nurse before returning. "Excuse me," he said gently.</P>
<P>"Is B’Elanna out of surgery?" Seven regarded him like a bug she was deciding
whether or not to step on depending on his news about B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I don’t know," he said, not expecting the question. "I need to ask you…if
you are aware of your… condition, and how you wish to proceed."</P>
<P>"Condition?" Janeway asked. She didn’t like the sound of Alteron’s voice or
the way the conversation was heading.</P>
<P>Alteron dipped his head and his eyes softened. "We can terminate the
pregnancy if you wish," he said.</P>
<P>Seven was off of the bed and had her hands around his throat before he even
saw her move. The raging hurricane was back at full force.</P>
<P>"I should snap your neck right here," she said, her voice like liquid
nitrogen.</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway said, grabbing her arm only to find it as rigid as duranium
deck plating. "Let him go, he just wants to help you."</P>
<P>"Help?" Seven lifted him into the air using his throat as a convenient handle
and flung him several feet away. He landed in a heap, coughing, gasping for air
and rubbing his throat. "This is how they help? By putting monsters into our
cells and killing our unborn children?"</P>
<P>"Easy. No one is going to do anything you don’t want them to," Janeway said
as she moved toward Seven. The tall former Borg looked like a wounded, trapped
animal, and Kathryn wondered how she had endured on the unforgiving planet. It
was a testament to Seven’s humanity that she wouldn’t blame an unborn child for
the brutal manner in which it was conceived. Kathryn didn’t know if she would
have the strength to keep a child born of such brutality.</P>
<P>Seven backed up against the exam table and closed her eyes. "Lana," she
whispered.</P>
<P>The door opened as if on cue, and the Klingon in question came into the room
dressed only in a surgical gown that barely covered her knees. She took one look
at Seven’s distressed state and her eyes flashed dangerously.</P>
<P>"What the hell did you do to her?" B’Elanna demanded.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven yelled as her eyes popped open. She sprinted toward the scantly
clad Klingon, picking her up and holding her to her chest. "Lana, they want to
take the baby," she whispered into her wife’s ear.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna squirmed and stood back on the ground. She turned and faced
the medial staff, keeping Seven behind her body protectively. Her hand reached
behind her, her fingers entwining with Seven’s. "Who? Who tried to hurt our
baby?" Her voice was wild but strangely calm, a terrifying combination.</P>
<P>"It’s a misunderstanding, B’Elanna," Janeway said. She was confused by the
Klingon’s use of the phrase ‘our child,’ but she passed it off as B’Elanna
volunteering to help raise the baby. "No one will do anything against her
will."</P>
<P>"Damn right, they wont," B’Elanna said. She eased back, until she felt the
warmth of Seven’s chest against her back…her very bare back. She looked at
Malok, who had remained in the room, but kept out of the way near the door.
"Where are my clothes?"</P>
<P>The tall guard actually smirked. "The nurse has them, what’s left of
them."</P>
<P>"Captain," the holographic Doctor whined. "We should get them back to
<I>Voyager</I> so I can run my own tests on them. I explained to Lieutenant
Torres about the temporal differential, and she just wants to go back home."</P>
<P>Janeway turned to him while the nurse gave B’Elanna her pants. Her shirt had
been destroyed by the stabbing and the physicians cutting it off for surgery.
</P>
<P>"Doctor, I think that’s the best idea you’ve had all day," the Captain
said.</P>
<P>"I really think we should go," he said quietly. He raised his eyebrows to
make the point. "Now."</P>
<P>"What is it?" Janeway whispered, pulling him off to one side.</P>
<P>"Captain, regardless of Seven’s willingness to keep the child and Lieutenant
Torres’ willingness to assist her, do we really want another Borg on board? I
have no idea whether or not the…child… will be born sprouting implants and
assimilation tubules. The sooner we find out, the sooner we can…take
action."</P>
<P>Janeway’s face whitened. She wondered how much more Seven would be forced to
endure. "Let’s go home, people," the captain said. She watched as Seven
interacted with B’Elanna, the way they touched often and intimately, their hands
lingering, as well as the frequent eye contact they shared. "<I>No</I>," she
thought. "<I>Not the two of them</I>"</P>
<P>"Let’s go," B’Elanna said to Seven, taking her hand and leading the way.</P>
<P>Malok held up a hand, stopping her. "I will have your…things…delivered to the
airlock," he said.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said. Of all the Dengari, he seemed to be the most
compassionate, and had he not been a guard, she thought she would have liked
him.</P>
<P>Kathryn lingered behind with the Overseer as the small group was led through
the corridors. "Are we finished?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Yes, and I would suggest that you leave before the Magistrate arrives," the
Overseer said.</P>
<P>"Oh?" the captain asked as she walked. Her eyes kept being drawn back to
Seven and B’Elanna’s joined hands, the way they moved as one despite their
vastly different strides, as if walking hand in hand was something they did
everyday.</P>
<P>"The Magistrate will not be pleased that I have afforded you so
many…privileges. Nor will he be pleased that your people were allowed in the
examining room," she explained, then she looked into Kathryn’s face, and Janeway
saw fear in the Overseer’s dark eyes. "It would be best if you were outside his
reach when he arrives."</P>
<P>"All right," the captain said. She glanced back up at her two rescued
crewmembers. "B’Elanna?" </P>
<P>"Yes?" The Klingon paused but didn’t release Seven’s hand. Seven stopped
beside her without missing a beat and waited patiently.</P>
<P>"A word?" Janeway asked. </P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and finally let go of Seven’s hand and Kathryn released the
breath she had been holding.</P>
<P>"What is it, captain?" B’Elanna asked when she reached the auburn-headed
woman.</P>
<P>"I know you and Seven have been depending on each other exclusively these
past few years… I hope you will help her make the adjustment to being back with
our crew," Kathryn said as she took B’Elanna by the arm and continued down the
corridor. "It might be difficult for her when you go back to your life and she
finds herself alone again. I’ll help her as much as I can, but she may need to
see you more frequently than before you two left <I>Voyager</I>." </P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna nodded trying to decide if the captain was trying to get
her to spend time with Seven or arrange for her to accidentally slip out an
airlock, then dismissed the idea knowing the captain was a woman of honor.</P>
<P>"She seems…fond of you, B’Elanna, but I don’t want you feeling obligated."
Kathryn could see that Seven had grown very attached to the Klingon, and didn’t
want B’Elanna to go back to the way things were in the past, though she guessed
that the two had bonded against the common enemies they had faced on the planet.
She hoped Seven wasn’t confusing B’Elanna’s caring for more than the Klingon was
able to offer.</P>
<P>"Oh, really?" B’Elanna asked. Klingon jealousy was powerful thing. It didn’t
really matter if a Klingon’s mate is straying, it’s enough that someone else
seems to be sniffing around, even if they aren’t making a move on the mate in
question. "So you think I should…make a little time in my busy schedule for her
before jumping back into my life?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Something like that," Kathryn said. "Although I’m sure you’ll be busy
catching up on all the technical things you’ve been away from so long," Kathryn
said. She was having her own green eyed monster nagging at the back of her mind,
wondering if the friendship she had enjoyed with Seven would be resumed now that
Seven seemed to depend on Torres. "But I assure you, I’ll be more than happy to
help Seven adjust," Kathryn said sincerely. Even if she couldn’t be with Seven,
she didn’t want to lose the friendship they had shared.</P>
<P>"Really?" B’Elanna stopped and looked the captain over. It was quite clear
that the crush Seven used to have on the captain had been mutual, and while
Seven had moved on, Janeway hadn’t had the passage of two and a half years to do
the same. "I think Seven and I will handle things just fine," B’Elanna said
slowly, then pushed down her jealousy. </P>
<P>She really did care for the captain, and it wasn’t her fault she had lost
out, even if she didn’t know it yet. Then B’Elanna realized, that yes, it was
her fault, but instead of making her angry, it made her feel sincere compassion
for the captain. "Um, Captain, I think there are a few things we need to talk
about," the Klingon began. "But I think it would be best if we waited until we
get settled on board." B’Elanna didn’t want to break the news on a hostile space
station.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway agreed, though she had a feeling she wasn’t going to
like the topic.</P>
<P>Up ahead, Seven was not enjoying the Doctor’s company. He seemed to have
damaged his matrix during Seven’s absence and had an overwhelming need to
discuss Seven’s <I>feelings</I>. Asking her, "and how does that make you feel?"
and saying things like, "That must have been very hard for you." Seven was
tired, and she wanted to feel B’Elanna in her arms to make sure that her wife
was all right. Perhaps she could convince her beloved Klingon to go back to
B’Elanna’s quarters, their quarters, and take a nap. Seven paused and looked
back at B’Elanna. She could tell that her wife was upset about something.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"What is it, Seven?" B’Elanna’s eyes lit up as she looked down the corridor
and the edges of her lips curled up unconsciously.</P>
<P>"I am tired, Be’nal," Seven said as she held out her hand. "Can we take a
nap?"</P>
<P>"Of course, love," B’Elanna said as she rushed to catch up with Seven before
she realized that the words were out of her mouth.</P>
<P>Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and pulled her close, feeling the Klingon’s hand
wrap around her waist as naturally as breathing. "I missed you," Seven said as
she placed a quick kiss on B’Elanna head.</P>
<P>B’Elanna paused, thinking about the captain’s feelings, but then realized she
wasn’t about to snub the love of her life. She leaned into Seven and squeezed
her, then let her hand slide down to Seven’s tummy. "Me too. Let’s go home."</P>
<P>Janeway felt like she had been kicked by a six legged Altarian bull. Seven
had called B’Elanna "Be’nal," and while Janeway’s Klingon was rusty, she knew
that was the word for wife. She followed quietly, not wanting to intrude on such
a private moment.</P>
<P>"Wife?" the Doctor asked. He spoke fluent Klingon and had no problem
intruding. "What on earth do you mean by that, Seven?"</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna had stopped, and Janeway caught up with the small group
just as the explanations came.</P>
<P>"We’ve been married for two years," B’Elanna said proudly. She felt bad for
the captain, but she wasn’t about to let Seven mistake that concern for a lack
of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>"Two years, one month, sixteen days," Seven corrected and then kissed
B’Elanna’s temple.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and blushed. "Yes, dear. How silly of me to be so
inaccurate." She leaned into the willowy blonde, letting her hands tickle
Seven’s ribs. The exBorg squirmed, but seemed to be more than willing to indulge
the Klingon’s playful torture.</P>
<P>"Congratulations," Janeway said. She could see the happiness in both women’s
eyes along with the palpable presence of love. "I’m glad you two found something
good to take away from this experience."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes drifted to Seven’s belly and her smile grew. Anyone who was
used to seeing B’Elanna Torres, angry Klingon with an attitude, wouldn’t have
recognized the woman in front of them. B’Elanna’s eyes were filled with wonder
as her hand caressed Seven’s belly. </P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said quietly. She linked her hand over B’Elanna’s holding it
there. "We have many things to be thankful for."</P>
<P>"You intend to keep the child?" the Doctor asked. He wasn’t known for his
subtlety or his ability to notice anyone else’s emotions.</P>
<P>"Why would we not?" Seven demanded. "We planned this pregnancy and are
looking forward to our daughter’s birth."</P>
<P>Janeway didn’t know how much more she could handle, so she shifted into
captain mode. "Let’s get back to <I>Voyager</I> and we can discuss this there.
Come on," she ordered and then marched on in front of her crew.</P>
