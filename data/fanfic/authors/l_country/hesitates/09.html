<P>B’Elanna inhaled deeply, taking in the scent of Seven’s unique aroma, the
lingering smell of candles long since burned out, and the musky reminders of the
many hours of lovemaking the night before. Once Opaca had cleared Seven for most
types of pleasure, the exBorg was quite eager to try them all. B’Elanna sighed.
Life was good.</P>
<P>She opened one eye and saw that the lights were up, signifying the beginning
of the dayshift, but B’Elanna had no desire to move from her present location.
She was sprawled over Seven, her face nestled on the lanky blonde’s shoulder,
her arm resting over her wife’s abundant cleavage and she had her leg resting on
top of Seven’s thigh. B’Elanna could tell by Seven’s even breathing that her
Be’nal was still deep in the arms of Morpheus. </P>
<P>She smiled, completely content, and let her hand make the journey down
Seven’s long torso. B’Elanna’s caramel colored hand was a stark contrast to
Seven’s alabaster skin. B’Elanna’s hand lingered as she traced the metal Borg
bands under her wife’s ribs, then continued her journey until her hand rested on
Seven’ bulging belly.</P>
<P>Seven didn’t move or acknowledge the touch, the former drone was exhausted,
and B’Elanna felt a smile tug at her lips. She was feeling rather smug, quite
the lover, and more than a little proud of the thorough ravishing she had given
her wife the night before. Of course, Seven had done her own share of ravishing,
as B’Elanna’s muscle were reminding her at the moment. The Klingon’s compact
body felt like her muscles had been replaced with one of the ship’s the gel
packs. Even if she had wanted to climb off of her wife, she wasn’t sure that she
could. Plus, it just felt so damn good to be with Seven.</P>
<P>She stayed there, smiling in the early morning hours, and tried to absorb the
feelings and sensations. She didn’t ever want to take her life with Seven for
granted. As she was beginning to drift back off to sleep, she heard the chime in
the outer room signaling that someone was at the door. She briefly considered
phasering whoever was it was from her present location, but decided that it
would take too much effort. She would have to get up to retrieve a phaser from
the small weapons locker at the back of her closet, and then there was the fact
that she would have to shoot through the bedroom wall and the door to hit the
offending party. Besides, she would have to wake Seven. Only her wife’s Borg
enhanced optical implant could make that shot.</P>
<P>The chime sounded again, and B’Elanna carefully extracted herself from her
wife’s embrace. At least Seven hadn’t woken up. B’Elanna grabbed her thick robe
from its peg on the wall and pulled it snugly around her athletic body and
closed the bedroom door before trotting out to the living room. She smiled as
she stepped over her crumpled uniform. Seven had ripped it off her body as soon
as the door had hissed shut the night before. A quick glance confirmed
B’Elanna’s suspicion that the seams had been completely ripped out. She lost
many tunics that way.</P>
<P>The chime sounded again as B’Elanna reached the door, and it was beginning to
irritate her. She punched the locking mechanism and put her hands on her hips as
the door opened. Her good mood suddenly disappeared.</P>
<P>"Hi, B’Elanna," Tom Paris said sheepishly. He was shifting his weight back
and forth from one foot to the other.</P>
<P>"You," B’Elanna growled as she shoved him out into the corridor. "What are
you doing here?" she demanded quietly. She turned back and closed the door then
gave Tom her complete attention. </P>
<P>"I came by to talk to you…about … well, you know," he said as he tugged at
his collar.</P>
<P>"I should kill you," B’Elanna said, her voice far too calm for Tom’s liking.
"You hit my wife, you bastard."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I wasn’t… it wasn’t my fault," he whined. "I came to apologize."
Despite his good intentions, his eyes lingered on B’Elanna. Her robe was open at
the top revealing her coffee colored skin.</P>
<P>"Keep looking at me like that and I’ll rip your eyes out and give them to
Seven for earrings." B’Elanna pulled the robe tightly closed around her
neck.</P>
<P>"Sorry," he stammered and looked at the carpeting. </P>
<P>"Just leave, Paris," she said. "And maybe I won’t have to kill you."</P>
<P>"That sounds almost like you forgive me." He lifted his head and gave her his
most suave smile.</P>
<P>B’Elanna growled and her eyes narrowed. "Look, the Doctor said you weren’t
responsible…so I am trying to cut you some slack…" She could feel her pulse
pounding as she fought to keep her hands from wrapping around his throat. "But
you don’t have any excuse now, so I am giving you fair warning… anymore crap
from you and I will take action. Klingon action."</P>
<P>"Okay," he said quietly then decided to push his luck, after all, no guts…no
glory. He just forgot that you have to keep your guts to get any glory. "Lana,"
he said as he stepped closer. "I never would have… betrayed you with that
hologram if I’d been in my right mind. You know that. You and Seven got married,
and I accept that," he said and reached for her hand. "But, I have prior
rights."</P>
<P>He got a right, a right hook.</P>
<P>"Hey!" he yelled as he stumbled back and grabbed his jaw. "What the hell was
that for?"</P>
<P>"That was for all the crap you keep putting me through," B’Elanna said
through clenched teeth. "That was because if I did what I really want to do,
what Klingon honor demands… I’d be court martialed." She backed away from him
and leaned against the wall, glad to see that no one else was in the long
hallway. "You never could leave well enough alone, could you, Tom?"</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I know you can’t really be in love with her," Tom said as he stood
just outside of her attack zone. "You love me."</P>
<P>She rolled her eyes and let out a long sigh, then rubbed her temples.</P>
<P>"You do love me, don’t you?" he asked, taking her silence for an admission of
love.</P>
<P>"Tom, you are so clueless," she finally said. She looked at him, and actually
felt sorry for him. </P>
<P>"Help me understand," he asked sincerely. "You couldn’t stand her before you
left on that mission. Now, I’m supposed to just accept that you left me for a
Borg?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna fought the urge choke him. "She is not a Borg," B’Elanna said with
dangerous calm. "As for me leaving you? Geeze, Tom. I broke up with you a
<I>month</I> before I left. We were never right for each other. You spent more
time in the holodeck than you ever did with me, and frankly, we were never in
love."</P>
<P>"Don’t say that." Tom moved closer, then stopped as she narrowed her eyes
when he reached out to touch her. "Lana, we had…have something."</P>
<P>"Tom, I thought I loved you," she said gently. "I really did. Hell, maybe on
some level I did love you. You aren’t always a complete ass. Just most of the
time."</P>
<P>"It’s part of my charm," he said with a crooked grin.</P>
<P>"I don’t want charm," B’Elanna said as she pushed off of the wall. "I love
Seven. More than I ever thought possible. She is my life, Tom. You and I had a
distraction for a while, we passed time together, and you’ll always have a place
inside my heart because of that. You helped me when we were both lost."</P>
<P>"But, I love you," he whined.</P>
<P>B’Elanna covered her eyes and sighed, then let her hand rub roughly down her
face until she bit her knuckle. She looked up at him and shook her head. "Tom, I
didn’t even know what love was when I was with you. Seven taught me what love
is. She and I are soulmates; my heart only beats because she wills it to. If I
lost her, I would die."</P>
<P>"And the baby? Was that her idea?" he asked. He was beginning to understand
that he wasn’t going to win this fight.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s whole face lit up, and Tom took a step back, shocked by the
metamorphosis he had just witnessed.</P>
<P>"It was your idea?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Our idea," she corrected. "And I have never been happier." She looked over
her shoulder, remembering the gorgeous blonde she had left sprawled naked in her
bed.</P>
<P>"I’m really sorry I hit her," Tom said sincerely.</P>
<P>"I know," B’Elanna said as she turned back to him. "That’s why you’re still
breathing," she added with a tiny grin.</P>
<P>"And the Vulcan salve…" Tom added.</P>
<P>"And the smart ass remarks?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Tom covered his face and shook his head. "Thank you, for not killing me," he
mumbled between his fingers.</P>
<P>"You should thank Seven," B’Elanna pointed out. "She’s much more Klingon than
I’ll ever be."</P>
<P>"Really?" he asked as he looked up at her. </P>
<P>Two crewmen stepped out of the turbolift and walked toward them. B’Elanna
moved out of their path and pulled her robe tighter.</P>
<P>"Really," she said when they passed. "I had to keep her from… well, you
<I>really</I> don’t want to know what I kept her from doing. I don’t want you
having nightmares."</P>
<P>"I already am," he said quietly as he remembered the rage-filled look Seven
had in her eyes as she had threatened to assimilate him. "Are you telling me she
gets worse than she did in the holodeck?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna frowned. "She’s really upset about that, Tom. She didn’t know why
you were acting the way you did, and when she found out, it almost broke her
heart," B’Elanna explained. "If you give her any grief about it, you’ll answer
to me."</P>
<P>"She felt bad?" Tom asked incredulously. "Why? I was a complete ass."</P>
<P>"Because, Tom, she would never hurt an innocent person," B’Elanna explained.
"Once she found out that you were holo-drugged, she felt awful. She has more
honor than any person I have ever met."</P>
<P>"Guess that’s one of the reasons you love her," he admitted.</P>
<P>"One of many," she said with a smile and looked back over her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Go," Tom said. "She’s probably wondering where you are."</P>
<P>"Thanks, Tom," B’Elanna said as she turned to go back inside her quarters.
"Oh, and Tom?"</P>
<P>"Yeah?" He stopped and ran his hands through his hair.</P>
<P>"Don’t ever call on us this early again on our day off." She motioned to her
robe.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, it’s after 11:00," he pointed out.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well… we need our rest," B’Elanna said with an evil grin. "We didn’t
get any sleep last night."</P>
<P>He looked confused, then blushed. "I really didn’t need to know that," he
said as he sighed.</P>
<P>"Consider it partial payment for your asinine behavior," B’Elanna said as she
went into her quarters and locked the door. She smiled, happy with the way the
conversation had went, and turned to see a very naked Borg standing at the
bedroom door… naked and more than a little agitated. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres," Seven said as she crossed her arms over her naked chest.
"I awoke to find you gone. Then I heard you in the corridor with Tom Paris. I
did not expect to have you return dressed only in a robe."</P>
<P>"But… I… Seven," B’Elanna stuttered. She turned and pointed at the door and
then looked back at her wife. "I didn’t want to wake you," she finally managed
to say.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked as she raised her Borg eyepiece.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt panic rising inside her and then she noticed that Seven’s eyes
were sparkling and there was a hint of a smirk at the edge of the former Borg’s
full lips.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said as she moved closer. "Besides, I didn’t think you’d mind
Tom looking at me." She opened her robe and let it fall to the floor. "Looking
never hurt anyone, did it?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled and lunged forward, grabbing B’Elanna around the waist and
pulling their naked bodies together. "If he looks at you, it will hurt him." She
kissed B’Elanna briefly then pulled back. "I am glad you have come to an
understanding with him," Seven said. "And that he was not seriously injured…by
me." </P>
<P>"I should spank you for scaring me when I came back in here," B’Elanna said
as she reached behind Seven and gave her a gentle swat on her bare skin. "How
did you know what we said?"</P>
<P>Seven raised both eyebrows in unison, not believing that her wife had even
asked the question.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said with a smile. "Borg enhanced hearing."</P>
<P>"I will expect my earrings the next time he leers at you," Seven said as she
moved them both toward the bedroom.</P>
<P>"I was kinda’ hopping you hadn’t heard that part," B’Elanna said as she
remembered her interesting suggestion for an alternate use of the helmsman’s
eyes.</P>
<P>"Enough talk about him," Seven said. "Come back to bed. I have plans for
you."</P>
<P>"All right," B’Elanna said with an exaggerated sigh. "But after last night…
you’ve got a tough act to follow."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven enjoyed a good challenge. "I shall endeavor to… better my
performance from last night."</P>
<P>"Kahless, help me," B’Elanna said with a laugh, only half joking.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway walked into the arboretum and stared at the activity in front
of her. Tach had rounded up most of the off duty science officers with any
experience in botany or biology and had them working like a well-oiled army.
They were all on their hands and knees, crawling around in a field of what
appeared to be wheat, waving dermal regenerators over the tiny stalks.</P>
<P>"If I hadn’t seen it for myself, I wouldn’t have believed it," Janeway said
as she walked up behind Tach.</P>
<P>"Captain," he said with a huge smile as he turned around. "What do you
think?" he asked as he pointed to the huge expanse of wheat.</P>
<P>"Remarkable," she said. "How did you manage this?" Janeway tugged at a stalk
of wheat and rolled it between her fingers. Years on an agricultural park gave
her the experience to know that the crop was at least three months into its
growth season. As the captain of <I>Voyager</I>, she knew the crop hadn’t
existed the previous day.</P>
<P>"Dermal regenerators," he said. He held up a regenerator from one of the
dozens of emergency medical packs. "If you alter the polarity and adjust the
setting to cause new growth instead of healing old tissue, it increases the
growth of the plantlife exponentially."</P>
<P>Tuvok came over to the Captain. "At this rate, we will have a full compliment
of wheat in two days," he said succinctly. He had wheat sticking to his hair and
his trousers were wrinkled and had wheat protruding from every pocket. It was a
very unusual combination for the always perfect Vulcan whose close-cropped hair
and neatly pressed trousers usually looked like the pictures from a Starfleet
manual. The explanation came crawling up behind him.</P>
<P>"Tu-vee!" Ty yelled as he gripped the Vulcan’s legs from behind. "Tu-vee,
up!" the Narian boy demanded.</P>
<P>"The methods employed can be transferred to almost any vegetation," Tuvok
said as he scooped up Ty and settled the boy onto one hip. "We need only supply
extra nutrients for the faster growth requirements." As Tuvok spoke, he
intercepted Ty’s hands, which kept grabbing the Vulcan’s neatly trimmed
hair.</P>
<P>"Ty," Tach said sternly. "Leave the nice man alone." He reached for his son
but Tuvok pivoted away. Janeway watched with a faint smile kissing her lips.</P>
<P>"The child is merely exhibiting a healthy instinct for curiosity," Tuvok
said. He finally managed to pin one of Ty’s hands down. The other hand shot up
and traced the Vulcan’s pointed ear.</P>
<P>"Bunny," Ty said as he pinched Tuvok’s ear. "Tu-vee is a bunny."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Tuvok said to the child. "I believe your conclusion if faulty."</P>
<P>Ty giggled and tugged harder. It was too much for Janeway and she laughed and
held her sides.</P>
<P>"I don’t think he’s quite old enough for Vulcan logic…Tu-vee," Janeway said
when she finally quit laughing.</P>
<P>"It is never too soon to begin a regimen of logic." Tuvok looked into Ty’s
dark eyes, his expression serious. "I have no fur, I do not hop, and my bipedal
stance is humanoid, therefore I cannot be a bunny," he told Ty.</P>
<P>"Bunny." Ty scrunched his face and then hugged Tuvok. </P>
<P>"Not a bunny," the Vulcan whispered and surprised Janeway when he moved his
hand up behind the child and rubbed his back.</P>
<P>"Tach," Janeway said as she turned her attention back to the adult Narian.
"This is wonderful, but why?"</P>
<P>"You’re transporting my family and I a great distance," Tach explained. "We
pull our own weight."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Janeway said sincerely. "This is more than enough payment. The
expenditure of dermal regenerator energy is minuscule compared to the amount of
replicator rations it would take to create this much wheat. And, all of these
plants will give us some well needed fresh oxygen."</P>
<P>"I am glad my experience is helpful," Tach said. "But the dermal regenerator
was Seven’s idea. She’s quite a farmer."</P>
<P>"Evan!" Ty yelled and he pulled away from Tuvok. "Where Evan?"</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is not here. We are merely discussing her achievements," Tuvok
said as he shifted Ty to the opposite side. He sensed from Ty’s abundant amount
of squirming that he wanted down. As soon as Ty was on the decking, he crawled
off toward his father with incredible speed.</P>
<P>Ty paused and looked up with questioning eyes at his father, wondering if
Seven was somewhere nearby. Tach shook his head and Ty scrambled off toward the
wheat when he saw Samantha Wildman crawl out of the growing field.</P>
<P>"Seven came up with this?" Janeway asked. "I never pictured her as being…
agriculturally inclined." Kathryn began to wonder if she understood the former
drone at all. She had never pictured Seven with children or in a
non-technological setting. Maybe Seven’s growing family would be happy living on
a farming planet with Tach, Nara and Ty.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is a resourceful individual," Tuvok said as he attempted to
pick the wheat out of his uniform. Most of the offending grain had been shoved
into his trousers by Ty; he saw the dark skinned officer as his own personal
play toy.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," Janeway agreed. "Tu-vee."</P>
<P>Tuvok looked unaffected, but Janeway saw a slight darkening of the skin
around his ears. It was subtle, but Janeway caught it. It was the Vulcan version
of a blush.</P>
<P>"I must check on the progress," Tach said and excused himself and went into
the wheat field.</P>
<P>"You’re very good with him," Janeway said to Tuvok as she nodded toward Ty.
"Isn’t he about the same age as your grandson?"</P>
<P>"My grandchild is almost one year older." Tuvok looked at the dark haired
child. "Despite his lack of logic, Tyralanar is incredibly intelligent. His
features are similar to early Vulcans."</P>
<P>"Tyralanar?" Janeway asked, then smiled. "Oh, you mean Ty. Yes, he is a
bright boy, and he’s taken quite a shine to Seven and B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Further proof of his intelligence," Tuvok said as he gave up trying to get
the wheat off of his trousers.</P>
<P>"Why Tuvok, that’s down right...sentimental of you," Janeway teased. "I’ve
never heard such glowing comments coming from you."</P>
<P>"I see no reason to insult me," Tuvok said as he tried unsuccessfully to
smooth his hair. Janeway smiled and picked a stalk of wheat from the top of his
head.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna was laying on her back with her arms beside her head and her
breathing came in deep gasps. She was shaking from head to toe, unable to move
beyond the muscular twitches racking her body, but there was a lazy smile
plastered across her face.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna said. "Wow... Seven, wow."</P>
<P>Seven crawled out from under the blankets and kissed B’Elanna’s stomach as
she moved up and rested her face on her wife’s chest, listening to the out of
control pounding.</P>
<P>"Wow..." B’Elanna repeated without opening her eyes.</P>
<P>"You all already said that," Seven pointed out with a smug grin. "Be’nal,
have you lost the power of speech?"</P>
<P>"Uh huh," B’Elanna responded, still unable to lift her arms. Her body was
covered with a thin sheen of sweat and she was certain that her bones had
melted.</P>
<P>"You are shaking," Seven observed. "Are you cold?"</P>
<P>"Nuh uh," B’Elanna grunted. </P>
<P>"Be’nal, are you all right?" Seven sat up and studied her wife.</P>
<P>"Uh huh," B’Elanna said as her smile widened. "Wow."</P>
<P>"Did I better my performance from last night?" Seven asked unnecessarily. She
reached over her wife and grabbed a glass of water from the nightstand.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna responded, drawing the word out into several syllables.</P>
<P>"I think you are dehydrated," Seven observed. "Drink some of this."</P>
<P>"Can’t move," B’Elanna said with a happy sigh.</P>
<P>Seven shifted her weight and lifted B’Elanna’s head from the pillow. The
Klingon seemed to have lost her spine and her head flopped over Seven’s arm.
After some maneuvering on the exBorg’s part she managed to get the glass to
B’Elanna’s lips. </P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna mumbled after she took several long gulps. "Wow." B’Elanna’s
eyes had yet to open.</P>
<P>"I believe that I may have burned out some of your synaptic relays," Seven
said cautiously. "Should I call Opaca?"</P>
<P>"Nuh uh," B’Elanna mumbled. One eye opened with extreme effort and B’Elanna’s
smile brightened when she saw Seven. The exdrone’s hair was down, out of its
braid and flowing wildly around her bare shoulders. "You... I... wow," B’Elanna
said and then flopped back onto the pillow and began giggling.</P>
<P>"This is a new reaction," Seven said as she settled next to her wife. "I
am... concerned."</P>
<P>"Don’t be," B’Elanna said as she finally raised one hand and flopped her arm
over Seven’s back. "I feel... wonderful." She took a deep breath as her body had
a strong aftershock. "Sweet Kahless," B’Elanna added with a sigh.</P>
<P>"Kahless had nothing to do with it," Seven said in Borg monotone.</P>
<P>B’Elanna giggled and tried to squeeze her wife but her arm didn’t have any
strength.</P>
<P>"Wow?" Seven asked as she kissed B’Elanna’s cheek.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna confirmed with a wicked smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Captain Janeway headed toward the mess hall, still smiling as she pictured
Tuvok holding the Narian boy. For a supposedly emotionless man, he managed to
show a great deal of caring for the child. Kathryn thought about the wheat and
hoped that Neelix would be able to make some bread that wasn’t too...Talaxian.
She wanted good old-fashioned yeast bread, warm from the oven, not some bizarre
creation with leela root or hot peppers that hid the flavor of the grain.</P>
<P>The doors to the mess hall opened and Janeway was surprised to see the entire
room packed. Everyone was clamoring to get to the kitchen area. Usually,
crewmembers were all too willing to let others cut in front of them...anything
to delay trying Neelix’s latest delicacy. She inhaled deeply and understood why
they were fighting for the meal in question. Whatever in was, it smelled
divine.</P>
<P>"Captain," Chakotay called from a table off to one side.</P>
<P>She made her way to him through the cramped room and smiled at him. "Quite a
crowd. Usually more of the crew decides to use their replicator rations."</P>
<P>"Not if they tasted this," he said as he poked his fork into a tender piece
of meat surrounded by vegetables and a thin broth.</P>
<P>"Is that corned beef?" Janeway asked. Her mouth began to water. She hadn’t
had decent corned beef since she was back on Earth in her mother’s kitchen.</P>
<P>"Well," Chakotay said. "It’s not actually corned beef, but it’s close. Nara
chased Neelix out of his kitchen this afternoon and whipped up a Narian herbed
beef recipe." He took a bite, savoring the flavor, then spoke with his mouth
full. "It’s a lot like corned beef, only a little more garlicky."</P>
<P>"I think I’ll go grab a plate," Janeway said. She stared at the commander’s
plate, noticing the way the potatoes and carrots looked just like her
mother’s.</P>
<P>"I’d use your captain’s privilege to cut to the front of the line," he said
with a smile. "There might not be any left when you get up there."</P>
<P>"Then I’ll come back and commandeer yours," she said with a smirk. She
reached down and took one of his carrots and headed off to get her own meal.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna walked hand in hand into the mass hall. They paused when
they saw the crowded room.</P>
<P>"Perhaps Mister Neelix’s cooking finally killed someone," Seven said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and tugged Seven closer. She wrapped her arms around the
willowy blonde and kissed Seven’s neck under her ear. "I love you, my
Be’nal."</P>
<P>"You are still under the effects of the ‘wow’ phenomenon," Seven
whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna blushed and nodded her head. "Oh, yeah," the Klingon said.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, over here," Tach yelled from a table at the back of the room.</P>
<P>Seven led her wife through the crowd until they found their friend. "Good
evening," Seven said formally.</P>
<P>"Have a seat," Tach said. "Nara and Ty will be right over."</P>
<P>Janeway came over with her tray and smiled at the couple. "Lieutenant, Seven,
nice to see you could join us." She sat down and dug into her meal with gusto.
"Oh my," Janeway exclaimed. "I didn’t know replicated meat could taste this
good."</P>
<P>B’Elanna inhaled, and looked curiously at the captain. "Did Neelix talk Nara
out of her recipe?"</P>
<P>"Doubtful," Seven said. She smiled as she felt B’Elanna move around behind
her and then felt her Klingon wife’s hands wrap around her from behind. The
familiar warmth on her belly made her sigh and lean back into her shorter
spouse.</P>
<P>Janeway was eating as fast as she could and still be considered an elegant
Starfleet captain. "Apparently Nara took over the kitchen. If this is the
result, I may kidnap your wife for good," the captain told Tach.</P>
<P>B’Elanna kissed Seven’s neck, still reeling from her earlier lovemaking
session. "Sit, love. I’ll go get you a plate." B’Elanna guided Seven onto the
bench and then paused long enough to give her a lingering kiss. "Don’t go
anywhere, Be’nal," she added as she caressed Seven’s cheek.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and glanced down at the table. When she did look up, Tach was
grinning at her with his eyes sparkling. It did not bode well for Seven.</P>
<P>"Finally decided to get out of bed?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>Janeway choked on her herbed beef.</P>
<P>"I believe Nara would enjoy a little more time in that particular location,"
Seven shot back. "You might ask the captain if you can borrow a uniform. Nara
finds B’Elanna quite handsome in hers."</P>
<P>Janeway took a gulp of her coffee and felt her cheeks burning bright red.</P>
<P>"If memory serves," Tach said as he stirred his coffee, "You find her quite
handsome out of uniform."</P>
<P>"Your memory is flawless," Seven said with a smirk. "Captain, are you all
right?" She turned to Janeway who was a having a coughing fit.</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said as she managed to stop coughing. "Fine. Seven, you are
looking well."</P>
<P>"I am feeling much better. Thank you, for noticing," Seven said. She smiled
when she saw B’Elanna coming back balancing two trays. "Thank you, Be’nal," she
said as she took a tray from her wife.</P>
<P>"You’re welcome." B’Elanna put her tray next to Seven’s and then straddled
the bench next to Seven and sat facing her. She pulled something out of her
jacket pocket and held it hidden in her hand. "Close your eyes," B’Elanna
ordered as she lifted it toward her wife’s mouth.</P>
<P>Seven raised her eyebrow, but did as she was told and took a bite of the
treat. Her eyes opened wide and she moaned. "Honey nut cakes," Seven mumbled
around the cookie. She took another bite. Her eyes were locked with B’Elanna’s
the entire time.</P>
<P>"Thought you’d like that," B’Elanna whispered. She reached down and rubbed
the former drone’s belly. "I know the little one craves sweets."</P>
<P>Nara came out of the kitchen carrying Ty. The small boy saw his aunts and
squealed.</P>
<P>"Ba! Evan!" He held his arms out and almost leaped into B’Elanna’s hands. She
settled him into front of her, almost on top of Seven, and ran her hand through
his hair.</P>
<P>"Have you had dinner, Ty?" Seven asked the child.</P>
<P>He nodded but reached for her plate. "Bicket," he requested.</P>
<P>"Chew it well." Seven smiled and broke off a corner of her biscuit and handed
it to him. He stuffed the entire piece into his mouth and put his hand out for
more.</P>
<P>"Hey, Tiger, let my wife get some dinner. She needs her energy," B’Elanna
said as she kissed the top of Ty’s head.</P>
<P>"I’m betting you burned up quite bit of her energy already," Nara said as she
sat next to Tach.</P>
<P>Janeway pushed her plate away. If she continued trying to eat around the
Narian’s and her crewmembers, she would certainly choke to death. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, don’t you get hot wearing that jacket all of the time?" Janeway
asked, trying to change the subject to something that didn’t involve B’Elanna
and Seven’s very active sex life.</P>
<P>"I only wear a tank top under it," B’Elanna said as she spun to sit facing
the table. Ty wiggled, content on her lap. "I guess I like feeling the weight of
it. I feel naked without it."</P>
<P>Tach started to comment, but a well placed elbow from Nara made him change
his mind. Nara leaned forward. "B’Elanna, Seven, we’ve been thinking about
something."</P>
<P>"And?" Seven looked over at her friend and put her fork down. Ty grabbed it,
but B’Elanna disarmed him before he could do any real damage.</P>
<P>"Tach’s brother left us his homestead. There are only 10,000 settlers on our
planet. It’s a solitary life and he wasn’t cut out for it," Nara explained. "His
land backs up to ours. It’s yours if you want it."</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven said nothing, then looked at each other. They exchanged
glances for a moment as if speaking telepathically. Janeway held her breath as
she waited for them to answer.</P>

<P>Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and squeezed it as she looked at Ty. Her eyes were
full of emotion, and she nodded at her wife, letting B’Elanna take the lead.</P>
<P>"Nara, we love you more than we can say," B’Elanna began. She looked over at
Janeway, seeing the older woman’s eyes locked on her. "But, <I>Voyager</I> is
our home. We will miss you, and our hearts will always feel your loss, even when
we get back to the Alpha Quadrant, but we can’t leave this ship, this crew. This
is our family…Our collective." B’Elanna smiled at Seven.</P>
<P>"Tach told me you’d say that," Nara said with a sad smile. "But we had to
ask."</P>
<P>Neelix came over to the table and shook his head. "Nara, your cooking is
quite a success. I’ve never seen anything like it," he said as he stood at the
end of the table. "The crew begged me to ask you for the recipe."</P>
<P>"I’ll give you all of my recipes, Mister Neelix. It will be nice for Seven
and B’Elanna to have some reminder of us," Nara said.</P>
<P>"We will always remember you," Seven said as she squeezed B’Elanna’s hand.
The exdrone had tears in her eyes and she couldn’t look at the Narian.</P>
<P>B’Elanna cleared her throat and reached around Ty to eat her meal. She
silently broke off a piece of her biscuit and gave it to the boy. He happily
chewed it, unaware of the topic being discussed.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The next three weeks passed too quickly for Seven but she was happy to have
the time with Tach, Nara, and especially Ty. She enjoyed as much time as she
could with her friends, but she had started up her regular duty schedule after
taking only one week off. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Narian children generally walked by the time they were one year old yet Ty
didn’t bother with walking. He went from crawling to sprinting, not wanting to
waste his time moving slowly. He dashed from one thing to the next. His two
favorite targets were B’Elanna and Seven, followed closely by Naomi Wildman and
Tuvok. Many nights B’Elanna would end her shift and meet Seven in the holodeck
with Naomi and Ty running the Flotter program. That wasn’t too surprising, but
finding Tuvok there the majority of the time had taken some getting used to.
Tuvok explained by saying that he wanted to make sure that Seven didn’t have a
relapse of her metabolic spike. That didn’t explain why he was usually on the
forest floor with Ty using him for a ladder. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>B’Elanna was on the same work schedule as Seven, and she too was not looking
forward to losing her Narian friends. B’Elanna tried to keep Seven’s mind off of
the impending loss of her friends, but it was an impossible task.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway found herself spending many hours with Nara, the spunky woman
reminded the captain of a younger version of her own mother, and it was
comforting to have someone on board who wasn’t a member of her crew to confide
in. She understood how B’Elanna and Seven had bonded with Nara and her family,
and she found herself feeling a sense of loss as they approached the system
where Tach and Nara lived.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn sat at her desk busily working on the latest energy consumption
rates. With Tach’s wheat replacing replicated food, <I>Voyager</I> had an
amazing amount of surplus energy. Add to that the fact that Tach was currently
helping to plant twelve fruit trees, and the energy totals would only be getting
better. Kathryn’s door chime sounded and she leaned back, glad for an excuse to
take a break.</P>
<P>"Come in," the captain said as she pushed away the data padd.</P>
<P>"Good afternoon, Kathryn. Don’t you ever take a break?" Nara came through the
door carrying a stasis tray.</P>
<P>"Time just got away from me," Kathryn said as she stood. "What’s that?" She
pointed to the tray.</P>
<P>"A snack," Nara said as she came up the step to Janeway’s desk. "I know you
haven’t eaten all day and I spent two days figuring out this recipe. I need you
to tell me if I got it right." Nara lifted the cover off of the tray revealing a
steaming loaf of bread.</P>
<P>Kathryn inhaled deeply, a smile covering her lips as her mouth watered. "It
smells wonderful," Kathryn said. "Where did you get the recipe?" She reached out
and took a slice from the end of the loaf and began covering it with butter.</P>
<P>"The recipe was easy," Nara said. "Tell me, who was this Betty Crocker? She
was quite prolific."</P>
<P>"She was fictional character used for advertising campaigns." Kathryn laughed
as she let the bread melt on her tongue. Her own mother would have been proud of
the baked delicacy.</P>
<P>"The recipes are well written, and precise." Nara took a slice of bread for
herself. "The hard part was coming up with yeast. Mister Neelix didn’t want me
to have it in his kitchen."</P>
<P>"We had a bad experience with cheese. It was contaminated with bacteria and
infected the gel packs… It did quite a bit of damage. I guess Neelix didn’t want
to risk a repeat, so he got rid of all the food cultures…including yeast,"
Kathryn explained.</P>
<P>"Well, I can’t imagine giving up on bread over a mishap," Nara said as she
flopped into the chair across from Janeway.</P>
<P>"I can’t imagine you giving up for any reason," Kathryn said with a sincere
smile. "Is that a trait with all Narian women, or just you?"</P>
<P>Nara’s eyes lost their spark and she suddenly looked very sad. "No, I wish it
were," she said after a moment of reflection.</P>
<P>"I didn’t mean to upset you, Nara," Kathryn said. She pushed the bread aside
and leaned forward. Her slate blue eyes darkened with concern.</P>
<P>"I am lucky," Nara said as she leaned back and crossed her arms over her
chest. "As are most of the women on Nador Omega. We are the descendants of first
terra-formers. Our ancestors were atypical, strong women who were allowed to
speak their minds. It is not so on Sha’Lar."</P>
<P>"Sha’Lar?" Kathryn asked quietly.</P>
<P>"The Narian home world. Sha’Lar means sacred land," Nara explained. "Ours is
a culture that has many contradictions. We worship the great goddess, yet women
are subjugated to the role of servants. If we lived on Sha’Lar, Tach would be
mocked, or worse for letting me have a voice in our home."</P>
<P>"I had no idea," Kathryn said. "It’s a way of thinking my people thankfully
outgrew centuries ago."</P>
<P>"Well, I’m lucky enough to live as a post terra-former. With only ten
thousand settlers, many of them are descendants of the original three hundred
terra-formers. We don’t waste our time with silly gender roles. We all do
whatever needs doing."</P>
<P>"What about the rest of your people?" Kathryn asked. She was intrigued by the
history unfolding with Nara’s tale and impressed by the strength her friend
showed in the face of societal oppression.</P>
<P>"Sha’Lar is approximately three years away at warp five, but the journey took
much longer when my grandparents made the trip. My grandmother was only fifteen
when she left with my grandfather. They were both top graduates from the Academy
of Sciences," Nara smiled, her pride showing. "Grandmother was the first woman
to graduate. It took ten years to reach Nador Omega, and they helped set up the
initial planetary meteor nets." She looked up at Kathryn and put her feet up on
the desk, smiling when Janeway’s only response was to pull the bread out of her
way. "Tach’s grandfather invented the laser targeting mechanism. There’s a large
continent named after him," Nara said.</P>
<P>"So he’s famous?" Kathryn asked, and she shook her head. Nara was entirely
too comfortable with her feet on the captain’s desk, but she didn’t want to ask
her move. "What does the targeting mechanism do?" Kathryn asked as she sat and
leaned back and rested her own feet on the desk.</P>
<P>"Nador Omega orbits through seventeen asteroid belts. Before the planet could
be terra-formed, they had to stop the impacts. The targeting mechanism aims and
fires the orbiting phaser cannons up to thirty-three hundred times per second.
It’s the backbone to the defense system." </P>
<P>"That’s pretty impressive." Kathryn sat up, her mind trying to wrap around
the necessary programming to fire that many times on a regular basis. "And here
I thought Tach was just a farmer."</P>
<P>"No," Nara shook her head. "He’s a brilliant programmer, and a damn good
pilot too. He was decorated when he served in the Stellar Guard. All of the men
are drafted when they turn seventeen and they serve at least five years. Tach
served eight."</P>
<P>"I look forward to seeing the meteor net. It sounds fascinating," Kathryn
said. "Although I don’t look forward to losing you or your family."</P>
<P>"Your crew has been incredible." Nara stood and put the stasis lid over the
bread. "I’ll ask Tach to call the Second Commander of the Stellar Guard. He went
to the academy with Tach. I’ll get you a first class tour of the
facilities."</P>
<P>"I love having connections," Kathryn said with a smirk.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna collapsed onto the couch in her quarters and let her head fall
against the headrest. She was exhausted. A blown out plasma coil had meant that
she had to spend an extra five hours working after her regular shift. She had
spent four of those extra hours on her back, crammed into a crawl space that a
Ferengi wouldn’t have fit into. It had been hot and uncomfortable and she had
banged most of the skin off of her knuckles as she used a spanner to remove the
burned out coil. All she wanted to do was take to a hot bath and crawl into bed
with her wife, but since her wife wasn’t home, she knew the second half of her
wish would have to wait.</P>
<P>She kicked off her boots, then stood and peeled off her sweat-stained uniform
and left a trail of clothes to the bathroom. "Oh yeah," she said when she saw
the fresh apple blossoms in a bowl near the tub. Seven must have left them for
her. Her wife knew how much she liked to use them to add fragrance to her bath.
She filled the tub with steaming water and was just about to step into it when
she heard the door to her quarters open. She debated whether or not to climb
into the beckoning oasis, but then remembered when Ty had dove headfirst in
after her on a previous occasion. She grabbed her robe with a sigh and headed
out to make sure Seven hadn’t brought home company. She leaned around the door
and saw Seven collapsed on the couch just like B’Elanna had been only minutes
earlier.</P>
<P>"Hey, are you just getting off duty?" B’Elanna asked from the door. She
noticed that Seven was wearing her adapted biosuit. It was blue and grey but had
a smock that she wore to cover her growing stomach. She had almost finished her
sixth month and her tall, lean frame could not hide her obviously pregnant
belly.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said as she leaned back into the couch and sighed. "We will be
reaching the Nador system tomorrow and the aft sensor array chose this time to
go off-line." Seven closed her eyes and sighed again as exhaustion settled into
every pore of her body.</P>
<P>"What was wrong?" B’Elanna moved closer, amazed by how much Seven had
mirrored her earlier actions. She sat next to her wife and kissed her temple.
Seven didn’t even open her eyes but she did smile.</P>
<P>"There was a gamma radiation leak that corroded the wiring to the array. It
took a great deal of time to find the damaged circuitry," Seven explained as she
rolled over and rested her head on B’Elanna’s shoulder. She nuzzled the fuzzy
robe and sighed again, but this time it was a sound of contentment.</P>
<P>"Radiation?" Concern filled B’Elanna’s voice.</P>
<P>"Be’nal, I had Ensign Harris handle the decontamination. I am aware of the
protocol forbidding pregnant crewmembers from knowingly exposing themselves to
any radiation." Seven groaned and rolled away from her wife. She tried to lean
forward to remove her boots but her center of gravity had her pinned to the
couch. "Lana, I am as big as a shuttle," Seven whined.</P>
<P>"I don’t even like you on the same deck with a radiation leak," B’Elanna
grumbled. "You should have been evacuated." She caressed Seven’s cheek and then
left a lingering kiss where her fingers had been. "And you are not as big as a
shuttle… maybe a class four probe, but not a shuttle."</P>
<P>"Do you enjoy our couch?" Seven asked as she tilted her head and studied
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Yes, why?" B’Elanna scooted closer to her wife.</P>
<P>"Because if you continue to tease me, you shall sleep on it," Seven
announced.</P>
<P>"How about if I help you out of that smelly uniform and we take a hot bath?"
B’Elanna offered.</P>
<P>"Smelly?" Seven asked as she watched B’Elanna stand and then kneel in front
of her.</P>
<P>"Kidding," B’Elanna said with a laugh.</P>
<P>"Couch," Seven responded. She smirked and lifted her foot.</P>
<P>"You’ll forgive me once we slide into that hot bath," the Klingon said. She
knew the water would have cooled enough to be comfortable for Seven. B’Elanna’s
higher temperature allowed her to tolerate much hotter water.</P>
<P>"We shall see," Seven said as she let B’Elanna pull her to her feet.</P>
<P>"Yes, we shall." B’Elanna leered at her wife.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven stood on the bridge at the auxiliary science station as <I>Voyager</I>
entered the Nador system. Tach and Nara stood at the back of the bridge ready to
speak to any of the Stellar Guard who might meet the Federation Starship at the
border.</P>
<P>"We’re dropping out of warp," Tom Paris said as the forward viewscreen
changed from streaks of stars to a beautiful solar system with a huge gas giant
in the distance and a scattering of planets throughout the area. The most
dominating features of the system were the many meteor fields. The closest
meteor belt was right off of <I>Voyager’s</I> aft side and extended out of the
scanners’ range.</P>
<P>"Oh my," Janeway said as she studied the massive expanse of meteors and
planetoids. "I’ve never seen so many meteors."</P>
<P>Tach moved forward from his position at the back of the bridge. "The field is
wide, it covers hundreds of thousands of kilometers, but it isn’t very deep,"
Tach explained. "We can fly over most of it."</P>
<P>"Mister Paris?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"He’s right," Tom said as he adjusted the course.</P>
<P>"This is odd." Tach rubbed his jaw.</P>
<P>"What?" Janeway turned and faced him.</P>
<P>"The Stellar Guard usually keeps ships out here on maneuvers for eight months
of the year. The new recruits spend days out here using these meteors for target
practice," Tach said.</P>
<P>"I remember," Nara said as she took her husband by the arm. "You’d be out of
contact for weeks."</P>
<P>"Why would they cancel the maneuvers?" Chakotay asked.</P>
<P>"That’s just it," Tach said. "They wouldn’t. This is one of the largest
meteor fields and the Stellar Guard tries to destroy as many of them out here as
possible. The recruits shoot at them for the eight months that Nador Omega is
out of orbital range of this field. The remaining four months we must rely on
the meteor net targeting system."</P>
<P>"The meteor field is immense. How can your people hope to make a difference?"
Tuvok tilted his head to one side.</P>
<P>Nara let out a bark of laughter. "Mister Tuvok, in the last eight decades,
the meteor fields have been reduced by over twenty percent. Hope is an endless
well, and we drink from it often."</P>
<P>"Impressive," the Vulcan responded.</P>
<P>"Harry," Janeway said as she sat in her command chair. "Send a greeting on
subspace to Nador Omega. Ask for an escort or at least permission to enter the
system."</P>
<P>"Aye ma’am," he said.</P>
<P>"Captain," Seven said quietly. </P>
<P>"Yes?" Janeway turned. Something in the tone of the former drone’s voice
alarmed her.</P>
<P>"I believe I know why the Narians would abandon their target practice," Seven
said. She had been using her long-range scanners to reach across the solar
system. "The forth planet from the Nador sun is displaying massive amounts of
radiation. There are also unusual heat readings."</P>
<P>"That’s Nador Omega," Nara said. She moved closer to Seven and looked at the
comm panel. "What does it mean?"</P>
<P>"I believe," Seven said slowly," That given the amount of sedimentary
material in the atmosphere… the meteor net has failed."</P>
<P>"That’s not possible," Tach said, but his voice was full of genuine fear.</P>
<P>"I believe Seven is correct," Tuvok said as he checked the readings. He had
routed Seven’s scans through his terminal. "The level of radiation and heat
would suggest at least four…perhaps five Extinction Level Events."</P>
<P>"No," Nara said as she saw the data. "Can you get more precise readings?"</P>
<P>"We are still a great distance away," Seven said gently. "Only the Borg
enhancements to the sensors allowed us to get this much information."</P>
<P>"Mister Kim," Tach said quickly. "Can you hail them using frequency 160.95?
It’s the channel of the Stellar Guard."</P>
<P>"Harry, do it. Use a general greeting. Tom, set a course for Nador Omega,
maximum impulse," Janeway said. "Let’s get a closer look."</P>
<P>"Already on it," Tom said as he finished his calculations. "Course set."</P>
<P>"Engage," Janeway said.</P>
<P>"How long before we get there?" Nara asked. She moved to Tach and linked her
arm through his.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Three hours and seventeen minutes," the former Borg responded.</P>
<P>"Harry?" Janeway said, "Any response on that frequency?"</P>
<P>"No, Ma’am," Harry said grimly.</P>
<P>Tach squeezed Nara’s arm, suddenly glad that Ty was in the mess hall with
Samantha and Naomi Wildman. "Try 94.25," Tach said. "It’s a private
channel."</P>
<P>Harry nodded and than then gave Tach a startled glance. "I’m getting
something," Harry said.</P>
<P>"On screen," Janeway said as she faced the viewscreen.</P>
<P>"This is Commander Betoc. Who am I addressing?" A Narian man filled the
screen. His straight black hair was streaked throughout with grey. His eyes were
dark, and deep, and his thick eyebrows were bushy and had almost grown together
in the middle. He looked at the screen, then his eyes widened. "Tach?"</P>
<P>"This is Captain Kathryn Janeway, and yes…Tach is a guest on my ship," she
said. She looked back at Tach and motioned for him to come down to the command
level.</P>
<P>"Betoc, what’s going on?" Tach asked immediately as he came down and stood
next to Commander Chakotay. His years in the Stellar Guard had taught him that
even with an invitation to join the captain on the command deck, that didn’t
mean he should stand in her personal space.</P>
<P>"Tach, thank the goddess you are safe." Betoc ran both hands through his
hair. "We had listed you and Nara as lost."</P>
<P>"What happened?" Janeway asked gently.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, I did not mean to be impolite," Betoc said. "We are dealing
with a planetary catastrophe. We have had multiple meteor strikes and are busy
evacuating our people."</P>
<P>"How bad?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"Level five," Betoc said as his eyes drifted down. "A freighter lost control
and struck the laser cannon at Astgar. We lost the link."</P>
<P>"The other cannons should have compensated," Tach said as he calculated the
damage to the system in question.</P>
<P>"It is Spring Solstice," Betoc said sadly. "There were already three cannons
down for barrel changing."</P>
<P>Janeway turned to Tach, dozens of questions in her blue grey eyes.</P>
<P>"Spring Solstice is the most dangerous time of the year," Tach explained.
"There are more meteors per minute than at any other time. The cannons overheat.
The system can only handle losing any three at one time. If there was a
catastrophic starship impact at one of the net’s key stations that shut it down,
meteors could get through."</P>
<P>Betoc nodded. "And with the electromagnetic pulses from the impacts, we lost
long range communications. We couldn’t call in help from the Stellar Guard. By
the time they returned, it was too late."</P>
<P>Tach’s expression grew dark, and for the first time since Seven had known
him, she saw true pain in his features.</p>
<p>"What does this level of damage
suggest?" Seven asked as she moved toward her friend.</p>
<p>"The carbon dioxide
as well as ash and debris in the atmosphere are at levels intolerable to
habitation," Tach explained grimly. "With levels this high, it will take decades
to repair the damage...and that’s using the most modern terra-forming
techniques."</p>
<p>"We have an even greater problem," Betoc said on the screen.
"The primary targeting array that was damaged... we can’t get it back online
because of the structural damage. The fission reactor is off-line and we don’t
have anyone who can fix it."</p>
<p>"How can that be?" Janeway asked, thinking
that if the Narians built it, they should be able to repair it.</p>
<p>"There
was an engineering conference at Caldori," Betoc said with a grimace. "It is, or
rather was, one of our coastal communities on the Tacarad continent. One of the
larger meteors hit two kilometers off of the coast. The impact caused a sonic
wave that toppled most of the structures even as the steam and vapor cloud came
inland. It vaporized all organic material for 200 kilometers, and then a tidal
wave over 300 meters high hit the coast." He looked away from the screen and
sighed, then turned back. "The wave struck the shore and continued inland over
700 kilometers until it hit the coastal range. There were no
survivors."</p>
<p>"None?" Tach asked as Nara buried her face into his
chest.</p>
<p>"None," Betoc confirmed.</p>
<p>Tach looked over at Janeway. "We
are from the Caldori province. I can make the repairs," Tach said.</p>
<p>"No,"
Nara said as she pulled away from her husband. "With the cannons down, it won’t
be safe. You’re not in the Guard anymore."</p>
<p>"Nara," Tach said gently. "You
know it’s the right thing to do." He turned to the viewscreen. "Have any of the
orbital cannons been hit?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Betoc said. "The array at Lesander
three. One of the meteors got through and hit it. The cannon station was pushed
into the planet’s atmosphere and was vaporized. The remaining cannons are
focusing on the larger meteors, but dozens of smaller meteorites are getting
through and impacting the planet." He rubbed his temples and looked at the
viewscreen. "Tach. If you’re going to help, you must hurry. We haven’t been able
to shut down the remaining cannons for maintenance and they are overheating.
We’ll start losing them within the day."</p>
<p>"What can we do to help?"
Janeway asked.</p>
<p>"It would be most helpful if you could provide cover for
the repair crew," Betoc said. "Our planet will enter the densest meteor belt in
just under 9 hours. With the trajectory we’ve plotted, we expect to lose the
station in the first volley. The cannons have to be online before we reach the
belt."</p>
<p>"I will assist him," Seven said. "I have engineering skills that
will be useful."</p>
<p>"You’re not going with him," Nara snapped. "My
bull-headed husband may fly off into harm’s way, but you two are not going with
him." She pointed at Seven’s belly. "Don’t make me call B’Elanna down in
Engineering."</p>
<p>"Let’s not jump the gun," Janeway said. "We have three
hours before we reach Nador Omega. I’m calling a staff meeting. Betoc, by the
time we reach your location, we will have everything ready."</p>
<p>"Thank you,
Captain Janeway," Betoc said. "I look forward to meeting you in person. May the
goddess guide your journey."</p>
<p>"Thank you" Janeway said.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p>Kathryn Janeway sat at the table in the conference room and watched her
First Officer pace. They were having a last minute discussion before the rest of
the staff arrived.</p>
<p>"We can’t interfere," Chakotay said as he crossed his
arms over his chest. This is a clear violation of the Prime
Directive."</p>
<p>"They are a space fairing race who we’ve already had first
contact with," she countered.</p>
<p>"Contact, yes," he said as he walked over
and stared out the window. "But that doesn’t mean we should go flying in there
and solve all of their problems. We can’t change the course of their natural
history."</p>
<p>"We’ve done it before," she said without getting
up.</p>
<p>"That doesn’t make it right, Kathryn," he said as he rubbed a smudge
on the transparent aluminum. "And you know it."</p>
<p>"They asked for our
help," Janeway said as she stood and went to where he was standing. "That makes
us a part of their history."</p>
<p>Chakotay smiled and turned toward her. "Good
point," he said. It was his job to play Devil’s advocate, but at the moment, he
didn’t like it and was happy to be wrong.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p>The rest of the command staff arrived and sat around the table. Tach and
Nara sat at the far end of the table and helped explain the situation. After
thirty minutes, they had a working plan. Unfortunately, Tach insisted on going
to the station alone.</p>
<p>"That’s insane!" B’Elanna said. "You can’t even do
the repairs by yourself. I’m going with you."</p>
<p>Seven’s eyes widened. "No,"
she said firmly. "I am the logical choice. I am stronger and have more
experience with alien technology."</p>
<p>"No way in hell are you going,"
B’Elanna said. "I forbid it."</p>
<p>The room went dead quiet as the entire
senior staff waited for the explosion. Seven turned to B’Elanna and folded her
willowy arms across her bosom, then raised one eyebrow and tilted her head to
the side.</p>
<p>"I am going," Seven said, not even addressing the fact that her
wife had forbid her action. </P>
<P>B’Elanna saw the edge of Seven’s lip twitch, letting her know that the matter
was not closed.</p>
<p>Janeway cleared her throat. "The last time I checked, I
made the crew assignments on this ship."</p>
<p>Chakotay smirked, not mentioning
that he was in charge of assignments. He figured it was not the time to cut her
off.</p>
<p>"Captain," Tach said quietly. "I am touched by your concern, but
this is my planet’s problem. It is too dangerous to allow any of your crew to
assist. I will fly my ship over and dock with the station and do the
repairs."</p>
<p>"I can’t force you to let us help you," Janeway said as she
leaned forward. "But your chances would be a lot better if you let
us."</p>
<p>"Tach, you are a stubborn ass." B’Elanna stood and went to where he
was sitting and spun him in his chair. "I’m going with you. You need help, and I
am the most qualified. It’s my right."</p>
<p>"Your right?" Tach leaned back
wondering if the Klingon was about to knock some sense into him.</p>
<p>"Yes,
you old goat," B’Elanna said. "You are like a brother to me... a pain in the
ass, obnoxious, condensing, teasing and annoying brother...but a brother none
the less." She smiled down at him. "So I’m going."</p>
<p>Tach was touched, and
looked over at Nara who was trying not to cry, then looked at Seven who was torn
between the touching display and her anger at being overlooked.</p>
<p>"Seven,"
Tach said as he took her by the arm. "I’ll borrow your wife, but I’ll bring her
back. You have my word. I’d take you...but that station is gonna’ be full of
radiation. That’s no place for a baby...even an unborn one."</p>
<p>"That all
right with you, Captain?" B’Elanna asked.</p>
<p>"Let’s get to work," Janeway
said as she stood. "We’ve got a lot to do before we get there."</p>
<P>The staff began to file out of the room, but Janeway stayed behind.
"B’Elanna, Tach, can I talk to you?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Tach said as he
stopped. Nara stopped and waited with him.</p>
<p>"Ma’am?" B’Elanna asked. She
looked over at Seven, who had stopped near the door waiting as
well.</p>
<p>Janeway looked at the two couples, knowing that the spouses had
just as much right to be in the meeting as did Tach and B’Elanna.</p>
<p>"Why
don’t we all have a seat," Janeway said as she pointed at the long table. "Tach,
I want some more information about these meteor storms. Just how many meteors
are we talking about?"</p>
<p>Tach sighed as he sat. "More than I can count," he
said.</p>
<p>"I pulled up the sensor scans," Seven said. "There are hundreds of
meteors that would be impacting if not for the phaser cannons." She accessed her
data padd and put the projections onto the screen for the others to
see.</p>
<p>"Kahless," B’Elanna said as she leaned forward and studied the
image. There were hundreds of streaks slamming toward the planet, most being
destroyed by the remaining phaser cannons. "It’s gonna’ be like flying into a
machine gun barrel! That’s not a meteor shower, it’s a sandstorm with sixty-ton
grains of sand."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you should stay behind," Tach suggested. "I can
try to handle it myself."</p>
<p>"That’s not an option," B’Elanna
said.</p>
<p>"She’s right," Janeway said. "Going alone would guarantee your
failure. What if you took the <I>Delta Flyer</I>? It’s a lot more maneuverable
than your freighter."</p>
<p>"No," Tach said as he pointed to the many meteors.
"My ship has complex programs that let the phasers self-target. If we take your
shuttle, we will have to focus on firing and not the repairs. It would take days
to convert my program to your systems."</p>
<p>"All right," the captain said. "I
don’t like it, but all right. What if I had someone else fly you in there? Keep
a transporter lock on you from the ship? Tom Paris is the best pilot I’ve
got."</p>
<p>Seven looked over at B’Elanna. "He is skilled. He would be the
logical choice," Seven admitted.</p>
<p>"No," Tach said. "The ship is only set
up for two in an emergency, and once we beam onto the station, we’ll need all of
the ship’s energy focused on us."</p>
<p>"Why can’t <I>Voyager</I> beam you
over?" Seven asked. "That would be safer."</p>
<p>"That won’t work," Janeway
said. "We need to keep away from the atmosphere, and we need room to maneuver.
The farther we are from the station, the better chance we have of shooting the
meteors."</p>
<p>"Looks like it’s you and me...brother," B’Elanna said with a
smile.</p>
<p>"We will succeed, Fas’na," Tach said.</p>
<p>"Fas’na?" Seven
asked.</p>
<p>"It means sister," Nara explained. "And since you are family... I
guess Ty will have to get used to calling you Nana. That’s Narian for
aunt."</p>
<p>"Oh no," B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "No way in Hell I am
going to be called... Nana B’Elanna. Forget it. It’s not gonna’
happen."</p>
<p>Seven smiled, but the captain actually laughed. "Well,
Lieutenant, how about Nana Lana?" Janeway asked. She was glad the mood had
lightened.</p>
<p>"No," B’Elanna said. "I’ll be aunt B’Elanna. That’s
final."</p>
<p>"Nana Ba?" Nara asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," B’Elanna said with a
snarl. "Why not just call me Ba Nana."</p>
<p>Janeway covered her mouth and her
eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with that?" Tach asked.</p>
<p>"A Banana is
a terrain fruit," Seven explained.</p>
<p>"So?" Tach asked.</p>
<p>"Hey,
brother," B’Elanna asked him. "Did I ever tell you what Tach means in
Klingonasse?"</p>
<p>"No," he said slowly.</p>
<p>"It means a tavern, a place to
get falling down, stupid drunk." B’Elanna smirked. "And generally, it means a
tavern that isn’t known for its cleanliness."</p>
<p>"Sounds perfect to me,"
Nara said.</p>
<p>"Well," Janeway said, "Nana B’Elanna, why don’t you and Tach
go do a last minute check of his freighter." She stood and looked at the two
couples, hoping they would all be together when the mission at hand was
finished. "I’ll be on the bridge making sure <I>Voyager</I> is ready for our
part in this."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain," Tach said sincerely. "I will do
everything in my power to return B’Elanna safely. You have my
word."</p>
<p>Janeway nodded as she left, her expression confident and full of
trust. Inside she was going over the thousands of the ways that the mission
could go wrong. She knew all too well from personal experience that one’s
intentions to keep someone safe didn’t mean anything to the universe. A meteor
hurling through space didn’t know or care about vows of honor, and faced with a
meteor, Tach’s promise was worthless.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven said their good-byes in the shuttle bay while Nara and Ty
did the same with Tach. Seven was angry with her wife for taking the dangerous
mission, but she understood it, and she wasn’t about to part on negative
terms.</p>
<p>"You will be careful?" Seven asked as she wrapped her arms around
B’Elanna.</p>
<p>"Of course, Be’nal," B’Elanna responded. "I have too much to
come back to. I don’t want you worrying. It’s not good for the little one." She
rested her hand on Seven’s belly and smiled warmly when she felt the child stir.
She bent down and lifted Seven’s shirt and then pressed her lips onto her belly.
After planting a lingering kiss, she eased back and growled onto Seven’s rounded
stomach. The baby began moving immediately in response.</p>
<p>"I will keep us
safe, my wife," Seven said. "You focus on returning. That is an
order."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma’am," B’Elanna said. She smiled and leaned against Seven,
wanting nothing more than to go back to their quarters. "Kiss me?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"Always," Seven replied. She kissed B’Elanna gently, letting her
love envelop the shorter woman and then pulled her tightly against her chest.
They continued the sensual exchange as each woman let her fear fuel the passion.
They broke apart, their breathing raged. "Come back to me and I will finish what
we just started," Seven promised.</P>
<P>"Nothing will stop me," B’Elanna swore.</P>

<P>B’Elanna dropped her hyper-spanner for the third time. "Damn it," she said as
she climbed down to retrieve it. She was in her complete exposure suit, and the
helmet visor kept fogging over. "Tell me again why we need to wear these damn
things? The station’s atmosphere is fine. Environmental controls weren’t
damaged."</P>
<P>"As I told you," Tach said. "When you’ve got that many small chunks of rock
flying at you, you need to be ready." He tightened down a fitting and then
reached over and opened a plasma vent. "Damn," he screamed when the plasma began
leaking immediately. He turned it off and began tightening the fitting
again.</P>
<P>"If one of those things hit us, we’re not gonna’ have to worry about having a
spacesuit," she said as she went back to adjust the plasma matter-stream. "Okay,
I fixed the plasma mix. Any time you’re ready." She looked at him
expectantly.</P>
<P>"A meteor may only pierce the hull," Tach pointed out. "You’ll thank me if we
have a rapid decompression."</P>
<P>"Great," B’Elanna said with a sigh. "Did I mention that Klingons don’t do
well in zero G?"</P>
<P>"As your wife is so fond of saying, you will adapt," Tach said as he opened
the vent. "There," he said with a smile. "Now, let’s get down to the reactor and
see if we can reactivate it."</P>
<P>"I can’t believe I’m taking orders from a farmer," B’Elanna said as she
followed him out of the small corridor.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven of Nine stood at the auxiliary tactical station, ready to target any
meteors that Tuvok or Harry might miss. She wasn’t enjoying the fact that her
wife was out in the middle of the storm. Hundreds of meteorites of every size
filled the surrounding space. With B’Elanna and Tach already docked at the space
station, Tuvok had taken over the responsibility of covering it. His fingers
flew furiously over his comm panel as he tried to keep one step ahead of the
projectiles.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p><I>Voyager</I> had turned and was facing into the meteor storm, targeting
the deadly chunks of rock as they headed for the planet or the station. The
Stellar Guard had a squadron of fighters that were taking out as many of the
larger meteors as possible. The fighters had the advantage of using Narian
targeting array. Their complex systems were centrally controlled and the Narian
command had already plotted the trajectories of the largest meteors, so they
knew which would definitely hit the planet. Those were targeted and marked on
the fighter’s targeting array. The pilots would take turns flying out to
intercept those massive targets and break them up. The problem then became
recalculating the trajectories of the broken pieces.</P>
<P>"Mister Kim," Tuvok said, his voice almost sounding alarmed. "Incoming
meteors at 123 mark 214. I will take the larger one," he said even as he was
firing.</P>
<P>"Got it," Harry responded, though his eyes grew wide when he saw the size of
the targets. "Why didn’t the Stellar Guard take these out?" </P>
<P>The phasers fired and the huge chunks of rock shattered, sending smaller
pieces directly for <I>Voyager</I>. The debris filled the viewscreen.</P>
<P>Janeway stood, keeping one hand on her command chair. "All available power to
the main deflector. Keep firing. We can’t let those pieces get past us," she
barked. She knew that Tach and B’Elanna were counting on <I>Voyager</I> to keep
the incoming meteorites at bay until they completed their repairs.</P>
<P>"There are so many," Harry said as he kept re-targeting.</P>
<P>"The Stellar Guard are handling the biggest meteors, and they are not
bothering with the ones that won’t hit the planet." Seven looked up from her
comm panel. "Mister Kim, you just destroyed a target that would have passed us
without harm."</P>
<P>"How am I supposed to know that?" Harry asked as he kept firing.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said. She input a few more commands and then sent a new set
of data to all of the comm panels. On the main viewscreen, a green grid
criss-crossed the image. Suddenly each meteor hurling toward them had a
color-coded tracking mark beside it. "Fire on the meteors marked with red,"
Seven ordered. </P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven." Janeway stared at the screen, impressed with the complex
tracking system. It reminded her of a Starfleet war room with different markers
for ships from different alliances, though Seven’s program looked more
intricate. She realized that Seven must be plotting hundreds of courses of the
meteors and then manually updating the screen.<BR><BR>Seven nodded. "The yellow
targets are ones in danger of being pushed into the planet or the station by the
explosions. Be aware that they may change to red at any time." She glanced back
down at her console. She had divided it into two data streams. One gave her an
update on the meteors, and the other was from the scanners facing the small
space station. She had a constant image of Tach’s ship docked off of the port
side of the battered phaser cannon array. Tach’s ship was firing automatically,
keeping the stray debris from hitting the structure.</P>
<P>"Impressive," Tuvok said as he concentrated his firing on the new red
targets. A large explosion rocked the ship as debris hit the deflector grid.
Tuvok grabbed the console and kept firing.</P>
<P>"Tom," Janeway said as she sat back down. "Keep a course locked in to get us
out of here. I want you ready to move us the other side of the planet as soon as
Tach and B’Elanna are out of there."</P>
<P>"Gladly," Tom said as he double-checked the escape route he had already
plotted. "What’s taking them so long?"</P>
<P>Seven’s head snapped up. "The station was badly damaged when the ship
collided with it. Since that impact, dozen of small meteors have hit it as
well," Seven said defensively. She didn’t like Paris questioning her wife’s
efficiency, although she did wish that B’Elanna would finish soon.</P>
<P>"Captain," Harry said, he was smiling, impressed by a massive meteor he had
just destroyed. "Maybe I can knock a few of these out of our way before they get
so close." He held onto his console as the fragments hit the shields and shook
<I>Voyager</I>. "I’m firing on the three largest red targets that just came on
screen." He pushed the comm panel as he spoke. "The photon torpedoes should do
the trick."</P>
<P>"Harry, no." Janeway stood and spun. "Belay that," she glared at him and his
face went pale.</P>
<P>"I just fired," Harry said.</P>
<P>"Tuvok," Janeway yelled as she trotted up to the tactical level.</P>
<P>"I am attempting to disarm the torpedoes." Tuvok had to shift his focus back
to his targeting as a small meteor hit <I>Voyager’s</I> shields, knocking the
ship to one side.</P>
<P>"Hurry," Seven said as she tried to disarm it from her station.</P>
<P>"What?" Harry asked. </P>
<P>"Captain…" Tuvok nodded toward the screen. The largest meteor in the distance
exploded when the torpedo hit, shattering into three huge chunks that flew off
into different directions. The pieces bumped into other meteors, setting off a
chain of events like a cue ball breaking a freshly racked set of billiard balls.
Suddenly dozens of the yellow targets changed to red.</P>
<P>"Oh, god," Harry whispered. </P>
<P>Another torpedo exploded, it shattered the next meteor sending hundreds of
shards in every direction, and the explosion ignited some of the pieces. It
would have been beautiful, like fireworks on a hot July night, except these
fireworks were heading straight for <I>Voyager</I>. </P>
<P>"Brace for impact," Janeway said just as the shards hit the shields. It
sounded like water thrown into a white-hot frying pan as the meteors scattered
across the shields. "What was that?" the captain asked just as the third torpedo
hit and broke another giant meteor in half. </P>
<P>"The second meteor had a less dense construction," Seven answered as she
continued both of her scans. "It had hundreds of caverns, all filled with
hydrogen gas. The matrix of the cavern system was laced with tri-lithium and
duranium." Seven’s eyes widened. "We must warn the station," she said even as
she accessed the communications system.</P>
<P>"What? Why?" Harry asked while he tried shooting the new red targets.</P>
<P>"Janeway to Torres, get out of there, now. You’ve got hundreds of tiny
fragments headed your way and they’re made of tri-lithium and duranium. They’ll
get right past Tach’s targeting cannons and cut through your hull like hot
butter." Kathryn moved next to Seven and watched as the massive cloud of
projectiles neared the station.</P><I>
<P>*"Torres here, Captain…we’re almost done. Can you buy us ten more
minutes?"*</I> B’Elanna asked over the comm.</P>
<P>"Get out of there, now," Janeway ordered.</P><I>
<P>*"Aye, Captain,"*</I> B’Elanna said, but her tone suggested she was not happy
about it.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tom Paris yelled. "We need to get out of here too."</P>
<P>Janeway turned and saw half of the last broken meteor. It was heading for
<I>Voyager</I>, closing fast. "Hold your ground, Ensign," she ordered. She
looked over at Tuvok and he gave her a subtle shake of his head. "Harry, you
focus everything we’ve got on that… that thing. Tuvok, see if you can pick off
some of those smaller pieces heading for the station." She took a breath as her
crew jumped into action. "Tom, you keep us nose to nose with that thing until
the last second. We need to break it up. It’s an ELE," she added, reminding
everyone that if it hit the planet it would cause another Extinction Level
Event.</P>
<P>"No," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>Janeway looked down at her console as the station was peppered with impacts
and the surrounding space began filling with a white vapor as the phaser cannon
array lost its atmosphere.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Come on, Tach… move it," B’Elanna yelled as she ran toward the docking bay.
He was in front of her and she was pushing him every time he would pause. His
bulky spacesuit made him look like an overweight targh as he quickly waddled
through the station.</P>
<P>"What if we use the phaser cannons and target manually?" he asked as he
stopped to catch his breath. B’Elanna slammed into to him. Her facemask had long
since fogged over.</P>
<P>"Move," she ordered, taking him by the arm and tugging him. "Janeway doesn’t
back down easily. If she said we need to get out of here, then we do." She
trotted a few more steps, pulling him with her. "How soon can we use the
transporter?" she asked.</P>
<P>"As soon as we clear the reactor’s radiation shielding…at the end of the
corridor," he said.</P>
<P>A deafening hiss made them both stop, they looked at each other, and for a
split second nothing happened. A loud explosion replaced the hissing and they
both flew through the air. They were being forcefully sucked toward the
corridor. </P>
<P>"Hull breach," Tach screamed over the noise. He grabbed his belt, pulling off
a cable with a clamp and hooked it to a loop on B’Elanna’s waist. He took a
small pistol from his opposite hip and fired at one of the walls as they were
carried past. A duranium arrowhead with an attached cable plunged into one of
the bulkheads and the cable quickly went taut, yanking B’Elanna and Tach to a
stop. They swayed from side to side as the air was drawn out past them. After
several minutes, they both bobbed above the decking. The station was completely
silent. </P>
<P>"Kahless," B’Elanna said as she activated her magnetic boots. She stood in
the gravity free environment as Tach did the same.</P>
<P>"What do you think of these suits now?" Tach asked. He unsnapped the cable
from the wall but left the one tethering him to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I’ll tell you when we get back on board <I>Voyager</I>," she said. "Come on,
we’re almost out of the shielded area."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway saw the vapor filling the space around the station and she knew what
it meant. "Janeway to Torres, come in," she said calmly, but inside her heart
was pounding. She waited, idly listening to the sound of fingers dancing over
consoles as the crew continued firing. She glanced down at Tom Paris. He was
moving <I>Voyager</I> in reverse, giving them a little more time to attack the
giant meteor as it hurled toward them. It was also moving them closer to the
station and the atmosphere. "Janeway to Torres," she repeated. There was still
no answer. </P>
<P>Seven was tired of waiting patiently. She slapped her comm badge. "Seven of
Nine to Torres, come in…now." Only silence answered.</P>
<P>"They may be somewhere a signal can’t get through," Janeway said. "Was Tach
wearing a comm badge?"</P>
<P>"I…do not know," Seven said. She felt like she was failing her wife by not
having all of the relevant information.</P>
<P>"Janeway to Tach, come in," she said.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said calmly. "On screen."</P>
<P>Janeway and Seven turned to see the meteor glowing red in the center and then
it broke with a massive explosion that knocked Tuvok, Janeway and Kim to the
floor. Seven remained standing, but her console had deep dent where her Borg
enhanced left hand had crushed it as she held on.</P>
<P>"Well?" the captain demanded as she climbed to her feet. She stared at the
screen as the fiery explosion began to die down. Tiny pieces of rock began
hitting the shields and then the smoke and flame was gone and they could see
what was left of the projectile. The explosion had torn off three smaller pieces
that were flying in the opposite direction. The remaining chunk was closing on
<I>Voyager</I>.</P>
<P>"Captain?" Paris asked from the helm.</P>
<P>"Steady, Mister Paris," Janeway answered. "Shields to maximum," she ordered
as she went to the helm. She knelt next to him and began altering the ship’s
course.</P>
<P>"Ma’am?" Paris asked, his voice cracking. "We’re still in that thing’s
path."</P>
<P>"I know that, Mister Paris," Janeway said without looking up. "We just need
to alter its trajectory a tiny bit."</P>
<P>"Captain," Seven said from her post, "This ship, even with shields at
maximum, will not alter its course. The shields will buckle a nanosecond before
the hull implodes."</P>
<P>"Steady," Janeway said to Paris as he moved in his chair. "Get ready to pivot
us as the meteor gets closer. Try to match its speed," she added. "Once we are
touching, we’ll just give it a little nudge."</P>
<P>"Ma’am," Tom said slowly. "That thing you want to nudge is twenty times
<I>Voyager’s</I> size."</P>
<P>"Twenty six," Tuvok corrected.</P>
<P>"Just what I needed to hear," Paris said. The meteor filled the screen as it
rushed closer. Tom managed to get the ship’s shields within a few meters of the
projectile and he matched its speed, hovering just off of its edge. He gave
Janeway one last questioning glance, then let the shields nudge the huge rock.
The entire ship rocked and the engines began to whine as Tom followed the
captain’s orders and tried to push the meteor. The whine from the engines
increased and Tom wished B’Elanna was in Engineering; she could always get the
warp core to give a little more power than Starfleet engineers had ever
intended.</P>
<P>Seven continued hailing both Torres and Tach. Her scans showed nothing
because the tri-lithium particles scattered around the station had blocked out
all of the readings.</P><I>
<P>*"Vorik to the bridge… We have lost two power conduits and the engines are
overheating,"*</I> the Vulcan said over the comm. </P>
<P>"The meteor’s trajectory is unchanged," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Vorik, get repair teams on it, Janeway out," the captain said. "All right,
Tom, back us off." She turned and faced the officers at the back of the bridge.
"Seven, check that thing for structural integrity. Are there any weak
spots?"</P>
<P>Seven quickly re-scanned the meteor. "Yes, there is a fissure near the center
of the last explosion. The resulting crater has a deep crack that continues into
the interior."</P>
<P>"Tuvok, I want one torpedo, minimum yield. Put it right into that fissure,"
Janeway said.</P>
<P>"I might point out that a torpedo is exactly what caused this," Tuvok said
while he targeted the crater.</P>
<P>"I know," Janeway said. "But this thing wasn’t even going to hit the planet
until we interfered. I am not going to stand by and watch an ELE hit their
planet when we can at least break it up."</P>
<P>"Torpedo ready," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Fire." Janeway sat in her chair and waited as the torpedo went to the meteor
in a lazy arc. There was small explosion and then the huge rock seemed to
vibrate and then split into a several smaller pieces. "Target those," Janeway
ordered. One piece was bigger than the rest and it headed directly for
<I>Voyager</I>. "Tom," Janeway said harshly.</P>
<P>"Got it," Tom responded as he spun <I>Voyager</I> out of the way. He wasn’t
quite fast enough and the meteor bumped the ship. </P>
<P>"Shields are failing on decks four through nine," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Captain," Seven yelled as she stared down at her console. "The station."</P>
<P>"On screen," Janeway said. The rear view filled the screen as the largest
chunk of the meteor that had hit <I>Voyager</I> continued on toward the station.
It dwarfed the station, and continued directly toward it. "Janeway to Torres,
come in." She watched in horror as the meteor hit the station and Tach’s ship
along with it. The station and ship were crumpled like discarded paper cups,
collapsing on impact. There was a small explosion as Tach’s fuel tanks ruptured
when the meteor continued into the atmosphere taking the wreckage with it. It
glowed bright red, then white, before becoming engulfed in flame, the whole
thing taking only a few seconds.</P>
<P>Tuvok looked up as the ship was rocked by a small meteor hitting the shields.
"I suggest a hasty retreat," he said quietly.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She scanned the surrounding space. "We must find Lana," she
insisted. Her hands flew over the controls as she tried different methods of
scanning. Each one showed nothing but she blamed the tri-lithium. "We will find
them," she insisted.</P>
<P>"Tom…" Janeway put her hand on his shoulder. "Take us to the other side of
the planet."</P>
<P>Tom could not answer, so he nodded. He keyed in the commands and the ship
moved quickly toward the opposite side of the planet and the safety it offered.
With the planet between <I>Voyager</I> and the meteor storm, they would be as
safe as possible.</P>
<P>"I will find them," Seven said quietly as she tried modulating the scanners.
"They may have used escape pods." She noticed her vision was narrowing, she
could only see the tiny area of her console, and everything else was black. She
felt a warm touch on her arm but didn’t look up.</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway said gently. "Come on, I think you and I should have a talk
in my ready room."</P>
<P>"After I locate B’Elanna and Tach," Seven said. "I must continuing scanning."
</P>
<P>"I will continue scanning," Tuvok offered from his post. </P>
<P>Seven glanced over at the Vulcan and considered his offer. "Very well, but
contact me when you find her," she finally said.</P>
<P>"Come on," Kathryn said as she wrapped her arm around Seven’s waist. The tall
blonde hesitated before slowly moving toward the ready room. Janeway looked back
at Harry who seemed dazed as well. "Mister Kim, contact Chakotay in Engineering
and have him report to the bridge. Until then, you have the bridge." </P>
<P>"Aye, Ma’am." Harry stared at Seven. He had never seen her look so completely
lost.</P>
<P>"Easy," Kathryn said when Seven stumbled. "I’ve got you."</P>
<P>"Do not tell B’Elanna I tripped," Seven said as she leaned onto Kathryn for
support. "I am always teasing her about being clumsy. She would enjoy returning
the favor."</P>
<P>Kathryn led Seven into the ready room and guided her to the couch. "Sit,"
Kathryn ordered.</P>
<P>"I should be helping to find B’Elanna." Seven sank into the soft cushions of
the couch.</P>
<P>"Seven," Kathryn said as she sat next to her friend. "You will get through
this. You have so many friends on board. You don’t have to do this alone. We’re
here for you." She reached out and took Seven’s delicate hand. "I’m here for
you."</P>
<P>"I am never alone," Seven pointed out as she looked into Kathryn’s eyes. "I
have B’Elanna."</P>
<P>Kathryn took a deep breath and sighed. There were parts of her job that she
truly hated. "Seven, you saw the station… you know B’Elanna’s not coming
back."</P>
<P>"You are wrong," Seven yelled and jumped to her feet. "You cannot give up on
her. She is not… gone. She promised me that she would come back. B’Elanna would
never break a promise to me."</P>
<P>"She didn’t mean to," Kathryn said as she stood. "It was an accident."
Kathryn tried to take Seven’s hand, but the exdrone yanked it away.</P>
<P>"I am her wife… she would not lie to me," Seven yelled. Her eyes began to
shine as tears formed but refused to fall.</P>
<P>"She didn’t lie… she just made a mistake," Kathryn said quietly. "I never
should have let her go."</P>
<P>"You could not have stopped her," Seven whispered as tears began sliding down
her cheeks. "Please, leave me alone," she requested. "I do not wish to have you
see me like this," she added as her hands began to shake.</P>
<P>"You shouldn’t be alone right now." Kathryn tried to put her hand on Seven’s
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Leave," Seven yelled. Her eyes were wild and feral and she clinched her
hands into tight fists until her knuckles turned white.</P>
<P>"All right," Kathryn said slowly, "But I’ll be right outside if you need
me."</P>
<P>"Go," Seven said huskily.</P>
<P>"I’ll be back in ten minutes to check on you," Janeway said as she paused
near the door. "You aren’t going to do anything…"</P>
<P>"I will not harm myself," Seven said quietly. "I would never harm our
child."</P>
<P>"Call me if you need anything." Kathryn opened the door and left Seven
alone.</P>
<P>"I need my Be’nal," Seven whispered as the door hissed shut.</P>
