<P>B’Elanna looked up at the finished roof and stretched her back.
"<I>Well,"</I> she thought, "<I>if I can’t get back to Voyager, maybe I’ll have
a career as a roofer." </I>She rubbed her shoulder, trying to work out the knot
that had been there for the past two days. She wondered what was taking Seven so
long; she had left over a half-hour earlier to get fresh water. The lake was
only five minutes away.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Seven whispered as she came running up the path from the
lake.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Torres turned and saw that Seven didn’t have any of the water
containers she had left with.</P>
<P>"There are large beasts at the lake, and they are coming this way," Seven
said as she reached B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Beasts?" B’Elanna didn’t like the sound of that.</P>
<P>"Large creatures, two meters at the shoulder and covered with thick fur. And
they have large horns." Seven’s eyes darted around the camp area looking for
some kind of weapon.</P>
<P>"Oh great," B’Elanna said as she dragged Seven toward the cabin. "Just what
we need, company." She pushed Seven inside and then stood in the doorway.</P>
<P>"We should seal the door. If the creatures see us they will attack the
structure." Seven paced the small room.</P>
<P>"Shhh," Torres said as she looked toward the lake. "Something’s coming." She
watched as the trees along the path shook and a low rumbling sound proceeded
whatever was heading toward the camp.</P>
<P>A large black animal came into view, followed by three white ones. They were
four legged animals, slightly larger than Bison from ancient earth. B’Elanna
studied them as they meandered up the path. Several more broke through the
treeline and wandered around the camp before stopping to graze on the tender
shoots of grass under the trees.</P>
<P>"Get back," Seven whispered. "They are formidable predators. Did you see
their horns?"</P>
<P>Torres smiled and looked out at the grazing animals. They had three horns
down the center of their foreheads, the largest on top and the smallest on the
bottom between the eyes.</P>
<P>"Those are not predators," B’Elanna said as she continued watching the
animals.</P>
<P>"What are they?" Seven asked as she edged toward the door. As a Borg drone
she had little experience with large animals and found them somewhat
intimidating.</P>
<P>"Dinner," Torres said with a feral smile.</P>
<P>"You cannot be serious. Those creatures will eat you alive." Seven pulled
B’Elanna away from the door.</P>
<P>"Seven, those things don’t eat meat. They’re giant cows. You’re looking at a
ton of hamburger on the hoof," B’Elanna said, remembering that Seven had
actually enjoyed Neelix’s version of grilled burgers during <I>Voyager’s</I>
summer barbecue.</P>
<P>"And how do you plan on killing it?" Seven demanded. "Simply walk up to it
and ask it to jump onto a bun?"</P>
<P>"Uhh," B’Elanna looked out at the animals. They moved slowly around the camp,
chewing lazily on the grass looking very much like cows, but their size was
intimidating.</P>
<P>"I see," Seven said and crossed her arms over her chest triumphantly. "Shall
I get the buns?"</P>
<P>"Oh, shut up." Torres flopped onto the floor. She reached over and pulled a
piece of scrap metal over to her and began studying it.</P>
<P>Seven peeked out the door at the ‘cows’ and studied them. Once she knew that
they wouldn’t devour her, she was curious about them. There were at least thirty
of them around the cabin now, in many different shades from black to a creamy
white. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Seven whispered, waving her hand to draw Torres over to the
door.</P>
<P>"Seven, can’t you just call me B’Elanna? It’s not like we have a command
structure here," she said as she turned the metal over in her hand.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, come here."</P>
<P>"Fine," Torres said with a sigh and stood. "What is it?"</P>
<P>"There are offspring." Seven pointed at a group of young calves frolicking
around the larger cows. One was a pale reddish blonde and its horns were just
beginning to sprout. "That one resembles Naomi Wildman," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Hey, I could take one of those down with a crude knife," Torres said.</P>
<P>Seven was mortified. "You wouldn’t."</P>
<P>Torres looked at Seven’s horrified face. "Oh, all right. I won’t kill the one
that looks like Naomi, but we need food, and I call this a nice delivery
service."</P>
<P>"Are you certain we must kill them?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Seven, <I>Voyager</I> should have found us by now." Torres stared out at the
herd of animals as she spoke. "We’ve been here almost two weeks, and I don’t
know how much longer the ship will stay around to look for us."</P>
<P>"I have thought of that," Seven said quietly. "Perhaps we should prepare meat
for long term storage."</P>
<P>"I figure we can dry whatever we can’t eat right away," B’Elanna said. "We’ll
put it that large storage area at the back of the cabin. It would help if we had
some dried nuts and grains, too." B’Elanna held the piece of metal out to Seven.
"Think you could use that Borg tubule drill of yours to hone an edge on this for
me?"</P>
<P>Seven took the metal and turned it over slowly. "I believe so, however there
are other alloys at the shuttle that would be more effective. The hull plating
at the front of the shuttle is duranium. It is much harder and will hold a sharp
edge longer. Also, it will be less likely to break off should it strike
bone."</P>
<P>"Can your tubules cut duranium?"</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said.</P>
<P>"You’re just a regular Swiss Army knife." B’Elanna stood and wandered the
small room.</P>
<P>Seven wasn’t sure what the reference meant, but thought it was a compliment.
"If you mount a duranium point on a spear, you would have a weapon that could
bring down one of the cows."</P>
<P>"I’ll do it. I’ll go out as soon as we have the spears made, and when I… when
I’ve finished, you can help me bring the meat back." </P>
<P>"Is it safe?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Hey, it’s a cow. I’m a Klingon warrior. Do the math."</P>
<P>"Indeed. Perhaps I should accompany you," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"What? And have you naming the rest of the herd? I’ll be fine," B’Elanna
promised. "Maybe you can take the tricorder and find some edible nuts and
fruits."</P>
<P>Seven didn’t seem convinced, but then nodded. "I will give you four hours and
then I will come find you."</P>
<P>"Eight," Torres said.</P>
<P>"Six," Seven countered.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said and then wondered how in the world she was going to
bring down one of the giant animals.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna left the next morning at first light armed with four duranium
spears. She followed the wide path left by the herd and tracked them to a huge
meadow a kilometer from the cabin site. She watched the animals for quite a
while before deciding on a small male that had moved off to a stream to get a
drink. Her first throw hit its mark, cutting through his ribcage and bringing
him down to his knees. She rushed the beast and used a long dagger to slit its
throat and quickly ended its suffering. Seven had surprised B’Elanna with the
dagger the night before. It was an amazing piece of cutlery, the blade as long
as B’Elanna’s forearm, and honed to a razor sharp edge. Any Klingon warrior
would have been proud to carry the blade, and B’Elanna noticed that Seven had
taken the time to carve Klingon symbols into the hardwood handle. The handle was
perfectly balanced and fit B’Elanna’s hand as if she had been born with it. It
was a touching and useful gift, one B’Elanna already cherished. </P>
<P>As she skinned the animal she thought of Seven and how much she had opened up
in the few short weeks. Torres wondered why she had never taken the time on
board <I>Voyager</I> to get to know the complex and beautiful woman.
"<I>Beautiful</I>?" she thought. <I>"Man, I’ve got it bad. I’m gutting an six
hundred pound steer and thinking how beautiful Seven is."</I> She wondered if
her attraction to her companion was obvious, and more importantly, she wondered
if Seven was getting over Captain Janeway.</P>
<P>B’Elanna cut the animal into manageable chunks and then wrapped most of the
meat in the hide. She used some fiber optic cables she had salvaged from the
shuttle to hoist it into a tall tree and out of any scavenger’s path and then
headed back to the cabin with as much meat as she could carry.</P>
<P>She reached camp and was surprised to find Seven still gone. Apparently she
was still out collecting nuts and berries so B’Elanna began cooking a large
piece of meat and smoking the rest. After another three hours, she was beginning
to worry. B’Elanna was torn between being furious and being terrified. She was
pacing when the door to the cabin opened.</P>
<P>"Where have you been?" B’Elanna yelled before the door was even halfway open.
"You scared…" the words froze on her lips when she saw Seven. The blonde was
paler than she had ever seen her and covered in blood.</P>
<P>"I found a predator," Seven said and then collapsed onto her knees. Her
biosuit was torn across the chest with blood seeping through the material. Her
leg had a deep gash and was leaving a trail of blood across the floor.</P>
<P>"Oh, my god." B’Elanna grabbed her and eased to onto the floor. "Where’s the
medical kit?"</P>
<P>Seven looked up at Torres with glazed over eyes. "You are beautiful."</P>
<P>"Yeah, thanks, but where’s the medical kit?" she asked as she tore the
damaged material away. She scanned the room and saw the kit and quickly
retrieved it. "Hold on, Seven. What the hell did you run into?"</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes rolled back into her head and she moaned, struggling to stay
conscious. "It was not a cow," Seven finally said.</P>
<P>"I never should have sent you out alone. This is all my fault." B’Elanna
studied the deep wounds and gave Seven a painkiller, then began gently cleaning
them. "I’m gonna’ have to used the muscular regenerator before I can heal the
skin surface. Hold on."</P>
<P>"It is not your fault. Did you get a cow for dinner?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah, I got a cow. Now if you just hang on, and I’ll cook you up a nice
steak for dinner." Torres frowned when she saw how deep the gash in Seven’s leg
was. The slice reached down to the bone. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, the creature may have followed me." Seven tried to sit up, but
fell back, the painkiller making her dizzy.</P>
<P>"Hold still. Unless you want one leg shorter than the other," Torres said as
she mended the wound. "I’ll take care of whatever did this to you." Inside she
was seething. Whatever had injured Seven was going to die at the end of the
blade Seven had given her the night before.</P>
<P>"Big," Seven whispered, "with… sharp teeth." She passed out.</P>
<P>Torres sighed and finished healing Seven’s wounds. "At least you won’t have
to feel this. Damn it, Seven. You went out to get nuts and berries; leave it you
to hunt down something big with teeth."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two hours later Seven woke up alone in the cabin. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" She eased herself up and noticed that her biosuit was in shreds.
She stood and walked unsteadily to the door but before she could reach it, it
swung open.</P>
<P>"Seven, how are you feeling?" Torres moved into the room; her arms were
covered in blood, but she appeared to be uninjured.</P>
<P>"Where have you been?" Seven stared at the blood soaked fabric of B’Elanna’s
pants.</P>
<P>"That thing won’t ever hurt you again." B’Elanna went to the small cooking
area and took the pot of hot water off of the fire and began washing her
arms.</P>
<P>"You killed it?" Seven demanded.</P>
<P>"Damn right, I killed it. Used that knife you gave me," Torres smiled up at
Seven who was standing next to her.</P>
<P>"You could have been damaged." Seven grabbed her and began looking for any
sign of injury.</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said with a smile. She picked a piece of flesh off of
her arm and flicked it into the fire. "Yuck."</P>
<P>Seven pulled B’Elanna into a tight embrace. "Do not ever do that again. I
could not… if anything had happened to you…"</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said, but she didn’t pull away. She actually enjoyed the
closeness, and wondered if perhaps Seven returned her blossoming feelings.
"Shh," she whispered as she pulled back and looked at Seven.</P>
<P>Seven reached out and gently touched B’Elanna’s cheek. "B’Elanna?" she
whispered.</P>
<P>"Yes?" B’Elanna answered, her throat gone dry.</P>
<P>"I, may I? Can I…" Seven leaned down until her lips were almost touching
B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"What?" Torres asked in a husky whisper. She was keenly aware of the feeling
of Seven’s body pressed against her, the softness of their breasts molding
together, the strength in the arms enfolding her.</P>
<P>Seven let her lips touch B’Elanna’s instead of answering her. It was a timid,
tentative kiss, but she followed it up with a more aggressive touch, this time
letting her tongue ease out and flicker across B’Elanna’s mouth. B’Elanna moaned
and pulled Seven closer to her and deepened the kiss. She opened her mouth and
welcomed Seven’s exploring tongue. Finally Seven pulled back and gave B’Elanna
an angry glare.</P>
<P>"Don’t ever risk your life like that again," Seven said, but the effect of
her words was greatly diminished by her hands roaming seductively down
B’Elanna’s back.</P>
<P>"I won’t," B’Elanna promised and leaned in for another kiss. After several
long, leisurely kisses, the half-Klingon pulled back again. "Wow."</P>
<P>"Wow, indeed," Seven said and then smiled. Her hands were still moving across
B’Elanna’s back, learning every curve and nuance. </P>
<P>"I, didn’t know you felt, umm, felt the same way I do." B’Elanna reached up
and pushed a strand of hair out of Seven’s eyes.</P>
<P>Seven pinned B’Elanna in her gaze. "B’Elanna, I believe I am beginning to
falling in love with you." Her blue eyes were pale as ice, and showed the
anxiety she was feeling.</P>
<P>"I think I am, too." B’Elanna cleared her throat. "I never expected
this."</P>
<P>"Is it an unwelcome discovery?" Seven asked quietly.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. "It’s a very welcome discovery. I just don’t know where
we should go from here."</P>
<P>"Perhaps we should…make love," Seven said and smiled coyly at the
half-Klingon.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and eased away from the tall blonde. "I don’t think we
should move quite that fast." She studied Seven, wondering what possessed her to
suggest taking things slowly. B’Elanna couldn’t deny the obvious attraction she
felt for Seven.</P>
<P>Seven stuck out her bottom lip and looked like Naomi Wildman when she was
pouting. "How fast should we move?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked at Seven and shook her head. She couldn’t believe how cute
Seven was when she didn’t get her way, and only a few weeks earlier she couldn’t
stand being in the same room with the woman. Perhaps the sparks between them had
always been from repressed attraction. She knew that was how she and Tom Paris
had initially interacted.</P>
<P>"Seven, have you ever been with anyone?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "But I am open to new experiences." </P>
<P>"You said you were beginning to fall in love with me, right?" "B’Elanna moved
back toward the cabin door with Seven on her heels.</P>
<P>"Yes." </P>
<P>"Well, your first time should be with someone you <I>are</I> in love with.
Someone who loves you too." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and kissed her knuckles.
"Let’s see where things go, okay?"</P>
<P>"All right," Seven said and smiled at the way B’Elanna continued to kiss her
knuckles.</P>
<P>"Now, we’ve got a giant cow to drag back here and smoke, and a big toothy
<I>whatever</I> to deal with down by the lake. I think it’s some kind of bear,
but I’ve never seen one with claws that long." She tugged Seven’s hand and
pulled her out the door. "You up to walking?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. "I have recovered and can assist in the retrieval of the
meat." She walked alongside B’Elanna, not releasing her hand until they reached
the spears lying against a tree. </P>
<P>"Here." B’Elanna handed her one of the longer spears. "Keep your eyes open in
case that bear thing has family."</P>

</table>

<P>Two months passed, and B’Elanna and Seven fell into a familiar routine. They
woke up with the sun and had breakfast together, talking about their thoughts
about dozens of topics. B’Elanna would go out and hunt for game, usually small
rabbit-like animals that had tiny round ears and long hind legs. They would eat
the rabbits as fresh meat, and about once every two weeks B’Elanna would hike
out to the meadow to take down one of the ‘cows.’ The herd had stayed away from
the cabin once they discovered the two humanoids were predators, but there were
six large herds that roamed the valley. All of them came down each morning to
drink from the lake and graze in the huge meadow. B’Elanna would kill and dress
the animal and then Seven would come to help her bring the meat back. It took
almost an entire week to dry the meat and even longer to tan the hide, but most
of the labor involved slicing the meat and hanging it. After that, they only had
to turn the meat while it smoked in the large shack that B’Elanna had built just
for curing the meat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven spent the early mornings collecting nuts and working with the various
barleys and wheats she had harvested from the surrounding valley. She was using
her own nanoprobes to bio-engineer a hardier plant with a fast rate of maturity,
unfortunately, it still took far too long for her. In the afternoon, Seven would
spend a few hours regenerating with the modified power converter. The solar
panel didn’t provide as much energy as her alcove on board <I>Voyager </I>had,
but it also didn’t have to power a comm station and a full database like her
station on the ship had. She was taking in more and more energy from food, and
the regeneration only had to power her Borg implants, but B’Elanna still checked
the power converter everyday to make sure it was working at peak efficiency. The
Klingon also made a point of finding something to do at the Homestead while
Seven was regenerating. She was never more than ten feet away from her companion
while she was unconscious during the process. Even though they had set up the
small device inside the cabin near the hearth, she wasn’t going to risk Seven
being attacked.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Each day the two women grew closer, they had not moved into a sexual
relationship yet they had become increasingly more comfortable with each other.
B’Elanna had never considered herself an overly affectionate person, but she
found herself drawn to Seven in a way that was completely new. Anytime she was
around the lanky blonde she felt the need to touch her. Seven seemed to feel the
same way, constantly touching B’Elanna’s waist when she eased past her in the
confines of the cabin, or just wrapping her arms around her from behind when
they would watch the sun set. B’Elanna felt cherished, and it was a new and
welcome feeling, one she never had the entire time she had dated Tom.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Seven said as she came out of the cabin. She walked over and
sat next to B’Elanna on the long bench they had set up looking out over the
valley. Their bodies seemed drawn together, Seven’s leg pressing against
B’Elanna’s as soon as she relaxed.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is," B’Elanna said and leaned against her companion. </P>
<P>Seven wrapped her arm around B’Elanna and leaned over and kissed her temple.
"Are you going hunting?" </P>
<P>"I was thinking about taking a day off." B’Elanna snuggled into the embrace
and ran her hand over Seven’s top. It was made of leather from one of the cows,
the golden colored suede a pleasant contrast to Seven’s pale skin that peeked
through the leather laced opening. Seven’s biosuit had not survived her
encounter with the large bear.</P>
<P>"I have been perfecting the barley," Seven said. "I believe I have solved the
problem of the extended growing season. Perhaps you would like to assist me?"
Seven asked. The truth was that she loved spending time with B’Elanna no matter
what they were doing.</P>
<P>"I’d like that," B’Elanna said and then kissed Seven on the cheek. "Maybe
later we can go on a picnic."</P>
<P>"Acceptable." Seven blushed, something B’Elanna found endearing. "I have
altered the dermal regenerator, I think I may be able to use it to accelerate
the growth of the barley."</P>
<P>"Really?" B’Elanna thought the idea was brilliant. "So can we look forward to
some Borg barley for breakfast soon?" </P>
<P>Seven smiled, she had grown comfortable enough with her companion and herself
to engage in gentle teasing. "Perhaps, if you behave yourself. Otherwise I will
be forced to eat it myself."</P>
<P>"Lucky Barley," B’Elanna said and stood up. She turned and offered her hand
to Seven and helped her up.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and lead the way to the makeshift nursery she had set up near
the curing shed.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The dermal regenerator ending up working better than either had expected. By
lunchtime they had a six by twelve-foot area of barley that was ready for
harvest. Seven was leaning over the barley waving the regenerator over the
shorter stalks, deeply concentrating on providing the perfect amount of
assistance to the smaller plants.</P>
<P>"Hey, time for lunch," B’Elanna said as she wrapped her arms around Seven’s
waist. Seven shifted to one side causing them both to tumble into the waist high
barley.</P>
<P>"You are <I>not</I> behaving yourself," Seven said as she rolled over and
pinned B’Elanna to the ground.</P>
<P>"Did I tell you how brilliant I think using that regenerator is?" B’Elanna
pulled Seven’s full weight onto her enjoying the intimate press.</P>
<P>"Four times." Seven smiled.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna stared up into Seven’s eyes; they were dark blue and
sparkling the way they always did when she looked at B’Elanna. It was a color no
one on <I>Voyager</I> would recognize since it was her passion for the Klingon
that had darkened them. </P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven was lost in B’Elanna’s deep brown eyes.</P>
<P>"I love you," she whispered uncertainly, terrified she was rushing Seven.</P>
<P>Seven’s lips trembled, and her eyes began to tear up. "I love you, too." She
leaned down and kissed B’Elanna with complete abandon. Soon they had rolled over
and smashed the rest of the barley.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed as she picked a stray piece of barley out of her mouth, not
quite knowing how it got there. "We’re crushing all your hard work."</P>
<P>"I do not care," Seven said as she continued kissing B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Okay, this is one way to bring in a harvest." She rolled Seven over and
began unlacing her top, eager to reach her full breasts. Her hands were shaking,
making it difficult to loosen the leather laces, but finally she was able to
slide her hand through the opening. The leather was soft and the earthy smell
filled her nostrils, but Seven’s skin was softer. B’Elanna moaned when she felt
her lover’s breast heavy in her hand and warmed by the contact with the
leather.</P>
<P>Seven arched into B’Elanna’s hand wanting to increase the contact.
"B’Elanna," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Call me Lana," she answered as she squeezed Seven’s breast and kissed her
throat.</P>
<P>"Lana…" Seven smiled, liking the way the shortened name sounded. She moved
her hands down B’Elanna’s back and began lifting her shirt. Their kissing
continued and Seven managed to get her hands under the thin fabric of B’Elanna’s
tank top, her hands migrating to her breasts. </P>
<P>"Inside…cabin," B’Elanna gasped. "Now."</P>
<P>Seven didn’t seem convinced and she continued her gentle massage of
B’Elanna’s breasts. When B’Elanna sat up, Seven seized the moment and tore off
the Klingon’s shirt and took her bra covered nipple in her mouth and pressed
B’Elanna back down into the fresh barley.</P>
<P>"Oh, god." B’Elanna guided Seven’s hands to her bra and they tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>Seven stared openly at her lover and then began kissing her hardening
nipples.</P>
<P>"Inside the cabin," B’Elanna said even as she moaned at the contact. She was
a romantic, but the barley was poking through her pants distracting her, and she
didn’t want any distractions when they made love for the first time.</P>
<P>Seven pulled back, her eyes wild and darting over B’Elanna’s exposed body.
She took the half-Klingon into her arms and carried her to the cabin continually
kissing her neck.</P>
<P>Once in the cabin, Seven kicked the door shut and let B’Elanna down. She
turned to lock the door and felt B’Elanna tugging at her top. Seven turned back,
smiled at her shorter lover, then peeled off the leather shirt.</P>
<P>"You’re beautiful," B’Elanna whispered. She moved closer until their bare
chests came together with an almost electric touch. "I love you," she whispered
into Seven’s mouth as their tongues met. They stumbled to the bedroom and
B’Elanna eased Seven down onto the pile of blankets and furs and crawled down
beside her. </P>
<P>"‘Lana, I… I want to…" Seven was shaking and looked down at the blankets.
"But, I…"</P>
<P>"What is it?" B’Elanna asked as she took Seven’s face in her hands.</P>
<P>"I do not have any experience with…" Seven looked back down at the blankets
and blushed.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and caressed her lover’s cheek. "There’s no hurry. We can go
as slowly as you like."</P>
<P>Seven gave B’Elanna a frustrated glare. "I do not wish to go slowly. I am
simply unsure of how to proceed."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna laughed. "We can take care of that, darling."</P>
<P>"Darling?"</P>
<P>"It’s a term of endearment. Is it all right?" B’Elanna looked shyly at her
lover.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is." Seven leaned over and kissed B’Elanna and let her hands roam.
"Show me what to do."</P>
<P>"You’re doing fine," B’Elanna said with a whimper. "Just keep touching me."
B’Elanna let her body collapse onto the blankets and held her arms out to
Seven.</P>
<P>"I will." Seven climbed onto her and began kissing her neck. They continued
to explore each other for several minutes until their remaining clothes became
problematic.</P>
<P>"Clothes off. Now," ordered B’Elanna. She tugged off her pants and then
helped Seven out of hers. </P>
<P>"Now what?" Seven rolled onto her back and looked up at B’Elanna.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned over and straddled Seven, resting her weight on her hands and
staring down at her. "We make love," she said as she lowered her weight onto
Seven’s body. They continued kissing until B’Elanna eased off to the side and
began caressing Seven’s chest and making her way down to her belly.</P>
<P>"Show me, Lana," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and placed it on her own breast, demonstrating how
she liked to be touched. Seven was a fast learner and soon her mouth joined her
hands. After a few maddening moments B’Elanna edged her lover onto her back
again and began guiding Seven’s legs apart. Seven rolled her head on the pillow
and moaned, her legs spreading of their own accord.</P>
<P>"Like this," B’Elanna whispered. She ran her fingers down and over Seven’s
belly, alternating between gentle touches and a slow scraping of her fingernails
over Seven’s muscled abdomen. Every few passes she would detour to let her
fingers tangle in the blonde thatch of hair between her lover’s legs and then
return to her belly. The entire time, her lips traveled from Seven’s mouth to
her neck and then down to her breasts. Finally, when Seven’s nipples were
painfully erect, B’Elanna let her hand slip down to her lover’s thigh and slowly
moved back toward her center. </P>
<P>Seven’s breathing was coming in ragged breaths and she was alternating
between whimpers and moans, not knowing what her body was craving, but certain
that B’Elanna was the only one who could provide it.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered. "Lana…" she felt lightheaded, like she was leaving
her body, which at the moment was the last thing she wanted to do. Right now her
body was feeling things she hadn’t known existed and she wanted to be there for
the entire experience.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna whispered into her ear. She kissed Seven’s cheek and
then nipped at her throat. "Right here. Are you ready?" B’Elanna asked as she
let her fingers caress Seven’s opening. The moisture she found flowing from her
lover answered her question. "Oh, yeah, you’re ready."</P>
<P>"Yes… I do not know <I>what</I> I am ready for…but I <I>know</I> I am ready,"
Seven said between gasps. She was panting, arching her back each time B’Elanna
kissed or touched her. </P>
<P>The Klingon laughed, deep and throaty, and pressed Seven’s hips back onto the
blankets. She leaned up and kissed Seven tenderly as her fingers dipped into the
waiting wetness. She was like molten slick velvet, her labia swollen and
saturated. </P>
<P>"Yes, <I>that</I>," Seven yelled. "I am ready for <I>that</I>." Her legs
trembled as B’Elanna circled her with loving sweetness.</P>
<P>"You feel so good, Seven," B’Elanna said between kisses.</P>
<P>Seven could only whimper in response and turn to kiss B’Elanna again. She dug
her willowy hands into B’Elanna’s thick sable hair, trying to deepen the kiss
even more. B’Elanna growled into her mouth and tugged at her lip as she pulled
away and looked into her cobalt blue eyes.</P>
<P>"No," Seven begged, trying to pull B’Elanna back to her mouth.</P>
<P>"I want to look at you." B’Elanna had tears filling her passion darkened
eyes.</P>
<P>Seven nodded and looked up at her lover as she felt B’Elanna enter her. "Oh,"
Seven moaned, her eyelids drooping as she felt herself filled for the first
time. "Lana, I love you." She continued moaning, her voice rising with each
thrust. Their eyes remained locked and Seven felt her own hot tears sliding down
her cheeks and a power was building inside her toward some unknown focus. Then,
she knew she was there, her body stiffened and she felt her breath leave her
body and her muscles seemed to be warring with each other, torn between
clenching to keep B’Elanna inside her and shaking her into a million tiny
pieces.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt Seven gripping her fingers and felt the rush of moisture as her
lover climaxed. She continued her caress, lightening the contact as she guided
Seven through another peak, then slowed and let her come down. Seven went limp,
as if her bones had been tossed aside and B’Elanna eased out of her and gathered
her into her arms, snuggling down on her chest and showering her skin with
fleeting kisses.</P>
<P>They lay in their cabin, covered in sweat, gasping as they fought for their
hearts to slow. B’Elanna clung to Seven, not wanting to lose the connection with
the woman who held her twin hearts.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven finally managed to ask, her voice hoarse and rasping.</P>
<P>"Yes, love?" B’Elanna asked without lifting her head from its warm resting
place on Seven’s breast.</P>
<P>"Thank you, for loving me." </P>
<P>B’Elanna felt Seven’s chest begin to shake, and she lifted her head to see
that the one-time Borg was sobbing. She shifted her weight so that she could
stroke Seven’s cheek with the back of her hand. "What’s wrong?"</P>
<P>Seven shook her head, smiling through the tears. "Nothing."</P>
<P>"Oh, darling." B’Elanna laughed and kissed each of Seven’s eyes, savoring the
salt. "I love you."</P>
<P>Seven slid to the side and positioned B’Elanna on her back. "I want to love
you." She kissed B’Elanna torturously with gentle, soft kisses that she didn’t
deepen, teasing the Klingon until she was growling like the bear she had killed
months earlier. </P>
<P>"Please," B’Elanna begged.</P>
<P>Seven smiled into another kiss, then pulled back. "I am glad you are the
first, the only one I will ever love this way." </P>
<P>It was a promise of monogamy that B’Elanna had not asked for, but one she
would be eternally grateful for, because in that moment she knew she had given
her soul to Seven. She had never understood the Klingon rituals that swore
eternity to a partner after making love, but now she did. She realized that she
had never made love until this very day with Seven and she knew she would never
touch anyone else or be touched by another because Seven owned both Klingon
hearts beating inside her chest.</P>
<P>"You are the only one," B’Elanna said, her voice breaking. "I am yours,
Seven. I pray to Kahless you never tire of me, because no one but you will ever
touch my soul again."</P>
<P>"Tai be’nal?" Seven whispered. It was a benediction and a request, the
Klingon term meaning, "honored wife?" When uttered during love making it was a
promise of love beyond the grave and a request for your partner’s pledge in
return.</P>
<P>"HIja’ epetai-zana," B’Elanna answered without hesitation, telling Seven "It
is true Honored and exalted one," in Klingonese. The response meant that she
belong to Seven forever. </P>
<P>Seven kissed her and then eased away and turned her cheek to B’Elanna for the
ritual bite, but B’Elanna shook her head.</P>
<P>"Never pain, my wife." B’Elanna then kissed her on the cheek instead of
sinking her teeth into her flesh. "I will spill my last drop of blood to prevent
you from shedding even a drop of blood or a single tear in pain."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and reached up and turned B’Elanna’s cheek toward her and
pressed her lips to the tender flesh and left a lingering kiss in place of a
bite. "I will never hurt you, B’Elanna," Seven promised. "If I had a god to pray
to, I would thank him…or her…for bringing me to this planet with you."</P>
<P>"Even if <I>Voyager</I> never comes for us, I will thank Kahless everyday for
giving me this time with you." B’Elanna pulled Seven on top of her and their
kisses deepened as Seven began to love B’Elanna as she had been loved, but she
had a been a Borg, so it was her goal to improve on the perfection of B’Elanna’s
touch. They spent the rest of the day and night learning ways to bring each
other to heights of passion unknown to either woman before. The animals of the
valley heard new cries that night and more than one beast looked out into the
night wondering what predator had such fierce cries.</P>

<P>Captain Janeway had a knot in her stomach, and that meant something was
wrong. If you asked her, she would deny believing in such obvious superstition,
but years of experience had taught her not to ignore the feeling.</P>
<P>"Mister Kim, see if you can hail the away team on subspace," Janeway
ordered.</P>
<P>"Aye, Ma’am." The handsome ensign quickly sent out a message, never thinking
to question why the captain would need to call the shuttle that had only left
two days earlier.</P>
<P>Janeway sat in her chair and stared at the stars on the viewscreen with a
casual expression while waiting for Harry’s report.</P>
<P>"Everything all right, Captain?" Chakotay whispered as he leaned over from
his position beside her.</P>
<P>"Fine," she said casually. "Just thought I’d make sure our missing black
sheep haven’t killed each other yet," she joked. She often referred to the crew
as her flock, and surely her devotion to them rivaled any shepherd.</P>
<P>"Good idea," Chakotay said with a gentle smile. "Those two are like oil and
water."</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said, shaking her head. "Water isn’t explosive. They’re more
like matter and anti-matter."</P>
<P>Tom Paris nodded his head. "And just as dangerous."</P>
<P>"Captain," Harry said from his comm station. "I’m not getting any response,
and there’s no sign of them on long range scanners. I’ve checked their entire
flight path, all the way to the planet."</P>
<P>Janeway stood and turned to the worried Ensign. "Extend the scans outside the
flight path." She looked over at her Chief of Security. "Tuvok, scan for debris
and look for any sign of raiders."</P>
<P>"Aye, Captain," Tuvok said, having already begun the scans as soon as Ensign
Kim had said he couldn’t find the shuttle.</P>
<P>Tom turned and looked at the captain, his eyes asking if he should set a new
heading.</P>
<P>"It’s probably nothing, Tom," she said calmly, but inside she knew something
was terribly wrong.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Three hours later Kathryn Janeway felt like a cat in a room full of hunting
hounds. There had been no sign of the lost shuttle, and she was beginning to
lose patience with the sensors, the scanners, and the crew manning them.</P>
<P>"Report," Janeway barked as she turned to give Harry Kim a deadly glare.</P>
<P>"Nothing ma’am," Harry said as he continued to reset the scanners hoping to
find something.</P>
<P>Tuvok straighten his already perfect posture. "Captain, I have detected a
small nebula in sector 3259. It could be masking the shuttle’s signature," the
Vulcan said.</P>
<P>Janeway looked at her dark skinned officer, her eyes asking him if it was
worth a detour. She had known him longer than anyone else on board, and his deep
brown eyes were telling her that it was the only thing left to check.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris, set a course for that nebula." Janeway sat in her chair,
crossed her legs, and waited.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two hours later, <I>Voyager</I> was sitting at the Dengari board, nose to
nose with a battlecruiser.</P>
<P>Alloc, the Dengari leader spoke with an almost lyric tone, soft and soothing.
"Captain Janeway, we do not wish to enter conflict with you. Be on your journey
and all will be well." His face was tense and the thick ridges on his cheeks
reddened as he spoke.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so." Janeway remained in her chair, her shoulders squared and
her jaw set. Her voice was calm, and deep, and left no question that she would
not be toyed with. "You are holding one of my shuttles at your space station. I
want to speak to my people, now."</P>
<P>Alloc looked off to the side of the viewscreen, then nodded and turned back
toward Janeway. "That will not be possible."</P>
<P>"Why?" Janeway demanded.</P>
<P>"Because your crewmembers," he paused to look at a data padd, "Torres and
Nine, are no longer here."</P>
<P>"Where are they?" Janeway’s eyes darkened and her voice became even more
menacing.</P>
<P>"They violated our space. They have been sent to our penal colony," Alloc
said quietly.</P>
<P>"I need to speak to whoever runs this penal colony of yours," Janeway said.
It was not a request.</P>
<P>"Captain, you are in no position to demand anything." Alloc shifted in his
chair, uncertain of his own words. </P>
<P>"You can either arrange a meeting with the head of the penal colony, or I
will go in there and get my crewmembers on my own. I’d rather do this
diplomatically, but I will do it." Janeway stood, and crossed her arms. Behind
her, Chakotay mirrored her body language, folding his own arms.</P>
<P>Alloc hesitated, and Kathryn Janeway knew she had him.</P>
<P>"I’m waiting," she said.</P>
<P>"Follow me to the space station, but remain at impulse and do not charge your
weapons. All sensors must be kept off-line. This is a correctional facility. If
you wish to enter the station you must use the docking facility and leave your
transporters off-line." Alloc seemed more confident handing out orders. "Follow
us to the station and maintain station keeping 2000 meters off of the port
docking ring and await orders."</P>
<P>"We’ll be right behind you," Janeway said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After an hour of stalling, the Dengari allowed <I>Voyager</I> to dock and
then sent a ‘welcoming party’ to meet them at the airlock. Janeway headed the
away team herself, bringing Tuvok, the Doctor, and Neelix as well. </P>
<P>"Captain Janeway," Alloc said when the airlock hissed open. "If you will come
this way." He motioned down the corridor.</P>
<P>"Where are my crewmembers?" she asked as she moved into step with him. Tuvok,
the Doctor and Neelix walked directly behind her, followed by four muscular
Dengari guards.</P>
<P>"As I said, they are not here. I will take you to the Overseer’s office. She
will explain." Alloc moved quickly and said nothing more.</P>
<P>They stopped at the end of a long corridor and stood next to a large metal
door with a guard on either side. They nodded to Alloc and the door opened
revealing a stark waiting area.</P>
<P>"This way," Alloc said.</P>
<P>"My patience has limits," Janeway said as she paced the small room.</P>
<P>Before Alloc could answer, a smaller door opened and a woman stepped forward.
She was almost seven feet tall, and had long, impossibly straight, jet-black
hair pulled back neatly over her ears and had faint ridges on her cheeks. </P>
<P>"I am the Overseer," she said with a deep, sensual voice.</P>
<P>"I am Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship <I>Voyager</I>."
Janeway tended to use a formal introduction when she wanted to intimidate
someone, but she doubted this woman intimidated easily. "I’m here to get my
people."</P>
<P>"Their sentence has begun. You are too late." The Overseer stopped in front
of the captain and looked down at her, studying the much shorter woman.</P>
<P>"What was the sentence?" Janeway asked. Behind her, Tuvok and the rest of the
away team stood at attention, but said nothing.</P>
<P>"Two and one half years." The Overseer moved past Janeway and studied Tuvok.
</P>
<P>"For trespassing?" Janeway asked and then moved around the Overseer and
blocked her path.</P>
<P>"It is the minimum sentence for entering a restricted area. We cannot
tolerate any incursions into our correction facility," the Overseer explained.
Her voice was gentle as if she understood the stress the captain was going
through.</P>
<P>"I’m sure it was just a misunderstanding. If I could talk to my people we
could figure this out and find some way to end this amiably." Janeway edged
closer and gentled her own voice. "I’m sure your government has dealt with
cultural misunderstandings in the past. Isn’t there some way to work this
out?"</P>
<P>The Overseer studied Janeway and then nodded. "Cultural misunderstandings are
not uncommon, but we cannot allow our laws to be broken with impunity. Chaos
would ensue."</P>
<P>"Well, we wouldn’t want chaos," Janeway said with a disarming smile. "I
hardly think that two crewmembers wandering off course would start the breakdown
of your social structure."</P>
<P>The Overseer smiled and nodded. "I will contact the Magistrate and ask him to
review the case."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Janeway said warmly.</P>
<P>"Wait here," the Overseer said. She nodded at the guards and they exited
through the large door. "I will return after speaking with the Magistrate." She
turned and exited through the smaller door.</P>
<P>"That went well," Janeway said as she turned to her away team.</P>
<P>"Perhaps too well," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>Neelix stepped forward and whispered despite the fact the guards were no
longer in the room. "Captain, this place has a bad feel to it."</P>
<P>Tuvok raised his eyebrow. "Mister Neelix’s ‘feelings’ aside, I believe the
Overseer was too easily convinced."</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Janeway asked, wanting his unique input as well.</P>
<P>"The guards don’t seem to enjoy their work," he said.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Well," the Doctor explained. "They don’t even make eye contact. I’ve been
studying humanoid interactions, and these guards don’t want to face us. They
don’t like what’s going on here."</P>
<P>"Did it occur to you, Doctor, that the cultural norms may be different for
Dengari?" Tuvok asked. "It may not be acceptable for lesser workers to make eye
contact with someone of our stature."</P>
<P>"Enough," Janeway said. "I think we need to keep on our toes. I get the
feeling," Janeway paused and looked at Tuvok, "Sorry, old friend… I get the
<I>feeling</I> that there is more going on with this Overseer than meets the
eye."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Overseer entered her stark office and went directly to a communications
panel on the far wall. She tapped in several commands and then stood at
attention as an elderly man appeared on the screen. His ridged cheeks were
wrinkled and his black hair was streaked with grey. He looked at her and then
frowned.</P>
<P>"Magistrate," she said quietly.</P>
<P>"What news?" he asked.</P>
<P>"The Captain of <I>Voyager</I> is most insistent. She is demanding that I let
her speak to her crew." The Overseer sighed and cleared her throat. "She is
persistent."</P>
<P>"How long have the convicted been on Jusari Prime?"</P>
<P>"They began their sentence yesterday," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>"Does Captain Janeway understand Jusari Prime’s unique nature?"</P>
<P>"No, Magistrate. She has no idea. What should I do?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Stall her. Tell her that I have to mediate a dispute and I will return in
seven days. After she objects, argue with her for at least an hour, then return
to your office and wait another hour. Then go tell her that I have canceled my
mediation and will arrive in four days." The Magistrate smiled and picked up a
small statue from his desk. "Justice will be served."</P>
<P>"Yes, sir. And if she discovers the temporal differential?"</P>
<P>"See that she doesn’t. In five days their sentence will be completed. You
know the law. If they do not serve their term, you as Overseer will complete the
sentence."</P>
<P>"Yes, Magistrate," she said. </P>
<P>"Good day," he said and then closed the channel.</P>
<P>The Overseer accessed the panel and an image of Jusari Prime appeared. It was
a blue and white planet with swirling patterns around its length. The poles had
deep sinkholes dipping into the core of the planet. She sighed and rubbed her
ridged cheek, wishing she hadn’t been born into her position as Overseer. She
would see that the sentence was served, if only to avoid being sent to Jusari
Prime herself. She didn’t like the idea of spending even a second on the planet
that existed outside regular timespace causing it to experience an accelerated
existence. She sighed and sat in her chair and decided to let the Starfleet
captain wait a while longer. She briefly wondered what had become of the two
officers in question, knowing that they would have already experienced months on
the planet. She pushed the idea from her mind. As Overseer, such thoughts were
unacceptable.</P>

<P>Seven looked out of the cabin door at the falling snow and smiled when she
heard B’Elanna in the kitchen. She turned and followed the sounds of the
Half-Klingon heating something on the hearth.</P>
<P>"Good morning," B’Elanna said without turning around. She could hear Seven’s
approach, and smiled knowing what was coming next.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Seven answered as she wrapped B’Elanna in her arms and kissed
her neck. "What are we having?"</P>
<P>"Borg barley." B’Elanna tilted the large pot away from the fire to show her
wife their breakfast. She leaned back into Seven’s body and sighed, savoring the
contact.</P>
<P>"Did you put bee saliva in it?" Seven asked as she wrinkled her nose.</P>
<P>"Yes, I put honey in it. It’s too bland without it. No offense, love, but
that barley is gross." B’Elanna struggled as Seven playfully poked her ribs.</P>
<P>"And how exactly does adding bee saliva make the meal less gross?"</P>
<P>"It just does," B’Elanna said. She put the pan back onto the burner and
turned to face her lover. "Trust me."</P>
<P>"I require convincing." Seven tilted her head down and gently kissed
B’Elanna. They kissed briefly before Seven pulled back and caressed B’Elanna’s
cheek.</P>
<P>"Convinced?" B’Elanna asked, smiling when her taller partner nodded. She
toyed with the laces of Seven’s leather shirt, noticing the way it was a bit
looser on one side than the other. "How come we can build a cabin, make weapons,
pots and pans, but we can’t make a simple shirt that does you justice?"</P>
<P>"I had not considered it." Seven looked down at the garment. In truth, she
hadn’t noticed, she considered the fit of the apparel irrelevant, but if it
bothered her wife, she would find a way to fix it. "Perhaps we are better
engineers and warriors than tailors."</P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, right now, I’d promise Kahless himself a day in the sweat caves
if he’d send us a tailor." B’Elanna turned and took the barley cereal off of the
heat and began filling the two bowls on the table. "And while I’m thinking about
it, maybe Kahless could send us a plumber too. I’m tired of not having a
shower."</P>
<P>Seven picked up the canteen on the table and poured two glasses of tea. She
had discovered some sweet, tangy leaves that grew near the lake that made a
beverage far better than anything Neelix had ever created. It was a tea blend
that was bitter but when raspberry leaves were added it became quite pleasant.
It also had a potent caffeine kick.</P>
<P>"I could help you with your bathing," Seven offered with a coy grin. She
enjoyed watching B’Elanna use the steaming water from the hearth and a soft rag
to wipe her body each night. She liked the way the cooling water made her
lover’s caramel skin erupt into goosebumps and the way her skin seemed even more
sensitive when she finished. Many nights Seven couldn’t even wait for B’Elanna
to take the used water outside before carrying her to their bed to make love to
her. They would wake up in the morning and have to wash the soiled pot before
preparing water for their morning wash routine. Of course, since it was Seven’s
fault, she had to do the predawn chore, but she didn’t consider it a sacrifice,
quite the contrary.</P>
<P>"You could help me in a shower too, or better yet, a nice hot bath." B’Elanna
smiled, her mind wandering to images of Seven in a fragrant bubble bath.</P>
<P>A loud roar suddenly shook the cabin walls. Seven jumped to her feet and ran
out of the door with B’Elanna close behind. They jogged to the middle of their
camp and watched as a craft shot overhead and went down in the trees on the
other side of the lake.</P>
<P>"Damn, it." B’Elanna shifted her weight from foot to foot. She had rushed out
barefooted and the thin layer of snow felt like pins in her feet. "We need to go
check that out."</P>
<P>Seven turned, quickly noticing her wife shuffling her feet and scooped up the
feisty Klingon. "You should not be outside without your shoes," she
chastised.</P>
<P>"Seven, a shuttle just crashed, and for all we know it could be a murderer or
worse and you’re worried about my bare feet?" B’Elanna held on around Seven’s
willowy neck as she was carried back inside.</P>
<P>"Whoever they are, they will wait for you to put your shoes on. I will not
have you injuring yourself." Seven gently placed B’Elanna next to the fire and
went to get her boots.</P>
<P>"You’re not my mother," B’Elanna said, but her complaint was softened by the
wide grin on her face and the fact that she was warming her chilled feet on the
hearth.</P>
<P>"No, I am your wife. I outrank your mother." Seven used a towel to dry
B’Elanna’s feet before handing her a fresh pair of socks.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and finished putting on her footwear. "You just remember you
said that when you meet my mother." </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna dressed warmly, collected the med kit, and then gathered
all of the weapons they had before heading toward the crash site. Both were
quiet, each worrying about the other and what they might find.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>They reached the site after an hour and a half of hiking. The snow was a
light dusting, having only fallen a few nights before, with most of it melting
off except under the thickest trees. Seven used the tricorder to locate the
exact location, but B’Elanna insisted on taking the lead as they followed the
long rut carved through the forest by the ship’s impact. </P>
<P>"Over there," B’Elanna whispered and pointed to a shuttle exactly like the
one they had been sent down in.</P>
<P>Seven nodded and made her way around a large boulder. She scanned the
wreckage, seeing two lifesigns. "Lana," she whispered and then held up two
fingers to indicate the number of occupants. The Klingon nodded and gripped her
spear tightly as she raised it up to her shoulder. As they rounded the boulder
they heard a loud moan, and stopped. </P>
<P>"Who are you?" B’Elanna demanded as she stepped out and straddled a man
leaning against a downed tree. He was almost six feet tall, and well muscled,
his hair brown peppered with grey at the temples and he had a thick brow
ridge.</P>
<P>He looked up, terror filling his eyes and then looked back toward the
shuttle.</P>
<P>"Who are you?" B’Elanna asked again, adding a throaty growl for good
measure.</P>
<P>"Please don’t hurt him," a woman said from the shuttle as she leaned out of
the door. She was smaller than the man, with mousy brown hair and small pretty
features. Both she and the man looked almost human except for a slightly thicker
brow ridge that made them both look rather unintelligent like the Cro-Magnon’s
of Earth’s past.</P>
<P>Seven stepped out of the trees next to the shuttle, startling the woman who
screamed and jumped back, but quickly recovered and leaned back out.</P>
<P>"One more time," B’Elanna said. "Who are you? Answer now or I get…grouchy.
"</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven interrupted. She turned to the woman. "Can he
understand?"</P>
<P>The woman nodded slowly.</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to one side and glared at the woman. "Then I suggest he
answers the question."</P>
<P>"I am Tach," the man said as he tried to stand. His leg gave out and he fell
to the wet, cold ground.</P>
<P>"Well, Tach, what are you doing here?" B’Elanna asked as she moved the spear
to a less threatening position at her side.</P>
<P>He seemed to relax slightly once the weapon was no longer posed to hit him in
the throat. "My wife and I were imprisoned for carrying contraband."</P>
<P>"Contraband?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>He nodded. "We were transporting our livestock, Kelvin cattle. We didn’t know
that they had been outlawed in this system."</P>
<P>"How long are you here for?" Torres asked as she knelt beside him and
examined his leg.</P>
<P>"One year," he said warily. "Who are you?"</P>
<P>"Trespassers," B’Elanna said with a smile. </P>
<P>Seven eyed the woman. "We will not harm you."</P>
<P>"I’m Nara," she said as she climbed down. Once she was out of the door it was
clear why she had stayed inside. She was pregnant, and judging from the size of
her belly, it wouldn’t be long before a child joined the small group.</P>
<P>"You are pregnant," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"Yes, but only for about another month," Nara said quietly.</P>
<P>Seven looked inside the cabin, noticing that the chair restraints were in
place and realized Tach shouldn’t have been hurt in the crash. "How did you
injure yourself?" she asked, suddenly suspicious. "How did you alter your
trajectory away from the prison cities?" </P>
<P>"The guard, Malok, reprogrammed the guidance system. He said we wouldn’t want
to go to the cities," Nara said as she made her way toward her husband.</P>
<P>"And this leg?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Tach mumbled something and looked away, while Nara smiled. </P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I fell out of the shuttle," he said.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said and bit her lip to stop from laughing. "Seven, bring me
that med kit." She looked into Tach’s eyes and smiled. "I’m B’Elanna. This is
Seven, my wife."</P>
<P>"Nice to meet you. We are Narians," he said. "Does your wife run your house,
too?" he asked with a wry grin. B’Elanna smiled and bit her lip.</P>
<P>Seven placed the kit next to Tach’s leg and leaned over near B’Elanna’s face.
"Do you trust them?" she whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna shrugged and mended the leg. "Seven is human, and I’m Klingon, well
mostly. So, Tach, what are you gonna’ do?"</P>
<P>He flexed his leg and then stood carefully, smiling when his leg held his
weight. "We brought our tools. We are farmers, so we will farm." He moved
careful toward the shuttle hopping from rock to rock.</P>
<P>"Tach, don’t break the other one," Nara ordered.</P>
<P>He smiled and squeezed her arm when he finally reached her. "Even my luck
isn’t that bad, Nara."</P>
<P>Seven looked to B’Elanna and raise an eyebrow. "We should go. The snow could
start again soon."</P>
<P>"Thank you, for your help," Tach said. "Perhaps we will see you again."</P>
<P>"Thank you, for helping my husband. Tach, we should build a fire. Don’t
dawdle." Nara went back into the shuttle. Tach obediently followed.</P>
<P>B’Elanna watched, then turned to Seven. "Maybe we should, you know, help them
until they can get on their feet. I mean, she’s pregnant for Kahless sake."</P>
<P>Seven smirked, and crossed her arms. "Kahless? Perhaps these are the tailors
you asked for… or the plumber."</P>
<P>"You were gonna’ offer to help all along, weren’t you," B’Elanna accused with
a smile.</P>
<P>"Falling in love has made me weak," Seven replied and took B’Elanna’s
hand.</P>
<P>"Hey, Tach?" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>"Yes?" he asked, leaning out of the shuttle with his arms full of tools.</P>
<P>"You wouldn’t happen to be a tailor would you?" B’Elanna asked and squeezed
Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"No," he said, obviously confused. "But my Nara is quite a seamstress."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened. "And are you a plumber?"</P>
<P>"Great Goddess, no," he laughed. "As I said, I am a farmer. But I have done
my share of home repairs. Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll be having a home
other than this shuttle for a while."</P>
<P>"Kahless?" Seven whispered and looked at B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Don’t look at me," B’Elanna said in a whisper. "Um, Tach, can you two
travel?"</P>
<P>"Nara can, but I can’t guarantee myself. I am a bit…clumsy." He flinched and
Nara leaned out.</P>
<P>"I told you not to dawdle. Where’s the firewood?" She stretched and rubbed
the small of her back.</P>
<P>"If you’re interested, we have a cabin a few hours from here. It’s warm and
dry, and we have a good supply of food," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>Nara leaned into Tach, and wrapped her arm around him. "We have nothing to
offer in return," she said.</P>
<P>"You’re a farmer," B’Elanna said. "You can help us… uh, farm. Can you
hunt?"</P>
<P>He nodded.</P>
<P>Seven stepped forward. "Nara, you are a seamstress? We require…assistance,"
she explained, then pointed to her shirt to prove the point.</P>
<P>Nara jumped down from the shuttle and approached Seven, carefully examining
her clothes. "You’re a big one, aren’t you?" she asked. "And you certainly do
need…assistance."</P>
<P>Seven pulled away and glared at the smaller, rounder woman. "Do you wish to
accept our offer?"</P>
<P>Nara smiled. "I like her." She turned to B’Elanna. "Are you as difficult as
she is?"</P>
<P>"Worse," Torres said as she stepped onto a rock behind Seven that put her
several inches above her wife. She wrapped her arms around Seven from behind and
rested her chin on her lover’s shoulder. "Much worse."</P>
<P>"It’s a deal," Nara said without looking to Tach.</P>

<P>It took just over two hours to get back to cabin, which surprised B’Elanna.
She had expected a clumsy farmer and his pregnant wife to slow them down, but
both proved to be competent. They traveled quietly through the trees and didn’t
complain about the weight of the tools. Once back at the cabin, the farmers were
impressed.</P>
<P>"I don’t think you’ll be needing much help from me with the cabin," Tach said
as he shook his head. "That’s a sturdy structure, and from the size of that
smoke shed, looks like I have some hunting to do."</P>
<P>"Come on inside," B’Elanna said as she opened the door. The fire in the
hearth was mostly burned down, but there were coals glowing brightly thanks to
the hard wood and the well-crafted fireplace. The room was warm and the smell of
breakfast still lingered.</P>
<P>Nara followed B’Elanna and smiled as she took in the surroundings. "Well now,
we can work with this," she said as she looked at the stack of furs off against
one wall. "I’ll have you in shirts in no time." She moved to the hearth and
warmed her hands.</P>
<P>Seven and Tach came in last and stacked most of the tools near the door. Tach
picked out a small box and carried it over to the table next to the fire.</P>
<P>"Get those boots off," Nara ordered. "I won’t be tending you in a
sickbed."</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," Tach said as he sat on the floor at his wife’s feet.</P>
<P>"<I>Oh god,"</I> B’Elanna thought. "<I>He’s me… and we’re both whipped."</I>
She turned and looked at Seven who had both eyebrows raised and her arms
crossed. Her blue eyes were pinned on B’Elanna’s wet boots.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," B’Elanna said with a huff and tugged her boots off.</P>
<P>Tach smiled at the Klingon and she shrugged her shoulders and sat next to
him.</P>
<P>Seven ignored her own wet feet and stoked the fire, pausing her run her hand
through B’Elanna’s hair as she passed. Once the flames were putting off as much
heat as a warp core breech, she went to the kitchen and started heating some
water and collecting spices and some dried meat. </P>
<P>Nara came up behind her. "Can I help you with that?"</P>
<P>Seven turned at looked at the shorter woman’s bulging belly. "Perhaps you
should rest. I do not want the child coming out early."</P>
<P>"No chance of that." Nara laughed and rubbed her stomach. "I love Tach, but
that man’s never been early to anything in his life."</P>
<P>"And the child knows this?" Seven asked suspiciously.</P>
<P>"Great Goddess, I hope so." Nara laughed again. Seven liked the sound of the
tiny woman’s rich laugh. "What is that?" Nara asked, pointing to the pot.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna calls the animal a cow, but I assure you, that is a deceptive
designation." Seven tossed in some wild mushrooms.</P>
<P>"Well, if they’re cows, Tach will get the best from them."</P>
<P>"We do not…farm them. They are wild and we take them as we need them," Seven
said a bit sadly.</P>
<P>"You don’t much like killing them, do you?" Nara moved closer and examined
the various vegetables on the counter, tossing in a few that interested her.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said quietly. "I have seen enough death."</P>
<P>"I hope you never change that way of thinking. Death should never be
welcomed. We take a life when we need it. The Goddess doesn’t like waste. Take
what you need and leave the rest." Nara smiled up at Seven. "And soon, we’ll be
having new life." </P>
<P>Seven nodded, liking the idea of new life, but uncertain about who the
goddess in question was. "I have never seen a lifeform from its initial
emergence."</P>
<P>"Well, you will," Nara said as she looked around the kitchen, stopping when
she saw the power converter. "What’s that? I didn’t think there was any
electricity on the planet." </P>
<P>"It is a solar converter. I require it to augment my…implants." Seven glanced
out toward the other room, suddenly nervous.</P>
<P>"I noticed your…prosthetics. I didn’t realize your injuries required special
treatment. Where you injured in an accident?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"I was Borg," Seven said quietly.</P>
<P>"Borg? What is that? I don’t understand?" Nara moved closer, staring at the
implant over Seven’s eye.</P>
<P>"Be glad you do not. If you did, we would most likely not be meeting now."
Seven stepped away and turned to leave. "The stew needs to simmer for a while
before it is tender. Help yourself to anything you want." Seven went back out to
the fire and sat next to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"You’re soaked," B’Elanna whispered as she wrapped a fur around her wife and
then crawled around her and began taking off her shoes. Seven said nothing, just
watching as B’Elanna removed her shoes and rubbed her feet to warm them. The
compact Klingon then moved around behind Seven and rubbed her shoulders. Seven
relaxed into the touch and leaned back against her.</P>
<P>"You been married long?" Tach asked, smiling at the two women.</P>
<P>"Almost five months," B’Elanna said as she leaned down and kissed Seven’s
temple from behind.</P>
<P>"Four months twenty eight days," Seven corrected. "Our anniversary is in two
days."</P>
<P>"Then I guess we’ll be having a party," he said. He noticed Seven’s eyes
widen. "Or perhaps the two of you can celebrate alone. I remember being newly
joined."</P>
<P>"It’s not that," B’Elanna said, though she knew that was a big part of it.
"We’ve been alone for a while, and we may need some time to adjust to
having…company."</P>
<P>"Good enough," he said. </P>
<P>Nara came in and sat on one of the seats at the small table. She leaned back
and let her head fall over the headrest and released a long sigh.</P>
<P>"Are you having the child?" Seven asked, sitting up.</P>
<P>"No," Nara said without moving. "Just nice to be off my feet."</P>
<P>B’Elanna pulled Seven back to her and giggled. "It’s not just gonna’ come
shooting out without warning."</P>
<P>Seven turned her head and kissed B’Elanna’s cheek. "Are you certain?"</P>
<P>"Well, yeah," B’Elanna said. "Well, pretty sure." She looked over at Tach.
"That thing isn’t gonna’ come flying out of there is it?"</P>
<P>"Goddess, I hope not," he said calmly.</P>
<P>"Tach," Nara said, her eyes still closed. "I think you need to go out hunting
tomorrow and help bring in some meat. You need to pull your weight."</P>
<P>"Our weight," he corrected then looked over at B’Elanna. "You mind showing me
around in the morning?"</P>
<P>"Not at all. I was going out myself." B’Elanna felt Seven squeeze her arms
and she pulled the blonde closer. She enjoyed the closeness, then remember
something else. "There are a few rules, though," B’Elanna added.</P>
<P>"It’s your valley," he said carefully. "What is it?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna rubbed Seven’s arm as she spoke, the feisty Klingon not even aware
she was doing it. "Well, we use whatever we kill, all the meat, and the hide.
And we don’t take the best animals of the herd, leave those for breeding," she
explained.</P>
<P>"You sure you’re not a farmer?" he asked. "Those are good rules. It’ll keep
the herd strong."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said. "One other thing. There’s a honey red calf, you leave
that one alone."</P>
<P>"Breeder?" he asked.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven’s hair. "That one is my wife’s pet.
You don’t want to hurt that one, as a matter of fact, maybe you shouldn’t take
any of the honey red ones. I don’t."</P>
<P>Seven blushed, touched by her lover’s words. She had known that B’Elanna
would never kill the calf she had named after Naomi Wildman, but she hadn’t been
aware that the protection extended to all the reddish blonde cattle. </P>
<P>"I didn’t know," Seven said, turning to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Well, I didn’t think you’d want to look at a hide the same color as your
little Naomi Wildcow." Torres began blushing too. She wasn’t used to having
witnesses to her soft side.</P>
<P>Seven didn’t seem phased by the newcomers. "I love you, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Me too, my wife," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Naomi Wildcow?" Tach asked with grin that proved he had his own soft
spot.</P>
<P>"I have a friend, a child. She was my family on board our ship," Seven
explained. "Her name is Naomi Wildman. The calf looks like her. Well, it
resembles her…slightly."</P>
<P>Nara sat up. "Tach, you best not be bringing home any ‘honey red’ hides or
I’ll string you up myself."</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," he said. He looked over at B’Elanna. "Will you show me exactly
what a ‘honey red’ cow is?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and rested her chin on Seven’s shoulder. It occurred to her
that her life on this prison planet seemed more full and rewarding than being
Chief Engineer ever had, although if they ever got back to <I>Voyager</I>, she
knew her life would be just as full. It wasn’t the planet, or mountain air, or
even the new friendly couple. Her life was full because of the woman she held in
her arms, and nothing would ever change that.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Captain Janeway was tired of waiting. The Overseer had promised her that the
all-powerful "Magistrate" would arrive soon but it wasn’t fast enough for
Janeway. The Magistrate was due in three days, but Kathryn decided she would
have her crewmembers long before that.</P>
<P>"Tuvok, you’re with me," Janeway said as she came out of her ready room.
"Chakotay, you have the bridge. I’m going over there and I’m not coming back
until I have news about B’Elanna and Seven." She didn’t wait for a response and
Tuvok had to rush to make it to the turbolift with her.</P>
<P>Chakotay nodded. He had already argued with the fiery redheaded captain,
trying to convince her to just wait until the Magistrate arrived, but she didn’t
agree. He looked down at Tom Paris who was obviously concerned as well and the
two men sighed in unison.</P>
<P>Janeway and Tuvok waited at the airlock for their escort. They had been
traveling the corridors everyday to appeal to the Overseer to allow a visit, but
so far she had not agreed. Janeway had seen several groups of prisoners being
led to battlecruisers that always disappeared into the nebula. She had decided
to take <I>Voyager</I> into the nebula and retrieve her lost crewmembers if she
didn’t get satisfaction soon.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway," the tall guard said as he opened the air lock. "I will
take you to the Overseer’s office."</P>
<P>"Malok, isn’t it?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," he said, shifting his weight.</P>
<P>"I keep seeing prisoners leaving, but none arriving. Why is that?" Janeway
walked alongside the giant of a man while Tuvok seemed almost bored as he
followed behind her. Tuvok’s expression was impassive, but behind his dark eyes
he was noticing every detail of the space station, from the leaking pipe near
the airlock to the fact that Malok’s boots needed a shine.</P>
<P>Malok glanced around before speaking. "The prisoners arrive at a different
docking ring, near the medical facility."</P>
<P>"Why would they need a medical facility? Doesn’t the prison have doctors on
staff?" she asked. She was well aware that a guard should not be sharing any
tactical information, and that this man was probably risking his job or worse.
She waited for his answer, figuring that if he was going to answer, he would do
so when he felt safe.</P>
<P>They walked awhile longer then Malok paused and looked at a small atrium that
most likely helped process the station’s air supply. Janeway stood next to him,
waiting.</P>
<P>"Jusari Prime is not exactly a prison," he said quietly.</P>
<P>Janeway nodded, keeping her face calm.</P>
<P>"Prisoners are released in two main cities and must fend for themselves," he
said.</P>
<P>"And the medical facilities?" she asked.</P>
<P>"There are none on the planet. After retrieval, prisoners are checked for any
illness and their genetic markers and universal translators are removed. We use
the markers to track and retrieve the prisoners." Malok turned away and watched
as another guard approached and passed by. Janeway said nothing.</P>
<P>"The doctors are very conscientious," Malok said. "They also handle placing
the children."</P>
<P>"Children?" Janeway asked, truly confused.</P>
<P>Malok turned and faced her. "It is my people’s greatest shame, Captain. The
violent criminals are given life sentences, and they become…predatory. Many of
the women return with children. We place the ones the mothers do not wish to
raise and terminate any unwanted conceptions."</P>
<P>All the color drained from Janeway’s face and she actually felt lightheaded.
"You send women down there to be preyed upon?" she asked, her voice
cracking.</P>
<P>He looked down, unable to meet her eyes. "There are not many women sent to
Jusari Prime. Our own citizens are not sent there except for heinous crimes, and
there are not many female travelers in our space."</P>
<P>Janeway glared at Malok, her eyes completely grey. "So you won’t put your own
people in harms way, but you send others into hell?"</P>
<P>"As I said, my people are ashamed. The Magistrate began this new system
seventy five years ago. It has cut down on crime and it is cost effective," he
said quietly. </P>
<P>"Cost effective?" Janeway demanded in a harsh whisper to avoid being
overheard. "I want my people out of there, now. What kind of monsters allow this
to go on?"</P>
<P>"Most citizens know nothing of the actual horrors of Jusari Prime." His
expression was pained. "Those who work here are born to it. We have no choice.
If I were to leave, I would be captured and sent to Jusari Prime for life."</P>
<P>"How do I get my people out of there?"</P>
<P>"I cannot help you," he said. "I do what I can to help the prisoners."</P>
<P>"How? By apologizing for dooming them?" Janeway said. Her voice was more
snarl than speech.</P>
<P>"I look the other way, leave a restraint a little too loose, accidentally
send the nonviolent offenders off course away from the city," he explained.</P>
<P>"What about my people?" Janeway looked down the corridor at a small group
that was approaching. Four guards were dragging two men in shackles.</P>
<P>Malok began walking with Tuvok and Janeway flanking him on either side. "Your
people seemed resourceful," he said. "The golden haired one complained of an arm
injury and asked me to loosen her restraint, but I do not think she was injured.
I… agreed to loosen the restraint." With that he was silent, and walked quickly
to the Overseer’s office.</P>
<P>Janeway was beyond angry. She was horrified at what her away team might be
going through and furious with herself for not demanding their release sooner.
She only hoped B’Elanna and Seven had been able to hold there own so far<I>. "A
few days… they’re both strong. They can keep themselves safe for a few
days,"</I> she told herself, but inside she wasn’t convinced.</P>
<P>Once they reached the office Malok leaned closer to Janeway. "There is more,"
he whispered. "But to reveal it means certain death. Find out about the planet,
study it."</P>
<P>Janeway moved closer. "What am I looking for?" she asked, wondering what
other horrors could be worse than what he had already revealed.</P>
<P>"Hurry," he said and then marched back down the corridor leaving Janeway at
the Overseer’s office under the supervision of the two guards at the door.</P>

<P>Nara stood in the doorway of the kitchen and cleared her throat. B’Elanna
jerked her head around, startled. She had been sitting at the table removing the
hulls from some small nuts while Seven stood in the corner regenerating near the
cooking hearth.</P>
<P>"Need something?" B’Elanna asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Can she hear us?" Nara asked as she studied Seven.</P>
<P>"She’s aware of my presence, I don’t know about you." B’Elanna stood and
moved over to the door, blocking Nara’s view. "Look, I’m not real comfortable
with anyone hanging around looking at her while she’s regenerating…"</P>
<P>"I didn’t mean to intrude," Nara said sincerely. "I was just concerned. Is
she all right?"</P>
<P>"She’s fine," B’Elanna said quietly. "I didn’t mean to bite your head off,
it’s just that, well…"</P>
<P>"You worry about her," Nara said with a smile. "As it should be. I’ll tell
Tach to stay out of the kitchen whenever she’s…uh… regenerating. How long does
it take?"</P>
<P>"About two hours, sometimes more if I don’t keep after her to eat right."
B’Elanna walked into the main room with Nara, but continually looked over her
shoulder. She wasn’t used to having Seven out of her site when she was so
unprotected. </P>
<P>Nara shook her head and smiled. "Go back to her. I’ll just be looking over
the skins you’ve gathered so I can start showing Seven how to make those shirts
fit a little better."</P>
<P>"Thank you," B’Elanna said. She went back the kitchen and continued cracking
open the nuts. It was a time consuming task made more difficult by the fact that
the Klingon constantly caught herself staring at her wife and wondering what she
did to deserve the beautiful woman.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tach closed the door to the smoking shed and washed his hands in a nearby
bucket. He turned when he heard footsteps. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna," he said. "I finished hanging that meat. Those cattle of yours are
a little bigger than I’m used to." He smiled shook the water from his hands.</P>
<P>"You’re done?" B’Elanna asked. "It usually takes me until evening to prepare
it for drying."</P>
<P>"You took that animal down like a first class hunter, but thirty five years
of experience butchering cattle gives me an advantage in there." He pointed to
the spears on the ground. "Those’ll work, obviously, but I think I can rig up a
crossbow if you’re interested."</P>
<P>"I like the way you think." Her smile widened. </P>
<P>"I took the liberty of having a good look at the storage area this morning.
Might be nice to set up a cold room, maybe somewhere we could hang a few sides
of meat." He fidgeted with a stick from the ground. "Don’t mean to be
presumptuous."</P>
<P>"Not at all," B’Elanna assured him. "We thought of that too, but we haven’t
found anyway to rig it."</P>
<P>"Well, if we built an insulated building a little bigger than the smoke shed,
couldn’t we use some of the coolant from the shuttle and some tubing? Don’t all
thrusters need coolant?" he asked.</P>
<P>"For a farmer, that’s pretty good thinking. Unfortunately, we checked into
that, and there isn’t enough coolant or tubing to rig it." B’Elanna sighed,
thinking how nice it would be to have fresh steaks instead of just jerky and
rabbit.</P>
<P>"Even with our shuttle?" he asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stopped in her tracks, her mind calculating tubing and coolant
requirements per square foot of the area to be refrigerated. She was in full
engineer mode and it felt good. </P>
<P>"I’m gonna’ enjoy having you around, Tach." She pulled him to a stop and
looked into his pale brown eyes. He might look like a Neanderthal, but he was a
godsend. "Ya’ know, right before you two got here, Seven and I were asking for a
tailor and plumber. Looks like he sent me an engineer too."</P>
<P>"Asking who?"</P>
<P>"Kahless." Torres laughed. "I don’t believe much in prayer, but it seems like
he heard me."</P>
<P>"Have you paid tribute?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Uh, no."</P>
<P>"Well, you must. Won’t you incur this Kahless’ wrath?" Tach seemed extremely
concerned, looking around as if Kahless would jump out of a tree and strike them
both dead on the spot. "What is the expected offering for such a gift?"</P>
<P>"Um, well, I was joking about going to the sweat caves for a day… we were
just kidding." Now Torres looked around, expecting to her wife jump out of a
tree and strike her dead for getting trapped in the current conversation.
"Besides, we don’t have sweat caves here," she tried.</P>
<P>"A sweat house is easy enough to prepare," Tach said waving one hand in the
air. "We should wait until Nara has brought the child into being. We will need
her help." </P>
<P>"Um, Tach…<I>If</I> I were to do a sweat, I hardly think I’d need your wife’s
help. No offense." She looked around for her own wife thinking the fates would
probably drop the exdrone on her any minute.</P>
<P>"No offense taken." He studied B’Elanna. "Have you ever entered a ritual
sweat?"</P>
<P>"Well, not exactly."</P>
<P>"And it is part of your spiritual quest?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Well, I’m only half Klingon. But I have had experiences," she said, thinking
of her unpleasant visit to the Barge of the Dead.</P>
<P>He smiled. "We will help you through it. I sense you are a woman of honor,
B’Elanna. If you promised your Kahless a sweat, you must give it." He walked
away, obviously considering the subject settled.</P>
<P>"Thanks," she said. She walked toward the cabin, thinking about her words
before the shuttle arrived. Each step closer to the Homestead made her realize
how much Tach and Nara’s arrival had been exactly what she had requested, and
she was Klingon after all. Besides, how difficult could a day of sweating be?
She sweated everyday. It might even be kind of fun.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The next month passed quickly, with everyone keeping busy. Nara taught Seven
and B’Elanna faster ways to tan the hides and helped collect herbs, berries and
nuts. Their days were busy, despite the fact that they had four people working.
The first thing they did was build the cold storage house for the meat, then
they moved on to expanding the cabin, which Seven was especially grateful for.
The two weeks it had taken to add a separate bedroom had been the longest of her
life. She had become quite short tempered in the close quarters, not
appreciating the fact that she and B’Elanna had to limit their lovemaking. She
enjoyed making love with her beloved Klingon at least once a day, and preferred
the spontaneity of grabbing B’Elanna whenever the mood stuck her, often spending
the afternoon in bed. She was not amused by the concept of planning lovemaking
around times when they had the cabin alone, not amused at all.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The first night after the new bedroom had been completed she and B’Elanna
moved into it, the group deciding that the "Newly Joined" should have the more
spacious addition and the privacy it afforded. The first day after it had been
completed, Seven and B’Elanna never left their bed.</P>
<P>Once Seven felt properly reintroduced to her wife, the group began B’Elanna’s
dream project. They added a bathtub with running hot and cold water as well as
putting in a real toilet with leech fields. The Klingon decided she was in
heaven. Indoor plumbing and a hot bath seemed almost decadent, add to that a
private room with six feet of hot-blooded blonde, and life couldn’t get any
better. Now they just had to wait for Nara’s baby, and then settle the minor
matter of the sweat she owed Kahless.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven was sitting in front of the fire making a jacket for B’Elanna. She and
Nara had carefully prepared the calfskin so that it was as smooth as a newborn’s
bottom, or so Nara explained. Seven would wait until she actually felt the child
in question’s bottom before deciding. She had used a rich brown dye made from
tree bark on the leather. She thought it would complement B’Elanna’s eyes and
looked forward to giving it to her.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Nara said from the small table.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven looked up from the leather covering her lap as she sat in front
of the fire.</P>
<P>"How long before Tach and B’Elanna get back?" she asked, knowing that Seven
had an incredible ability to keep track of time and estimate when any given task
would be completed.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow. "They were going out to the herd at the end of the
lake. If they were successful with their hunt, they should be back in under two
hours," she explained and then went back to her project.</P>
<P>"Um, Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven asked, looking up again.</P>
<P>"It’s time," Nara said.</P>
<P>"Time?" Seven stared at Nara, then the realization sank in. Her pale features
lost what little color there was and then she stood and tossed the jacket onto
the floor. "You must wait until Tach returns," Seven decreed. </P>
<P>"It doesn’t work that way," Nara said with a faint smile.</P>
<P>"I do not care how it works," Seven said as she moved to the table. "You will
wait for Tach."</P>
<P>Nara laughed and shook her head. She had grown very fond of Seven and
B’Elanna and was still amazed that Seven’s brilliant mind often had no
understanding of day to day reality.</P>
<P>"I see no humor in this situation," Seven said, her voice rising as she paced
around Nara. She stopped and cautiously looked under the table as if the child
would come crawling out at her.</P>
<P>"Oh, Seven, believe me, this is funny." Nara stood, using the table to lever
herself out of the chair.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" Seven yelled and jumped back. She looked from Nara’s
belly to the rug, edging closer and then pulling back, not sure if the child
would flop onto the cabin floor.</P>
<P>"I’m having contractions," Nara explained calmly. "I’m going to walk around a
little so my back doesn’t hurt so bad. Then I’m going to go over to the bed and
get the supplies together."</P>
<P>"No," Seven ordered. "You should not be doing any of that. I will prepare the
bed, and you should not be walking," With that, Seven picked up Nara and carried
her toward the bed.</P>
<P>"I’m in labor, not crippled," Nara said. </P>
<P>Seven stopped and stared at the bed, then at Nara. "What do I need to
do?"</P>
<P>"Let me see?" Nara said. "For starters…you can put me down."</P>
<P>Seven settled Nara on the bed and glared at her. "You are enjoying my
discomfort," she accused.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am." Nara shifted until she was more comfortable. "Now get me a stack
of towels, some clean, hot water and some jerky."</P>
<P>"What are you going to do with the jerky?" Seven asked, horrified.</P>
<P>"Eat it," Nara said and then burst into laughter. "Seven, how can someone as
smart as you are know so little about birth?"</P>
<P>"As a Borg I had no experience with this process, and I do not remember my
own birth," she said, somewhat offended. She hurried to the storeroom and came
back with the jerky and towels. </P>
<P>"Thanks." Nara took the jerky and began chewing it while she put the towels
on the bed under her and then started removing her pants. </P>
<P>Seven went to the door and looked outside for any sign of B’Elanna or Tach
but saw none. She went back to the bed and stood with her hands linked behind
her back.</P>
<P>"You must delay this child’s arrival. I have insufficient experience to
assist you," Seven said.</P>
<P>"It probably won’t get here for a few hours anyway," Nara said calmly. "If it
does, just do what I tell you."</P>
<P>"Very well." Seven nodded, somewhat more relaxed. "How many children have you
delivered?"</P>
<P>"Well, none," Nara said.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "You will not have this child until they return. I forbid
it."</P>
<P>"Seven, children don’t listen even after they’re born. They certainly don’t
listen while they’re inside." Nara shook her head and looked to the door. She
was trying to remain calm, but the idea of Seven as a midwife did not appeal to
her. "Maybe you should go get them," Nara said.</P>
<P>"I do not believe that is the prudent course of action," Seven said, although
the idea of leaving the cabin certainly appealed to her. She had complained
about the foot of snow outside, but now she would be quite willing to go outside
even if the snow increased to ten feet.</P>
<P>Nara looked at Seven and then the door while Seven studied the floor. They
both knew Seven was in over her head. A sound outside caused both of them to
turn toward the door. Seven sprinted outside without grabbing a coat or shoes.
She saw Tach and B’Elanna lifting a side of beef into the cold storage.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven yelled, running toward her spouse.</P>
<P>Tach and the Klingon looked up, both covered in sweat.</P>
<P>"What it is?" B’Elanna asked as she moved toward her wife.</P>
<P>"<I>Your</I> child is coming," Seven said to Tach angrily.</P>
<P>Tach smiled and ran toward the cabin. His thick brow ridge crinkled as his
smile widened with each step. B’Elanna began moving toward the cabin as well,
but stopped when she reached Seven.</P>
<P>"Hey, is everything all right?" she asked noticing how pale Seven was and the
look of terror in her eyes.</P>
<P>"No. No, it is not. You left me here and… and…"</P>
<P>She saw Seven shiver, and took off her thick cloak and wrapped it around her
as she led her toward the cabin. "Good thing we came across this bull on this
side of the meadow." She knew Tach was the only one experienced at assisting
births, although his experience was limited to cattle. "Is Nara okay?" B’Elanna
asked.</P>
<P>"<I>She</I> is fine. <I>She</I> finds the experience humorous." Seven stopped
and looked at B’Elanna and then pulled her into a hug. </P>
<P>B’Elanna held her for a moment and then eased away. "Let’s go inside where
it’s warm."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and kept her arm around B’Elanna the entire time. Once inside,
they went to the bed to check on Nara.</P>
<P>"Her water broke," Tach said calmly. "Could still be a while, though. The
contractions are still a ways apart."</P>
<P>"That is disgusting," Seven said after looking at the bed and seeing the
water in question and then headed for the other room.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two hours later B’Elanna was able to convince Seven to come back into the
room. It was just in time for her to see the baby born. Suddenly, she didn’t
find the experience quite as disgusting. She watched as Nara and Tach held their
son, a child their love created, and she felt an unfamiliar ache inside.</P>
<P>B’Elanna seemed to feel her lover’s pain and took her hand. "You okay?" she
asked.</P>
<P>"I did not realize," Seven whispered as she watched the tiny child struggling
to hold Tach’s finger in his fist.</P>
<P>"Realize what?" B’Elanna ran the back of her fingers down Seven’s cheek. The
taller woman smiled into the touch and lowered her face down to her
partner’s.</P>
<P>"He is already a person," Seven said as she pressed her forehead against
B’Elanna’s. "A person who is loved just for being… for existing."</P>
<P>"That’s the way it’s supposed to be." B’Elanna kissed Seven’s nose. "Come on,
let’s give them some time alone." She led Seven back to the main room and they
sat in front of the crackling fire and held each other, unknowingly thinking the
same thoughts. Each woman was wondering what a child of theirs would look like
and hoping that the other would someday want to have children, but each still
too unsettled by the new feelings to voice them.</P>
