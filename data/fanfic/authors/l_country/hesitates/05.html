<P>When Seven of Nine was not amused, it fell heavily on the shoulders of
B’Elanna Torres. At the current moment, B’Elanna felt like there was an elephant
sitting on her back, an unammused, pregnant elephant.</P>
<P>"Why must we wait here?" Seven demanded as she looked around Cargo Bay
two.</P>
<P>"Because," B’Elanna said patiently, "The non-Starfleet components let us put
up a Borg forcefield." She spoke softly, completely calm, and with more
understanding than most would have thought she was capable of displaying. She
knew Seven was more emotional since the pregnancy, so she compensated.</P>
<P>"I understand that," Seven said as she paced. "But why us?" Seven whined
illogically. The exBorg was feeling tired, and more than a little cranky. She
hadn’t spent any time in the cargo bay since their return the day before,
choosing to forgo regeneration until they installed the new system in their
quarters. She hadn’t seen any Borg technology in two and half years, and the
once familiar equipment now made her uncomfortable. She shivered as she stared
at the green glowing console next to her alcove.</P>
<P>"It’s okay," B’Elanna said as she came up behind Seven and wrapped her arms
around her waist. "I know you don’t like it here, love, but hey, I’m a Klingon
warrior. Think I like missing all the fun?"</P>
<P>Seven turned and loosely embraced her wife. "I am being…difficult. I do not
mean to be. My emotions seem to have moved closer to the surface."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but I still love you," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven’s nose. "The
captain just wants to keep us away from the Magistrate. I have to at least
partly agree with her. I don’t want you anywhere near him."</P>
<P>"Yes, but you would like to be there for the meeting…perhaps bring your
bat’tleth?" Seven asked with a smile.</P>
<P>"Well, maybe…" B’Elanna stared down at the floor.</P>
<P>The doors to the cargo bay opened and Neelix leaned around the wall and
peered in. "Hello?" he asked. "Lieutenant? Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Neelix?" B’Elanna asked without letting go of Seven. She was still not
on active duty, and she wasn’t about to miss one second in her wife’s arms.</P>
<P>"Uh, if you’ll drop that Borg forcefield, I have a visitor for you. The
captain thinks this is the safest place." The furry Talaxian was still partially
hidden from view.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked even as she used one hand to disengaged the glowing
green forcefield and kept the other loosely wrapped around B’Elanna’s hip. She
wondered who else on <I>Voyager</I> had to be hidden from the Magistrate.</P>
<P>"Yes," Neelix said with a serious scowl. "Think you could take responsibility
for her?"</P>
<P>"Her?" Seven asked. Her eyes sparkled as she figured out who the visitor
probably was.</P>
<P>Neelix stepped into view, and then tugged Naomi Wildman beside him. </P>
<P>"Hi, Seven." The tiny child looked nervous, she hadn’t seen Seven since her
return and she wasn’t sure how to act around B’Elanna now that they were
married.</P>
<P>"Naomi," Seven yelled and ran toward her. </P>
<P>Naomi’s eyes widened, she had never seen Seven so emotional and she wasn’t
sure how to react. Seven reached her and scooped her up.</P>
<P>"Naomi, I have missed you." Seven kissed the half-Katarian on the cheek
several times and then swung her in her arms. Seven had gotten used to being
openly affectionate with Ty, and that carried over to Naomi, allowing Seven to
show the love she had always felt for the strawberry blonde child. </P>
<P>"Seven?" Naomi squeaked, taken aback by the gregarious hug.</P>
<P>Seven knelt and let Naomi’s feet touch the ground. "I thought about you
often," Seven said with her hands still holding onto the child.</P>
<P>"You did?" Naomi was shocked to see tears at the edges of Seven’s deep blue
eyes.</P>
<P>"I did," Seven said seriously. She noticed Naomi’s confusion so she took a
more familiar approach and stood up to her full height, linked her hands behind
her back and looked down on her with a serious expression. "Naomi Wildman, your
absence from my daily existence was extremely detrimental to my… emotional well
being."</P>
<P>"I missed you too, Seven." Naomi’s eyes brightened and a smile edged up the
corners of her mouth as she tried to remain serious, composed, and yes, somewhat
Borg in her demeanor.</P>
<P>"Well, I’ll be going now," Neelix said, feeling somewhat awkward. He hadn’t
seen that much emotion from Seven since One’s death, and while he liked the way
her obvious excitement to see Naomi made her features even more beautiful, he
wasn’t used to seeing it. "I have a few things to finish up before…our visitors
arrive. Naomi is wearing her arm band, as ordered." He backed out of the cargo,
waving to Naomi.</P>
<P>"Bye, Neelix," she said as she returned the wave.</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said as she watched him leave. She walked over behind
Seven, raising an eyebrow at Naomi and smirking as she remembered a small calf
on Jusari Prime. "Hey," B’Elanna said quietly to Seven," Better get that
forcefield back up."</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said as she turned. She ran her hand over B’Elanna’s arm
as she passed, making the Klingon’s smirk blossom into a smile. "I will collect
our arm bands as well," Seven said as she walked away, her eyes lingering on
B’Elanna’s as she twisted her body to maintain eye contact as long as
possible.</P>
<P>"Hey, squirt, how are you doing?" B’Elanna asked the nervous child.</P>
<P>"Fine, Lieutenant," Naomi replied. "I won’t be any trouble," she added as she
looked around the vast cargo area that was now surrounded by the green glow of
the Borg enhanced forcefield.</P>
<P>"I know that," B’Elanna said as she stepped closer. "Besides, you’re family
now." The Klingon reached down and squeezed Naomi’s shoulder and then bent to
whisper in her ear. "Seven really missed you. You know what she did? She named a
cute little cow after you, and we went out almost everyday to make sure it was
okay."</P>
<P>Naomi said nothing as B’Elanna pulled back, surprised by the revelation about
the cow and the Klingon’s use of the word family.</P>
<P>"You know what she talked about every day while we sat and watched that
little cow?" B’Elanna asked with a half smile.</P>
<P>Naomi slowly shook her head side to side.</P>
<P>B’Elanna bent down onto one knee so that she could look into Naomi’s eyes.
"You. What you might be doing, were you okay, how big were you getting…"</P>
<P>"Really?" A look of wonder covered Naomi’s face, replacing at least some of
the nervousness.</P>
<P>"Yep," B’Elanna assured her. "And we talked about how you were Seven’s
family…how much she missed you…and how, now that she and I are married, that
makes you and I family." B’Elanna saw Naomi’s face crinkle as she processed that
bit of information. "You think you can handle having a Klingon in your
family?"</P>
<P>"Half Klingon," Naomi said with a smile. "Now we have a half Katarian, a half
Borg and a half Klingon."</P>
<P>"Well, that’s quite a mix," B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>Seven joined the two, kneeling down beside B’Elanna without a word. She
carefully attached the bio-dampening band around B’Elanna’s arm, then smiled,
and leaned over to leave a quick kiss on her temple. </P>
<P>"All set," Seven said as she tucked B’Elanna’s long hair behind her ear.</P>
<P>"So, you really are married?" Naomi had just about assimilated the idea of
Seven and B’Elanna being married, but the tender affection she had now witnessed
made it quite real.</P>
<P>"Over two years," Seven said with a wistful smile. </P>
<P>"That okay with you, squirt?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Acceptable," Naomi said with a tiny smirk.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok and three other security officers led the Dengari delegates to the
conference room. Once inside, Tuvok took a seat beside Janeway while his
security team stood around the table, one behind each Dengari delegate. Janeway
was surprised when the Overseer sat next to Malok, her captain of guard,
something else that had been a surprise. The fact that such a high ranking guard
was opposed to his own government spoke volumes.</P>
<P>"Your show of force offends me, Captain," the Magistrate said as he sat
directly across from Janeway.</P>
<P>"I’m surprised that a man of you stature would be so… sensitive," Janeway
said. She was through being nice.</P>
<P>"Where are the prisoners?" he asked as he looked around the table. </P>
<P>"I think Tuvok and I can clear this matter up," the captain responded. She
wasn’t about to let Torres or Seven anywhere near the Magistrate until she was
certain the new charges were dropped.</P>
<P>"They must pay for their insolence," the Magistrate said as he pounded the
desk.</P>
<P>"Insolence?" Janeway asked. "I thought the charge was murder."</P>
<P>"The charges are none of your concern. All that remains to be seen is whether
or not you allow your crewmembers to flee justice." The ridges on his cheeks
reddened, and his hands shook.</P>
<P>"Magistrate, you mustn’t tax yourself," the Overseer said. Her face showed
sincere concern for the man she had only shown fear toward before.</P>
<P>"Justice is a taxing business," he said. "You must learn that before you can
become Magistrate." </P>
<P>"What I’ve seen here so far is not justice," Janeway said. "I’ve seen only a
petty display of power. Your actions are not worthy of the term justice."</P>
<P>The Magistrate stared at Janeway, his face turning deep crimson. The Overseer
reached over and studied him with concern. Janeway watched the interaction
carefully, noting when the Overseer stood and retrieved a pitcher of water that
had been placed on the table for the meeting. She poured him a glass and put it
in his hands, wrapping his fingers around the glass.</P>
<P>"Magistrate, what difference will two prisoners make?" the Overseer asked as
she helped him set the glass down.</P>
<P>"Anarchy," he responded. "Anarchy begins with a single act of leniency. You
must learn that, Overseer." He studied her, and shook his head. </P>
<P>"Magistrate," Janeway began. "You agreed that my people were acting in
self-defense. How is releasing them an act of leniency?"</P>
<P>His face darkened. "They defied my authority by leaving before I had ruled on
the case."</P>
<P>"Father, I released them," the Overseer said as she squeezed his arm.</P>
<P>"Do not address me so informally, Overseer," he yelled and jerked his arm
away. "You will one day hold my position, and these informalities will be your
undoing."</P>
<P>Janeway kept her face absolutely impassive, but it took all of her
self-control. She had known the Dengari were born to their positions, and
apparently the Overseer’s next promotion would make her Magistrate. It hadn’t
occurred to Kathryn that the Magistrate was related to the Overseer.</P>
<P>The Overseer looked down at the table, she sighed and shook her head, then
looked over at the Magistrate, her father; sorrow filled her eyes. "Magistrate,
I will hold your office, and when I do… I will not continue the tyranny of your
rule." Her face revealed what her words did not; she was a daughter who knew
that her father had fostered injustice in his quest for absolute control. She
studied her father and her own face went pale, almost white. It was obvious she
had never stood up to him before.</P>
<P>"You cannot step down," he reminded her.</P>
<P>"I do not intend to," she responded. "But I will not continue to condemn
prisoners to Jusari Prime."</P>
<P>Janeway watched silently. She knew the real issues were unfolding in front of
her.</P>
<P>The Magistrate shook his head. "These two prisoners mean so much to you?" he
asked.</P>
<P>"Not just these two, all of them," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>Janeway watched as the Magistrate considered his daughter’s words. Then she
saw the Overseer glance over at Malok, and saw some of the tall woman’s earlier
color return. Another piece of the puzzle fell into place.</P>
<P>"Well, Overseer," the Magistrate began, "I will allow these two to leave,
free of any charges, but… you must give me your word that you will not close
Jusari Prime. Without it, our space would be overrun by law breakers."</P>
<P>Malok sighed, and rolled his eyes.</P>
<P>"Captain Malok," the Magistrate said dangerously. "Your insubordination is
cause for your own imprisonment."</P>
<P>"Magistrate," the Overseer said softly, then changed her mind, "Father… the
time for Jusari Prime is past. Let our people move on."</P>
<P>"No," the Magistrate yelled as he slammed his fists onto the table. "I am
protecting your birthright. Without my adherence to our…" his voice trailed off
and he clutched his chest.</P>
<P>"Father?" the Overseer was at his side immediately, gently holding his arm as
she knelt beside him.</P>
<P>"Janeway to sick bay, medical emergency in conference room two," the captain
ordered.</P>
<P>"No," the Magistrate rasped. "Beam me back to my own ship."</P>
<P>Malok had moved closer to the stricken Magistrate, and was now standing
directly behind the Overseer. The tall captain of the guard was concerned, and
his hand rested on the Overseer’s shoulder.</P>
<P>Janeway turned to Tuvok, who nodded. "Janeway to the bridge, beam the
Magistrate directly to the Dengari ship."</P>
<P>Janeway felt the ship lurch to one side as she heard phasers impact against
<I>Voyager’s</I> hull. Five well armed Dengari materialized in the conference
room and trained their weapons on Janeway and Tuvok. Dehar, the guard who had
been more than a little interested in Seven, led the group.</P>
<P>"Well done." The Magistrate stood, uninjured. "Take the Overseer and Malok
into custody as well."</P>
<P>"What is the meaning of this?" Janeway demanded. The lights dimmed and the
red panels that lined the room began blinking as the sound of a Red Alert could
be heard echoing through the room.</P>
<P>"The meaning? Captain, you were the one obstructing justice," he said as he
smiled, convinced of his moral and military superiority.</P>
<P>"Father," the Overseer said as two guards moved toward her. "You can’t do
this. Can’t you see it’s wrong." She flinched when Dehar grabbed her
roughly.</P>
<P>"Let go of her," Malok yelled as he broke free from the guards holding his
arm. "She is the Overseer. You will not touch her in that manner."</P>
<P>"Malok, no," the Overseer whispered as Dehar turned his weapon of the former
captain of the guard.</P>
<P>"As I suspected," the Magistrate said with a sneer. "You speak so informally
to your underlings. You are not worthy of your title."</P>
<P>"This is all very interesting," Janeway said as she stood at the end of the
table, flanked by a Dengari guard on each side. "But if you don’t mind… I’d like
you to leave my ship."</P>
<P>The Magistrate laughed, and shook his head. "You have gall, Captain. I will
give you that. Give me the prisoners and I will be on my way." The Magistrate
began examining his fingernails, like he always did when he was feeling
particularly pleased with himself.</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow as he locked eyes with Janeway. "Captain?" he asked,
looking less than amused with the Dengari who had compression riffles trained on
him.</P>
<P>Janeway nodded, then crossed her arms. Her eyes glinted and she almost
smiled. "Waterloo," she said, her voice deep and determined. The Magistrate
stared at her, confused by the word.</P>
<P>The Dengari guards closest to Janeway were suddenly flung back against the
wall and phaser fire erupted from out of no where cutting down the remaining
guards.</P>
<P>The Magistrate watched in stunned silence as his ‘superior’ force was reduced
to a heap of unconscious bodies by some unseen force. Janeway walked over to him
and stood chest to chest with the much taller man.</P>
<P>"You may be a big fish in your little pond, but this isn’t a pond. You’re
swimming with sharks now," she explained with a smile. She turned and spoke
toward the empty area in front of her. "Well done."</P>
<P>Harry Kim suddenly appeared in front of Janeway, or at least his head did.
"Thank you, Captain. These isolation suits really did the trick."</P>
<P>"What is this?" the Magistrate demanded.</P>
<P>Janeway ignored him. "Janeway to Chakotay, report."</P>
<P>"I’m a little busy right now," he said as the sound of phaser fire echoed
behind him. "Condition Gamma White." The comm channel closed.</P>
<P>"All right people," Janeway said to the area behind Harry, whose head seemed
to be floating. "We have a hostile force on board, so we will maintain radio
silence. Let’s move out. Sweep deck by deck until we’re sure every last Dengari
has been found." She looked at Harry’s floating head. "Ensign, I need a hand
phaser." She held out her hand, then pulled it back with the phaser was now
visible.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said as he stepped beside her. "You do not have any
camouflage. It would be prudent for you to stay out of harm’s way."</P>
<P>"My ship has been boarded. I’m not about to hide like a child," she said as
she checked the power cell on her phaser.</P>
<P>"Captain?" the Overseer stepped forward, only to be shoved back by some
unseen force.</P>
<P>"It’s all right," Janeway told the air beside the Overseer. "What is it?"</P>
<P>"Our…his troops are wearing protective armor that absorbs phaser fire. You
have to adjust the settings to compensate," the Overseer explained.</P>
<P>"Treason!" the Magistrate yelled. "You will spend the rest of your…"</P>
<P>"Shut up," Malok said. "Captain, adjust the phasers to a point two seven nine
variance."</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow. "Helpful advice, but somewhat… belated. We have
already adjusted our weapons." </P>
<P>"The scan when we came on board?" Malok asked as he looked down at his own
armor plating.</P>
<P>"Correct," the Vulcan said.</P>
<P>"All right, let’s get these pests off my ship," Janeway said as she felt the
comforting weight of the phaser in her hand. "We need to get to main engineering
and secure operations. Chakotay and I already transferred bridge command to
Engineering."</P>
<P>Tuvok was not amused. Part of the reason he had agreed to allow the dangerous
plan was because he was to personally guard the captain. He had not anticipated
her charging into the fray without regard for her own safety. The Vulcan would
have been embarrassed, if he had been capable of the emotion. Of course Janeway
would fling herself into the fight. She wouldn’t send her crew into anything she
wouldn’t face herself, add to that the fact that the auburn haired captain would
see it as an adventure, and it was inevitable that she lead the charge. He
should have seen it coming.</P>
<P>"Harry," Janeway said, her voice clear and crisp and crackling with intent.
"You and the rest of your team take the lead. Those armbands mask your bio-signs
as well as the suits concealing you. Lay down a suppressing fire as soon as you
see hostile troops, wide beam set for maximum stun. Then let Tuvok and I clean
up while you move on ahead."</P>
<P>"How did you know?" the Magistrate asked as he slumped into a chair by the
table. "I didn’t tell her or Malok. I suspected they sympathized with your
crewmen."</P>
<P>Janeway gave him an almost sympathetic smile. "You don’t like anarchy… I
don’t like to lose." She watched as the arrogant man seemed to shrink into his
chair and his eyes drifted down to the tabletop.</P>
<P>"Captain, let me join you," Malok offered. "I may be able to get some of the
troops to stand down. The Magistrate and his policies are…less than
popular."</P>
<P>Tuvok caught Janeway’s eye and dipped his head a fraction of an inch, but
after spending years together, it was all the communication the two needed.</P>
<P>"All right, Malok," the captain said. "But you’ll have to be unarmed."</P>
<P>"Of course," Malok responded.</P>
<P>"And me," said the Overseer.</P>
<P>"No," Malok said as he spun. "You will stay out of the fighting. It’s too
dangerous."</P>
<P>"I will not," she said defiantly. "My father created this mess…I will help
clean it up." </P>
<P>"You must," Malok said desperately. His eyes brightened and you could almost
hear the wheels in his head turning. "You must see to the Magistrate, and you
must survive so that you can take his place."</P>
<P>"All right," the Overseer agreed. She looked over at he father, surprised to
see him no longer even looking at anyone. She had never seen him surrender so
totally to any situation. "I will stay, but you must be careful, Malok."</P>
<P>"I promise," he said sincerely. He turned toward Janeway. "What now?</P>
<P>"Well," Janeway said as she nodded toward the unconscious men on the floor.
"We finish tying them up, and then we go clean up my ship." She watched the way
Malok interacted with the Overseer, the way his eyes softened when he spoke to
her and how she reacted the same way to him. ‘<I>Ain’t love grand,’</I> she
thought as she went to help Harry secure the prisoners. The dark haired ensign’s
disembodied head was still visible as he worked.</P>
<P>"Ma’am," he said without looking up. "Just about done here… There," he said
triumphantly as he finished securing the unconscious guard. He looked over at
Janeway. "These isolation suits really did the trick, ma’am. Great idea."</P>
<P>"Let’s hold the congratulations until after the ship is secure," she said
quietly. She reached out and tested the knots on the guard’s hands. </P>
<P>"I never thought we’d be using technology from covert sociology for military
application," Harry said conversationally.</P>
<P>"Well, that’s where it came from originally, but they abandoned them because
the lifesigns couldn’t be masked," Janeway said as she moved on to the next
guard to check his restraints. "Now, with the bio-dampeners from the Hanson’s
research, we have a nice little advantage."</P>
<P>"Too bad we only had time to make a few," Harry said.</P>
<P>"Let’s just hope we made enough," Janeway said as she stood. "Harry, as much
as I enjoy seeing your head bobbing around, put that hood back on and let’s move
out."</P>
<P>His head disappeared. "Yes, ma’am," he said in a muffled voice.</P>

<P>"What was that?" Naomi asked as she was tossed to the cargo bay floor.</P>
<P>"Phaser fire, a direct hit," Seven said as she moved over to the fallen
child. She helped her up and then checked her for injuries.</P>
<P>"Damn it," B’Elanna said. She paced the cargo bay, then went to a storage
locker and took out two compression riffles and went toward Seven. "Here, take
this." She held out the riffle.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, but took the weapon in her left hand, the used her
right hand, the fully human hand, to hold Naomi against her. "Do you think the
Dengari will breach the Borg forcefield?"</P>
<P>"Can’t be too sure." B’Elanna smiled, but she wasn’t convinced. The sounds of
small arms fire could be heard in the distance. "Sounds like we’ve got a
boarding party out there." The Klingon saw Naomi’s eyes widen. "Hey, they won’t
get this far. These bio-dampening armbands mask our lifesigns, so there’s no
reason for them to even come in here. Besides, they can’t get past Seven’s Borg
forcefield."</P>
<P>"Is that true?" Naomi asked as she looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"We won’t let anyone hurt you," Seven promised.</P>
<P>Naomi nodded, then turned toward the cargo bay doors when they heard the
sounds of phaser fire getting closer. </P>
<P>"Seven? Can I hold your hand?" Naomi asked.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She smiled down at the strawberry blonde child and knelt
beside her. "Holding my hand would be insufficient." Seven picked up Naomi,
settling her onto one hip while she held the compression riffle in the other
hand. "Is this acceptable?" Seven asked her with a smile as she straightened to
her full height.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Naomi said as she clung to the tall blonde. She smiled and put her
head on Seven’s shoulder.</P>
<P>B’Elanna watched, torn between the simple enjoyment of the scene in front of
her and the fear of the approaching danger. Seeing Seven hold Naomi was a like a
preview of what life held for her, and she suddenly wanted nothing more than to
get every last Dengari and throw them into the nearest waste receptacle.</P>
<P>"Seven, I want you and Naomi to get behind those containers. I’m gonna’ cover
the door." B’Elanna pushed two of the smaller containers together, forming a
small barricade. "You two stay out of sight, no matter what happens. If they get
to me, they may not even see you two back there."</P>
<P>Seven carried Naomi over to a huge container that created its own wall and
put her down. "Stay back here, okay?"</P>
<P>Naomi nodded.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres," Seven said as she turned around. Her voice was harsh, cold
enough to freeze lava, and hard enough to cut through it once it turned to
stone. "You will <I>not </I>put yourself in harm’s way. You promised me."</P>
<P>"Seven, we both agreed that we would avoid danger… when possible." B’Elanna
moved to her wife. "Be’nal," she whispered. "Please, you have to be safe," the
proud Klingon begged as she rested her hand on Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"You do not fight fair," Seven said with tears in her eyes as she heard the
phaser fire now directly outside the cargo bay.</P>
<P>"Go back with Naomi." B’Elanna said quietly. "I’ll stay out of sight as long
as possible. Maybe they won’t even come in here."</P>
<P>"Be safe." Seven raised B’Elanna’s face and then kissed her. It was a soft,
brief kiss, to remind both women of what they were fighting to keep safe.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded.</P>
<P>"Naomi Wildman," Seven said formally as she went toward the child. "Do you
know how to operate a phaser?"</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna yelled as she ran to her wife. "She’s a child."</P>
<P>"Klingon children her age have already competed in bat’tleth competitions,"
the exdrone reasoned.</P>
<P>"A bat’tleth isn’t a compression riffle," B’Elanna countered.</P>
<P>"I can use a phaser," Naomi said quietly.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna turned.</P>
<P>"Not the compression riffles. Mom won’t let me touch them, but I can use a
hand phaser. Tom taught me how to play Velocity," she explained. "He’s not very
good." The child rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"This isn’t a game," B’Elanna said as she moved toward the half-Katarian.
</P>
<P>Seven went to the storage locker and retrieved a class one hand phaser and
set it for maximum stun.</P>
<P>"I know," Naomi said seriously. "But I can hit the target way better than
Tom…or Neelix."</P>
<P>"What the hell was Tom thinking? Doesn’t he know how dangerous Velocity is?"
B’Elanna asked, though she didn’t really expect an answer from the child.</P>
<P>Seven held the phaser away from Naomi. "Have you ever accidentally shot
yourself while playing Velocity?"</P>
<P>"No." Naomi rolled her eyes. "But Tom did," she volunteered.</P>
<P>Seven nodded toward the containers and led Naomi back behind them and out of
view. She put the phaser on a low box, so that Naomi could reach it.</P>
<P>"Do not take the phaser unless there is no other choice. Do you understand?"
Seven asked.</P>
<P>Naomi nodded.</P>
<P>Seven stood and nodded at the child, then listened intently to the sounds in
the corridor. </P>
<P>"They are accessing the cargo bay access panel. I can hear them," Seven said
as she turned to B’Elanna. "I will stay with Naomi. But remember, Be’nal, my
heart beats in rhythm with yours, so you must survive."</P>
<P>"All right," B’Elanna said. She knew it was the best offer she would get. She
kissed Seven’s cheek and jogged back to her hiding place closer to the cargo bay
door.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Captain Janeway held back as she waited for the invisible tactical team to
clear the corridor. She paused, holding her breath, then heard three short
bursts of phaser fire.</P>
<P>"Clear," Harry Kim yelled.</P>
<P>"Stay behind me." Janeway stood and moved stealthily along the wall toward
the sound of Harry’s voice. She reached four unconscious Dengari and looked
around, not knowing where Harry was.</P>
<P>Malok came up beside her, then stopped abruptly when he collided with one of
the invisible officers. "Sorry," the husky Dengari said to the air in front of
him.</P>
<P>"No problem," came Harry’s muffled reply.</P>
<P>"Okay," Janeway said as she looked at the chronometer on the nearby comm
panel. "It’s been almost five minutes since the Dengari beamed over." She tapped
her comm badge twice, then paused and tapped it twice more. It chirped after she
finished the last tap. "Janeway to Chakotay, report?"</P>
<P>*"Condition gamma blue,"* Chakotay’s said over the comm badge. The code let
Janeway know that they still had hostiles on board, but that the bridge was
secure and they could use the comm badges for vital communication. </P>
<P>She had instructed the First Officer to remain at condition gamma white until
she contacted him five minutes after any invasion. She hadn’t known for certain
what the Magistrate had in mind, but she had prepared a contingency plan for
almost any possibility.</P>
<P>"Command team alpha is continuing toward green sector," Janeway said. She
wasn’t about to broadcast her location without using code words for any Dengari
who were monitoring the comm channels.</P>
<P>*"Understood."* Chakotay’s voice was calm, and suggested that he had complete
trust in his captain, which he did. "Green sector is secure, captain, however
there are still seventeen remaining hostile on deck 6. We have a nasty fire
fight in blue sector," he added slowly. "We’re a little thin there." </P>
<P>The words hung in the air, Engineering had been designated green sector, the
most important area on board, but it was secure. Janeway had arranged for all
the crew in the vital area to wear bio-dampeners to hide the number of crew from
the invading force. She also sent six of thirteen precious isolation suits to
guard the critical systems. The news that blue sector, the area near cargo bay
two, was under heavy attack concerned her. She had opted to leave that area
unprotected by any isolation suited security officers. She had put her faith in
the Borg forcefield to keep Seven and B’Elanna out of Dengari hands. Apparently,
the Dengari had figured out enough to focus on that area.</P>
<P>"Understood," Janeway said. "Alpha command team is proceeding to blue
sector."</P>
<P>"Captain?" Malok asked as he dipped his head to her eye level.</P>
<P>She raised her eyebrows, signaling him to continue. Chakotay heard the
question over her comm badge and waited, listening intently.</P>
<P>"Can we access the shipwide communications systems?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Why?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Can I address my troops? Most of my men do not want this conflict, if I can
get any of them to step down, it will be worth the effort," he explained.</P>
<P>"All right," she said. "Chakotay, give me a shipwide channel."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna heard the doors to the cargo bay creak as they opened. She watched
as two Dengari poked their dark heads inside and scanned the room. She waited,
hoping they would choose another target when they didn’t register any
lifesigns.</P>
<P>"Nothing," the guard with the scanner said. He sighed, relieved.</P>
<P>"Pay attention, you fool," the second Dengari said. "Half of these people
haven’t even shown lifesigns. Look, a secondary forcefield. Why would they need
another forcefield if there is nothing here?" He pointed at the glowing green
shell that surrounded the back of the cargo bay.</P><I>
<P>*"Damn it,"*</I> B’Elanna thought. She should have realized the extra
protection would only serve to point out their presence.</P>
<P>"Come on," the second guard prompted as he shoved the other man forward. The
first guard scanned the room, thinking that perhaps something might appear on
his device.</P>
<P>"I’ve never seen an energy signature like this," he said as he scanned the
Borg forcefield. "I don’t think we can penetrate it. We’ll have to cut off the
energy source."</P>
<P>Three more Dengari came into the cargo bay; they looked over their shoulders
and then back to the first guard with questioning glances.</P>
<P>The first guard waved them into the room. "See if you can find the power
source for that forcefield," he ordered. </P><I>
<P>*"Double damn,"*</I> B’Elanna thought. <I>*"Couldn’t just have the two come
in here… No…that would have been too easy. I have to have half the damn boarding
party in here."*</I> She watched in silence as the newcomers worked quickly,
ripping open the appropriate panels and attacking the power conduits<I>. *"Well,
they seem to be decent engineers,"</I> * she thought as she calculated how long
it would take them to drop the forcefield. <I>*"Two minutes, tops,"*</I> she
decided. At that moment the forcefield flickered and disappeared. <I>*"Better
than I figured,"*</I> she realized. She hoped they were not as good at combat as
they were at engineering but figured that was too much to hope for.</P>
<P>Seven watched as the forcefield dropped, her heart dropping with it. The
guards moved forward slowly with their weapons held in front of them with expert
ease. They neared B’Elanna’s position and the Borg could take no more. She
glanced down at Naomi, who was pressed against her side, trembling. She couldn’t
abandon the child. She looked onto the container next to her and her eyes locked
on a hyperspanner. She grabbed it and silently drew back her arm and launched it
across the length of the huge cargo bay. Her Borg enhanced strength sent the
projectile hurling against the far wall. It impacted with a thunderous clang as
the tool took a chunk out of the wall.</P>
<P>The Dengari spun toward the sound, and B’Elanna didn’t miss a beat. She had
been timing her move until the most guards were in range of her weapon, and took
the diversion in stride. She eased up from behind her makeshift barricade and
fired on the two closest guards. The impact knocked them into the others and the
group sprawled across the deck. B’Elanna leapt over her barricade and charged
the group, wanting to take as many of them out as possible before they got back
to their feet. She roared as she opened fire on the pile of guards,
unfortunately, one guard had been lingering out in the corridor. He burst into
the room and charged B’Elanna. He had no weapon, but his mass impacted against
her with bone jarring intensity and they both crashed to the floor landing on
top of the pile of Dengari she had already stunned.</P>
<P>The sound of the struggle was too much for Seven. She could see that there
was only one Dengari still standing, and that Dengari had his hands around
B’Elanna’s throat. She pulled away from Naomi, pausing to put the hand phaser
into the child’s hands and then bolted for the conflict.</P>
<P>B’Elanna had actually enjoyed gunning down the Dengari, hoping one of them
was the guard who had let the murderous prisoners into her cell on the transport
ship. She knew they were only stunned, and it was satisfying to see their bodies
contort in pain as they were knocked off their feet. She was not enjoying the
meaty pair of hands squeezing her neck. She kneed the man in the groin, but he
didn’t even flinch, so she tried a head butt, only to find that she became a bit
disoriented by the maneuver. The Dengari had thicker skulls than she had
anticipated. She felt her strength and her vision fading when suddenly the guard
was gone. She vaguely registered his body flying across the room and hitting the
Borg alcoves. She blinked her eyes and looked up at six feet of pissed off
Borg.</P>
<P>"Get up," Seven ordered as she extended her hand. Wisely, B’Elanna took it
without a word and let herself be pulled to her feet, then swooned.</P>
<P>"Ouch," B’Elanna whispered as she rubbed her throat.</P>
<P>"You must rest," she told the Klingon. "I will restrain the Dengari."</P>
<P>The sound of a phaser blast made both women drop to the floor. B’Elanna, even
in her groggy condition, tossed herself over Seven, shielding her wife’s belly
with her own body. Seven and B’Elanna looked at the cargo bay door and saw a
Dengari guard slumped against the wall as he slowly slid to the deck
unconscious, his compression riffle clattering down in front of him. They spun
and looked across the room in time to see Naomi Wildman, her hand still extended
with the phaser pointing at the downed man.</P>
<P>"Told you I was a good shot," she said as she lowered the phaser. She had hit
the Dengari from the length of the cargo bay, a far more difficult shot than any
in a Velocity game.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway waited as Malok leaned forward and spoke into her comm badge. It was
awkward having a seven foot tall Dengari using her chest for a microphone.</P>
<P>"Dengari forces," he said calmly. "This is Malok, captain of the guard."</P>
<P>His voice was even richer and more resonant than Janeway had heard it in the
past, and she decided it must be his command voice. She nodded to him as he
shifted for a better angle at the comm badge.</P>
<P>"I am ordering you to stand down." Malok’s voice was laced with compassion
and the whip of command, a delicate balance. "We have done enough damage. Most
of you know this ‘police action’ was a fool’s folly, and that has been
rectified. The Magistrate has been removed from his position. The Overseer has
made an agreement with these people; this action is over." His voice rumbled
with intensity. "Put your weapons down and wait for the <I>Voyager</I> security
officers to escort you off of the ship. Listen to what your hearts know is
true," he added as he finished.</P>
<P>Janeway nodded at the man, impressed by his ability to show gentleness
without showing weakness. It was a trait she shared with him, but not a common
one by any means.</P>
<P>"This is Captain Janeway to all <I>Voyager</I> crewmembers. You heard Captain
Malok… I want you to continue to sweep the ship, but give any Dengari forces the
opportunity to surrender. I don’t want anyone else getting unnecessarily
injured. Janeway out."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Malok said sincerely.</P>
<P>"Let’s just hope they listened to you," she said as she squeezed his arm.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The majority of the Dengari were glad to give up, most finding the
Magistrate’s obsessive need to capture the <I>Voyager</I> crewmen a perfect
example of his abuse of power. Instead of being a somber occasion, many of the
Dengari placed their riffles on the deck and then sat and patiently waiting to
be rounded up. It was a pleasant outcome to a potentially disastrous
encounter.</P>
<P>The captain went back to the conference room and met with the Overseer,
wanting to clarify things before beaming her back to the Dengari ship.</P>
<P>"Overseer?" she asked as she entered the room. The overseer was sitting
across from her father, who was staring out the window. The Magistrate didn’t
seem to see either woman and was lost in thought.</P>
<P>"Captain, please come in," the tall woman said as she stood. "Thank you for
helping us reach a somewhat peaceful outcome."</P>
<P>"My people have a saying," Janeway said. "No harm, no foul. Although, my ship
did take quite a beating. I’m glad your people used their stun settings."</P>
<P>"It is against our way to use deadly setting when there are innocents
involved," the Overseer explained. "But I am glad you perceive no…foul. I assure
you, I knew nothing of the Magistrate’s plan."</P>
<P>"I know," Janeway said, her voice rich and disarming. "How is your
father?"</P>
<P>"I do not know," the Overseer said honestly. "I have never seen him like
this."</P>
<P>The door opened and Seven and B’Elanna came into the room. B’Elanna
positioned herself between Seven and the Dengari. Janeway hid a smile, touched
by the Klingon’s protective streak. The more she saw the two women together, the
more she knew how happy they were. It was comforting, but it didn’t ease the
ache of loneliness in the captain’s heart.</P>
<P>"Well?" B’Elanna demanded. "Is this madness over?"</P>
<P>"Yes," the Overseer said with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Good," B’Elanna said. "What about him?" She pointed to the Magistrate.</P>
<P>"He is no longer in charge," the young Dengari said sadly.</P>
<P>"Explain," Seven said as she moved closer. "You had the authority to overrule
him all along, and yet you allowed us to be wrongly punished?"</P>
<P>"I may not have agreed with the sentence you received," the Overseer
explained. "But I had to uphold the law. Once the Magistrate exceeded his own
jurisdiction, I was obligated to act."</P>
<P>"Illogical," Seven said as she moved closer to the taller Overseer. "Will you
continue to send people to Jusari Prime?"</P>
<P>"I will take over as Magistrate, if it my people’s will. Then, I will change
the way things are done." The Overseer studied her still silent father. </P>
<P>"Seven, B’Elanna, have a seat," Janeway ordered. She wanted them both to be
part of the healing process, thinking it would help the two hot tempered women
come to a faster resolution if they witnessed the proceedings. The married
couple sat behind the desk, facing the Dengari, and able to see any new
arrivals.</P>
<P>"I hope you hold no ill will," the Overseer said gently. "But I understand if
you do." She looked up when the door opened again and Tuvok came in with Dehar.
</P>
<P>"That remains to be seen," Seven answered.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Overseer said as she pointed to the newcomer. "This is Dehar,
Lieutenant of my guard. I hope that meeting under these circumstances will be
more pleasant. He was following the Magistrate’s orders when he held you at
gunpoint earlier." She felt bad for Dehar, knowing he must be feeling guilty
about beaming in and threatening the captain.</P>
<P>"A pleasure, captain," Dehar said as he extended his hand. His wrist eased
out of his thick armor plated coat sleeves revealing a thick platinum
bracelet.</P>
<P>"Pa’tach!" B’Elanna yelled as she threw her body over the desk and tackled
Dehar. She hit him with her palm, his nose crunching as it shattered. She
followed up with a fist to his throat, leaving him gasping for wheezing gulps of
air as blood poured out his nose. His superior size was useless as he suffocated
on the floor of the conference room.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna!" Janeway yelled as she tried to pull the Klingon off of the
shocked Dengari. "Let him go, that’s an order."</P>
<P>"Not until he’s dead," B’Elanna said with chilling calm as she squeezed his
throat.</P>

<P>B’Elanna watched Dehar’s eyes bulge, then she turned and snarled when Janeway
and Tuvok fought to pull her off the downed man.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna!" Janeway yelled, though she took a step back when the Klingon
barred her razor sharp incisors. "Let him go. That’s an order," the captain
said.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, your actions are illogical." Tuvok tried to pinch B’Elanna’s
neck, but her Klingon physiology kept her from passing out.</P>
<P>Seven moved around the table quickly and came up behind her wife and molded
herself to B’Elanna’s body from behind. She ignored the dangerous aura radiating
off of her spouse and slid her hands down B’Elanna’s arms until her hands
covered the Klingon’s. "Let him go," Seven whispered. </P>
<P>The blonde’s body seemed to have a calming effect on B’Elanna, and Seven’s
words did what Tuvok’s muscle and Janeway’s orders could not. B’Elanna released
Dehar and let Seven lift her off of the choking man.</P>
<P>"Janeway to the Doctor, medical emergency in conference room two. Doctor, I
need you…Now!" Janeway moved toward B’Elanna who was still wrapped in Seven’s
arms. </P>
<P>Seven was standing behind the shorter Klingon nuzzling her ear and whispering
soothing murmurs to her. "Shh," Seven whispered. "I am here. We are both all
right." She rubbed her cheek against B’Elanna’s ear.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Janeway said as she stormed over to B’Elanna, ignoring the tall
blonde who was literally holding the Lieutenant up. "What the hell did you think
you were doing?"</P>
<P>"Anarchy," the Magistrate said as he stood. "This is what your leniency will
get you. The criminals will destroy the peacekeepers."</P>
<P>Janeway ignored the man. "I’m waiting for an answer, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>B’Elanna said nothing as she stared at Dehar. She was shaking, and had broken
out into a sweat. She was in full battlelust, having realized that Dehar was the
one who had almost cost her everything, and her Klingon physiology was running
roughshod over her human half.</P>
<P>"Please state the nature…" the Doctor began as he materialized, then stopped.
He took one look at Torres, then the downed man and went to assist him. "Let me
guess," the hologram asked with a sarcastic smirk. "This Dengari here slept with
a holographic barmaid?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna growled.</P>
<P>"Shh," Seven whispered and shifted B’Elanna so that she was beside her, still
wrapped by a protective arm. "Magistrate, you speak of anarchy? That peacekeeper
of yours took a monetary inducement and allowed two prisoners to enter our cell
while we slept. We could have both been killed, along with our unborn child."
She hugged B’Elanna closer, feeling her wife’s shaking shift to slight trembles
as her body began to relax, the Klingon hormones releasing their grip. "If this
is what you offer, I for one would prefer honest anarchy. At least your people
would know what to expect," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Is this true?" the Magistrate asked as he moved toward Dehar.</P>
<P>Now that the Doctor had healed his fractured larynx, Dehar sat up. He shook
his head.</P>
<P>"He is lying," Seven said. She looked at Janeway, who suddenly looked more
understanding, and then the former drone continued. "The bracelet Dehar is
wearing belonged to one of the men who attacked us. We witnessed that prisoner
offering the bracelet as incentive to let him into our cell. Dehar refused, but
he obviously reconsidered."</P>
<P>"Dehar," the Overseer said as she moved closer. "I will find out if this is
true."</P>
<P>"She is a criminal," Dehar rasped. "My word cannot be questioned by
hers."</P>
<P>"Test the bracelet," B’Elanna said, her voice shaking. "I can bet you’ll find
that dead prisoner’s DNA."</P>
<P>The Doctor scanned the bracelet before Dehar could protest. "There are
innumerable skin flakes and DNA remnants of another person on the bracelet. I’d
say someone else wore this for several years before Mr. Dehar, and it looks like
Dehar’s DNA only began appearing within the last few days. I can compare it to
the prisoner in question if you have his DNA on file."</P>
<P>"He will be punished," the Overseer promised.</P>
<P>"I am a guard…a Dengari citizen… that woman has no rights," Dehar said, his
voice hoarse, each word causing shooting pains. He struggled to his feet,
leaning on the Doctor.</P>
<P>Seven stared at Dehar. "My wife is Klingon. When I joined with her I adopted
that culture’s creed and its customs," the former Borg said as she eased
B’Elanna out of her arms and moved closer Dehar.</P>
<P>The Klingon raised an eyebrow and watched the scene unfold.</P>
<P>"As a Klingon spouse," Seven continued, "I am well within my rights to plunge
my fist into Dehar’s chest and remove his heart." Seven raised the implant over
eye when she saw Janeway smirk. "It would be my sacred right to devour his
cardiac organ, although a coward without honor would not be a worthy meal. I
would rather feed it to my pet targh," she told the Overseer.</P>
<P>Seven walked over to Dehar who leaned away from the exdrone, sensing the
strength the young woman had at her disposal. He paled visibly and released a
tiny squeak as he realized that this was by far the more dangerous of the two
women he had wronged. Seven reached out and ran her left hand down his well
armored chest plate, then dug her Borg encased fingers into the fabric and armor
and shredded it.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes narrowed and her voice took on an almost Klingon growl. "Be
thankful I do not own a targh." Seven turned and went back to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>No one commented as Seven put her hands on B’Elanna’s shoulders and stared
into her eyes. The Klingon smiled and pressed her forehead against Seven’s.</P>
<P>"I have a targh," B’Elanna whispered. </P>
<P>"Your stuffed animal Toby does not count," Seven said, "But perhaps he
should." </P>
<P>There was a long, awkward pause. </P>
<P>Tuvok watched, his expression unchanging, but he admitted to himself that if
he had not been Vulcan, the revelation about an unborn child would have made his
jaw drop, and he also would have allowed himself to enjoy Seven’s visual
demonstration or her anger. Fortunately, he was composed enough to avoid such an
unseemly display of emotion.</P>
<P>"Well," the Doctor finally said. "I guess we won’t be changing
<I>Voyager’s</I> no pets allowed rule anytime soon."</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat. "Overseer, I apologize for my officer’s actions,
but I hope under the circumstances, you will leave her punishment to me."</P>
<P>"Under the circumstances," the Overseer said quietly, "I hope you will not
punish her at all."</P>
<P>"I will abdicate." The Magistrate sat and crossed his arms over his chest. "I
am an old man, I am too far removed from my subjects, and I have no stomach to
understand the people who serve me."</P>
<P>"Magistrate, I think it is time," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is," he responded. "But I am no longer Magistrate. That is your
title now…daughter."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok escorted the Dengari delegation off the ship, handing Dehar over to a
pair of muscular guards while the Doctor returned to sickbay. The hologram was
somewhat insulted that the captain had dismissed him out of hand. He had wanted
to hear what the captain would tell Seven after her blatant intimidation of an
alien guest after her wife had almost ripped the man’s throat out. Janeway
stayed in the conference room with B’Elanna and Seven, the three sitting quietly
at the table until the room emptied. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres," Janeway said quietly after the door hissed shut behind
the Doctor. "I’m only going to have this conversation once, is that clear?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," Torres said.</P>
<P>The captain nodded before continuing. "Lieutenant…B’Elanna, your behavior was
unacceptable…"</P>
<P>"You know what he did," Seven cut in angrily.</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway hissed, holding up her hand. "I’m letting you stay as a
privilege. I am not in the habit of dressing down my officers in front of an
audience."</P>
<P>"Understood." Seven’s eyes flashed, but she leaned back and crossed her arms.
"Thank you, Captain," she added in whisper. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I understand why you attacked him. I may have done it in your
place," Janeway said. The irony almost made the words catch in her throat. "But
when you agreed to act as a member of Starfleet, you agreed to live by our
creed." The captain glanced over at Seven, letting her know that even though she
had chosen to live by Klingon tradition, it didn’t excuse her from Starfleet’s
rules either. "If you can’t honor the oath to Starfleet, to me, then I need to
know right now."</P>
<P>"Ma’am…" B’Elanna looked into the captain’s eyes, she cared for Janeway,
looked up to her, and wanted to make her proud. "I will honor my oath to you,
and to Starfleet, but I also made an oath to Seven, and I will not break
that…for anyone or anything."</P>
<P>"And if your oath to Seven comes between your oath to me, to this ship?" the
captain asked. She had to know the answer, despite her respect for the young
Klingon.</P>
<P>B’Elanna swallowed, glanced at Seven and sighed. "Captain, Seven and I have
talked about this. She and I are a family, but we are also part of
<I>Voyager’s</I> family. We will put the ship and the crew first, as honor
demands. But after hours?" B’Elanna smiled. "After hours belong to us."</P>
<P>"I think I can live with that," Janeway said with a wry grin. Inside her
heart clenched. The after hours did indeed belong to them, and they belonged to
each other. Any fool could see that, and Kathryn Janeway was no fool.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded. "I would lay my life down to save any member of this crew…
and I know Seven would too," she said. "We are Starfleet officers…" B’Elanna
cleared her throat and smirked. "But I am Klingon too…Just don’t put me into a
small room with anyone who tries to hurt my wife."</P>
<P>"I’ll remember that," the captain said. "But I will have to toss you in the
brig… next time."</P>
<P>A wide grin spread over Seven’s face. She released a breath she hadn’t
realized she had been holding and relief sparkled in her lapis blue eyes. </P>
<P>The captain saw Seven’s expression and pinned her with a deadly glare. "Don’t
think you’re off the hook either." She leaned back and watched as the relief on
Seven’s face faded and was replaced by embarrassed remorse.</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said seriously.</P>
<P>Janeway leveled her gaze on the exdrone, but there was a cobalt glint beneath
her slate blue eyes. "Be thankful I do not own a targh?" Janeway asked as she
scrunched her face and quoted the young exdrone. The elegant captain covered her
full lips with both hands and burst into laughter.</P>
<P>Seven raised both eyebrows almost to her hairline, her outrage apparent. Her
expression and mood did not improve when B’Elanna joined the captain in a long,
much needed fit of laughter.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven found themselves confined in cargo bay two yet again, but
not as a punishment. This time it was so Seven could regenerate. With all the
commotion, there hadn’t been time to set up one of the Borg devices in their
quarters. B’Elanna was resting against her wife’s long lanky legs as the exdrone
took in her energy from the ship. The deck plating underneath her was cold, and
hard, and uncomfortable, but there wasn’t anywhere else B’Elanna wanted to be.
Seven only needed a few hours of regeneration to supplement her food intake,
which was still considerable, even though she didn’t care for Neelix’s cooking.
B’Elanna’s eyes were closed as she rested against her spouse, but they shot open
when she heard the cargo bay door open.</P>
<P>"Hi," Naomi Wildman said as she walked across the huge room. "Is Seven almost
ready to wake up?"</P>
<P>"Almost. What’s up, squirt?" B’Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>"Um, well…" Naomi stared at Seven, and her mind wandered. "Her hair is really
long," she said as she stepped up onto the dais. "Does it take her a long time
to braid it?"</P>
<P>"Sometimes," B’Elanna said seriously. "But I help her if she’s in a
hurry."</P>
<P>Naomi’s eyes widened like saucers. She couldn’t imagine the fierce Klingon
braiding anyone’s hair.</P>
<P>"Did you come to ask about Seven’s hair?" B’Elanna sat back down on the floor
and rested against Seven’s legs. She stretched her own much shorter legs in
front of her, then motioned for Naomi to sit.</P>
<P>"No, I just think it’s pretty…all braided like that," Naomi said with a
giggle. She sat in front of B’Elanna and curled her legs up Indian style on the
deck plating. "I came to see if you would come to dinner with me…tonight."</P>
<P>"What about your mom?" B’Elanna asked. She silently agreed with the child’s
assessment of Seven’s new hairstyle. It did look pretty.</P>
<P>"Oh," Naomi said as she studied Seven. "Mom said I could meet you in the mess
hall." She kept glancing back and forth between the sleeping exdrone and the
Klingon resting comfortably against her as if she were a giant Borg pillow.</P>
<P>Seven let out a quiet groan and her left hand twitched once; both actions
almost imperceptible. B’Elanna stood and then reached down and offered Naomi her
hand. The child took it and was pulled to her feet.</P>
<P>"Why don’t you ask Seven what she thinks?" B’Elanna said as she turned.</P>
<P>*"<I>Regeneration cycle complete,"* </I>the computer announced.</P>
<P>"How did you know?" Naomi asked, her voice full of wonder.</P>
<P>"After two and a half years, I just do." B’Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes and stepped out of the alcove. She stretched and looked
down at Naomi, then back at B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"Naomi came to invite us to dinner," B’Elanna explained.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Uh huh," Naomi said. "I asked Neelix to fix something special."</P>
<P>"Well then," Seven said as she took Naomi’s tiny hand, "Shall we go?"</P>
<P>"Acceptable," Naomi said. She paused, and reached up and took B’Elanna’s hand
on the opposite side. The Klingon looked surprised, but took it in stride like
any good warrior, and let Naomi pull her and Seven toward the exit. She missed
the amused smirk on her wife’s face.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The mess hall was quiet and dark when they entered, and B’Elanna went into
Engineer mode. "Why is the power out?"</P>
<P>"Surprise," yelled a chorus of voices. The lights came up and most of the
crew came pouring out of the kitchen or jumped out from behind the tables.</P>
<P>B’Elanna glared at Naomi, but there was a hint of a smile on her lips. "You
are in so much trouble, squirt."</P>
<P>Naomi giggled and let go of the two startled women. "It’s your wedding
reception," she explained.</P>
<P>"I got that, Naomi," B’Elanna said as she reached over and yanked Seven next
to her.</P>
<P>"Explain?" Seven whispered as the well-wishers stampeded toward the two.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned into Seven. "Trust me, you don’t want to know," she
whispered. "If I had known this was coming…I woulda’ brought Naomi Wildcow home
for supper."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes showed her shock.</P>
<P>"Hey, tell me if you agree with me in an hour," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, Seven, congratulations," Neelix said as he hurried over. "Naomi
and I have been working nonstop to surprise you. Did it work?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Neelix. Naomi was quite the little spy." B’Elanna smiled sweetly at
Naomi.</P>
<P>The half-Katarian child quickly found somewhere else to be.</P>

<P>The reception was in full swing, all of the crewmembers not on duty attended,
and seemed to be having a good time. It wasn’t so much because of the marriage
being celebrated, it was more the fact that the crew loved to party, and that
they had just survived a dicey alien invasion. The focus on the Dengari attack
gave B’Elanna a little breathing room. Most of the conversation kept drifting
back to the battles the crew had fought, and very few seemed focused on her and
Seven.</P>
<P>Chakotay managed to corner Seven near the buffet table. "Well, Seven, how is
married life treating you?" he asked with a warm smile. He cared deeply for
B’Elanna, he always had, and he had grown to respect and like Seven. He had been
surprised by the revelation of the wedding, but took it in stride.</P>
<P>"Commander, I am…adapting," Seven responded formally. She was completely out
of her element and all of the well wishes and emotional questions had forced her
back into her Borg responses.</P>
<P>"Hey, it’s just a question…not an interrogation." He moved closer and rested
his hand on the tall blonde’s shoulder. </P>
<P>Seven took a deep breath and sighed. "At the moment… I am…uncomfortable, but
that has nothing to do with B’Elanna," she said. Her voice sounded strained and
mechanical, except when she said B’Elanna’s name, then her lips curled and her
voice softened. Chakotay noticed.</P>
<P>"What about her?" He smiled and turned Seven to face the room of people. In
the far corner, B’Elanna was listening to Samantha Wildman explain something.
The Klingon looked mildly interested. "How are things with the two of you?"</P>
<P>Seven paused, studying him to assess what he wanted to know.</P>
<P>"Are you happy?" He smiled and squeezed her shoulder. </P>
<P>"Yes," she replied honestly.</P>
<P>"What’s your favorite thing about being married?" he asked. He wanted her to
focus on the happiness she shared with <I>Voyager’s</I> Chief Engineer, and not
the huge crowd milling around her.</P>
<P>"Everything." Seven smiled unconsciously and her eyes sparkled. "Going to
sleep beside B’Elanna, waking up next to her, knowing that we are thinking of
each other no matter where we are…" her voice trailed off as she watched her
wife. </P>
<P>Chakotay squeezed her shoulder again and leaned closer "Just think about that
and forget about everything else. This party will be over soon."</P>
<P>B’Elanna seemed to feel Seven’s gaze and she turned. She excused herself and
made her way to where Chakotay and Seven were standing.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," he said as he smiled brightly. "How are you?"</P>
<P>"Better now," she said as she wrapped her arm around Seven’s waist. "Miss
me?" she asked the exdrone.</P>
<P>"Always." Seven felt her body relax as B’Elanna rubbed the small of her back.
"What are we expected to do? What are our responsibilities for this
reception?"</P>
<P>"It’s a party," Chakotay said. "You just have to have fun."</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna chimed in. "We talk, eat some cake, maybe dance…"</P>
<P>"Cake?" Seven asked, her eyes brightening.</P>
<P>"Yes, my love…cake." B’Elanna shook her head and hoped it was a large cake.
Seven’s sweet tooth had grown exponentially since the pregnancy. And since they
didn’t have any honey on board… the cake would have to satisfy her.</P>
<P>"Speaking of cake," Chakotay said, sensing that they wanted to be alone, "Let
me go check on that."</P>
<P>B’Elanna watched him leave, her eyes tracking him until he disappeared into
the kitchen. She noticed the Captain talking with Tuvok near the kitchen, and
realized that Janeway hadn’t been over to speak to them yet. She wondered if it
was because of the discussion in the conference room, or if there was another
more personal reason.</P>
<P>"So, are you having fun?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Fun…is a relative term. I do not find the experience as distasteful as I had
anticipated." She scanned the room, her eyes stopping on Tom Paris who was
sitting at a table with Harry Kim. "However, I am…surprised that certain members
of the crew chose to attend."</P>
<P>B’Elanna followed her gaze and sighed. "We have to work together, and the
sooner Tom realizes that he and I are not going to get back together, the sooner
he can move on. Besides, I think Harry talked him into coming."</P>
<P>Seven quirked one eyebrow up. "I shall have to remember to properly thank
Ensign Kim," Seven said, but her expression suggested it would not be a pleasant
expression of gratitude.</P>
<P>"Harry’s just trying to smooth things out," B’Elanna assured her.</P>
<P>"Do you miss him?" Seven asked. She hadn’t voiced her deepest fears yet, that
B’Elanna would see Tom and realize she still had feelings for him.</P>
<P>"I care about him. I don’t want to see him hurt, but it’s friendship, nothing
more." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and squeezed it. "It’s you I love."</P>
<P>"But Ensign Paris is… more sociable, the crew likes him. I am… Borg. I do
not…fit in," Seven said quietly.</P>
<P>"If the crew is so fond of him, they can date him," B’Elanna said as she
lifted Seven’s hand to her lips. "I’ve got the one I want right here."</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven smiled. </P>
<P>"For what?"</P>
<P>"Making me feel more at ease here… loving me… tolerating my mood swings."
Seven glanced down as she said the last part. The truth was, Seven was terrified
to be in the large crowd. She had grown used to being alone with B’Elanna on the
planet, and being thrown back into the <I>Voyager</I> social setting was
overwhelming enough but being tossed into a reception with almost every member
of the crew present was testing the limits of her abilities. Add to that, that
Tom was there, studying every move the exdrone made as if waiting for a chance
to woo B’Elanna back to him, and it made for a very stressful event.</P>
<P>"It’s part of being married." B’Elanna slid next to Seven and draped her arm
around the blonde’s waist. "Now, since I have to ‘enjoy’ myself, I think you
should give it a try."</P>
<P>"I enjoy where your hand is," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna looked around the room. With exception of Tom, everyone
else seemed genuinely happy for her and Seven. "Love, these people are our
family. I know we haven’t seen them in a long time, but they are here because
they want to celebrate our union. Try to remember that."</P>
<P>"Does this mean you will forgive Naomi for ‘surprising us?" Seven gave
B’Elanna a sideways glance.</P>
<P>"Yes…I wasn’t really mad. It’s just that…it’s hard for me to… let my hair
down in front of the crew, too." The Klingon studied the carpeting, then
whispered, "I’m still adjusting to being back on board, too."</P>
<P>"I will… try," Seven promised.</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven tightened her grip around B’Elanna’s waist.</P>
<P>"Hmm?" She looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"Chakotay mentioned dancing. I would enjoy that very much." </P>
<P>"Oh?" B’Elanna asked. "You’d enjoy running your hands over my body in public?
Is that what you’re saying?" She was smiling, and shifted her body so that she
was pressing face to face against Seven, their bodies drawn together in a
familiar embrace. The contact did wonders for both of them. They each drew
strength from the other and felt their bodies relaxing.</P>
<P>"I enjoy running my hands over your body regardless of my location." Seven
demonstrated by letting her hands rest on B’Elanna’s hips. She loved the feeling
of the small Klingon’s body, soft curves and steel muscles, perfectly blended
creating a package that was perfection personified. She rubbed B’Elanna’s back,
pressing their chests together even more. </P>
<P>"I think we should ask Neelix to play some music," B’Elanna said as she let
the sweetness of the contact wash through her. "People are starting to
stare."</P>
<P>"Do you care?" Seven asked as she leaned down and nipped the Klingon’s lips.
Perhaps this ‘getting comfortable’ around the crew was not as bad as she had
first thought. If kissing B’Elanna was allowable, she would put up with a crowd
ten times bigger.</P>
<P>"Nope, I couldn’t care less," B’Elanna answered as she welcomed a kiss that
made her legs turn to liquid. Part of her was still a bit nervous, but the touch
of Seven’s lips drowned out any remaining tension. She let her weight slump
against her wife as the kiss deepened. She knew Seven would hold her up, and she
lost herself in Seven’s arms. Soon the kiss was more intense than would normally
be considered appropriate in public, but it was their wedding reception after
all.</P>
<P>A loud crash startled them and they broke the kiss and turned toward the
sound. Tom Paris was standing at a table with his drink and dinner plate
shattered at his feet. Harry had Tom by the arm, trying to hold him in place.
Tom glared at Seven, then turned and left the mess hall without bothering to
pick up his spilled meal. </P>
<P>He stalked out of the room, his mind clouded by the anger and resentment that
was tearing away at him. B’Elanna was his. Why couldn’t anyone see that? Sure,
they had a little crimp in their relationship, but that didn’t give Seven the
right to pounce on B’Elanna. It had been a misunderstanding. Sleeping with a
hologram wasn’t cheating…it was like masturbating, and he shouldn’t have to make
excuses for that, he rationalized. Now B’Elanna was throwing that damn Borg in
his face, probably just to get back at him for the holographic barmaid.</P>
<P>When Tom had agreed to come to the reception with Harry, he had expected it
to be a fiasco. He didn’t believe B’Elanna could put up with Seven for any
length of time. Sure, Seven was hot, but that only went so far. She was also the
most annoying woman on board, and a cold blooded automaton… a Borg. He half
expected the two to get into a fight before the reception even got under way.
But from the look of the kiss they had just shared, passion wasn’t a problem,
and it became very clear that if wanted to get B’Elanna back, he was going to
have to work very hard to get Seven out of the picture.</P>
<P>Seven pulled away from B’Elanna and moved toward the exit, but the compact
Klingon had her by the upper arm.</P>
<P>"Going somewhere?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Yes. I am going to have a discussion with Ensign Paris." Seven had stopped,
not wanting to yank out of her wife’s grip.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "Leave him alone. This isn’t the
time or the place."</P>
<P>"It is past time," Seven said. "He has been making derogatory comments about
our union since we returned. I intend to stop him."</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna repeated. "He’s my responsibility. Leave him to me." She could
feel Seven’s muscles ripple under her fingers as the tension in her body bubbled
to the surface. B’Elanna briefly wondered if perhaps she should have converted
to human rituals instead of introducing Seven to the hotheaded Klingon ways.</P>
<P>"We will discuss this later," Seven said. It was not a question but a
statement of fact.</P>
<P>"Okay, but right now, will you dance with me?" B’Elanna tried to distract her
wife.</P>
<P>"All right." Seven’s muscles softened as she took a deep breath and let it
out in a long sigh.</P>
<P>Neelix had come out of the kitchen in time to see the minor disagreement. He
hurried over in time to hear the end of the conversation.</P>
<P>"Did I hear you mention dancing?" he asked. "Well, now Seven… a little bird
told me that you are quite a singer. Maybe we could talk you into singing
something to your lovely wife for the first dance?"</P>
<P>"First dance?" Seven asked him, then turned to her wife. "I believe that
little bird should have kept its Klingon beak shut."</P>
<P>"Wasn’t me," B’Elanna said quickly. "The only person I told…" Her eyes
narrowed and she spun around searching the crowd. "Harry!"</P>
<P>The handsome operations officer smiled knowing that he was probably safe in
the room full of people. "Come on, B’Elanna…you tell me Seven has the voice of
an angel…that she used to sing to you under the full moons of Jusari Prime, and
then expect me not to tell anyone?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt her face warm as her cheeks blushed bright red.</P>
<P>"That was private, Harry," B’Elanna hissed.</P>
<P>The crowd pressed in to add their suggestions, all of them eager to hear the
exBorg sing.</P>
<P>Kathryn stepped forward. "You can’t keep a talent like that all to yourself,"
the captain joked.</P>
<P>"What is this first dance?" Seven didn’t seem bothered by the prospect of
singing. In fact, she seemed quite focused on the dance.</P>
<P>"It’s a tradition for the married couple to share the first dance," B’Elanna
said as she held out her hand to Seven. "It’s a way of beginning the dancing for
the evening."</P>
<P>"You said we share the first dance? Are we prohibited from dancing together
after the ‘first dance’?" Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and playfully yanked the
Klingon to her, wrapping her in her arms. This relaxing in public did have its
advantages.</P>
<P>"No." B’Elanna smiled up at Seven. "It’s a matter of who can steal us away
from each other for the rest of the night."</P>
<P>Seven slowly scanned the room, giving them her best Borg glare. "That would
be…unwise." Most of the guests seemed nervous, then Seven smirked, and the room
erupted in laughter, but for once it was not mocking. It was welcoming, they
were laughing with her for a change, and it felt good, very good.</P>
<P>"Come on," Harry yelled over the laughs. "I want to hear this angel."</P>
<P>"Here, here," Janeway said. She was being the ‘good captain,’ but inside she
didn’t know how much more she could take. It was hard enough watching them
together without seeing Seven serenade B’Elanna.</P>
<P>Neelix held out a data padd. "Why don’t you pick out something nice, and I’ll
have the comm system provide the music."</P>
<P>"I am unaccustomed to musical accompaniment," Seven said. She scanned the
choices on the padd and then paused and smiled. "I am… familiar with this one."
She gave B’Elanna a lingering gaze.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened as she considered a few songs she didn’t want to
share with the crew.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and tilted her head to one side. "You will like it," she assured
her wife.</P>
<P>B’Elanna released a breath, and relief washed over her face. Most of the crew
suddenly wanted to know which song had B’Elanna so spooked. For her part, Seven
realized that in public, she had an advantage with B’Elanna she didn’t have in
private. When B’Elanna joked with her or teased her in private, Seven was often
at a disadvantage because B’Elanna had much more experience. But here, in
public, B’Elanna seemed much more likely to blush. She made a point to be
careful not to embarrass her proud wife too much, but knew how to press an
advantage to its fullest. She also wanted to stop hiding her feelings for
B’Elanna, and this dance would be the perfect way to ‘open up.’</P>
<P>Seven handed Neelix the padd and the Talaxian ushered the couple to the small
area that had been set aside for the dance floor. He went to the comm station
and called up the musical file while B’Elanna and Seven stood together and
prepared to dance. The sound of soft guitar chords filled the crowded room and
Seven looked into B’Elanna’s eyes.</P>
<P>"I may be singing this in a room for full of people, Be’nal, but…as always…I
sing these words to you." Seven leaned down and kissed B’Elanna’s cheek and then
began to sing.</P>
<P>"<FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>Lying here with you, listening to the rain.
Smiling just to see the smile upon your face,"</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
</FONT>Seven sang as she moved her wife around the dance floor.</P><FONT
face=Arial size=2>
<P><BR></FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>"These are the moments I thank God
that I’m alive; These are the moments, I’ll remember all my life; I found all
I’ve waited for…And I could not ask for more,"</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
</FONT>the former drone continued. She smiled at B’Elanna whose eyes were
shining as she fought back tears. She had heard Seven sing this song to her many
times on the planet, but somehow hearing it in front of her friends made it all
the more real.</P>
<P>Across the room, Kathryn backed into the kitchen, touched by the display, but
feeling the need to flee. Everything she could have had with Seven was being
laid out in front of her and it was torture. She fought the urge to run, as she
had seen Tom Paris do, because she was captain, and it wouldn’t be right to
leave.</P>
<P>Seven moved one hand up to cup B’Elanna’s cheek and she caressed her tender
skin with her thumb.</P>
<P>"<FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>Looking in your eyes, seeing all I need.
Everything you are is everything to me</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>,"
</FONT>Seven sang, her voice beginning to crack, but it didn’t detract from the
beauty of the words, it added to them. Her voice was clear and in perfect pitch,
but the emotion making her voice deepen was beginning to make many of the guests
begin to cry. They hadn’t known the exBorg was capable of emotion, let alone the
absolute devotion they were witnessing.</P><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>
<P>"These are the moments, I know heaven must exist</FONT><FONT face=Arial
size=2>." </FONT>Seven let go of B’Elanna face and let her hand drift back down
to the Klingon’s waist<FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>. "These are the moments I
know all I need is this. I have all I’ve waited for, and I could not ask for
more."</P></FONT>
<P>B’Elanna’s hand drifted off of Seven’s hip and slid around and rubbed the
exdrone’s belly.</P>
<P>Seven smiled.<FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans"
size=2>"I could not ask for more than this time together. I could not ask for
more than this time with you," </FONT>she sang, and then placed her hand over
B’Elanna’s on her belly, holding her wife’s palm over their child<FONT
face="Lucida Sans" size=2>. "Every prayer has been answered. Every dream I
have’s come true. And right here in this moment is right where I’m meant to be…
Here with you here with me."</P></FONT>
<P>It was too much for Kathryn… B’Elanna’s hand cradling Seven’s belly, cradling
the child they created, a child Kathryn would never have. She had to get out,
away from everyone and everything. She moved through the crowd as Seven and
B’Elanna danced during an instrumental section of the song. She ended up
standing a few feet away from the dancing couple when Seven began singing again.
The crowd was frozen, mesmerized by the incongruity of a Borg drone using her
words to make love to a Klingon warrior in a crowded room. Kathryn was in hell,
of that she was certain.</P><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>
<P>"These are the moments I thank God that I’m alive."</FONT><FONT face=Arial
size=2> </FONT>Seven was now ignoring everyone else in the room as she watched
the love in B’Elanna’s eyes mirror her own.<FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT><FONT
face="Lucida Sans" size=2>"These are the moments I’ll remember all my life; I’ve
got all I’ve waited for…And I could not ask for more."</P></FONT>
<P>As Seven repeated the chorus, Kathryn pushed through the crowd. She didn’t
noticed the confused glances from her crew, or the fact that B’Elanna chose that
moment to shift her gaze to the movement in the otherwise still room. The
Klingon saw the captain’s expression as she hurried out the door, and for a
moment B’Elanna’s heart ached for her friend and mentor, but Seven’s words
pulled B’Elanna’s eyes and heart back.</P><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>
<P>"I could not ask for more than the love you give me ‘Coz it’s all I’ve waited
for,"</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT>Seven sang in a whisper<FONT
face=Arial size=2>. </FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>" And I could not ask
for more."</FONT> Seven leaned down and kissed B’Elanna as she finished the
song.<FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT><FONT face="Lucida Sans" size=2>"I could
not ask for more."</P></FONT>
<P>The crowd watched as the two women continued dancing as the music finally
ended. Somewhere in the back of the room, someone began to clap and it spread
through the crowd. B’Elanna blushed and rested her forehead against Seven’s
chest to hide her face, enjoying the warm softness, considering it one of the
perks of married life.</P>
<P>Neelix was speechless and had tears staining his furry, spotted cheeks. He
grumbled and rushed over to the couple and threw his arms around them both and
blubbered like a lost child. Seven didn’t know what to do with the distraught
Talaxian. B’Elanna, however, didn’t have that problem.</P>
<P>"Neelix… geeze." She shoved him away, then laughed as she wiped her eyes and
addressed the crowd. "The first one who laughs is going out an airlock."</P>
<P>The crowd responded with the expected laughs and filtered onto the dance
floor. This was the B’Elanna Torres they knew. B’Elanna tugged Seven to the back
of the room where they could both compose themselves.</P>
<P>"You really got me, ya’ know that?" B’Elanna asked as she pinned Seven to the
wall near the long window, the passing stars transformed into thousands of white
streaks.</P>
<P>"I hope I keep you," Seven said. She wiped her eyes. "I have sung that song
to you many times. I do not understand why we both reacted so strongly on this
occasion. Could it have been the addition of music?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna assured her. "It’s because all of our friends are here, and
telling me those words in front of them… just… just makes it more…"</P>
<P>"Real?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah." B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"Not all of our friends," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"I miss them too." B’Elanna sighed and leaned against Seven. "I wonder how
big Ty is getting?"</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, with the time differential, we left Jusari Prime a few hours after
he did."</P>
<P>"That’s true." B’Elanna smiled. "So… even with the delays the Dengari caused,
we should catch up with them soon."</P>
<P>"If they are going to Nador Omega as planned, they will be on our projected
flight path," Seven said happily.</P>
<P>"I can’t wait. Did I mention? I really love you." B’Elanna looked behind
Seven, noticing that many of the guests were staring. ‘<I>Eat your hearts
out,</I>’ B’Elanna thought. <I>‘She’s all mine.’ </I>Then she thought about the
captain and the look of devastation on her face when she ran from the room and
her smile disappeared.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven noticed the shift in B’Elanna’s mood and didn’t like the
sorrow covering her wife’s beautiful features.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned into Seven, squeezing her in a tight embrace. "Tom’s not the
only one who’s hurting over this."</P>
<P>"By <I>this</I>, you mean us? Am I correct?" Seven asked as she rubbed
B’Elanna’s back. She was thankful that the crowd seemed to be leaving them alone
for the moment.</P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna leaned back and looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"Who else is in love with you?" Seven’s concern was genuine, but there was a
hint of jealousy in her tone.</P>
<P>B’Elanna allowed a tiny smile. "Not me, love."</P>
<P>"Elaborate." Seven’s face showed her confusion. She leaned around B’Elanna
and scanned the crowd but didn’t see anyone who looked like they were in love
with her.</P>
<P>Naomi chose that moment to interrupt. B’Elanna wasn’t sure she if was upset
or relieved, but she smiled at the child and moved to stand next to Seven.</P>
<P>"Gosh, Seven, I didn’t know Borg could sing." Naomi reached out and tugged on
B’Elanna’s jacket. "Can Klingons sing, too?" She had first noticed the leather
coat when the three had been locked in Cargo Bay two, but hadn’t felt
comfortable enough with the Klingon to ask about it then, let alone touch
it.</P>
<P>"No, squirt," B’Elanna said. "Not this Klingon at least."</P>
<P>"How do you know it is not my human half that allows me to sing?" Seven
tilted her head and raised an eyebrow at Naomi.</P>
<P>"Well, because… It was perfect," Naomi rationalized. "Human’s aren’t perfect,
Borg are."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Naomi Wildman," Seven said in her most Borg tone.</P>
<P>"Pretty good logic, kid," B’Elanna complimented.</P>
<P>Naomi scrunched her face, finding the statement somewhat distasteful.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked</P>
<P>"I am very adult, B’Elanna. Everyone says so." Naomi seemed almost offended
to be called a kid.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna knelt in front of the half Katarian. "Do you get lonely being
the only kid?"</P>
<P>"Mom says the crew will start having kids in a few years so <I>Voyager</I>
can become a generational ship." Naomi looked down at the floor. "I just have to
wait."</P>
<P>"That’s not what I asked." B’Elanna lifted Naomi’s chin. "Do you get
lonely?"</P>
<P>"Sometimes…"</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked up at Seven. The exdrone smiled and knelt next to B’Elanna so
that she could also be on Naomi’s level. "Naomi?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Hmm?" Naomi bit her lip.</P>
<P>"You will not have to wait much longer." Seven smiled.</P>
<P>"Huh?" Naomi looked at Seven like she had just sprouted new implants out of
her forehead.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and then sighed. "Naomi, you aren’t gonna be the only kid
for very much longer. Seven and I are gonna’ have a baby."</P>
<P>"Really?" Naomi’s eyes and mouth shot open.</P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"So…" Naomi began calculating all the possible data. "So…if it’s your
baby…<I>and</I> Seven’s…it’s gonna’ be a girl, right?"</P>
<P>"Uh…yes," B’Elanna said, drawing out the words.</P>
<P>Naomi rolled her eyes. "B’Elanna, I’m not a little kid. My Mom is in the
Biosciences. If you two both gave genetic material, the baby has to be a girl.
Neither one of you has a Y chromosome. Duh."</P>
<P>"Duh," Seven said as she crossed her arms and smiled at B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Baby?" Harry Kim squeaked from behind Naomi. "You’re gonna’ have a baby?" he
said loudly. B’Elanna and Seven stood as several of the guests turned and came
closer.</P>
<P>Chakotay cleared his throat. "That wasn’t in your report on the away
mission," he said calmly.</P>
<P>If you asked anyone on board, they would say that Tuvok was immune to
curiosity and gossip. The Vulcan was not, he simply knew how to bide his time
until the perfect moment arose to ask questions. It was time to get the answers
to the questions he had been posing since he had learned of the child’s
existence.</P>
<P>"Congratulations," the Vulcan said. "Who is carrying this child?" He wasn’t
known for his tact.</P>
<P>"I am." Seven smiled when B’Elanna’s hand drifted over and covered her belly.
Any mention of the child seemed to force B’Elanna’s hand onto Seven’s belly, and
the exdrone loved it.</P>
<P>"A baby?" Neelix asked, wonder filling his voice. He went directly to Seven,
a smile covering his furry face. "A new life… oh, how wonderful." He reached for
Seven’s belly, then stopped. "May I?" he asked.</P>
<P>Seven seemed confused then realized that he wanted to touch her stomach the
way B’Elanna always did. She nodded slowly. "Proceed."</P>
<P>B’Elanna moved her hand and smiled at him. He looked like a child on
Christmas morning.</P>
<P>Neelix quickly got on his knees so that his face was at the same level as
Seven’s belly. He placed his hands on each side of her navel and his grin got
even wider until it threatened to split his face.</P>
<P>"Well, hello there, little one," he said to Seven’s belly. He looked up at
Seven, then B’Elanna. Around them the crowd was growing. "You have two wonderful
mommies waiting to meet you," he continued, his hands warm and gentle on Seven’s
stomach. "I’m kind of excited myself. It’s been a long time since I’ve held a
baby. Not since little Naomi was a baby. Now, you just take your time in there,
don’t let old Neelix rush you, but anytime you need a story… or to be tucked in,
you just call Neelix." He stopped, suddenly aware that the entire room of people
was staring. He looked up at Seven who had a soft smile tugging at the corners
of her lips. "Guess you think I’m pretty silly," he said as he stood and backed
up, but the smile didn’t leave his face.</P>
<P>"On the contrary," Seven said. "I was just thinking how much you remind me of
B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Seven," the Klingon said, trying to hush the exdrone.</P>
<P>"I cannot tell you how many nights I have awakened to the sounds of B’Elanna
talking to the baby," Seven continued despite the blush creeping up B’Elanna’s
face. "I worry that she will suffocate. I find her under the blankets deep in
conversation with our child. She insists it is a perfectly normal behavior."
Seven smiled at B’Elanna, enjoying her mate’s squirming.</P>
<P>"Of course it is," Neelix assured her.</P>
<P>"It is normal behavior for Mister Neelix," Tuvok said. "It has yet to be seen
if it is normal behavior for the rest of the population."</P>
<P>The crowd laughed and B’Elanna wanted to crawl into a hole, under a rock, or
at least out an airlock, but she was equally drawn to the idea of hiding under a
warm blanket with the cause of her torment. She decided that was the most
appealing prospect, and yanked Seven to her.</P>
<P>"Honey," she whispered sweetly, making sure it was loud enough for anyone
close by to hear. "When we get home tonight… you can just forget about me
telling the ‘baby’ a bedtime story and rubbing your back."</P>
<P>Then Seven surprised B’Elanna, and used her secret weapon. Seven frowned, let
her eyes take on a doe like quality and made her lower lip tremble, a move
B’Elanna had dubbed the Borg pout maneuver, and, like always, it worked.</P>
<P>"Oh, all right…you can have your back rub," B’Elanna relented instantly.</P>
<P>Seven clicked the pout maneuver up a notch, tilting her head to the side.</P>
<P>"And the bedtime story," B’Elanna added.</P>
<P>"Whipped," Harry said as he shook his head.</P>
<P>"Curious," Tuvok said with a raised eyebrow. "I did not think adults indulged
in bedtime stories."</P>
<P>This time is was Seven who blushed. Those around her thought it was because
she had been caught in childlike behavior, but they were mistaken. She was
thinking about the frightening tales B’Elanna would tell her, and the unique way
the Klingon would…calm her. Wonderful ways, starting with bone melting kisses
and ending with Seven sprawled across the bed in a hyperventilating puddle.</P>
<P>Seven turned to address the Vulcan. "I must learn these tales so that I can
share them with our child."</P>
<P>"Of course," Tuvok said…obviously unconvinced.</P>
<P>The rest of the evening was a happy blur, the highlight of which was the
cutting of the cake. After convincing Seven that the huge cake wasn’t one big
Borg maternity snack, B’Elanna had enjoyed feeding a small slice to her wife.
The crowd had been somewhat disappointed that the two women chose to forgo the
traditional cake fight, but they seemed honestly pleased with the new sides they
had seen of both women. When the last of the guests filtered out, they all saw
Seven as much more human, and B’Elanna as much less…volatile. No one commented
about Tom storming out or the captain’s hasty exit. Although, most assumed
Janeway’s departure was related to ship’s business.</P>
