<P>Seven leaned into the toilet and promptly lost the contents of her stomach.
B’Elanna knelt beside her and held Seven’s thick blonde braid out of the way and
then wiped Seven’s face with a wet towel as soon as she stopped retching.</P>
<P>"Easy," B’Elanna said as soon as Seven leaned back against the wall.</P>
<P>"<I>Your</I> child is obviously doing some Klingon dance on my stomach,"
Seven accused. She rolled her head back against the wall and let out a
whimpering sigh.</P>
<P>"How come when you feel great she’s <I>our</I> child, and when you’re tossing
your cookies, she’s <I>my</I> child?" B’Elanna pressed the cool cloth to Seven’s
forehead.</P>
<P>"Do <I>not</I> mention cookies," Seven demanded, then leaned forward as if
deciding whether or not to throw up again. The urge passed and she rested
against the wall again.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," B’Elanna said. She was biting the inside of her cheek to keep
from laughing, which experience had proven, was not a good idea. The only thing
worse than a sick Borg was a pissed off and sick Borg.</P>
<P>"My memories from the Collective did not include this…this…morning sickness,"
Seven whined.</P>
<P>"Well, from what my mother told me," B’Elanna explained gently. "It only
lasts for the first trimester…usually."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes popped open. "The first trimester! Three months of this?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and looked for a way to escape the tiny room before her wife
became really angry.</P>
<P>"You knew this? And you did not tell me?" Seven stood up, now more pissed off
than sick, that and the fact that her breakfast had already been ejected.</P>
<P>"It’s different for each person," B’Elanna offered. She watched as Seven’s
eyes teared up, her hormones raging. "I’m sorry, love," B’Elanna said and opened
her arms. </P>
<P>Six feet of blonde Borg filled her arms, knocking her back several steps and
then she began crying. It was going to be a long three months.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>By lunch time, Seven was convinced she was dying of starvation… dying of
starvation and it was all B’Elanna’s fault. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>By dinner, the sun, the moon, and the stars all rose and set for B’Elanna,
and Seven was committed to proving it to the Klingon. This was one aspect of
Borg mood swings that B’Elanna enjoyed because in addition to Seven’s
declarations of undying love, the tall blonde was incredibly amorous.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Luckily for B’Elanna the roller coaster ride smoothed out after two months,
too very long months.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>They prepared for the upcoming beam out, excited at the prospect of getting
back to the <I>Delta Flyer</I> and heading out in search of <I>Voyager</I>. At
the beginning of their last month they stopped hunting at all. They wanted to
use up all of the meat they had in storage, the animals of the valley had
provided well for them, and they didn’t want to leave any meat unused. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The storeroom was empty by the last week, so B’Elanna went out each morning
to bring down a rabbit or sometimes a duck from the lake. Seven had initially
wanted to accompany her, but the sight of the fresh kill always made her sick.
The morning sickness had disappeared early in the second month, but the sight of
blood was just too much for her. It was easier for both women if B’Elanna went
alone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked as she came into the cabin from her morning hunt.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven asked from the kitchen. She came out, her hands covered with
some sticky substance.</P>
<P>"You up for a walk?" B’Elanna asked. She knew that Seven missed their walks
in the valley when they had hunted together. "What’s that?" B’Elanna asked,
pointing at the dripping mess on Seven’s hands.</P>
<P>"Honey," Seven answered. "I was making tea, and it was not sweet enough, and
well…" her voice trailed off.</P>
<P>"You hate ‘bee spit,’" B’Elanna said as she moved closer. She could see the
honey at the edges of Seven’s full lips.</P>
<P>"I know, but I believe this is one of those cravings you warned me about."
Seven met B’Elanna half way, then paused at looked down at her sticky hands. Her
blue eyes then locked on B’Elanna and lit up with mischief.</P>
<P>"Don’t even think it," B’Elanna ordered when she saw what Seven was
planning.</P>
<P>"You are not the Queen of me," Seven said with a wicked grin and moved
closer. "You cannot control my thoughts."</P>
<P>"Please, Seven… not on my jacket…" the Klingon cherished the chocolate brown
jacket Seven had given her. "Be’nal?"</P>
<P>"Oh, all right," Seven said and held her arms away from her body. "But I
require a kiss as payment."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and moved forward, then paused to make sure it wasn’t trap.
Convinced, she leaned into her taller wife’s chest and kissed her. "Mmm,"
B’Elanna moaned. "You taste sweet." She licked the remaining honey from the
edges of Seven’s mouth. "Maybe we should bring some of that to bed with us
tonight."</P>
<P>"An intriguing, though somewhat messy thought. Would you settle for the rug
in front of the fireplace?" Seven nodded to the location in question.</P>
<P>"Yes. Yes, I would." B’Elanna kissed her again, sliding her hand along
Seven’s arm and grasping her wrist and bringing her honey covered hand to their
mouths. They licked the honey off together, then cleaned off the other hand in
the same fashion.</P>
<P>"I believe I underestimated my enjoyment of honey," Seven said when they were
finished.</P>
<P>"Told you," B’Elanna said. "Are you up for a walk?"</P>
<P>"I would like that," Seven said with a coy smile. "I will get my cloak."</P>
<P>They walked out along the lake and across that valley to the huge meadow.
B’Elanna led the way and finally stopped under a tall tree and sat, then pulled
Seven down between her legs.</P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna whispered.</P>
<P>Seven settled in front of B’Elanna and leaned back using her as a Klingon
pillow. She felt B’Elanna’s smaller hands wrap around her and rest on her belly.
It was a familiar position. Every night in bed B’Elanna’s hand would migrate to
Seven’s belly and stay there the entire night, and Seven loved the feel of it.
After several minutes under the tree, B’Elanna leaned forward and placed a
lingering kiss on Seven’s ear.</P>
<P>"Over there," B’Elanna whispered and nodded off toward the meadow.</P>
<P>Seven looked over and saw reddish blonde movement through the trees. The
calf, Naomi Wildcow, had grown into a beautiful heifer. She meandered out of the
trees, then turned back and made a deep braying sound. A tiny calf came prancing
out of the tree cover and trotted over to Naomi.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened and she pulled B’Elanna’s arms tighter around her. They
sat in silence and watched the cow and new calf enjoying the sun, Naomi chewing
contentedly on the grass, the calf romping around his mother. Occasionally the
calf would make his way back to the cow and nudge her bulging udder and then
drink aggressively before running off again. After a while, they moved on, but
B’Elanna and Seven remained where they were for some time.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven finally said. She turned and kissed B’Elanna, pressing her
into the bark of the tree. </P>
<P>"You’re welcome." B’Elanna helped Seven stand by pushing her shapely behind
from below, using the opportunity to enjoy the firm buttocks.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven asked as they walked back to the cabin.</P>
<P>"Yes?" B’Elanna held Seven’s hand on one side, and carried a crossbow in the
other. She didn’t want to surprise any bears without some serious firepower.</P>
<P>"Did you see the way the calf…ate?"</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna drew the word out, not quite sure why Seven was asking.</P>
<P>"Will your breasts get that…full?"</P>
<P>"Kahless, I hope not." B’Elanna laughed and tugged Seven closer.</P>
<P>"Will our daughter be as… eager when she eats?"</P>
<P>"I… I don’t know," B’Elanna said. Her dark face suddenly went pale as she
imagined a baby attacking her chest the way the calf had rammed the mother and
lifted her hind quarters off of the ground… and cows were herbivores with flat
teeth, Klingon’s were known for there sharp incisors.</P>
<P>"I am glad you will be handling that particular chore," Seven said
sweetly.</P>
<P>"Oh…god." B’Elanna stopped and Seven had to tug her along. Seven didn’t
volunteer that she had never once seen Nara’s breasts that swollen and that Ty
had always seemed quite gentle when eating. She would let her wife think about
it for awhile…perhaps until she remembered it for herself. After all, if
B’Elanna could neglect to mention morning sickness, Seven could neglect to
mention Nara telling her that breast feeding wasn’t uncomfortable.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The beam-out came thirteen minutes after Seven had anticipated. She and
B’Elanna had been sitting together in front of the fireplace, exactly where
Tach, Nara, and Ty had beamed out from. Whereas Tach had been clutching his
toolbox, B’Elanna was wearing the jacket Seven had given her with her cherished
knife tucked into an inside pocket. Seven had wrapped herself in the Bearskin,
determined to take the precious fur with them.</P>
<P>They materialized on a large transporter platform and turned to see three
fully armed guards pointing formidable looking compression rifles at them, but
they recognized one of the men.</P>
<P>Malok stepped forward. "Your sentence has been completed, but you must remain
in custody until we reach the space station." He motioned toward B’Elanna with a
scanning device. "Place your weapon into the waste unit on the wall and the
animal skin as well."</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said firmly, but she made no movements toward them, actually
holding her hands over her head. "Please, you can take our things until we get
back, but please don’t make us destroy them."</P>
<P>The other two guards started to move forward, but Malok stopped them with a
shake of his head, then he lowered his weapon. "I will handle these two," Malok
said. "Remain here and continue subject retrieval while I take them to the
holding cell." He walked to B’Elanna and held out his hand. His eyes were
trusting, and he didn’t bother to point the weapon at her again. She nodded and
slowly reached in and took the large, very deadly knife from her jacket and
handed it to him in its leather sheath.</P>
<P>"Thank you," B’Elanna said quietly "It’s a gift from my wife." She turned to
Seven and the exdrone took the fur off of her shoulders and moved toward
him.</P>
<P>"Shh," he said. "Keep the nature of your relationship a secret until you are
out of custody. There are those here who would not approve," he explained out of
the other guards’ range of hearing.</P>
<P>"Because we are both female?" Seven handed him the fur, and stood close to
him. </P>
<P>"No," he said with a confused look. "Because most who come back are not
nearly as…happy as you two, the other prisoners especially, and even some of the
guards would be…jealous. Our lives are not happy ones," he whispered and ushered
them to the door.</P>
<P>"Hey," one of the guards yelled as they were almost out of the door. He was
short for a Dengari, just barely six feet tall, his face was hard, and his eyes
mean. "Malok, don’t take too long to…’<I>settle’</I> them. Although I know I
would with that golden haired one."</P>
<P>Malok stopped, his eyes flashing, he spun and faced the man. "Dehar, you
would do well to remember your position. You keep the law, but you are not
immune to it. You would also do well to remember that <I>former</I> guards do
not generally survive their sentences on Jusari Prime."</P>
<P>"Understood, sir," Dehar said quietly while the remaining guard turned away
to hide his smile.</P>
<P>Their cell was not as large as the one they had been locked in when they had
been held before sentencing. The bunks were barely big enough for one, and the
room was much smaller, but it didn’t matter, they were almost free. Malok had
put them into the cell and warned them to avoid speaking to the other prisoners,
explaining that they had retrieved several men who had just finished extremely
long sentences for unpleasant crimes. They didn’t argue. Their cell was one of
many in a long room, and the walls were solid, except for the front where the
forcefield was. They could see completely into the cell directly across from
them, as well as partly into several cells in each direction. It was not a
pleasant view. </P>
<P>Seven sat on one bunk, with B’Elanna’s jacket under her; the Klingon had
insisted that the hard bunk was too uncomfortable for her without it. B’Elanna
leaned against the wall near the forcefield.</P>
<P>"Do you think I am getting fat?" whispered Seven. She was leaning back and
studying her belly. Even three months pregnant, the lanky blonde was stunning.
Her stomach had only barely begun to show any signs of weight gain, and most
would not have noticed anything.</P>
<P>"You are not fat," B’Elanna said as she came over and sat next to her. "My
god, Seven, you’re thinner than I am."</P>
<P>Seven nodded, but continued frowning at her leather pants. </P>
<P>B’Elanna followed her gaze, mesmerized by her wife’s beauty. The pants were
dark brown, almost black, and were looser fitting than her biosuits on
<I>Voyager</I> had been, but seemed much more alluring. The leather was snug,
but not tight enough to reveal each curve, merely hinting at the treasures
beneath the fabric. Her top was cream colored leather and was designed like a
man’s dress shirt. B’Elanna loved the way it curved over Seven’s full breasts
and then tapered at the waist.</P>
<P>"You are staring," Seven said without looking up from her belly.</P>
<P>"Can’t help it." B’Elanna had a very non-Klingon grin plastered on her face.
She continued gaping at Seven, and her eyes wandered up to the long braid that
hung down her left side almost to her navel, the hair like honey spun into silk.
"I love you," she whispered.</P>
<P>"As do I you," Seven said. A smirk covered her features as she brought her
eyes up to meet B’Elanna’s eyes. The Klingon’s eyes were dark and bright, and
spoke of the promise their future held. Movement behind them broke the moment.
They turned to see Dehar bringing two men into the holding cell across from
them.</P>
<P>"Well, now," one of the prisoners said, stopping and staring at Seven. "What
do we have here? How did that golden one escape me for all these years?"</P>
<P>"Move along," Dehar said, his own eyes lingering on Seven. B’Elanna stood and
blocked their view of her wife, her hands defiantly on her hips.</P>
<P>The prisoner held his arm out to Dehar revealing a thick bracelet made of
white gold, or perhaps platinum. "This would look very nice on you," he said to
Dehar. "This cell looks a little…dingy. My friend and I wouldn’t mind sharing a
cell with others," he let his gaze move toward Seven.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was at the forcefield in a single leap. "He does that and you’ll
part with more than that bracelet." B’Elanna smiled like a shark looking into a
tank of guppies, her sharp Klingon incisors gleaming in the light.</P>
<P>Dehar said nothing and shoved the man into his cell, but as he walked away,
there was something in his movements that made B’Elanna’s skin crawl.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The wait was longer than Seven had expected, with prisoners being shuffled in
every few minutes. She finally gave up and stretched out on the bunk and tried
to sleep. She hadn’t been able to regenerate the morning before they had left,
and the pregnancy made her tire easily. B’Elanna perched on the edge of the bed
next to Seven’s head, shielding her long blonde hair from view as best she
could. After a few more hours, B’Elanna balanced on the bed beside Seven. The
Klingon slept, her muscles couldn’t relax because she was hanging off of the
side of the bunk, but moving to the other bunk never entered her mind. As
B’Elanna slept, her hand made its way behind her to find Seven’s belly, and once
her hand molded to the soft, warm curve, she drifted off. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna wasn’t sure what it was that woke her, but she was off of the bunk
and leaping toward something before her eyes were fully open. She collided with
a dense body and felt a sharp pain in her ribs.</P>
<P>Seven was up a moment after B’Elanna. She had reacted instinctively,
uncurling from the bunk to her full height. She saw movement out of the corner
of her eye, but was distracted by the scene in front of her. She watched in
horror as her wife struggled with the prisoner who had spoken to them earlier.
Her Borg hand shot up but it was too late. She felt something hard and
unforgiving hit her face, then felt a rush of warmth as her own blood gushed
from her brow down onto her chest. She pivoted, her hand grabbing with Borg
precision and she heard the satisfying crunch of her attacker’s neck breaking.
She didn’t even look at the man who had hit her, letting his lifeless body slump
to the floor as she went to help B’Elanna.</P>
<P>B’Elanna had the man in a death grip of her own. Both of her hands were
digging into his face and he was screaming. Seven’s fist crossed within a
centimeter of B’Elanna’s cheek as it shot past her from behind. Her Borg fist
caught him squarely in the nose propelling him into the forcefield.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna? Are you all right?" Seven ignored her own bleeding face as she
searched her wife for injuries.</P>
<P>"You’re hurt," B’Elanna said, reaching to stop the flow of blood from a deep
gash over Seven’s eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Irrelevant," Seven said harshly. Her expression was completely Borg, cold
and focused as she reached under B’Elanna’s arm and pulled back her own blood
stained Borg hand. "You are bleeding. I must find something to make a bandage
with."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened, and Seven knew without turning that the man behind
her had regained consciousness. She would see that he never woke up again. She
stood and turned, letting her rage completely loose for the first time in her
life. He gripped a crude shiv in his fist. His nose was oozing blood and his
eyes showed the anger that was churning inside him.</P>
<P>"I’m going to enjoy making you watch me kill her," he said to Seven as he
pointed B’Elanna. "Then I’m going to make you wish you were dead." </P>
<P>"Doubtful," Seven said. She stepped forward and waited for him to make his
move.</P>
<P>He lunged at her with surprising agility for a man of his size, but he had
not counted on her Borg reflexes and superior strength. She caught him by the
wrist, just below the shiv he was holding, and crushed the bones like a
Styrofoam cup. He would have dropped to his knees from the pain, but Seven
lifted him by the shattered appendage, dangling him like a fish on a line. The
last thing he saw was the look of absolute unconfined rage in her lapis blue
eyes. All of the power and speed available to Borg drones was now aimed at the
man but it was not held in check by the logical hive mind, it was raw, untamed
energy turned loose, like unleashing a hurricane. But this hurricane had free
will, free will intent on his destruction. </P>
<P>"No…" he begged as she flung him into the wall as if brushing dust from her
sleeve. She pounced on him before he even hit the floor and gripped him by the
neck and squeezed his throat until her fingers met. She climbed off of him and
returned to B’Elanna. The Klingon was bent over, trying to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven eased her up so that she could look at her. B’Elanna was pale,
her face was covered in sweat, and her were eyes glazed over. "B’Elanna, talk to
me," Seven demanded.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna whispered as her body went limp.</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway prowled the observation room like a caged tiger, a tiger that
hadn’t eaten in days and had several thorns in her paws. The few hours of sleep
the night before had been filled with nightmares about B’Elanna and Seven. She
had awakened somewhat rested, but it only served to add fuel to her anger
because now she was rested enough to lash out.</P>
<P>"This is ridiculous," Janeway said angrily. "Their sentence ends today, why
can’t we see them?"</P>
<P>"Because," the Overseer explained, "Until they have been checked for injuries
and cleared to leave, they are still in our custody, and the Magistrate will be
here at any moment."</P>
<P>"I have my own Doctor," Janeway said. Her voice was calm, but her slate blue
eyes were beginning to show signs of the rage bubbling to the surface. It would
not have been a good day for Janeway to play poker.</P>
<P>"Please, it is only a while longer," the Overseer asked.</P>
<P>"Captain, please sit down," the Doctor said as he put his hand on Janeway’s
shoulder.</P>
<P>"I tired of waiting," Janeway told the hologram as she shrugged her shoulder
out of his grasp. "I would think that you would want to be there to treat them
as soon as possible," she accused.</P>
<P>"Believe me, I do. But getting kicked off of the space station won’t help
matters." The Doctor looked away, giving Janeway his best insulted sigh.</P>
<P>"How much longer?" the Captain demanded.</P>
<P>"The ship is docking. It will not be long," the Overseer said. Her face
showed genuine concern.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor began, "I’ve been upgrading my program, with an
emphasis on post traumatic stress disorder and internment mentality."</P>
<P>Janeway sighed, and pinched the bridge of her nose. "Doctor, the last time
you tried to add a psychiatric subroutine, you ended up on the holographic couch
yourself."</P>
<P>"I am aware of that," he said indignantly. "I did not alter my matrix. I have
been studying every available text on the subjects. I am learning how to treat
them, going back to school you might say."</P>
<P>"I don’t think your playing Freud is going to help matters," Janeway said.
She knew it was unkind, but the hologram’s self-inflated attitudes usually
ending up hurting people.</P>
<P>"I assure you, Captain, my studies have given me excellent insight into the
issues at hand." The Doctor went to the window and stared in at the empty
medical facilities and then turned. "I had to try something, Captain. I was
simply out of my professional league." It was an admission he had never made
before.</P>
<P>"I hope it’s enough," Janeway said. She thought of Seven and B’Elanna on the
prison planet for two and a half long years, and her patience ended. "Overseer,
what difference could a few minutes possibly make to your people? After all
the…inconsistencies with what you’ve told me, I think a little flexibility would
be a good show of faith. Please, let my Doctor and I be present for the medical
check up."</P>
<P>The Overseer seemed torn, then lifted a small device from her neck and
checked it. Apparently it was a timepiece. "The Magistrate will be here within
the hour. We must hurry."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Doctor studied the various medical devices in the facilities like a
Ferengi in the Great Treasury, moving excitedly from one device to the next.</P>
<P>"You have an optical regenerator?" the hologram asked, as he picked up a
small hand held device. "The Federation has only begun to work with these."</P>
<P>"It is a useful tool," said Dr. Alteron. He smiled and seemed intrigued by
the hologram, patiently answering each question.</P>
<P>Janeway paced for several minutes before finding a quiet corner to stand
where she was near the doorway. She wanted to be close when Seven…and B’Elanna
came in. </P>
<P>The door opened, and two guards came in half leading, half carrying Seven of
Nine. Her fully human eye was swollen shut with a ragged gash from her eyebrow
over her forehead and disappearing into her hairline. She kept turning her head,
which made it difficult to get a clear look at her injuries.</P>
<P>Janeway’s knees felt like they had turned to water and her stomach clinched
as looked at the damage Seven had endured, worse yet, she had probably been
enduring similar hardships the entire time.</P>
<P>"Let me go," Seven said as she yanked one of the guards back around in a half
circle.</P>
<P>"Our doctors are doing their best," Malok said gently. He was on Seven’s
left, his grip more supporting than restraining.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Janeway said tentatively. Her voice was deep and rich and full of
love, even the Dengari doctors paused to look at the captain.</P>
<P>Seven spun, not believing her ears, to see Captain Janeway standing five feet
away. "Captain? You waited?" Relief washed through her; <I>Voyager</I> had
waited. Seven tugged her arms, and the guards released her. She went toward the
captain who had opened her arms.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled as Seven rushed toward her, but just before their bodies met,
Seven’s eyes widened when she saw something off to the captain’s left.</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Seven yelled, and sprinted past Janeway. She grabbed him by the arm
and yanked him toward the door where she had just entered. If he had been flesh
and blood, that flesh would have been ripped when she yanked his arm with enough
force to dislocate his shoulder. Being a hologram, it merely struck him as a
trifle rude.</P>
<P>"Seven, I’m a doctor not a pull toy," he said, though he was thrilled to see
her excited greeting.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna has been injured," Seven said as if that explained everything. "You
must assist the Dengari surgeons."</P>
<P>"Well right now, I think I should take a look at that nasty gash," he said as
he stopped, yanking Seven to a halt with him. There were advantages to
holographic strength.</P>
<P>"No," Seven stated. "Anyone can treat my injury. The Dengari do not have
experience with Klingon physiology. You must go to her." There was a pleading in
her voice that the Doctor had never heard.</P>
<P>"All right, Seven, but you stay here," he said. He looked over to Dr.
Alteron, who nodded and pointed to the exit.</P>
<P>Janeway put her hand on Seven’s shoulder. "Seven, let these people help you,"
she said. "Come on." She guided Seven toward an exam table. </P>
<P>"Let me take a look at that cut," Dr. Alteron said as he guided Seven onto
the high exam table. "Easy, we’re here to help."</P>
<P>"Help?" Seven asked angrily. "Your people’s help is exactly what caused this,
and if B’Elanna dies I will destroy your entire race," she said, her voice like
caustic venom.</P>
<P>"Seven, take it easy," Janeway said, clearly concerned. Dr. Alteron didn’t
take the threat seriously, but the Starfleet captain knew that the tall blonde
could probably pull off the threat.</P>
<P>"These people put vicious convicts into our cell while we were sleeping,"
Seven told Janeway in a deadly, calm tone.</P>
<P>Janeway’s protective streak went on Red Alert. "What?" She spun and faced the
Overseer but didn’t take her hand off of Seven’s shoulder. "Is this how you run
your facility?"</P>
<P>"I assure you, the offenders will be punished," the Overseer insisted.</P>
<P>"I have already dealt with them," Seven said dangerously. "As I will deal
with all of your species if B’Elanna does not survive." </P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway said, putting her other hand onto the former drone’s
opposite shoulder mimicking a lover’s embrace. "The Doctor will help her," she
promised, though it was an empty promise considering that she had no idea how
badly Lieutenant Torres was injured.</P>
<P>"He must," Seven whispered. Her lip trembled, and to Kathryn’s stunned
amazement, tears rolled down Seven’s cheeks. Seven burst into tears and Kathryn
pulled her into a hug, feeling a little guilty for enjoying the warmth of her
body when she was obviously so upset.</P>
<P>"Shh," Kathryn murmured. She was glad that Seven and B’Elanna had apparently
bonded. Having a good friend would have made the ordeal more manageable,
although Seven didn’t seem too much worse for wear despite the cut on her head.
In fact, she looked healthy, and her long blonde braid was quite attractive.
Kathryn pushed that thought aside, realizing how inappropriate it was under the
current conditions. </P>
<P>Dr. Alteron interrupted. "I need to heal that wound." He stood with a dermal
regenerator in his hand.</P>
<P>"Come on," Kathryn said in a husky whisper. "Let’s have a look at you."</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said as she let Dr. Alteron scan and then heal her.
</P>
<P>Seven studied the captain while Dr. Alteron worked. This was a woman she had
once thought she loved, but now, as she looked at Janeway’s soft features, she
knew it hadn’t been love. Well, it may have been love, but not in same way that
she loved B’Elanna. Her love for the Captain had been a distant admiration that
never could have lead anywhere, not with the Captain’s rank in the way. Janeway
was reserved, she had to be because of her position, and now Seven knew how
truly unappealing that would have been. She had tasted… no, savored, every
minute with B’Elanna, both women grabbing onto their love with both hands and
squeezing very ounce of happiness from it, and Seven couldn’t imagine settling
for any less.</P>
<P>Alteron finished and stepped back, smiling at the beautiful woman sitting in
front of him. "Okay," he said. "I need to complete the exam."</P>
<P>Seven nodded, then turned to Janeway, suddenly realizing that she should not
have been there at all. "Captain, why is <I>Voyager</I> still here?"</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway began carefully. "Do you remember the planet we got trapped
in orbit around? With the unusual temporal differential?"</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said, somewhat offended. It had only been two and a half
years after all, and her eidetic memory retained information much longer than
that.</P>
<P>"Jusari Prime is like that planet," Kathryn said delicately.</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven said as if she had just been told the day’s lunch menu. "How much
time has passed for <I>Voyager</I>?"</P>
<P>"You were on the plant for five days, our time," Kathryn said. She smiled at
the blonde’s resilience, one of the many things she loved about her.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna will be pleased," Seven said, then her eyes filled with tears. "She
must be all right."</P>
<P>Dr. Alteron stopped his scan, pausing over Seven’s stomach, then he stepped
away and spoke to a nurse before returning. "Excuse me," he said gently.</P>
<P>"Is B’Elanna out of surgery?" Seven regarded him like a bug she was deciding
whether or not to step on depending on his news about B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I don’t know," he said, not expecting the question. "I need to ask you…if
you are aware of your… condition, and how you wish to proceed."</P>
<P>"Condition?" Janeway asked. She didn’t like the sound of Alteron’s voice or
the way the conversation was heading.</P>
<P>Alteron dipped his head and his eyes softened. "We can terminate the
pregnancy if you wish," he said.</P>
<P>Seven was off of the bed and had her hands around his throat before he even
saw her move. The raging hurricane was back at full force.</P>
<P>"I should snap your neck right here," she said, her voice like liquid
nitrogen.</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway said, grabbing her arm only to find it as rigid as duranium
deck plating. "Let him go, he just wants to help you."</P>
<P>"Help?" Seven lifted him into the air using his throat as a convenient handle
and flung him several feet away. He landed in a heap, coughing, gasping for air
and rubbing his throat. "This is how they help? By putting monsters into our
cells and killing our unborn children?"</P>
<P>"Easy. No one is going to do anything you don’t want them to," Janeway said
as she moved toward Seven. The tall former Borg looked like a wounded, trapped
animal, and Kathryn wondered how she had endured on the unforgiving planet. It
was a testament to Seven’s humanity that she wouldn’t blame an unborn child for
the brutal manner in which it was conceived. Kathryn didn’t know if she would
have the strength to keep a child born of such brutality.</P>
<P>Seven backed up against the exam table and closed her eyes. "Lana," she
whispered.</P>
<P>The door opened as if on cue, and the Klingon in question came into the room
dressed only in a surgical gown that barely covered her knees. She took one look
at Seven’s distressed state and her eyes flashed dangerously.</P>
<P>"What the hell did you do to her?" B’Elanna demanded.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven yelled as her eyes popped open. She sprinted toward the scantly
clad Klingon, picking her up and holding her to her chest. "Lana, they want to
take the baby," she whispered into her wife’s ear.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna squirmed and stood back on the ground. She turned and faced
the medial staff, keeping Seven behind her body protectively. Her hand reached
behind her, her fingers entwining with Seven’s. "Who? Who tried to hurt our
baby?" Her voice was wild but strangely calm, a terrifying combination.</P>
<P>"It’s a misunderstanding, B’Elanna," Janeway said. She was confused by the
Klingon’s use of the phrase ‘our child,’ but she passed it off as B’Elanna
volunteering to help raise the baby. "No one will do anything against her
will."</P>
<P>"Damn right, they wont," B’Elanna said. She eased back, until she felt the
warmth of Seven’s chest against her back…her very bare back. She looked at
Malok, who had remained in the room, but kept out of the way near the door.
"Where are my clothes?"</P>
<P>The tall guard actually smirked. "The nurse has them, what’s left of
them."</P>
<P>"Captain," the holographic Doctor whined. "We should get them back to
<I>Voyager</I> so I can run my own tests on them. I explained to Lieutenant
Torres about the temporal differential, and she just wants to go back home."</P>
<P>Janeway turned to him while the nurse gave B’Elanna her pants. Her shirt had
been destroyed by the stabbing and the physicians cutting it off for surgery.
</P>
<P>"Doctor, I think that’s the best idea you’ve had all day," the Captain
said.</P>
<P>"I really think we should go," he said quietly. He raised his eyebrows to
make the point. "Now."</P>
<P>"What is it?" Janeway whispered, pulling him off to one side.</P>
<P>"Captain, regardless of Seven’s willingness to keep the child and Lieutenant
Torres’ willingness to assist her, do we really want another Borg on board? I
have no idea whether or not the…child… will be born sprouting implants and
assimilation tubules. The sooner we find out, the sooner we can…take
action."</P>
<P>Janeway’s face whitened. She wondered how much more Seven would be forced to
endure. "Let’s go home, people," the captain said. She watched as Seven
interacted with B’Elanna, the way they touched often and intimately, their hands
lingering, as well as the frequent eye contact they shared. "<I>No</I>," she
thought. "<I>Not the two of them</I>"</P>
<P>"Let’s go," B’Elanna said to Seven, taking her hand and leading the way.</P>
<P>Malok held up a hand, stopping her. "I will have your…things…delivered to the
airlock," he said.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said. Of all the Dengari, he seemed to be the most
compassionate, and had he not been a guard, she thought she would have liked
him.</P>
<P>Kathryn lingered behind with the Overseer as the small group was led through
the corridors. "Are we finished?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Yes, and I would suggest that you leave before the Magistrate arrives," the
Overseer said.</P>
<P>"Oh?" the captain asked as she walked. Her eyes kept being drawn back to
Seven and B’Elanna’s joined hands, the way they moved as one despite their
vastly different strides, as if walking hand in hand was something they did
everyday.</P>
<P>"The Magistrate will not be pleased that I have afforded you so
many…privileges. Nor will he be pleased that your people were allowed in the
examining room," she explained, then she looked into Kathryn’s face, and Janeway
saw fear in the Overseer’s dark eyes. "It would be best if you were outside his
reach when he arrives."</P>
<P>"All right," the captain said. She glanced back up at her two rescued
crewmembers. "B’Elanna?" </P>
<P>"Yes?" The Klingon paused but didn’t release Seven’s hand. Seven stopped
beside her without missing a beat and waited patiently.</P>
<P>"A word?" Janeway asked. </P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and finally let go of Seven’s hand and Kathryn released the
breath she had been holding.</P>
<P>"What is it, captain?" B’Elanna asked when she reached the auburn-headed
woman.</P>
<P>"I know you and Seven have been depending on each other exclusively these
past few years… I hope you will help her make the adjustment to being back with
our crew," Kathryn said as she took B’Elanna by the arm and continued down the
corridor. "It might be difficult for her when you go back to your life and she
finds herself alone again. I’ll help her as much as I can, but she may need to
see you more frequently than before you two left <I>Voyager</I>." </P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna nodded trying to decide if the captain was trying to get
her to spend time with Seven or arrange for her to accidentally slip out an
airlock, then dismissed the idea knowing the captain was a woman of honor.</P>
<P>"She seems…fond of you, B’Elanna, but I don’t want you feeling obligated."
Kathryn could see that Seven had grown very attached to the Klingon, and didn’t
want B’Elanna to go back to the way things were in the past, though she guessed
that the two had bonded against the common enemies they had faced on the planet.
She hoped Seven wasn’t confusing B’Elanna’s caring for more than the Klingon was
able to offer.</P>
<P>"Oh, really?" B’Elanna asked. Klingon jealousy was powerful thing. It didn’t
really matter if a Klingon’s mate is straying, it’s enough that someone else
seems to be sniffing around, even if they aren’t making a move on the mate in
question. "So you think I should…make a little time in my busy schedule for her
before jumping back into my life?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Something like that," Kathryn said. "Although I’m sure you’ll be busy
catching up on all the technical things you’ve been away from so long," Kathryn
said. She was having her own green eyed monster nagging at the back of her mind,
wondering if the friendship she had enjoyed with Seven would be resumed now that
Seven seemed to depend on Torres. "But I assure you, I’ll be more than happy to
help Seven adjust," Kathryn said sincerely. Even if she couldn’t be with Seven,
she didn’t want to lose the friendship they had shared.</P>
<P>"Really?" B’Elanna stopped and looked the captain over. It was quite clear
that the crush Seven used to have on the captain had been mutual, and while
Seven had moved on, Janeway hadn’t had the passage of two and a half years to do
the same. "I think Seven and I will handle things just fine," B’Elanna said
slowly, then pushed down her jealousy. </P>
<P>She really did care for the captain, and it wasn’t her fault she had lost
out, even if she didn’t know it yet. Then B’Elanna realized, that yes, it was
her fault, but instead of making her angry, it made her feel sincere compassion
for the captain. "Um, Captain, I think there are a few things we need to talk
about," the Klingon began. "But I think it would be best if we waited until we
get settled on board." B’Elanna didn’t want to break the news on a hostile space
station.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway agreed, though she had a feeling she wasn’t going to
like the topic.</P>
<P>Up ahead, Seven was not enjoying the Doctor’s company. He seemed to have
damaged his matrix during Seven’s absence and had an overwhelming need to
discuss Seven’s <I>feelings</I>. Asking her, "and how does that make you feel?"
and saying things like, "That must have been very hard for you." Seven was
tired, and she wanted to feel B’Elanna in her arms to make sure that her wife
was all right. Perhaps she could convince her beloved Klingon to go back to
B’Elanna’s quarters, their quarters, and take a nap. Seven paused and looked
back at B’Elanna. She could tell that her wife was upset about something.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"What is it, Seven?" B’Elanna’s eyes lit up as she looked down the corridor
and the edges of her lips curled up unconsciously.</P>
<P>"I am tired, Be’nal," Seven said as she held out her hand. "Can we take a
nap?"</P>
<P>"Of course, love," B’Elanna said as she rushed to catch up with Seven before
she realized that the words were out of her mouth.</P>
<P>Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and pulled her close, feeling the Klingon’s hand
wrap around her waist as naturally as breathing. "I missed you," Seven said as
she placed a quick kiss on B’Elanna head.</P>
<P>B’Elanna paused, thinking about the captain’s feelings, but then realized she
wasn’t about to snub the love of her life. She leaned into Seven and squeezed
her, then let her hand slide down to Seven’s tummy. "Me too. Let’s go home."</P>
<P>Janeway felt like she had been kicked by a six legged Altarian bull. Seven
had called B’Elanna "Be’nal," and while Janeway’s Klingon was rusty, she knew
that was the word for wife. She followed quietly, not wanting to intrude on such
a private moment.</P>
<P>"Wife?" the Doctor asked. He spoke fluent Klingon and had no problem
intruding. "What on earth do you mean by that, Seven?"</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna had stopped, and Janeway caught up with the small group
just as the explanations came.</P>
<P>"We’ve been married for two years," B’Elanna said proudly. She felt bad for
the captain, but she wasn’t about to let Seven mistake that concern for a lack
of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>"Two years, one month, sixteen days," Seven corrected and then kissed
B’Elanna’s temple.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and blushed. "Yes, dear. How silly of me to be so
inaccurate." She leaned into the willowy blonde, letting her hands tickle
Seven’s ribs. The exBorg squirmed, but seemed to be more than willing to indulge
the Klingon’s playful torture.</P>
<P>"Congratulations," Janeway said. She could see the happiness in both women’s
eyes along with the palpable presence of love. "I’m glad you two found something
good to take away from this experience."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes drifted to Seven’s belly and her smile grew. Anyone who was
used to seeing B’Elanna Torres, angry Klingon with an attitude, wouldn’t have
recognized the woman in front of them. B’Elanna’s eyes were filled with wonder
as her hand caressed Seven’s belly. </P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said quietly. She linked her hand over B’Elanna’s holding it
there. "We have many things to be thankful for."</P>
<P>"You intend to keep the child?" the Doctor asked. He wasn’t known for his
subtlety or his ability to notice anyone else’s emotions.</P>
<P>"Why would we not?" Seven demanded. "We planned this pregnancy and are
looking forward to our daughter’s birth."</P>
<P>Janeway didn’t know how much more she could handle, so she shifted into
captain mode. "Let’s get back to <I>Voyager</I> and we can discuss this there.
Come on," she ordered and then marched on in front of her crew.</P>

</table>

<P>Janeway went directly to her quarters and used a hypospray the Doctor had
given her for the headaches she had been suffering from since the Dengari
situation began. After a quick look in the mirror to make sure that her command
mask was in place, she made her way to the bridge. She wanted to get the ship
underway before the mysterious Magistrate arrived. She had used up every ounce
of patience with the Dengari Overseer and had no interest in meeting the
Magistrate and wanted to get back on course to the Alpha quadrant. Kathryn hoped
the familiar routine of the bridge would take her mind off of Seven. </P>
<P>Part of her was truly happy that Seven seemed to have found someone she could
love, someone who obviously loved her in return, but a smaller part felt like
she had been shown a cruel glimpse of the happiness she could have shared with
the exBorg. Both thoughts only made the weight of her loneliness press down on
her like it hadn’t since she had found out that her fiancee Mark had moved on
and married someone else back in the Alpha Quadrant. </P>
<P>"Mister Paris," Janeway said as she walked onto the bridge, "Take us out of
here as soon as we get clearance to disengage the airlock."</P>
<P>"Aye, Ma’am," he said slowly. It wasn’t normal for her to start spouting
orders before even greeting whomever had the bridge.</P>
<P>"Captain," Chakotay said as she walked down to the command deck. "Everything
all right?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Commander. B’Elanna and Seven are safely on board." Janeway paused as
the tattooed officer climbed out of her chair and into his own, and then she sat
without another word.</P>
<P>Chakotay turned back toward Ensign Kim at Ops. "Harry, any word from the
station?"</P>
<P>"Yes, sir. They’re still finishing up some last minute things before they can
disengage the airlock." Harry studied his comm panel intently but was more than
a little curious about B’Elanna and Seven.</P>
<P>"How did B’Elanna look?" Tom Paris asked as he turned.</P>
<P>"Fine," Janeway answered, not elaborating.</P>
<P>"Did she ask about me?" he asked.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said, hoping Tom would get the hint that she didn’t want to
talk about it.</P>
<P>"She was probably pretty preoccupied, right?" Tom persisted.</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said. <I>‘Sometimes,’ </I>she thought, ‘<I>he can be so
dense</I>.’</P>
<P>"Probably just wanted to climb into a warm bed, huh?" he asked, unaware of
how that particular question would affect the captain.</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said. Her voice was at its most deadly register reserved for
the Kazon or Hirogen.</P>
<P>"She didn’t mention me at all?" he asked again. His face showed his
disbelief, as if the captain had simply not been paying attention to B’Elanna,
because certainly she would have asked about him.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said. She wondered if anyone would object to her asking Tuvok
to test his Vulcan nerve pinch on the helmsman. Probably not.</P>
<P>The doors to the turbolift opened and the Doctor came into the room.
"Captain, I just finished checking Lieutenant Torres and Seven. If you have a
moment, I think I should brief you on my findings."</P>
<P>"Fine. In my ready room." Janeway wasn’t in the mood to talk about either of
the women, but she had a ship to run, so she pushed herself out of her
chair.</P>
<P>"Doc?" Tom asked. "Think Lana is up to a little visit?" His eyes suggested
his question was more about a date than a visit. "I mean, after two and half
years, she has to have forgiven me, right?"</P>
<P>Janeway sighed and looked at the helmsman. "Mister Paris," Janeway said
ruefully, "I think that ship has sailed."</P>
<P>The Doctor snorted a half laugh. "That ship has not only sailed, but it’s
coming back to port with a copilot and full cargo hold."</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat and nodded toward her ready room while Tom gave
them both a confused stare.</P>
<P>"Chakotay, you have the bridge. Take us out of here as soon as we’re clear."
Janeway led the way off of the bridge. She still had a lingering sense of dread
about the Magistrate and wanted to be long gone before he arrived.</P>
<P>The Doctor followed Janeway into her ready room and studied the various items
decorating her office as she sat at her desk. He wondered if he should add a
bust of one of his medical heroes or perhaps a famous opera star to his own
office.</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Janeway nodded to the chair across from her.</P>
<P>"Captain," he said as he sat. "I just wanted you to know that my concerns
about the child were unfounded. There is no risk of it, or rather her, being
Borg."</P>
<P>"Glad to hear it," she said. That was one less hardship for Seven and
B’Elanna to endure she thought happily.</P>
<P>"And, despite what I first thought, I don’t think either Lieutenant Torres or
Seven will need counseling for post traumatic stress disorder or the effects of
internment." He smiled proudly as if it was by some miracle of his own
doing.</P>
<P>Janeway’s only response was a set of raised auburn eyebrows.</P>
<P>"It seems they were not even with the other inmates. They were alone in a
mountain region," he explained. "So, while we were all worrying ourselves sick
about their well being, they were off having a romantic vacation," he added, his
voice dripping with sarcasm. "We should all be so lucky."</P>
<P>"I’m sure upsetting you wasn’t their only goal, Doctor. I’m guessing they had
a tough time of it." She sighed, relived that her crewmembers hadn’t been forced
to deal with the horrors that had filled her own thoughts since they had went
missing. </P>
<P>"Yes, well…" he said as he tugged at his holographic collar. He had the good
sense to look contrite before continuing. "I’d like them to take off at least a
few weeks to relax and get back into the swing of things, as it were."</P>
<P>"You’re giving them time off after a two and half year vacation?" Janeway
wasn’t through dressing the hologram down just yet. "How generous of you." Her
eyes lacked the sparkle they had when she was teasing.</P>
<P>"Point taken, captain." He knew when he was beaten, and had the intelligence
to quit while he was ahead. "While they may have had less harsh conditions than
we had speculated, they did have to struggle."</P>
<P>"I’ll make a note in my log," she said. "Doctor, you said they weren’t with
the other inmates?"</P>
<P>"Yes." He nodded. "They were completely isolated for most of the time."</P>
<P>"Well, then how did Seven… how… her, well if not one of the convicts, how did
she get…" Janeway struggled, not comfortable with the topic, but still having an
overwhelming curiosity about the subject.</P>
<P>"Pregnant?" the Doctor supplied. "We have Lieutenant Torres to thank for
that," he said with a smirk. "Well, Lieutenant Torres and good old Borg
ingenuity."</P>
<P>Janeway stared at him, her mouth refusing to function.</P>
<P>"In six months," he said with a smile, "We’re going to have a little
Klingon-human-Borg tyke running around. Well, I guess that isn’t entirely
accurate. She’ll be one quarter Klingon and three quarters Human."</P>
<P>"I see," Janeway said, but in truth she had no idea how B’Elanna and Seven
had managed that particular feat, and the last thing she wanted to do was try to
think about it. That invited images she didn’t want, images of the two women in
a heated embrace. No, she didn’t want to think about that at all.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven made their way down to the crew deck after finishing up in
sick bay. They passed several crew members who were warm and welcoming, though
somewhat surprised to see the two women together, that and the fact that both
women looked significantly different than they had the last time they had been
on board. Seven’s rich brown leather pants and blood stained white top weren’t
nearly a surprising as the thick braid that came down over her left shoulder
reaching her belly. B’Elanna was an even more bizarre site. She was wearing her
dark brown leather pants and a loose fitting surgical gown. Her hair had also
grown out, and she wore it pulled back into a loose ponytail tied off at the
shoulder with a piece of leather. Her sable brown hair reached down passed her
shoulder blades.</P>
<P>They reached B’Elanna’s quarters and were thrilled to find a package waiting
next to the door. It was from Malok, and contained not only the bearskin and
B’Elanna’s knife but her jacket as well. Seven had left the leather garment in
their cell during her haste to accompany B’Elanna to the surgical bay.</P>
<P>"Welcome home," B’Elanna said as she walked into her quarters.</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven took the package from B’Elanna and put it onto the low
table and then turned to the Klingon with a feral grin. "Show me our bed," the
exdrone demanded and her eyes lidded as she leaned in for a kiss.</P>
<P>"I thought you needed a nap?" B’Elanna’s asked after a lingering kiss.</P>
<P>"I need you more," Seven said. She wrapped B’Elanna in her arms and rested
her forehead against her wife’s ridged brow. "You scared me today. I now
understand the promise you wanted me to make after our vision quest." She ran
her fingers down B’Elanna’s cheek and then followed the same path with whisper
soft kisses.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry," B’Elanna whispered. She groaned and leaned into Seven’s body,
her mocha colored hands kneading the muscles in Seven’s lower back. "Your back’s
like a rock. It must be killing you." B’Elanna untangled from the embrace and
led Seven to their bed, pausing only long enough to bring the bearskin.</P>
<P>"Don’t ever leave me, Be’nal," Seven whispered as B’Elanna lifted the blood
stained shirt over her head. Her blonde braid got tangled, then slapped down
onto her chest and B’Elanna tugged on her braid with a smile, using it to pull
Seven into searing kiss.</P>
<P>"I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere." B’Elanna eased Seven onto the bed,
face down, and straddled her leather covered backside. She tenderly massaged
Seven’s lean, long back, giving each muscle loving, soothing attention until
every bit of tightness was gone, then settled herself next to Seven.</P>
<P>"Make love to me," the fully relaxed and aroused blonde begged.</P>
<P>"Always," B’Elanna breathed into a kiss on Seven’s full lips. "Always, my
beloved. Now, roll over." Her brown eyes darkened to the color of night at she
leaned over to steal another kiss, and they made love under the same bearskin
that had warmed them every night since the first time they had opened their
souls to each other. It was just as wonderful, magical, and fresh as that first
time. Each meeting of lips was a benediction, a promise of forever. Each touch
of velvet soft skin against well muscled limbs ignited fires so fierce that they
consumed the pair until they lay spent and their breathing was reduced to
labored gasps. All in all, it was a perfect homecoming.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several decks away Kathryn Janeway was awake in her bed, but for a much
different reason. After staring at the ceiling for an hour she got up and went
for a walk. She wandered aimlessly through the various decks until she found
herself at a familiar location. She stared at the doors to Cargo Bay two and
felt like her soul was being ripped from her body. She had to stop herself from
activating the door, then almost laughed at the absurdity of the action. Seven
was probably with B’Elanna, in her…no, their quarters, and even if Seven was in
the Borg alcove regenerating, B’Elanna was probably there with her. Even if the
Klingon wasn’t there, watching another woman’s wife sleep was completely
inappropriate. </P>
<P>Kathryn walked back to the turbolift and began going over her past actions.
She had watched Seven regenerate, sleep, on countless occasions, and had never
admitted the intimacy it implied. Watching Seven sleep had been the most
intimate act Kathryn had indulged in since she had left the Alpha Quadrant. Now
the beautiful blonde Borg was sleeping next to B’Elanna Torres. Kathryn pushed
that image out of her mind and headed back to her quarters alone.</P>

<P>Word spread quickly through <I>Voyager’s</I> grapevine that the two missing
crewmembers were back, but there were only faint rumblings about how the two may
or may not have gotten along.</P><I>
<P>Voyager</I> got underway without a hitch, and much to Janeway’s relief she
was able to return to her ready room for some much needed alone time. So far,
she and the Doctor were the only two on board who knew about B’Elanna and
Seven’s marriage and impending child, but the juicy piece of gossip would make
the rounds soon enough. The captain didn’t care to discuss it with anyone, so
she was less than thrilled to hear the chime of her door disturb her quiet
contemplation.</P>
<P>"Come in," Janeway said unenthusiastically.</P>
<P>Tuvok entered and walked directly to her desk without a word. She waited
until he stood at attention and then raised her eyebrows in silence question.
When he merely shifted his weight, she switched tactics.</P>
<P>"Yes?" she asked.</P>
<P>"I came to ask if you have come to any resolution regarding your personal
matter," he said the last two words as if they were actually painful.</P>
<P>"Didn’t give me much time, did you, old friend?" She leaned back in her chair
and motioned to the chair beside him with a nod of her head.</P>
<P>"You have seen her. From all accounts, she is well," he said as if that
explained everything.</P>
<P>"Yes, she’s quite well," Janeway said with bitterness hardening her
words.</P>
<P>"I would think her well being would be a cause for relief," he said. He
really did not enjoy trying to decipher human emotions. Just when he thought he
had a firm grasp on them, they darted off in the most illogical direction
available. </P>
<P>Kathryn looked down at her hands that were resting on top of her desk, then
looked up. Her command mask was down, something she wouldn’t allow with any
other member of the crew.</P>
<P>"Captain?" The depth of despair Tuvok saw disturb him.</P>
<P>"She’s married, Tuvok." Her eyes went back down to her own hands, to the ring
finger, devoid of any decoration, the naked digit mocking her. Even while she
had been engaged to Mark, she had never worn a ring, adhering to the letter
Starfleet policy, although most captains allowed their crew to wear wedding
bands. </P>
<P>"To Lieutenant Torres, I presume?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Kathryn responded, though she wondered why it had occurred to him so
quickly. "Did you see this coming?"</P>
<P>"Their bonding was one of the many possible variables," he said slowly. "I
had considered that the animosity they harbored on board might have been sexual
tension. I felt mentioning it prior to this would have caused you undo stress
given the fact that we had no way of knowing what was going on."</P>
<P>"Well," Janeway said as she stood and walked to the window, studying the
stars whipping by. "I think it’s pretty clear the matter is closed."</P>
<P>"Were you a Vulcan, I would agree." Tuvok stood and went to stand next to the
captain and studied the flying specks that were stars outside the warp field.
"However, you are not Vulcan."</P>
<P>"Other than stating out the obvious, do you have a point?" Kathryn eyed the
dark skinned Vulcan with a sideways glance.</P>
<P>"My point, is that since you are human, the knowledge that Seven is
unattainable will not make you want her any less." Tuvok linked his hands behind
his back and continued staring out the window. "In fact, given your nature,
Captain, it may make you want her more."</P>
<P>"Me in general, or all us flawed humans?" Janeway turned to face him.</P>
<P>"You are a particularly competitive person, Captain. It has served you well.
It is one of the things that makes you such a great captain." He turned and
tilted his head to one side. "It is also the thing that concerns me in this
situation."</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway asked. She was less than amused. "Are you worried I’ll
challenge B’Elanna to a duel for Seven’s hand?"</P>
<P>"Vulcans do not worry," he said. "Additionally, I know you well enough to
know that such an action would not be in your nature. I also know Seven well
enough to know that she would not allow such a contest," he added in case the
captain surprised him and was actually considering that option.</P>
<P>"And just what would be in my nature?" Her voice rumbled quietly.</P>
<P>"You would not interfere in another person’s relationship, however I am
concerned that you will become increasingly forlorn. You do not like losing," he
explained.</P>
<P>"This isn’t a game, Tuvok."</P>
<P>"No, but when Ransom had Seven in his custody, your actions were illogical. I
believe part of that was your need to beat Ransom, and part of it was that he
stole what you saw as yours," Tuvok stated bluntly. "That may intensify your
sense of loss in this case."</P>
<P>"He did had our containment matrix," Janeway said defensively.</P>
<P>"I was referring to Seven of Nine." He raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"I do not consider her property." Janeway’s eyes flashed and she straightened
to her full height, though she still only reached his chest. "And I resent you
suggesting otherwise."</P>
<P>"My intention is not to cause resentment, only to counsel you to refocus
your…affection." He looked down at her, showing as much concern as was possible
for the Vulcan.</P>
<P>Janeway laughed and walked away, her heart breaking. "Refocus my affection?
Tuvok," she said as she went to the couch and sat. "If only it were that
easy."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna studied Seven as the blonde slept. Seven had dozed off after they
had finished making love; the napping had only begun to happen since the
pregnancy. B’Elanna watched her wife’s lips twitch and her eyes shift under
closed lids as she dreamed. The Klingon smiled, unable to contain her joy. She
had everything she had ever dreamed possible…and more, a beautiful wife, a
daughter on the way, and now they were safely back on board <I>Voyager</I>. When
she had awakened in the Dengari surgical bay and seen <I>Voyager’s</I> Doctor,
she had thought she was hallucinating. Once he explained the temporal
differential, of course dragging in his own heroic away mission on a similar
planet, she had been relieved. Now that she was back on board, it finally hit
her what the time difference meant. She and Seven had each other and the baby,
while the ship had barely missed a beat of Kahless’ drum in the grand scheme.
She reached out and brushed a strand of blonde hair off of Seven’s face and
tucked it behind her ear. Seven mumbled, and shifted toward the Klingon, she had
an innate sense of B’Elanna’s presence, and would shift to be as close to her as
possible. B’Elanna loved the way Seven would make little frustrated sounds when
she couldn’t touch B’Elanna the way she wanted to, tiny whimpers that she would
continue until she rolled over and found B’Elanna, then she would let out a
contented sigh and begin nuzzling into B’Elanna’s neck. B’Elanna thought it was
the most adorable thing she had ever seen. She hoped their daughter inherited
the tiny whimpers.</P>
<P>B’Elanna lifted the covers and slipped out of the bed, standing for several
minutes just watching Seven. Finally, she bent down and placed a tender kiss on
her wife’s temple, running her hand through Seven’s hair that was down and
flowing across the pillow. She left the former drone to rest and went into the
living area. She had grown accustom to clothing being optional, and she didn’t
even register her lack of attire until she sat on the couch and realized that
she was somewhat underdressed and smiled as she retrieved her robe. She wanted
to start designing a portable regenerator to move into her quarters so that
Seven wouldn’t have to spend time in the cargo bay.</P>
<P>The Klingon found that being away from <I>Voyager</I> for two and a half
years had left her technical skills a bit rusty. She had to actually pull the
ship’s schematics before working out the best way to move a smaller version of
the alcove to her quarters. It was frustrating, she remembered when she could
have rerouted any system in her head, every circuit and relay embedded in her
memory, and she didn’t like needing to rely on data padds to tell her where the
nearest power conduits were. </P>
<P>The door chimed and she looked up from the three padds on her lap. She got up
and hurried to the door not wanting whoever it was to chime again which might
wake up Seven.</P>
<P>She opened the door and saw red, literally. Two dozen roses blocked her view,
the roses lowered and Tom Paris smiled and did his best to look charming.</P>
<P>"Tom, what do you want?" B’Elanna asked as she leaned against the wall,
blocking his entry. </P>
<P>"Lana, welcome home," he said and stepped forward.</P>
<P>"Paris? What is it?" B’Elanna reached across the doorway using her arm as a
barricade before he could enter.</P>
<P>"Come on, Lana, you can’t still be angry." He moved to the other side of
B’Elanna to get past her. "I’m sorry, all right? If you’re still mad after all
this time, you must still care. Why don’t you let me come in and give you a
proper welcome home?"</P>
<P>"Tom, look, I’m not mad at you. Honestly, I haven’t thought much about you at
all." She shifted her weight and crossed her arms over her chest. "I need to
talk to you, but this really isn’t a good time."</P>
<P>"Come on, Lana, it’s the perfect time." He rushed past her and into the room,
stopping when he saw the padds scattered across the couch. "Back to work so
soon? You need to relax," he said. "Computer, lights one half." </P>
<P>The illumination lowered and Tom tossed the roses onto the couch. "I know
you’ve missed me," he insisted. "Come on." He moved closer and she had to
backpedal to stay out of his reach.</P>
<P>"Tom, leave, now." She continued backing away. "Or I’m gonna’ enjoy giving
you a nice bit of news."</P>
<P>"Oh?" he asked as he came closer, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.</P>
<P>"Tom, I’m married." She stood her ground and glared at him. "So I suggest you
leave now before things get really ugly." Her lips curled up at the edges
revealing her pointed teeth. It wasn’t a smile.</P>
<P>"Married?" Tom asked. "Come on, Lana, you can do better than that." He looked
around her quarters, pointing at the mostly empty room. "I don’t see any prince
charming. Lana, if you want me to beg I will, but just give me a chance."</P>
<P>"Paris," B’Elanna sighed and rubbed her temples, wanting him out before Seven
woke up. After the fiasco with the way had Janeway found out, she didn’t want
the same thing to happen with Tom. True, he was a jerk, but she didn’t want to
see him hurt, embarrassed maybe, but not hurt. "Leave, Tom. I’m happy, and you
don’t hold a candle to my…"</P>
<P>"Your husband?" Tom asked, then laughed. "Please." He laughed and tugged at
the collar of her robe. She grabbed his arm and twisted him around, trapping his
arm behind him and pushing toward the door. </P>
<P>"Go try this crap with your hologram, Tom," B’Elanna said as she shoved him
away from her.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, even if you did meet someone, you know it’s me you want," he
challenged. "You probably picked some guy who looks just like me, didn’t
you?"</P>
<P>"No," came the sultry voice from behind him. </P>
<P>He turned and saw Seven leaning against the bedroom door with one of
B’Elanna’s tunics held to her body, covering her, well, covering some of her.
</P>
<P>"Seven?" Tom’s voice squeaked.</P>
<P>"You remember me. I am honored… I thought five days was beyond the capacity
of your limited memory," Seven said sarcastically. The tunic had been hanging on
the wall and Seven had grabbed it before coming out when she had heard voices.
The uniform top hid her breasts, and down past her waist, but it revealed her
long expanse of legs on the bottom and her abundant cleavage on top. Luckily her
hair was cascading down on both sides of her face, helping to keep her breasts
from view.</P>
<P>"No way," Paris said. He couldn’t believe B’Elanna would dump him for the
Borg ice queen, although he was enjoying the view in front of him.</P>
<P>"Get out," B’Elanna said as she walked passed him and into the bedroom. She
came back out with a sheet and draped it around Seven from behind, leaving her
arms around the tall blonde. "I’m happy, Tom. Just move on." Her cheek was
resting against Seven’s shoulder. She hadn’t wanted to rub her happiness in his
face, but he just made it so easy.</P>
<P>"But, but… we, we had something," he insisted.</P>
<P>"<I>Had</I>, Tom," B’Elanna said as she rubbed her wife’s arms. "And what we
had doesn’t hold a candle to what Seven and I have." She looked at Tom, feeling
sorry for the inept fool. "Tom, go home."</P>
<P>He continued staring, too stunned to speak.</P>
<P>Seven shifted so that she had her arms cradled over the top of B’Elanna’s.
"My wife asked you to leave our quarters, Ensign Paris," Seven said calmly. "Do
not make her ask again."</P>
<P>"Or what?" he asked as he stepped forward, his shock overruling his natural
instinct for self-preservation.</P>
<P>B’Elanna tensed, but Seven had her arms pinned around her waist and the
sheet. The Klingon remembered the nauseating sound of the breaking necks in the
holding cell and realized that she should get Tom out of the room.</P>
<P>"Or, I will remove you," Seven said. Her voice was calm, but had the sharp
edge of rage making the air crackle. Her eyes narrowed and she raised the
eyebrow under her implant. "I do not wish to do so. You are a competent pilot
and it would be a shame for you to be confined to sickbay…indefinitely."</P>
<P>Tom was about to make a snide comment that would get him an all expenses paid
emergency transport to sickbay with a complimentary painkiller, but he saw
B’Elanna squeeze and then soothe Seven. Something in the way Seven’s muscles
rippled beneath her skin, like a cat before it pounces, made him hesitate.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," the Klingon whispered as she lifted onto her toes to reach Seven’s
ear. "He’s not worth it. Please, let me handle this." She left a kiss on the
soft pink shell of Seven’s ear to convince the exdrone.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven whispered back, tilting her face toward B’Elanna so that
their cheeks touched. </P>
<P>B’Elanna walked passed Tom, grabbed the roses, then went back and yanked him
by the arm toward the door. "I just saved your ass, Paris. You owe me," she said
as she shoved him out the door and tossed the roses out after him.</P>
<P>"This isn’t over, Borg," he said as the door slid shut cutting off his
pigheaded taunt.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Those onboard who considered B’Elanna Torres to be the supreme source of
gossip on <I>Voyager</I> had never seen Tom Paris at the top of his informative
game. Twelve minutes after he left B’Elanna’s quarters, every member of the crew
knew about the marriage of the resident Klingon to the Borg drone. Tom had
expected surprise, which he got in abundance, but the sense of outrage he wanted
was not to be had. While everyone seemed surprised, most passed it off as none
of their business, or worse in Tom’s mind, they were happy for the pair. The
only one on board who actually seemed disturbed by the news was young Naomi
Wildman who had been with Neelix when he heard the news.</P>
<P>"Wonderful, just wonderful," the furry chef and sometimes diplomat said as he
rubbed his yellow spotted hands together. "I’ll get to work on a reception right
away." He grabbed a padd from his kitchen counter and began accessing files.</P>
<P>"Is that all you’re gonna’ say?" asked Tom. </P>
<P>"Well, what else would I say?" Neelix asked, honestly confused by the
question. He looked down at Naomi who was standing beside him and noticed her
confused expression. "Naomi, honey? What is it?"</P>
<P>She tugged on the Talaxian’s sleeve and brought him down to her level to
whisper a question in his ear. "I thought Seven liked the captain?" she asked
with the innocence of youth.</P>
<P>He frowned, then smiled indulgently at the child. "No, dear. I don’t think
so."</P>
<P>"Neelix?" Tom persisted. "Aren’t you the least bit shocked? I mean…this is
B’Elanna…and Seven."</P>
<P>"Love comes in every mix, Mister Paris. Just look at what Kes and I shared.
Who would have thought such a delicate flower could have loved an old hedgehog
like me?" Neelix noticed Tom avoid his glance. "Yes, Tom, I know what some of
the crew calls me. I kind of like it. Hedgehogs are very handsome animals."</P>
<P>Naomi giggled as she realized how much Neelix did look like the pictures she
had seen of hedgehogs. Her giggles changed to a squeal when the giant hedgehog
in question bent down and snorted at her and then rooted around her neck.</P>
<P>"Well, uh," Tom said with a sigh. "I have to go," he said as he turned and
fled the mess hall to continue spreading the juiciest piece of gossip on board
in years.</P>
<P>Neelix waved to the Ensign as he left then gave Naomi his full attention.
"Now then, Miss Wildman, I’m going to need an assistant to plan a wedding
reception, and as one of Seven’s best friends, that responsibility would usually
fall onto you. Are you up for it?"</P>
<P>"Yes," she answered, her tiny face completely serious about the grave
responsibility she was being given.</P>
<P>"All right then," he said as he looked over his padd. "I’m pretty sure I can
find some information on Klingon and human rituals, but I’m not sure there will
be anything on Borg joinings."</P>
<P>"The Borg don’t join, Neelix." Naomi said as she gave him a tolerant smile.
"They assimilate."</P>
<P>"Well, that wouldn’t be much fun at a reception, now would it?" he asked as
he rubbed his chin with mock seriousness. "We can’t have the guests sprouting
implants, that would ruin their tuxedos."</P>
<P>Naomi giggled and rolled her eyes.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Captain to the bridge," Chakotay’s voice said over the communication system.
Janeway looked up from the padd on her desk and stood, making her way out of the
ready room and toward the bridge. She came through the doors and looked up to
the viewscreen at one of the biggest warships she had ever seen.</P>
<P>"Report," she demanded as she took her seat.</P>
<P>"Captain, that warship just came up behind us and is matching our course.
We’ve changed our heading twice and they’ve adjusted to match us each time,"
Chakotay explained. He rubbed the tattoo over his eye as he stared at the
viewscreen.</P>
<P>"Have you hailed them?" Janeway asked Ensign Kim who was currently standing
at the Ops station.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am. Four times, no response." He checked his comm panel even as he
spoke to make sure he didn’t miss some vital bit of information.</P>
<P>"Open hailing frequencies," she ordered.</P>
<P>"Open," Harry said as he tapped the keypad in front of him. </P>
<P>"This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship <I>Voyager</I>,
please state your intentions." She didn’t want to start out being rude.</P>
<P>"They’re responding," Harry said, his surprise evident. The viewscreen image
changed to show a Dengari man with graying temples sitting in an overstated
command chair that had intricate carvings and large swirling armrests.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, are you in the habit of having your underlings greet
dignitaries?" the man asked. His tone was a mix of disgust and concern.</P>
<P>"I’m not in the habit of explaining my actions to strangers," she responded
dryly.</P>
<P>"I am the Magistrate," he said, offend she didn’t recognize him.</P>
<P>"That explains the chair," she said quietly to Chakotay who choked down a
laugh. "What can I do for you, Magistrate?" she asked cautiously.</P>
<P>"Return my two prisoners," he said casually, then actually bent his fingers
and examined his fingernails.</P>
<P>"We don’t have any of your prisoners." Janeway stood and put her hands on her
hips. "The members of my crew that were in your custody finished their
sentences."</P>
<P>"Yes, but they killed two men on board the transport ship." He stood as well,
but leaned against the massive chair in a relaxed manner. "I have generously
agreed to not consider them fugitives. Normally I would interpret their leaving
as another crime, but the Overseer convinced me to show leniency."</P>
<P>"Those men were trying to kill them," Janeway said. "Don’t you know anything
about self-defense?" her voice sounded like she had swallowed gravel, deep and
reverberating, mimicking a mother bear’s growl, a perfect measure of her
mood.</P>
<P>"Of course," he said. "We are a civilized species. Had in the prisoners
remained until my arrival, I would have given them a complete pardon on those
grounds." He sat down and griped the ornate arms of his chair. "But since they
left, undermining my authority, I had no choice but to find them guilty of
murder. I want them transferred to my custody at once."</P>
<P>"I don’t think so." Janeway sat in her chair and tossed one leg over the
other. "Tuvok, yellow alert."</P>
<P>"This needn’t be an adversarial discussion," he said, but his eyes said the
opposite.</P>
<P>"Too late," Janeway said. "You might as well turn around and go home. You
won’t get my people."</P>
<P>His eyes narrowed, then he looked off screen and nodded. The Overseer walked
into the screen.</P>
<P>"Captain, I think we can work this out… to all our satisfaction. If you would
just come over to our ship with the prisoners, we can work this out."</P>
<P>"Overseer, since the day I met you, every word out of your mouth has been a
half truth or an outright lie. You’ll forgive me if I don’t trust you," Janeway
said.</P>
<P>"Yes, I will," the Overseer said and smiled. She looked at the Magistrate.
"Perhaps we could meet on their ship?"</P>
<P>"That is highly irregular," the Magistrate said.</P>
<P>"Irregular or not, I would be willing to allow you and the Overseer to come
on board. However, my ship will handle the transport, and your ship will have to
take its weapons and transporters off line." Janeway steepled her fingers
together and let the ball shoot into their court.</P>
<P>"Am I supposed to come over there without a security team?" He asked, clearly
not willing to making the agreement without some petty concession on Janeway’s
part.</P>
<P>"I think I can let you bring one guard... unarmed," the captain said. She
rather enjoyed demanding her own petty concession from the pompous
magistrate.</P>
<P>The Overseer cleared her throat. "I’m sure my captain of the guard would be
honored to accompany the Magistrate," she said.</P>
<P>"Very well," the Magistrate said. "In one standard hour," he decreed.</P>
<P>"Why don’t we make it two. I have an urgent matter to attend," Janeway said.
The urgent matter was taking some of the wind out of the Magistrate’s sail.</P>
<P>"I will allow it," the Magistrate said as if he was the one in control all
along.</P>
<P>"Fine, my security chief will contact your people, Janeway out," she said as
she disengaged the channel from her comm panel. "Tuvok, I want the ship on full
alert until further notice."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The entire senior staff was present in the conference room, scattered around
the table. All eyes darted back and forth between the Klingon and the exBorg,
except for Tom, whose eyes were locked on Seven. She was unaffected by his
attempt at intimidation. She had faced down the Borg Queen, so Tom Paris’
childish attempts to unsettle her were actually amusing.</P>
<P>The senior staff had almost concluded their brief meeting when the question
of whether or not Torres and Seven would meet with the Magistrate came up.</P>
<P>"Oh, I’ll meet with him," B’Elanna said to Janeway with a menacing smile. "In
fact, maybe he and I should spend a little quality time alone."</P>
<P>"Somehow," Seven said, "I do not think he would enjoy the quality of the
visit you have in mind." The exdrone moved her chair closer to B’Elanna and
lifted an eyebrow high onto her forehead. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Janeway said, "as satisfying as that would be...for all of us,
I don’t think it’s going to happen." The captain glanced around the table and
then cleared her throat. "Now, I think we should focus on preparing, and we need
to hurry so that we have options."</P>
<P>The Doctor leaned forward. "Well, giving B’Elanna and Seven to them isn’t an
option," he said, pointing out the obvious, a task usually handled by
Chakotay.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said within an unamused crinkle of her brow.</P>
<P>Tom finally spoke. "Well, from what I read in the report, both of them did
not kill those men."</P>
<P>"You are correct, Mr. Paris," Seven said. Her hand reached under the table
and squeezed B’Elanna’s convincing the Klingon by hold her tongue. Seven
continued. "I killed them, Mr. Paris. They hurt my wife, and I dealt with them."
She leveled her lapis blue eyes on the Helmsman.</P>
<P>"You acted in self-defense," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Tuvok, I need you to make sure there aren’t any surprises when they arrive."
Janeway looked around the table. "As for the rest of you, make sure your
departments are on their toes. Tuvok has some special instructions for each of
you." She pushed her chair away from the table. "I think we’re done here."</P>
