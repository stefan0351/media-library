<P>Tom watched the Vulcan security chief disappear and then looked back at
Seven. He expected to see her eyes turned completely Borg with the blue entirely
hidden. He had seen her face go blank on many occasions, and while it was
unnerving, he was used to it. What he saw this time terrified him.</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to one side and leaned into Tom’s chest, his legs
swaying from side to side several inches from the ground. "You wanted me to
think that my wife had been unfaithful," Seven said. "That will never happen,
and I will kill you if you ever try to come between us again," she whispered in
his ear, her voice shook, and her eyes were bright blue and full of rage. Her
face was as wild and feral, and human as Tom had ever seen. Her Borg control was
gone, leaving behind a human pushed past the edge, a human with the strength of
five Vulcans, and her hand was wrapped around his throat.</P>
<P>"Seven, please," Tom begged. His body shook and he was sweating profusely.
"Please, I…Please," tears rolled down his cheeks. Seven’s jaw quivered as she
fought to stop from snapping his neck.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok entered the corridor and stood just outside the door listening. He knew
that if he stepped in now, the animosity between Seven and Tom Paris would only
continue. He had listened as Seven and B’Elanna had talked in Engineering. Seven
had been the one convincing Lieutenant Torres to leave Paris alone. Tuvok had
stood quietly, off to one end of the large engine room, his Vulcan ears easily
picking up their whispered discussion. He had been appalled when he had heard
Torres describe the use of Vulcan athletic balm in an attempt to make her appear
unfaithful. He knew that Paris wasn’t intimidated by discipline or the brig.
Perhaps he would be intimidated by a six-foot tall blonde Borg. </P>
<P>Tuvok stood with his hands behind his back listening to the sounds from the
mess hall. He would intervene only if he felt it was absolutely necessary. It
was an orthodox method, but as the captain liked to say, "desperate times called
for desperate measures." He heard the turbolift open and turned to see the
captain walking toward him. Times suddenly became more desperate.</P>
<P>"Tuvok?" Janeway asked with a faint smile as she came alongside him. "What
are you doing out here?"</P>
<P>He paused before speaking. He once again wished that he didn’t have to deal
with humans.</P>
<P>"What’s going on?" Janeway asked. She studied the dark, handsome Vulcan, and
if she didn’t know better, she would say he looked like he had just been caught
with his hand in the cookie jar.</P>
<P>"I am letting Seven of Nine and Mr. Paris…come to an understanding." He
raised one eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Oh, god, Tuvok. She’ll kill him," Janeway said. She was also aware of Tom’s
plot to frame B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I do not believe she would take a life in front of the Narian child," he
pointed out.</P>
<P>"I can’t believe you did this. We will talk about this later," she promised.
"Now, let’s get in there."</P>
<P>They entered the mess hall to find Harry Kim standing next to Tom. Harry had
one arm holding up Tom, and the other hand on Seven’s shoulder. The rest of the
small group was sitting back watching.</P>
<P>"Everyone just calm down," Harry said. "Seven, I will make sure Tom backs
off."</P>
<P>"Me? She’s the one who moved in on Lana," Tom whined.</P>
<P>"Tom, shut up," Harry ordered. He was having a hard enough time keeping Seven
from grabbing Tom’s neck again.</P>
<P>"Excuse me," Janeway said sweetly. "I’m not interrupting, am I?" She walked
over and let her eyes stop on Harry’s efforts to control the two combatants.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tom said happily. "Thank god you’re here. That Borg was just…"</P>
<P>Harry shoved Tom back into the wall. "Seven was just showing Tom a
few…Tsunkatse moves," Harry said pointedly.</P>
<P>"I suspected that would be your explanation," Tuvok said as he stood beside
the captain.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris?" Janeway asked. She noticed that Seven was strangely quiet,
and that her face was flushed.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am…Tsunkatse," Tom said and then sighed and rolled his eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Janeway asked turning to the exBorg.</P>
<P>Seven took a calming breath and released it. "I believe Mister Paris now has
a rudimentary understanding of the…technique. I will however be…happy to
instruct him further should it become necessary."</P>
<P>"See that it doesn’t," Janeway ordered. Her voice was deep and smoky and let
everyone know that she wouldn’t tolerate any more from any of them.</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said as she pulled free from Harry’s grip and went back
to her wife.</P>
<P>Tom let out a long relieved sigh. </P>
<P>"Mister Paris, I won’t tolerate your childish behavior anymore," Janeway
said, her voice rumbling. "You’ve used up all of your chances. Is that
understood?"</P>
<P>"Sure," Tom said dismissively.</P>
<P>"Is that understood?" she asked again, letting some of her anger lace through
her silky voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," he said seriously.</P>
<P>"I suggest you go back to your quarters," Janeway said quietly. She reached
out and stopped him as he moved past her. "And Mister Paris, I <I>strongly</I>
suggest that you leave the use of Vulcan medical balms to Tuvok or Vorik. Is
<I>that</I> understood?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," he said and then scurried away. As he passed Nara and Tach, Ty
leaned into his mother and glared at the helmsman.</P>
<P>Janeway let her face return to her diplomatic benign interested look and then
joined the small group. She noticed Harry sneak out as she stepped next to
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Tach, Nara, how are you enjoying your tour?" the captain asked.</P>
<P>"You have a fine ship," Nara said. She shifted Ty to the opposite hip and
looked at Seven who was still visibly upset. "A little more excitement than I
prefer before a meal."</P>
<P>"Well," Janeway said, pinning first B’Elanna and then Seven with her command
glare, "I think we’re through having excitement."</P>
<P>"I hope so," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Go to Ba." Ty held out his arms and the Klingon smiled and took him. His
face lit up despite how tired he was. "Bad man," Ty said as he looked at the
door.</P>
<P>"Shh, he’s gone, you little tiger." B’Elanna kissed his head and tickled him.
He squirmed and giggled.</P>
<P>"Seven, I thought you were supposed to be resting," Janeway said. </P>
<P>"I knew that Mister Neelix would finish his tour in the mess hall. I wanted
to see how Tach and Nara were," Seven explained. "I was unaware that Ensign
Paris would be present."</P>
<P>"I see," the captain said. She had the same idea herself, figuring Neelix
would end up in his mess hall so that he could get the visitors a late lunch
since both shifts of <I>Voyager’s</I> midday meal had already passed. "Now that
you’ve checked on them, perhaps you should rest."</P>
<P>"I tried to tell her that," B’Elanna said as she rubbed Seven’s waist with
her free hand. "But did she listen?"</P>
<P>"Not likely," Nara said with a snort.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled despite herself.</P>
<P>"I assure you, I was well rested," Seven insisted.</P>
<P>"Bull," Janeway said. "Go back to your quarters and rest. That’s an
order."</P>
<P>Seven was going to protest, but one look at the relief that covered
B’Elanna’s face changed her mind. "Yes, Captain."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several hours later, the Doctor and Harry Kim stood in holodeck one studying
a series of complex algorithms and matrix designs. The Doctor was a hologram,
and yet many of the computations left him scratching his holographic head.</P>
<P>"What’s the matter, Doc?" Harry asked. He stretched his back, tried from the
six hours he had spent in the holodeck already. "I didn’t think you got
tired."</P>
<P>"I don’t, Mister Kim, but I am…impressed by your ability to construct
holograms." The Doctor cleared his throat and held out the data padd to Harry.
"Can you integrate these files, or will that exceed the program’s capacity?"</P>
<P>Harry took the padd and checked several of the files. "Well, normally, I’d
say yes, but the captain did say that we could use as much of the computer’s
memory core as we need."</P>
<P>The Doctor crossed his arms over his chest. "Yes, well… I think that may have
been a little indulgent on her part. I mean, if we used all of the memory
available, this hologram would have more data than I do."</P>
<P>"Afraid of a little competition?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>"Hardly," the hologram responded a bit too quickly. "I just don’t see why we
need this secondary hologram at all."</P>
<P>"Well, uh…" Harry didn’t know how to respond. He knew exactly why they needed
the new hologram, but he didn’t know how to phrase it without insulting the
Doctor.</P>
<P>"I know, Mister Kim…Seven will be more comfortable with the new program." The
Doctor sighed and looked plaintively at Harry. "I just don’t know why the
captain couldn’t wait until Seven had a chance to calm down. We might not even
need this…this… replacement in a few days."</P>
<P>"Doc, no disrespect intended, but you did try to abort her…"</P>
<P>"I know what I did, Mister Kim," the Doctor yelled. "I had my reasons, and I
wish the captain would trust that I will respect her wishes now."</P>
<P>"Doc," Harry said gently. "It’s a matter of Seven not trusting you anymore.
She needs to trust her doctor. Don’t you want her to feel comfortable?"</P>
<P>"Of course I do," the hologram responded. "I just… well, I was looking
forward to delivering the baby."</P>
<P>"Maybe Seven will let you be there," Harry suggested, though he doubted the
exdrone would agree.</P>
<P>"Maybe," the Doctor said, but he also knew better. "Let’s bring this thing on
line," he said with false cheer.</P>
<P>"Okay," Harry said as he accessed the files. "Hey, how did you decide who to
model it after?"</P>
<P>"There were several doctors in the database, but this one stood out," the
Doctor explained. "She was a midwife in the Cardassian labor camps. I figured I
got into so much trouble with that Cardassian hologram, maybe I could make up
for it by having a Bajorian specialist."</P>
<P>"So she isn’t a doctor?" Harry asked as he began materializing the
hologram.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," the Doctor corrected. "She got her degree after the
occupation. She delivered thousands of children in the camps, and hundreds more
after she completed her medical degree. She is considered the leading Federation
expert on comparative birthing techniques."</P>
<P>"Yeah? Did she ever deliver a Borg?" Harry asked. He fine-tuned the data and
the short, dark haired Bajorian hologram materialized in front of them. She was
in her late forties, wearing traditional Bajorian garb, a forest green tunic and
pants and a long dangling ear cuff on one side. She stood motionless, not yet
having been programmed for any more than a physical matrix.</P>
<P>"Not likely, Mister Kim," the Doctor said, though he did smile. "She did
however spend two years on the Klingon homeworld helping to train midwives there
with some of the new advanced medical equipment. She also spent several years on
Earth."</P>
<P>"Wow, that’ll come in handy," Harry said as he tapped a few more buttons and
sent the first block of data to they new hologram’s matrix. The woman flickered
and then stabilized. Harry sent another data block and smiled as the short
woman’s blank expression shifted and she looked back at him curiously.</P>
<P>"Hello," she said politely. "Have we met?"</P>
<P>"Ah…no," Harry said.</P>
<P>"I am the Emergency Medical Hologram," the Doctor said formally. "We
programmed you as a specialist."</P>
<P>"Well, given the data I can access," she said with a smile, "I’m guessing
neither of you needs my help. I doubt that either of you is pregnant."<BR></P>
<P>"No," Harry said. He decided that the Doctor’s sarcastic subroutine must have
been incorporated into her matrix.</P>
<P>"The patient is carrying a one quarter Klingon, three quarter human child,"
the Doctor explained.</P>
<P>"What is the mother’s species?" she asked politely as she stepped closer.</P>
<P>Harry looked to the Doctor.</P>
<P>"She is primarily human… with…Borg implants," the Doctor said.</P>
<P>"Really? And she is no longer part of the Collective?" She asked excitedly.
"And the father? He’s part Klingon?"</P>
<P>"Actually," the Doctor said. "The secondary mother is half Klingon, half
human."</P>
<P>"Hmm, external ovum recombinant fertilization?" she asked, seeming to take
mental notes as she listened.</P>
<P>"No," the Doctor said. "It was in inter-utero technique…of Borg design."</P>
<P>"Ah," she said as she nodded her head. She steepled her fingers under her
chin and pursed her lips. "When do I meet them?"</P>
<P>"We need to finish programming you first," Harry said delicately.</P>
<P>"Yes, of course," she said. "I do have the Emergency Medical Hologram
subroutines, so I understand my basic nature. I am curious though, why this
personality subroutine?"</P>
<P>"You were the best qualified," the Doctor explained.</P>
<P>"Good," she said. Her deep brown eyes sparkled. "So, I guess you can call me…
Doctor Opaca? Although I do personally prefer just Opaca."</P>
<P>"Sure," Harry said. He thought he had heard the name before but wasn’t
sure.</P>
<P>"My sister would certainly have something to say about me." She laughed, an
infectious, yet refined giggle.</P>
<P>"Sister?" Harry asked, confused.</P>
<P>"Well, not <I>my</I> sister…the doctor I was modeled after. Her sister was
something of a philosopher. Perhaps you’ve heard of her… Kai Opaca?"</P>
<P>"The Kai?" Harry spun and gave the Doctor a dirty look. "We made a hologram
of the Kai’s sister? What are the Bajorian crewmembers gonna’ say?"</P>
<P>"Former Kai," the Doctor corrected.</P>
<P>"If I am any judge of Bajorian reactions," Opaca said, "I would guess that
they would say… hello."</P>
<P>"Great," Harry said. "Two smart-mouthed holograms. I can’t wait until
B’Elanna meets you. She’ll probably kill me for creating you."</P>
<P>Opaca smiled. "Are you close to my patients? Tell me about them," she
asked.</P>
<P>"Well, they, uh," Harry stammered. He suddenly remembered the request he had
put in to the ship’s stores two days earlier…for extra soundproofing. His
quarters were next to B’Elanna’s. She had already installed extra padding in the
walls when she had been dating Tom. Harry had no idea what B’Elanna and Seven
were doing every night, he just knew that he didn’t want to hear it all night
long. He felt his cheeks blushing.</P>
<P>"A feisty pair, I take it," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"Um, yeah," Harry answered as he hoped he never had to witness exactly how
feisty. He wasn’t sure he would survive that particular knowledge. As it was, he
had way too much information about their lovelife. He had heard Seven screaming
out something in Klingon one night, and his curiosity got the best of him. He
repeated the phrase for the computer and asked for a translation. It offered two
possible translations. The first was, "I need your Torpedoes, yes don’t be
lazy," which he was pretty sure wasn’t what Seven had screamed. The second
translation although most likely accurate, made him wish that he had just went
back to sleep and ignored the comment completely. It hadn’t occurred to him that
Seven would use profanity, certainly not the Klingon word for ‘fuck,’ and most
certainly not combined with a string of other curses arranged in a rather randy
set of descriptive instructions involving where and how to perform the
expletives. He definitely had way too much information about the couple.</P>
<P>The new hologram waited patiently as she watched Harry turn an even deeper
shade of red.</P>
<P>"Let’s get your matrix fixed and then answer questions later," Harry said. He
wanted the topic changed quickly.</P>
<P>"As you wish," she said with a smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna was sitting on one end of the in couch her quarters with Ty sleeping
next her. Ty’s head was nestled on the Klingon’s lap and he was rubbing her knee
while he slept. She had one hand resting on his small back and was watching
Seven sitting at the opposite side of the couch. Seven was concentrating a small
blanket she was attempting to knit. It was teal green and so far… it was about
four inches long by two feet wide. She was frowning at the offending item. No
matter how careful she was, she couldn’t get the blanket to be symmetrical.</P>
<P>Ty whimpered and smacked his lips in his sleep.</P>
<P>Seven looked down, noticing that he had dozed off, then let her eyes drift up
to meet B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"He finally quick fighting and went to sleep," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>Seven raised eyebrow and stopped knitting. She wrapped the yarn carefully in
the blanket and put it on the end table and then turned back to B’Elanna and
looked down at Ty.</P>
<P>"Do you want me to move him to the sleeper?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Not just yet," B’Elanna said. "Let’s make sure he’s completely out." She
looked over at the sleeper, a portable child’s bed with low sides. It was
similar to a cradle combined with a playpen, but was designed so that the child
would be kept safe from rolling around while sleeping but could easily climb out
once they were awake.</P>
<P>"You do not fool me, Be’nal," Seven said that she reached out and put her
hand over B’Elanna’s on Ty’s back. "You just want to steal a few more moments
with him."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, but didn’t deny the accusation.</P>
<P>"I have something to take care of," Seven said as she stood. "Enjoy your
guest. I will be back shortly."</P>
<P>"Where are you going?" B’Elanna asked without looking up. She was staring
down at Ty wondering what her daughter would look like. She hoped the baby was
going to have Seven’s features.</P>
<P>"I will explain when I return," Seven said cryptically.</P>
<P>"Okay…" B’Elanna looked up and smiled at her wife. "I can’t wait to hold our
daughter, my love."</P>
<P>Seven smiled and leaned down to kiss B’Elanna. She had intended to give her a
quick, chaste kiss, but was pleasantly surprised when B’Elanna’s hand snaked
around her neck and held her close while she kissed Seven deeply.</P>
<P>"I shall hurry." Seven caressed B’Elanna’s cheek. </P>
<P>"Are you sure you feel up to leaving?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I am fine, love," Seven assured her. "I regenerated for many hours in
Engineering as well as having a nap here."</P>
<P>"Hurry back…I miss you already," B’Elanna said. She blushed and looked
away.</P>
<P>"Do not feel embarrassed for missing me, Be’nal." Seven lifted her wife’s
chin and pressed her lips to B’Elanna’s in a searing kiss. "I will miss you as
well. I have plans for you this evening."</P>
<P>"I’ll get Ty settled for the night," B’Elanna promised.</P>
<P>Seven walked into the corridor and paused after the door hissed shut behind
her. "Computer, locate Ensign Tom Paris," she ordered.</P><I>
<P>*"Ensign Paris is in holodeck two,"*</I> the computer responded.</P>
<P>Seven turned and moved quickly toward the holodeck. She was extremely unhappy
with Tom Paris’ recent behavior and she knew that it had hurt B’Elanna deeply.
Despite the fact that Tom and B’Elanna had broken up, she knew her wife cared
for the boyish helmsman. As she had watched B’Elanna with Ty, she decided that
she would try to mend the fences between Ensign Paris and herself. Being Borg,
she did not believe in putting off anything. She decided that if Paris was in
the holodeck, he shouldn’t object to her talking to him. It was, after all, a
public location.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Opaca sighed and paced the grid in holodeck one. She was bored, tired of
listening to Harry Kim and the Doctor discuss which features to give her as if
she were the latest model on a shuttlecraft sales lot. </P>
<P>Harry shook his head. "No, that doesn’t make sense," he told the Doctor. "Why
should we incorporate all of your medical training?"</P>
<P>"Because," the Doctor said sharply, "If we are going to have a second medical
hologram, why not make it capable of helping during any emergency?"</P>
<P>"Oh, well, that makes sense." Harry turned to the new hologram. "Doctor
Opaca? Do you have any preferences? Anything you’d like added?"</P>
<P>The short Bajorian turned and went over to Harry. "Actually, I’d like to meet
my patients. If I’m going to deliver their child, I need to develop a
relationship with them, let them grow to trust me." She looked over at the
Doctor. "Especially after what happened with you," she added, though it was said
with compassion, not reproach.</P>
<P>"Well, I…" the Doctor nodded. "I guess it is a good thing the captain agreed
to this. It’s probably the best thing for everyone involved."</P>
<P>"From what you’ve told me," Opaca said, "Seven thinks of you as a mentor. You
care deeply for her, so it is best that you have someone else to step in to take
care of her."</P>
<P>"Hey, Doc?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>Both holograms turned.</P>
<P>"No, umm… I meant <I>the</I> Doc," he corrected as he pointed to
<I>Voyager’s</I> doctor.</P>
<P>"Yes, Mister Kim," he asked.</P>
<P>"I have an idea how we can speed up the trust factor with Seven and Doctor
Opaca," Harry explained.</P>
<P>"Really?" the Doctor asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Harry said enthusiastically. "It’s something Tom came up with when he
created Fairhaven. He wanted the crew to interact on a more personal level with
the characters, so he added some synthetic pheromones. He said if the holograms
put off the signals that our subconscious recognized as human, we would feel
closer to them."</P>
<P>"What?" the Doctor demanded. "Exactly which pheromones did he add to the
program…and how did he get the computer to allow them to be used near the
crew?"</P>
<P>"Well, pheromones are harmless, right?" Harry asked. "Tom just used the
computer database to incorporate the different signals from the studies on human
hormonal interaction. He was really excited about it. He said it would be a
breakthrough in holographic design."</P>
<P>Opaca stepped up beside Harry. "If you’re talking about the Hamilton hormonal
study of 2330, that was with strictly naturally occurring pheromones in human
social interactions. It was not related to synthetic pheromones. They are quite
different." </P>
<P>"I’ll say," the Doctor said grimly. "Prolonged exposure to some synthetic
pheromones can cause emotional and psychological side effects."</P>
<P>"Side effects?" Harry asked, his voice cracking.</P>
<P>"Did he include any…sexual pheromones?" Opaca rested her hand on Harry’s
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Ha," the Doctor said with a snort. "If you had ever met Mister Paris, I
don’t think you’d have to ask that question."</P>
<P>"Why?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>"Because," Opaca explained, "Synthetic hormones…especially those involved in
sexual attraction… have been found to have prolonged effects. They can make
people become irrational, possessive, and even violent."</P>
<P>"That explains Mister Paris’ recent behavior," the Doctor said quietly. He
turned to his new colleague. "Mister Paris has been exhibiting all of those
behaviors."</P>
<P>"Anyone else?" Opaca asked.</P>
<P>"Well, the only characters that have the pheromonal interface are…Becca,
Sullivan, and Geary, the town crier. We figured if we had too many of the
characters putting off hormones it would get confusing," Harry said. He suddenly
pictured Sullivan crying in his beer over the captain, and then thought about
the fact that she had been ‘in love’ with the hologram. It was an irrational
reaction, especially for the reserved Janeway. When she found out about the
phenomenal interface, he and Tom were both going to be pulling extra duty for
the rest of the flight home.</P>
<P>"I don’t think anyone else was effected," the Doctor said happily. "Mister
Paris spent a great deal of time in the program, and most of that was with
Becca, so he would have had a great deal of exposure."</P>
<P>"The captain," Harry said. "She was with Sullivan…a lot."</P>
<P>"Oh dear," the Doctor said as the ramifications hit him. The captain had
known something was amiss in her relationship with the hologram, and he had
counseled her to keep seeing him. "At least she broke up with him," he added,
suddenly hopeful that she hadn’t been effected. "She couldn’t have done that if
she was being bombarded by the pheromones."</P>
<P>Opaca nodded. "True, unless she had some type of extreme emotional shock that
would have overrode the pheromones." She smiled at her holographic companion.
"It’s in your databanks. The studies on synthetic hormones from the Jergenson
case studies on Risa found that the artificial hormones could be drowned out by
genuine emotional reactions."</P>
<P>"Of course," he said, brushing off imaginary dust from his tunic sleeve. "My
databanks are extensive."</P>
<P>"Our databanks," she corrected.</P>
<P>"Umm…doctors?" Harry asked. "What are we gonna do about Tom?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes," the Doctor responded. He looked over at Harry with a worried
expression. "We should find him, of course, and make sure that no one else runs
the Fairhaven program. Hopefully it requires massive amounts of exposure to have
any effect."</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim?" Doctor Opaca asked. "Can you give us the specs on the
pheromonal interface so that we can figure out how much the various crewmembers
were exposed to?"</P>
<P>"Sure," Harry said as he went to the console to get the information. "I just
hope Tom stays away from Seven and B’Elanna until we can get him back to
normal."</P>
<P>"We’ll contact him as soon as we take a look at these specs. Even Mister
Paris can’t get into any trouble in an hour or so," the Doctor said.</P>

<P>Seven reached the holodeck and saw that the Fairhaven program was in use, but
then noticed that there were security lockouts in effect. The Fairhaven program
was supposed to be open to all of the crew, so Seven felt justified when she
used her Borg algorithms to override the lockout. She walked into the program
and went to the bar, the most likely place to find Ensign Paris. She expected to
find him with the holographic bartender. She found him, and he was with a
hologram, but it was not the bartender.</P>
<P>Seven reached out and steadied herself on the oak table near the door. Her
Borg enhanced left hand crushed the wooden frame as she watched Tom Paris laying
on top of a hologram on the bar. The hologram was a well designed replica of
B’Elanna, and the holographic B’Elanna seemed to be enjoying the exchange.</P>
<P>"Tell me it’s me you want," Tom told the hologram as he kissed her neck.</P>
<P>"It’s you, Tom. It’s always been you," the holo-B’Elanna said. "I was just
killing time with that Borg."</P>
<P>"I knew it," Tom said smugly. "And that bastard child?" he asked. "Why?"</P>
<P>"It’s you I want, Tom. She wanted the kid, not me," the fake B’Elanna said as
she wrapped her legs around Tom’s waist.</P>
<P>Seven decided that any fence mending with Tom Paris was a waste of time. Her
time would be better spent constructing a casket for him, because she was going
to kill him.</P>
<P>"Deactivate Torres hologram," Seven ordered. Her voice was shaking almost as
much as her clenched fists were.</P>
<P>Tom’s body dropped to the bar, having lost his artificial B’Elanna body
pillow. "What the hell?" he asked as his face hit the oak bar.</P>
<P>Seven moved toward him in a slow, deliberate arch, taking note of the
possible tactical uses of every chair, glass, and table. Her face was contorted
with rage and indignation that he would copulate with a replica of her wife.</P>
<P>"You!" Tom yelled when he saw Seven coming toward him. "This is a private
program. What the hell are you doing here?" He jumped down and stood to his full
height. He felt his own rage growing as the woman who took B’Elanna from him now
took his holographic Lana as well. He wasn’t going to stand for it.</P>
<P>"A private program?" she asked. Her voice was now strangely calm as she
watched his anger rippling to the surface. Every species she had assimilated
gave her insight into humanoid behavior, and every one of those instincts told
her that this man was about to snap. "You dare replicate my wife? Dishonor her
by using her image as a concubine? You dare ask me what I am doing here?"</P>
<P>"Get out." Tom moved over to her and glared daggers at her. His jaw trembled
as he tried to clamp down his hatred.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said defiantly. She linked her hands behind her back and tilted
her head to the side.</P>
<P>"Fine by me," he responded. He leaned back and swung at her with his entire
weight behind his punch. </P>
<P>Seven saw the blow coming and shifted her jaw to one side an instant before
it hit. The minute adjustment took most of the force out of the hit, but he was
still able to connect with her face. She felt her lip split and her warm blood
trickled down her chin. She smiled.</P>
<P>Tom stared in disbelief. He had just hit Seven…a woman…a pregnant woman. He
had hit B’Elanna’s wife… B’Elanna’s pregnant wife. He was going to die. B’Elanna
would rip his heart out of his chest and devour it in front of him. Then he saw
the smile on Seven’s face, a dangerous and primal smile, more like a snarl.
B’Elanna wouldn’t get a chance to kill him. Seven would rip him in half before
B’Elanna ever knew what happened.</P>
<P>"Seven…" Tom began. He looked at the blood dripping off her chin staining the
pale purple blouse she was wearing.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said coolly as she stepped toward him.</P>
<P>"Huh?" he asked, backing away from the exBorg.</P>
<P>"I am now completely justified in whatever action I take," she explained. She
stalked him like the prey he had become, sliding chairs out of her way when he
would duck behind them seeking refuge.</P>
<P>"Uh, Seven… I didn’t mean to hit you… besides, what does it hurt if I have my
own Lana?" Even in the face of a predatory Borg he didn’t have enough sense to
stop claiming B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"She is not yours," Seven stated as she grabbed a chair with one hand and
tossed it completely across the bar. It landed almost five feet up the wall,
shattering on impact. "She is not even mine. She is her own. No one has the
right to replicate her for their depraved interests." She grabbed another chair
and tossed it in the opposite direction. This chair hit the window and crashed
through it.</P>
<P>"When I was with her, she <I>was</I> mine," Tom taunted. "She’s just staying
with you because of … that," he yelled, pointing at her belly. "She thought
she’d never get back to <I>Voyager</I>…to me… so she settled for you."</P>
<P>"That will no longer be an issue," Seven said calmly. "You will not be on
board <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"Oh really, where will I be?" he asked. </P>
<P>Becca, the holographic bartender, came wandering in, curious about the chair
that had come flying out of the tavern’s front window. Seven was momentarily
distracted.</P>
<P>Tom used the opportunity and shoved a chair at Seven and then moved along the
wall to escape. The chair slammed into Seven’s leg, causing her to spin back
toward him. Tom ducked behind Becca, using her as an impromptu bodyguard.</P>
<P>"Now, lassie, what is the problem?" Becca asked.</P>
<P>Seven reached up and snapped the hologram’s neck in almost the exact way
B’Elanna had weeks earlier. Her body dropped to the floor and Tom was now facing
Seven, with the wall at his back and nowhere to run. Then he made the worst
mistake of the already disastrous night, he swung at Seven again.</P>
<P>She caught his fist in her hand and squeezed. She squeezed as he dropped to
the floor screaming, she squeezed as she heard the bones in his hand shatter,
and she continued squeezing until she heard him whimper like a whipped dog. She
let his hand drop from hers and grabbed him by the collar of his shirt. He was
trying to hold his shattered hand and let out a whelp as she lifted him into the
air and pinned him to the wall.</P>
<P>"For as long as I can remember," Seven said in a whisper. "You have made
distasteful remarks about me… rude, sexually charged comments. Well, I am about
to make one of your wishes come true."</P>
<P>"What?" he asked. <I>‘I’m scared spitless, and now Seven is coming onto me?’
</I>he thought.</P>
<P>"When I came on board…you frequently commented when I entered a room that you
would, ‘<I>let her assimilate me any day,’</I>" Seven said. "Well, any day is
here." She reached up and held him in place with her right hand and eased back
her left hand. She held it up in front of him as the assimilation tubules
erupted from the back of her wrist and wriggled like tiny cobras looking for a
victim.</P>
<P>"You’re bluffing," he whispered, praying he was right.</P>
<P>"The Federation thought the Borg were bluffing at Wolf 359," Seven said as
she moved her hand toward his throat. "Borg do not bluff," she said as the
tubules danced across his skin.</P>
<P>"No," he whimpered. He vaguely felt a warmth spreading from the inside of his
leg moving down to his thigh. He wondered if that was what assimilation felt
like, then realized he had just lost control of his bladder.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The captain led Nara and Tach down the corridor toward the holodeck. The two
Narians had joined her for dinner. It gave her a much-needed break from the
daily grind of being Captain. After a light meal, Tach had asked to see the
holodeck, something he had heard B’Elanna explain in detail. He understood the
way it looked and the way it worked, but he was intrigued to see how holograms
could seem to have substance.</P>
<P>"You can’t be serious?" Kathryn asked Nara. The captain was laughing, trying
to retain some composure as she almost snorted. It was difficult considering
that she had heard a litany of stories about B’Elanna and Seven, many extremely
humorous and all giving her insight into the love her two officers shared.</P>
<P>"Oh, I’m serious," Nara said with an evil grin. "Every morning, B’Elanna
would make hot raspberry tea and bring it to Seven in bed. That woman is so
spoiled. I swear, Seven couldn’t wake up without it."</P>
<P>"Seven’s never had any trouble getting up early. Not ever," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>Nara looked at the captain skeptically then smiled in understanding. "That
was before she had her feisty wife keeping her up all night."</P>
<P>"Nara," Tach exclaimed. </P>
<P>"Oh, please," Nara said to him. "I know how much sleep we lost just living
next to them. I can’t even imagine how exhausting their late-night antics must
be. It’s a miracle they survived at all."</P>
<P>Janeway tried not to react, but she felt her cheeks warm as she blushed.</P>
<P>"You’re embarrassing the captain," Tach said.</P>
<P>"Not at all," Kathryn said diplomatically. "I’m just not used to thinking
about those two as a couple," she said honestly.</P>
<P>"Great goddess," Tach said. "I can’t imagine those to not together. I’ve
never seen a more fated bond."</P>
<P>"I’m beginning to see that," Janeway said as they neared the holodeck. "And I
assure you, they won’t be keeping you up on board <I>Voyager</I>. Our
soundproofing is state-of-the-art," she added with a wry grin. She didn’t add
that the crewmembers on each side of B’Elanna’s quarters had recently
requisitioned extra soundproofing.</P>
<P>The doors to the turbolift opened and Samantha and Naomi Wildman rushed out,
ready for an adventure with Flotter. The Captain’s Bridge Assistant smiled when
she saw Janeway and she looked at the newcomers with interest.</P>
<P>Samantha Wildman stood at attention, her instincts as an ensign overriding
the fact that she was off duty. "Ma’am," she said formally.</P>
<P>"At ease," Janeway said warmly. "You’re off duty."</P>
<P>Tach stared at the child and a huge grin covered his features. "Great goddess
above and below," he said with a laugh. "You must be Naomi Wildman."</P>
<P>"Yes," Naomi answered.</P>
<P>"By the goddess, I thought Seven was exaggerating," Nara said as she knelt in
front of the younger Wildman.</P>
<P>"Are you Seven and B’Elanna’s friends from the planet?" Naomi asked.</P>
<P>The Captain cleared her throat. "May I introduce Tach and Nara." She smiled
at the Narians. "This is indeed Naomi Wildman, my Bridge Assistant. I’m sure she
can answer any questions that you have about my ship." She glanced over at
Ensign Wildman who beamed proudly. "This is Ensign Samantha Wildman, a valued
member of my crew."</P>
<P>"A supreme pleasure to meet you," Tach said as he looked up at Samantha
Wildman. </P>
<P>"Yes," Nara added. "Tell me, little one, did Seven tell you about your
namesake?"</P>
<P>"Uh huh," Naomi responded. "Do I really look like a cow?" she asked,
scrunching her face up.</P>
<P>"No," Tach assured her. "It’s just that the cutest little calf had the same
color fur as your lovely hair." He reached out and smoothed her bangs out of her
eyes. "And it had the same adorable spikes."</P>
<P>"I wish I could have seen it," Naomi said quietly. "I’ve never met anyone
else with spikes."<BR></P>
<P>Nara looked at Janeway for an answer, but Samantha responded.</P>
<P>"Naomi’s father is in the Alpha Quadrant. She’s the only Katarian on board,"
Samantha said as she rubbed Naomi’s back.</P>
<P>"Well," Nara said as she stood. "I wish I were lucky enough to have spikes.
Maybe then Tach would listen to me," she added as she gave her spouse a gentle
head butt.</P>
<P>The doors to holodeck one opened and Harry Kim rushed out followed closely by
the Doctor. The dark haired Ensign almost knocked over his captain before he
could stop.</P>
<P>"What’s the hurry, Mister Kim?" Janeway asked with a bit of a smile. She
rested her hand on his shoulder and moved slightly back.</P>
<P>"Uh, Tom… Seven," he managed as he looked over at the door to holodeck
two.</P>
<P>"What?" Janeway demanded. She had been very clear when she had ordered Seven
to rest, and she had been equally clear that Paris was to stay away from
Seven.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor said hurriedly. "Can we discuss this later? Right now
Ensign Paris is under the effects of his own misguided holo-programming and he
is with Seven."</P>
<P>"Let’s go," Janeway said as she stepped out of the way. She followed them to
the other holodeck with Nara and Tach in tow. Samantha kept Naomi in the
corridor, but waited to see what was happening.</P>
<P>The captain followed Harry and the Doctor into the Fairhaven program. She was
surprised by the feeling of dread the once familiar setting now caused within
her. She wondered how she could have ever spent time in this fantasy world when
she had a real life on board <I>Voyager</I>. Her musings were interrupted by a
terrified scream coming from the tavern.</P>
<P>They ran toward the sound and saw a broken chair on its side on top of the
shattered glass that used to be the tavern’s window. Janeway grabbed Harry’s arm
and pushed her way to the front of the caravan and she entered the bar
first.</P>
<P>She saw Seven holding Tom pressed against the wall with his feet swinging
underneath him.</P>
<P>Seven stared Tom in the eyes, then dropped him to the floor. He fell to his
knees and looked down at his legs, quickly confirming that he had indeed wet his
pants.</P>
<P>"Borg do not bluff," Seven repeated. "Be thankful that I am no longer Borg."
She let her hands drop to her sides and turned to leave, surprised to see Harry,
the Doctor, and most disturbing…the captain, standing in the doorway. Nara and
Tach joined the small group and stood behind them.</P>
<P>Janeway began to give Seven her most lethal force ten Janeway glare, but the
exdrone didn’t even flinch. Then captain noticed the blood on Seven chin and
blouse, and Janeway flinched. "What happened?" she asked, concern filling her
voice.</P>
<P>"Computer, activate Torres hologram," Seven said as she stopped in front of
Janeway. She raised her eyebrow and the Borg eyepiece that framed it.</P>
<P>Janeway watched as a holographic B’Elanna appeared and instantly ran to Tom,
who was curled into a ball on the floor. He hadn’t even looked up when the
captain and the others had entered.</P>
<P>"Tom, darling, what happened?" the holo-B’Elanna asked as she stroked his
back soothingly. She looked over at Seven and frowned. "I can’t believe I ever
put up with you, Borg. Tom is the only one I want."</P>
<P>Janeway bit her lip and let out a disgusted sigh. "Computer, end program,"
she ordered. The Fairhaven program disappeared, leaving the room black with
yellow grid lines. Tom remained huddled on the floor even as the Doctor rushed
over and began scanning him.</P>
<P>"What did you do to him?" Janeway asked. She was thankful that Paris was
still in relatively good condition. It was strictly against protocol and good
taste to use holograms based on crewmembers. Using Seven’s wife went beyond all
rational thought considering the amount of devotion she had displayed.</P>
<P>"More than you would have preferred," Seven told Janeway, "less than he
deserved."</P>
<P>"Did he do this?" Kathryn asked as she wiped the blood from Seven chin.</P>
<P>"He struck me. When he attempted to hit me again, I…stopped him." Seven
looked over at the Helmsman who had finally sat up. </P>
<P>"She tried to assimilate me," Tom said. He looked down at the puddle he was
sitting in and blushed.</P>
<P>"Had I attempted to assimilate you, you would already be a drone," Seven
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Doctor, how is he?" Harry asked as he moved closer to his friend.</P>
<P>"His brain chemistry is completely out of balance. I can’t believe you two
manipulated pheromones," the Doctor said as he shook his head.</P>
<P>"It wasn’t my idea," Harry whined.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris," the Doctor said as he yanked Tom to his feet. "Your hand is
broken. You should report directly to sickbay…" he paused and looked down at
Tom’s trousers, "Have the replicator in sickbay make you some pants." He gave
Tom a hypospray injection to ease the pain of his injury and then pushed him
toward the door.</P>
<P>"What’s wrong with him? Other than his hand?" Janeway asked as she moved over
to the Doctor. </P>
<P>"It’s a long story," the hologram stalled. He didn’t want to explain that she
had been slipped a hormonal mickey that had caused her to sleep with a hologram
and think that she was in love with it.</P>
<P>"We’re 35,000 light years from home…I think I have time to hear it," Janeway
replied.</P>
<P>Tach moved to Seven and placed his large, meaty hand on her shoulder, turning
her toward him. "How are you?" he asked as he inspected her split lip.</P>
<P>"I am… angry," Seven said carefully.</P>
<P>"Hey," Nara yelled at the Doctor. "She’s bleeding over here. Aren’t you
gonna’ do something?"</P>
<P>"Ah, yes," he said happily. "Duty calls," he told the captain and hurried
off.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tom Paris entered sickbay to find the Doctor waiting, and next to the
hologram was the captain. He had decided to change in his quarters, too
embarrassed to walk through the entire ship with soaked trousers. It was a
decision he was regretting. The painkiller the Doctor had given him had dulled
the pain, but when Tom had moved around to change clothes, it had aggravated the
injury. All he wanted now was to get the thing healed.</P>
<P>"Uh… ma’am," he said quietly. He suddenly wondered if changing his pants was
such a good idea because the look the captain was giving him almost made him
soil the clean pair he was wearing.</P>
<P>"Get over here, Mister Paris," the Doctor said as he pointed to the biobed.
"We need to fix that hand of yours."</P>
<P>"It hurts like hell, Doc." Tom carefully jumped onto the biobed. "Why didn’t
you mend it in the holodeck?"</P>
<P>"Given the volatile nature of the company, I thought getting you out of the
holodeck as quickly as possible seemed prudent," the Doctor explained. "I
expected you to report directly here. You are a medical assistant. I thought you
could administer your own analgesics." He scanned Tom’s hand and then moved the
medical tricorder up to scan his head. "Well, your brain chemistry has
stabilized. Now we just have to get it back to normal."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Tom asked.</P>
<P>"Your Fairhaven program," Janeway said as she moved closer. Her voice was
like dry ice, just as cold and just as likely to burn. "Your little addition of
pheromones seems to have created all kinds of problems… your hitting Seven is
just the latest symptom. If the Doctor hadn’t explained to me that you are not
acting under your own free will, you’d be in the brig right now."</P>
<P>"I can’t believe I did that," Tom said quietly. "Hey?" He looked up at the
Doctor. "What do you mean I’m not acting under my own free will?"</P>
<P>"The pheromones you exposed yourself to…and the rest of the crew… are
dangerous. They stimulated your own…baser reactions," the Doctor told him.
"Let’s just hope Lieutenant Torres thinks you should be shown leniency."</P>
<P>"How’s Seven?" Tom asked. He looked down at his feet while the Doctor mended
his broken hand.</P>
<P>"Fine," the Doctor said cheerfully. "Better than you. She broke almost every
bone in your hand."</P>
<P>"You should leave it," Tom said, disgusted by his own behavior. "I can’t
believe she didn’t kill me."</P>
<P>Janeway moved to the table and cleared her throat. "That’s not in her nature.
Even after you attacked her…" The captain winced as she remembered the swollen
and bloody wound on Seven’s lip. "She wouldn’t kill you." Janeway smiled, trying
to lighten the moment. "Now, if you had hit B’Elanna… I don’t think any amount
of security could have kept Seven from tossing you out an airlock."</P>
<P>"I’d never hit Lana," Tom said angrily, then realized that he wouldn’t have
expected himself to hit Seven. "But I see your point."</P>
<P>"There you are," the Doctor said with a smug smile. "Good as new. Now, all I
have to do is get your brain chemistry back in order."</P>
<P>"Oh, I can’t believe this," Tom groaned as he tested his freshly healed hand.
"Was anyone else effected?"</P>
<P>"Apparently, yes," Janeway said with disgust.</P>
<P>"Who?" Tom asked, then he realized the captain wasn’t hanging out in sickbay
to comfort him. "Oh, Captain…I’m sorry…Sullivan…"</P>
<P>"Until further notice, Mister Paris, you are restricted from any access to
the holodeck controls," Janeway said. "I need to have an engineering team go
through every program and make sure there’s no bleed-through into any other
characters."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." Tom sighed. "I’m just glad you didn’t have any of the problems
I did. At least the Sullivan program didn’t screw up your life."</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said as she went back to her own biobed. She almost laughed
out loud. Hadn’t screwed up her life? She made a fool of herself by swooning
over a hologram and that foolish behavior drove Seven out of her life forever.
True, she was happy for B’Elanna and Seven, but she couldn’t stop wondering…what
if?</P>
<P>"If I hadn’t messed up with this program," Tom said as he picked at the
blanket under him, "I’d still be with B’Elanna." </P>
<P>"And she wouldn’t be happy," Janeway said with complete conviction. "I know
that you don’t want to hear this, Tom…" <I>‘Hell, I don’t want to hear it
either,’</I> she thought. "But B’Elanna and Seven are happy. Not only happy,
they’re right for each other. You and B’Elanna were always bickering over
something. If it hadn’t been your holographic…transgression…it would have been
something else."</P>
<P>"Yeah, well…" the comment died on Tom’s lips as realized that he may still
have a chance. If he went to B’Elanna and explained that he wasn’t in control
when he slept with Becca… B’Elanna would be honor bound to forgive him. And if
it hadn’t been for that…they would still be together. He could challenge her
marriage to Seven. </P>
<P>"I don’t like that look in your eyes," Janeway said dangerously. "I don’t
want you having any contact with B’Elanna or Seven until the Doctor says you are
completely back to normal."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," he said happily. He could wait… after all, B’Elanna wasn’t
going anywhere. He glanced over at Janeway, wondering how she could tell with
one look what he was thinking. ‘<I>She must be part Betazoid,</I>’ he finally
decided.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven stood outside the door to her quarters. She had just walked Tach and
Nara to their guest accommodations. Naomi Wildman had assisted her, telling the
visitors all about <I>Voyager’s </I>systems as they had walked to the VIP
quarters. Afterwards, Seven had walked home alone, thinking about the pheromonal
interface. Tom Paris wasn’t responsible for his actions, at least not
completely. The Doctor compared his condition to being under the influence of a
strong mind altering drug that brought out all of his more animalistic actions.
She wondered what B’Elanna would say. Would she forgive him? Would she be forced
to reconsider breaking up with him? She knew B’Elanna loved her completely but
she wondered if her wife would feel bound by honor to reconcile with Paris. She
took a deep breath and then went to face her fate.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was leaning across the kitchenette counter trying to reach a candle
from behind a stack of data padds. She stood and turned, smiling at her wife.
"Welcome home, my darling."</P>
<P>Seven stared, her jaw dropping. No matter how may times she saw B’Elanna,
each time she was amazed by her beauty. B’Elanna was wearing a floor length,
blood red nightgown. It had thin straps that tended to slip off of her shoulders
and it clung to the sensual curves of her nubile form, making Seven forget what
she had been thinking about.</P>
<P>"Cat got your tongue?" B’Elanna asked as she moved closer. She had the lights
down low to make it easier for Ty to sleep and to add to the mood. Ty was in his
sleeper, content, and not going to wake anytime soon. </P>
<P>"You… are…" Seven blushed and looked down at the carpeting. "I do not have
words to describe your beauty."</P>
<P>"Why don’t you come to bed and show me?" B’Elanna suggested. She let her hand
trail across Seven’s neck, lingering on her spine and then moving down her arm
and taking Seven by the hand. "Come with me, Be’nal."</P>
<P>Seven followed, still looking at the carpet. They reached the bed and
B’Elanna lifted Seven’s chin and leaned in to kiss her. Her Klingon nostrils
flared as she took in the scent of fresh blood. </P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven asked as she leaned down to capture her wife’s full
lips.</P>
<P>"Where were you?" B’Elanna asked. She rubbed both of Seven’s arms as she
looked at the exdrone’s face for any sign of injury.</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and sighed deeply.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes moved down to Seven’s blouse and she noticed a discolored
area. She recognized it as a bloodstain that had been washed out. "What
happened? Are you all right?" She touched Seven’s face, inspecting her more
intensely.</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven said. She opened her eyes and smiled weakly. "I went to
‘make things right’ with Ensign Paris. It did not go well."</P>
<P>"Did he hurt you?" B’Elanna’s eyes widened. "Pa’Tach! I’ll kill him."</P>
<P>"No, love," Seven said as she held B’Elanna close to her. She could feel the
Klingon’s pulse increasing under her fingers so she slowly caressed her exposed
skin to soothe her. "I am fine. He is not…responsible for what happened."</P>
<P>B’Elanna studied Seven’s expression. Her wife was deeply upset, the stress
lines around her eyes proving that she was frightened as well. "Seven, did you…
did you hurt him? Is that his blood?" She pointed to the watermark on Seven’s
blouse, intentionally not asking if her wife had killed him. She knew Seven had
a temper, but she would never kill a fellow crewmember.</P>
<P>"I cannot fool you. Your Klingon sense of smell is fine-tuned for blood,"
Seven stalled.</P>
<P>"Tell me," B’Elanna pleaded. She was getting worried.</P>
<P>"The holodeck program…Fairhaven… when Ensign Paris created it, he added
synthetic pheromones to the matrix," Seven explained. She wanted to make sure
that her wife knew Paris hadn’t been in control before she mentioned being
hit.</P>
<P>"What an ass," B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "Won’t he ever grow
up?"</P>
<P>"An ass indeed," Seven said. "The pheromones have been making him act
irrationally, possessive, and… aggressive."</P>
<P>"Does the Doctor know?" B’Elanna asked. She was concerned, Tom was an
immature idiot, but she didn’t want him to see him ill.</P>
<P>"Yes, he is treating the imbalance as we speak." Seven eased past B’Elanna
and took her own Nightgown off of the bed. B’Elanna had carefully arranged a
sapphire blue gown on the bed for the exdrone. "As well as…other injuries."</P>
<P>"Seven, you’re scaring me. Please tell me what happened." B’Elanna gently
massaged Seven’s shoulders and kissed her neck. She moved the thick blonde braid
aside and let her lips linger beneath Seven’s ear. </P>
<P>"I injured him," Seven whispered. "I did not know he was under the pheromonal
effects."</P>
<P>"What happened?" B’Elanna gently prompted as she turned Seven around.</P>
<P>"He… had a hologram… of you, and then he… he struck me." Seven bit her
lip.</P>
<P>"I don’t care what his excuse is…I’m going to tear his heart out," B’Elanna
said. Her eyes flashed and her body straightened and every muscle twitched with
rage. "Where did he hit you? Are you sure you’re okay?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded. "He split my lip…but my retaliation was…extreme."</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt her heart skip a beat. The thought of Seven being injured made
her stomach clench. </P>
<P>"Oh, Be’nal," she whispered as she touched Seven’s lip with her fingers. Her
touch was impossibly gentle, testing the sensual flesh for any injury. She
leaned forward and kissed her wife’s lips. "Tell me," she whispered. She could
feel the tension in Seven’s body without even touching her. When she connected
with her lips, she knew that Seven was struggling to hold herself together. "I’m
here," B’Elanna promised as she gathered her wife into her arms.</P>
<P>"I broke his hand," Seven whispered. "Lana, I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to
hurt him so much." She took in a shaking breath. "I wanted to make him pay for
the hologram, for trying to break us up, and most of all … for hurting you."</P>
<P>"I’m guessing this hologram was not just playing Kadis-Kot with him?"
B’Elanna kissed Seven’s temple.</P>
<P>"Not any variation of Kadis-kot that I have seen." Seven laughed.</P>
<P>"I would have broken more than his hand," B’Elanna admitted. She ran her hand
down Seven’s back, caressing the tense muscles she found. "I can’t believe he
did that. I want to see the Doctor’s proof that he wasn’t responsible for these
things… otherwise he has an appointment with my bat’tleth."</P>
<P>"I already spoke with the Doctor… while he healed my lip." Seven eased back
so that she could look into B’Elanna’s eyes. "It was not his fault. I injured a
man who was innocent."</P>
<P>"Not innocent," B’Elanna corrected. "He did all those things. And no matter
what the Doctor says…I will not forgive him for hitting you."</P>
<P>"You must. Honor demands it." Seven’s lip trembled.</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" B’Elanna asked. She was more concerned with the
brokenhearted look on her wife’s face than the question of honor.</P>
<P>"He was not in his right mind. You must forgive him…just as you must forgive
him for…sleeping with the hologram before we left," Seven said. She was amazed
that she had been able to say the words without her heart stopping inside her
chest. "And if you forgive that… there would be no reason to break up with him."
Seven turned away, unable to look at her wife’s face.</P>
<P>"Come back here," B’Elanna whispered. She turned Seven back to her and
pressed their foreheads together. "First of all, I would gladly give up my honor
before I would give up what we have." B’Elanna pulled back and lightly stroked
Seven’s cheek with the back of her fingers. "Second, Klingon honor wouldn’t have
me leave my Be’nal…the love of my life, to go back to a bumbling idiot. If I
were still single, I would have the option of taking him back, but only if I
still wanted him. The Klingons don’t have much respect for people who can’t
control their own actions," B’Elanna explained. She leaned forward and rubbed
her nose across Seven’s. "So you can’t quit worrying, I can see it was bothering
you."</P>
<P>Seven smiled shyly. "You know me so well, my wife," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>"Was anyone else effected?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Just the captain, but she is being treated," Seven said. "Which explains why
she ‘fell in love’ with a hologram."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said. She suddenly felt her own irrational fears raise their
heads. "So…she didn’t really want to…"</P>
<P>"Shhh…" Seven took B’Elanna’s face in both hands and locked eyes with her.
Lapis blue met sable brown, both sets of eyes overflowing with devotion. "I am
with the woman I love. No one could ever make we want to stray." Seven leaned
over and kissed each of her wife’s cheeks and then she gave her a chaste kiss on
the lips. "You are more than I could ever need, all that I have dreamed of, and
I will spend my life trying to be worthy."</P>
<P>"You complete me," B’Elanna said as her hand came up play with Seven’s thick
braid. "I didn’t know I could love anyone as deeply as I love you. I am
yours."</P>
<P>"Ironic," Seven said with a smile. "I told Mister Paris that I did not own
you, that you belonged only to yourself."</P>
<P>"Well, you were wrong," B’Elanna said with a mock growl. She leaned forward
and caught Seven’s lip gently between her teeth and quickly flicked her tongue
over the captured lip before letting go. "You own me body and soul. I was always
afraid to give myself over to anyone before, but with you… I don’t feel lessened
by it. I like knowing that I belong to you and you to me. I feel like we’re
still individuals, but together we are so much stronger."</P>
<P>"So we are a collective?" Seven whispered as she covered B’Elanna’s mouth
with her own. They kissed slowly, reverently as if the earlier tension needed to
be carefully washed away. B’Elanna was the first to escalate the kiss, letting
her tongue ease out and request entry to Seven’s mouth. Her tongue lathed across
Seven’s lips and teeth seeking entrance. The exdrone’s mouth opened granting
access and both women moaned as their tongues met.</P>
<P>After a few minutes of exploration, B’Elanna puled back, steadying herself
against Seven’s chest. "I like this collective," she said with a leer. "But I
think I need more…input… to be certain."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven smiled and pulled B’Elanna back to her. "Then I shall do my
best to give you that input," Seven responded with a leer of her own. "I do not
want your research to be incomplete."</P>
<P>"What about Ty?" B’Elanna asked as she began unbuttoning Seven’s blouse. </P>
<P>"Let him do his own research," Seven said impatiently. She reached up and
tugged her blouse over her head, sending one of the buttons flying off across
the room.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "No, love…I mean he’s in the next room," she said as she
ran her hands over Seven’s bra. She was loved the way Seven’s nipples jumped to
attention when she touched them. Even through the fabric of her bra, the pink
skin puckered instantly.</P>
<P>"Uuh," Seven moaned and tossed her head back, pressing her chest into
B’Elanna’s hands. "We made love many times with him in the next room at the
cabin," Seven said as she slowly lifted her head back up. Her eyes had darkened
to the color of the sky on Jusari Prime just before dawn, when the sky was black
shading to blue as the light broke over the horizon. "You will just have to…be
quiet."</P>
<P>"Quiet?" B’Elanna asked incredulously as she dove forward and nipped Seven’s
throat. "I’m out of practice being quiet." She kissed along Seven’s neck, up to
her ear and began nibbling the tender lobe she found there.</P>
<P>Seven whimpered as she felt B’Elanna’s tongue circling her earlobe. It was
the exact motion Lana used on a much lower part of Seven’s anatomy. She let her
hands move down to the silk of B’Elanna’s nightgown, loving the contrast of the
cool fabric over B’Elanna’s heated flesh. Klingons had a higher temperature than
humans, something that Seven had found many enjoyable uses for. She loved the
way B’Elanna felt pressed against her in the night, the way a single touch would
fill her with heat, and especially how B’Elanna’s mouth felt when pressed to her
most intimate flesh.</P>
<P>"Close the door," Seven said with growl. "I want your mouth elsewhere."</P>
<P>"Yes, my love," B’Elanna said with a giggle. She trotted to the door, pausing
to take a peak across the living room to where Ty was sound asleep, then closed
the door. "Now what?" B’Elanna asked innocently as she turned back around. "Oh,
sweet Kahless," B’Elanna said when she saw her wife. She had to lean against the
wall, having gone literary weak in the knees.</P>
<P>Seven had managed to rip off her clothes and put on the deep blue nightgown
in the few seconds it had taken B’Elanna to check on Ty. She was stretched
across the fur blanket on her back, with her hands linked behind her head and
had a decidedly devious smirk on her lips. </P>
<P>"You think I resemble an overweight Klingon in need of a tooth sharpening?"
Seven asked as she sat up and arched her back. </P>
<P>B’Elanna shook her head as she watched Seven lick her lips, wetting every
centimeter of the tender skin. </P>
<P>"Let me make love to you, Be’nal," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna could only nod as she sprinted to the bed.</P>

<P>Seven wasn’t sure what had awakened her from a sound sleep, but she rolled
over and opened her eyes anyway. She glanced around the room, noticing the
candles on the nightstand and knew that she must have slept for a few hours. The
last thing she remembered after making love with B’Elanna was drifting off to
sleep while watching those same candles. They had now burned almost complete
away. Seven shifted her weight and rolled onto her back, smiling when B’Elanna
whined and tightened her grip around the blonde’s waist.</P>
<P>An unfamiliar sensation made Seven pause and put her hand on her belly, then
she grabbed B’Elanna’s arm and gently squeezed it.</P>
<P>"Lana, wake up," Seven said. She turned her head and looked at her wife.
B’Elanna’s eyes fluttered but didn’t open. "B’Elanna, wake up," Seven said a
little louder.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked as her eyes shot open. "What’s wrong?" She sat up and
stared down at Seven. "Are you okay? What’s wrong?" Her hair was tussled from
hours of lovemaking and her eyes were blurred, but she focused on Seven.</P>
<P>"Nothing is wrong," Seven said as she grabbed B’Elanna’s hand and moved it to
her stomach.</P>
<P>"Then why did you wake me up?" B’Elanna asked as she tried to slow her racing
heart. She wasn’t completely awake yet, and began settling down beside Seven.
"What was that?" B’Elanna asked as she pressed her hand closer to Seven’s
belly.</P>
<P>"That is why I woke you," Seven answered. She moved B’Elanna’s hand a few
inches to the left and pressed it against her skin. "There," Seven said with a
grin.</P>
<P>"She’s kicking," B’Elanna said. Her eyes widened and she shifted onto her
side and repositioned her hand. "Oh, my god, she’s kicking in there."</P>
<P>"Yes, she is." Seven nodded and laced her fingers over B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was overwhelmed and looked into Seven’s eyes. "That’s our daughter,"
she said quietly. "Thank you, for waking me," she added before she leaned over
and quickly kissed Seven. "Do you think she’s knows we’re here?" B’Elanna looked
back down toward Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"I doubt she has the cognitive ability at this point…" Seven began, then
smiled brightly. "But… I feel… yes, she does."</P>
<P>"I think so, too." B’Elanna laughed and crawled under the blankets and began
placing fleeting kisses on Seven’s stomach. Seven was wearing her blue
nightgown, having put it on in case she needed to get up during the night to
take care of Ty. B’Elanna’s kisses tickled Seven’s belly beneath the satiny
fabric. "Hey, little one, what are you doing up so late?" B’Elanna asked the
baby…or rather, Seven’s belly. "Don’t you know it’s the middle of the night,
wa’machwI,’?" she asked, calling the child <I>little one</I> in Klingon.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," Seven said indulgently, "she cannot see anything from her present
location. How could she know what time it is?"</P>
<P>"Oh, hush," B’Elanna said with a laugh and then growled at Seven. She gasped
when the baby kicked again.</P>
<P>"Apparently, she likes hearing her mother growl," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>B’Elanna raised an eyebrow and then began growling again. She put her mouth
directly onto Seven’s belly and continued growling. Seven squirmed.</P>
<P>"Hold still," B’Elanna ordered playfully and then growled onto Seven’s belly
again.</P>
<P>"It tickles," Seven said as she tried to pull B’Elanna’s face away from
her.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna said with mock harshness. "I’m bonding with my daughter." She
grabbed the blankets and covered her head and went back to her growling. "There
see? She likes it," B’Elanna said from under the blankets when the baby kicked
again. She began tickling Seven’s ribs. "Or maybe she likes to feel you
squirm."</P>
<P>"Stop," Seven said, but she was giggling, taking away the effect of her
complaint. </P>
<P>B’Elanna’s growls became louder from underneath the blankets. </P>
<P>Seven heard a muted hiss and turned in time to see Ty crawling into the room.
She gripped B’Elanna, trying to drag her out from under the covers.</P>
<P>"Bear?" Ty asked as he used the side of the bed to pull himself up. "Ba get
bad bear?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s head poked out from under the blankets. "Ty?" </P>
<P>"How did he know how to open the door?" Seven asked accusingly.</P>
<P>"Umm well… we were playing hide and seek earlier…and I may have showed him
how to open the door," B’Elanna said sheepishly.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said as she lifted Ty onto the bed. She smiled as he snuggled
down between his two aunts. "And if he had happened to have come in several
hours ago?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Well…he didn’t," B’Elanna pointed out.</P>
<P>"My Ba," Ty said as he tugged at B’Elanna’s arm. He wanted her up on the
pillow where she belonged. She moved up, wrapping her arm over Ty and resting
her palm on Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"My Ba," Seven whispered as she stretched out and kissed B’Elanna’s forehead.
</P>
<P>"Evan, ing… peaz," Ty asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said. "<I>Evan</I>… sing…please."</P>
<P>Seven rolled her eyes and looked over at her wife. "What would you like me to
sing?"</P>
<P>"Cowboy zong," Ty answered as he sat up.</P>
<P>B’Elanna groaned and covered her head with the pillow. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway entered the mess hall, pausing to smile and wave hello to the
crewmembers having breakfast. She saw Nara and Tach sitting with Neelix and
headed over to them.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Nara said as the captain neared the table. "How are you
feeling?"</P>
<P>"Much better, thank you," Janeway responded. "Mind if I join you?"</P>
<P>"Please," Tach said with a smile.</P>
<P>"Oh, yes, Captain," Neelix chimed in and then stood. "Let me get you some
coffee."</P>
<P>"You’re a lifesaver, Mister Neelix," Janeway said as she settled onto the low
bench.</P>
<P>"I’m glad you joined us," Nara said as soon as Neelix disappeared. "There is
something we need to ask you."</P>
<P>"Of course," Janeway said. "What can I do for you?"</P>
<P>Nara looked to Tach. He nodded and cleared his throat.</P>
<P>"We would like to ask B’Elanna and Seven something, but we thought we should
ask you first," he explained.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Janeway asked. She had the distinct feeling she wasn’t going to
like the question.</P>
<P>"Well, you know we care very much for them both," Nara said as she leaned
forward. "And Ty adores them."</P>
<P>"Yes…" Janeway nodded.</P>
<P>"Well," Nara continued. "Tach’s brother had a settlement next to ours, but he
wasn’t…cut out for farming. He gave it to us. We would like to offer it to
B’Elanna and Seven."</P>
<P>"I see," Janeway responded carefully. "That decision is up to them," she
added, though she hoped they would choose to stay. Not only were both women
valuable members of the crew, they were also close friends.</P>
<P>"Well, we thought we should clear it with you first," Tach said.</P>
<P>"I appreciate that," Janeway said. "But I would never keep them from
something they want. I will, however, say that I hope they stay on board. I’d
hate to lose them."</P>
<P>"Mama," Ty yelled as B’Elanna carried him into the mess hall.</P>
<P>Nara looked up and smiled. "Come here, you," she said as she held up her
arms. B’Elanna moved toward her. A few moments later Seven came into the room
holding Naomi Wildman’s hand.</P>
<P>"Good morning," B’Elanna handed Ty to his mother.</P>
<P>"How did you sleep?" Tach asked his son.</P>
<P>"Ba and Evan played bear," Ty volunteered.</P>
<P>"Played bear?" Naomi asked as she sat next to Nara.</P>
<P>"How are you, Naomi?" Nara pulled Naomi closer.</P>
<P>"Ba got Evan," Ty said. He reached out grabbed a nearby fork and Nara
struggled to take it away from him.</P>
<P>"Yes, my son," Nara said with a wicked grin. "Ba tends to do that."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna was feeling the baby move," Seven clarified. Her face was as red as
Janeway had ever seen it. </P>
<P>"She kicked for the first time last night," B’Elanna added as she sat next to
her wife and rested a hand on Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"You shouldn’t kick your wife," Tach told Seven, his eyes sparkling
mischievously.</P>
<P>"The baby kicked," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Of course it did," Nara said.</P>
<P>"Of course," Janeway added.</P>
<P>"Uh huh," Tach said.</P>
<P>"She was playing with the baby," Seven insisted.</P>
<P>"Of course she was," Nara said.</P>
<P>Seven was beginning to whither under the embarrassing scrutiny when the baby
kicked as if on cue. She smiled and looked at B’Elanna who had also felt it.</P>
<P>"I think that’s even harder than it was last night," B’Elanna said as she
looked down at Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said. "I believe she gets her temperament from you," she told
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna whined, but smiled.</P>
<P>"Can I feel?" Naomi asked.</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said. "Come over here next to me." She guided Naomi’s hand
to her belly and pressed her tiny fingers against her stomach.</P>
<P>"I don’t feel anything," Naomi said.</P>
<P>"Just wait a second, Squirt," B’Elanna said. She edged Naomi’s hand toward
her.</P>
<P>"Wow," Naomi said when she felt the flutter under her fingers.</P>
<P>Neelix returned with the captain’s coffee and saw the commotion. He handed
Janeway her mug and knelt next to Naomi. "May I?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded and leaned back to give the furry chef access to her belly. From
there, a small crowd gathered, eager to feel the tiny kicks. Janeway stayed
seated, not wanting to interfere, and also not quite ready to be that involved
with the reality of the pregnancy. It was one thing to be happy for the couple,
but it was something else all together to rest her hand on the belly of the
woman she still had some unresolved feelings for.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Later that afternoon, B’Elanna insisted that Seven go for a check up with the
Doctor. She wasn’t taking any chances with her wife or daughter’s health. She
wanted Seven to have daily check ups until the Doctor assured her that Seven was
out of danger.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I do not wish to see…him," Seven said coldly. She paused in the corridor,
trying to convince B’Elanna to let her visit with Nara and Tach instead of
seeing the hologram who had tried to terminate her pregnancy.</P>
<P>"I know, love," B’Elanna said as she took Seven’s hand. "I’m not too thrilled
with him either, but what choice do we have? You need medical attention. I’ll be
with you the whole time."</P>
<P>"All right." Seven nodded and gripped her wife’s hand as they neared the door
to sickbay.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Doctor turned when the doors to sickbay opened. "Seven, are you ill?" he
asked.</P>
<P>"No," she said coldly.</P>
<P>"I thought she should have a check up, just to make sure she’s still okay,"
B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>"I take it you are not thrilled with the idea?" he asked Seven.</P>
<P>"Thrilled is the last thing I am," the exdrone stated. "But I have no other
option."</P>
<P>"Actually," he said quietly. "Thanks to Mister Kim and I, you do have another
option."</P>
<P>"Explain," Seven said. She pulled B’Elanna closer to her side.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Less than a half-hour later, Seven and B’Elanna were in the holodeck staring
at Doctor Opaca.</P>
<P>"Seven, it’s wonderful to meet you," Opaca said. "And you B’Elanna, I’ve
heard a great deal about you." She motioned for Seven to move onto the biobed.
Harry had programmed a medical bay into the holodeck because he didn’t think
Seven wanted to be anywhere near the Doctor for the time being. "Are you having
any pain?" Opaca asked as Seven sat on the examination bed.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She glanced over at B’Elanna and smirked almost
imperceptibly. "My wife wanted to be certain that I did not have a relapse."</P>
<P>"Not likely, given the nature of your problem," Opaca said. She looked over
at B’Elanna and smiled. Her nose ridges crinkled and her eyes sparkled warmly.
"But it is perfectly normal for a first time mother to be nervous."</P>
<P>"Excuse me," Seven said as she tilted her head to one side. "But how do I
know that you will not make the same decisions as the Doctor?"</P>
<P>Opaca nodded and stepped back. "Because, my matrix is based on a Bajorian
physician. They value the patient’s beliefs and wishes above all else. I am also
versed in Starfleet medical ethics, which prohibit me from taking any action you
forbid, additionally, Mister Kim added a subroutine that will not allow me to
ignore either of those qualifying factors."</P>
<P>"What do you think about that, Doctor?" B’Elanna asked. She stood next to
Seven, her hand resting on the former Borg’s knee.</P>
<P>"I don’t think it is necessary, but it doesn’t bother me," Opaca said. "I
find the Doctor’s actions reprehensible. You should never have been put in the
situation to fight your doctor for the life of your child."</P>
<P>"Pleasant words," Seven said carefully. "But I will reserve judgment until I
get to know you better."</P>
<P>"A wise choice," Opaca said with a smile. "I suggest that you examine the
matrix parameters. It might help you feel more secure."</P>
<P>"I intend to," Seven responded.</P>
<P>"Now, let’s have a look at you," Opaca said as she began scanning Seven.
"Hmm, very good." She moved her tricorder to Seven’s belly. "Yes, you are
healing very nicely. Any pain from the muscle tears?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "Not since last night."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s hand squeezed Seven’s knee reassuringly.</P>
<P>"Good," Opaca said. "I don’t see any problems. Do you have any questions?"
She put the tricorder down and turned to Seven and waited patiently.</P>
<P>"The baby started kicking last night," B’Elanna volunteered.</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said. "With the temporal variance, the pregnancy has advanced to
the equivalent of the fifth month. She should be moving quite a bit."</P>
<P>"I have a question," Seven said. She looked expectantly at Opaca. "I was not
comfortable speaking with the Doctor about it, but I feel…compelled to find
out."</P>
<P>"Of course, what is it?" Opaca asked. She rested her hand on her chin and
listened intently.</P>
<P>"I was uncertain as to how… enthusiastic I could be when making love with
B’Elanna," Seven explained. "Last night, given my injuries, we limited my
activities to those of performing acts on my wife."</P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna exclaimed.</P>
<P>Opaca laughed a deep and heartfelt sound. "My dear, a healthy sexual life is
imperative to emotional health," she assured B’Elanna. "There’s nothing about
Seven’s condition that should limit her love making."</P>
<P>"But," B’Elanna blushed deeply. "What about…well… you know… the baby is
getting bigger. I don’t want to injure her."</P>
<P>"I assure you, B’Elanna, you won’t poke out your daughter’s eye with normal
penetration," Opaca stated. </P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened and her blush deepened. </P>
<P>"Normal?" Seven asked curiously. "What is considered normal?"</P>
<P>"Oh, geeze," B’Elanna said as she covered her face with her hands.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna spent the next half-hour standing off to the side as Opaca and Seven
had a detailed conversation about every aspect of sex. B’Elanna thought her
skin’s ability to blush was going to wear out. When Opaca told Seven that she
should be careful when using toys, the exdrone was thoroughly confused. Opaca
then asked if they utilized toys, Seven was still stymied, so she turned to her
wife.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, what are these toys?" she asked.</P>
<P>"You know what?" B’Elanna asked as she turned around and faced Seven. "This
is not a conversation I want to be having with Opaca the sex therapist."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Opaca said with a smile, "There is nothing to be embarrassed
about. Many women utilize toys during their lovemaking."</P>
<P>"What kind of toys?" Seven asked. She wondered how any of the toys she had
seen could be used sexually. Certainly Samantha Wildman would not give Naomi
sexual aids to play with.</P>
<P>B’Elanna seemed to read Seven’s mind and she laughed. "Be’nal, not the toys
you are thinking about. We’re talking about artificial…umm… synthetic…no, umm…
<I>things</I> for penetration."</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven said, suddenly understanding. "You mean dildoes? Why did you not
just say so? I have researched various sexual aids, however I did not feel we
needed them."</P>
<P>B’Elanna wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear. Her wife had no modesty.
"Yes, dildoes," she said. "I personally find the idea of using some… fake… piece
of technology to make love… rather impersonal."</P>
<P>"What do you call this?" Seven asked as she held up her left hand to B’Elanna
and wiggled her fingers. </P>
<P>"I…umm." B’Elanna found out that she could blush a few shades deeper.</P>
<P>"I read in your medical files that the entire arm from the elbow down has
been replaced," Opaca said as she moved closer to the exdrone. "What exactly can
your prosthetic hand do?"</P>
<P>"None of your business." B’Elanna stepped in front of the small hologram. The
Klingon suddenly wished the warp core would breech, something, anything to get
her out of her current conversation.</P>
<P>"I’m a doctor...my interest is purely scientific," Opaca assured her.</P>
<P>"Well, go study some spores and leave my wife out of it!" B’Elanna turned and
moved over to Seven. "Can we go home now, please," she asked her wife.</P>
<P>"Were you exposed to the pheromones?" Opaca asked as she began scanning
B’Elanna. Seven smirked, but then covered her mouth to avoid laughing.</P>
<P>"No," Seven explained. "Lana is Klingon. Passion, possessiveness, and
aggressive behavior are all standard for her species… That is why I married
her."</P>
<P>"That’s it," B’Elanna said. "We’re leaving. Now." She took Seven’s hand and
pulled her toward the exit.</P>
<P>"I am familiar with Klingons," Opaca said with a smirk as they moved toward
the exit. "If you have anymore questions, just ask."</P>
<P>"End program," B’Elanna said. She released a long sigh when the black and
yellow grid appeared.</P>
<P>"That was rude," Seven pointed out. "She was still talking."</P>
<P>"I just wish I had thought of it a half hour ago." B’Elanna stopped and
turned to look up at Seven. "I think you enjoyed embarrassing me."</P>
<P>"Why does the topic of sex embarrass you?" Seven asked, genuinely
confused.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stopped and took both of Seven’s hands in hers. "It doesn’t, with
you. Our sex life is our business, and no one else’s. And yes, I get embarrassed
when you talk in such graphic detail with someone."</P>
<P>"But, I did not discuss what we do," Seven said as she tilted her head to the
side. "I only asked hypothetical questions, so that I would know what we can and
cannot do." Seven squeezed B’Elanna’s hands and then brought them up to her lips
and kissed her knuckles. "I want to make love to you, my Lana… but I don’t want
to endanger our child."</P>
<P>"I know," B’Elanna said as she leaned forward and rested her forehead onto
Seven’s chest. She wrapped her arms around Seven and squeezed her gently. "I
just don’t like sharing that aspect of our life with anyone."</P>
<P>"I will gladly refrain from discussing these matters," Seven said quietly,
"If you will promise me that you will ask the relevant questions of our
physician."</P>
<P>"Oh…I." B’Elanna closed her eyes and sighed. "Okay, but don’t you dare give
me a list of… interesting questions to ask that little…doctor," B’Elanna
said.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said as she pulled away and guided B’Elanna toward the
door. "I believe she already answered most of my questions."</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna said quietly as she stopped. "You can always ask me if
you’re curious."</P>
<P>Seven blushed, which confused B’Elanna, given the exdrone’s earlier candor.
"My questions to you generally involve actions I wish to…experience. My
questions to Opaca were as to the safety of our activities."</P>
<P>"Good point," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven. </P>
<P>Seven moaned, and completely forgot about the Bajorian hologram.</P>
