<P>As the door to her ready room closed, Kathryn heard a desperate, guttural
scream coming from inside and recognized it as the Klingon death howl. She
leaned against the wall and rubbed her temples. She stayed there, ignoring the
concerned looks from the rest of the crew as she wondered how she was going to
help her young friend through her loss. She listened and she heard loud crashes,
identifying a few of the sounds. One was definitely her desk being overturned,
another she assumed was her Da Vinci bust hitting the wall. The crashing ended
after a few minutes and she heard strange noises that reminded her of the
shipyards at Utopia Planitia. It sounded like metal being bent and shaped, but
she dismissed that because it simply wasn’t possible, then the crashing
continued.</P>
<P>"Captain," Chakotay said as he came over to her. "How is she?"</P>
<P>A loud ripping noise followed by a thud came from behind the door.</P>
<P>"How do you think she is?" Janeway asked. They both listened until the sounds
died down.</P>
<P>"I spoke with Nara," he said quietly.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"She’s in the new orchard with Ty, looking at the trees Tach planted."
Chakotay nodded toward the silent ready room. "Are you sure you should have left
her alone?"</P>
<P>"She’s a very private person," Kathryn said sadly. "She needed to go
through…that…alone," she added. "She’s letting off some steam, and I don’t think
she’d do that with an audience."</P>
<P>"It doesn’t sound like you’ll have a ready room when this is over." He put
his hand on Kathryn’s shoulder. "Don’t leave her in there too long."</P>
<P>Kathryn nodded. "Her ten minutes are up right now. Why don’t you get back to
my bridge."</P>
<P>"Aye Captain." He squeezed her shoulder. "Good luck."</P>
<P>"I’ll need it." She turned and entered her ready room. "Oh my," she said as
she spun and closed the door and sealed it with her personal privacy code. </P>
<P>She turned back around and saw Seven sitting in the middle of the wreckage of
what had once been Janeway’s private sanctuary. It looked like a tornado had
been through the room…twice. Everything in the room was shattered or ripped to
shreds, most notably was the couch. It was reduced to a fluffy ocean of padding
covering the floor and a few scattered piles of metal that had been its frame.
The desk was broken in half, one piece having been hurled onto the upper deck
and crushed against the wall. The other half of the desk sat at its normal
location, looking like half of it had beamed off of the ship and the remaining
piece had simply fallen over. Kathryn moved closer to the center of the debris,
trying to look at Seven’s face, but all she could see was the former Borg’s back
as she hunched over in the mess.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Kathryn asked gently, but the young blonde didn’t even flinch.
Kathryn moved closer and knelt beside her. She was covered in dust and had
pieces of the couch stuffing stuck in her hair but Kathryn’s eyes focused on her
hands. Seven was cradling Kathryn’s lucky teacup, holding it reverently. Even in
her rage she hadn’t been able to destroy something so precious to the
captain.</P>
<P>"Your cup," Seven whispered as she turned. Her eyes were swollen from crying
and she was pale. "I seem to have damaged your ready room…however…I could not
break your ‘lucky tea cup.’ Please take it."</P>
<P>Kathryn took the cup and held it in one hand while she rested the other hand
on Seven’s shoulder. "I’m so sorry," she whispered. It occurred to her that
Seven was far more fragile than the porcelain cup, and she wished it were the
cup that was shattered and not her dear friend’s heart.</P>
<P>Seven turned and looked at the teacup in Janeway’s hand. "Where was my luck
today?" she asked in a tiny voice that sounded more like a child than the strong
woman Janeway had come to know.</P>
<P>The words hit Kathryn like a fist and she stood and hurled the teacup into
the wall. She paced and rubbed her eyes as she felt tears hot on her cheeks.
Kathryn sighed and then wiped her eyes one last time and went back to Seven and
sat beside her in the debris.</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"There is no reason." Janeway took Seven’s hand and patted her comfortingly.
She had to shift her legs to make a soft spot on top of the scattered mess.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at her belly and then rested her hand on it. "B’Elanna
loved our daughter," she said quietly. "She would look at my belly with such
love and devotion. She would talk to the baby, tell her stories…" Seven looked
at Kathryn, her lower lip trembling. "Our daughter will never see that love,
never see the love Lana had in her eyes."</P>
<P>"Then we’ll tell her," Kathryn said. "Everyday."</P>
<P>"That is…insufficient." Seven closed her eyes tightly and drew in a shaking
breath and then collapsed onto Kathryn. She began taking gulps of air as the
tears fell uncontrolled. Kathryn lowered Seven into her lap and gently stroked
her blonde hair. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven cried for hours, and Kathryn held her, murmuring comforting words that
did more for Kathryn than Seven. The former drone was beyond any words and she
let her pain pour from her eyes in salty streams. Finally, Seven dozed off, her
face still resting on Kathryn’s lap and the older woman stared down at her.
Kathryn had no idea how to help. She wished that there was some way to bring
B’Elanna back, but she knew that miracles were scarce, especially in the Delta
Quadrant. Seven was restless, mumbling in her sleep and shifting her weight
often. Kathryn eased out from under her and walked a few steps away before
tapping her comm badge.</P>
<P>"Janeway to sickbay, I need Opaca in my ready room, now," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor answered. He was insulted and his tone made it evident.
"It’s one thing to create a holographic midwife, but now you want her to use my
emitter? What’s next, is she going on away missions?"</P>
<P>"Send Opaca to my ready room, now," Janeway said again. Her tone made it
clear it wasn’t up for debate.</P>
<P>"Fine," the Doctor responded as the channel went dead.</P>
<P>Opaca materialized, looking somewhat disoriented, but she took one look at
the room and Seven and hurried toward her. </P>
<P>"Shh," Janeway whispered. "She just went to sleep. Could you scan her…make
sure she’s okay?"</P>
<P>"I’ll scan her," Opaca said sadly. "But I doubt she’ll be okay. Not for a
very long time." She moved forward, careful not to awaken Seven, and scanned
her. After a moment she moved away, taking Janeway by the arm and not speaking
until they were well away from Seven. "Physically she’s fine. I would like her
to eat something, and if that’s not possible, maybe you can get her to
regenerate, but I wouldn’t hold my breath on that one."</P>
<P>"Why?" Kathryn whispered.</P>
<P>"I happen to know that B’Elanna always sat with her when she regenerated…ever
since they were on Jusari Prime," Opaca explained. "Seven told me she loves that
time together. She is unconscious, but has an innate sense of B’Elanna’s
presence…watching over her. She told me that it makes her feel completely
cherished. I don’t think she’ll be too eager to regenerate alone."</P>
<P>"I see," Kathryn said quietly. She looked at Opaca, surprised to see her
holographic eyes darkened with grief. Opaca was full of surprises, and Kathryn
found her extremely easy to talk as if they had known each other for years.
"Maybe you can talk to her when she feels up to it. You’re very good with
her."</P>
<P>"I care a great deal for her. She’s grown so much since she was rescued from
the Borg," Opaca said sadly. "I hate seeing her go through this."</P><I>
<P>*"Chakotay to Janeway,"*</I> the commander said.</P>
<P>"Janeway here," Kathryn whispered. She looked over and saw Seven stir and
then settle back onto the hard deck. "What is it, Commander?"</P><I>
<P>*"I just spoke with the Stellar Guard, and…well…I think you’d better look at
what they told us. I routed the information to your console, but it won’t go
through."*</P></I>
<P>Kathryn looked at the wall where the information feed for her desk console
used to be. The conduit had been ripped from the wall. She vaguely remembered
seeing part of it on the upper deck under the window.</P>
<P>"Bring me the information on a data padd," Kathryn said quietly. "And bring
it yourself, Commander. No one else is to enter my ready room."</P><I>
<P>*"Understood, Chakotay out."*</P></I>
<P>"What now?" Kathryn shook her head. She looked over at Seven; she was
mumbling louder and Kathryn went to her, carefully gathering her up onto her
lap. Seven gripped her legs and whimpered.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered in her sleep. Her voice was so full of love that
Kathryn thought her own heart would break.</P>
<P>The door chimed and Kathryn ordered the computer to release the lock.
Chakotay took one look at the destruction and stopped, stunned by the amount of
damage Seven had done in the ten minutes Janeway had left her alone. He
carefully walked over to Kathryn and gave her the data padd, trying not to look
at Seven resting in the captain’s lap.</P>
<P>"Check this out immediately." Janeway nodded at the padd. "But keep it under
wraps. There’s no reason to get anyone’s hopes up."</P>
<P>"I’m already on it," he said as he made his way out of the debris field.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Opaca asked.</P>
<P>"Maybe a miracle." Kathryn reread the padd. It was a detailed report from the
Stellar Guard. </P>
<P>"Then may the prophets guide you," Opaca said as she tilted her head to one
side.</P>
<P>The data padd explained what Chakotay had discovered when he spoke with the
Narians. Chakotay had explained that the station had been lost and the Narians
had asked if the team had beamed onto <I>Voyager</I> or used standard escape
protocol. Chakotay asked what they meant, and they explained. It was normal for
Narians to be in dangerous meteor storms and they had developed strategies just
for them. Since their system of targeting meteors was similar to the one Seven
had designed, they knew which meteors would miss the planet completely. Those
meteors were not shot down until the Stellar Guard had extra time. Because of
that, the larger meteors that were not a threat became emergency beam out
sights. In the event of a meteor strike, a crew could beam onto the meteor and
wait for rescue. <I>Voyager</I> had not scanned any of the meteors that had
continued past the destroyed station. Kathryn hoped that Tach was well versed in
the method described on the padd. <I>Voyager</I> had been too far away for a
beam out, but there had been dozens of meteors close enough for Tach’s
transporter to reach.</P>
<P>"What miracle are you talking about?" Seven asked as she sat up. She grabbed
the data padd and scanned it.</P>
<P>"I thought you were asleep," Kathryn said with a half smile.</P>
<P>"I was…but I awakened when the commander left you this," Seven accused as she
waved the padd at the captain. "Why was I not informed immediately? We must
begin a search at once."</P>
<P>"Seven, this a long shot. The station was depressurized, and they didn’t have
time to reach the transporters." Kathryn tried to take the padd, but Seven
pulled it to her chest like a life preserver.</P>
<P>"She is alive," Seven yelled angrily as she stood up. "I should not have
given up on her so quickly. It is my humanity that makes me so…weak as to accept
her death."</P>
<P>"You’re wrong." Kathryn stood and tried to take Seven by the arm but she
pulled away and gave the captain an icy glare. "Seven, it’s your humanity that’s
making you instantly believe this right now. It’s called hope…and since it’s new
to you…I don’t want to see you hurt by it."</P>
<P>"How could I be hurt by knowing my wife is alive?" Seven picked up a piece of
the broken teacup and cradled it in her Borg enhanced left hand. Her right hand
still clutched the data padd. </P>
<P>"Seven, all I’m saying is that you shouldn’t assume we’re going to find
them." Kathryn edged closer. She could see Seven’s hands trembling. "I want them
to be all right. God, I want it more than anything," Kathryn said. She had loved
Seven deeply and wanted a life with her, but she knew the former Borg belonged
with B’Elanna. "Seven, I’m just saying let’s go into this hopefully, but not
blindly."</P>
<P>"She is alive," Seven whispered. She held out the shard of broken porcelain
to Kathryn. "This is me without my Be’nal. Broken, unable to do that which I was
designed for… and like this, I could be mended…but the fractures would always be
there. Without B’Elanna, my life is incomplete."</P>
<P>"I know it feels that way, but you are a strong and independent woman. You
don’t need anyone to be complete," Kathryn said as she bent down to look into
Seven’s downcast eyes.</P>
<P>"You are wrong," Seven said. Her voice was bleak and desperate. "B’Elanna
holds my heart. I gave it to her, and while I will go on and function for our
daughter’s sake… I will never be whole again until I meet my Be’nal in Stovocor.
I cannot get back my heart, she carries it with her wherever she goes."</P>
<P>Kathryn smiled sadly. "When did you become such a poet, my friend?"</P>
<P>"The day B’Elanna and I fell in love."</P>
<P>"I’m worried about you." Kathryn rested her hand on Seven’s shoulder.
"Please, don’t let yourself believe this…only to be shattered if it isn’t
true."</P>
<P>"I know she is alive, Kathryn. I just didn’t listen to what my soul was
telling me." Seven turned and smiled at Kathryn. "She is alive."</P>
<P>Opaca came over to them and paused before reaching out and touching Seven on
the elbow. "Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven looked down at the short hologram.</P>
<P>"How do you know she is alive?" Opaca asked.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and she clutched the broken porcelain to her chest. "Because my
heart still beats. If Lana were … gone… it would not."</P>
<P>Kathryn sighed. "Well, I can’t argue with that logic. Will you wait in here
while I check with Chakotay?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"I have the right to help look for my wife," Seven said. "Besides, I am the
only one who believes she is alive, so I will look more diligently."</P>
<P>"All right," Kathryn said. "Let’s go."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Janeway entered the bridge with Seven at her side. Opaca had beamed back to
sickbay. The Captain took over the bridge and sat in her chair and Seven went
immediately to the auxiliary science station and began trying to find the
meteors that had been closest to the station when it exploded. She was surprised
to see that Harry Kim had already marked four possible targets. </P>
<P>"Coming up the third target," Ensign Kim said.</P>
<P>"Third?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"We already checked two of them," Chakotay said.</P>
<P>"Good thinking," Janeway said quietly. "How much air do they have?" She was
considering them alive until they had proof, something she realized she should
have done earlier. It just seemed so impossible that they could have survived
the impact.</P>
<P>"Narian emergency suits are designed for longer periods of exposure," Tuvok
said. "They employ concentrated liquid oxygen canisters. They should have almost
twelve hours left."</P>
<P>"That’s fine if you don’t mind having a bomb strapped to your back," Paris
said from the helm. "Guess they didn’t have a spaceshuttle <I>Challenger</I> in
their history."</P>
<P>"That’s enough, Ensign," Janeway said. She didn’t like him making jokes about
B’Elanna or the group of space travelers Earth had lost early in its
history.</P>
<P>"This meteor has no life signs," Seven said. "We should move on to the forth
target."</P>
<P>"Narian ship approaching, Captain," Harry said.</P>
<P>"On screen." Janeway stood as she looked at a Narian captain with reddish
hair and big brown eyes. His browridge was thick and his eyebrows met in the
middle. He looked like the Irish Setter Kathryn had left back in the Alpha
Quadrant. </P>
<P>"<I>Voyager</I>," he said as he leaned forward in his chair. "I am Captain
Jakdar. We have been searching the meteors for your missing crew."</P>
<P>"Yes?" Janeway sent out a prayer to the universe.</P>
<P>"Target 16," he said as rubbed his chin. "We recovered two bodies, one
Narian…one Klingon as you described. We will beam them over immediately."</P>
<P>Kathryn sat and gripped the arms of her chair. </P>
<P>"Captain!" Harry Kim yelled.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes rolled back into her head and she hit the deck plating in a
crumpled pile. Janeway felt her own heart ache at the thought of Seven going
through the agony again. Tuvok and Harry reached Seven and checked her for
injuries.</P>
<P>"Thank you, for your assistance," Janeway said grimly as she turned back to
the screen. "We’ll send you the coordinates to our morgue."</P>
<P>"Morgue?" Jakdar asked. "Why? They are in our transporter room ready to come
home."</P>
<P>"You said bodies…" Janeway said slowly. </P>
<P>"Yes, two healthy bodies. And the female is rather… insistent. She has quite
a temper." He smiled at Janeway wondering why she seemed upset.</P>
<P>"They’re alive?" Tom asked happily.</P>
<P>"Of course," Jakdar said.</P>
<P>"In our language, we refer to people as…bodies…only when they are deceased,"
Kathryn said as she looked back at Seven. The willowy former drone was still out
cold.</P>
<P>"My apologies," Jakdar said. His browridge blushed deep crimson. "Our
deceased are called shells."</P>
<P>"Please beam them directly to the bridge," Janeway said. "Drop the
shields."</P>
<P>There was a brief delay and then Tach and B’Elanna appeared on the bridge in
front of the helm and looked around. They had their helmets tucked under their
arms and were covered in sweat and grime, but both had weary smiles on their
faces.</P>
<P>"Oh, sweet Kahless, am I glad to see you," B’Elanna said with a sigh.</P>
<P>"So am I." Tach tossed his helmet onto the floor, not caring where it rolled.
"Nana B’Elanna is driving me crazy."</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said from the tactical station where he was kneeling next to
Seven. "Perhaps Lieutenant Torres could assist me?" Harry was beside him, the
men blocking Seven from view.</P>
<P>"I just got back," B’Elanna whined. "Honestly, I just need a hot shower and a
chance to see my wife. Is that too much to ask?"</P>
<P>Harry stood and stepped out of the way as Seven tried to sit up. Her
expression was dazed and her eyelids fluttered.</P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna dropped her helmet and sprinted to her wife. She pushed
Tuvok out of the way and held the bewildered blonde in her arms. "What
happened?"</P>
<P>"Be’nal?" Seven’s eyes shot open. "You are alive." She yanked B’Elanna to her
and they fell onto the floor in a heap. "The Narians said you were dead." Seven
rolled over, pinning B’Elanna to the deck in a very intimate position. "They
said they had your bodies." Seven gently touched B’Elanna’s cheek, making sure
she was real.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Tach said, drawing the word out. "They had our bodies…and here we
are."</P>
<P>Tuvok cleared his throat. </P>
<P>Seven looked up and glared at him and then she turned back to B’Elanna and
kissed her without restraint.</P>
<P>The Vulcan cleared his throat again, wishing he had a firehose.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna said when Seven let her come up for air. </P>
<P>"You are in serious trouble," Seven said as she stood. She pulled B’Elanna up
to her and wrapped her arms around her. "You are forbidden from repairing any
stations during meteor storms."</P>
<P>"Ladies?" Janeway crossed her arms over her chest. "Why don’t you take this
off of my bridge?"</P>
<P>"Oh, ma’am," B’Elanna said as her face turned deep red. "Yes, ma’am."</P>
<P>"Tach," Chakotay said. "I think you’d better let Nara know that you’re all
right. You were both reported dead."</P>
<P>"Great goddess, where is she?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"In the orchard," Chakotay said. "With Ty."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, Seven, why don’t you go with him," Janeway said.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." B’Elanna moved toward the door and tugged Seven with her.
B’Elanna could still feel the blush burning her cheeks as she climbed into the
turbolift.</P>
<P>They rode in silence, and Seven held B’Elanna in her arms, squeezing so
tightly that the Klingon actually squeaked once. She looked up at Seven, who
loosened her grip and then kissed B’Elanna’s temple. The turbolift stopped and
Tach hurried out, but Seven wasn’t willing to let go of her wife. </P>
<P>"Are you all right, Lana? Were you injured?" Seven ran her hands over the
fabric of the exposure suit.</P>
<P>"I’m fine." B’Elanna pulled Seven out of the lift. "A few bumps and bruises,
maybe a little frostbite," she joked. "You have no idea how cold that meteor
was."</P>
<P>"Where?" Seven grabbed B’Elanna’s exposure suit by the metal ring that was
used to anchor the helmet into place. She snapped it in half and then shredded
the suit down the front and tossed the pieces onto the floor.</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna was suddenly feeling a chill as her sweat covered arms were
exposed to the cool air. She had been wearing only her uniform pants and a tank
top under the exposure suit, and while it had been cold on the meteor, the suit
was extremely hot on board the ship. Now she was covered in sweat and
<I>Voyager’s</I> climate controlled air felt cold against her arms.</P>
<P>"Where are you injured?" Seven demanded as she grabbed B’Elanna’s tank top,
about to give it the same fate as the exposure suit.</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said as she held Seven’s wrists. "Hey, take it easy,
love."</P>
<P>"I thought you were dead," Seven said in a whisper. She eased out of
B’Elanna’s grip and moved her hands up to cup B’Elanna’s face. "You are my life…
and I knew that I had to continue on for our daughter. It hurt so badly. How
could I have taught our child to love life when all I wanted to do was join
you?"</P>
<P>"I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere." B’Elanna put her hands over Seven’s,
holding them to her skin. "I will be here with you, for you… and we will raise
our daughter to treasure every moment…just like we do."</P>
<P>Seven pulled B’Elanna to her chest and clung to her. "I do treasure our
life," Seven said. "And you." Seven felt tears on her cheeks and was surprised.
She eased back and wiped them away. "I thought I had cried as much as physically
possible." She stared at her wet fingers.</P>
<P>"I’m so sorry, Be’nal," B’Elanna said as she took Seven’s hand and kissed the
tears from her fingertips. "From now on, you’ll only have tears of joy."</P>
<P>"I wish that could be true." Seven leaned against the wall. She was
exhausted, and her back hurt. "But we live dangerous lives."</P>
<P>"I hate to think of you crying all alone," B’Elanna said as she leaned
against Seven’s chest. She loved the way their bodies molded together.</P>
<P>"Kathryn was with me," Seven said. She smiled, enjoying the familiar weight
of B’Elanna in her arms.</P>
<P>"I’m so glad," B’Elanna replied. "She really is a good friend." B’Elanna
snuggled into Seven, not caring that anyone could walk by at any moment.</P>
<P>The turbolift opened and the friend in question came out. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I just wanted to check on you and Tach. I think you two should go
to sickbay," Kathryn said. She smiled at the look of contentment on Seven’s
face. She knew without a doubt that the former Borg belonged in B’Elanna’s arms
and she’d do everything in her power to help them with any bumps that might be
in the road ahead.</P>
<P>"Captain, I’m fine," B’Elanna said into Seven’s chest. Her lanky wife
wouldn’t let her pull away enough to turn her head.</P>
<P>"She will go to sickbay," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Good." Kathryn looked down at the tatters of the exposure suit. "That looks
familiar," she said with smile.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, I will repair your ready room." Seven shifted B’Elanna to one side
but still had her trapped in her grip. "I was not… I am… I… I was upset."</P>
<P>"I know." Kathryn smiled warmly. "Just remind me to never get you upset at
me. If you did that to my ready room…and you weren’t even mad at me, I shudder
to think what would happen if I ever got you angry."</P>
<P>"I would never harm you," Seven said sincerely.</P>
<P>"I know that," Kathryn assured her.</P>
<P>"What are we talking about?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I was…upset when I thought you were…gone," Seven explained. "I damaged the
ready room…severely."</P>
<P>"It’s nothing that can’t be replaced." Kathryn rested her hand on Seven’s
arm. "Although you will be doing the repairs yourself… and since your wife did
upset you, she can help."</P>
<P>"Of course, Kathryn." B’Elanna smiled warmly. "How bad can it be?"</P>
<P>"How bad, indeed?" Kathryn raised both eyebrows and an evil grin covered her
elegant features. </P>
<P>"The damage is considerable," Seven said. "I was despondent, but I felt much
better after I slept with Kathryn." </P>
<P>"B’Elanna…" Kathryn stuttered as her eyes widened and she shook her head in a
most inelegant manor. </P>
<P>B’Elanna rolled her eyes and smiled. "How long were you able to sleep,
Be’nal?" She leaned over and kissed Seven’s cheek. She knew Seven must have been
speaking in precise terms because her wife was incapable of breaking their
vows.</P>
<P>"I am uncertain…." Seven said. "I lost track of time. Kathryn, how long was I
asleep?"</P>
<P>"Uh… less than an hour." Kathryn felt her cheeks warm and knew she was
blushing.</P>
<P>"Kathryn," B’Elanna said with sincere affection. "I know you would never take
advantage of anyone, and I know Seven wouldn’t make love to anyone else."</P>
<P>"Make love?" Seven asked. "Oh, the euphemism for sex. Of course I did not
‘sleep with’ Kathryn. I slept while she comforted me."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Kathryn, for being with Seven." B’Elanna sighed. "I’m glad she
didn’t have to go through this alone. You’re a good friend… to us both."</P>
<P>Kathryn almost said that she was just doing her job, but realized how untrue
that would have been. "You two are my friends," she finally managed to say. "And
we Janeways don’t take that lightly."</P>
<P>"Neither do we Torres’," Seven said with a smile. She saw the surprised looks
from B’Elanna and Kathryn and tilted her head to the side. "Well, I am your
wife. Am I not a Torres? Or would you rather be B’Elanna of Nine? I know we will
keep our own names for professional uses… our maiden names… but I would like the
ship’s records to reflect our union."</P>
<P>"I would be honored if you took my name, my wife." B’Elanna felt a lump in
her throat.</P>
<P>"Seven Torres? That’s nice, but…" Janeway said with a wry grin. "I kind of
like B’Elanna of Nine."</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway waited as the turbolift took her back to the bridge. The
Doctor and Opaca had examined Tach and B’Elanna thoroughly, finding them both
healthy. When Kathryn, Seven and B’Elanna had arrived at the orchard, Nara had
been hugging Tach, crying as she checked him for injuries. She took one look at
B’Elanna and rushed to her and gave her a kiss on the lips. B’Elanna had allowed
it, but her eyes drifted over to Seven who was shaking her head and smiling
indulgently. Nara had been so excited that she proceeded to kiss Seven as well.
Tach had then commented that he was missing out, and to everyone’s surprise,
Seven had kissed him on the cheek and hugged him. Ty slept through it all,
curled up under an apple tree.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The turbolift doors opened and Kathryn paused in the doorway. On screen was
Nador Omega, the side that they had taken refuge behind during the meteor storm.
She could see the continent below on the surface, but just barely. The
atmosphere was clogged with smoke and debris, and seemed to be thickening as she
watched. More startling was that the space over the planet was packed with ships
of every size. It looked like a Ferengi used shuttle lot.</P>
<P>"Commander," Janeway said as she entered the bridge. "What do we have
here?"</P>
<P>"Captain, welcome back." He turned and smiled warmly and moved to his own
chair. "How are Tach and B’Elanna?"</P>
<P>"Very well," she responded as she sat in her chair. "What’s all this?" She
motioned to the screen.</P>
<P>"The Narians are abandoning the planet," Chakotay said and his smile faded.
"They got word from Sha’Lar. The government wants them to migrate to Nador
Three. It’s about three months away."</P>
<P>"They’re giving up?" she asked incredulously.</P>
<P>"Apparently they don’t have a choice. They have some self-governing capacity,
but they are still a colony of Sha’Lar." Chakotay rubbed the tattoo over his eye
and his frown deepened.</P>
<P>"I can’t imagine that making the settlers very happy." Kathryn watched the
ships carefully maneuvering around each other.</P>
<P>Tuvok shifted his weight. "The Stellar Guard informed us that three more
phaser cannons were destroyed by meteor strikes," the tall Vulcan explained. "It
is only a matter of time before the planet returns to its state before
colonization."</P>
<P>"Have you told Tach and Nara?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"No," Chakotay said as he studied the carpet in front of his chair. "I
thought I’d leave that to you. Betoc, Tach’s friend from the Stellar Guard,
asked to come on board as soon as he gets the evacuees settled. They’re setting
up a synchronous orbit to keep the ships away from the meteors."</P>
<P>"Make him feel welcome," Kathryn said quietly. "I wish we could have helped
more."</P>
<P>"We were only delaying the inevitable," Tuvok pointed out. "Their phaser
cannons would have failed no matter what we did. Even if Lieutenant Torres and
Tach had been successful in repairing the damaged station, the planetary net
still would have failed."</P>
<P>"Let’s not mention that to Tach or Lieutenant Torres," Janeway said
pointedly.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Hurry up," Tach said as he paced the living room of the VIP quarters. "Betoc
will be here any minute." He went over to the couch. "Come out of there, my
little terror." He gently took Ty by the leg and lifted him out from behind the
couch, dangling him in the air. Ty laughed and swung his weight from side to
side.</P>
<P>"Fa, more," Ty squealed when Tach put him down.</P>
<P>"Oh no, you stay out of there while I go check on your Mother." Tach walked
back to the small bedroom and paused when he saw Nara. She was sitting on the
bed hugging her arms to her chest and was crying. "Hey," Tach whispered as he
knelt beside her. "What’s wrong?"</P>
<P>She inhaled deeply and shook her head, then grabbed him and hugged him. "I
almost lost you, you stupid old goat."</P>
<P>"But you didn’t," he said as she held her.</P>
<P>"I thought I did. Don’t you ever do anything like that again…or I’ll kill you
myself." Nara leaned back and cupped his chin in her hand. "You are my sacred
bondmate…how was I supposed to tell our son about that bond without you
around?"</P>
<P>"Shh…" He wiped the tears from her cheeks. "Our son will grow up seeing what
love is."</P>
<P>"Promise me?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Always." He leaned forward and rubbed his thick forehead against hers.</P>
<P>"Fa," Ty said proudly. "Ty fix padd."</P>
<P>Tach turned, and Nara wrapped him from behind with her arms resting over his
broad shoulders. Ty held out what was left of a data padd. He had somehow
removed the back panel and gutted it.</P>
<P>"Your son seems to have a knack for that." Nara kissed the back of Tach’s
neck. "He dismantled the clock this morning while you were off playing on that
meteor."</P>
<P>"Playing?" Tach shook his head. He held out his hand to his son. "Let’s have
a look at your project, Ty." The toddler ran to his father and handed over his
treasure. Tach inspected it carefully grunting and humming as he made note of
each dangling piece of wire hanging out of the device. "You’ve done a wonderful
job," he assured the child. "But from now on…let me handle fixing the data
padds, okay?"</P>
<P>Ty nodded and hugged his father.</P>
<P>"Was it awful?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"No worse than any other meteor I’ve beamed onto." Tach squeezed his son,
reveling in the warmth of his tiny body. "It was damn cold, and I thought
B’Elanna was going wring my neck."</P>
<P>"Were you scared, husband?" she whispered as she nuzzled his neck.</P>
<P>"Terrified. We barely got to the beam out area in time. We had already lost
our atmosphere, and the computer from the ship picked up the incoming meteor so
it beamed us out." He let Ty go and the boy sprinted off in search of something
else to fix. Tach turned to face Nara. "We beamed onto a good size meteor, so it
had its own gravity, but it was weak. We had to tie off…and let me tell you,
being tied to B’Elanna for nine hours isn’t exactly a pleasant experience."</P>
<P>"She was worried about Seven, wasn’t she?" Nara asked as she tucked his
graying hair behind his ears.</P>
<P>"Yes." He closed his eyes and rested his head on Nara’s chest. "We waited, we
couldn’t call for help because the impact with the station sent out an
electromagnetic pulse… it knocked out our comm systems." He wrapped his arms
around her. "It took us an hour just to get communications between our suits,
and let me tell you, I think I learned every curse in Klingon and Human."</P>
<P>"English," Nara corrected. "Neelix informed me that the Starfleet standard
language is English… but, yes…it is from Earth."</P>
<P>"Whatever it’s called, it is a…colorful language. Since we hadn’t been
rescued right away, we knew that <I>Voyager</I> probably thought we were dead."
Tach pulled back. "She was worried about Seven, and I swear, if the Stellar
Guard hadn’t found us, I think B’Elanna would have jumped off of that meteor and
flown back to <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"She probably would have made it, too," Nara said with a half grin.</P>
<P>"Come on, Betoc is waiting," Tach said as he climbed to his feet. "We have to
find out what the Minister wants us to do."</P>
<P>"I don’t know why the Minister of Sha’Lar should have any say in our
decisions." Nara stood and tugged at her skirt hem. "We’ve been doing just fine
without them for almost 80 years."</P>
<P>"I know, but they’ve been trying to get control of our colony for at least 75
of those years." Tach wrapped his arm around her and held her to his side as
they walked out to the living area. "The Minister will probably get reelected
because of our triumphant return to the civilized sector."</P>
<P>"Ha, civilized… the people of Sha’Lar don’t know what that even means." Nara
bumped him with her hip. "Nador Three isn’t much better."</P>
<P>"You’ve never even been there…or Sha’Lar for that matter," Tach said "But we
will not be moving to Sha’Lar, that you can be sure of."</P>
<P>"Are you kidding? They wouldn’t even let me on the planet." Nara looked
around for Ty but didn’t see him. "Now…where’s your son?"</P>
<P>They heard a crash, and turned to Ty standing on a chair he had scooted over
to the replicator. He had Tach’s toolbox at his feet and was prying the front
panel from the wall.</P>
<P>"Tyranlanar!" Nara yelled as she ran toward him.</P>
<P>"Ty fix," he said with a satisfied smile. He pointed to a pile of various
foods splattered on the floor.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna stood at one end of the conference room table waiting for
the rest of the group to arrive. They had been taking a walk in the new orchard
and left when it became too crowded. For the moment they had the huge room to
themselves.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said, chastising her wife. She looked at the door as she
trapped Seven’s wandering hands just as she was about to reach her nipples.
"What are you doing? This place is gonna’ be crawling with people in a half
hour."</P>
<P>"Thirty-nine minutes," Seven corrected as she lifted B’Elanna and sat her on
the table and then began kissing her neck. She still needed assurance that she
had B’Elanna back, and for Seven that meant tasting her skin.</P>
<P>"Someone could walk in any second," B’Elanna said even as her body responded.
"Oh god," she whispered when Seven nibbled on her throat. "We can’t do this."
Her legs came up and wrapped around Seven’s waist. Both women were consummate
professionals, but Seven seemed to need proof that she wasn’t dreaming, that
B’Elanna was in her arms.</P>
<P>"Thirty-seven minutes," Seven said as she pressed against her wife. Her hands
moved across the Klingon’s chest, stopping when she reached her breasts. "Kiss
me," Seven ordered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked over Seven’s shoulder at the door and then pulled her closer.
Their lips met in a heated press as Seven’s caresses focused on the pebbled nubs
forming under B’Elanna’s uniform tunic. She circled her wife’s hardening
nipples, smiling into the kiss when B’Elanna began to whimper.</P>
<P>"Stop," B’Elanna begged as she eased back to get a breath. "We can’t do this
in here and you’re making me crazy," she said but then leaned back and grabbed
Seven and pulled her back to her mouth. Her legs squeezed Seven, grinding their
bodies together. "Oh… we don’t have time to do this," she whimpered. She reached
into Seven’s blouse and moaned when she felt the warm weight of her wife’s
breast.</P>
<P>Seven tossed her head back and bit her lip to keep from crying out and then
put her hands over B’Elanna’s. "I almost lost you…I just need to feel your
touch, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Well… now I need a whole lot more than that," B’Elanna said with a growl.
She used her legs to yank Seven closer. </P>
<P>Their lips met, it was fast and hard, and the passion ignited as their
tongues dueled. Seven lifted B’Elanna up and then climbed onto the table, laying
the Klingon across the hard, simulated wooden surface. She straddled the shorter
woman and leaned down, but her belly got in the way. She rested her weight on
one arm and began exploring with the other. B’Elanna’s legs tangled with her
lanky wife’s as they each battled to vanquish their earlier fears. B’Elanna felt
the warmth of Seven’s hardening nipple under her fingers just as they heard the
whoosh of the doors.</P>
<P>Tuvok cleared his throat as he stood in the doorway. "I do not believe that
was the intended use for that particular piece of furniture," the Vulcan
stated.</P>
<P>"Oh geeze," B’Elanna said as she tried to move her wife off of her. Seven
slowly disengaged from B’Elanna and climbed off of her and then helped her down
from the table.</P>
<P>"Commander Tuvok, you are early," Seven stated as she buttoned her
blouse.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Tuvok raised one eyebrow. "Perhaps you lost track of time. The
meeting begins in twenty-one point two minutes. It is standard procedure to do a
security check before allowing the captain to meet with foreign
dignitaries."</P>
<P>B’Elanna blushed furiously as she turned her back and tried to pull her tunic
down. It was tangled with her bra, which had been pushed up above her breasts.
"Can’t you wait outside?" she asked. She realized she couldn’t get the tunic
back into place because her hands were shaking. </P>
<P>"Commander?" Seven nodded at him. He turned around while she went to her
wife. "Hold still," Seven said as she untangled the fabric. Her fingers glanced
across the hardened nipples and B’Elanna gave her a glare that Janeway would
have been proud of. Seven merely smirked in response. "There, you are
presentable," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Wait." B’Elanna tucked Seven’s blouse into her slacks. Seven’s belly was too
big for her to comfortably wear her biosuit, and when she was officially off
duty she chose the more comfortable slacks. "There," B’Elanna said once the
willowy blonde was mostly dressed. She heard the door hiss again and shook her
head. "I can’t believe I let you do that," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Tuvok," Janeway said as she went to the table. "Our guest should be beaming
over. I thought we should accompany him personally." She looked at B’Elanna and
tilted her head to the side. She noticed the deep red color on her chief
engineer’s face. "Ladies, how are you?"</P>
<P>"Fine, ma’am," B’Elanna said a bit too quickly.</P>
<P>"We are…well," Seven added.</P>
<P>"Well?" Janeway asked with a knowing glance. "It looks like you two have a
bit of extra…energy. Perhaps you could work on my ready room when we finish
here?"</P>
<P>"Sure," B’Elanna said. She went to the table and pulled out a chair for
Seven. "Why don’t you sit. Save your energy for later."</P>
<P>Seven slid into the chair, pausing to smile at her wife. "I have plenty of
energy," she whispered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna sat at the table waiting for Janeway and Tuvok to return.
Seven had tried to convince B’Elanna that a few kisses were in order, but the
Klingon wasn’t about to get caught necking in the conference room…twice. Unknown
to B’Elanna or her amorous wife, Tuvok had used the walk to the Transporter Room
to give the captain a detailed report of the new use Torres and Seven had
discovered for the table.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said without looking at her wife. "Don’t even think it."</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked innocently.</P>
<P>"You were about to kiss my neck," B’Elanna said as she spun her chair and
looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"I was merely checking to see that your hair was in place," Seven said. She
was standing close to B’Elanna, and had in fact been ready to kiss her neck
before her wife had turned the chair around. "Besides, I missed you, Be’nal,"
Seven said as she gave B’Elanna her most pitiful pout.</P>
<P>"You can just keep missing me until we are in our quarters," B’Elanna said.
She leaned back and used her foot to playfully move her wife away.</P>
<P>"And if I do not wish to wait?" Seven grabbed her wife’s foot.</P>
<P>The doors opened saving B’Elanna from a fate far better than death, probably
more like heaven, and the captain led a small group into the room. B’Elanna
stood and quickly sidestepped to avoid Seven’s grasp.</P>
<P>"Betoc," Janeway said as she went to the head of the table. "This is
Lieutenant B’Elanna Torres, my Chief Engineer, and Seven of Nine, my
Astrometrics officer."</P>
<P>"A pleasure to meet you," he said as he moved to sit next to Janeway.</P>
<P>Tach was next to Tuvok. "B’Elanna is the one who helped me on the station,"
the Narian said. "She is my Fas’na, and Seven is her wife."</P>
<P>Betoc paused, then smiled. He went to B’Elanna and offered his hands.
"Welcome, Fas’na. Tach is a supreme pain in the backside, but I hope you will
not hold that against me."</P>
<P>Nara moved up beside Tach and wrapped her arm around his waist. "Betoc is our
Fas’fa. He is the brother we invited to our family the same way we did you,"
Nara said to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Is this a family reunion?" Seven asked as she sat.</P>
<P>"No," Betoc said with a laugh. "And you are correct, we should get down to
the matters at hand."</P>
<P>"What can we do for you?" Janeway asked. "I understand that your people have
decided to leave Nador Omega."</P>
<P>"We did not make that decision," Betoc said as he sat. He looked around the
table as Nara and Tach sat next to Tuvok. "The Minister of Sha’lar decided for
us. We are a colony, and while we were considering asking for independence
before this tragedy, we are in no position to bargain now."</P>
<P>"Can you stay? Try to rebuild with terra-forming?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"That would be difficult," Tach answered. "Most of our industrialized areas
were destroyed. We don’t have any means to repair the damaged phaser cannons,
and certainly no way to build new ones."</P>
<P>"We’ve been ordered to immigrate to Nador Three. It’s close, and they have a
good sized population willing to accept us," Betoc said. He clenched his fists
and his face darkened. "That is one of the problems."</P>
<P>"I don’t understand," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Betoc? What have you heard?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"Our colony, though small, has produced some of the greatest minds our people
have ever seen," Betoc explained to Janeway. "And as you know," he said to Tach,
"They have been trying to get our children to go to Sha’lar for schooling, at
least to the university."</P>
<P>"Yes, and they’d have our children brainwashed before they ever reached
Sha’lar," Nara said bitterly. "A three year trip through space to teach them how
to be good citizens, and then off to the University for indoctrination."</P>
<P>"Is that what they want now?" Kathryn leaned forward.</P>
<P>"No," Betoc said. He looked down at the table, unwilling to meet Tach’s
eyes.</P>
<P>"They want the children now?" Seven demanded. She slammed her fist onto the
table. "No, they cannot have Ty. I will not allow it."</P>
<P>"Easy." B’Elanna covered Seven’s clenched fist. "Tach and Nara will handle
this."</P>
<P>"We won’t send our child off to be raised by strangers," Nara said
firmly.</P>
<P>"They don’t want that," Betoc said as he finally raised his head. "Tach can
keep his son."</P>
<P>"Thank the goddess." Tach let out a sigh of relief. </P>
<P>"Tach, it’s worse." Betoc looked over at Nara. "The Minister is invoking the
ancient rule. He says that the best of our people’s… family lines have been
concentrated on Nador Omega, that the best scientists were sent here originally
and that it’s time we…corrected that mistake."</P>
<P>"No," Nara said. "He can’t be serious. There hasn’t been genetic reassignment
in a hundred years."</P>
<P>"They wouldn’t ask that of us," Tach said as he gripped Nara’s hand. "It’s
barbaric."</P>
<P>"They can and they are," Betoc said. "When we reach Nador Three, we will be
reassigned. Of course, husbands will be compensated," he added
sarcastically.</P>
<P>"And just what is the going rate for a wife?" Nara demanded.</P>
<P>"Twelve sectors of prime farming land and his choice from the Deputy
Minister’s stable of concubines."</P>
<P>"I’ll die first," Nara said as her eyes narrowed. </P>
<P>"We are sacred bound," Tach said. His browridge darkened and his deep brown
eyes showed only hate. "We cannot be unjoined."</P>
<P>"You know they do not recognize sacred bonds," Betoc said. "Our colony is one
of the only ones who’ve returned to the ways of the ancient goddess. Those on
Sha’Lar care more for their own desires than those of the goddess."</P>
<P>"What is he talking about?" B’Elanna asked Tach.</P>
<P>"Genetic reassignment was a common practice on Sha’Lar for hundreds of
years," Tach said quietly. His voice was shaking. "A Minister would notice that
one province had a better class of athletes, or engineers, or like now,
scientists. He would order all of the women of the area… reassigned outside of
the province to spread out the genetic base by giving some to each municipality
to ensure diversity."</P>
<P>"What about the families?" Kathryn asked, her eyes wide with shock.</P>
<P>"Never worry," Nara said bitterly. "The husbands kept the male children, and
were well paid for their wives. They usually got a new wife in the deal as well,
from another province."</P>
<P>"Captain, you cannot allow this," Seven said as she looked to Kathryn.</P>
<P>"We can’t change their social system, Seven. No matter how appalling we think
it is," Janeway said sadly. She looked to Tach. "But, we can help you in any way
possible. Your shuttle was destroyed, so I am offering you asylum here, on
<I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said as he raised an eyebrow. "You could be involving
<I>Voyager</I> in a social revolt, a clear violation of the Prime Directive. The
Minister may send armed troops to enforce this genetic reassignment."</P>
<P>"They’re already on the way," Betoc said. "As soon as the Minister heard
about our problems a month ago, he sent troops from Nador Three. This was
probably his plan all along. The troops will be here in two months."</P>
<P>"Well, we won’t be here when they arrive," Tach said. "Betoc, our shuttle was
destroyed trying to save the planet. I think the least you can do is find me a
replacement and give me a head start."</P>
<P>"Gladly, Fas’fa," Betoc said. "The Supreme Commander of the Guard was killed
by one of the first meteor strikes. I’m the acting commander, so I can get you a
small ship without anyone noticing. We’ve lost so many as it is, I should be
able to add one more to the list of lost ships."</P>
<P>"Will they come after you?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"I doubt it," Betoc said. "Tach and Nara were reported lost with the rest of
the Caldori Province. I never updated the records…I was afraid something like
this might happen."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Tach said. He looked over at Nara. "I will never let them
separate us."</P>
<P>"If you have been reported dead, you cannot go to any Narian colony," Seven
pointed out.</P>
<P>"I’d rather go back to Jusari Prime and live out my days in our cabin than be
sold off to a new husband." Nara looked over at Seven. "At least it would be my
choice."</P>
<P>"There is another option," Kathryn said as she looked at Nara. "You could
stay on <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"I remind you that <I>Voyager’s</I> resources are limited," Tuvok said. The
others looked at him, expecting him to list the reasons why they couldn’t stay,
but he had other plans. "Tach’s ability as a farmer has already freed up
impressive amounts of energy as well increasing the production of oxygen. Nara’s
ability to make Mister Neelix’s food…more palatable has also helped reduce the
amount of replicator rations being utilized. Their staying on board would be the
logical choice."</P>
<P>Nara looked at Tach and nodded.</P>
<P>"Captain, we would be honored to stay on board, at least for the time being,"
Tach said. "We’ll take a shuttle from Betoc, and if we start to outstay our
welcome, we’ll find a nice planet where we can settle down."</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "You will not leave to settle down. You have already proven
your value to the ship and you have…family here. It would be illogical for you
to leave. Besides, unlike some of the current passengers, you are improving the
quality of life on board immensely."</P>
<P>"I agree, you have made things better," Kathryn said with a smile. She turned
to Seven. "Although I think Mister Neelix is much more than a passenger and he
has been invaluable."</P>
<P>"Of course he is," Seven said indignantly. </P>
<P>"I think my wife is referring to the <I>Equinox</I> crew," B’Elanna said with
a smirk. "They haven’t pitched in much."</P>
<P>"Indeed," Tuvok said. "Aside from performing the duties we have required of
them, they have taken no initiative." Tuvok straighten his back and tilted his
head at Janeway. "Tach and Nara’s willingness to assist the ship while they were
indeed only passengers… suggests that they would be an enormous asset to the
crew."</P>
<P>"I’m already sold on the idea, Tuvok," Kathryn said warmly. "Don’t worry
Tu-vee, Ty and his parents will be a welcome addition."</P>
<P>"Vulcans do not worry," Tuvok responded.</P>
<P>"I should be going," Betoc said sadly. "I have much to do."</P>
<P>"You’re welcome to spend some time with Tach and Nara if you like," Kathryn
said.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Betoc said. "I will only stay a short while. There are others
under my command that I have to arrange ‘<I>destroyed’</I> vessels for. Many in
the Stellar Guard have sacred bondings as well. They are scattering in all
directions in hopes of escaping the genetic reassignment."</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway said as she stood. "I’ll leave you to make the
arrangements. I have to go convince my first officer that we have room for a few
more crew on our manifest."</P>
<P>"If he argues, I will be happy to convince him," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so," Kathryn said. "As a matter of fact, I don’t think I want
you doing any more convincing at all. Which reminds me, I want you and B’Elanna
to begin fixing my ready room."</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said grimly.</P>
<P>"And when you’re finished there," Janeway said as she paused at the door. "We
need to have a discussion about the proper use of this conference room."
Kathryn’s eyes drifted to the table and then over to B’Elanna. "Is that
understood?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," B’Elanna said. She watched Kathryn leave and then leaned over
to her wife. "You are in so much trouble," she whispered.</P>
<P>"We," Seven said as she turned to her wife. "<I>We</I> are in so much
trouble. I was I not alone on the table," she whispered.</P>

<P>Convincing Chakotay that having Tach and Nara join the crew was much easier
than Kathryn had anticipated. She had thought that he would play Devil’s
advocate and have a dozen reasons why they shouldn’t add three more travelers to
<I>Voyager’s</I> manifest. One look at Chakotay’s expanding waistline and
Kathryn knew he was probably more impressed with Nara’s ability in the kitchen
than with Tach’s skill as an engineer or farmer. She couldn’t blame him; she had
been enjoying meals more with each passing day. Neelix had happily let Nara take
over his kitchen and been quite content to be the "chef’s assistant" while Nara
whipped up delicious creations. Janeway wondered if he would be as gracious now
that Nara was going to be staying. She hoped so. Nara’s herbed beef was one of
her favorites, and she couldn’t wait to taste what Nara would come up with for
the new fruit that was almost ready for harvesting. She hoped there was an apple
pie somewhere in her future.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Betoc had brought a beaten up shuttle to Tach, which thrilled Tom Paris. He
had taken one look at the sleek lines of the ship and then begged Tach to let
him help restore it. Betoc visited with his friends and finally left to help
with the evacuations. <I>Voyager</I> couldn’t do much to help so they continued
on toward the Alpha Quadrant and got back into the ship’s regular routine. The
first thing Janeway had to deal with was disciplining two crewmembers for
"inappropriate displays of affection."</P>
<P>"This isn’t the first time you’ve been warned about this particular type of
behavior, B’Elanna," Janeway said as she stood outside her ready room. "So, why
don’t you two start in here, and then completely strip and clean cargo bay two.
It’s gotten a bit run down since Seven stopped using it to regenerate every
day." </P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven nodded as the door opened. Janeway raised both eyebrows
and motioned them in, then went back to the bridge. Seven went in first and she
looked at the damage. All of the grief she had felt came rolling over her like a
wave, pushing her under the surface and threatening to drown her. She felt her
legs give out and B’Elanna grabbed her arm.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she asked as she moved around in front of the former drone. </P>
<P>Seven took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She let out a long sigh and
then opened her eyes to see B’Elanna staring at her with concern covering her
features. She smiled weakly at her Klingon wife.</P>
<P>"Seven? What just happened?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Being here…reminded me." Seven rested her hand on B’Elanna’s shoulder. "I
believe it just ‘caught up’ with me."</P>
<P>"Well, I’m here," B’Elanna said. "Now, shall we get started?" </P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she turned. She looked at what had been the ready
room and the Klingon’s knees went weak. "Kahless!" she exclaimed. "Was there a
decompression in here?" Her eyes were drawn to the conduit that had been ripped
from the wall and the bulkhead that was bent and twisted. She had only seen that
kind of damage from explosive decompressions or from photon torpedo impacts.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said quietly. She looked at the shredded remains of the couch and
felt shame filling her. </P>
<P>B’Elanna turned back to Seven. "Be’nal," she whispered and took her taller
lover into her arms. "I would do anything to take this pain away from you."</P>
<P>"You already have," Seven answered. "You came home to me." She squeezed
B’Elanna, inhaling her scent and burying her face in her satiny hair.</P>
<P>"And I always will," B’Elanna said into Seven’s chest.</P>
<P>"In the future, I will not allow you to go alone," Seven said as she stepped
back. "Now, we should begin. I believe our task will not take long."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and turned to the destroyed room. "Love, I don’t even know
where to start."</P>
<P>"I believe we will need to collect and recycle the …damaged materials…and
then replicate replacements," Seven said logically.</P>
<P>"Seven, my beloved," B’Elanna shook her head. "It would take a full
engineering team at least a day to put a dent in this."</P>
<P>"I believe there are enough dents in it now," Seven said. She looked at her
wife innocently, then smirked, letting her know that she was teasing her. "As
for the repairs, I do not think it will take long at all." Seven walked to the
comm panel near the door. It was one of the few remaining things that were
undamaged. </P>
<P>"Oh?" B’Elanna said. She folded her arms and leaned against the wall. "Do
Borg have some magical abilities that I don’t know about?"</P>
<P>Seven paused and then leered at B’Elanna. "You have experienced almost all of
my…magical abilities…or have you forgotten the ‘wow’ phenomenon?"</P>
<P>"As wonderful as your skills are…I don’t think that will help us right now."
B’Elanna rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked as she scanned the room with her Borg enhanced
eyepiece. She turned to the console and held her hand out to it. Her tubules
appeared and then plunged into the control panel. The debris began beaming out
and after a few moments, the room was empty.</P>
<P>"Impressive," B’Elanna said with a smile. "But even if you can beam in the
replacements… we don’t have that many replicator rations between us."</P>
<P>"We have the additional rations from the time we were on Jusari Prime. The
captain decided to give us rations based on our time…not <I>Voyager’s</I>,"
Seven said. "I was not going to mention it until after the baby. I wanted to
surprise you." She looked across the room as she used the direct interface with
the console to send the commands and the new items began appearing.</P>
<P>"You rat," B’Elanna said as she moved closer to her wife and wrapped her arm
around her waist. "Oh, and I don’t think this was the punishment Janeway had in
mind."</P>
<P>"As you are so fond of saying…what she doesn’t know, won’t hurt her." Seven
smiled. "I am beaming in a replacement bulkhead section… we will have to install
that manually."</P>
<P>"I think I can live with that," B’Elanna said happily. "Got any tricks up
your sleeve to clean the cargo bay?"</P>
<P>"Of course." Seven’s smile widened. "And then we can return to our quarters
and I can… finish what Tuvok interrupted."</P>
<P>"I love the way you think." B’Elanna kissed Seven’s cheek. "Just don’t tell
the captain."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn returned to the bridge after a late lunch and went to check on her
ready room. She expected to find B’Elanna and Seven hard at work. She entered,
and was stunned to see the room finished, but not just finished, it was perfect,
right down to Kathryn’s lucky teacup. She walked over and picked up the fragile
item, only then seeing tiny repaired cracks. There was a data padd next to it,
so she picked it up. It was from Seven, and it explained that she had been
forced to replicate the teacup because Kathryn’s had been too badly damaged. She
added a few repaired cracks to remind Kathryn of the time they had shared. Seven
thanked Kathryn for ‘holding her together’ when her entire universe had fallen
apart. It was an unexpected gift, and Kathryn decided that the new cup was
certainly much luckier than its predecessor had been.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven hurried through the corridor toward their quarters. They
had finished cleaning the cargo bay in less than twenty minutes. B’Elanna had
been shocked when Seven showed her how she had kept the vast room so pristine.
Seven had taken a few minutes to put things into their proper places, stepped
into the corridor with B’Elanna, and then activated a program, "Seven of Nine
cleaning protocol one." The cargo transporter activated and beamed every
non-equipment particle into a refuse container. The entire process took only a
few minutes. B’Elanna found the entire process fascinating, and it gave her
insight into her wife’s thought process. She then concentrated on getting back
to their quarters.</P>
<P>"Stop it," B’Elanna said when Seven’s hand brushed across her leg a bit too
close to her thigh.</P>
<P>"I assure you, my contact was inadvertent," Seven said with a wicked
smirk.</P>
<P>"Right," B’Elanna said, not believing her for a moment. "We’re almost
home…just be patient. I don’t want the captain giving us any more projects."</P>
<P>"I will comply," Seven said unhappily.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Nara yelled from the far end of the corridor.</P>
<P>"Damn," the Klingon whispered. "We were so close," she said as she looked at
their door less than ten paces away. "Nara, what can we do for you?"</P>
<P>Seven stopped and crossed her arms over her chest and let out a frustrated
sigh.</P>
<P>"I take it I’m interrupting?" Nara asked as she studied Seven. After living
with the hot-blooded couple on the planet for a year, she could tell when Seven
had <I>plans</I> for B’Elanna, though it didn’t stop her from interfering. In
fact, she rather enjoyed tormenting the lanky blonde.</P>
<P>Seven started to answer, but B’Elanna reached out and squeezed her hand. "Of
course not. What can we do for you?"</P>
<P>"Actually, Tach and I would like to do something for you," Nara
explained.</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven asked. She looked over at her friend and tilted her head. "We
are pleased that you will be joining the crew. We should be giving you a
welcoming gift."</P>
<P>"Nonsense." Nara shook her head. "I know that you two are married, but Tach
and I would like to sponsor you in a bonding ceremony. You’re family now, so
it’s only right."</P>
<P>"Bonding?" B’Elanna asked suspiciously. "Does it involve a sweathouse?"</P>
<P>"Great goddess, no." Nara shook her head and laughed. "The ways of the
goddess are very clear. Only couples who are sacred bound can invite another
couple into the great rite. The ceremony will recognize the unique bond you
already share and ask the great goddess to bless it."</P>
<P>"You would do this for us?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Of course, you long-legged fool," Nara answered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked up at Seven and they both smiled. "Well," B’Elanna said, "as
long as it doesn’t involve any sweating rituals… we’d love to."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Nara said as she hugged B’Elanna. The Klingon resisted at first
but then returned the embrace with enthusiasm. Nara was family after all. Nara
then moved to Seven. "You won’t regret it. The goddess will guide and bless you
and the baby." She hugged Seven and then eased back and smiled. "Now, off to bed
with you."</P>
<P>"It is nowhere near out bedtime," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"Like that’s ever stopped you two," Nara said as she walked away.</P>
<P>"Come on, Be’nal. You’ve waited long enough." B’Elanna said opened their
door. She took Seven’s hand and tugged her into their quarters. "Now…what did
you have in mind when you were mauling me in the conference room?"</P>
<P>"I shall show you," Seven said with a growl. She picked B’Elanna up and
carried her to their small table in the dining area and sat her on the
transparent surface. She buried her hands in B’Elanna’s hair and gently kissed
her eyes, then her cheeks and finally moved to her lips. The kiss deepened and
Seven eased her wife onto her back. A quick flick of her Borg enhanced wrist and
the front of B’Elanna’s tunic was shredded.</P>
<P>"I love it when you get impatient," B’Elanna said with a growl. She felt the
cool air on her skin and her nipples grew rigid as Seven tore her bra off and
began kissing her chest. "Oh yes, Seven, that," she whispered. Seven’s lips
wrapped around the rosy bud and drew it into her mouth. Seven smiled when her
wife began growling loudly.</P>
<P>"Do you like that?" Seven asked as she moved her mouth to the other side.</P>
<P>"Oh…yes," B’Elanna yelled when Seven clamped down on her nipple.</P>
<P>"So do I," Seven volunteered. She moaned as she lovingly caressed her wife’s
nipple with her hand while her mouth feasted on the other. She carefully raked
her teeth over the sensitive jewel, growling when B’Elanna whimpered. She
quickly brought her tongue out to soothe the tender flesh. "My beautiful
Be’nal," she whispered. "I thought I would never make love to you again." She
moved back up and kissed B’Elanna deeply, reverently, and let all of her love
pour through the meeting of their lips.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna promised when Seven pulled back to take a gulp of
air.</P>
<P>"I know," Seven said. She smiled and began nipping at B’Elanna’s graceful
neck. Her lips and teeth covered every inch, careful not to leave any bit of
skin unloved.</P>
<P>"More," B’Elanna said with pleading sigh. "I need you."</P>
<P>"Then you shall have me," Seven whispered into her lover’s ear, using the
moment to gently nibble on her earlobe.</P>
<P>Seven’s hand moved down to her wife’s waist and tugged off her trousers and
panties in one yank. She moaned as her fingers tested the wetness. "You feel so
good, my Be’nal," Seven whispered as her mouth left a trail of kisses down to
B’Elanna’s stomach.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sucked in a deep breath and her body shook. Seven paused to look
behind her for the chair. She pulled it to her and sat, then lifted B’Elanna’s
legs over her shoulders and began drawing her Klingon toward her.</P>
<P>"I missed my lunch," Seven said as she nipped at B’Elanna’s caramel toned
thigh.</P>
<P>"Lucky me," B’Elanna said with a laugh.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she nipped the opposite thigh. "Lucky me."</P>

<P>Seven awoke to the familiar sensation of B’Elanna’s breath warming her belly.
She smiled and moved her hand under the blanket and onto B’Elanna’s head. "Come
out of there," Seven said without opening her eyes. "You are going to
suffocate."</P>
<P>B’Elanna growled onto Seven’s belly one last time and then crawled up her
wife’s body. Her face peeked out from under the covers just as Seven opened her
eyes. "I was talking to my daughter… and I will not suffocate," B’Elanna said as
she stretched and kissed Seven’s chin.</P>
<P>"I do not want to risk it." Seven wrapped her arms around B’Elanna’s bare
shoulders. "Perhaps you should use a triox compound before you attempt this
again." Seven moved her hand and gently caressed B’Elanna’s cheek. "I am sure
Opaca would give me a hypospray if I explained your preoccupation with crawling
under the blankets."</P>
<P>"Very funny," B’Elanna said and shifted her weight onto her elbow. "You never
seem to mind me crawling under there when I’m seeing to your needs." Her hand
drifted down and brushed across the tightly curled blonde hairs at the junction
of Seven’s leg. "Maybe I should stop that too?"</P>
<P>"You have not suffocated yet," Seven said logically. "Perhaps I was
overreacting." She held B’Elanna’s hand in place over her most intimate
region.</P>
<P>"Oh really?" B’Elanna raised both eyebrows almost to her hairline. "So, do
you think I should test this new theory of yours?"</P>
<P>Seven reached out and tangled her fingers in B’Elanna’s hair. It was down,
loose, and full of static from her time under the blankets. "I love you," she
whispered, her voice suddenly trembling. She pulled B’Elanna toward her,
cradling her on her chest. Even with Seven’s swelling stomach, they were a
perfect fit. B’Elanna’s body naturally molded around Seven’s, her leg finding
its perfect spot on the former drone’s thigh below her belly. Seven squeezed her
eyes shut and clung to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Are you okay?" B’Elanna asked. She rubbed her wife’s ribs and then down to
her belly, and finally circled her navel.</P>
<P>"Yes. I am just happy." Seven reached down and held B’Elanna’s hand and
kissed the top of her head.</P>
<P>B’Elanna moaned happily and nuzzled Seven’s chest. She loved the creamy
smoothness of her wife’s skin, the way it looked like cream with a hint of
strawberries tinting it. Sometimes she could swear that the strawberry color of
her beloved’s skin had also flavored her as well. B’Elanna kissed the skin she
was studying, letting her lips linger as her tongue reached out to taste the
softness. </P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna murmured. "You taste delicious." Her mouth migrated over to
the sweet bud of Seven’s nipple. It hardened instantly and B’Elanna drew the
tender flesh between her lips so that her tongue could flicker across it.</P>
<P>Seven tried to answer but could only manage a very unBorg-like squeak.
B’Elanna laughed as she moved to the other side so that neither breast would be
neglected.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven managed to whisper. "Please…"</P>
<P>"Shall I test your blanket theory?" B’Elanna whispered as she kissed Seven.
"Right now?" she mumbled between kisses.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered. Her body cried out for her wife’s caress.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes lit up as she began crawling under the blankets, carefully
easing past Seven’s belly. She inhaled deeply, savoring the aroma of her wife’s
arousal just as the door chime sounded.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she held B’Elanna under the blanket. "They will
leave."</P>
<P>The door chime sounded again and B’Elanna rested her forehead on Seven’s hip
and then she laughed. "They’re not leaving," she said from under the blankets.
The door chimed again and the Klingon began giggling.</P>
<P>"This is not funny," Seven said with a growl. She yanked the blankets off of
her naked wife.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she climbed up Seven’s body. "But if I don’t laugh… I
will take my bat’tleth to whoever is at that door. She kissed Seven, her lips
lingered, and she tried to absorb as much of her sweetness as she could.</P>
<P>"Make them leave," Seven whined when the door chime sounded insistently.</P>
<P>"I’ll do my best," B’Elanna promised as she tossed the sheet over her wife’s
gloriously naked body. She grabbed a robe and went to the living area. </P>
<P>"Take your bat’tleth," Seven yelled from the bedroom.</P>
<P>B’Elanna paused next to the door, but decided that arming herself was
probably not the best course of action. "Yes?" she demanded as the door hissed
open.</P>
<P>"Come with me," Tach said as he grabbed B’Elanna’s robe and yanked her into
the corridor. He pulled her out of the way as Nara rushed into her quarters.</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna yelled and pulled her robe closed.</P>
<P>"It is time." Tach continued down the corridor with B’Elanna in tow. </P>
<P>"Ouch," the Klingon said as she stubbed her toe. "Damn it, Tach, what the
hell are you doing?" she asked, hopping on one foot.</P>
<P>"You have agreed to the sacred bond. It is the time of the rising sun," he
said as if that explained everything.</P>
<P>"And it couldn’t wait until I finished making love to my wife?" B’Elanna
demanded, yanking him to a stop. She reached down and rubbed her toe, happily
noticing that she had not drawn blood.</P>
<P>Tach stared at her for a moment and then shook his head and laughed. "Didn’t
you get enough of her yesterday afternoon…or last night?"</P>
<P>"As a matter of fact, no. I didn’t." She crossed her arms over her chest.
"Hey…how do you know what or when we…"</P>
<P>"Oh please, all the sound proofing in the universe couldn’t keep that a
secret," he said. He yanked her down the corridor. "Besides, there’s a pool
going on as we speak."</P>
<P>"What kind of pool?" B’Elanna jogged to keep up with her taller friend.</P>
<P>Tach stopped and pinned her in his gaze, his eyes sparkling with mischief.
"They’re betting on the first night you two don’t…have…intimate relations," he
said. "Nara put twenty of her rations on a year and a half from now."</P>
<P>"You let her bet on my… uh, my…"</P>
<P>"Your sex life," he said with a smile. "I put my rations on two years from
now."</P>
<P>"Paris," B’Elanna said with a growl. "I’ll bet he started this damn thing.
I’ll kill him."</P>
<P>"Wouldn’t it be easier to just be a little more…quiet?" he asked as he took
her arm and moved her toward his destination.</P>
<P>"I don’t think that’s really an option," she said. Her face blushed bright
red and a wicked grin covered her features. She cleared her throat and tugged
her robe closed as they entered the turbolift. "Where exactly are you taking me?
I mean, I am half naked."</P>
<P>"So I noticed," he said as he rolled his eyes.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven called out. She rolled onto her side and tried to look out
of the door into the living room. "Did you kill them, my Be’nal?" she asked with
a smile.</P>
<P>"No, darling," Nara said sweetly as she barged into the bedroom. She scanned
the room and then went to the closet and rifled through the clothing.</P>
<P>"Where is my wife?" Seven demanded, struggling to get out of the bed. Her
huge belly had completely shifted her center of gravity and she still hadn’t
been able to master simple tasks like sitting up.</P>
<P>"It’s time," Nara said as she found a robe. She turned around and laughed at
Seven. She was trying to get off of her back but looked like a sickly turtle
wrapped in a rumpled sheet. </P>
<P>"Time for what?" Seven grunted as she fought to sit up.</P>
<P>"Come on," Nara ordered. She took Seven’s hand and pulled her to her feet.
The sheet fell away and Nara stared at her friend, her eyes taking a complete
inventory of the lanky blonde’s attributes. "How can anyone with a belly that
big look so incredible?"</P>
<P>"What have you done with my wife?" Seven asked as she took her robe. She
shoved her arm into one sleeve, and in her haste, almost ripped out the seams.
Her second arm didn’t have as much luck, and she ended up struggling to find the
opening.</P>
<P>"It’s time for your bonding, my clumsy oaf," Nara said with a laugh. She
grabbed the robe and guided it onto Seven’s arm. "Now, let’s go."</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, but followed her short friend. When they reached the
door, Seven paused.</P>
<P>"What?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna was…displeased the last time I left our quarters dressed only in a
robe." Seven pulled the belt tighter. "She was quite unhinged, and I do not like
to intentionally upset her."</P>
<P>"Yes, Seven," Nara covered her mouth to hide her wicked smile. "But I don’t
think that this robe would have upset her. I heard the other robe was silk…see
through…very short, and left <I>nothing</I> to the imagination." She had heard
about the ill-fated journey from Neelix. Apparently Seven had a craving for
fresh fruit in the early morning hours and went to the mess hall. She grabbed
one of the robes that B’Elanna had given her as a romantic gift, not worrying
that it was mostly see though. B’Elanna did not appreciate the fact that half of
the late night shift ended up escorting Seven back to her quarters, clamoring
for the right to her carry her tray of sliced fruit.</P>
<P>"A valid point," Seven said. "I have never understood why humanoids have such
an aversion to nudity." </P>
<P>Nara opened the door and took Seven’s arm. "It wasn’t any aversion that upset
B’Elanna. It was the line of men following you back to your quarters."</P>
<P>"There were several women as well," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"No doubt." Nara smiled and guided Seven toward the turbolift. "How would you
feel if B’Elanna paraded through the ship half naked…with the crew following to
get a good look?"</P>
<P>Seven’s features darkened. "I am beginning to see my wife’s point," Seven
said.</P>
<P>"I thought you might." Nara shoved Seven into the lift. "Now, you and I have
some work to do." </P>
<P>"I do not think I like the sound of that," Seven said slowly.</P>
<P>"That’s probably because you are a very intelligent woman." She turned to the
comm panel. "Deck six." Nara smirked and leaned against the wall of the lift and
watched the decks flicker past.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"What do you mean ‘take my robe off?’" B’Elanna asked as she glared at Tach.
She was in the orchard standing next to a small hut made with furs and she
didn’t like where the conversation was heading.</P>
<P>"I mean…take off the robe," he said as he pointed at the hut. "But for
goddess sake, do it <I>inside</I> the hut. I don’t need Seven breaking all the
bones in my hand like she did Tom Paris." He went to the hut and flipped back
the hanging fur that worked as a door. "Now, move it before Nara gets here with
Seven. You can’t see her until the ceremony."</P>
<P>B’Elanna grumbled but moved toward the door. "What am I supposed to do once I
go in here and take off my robe?" </P>
<P>"Great goddess above and below…are all Klingons this dense?" Tach pointed
inside the hut. There was a steaming bath filled with rose petals and apple
blossoms and a long cotton robe hanging on the wall of the hut. "You…naked…
bath…robe…Any questions?"</P>
<P>"A ritual bath." B’Elanna nodded her head and then smacked his stomach with
the back of her hand. "Why didn’t you just say so?"</P>
<P>"I thought it was pretty self-explanatory." He shoved her into the hut. "Oh…
you’re supposed to wait in reflective meditation until I come for you," he added
as he flipped the fur door closed.</P>
<P>"Gee thanks," she mumbled and looked around the hut. She dipped her fingers
into the steaming water. "Well, at least the water is nice and hot."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Explain again," Seven ordered as she and Nara climbed off of the turbolift.
Several passing crewmembers watched as she passed, wondering if the Borg
Collective had an affinity for wearing robes.</P>
<P>"First you take the ritual bath, then you put on the sacred robes. You then
have to spend some time in quiet reflection about your feelings for B’Elanna,"
Nara explained.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna does not do quiet reflection," Seven pointed out. "Is Tach
explaining all of this to her?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Nara said, but then paused. "But I’ll check on her as soon as I get
you settled. My husband isn’t known for his ability to explain sacred
rites."</P>
<P>"Why must we do this in the orchard?" Seven asked when they neared the doors
to the new arboretum.</P>
<P>"Well, we’re supposed to do it outdoors with the goddess and her creations
around us. This is the most natural setting on board." Nara stopped in front of
the door. "Let me make sure B’Elanna is in her hut. You two can’t see each other
until the ceremony."</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said slowly. "But do not leave me standing out here too
long. This robe allows an uncomfortable breeze up my legs."</P>
<P>"You’ll live," Nara said with a smirk and she went into the arboretum.</P>
<P>"If my Be’nal finds out that you left me standing out here dressed like this,
you may not," Seven called out as Nara disappeared behind the closing doors.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several minutes later Nara finally had Seven prepared.</P>
<P>"Well?" Tach asked when Nara came out of Seven’s hut. "Did you irritate her
sufficiently?"</P>
<P>"Yes." She tucked her arm under his. "How come I had to piss off the one
who’s capable of bending duranium deck plating?" She led him toward a larger hut
set up at the back of the small orchard.</P>
<P>"Because, my wife, you run faster than I do." Tach opened the flap and
entered the hut. It was large, and had a bath big enough for two. Nara began
undressing as Tach lit the candles around the room and brought a container of
scented soaps to her.</P>
<P>"We’ll give them an hour while we prepare and then I’ll go dress them both."
She climbed into the tub, pausing to dip her fingers into the water and then she
wet her forehead as she said a silently blessing.</P>
<P>Tach stepped into the bath beside her and began lathering her back. She
turned and wet his forehead and he closed his eyes and thanked the goddess.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Quiet contemplation," B’Elanna whispered as she paced the tiny hut. She had
finished bathing and was wearing the cotton robe but she was getting tired of
waiting. She wondered what Seven was doing, then smiled and thought about the
love she had already been blessed to share with her wife. Perhaps the idea of
contemplation wasn’t so bad after all. She closed her eyes and pictured Seven on
Jusari Prime, holding her hand as they walked through the forest and watched the
animals. In some ways she missed the planet and the solitude it provided. Still,
it was good to be back home on <I>Voyager</I>. B’Elanna stopped and her smiled
widened. <I>Voyager</I> truly was a home now that she lived with Seven, and when
the baby arrived, it would be even more special.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Nara folded back the flap. "Ah, you’re ready." She came into the
hut carrying a bundle of clothing. </P>
<P>"How’s Seven?" she asked.</P>
<P>"She is doing fine." Nara smiled. "I need to get you ready for the ceremony,
then I can go dress her as well."</P>
<P>"Do we get to know the meaning behind all of this?" B’Elanna waved her arm
indicating the hut and bath. </P>
<P>"You have been cleansed of all worldly concerns," Nara began. "Which is why
my husband and I tried our best to aggravate you on the way here. You came in
full of outside thoughts. When your thoughts are only of your beloved, the
bonding can take place."</P>
<P>"Well, tell Tach he did a great job." B’Elanna smiled as she studied the
bundle in Nara’s arms. It was a natural fiber, deep green and it looked soft. "I
was about to toss Tach into the tub if he didn’t give me some information."</P>
<P>"Well, he just had his own bath. We just finished our own sacred cleansing."
Nara smiled and unfolded the emerald green fabric. It was a simple dress, and
once it was open, it looked like silk. "Tell me about the first time you knew
you loved Seven." Nara put the dress on a stand nearby.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s face seemed to glow from some internal source. "Well, I wasn’t
exactly thrilled about it at the time." B’Elanna let Nara remove her robe. The
hut was warm from the tub’s steam, but the air was still cool against her bare
skin. She felt goosebumps erupt on her arms and legs. "Seven and I had been on
the planet for a few weeks, and she was really making me angry. Then I looked
over at her as she was stirring the rocks in the fire pit, she didn’t want me to
get cold, and it hit me. I’m falling in love with that irritating woman…
irritating, beautiful, and brilliant…but still, irritating."</P>
<P>"And do you still think she’s irritating?" Nara asked with a smile. She
lifted the silk dress over B’Elanna’s head and smoothed it into place. It was a
good fit, Nara had sewn it the night before, and she had worried that her memory
of B’Elanna’s size might not have been accurate. The rich color complimented
B’Elanna’s coloring and brought out a hint of hazel in her brown eyes.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," B’Elanna said. She had a goofy grin covering her face. "And I
thank Kahless every day that she’s irritating me. I don’t now how I got so
lucky." B’Elanna ran her hands over the fabric. It reminded her of an ancient
Earth kimono except it wasn’t as elaborate. "This is beautiful. Where did you
get it?"</P>
<P>"Well, while you and your wife were up all night... entertaining each other…
I was sewing this." Nara pointed to the dress. "I don’t know if I got Seven’s
right. I swear her belly grows more every second."</P>
<P>"Thank you," B’Elanna said. "I know I was a little grouchy earlier, but we
both appreciate this."</P>
<P>"It is my honor to sponsor you both," Nara said. "Now, I have to go dress
Seven. There’s a hairbrush over there, and some fragrant oils. Go make yourself
beautiful for that wife of yours."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," B’Elanna said with a smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Getting Seven ready took a little more effort. When Nara had gone back to her
hut, Seven had still been in the tub. She was going into her eighth month of the
pregnancy, and was already huge. Nara wondered just how big her belly would get.
She helped Seven out of the tub and dried her, then helped her into her silk
gown. It was the same style as B’Elanna’s but was sapphire blue. The color
accentuated her fair skin and pale eyes.</P>
<P>Nara asked Seven the same questions that she had asked B’Elanna, and was not
surprise when Seven revealed that she had first discovered she was falling in
love B’Elanna several weeks after they arrived on Jusari Prime…late one night
while stirring rocks in the fire pit. </P>
<P>Once Seven was ready, Nara went out into the orchard and spoke with Tach. He
had a small metal fire pit with flames burning down to leave red coals. He
smiled as he saw his wife and hugged her when she came to him.</P>
<P>"Are they ready?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," she answered. She picked up a small container and opened it, carefully
making sure that everything was in its proper place. Satisfied, she put it next
to the fire and went to get Seven while Tach got B’Elanna. They led the two
women out of the huts blindfolded and stood them in front of the fire pit facing
each other.</P>
<P>"As it has always been," Nara said solemnly. "We come to our bonding blind to
the wisdom of the great goddess. She sees our mate long before we ever do. Those
of us who are lucky enough to see through the eyes of true love find the other
half of our soul." She stepped behind B’Elanna as Tach stood behind Seven and
they removed the blindfolds.</P>
<P>"See with the eyes of the goddess," Tach said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven both smiled like children on Christmas morning, both
looking at the greatest gift anyone could ever dream of receiving.</P>
<P>Nara took Seven’s hand and placed it in B’Elanna’s. "Your hearts are bound
already, but it is now time to link your souls."</P>
<P>Tach handed Nara a pair of scissors and she snipped a strand of each woman’s
hair. </P>
<P>"This hair grows like the trees in the forest and the grass in the fields and
it links your souls in the name of the sacred earth. It grows every day, in tiny
amounts that the eye cannot see, but over time it is revealed to all. Let your
love be like that; let each day add to the love you share." She tossed the hair
into a tiny metal bowl that Tach held out. It was only an inch tall, squatty,
and had a blackened finish as if it had been scorched many times. "Do you swear
by the sacred earth to give your soul to your mate?" Nara asked as she gave Tach
the scissors and he put them away and retrieved a tiny knife with a razor-sharp
blade.</P>
<P>"I do," B’Elanna and Seven said in unison.</P>
<P>"Your blood flows with the power of raging rivers and the pounding sea. It
also carries the fire of your soul." Nara took B’Elanna’s and then Seven’s hand
and pricked a finger, collecting a drop of blood in Tach’s bowl. "Do you swear
by the sacred seas and the fire of the goddess to protect each other with all
the passion of these elements?"</P>
<P>"I swear," Seven said. She was looking into B’Elanna’s eyes, seeing all the
love she felt mirrored back to her in her wife’s gaze.</P>
<P>"I do," B’Elanna said. The proud Klingon ignored the tears trailing down her
cheeks. She didn’t want to let go of Seven’s hands even long enough to wipe them
away.</P>
<P>Tach stepped forward and took the knife from Nara and gave her two small
vials.</P>
<P>"Take a deep breath, and as you do, draw in all of the love you feel for each
other," Nara instructed. She handed each woman a vial. "Look into your mate’s
eyes and then release that breath and the air it represents into these
vials."</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven blew into the vials, then smiled at each other as they
waited for Nara to continue.</P>
<P>Nara held up the vials. "Let this represent the sacred element of the air we
breathe and our spirits, also of the air."</P>
<P>Tach took the bowl and placed it on a small table next to the glowing embers.
He took two tiny ingots and put them into the bowl, then added another much
smaller ingot.</P>
<P>"Gold is the sign of purity on many worlds," Nara said. She smiled at
B’Elanna and Seven. "I was happy to see that Earth is one of them. Tach will
melt these pure ingots with the elements from each of you. Your essence will
become part of the metal."</P>
<P>They watched as Tach put the cup on the end of a long metal arm and then
plunged it into the fire pit that served as a kiln. The coals quickly heated the
tiny cup and began melting the ingots.</P>
<P>"We added a smaller ingot for the child you carry," Nara said to Seven. "When
I became pregnant, we renewed our vows and recast our own medallions so that Ty
would have his own. Tach will cast two medallions for each of you. One will be
your bonding necklace and you should wear it forever. The second smaller one you
will wear for your daughter. You will bless it with your love each day that it
lays next to your heart. When your child reaches the age of consent, you will
melt down the smaller necklaces into one. She will wear it as sign to all that
she was born of a sacred bond."</P>
<P>Tach lifted the cup out of the coals and placed it on a stone in front of
B’Elanna and Seven. He carefully positioned four molds next to the cup before
picking up the vials and connecting them to a device similar to a hypospray.</P>
<P>"We’re almost done," Nara whispered with a smile. She cleared her throat.
"Tach will now use your own breath to cool the gold for pouring," she said as
Tach injected the vials of air into the red-hot gold. Tiny bubbles appeared and
then he poured the metal into each of the molds. He filled the larger ones
first, pausing to say a silent blessing before pouring the two smaller ones.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, do you swear by all that is sacred to you that you will give your
heart, soul, spirit and even blood to Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes, gladly," she said as she looked into Seven’s cobalt blue eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven, do you swear by all that is sacred to you that you will give your
heart, soul, spirit and even blood to B’Elanna?" Nara repeated.</P>
<P>"Yes, forever," Seven said.</P>
<P>Nara took a bowl of water and held it out to the couple. "Hold this," she
whispered. Tach took the molds one by one and tapped them on the edge of the
bowl. Each medallion fell into the water with hiss and a flash of steam. Tach
brought over a small case and opened it. It held two golden chains.</P>
<P>"Seven," Tach said as he took the bowl. "Reach in and remove one of each
medallion and put it on a chain.</P>
<P>She reached into the water. She could tell it had been cold, but the heat of
the gold had warmed it. She lifted out two of the pieces, happy when she was
able to grab one of each size on the first try, and threaded them onto the chain
with shaking hands.</P>
<P>"Put this onto your wife," Nara instructed. "You are the only person who can
remove it. It she wants to take it off, only you may unhook this clasp."</P>
<P>Seven put the necklace around B’Elanna’s neck. It took her a moment because
she couldn’t get her shaking hands to work. Finally it latched and she smiled.
"I love you, Be’nal," she whispered as she leaned back.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Nara motioned to the bowl. </P>
<P>B’Elanna repeated the process, but had an easier time with the chain. Her
hands were rock steady, but inside she was trembling. After putting on Seven’s
necklace, she paused to caress her wife’s cheek. "Forever, my wife," she
whispered.</P>
<P>Tach took the bowl of water and poured it onto the coals. It sent up a cloud
of steam with a hiss. He turned to his friends and smiled.</P>
<P>"You are bound," Nara said as she looked at her friends. "You may perform
this ritual for couples you deem worthy. And, if you have another child, you
should repeat it while you are pregnant so that the blood that nourishes the
child will be cast into the medallions."</P>
<P>"Another child?" Seven asked. Her eyes widened and a look of terror covered
her features. "You want me to endure nine additional months of looking like a
shuttle?"</P>
<P>"You are beautiful," B’Elanna insisted. She wrapped her arm around Seven’s
waist. "I think you look very sexy."</P>
<P>"Was I also sexy during my morning sickness?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"How do I answer that?" B’Elanna asked Tach. Her expression revealed that the
Klingon knew that no answer would be the right one.</P>
<P>"You don’t," he said. "You take your wife back to your quarters and celebrate
your bonding in private."</P>
<P>"Smart man," B’Elanna said before tugging Seven toward the exit.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Seven smiled. She happily let her wife lead her out of the
arboretum.</P>
<P>"Very smart man," Nara said as she hugged him. "I knew I married you for a
reason."</P>
