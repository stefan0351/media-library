<P>Seven and B’Elanna spent their fist day as a joined couple locked away in
their quarters, but despite what most on board thought, they didn’t spent all of
their time making love. They used the time to fix up a small area in the living
room to use as a nursery. Even after they had used the rations to repair the
ready room, they had enough left over between them to replicate a crib and some
other furniture for the baby. It was a happy time for them, full of laughter, as
the two women trained as engineers found it almost impossible to put the crib
together. At one point, Seven had threatened to simply assimilate the parts
before she broke into a fit of laughter. After a few hours, the crib was
completed, and they had made love late into the night to celebrate. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The rest of the night was spent curled around each other talking and
laughing. Seven listened while B’Elanna remembered her childhood and the things
that she missed most about the Alpha Quadrant. Seven told B’Elanna what she
could remember about her own youth, but most of that part of her life was lost
to her. It was something that left Seven with a profound sense of loss, but
having B’Elanna’s loving touch helped soothe wounds the former drone had thought
would never heal. She went to sleep knowing that they would.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven shifted her weight and opened her eyes. She was having Braxton Hicks
contractions, false labor pains. She had already been to sickbay twice for the
annoying prelabor spasms and Opaca had explained that they were a normal part of
the birthing process and that the best thing to do was to get a massage or take
a hot shower. Seven didn’t want to wake B’Elanna to rub her back because the
Klingon would have insisted that they go to sickbay, just like she had the first
two times. She smiled as she looked down at B’Elanna. </P>
<P>The Klingon was sound asleep, flat on her back, content to spend the night
acting as Seven’s personal body pillow. With the pregnancy advancing, Seven
found it almost impossible to find a comfortable sleeping position. Using her
wife as pillow helped her sleep through the night. </P>
<P>She leaned onto one elbow and studied B’Elanna. Her head was turned toward
Seven, her mouth was relaxed, and Seven had a perfect view of the tiny mole on
her cheek. It was a small speck, but any time see looked at B’Elanna, she
noticed it. It was one of her favorite things about her wife’s appearance. Seven
loved watching her sleep. It was a time she could stare openly at her beautiful
wife without B’Elanna getting embarrassed. When Seven tried to study her
features while B’Elanna was awake, the Klingon would look away. Years of being
criticized for her appearance had left B’Elanna self-conscious. Seven wished
B’Elanna could see herself like she did, beautiful, elegant, and the
personification of perfection.</P>
<P>Seven climbed out of the bed, instantly missing the warmth of B’Elanna’s
body, but she needed to stretch. Her back was aching and she didn’t want to wake
her wife. She felt another twinge, and sighed. She hated taking a shower alone.
It was so much more enjoyable when B’Elanna joined her. </P>
<P>She climbed into the shower and let the water soothe her aching back. As she
bent her head forward, she saw her necklace and smiled, then picked it up and
studied it. The main medallion was round, with two circles interconnected. The
circle was the Narian symbol for the goddess as well as the representation of
the romantic heart. She turned it over and smiled at the smaller medallion. It
was a perfect triangle, representing her, B’Elanna, and their daughter. It had
the same two interwoven circles but there was a smaller circle inside them. She
hissed as one of the contractions made her twist her back. It was just like
humans to come up with such a useless process. True, the Braxton Hicks
contractions helped to prepare her uterus for the actual birth, but it was
annoying to have so many "dry runs" as Opaca called them.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna opened her eyes, sensing that something wasn’t right. She looked at
the crumpled sheets where her wife should have been and sighed. She assumed she
was in the bathroom, then noticed a small red spot on the sheets.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she called out. She climbed out of bed in a daze and headed toward
the bathroom and opened the door. Steamed rolled out of the room, tumbling in
slow motion. B’Elanna froze in the doorway as she saw her wife sprawled on the
floor next to the shower. Seven’s eyes were open but vacant, and her face was
the color of death. The entire floor was covered in red-black blood.</P>
<P>"No!" B’Elanna screamed as she sat up in bed. She grabbed her chest,
clutching to her bonding necklace as she realized that she had been dreaming.
She looked over at the empty bed beside her and almost panicked. "It was a
dream," she whispered to herself as she headed toward the bathroom. "Stupid
Klingon," she said under her breath before she opened the door. "Seven?" she
called out over the noise of the shower.</P>
<P>There was a pause and then the shower door opened and Seven leaned out.
"Be’nal, why are you up? It is not even 08:00."</P>
<P>"Then what are you doing up?" B’Elanna asked as she climbed into the shower
and hugged her wife. "Umm, you feel good," she said over the pounding water.</P>
<P>"As do you." Seven turned to face her wife. She cringed and squinted her
eyes.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna moved her hand to Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"Nothing," Seven assured her. "It is just another Braxton Hicks
contraction."</P>
<P>"You’re having contractions? Come on, we’re going to sickbay," B’Elanna said
as she shut off the water.</P>
<P>"But… They are stopping…and I wasn’t finished with my shower," Seven
whined.</P>
<P>"Too bad," B’Elanna said, rubbing a large white towel over Seven’s back.
"That’s what you get for not waking me."</P>
<P>B’Elanna escorted Seven to the sickbay, studying her every move during the
turbolift ride. Seven was not amused.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I am fine. There was no reason for us to come to sickbay this
early." Seven had her arms crossed defiantly and she was pouting. Her lower lip
was sticking out and she looked like she had just been sent to her room without
supper.</P>
<P>"You are having contractions." B’Elanna moved closer to her wife and rested
her hand on Seven’s shoulder. "I will not risk anything happening. You aren’t
due for another month. What if you’re having another temporal spike?"</P>
<P>"It isn’t like that," Seven said as she wrapped her arms around B’Elanna’s
shoulders. "Do not worry. This is just like the other false labor pains."</P>
<P>"But what if it isn’t?" B’Elanna sighed and rested her forehead on Seven’s
chest. "I don’t want you or the baby hurt," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said when the lift stopped. "But the next time I tell you
it is nothing, you had better believe me."</P>
<P>"There better not be a next time," B’Elanna said as she led Seven toward the
sickbay. They entered and B’Elanna looked for Opaca. She had called before she
left her quarters, so the hologram was already activated and waiting next to a
biobed.</P>
<P>"Well, good morning," Opaca said as she turned to face them. "Seven, how are
you?"</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven insisted. "Please inform B’Elanna that I am capable of
determining whether or not I am in labor."</P>
<P>Opaca helped Seven onto the biobed. "Actually, the Braxton Hicks contractions
feel identical to real labor contractions, so you can only tell once they’ve
stopped or I’ve confirmed it with a tricorder." Opaca scanned Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"See," B’Elanna said. "I told you we should come down here."</P>
<P>"Well?" Seven asked Opaca.</P>
<P>"You’re fine, Seven. False labor, go home and take a hot shower and get some
rest," Opaca said. She turned toward B’Elanna and pulled her aside as Seven
began climbing off of the biobed. "B’Elanna, are you having nightmares again?
You look awfully worried," she asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Yeah," she said in a whisper. She was embarrassed by the nightmares and the
fact that Opaca had seen through her so easily.</P>
<P>"I see," Opaca said as she scanned B’Elanna. She shook her head and smiled.
"Hold still, I almost forgot something." She went and took a hypospray out of a
medical cabinet.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna asked as she went back to her. "What would it hurt if you
came down each morning and let Opaca check you? Just to be sure?"</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven insisted. "I do not like it here," she added and then let
her eyes drift toward the office where the Doctor was trying to look busy.</P>
<P>Opaca returned and stopped in front of B’Elanna. "Actually, after that last
scan of you, B’Elanna…I think <I>you</I> need to stop by each morning." She
injected B’Elanna’s throat with the hypospray. </P>
<P>B’Elanna flinched and stepped back. "Hey! She’s the one who was having
symptoms." B’Elanna stared at Opaca incredulously.</P>
<P>"What is wrong with her?" Seven demanded as she wrapped her arm around
B’Elanna’s waist.</P>
<P>"It’s about time for B’Elanna to start getting ready for the baby," Opaca
explained. "I just started her hormone series. She’ll need an injection each
morning to get her body ready to nurse when the baby arrives."</P>
<P>"You scared me," Seven accused.</P>
<P>"Yeah?" Opaca stood toe to toe with the much taller former drone. "And what
exactly would you do to get rid of that fear?"</P>
<P>"Anything," Seven said menacingly.</P>
<P>"So, I guess you won’t mind letting me check you once a day to get rid of
your wife’s fear?" Opaca smiled and crossed her arms. She knew she had Seven
cornered.</P>
<P>"That would be acceptable," Seven said. She looked at B’Elanna. "I did not
mean to worry you."</P>
<P>"I know, love. Now, let’s go home." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and kissed her
knuckles.</P>
<P>"Oh, B’Elanna," Opaca called out. "You might notice a little tenderness in
your breasts but it’s nothing to worry about."</P>
<P>"Thanks, I think," B’Elanna said as the doors hissed shut behind them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The next three weeks passed quickly, and with each day B’Elanna and Seven
became more excited. B’Elanna also became more hormonal, caught in the throws of
the daily injections. Seven grew more frustrated as her belly continued to
expand. She swore it was so huge that it would leave warp four point two seconds
before she did.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>As time passed, Seven made certain to include Naomi whenever possible. With
Ty on board and a baby on the way, the former only-child was feeling worried
that she would be replaced in Seven’s heart. Seven and B’Elanna had her spend
the night occasionally, just the three of them. Naomi and B’Elanna had bonded
during these slumber parties and Seven looked forward to the day when their
daughter would be old enough to join them.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The last week before the baby was due, B'Elanna and Seven began their
maternity leave. On the first day of their leave, Seven and B’Elanna went for
breakfast in the mess hall and then spent the afternoon with Naomi and Ty in the
holodeck while Nara and Tach helped the captain go over the star charts. It was
a busy afternoon that left Seven more than a little tired and when they dropped
off the two children, the former Borg was in need of a nap. Surprisingly,
B’Elanna seemed eager for a midday rest as well. Since both women had the day
off, they decided to take advantage of it.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven awoke alone, but that wasn’t unusual. Often, when B’Elanna would join
her for a nap, she would often be well rested after only an hour or two. Seven
needed extra sleep with the pregnancy progressing. Even with an extra hour of
regeneration each morning, Seven seemed to get tired and cranky when she had
been up for several hours. A nap seemed like the best solution. </P>
<P>Seven climbed out of the bed and headed toward the bathroom and the sound of
the pounding water. She smiled, thinking that perhaps she could join her wife
for more than just a shower. They had found the most wonderful uses for the
small shower stall that had nothing to do with getting clean.</P>
<P>As she opened the door, Seven heard a loud moan coming from the shower and
went to investigate. "Lana?" she called out as she opened the shower door. The
Klingon was facing the wall, her forehead resting against the cool tile with the
water beating down on her back.</P>
<P>"I’m going to kill Opaca," B’Elanna said and then moaned even louder. "I
swear to Kahless… I’m going to delete her matrix."</P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven asked, concern making her throat constrict. She stepped
into the water and massaged her wife’s tense shoulders.</P>
<P>"I think I’m dying," B’Elanna whined, still resting her head on the tile.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven squeezed B’Elanna’s shoulders. "Should we call sickbay?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna whined as she turned around. She looked down at her chest. Her
breasts were swelling even more than they had in the past. The artificial
hormones had kicked in, and after three weeks, her mammary glands were working
overtime. "I think my breasts are going to explode," the Klingon warrior
whined.</P>
<P>Seven smirked, relief flooding her features. "Opaca did say there would be
some discomfort." Seven gently examined her wife’s breasts. "I thought you were
having a negative reaction to the injections, but I believe this is normal."</P>
<P>"Ouch." B’Elanna pulled back as Seven tried to lift one breast. "I think this
is a pretty negative reaction." She pointed toward her tender breasts. "This is
before I even have milk. Just how big are these things gonna’ get?"</P>
<P>"You will adapt," Seven said with a smile. She took B’Elanna’s hand, kissed
her knuckles, and then placed the Klingon’s hand on her belly. The baby kicked
and B’Elanna sighed.</P>
<P>"Okay, so I’m being a baby," B’Elanna said as she turned off the water. "But
it hurts," she whined.</P>
<P>Seven guided B’Elanna out of the shower and began drying her with a large
towel from the counter. "Your hormones are undergoing changes as well. It will
make you more irritable," Seven explained gently.</P>
<P>"<I>More</I> irritable? What does that mean?" B’Elanna asked angrily. She
turned and faced her wife and put her hands on her hips defiantly. "Do you think
that I’m irritable?"</P>
<P>Seven stood there not knowing what to say. She suddenly had a great deal of
respect for B’Elanna’s patience. Seven had gone through months of these mood
swings and B’Elanna had seemed able to adapt with ease, always finding the right
thing to say or do.</P>
<P>"You do, don’t you?" B’Elanna asked again. "You think I’m irritable!" Her
eyes shined and her lip trembled and the strong, brave warrior burst into tears
and ran out of the bathroom.</P>
<P>Seven decided that perhaps she should kill Opaca. She heard her wife’s
muffled cries from the other room and quietly went to find her. Seven was still
wet from the shower, and left a trail of water across the carpet.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven asked from the side of the bed. "I did not mean to imply that
you are irritable." She sat next to her wife, trying to remember what B’Elanna
had said to her when she had been hormonal. "Be’nal?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna sniffled. She was on her side, unable to rest on her stomach because
of her aching breasts. "You don’t think I’m irritable?" B’Elanna wiped her eyes
with the sheet.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she rubbed B’Elanna’s back. "You put up with my mood
swings all these months. Could an irritable person do that?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna agreed and sat up. "Oh god," B’Elanna said as she turned to
Seven and scooted over to her. She rested her head on Seven’s shoulder and
hugged her. "What are we gonna’ do if you and I are both hormonal at the same
time, my Be’nal?"</P>
<P>Seven shuddered at that thought. "I hope we never have to find out," she said
sincerely. B’Elanna chuckled and squeezed her a bit closer.</P>
<P>"Well, at least my breasts are getting bigger," B’Elanna said when she
finally eased back.</P>
<P>"I love your breasts exactly how they are. Why would you want them any
bigger?" Seven asked. She couldn’t understand why B’Elanna would want to change
a single thing about her compact body. Every single millimeter was perfection,
perfectly proportional, toned, and incredibly sexy. B’Elanna’s breasts seemed
divinely designed, perfect mounds of tender yet responsive flesh that fit
perfectly in Seven’s hands, and of course her nipples seem tailor made to fill
Seven’s mouth. She wouldn’t change them even if she could.</P>
<P>"Well," B’Elanna said as she stared openly at Seven’s much fuller cleavage.
"Mine are kinda’… small compared to yours."</P>
<P>"Yours are perfect." Seven reached up and cupped B’Elanna’s chin in her
fingers. "We fit perfectly together. Our differences make us the perfect match."
She leaned over and playfully kissed B’Elanna’s nose. "And they filled my hands.
Any more would be wasteful." Seven covered both of B’Elanna’s breasts with her
hands.</P>
<P>B’Elanna inhaled sharply and closed her eyes. "Well, right now, they’re
pretty sore." She tried to relax into her wife’s touch.</P>
<P>"Am I hurting you?" Seven asked as she pulled away.</P>
<P>"Don’t go," B’Elanna whispered. She brought her own hands up to hold Seven’s
soothing touch in place. "Your hands feel nice. I don’t want you to move."</P>
<P>"Then I shall not." Seven cradled the tender mounds in her hands with
incredible care. She leaned forward and kissed B’Elanna’s forehead. "I shall
hold you as long as you need me…although I think it may cause a scene if I have
to accompany you to Engineering or the bridge."</P>
<P>"I’d like to see that," B’Elanna said. She smiled as Seven continued to place
feather-light kisses on the ridges of her forehead.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you should rest some more?" Seven suggested. She eased B’Elanna
toward the bed.</P>
<P>"You’re soaking wet," B’Elanna pointed out. Seven stretched out beside her,
ignoring the water.</P>
<P>Seven shifted her weight until she settled her belly into comfortable
position. "I believe that I have spent many nights in this bed…soaking wet," she
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Very funny." B’Elanna turned over and then scooted her back up against
Seven’s chest. It was a difficult position to pull off with Seven’s huge stomach
in the way, but they managed. Seven brought her hand around in front of B’Elanna
and cradled one breast with infinite tenderness.</P>
<P>"Get some sleep," Seven whispered into B’Elanna’s hair.</P>
<P>"You feel good." B’Elanna covered Seven’s hand with her fingers, not wanting
to her pull away. She yawned. "I love you, Seven," she said as her eyes drifted
shut.</P>
<P>"I love you, my wife," Seven whispered. She snuggled against her and then
joined her beloved in a restful sleep.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven awoke a short while later and watched B’Elanna sleep. The Klingon had
rolled onto her back and her mouth was open, a hint of drool was threatening to
fall from her lips, and her hair was matted to the side of her face. Seven
thought she was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen. She smiled,
content to just watch for the moment, and then B’Elanna’s eyes opened.</P>
<P>"Do you watch me sleep often?" B’Elanna asked as she rolled onto her
side.</P>
<P>Seven blushed.</P>
<P>"I watch you too," B’Elanna admitted. She reached out and tucked a stray
strand of hair behind Seven’s ear. "You look so relaxed when you sleep."
B’Elanna smiled and traced her wife’s lips with her fingers. "Sometimes when
you’re really tired, you stick just the tip of your tongue out. It’s always
right in the middle."</P>
<P>Seven frowned, not liking the sound of that and then nipped her wife’s
fingers.</P>
<P>"It’s adorable," B’Elanna assured her.</P>
<P>"Do you still hurt?" Seven reached out and rubbed B’Elanna’s chest.</P>
<P>"Not as much. Sorry I was so emotional earlier." She lifted Seven’s hand and
kissed her palm. "You were really great."</P>
<P>"I love you," Seven said as if that explained everything, and perhaps it
did.</P>
<P>"Shall we get up?" B’Elanna asked. "Maybe have a late lunch?"</P>
<P>"More like an early dinner," Seven said as she checked the clock. "I’ll cook.
You rest on the couch."</P>
<P>"That sounds nice." B’Elanna stood and came around the bed and helped Seven
sit up, then pulled her to her feet. "You sure you feel up it?"</P>
<P>"I am used to these hormones," Seven pointed out as she found a loose fitting
dress to put on. She dug through the closet until she found another loose dress
and handed it to B’Elanna. "Put this on," she ordered.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so." B’Elanna scrunched up her face at the plain blue
sundress. </P>
<P>"Anything tight on your breasts will be uncomfortable." Seven tilted her head
to one side as B’Elanna shook her head and continued scrunching her face. "Are
you sure?" Seven asked skeptically.</P>
<P>"Yep," B’Elanna said. She went to her dresser and retrieved a pair of
sweatpants and an oversized tee shirt. "See? Nice and loose," she said after she
lowered the shirt over her head. "Now, where’s my dinner, woman?" she asked
playfully.</P>
<P>"Go wait on the couch. I will prepare it, wife." Seven swatted B’Elanna on
the behind.</P>
<P>Ten minutes later B’Elanna was stretched out on the couch feeling quite
spoiled. Her pregnant wife had almost finished replicating her something that
smelled wonderful, she had a cold glass of apple cider in her hand and her feet
were perched on the arm of the couch.</P>
<P>The door chime sounded and B’Elanna started to stand.</P>
<P>"Stay," Seven ordered as she came out of the small kitchenette. She opened
the door and was surprised to see Ty standing in the corridor alone…alone and
completely naked with his face and chest covered in chocolate.</P>
<P>"Evan!" He beamed happily, holding out his chocolate covered hands.</P>
<P>"Tyralanar, where are your parents?" Seven asked as she knelt next to him.
"And where are your clothes?" She picked up the naked bundle and settled him
onto her hip as she looked up and down the empty corridor.</P>
<P>"Ty?" B’Elanna sat up and stared at the messy bundle in her wife’s arms.</P>
<P>"Ba! My Ba!" He squirmed until Seven put him down and then he sprinted to the
Klingon.</P>
<P>"This is most unusual." Seven went to the closet to retrieve some clothing
for Ty. She and B’Elanna kept some of his outfits in their closet because they
kept him on many nights when they didn’t have duty the next day. It gave his
parents a chance to be alone and she and B’Elanna loved having him. "How did he
get here?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Isn’t it your nap time?" B’Elanna asked. She lifted him onto her lap. "And
what happened to your clothes, little tiger?"</P>
<P>"Clothes off," he informed her and grabbed for her cider. She helped him take
a gulp and then put the glass back on the coffee table.</P>
<P>"That much I can see for myself," B’Elanna told him. "Where are you
parents?"</P>
<P>"Ty fix the door," he said proudly.</P>
<P>"I think we need to check the security locks on our door as well," B’Elanna
said. "If he figured out theirs, he’ll figure out ours." B’Elanna looked up at
Seven who had brought the clothes over along with a wet washcloth.</P>
<P>"Evan’s baby." Ty pointed to her belly.</P>
<P>"And Ba’s baby too," Seven said as she picked him up.</P>
<P>"I should call Tach and let him know the little rascal is here." B’Elanna
stood. She looked at Seven trying to wash Ty’s face. He was making a game of
avoiding the washcloth. "Seven, I think you might as well just give him a bath."
She shook her head and smiled. Ty avoided the cloth like a Da’har master
avoiding a bat’tleth strike.</P>
<P>"Bath!" Ty yelled and bounced on Seven’s hip.</P>
<P>"Perhaps that would be best." Seven looked down at her chocolate covered
dress. She carried him into the bathroom while B’Elanna went to the nearest
console.</P>
<P>B’Elanna tapped the console. "Torres to Tach," she said as she waited for the
image to appear on screen. She waited another moment, listening to the water
filling the tub in the bathroom. Ty was squealing, obviously having a wonderful
time after his naked adventure through the corridor. Tach had made arrangements
to swap Quarters with Ensign Miller and Enzati who had shared a room on one side
of B’Elanna’s quarters. The Narians wanted to be close B’Elanna and Seven. The
two ensigns had jumped at the chance because it meant they would get to share a
larger doubles quarters in the VIP area. <I>Voyager</I> was running out of
places to put its growing crew.</P>
<P>"Tyralanar, this water is to clean you, not to be used as a projectile,"
Seven said over the sound of the filling tub.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and tapped the console. "Torres to Tach," she said
again.</P><I>
<P>*"What?"*</I> Tach said over the console. There was no image because the
privacy code was in place.</P>
<P>"Tach," B’Elanna asked sweetly. "What are you doing?"</P><I>
<P>*"I was in the shower,"*</I> he said impatiently.</P>
<P>"And what is Nara doing?" B’Elanna asked with an evil grin.</P><I>
<P>*"She was in the shower with me,"*</I> he said pointedly. Obviously they had
been doing more than getting clean.</P>
<P>"And what is Ty doing?" B’Elanna asked sweetly, pushing her luck.</P><I>
<P>*"He’s taking a nap,"*</I> Tach said. He was breathing heavily.
<I>*"Why?"*</P></I>
<P>"I don’t think he is," B’Elanna said as her smile widened. "I think he’s
enjoying his own naked time."</P><I>
<P>*"What are you talking about?"*</I> His voice drifted off as he walked away
from the console in his quarters. <I>*"Tyralanar!"*</I> he yelled. B’Elanna
heard his footsteps as he jogged back to the console. <I>*"He’s gone. Ty’s gone.
Do you know where he is?"*</P></I>
<P>"Well, right now, my wife is giving him a bath," B’Elanna said.</P><I>
<P>*"I’ll be right there,"*</I> he said and then the console channel closed.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and went to the bathroom door and looked in on Ty. He was in
heaven, and who could blame him. He had a gorgeous blonde Borg tending to his
every need. Seven was kneeling next to the tub handing him each toy as he would
launch it across the small room. It was his version of fetch, with Seven filling
the role of the pet targh.</P>
<P>"I spoke with Tach," B’Elanna said as she watched her wife with Ty. She
smiled, feeling her heart fill until it threatened to burst. She imagined Seven
with their daughter and it was almost too much. "He’s on his way over."</P>
<P>"Fa?" Ty looked up from drowning a rubber ducky. Harry Kim had given it him.
Nara thought it was the ugliest thing she had every seen, so Seven offered to
keep it for Ty. It was one of his favorite bath toys.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said. "Your Fa is on his way over and he didn’t sound very
happy."</P>
<P>"Ty fix Fa’s door," he informed her once again.</P>
<P>"I’ll just bet you did," B’Elanna said. She wondered how many repair teams it
would take to "unfix" the door. "I think Ty’s little adventure interrupted
something," she added with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Lana…" Seven rinsed Ty’s hair. "Why don’t we keep him? Let them have some
alone time without worrying about Ty <I>fixing</I> anything else?"</P>
<P>"Sure," B’Elanna said as the door chime sounded. She went to the door and
opened it. Tach was in a robe, still dripping wet. "Well, hello Fas’fa," she
said with a laugh. Tach’s hair was dripping shampoo down one side and he didn’t
look pleased. "How’s my big brother?" B’Elanna asked with a wicked smile.</P>
<P>"I am about to spank your nephew," Tach said as he came into her quarters.
"He dismantled the replicator <I>again</I>, and managed to open the door locking
mechanism. All in less than ten minutes while we were in the shower."</P>
<P>"Go back home and relax. Seven and I will keep him for the night." B’Elanna
pushed him back out the door.</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" he asked. </P>
<P>"Yes, now go home and have a nice night with your wife." B’Elanna sighed and
shook her head. "If he’s doing this much damage and he’s not even a year and a
half old…just think what he’s gonna’ be doing in another year or two."</P>
<P>"Great goddess above and below," he said. "I’m never going to survive
this."</P>
<P>"Poor thing." B’Elanna laughed. </P>
<P>"Just wait, that child of yours will be even worse," Tach said, pausing in
the corridor.</P>
<P>"Not a chance," B’Elanna said. "With Seven and I as her mothers, she’s going
to be a perfect little angel who won’t even know how to get into trouble. I
guarantee it."</P>
<P>Tach burst out laughing as he walked away and continued howling with laughter
even as he went into his quarters.</P>
<P>"It wasn’t <I>that</I> funny," B’Elanna said as she stared down the empty
corridor.</P>

<P>Seven woke up when she heard the faint sound of metal on metal. Her eyes shot
open and she climbed quickly out of bed and made her way into the living room.
The lights were on and Ty was sitting with a pile of data padds using them as
building blocks.</P>
<P>"Ty, you should be sleeping," she said as she scooped him up into her arms.
She carried him back to his sleeper and settled him down under the blankets.
</P>
<P>"Evan zing." He rubbed his eyes. "Hold Ty." He lifted his arms to her and his
lip quivered.</P>
<P>"All right," she said with a sweet smile. She lifted him up she went to the
couch and sat down, cradling him in her lap. "But no singing," she whispered.
"We don’t want to wake your Nana B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"My Ba," he said as he rested his head on her shoulder and rubbed the soft
fabric of her deep blue nightgown.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," Seven whispered and kissed his head. She hummed softly.</P>
<P>She looked over at the clock. It was almost time for the morning watch to
start, but Seven and B’Elanna both had plenty of time now that their maternity
leave had begun, which was why Seven had offered to keep Ty. She figured he
would get into less trouble if his parents had some time alone. Perhaps they
would be less angry given time to deal with the <I>fixed</I> replicator. Opaca
had suggested that Seven and B’Elanna take at least a week to get everything
ready for the baby, and had B’Elanna insisted that they follow her orders to the
letter. </P>
<P>Seven waited until Ty’s breathing evened out and then carried him to his
sleeper. She made sure he was covered, then stood to go back to bed. "Not
again," she whispered as she felt the Braxton Hicks contractions begin again.
She had been to sickbay two more times in the last three weeks. She didn’t want
to wake B’Elanna, so she went directly to the shower and let the water wash away
some of the tension. Forty-five minutes later her back was aching even more so
she decided to try going back to bed.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked as the former Borg climbed into bed. "Ya’ okay?"
B’Elanna mumbled. She crawled over and draped her arm over Seven’s waist and
kissed her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Fine." Seven rolled over. "Rub my back," she asked.</P>
<P>"Umm," B’Elanna said and then yawned. "Sure, love." Her hands moved down and
worked the muscles gently. Even though B’Elanna was only half awake, her touch
was tender and she immediately found the muscles that seemed to need her touch.
"You’re tied in knots," B’Elanna said as she began waking up. </P>
<P>"False labor." Seven felt her body relaxing.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna sat up, fully awake.</P>
<P>"It’s nothing." Seven pulled her pillow over her head. "I am tired. Let me
sleep."</P>
<P>"Come on, we’re getting up," B’Elanna said as she lifted the pillow away from
her wife’s head.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whined. "We can go to sickbay in a few hours."</P>
<P>"Seven, we need to get you checked." B’Elanna sat next to her wife and
brushed the hair off of her face. "Come on."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I am not in labor," Seven insisted. "I am tired of going to
sickbay every time I have some minor contractions."</P>
<P>"You can come back here and sleep as late as you want. I’ll even bring you
breakfast in bed," B’Elanna said as she helped Seven stand.</P>
<P>"I am not in labor," Seven said angrily, then another contraction made her
wince. "Damn it," she said. "I would know if I was in labor."</P>
<P>"And just how often do you use profanity?" B’Elanna asked. "This is worse
than the other times. Come on, let’s go."</P>
<P>"We cannot go." Seven pulled B’Elanna to a stop. "We have to watch Ty."</P>
<P>"Why are you so stubborn?" B’Elanna asked. "If it is false labor, we’ll just
come right back home."</P>
<P>"I am not in labor," Seven insisted again. Her eyes widened and she looked
down just as a splash of clear liquid covered her feet. She looked at B’Elanna,
shocked.</P>
<P>"Well, since you’re <I>not</I> in labor," B’Elanna yelled. "That would be
your water <I>not</I> breaking." The Klingon was heading toward panic at warp
ten.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven whispered, her voice full of fear.</P>
<P>"Oh, god, Be’nal… I’m sorry." She wrapped her arms around Seven. "Let’s get
you to sickbay. I’ll grab Ty and bring him with us."</P>
<P>"I do not know if I can walk," Seven said as she lowered herself to the bed,
gritting her teeth.</P>
<P>"Oh no, you can walk. You are not having this baby in our quarters. Do you
hear me?" B’Elanna began pacing, her heart racing, then she finally ran to the
console. "Torres to Opaca… medical emergency in my quarters."</P><I>
<P>*"Lieutenant, what is it?"*</I> the Doctor asked over the comm system.</P>
<P>"I need Opaca and I need her now," B’Elanna said. "Seven’s in labor and she
can’t walk. Now you send that damn hologram down here right now," she ordered as
she ran her hands through her hair. It was down and she tucked it behind her
ears and she bit her lip.</P><I>
<P>*"B’Elanna,"*</I> Opaca said over the comm. *<I>"We’ll beam her to
sickbay."*</P></I>
<P>"Wait," B’Elanna yelled. She sprinted to the other room and snatched up Ty
and ran back to Seven. "Three to beam to sickbay," she said as she knelt next to
Seven. The former drone was breathing in deep gulps and holding her belly.</P>
<P>They materialized in sickbay. Seven ended up sitting on the floor, with
B’Elanna at her side holding Ty who was rubbing his eyes and yawning.</P>
<P>"Ba?" Ty yawned again.</P>
<P>"Shh, honey. It’s okay." B’Elanna stood and looked at Opaca. The hologram was
walking toward her, but she wasn’t moving fast enough for the protective
Klingon. "Come on! There’s a baby coming out here."</P>
<P>"Calm down." Opaca came closer. "This is a natural process." She scanned
Seven and smiled. "Well, it looks like the little one is about to make her grand
entrance."</P>
<P>"She is already in," Seven snapped. "I want her to make an exit… Now." Her
eyes widened even more and she groaned.</P>
<P>"Do something," B’Elanna yelled. "I don’t want my daughter just squirting out
onto the damn floor!"</P>
<P>"Just breathe," Opaca said as she knelt next to Seven. "The contraction will
pass, and then we can move you to the delivery table."</P>
<P>The Doctor stepped out of his office but paused, then cleared his throat.
"Lieutenant, I could take Ty…and call his parents," he offered.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she handed Ty to the Doctor. She rushed back to
Seven even as Ty began to fuss.</P>
<P>"Lana." Seven reached out and grabbed her wife’s hand. "This child is coming
out…right now."</P>
<P>"Do something!" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>Opaca sighed. "It’s not coming out just yet. Keep breathing."</P>
<P>"I am breathing!" Seven yelled.</P>
<P>"She is breathing!" B’Elanna yelled a split second later.</P>
<P>Ty looked at his two aunts and began crying at the top of his lungs. The
Doctor held him away from his body, not knowing what to do. </P>
<P>"It’s all right," the Doctor said in his most soothing voice.</P>
<P>"Bad man hurt Evan!" Ty screamed as he tried to squirm away from the
Doctor.</P>
<P>"I am a hologram," the Doctor whined. "And a very nice one at that… and I
didn’t do this to her."</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty howled and tears streamed down his cheeks.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna!" Seven cried out as the contraction increased.</P>
<P>The Klingon turned her head back and forth between her two screaming family
members like a spectator at a tennis match. She finally decided that Ty would
just have to deal with the Doctor. "I’m right here, Seven," she said as she
squeezed her wife’s hand.</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty began kicking at the Doctor.</P>
<P>Opaca rolled her eyes and went to the Doctor and snatched Ty.</P>
<P>"Where are you going?" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>"Everyone just calm down." Opaca carried Ty back to B’Elanna and sat him next
to her on the floor. </P>
<P>"Ba," he whispered as he leaped onto her chest and whimpered. He reached out
and touched Seven’s hand. "Evan hurt."</P>
<P>"Shh, Seven’s fine," B’Elanna said and kissed his head.</P>
<P>"Seven is not fine!" The former Borg gave her wife a deadly glare, then her
expression relaxed. She took a deep breath and sighed. "Is it over?" she asked
Opaca.</P>
<P>"No," Opaca said. "That was just one of many contractions."</P>
<P>"Many?" Seven demanded. "How many?"</P>
<P>"Let’s get you onto the delivery table," Opaca said. She knelt beside Seven
who was looking at her like she was insane.</P>
<P>"You expect me to move?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"She can’t move," B’Elanna said. "My kid’s gonna’ come shooting out of there
and go bouncing across the floor."</P>
<P>"Oh, for the love of the prophets," Opaca said. She scooped Seven up and
carried her to the table. Seven’s eyes widened, and then she realized that
despite her size, Opaca was as powerful as she chose to be. Her holographic
matrix could be instantly adjusted.</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Seven looked to her one time mentor. "Is it safe to move me?" she
asked as Opaca was settling her onto the table.</P>
<P>"Of course, Seven," he said with a smile, happy that she was speaking to
him.</P>
<P>"Evan sick," Ty said as B’Elanna moved next to the table.</P>
<P>"Could someone please get Tach and Nara down here?" B’Elanna took Seven’s
hand.</P>
<P>"Of course." The Doctor rushed into his office.</P>
<P>"All right," Opaca said. "Let’s see what’s going on with you." She pressed a
button and the table began tilting until Seven’s back was at a forty-five degree
angle. Opaca knelt in front of her and guided her feet to the stirrups. "Oh my
goodness," Opaca said. </P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna and Seven asked in unison.</P>
<P>"Relax," Opaca told them as she shook her head. "It won’t be much longer at
all. Seven is dilated to ten centimeters."</P>
<P>"Is that good?" B’Elanna asked. She tried to see what the hologram was
looking at. Ty squirmed in her arms and Seven had her wrist in a death grip.</P>
<P>"It’s very good. Ten centimeters is fully dilated. She can have the baby any
time now," Opaca explained. She scanned Seven’s belly. </P>
<P>"What do you mean ten centimeters if fully dilated?" Seven demanded. "How is
our child going to fit out of an opening ten centimeters?" Seven struggled to
lean forward. "You told us last week that our daughter would be at least seven
and a half pounds. She will not fit."</P>
<P>"She’ll fit," Opaca assured her. She checked her readings and smiled. "The
baby has turned and is in perfect position. She’ll be with us any time now."</P>
<P>"Can’t you beam her out?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>Opaca stared at Seven for a moment and then sighed. "No. You will do just
fine."</P>
<P>"You are not the one trying to pass a seven and a half pound child through a
ten centimeter opening," Seven whined.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna said as she caressed Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"But I am here," Seven said, pointing at the table. "And the baby is coming
out…of…down there!" She pointed to her waist. "I did not adequately research
this. I have changed my mind. You have the child."</P>
<P>"It’s a little late for that," Opaca said. "Uh oh…" She looked at her
tricorder.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven and B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"You’re about to start another…" Opaca began.</P>
<P>"Oh, my god!" Seven yelled as she squeezed B’Elanna’s hand.</P>
<P>"…contraction," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"Evan!" Ty began to cry.</P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna screamed as her hand was being squeezed tightly.</P>
<P>The doors to sickbay hissed open and a sleepy Nara wandered in with Tach at
her side. Tach yawned and took in the unfolding scene.</P>
<P>"Well, good morning," Tach said happily.</P>
<P>"Fa!" Ty yelled at the top of his lungs. "Evan sick!"</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said, trying to hold onto Ty as he squirmed. "Let go of my
hand."</P>
<P>"You are not going anywhere," Seven said through clenched teeth, but she did
loosen her grip. "You got me into this. You are staying right here."</P>
<P>Nara laughed and she went to B’Elanna and took Ty.</P>
<P>"This is not funny," B’Elanna said to Nara and then growled.</P>
<P>"Oh, yes it is," Nara said. She bent down and lifted Seven’s nightgown. "Oh
dear. Won’t be much longer now."</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna slapped Nara’s hand away.</P>
<P>"Every one who is not married to Seven…out," Opaca commanded.</P>
<P>Nara hugged Ty to her chest and rubbed his back. He had stopped crying. "But
we want to see the baby born," she whined.</P>
<P>"Out," Opaca ordered. "When I get these two settled down, maybe you can come
back in." She turned back to Seven. "Take deep breaths."</P>
<P>"You take deep breaths." Seven grunted as she gave Opaca an icy glare.</P>
<P>"Out," Opaca ordered. </P>
<P>"Come on," Tach said as he guided Nara out of the room. "We’ll wait right
outside and she can call us as soon as it’s okay."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Opaca said gently. "Stand behind her and help her lean forward.
She’s going to need to start pushing soon."</P>
<P>"I am already pushing," Seven said. "I have no choice. This damn human body
is pushing of its own accord."</P>
<P>B’Elanna moved behind Seven and gently wrapped her arm around her waist and
leaned her forward. "Okay, Be’nal. We can get through this."</P>
<P>Seven spun her head toward B’Elanna. "We?"</P>
<P>"Yes, we." B’Elanna leaned into Seven and bumped her forehead against her
wife’s. "You may be having our daughter, but I am here with you…and I will be
here no matter what."</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and nodded. She took deep breaths as the contraction
ended. "Okay," she whispered and she relaxed.</P>
<P>"It’s just like the Lamaze simulator," B’Elanna said as she rubbed Seven’s
shoulders. They had spent hours in the holodeck practicing so that Seven would
know how to breathe properly. </P>
<P>"It is nothing like the simulator." Seven glared at B’Elanna. "That training
exercise was inadequate." She glared at Opaca. "You sent us to a useless program
that did nothing to prepare us."</P>
<P>"Just breathe and you’ll get through this, Seven," Opaca said as she shook
her head.</P>
<P>"This Lamaze is a human delusional construct. It was created to fool
prospective mothers into believing birth is tolerable," Seven stated. She was
panting and leaning against B’Elanna. "It is all your fault, B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Me?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"You got me pregnant," Seven accused.</P>
<P>"But…" B’Elanna looked back and forth between Seven and Opaca. "I
didn’t…you…"</P>
<P>"Don’t argue with a woman in labor," Opaca advised.</P>
<P>"You’re right, Seven," B’Elanna said. "It is my fault."</P>
<P>"It was my Borg technology that allowed the pregnancy," Seven snapped. </P>
<P>"Well, I…" B’Elanna stammered.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I love you," Seven said when the contraction ended. She smiled at
her wife. Her hormones were taking one last shot at the former drone’s
emotions.</P>
<P>"I love you too," B’Elanna said. She caressed Seven’s cheek wondering when
the next mood swing would hit.</P>
<P>"Well," Opaca said as she scanned Seven again. "This little one is in a
hurry. She is positioned at the top of the birthing canal and we should be
seeing her after a few more contractions."</P>
<P>"Can you give her something for the pain?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes are working overtime right now," Opaca said. "They’re sending
her extra endorphins as we speak. I think we should avoid adding anything else
to the mix if you can handle it, Seven."</P>
<P>"Will the drugs harm the baby?" Seven asked. She was breathing evenly and
seemed much calmer now that Ty wasn’t in the room crying.</P>
<P>"Normally, I’d say no," Opaca explained. "But your physiology is unique. I
can’t be sure."</P>
<P>"No drugs," Seven said. "I can tolerate the discomfort. It is much less that
when the temporal spike occurred."</P>
<P>"Thank Kahless," B’Elanna said as she leaned over and kissed Seven’s temple.
"What can I do?"</P>
<P>"You are doing it," Seven said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna wiped the moisture from Seven’s forehead. Her nanoprobes were
occupied and weren’t bothering with her sweat glands.</P>
<P>The doors to sickbay opened and Ensign Samantha Wildman entered. She hurried
in, reaching up to tuck her hair behind her ears. "Opaca, I got here as fast as
I could," she said. "Seven, how are you feeling?" </P>
<P>"She’s doing well, Ensign," Opaca said. "Now, I need you to monitor the fetal
heart rate while B’Elanna changes into a sterile gown. You can help me get Seven
changed."</P>
<P>"Of course," Samantha said as she moved to the table. "Hi Seven. Naomi’s
outside. I told her it was time."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said. "I appreciate your willingness to assist in this
matter." She shifted her weight and rubbed her back.</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna said. "Thanks. We didn’t really want Tom helping out…if you
know what I mean, and you’ve got training as a medic...plus…well…you have had a
baby."</P>
<P>"I’m glad to help," Samantha said. "I’ve been working with Opaca in the
holodeck practicing with birth simulations." She grabbed a gown out of the
cabinet and quickly changed into it and put on gloves before handing a sterile
set to B’Elanna. "Here," she said, glancing at B’Elanna’s floor length
nightgown.</P>
<P>"Oh, thanks," B’Elanna said. She didn’t quite know why she needed a medical
gown, but it was better than wearing her nightgown, especially if they had any
more visitors. She changed quickly as Opaca and Samantha helped get Seven out of
her sleepwear and into a sterile gown.</P>
<P>"The baby’s doing fine, Seven." Samantha watched the tricorder, smiling at
the readings. "Her heart rate is perfect and she’s in position. Do you have a
name picked out yet?"</P>
<P>"Actually," B’Elanna said as she went back to Seven’s side. "It’s considered
bad luck to mention the child’s name before it’s born."</P>
<P>"It’s part of a Klingon myth," Opaca said as she checked Seven again,
pressing her hand on her belly to feel the baby’s position. "If you say the
child’s name, they will come out, and could be born before their time."</P>
<P>"Perhaps we should call her." Seven sighed.</P>
<P>"Pressure’s rising," Samantha said as she monitored the readings. "There’s a
contraction coming."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven said when the contraction hit. It was stronger than the
others had been. "Oh," she screamed and grabbed the table with her Borg enhanced
hand. She crushed the metal as she panted.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna said, rubbing Seven’s back.</P>
<P>"You need to push," Opaca said patiently.</P>
<P>"Ahh," Seven cried. "I am pushing." Sweat beaded on her forehead and B’Elanna
held onto her as the contraction continued.</P>
<P>"The baby’s shifting," Samantha said. "She turned."</P>
<P>"It’s okay," Opaca said, her hands still on Seven’s belly. "Some movement is
normal, especially with Klingons."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres, make your child stop moving," Seven said as the baby
twisted inside.</P>
<P>"She’s back where she started," Samantha said. She moved the tricorder closer
and smiled. "The contraction’s almost over."</P>
<P>"Easy," Opaca said. "Keep pushing…nice and steady."</P>
<P>"I am," Seven whined. "Ahh," she collapsed against B’Elanna as the
contraction stopped. "Be’nal," she whispered.</P>
<P>"I’m here." B’Elanna turned to Opaca. "What’s taking so long?"</P>
<P>"Labor usually takes hours." Opaca gently pressed Seven’s belly. "As it is,
Seven is progressing nicely."</P>
<P>"Hours?" Seven asked. She looked at B’Elanna, her eyes pleading. "I am
exhausted. I cannot do this for hours."</P>
<P>"You’re doing great," Samantha said. "It took me three hours of hard labor to
get this far along."</P>
<P>"How much longer?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Not long," Opaca said.</P>
<P>The Doctor stepped out of his office. "Do you need anything?" he asked
carefully from the doorway.</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked at Seven and raised her eyebrows.</P>
<P>"Not at the moment," Seven said to him. "But when the baby comes, we may need
your assistance," she said.</P>
<P>"I’ll be waiting in my office," he said cheerfully. "Just say the word."</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"It’s my pleasure," he said sincerely. He paused, looking at the scene and
then turned and went to his office. He sat at his desk, not knowing what to do.
He considered sending an announcement about Seven’s labor over the command
system but decided that he didn’t want to push his luck. Seven was Opaca’s
patient and he wasn’t going to do anything to anger the former drone, not when
she seemed to be letting him back into her life.</P>
<P>"I need to reposition the table." Opaca began tilting the table even further
until Seven was sitting completely upright.</P>
<P>"Won’t the baby fall onto the floor?" B’Elanna looked at the way the table
now resembled a chair with a giant hole in the seat.</P>
<P>"That’s what we’re here for," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"We’re?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said with a smile. "You are going to bring your daughter into
this world."</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked. The Klingon’s face paled. "I thought you were gonna’
do it…What about Samantha? She’s a mother…she knows about babies."</P>
<P>"Who do you want the first person to hold your child to be?" Opaca asked. "A
hologram, Samantha…or her mother?"</P>
<P>"Please, Be’nal," Seven asked. "I know you can do it."</P>
<P>"I’ll do everything right up until you step in and catch her," Opaca
promised.</P>
<P>"But…" B’Elanna looked at Seven.</P>
<P>"Come here." Opaca held out her hand to the frightened Klingon. B’Elanna took
her hand and moved down between Seven’s legs. </P>
<P>"Oh, sweet Kahless," B’Elanna said as she saw how dilated Seven was.</P>
<P>"Shh," Opaca said as she poked B’Elanna. "You’ll make her nervous. She looks
perfectly normal."</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded. </P>
<P>"Now," Opaca said gently. "When the baby crowns, we’ll see the top of her
head coming out. We’ll need to keep gentle pressure on her head so that she
doesn’t come out too fast, otherwise Seven might tear."</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked at Seven and then Opaca, and then her eyes rolled back in her
head and she collapsed toward the floor face first. Samantha grabbed the
Klingon’s arm as she went down. </P>
<P>"Oh dear," Opaca said with a frown. "Doctor, we need you." She looked down at
the unconscious Klingon and shook her head.</P>
<P>"What did you do to her?" Seven demanded. She leaned over to get a better
look at her wife. "Is she injured?"</P>
<P>"Just her pride," Opaca said with a smirk. "Uh oh, here comes another
contraction."</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway came out of her ready room and took her place on the bridge.
</P>
<P>"Good morning," Chakotay said as she sat.</P>
<P>"Commander," she said with a smile. "Anything exciting to report?"</P>
<P>"Smooth sailing." He leaned back into his chair. "We can do that overhaul of
the warp coils we’ve been putting off."</P>
<P>"I think B’Elanna planned her maternity leave with just that in mind,"
Janeway said with a smirk.</P>
<P>"She and Seven are probably both sleeping in while Vorik is dealing with the
overhaul." Chakotay shook his head. "Some people have all the luck."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Samantha settled B’Elanna onto her back. "Should I give her a stimulant?"</P>
<P>"No," Opaca said. "She’s fine. She just fainted. No need to mess up her
chemistry." Opaca smiled at Samantha. "A screaming Borg, and fainting Klingon,
and this is still smoother than your delivery."</P>
<P>Samantha nodded, amazed that the hologram was so knowledgeable about Naomi’s
birth.</P>
<P>"Wake her up," Seven yelled. The contraction was the most painful yet.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Samantha said forcefully. "Lieutenant Torres, wake up."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes fluttered and she groaned.</P>
<P>"Come on," Samantha said gently. She started lifting B’Elanna from the floor.
</P>
<P>The Doctor came out of his office, then saw B’Elanna on the floor and rushed
to her. </P>
<P>He knelt next to the ensign. "Fainted?" he asked Samantha.</P>
<P>"Yep," she said with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Wake her up," Seven said through clenched teeth. She panted as the
contraction gripped her.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna eyes opened.</P>
<P>"Welcome back, Lieutenant," the Doctor said smugly. "Your wife is doing all
the work while you are taking a nap."</P>
<P>"Seven," she said again as she struggled to her feet. The Doctor guided her
to the bed, ready to catch her if she fainted again.</P>
<P>"She turned again," Samantha said as she scanned Seven’s belly. "It looks
like her shoulder is stuck."</P>
<P>"Do something," Seven ordered B’Elanna. "Make your child move."</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked back and forth between Opaca and the Doctor.</P>
<P>Opaca sighed. "Doctor, you monitor the baby. Ensign, you help Seven push, and
B’Elanna, you get back down here and catch your daughter…and I forbid you to
faint."</P>
<P>"Klingons do not faint," B’Elanna muttered as she did what she was told.</P>
<P>"Well, this one does." Opaca yanked B’Elanna into position.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at her wife, too far to touch, then over at Samantha, who
she liked, but didn’t feel close a connection with like she did with others.</P>
<P>"I want Nara," Seven said to Samantha and then groaned as she bared down
against the contraction.</P>
<P>"Okay, I’ll get her," she said as she jogged out to the corridor.</P>
<P>"The shoulder is pressing on the pelvis," the Doctor said grimly.</P>
<P>"What does that mean?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Right now, it’s fine," Opaca assured her. "We’ll see if she turns on her
own, if not, I’ll turn her."</P>
<P>B’Elanna rubbed Seven’s leg, trying to offer support. Nara rushed in with
Samantha and went to Seven’s side.</P>
<P>"I thought I was going to miss the big event," Nara said, taking Seven’s
hand.</P>
<P>"I wish I were missing it." Seven panted as the contraction ended.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry, love." B’Elanna squeezed Seven’s knee, guilt filling her
heart.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at her wife, seeing fear and concern, and shook her head.
"I am not sorry that I am here, Be’nal. I am just…uncomfortable. I love
you."</P>
<P>"I love you," B’Elanna said with a smile.</P>
<P>"Yes, everyone loves everyone," the Doctor said. "Now can we get back to
having this child," he said.</P>
<P>Seven glared at him, then let her eyes drift to the office where he had been
exiled.</P>
<P>"I…I’m sorry. Please, continue the lovefest. Seven, B’Elanna…I love you
both," he said stiffly. His eyes widened. "The child isn’t shifting."</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven groaned and Nara helped her lean forward while Samantha went
around the table to help from the other side.</P>
<P>"What the hell is that?" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>"That’s your daughter head," Opaca said gently. "She’s crowning." Opaca was
standing beside B’Elanna, ready to take over if anything went wrong, and she had
her hands over B’Elanna’s guiding them into place.</P>
<P>"I see her head!" B’Elanna yelled to Seven. "She’s got hair… a lot." She
looked at the head forcing its way into the world, the tiny hairs wet and curly
and dark.</P>
<P>"What color?" Seven asked even as she pushed.</P>
<P>"Dark," B’Elanna said excitedly. Her earlier lightheadedness was gone as soon
as she saw her child coming into the world.</P>
<P>"Put your hand here, on her head. We don’t want her coming too fast," Opaca
placed B’Elanna’s hand onto the baby’s head. While B’Elanna gently held pressure
on the baby, Opaca tested Seven’s skin, deciding she didn’t like what she found.
"Doctor, two ccs of dirsoraline," she said without looking up.</P>
<P>"What’s that?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"It will help relax her even more… make a bit more room for the little one,"
Opaca explained as the Doctor handed her the hypospray. She injected it directly
into the over-stretched skin and the change was immediate as the tightness
lessened.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"What is happening?" Seven asked as she leaned against Nara when the
contraction ended.</P>
<P>The Doctor moved up next to Seven and explained how the drug worked. She
listened halfheartedly as she waited for the next contraction.</P>
<P>"Here comes another one," the Doctor said after a few minutes.</P>
<P>"Seven, I need you to push as hard as you can," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"Umm, Opaca," B’Elanna said. "That may not be a good idea…Borg strength."</P>
<P>"Seven, I need you to push… like you have been," Opaca corrected.</P>
<P>The contraction hit and Seven pushed, but the child refused to move. "It
hurts," Seven said as she kept pushing.</P>
<P>Opaca looked up at the Doctor and he shook his head, frowning. She turned
back to B’Elanna and put her hand over the Klingon’s. "Let me take over," she
said as she eased B’Elanna out of the way. "Seven, stop pushing."</P>
<P>"I would love to," Seven said. "Try telling my body that."</P>
<P>"The contraction is almost over," the Doctor said. "Try not to push,
Seven."</P>
<P>"I’m right here," B’Elanna said as she moved beside Seven and took her hand.
Nara stepped back, but put her hand on the Klingon’s waist. </P>
<P>"Is the baby all right?" Seven asked when the contraction ended.</P>
<P>"She fine," Opaca said. "I just have to move her a little to the side so that
she can come out." Opaca explained. "Just try to relax, it will make it
easier."</P>
<P>"You are going to put your hand….inside me?" Seven asked. "The baby won’t
even fit out of there and now you intend to put your hand up there too?" </P>
<P>"Just take a deep breath and it will be fine," Opaca assured her.</P>
<P>"It will not be fine," Seven said in a panic. "That is a one way canal. It is
intended for beings to leave it…not to crawl up inside there."</P>
<P>"I am not crawling up inside there. It’s just my hand." Opaca took a deep
breath. </P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said as she rubbed her leg. "She has to turn the baby. She
can’t come out the way she is."</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said, fear lacing her tone. She took a deep breath and
closed her eyes. Nara squeezed her hand.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Anything on long range sensors, Mister Kim?" Janeway asked as she stared at
the viewscreen. There were times when space travel was extremely boring. Stars
all looked the same when they flew past at warp speed, beautiful streaks of
white sparkling like rainbows stretching into eternity, but after a few hours of
watching, it tended to lose its charm.</P>
<P>"Nothing out of the ordinary," Harry said from his console.</P>
<P>"Perfect day to sleep in." Chakotay yawned.</P>
<P>"Wonder if B’Elanna would agree to take the bridge and let me sleep in
today?" Janeway asked. "I’ll bet Seven is going crazy being off duty. She never
did like just sitting around doing nothing."</P>
<P>"I’m sure she’ll find something to do," Chakotay said. </P>
<P>"She’s probably coming up with a more efficient diaper as we speak," Janeway
added.</P>
<P>"Borg efficiency takes on motherhood." Chakotay laughed. "Parenting may never
be the same."</P>
<P>"Seven may never be the same," Janeway said as she checked her comm panel for
any interesting reports from the various departments. There were none.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Opaca reached up and pushed the baby’s head. "This is going to feel a little
uncomfortable. I need you to relax."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened, and B’Elanna caressed her cheek, calming her instantly.
"I am ready," Seven said.</P>
<P>Opaca took a deep breath and her matrix flickered as she readjusted her image
output, making her hands smaller before she tried to move the child. "I’m
putting my hand inside, try to relax."</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and inhaled sharply.</P>
<P>"Okay, I’ve got the shoulder," Opaca said. "I’m moving her… there. Now, just
breathe as I come back out. One more contraction should do it."</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes and looked up at B’Elanna. "I want you to do it," Seven
said. She glanced down at Opaca, locking eyes with her. The hologram smiled and
dipped her head.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and went back to her position between Seven’s legs. Opaca was
there, encouraging her while Nara took Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"It’s time," the Doctor said, watching the tricorder.</P>
<P>"Nice and steady," Opaca said. "Keep pushing, Seven." She moved her hands and
let B’Elanna take over. "Gentle pressure on the head," she explained. "That’s
it."</P>
<P>Seven leaned forward and squeezed her eyes shut as she pushed.</P>
<P>"She’s coming out," B’Elanna said. "Her head’s out!" </P>
<P>"Hold her head. Guide her as she comes out. Just let it happen," Opaca said
with a smile. Her voice was lyrical, and full of reverence. She moved B’Elanna’s
hands to support the tiny head and then used a bulb syringe to clean her mouth
and nose. The baby coughed and her eyes squeezed shut but she didn’t cry.</P>
<P>"She’s got ridges…on her forehead," B’Elanna said, her voice full of
wonder.</P>
<P>Seven groaned as she fought to keep pushing. Her face was covered with sweat
and she was trembling. "How many?" Seven asked through clinched teeth.</P>
<P>"Four of them…like me." B’Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"Ease her out," Opaca said even as she put her hands over B’Elanna’s and they
pulled the baby gently. "The shoulders are clear. Seven, you’re doing great."
</P>
<P>"She’s out," B’Elanna said as she held her daughter for the first time. Opaca
made sure that B’Elanna wasn’t going to drop the baby and then leaned away to
grab a cleansing towel.</P>
<P>"Let me see her," Seven said as she collapsed onto Nara. "Why isn’t she
crying? Babies cry when they are born."</P>
<P>"Just a moment," Opaca said. She helped B’Elanna wrap her snugly in a
blanket. "Seven, Klingon babies do not cry when they are born. In battle, a
crying baby would give away your position," she added as she looked down at the
baby. The tiny girl was looking up at B’Elanna with wide eyes, and her spindly
arms were waving in the air.</P>
<P>"She’s beautiful," B’Elanna said as Opaca untangled the cord. She moved
beside the bed, easing past Nara who was trying to get a good look at the baby
as B’Elanna tried to hand her to Seven without stressing the uncut cord. "Our
daughter is beautiful," B’Elanna said as she held the baby out to her wife.</P>
<P>"Be’nal." Seven took the baby and studied her tiny features. She laughed.
"She has a mole just like yours." Seven lifted the squirming bundle and kissed
her cheek. "And her eyes look so blue."</P>
<P>"Seven, you’re not quite done yet," Opaca said from between Seven’s legs. She
reached up and massaged the former drone’s belly. "You still have to deliver the
placenta. One more contraction and then you’ll be done."</P>
<P>"I will comply," she whispered and handed the baby to B’Elanna. The Klingon
couldn’t take her eyes off of the tiny, quiet bundle. </P>
<P>"The contraction is coming," the Doctor said. He turned to B’Elanna and
scanned the baby. "I should examine her…if that’s all right?"</P>
<P>"Can I hold her?" B’Elanna asked without looking up.</P>
<P>"Of course," he said as he continued scanning. "She’s in excellent health."
He smiled and looked at B’Elanna. "She’s beautiful…just like her mothers." He
continued scanning, then frowned but quickly changed his expression before
anyone else noticed.</P>
<P>"Keep pushing," Opaca said as the contraction hit. "That’s it…nice and firm.
Good…"</P>
<P>Seven nodded as she leaned back and sighed.</P>
<P>"There," Opaca said. "Now, you’re done." She turned to the Doctor. "What
about the nanoprobes?"</P>
<P>"They seem to be migrating down the cord and deactivating," he said, studying
the readings. "Now, I need to weigh her… you’ll have to put her on the pediatric
scale over here as soon as we cut the cord," he told B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked as she looked at her wife.</P>
<P>Seven nodded</P>
<P>Opaca reached up and clamped off the cord and then cut it.</P>
<P>"Well, hello there." The Doctor took the baby and she immediately squirmed
and began to fuss. "Just a moment," he said. The baby clinched both of her hands
and let out a cry and began screaming at a level that left no doubt as to the
impressive strength of her lungs. The Doctor frowned and held her at arms’
length as she continued crying. "Lieutenant?"</P>
<P>"Oh… sweet… Kahless!" B’Elanna’s eyes widened.</P>
<P>"I didn’t do anything," the Doctor whined.</P>
<P>"What the hell is happening?" B’Elanna asked as she looked down at her chest.
Two dark spots began forming, one on each side of her chest. Opaca leaned over
and looked.</P>
<P>"Your milk just came down," Opaca informed her. "Klingon’s have an instant
response to a crying child."</P>
<P>"It’s leaking like a warp core breach," she yelled as she stared at the
growing stains. She looked over at the Doctor and her screaming child. </P>
<P>"I didn’t do anything. Why do these children keep crying?" He was holding her
as far away from his body as possible as her screams became more like howls.
</P>
<P>"Give her to me." B’Elanna took the baby and held her to her chest. The baby
quieted down instantly and B’Elanna went back to Seven.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered as the Klingon leaned against the bed. "She is
hungry." She wrapped her arm around B’Elanna’s waist and looked up
expectantly.</P>
<P>"I… well…I don’t know…how," B’Elanna admitted. She looked down at her
daughter who was smacking her lips and sucking on her fist.</P>
<P>"I’ll show you." Nara moved alongside the Klingon.</P>
<P>The Doctor looked on expectantly.</P>
<P>"You, out," B’Elanna said to the Doctor and she pointed to his office. "And I
want a privacy screen up too."</P>
<P>"I am a Doctor, not a voyeur," he said indignantly.</P>
<P>"Out," B’Elanna said. The stains on her gown expanded and she felt milk
running down her belly.</P>
<P>"Fine," the Doctor said as he headed toward his office. "Opaca, may I have a
word with you?" he asked, pausing to pick up the medical tricorder.</P>
<P>"Of course," she said. "Seven, I don’t want you getting up until I clear you,
is that understood?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said without turning around. She was staring at her wife and
daughter and barely heard the hologram’s comment.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway caught her chin before it hit her chest. It wouldn’t do for
the captain to fall asleep on her own bridge. She casually glanced over at
Chakotay; he was fighting to keep his eyelids open. She cleared her throat, and
her First Officer sat up a little straighter.</P>
<P>"Commander, I’ll be in my ready room if you need me," she said as she began
to stand.</P><I>
<P>*"Torres to the bridge…"* </I>B’Elanna said over the comm</P>
<P>Janeway leaned back into her chair and tapped her comm panel. "Lieutenant?"
she asked. "I thought you were off duty?" Janeway smiled.</P><I>
<P>*"Yes, ma’am,"*</I> B’Elanna said<I>. *"Permission to add a name to the
ship’s manifest?"*</I> she asked.</P>
<P>"Who did you have in mind?" Janeway asked. She was curious since Tach and his
family had already been officially added to the ship’s manifest.</P><I>
<P>*"With your permission… I’d like to add Kayla Erin Torres to our manifest,"*
</I>B’Elanna said proudly.</P>
<P>"I think I’m going to need at least a visual inspection before I can approve
that." Kathryn’s eyes sparkled. "Are you near a comm panel?"</P><I>
<P>*"Yes, ma’am,"*</I> B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"On screen," Janeway said as she spun toward Harry Kim.</P>
<P>"Coming in now," Harry said with a huge grin.</P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna said as her image filled the screen. She was in the
Doctor’s office, leaning against his desk. "This is Kayla Erin Torres." She held
up the tiny bundle toward the screen. Kayla was sleeping and her fist was
planted firmly in her mouth. Her hair was not as dark as it had first looked
when wet, and B’Elanna stared down at it. It was light brown with red
highlights. She shifted Kayla in her arms and the baby yawned and crinkled her
ridged brow. "Kayla, this is your Captain," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Permission granted," Janeway said, her voice thick with emotion. "But, I
think I need a personal inspection," she added with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Of course," B’Elanna said without looking up.</P>
<P>"How’s Seven?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"She’s fine." B’Elanna looked up and smiled. "She’s tired, but fine."</P>
<P>"Is she up for visitors?" Chakotay asked. He was leaning forward, trying to
get a better look at the newest arrival.</P>
<P>"I think Kayla would be thrilled to have some visitors," B’Elanna said. "But
don’t expect Seven to be awake."</P>
<P>"Congratulation, B’Elanna," Kathryn said sincerely.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Tom said from the helm, "She’s beautiful. Tell Seven
congratulations."</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said, looking over her shoulder toward sickbay. "Now, I
have to go. Seven’s ready to go home and I don’t think Opaca understands exactly
how… insistent my wife can be."</P>
<P>"Oh dear," Kathryn said. "Tell Opaca that unless absolutely necessary… she
should not keep Seven in sickbay against her will.</P>
<P>"Gladly," B’Elanna said as she closed the channel.</P>

</table>

<P>Day one: 11:06</P>B’Elanna was in her quarters, sitting on the edge of the
bed holding Kayla. Seven was sleeping beside her, stretched out under the fur
comforter.
<P></P>
<P>"Shh, little one. Let your mama sleep," B’Elanna whispered and kissed her
daughter’s forehead. Kayla was kicking her feet and squirming, ready to eat
again. Nara had walked B’Elanna through the first feeding, but now the Narian
was gone and B’Elanna was trying it on her own.</P>
<P>Kayla frowned, sucked on her fist, and kicked her feet even harder.</P>
<P>"I’m trying," B’Elanna whispered as she fought to unbutton her blouse without
putting the baby down. "Geeze, I’m leaking again and you’re not even crying."
B’Elanna watched as twin stains appeared on her blouse.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven sat up and moved behind her wife. </P>
<P>"Your daughter is an eating machine," B’Elanna said. Kayla began to whimper.
"I fed her less than two hours ago."</P>
<P>"Should I call Nara?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No." B’Elanna moved Kayla to the side. "I’m Chief Engineer… I think I can
feed my daughter. Nara showed me and it wasn’t that difficult."</P>
<P>"I want to help." Seven scooted behind B’Elanna. She put one leg on each side
of her wife and reached around her and helped support Kayla. </P>
<P>"Umm," B’Elanna moaned happily. "I like that," she said as Seven put her hand
over B’Elanna’s on Kayla’s back. </P>
<P>"She has your fingers." Seven rested her chin on B’Elanna’s shoulder and
studied their daughter. </P>
<P>"And your nose." B’Elanna freed her breast from the nursing bra and then
lifted Kayla to her. The baby nuzzled her breast, seeming to play with the
hardening nipple more than trying to eat. "She learned that from you," B’Elanna
added.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven tipped the baby’s head toward B’Elanna’s nipple. She latched
on and began suckling. "I never get distracted when I am near your breasts. You
are the one who cannot pay attention."</P>
<P>"You are very distracting, my Be’nal." B’Elanna leaned back against Seven and
sighed, then stared at Kayla. "Look." B’Elanna stared down, her voice full of
wonder.</P>
<P>"Our love made her," Seven said as she kissed B’Elanna neck.</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna whispered. She watched a while longer and then sighed. "This
is a piece of cake."</P>
<P>"I knew you could do it," Seven said. "I believe we have mastered
parenting."</P>
<P>"Yeah, no problem," B’Elanna said and then inhaled sharply. "I’m sure I’ll
get used to having a vacuum attached to my chest."</P>
<P>"It will be simple," Seven promised her.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Day two: 11:58.</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes, pausing before she stepped out of her regeneration
chamber. The small unit took up one corner of their cramped quarters, and Seven
had suggested that she go back to regenerating in the cargo bay. B’Elanna had
refused.</P>
<P>"Welcome back," B’Elanna said from the rocking chair across the room. She was
holding Kayla, and studying her wife.</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven smiled and went toward her family. "Did you sleep?"</P>
<P>"Talk to your daughter," B’Elanna said. "Every time I try to doze off she
decides to test those lungs of hers."</P>
<P>"Is she ill?" Seven knelt in front of B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"No, just Klingon." </P>
<P>Seven leaned down and kissed Kayla’s cheek. "I thought Klingon children do
not cry."</P>
<P>"Not according to what my mother told me." B’Elanna yawned. "They keep quiet
right after they’re born, but once they get to be a few hours old… look
out."</P>
<P>"Try to sleep." Seven stood and took the baby. "I will hold her."</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said as she stood. "I’m sure she’ll fall into a routine
soon."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna rolled over and looked at the clock. It was 02:06, and Kayla had
been crying since before 01:00. Seven was walking around their quarters trying
to soothe her, but nothing seemed to help.</P>
<P>"Maybe she’s hungry again," B’Elanna offered when Seven made a lap through
the bedroom. B’Elanna’s Klingon instincts were driving her insane. Her breasts
had filled three nursing pads and seemed to be leaking as much as if her
daughter was eating.</P>
<P>"She just ate," Seven said as she stopped and looked at B’Elanna’s wet
nightgown. She went to the nightstand and opened the top drawer. "Here," she
said as she shoved a breast pump at her wife.</P>
<P>B’Elanna grumbled. "No one told me I’d have to siphon off these squirting
wells attached to my chest."</P>
<P>"It will get easier." Seven paced into the living room.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Day three: 04:02</P>
<p>B’Elanna rolled over and looked at her daughter. Kayla was next to the
bed in a crib. She refused to nurse. She also refused to go to sleep. It was
04:02, almost morning, and the Klingon was exhausted. Every time she started to
doze off, Kayla would scream at the top of her lungs. It seemed that since the
tiny bundle was now outside of Seven’s womb, she wanted her growling Klingon
mother to entertain her. B’Elanna was not amused.</p>
<p>On the other side of
the bed, Seven was sleeping soundly. Now that she had didn’t have a kicking baby
inside anymore, she was curled up on her side and was snoring quite loudly. Even
when Kayla would sleep, B’Elanna couldn’t seem to drift off with the Borg
enhanced snooze that was rattling the entire bedroom. B’Elanna wondered if
beaming her wife onto the couch was grounds for divorce.</p>
<p>The previous
night Kayla had fallen asleep just after 03:00, but Seven had decided it was the
perfect opportunity to make love to B’Elanna. At the time it seemed like a great
idea to B’Elanna, but now, twenty some hours later... without any sleep... she
decided it was a plot on Seven’s part to kill her.</p>
<p>B’Elanna sighed
happily when Seven’s snoring finally stopped. A few moments later she watched as
Kayla’s eyes flickered shut. B’Elanna closed her own eyes just as she felt her
wife’s hand snake around her waist.</p>
<p>"She is asleep," Seven said as she
nuzzled B’Elanna’s earlobe. "Now we can find something else to do." Seven’s hand
moved up and cupped B’Elanna’s breast.</p>
<p>"Be’nal, I need sleep," B’Elanna
whined even as her body responded.</p>
<p>"It has been forever," Seven whispered
huskily. She rolled B’Elanna onto her back. "I miss you." She nuzzled B’Elanna’s
temple and kissed her ear.</p>
<p>"I have baby spit in my hair," B’Elanna
whined. "How can you possibly be aroused?"</p>
<p>"You always arouse me," Seven
said as she tried to straddle her wife.</p>
<p>"I need sleep," B’Elanna repeated
and she squirmed away from her wife. Seven seemed to have grown extra
hands...hands that were everywhere at once. The Klingon suddenly realized that
sleeping naked was not conducive to getting any sleep when Seven was
involved.</P>
<p>"I need you," Seven said as her hand made its way back to B’Elanna’s
chest.</p>
<p>"Be’nal..." B’Elanna whined, drawing out the word. "For the love
of Kahless...just let me sleep for one hour."</p>
<p>"I do not wish to force you
into anything unpleasant," Seven said as she eased away.</p>
<p>"I know it would
be very pleasant," B’Elanna said with a sigh. She rolled toward Seven and
studied her in the dimly lit room. Seven’s eyes were flickering with fire, a
fire that burned only for B’Elanna. "Unfortunately...if I don’t get some
sleep... I’m not gonna’ survive much longer."</p>
<p>"Are you ill?" Seven felt
B’Elanna’s forehead, leaning over to kiss her ridges for good
measure.</p>
<p>"No, just exhausted." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and tucked it
under her cheek. "My beloved... I didn’t get to regenerate this morning and wake
up freshly charged. That child of yours hasn’t let me sleep all day...or
night."</p>
<p>"I will comply," Seven said grouchily.</p>
<p>"I promise, it
won’t be too long," B’Elanna said as she snuggled closer, careful not to wake
Kayla.</p>
<p>"It has already been too long," Seven said with a sigh.</p>
<P>"Darling, what’s the hurry?" B’Elanna yawned and leaned over to check on
Kayla before turning back to Seven.</P>
<P>"Opaca said that as of today… four hours and three minutes ago… I can now
engage in <I>all</I> sexual activities," Seven said as she raised her eyebrows
to make the point. "Since two weeks before Kayla’s birth… you have been unable
to… go inside. That restriction is now lifted."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said as she watched her wife’s eyes sparkle. </P>
<P>Seven leaned over and began kissing B’Elanna’s ear. "I need to feel you
inside me, B’Elanna… to feel my body wrap around your fingers," she whispered,
her voice husky. </P>
<P>"Oh, god," B’Elanna moaned.</P>
<P>"It has been forever since I felt you inside my wetness," Seven continued as
she nibbled on B’Elanna’s ear.</P>
<P>"Seven, please… I am so tired," B’Elanna complained halfheartedly. She
reached over and caressed her wife’s breast. "I need to sleep," she whispered as
she began kissing Seven.</P>
<P>"You do not appear to want sleep," she pointed out, and then B’Elanna pulled
Seven on top of her. "I will do all of the work," Seven promised.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "When you do all the work…I end up feeling like an
overcooked noodle. I don’t think I could survive the ‘wow phenomenon’ right now,
love." She pulled Seven down to her lips and they shared a slow, lingering
kiss.</P>
<P>"All you have to do is love me," Seven whispered as she straddled B’Elanna’s
hips.</P>
<P>"Oh, is that all?" B’Elanna asked between kisses.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven promised. She kissed B’Elanna’s neck and guided her wife’s hand
between her legs. </P>
<P>"Oh, god," B’Elanna moaned as she felt her wife’s wetness cover her
fingertips. </P>
<P>"I have missed you." Seven began kissing down B’Elanna’s chest, gently biting
her full breasts. "I need to feel you, Be’nal." She moved her lips down and
nuzzled the hardening nipple.</P>
<P>"Oh… Sweet Kahless." B’Elanna sighed as she lifted her fingers inside of
Seven. The welcoming heat sent a charge of electricity to B’Elanna’s core.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said with a growl. She pressed down, making B’Elanna’s finger
move further inside her. "Yes, my Be’nal." She carefully bit down on the nipple
in front of her, then jerked back as milk squirted out and hit her in the eye.
"Ugh!"</P>
<P>"Oh geeze," B’Elanna said as Seven sat up. She felt milk running down her
chest, getting instantly sticky as it cooled.</P>
<P>"Do not move," Seven ordered and she gripped B’Elanna’s wrist. "Stay right
where you are." Her eyes locked with B’Elanna’s letting her know that taking her
fingers out was not an option. Seven carefully leaned over to the nightstand and
dug around the drawer. She moved back and kissed B’Elanna forcefully, making the
Klingon forget about the milk between their bodies. </P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna hissed as she heard and felt the breast pump latch onto her
chest. "What are you doing?" She pushed Seven off of her chest, but her fingers
were still pinned inside of her wife.</P>
<P>"Shh." Seven tried to kiss B’Elanna again.</P>
<P>"Oh no," B’Elanna said as she pulled out of Seven. "We are not mixing these
two activities. No way."</P>
<P>"But…" Seven’s eyes shot open as her body protested B’Elanna’s absence.</P>
<P>"No buts," B’Elanna said. "<I>This</I> is definitely mommy time," she said
pointing to the breast pump. "And <I>that</I> is definitely wife time," she
added as she pointed between her wife’s legs. "We are not mixing them. No… No
way. This ship doesn’t have a counselor, and I guarantee you if we mix these two
things…I will need a counselor."</P>
<P>Seven moved off of her wife and rested on one elbow as she watched the pump
sucking on the nipple she craved. She sighed as she held it in place, not quite
understanding B’Elanna’s protests, but preferring to honor the request. When the
pump stopped, she moved it to the other side and waited impatiently for it to
finish. After several minutes it stopped and she reached over and put the pump
aside and tucked the milk into a stasis container beside the bed. She rolled
over and kissed the back of B’Elanna neck.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and then began snoring…loudly.</P>
<P>Seven frowned and tried kissing her wife’s temple.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smacked her lips and whined, then rolled over toward Seven and
cuddled onto her chest… sound asleep.</P>
<P>Seven was not amused.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Day four: 09:30</P>
<P>"She is asleep. I moved the crib into the living room so that your snoring
will not wake her," Seven said as she crawled into bed.</P>
<P>"My snoring? Love, your snoring puts me to shame." B’Elanna rolled over and
hugged Seven. "Ouch." She pulled back. "Damn breasts."</P>
<P>"Do you need the pump?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No, I am not a dairy cow," B’Elanna said as she settled onto her back.</P>
<P>"I did not say that you were a bovine." Seven moved over to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I feel like a cow," she whined.</P>
<P>"Go to sleep." Seven kissed her temple and began rubbing the ridges on her
forehead.</P>
<P>"Sleep," B’Elanna whispered happily. She sighed and yawned just as the door
chime sounded. "No. Sweet Kahless, she just went to sleep."</P>
<P>Seven jumped out of bed and ran to the door wearing only her floor length
sapphire gown. She reached it before it rang again and opened the door and
stared at the captain.</P>
<P>"Seven, how are you feeling?" Kathryn asked. She was holding a brightly
colored package. </P>
<P>Seven stared at it. </P>
<P>"It’s a baby gift," Kathryn said as she looked at the dark rings under
Seven’s eyes.</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven took it. "However I do not believe Kayla can open it at
her present level of motor development."</P>
<P>"It’s really for you and B’Elanna," Kathryn said with a tolerant smile. She
wasn’t sure if Seven was joking or not.</P>
<P>"I am sure she will love it, Kathryn," Seven said with a smirk. "Would you
like to come in?"</P>
<P>"Thank you." Kathryn followed Seven into her living room and looked into the
crib at Kayla and smiled. "She’s so beautiful. She really is a little angel."
</P>
<P>"She is perfect." Seven stood next to Kathryn. "Although I do not think an
angel would deprive my wife of sleep the way she has."</P>
<P>"Is B’Elanna asleep right now?" Kathryn looked toward the closed bedroom
door.</P>
<P>"I hope she is…although it is doubtful." Seven smiled down at Kayla. "Our
daughter seems to enjoy waking B’Elanna up every one point nine hours and then
keeping her up for at least an hour at a time."</P>
<P>"Do you have any milk in bottles?" Kathryn asked as she studied the tiny
sleeping form. It was hard to imagine the adorable bundle causing any problems.
Kayla was sleeping with her fists tucked under her chin, her lips were pursed,
and she breathed deep and regular. </P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said slowly. "B’Elanna produces more milk than Kayla can
consume. We have saved the additional milk for future use."</P>
<P>"Well," Kathryn said with a half grin, "Why don’t you wrap up your little
darling…and take her out to mingle…and let B’Elanna sleep?"</P>
<P>"An excellent idea," Seven said. "However, I do think I should change."</P>
<P>"I think that’s a very good idea." Kathryn sighed and tried not to look at
Seven’s cleavage straining to get out of the silky fabric. She really didn’t
want to notice that Seven’s belly had returned almost to normal, her figure once
again sure to turn heads. Her Borg nanoprobes had performed a miracle again.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kayla was the hit of the mess hall. She had woken up as soon as Kathryn and
Seven arrived at the crowded room and began nuzzling Seven’s chest in time for
lunch. She took the bottle without a peep and delighted the crew with her gentle
disposition. She looked around the faces of the crowd, her eyes wide and
curious, and never cried once. Seven couldn’t convince anyone that Kayla spent
most nights crying for B’Elanna to hold her. After visiting with everyone
present, Kayla cuddled up on Neelix’s chest and went to sleep. The furry
Talaxian held her for almost an hour until he had to get ready for the next
lunch crowd. He grumbled as he handed her over to Samantha Wildman who swore
that Kayla was the most perfect child she had ever seen, after Naomi.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Naomi joined them after her studies just as Kayla woke up. Kayla opened her
eyes and peered happily around without even a whine or grunt. She spent the next
hour being carried around the room by Naomi who saw her as her personal doll.
Kayla quietly allowed Naomi to oversee three changes of clothing. Naomi would
pick out an outfit and ask Seven to put it on her. They finally decided on the
dark green jumper that the captain had brought as a gift. It picked up the red
highlights in Kayla’s hair and showed off the dark, rich coloring she got from
B’Elanna. It was a happy time for Seven, but she missed B’Elanna. She consoled
herself with the thought that her wife was getting some much-needed rest.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After the long visit, Seven asked Kathryn to go with her and Kayla to the
Tach’s orchard. The captain accepted, happy to spend some of her off time with
her dear friend. Seven enjoyed the walk in silence, staring down at her daughter
in her arms. Once there, Seven revealed her reason for asking Kathryn along.</P>
<P>"How long were you involved with Mark?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"What?" Kathryn asked, somewhat shocked. She stopped in front of a blossoming
apple tree and turned. "Why?"</P>
<P>Seven carefully arranged a blanket on the sweet smelling grass and put Kayla
down to enjoy the fresh air. She stood, and sighed before turning to face her
friend.</P>
<P>"What is it, Seven?" Kathryn moved closer.</P>
<P>"I believe…that B’Elanna has lost interest in me…sexually." Seven studied the
grass at her feet.</P>
<P>"I find that hard to believe," Kathryn said gently. "I’ve never seen anyone
more in love than she is with you," Kathryn said honestly. "What would make you
think that she’s losing interest?"</P>
<P>"It has been…an eternity since we last… made love," Seven said. Her voice was
full of sorrow. "For the first time in our relationship…she is not…we do not…"
Seven sighed and turned away.</P>
<P>Kathryn stared at her lanky friend’s back. Seven was incredibly sexy from any
angle. She wondered exactly how long an "eternity" was to a Borg. "Seven,
how...umm...long has it been?"</P>
<P>Seven took a shuddering breath before speaking. "We have not made love in
thirty-one…" She took another breath and then bit her lip before continuing.
"Thirty-one hours."</P>
<P>Kathryn stared at Seven, her mouth refusing to work as she thought of her own
<I>years</I> of celibacy. Finally Kathryn found her voice. "Seven, call me when
it’s been thirty-one months," Kathryn said with a shake of her head.</P>
<P>"Months?" Seven asked, mortified. "Is it possible to survive that long?"</P>
<P>"I assure you, it is." Kathryn laughed and sat next to Kayla and studied the
sleeping child. "You went for a long time before you and B’Elanna, umm, got
together."</P>
<P>"As the saying goes, I did not know what I was missing," Seven said as she
sat next to Kathryn. "It is not a physical matter of sexuality," Seven
explained. "My love for B’Elanna…transcends everything. It is more than
physical. My love for her is so…complete that it spills over into the physical
plane. I cannot do anything other than love her. I literally hurt if I do not
touch her." </P>
<P>"Well, it won’t kill you. Although you may think it will," Kathryn said.
"Besides, she’s probably just adjusting to motherhood."</P>
<P>"Will our intimacy always be hindered?" Seven asked. Her face showed her fear
and disgust. "Why didn’t anyone tell me this?"</P>
<P>"Seven, calm down. Chances are, everything will return to normal as soon as
she gets used to things," Kathryn said delicately. "Besides, you said that she
hasn’t been sleeping. That is bound to effect her…umm… appetite."</P>
<P>"We have gone without sleep in the past and it has never lessened her
appetite for me," Seven whined.</P>
<P>"Give it time," Kathryn advised. She shook her head and tried not to laugh at
her friend’s misery, but the willowy blonde really needed a reality check.
Kathryn hadn’t been as sexually active with any of her partners as Seven and
B’Elanna appeared to be with each other. Poor B’Elanna probably needed every bit
of Klingon stamina to keep up with Seven’s Borg…resilience.</P>
<P>Seven stretched out next to Kayla, smiling as she watched her child yawn.
Kathryn looked on, amazed at the transformation. The former Borg looked as human
as any member of the crew, her eyes were shining and the edges of her lips were
curling up.</P>
<P>"It is worth it," Seven said as she touched Kayla’s cheek. "As much as I will
miss making love several times a day…she is worth any sacrifice."</P>
<P>"Seven, quit pouting. Let your wife get some rest and deal with it." Kathryn
picked up one of the small towels from the diaper bag and tossed it as Seven.
"You have a gorgeous wife, a wonderful daughter and a more active sex life than
ninety-nine percent of this crew. So quit rubbing it in everyone’s faces."</P>
<P>"I do not care what most people do or do not do," Seven stated as she pulled
the towel off of her face. "I only care what has changed between my wife and I.
Everything and everyone else is… irrelevant."</P>
<P>"That’s a good answer," Kathryn said with a smirk. "I think it will be fine
as soon as B’Elanna gets over the shock of being a mother."</P>
<P>"Really?" Seven asked hopefully.</P>
<P>"Yes, really." Kathryn stretched out on her back and laughed. "Thirty-one
hours… my god, Seven… You really have no idea how lucky you are." She smiled as
she closed her eyes and tried to picture B’Elanna’s reaction to the conversation
she was having with Seven. "Thirty-one hours," Kathryn whispered again as she
covered her face with her arms. "Good lord."</P>
