<P>B’Elanna yawned and opened her eyes. She was on her back, in bed, and felt
like her breasts were about to literally explode. She carefully rolled to the
side at looked at the clock and was amazed to see that she had slept for almost
six hours. No wonder her breasts were swelling like overripe melons. She sat up
and smiled when she saw a data padd propped up next to the breast pump, knowing
that Seven must have left them for her. She picked up the padd first, touching
the screen as she read her wife’s words.</P>
<P>Be’nal,</P>
<P>I have taken Kayla on a tour of the ship with Kathryn.<BR>Sleep. That is an
order. When you read this, use the pump<BR>and go back to sleep. That is also an
order. <BR>When you are fully rested, you may take a long hot bath.<BR>I left a
bowl of apple blossoms next to the tub. <BR>Do not worry about Kayla, I took
enough milk for several feedings.<BR>We will be home in nine hours. Enjoy your
rest.<BR>I love you.<BR>Your Seven</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<DIR></DIR>
<P>"Kahless, I love that woman," B’Elanna said as she took the breast pump and
began expressing her milk.</P>
<P>When she finished, she decided to go ahead and take her bath. She sank into
the steaming water scented with fresh apple blossoms from Tach’s orchard and
knew that she was in heaven. "Oh, yeah," she whispered. She rested her head on
the back of the tub and after several moments she drifted off to sleep. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven and Kayla walked Kathryn back to her quarters and stayed for quite a
while. It gave Kathryn a chance to feel like she was still a part of her
friend’s life. They made plans to begin their Velocity matches again soon, but
it had been several years since Seven had played so Kathryn promised to go easy
on her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From there Seven went to check in with Opaca. The hologram had asked her to
stop by for a checkup the next day and Seven decided that going a day early was
a great idea. When she arrived, Opaca and the Doctor were both activated. They
were in his office having a heated argument. The Doctor saw Seven and stopped
talking, then nodded toward her. Opaca came out to meet her.</P>
<P>"Seven, I didn’t expect you until tomorrow," Opaca said with a smile.</P>
<P>"I was out with Kayla and decided that it made more sense to stop by now,"
Seven said as she studied the Doctor. He was sitting at his desk going over a
data padd. "What were you fighting about?"</P>
<P>"A difference of opinion regarding policy," Opaca said. "Now, let’s have a
look at my first delivery." Opaca held out her hands and took Kayla. She was
awake and snuggled into the hologram’s chest and sighed, then let out a
contented squeak. Opaca rubbed her back and laughed. "She’s a little cuddler,
isn’t she?"</P>
<P>"She is most happy when being held," Seven agreed. She walked alongside Opaca
as she took Kayla to the pediatric scale and carefully placed her on it.</P>
<P>"Hmm." Opaca kept her hands near Kayla in case she squirmed. "Seven pounds
fourteen ounces…she’s actually gained two ounces."</P>
<P>"She has only gained two ounces?" Seven asked as she stepped closer. "After
all she has eaten? Is she sick?"</P>
<P>"No, Seven," Opaca said, picking up the baby. "I’m amazed she’s gained any
weight at all. Babies usually lose a bit of weight their first few days." She
put Kayla on the exam table and began scanning her. "She is in excellent
health."</P>
<P>"Good," Seven said and let out a sigh. "I should have brought B’Elanna. I had
no idea this would be so… unnerving."</P>
<P>The Doctor stepped out of his office and cleared his throat. "How is
<I>Voyager’s</I> littlest patient?"</P>
<P>"Fine," Opaca said as she gave him an icy glare. "Now, if you don’t mind, I
need to finish my exam."</P>
<P>"Don’t forget to take blood samples." He crossed his arms over his chest.</P>
<P>"I am a hologram…I don’t forget things," Opaca said. She turned her back on
him.</P>
<P>"Yes…well." He went back to his office. "I was just making a suggestion."</P>
<P>"What is going on?" Seven asked. She grabbed Opaca’s arm. "Are you fighting
about Kayla?"</P>
<P>"Calm down," Opaca said gently. "He wants to take over as her physician now
that she’s born." Opaca used a hypospray to draw a tiny amount of blood. </P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she moved closer to her child. "I forbid it."</P>
<P>"I kinda’ thought you might." Opaca shook her head. "Don’t worry. I’m not
going anywhere. The Doctor needs to be kept in line."</P>
<P>"See that he is," Seven said. Her eyes were hard and cold like a blast of
arctic wind against unprotected skin. "I will not tolerate any missteps on his
part."</P>
<P>"There, all finished. She’s doing great, Seven. I’ll handle him," Opaca
promised.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said as she picked up Kayla and left. Something about the
exchange bothered her and she again wished that she had brought B’Elanna with
her. </P>
<P>Opaca walked into the Doctor’s office as soon as Seven left. She put the
blood sample on his desk and crossed her arms. "You’re a bastard," she said, her
voice full of disgust. </P>
<P>"I am a hologram," he said. "And Chief Medical Officer." He took the sample
and stood, then went to the console and put the sample into a scanning
device.</P>
<P>"I’m talking to the captain," Opaca said to his back.</P>
<P>"I already have a call in to her." The console beeped and he shook his head
and turned. "She’ll be here in an hour."</P>
<P>"That’s not soon enough." Opaca went back to the exam room. She tapped her
comm badge. "Opaca to Janeway. Captain, I need you in sickbay as soon as
possible."</P><I>
<P>*"I’m in my quarters. I’ll be right there,"*</I> Janeway said over the comm.
<I>*"Janeway out."*</P></I>
<P>"It won’t matter," the Doctor said smugly. </P>
<P>"It will to me." Opaca turned and glared at him. "What happened to you? You
used to care about the crew. You used to be compassionate and genuinely
concerned about people." </P>
<P>"I am following Starfleet regulations." He sighed. "Besides, you have no idea
what I was or wasn’t like before you came along."</P>
<P>She walked away, preferring to stand on the opposite side of the room from
him. "You’re wrong," she whispered sadly as she fidgeted with a hypospray.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna was wearing a thick, fluffy, dark blue robe and kept tugging it
closed at the collar. She paced as she waited for Seven to get back.</P>
<P>"Calm down," Nara said from the couch. "She’ll be home any minute."</P>
<P>"I’ve never been away from Kayla this long," B’Elanna whined. "How am I going
to survive tonight?"</P>
<P>Nara laughed and stood. "I am quite certain your survival tonight will not be
threatened by letting Kayla stay with Tach and I." She wrapped her arm around
the nervous Klingon’s waist. "However… that frisky wife of yours may kill you
off."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but what a way to go." B’Elanna laughed and turned to her friend and
smiled. "Thank you."</P>
<P>"No problem. I would have offered to take her before now, but new mothers are
so fussy." Nara turned when the door hissed open and Seven entered. She was
carrying Kayla and the diaper bag and didn’t see the Narian at first.</P>
<P>"Nara, hello," Seven said happily. "Lana, did you rest?"</P>
<P>"Yes, your wife rested." Nara rolled her eyes. </P>
<P>"How are you, little one?" B’Elanna asked with a huge smile. She took Kayla
from Seven. "Did you have an adventure? Did you meet any new friends?" She
kissed Kayla’s tiny ridges and rocked her in her arms. "Were you good for
mama?"</P>
<P>"She was exceptionally well behaved," Seven said, then frowned. "She did not
cry once. Perhaps she does not like our quarters?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she continued kissing the tiny ridges. "She was just
showing off. Did you miss me? Did you miss your SoSoy?" she asked, using the
Klingon word for mommy.</P>
<P>"I am sure she missed her SoSoy," Seven said as she put the diaper bag on the
floor. "I know I did." She went to B’Elanna and hugged her from behind. "I
missed you terribly, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Okay," Nara said with a disgusted sigh. "Enough mushy stuff. Give me the kid
and I’ll be out of here." She held out her arms expectantly.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked as she squeezed B’Elanna tighter.</P>
<P>B’Elanna wiggled loose and turned to her wife. "I asked Nara to keep Kayla
tonight. I hope that’s all right." B’Elanna looked down at the baby, beginning
to regret the decision herself. "I thought we could use a little…wife time,"
B’Elanna said when she looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at Kayla, kissed her cheeks and then gave B’Elanna a
heartbreaking pout. "Perhaps we could go get her later tonight?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna agreed happily.</P>
<P>"Damn," Nara said and rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Tach bet me that you two wouldn’t be able to stand being away from her the
whole night. You just cost me two foot massages and a back rub." Nara held out
her hands and took Kayla. "Your mommies are big pushovers. You’re not even a
week old and you’ve got them wrapped around your little finger."</P>
<P>"As is should be," B’Elanna said as she pushed her friend out the door.
"Thanks, I’ll call later before I come to get her." </P>
<P>"No hurry," Nara said with a knowing smile. B’Elanna waved to the Narian as
the door shut, and then spun to face Seven. </P>
<P>"Now, my beloved," B’Elanna said with a growl. "You and I have some catching
up to do." She eased the robe off of her shoulders, letting it drop to the floor
revealing her blood-red nightgown. "Take off your clothes," B’Elanna ordered.
Her eyes were fully dilated like the predator she had become. </P>
<P>"I will comply," Seven said with a smile and a raise of one eyebrow. She
began slowly unbuttoning her pale blue blouse, letting her fingers trail across
her own breasts on the way to the lower buttons. Her eyes were locked with
B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"Comply…faster," B’Elanna said as she stalked closer. She was leaning
forward, looking like a panther that had the scent of blood, but she had a
different meal in mind. Her movements were fluid and graceful and focused on
Seven. The Klingon’s lip curled up on one side and she growled. It was a
rumbling, hungry growl that would have scared someone unfamiliar with Klingon
lust. </P>
<P>Seven was very familiar with that particular growl and she reacted instantly.
Her nipples hardened as her cobalt blue eyes dilated and she began backing
toward the bedroom. She loved to prolong B’Elanna’s hunt, to see her toned body
grow tense with passion as her muscles flexed in anticipation and her eyes
glowed with a dangerous flame.</P>
<P>B’Elanna licked her lips and smiled when Seven dropped her blouse to the
floor near the bedroom door. She made her way to the garment as Seven neared the
bed and began removing her bra. B’Elanna picked up the silky blouse, still warm
from Seven’s skin, and held it to her cheek and inhaled the scent. She moaned as
the delicate fragrance of Seven’s soap hit her nostrils.</P>
<P>Seven smirked and tossed her bra at B’Elanna. The Klingon caught it and
smelled it as well. She watched as Seven kicked off her shoes and slowly lowered
her slacks to the floor, now clad only in a pair of peach colored panties. She
lowered the panties and kicked them across the room away from her wife. B’Elanna
growled and tossed aside her wife’s sweetly scented clothes and charged the
willowy blonde. Seven stood her ground, returning B’Elanna’s hungry gaze.
B’Elanna stopped an inch before she reached Seven, then lifted her hands and
cradled her wife’s face with exquisite tenderness and drew her down for a slow,
sensual kiss.</P>
<P>Seven whimpered into her beloved’s mouth as their tongues met. She tried to
wrap her arms around B’Elanna but suddenly she was shoved onto the bed. She
laughed as she hit the mattress and looked up in time to see her wife in midair.
The panther was pouncing on her prey. </P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna said as she landed straddling Seven. Her nightgown had a
slit up one side almost to the hip and her legs were warm against Seven’s bare
skin. She rested a hand on either side of Seven’s head and leaned down and
kissed her with a passion that made the former drone see flashes of light
beneath her closed eyes.</P>
<P>"Yours," Seven agreed when the kiss finally broke. She reached up to touch
her wife’s face, but her wrist was grabbed and pressed into the bedding behind
her head.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna repeated as she pinned Seven in place and began kissing her
neck, letting her lips linger on the velvet skin. Her kisses became gentle bites
as she growled and snarled playfully.</P>
<P>"Always yours, Be’nal. I am yours to take as you wish." Seven knew this game
very well, and she loved it. She loved the power she wielded when she chose to
let her wife have complete control. They both knew that Seven could easily
overpower the Klingon, but giving up that power to the one she loved gave Seven
a sense of complete surrender she couldn’t have anywhere else.</P>
<P>"Hold the headboard," B’Elanna whispered as she nibbled her wife’s ear. She
loved this game too. They took turns being the one in control, and she loved
being on either end of the power-play. "Do not let go until I say you can," she
said with a smile.</P>
<P>Seven wiggled as she scooted up to reach the headboard. She grabbed it with
her hands and looked to B’Elanna expectantly. The Klingon laughed, deep and
rich, and let her weight settle onto her wife’s chest. </P>
<P>"Darling," B’Elanna said as she left fleeting kisses all over Seven’s face.
"You shouldn’t look so…eager… for my attack."</P>
<P>Seven smiled coyly when B’Elanna pulled back. "If what you do to me is an
attack…then the Borg are seriously misinformed."</P>
<P>"Hush," B’Elanna said playfully as she nipped Seven’s collarbone.</P>
<P>"Oh… save me," Seven said in complete Borg monotone. "I am being attacked by
a vicious Klingon warrior. Oh…no…won’t someone save me," she droned on
unemotionally.</P>
<P>"I’ll show you a vicious warrior," B’Elanna said. She growled and moved her
mouth over Seven’s nipple and began a loving assault on the tender bud. Her
mouth was hot and covered the stiffening nipple with gentle command.</P>
<P>"Oh, Lana," Seven cried out and began taking shuddering breaths.</P>
<P>"That’s more like it," B’Elanna said smugly as she pulled back. She let her
hands come to rest over Seven’s breasts, kneading the firm mounds as her mouth
nibbled on the satiny skin of Seven’s throat. "Mine," she said once again.</P>
<P>"I am yours. Mark me," Seven pleaded, lifting her hips into B’Elanna.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s hot breath filled Seven’s ear as she kissed and nibbled. "Where
did a beautiful Borg like you pick up a nasty taste for hickeys?" she asked
wickedly.</P>
<P>"From a nasty Klingon," Seven said. "Now, mark me," she ordered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sat up, her hands still caressing Seven’s breasts, and looked down
at her wife with both eyebrows raised. "I am in charge," B’Elanna pointed out.
She rolled Seven’s nipples between her fingertips to make her point.</P>
<P>"Mark me…please?" Seven tried. She arched her back, wanting to get closer to
her wife but her eyes never broke contact with B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"Hmm?" B’Elanna considered the request. She looked down at the rock hard
nipples between her fingers and lost all resolve. She dove onto one nipple and
began sucking as much of the breast into her mouth as she could, moaning as her
tongue flickered across its hard nub.</P>
<P>Seven forgot her request and rolled her head to side and let out her own
growl. She squeezed the headboard, making it creak beneath her fists.</P>
<P>After a few delicious moments, B’Elanna’s mouth migrated to the underside of
Seven’s breast. "Mine," she whispered and then drew the tender flesh into her
mouth. She sucked, drawing the blood to the surface of the skin, sure to leave a
very nice mark.</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven screamed, drawing the word out into a moan.</P>
<P>B’Elanna paused, opening her eyes and meeting Seven’s deep blue gaze. "Did I
hurt you?" she asked, concern filling her voice.</P>
<P>"No." Seven shook her head vigorously. "Do not stop."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and moved her mouth down to Seven’s ribs and began marking
that tender spot as well.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway tugged at her uniform tunic as she neared sickbay. It was her
day off, and she had been enjoying wearing her loose fitting black slacks and a
tank top. Opaca’s formal request meant whatever the issue was, it was ship’s
business, and that meant she had to be in uniform. </P>
<P>She walked into sickbay and saw Opaca examining a hypospray as if it were a
new exotic lifeform. Across the room, the Doctor was equally interested in a gel
pack. </P>
<P>"I didn’t think holograms quarreled." Janeway put her hands on her hips.</P>
<P>"Only when we have a damn good reason," Opaca said as she turned to face the
captain.</P>
<P>"Captain, this issue doesn’t even involve …her." The Doctor waved his hand at
Opaca. "As Chief Medical Officer…it is my duty to make sure all of the
Federation laws are upheld."</P>
<P>"You’re a pompous ass," Opaca said as she moved toward Janeway. "It is my
business when he starts investigating my patients."</P>
<P>"What investigation?" Janeway asked. She studied Opaca’s expression, the
hologram seemed to be genuinely upset, more than that, she seemed… down right
pissed off. Kathryn sighed, the last thing she needed was another sentient
hologram, and the first step to that was emotional awareness.</P>
<P>"He forced me to take blood samples from Kayla Torres," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"It was necessary…" the Doctor began.</P>
<P>"What the hell are you up to?" Janeway demanded, her eyes flashing. She
stalked over to the Doctor. Her voice was deep and menacing like a mother bear’s
growl.</P>
<P>"Captain, I assure you…it’s completely above board." The Doctor took a step
back. "There are certain… irregularities with the baby. I have to
investigate."</P>
<P>"What kind of irregularities?" Janeway’s voice reached its lowest
register.</P>
<P>"Genetic…" he said as he bumped into a biobed behind him.</P>
<P>"Is she Borg?" Kathryn asked, concern filling her voice.</P>
<P>"No." Opaca moved next to Janeway. "And I told this pompous ass that unless
Kayla was a risk to the ship…it wasn’t any of his business."</P>
<P>"I think you’d better explain this from the beginning," Kathryn said, looking
at Opaca.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s mouth was like a flame on Seven’s belly as she moved down to the
former drone’s hip. She growled and sucked the tender flesh into her mouth, her
hands still kneading Seven’s breasts. B’Elanna sucked as Seven screamed out in
agonizing pleasure, her arms shaking as she clung to the headboard.</P>
<P>"Lana, Lana, Lana," Seven moaned. It was her mantra, and far more sacred than
any ancient chant. Her hips lifted as B’Elanna moved her mouth to the silken
skin of her inner thigh. She drew in a ragged breath as she felt her beloved
Klingon marking her there as well.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna breathed onto Seven’s wet and heated flesh. Her breath sent
shivers through Seven’s body, and B’Elanna paused to watch the tiny bundle of
nerves contract. She blew cool air over Seven’s wetness, smiling when she gasped
in pleasure. "You are mine," B’Elanna whispered and then traced the delicate
pearl with her tongue.</P>
<P>"Lana…please…" Seven’s arms strained against the headboard as she fought to
keep her hands in place. "I need you inside."</P>
<P>"Here?" B’Elanna asked wickedly as she dipped one finger into the wetness.
She teased her wife unmercifully, dipping in and then coming out. </P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said in shaking voice. "Please."</P>
<P>B’Elanna licked her finger and tasted the nectar, closing her eyes to savor
the salty sweetness. "I forgot something," she said with an evil grin.</P>
<P>"You forgot to go inside," Seven yelled.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she climbed back up her wife’s sweat soaked body. "I
forgot to mark…this side." She growled and took the underside of the breast
between her teeth and quickly left a mark to match the opposite side.</P>
<P>Seven groaned in frustration and pleasure. She loved the feeling of her wife
marking her body, but she knew that she would have to wait for what her lower
region craved. By the time B’Elanna had properly marked that side of her body,
Seven was hyperventilating.</P>
<P>"Oh, please, my Lana," Seven pleaded between gasps.</P>
<P>"Is this what you want?" B’Elanna asked as she slid two fingers into the
molten liquid.</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven moaned as her body went rigid. "Yes, more."</P>
<P>B’Elanna happily added a third finger and then let her lips make love to the
quivering bundle of nerves at Seven’s center. She moaned as she felt Seven’s
muscles gripping her. She had missed this wonderful connection with her wife.
Opaca had made them stop this type of lovemaking almost two weeks earlier, and
B’Elanna had been craving it. She drew back her lips and let her tongue make a
lazy pass up the front of her wife’s wetness, her fingers still moving slowly in
and out.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna said before sucking Seven’s center back into her mouth.</P>
<P>"Yes…" Seven promised as her arms flexed against the artificial wood of the
bedframe. She vaguely noticed a creaking sound, and then two loud pops as the
headboard snapped lose from the frame under the boxsprings. Only Seven’s Borg
reflexes kept the headboard from hitting her in the face. She stopped the
massive headboard a few centimeters from her nose and then the head of the bed
fell to the floor with a loud thud.</P>
<P>B’Elanna screamed, and started to lift her mouth from Seven’s wetness.</P>
<P>"Do not stop," Seven yelled. It was not a polite request. It was an order
from one of the few people on board who B’Elanna would obey without question, so
she obeyed. She went back to her delicious task, shifting her weight so that she
wouldn’t roll onto her wife. Seven’s head was now pointing down at a forty-five
degree angle, but she didn’t seem to mind. She tossed the headboard across the
room, not noticing when it hit the closet door hard enough to take a chunk out
of the surface.</P>
<P>"There," Seven breathed when her wife found just the right spot inside.</P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna mumbled as she felt the first quivers inside of Seven. Her
fingers felt the contractions and her own body began to shake in response. "Oh,
god," B’Elanna mumbled, not taking her mouth off of Seven.</P>
<P>The former drone arched her back and then let her body fall onto the tilted
bed. The footboard creaked and fell away from the bed and the mattress hit the
floor with a muffled thump.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, and fought to keep from laughing, thinking that at least
they were now mostly level. That thought fled her mind when she felt the rush of
moisture as Seven’s muscles spasmed around her fingers and the former Borg
howled. B’Elanna rode out the waves of aftershocks inside, thinking that her
wife howled better than most Klingons.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered. Her body continued to shake. She reached down for
her wife and guided her up to her chest.</P>
<P>"I’m here." B’Elanna carefully settled next to her, making sure that her own
sore breasts didn’t press too hard against Seven’s ribs as they snuggled
together on what was left of their bed.</P>
<P>"Wow," Seven said with a sigh. Her face was flushed and she couldn’t stop
smiling. "Wow…"</P>
<P>"Now, you know how I felt," B’Elanna said smugly. She kissed Seven’s breast,
letting her fingers trace circles around the still hardened nipples.</P>
<P>"Wow…"</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and squeeze closer to her wife. "You are fixing the bed."
B’Elanna moved her fingers down and caressed one of the marks on Seven’s side.
</P>
<P>"Do that to me again and I will fix anything you want," Seven said with a
lazy grin.</P>
<P>"Again?" B’Elanna sat up and stared down at her wife.</P>
<P>"Again," Seven said. Her blue eyes burned with an inner spark and she took on
the look of the panther right before B’Elanna’s eyes.</P>
<P>"Don’t expect me to stop if you beg for mercy half way through," B’Elanna
said as she straddled Seven again. Her eyes darkened and she studied her wife’s
naked form.</P>
<P>Seven growled, lifting one corner of her lip into a predator’s snarl.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna said with a laugh. She collapsed onto Seven and playfully
mauled her neck, slowly becoming more serious as the tickling bites became
lingering kisses.</P>
<P>"Yours…always," Seven said happily.</P>

<P>"Federation law is very clear on this matter," the Doctor said. He handed the
captain a data padd. "There has been genetic tampering."</P>
<P>"Well, of course there was," Janeway said with a disgusted sigh. "They are
two women. They had to tamper with the genetic material to even conceive."</P>
<P>"I am aware of that," the Doctor snapped. "These are not those kinds of
irregularities. This child is perfect," he said as if that explained
everything.</P>
<P>"And?" Janeway demanded.</P>
<P>"Genetically perfect," Opaca said. "It is a statistical impossibility. There
isn’t so much as one chromosome with any defect. Nothing."</P>
<P>"And this is a problem…why?" Janeway leaned against the wall and studied the
readings on the padd. In the back of her mind her human genetics classes were
coming back to her. "There should be minor mistakes…on the molecular level," she
said quietly.</P>
<P>"Yes," the Doctor said. "And there should be traits that are recessive,
undesirable traits that should show up. There aren’t any."</P>
<P>"And this couldn’t be random chance?" Kathryn tapped the padd changing the
screen to a read out of Kayla Torres’ chromosome map.</P>
<P>"No," Opaca said quietly. She moved next to Kathryn and leaned against her
shoulder and pointed to a strand on the screen. "That’s a common pair there. It
determines eye color. With B’Elanna’s brown eyes, Kayla should have brown as
well. B’Elanna doesn’t carry a blue eye gene."</P>
<P>"And Kayla’s eyes are going to be blue?" Kathryn asked. She noticed that
Opaca’s matrix was very well designed; the hologram put off body heat.</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said. "Instead of using one chromosome from each parent…Kayla
somehow ended up doubling Seven’s on this gene. Her eyes will be exactly the
color of Seven’s."</P>
<P>"Why?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"They obviously tampered with her genetic code," the Doctor said. "And that
is illegal. From the looks of her chromosome map… every single trait has been
altered to the most perfect possible combination. I guess Seven took Borg
perfection a little too seriously. Lieutenant Torres should have known
better."</P>
<P>"You can’t honestly believe that B’Elanna and Seven did this intentionally?"
Janeway put the padd on his desk and gave the Doctor her most lethal glare.</P>
<P>"I don’t," Opaca said. "We know Seven used Borg technology to conceive. I
think the nanoprobes just did what Borg nanoprobes do…they make perfection."</P>
<P>"Really?" the Doctor asked sarcastically. "And since when do the Borg care
about eye color?"</P>
<P>Opaca rolled her eyes and stomped her foot. "You can be so stubborn," she
said. "There has been research that suggests blue eyed space travelers have less
space sickness. It’s one of the reasons so many Klingons get space sick. Most of
them have brown eyes."</P>
<P>"Pure speculation," the Doctor said. </P>
<P>"What difference could eye color possibly make?" Janeway asked. Opaca turned
to her and smiled warmly. It was very disarming and reminded Kathryn of someone
she knew but she couldn’t place who it was. </P>
<P>"Captain, eye color can effect sensitivity to sunlight, so why not the
effects of weightlessness?" Opaca asked. "Blue eyes are slightly more resilient
and hold their shape a bit better in zero G. That would effect space
sickness."</P>
<P>"You think the nanoprobes did all this… remapping?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"Impossible," the Doctor said. "I can’t believe that Seven and B’Elanna
didn’t have some control over this. It’s just too… perfect."</P>
<P>"Exactly," Opaca said as she tossed her hands into the air. "When mankind
tampers with genetics…they don’t ever do it well. All of the eugenics wars
showed us that. Any product of chromosomal tampering shows signs of genetic
problems in other areas. Usually mental instability, and Kayla doesn’t show any
defective genes. Not one. If Seven and B’Elanna did do this, she wouldn’t be so
perfect."</P>
<P>"What did they say?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Well, umm…." the Doctor looked away.</P>
<P>"You haven’t asked them?" Kathryn sighed and rolled her head back and rubbed
her neck. "Why not?"</P>
<P>"He wouldn’t let me," Opaca said. "And as long as he wasn’t endangering my
patient…my program won’t let me override him."</P>
<P>"Why don’t we ask them?" Janeway suggested. She shook her head. "Doctor, why
did you have to make this so difficult?"</P>
<P>"Protocol dictates that I speak with you so that we can prepare charges
against them. I can’t legally talk to them before I contact the authorities…and
here in the Delta Quadrant…that’s you."</P>
<P>"Lucky me," Kathryn said under her breath.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"It is my turn," Seven said as she climbed on top on B’Elanna. The former
drone had rested for all of six minutes and was now fully recharged.</P>
<P>"And just what are you going to do to me?" B’Elanna asked. She could feel
Seven’s wetness seeping through the silk of her nightgown. She wiggled and
looked up at Seven, her eyes sending a silent challenge.</P>
<P>"First, I must get this out of the way," Seven said as she hooked her finger
on the top of B’Elanna’s gown. She grabbed it with both hands and ripped it down
the front. "That is better." She leaned down and kissed the newly exposed
skin.</P>
<P>"Do you have any idea how many rations we waste when you do that?" B’Elanna
wrapped her hands around Seven’s waist.</P>
<P>"Do you care?" Seven moved her mouth to B’Elanna’s throat and kissed her
pulse point.</P>
<P>"Not at all." B’Elanna sighed happily.</P>
<P>Seven began nibbling on B’Elanna’s earlobe. "Do we still have the dermal
regenerator in the drawer?"</P>
<P>"Why? Did I hurt you?" B’Elanna pushed Seven up and tried to examine the
marks on her breast and side.</P>
<P>"No, my Be’nal," Seven said as she pressed B’Elanna’s hands above her head.
"But I intend to mark you where you most enjoy it, and we cannot leave those
marks or you will blush." She leaned down and bit the spot in question. B’Elanna
loved the feel of Seven sucking on her throat, high on her neck, far too high to
be hidden beneath a uniform.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said. She turned head exposing her neck and laughed. "You
know, you have a very large vampire streak in you, my love."</P>
<P>Seven moaned and sucked B’Elanna’s neck, then eased back. "Indeed?" she
asked, her voice taking on a perfect Transylvanian accent. "I intend to drink
more than your blood, my beloved."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and pulled Seven to her and kissed her nose. "How do you do
that?" she asked. "That sounds just like those awful movies from old Earth."</P>
<P>"I want to be accurate," Seven said in her vampire accent. Her eyes were
lidded and more seductive than any vampire. She kissed B’Elanna slowly, mapping
every inch of her mouth until both women were breathless.</P>
<P>"Do the Klingon vampire," B’Elanna begged.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow and smiled. "JachchoHmeH 'Iwraj penaghtaH," she said
in Klingonasse somehow managing to use perfect Klingon phrasing and grammar yet
using a distinctly Transylvanian accent.</P>
<P>"Promise?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"Now, in English," the Klingon giggled.</P>
<P>"I will pleasure you until your blood screams," Seven said with her
Transylvania accent. "Then I will drink you," she added.</P>
<P>"Right now." B’Elanna pulled Seven down to her. Seven’s kisses were gentle,
but commanding and always left B’Elanna feeling completely satisfied, yet always
wanting more. The Klingon lost herself in the contact and felt the familiar
flame burning deep in her belly.</P>
<P>Seven pulled away and moved to B’Elanna’s neck and began marking her wife.
Her lips wrapped around the sensitive flesh and she moaned as she sucked loudly.
"Mine," Seven whispered. She moved further down B’Elanna’s neck and bit her
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am," B’Elanna said happily.</P>
<P>After several minutes of enthusiastically marking both sides of B’Elanna’s
neck, Seven shifted her weight and settled next to her wife and caressed her
cheek. "I never knew making love could be so pleasurable on so many levels," she
said as she leaned over and kissed B’Elanna, biting her lower lip. "I had no
idea there would be so much laughter."</P>
<P>B’Elanna hooked her leg over Seven’s hip, urging her closer until their
bodies molded together. "It’s incredible with you…every time." She traced
Seven’s lips with her finger and then down her jaw to her implant. "All my life
I never knew what was missing, and now I do. You. You are my soulmate." She
leaned over and left a sweet, gentle kiss on Seven’s lips, easing back so that
she could look into her lapis blue eyes. "How could I have been so blind when we
first met? I thought you were cold and unemotional."</P>
<P>"I was." Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and kissed each knuckle. "I was hiding
from my soul. The Borg had it so completely buried that only a stubborn Klingon
could find it."</P>
<P>"You’re wrong, my beloved," B’Elanna whispered as her hand caressed Seven’s
chest, stopping to play with her bonding necklace. "You gave me back my soul. I
never laughed like this before. I was so serious in bed. I thought I had to be
some…some… Klingon ideal. I missed the point completely. I was having sex. I
never made love until I was with you."</P>
<P>"Perhaps…" Seven said as she leaned over and kissed B’Elanna on each side of
her mouth, "We could only awaken this in each other." She moved her kisses
closer and traced her wife’s lips with the tip of her tongue. "We are a puzzle
that can only be solved when we are joined." She nipped B’Elanna’s lip, seeking
entrance.</P>
<P>"My Borg poet." B’Elanna let Seven into her mouth. </P>
<P>They absorbed each other through their kisses, slowly, taking all the time in
the universe. Gradually their hands began to explore. B’Elanna mirrored each
touch of Seven’s hand, each fleeting caress becoming gentler until it was almost
a whisper on their skin. They both savored this type of lovemaking. It built a
fire slowly, the heat smoldering as they focused completely on the other’s
fingers to register the sensual flickering like a warm breeze across bare skin.
</P>
<P>Seven escalated the touches first, letting her hand trail over B’Elanna’s
belly and down to the wetness she longed to get lost in. Both women moaned at
the first contact, and Seven entwined her legs with B’Elanna’s so that her wife
could have equal access. Their kiss broke and they rested their faces on the
same pillow, inches apart, their eyes locked. Each twin caress escalated the
trembling as the bundles of nerves burst into white-hot flame. Each touch sent
both women closer to oblivion as they fell deeper into each other’s eyes.</P>
<P>Seven whimpered and her eyes half closed as she reached the peak first. She
fought against the fall, wanting to bring her wife with her into bliss. B’Elanna
felt the telltale flutters under her fingers and knew that Seven was holding
back, waiting for her.</P>
<P>"I love you, my Be’nal," B’Elanna whispered huskily as she slowed her
touch.</P>
<P>"Lana… I love you." Seven fought to get the words out. Her body cried out for
release but she needed to wait for her beloved. Her fingers slid lower, her
longer arms allowing her a better reach, and she dipped inside of B’Elanna and
the Klingon’s eyes rolled back as she moaned.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna whispered. Her fingers went back to the place she knew Seven
needed them and they both leaned their faces closer until their foreheads
touched as they fell.</P>
<P>Seven wrapped her arms around B’Elanna and pulled her close as they rode out
the aftershocks in a tender embrace. They took slow, ragged breaths as their
hearts slowed. They were silent. There was no need for words. Their connection
was so intense that it left them both with tears threatening to fall as they
drifted off into peaceful sleep.</P>
<P>Ten minutes later B’Elanna’s eyes shot open and she groaned. Seven opened her
eyes and pulled away and looked between them at the growing pool of milk
gathering on the sheets. Seven tried not to laugh, she really did, but it was
too much for her.</P>
<P>"Moo?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna gave her wife an answer. She hit her with a pillow and straddled
her, letting the leaking milk drip onto Seven’s belly. "This is not funny."</P>
<P>"Yes…it…is," Seven said as she tried to worm her way out from under B’Elanna.
</P>
<P>The Klingon tightened her knees, pinning the Borg in place.</P>
<P>Seven glanced over at the nightstand. "Are you certain that we could not use
the pump for a little…wife time?"</P>
<P>"Woman! You are a sex machine," B’Elanna said as she hit Seven with the
pillow again.</P>
<P>"Are you complaining?" Seven asked between hits.</P>
<P>"Hell, no." B’Elanna tossed the pillow off of the bed and leaned down to kiss
Seven. She was going to ignore the wetness from her milk between them, but the
chiming of the door made that a moot point.</P>
<P>"Send them away," Seven ordered when B’Elanna tried to sit up. Seven had her
firmly pinned to her chest.</P>
<P>"Let me up and I will." B’Elanna leaned closer and bit her wife’s lip.</P>
<P>"It is difficult to let you up when you are enticing me to keep you," Seven
said between kisses. The door chime sounded again.</P>
<P>"Let me up," B’Elanna offered, "And I will kill them with my bat’tleth. It
should only take two minutes."</P>
<P>Seven rolled B’Elanna over and climbed off of her. "It will only take me
thirty seconds."</P>
<P>"Seven…darling…" B’Elanna jumped up and ran after her wife. "Sweet Kahless,
you can’t really kill them."</P>
<P>Seven turned and raised an eyebrow at her wife. She handed her a tee shirt
and a pair of sweats since the Klingon’s robe was still in the living room.</P>
<P>"Okay… I knew you weren’t going to kill them," B’Elanna said as she pulled
the shirt over her leaking breasts.</P>
<P>"Go deal with… those," Seven said, pointing to the growing milk stains on the
tee shirt. "I will deal with whoever is at the door." Seven pulled on her own
robe and yanked the belt tight around her waist.</P>
<P>"How come I had to be the damn milk cow?" B’Elanna went to the dresser,
growling. She saw one of her shoes and kicked it across the room. "Stupid milk
cow."</P>
<P>Seven opened the door and glared at the captain. She quickly changed her
expression and stood up straight and linked her hands behind her back.</P>
<P>"Captain, how may I help you?" Seven asked formally.</P>
<P>"I need to talk to you and B’Elanna," Kathryn said. She looked at Seven and
noticed that her hair was not in its braid. It was a mess. It looked like she
had been sucked out of an airlock, and then Kathryn realized that whatever Seven
and B’Elanna had been doing, it was obviously a lot more strenuous than any
decompression. "I’m sorry to interrupt," she said as she cleared her throat.</P>
<P>"We were finished." Seven motioned for the captain to come in. "For the
moment," she added.</P>
<P>"I see," Kathryn said, though she really wished she didn’t understand the
implications of the statement. It was a miracle poor B’Elanna had survived three
years with Seven.</P>
<P>B’Elanna came out of the bedroom wearing a fresh tee shirt that didn’t have
milk stains ringing her breasts. "Captain?" she asked as she tried to casually
settle the nursing pads into place in her bra.</P>
<P>"Perhaps we could sit down?" Kathryn asked. She tried not to notice the
hickeys on both sides of B’Elanna’s neck. <I>‘Seven is going to kill her,</I>’
Kathryn thought as she sat on the couch. <I>‘I’m going to get a call from
sickbay and find B’Elanna dead…She’ll have a huge smile on her face…but she’ll
be dead.’ </P></I>
<P>"What is it?" Seven asked as she sat. B’Elanna sat beside her on the arm of
the couch. </P>
<P>"Kathryn, you’re scaring me. Is everything all right?" B’Elanna asked. Her
hand seemed to migrate onto Seven’s shoulder and she rubbed the tense muscles of
her wife’s neck.</P>
<P>"When Kayla was conceived, did you do anything unusual?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s face turned bright red and her eyes widened.</P>
<P>"Why? Seven asked. She reached up and linked her fingers with B’Elanna’s on
her shoulder. "What is wrong?"</P>
<P>"There are genetic irregularities," Kathryn said quietly.</P>
<P>"What’s wrong with her?" B’Elanna asked. "Why didn’t Opaca tell us?"</P>
<P>Seven’s face drained of color, the beautiful pink afterglow disappearing
completely as her face turned a chalky white.</P>
<P>"Nothing is wrong with her," Kathryn assured them. "That’s actually the
problem."</P>
<P>"Is she ill?" Seven asked in a whisper.</P>
<P>"No." Kathryn moved closer and rested her hand on Seven’s knee. "The problem
is that she is genetically perfect. Almost as if there was genetic
tampering."</P>
<P>"That’s illegal," B’Elanna said, confusion filling her voice. "And stupid.
Those scientists always screw something up when they mess with chromosomes."</P>
<P>"So… you two didn’t?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"No!" B’Elanna crinkled her face, showing her disgust. "Why would we do
that?"</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes…" Seven said quietly as she stood and moved away from the
couch. "It was my nanoprobes, wasn’t it?" She stared down at her Borg hand,
turning it as if studying a horrible disfigurement. </P>
<P>"That’s what Opaca thinks," Janeway said. "She thinks your nanoprobes
selected each genetic trait that was most beneficial and corrected any defects."
</P>
<P>"I have made my child… a Borg?" Seven asked as she moved further away.</P>
<P>"She’s not a Borg," B’Elanna insisted. She stood and went to Seven. "She’s
our child, and you didn’t do anything wrong."</P>
<P>"There isn’t anything wrong with her, Seven," Janeway said. "Opaca says the
worst thing you’ll have to face is that she’ll be smarter and more coordinated
than other children. That doesn’t sound too bad, now does it?"</P>
<P>"We already knew she was going to be smart," B’Elanna said as she hugged
Seven. "With us as her SoSoys how could she not be?"</P>
<P>"No one will know. I assure you." Kathryn moved over to the two women. "I
just had to make sure you two didn’t do this intentionally."</P>
<P>"Why would we?" Seven asked. "Why would anyone make their child…different? I
know the pain of that. I would never make my child endure that…and yet…I
have."</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna said as she rubbed Seven’s back. "It’s going to be fine.
We will get through this." She turned to Kathryn. "How smart are we talking?"
B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Opaca said that she can’t be any smarter than the genetic material you two
supplied. The nanoprobes just…stacked the deck in her favor." Kathryn gave
B’Elanna a half grin and nodded toward Seven. "I’d say that means pretty damn
smart."</P>
<P>"They did not… alter her genes?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No, they just gave her the best of what there was to work with," Kathryn
said with a smile. "Of course, given who her moms are…I think that’s still an
unfair advantage."</P>
<P>"If they chose the best of the material," Seven said. "Kayla would look
exactly like B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Hey, I’m kinda’ partial to your looks," B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>"Well, she will have Seven’s blue eyes," Kathryn volunteered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled. "I love your eyes," she said as she turned to Seven.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, are you sure Kayla will be normal?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"She will not be any more intelligent or strong than either of you. She will
have the advantage of having every gene being perfect." Kathryn moved closer.
"All things considered, I think that is a pretty nice legacy."</P>
<P>"I still think Opaca should have told us." Seven pulled B’Elanna’s arms
around her waist.</P>
<P>"The Doctor wouldn’t let her," Kathryn explained.</P>
<P>"What is wrong with him?" B’Elanna said with a growl.</P>
<P>"Calm down," Kathryn said. "I had a long talk with him today. And I’m meeting
Opaca in my quarters when I finish here. I want her to be free to override the
Doctor’s decisions even when it isn’t a matter of life and death."</P>
<P>"She must have been troubled by not being able to tell us," Seven said
quietly. "She cares very much for us…and Kayla."</P>
<P>"Yes, she does," Kathryn said. "And that’s something else that troubles me.
She isn’t supposed to have feelings at all."</P>
<P>"She acts as if she was programmed with emotions," B’Elanna said. "I just
thought Harry did a really good job mimicking feelings…but she seems… like
there’s more to it."</P>
<P>"She is certainly better adjusted than the Doctor," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Adjusted or not," Kathryn said grimly. "She isn’t supposed to feel anything.
I may not be an expert with holographic matrixes, but that woman has feelings."
Kathryn sighed and rubbed her forehead. "I’ll leave you two alone. I have to go
get to the bottom of this."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Kathryn. I am glad you told us," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Yes, thank you," B’Elanna added. </P>
<P>"You’re welcome," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>Seven walked Kathryn to the door and waved as she left. She turned and looked
into B’Elanna’s eyes and then ran to her.</P>
<P>"Shh, love." B’Elanna held Seven to her. "It’s gonna’ be okay. Kayla is
healthy. She’s gonna’ be fine."</P>
<P>"I am sorry," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>"Don’t be sorry." B’Elanna squeezed her tighter. "Without your nanoprobes, we
wouldn’t even have our beautiful daughter. Don’t ever apologize for that."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and sniffled as B’Elanna held her.</P>

</table>

<P>Kathryn Janeway returned to her quarters and wondered what she was going to
do about her two medical holograms. The Doctor seemed to be blowing a
holographic fuse and Opaca seemed to be having genuine emotions. Kathryn was not
a happy captain. She decided that if she had to have a ‘sensitive chat’ with a
hologram, she could at least be comfortable. She had just finished changing into
a pair of charcoal grey slacks and creme colored blouse when the door
chimed.</P>
<P>"Hello," Opaca said, smiling shyly when Kathryn opened the door. She seemed
slightly uneasy roaming the decks using the Doctor’s holo-emitter.</P>
<P>"Thank you for coming. Won’t you come in?" Kathryn led the short hologram to
the couch. "Would you like to sit? I’m sorry, I not even sure if you’re…umm…
programmed to socialize. What can I do to make you more comfortable?"</P>
<P>Opaca flopped down on the couch and shook her head. She had a half smile on
her lips. "Kathryn, I am a hologram. I don’t get uncomfortable… but thank
you."</P>
<P>"You certainly seemed uncomfortable when I came to sickbay today." Kathryn
sat next to her and curled one leg up under the other. "You seemed very
upset."</P>
<P>"I am programmed to appear as if I am experiencing concern." Opaca shifted
her weight and her eyes drifted as she looked around the room. Her eyes stopped
on a sculpture near the window and for a moment she looked very sad. "I am just
a tool, Kathryn, a piece of machinery like the transporter or your
replicator."</P>
<P>"I’ve seen holograms expressing programmed emotions. Yours seemed
more…genuine. Why do you think that is?" Kathryn could have said more didn’t.
She didn’t ask if Seven had spoken to Opaca, because the hologram’s reference to
the replicator was just like a conversation the captain had once had with the
former drone when they had quarreled about the Doctor’s sentience. She also
didn’t point out how she knew so much about holograms and faked emotions. The
Fairhaven disaster was still new in her mind. That was one can of Anterian
footlong worms she didn’t want to open.</P>
<P>Opaca paused before answering, then looked Kathryn in the eyes. Her deep
brown holographic eyes flickered with intensity. "Perhaps I am just a well
designed program. If you were to deactivate me… nothing would be lost except a
projection of light and energy."</P>
<P>"We’d lose more than that." Kathryn studied Opaca’s small hands. The hologram
was nervously wringing one hand with the other in her lap. "Seven and B’Elanna
care a great deal for you. They’d miss you, and so would the other patients
you’ve taken on."</P>
<P>"I think the world of Seven and B’Elanna," Opaca said with a wistful smile.
"As for the other patients…I don’t think the Doctor is very pleased about that
development."</P>
<P>"It’s only natural that the women of the crew would want a female physician
for their more…personal exams," Kathryn said as she cleared her throat. "I was
going to ask you to do my yearly physical next month," she added with a rueful
grin.</P>
<P>"You never volunteer for exams," Opaca said, looking honestly shocked. "Are
you ill?" She edged closer and took Kathryn’s wrist. Her touch was warm and
gentle as she moved her finger to the pulse point.</P>
<P>"No, just getting a bit less stubborn in my old age." Kathryn studied the
hand holding hers. "How do you know about my past aversion to physicals?"</P>
<P>Opaca looked up, for a moment her eyes were like a lamb looking at a lion,
and then she relaxed. "I am familiar with all of the crew’s medical
records."</P>
<P>For the first time since she had met the feisty hologram, Kathryn didn’t
believe her. "Are you sentient?"</P>
<P>Opaca laughed and leaned back into the couch. "I am sentient enough to know
that I am not sentient," she said as looked over at the captain. "Kathryn, the
Doctor was activated for several months before he showed any signs of sentience.
He also wanted to grow that way. Harry programmed me so that I don’t even want
to be sentient."</P>
<P>"Then he didn’t do a very good job." Kathryn’s eyes narrowed as she sent a
silent challenge to the other woman. "Because you are more sentient than the
Doctor, and you seem more human than he ever has."</P>
<P>"Don’t you mean Bajorian?" Opaca asked with an impish grin, trying to change
the subject.</P>
<P>"You know what I mean." Kathryn picked up Opaca’s hand and squeezed it. "You
have a pulse and body heat…and before you tell me that you were programmed to…I
don’t buy that answer. I’ve been…very close to a hologram, and they don’t feel
like this."</P>
<P>"I think this is about your experience with Sullivan. You are uncomfortable
because you like another hologram. It’s okay to have a holographic friend,
Kathryn." Opaca smiled warmly.</P>
<P>"Neither Harry nor the Doctor call me Kathryn. They wouldn’t have programmed
you to take such liberties. Why do you feel so comfortable doing it? And why
does it…feel right? I am very careful about whom I give permission to do that."
Kathryn raised an eyebrow and shook her head. "I never gave you that
permission."</P>
<P>"Maybe I’m just pushy," Opaca suggested.</P>
<P>"There are plenty of pushy people on this crew. None of them take that
liberty." Kathryn leaned back and studied Opaca. "Even Neelix, who doesn’t
always have a firm grasp on Starfleet custom, doesn’t call me by my first
name."</P>
<P>Opaca smiled at the mention of Neelix and she closed her eyes and bent her
head forward, as if remembering some private joke. "Neelix has rough edges but
he is not pushy…just… persistent," she said when she looked up.</P>
<P>"How do you know?" Kathryn challenged. "I’ve never seen you really talk to
him. In fact…when he is in the room…you avoid him." Kathryn’s eyes widened as an
idea formed in the back of her mind but she wasn’t quite ready to believe it
yet. Still, there were nagging clues. Opaca knew things that she shouldn’t about
the crew, especially Kathryn. Opaca had a gentle spirit that Kathryn recognized.
"Who are you?" she asked, her voice thick with emotion.</P>
<P>"I am a holo-…"</P>
<P>"Don’t lie to me," Kathryn said as she leaned closer and took Opaca’s hand.
"Who are you? You are not a hologram that only came into existence a few months
ago."</P>
<P>"You’re mistaken." Opaca pulled away and stood.</P>
<P>"You’re not one of the Q, that’s for sure," Kathryn said as she stood. "But
you are more than a projection of light and energy." She moved up behind Opaca
and rested a hand on her shoulder. "Who are you?" she asked in a whisper.</P>
<P>Opaca sighed and shook her head. "I am energy and light… just not all of it
is holographic," she finally said. "I never wanted to disturb this ship…this
crew." She turned and smiled warmly at the captain. "And I certainly never
wanted to make your life more complicated, Kathryn."</P>
<P>"Kes?" Kathryn whispered as she touched the hologram’s cheek. "My God, how
could I have missed it?"</P>
<P>A single tear slipped out of the hologram’s eye and fell from her cheek. It
disappeared as soon as it left her matrix, unable to stay cohesive once
separated from her holographic body.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tach opened the door to his quarters and was startled when Seven barged in
and rushed past him followed closely by B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"I didn’t expect to see you two this soon," he said as he turned.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Nara asked, concerned by the fear in her friend’s eyes. The former
drone went to the portable sleeper next to the couch and gently scooped Kayla
out of it. The baby was sleeping, but even deep in the arms of Morpheus, she
knew her mama. She whimpered happily and snuggled into Seven’s chest.</P>
<P>"We just needed to see her." B’Elanna went behind Seven and wrapped her arms
around the willowy blonde. Seven seemed fragile, and B’Elanna felt almost as if
she were holding her wife from falling to pieces.</P>
<P>Seven hummed quietly as she rubbed Kayla’s back and inhaled her fresh, clean,
baby scent. "We needed to make sure she was all right," Seven whispered as she
turned to face Nara.</P>
<P>"She’s fine," Nara said as she went to Seven. "She was absolutely
perfect."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes darkened and shined with tears as she inhaled sharply. </P>
<P>B’Elanna’s hugged Seven tighter and murmured in her ear. "It’s just an
expression, love."</P>
<P>"What’s wrong?" Tach asked, quickly moving closer.</P>
<P>"Nothing…" Seven said. Her voice was pained and wounded. "There is nothing
wrong with her all."</P>
<P>"Then I think you’d better explain why you look like that’s a bad thing,"
Nara said as she squeezed Seven’s arm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a brief explanation of the problem, Nara sat on the couch and shook her
head. "Leave it to you two to beat the system." Nara smiled warmly at her
friends. "It isn’t enough that you name your child after that perfect Klingon of
yours, you had to have her be perfect as well."</P>
<P>"We named her Kayla to honor her Klingon side and because we wanted to thank
Kahless for the miracle of her birth." Seven gave Nara and indignant glare. "We
would rather she be normal."</P>
<P>"Seven, she’s not abnormal," Nara pointed out. "She just doesn’t have any
defects to worry about."</P>
<P>"I would think you’d be happy," Tach said. "From the way you described these
nanoprobes, this is a minor problem considering all that could have gone wrong.
You should be thankful that your child is healthy."</P>
<P>"We are," B’Elanna said. She rubbed Seven’s back with her hand as she spoke.
"We just didn’t want Kayla to face anymore prejudice than she already will."</P>
<P>"It is bad enough that she has a Borg mother," Seven said quietly.</P>
<P>"Seven, my beloved," B’Elanna said with a sad smile. "I meant because she’s
one quarter Klingon."</P>
<P>"So?" Seven asked. "I wish she could be more like you."</P>
<P>"And I wish she could be more like you." B’Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"Enough," Nara said as she stood. "If you two don’t start being thankful for
the glorious gift of the goddess that this darling little girl is, I will take
her and raise her as mine. Tach and I won’t whine about what she isn’t. We will
love her for who she is." Nara tried to take Kayla, but Seven backed away.</P>
<P>"We do love her," Seven said angrily.</P>
<P>"We wouldn’t change her at all." B’Elanna stepped in front of Nara.</P>
<P>"Good," Nara said as she crossed her arms over her chest. "Now that we have
that settled… maybe you two can quit complaining and just love my niece."</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and shook her head. "You really are good at getting to the
heart of the matter, aren’t you?"</P>
<P>"Don’t even try to argue with her," Tach said. "This woman never loses."</P>
<P>"You are right," Seven said. "We are focusing on the wrong thing. Kayla is
all that matters and we love her exactly the way she is."</P>
<P>"Now," Nara said as she moved past B’Elanna. "Let me hold my little
sweetheart." She held her arms out.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said slowly. "But you had better give her back."</P>
<P>"Maybe." Nara smiled. "But I think she likes me," Nara added as she rocked
the sleeping child. "I always have wanted a boy and a girl."</P>
<P>"Then I suggest you speak to Tach," B’Elanna said. She wrapped her hands
around Seven’s waist. "Because we aren’t parting with ours. Tell Tach to toss
some X chromosomes your way."</P>
<P>"Like he ever listens," Nara said with a smirk.</P>
<P>Tach opened his mouth to answer but a muted beep from a small device on the
table cut him off. He jumped to his feet and headed toward the bedroom. </P>
<P>"Oh no you don’t," Tach said as he activated the lights.</P>
<P>B’Elanna followed as Nara handed the baby to Seven and then went to turn off
the beeping alarm. The lights came on and Ty turned toward them with a
determined look on his face. He saw the newcomers and squealed happily.</P>
<P>"Evan! Ba!" He ran toward them, dropping a data padd onto the floor.</P>
<P>"What are you up to, my son?" Tach scooped Ty up before he could get to his
aunts.</P>
<P>"Ty fixing." He squirmed to get down. "Ba," Ty said insistently as he reached
out for his beloved Klingon.</P>
<P>"Give him to me." B’Elanna smiled. "How’s my little tiger?" she asked as she
took him. He hugged her with his legs squeezing as tight as he could.</P>
<P>"Ba, no go away," he said when he loosened his grip.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry, tiger." B’Elanna kissed his forehead. "We have been pretty busy
with the baby."</P>
<P>"Evan’s baby is out. Kay-ya out now." Ty pointed to the former drone.</P>
<P>"Yep," B’Elanna said. She went over to her wife. "Kayla is your cousin." She
leaned against Seven’s shoulder so that Ty could get a good look at Kayla.</P>
<P>"Kay-ya leeping," he whispered.</P>
<P>Seven leaned into B’Elanna and kissed Ty’s head. "Yes, and you should be
sleeping as well."</P>
<P>"Ty fix," he explained.</P>
<P>"My son," Tach said as he took Ty from B’Elanna. "You leave the fixing to
your Fa, is that understood?"</P>
<P>"Ty fix." His sparkling brown eyes were determined and the stubborn
expression on his face looked exactly like Nara.</P>
<P>"No," Tach said. "Ty sleep."</P>
<P>"Ty go to Evan," he suggested.</P>
<P>"Ty is going back to bed," Tach said as he went to the sleeper in the corner.
B’Elanna followed, curiously looking over the small device that was circling
Ty’s sleeping area.</P>
<P>"Ty go to Ba." He squirmed as Tach put him under the covers.</P>
<P>"Tyranlanar, you are going to sleep," Tach said gently.</P>
<P>"What’s that?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Motion detector." Tach tucked in his son. </P>
<P>"Well, that’ll at least let you know when he gets loose." B’Elanna
laughed.</P>
<P>"Keep laughing, Just wait ‘til Kayla starts <I>fixing</I> things. I’m betting
that those Borg nanoprobes valued engineering skills. Kayla is gonna’ be fixing
things in no time."</P>
<P>"Ty help Kay-ya fix." Ty sat up and looked at Kayla in Seven’s arms.</P>
<P>"Oh, sweet Kahless." B’Elanna’s face paled.</P>
<P>"Kayla will not <I>fix</I> anything," Seven said with complete certainty. "We
will simply explain to her that she should not touch things unless she has our
permission."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah," Nara said as she began giggling. "That’ll work."</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow at Nara and shifted Kayla onto her shoulder.</P>
<P>Nara straightened her shoulders and gave Seven a half grin that looked just
like Kathryn when she was being sarcastic. "Janeway to Torres…" Nara said in a
very good impersonation of the captain’s deadliest tone. "Your daughter just
ejected the warp core…again." </P>
<P>"Oh, god." B’Elanna looked at her daughter. "We are in so much trouble."</P>
<P>"Yeah, you are," Tach agreed with a huge toothy grin.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway stared at the hologram that looked nothing like her dear
friend Kes, and yet, when she looked into her brown eyes, eyes too dark to be
Kes, she could see some spark that was the Ocampa. All of the questions about
where Kes had been and how she had gotten into the hologram didn’t matter. This
was Kes. Kathryn grabbed her and pulled her into an embrace, squeezing the
smaller woman.</P>
<P>"Kes," she whispered. "I’ve missed you so much." Kathryn’s voice cracked.</P>
<P>"I know," the hologram whispered. "I never meant to hurt you." She held onto
Kathryn, inhaling as she buried her face in the older woman’s hair.</P>
<P>"How?" Kathryn asked as she eased back. "How are you even here?"</P>
<P>"I…I was existing as pure energy, but I could see this reality. I tried to
contact you. Nothing I did worked." Opaca backed away and paced, hugging her
arms to her chest like Kes used to always do. "Not even Tuvok could sense me. I
saw all of the pain my leaving caused, and I wanted so much to help you."</P>
<P>"You’ve been watching us this whole time?" Kathryn asked. She moved closer,
studying the hologram’s movements.</P>
<P>"Not exactly." Opaca went to the couch and sat, waiting for Kathryn to join
her. "When you exist as energy, thought and action merge…one becomes the other.
If I wondered how my family and friends were doing on the homeworld, I was
suddenly there. I would stay there for a while, but at some point…I would miss
my home. Any thought of home transported me right back here…with you."</P>
<P>Kathryn nodded. "How much did you see?"</P>
<P>"Enough," she answered. "When I first changed, I watched you interact with
Seven. I knew there was something there…and I chose to go see what was happening
in the rest of the universe."</P>
<P>"You were uncomfortable seeing me with Seven?" Kathryn sighed and rubbed her
temples. "When Seven and B’Elanna came back married, it hurt incredibly. Nothing
had hit me that hard in years…not since…" her voice trailed off.</P>
<P>"Not since I left?" the hologram asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Kathryn whispered. She looked down at the cushions of the couch.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, I didn’t have a choice." The hologram reached out and lifted
Kathryn’s chin. "I didn’t want to go."</P>
<P>"How did you come back?" Kathryn asked as she enjoyed the warmth of the hand
cupping her chin.</P>
<P>Opaca laughed, and there was a lyric quality to the sound that was pure Kes.
"I wasn’t even sure I could merge with the hologram. It just occurred to me when
I was watching the Doctor and Harry constructing the matrix…that a hologram was
energy and light…just like me. Once they activated the program, I just bonded
with the energy matrix."</P>
<P>"Why doesn’t your energy disappear when the program deactivates?" Kathryn
asked. Her scientist's mind was scrambling, trying to grab any hard facts that
could explain the miracle. </P>
<P>"I have gotten pretty used to containing my energy, Kathryn." The hologram
sighed. "When I first left, and I used my energy to send <I>Voyager</I> clear of
Borg space…I was dazed for weeks. I was scattered across the entire distance
that I had moved <I>Voyager</I>. I don’t know that it was such a great idea."
She smiled sadly.</P>
<P>"You saved us all." Kathryn took the hologram’s hand in hers. "We would have
been assimilated for sure. Thank you."</P>
<P>"You’re welcome," Opaca smiled.</P>
<P>"But you seem different," Kathryn said. "You were swearing in sickbay…you
never swore before."</P>
<P>"That’s Opaca," she replied, rolling her eyes. "When I merged with the
matrix, I picked up a lot from her personality subroutines. I like to think she
added a bit of a spark to my own personality."</P>
<P>"So…are you Opaca…or Kes?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"Both…neither…somewhere in the middle," the hologram said. "When I first
merged with this matrix I couldn’t even control the program. I was just sort of
along for the ride. Then, as time passed, I became more comfortable with the
matrix and started to be able to effect its…our…actions."</P>
<P>"What about now?" Kathryn asked. "Are you…Kes…in complete control?"</P>
<P>"Yes," the hologram said. "I am functioning within the matrix. Right now the
Opaca program and I have completely merged. Her personality has become a part of
me. Although…I sometimes think that isn’t always for the best. I used to be a
lot more forgiving of the Doctor."</P>
<P>"You do seem to have developed quite a temper," Kathryn said ruefully.</P>
<P>"Bajoran are known for that," Opaca said. "That temper has been the biggest
adjustment."</P>
<P>"What about the Doctor?" Kathryn asked. "Do you know what’s going on with
him?"</P>
<P>"Kathryn, he’s been through so much, and he doesn’t have anyone to talk to."
The hologram took Kathryn’s hand. "You helped him over his breakdown when he
remembered Ensign Jetty’s death… you and the crew did everything they could, but
he’s lost so much."</P>
<P>"We want to help him, Ke…Opa… I’m not sure what to call you," Kathryn
admitted.</P>
<P>"Call me Opaca. It will be best for everyone."</P>
<P>"Okay." Kathryn said warmly. "Opaca, we want to help him. But he has to let
us in."</P>
<P>"Think of all he’s lost." Opaca shook her head as she thought of the many
years the Doctor had been activated. "All his attempts to forge a romantic or
emotional bond have ended in heartbreak. He fell in love with a hologram from
the Beowulf program…she was the one who called him Schweitzer. She was killed.
He fell in love with Denara Pel, the doctor afflicted with the Phage, and he
lost her. Then when he tried to create a holographic family…"</P>
<P>"His daughter," Kathryn said as she remembered. "She died."</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said. "From there…well, he had feelings for me…and I left him.
And we can’t forget the fact that he is in love with Seven."</P>
<P>"She tends to inspire that," Kathryn said ruefully.</P>
<P>"Yes, she does." Opaca smiled, her brown eyes twinkling. "She’s an amazing
young woman."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna’s very lucky," Kathryn added.</P>
<P>"So is Seven," Opaca pointed out. "Those two are completely devoted to each
other. Though I was amazed when I first saw them together."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>Opaca stood and walked to the window and looked out at the beautiful stars.
"Do you remember when Seven left <I>Voyager</I>, convinced that there was a
shipwide conspiracy against her?" She touched the cool transparent aluminum.</P>
<P>"Yes." Kathryn stood and went to the hologram’s side.</P>
<P>"I thought that you had finally come to your senses," Opaca said wistfully.
"I was there, with you when you bent down on one knee and asked her to stay."
She turned to Kathryn. "I thought you were ready to explore the feelings that
were growing between the two of you."</P>
<P>Kathryn shook her head. "I made a strategic retreat."</P>
<P>"You ran like a frightened child," Opaca corrected.</P>
<P>"I prefer my term," Kathryn said with a frown. "Why did you bring this
up?"</P>
<P>"It was difficult for me to see you…with her." Opaca leaned against the cool
glass, pressing her forehead against it, enjoying the sheer physicality of the
action. She pulled back and looked into Kathryn’s eyes. "I left. I didn’t want
to watch that. I came back expecting to see you and Seven in middle of a torrid
affair. I was surprised when I saw you with a hologram, and completely stunned
when Seven returned… married to B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Imagine what a shock it was to me." Kathryn sighed. </P>
<P>Opaca laughed. "I can only imagine. I was so shocked to see you with…that…"
She continued laughing. "I came back once while you were…with him."</P>
<P>"Oh, lord," Kathryn said as she covered her eyes. "Please tell me you didn’t
‘see’ me with that hologram."</P>
<P>"Of course not," Opaca said with a smirk. "I left as soon as I realized…"</P>
<P>"Oh, god, you did." Kathryn rubbed her temples as she felt herself blush.</P>
<P>"Anyway," Opaca said, trying to shift the conversation. "When I saw how much
you were hurting…I wanted to be there for you. Then, when Seven almost lost the
baby, I saw my chance with this," she said as she pointed to her holographic
body. "By merging with the matrix I had the opportunity to help the crew without
complicating things."</P>
<P>"Until I ruined your little party," Kathryn said with a half grin.</P>
<P>"I never could fool you," Opaca said. "Although, it sure took you long
enough." She smiled warmly at her friend.</P>
<P>"I wasn’t completely on my game," Kathryn said. "I was a little preoccupied
with that Sullivan…thing…and then with getting used to Seven and B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"I’m sorry I had to deceive you." Opaca rested her hand on Kathryn’s
shoulder. "I just didn’t want to hurt anyone…if the crew found out…it could be
painful."</P>
<P>"You mean Neelix," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Yes. He and I came to an understanding that we were not on the same path…
even before I…left, but he still cares for me a great deal." She smiled as she
closed her eyes. "He talks to me all the time. Tells me about his days,
discusses new recipes and even tells me goodnight." Opaca looked at Kathryn. "I
think he would be very hurt if I suddenly reappeared and didn’t want to be with
him."</P>
<P>"What do you want?" Kathryn asked. She covered Opaca’s hand with her own.</P>
<P>"I missed you all. I didn’t like floating around the cosmos. It was so
scattered. Being in this matrix has allowed me to be grounded and it feels
wonderful." Opaca sighed and squeezed Kathryn’s arm.</P>
<P>"But what do you want?" Kathryn asked again, her voice a low whisper.</P>
<P>"I want to be home," Opaca whispered. She tilted her head forward and
holographic tears slid down her cheeks.</P>
<P>"Kes," Kathryn whispered. "Opaca, you are welcome here as long as you want to
stay, and I will do everything I can to help keep your secret. Although, I think
Neelix would be thrilled to have you back in any form. I know I am."</P>
<P>Opaca nodded, but didn’t look up. Kathryn cupped her chin and lifted her
face.</P>
<P>"I am so glad you are back," Kathryn said. She looked into Opaca’s deep brown
eyes and studied the grin that made her heart ache. She had missed Kes’ smile.
Before she realized what she was doing Kathryn leaned forward and brushed her
lips across Opaca’s. She was warm and welcoming and nothing like the Sullivan
hologram. Opaca felt real and Kathryn could feel the emotion welling up in her
partner. Opaca whimpered and moved closer to Kathryn. She wrapped her arms
around Kathryn’s waist but was shocked to feel the older woman pull away.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry," Kathryn said as she touched her lips. She could still feel the
warmth of Opaca’s kiss. "I shouldn’t have done that."</P>
<P>"Why?" Opaca asked. "I’ve been waiting for that kiss for almost seven
years."</P>
<P>Kathryn raised both eyebrows high onto her forehead and then chuckled
nervously. "I certainly didn’t expect to be kissing another hologram."</P>
<P>"How about if we…play it by ear?" Opaca asked as she tilted her head down and
looked up coyly at Kathryn through her lashes.</P>
<P>Kathryn smiled, this time warmly. "Speaking of ears…I really miss yours."</P>
<P>Opaca tugged at her ear, smiling. "I like them. I can wear earrings now.
Before…they didn’t look right on me, and I think the ridges are quite
becoming."</P>
<P>"They are," Kathryn agreed. "In any form, I am so glad you are here."</P>
<P>"So am I," Opaca said. She held out her arms and Kathryn welcomed the
embrace. Both women held on tight, enjoying the warmth. They stayed that way for
several minutes, neither knowing where their lives would take them, but both
knowing that their futures had just gotten a great deal brighter.</P>
<P>When they broke apart, Kathryn got herself of cup of coffee and then sat next
to Opaca on the couch. </P>
<P>"Now, tell me everything you saw," Kathryn said as she settled into the
welcoming cushions. "What wonders of the universe did you see?"</P>
<P>"This could take a while." Opaca leaned back against the arm of the couch.
She looked at her shoes, then flickered briefly and her feet morphed and the
shoes were gone. She stretched her sock-covered toes and sighed. "Might as well
get comfortable."</P>
<P>"By all means," Kathryn said. She held her cup in one hand and used the other
to guide the hologram’s feet onto her lap. "Now, tell me everything."</P>
<P>"Well, I got to see a forming gas giant hit by an interstellar string. It was
beautiful," Opaca said. She enjoyed the feeling of Kathryn’s hand resting on her
feet.</P>
<P>"Fascinating," Kathryn said as she prepared for a very long night. "Can you
describe it?"</P>
<P>Opaca nodded and began sharing all of the adventures she had witnessed on her
travels around the universe.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Epilogue:</P>
<P>It was dark, but Kayla was warm and happy. It had taken her days to train her
two mamas that she didn’t want to sleep alone in the tiny, lonely bed in the
other room. Kayla opened her eyes, and squeaked. She was in the mama-bed. It was
warm, with the milk-mama on one side quietly snoring, and the singing-mama on
the other side. The milk-mama was warm, almost hot, and she smelled of love,
while the singing-mama was soft and sweet and her chest vibrated when she sang
or hummed. Kayla loved being in the mama-bed with the two halves of her universe
on either side. She would wake up, but she wouldn’t cry. There wasn’t any reason
to be upset at all. Both her mamas were next to her and the singing-mama seemed
to sense when Kayla would wake. The singing-mama would rest her hand on Kayla’s
belly, rubbing softly to soothe her loneliness in the night. Sometimes the
singing-mama would move one finger up near Kayla’s face so she could suck on it.
It didn’t yield milk like the other mama’s breast, but it was soothing and she
would drift off to sleep.</P>
<P>Kayla’s eyes were bright and darted around the room as the light of the
morning shift began coming up. Her mamas slept snuggled up close to her, each
one carefully draping their arm over her so that they could touch each other.
Kayla felt warm and safe and most of all she felt loved. She wiggled her tiny
toes and squeaked as she felt the milk-mama lean over toward her.</P>
<P>"Shh, little one," B’Elanna whispered as she kissed her daughter’s tiny
ridges. "You stay quiet and don’t wake your mama." She moved away, leaving the
cooling sheets in her place. </P>
<P>Kayla did not like it when one of her mamas was gone. It felt like part of
her world was missing, and the mamas didn’t seem quite as happy when one of them
was away. She kicked her feet in protest, not liking the way the bed seemed only
half full.</P>
<P>Seven sighed and she moved her hand onto Kayla’s belly. She rubbed slow,
small circles and Kayla stopped kicking and grabbed her mama’s fingers. Seven
reacted instantly, letting Kayla tug her finger higher until she began sucking
on Seven’s pinky. That definitely comforted her and she sucked harder, her tiny
lips smacking.</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes and yawned. She smiled, looking over at Kayla. "Good
morning," she whispered, and then looked over at the empty side of the bed.
"Where is your So’Soy? Hmm?" Seven shifted her weight and she reached under
Kayla to make sure that she was still dry. Seven had designed a moisture
detector for her diapers, but the former drone liked to be thorough.</P>
<P>"Good morning, love," B’Elanna said from behind Seven.</P>
<P>The former Borg twisted her head so that she could see her wife. B’Elanna
held out a steaming mug.</P>
<P>"Is that what I think it is?" Seven asked. Her eyes widened as she took the
cup with one hand, twisting so she didn’t have to disturb Kayla. She inhaled the
steam, moaning when the faint scent of raspberry hit her nostrils. "I love you,"
Seven said, then began gulping her beverage.</P>
<P>B’Elanna moved around the bed and crawled back under the covers. She scooped
up Kayla and cradled her in the crook of her elbow. "Your mama is a sucker for
raspberry tea. If you ever <I>fix</I> anything you aren’t supposed to, just
bring her some tea."</P>
<P>"And what did you do that warranted bringing me tea?" Seven asked. She smiled
as she watched B’Elanna rubbing noses with Kayla.</P>
<P>"Me?" B’Elanna asked. "Nothing. This is just me getting back into the swing.
Now that you’re not pregnant anymore…you can have all the tea you want. No
caffeine restrictions, love." Kayla nuzzled B’Elanna’s chest. "Hmm, looks like
someone else is thirsty." B’Elanna balanced Kayla as she opened her nightgown
and quickly helped her daughter begin breakfast.</P>
<P>Seven gulped down the last of her tea, then looked into the empty cup, her
expression crestfallen.</P>
<P>"Oh, love," B’Elanna said with a smirk. "You always do that."</P>
<P>"Do what?" Seven asked without looking up from her depressingly empty
mug.</P>
<P>"That…You always get so excited about your tea," B’Elanna said. "You just
gulp it down and then you sit there and stare into the cup… pouting." B’Elanna
cringed. "I think your daughter is getting her infant incisors." She had hoped
that Kayla would not have the extra set of teeth that all Klingon infants got.
It was another set of baby teeth that came in during the first month. They were
small, but extremely sharp.</P>
<P>"I do not pout," Seven said. She tilted the cup and sighed.</P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna turned toward the nightstand and then spun back around
holding out a small stasis teapot.</P>
<P>"I love you, my Be’nal," Seven said as her eyes sparkled. She took the pot
and filled her cup, setting the extra tea on her own nightstand. "You seem to be
getting the hang of that," Seven added when she turned back toward her wife.
B’Elanna was managing to balance Kayla in place with one arm while she
straightened the blanket.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well, Kayla has more suction than a blown out airlock. I don’t think I
could pry her loose with a hyper spanner."</P>
<P>"I cannot blame her. Your breasts are most…desirable." Seven sighed happily
as she sipped her tea.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned against Seven and rested her head on her wife’s shoulder. "I
love you, Seven," she whispered.</P>
<P>"And I love you, my beloved Be’nal," Seven said as she tilted her head and
kissed B’Elanna’s temple. She looked at Kayla and smiled, then leaned down
carefully and kissed the side of her face. Kayla smacked her lips, unwilling to
unlatch. "Kayla, my greatest wish is that you will someday find a love like
ours," she whispered.</P>
<P>"She will, my love," B’Elanna said. "Okay, little one, time to swap sides."
She shifted Kayla, trying to move her to the other breast, but Kayla clamped
down, unwilling to move just yet. "She doesn’t even listen to us," B’Elanna said
with a chuckle. "We are in so much trouble."</P>
<P>"She will listen. She is our daughter, and daughters listen to their mothers
and do what they are told." Seven put her cup down and wrapped her arm around
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven? Darling? How often do you or I do as we are told?" B’Elanna asked
sweetly. </P>
<P>There was a long paused as Seven processed that fact.</P>
<P>"Trouble is not an adequate word to describe what we are going to
experience," Seven said grimly.</P>
<P>"Nope," B’Elanna snuggled into Seven’s embrace, letting Kayla stay where she
was, firmly attached to her breast and not about to let go. Her tiny fists
grabbed onto the silky fabric of B’Elanna’s nightgown making certain that her
milk-mama didn’t escape. "We are so screwed," B’Elanna said, though she didn’t
seem upset by the idea.</P>
<P>"Well, we could be," Seven said as she smoothed Kayla’s auburn curls. "But
not in front of our daughter."</P>
<P>B’Elanna rolled her eyes.</P>
