</table>

<P>Seven of Nine stood in the pub and watched as a mere Hologram announced his
relationship with the captain. Her face remained unchanged for the most part,
with the exception of a slightly raised eyebrow. The rest of the crew present
showed their surprise in their expressions but they tried to act unaffected.
"Sullivan" was the holo-character’s name, and he had apparently been programmed
for drunken self-pity. Seven watched his display for a few moments and then
quietly excused herself from the Fairhaven program. </P>
<P>Tom Paris had created the program for the crew’s recreational enjoyment, but
Seven had not enjoyed it at all. In fact, the former Borg drone found the
holodeck a complete waste of time. Indulging in fantasies when there was work to
be done seemed an ineffective use of time. Now Seven had to face the fact that
not only did Captain Janeway find the holodeck an acceptable use of time and
resources, she apparently found its characters suitable for romantic
entanglement. </P>
<P>Seven made her way to the Astrometrics lab without speaking to any of the
crewmembers she passed, but that in itself was not new. She found superfluous
conversation almost as wasteful as spending time on the holodeck. Seven was a
commanding presence, with her tall, lanky build accented by her striking blonde
hair and blue eyes that alternated from an arctic blue to a deep cobalt
depending on her outfit and mood. The crewmembers that saw her this day saw a
young woman who looked much the same as the drone had when Janeway had first
rescued her from the Borg Collective. Her face was cold, her features harsh,
eyes deep blue and lifeless. Most assumed it was just another of her Borg moods,
some wondered if she was having a bad day, but none could have guessed she was
dealing with a broken heart.</P>
<P>Once she was safely inside the sterile confines of the Astrometrics lab,
Seven began cataloging the scans from the last few star systems <I>Voyager</I>
had passed through, trying desperately to get her mind off of the holographic
bartender from Fairhaven. No matter how many intricate equations she worked on,
she could not shake the images of Michael Sullivan touching the woman she loved.
The idea that Kathryn would let a hologram touch her, love her, when Seven was
aching to ease the captain’s loneliness, was physically painful. After two
hours, Seven gave up and went to regenerate.</P>
<P>Seven kept to herself even when an interstellar storm battered the ship, but
she had heard that the Fairhaven program was damaged, almost lost, yet it had
been saved. Most of the crew went to the grand reopening to celebrate, but there
were two notable exceptions. </P>
<P>Captain Janeway stayed away, warring with her own inner demons as she tried
to understand how and if she could have fallen in love with a hologram. She was
confused, and more than a little disgusted with herself since Michael Sullivan
wasn’t even a sentient hologram. He lacked the sophistication of the Doctor’s
program, unable to feel, or speculate, or to even understand his own existence.
The more Janeway thought about it, the more she realized that it wasn’t so much
Michael Sullivan she loved, but the idea of being in love. But that wasn’t
exactly true either. It was the idea of being in love with someone acceptable.
She had decided long ago that she couldn’t afford to get involved with any of
her crew, and her recent conversation with the Doctor had only reinforced that
belief. Starfleet allowed for captains to date crewmembers, but Kathryn had
never been one to cross that line. She had always had her own built-in safety
net, Mark, the ever-faithful fiancé, but now he had moved on. And to make
matters worse, she was not just captain, but the supreme Starfleet officer in
the Delta quadrant. So in effect, she <I>was</I> Starfleet command, and that
meant her dating a crewmember would have been like an admiral dating a cadet.
Janeway didn’t want to even consider crossing that bridge.</P>
<P>The other person who chose to miss the grand reopening was Seven of Nine. She
had decided that the only use she had for the holodeck was to play Velocity, and
even that didn’t interest her at the moment. Ever since she had discovered
Janeway’s "relationship" with the hologram she had avoided the holodeck and the
captain. Just the thought of either one caused the surprisingly fragile blonde’s
chest to constrict and her throat to feel painfully dry. Instead, Seven studied
the massive amounts of data she had recently collected when <I>Voyager</I> had
been trapped in orbit around a planet out of sync with the rest of the
universe’s timestream. She wished for a moment that she had beamed down to the
planet because in that timestream, she would have long since lived out her life,
and in fact would have been dead for centuries. She had heard that "time heals,"
and she wondered how much time must pass before simply thinking of Kathryn
wouldn’t make her feel like crying. She remembered when One had died. He had
been like her son, and she truly loved him, but his loss had not cut as deeply
and Kathryn’s decision to be with the hologram. Perhaps it was the difference
between losing someone to fate, and having them choose another.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Back on the holodeck, things were not going as expected. The bartender,
Seven’s rival, was drinking more ale than he was serving. He was drunk and
pining away for his Katie O’Clare. For the first ten minutes it had been almost
amusing, but it quickly progressed to downright annoying. The program had been
on-line less than a half-hour before Harry Kim deactivated the whining
bartender. From there, things went down hill. Tom Paris decided to run his
secondary beverage server. He activated Rebecca O’Toole, or "Becca", as she was
known. Becca’s most noteworthy "attributes" were her extremely large breasts,
her extremely revealing blouse, and her extreme willingness to share both.
Unfortunately for Tom Paris, he was enjoying all of Becca’s attributes when his
girlfriend B’Elanna Torres arrived. Tom’s head was buried inside Becca’s blouse
chasing an olive he had dropped down her cleavage moments before, and Becca was
all too eager to assist by arching her back and pushing her permanently erect
nipples into Tom’s face.</P>
<P>"Oh, Tommy, me boy," Becca said with a thick<FONT size=2> </FONT>brogue.
"You’ve gotta’ talented tongue. Would ye like ta’ come upstairs with me like ya’
di’ last night?" She pulled him toward the back of the bar and leaned against
the rough oak wall.</P>
<P>Tom’s hands were joining his mouth under the thin cotton blouse and his
boyish giggle was unmistakable. "I’m expecting someone tonight," he said. "But I
will take you up on that come the morrow," he answered in his version of the
local dialect.</P>
<P>"Oh, surely ye kin sneak away fer a few hours?" the hologram laughed.</P>
<P>What happened next was not entirely clear considering that those who were
close enough to actually see B’Elanna’s reaction were either knocked out of the
way, or rendered unconscious. The Klingon-human hybrid ended Becca’s short
holographic life with a quick snap of her slender neck. Though she had been only
a fantasy creation, her body made a satisfying thud as she crumpled to the
floor. Luckily for Tom Paris, Tuvok happened to be at the pub playing "rings"
because the Vulcan was the first person to reach Torres. Tuvok was hurled over a
nearby table, but his grip on B’Elanna’s arm caused her to tumble over the table
with him. The two struggled on the floor while Tom dove behind the bar counter.
Tuvok had B’Elanna in a headlock, but a well-placed elbow to his ribs doubled
him over long enough for the svelte engineer to escape. She was over the bar
counter in one leap, and Paris came flying back over the bar a split second
later. It would have been an impressive leap on Tom’s part, except he had not
propelled himself. B’Elanna had tossed him headfirst toward the "Rings" area and
then followed him with a deep growl. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway was in her quarters when she was called to sickbay. She was not
amused by what she found.</P>
<P>When Janeway entered sickbay the first thing she noticed was that every bed
was occupied. The second thing she noticed was that there was a security team
around one bed apparently having an impromptu wrestling match with someone.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway said with a take no prisoners whip of command in her
voice. "What the hell is going on?"</P>
<P>"Captain, there was an altercation in the Fair Haven program," Tuvok informed
her.</P>
<P>Janeway cringed, assuming Michael Sullivan was still pining for her. "And why
did the crew get involved?" she asked, motioning toward the crowded sickbay.</P>
<P>"The crew started it," the Doctor said as he looked up from Tuvok’s obviously
broken arm. "Why does everyone always blame the hologram?"</P>
<P>"Explain." the captain’s eyes narrowed.</P>
<P>"Ouch," Tom Paris yelled from a nearby bed. "Take it easy, Neelix."</P>
<P>"Maybe next time you won’t be so eager to help a hologram retrieve her lost
garnish," Neelix snapped at the bruised and battered helmsman.</P>
<P>Janeway took a step closer to Paris. "Am I to understand you started
this?"</P>
<P>"Pa’tak!" Torres yelled from across the room. "Let me go you son of a targh!"
</P>
<P>The captain turned in time to see Jensen, who was of the burlier security
officers, fly across the room.</P>
<P>"Get off of me!" B’Elanna yelled. "Let me finish what I started. Tom Paris
you Denivian slime devil, I’m gonna’ rip your heart out and feed it to you."</P>
<P>"Lieutenant!" Janeway barked as she made her way toward the pile of security
officers. "At ease, B’Elanna," she ordered.</P>
<P>Two of the security team shifted their focus toward the captain, one of them
got B’Elanna’s boot against his jaw for his lack of attentiveness, and the other
got her fist across his throat. Both men were dropped to their knees. Torres
scrambled to her feet and lunged toward Tom’s position when Janeway’s steely
glare froze her in place.</P>
<P>For a moment B’Elanna’s eyes darted over the captain’s wiry frame looking for
a way past her, but Janeway’s eyes hardened and she squared her stance letting
Torres know that she’d have to go through her commanding officer to get to her
target. </P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna said as she sighed and relaxed her own stance. Her
Klingon blood was in full battlelust, but she would never hit the compact woman
who blocked her path. They shared a long and respectful friendship, and B’Elanna
had come to see Janeway as something of a surrogate for the mother she hadn’t
seen in too many years.</P>
<P>"I think you’ve got some explaining to do," Janeway said. The security
officers managed to get back on their feet and quickly grabbed Torres by each
arm.</P>
<P>"Let me go," Torres demanded, yanking her arms free with relative ease.</P>
<P>"Are you going to restrain yourself?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Yes, Ma’am," Torres said through gritted teeth. The two security officers
looked to the captain and then stepped away when she nodded her approval.
B’Elanna sighed and ran her tongue over her teeth tasting blood, but she ignored
the more obvious trickle of blood making its way down her forehead.</P>
<P>"I’m waiting." Janeway’s voice was quiet and low, warning B’Elanna that she
wasn’t in the mood for any stalling.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes drifted to the deck plating. "Apparently Paris can’t keep it
in his pants. He’s screwing one of those holographic sluts. It’s bad enough that
he’s cheating on me, but with a hologram? He dishonored me, Captain. The whole
crew’s laughing at me."</P>
<P>"And you felt that action warranted putting half my crew in sickbay?" Janeway
kept her face calm, but inside cringed at the topic of sex with holograms.</P>
<P>"No, Ma’am. It didn’t involve any of them," Torres said motioning to the
crowded sickbay. "This was between that Pa’Tak and me," she explained, pointing
to Paris.</P>
<P>"I disagree," Tuvok said as he stepped beside the captain, his injuries
healed. "Had you been left to your own devices, I believe <I>Voyager</I> would
no longer have a helmsman for the alpha shift."</P>
<P>"Damn right," Torres said with a snort.</P>
<P>"That is unacceptable, Lieutenant," Janeway said, quickly silencing B’Elanna.
"I don’t care what Tom did or who he did it with. You will not physically accost
any member of this crew."</P>
<P>"But he dishonored me." Torres’ eyes flashed as she shifted her weight.</P>
<P>"Enough," Janeway said as she held up her hand. "You will sit down and wait
for your injuries to be treated and then you will go to the brig. Directly to
the brig, without stopping by Mr. Paris’ quarters, and you will wait there until
I can figure out what to do with you." Janeway released a disgusted sigh. "Is
that clear, Lieutenant?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna bit her lip and then looked into the captain’s slate blue eyes.
"Yes, Ma’am."</P>

<P>B’Elanna Torres suffered the least during her punishment. She spent three
weeks in the Brig reading technical manuals and Klingon history. She actually
enjoyed the time she spent alone. The rest of the crew struggled during her
absence. Most notably was Seven of Nine. With Torres out of Engineering, Vorik
had first been put in charge, but after the warp core decided to throw several
temper tantrums, Janeway put Seven in charge of the Engine room. The engines
were running at peak efficiency, but the Engineering staff didn’t seem to enjoy
being giving Borg designations. </P>
<P>Seven looked up from the personnel reports when she heard the doors to
Engineering hiss open. She sighed and focused on the data padd on her desk as
Captain Janeway made her way across the room to the small office off to one
side.</P>
<P>"Seven, can I have a word with you?" Janeway asked from the doorway.</P>
<P>"Of course, Captain." Seven stood and gave Janeway her full attention.</P>
<P>"Would you care to explain this?" Janeway thrust a data padd at the former
Borg drone.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, then read over the padd. "Captain?"</P>
<P>"Explain." Janeway’s voice could have cut through the duranium deck plating.
She took a deep breath and slowly released it.</P>
<P>"I am uncertain as to what you expect me to explain," Seven said as she
handed the padd back to Janeway.</P>
<P>"What the hell were you doing?"</P>
<P>Seven seemed genuinely confused. "I was utilizing the holodeck to relieve
tension."</P>
<P>"This is not an acceptable use of the holodeck," Janeway said quietly. "In
fact, I think you should talk to the Doctor or perhaps Chakotay about this."</P>
<P>"Is this why Lieutenant Torres was imprisoned?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway snapped. "She is in brig because she injured several members of
this crew. I’m here because I am worried about you, Seven." </P>
<P>"Are you certain you are not here out of concern for the holocharacter? I did
reset the program when I left."</P>
<P>"Seven, you killed a holocharacter, twice. What is this about?" Janeway
stepped closer, but Seven moved away.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres killed a holocharacter, and from what Tuvok has said, it
was an efficient focus for her aggression," Seven explained. "He stated that had
B’Elanna not killed Becca, she would have severely injured Ensign Paris. Tuvok
stated that had the holodeck been full of holographic characters and not actual
crewmembers, Lieutenant Torres would not be in custody at this time." </P>
<P>"That doesn’t explain why you did this," Janeway said waving the padd.</P>
<P>"The character annoyed me," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"You broke his neck."</P>
<P>"Twice," Seven amended. "He is an exceptionally annoying program. He grabbed
my buttocks."</P>
<P>"So you killed him?"</P>
<P>"Captain, I am confused as to your objection. How is my use of the holodeck,
or Lieutenant Torres’ any different than yours?"</P>
<P>"What?" Janeway’s eyes widened.</P>
<P>"I killed the annoying bartender, Sullivan," Seven said as she went behind
her desk, or rather the desk she was using until Torres was returned to duty.
"It alleviated some of my tension. B’Elanna and I chose to kill holograms, you
choose to fuck them, both relieve tension. I fail to see why we are having this
discussion."</P>
<P>"You are out of line," Janeway said. Inside she cringed at the blonde’s
terminology. She hadn’t expected such a word from the exdrone’s mouth. </P>
<P>"Then perhaps you should send me to the brig," Seven replied. She knew her
words hurt the captain, she could tell by the tiny wrinkles that formed around
the older woman’s eyes when she looked at Seven, but she couldn’t stop herself
from saying them.</P>
<P>"Don’t think I won’t," Janeway said, her voice was harder than she had
intended, but Seven’s word had stung deeply. </P>
<P>"Are we finished?" Seven asked. "We are in need of dilithium crystals and I
need to assign a crew to retrieve them."</P>
<P>"Seven, what’s going on with you?" Janeway asked sincerely, pushing aside her
own hurt and focusing on her concern for Seven. "You’ve been avoiding me. You
don’t meet me for Velocity anymore; you won’t even look me in the eyes. Talk to
me. What is it?"</P>
<P>Seven briefly considered telling Janeway the truth, that she was deeply hurt
by the captain’s decision to turn to a hologram, but she couldn’t. It was too
painful to say out loud, so she changed the subject. "The dilithium crystals are
critical. I have found a planet three days away by shuttle."</P>
<P>"You’re avoiding my questions."</P>
<P>"I will pilot the shuttle myself," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Seven, don’t you think leaving the ship to avoid my question is a little
over the top?" Janeway took a step closer to Seven as she spoke, but was only
frustrated when the Borg moved around her and headed out the door.</P>
<P>"I do not see how my actions can be seen in any spatial placement, over the
top or otherwise. I will be in the shuttle bay preparing for launch."</P>
<P>"Who are you taking with you?" Janeway asked, trying a different tact.</P>
<P>"I will go alone," Seven said dismissing the question.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so," Janeway said. "Protocol requires at least two
crewmembers," she added with a wry grin. She was hatching a plot, and not one of
her kinder ones.</P>
<P>"Fine," Seven said. "I will leave Vorik in charge and take Lieutenant
Nicoletti with me."</P>
<P>"No," the captain said.</P>
<P>"I am acting head of Engineering. I have the right to assign my staff as I
see fit," Seven said indignantly.</P>
<P>"And I am the Captain. I have the right to assign <I>my</I> crew any way I
see fit." The petite redhead crossed her arms over her chest and eyed the tall
blonde. "I think Lieutenant Torres has been in brig long enough, but I don’t
think her punishment is quite finished. I think a little dilithium collection
would be just the thing for her." Janeway almost laughed as she saw anger flash
across Seven’s sculpted features. It was no secret that Torres and Seven had a
volatile and unfriendly relationship, and both women generally did anything to
avoid spending time alone together. An away mission that required three days
travel each way in addition to the actual time it took to collect the dilithium
would be enough to bring the two to blows. "Sure you want to go yourself?"
Janeway challenged.</P>
<P>Seven stared at Janeway’s lips; they were edging up at the corners the way
they always did when she found something amusing. The exdrone suddenly pictured
that same smile directed at the hologram Sullivan. "I am sure Lieutenant Torres
and I will manage."</P>

<P>B’Elanna stared at Janeway as if she had grown a second and third head.</P>
<P>"Me and Seven?" B’Elanna turned at let her eyes wander over the tight
confines of the cell she had come to call home. "No thank you, Ma’am. I think
I’ll stay right where I am." B’Elanna walked back to her bunk and flopped onto
her back and stared up at the ceiling.</P>
<P>"You don’t have that option," Janeway said. She was beginning to get more
satisfaction from her present plot than she really should, but with all the
trouble Torres and Seven had been giving her lately, she intended to milk it for
all it was worth.</P>
<P>Torres sat up and turned toward Janeway. "You can’t be serious, Captain. I’ve
just served three weeks for busting up Tuvok’s security squad. You send me off
for six days with that…that… with ‘her,’ and I’ll end up court martialed."</P>
<P>Janeway gave Torres an evil, predatory smile. "I’m hoping you’ve learned your
lesson."</P>
<P>B’Elanna snorted and stood up. "I’m a slow learner, Ma’am." She paced the
small room, not crossing the doorway despite the fact the forcefield was now
down. </P>
<P>"You’re going. Consider it the last of your punishment."</P>
<P>"If I’d known this was part of the punishment, I never would have lost my
temper," B’Elanna said as she ran her hands through her dark hair.</P>
<P>Janeway laughed. "Well, just remember that over the next six days. If either
of you returns with so much as a broken fingernail, I’ll lock you two in one of
these cells, together, for a month."</P>
<P>Torres released a sigh and her shoulders slumped in defeat. "Do I at least
get time to go pack a bag?" she asked without looking up.</P>
<P>"Make it quick. Seven’s in the shuttle bay now, and she hates tardiness,"
Janeway said, unable to avoid tossing out one last dig.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna stood outside the shuttle bay for several minutes before actually
entering. She nodded to passing crewmembers who seemed surprised to see her out
of the brig. Once she had her temper firmly in check she entered and went to the
<I>Delta Flyer</I>. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, you are late," Seven said instead of a greeting.</P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, considering I just got drafted for this little mission, you’re
lucky I’m here at all." Torres brushed past her traveling companion and went
inside the shuttle directly to the small sleeping area in the back and tossed
her duffel bag onto one of the bunks.</P>
<P>Seven stood in the doorway behind the compact Klingon-human hybrid and
crossed her arms over her chest. "Your tardiness was intentional," Seven
accused. "I inquired as to your location and was informed that you were waiting
at the entrance to the shuttle bay for the last six minutes. Explain."</P>
<P>B’Elanna spun and glared at Seven, who didn’t react. "Just be glad I did.
I’ve been standing out there going over every reason I could think of to not
ring your scrawny neck."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven smirked, and tilted her head to one side. "And the reasons
were so abundant that it took you six minutes to list them?"</P>
<P>"Don’t start with me, Borg." Torres squeezed around Seven and went out to the
shuttle’s helm. "It took me that long to come up with one reason."</P>
<P>Seven followed on B’Elanna’s heels. "And what was the reason?"</P>
<P>"I didn’t want to get my hands dirty." Torres flopped into one of the chairs
and began the preflight checklist.</P>
<P>Seven sat in the chair to B’Elanna’s right and began assisting her. "I assure
you, I have impeccable hygiene."</P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, you’re still a Borg. The idea of touching a drone doesn’t appeal
to me," B’Elanna shot back. She was surprised when she saw Seven actually
flinch.</P>
<P>"I am no longer a drone," Seven said quietly. "Perhaps we should agree to
keep our conversation to a minimum."</P>
<P>"Fine by me," Torres said as she finished her preflight check.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Twenty four hours later, Seven of Nine was in the cargo hold double checking
the containment field that was supposed to transport the dilithium crystals. She
avoided Lieutenant Torres for the most part, only needing to actual speak with
her on one occasion to point out a necessary course adjustment. The former Borg
drone was used to people avoiding her, and she occupied her mind with
calculations to increase the sensitivity of the shuttle’s sensors. </P>
<P>It was not as easy for B’Elanna to remain completely quiet. During the three
weeks Torres had spent in the brig she had been able to talk with her guards and
keep up on ship’s gossip. The complete silence of the shuttle quickly began to
grate on her nerves. She decided she was desperate enough to talk to the
drone.</P>
<P>"Hey, Seven, what are you doing?" Torres asked as she leaned against the
shuttle wall.</P>
<P>Seven raised her blonde eyebrow in response.</P>
<P>"Okay, I admit it. I was a little tough on you yesterday." It was as close to
an apology as Torres would get. She ran her hand though her hair and cleared her
throat. "So, what are you doing?"</P>
<P>Seven accepted the gesture for what it was. People often said that she was
like a child in many ways, and one of those ways was in her willingness to move
beyond disagreements. </P>
<P>"I have fine-tuned the sensor array to increase its sensitivity by 32
percent." Seven stood up so B’Elanna could access the panel.</P>
<P>"Yeah?" Torres knelt down and examined the changes. "You rerouted the
auxiliary power feed to the imaging matrix. Good idea."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said cautiously.</P>
<P>Torres turned and looked up at the athletic blonde. "You know, Seven, I can
recognize good work."</P>
<P>"I am aware of that fact, Lieutenant. You are a brilliant engineer. Part of
that entails the ability to notice the skill others possess." Seven linked her
hands behind her back, forcing her chest into stark profile as she turned toward
the front of the shuttle.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven." B’Elanna stood and looked at her companion. B’Elanna had
noticed Seven’s perfect body on many occasions, and what amazed the half Klingon
most was that the exdrone seemed oblivious to her own beauty.</P>
<P>"I merely stated the obvious," Seven explained.</P>
<P>"Brilliant? Wow." Torres motioned to a panel cover lying on the floor behind
Seven. "So are you finished in here?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven handed Torres the panel and then extended her hand and pulled
her to feet.</P>
<P>A beeping from the helm cut off their first civil conversation. They both
moved to the helm and sat, B’Elanna quickly accessing the readings. "Well,
Seven, looks like your improved sensors are picking something up."</P>
<P>Seven leaned over against B’Elanna and gave the computer a few quick
commands, her fingers moving gracefully over the controls. "I am
detecting…neutrinos. They appear to be from a stabile source," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Stabile?" Torres stood and leaned against Seven’s shoulder to get a better
look at her readings. "Could that be a wormhole?"</P>
<P>"Possibly," Seven said, trying to ignore the warmth of B’Elanna’s body
against her arm. "These readings are similar to the data I have received from
<I>Voyager’s</I> records on the Bajorian wormhole. The stabile neutrinos have
only been found at that artificial wormhole."</P>
<P>"So you think it’s the same wormhole?" B’Elanna’s eyes widened.</P>
<P>"No," Seven stated. "Only that both anomalies share stabile neutrinos."</P>
<P>"Damn. Well, I say we go investigate and see just where this wormhole leads.
It could be just the short cut we’re looking for."</P>
<P>"It could also lead us directly back into the heart of Borg space," Seven
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Always the optimist," Torres whispered under her breath as she changed
course toward the neutrino emissions.</P>
<P>"The captain did not give us permission to investigate any…phenomena," Seven
said even as she adjusted the sensors to scan the area in question.</P>
<P>"I’m not passing up a possible wormhole back to the Alpha Quadrant. Janeway
should be glad we found it. I still can’t believe she stuck me on this stupid
mission," Torres grumbled. "Like it really takes a Chief Engineer to pick up
some dilithium deposits."</P>
<P>Seven glanced over at her companion and waited a few minutes before
commenting. "I believe it is my fault you were assigned to this mission."</P>
<P>"What?" Torres said as she spun toward Seven and glared at her.</P>
<P>"I wanted to participate in this mission. Given our well known
incompatibility, I believe she sent you to either dissuade me from coming or to
punish me." Seven sighed and gave the control panel her full attention.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stared at the exdrone trying to decide if she should be angry or
laugh. It hadn’t occurred to her that Seven was so keenly aware of human nature.
Finally, her own curiosity made her break the silence.</P>
<P>"Umm, Seven? What did you do to piss off the captain?"</P>
<P>"Tom Paris is an idiot," Seven said instead of answering Torres’
question.</P>
<P>"Yes, he is, but that wasn’t what I asked."</P>
<P>Seven turned to B’Elanna and took a leisurely look at the Klingon’s muscular
frame. "You are the second most attractive female on board <I>Voyager</I> as
well as one of the most intelligent, and yet he choose to jeopardize everything
you offer by… copulating with that hologram."</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt her cheeks darken and her face became warm and she cleared her
throat. "Uh, thanks," she said unsteadily, then frowned when she realized
Seven’s implication. "Second most attractive? You really are full of yourself,
Borg."</P>
<P>Seven seemed confused. "Who else would I be full of?"</P>
<P>"I suppose you think you’re the smartest and best looking?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven said honestly. "I do not. I believe of all the women on
<I>Voyager</I>… I am the least appealing. As you are so fond of pointing out, I
am Borg."</P>
<P>"So who <I>is</I> the most attractive?" B’Elanna stared at the blonde, unable
to grasp that she didn’t know she was one of the most beautiful women many had
ever seen anywhere.</P>
<P>Seven blushed and looked away. "It is irrelevant."</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said, drawing the word out. "So what did you do to warrant
the punishment of six days with me?"</P>
<P>Seven turned slowly back toward B’Elanna. "I killed a hologram, and then
pointed out to the captain that it was no different than her use of the
programs."</P>
<P>"Who’d you kill? Her bartender?" Torres said jokingly.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Oh. Well, what else did you say to her?" Torres asked.</P>
<P>"That it shouldn’t matter if member of the crew used them for killing or
fucking. Both are methods of relieving stress."</P>
<P>B’Elanna burst into a howling laugh, letting her Klingon self fully enjoy the
moment. Finally, she wiped her eyes and looked at Seven who seemed mildly amused
herself. "You really said, ‘fucking’?"</P>
<P>"It is the correct term. It means a sexual act of a vulgar or unseemly
nature. I can think of nothing more unseemly than sex with a hologram," Seven
said with her typical bluntness.</P>
<P>B’Elanna studied Seven for a several moments, rubbing her chin as a
realization came into her consciousness. "The woman who is the most beautiful…
in your eyes… it’s Janeway, isn’t it?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said without looking up from the panel. "I am getting strange
reading from the area ahead. There appears to be a nebula around the wormhole.
If it is indeed a wormhole."</P>
<P>"Let’s ease into the nebula and see what we can see," Torres said. She looked
over at Seven and realized the exdrone was in love with the captain.</P>
<P>"Wait," Seven said, dropping the shuttle to one half impulse. "There are
several beacons between us and the nebula."</P>
<P>"Are they armed?" Torres asked.</P>
<P>"They do not appear to be," Seven answered.</P>
<P>"You’re in love with her, aren’t you?"</P>
<P>Seven’s hands froze on the console. "You are mistaken," Seven said, her voice
like ice. "I have no feelings for the captain."</P>
<P>"You react pretty strongly for someone who doesn’t have any feelings."</P>
<P>Seven bit her lip and then looked at B’Elanna. For some reason B’Elanna’s
recent loss at the hands of a holographic character made her feel closer to the
Klingon. "I am… no longer in love with her," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said, amazed the exdrone admitted as much as she had. "Does
she know? I mean, did she know how you used to feel?"</P>
<P>"It is irrelevant. We had developed a certain closeness. After she convinced
me to return to <I>Voyager</I> during my confusion about the conspiracies, I
thought we understood each other." Seven looked away, embarrassed by both the
admission and the reference to her brief delusion about the crew of
<I>Voyager</I> after she overloaded her cortical implant by using Borg
technology to download all of the ship’s logs. "The person I thought she was
would not ‘fall in love’ with a hologram."</P>
<P>"I’m sorry," B’Elanna said sincerely. She was suddenly glad to be on the
shuttle with Seven. For the first time she thought she understood the exdrone,
and she was finding out she was very much like Torres herself.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said, and then went back to the control panel. "There is a
communications relay on the beacon. It is activating."</P>
<P>"Got it," Torres said. "Audio only. I’m opening channels now."</P><I>
<P>*"Alien vessel, you are entering a restricted zone. Leave now or you will be
prosecuted for violation of the Dengari Border."*</P></I>
<P>"Friendly aren’t they," B’Elanna said. "The same message is on a continual
loop."</P>
<P>"We should return to our original flight plan," Seven said as she began
plotting a return course.</P>
<P>"The hell we will. There might be a wormhole in there. We aren’t just gonna’
turn tail and run. There’s no sign of any ships in the area." Torres began
plotting her own course into the nebula.</P>
<P>"That would be ill-advised. The message was clear, and we have no reason to
violate their border." Seven reset the course heading.</P>
<P>"Yes, we do," Torres put her hand over Seven’s and held it in place as she
used her other hand to lay in a course to the nebula. "I think I saw some debris
in there. Could be a damaged ship… we have to look for survivors."</P>
<P>"I doubt the veracity of your claim, and I doubt the Dengari will find it a
plausible excuse either." Seven pulled her hand free.</P>
<P>"Come on, Seven. Where’s your sense of adventure?"</P>
<P>"Borg have no sense of adventure," Seven deadpanned. </P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, baring her razor sharp canines. "But you’re not Borg
anymore, now are you?"</P>
<P>"I hope I do not find myself wishing I were," Seven said as she leaned back
into her chair so that Torres could take control of the helm.</P>

</table>

<P>"It’s not my fault," B’Elanna said for the fifth time in ten minutes.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven said as she turned around and stared at Torres who was
sitting on a small bunk in the tiny, dingy cell. "And exactly whose fault is
it?"</P>
<P>"Stupid Dengari," B’Elanna said under her breath. "How was I supposed to know
they had two battle cruisers in that nebula?" Torres asked as she stood and
crossed to Seven.</P>
<P>"On the bright side," Seven said sarcastically, "We now know there is a
wormhole inside the nebula."</P>
<P>B’Elanna glared at Seven, but said nothing.</P>
<P>"Unfortunately, I do not think a wormhole that goes to the Dengari penal
colony will assist <I>Voyager</I> in any way." Seven walked to the doorway and
studied the forcefield with her Borg eyepiece looking for any weakness. She saw
none.</P>
<P>Torres was glad to see the two guards coming down the corridor. It meant she
didn’t have to respond to Seven’s remark. The guards were muscular, but lanky,
with dark coloring and had thick black hair pulled back over there ears. Their
uniforms were as black as their hair, made of reflective material that absorbed
phaser fire, much to Torres’ horror. She had tried firing on the boarding party
that over took the <I>Delta Flyer</I> only to watch in stunned silence as the
shots simply disappeared into their clothing with a muted hiss.</P>
<P>"We’ve got company," Torres whispered as she stood and moved next to Seven.
The former Borg stood to her full height and positioned herself between the
entrance and B’Elanna. The Klingon noticed, but said nothing.</P>
<P>"It is time," said Kendo, the shorter of the two guards. He was still at
least six inches taller than Seven. Malok, his silent companion, was almost ten
inches taller than the lanky Borg and he held two sets of shackles in his
hands.</P>
<P>"Time?" B’Elanna asked as she tried to step around Seven. "What the hell does
that mean?" Seven shot her an angry glare but the Klingon ignored her. "When are
we gonna’ talk to someone in charge?"</P>
<P>Malok nodded toward B’Elanna before speaking. "Your sentence has been
decided. You are very lucky that you have been given the minimum term."</P>
<P>"Sentence?" Torres yelled. "We haven’t even had a trial!"</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Seven said quietly. </P>
<P>"Suspects are not worthy of appearing before the magistrate. Had you been
found not guilty, you would have been given an audience with the magistrate,"
Kendo explained.</P>
<P>"How can we be found not guilty if we can’t give a defense?" Torres
demanded.</P>
<P>Kendo paused and then smiled. "Were you in Dengari space?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"Then you are guilty," he explained. "Come."</P>
<P>"What is our sentence?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>Malok frowned and studied the deck plating, not wanting to meet their
gaze.</P>
<P>"Two and one half years," Malok said.</P>
<P>"Unacceptable," Seven said, pushing B’Elanna behind her. "I forced Lieutenant
Torres to violate your space. I will serve both terms for a total of five years
and you will release her." </P>
<P>"What?" Torres yelled.</P>
<P>"A noble offer, but that is not how we do things," Malok answered. He
motioned to his partner and the man stepped forward. "Co-operate and you will
not be injured…again. Please."</P>
<P>"Please, B’Elanna," Seven said gently. "Do not resist. <I>Voyager</I> will
find us in a matter of days and the captain will figure something out." She
didn’t add that she been terrified when she had seen B’Elanna beaten into
submission during their capture. It had taken three guards and five broken ribs
to restrain Seven when she had seen B’Elanna go down.</P>
<P>"Fine," Torres said, noticing that Seven had used her first name and said
please. She held her hands out to the second guard and flinched as he snapped
the shackles into place. She would have fought, but when she had woken up in a
strange sick bay and looked across the room to see Seven being operated on, she
had known it was her fault. Luckily, the Dengari had technology similar to
<I>Voyager’s</I>, and they had repaired Seven’s damaged ribs and punctured
lung.</P>
<P>The guards escorted them onto a small ship without any windows and motioned
them into two seats near the front of the cramped cabin. </P>
<P>Malok, the taller guard finally spoke. His voice was deep, and sounded almost
sad. "Secure," he said as he clamped B’Elanna into the chair. He had small
ridges on his cheeks, much like his companion, but more pronounced. Torres found
the species almost attractive, except that they apparently thought throwing
someone in prison without a real trial was completely acceptable.</P>
<P>"Now you," the shorter guard said to Seven.</P>
<P>She sat, and placed her arms chair as B’Elanna had done. The taller guard
moved closer and began fastening the heavy metal clamps, two near the wrist, two
on her upper arm. His eyes met Seven’s and he quickly looked back to his
hands.</P>
<P>"Please," Seven said to him, her eyes pleading. "My left arm is damaged. This
exoskeleton helps support it. Could you loosen the clamps?"</P>
<P>Torres almost choked when she heard the blatant lie. She was amazed how
easily the fabrication rolled off the former Borg’s full lips. The guard seemed
moved, and he studied her left hand. </P>
<P>"Does it hurt?" he whispered.</P>
<P>"It is painful, but I can tolerate it. I cannot bend it, so the clamps cut
into my flesh," Seven said, then tilted her head and actually batted her
eyelashes at him. "Please."</P>
<P>"Okay," he said quietly and loosened the clamps. "How’s that?" He put his
fingers under the clamp to check the tightness and sucked in a deep breath when
Seven flinched and whimpered when he touched her skin. He frowned and loosened
them a bit more.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven whispered as he stepped away. She looked over at B’Elanna
who was biting her lip to keep from laughing.</P>
<P>"What about our shuttle?" Torres finally asked.</P>
<P>The shorter guard turned. "It will be held until your release. You have the
option of having any personal items with you, except for weapons or
communications devices."</P>
<P>"We’ll take everything," Torres said. "And there’s a power converter we need
from the cargo bay."</P>
<P>"You won’t have any power where you’re going," he answered.</P>
<P>"She’ll die without it," Torres said motioning toward Seven with her head.
"Her, injuries, make it necessary for her to take energy directly from the
converter." It wasn’t entirely true, since Seven could eat solid food and sleep
when she had to, but the power converter allowed her to maintain more productive
levels and made sleep almost unnecessary. B’Elanna also hoped she could use the
converter to make a signal device.</P>
<P>"Is it portable," Malok asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said.</P>
<P>"We’ll load it," he said. "It might help." </P>
<P>The two guards left and B’Elanna looked over at Seven. "Any bright
ideas?"</P>
<P>"We will adapt," Seven said. She looked down at her loosely restrained left
arm. "Thank you for bringing up the power converter."</P>
<P>"It’s the least I can do," Torres said quietly. "Sorry I got us into this.
Oh, and by the way, Borg… what did you think you were pulling trying to take the
fall alone? You think I’d go back to <I>Voyager</I> and just leave you here to
serve my sentence?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven smirked before continuing. "I expected you to go to
<I>Voyager</I> and bring back help."</P>
<P>"Oh," Torres said.</P>
<P>The two guards returned, their arms full of items from the shuttle. Malok
began packing them into a large locker at the back of the cabin. He carefully
examined each object as he placed them into the storage container while the
shorter guard returned for more things. </P>
<P>"Medical supplies," Malok said. "These will come in handy if you can keep
them."</P>
<P>"Where are we going?" Seven asked, turning her head to try to look at
him.</P>
<P>"Jusari Prime. It’s our penal colony," he said as he continued to pack things
into the locker. "The shuttle will come down just outside the outer limits of
Non-V City, the secondary city. It’s for non-violent offenders, but you should
still be wary. The violent offenders migrate toward Non-V to take advantage of
the newcomers. As soon as they see the shuttle come down, the scavengers will
head for your position. They’ll kill you if they can."</P>
<P>"Great," Torres said. "Any other good news for us?"</P>
<P>He finished putting the things in the locker then stood and held out a
laser-cutting torch. "I can’t let you have this. It can be used as a
weapon."</P>
<P>Seven leaned toward him. "What else can you tell us?"</P>
<P>"Try to get as far way from the city as quickly as you can. Most of the
life-sentencers gather there." He moved closer and knelt between the two women
and took a map off of the flat dashboard. It had no instruments and seemed
designed more for storage than anything else. He opened the map and held it up
to them. It showed the entire planet’s surface with four continents around the
equator. "V-City is here. You should avoid that area at all costs," he said
pointing to the center of the largest continent. "This is Non-V, it’s not much
better." He pointed to an area near one of the eastern most seaboards. </P>
<P>"Why do we have to go to either?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"We send offenders to one of the two starting points. It’s up to you where
you go then." He reached into his waist pack and took out a device that looked
like a large hypospray and adjusted the setting. "As long as you stay within the
area near the equator, the weather is moderate. If you go further, the weather
is harsher, but there are fewer people."</P>
<P>"How do we get back?" Torres asked.</P>
<P>"This," he said pressing the hypospray into Seven’s neck. "I just set it for
your release date. It has a genetic marker as well as a radioactive tracer. We
already installed a universal translator at the hospital." He pressed the hypo
into B’Elanna’s neck and stood. "At the end of your sentence you will be
retrieved by transporter."</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to one side. "Why not transport us onto the
surface?"</P>
<P>Malok leaned against the dash and looked at her. "The shuttle is supposed to
give you a fighting chance. It allows you to take your possessions with you, but
you won’t be able to bring them with you when you return, so leave anything of
value here. If you can keep the scavengers away, you can use the shuttle for
shelter, but I wouldn’t suggest it. They make good targets."</P>
<P>"Malok," Torres whispered. "We have a ship that will come looking for us,
<I>Voyager</I>. Tell where we went. Please."</P>
<P>"It won’t matter," he said. "They’ll never get through the wormhole."</P>
<P>"You are mistaken," Seven said. "Our captain will not give up on us."</P>
<P>He sighed and stood. "It won’t matter. I’m sorry. Oh, and don’t waste your
time trying to get this shuttle to fly. It isn’t designed to leave orbit. We
launch it from a cruiser into the atmosphere, and its guidance system takes it
to the landing zone. Takes about ten minutes. It doesn’t have any communications
equipment at all." He turned back and looked at Seven. "Stay out of the cities.
Your golden hair is very rare. They’ll… they’ll like you."</P>
<P>"What the hell does that mean?" Torres demanded.</P>
<P>He looked into the Klingon’s dark eyes. "These are not nice people. She will
be a primary target."</P>
<P>"I am no one’s target," Seven said.</P>
<P>Malok turned to Torres. "If you can, dye her hair black. It might help some.
If it doesn’t, well… the transporter retrieval system will pull out anyone with
your DNA markers. If… well… any offspring will be beamed out with you."</P>
<P>"Offspring?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"You can’t send her down to that hell hole," Torres said as she struggled
against her restraints. </P>
<P>"I’m sorry," he said as he went to the door when Kendo returned with his arms
full of gear.</P>
<P>Kendo placed the energy converter into the locker and turned around as Malok
continued stowing the rest. </P>
<P>"It’s against rules," Kendo said quietly to Torres. "But I took one of the
solar collectors from your cargo bay, maybe you can use it to help your
friend."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Torres said. She felt her chest tightening and began to wonder
if <I>Voyager</I> would ever find them. The two guards were competent, and kind,
but what worried her was the way they kept looking at Seven with sincere regret.
Whatever they were headed for, B’Elanna would do whatever was necessary to keep
Seven safe.</P>
<P>"It’s time," Malok said as he secured the locker.</P>
<P>"Good luck," Kendo said. "You will be retrieved exactly two and one half
years after you land, no matter where you are. If you get separated, you will be
reunited when we retrieve you."</P>
<P>"Stay away from the cities," Malok said as he squeezed Seven’s shoulder, then
he and Kendo left the shuttle. </P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven said nothing as they listened to the outer door being
locked down. They felt the shuttle vibrate as it was lifted into the launch bay.
B’Elanna flexed against her restraints, but the alloy didn’t budge. She looked
over at Seven and raised her eyebrows in question.</P>
<P>Seven twisted her wrist and grimaced when her thumb popped out of its socket.
She rotated her shoulder as she worked for the best angle. Her wrist was still
at the wrong angle to clear the second restraint so she pulled her entire weight
away from her arm. Torres groaned when she heard the bone snap and watched as
Seven pulled the flopping limb up through the restraint. Once clear of the
restraint she turned and examined the clamp holding her fully human arm.</P>
<P>"Kahless!" B’Elanna said. "Didn’t that hurt?"</P>
<P>"Pain is irrelevant at the moment," Seven said as she pulled at her
restrained arm. She placed her Borg enhanced hand near her fully human hand and
accessed the tiny control panel near her wrist. Her assimilation tubules
slithered out of her hand and she held them up to the restraint. The tiny
tubules contained microscopic drills in the tips, which Seven used to eat away
at the alloy holding her in place. After several minutes she yanked her arm free
and went to B’Elanna’s chair and began drilling to free her.</P>
<P>"That thing’s pretty handy," Torres said as she watched the Borg drills eat
through the alloy with ease.</P>
<P>"There are some advantages to being a drone," Seven said. The final clamp
broke in half and Seven went immediately toward the locker at the back of the
cabin.</P>
<P>"Get the bone mender and let me fix that arm," B’Elanna said. She stood and
began looking over the small cabin.</P>
<P>"There is no time," Seven said as she grabbed a tricorder from the pile of
supplies. "Use this to find the best way to access the propulsion system. We can
alter the shuttle’s course."</P>
<P>"Umm, Seven? This thing isn’t spaceworthy," Torres said even as she began
scanning the cabin.</P>
<P>"Correct, but if we can access the propulsion, we can land somewhere away
from the two major cities." Seven pulled out a box of tools and began digging
through them with her uninjured arm. "I believe it would be to our advantage to
avoid contact with any of the planet’s current inhabitants."</P>
<P>"Good idea." B’Elanna paused near the back of the cabin. "Here, there’s a
fuel line to the main thrusters."</P>
<P>Seven began tearing away the panel with a large spanner. "Once we access
this, you will need to figure out how to restrict the flow to alter the
shuttle’s flight path. I will begin scans of the planet so I can determine the
best landing zone."</P>
<P>"Got it," Torres said as she lifted the panel out and leaned into the
opening.</P>
<P>Seven reset the tricorder and tried to scan through the shuttle’s thick hull.
"I can’t get any interstellar readings, but I am getting a clear image of the
planet. We are coming in over the main continent. Reduced fuel to aft thrusters
by 40 percent. That will put us into a tight turn."</P>
<P>"Okay," Torres said and grabbed the edge of the panel. The shuttle responded,
tossing Seven across the floor. She rolled onto her knees and continued scanning
the planet surface. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant, do you have a preference? Desert or mountain?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Desert or mountain," Seven repeated. "We can reach two areas, one is desert,
one mountain."</P>
<P>"Mountain," Torres said. "But it better not be cold."</P>
<P>"Increase aft thruster to 72 percent," Seven said, raising an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"72 percent? Seven, I’m winging it."</P>
<P>"Winging it?" Seven asked, mortified.</P>
<P>"I don’t exactly have a comm panel here. I’m just kinda’ cutting off the flow
a little."</P>
<P>"Then ‘kinda’ cut off the supply to 72 percent of normal." Seven crawled
closer to Torres. Seven continued scanning. "Reduced aft thruster to 60
percent."</P>
<P>B’Elanna glared at Seven and then tried to estimate her adjustment.</P>
<P>"Too much, increase thrust to 74 percent," Seven ordered.</P>
<P>"I’m gonna’ kill Janeway for this," Torres said even as she increased the
thrust.</P>
<P>"We are coming in for a landing," Seven said. "I suggest you brace for
impact. I do not believe this shuttle was designed for a rough terrain landing.
I will monitor our descent."</P>
<P>"What about your arm?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Go. After landing I may have more serious injuries for you to attend." Seven
began making minute adjustments to the thruster but it was difficult because she
could only access one of the shuttle’s two sets of thrusters. By increasing or
decreasing the thrust she was able to make the shuttle turn, but only in one
direction, to the right. So if they needed to turn the left, they had to make a
three-quarter circle to the right to effect a one-quarter turn to the left.</P>
<P>"Seven, leave it," B’Elanna said. "Take cover."</P>
<P>"1500 kilometers…" Seven said, glancing at the tricorder, still making
adjustments to the thrusters. "1000…"</P>
<P>"Seven, brace yourself. That’s an order."</P>
<P>"500…" Seven made one final adjustment. "Impact in 6 seconds…"</P>
<P>"I told you to take cover," Torres yelled. "Seven, get…" The shuttle’s impact
cut Torres off. She had tied herself back into the restraint chair and was
thrown forward, knocking the wind out of her chest. The sound of metal on rock
filled her ears and she wondered if the small shuttle would tear into pieces or
just burst into flames. She was pitched to the left and saw a flash of blue go
past her, followed by the sound of flesh against steel. The grinding stopped and
Torres found herself still in the chair. She looked over and saw Seven under the
front panel of the shuttle.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna ripped at her ties and then crawled over the very still
body under the dash. "Seven? Don’t you die on me, Borg. That would be just like
you to leave me to fend for myself." She careful turned the blonde over and saw
a deep gash across her temple. "Damn it."</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, must you always use such colorful euphemisms?" Seven whispered
as she sat up.</P>
<P>"You’re damn right I do," B’Elanna answered. "Are you okay?"</P>
<P>Seven stared at the half Klingon before answering. "Given our current
situation, I believe any answer would be relative."</P>
<P>"You’re fine," Torres said as she moved to get the medical pack. She quickly
scanned Seven and then healed the deep cut on her temple. "No concussion. Must
be that hard head."</P>
<P>"We should verify our location," Seven said as she tried to stand.</P>
<P>"Not so fast," Torres said, yanking her back down to the floor. "Let me fix
that arm first. Where’d you park us anyway?"</P>
<P>"I attempted to land on the smaller of the two continents off the western
coast of the main land mass." Seven held her arm out for Torres to examine. It
had swelled and turned a deep purple and seemed to have an extra bend in the
middle of her lower arm.</P>
<P>"How close are we to the main continent? The one where the cities are?"
B’Elanna frowned at the tricorder. "Damn, Seven. You snapped the radius and the
ulna."</P>
<P>"There are 2,500 miles of ocean between us and the continent with the prison
cities." Seven grimaced as B’Elanna tried to straighten the damaged arm. "As for
my injury, I had to break the bones in order to free myself from the
restraints."</P>
<P>"This is gonna’ hurt," Torres said as she gripped the arm on each side of the
breaks. </P>
<P>"It already hurts," Seven responded dryly.</P>
<P>"It’s gonna’ get worse," Torres said. "Wait, let me give you a
painkiller."</P>
<P>"No," Seven held B’Elanna in place with her good arm. "We may need the
painkiller for more serious injuries in the future. I can tolerate the
pain."</P>
<P>Torres studied Seven for several seconds and then nodded. "I’m sorry." She
wrenched the bones back into place with a muted crunch. </P>
<P>Seven said nothing, but squeezed her eyes shut and took deep breaths and a
tear slid down her cheek. </P>
<P>"Oh, God, I’m sorry," B’Elanna said again and gently set her arm in her lap.
She wiped away the tear and cupped Seven’s cheek in her hand. "With that tough
act of yours, you’d make a great Klingon."</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes, expecting to see Torres mocking her, but found only
sincerity. "Thank you."</P>
<P>"You’re welcome." Torres used the bone mender to knit the bones back together
and then they both stood. "Let’s take a look around the neighborhood," B’Elanna
said as she headed for the door.</P>

<P>Seven pushed the shuttle door open with her foot and then let B’Elanna go
through first. Torres leaned out and paused, holding her hand up to keep Seven
behind her.</P>
<P>"Wow, nice driving, Seven." Torres leaned back in and smiled.</P>
<P>Seven followed Torres out of the door and looked out over a vast valley full
of evergreen trees that were hundreds of feet tall. She looked behind the
shuttle at the exposed ground that stretched out for almost a mile where the
shuttle had crashed through the dense forest, then she turned to the front of
the shuttle itself. The entire front end was caved in and there were huge pieces
of the structure torn away.</P>
<P>"Our survival was…unlikely." Seven touched the dented alloy, then jerked her
hand back from the friction-heated metal. </P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, I say any landing you can walk away from is a good one." Torres
turned and looked around the forest. "Looks like we won’t have to worry about a
welcoming party. I say we try to set up a transmitter to contact
<I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>Seven looked at B’Elanna suspiciously. "That could prove to be difficult
given the lack of communications components and given the fact that
<I>Voyager</I> will not even be looking for us for at least four more days. Our
more pressing concern is survival."</P>
<P>"Oh, all right," Torres said with a dramatic huff. "But I’m telling you right
now that I hate camping. I’d be much happier playing with circuitry then playing
campfire girl."</P>
<P>"Playing? I do not believe we should be wasting our time playing."</P>
<P>"Oh, shut up and find some firewood, Seven." Torres retrieved the tricorder
and then went into the forest and began scanning the area.</P>
<P>Seven frowned and leaned against the shuttle and watched as Torres walked in
circles, scanning and rescanning the area. After several minutes she went inside
and began cataloging the supplies they had.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Nine hours later Seven had a huge roaring fire built in front of the shuttle
wreckage. It looked more like a small forest fire than any control burn. Torres
came out to check on the inferno for the third time.</P>
<P>"Seven, I said start a fire, not burn down half the forest. What are you
gonna’ have left to burn tomorrow?" Torres moved closer, holding her hands out
to warm them against the cooling night air.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you would prefer to freeze to death," Seven responded as she used a
branch to push a large rock into the flames.</P>
<P>B’Elanna ignored the comment and stared into the flames and then looked up at
the night sky. It was filled with brilliant stars and two moons, both only half
full. "I rigged the energy converter with the solar panel. It should hold you
until <I>Voyager</I> finds us."</P>
<P>"If they find us. We should prepare for the possibility that they may not
rescue us." Seven moved around the fire pit and pushed another rock into the
flames.</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna said quietly. "We should get some sleep so we can get an
early start tomorrow."</P>
<P>"I will be in shortly. Have you noticed anything on the tricorder scans?"</P>
<P>"Nothing except a few small animals. I think the bigger critters must have
been scared off by our landing," Torres said. She moved around the fire next to
Seven and watched her push another rock into the flames.</P>
<P>"Critters?" Seven asked without looking up.</P>
<P>"Yeah, animals." Torres pointed at the rocks in the flames. "What are you
doing with those?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled and gave B’Elanna a sideways glance. "I believe the temperature
will drop considerably tonight…and you requested that I avoid a cold landing
zone. I will bring the heated rocks into the shuttle to increase the
temperature."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, and blushed. "Thanks." She turned and went inside, hoping
Seven hadn’t noticed her reddened cheeks.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna yelled at Seven. "Why should we build a cabin when we have a
perfectly good shuttle to sleep in?" Torres took a bite of her ration bar and
rested her head on the large boulder she was stretched out on top of.</P>
<P>Seven stepped away from the downed tree she was stripping and stalked over
the B’Elanna. "Because the shuttle does not have enough insulation. It is
designed for the short flight from orbit to the ground and half of the fuel
cells were allocated to heating the interior. We will freeze if we do not build
more efficient shelter."</P>
<P>"Efficient? Oh, that’s the Borg I know and love," Torres yelled as she jumped
off of the rock. "How many Borg log cabins have you built? Or did you just
assimilate them?"</P>
<P>Seven glared at Torres and moved closer to her until their chests were almost
touching. "I am not a Borg. We have been here three days and it is obvious we
cannot communicate with anyone on the surface let alone in orbit." Seven stepped
closer pushing Torres back into the rock she had been resting on. "It is
entirely possible we will not be rescued. We must build a shelter before the
winter weather sets in."</P>
<P>"Back off, Borg," Torres growled, pushing Seven with both hands.</P>
<P>Seven picked her up by the collar of her uniform jacket. "I am not Borg. If I
were, you would be a drone or dead," Seven said through clenched teeth and
tossed Torres off to the side.</P>
<P>B’Elanna took a deep breath and prepared to attack, but then looked at
Seven’s arrogant features and noticed something else; she saw pain. She stood in
place and studied the tall blonde. Seven had her hands clenched, the knuckles
gone white, and her jaw was trembling.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna said gently.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven said without looking up.</P>
<P>"I know you’re not a Borg. I was just angry." Torres edged closer to her
volatile companion.</P>
<P>"Anger is irrelevant. Your opinion is irrelevant." Seven turned away.</P>
<P>"Okay, I tried," B’Elanna said as she turned and walked back to the log Seven
had been stripping of branches. She kicked at the pile of bark Seven had already
peel off. "You gonna’ use this for kindling?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered, still not turning around.</P>
<P>B’Elanna began gathering up the bark, the closest thing to a peace offering
she could think of.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven asked without turning. She was looking out into the dense
tree cover and her voice sounded small and alone.</P>
<P>"Yes?" B’Elanna asked as she continued with the bark.</P>
<P>"The men in those cities? The ones Malok spoke of?" Seven said in a
whisper.</P>
<P>"Yeah? What about them?" Torres carefully put the bark into a small pile and
studied Seven’s back.</P>
<P>"Malok said…any offspring would be beamed up with us," Seven said. "He was
referring to unwelcome sexual advances and the possible children from those
couplings, was he not?"</P>
<P>"Yes, he was." B’Elanna stood and moved a few steps closer to Seven.</P>
<P>"If those men had… attacked me, would you hate me?" Seven asked, so quiet
that if Torres hadn’t been focused on her, she wouldn’t have been able to
hear.</P>
<P>"No, of course not, Seven." Torres moved closer and put her hand on Seven’s
shoulder and eased the taller woman around so that she could look at her. "Why
would you ask that? Seven, I would never blame you for that."</P>
<P>Seven lifted her head and looked into B’Elanna face. There were tears sliding
down the former drone’s alabaster cheeks. "The Borg took me against my will. I
had no choice. Every time you call me ‘Borg’ or ‘drone,’ you remind me that you
have not forgiven me for being attacked." </P>
<P>B’Elanna felt like someone had thrown her out an airlock. She felt like all
the air was ripped from her chest and just looking at the pain on Seven’s face
felt like a dagger being plunged into her stomach. It had never occurred to her
that Seven felt such pain from her assimilation. Now that she heard the words,
she wondered how she could have ever missed it. The pain on Seven’s face was so
intense, and obvious, even under her thinly veiled attempts to look emotionless.
She saw in Seven’s face her own attempts to hide her own shame from growing up a
"half-breed" that was never accepted by either race.</P>
<P>"Seven, I… I never knew." B’Elanna closed her eyes and rubbed her ridged
brow. "Geeze, I know how stupid that sounds. I… I’m just sorry."</P>
<P>"I did not tell you this to receive an apology, only to clarify as to why the
situations are different," Seven said sincerely.</P>
<P>"They’re not different. And I promise you, I won’t forget that." Torres
pulled Seven back toward the downed tree. "Come on, let’s get back to work on
that log cabin."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After eight days of back breaking work the shelter was not finished, and
there was still no sign that <I>Voyager</I> had come looking for them. ‘The
Homestead,’ as B’Elanna had decided to call the small cabin, overlooked a deep
blue lake and a rolling green valley. It was almost finished. Seven had used
chunks of the hull plating and fashioned them into axes. The walls of the cabin
were double thick and packed with a one foot thick layer of mud and insulation
from the inside of the shuttle walls. B’Elanna had suggested using the shuttle’s
thin insulation to add to the cabin’s walls and Seven had quickly volunteered to
salvage the itchy material from the hull.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna warmed her hands as she stood next to the small fire in front of the
budding cabin. They had a lot of work to do before the structure would be a
shelter, but she needed to do another parameter survey. She wanted to make sure
there weren’t any other prisoners in the area. She looked over at Seven, who was
using a sharpened piece of hull plating as a makeshift plane, slicing off layers
of wood to get the lumber to conform to her ‘master plan’ for the cabin. That in
and of itself was rather comical, making B’Elanna smile at the picture of a Borg
carpenter, but there was more. Seven was singing, almost as if she was doing it
unconsciously. The sounds of her melodic voice carried across the meadow and
would have been quite awe inspiring if she hadn’t been singing one of the
Doctor’s favorite ditties.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said as she walked over to the beautiful blonde. "Can’t you
sing something else?"</P>
<P>Seven stopped, the words to "I’ve been working on the railroad" dying on her
full lips. "You do not like my song selection?" she asked as she looked up from
the wood shavings littering the forest floor at her feet.</P>
<P>"Do ya’ see any railroads?" B’Elanna asked as she swung her arm in a wide
arch.</P>
<P>"No…" Seven said slowly, "However…I am working." She glanced over at the
evidence, a stack of perfectly formed boards, each one shaved to within a
centimeter of perfection.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well," B’Elanna said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable as Seven studied
her. Seven’s deep blue eyes seemed to look beneath her skin, directly into her
soul, and it made the Klingon nervous. "Can’t you pick something that
seems…relevant to your situation? I heard enough of that song from the Doctor…
although I like your version much better," she said before she could stop the
words from tumbling out of her mouth.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said and then blushed. "I will try to choose a song more
to your liking."</P>
<P>"Umm, you’re welcome," B’Elanna said. She was mesmerized by the blush moving
across Seven’s skin like a wave, not just her face, but down her neck and
plunging under the fabric of her biosuit. B’Elanna wondered how far down the
color managed to spread, and then realized Seven was looking at her. It was
B’Elanna’s turn to blush. "I should get going."</P>
<P>"You will be careful?" Seven asked. She sounded genuinely concerned, as
opposed to the smug, condescending tones B’Elanna was used to hearing from her
on board <I>Voyager</I>.</P>
<P>"I will," B’Elanna promised.</P>
<P>Seven stood and went to pick up a small pack that was sitting next to her. "I
packed a nutritional supplement for you consisting of nuts, berries, and two
ration bars," Seven said as she held out the package. "I also including an
emergency blanket."</P>
<P>"Thank you…" B’Elanna was stunned by the gesture. "I… I shouldn’t be gone
more than a few hours, but this is… wow. Thanks."</P>
<P>"You are welcome. I didn’t want you to be caught unprepared. I am however,
glad that you will be… <I>back</I> before nightfall." Seven said. She had to
stop herself from calling the small encampment <I>home</I>.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed as she secured the pack to her waist. "Don’t worry, I’ll be
here to keep you warm." B’Elanna suddenly blushed anew. "I mean… I…"</P>
<P>"It is all right," Seven assured her. "Your Klingon physiology does make your
body heat… desirous. I was uncomfortable sharing our heat at first but it does
seem most…efficient."</P>
<P>"Yeah, efficient little heater. That’s me," B’Elanna said as she headed off
into the forest, escaping while she could. ‘<I>My Klingon physiology does more
than make me put off heat,’</I> she thought as she moved quickly through the
trees. ‘<I>It also makes me want to do more than share heat with you,’</I> she
thought of the previous night. <I>‘I want to generate some heat of our own.’</I>
</P>
<P>As B’Elanna moved through the trees, she remembered the night before. She and
Seven had both been shivering despite the large heated rocks Seven had moved in
to warm the shuttle. Finally, Seven got up and came to B’Elanna’s bedroll and
settled next to her, spooning her from behind. B’Elanna thought her heart was
going to beat out of her chest. She had known she was attracted to the exdrone
for some time, but in that moment, in the near darkness, she could feel Seven’s
skin before they ever touched, as if B’Elanna’s body was calling out to Seven’s.
She had asked Seven what she was doing, and Seven had slid under the blanket
next to her, replying, "Conserving heat." Seven had no idea how much heat she
was generating with the press of her lanky body against B’Elanna’s more compact
form. It took several hours for B’Elanna to fall asleep, the distraction of
Seven’s sighs and sleepy groans had made B’Elanna want to roll over and take the
former Borg into her arms. It took all of her willpower to stop from doing just
that.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna made her perimeter sweep around the valley in a few hours and the
sun was high in the sky when she returned to the cabin site. As she neared the
meadow, she heard Seven’s voice echoing across the grassy hillside. She had
taken B’Elanna’s words to heart and was singing something else. It was a song
B’Elanna was unfamiliar with, but she was taken by it none the less. She made
her way through the dense forest and found herself being as quiet as possible,
as if disturbing Seven would have been a terrible crime. She crested the last
hill to see Seven standing at one end of the cabin structure tying off boards
that would become the rafters. The exdrone was singing as she worked,
occasionally stepping back to inspect her handy work, but never losing her
perfect pitch. B’Elanna leaned against a tree and enjoyed the scene.</P>
<P>Seven continued working, tightening the ropes as she sang the chorus. <FONT
face="BellGothic BT,Arial Narrow"><I>"I want to lay down on your shoulder, just
inside your arms," </I></FONT>she sang<FONT
face="BellGothic BT,Arial Narrow"><I>. "I wanna listen to you heartbeat and your
breathing on and on. I want to lay down on your shoulder, surrender to your
peace… and go to sleep."</I></FONT> Seven moved to the pile of wood and picked
up a large board, struggling to lift it, but kept singing. <FONT
face="BellGothic BT,Arial Narrow"><I>"After we’re gone a million miles. Made
true our dreams with sweat and bone. After we build it up… with our bare hands.
Made strong a place we can call home…"</P></I></FONT>
<P>B’Elanna wondered what had inspired Seven to choose that song. Was it their
experience the night before? B’Elanna had awakened in the night to find Seven
snuggled on top of her. Seven had been mortified when she woke up a few minutes
later. She jumped up and apologized profusely. B’Elanna had chalked it up to the
fact that Seven hadn’t ever slept next to anyone and had naturally sought out
the warmth and comfort of another body. Now she wondered if the unconscious
gesture had a deeper meaning, that Seven might have feelings beyond
friendship.</P>
<P>B’Elanna shifted her weight, causing a small branch to snap.</P>
<P>Seven turned, her eyes flashing and her expression angry. "Do not ‘sneak up’
on me," she yelled, obviously embarrassed. "You have accused me of being
rude…and yet this behavior is exactly what you instruct me to avoid." She fell
back into full Borg mode as she slammed a board into place over the doorway.</P>
<P>"I didn’t mean to sneak up on you," B’Elanna said, although she had been
quite stealthy in her approach. She went to Seven and tried to help her lift one
of the larger boards. "It was beautiful," she said quietly.</P>
<P>"It was… a reflection of my mood," Seven said, and then realized what the
admission sounded like. "I am…tired, and require sleep."</P>
<P>"Oh, I see," B’Elanna said, not buying the excuse for a second. "Why don’t
you go take a nap. This isn’t a Borg cube. I don’t expect you to work yourself
into the ground."</P>
<P>"Into the ground?" Seven asked as she clenched her hands, trying to relieve
the cramping in her fingers. "Borg cubes have no ground." Seven shifted the
board, trying to get it to drop into the notch she had carved into the
rafter.</P>
<P>"I meant, don’t overdo it," B’Elanna said. She knew full well that Seven
understood. She was beginning to get a handle on the exdrone’s dry sense of
humor.</P>
<P>"I see," Seven said as she made sure the board was in place before letting
go. She stepped back and absentmindedly rubbed her sore palms.</P>
<P>"Did you hurt yourself?" B’Elanna asked, pointing at the exBorg’s hand.</P>
<P>"It is nothing," Seven replied. "We have much work to do before
nightfall."</P>
<P>"Let me see," B’Elanna insisted. She grabbed Seven’s hand and pulled it to
her. Seven held her arm firm, throwing B’Elanna off balance. "Come on, Seven.
Just let me have a peek."</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven said as she relaxed her arm and let B’Elanna examine her.
She uncurled her fingers and revealed bloodied blisters covering her fully human
palm.</P>
<P>"Kahless! Why didn’t you say something?" B’Elanna exclaimed. She tugged Seven
toward the first aid kit just inside the area that was going to be the cabin’s
living room. "This must hurt like hell."</P>
<P>"My pain is irrelevant. We must…"</P>
<P>"Not to me," B’Elanna shouted, making Seven stop mid-sentence. "Damn it. Do
you think I want you hurting?" She lifted Seven’s hand and blew on the bloodied
and overheated skin. She could smell the blood, mingled with sweat and thought
of her Klingon heritage. This was considered a romantic aroma, and yet the
thought of Seven’s blood made her chest ache. She didn’t like the idea of
anything hurting the exdrone. She wondered when her feelings had shifted toward
Seven; her animosity was gone, replaced by concern. Perhaps she had always been
attracted to her, and just hid it beneath Klingon hostility. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant?" Seven asked after a few minutes. She was enjoying the sensation
of B’Elanna’s warm hand cradling her injured appendage, but was becoming
distracted by B’Elanna’s warm breath over her sensitive skin. Seven identified
the emotion that went with the sensation. She was becoming aroused. She had to
make B’Elanna stop immediately. The way the Klingon was pursing her lips and
gently blowing on her palm was extremely distracting, as if she were frozen in
mid-kiss. "I fail to see the medicinal value of your action," Seven finally
managed to say.</P>
<P>"Huh?" B’Elanna looked up and realized what she was doing. She had been
caressing Seven’s hand while blowing across the injured area, leaving the dermal
regenerator sitting on the ground. "Oh, yeah. I…needed to make sure there wasn’t
any sawdust in the wound," B’Elanna explained lamely.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, letting the Klingon know that she didn’t quite
believe the excuse.</P>
<P>"Hold still," B’Elanna said as she healed the injury. Once finished, she
continued holding Seven’s hands in her own. She turned them over repeatedly as
if checking for any missed blisters.</P>
<P>"I believe I am fully healed," Seven said, though she was reluctant to lose
contact. She liked the way B’Elanna’s higher Klingon temperature made her hands
feel as if there were nimble infernos dancing over Seven’s skin.</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah." B’Elanna released Seven’s hands, instantly missing the weight of
her willowy fingers. "From now on, stop when you get a blister and let me heal
it."</P>
<P>"I will," Seven promised. If the tender treatment was standard procedure,
Seven hoped she got many more blisters. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two more days passed without incident, and the two women continued to sleep
curled around each other at night. Neither mentioned it, but both felt passions
awakening toward the other. Both were too afraid to mention their budding
emotions, certain their feelings were not returned.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The sun rose from behind the mountains in the east, and B’Elanna stopped her
work on the cabin roof to watch as the golden light broke over the summit. She
found the difficult work strangely rewarding, and while it didn’t involve
schematics or warp cores, there was a great deal of engineering involved in
designing the cabin. B’Elanna had insisted on a large fireplace in the middle of
the structure. It opened on two sides, one that faced the sleeping room, and
another that heating a small cooking area. The Klingon-human hybrid looked down
through the rafters into the room below and watched as Seven concentrated
intently on some project. B’Elanna smiled and leaned her chin onto her hand as
she watched as Seven worked near the hearth. After several minutes, Seven
stopped and looked up at B’Elanna and caught her staring.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, do you require assistance?" Seven asked with a tiny smile
as she shielded her eyes from the sun coming through the bare rafters.</P>
<P>"Ahh…no," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"You have quit working. Are you tired? I would be glad to take over for you."
Seven stood up and went to the ladder they had crafted a week earlier. She
grabbed a Starfleet canteen on the way and climbed the ladder with ease. "Are
you dehydrated?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. She didn’t want to admit that she had been simply
enjoying watching her companion. "Just resting." Seven handed her the water and
Torres took a long drink.</P>
<P>"If I assisted you, we could finish the roof by lunch," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"Thanks. That’s a good idea, then we can finish moving the rest of the
supplies down from the shuttle." B’Elanna looked up the hillside at the shuttle.
It was at the top of the ridge, and it would have been almost impossible to see
were it not for the angry tear across the landscape their landing had caused.
They had decided to build the cabin down by the lakeshore so that they could use
the natural protection of the mountainside and would be close to an abundant
water supply. B’Elanna turned back toward the lake and realized it was a utopian
setting.</P>
<P>Seven sat on the roof and looked down at the lake, then at B’Elanna. She had
been driven to distraction by the Klingon’s habit of striping down to her tank
top while she worked in the sun. The sun was barely up, and already B’Elanna had
been working three hours on the roof, long enough so that her arms were
glistening with sweat and her muscles were pumped into sharp angles. It was most
distracting.</P>
<P>"It’s very beautiful here," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. "Although I believe the Borg would have found this planet
unremarkable."</P>
<P>"Good thing we didn’t invite any Borg to our little party," B’Elanna said and
then took another drink.</P>
<P>"Party, indeed." Seven raised an eyebrow. She looked down at the roof, and
then turned to Torres. "I find that I am feeling a sense of…satisfaction as we
near completion of the ‘Homestead,’ and yet, I would gladly leave it unfinished
if <I>Voyager</I> were to arrive and rescue us."</P>
<P>"Well, it’s a damn fine cabin for two women who’ve spent more time in space
than they have with grass under their feet." Torres handed Seven a stack of
shingles. "You did a great job on these. I didn’t have the patience to cut
them."</P>
<P>Seven seemed uncertain how to respond to the complement. "I am certain you
could have managed." She reached for a handful of square nails from a pile near
Torres. "These nails were an insightful invention."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "I didn’t invent nails, I just figured out how to slice up
the deck plating and shape them. Now, let’s get to work. I can’t handle all this
warm and fuzzy talk." </P>
<P>Seven nodded and they went to work, both distracted by thoughts of
<I>Voyager</I> and why they hadn’t been rescued yet.</P>
