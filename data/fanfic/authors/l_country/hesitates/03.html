<P>"I want my people off that planet now," Captain Janeway demanded as she
stalked into the Overseer’s office and grabbed the data padd from the tall
woman’s hand.</P>
<P>"I have already informed you…" the Overseer began.</P>
<P>"I don’t care," Janeway said, her voice dangerous and deep. "You led me to
believe they were in a prison, not thrown into a free for all where they would
be stalked like animals."</P>
<P>"Someone on my staff has been a bit too generous with information," she said
as she came around her desk and took the data padd back from the smaller
woman.</P>
<P>"Thank you for not insulting my intelligence by denying it. I want my people
and I want them now." Janeway looked up at the imposing woman and locked her in
her gaze, daring the Overseer to argue.</P>
<P>"I wish I could help you, Captain, but it is not within my power," the
Overseer said quietly.</P>
<P>"Not good enough," Janeway said menacingly. "Give me the coordinates and I’ll
get them myself."</P>
<P>"I’m afraid it will take you seventeen years to get there at maximum warp."
The Overseer moved the comm panel on the wall. "Unless you have access to your
own wormhole."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Janeway moved closer to her, inside the taller
woman’s comfort zone, causing her lean away from the small but imposing
captain.</P>
<P>"The Nebula is artificial, as is the wormhole it conceals. Without the
wormhole, there is no way for you to reach Jusari Prime."</P>
<P>"Then I’ll use your wormhole," Janeway said. Her mind was reeling at the
possibilities an artificial wormhole represented, but until she had her missing
crewmembers, that would have to wait.</P>
<P>"That will not happen." The Overseer shook her head slowly and laced her
fingers together under her chin.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway challenged.</P>
<P>"Your ship is not able to access the wormhole or handle the gravimetric
stress once inside." She sighed and studied the captain and then stared at the
comm panel. "Even if your ship could handle the increased stress, the wormhole
cannot be opened on a whim."</P>
<P>"A Whim?" Janeway put her hand across the comm panel and leaned against the
wall. "I don’t call rescuing my people a whim."</P>
<P>"A poor choice of words," she replied. "What I meant, captain, was that the
wormhole opens when it opens. We know the gateway schedule, but you do not. And
before you think about using the previous battlecrusier flights into the nebula
to decipher the timetable, you should know that it changes each day. We have no
control over it, but after years of study we do know its complex cycle."</P>
<P>"Sounds like you’ve covered every angle." Janeway turned and rested her back
against the comm panel. "The problem is, you’ve lied to me so many times, I
don’t believe you."</P>
<P>"Your beliefs are immaterial," the Overseer said. She looked into Janeway’s
eyes and for the first time, allowed her remorse to show. "It is too late," she
whispered.</P>
<P>"What does that mean?" Janeway asked. She felt fear grip her, squeezing her
heart, pushing her down into a place so dark she wasn’t sure she could ever
climb back out. Her mind supplied the worst case scenario, that they were both
already dead.</P>
<P>"The Magistrate will be here before we can dispatch a retrieval ship. You
must speak with him, and he does not share my attitudes about this issue," she
explained.</P>
<P>"Are they alive?" </P>
<P>"As far as I know," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>"I want to know everything about this planet that you do," Janeway
demanded.</P>
<P>The Overseer said nothing for a moment as she considered the request. She
nodded and went to the comm panel. "I can show you an image of the planet, but
it will not show you much beyond the climate and continental configuration."</P>
<P>"It’s a start," Janeway moved closer to the panel and waited while the other
woman pulled up the data. The image filled the screen; Janeway stiffened and her
jaw clenched as she recognized the unusual make up of the planet. "What is the
temporal differential?" Janeway asked, her voice at its most deadly
register.</P>
<P>"I, you… how did you know?" The Overseer stepped away from the captain,
surprised by Janeway’s recognition of a planetary mutation she hadn’t know
existed anywhere else and more than a little intimidated by the chilling quality
of the small woman’s voice.</P>
<P>Janeway turned and grabbed the taller woman by the jacket and shoved her
against the wall, surprising the Overseer with her strength. "What is the
temporal differential?" </P>
<P>"Time moves 180 times faster on Jusari Prime than in the rest of the
Universe." The Overseer’s voice cracked. "By the time we can recover your
people, their sentence will be complete. Each day here is more than a half year
for them."</P>
<P>Janeway pushed away from the taller woman, her hands shaking. Every instinct
told her to choke the life out of the woman in front of her, but she was a
Starfleet Captain, and she would not give in to the primal desire. She walked to
the door and took several deep breaths before turning.</P>
<P>"I want to talk to someone who has been there," Janeway stated.</P>
<P>"That isn’t… I…I will arrange it. There is a group docking in two hours. You
may observe their arrival, but I cannot allow you to speak with them." The
Overseer saw the determined look on Janeway’s face. "It is the best I can do.
The Magistrate will be displeased that I have even offered to let you witness
their arrival." </P>
<P>"<I>Displeased</I>? I don’t think you have any idea of how <I>displeased</I>
I am, and you don’t want to see what that is going to mean to you." The
captain’s eyes narrowed, they were cold, showing no hint of the compassion
Janeway was known for.</P>
<P>"You may witness the arrival… and no more," the Overseer said. She reached
down and signaled for the guard and the door opened. The guard immediately
stepped inside.</P>
<P>"Overseer?" he asked.</P>
<P>"See the captain to her ship, and then escort her and her party to the
observation room for the next arrival."</P>
<P>"Ma’am?" he asked, obviously confused.</P>
<P>"You have my orders," the Overseer said and turned her back to the captain.
</P>
<P>"Yes, Overseer," he said. </P>
<P>Janeway followed without a word. She was too busy picturing Seven and
B’Elanna and wondering how they could survive on the planet. She walked back to
<I>Voyager</I>, her thoughts traveling back to Seven. She was still so new to
humanity and Kathryn wondered what emotional scars the beautiful young woman
would return with. She had only been on <I>Voyager</I> for three years, but she
had made so much progress. Now, trapped for almost as long on a planet full of
inmates without any humanity, all of that had probably been erased. She hoped
B’Elanna could look beyond her dislike of the tall blonde and keep her safe,
although, even as that thought crossed her mind she felt guilty. Of course
B’Elanna would do everything she could to keep Seven out of harm’s way. The
Klingon was an honorable woman with fierce loyalties to her crew. She would give
her life to save any of <I>Voyager’s</I> crew. A shiver ran through the
captain’s spine as she realized that the situation could very easily call for
that. "<I>Keep each other safe,"</I> Kathryn thought as she reached the docking
clamp to her ship. "<I>And for god’s sake don’t kill each other." </I></P>
<P>She entered the familiar corridors of her ship and headed for the bridge so
that she could call the senior staff together. On her way, she passed the
holodeck and briefly thought of Michael Sullivan. The weight of the past hit her
like a phaser blast. She couldn’t love him…it. It wasn’t real; she couldn’t go
to him and share her anguish because he could no more understand the dilemma
than he could walk off of the holodeck. Worse, she realized as she continued
toward the turbolift, there was someone she desperately needed to talk to,
needed to touch, if only for an instant to get the grounding sense of peace
their connection always offered. That someone was on Jusari Prime. </P><I>
<P>"I’m in love with her," </I>Kathryn thought, the words shocking her, causing
her to stop and lean against the wall for support. "<I>It’s always been
her.</I>" She pictured Seven standing in Astrometrics, smirking when she had
just pointed out some error the rest of the crew had missed. She remembered the
day on the shuttle when Seven had been convinced a conspiracy would be her
undoing. She remembered in exacting detail how she had asked the former Borg to
trust her, and how relief had washed through her when the forcefield came down.
She remembered kneeling down beside Seven, so close that she could see the tiny
crinkles around Seven’s eyes that were evidence of her fear, but something else
had been revealed as well. Seven eyes were a deep blue, so deep they begged to
be drowned in, blue and pleading. Those eyes that so many saw as cold chips of
ice were full of life and hope and love. "<I>She loves me,"</I> some part of
Kathryn’s mind had whispered as she had knelt at Seven’s feet like a lover
proposing marriage. That was the moment, the moment that sent her running to the
holodeck like a coward to find someone, something, to hide behind. Her love for
Seven had peeked out on the shuttle, and Kathryn had run screaming for the
nearest exit.</P>
<P>"You have to be all right, Seven," Kathryn whispered in the empty corridor.
"Come back to me and I swear I won’t let my fear stand in our way." She entered
the turbolift replaying her last conversations with Seven and realized how much
she had hurt the woman she loved. Seven had struck out at the Michael Sullivan
character, and Kathryn had missed the jealousy it exposed. "Come home to me,"
she whispered before ordering the lift to the bridge.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Snow fell lightly each day on Jusari Prime and the weeks passed quickly. The
adults in the Homestead adjusted to the routine established by its newest
member. The tiny child had a name bigger than he was. Tyralanar had been Nara’s
favorite uncle, and she proudly gave her son his name, but it was quickly
shortened to Ty. She would reserve the use of his full name for when he was
older and in trouble, much like humans who only used a child’s first and middle
name when serious discipline was about to ensue.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tach seemed content to stay at the cabin with his new son, which was fine
with B’Elanna and Seven. They would go out each morning to hunt, relishing the
time alone in the beautiful snow covered setting, although Seven let B’Elanna do
the actual killing. When Tach and B’Elanna had gone out at the break of dawn,
they quickly found a few rabbits to bring down and returned in a few hours. With
Seven along there seemed to be no reason to hurry. The two women took their
time, often pausing under the cover of a tree to just hold each other and enjoy
their surroundings. They would eventually find a rabbit or small deer, and
sometimes they would watch the animals going about the forest. B’Elanna learned
quickly to kill and dress out their meal before ‘nature watching’ because once
they had seen a rabbit hopping around in the snow or wrinkling its nose, Seven
invariably found some reason to spare the animal. Of course it was always a
logical, unemotional reason; it was too thin, or too small, or it had too much
fat, or it looked tough. B’Elanna would frown and grimly agree that yes, it was
a miserable looking animal and they would find another. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The day came to repay Kahless, and B’Elanna was both excited and nervous.
Tach had prepared the sweathouse in only a few hours, creating a domed frame and
covering it with heavy hides. He built a huge fire at the front and placed
carefully chosen stones to heat while he waited for B’Elanna to arrive.</P>
<P>"It is ready," Nara said as she stomped the snow off of her boots. She was
standing in the doorway with a smile B’Elanna couldn’t quite identify.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she wrapped herself in a thick cloak. "I’m almost
ready."</P>
<P>"We are almost ready," Seven corrected as she stood up from the chair next to
the hearth. She cradled Ty in her arms, his face nuzzling her breast as if he
expected her to provide a warm meal like his mother always did.</P>
<P>"Wait a minute." B’Elanna turned and shook her head. "I made this promise and
I will pay the debt. You are not going through this."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked as she walked past the flustered Klingon and handed Ty
to his mother. Nara smirked and went to her bedroom to change Ty’s clothes.</P>
<P>"Seven, you have no idea what this involves. It’s very demanding." B’Elanna
stood with her hands on her hips watching helplessly as Seven gathered a thick
fur cloak around her willowy frame.</P>
<P>"Are you implying that I am unable to handle its demands?" Seven leaned over
a stack of diapers and grabbed her boots.</P>
<P>"Well, no…I…" B’Elanna growled and threw her hands into the air. She was
screwed and she knew it. If she agreed that her wife couldn’t handle the ordeal
the stubborn blonde would do it just to prove her wrong, and if she conceded
that Seven could handle it, well, Seven would climb into the sweathouse with
her.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven asked with a knowing smile.</P>
<P>"Fine, but don’t come crying to me when it gets too hot," B’Elanna
grumbled.</P>
<P>"Borg do not cry," Seven said as she pulled B’Elanna into a gentle kiss.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well…what was I saying?" B’Elanna leaned against Seven and pulled her
face down for another kiss.</P>
<P>Nara cleared her throat, but the two women didn’t break their kiss. She
cleared it again, more loudly, and rolled her eyes as the two deepened the kiss.
"Let’s go," the tiny woman finally ordered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven looked at the sweathouse and thought it was the most incorrect
designation anyone could have come up with. It was a fur hut in the snow, and
she couldn’t imagine anyone sweating with the foot and half of snow that covered
the surrounding area. To call the structure a house was indeed generous. She
knew that even B’Elanna couldn’t stand up in it, and doubted she and her spouse
would be able to fit inside at the same time. </P>
<P>"You can still back out," B’Elanna said smugly as if reading Seven’s
mind.</P>
<P>"I will…adapt." Seven looked over at Tach who had settled by the fire with
his back to the sweathouse. He had Ty on his lap and was telling the infant some
long involved tale.</P>
<P>"Okay," Nara said crisply. "Take off those clothes."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened. "I am already cold. How am I supposed to sweat if I
remove my clothing?"</P>
<P>"Strip, Borg," B’Elanna said as she began tossing her clothes into a pile
next to the small dwelling.</P>
<P>Seven glanced back at Tach, and once she was convinced that he was not
looking at her wife, she smiled. "We are both going to be nude?" she asked. She
watched as B’Elanna’s nipples hardened instantly when the frigid air hit them.
Suddenly she liked this idea very much. Obviously she and B’Elanna would go
inside the cramped building and create their own heat. Seven ripped her clothing
off and stood naked in front of Nara awaiting the next command.</P>
<P>"That was fast." Nara was a bit surprised by how quickly the tall woman had
disrobed and more than a little distracted by her perfect body. She might be
married, but she was not immune to Seven’s considerable assets.</P>
<P>"Inside, my little exhibitionist," B’Elanna said. She shivered and rubbed her
arms, moving from foot to foot on the cold ground.</P>
<P>"Little?" Seven asked as she bent down to crawl into the sweathouse. B’Elanna
didn’t answer, distracted by the tantalizing view of Seven’s backside as she
wiggled through the small opening.</P>
<P>It was hot, hot and impossibly dry inside the sweathouse. Seven felt like
someone had pushed her into a plasma manifold, or perhaps under it, because the
heat was oppressive, making her feel like it was forcing her to the ground. She
felt B’Elanna’s hand on her hip, and what should have been a pleasant, arousing
caress became a distant, dull reminder to keep moving. Once inside, the former
Borg drone wondered what she had gotten herself into.</P>
<P>"Kahless, it’s like gre'thor in here," B’Elanna said. It seemed odd that a
payment to Kahless would be so much like a visit to the Klingon equivalent of
hell.</P>
<P>Seven nodded, and pressed her body onto the heat-baked soil hoping to find
cooler air at the lowest point in the tiny structure. Her body was already
covered in sweat and she realized that Tach was indeed an expert builder of
sweathouses. She sucked in air trying cool her body but the air was like an oven
and seemed to only heat her from within. This was not what she had expected.</P>
<P>B’Elanna settled onto her back on the ground beside Seven and looked over at
her. Seven’s blonde hair was soaked in sweat and sticking to her face. B’Elanna
enjoyed the silky strands and was happy that Seven was letting it grow out. She
reached over and wiped it off of her closed eyes. "I like the longer hair," she
whispered.</P>
<P>Seven opened one eye, and did not look amused. "Right now, I miss my Borg
hair style."</P>
<P>"Not on your life," B’Elanna said quietly. "I love your hair and I can’t wait
‘til you can braid it down one side."</P>
<P>Nara crawled into the tiny space and handed each woman a container of water
that they eagerly drank down. "Easy," she said. "Not too fast." Nara’s thick
brow was cover in sweat, but she seemed unaffected. She took another container
of water and poured it over the rocks filling the room with steam. Seven
instantly missed the annoying, dry heat. The steam seemed to add to her misery.
Nara noticed her discomfort and poured some water onto Seven’s back. It felt
amazing. B’Elanna raised her eyebrows in silent request and Nara poured the
water over her chest then ducked out of the room and left them alone.</P>
<P>"How long must we stay in here?" Seven asked without opening her eyes.</P>
<P>"Until we a have a vision or turn into jerky."</P>
<P>Seven kept her eyes closed and tried to relax despite the weight of the heat
on her body. She took small breaths, trying to avoid too much over heated air
entering her lungs at once and fought to relax. She had tried meditating with
Tuvok on board <I>Voyager</I> but found it inefficient. Now, she had no where
else to be, so she focused on the sound of her beloved B’Elanna beside her and
the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears. She reached over and gripped
B’Elanna’s smaller, darker hand, smiling when she felt a reassuring squeeze.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt Seven take her hand and her body relaxed, but then Seven always
had that effect on her. She shifted on the ground and took slow breaths and
waited for her Klingon side to do something. She hoped it would show up soon,
but she also hoped it wouldn’t send her running outside naked in full blood lust
looking for an enemy to slay.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Ahem." Nara cleared her throat and put her hand on her husband’s back. Tach
had his forehead gently pressed against Ty’s tiny belly and was growling, not
the most dignified thing for a scared firekeeper to be caught doing.</P>
<P>"How are they?" he asked, smiling down at Ty who whimpered when his playmate
pulled away.</P>
<P>"They will be fine," Nara said and sat next Tach. She reached over and pulled
Ty’s covers around his neck against the cold.</P>
<P>"They argue as much as we do," he said with a wry grin.</P>
<P>"Yes, and B’Elanna loses every time… just like you." </P>
<P>"Not true," he said. "Seven lets B’Elanna win sometimes…unlike you."</P>
<P>Nara smiled and snuggled closer thinking about their two friends. It was true
of course, B’Elanna won some of the daily conflicts, but more often than not,
Seven would cheat. She would look at B’Elanna with her big sky blue eyes, tilt
her head to one side, flash a meek smile, and the Klingon would give up.
Although, whenever they discussed something serious, they seemed able to come to
the best resolution, no matter who was the winner of the argument. Nara thought
she might just take that into mind the next time Tach seemed to have a valid
point.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven felt like her body was shrinking and she thought she was suffocating.
She was still stretched out on the ground with her face pressed to the dried
mud, but now she was using her Borg hand to dig a tiny hole next to her face in
hopes of finding cooler air to breathe. She felt as if she were floating, and
the only sound was her heart, or was it a drum? She had a vague memory of a
Klingon myth about the drum of Kahless, how warriors with true hearts could hear
its beat, and if they were worthy, their hearts would pound in time with it. But
that was a myth, and she didn’t believe in myths.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna remained on her back, the earth was a grounding presence until she
felt it begin to sway from side to side. She opened her eyes and realized that
she was on a ship, a ship she had seen before.</P>
<P>"Not again," she said disgustedly, and then the bargemaster turned, but
instead of the keeper of the Klingon dead, she saw her mother, Miral.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, Ka’pla," the older Klingon said.</P>
<P>"Please tell me this is a heat induced hallucination."</P>
<P>"Do not concern yourself. You are not going off to Stovocor just yet." Her
mother slapped her on the back, almost knocking her over. </P>
<P>"I should have known better than to try one of these damn Klingon rituals."
B’Elanna walked to the edge of the ship and looked over at the swirling sea of
lava. "Probably fried my brain. Seven’s gonna’ kill me if I ever wake up."</P>
<P>"You chose well, daughter. She has a true heart." Miral leaned against the
rail and mirrored B’Elanna’s gaze over the fiery surface.</P>
<P>"Yes, she does." B’Elanna turned to the hallucination. "But she’s not a
Klingon. I can’t imagine that pleasing you."</P>
<P>"She does not have to please me. It is enough that she pleases you. You must
find your own way, and not worry so much about living your life for others." She
reached out and turned B’Elanna toward her.</P>
<P>"Now, I know you’re a hallucination." B’Elanna studied the older version of
herself.</P>
<P>"You walk a path of honor. Nothing else matters. You adapt our ways for
yourself, as it should be," Miral said with a wistful smile.</P>
<P>"So, am I to believe that you are dead? Or do you just happen to be on your
own Klingon vision quest right now somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant?" B’Elanna
asked.</P>
<P>"You think too much." Her mother took her chin and turned her face to the
side and kissed her on the cheek the way B’Elanna had done to Seven during their
bonding ritual. "Be happy daughter."</P>
<P>"Thank you," she said. "I am."</P>
<P>"She is worthy of you," her mother said with a smile. "And I never thought I
would say that about anyone."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled. Hallucination or not, she was enjoying this talk.</P>
<P>"You must go back," her mother told her. "Your Be’nal needs you. She listens
to the drum of Kahless, and you must call her back."</P>
<P>"Call her back? How?" B’Elanna asked. "From where?"</P>
<P>"She hears the drum, and will leave with it unless your heart calls to her."
She leaned forward and gripped B’Elanna’s arms in a warrior’s grasp. "Go,
daughter. Be happy."</P>
<P>"What drum?" she asked as the ship began to fade. She tried to remember where
she had heard of the drum, then it hit her. It was an old myth, one she had
loved as a very small child. The warriors who had true hearts would hear the
drum of Kahless and their hearts would begin to beat with in time with it. It
was said that the truest of hearts would sometimes fade as the drum slowed and
Kahless would take them with him to Stovokor.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna yelled as she sat up, but she lost her balance in the steam
filled room.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven heard a sound, it was relaxing, and it comforted her. She opened her
eyes and found that she was in a cave. There were two people standing several
feet away with their backs to her and another was far in the distance.
"<I>Apparently</I>," she thought, "<I>I have mastered meditation, and am having
a vision." </I>It was annoying that her once rational mind was being cluttered
with such human jumbles of archetypal images.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct to unimatrix zero one," the darker figure on
the left said as it turned. It was Seven, or rather the drone she had been. "We
have been polluted by humanity. Return to the collective where we belong."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her former self and frowned, and then raised an eyebrow. "You
are an imperfect vision. I do not wish to engage you."</P>
<P>The second figure turned and Seven was looking at the person she would have
been if she had not been assimilated, Annika Hansen, beautiful, and fully human.
"Hello, Annika," the apparition said to Seven and smiled warmly. She was wearing
a billowing white dress that was waving gently despite the lack of a breeze.</P>
<P>Seven glared at the newcomer, not finding it any more appealing. "Why am I
seeing versions of myself? What kind of vision is this? Am I not supposed to
speak to great masters who will enlighten me?"</P>
<P>Annika laughed, her voice carefree and playful. "Who better to explain
yourself than us?"</P>
<P>"This human is insignificant. Seven of Nine, why do you insist on reclaiming
that which makes you weak?" the drone demanded.</P>
<P>"I am her strength," Annika said. "I am the part of her that loves."</P>
<P>"Love is irrelevant," the drone responded.</P>
<P>"And that is why the Borg will never achieve the perfection they seek,"
Annika said as she crossed her arms over her chest.</P>
<P>"Humans are weak, their necks snap easily," the drone said as she moved
toward Annika. "We will demonstrate."</P>
<P>"How can you do that?" Annika asked. "You are alone here, without the
collective to guide you, you’re a puppet with its strings cut. And you don’t
look much like Pinocchio."</P>
<P>Seven looked at the two and then sighed. She turned and walked back toward
the sound of the drum in the distance. She found the arguing pair tiresome and
didn’t want to see either one. They continued arguing even as Seven left, which
seemed wasteful since it was Seven’s vision and they were bickering out of her
range of hearing.</P>
<P>"Seven, Be’nal of B’Elanna," a deep voice said. It was a commanding voice,
yet there was a sincere quality to it. Seven turned and saw a robust and
familiar Klingon standing behind her.</P>
<P>"Well," she told the third being. "At least you are what I expected to see in
a self-induced hypnotic state. Kahless, I presume?" She studied him, and decided
that he seemed rather unremarkable. "For a god, you lack the perfect physique I
would expect. You have a rather large protruding stomach, and your incisors
needed sharpening. My wife’s teeth have a much finer edge."</P>
<P>He laughed a held his large belly. "I like you," he said taking her by the
arm and leading her away from the other two apparitions who were still arguing
with each other. "You spend your time denying both sides of yourself when you
should be embracing both."</P>
<P>"Predictable quasi-religious advice. I believe I have fallen asleep and I am
dreaming," she said.</P>
<P>"Ha," Kahless said, waving his hand dismisively. "You must do as you choose;
heed my advice or not. It matters not to me."</P>
<P>Seven walked around the cave examining the walls. "When do I wake up?"</P>
<P>"I am a warrior, not a nursemaid sent to wake you. I must go," he said and
started to fade, as he did, the drum began to slow. Seven was being tugged away
with him, then something pulled her back, away from the drum and the peace it
offered.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna yelled again. She leaned over and felt her wife’s neck, her
pulse was weak and so slow that the Klingon almost couldn’t find it. Seven
didn’t move and her hand was limp when B’Elanna squeeze it.</P>
<P>Nara crawled into the sweathouse. "What’s wrong?"</P>
<P>"It’s Seven," B’Elanna pulled Seven to her, carefully shaking her.</P>
<P>"She passed out. It happens. Let’s get her outside." </P>
<P>"No, her pulse is weak," B’Elanna said, trying not to panic. They carried
Seven outside and placed her on a fur that was spread out nearby. Tach looked
away, thinking that they were just coming out to cool off.</P>
<P>Nara knelt beside Seven and grabbed handfuls of snow and began rubbing them
onto her overheated skin. "Seven," she whispered. "Wake up. You’re scaring your
wife." She noticed that Seven had stopped sweating, despite the fact that she
had made sure both women drank plenty of water. "Tach," she said. "Go to the
cabin and bring back the medical kit."</P>
<P>Tach stood and turned, quickly averting his eyes from the two naked women.
"I’ll leave Ty over here," he said. Ty was snugly wrapped in a hard backed
carrier, which Tach set close enough to the fire to stay warm, but far enough
away to be safe and then ran for the cabin.</P>
<P>"Seven, come on, wake up," B’Elanna said as she held her lover’s face in her
hands. She felt her pulse, and realized it had slowed even more. She thought of
her mother’s words, and the drum of Kahless. She was watching her wife leave
her.</P>
<P>"I don’t know what else to do," Nara said. "She should be waking up." She
rubbed Seven’s arms and legs with snow, but nothing seemed to reach her.</P>
<P>"Help me," B’Elanna said quickly. She stretched out on her back next to
Seven. "Put her on top of me," she ordered.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Put her head here on my chest." Nara helped as B’Elanna guided Seven to her.
She held Seven’s face to her breast and breathed slowly. </P>
<P>"She should be on her back. It’s harder to breath the way you have her," Nara
protested.</P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna said. She used one hand to hold Seven’s cheek to her, and
pressed her other hand over Seven’s shoulder. She prayed she was doing the right
thing.</P>

<P>Seven heard a pounding, it was louder than the drum and she focused on the
new beat. It was steady and familiar and she pictured B’Elanna as she struggled
to move toward the sound. Her body felt light and it was so tempting to float
away, but the pounding beckoned her. She felt herself growing heavier and she
was cold, but there was something warm and soft under her. She leaned into the
warmth and breathed deeply.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven mumbled. She wanted nothing more than to go to sleep.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna said. She rubbed Seven’s back and began to sob. "I’m
right here. Come back to me, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven grumbled and wiggled closer to her wife’s warm body. She was
beginning to feel the cold air on her back.</P>
<P>"Right here, love." B’Elanna sat up, pulling Seven with her. She kissed her
temple and smiled at Nara who was looking on.</P>
<P>"Cold," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>Nara grabbed another fur and wrapped it around both women. "You all right?"
she asked B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I am now," the Klingon answered without looking up. Tach came running up to
them moments later.</P>
<P>"You’re late, as usual, Tach." Nara turned and gave her husband a shake of
her head. "Go see to your son."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna insisted on holding Seven even after tricorder scans proved that she
was all right, but Seven certainly didn’t mind. Tach took care of Ty while Nara
helped Seven and B’Elanna get dressed. They went back to the cabin, the entire
group remaining quiet on the short journey.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Back at the cabin, B’Elanna was in full mother hen mode, a strange Klingon
version, but recognizable as mother henning. She insisted that Seven go
immediately to bed and brought her a thin broth and hot tea, then sat beside her
and helped the embarrassed former Borg eat.</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven said as B’Elanna tucked her in for the third time.</P>
<P>"You almost died," B’Elanna said, choking on the words. "Damn it, just let me
take care of you for a while." She fidgeted with the blankets needing something
to keep her hands busy.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven said gently. "It is more probable that I was simply in a
deep hypnotic state and appeared to be in danger." </P>
<P>"Rest," B’Elanna ordered.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," Seven said, mimicking her wife’s favorite snide response and
then sighed and leaned back to grudgingly allow B’Elanna to move the furs up
around her neck as if she were a child. In truth Seven was uncertain what had
happened. She had experienced something, but whether it had been a hallucination
induced by the heat, a creation of her own subconscious expectations, or
something else, she was not certain. The idea that it was more than her own mind
creating complex archetypes was most disturbing to ponder. It made her entire
existence as a Borg, focused on the rational, provable sciences seem faulty.
Even though she had no desire to rejoin the collective, she found its
consistency and infallible logic comforting and didn’t like the idea of that
being turned upside down.</P>
<P>"Seven?" After still more fidgeting with Seven blankets B’Elanna finally
seemed happy with the placement of the furs and then held her wife’s fingers and
rubbed her thumb over the back the pale hand.</P>
<P>"Yes, Lana?" Seven studied her hand in B’Elanna’s, finding the contrast
compelling. She loved B’Elanna’s small hands, dark like coffee, the way they
were strong enough for any task, yet capable of incredible tenderness and
dexterity. Seven’s own hands were larger, the color more like cream, but they
had their own range of strength and gentleness.</P>
<P>"I need you to make me a promise," B’Elanna said after a few moments. Her
voice was quiet, barely a whisper, and her hands began to tremble.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven shifted her weight and sat up, but kept her one hand in
B’Elanna’s which meant that she had to manage the maneuver one handed while not
letting the furs slip down so that B’Elanna wouldn’t begin fussing again.</P>
<P>"Promise me you will never put me through this again." She saw Seven raise an
eyebrow in silent question. "First with the bear, now this…" B’Elanna explained.
"Seven, I can’t handle this again. Please promise me you won’t ever put yourself
in danger again."</P>
<P>Seven paused, then sighed and looked up. "I cannot make that promise."</P>
<P>"Please," B’Elanna asked, squeezing her wife’s hand.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I can promise you that I will not take any unnecessary risks, but
I will not make you a promise that I might have to break. Do not ask that of
me." Seven eased her hand out of B’Elanna’s and rubbed her forehead with both
hands. "We both know there are times when we must do dangerous things. I cannot
lie to you and say that I will not."</P>
<P>"All right," B’Elanna whispered after a moment. "Just be careful, and no more
ritual sweats… unless absolutely necessary."</P>
<P>"Agreed." Seven smiled, recognizing the attempt at humor. "But if I am forced
to go back into the sweathouse, next time I am ignoring the drum," she added
almost to herself.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna sat up and gaped at her wife. "What drum?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled and shook her head. "Nothing, a myth I read about somewhere. It
involved the drum of Kahless."</P>
<P>"You heard it? And you tried to follow it?" B’Elanna felt her skin erupt into
goosebumps.</P>
<P>"You are familiar with the legend?" Seven smiled, still demising the
vision.</P>
<P>"Seven, I was told to go back for you because you were being beckoned by
Kahless."</P>
<P>"Told?" Seven wasn’t yet ready to believe in any mystical revelations.</P>
<P>"In the sweat house…I had a vision. I was warned that you were in danger,
then I woke up and you were…were…" </P>
<P>"Did you see Kahless as well?" Seven asked, thinking that everyone must see
similar self-induced hypnotic images.</P>
<P>"You saw Kahless?" B’Elanna demanded. "You saw Kahless, and heard his drum,
and I got stuck with my mother?" She and paced the small room, channeling her
fear into misplaced indignation. "You’re not even Klingon."</P>
<P>"Well, he was rather unremarkable," Seven offered. "He was rotund and his
teeth were not nearly as nice as yours are." She hoped to placate her wife,
realizing that she perhaps shouldn’t have volunteered so much information.</P>
<P>"Unremarkable? Geeze, Seven, you didn’t tell Him that did you?" B’Elanna
asked as she spun back toward the bed. She studied her wife. "You did!"</P>
<P>"He seemed to appreciate my honesty," Seven said defensively. "Besides, it is
not as if it was the Real Kahless…if there even is a real Kahless. He was merely
a manifestation of my subconscious expectations," she explained. "Although I
found my other selves annoying in the extreme. As I left they were still
exchanging insults."</P>
<P>"Selves?" B’Elanna sat back down next to the bed. "What else did you
see?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven proceed to explain the entire vision and B’Elanna listened quietly,
although she did cringe when Seven repeated her insults about the greatest
Klingon warrior who had ever lived. Afterwards, B’Elanna grew very quiet before
explaining her own quest imagery. Seven found it most intriguing that they had
similar themes of self-acceptance, but dismissed it as what they both
subconsciously wanted to hear. B’Elanna wasn’t so easily persuaded. When she
brought up the drum, and her knowledge of Seven’s danger, the exBorg was
stymied, then suggested that perhaps B’Elanna had felt her pulse slowing while
the were holding hands. Still, B’Elanna leaned toward a spiritual
explanation.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Nara and Tach were thrilled with the revelations the sweat ritual provided,
though Tach didn’t want them to try it again anytime soon. He had been more
frightened than he cared to admit when he saw Seven’s limp body, and was
grateful to find her conscious when he returned. With the debt to Kahless paid,
they went about their daily routine with a new sense of purpose and belonging.
Both B’Elanna and Seven secretly believed that their arrival on the planet was
by far the greatest gift they had received.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Time passed more quickly than anyone had anticipated, and soon the day for
Tach and Nara’s sentence to end drew near. Seven found herself spending more
time with Ty. The bright boy enjoyed every minute of it as he did the time with
his beloved "Ba," as he called the Klingon. "Ba" had been his first word, which
was no surprise to Nara who had been watching her tiny son fall in love with the
rough, gruff, and surprisingly loving woman.</P>
<P>Tach and Nara were out taking a walk and Seven was cooking lunch. She heard
the muted pounding at the back of the cabin followed by a very distinctive,
demanding voice. </P>
<P>"Ba!" The pounding continued. "Ba! In… Ba in now."</P>
<P>Seven smiled and quietly walked toward her bedroom to see the tiny Narian boy
at the door using a one of his father’s extra boots as a makeshift battering ram
on the bedroom door. As expected, the door opened and B’Elanna grabbed the boy,
who squealed his mock fear.</P>
<P>"All right you little rat, now that you’ve got me, what are you gonna’ do
with me?" the Klingon asked as she picked him up over her head.</P>
<P>"Bear." Ty growled and pointed toward the giant bed that dominated the
room.</P>
<P>"Don’t you ever get tired of that story?" B’Elanna kissed his head. In truth,
she never tired of telling that particular tale. She carried Ty over by the bed
and put him on the floor. He sat on his tiny butt and wiggled from side to side
as B’Elanna yanked the giant fur off of the bed and wrapped it around her body.
It was the fur from the bear that had attacked Seven so long ago, she had tanned
the hide and it had adorned her bed soon after. The Klingon began growling and
crawling around the room, which might have been menacing except that the huge
fur dwarfed the caramel skinned warrior, leaving half of its length dragging
behind her. B’Elanna treasured the skin, it not only represented the first day
she revealed her growing feelings to her wife, but it had covered the two women
every night since they had first made love.</P>
<P>Seven stood quietly in the doorway, mesmerized my her spouse and the boy she
had grown to love with all her heart. She kept the door mostly closed so she
wouldn’t disturb the scene forming in front of her.</P>
<P>"The huge, evil bear moved through the forest looking for something…or
<I>someone</I> to eat," B’Elanna said in a deep voice. She paused to look at Ty
and snarled, but instead of scaring him, it sent him into a series of delighted
giggles. "There weren’t any little boys, so the bear sat and wished for some
lunch to come to him." B’Elanna peeked under the bed, licking her lips and
smacking her lips.</P>
<P>"Evan!" Ty offered as a suggestion to the bear in front of him. He hadn’t
quite mastered "S"s yet, and that was his version of the former Borg’s name.</P>
<P>"Hmmm," said the bear. "I think I hear something." B’Elanna laughed evilly
and crouched down under the fur. "What’s this? Here comes my lunch, and she
looks tasty."</P>
<P>Ty wiggled and scooted closer.</P>
<P>"Well," B’Elanna told Ty as she stepped back into the narrator voice. "Along
came a beautiful princess, who wasn’t looking where she was going." Of Course
the narrator wasn’t looking at the bedroom door, and was oblivious to the
"princess" witnessing the tale. </P>
<P>"The princess walked right up and sat not ten feet away from the bear and
started picking berries," B’Elanna explained, although Ty knew the story well.
"Then…" B’Elanna paused, gathering up the fur around her. "Grrrrrrrrrahh!" she
snarled as she pounced on the imaginary princess. "He tried to gobble her up,
but the princess was stronger than she looked and she punched the Bear.
Grrrrrrrrrrr." B’Elanna fell over and rolled onto her back in a mock
struggle.</P>
<P>Ty laughed and decided to assist by leaping onto B’Elanna and wrestling with
her for a few moments before she lifted him off.</P>
<P>"Then the princess escaped," B’Elanna said, "and the bear was furious." To
illustrate she howled and stomped in circles. "Then, the princess found a great
warrior who healed her wounds and went in search of the evil bear."</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty provided.</P>
<P>"Yes, it was the great warrior, Ba," she continued. "Ba searched everywhere
for the bear." B’Elanna proved the point by looking under the bed, behind the
pillows, and even lifted Ty up to check under his butt. "Finally the great
warrior found the vicious bear…" B’Elanna said, the story building to a grand
climax in typical Klingon form.</P>
<P>"And," Seven said as she burst into the room. "The "<I>Great warrior</I>"
found the savage bear…taking a <I>Nap</I> next to the lake," Seven said as she
crept over to the two dark haired playmates.</P>
<P>Ty giggled even more now that he had both of his favorite aunts with him.
B’Elanna, however, frowned and glared at the exdrone who was taking the glory
out of the tale.</P>
<P>Seven continued, her voice serious, "And the "<I>Great warrior</I>" snuck up
on the bear and killed him while he slept." Seven pounced onto B’Elanna and
pinned her to the floor with the fur trapping her inside it. Ty of course helped
by jumping onto Seven’s back. The three rolled around until Ba signaled her
defeat.</P>
<P>"All right, I’m dead already," came the muffled surrender from inside the
fur.</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway calmly explained the temporal differential of Jusari Prime to
her senior staff while her stomach was turning inside out.</P>
<P>"Two and a half years?" Chakotay asked. He was always the one to ask the
question immediately after the answer had been explained.</P>
<P>"Well, I can certainly empathize with their plight," the Doctor said smugly.
"After all, I was stranded outside of the universal time differential for
<I>three</I> years on MY planet."</P>
<P>Tom Paris wasn’t one to be outdone by a hologram. "Well, Tuvok and I were on
that planet of ours for months, and we didn’t have a nice cozy apartment like
you did," the strawberry blonde said.</P>
<P>"If you remember correctly, Mister Paris, I was on that away mission as
well." The Doctor wiped an imaginary dust particle from his holographic
tunic.</P>
<P>"You didn’t have to eat spiders," Tom responded.</P>
<P>"Enough," Janeway said, halting the escalating contest. "This isn’t a game of
‘one-ups-manship.’ B’Elanna and Seven are alone on a dangerous planet." </P>
<P>"Harry," Tom whispered loud enough for everyone at the table to hear. "After
two and half years alone with Seven, B’Elanna’s gonna’ be so happy to be back on
board I’ll be right back in with her. All that time… I’m sure she’ll have
forgiven me. Hell, Seven will have driven her nuts; she’ll be begging me to take
her back."</P>
<P>"Shut up, Ensign," the captain said. "You don’t know what the hell you’re
talking about."</P>
<P>All eyes fixed on the auburn haired captain. They weren’t accustomed to her
using such harsh words with her crew. </P>
<P>"They’re going to need all the support we can give them when they get back.
This planet is… it would make a Cardassian labor camp look like Risa." Janeway
rubbed her temples and her staff knew that if the always in control captain was
letting her tension show to this extent, the news must be grim indeed. She
proceeded to explain just how grim it was.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several hours later the Dengari escort took Janeway, Tuvok and the Doctor to
the viewing area to witness the arrival of a group of prisoners. Any hopes
Janeway had harbored were quickly dashed. They watched from behind a one way
mirror as the small groups came into the medical facilities. Most had empty eyes
that testified to the unspeakable acts they had been through. They only saw two
women arrive. </P>
<P>One was a tall Dengari, almost seven feet tall, and she looked as hard as the
planet she had just arrived from. Her features were stark and her cheeks gaunt,
but her eyes were not as dead as so many who had arrived before her. It soon
became apparent why. One of the doctors bumped into her and she grabbed him by
the arm, snapping the humerus in her grip. She was obviously one of the
predators. </P>
<P>The second woman they saw arrive was about Tuvok’s height, with light brown
hair and features almost human except that her eyes were set almost twice as far
apart. Those eyes were haunted, and her features that may have once been pretty
were darkened with bruises of various ages, suggesting many beatings. She moved
around the room like a domestic animal, going wherever the doctors pulled her,
never saying a word. They moved her to an exam area and scanned her, pausing
over her belly, then the doctors spoke off to the side and approached her again.
She nodded and they led her off to another room.</P>
<P>"What was that about?" Janeway asked the guard who had been left in the
observation room to watch them.</P>
<P>"An unwanted conception. They will terminate it." He was gruff, and the
captain had not seen him before. </P>
<P>Janeway turned back to the window and watched silently as they disappeared
through a door and out of sight. She wondered where Malok was, hoping that the
Overseer hadn’t discovered that he was the one who had told her about the
conditions on Jusari Prime.</P>
<P>Tuvok and the Doctor were quiet, but for vastly different reasons. Tuvok’s
Vulcan sensibilities were indeed put off by the vile display, but the only show
of emotion he allowed was an unconscious darkening of his features. The Doctor
was horrified by the scene in front of him and was busy trying to come up with a
treatment for Torres and Seven when they returned. His one attempt at adding a
psychiatric subroutine had been disastrous, but he knew the <I>Voyager</I>
crewmembers would need far more help than he was capable of.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After they had watched the arrival, the trio returned to <I>Voyager</I> and
the captain went immediately to her ready room. She hadn’t eaten anything all
day and despite her stomach’s growling she knew she couldn’t eat. Even coffee
didn’t interest her. She had one cup in an attempt to find some sense of
normalcy, and her body rejected it. The calm, cool, collected captain found
herself rushing for her restroom as her stomach discarded the coffee. She hadn’t
been sick to her stomach over stress since she was a cadet, and even then it had
only happened once before her first command of a war game that her father was
coming to watch. As she rinsed her mouth with the cool water from the sink she
realized that it wasn’t just the stress of not being able to do anything, it was
also the constant worry about what her two lost crewmembers were going through.
</P>
<P>B’Elanna had been through so much in her young life, but the Klingon hybrid
had made it through and was flourishing as <I>Voyager’s</I> Chief Engineer. She
had gone through a rough spot after hearing about the massacre of the Maquis
back in the Alpha quadrant, but she had managed to work through it. B’Elanna was
no stranger to horrific conditions, having witnessed Cardassian brutality first
hand. Janeway hoped that B’Elanna would draw on those experiences to make it
through her current ordeal. She also hoped that B’Elanna could help Seven
survive it as well. She knew the Klingon would physically protect Seven, but she
wondered how or if she would help Seven deal with the emotional side of what
they were going through. Neither woman was very good at expressing their
emotions and their constant animosity toward each other was legendary.</P>
<P>Seven was a great cause for concern for many reasons. Not only was Kathryn in
love with her, but Seven had issues B’Elanna did not. Where as B’Elanna had a
lifetime of humanity to draw from, Seven in reality had only the three years she
had spent on <I>Voyager</I>. Spending almost as long on the prison planet could
warp her beyond repair. Kathryn stood and went to the window and looked out at
the space station, it was clean, and well designed, and gave no outward sign of
the horrific secrets it held. She sighed and went to her couch and sank into the
cushions remembering a night she had visited with members of her crew on
"Ancestor’s day." Seven had sat next to her, their bodies leaning slightly
toward each other. Kathryn had noticed, but pushed it aside as the bond between
mentor and student. Now she knew better. </P>
<P>She thought about the gentle soul Seven hid within, about the way Seven
interacted with Naomi Wildman, and the way Seven continued to stand up for the
Doctor, despite his many hurtful actions. Janeway had been hurt and angry when
the Doctor had wanted to stay and live with his adoring "fans" on a planet
recently, as she had when he had tortured Seven on Ransom’s order during the
<I>Equinox</I> fiasco. But Seven, she took it all in stride, accepting that in
the case of the <I>Equinox</I>, he had no choice once his ethical subroutine was
deleted. She even offered to help him add safeguards against further tampering,
and as for the Doctor’s willingness to abandon <I>Voyager</I>, Seven took that
in stride too. She had been hurt, but when the Doctor’s fans found a new flavor
of the week, it was Seven who went to the Doctor to make him feel better.
Kathryn prayed that by some miracle that gentle soul would find a way to endure
on Jusari Prime. She prayed that when she returned she would be able to reclaim
the humanity that was new to her, and most of all, she prayed that Seven could
forgive a foolish captain for not admitting her love. Kathryn became more aware
with each passing second how much her heart belonged to the former Borg. So much
so that the captain had accessed the hologrid and deleted the Michael Sullivan
character, which took some doing considering she had locked herself out of the
hologram’s character subroutine weeks earlier to avoid making anymore changes.
Luckily, Kathryn was quite experienced at bypassing computer lockouts. She
sighed and stretched out on the small blue couch, and wished that people were as
easy to alter as holograms. If they were, she could simply erase any bad
memories Seven brought back with her from Jusari Prime. It never for once
entered Kathryn’s mind that the memories Seven was forming on the planet were
the happiest of her life, or that those pleasant memories would form an
impossible barrier to the exdrone’s heart that negative ones never could
have.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Nara and Tach sat near the fire with Ty between them, not wanting him out of
their reach when the beam out began. The entire day before they had let B’Elanna
and Seven keep the boy with them. They knew the two women would miss their son
and they wanted to give Ty a chance for a few more memories with his aunts. What
would have been a day of celebration anywhere else on the prison planet was a
somber one for the cabin’s occupants. They felt like their family was being
split in half.</P>
<P>"Now, B’Elanna," Tach said seriously. "You take care of Seven, and keep her
out of trouble."</P>
<P>"I will," B’Elanna responded. Her eyes kept being drawn back to the dark
haired boy in Nara’s arms. Ty was sleeping after his breakfast and didn’t
understand why he didn’t have to go to his bed for his nap, but he seemed more
than willing to doze off in his mother’s arms.</P>
<P>"I will make sure that B’Elanna does not continue to follow in Tach’s clumsy
footsteps," Seven said with a halfhearted smile. In the time the Narians had
been on the planet, Tach had broken his leg twice and his arm once. B’Elanna had
tumbled down a hillside recently and dislocated her shoulder. All of the
injuries were easily treated, but painful nonetheless.</P>
<P>"Oh, hush," B’Elanna whispered as she leaned back against Seven.</P>
<P>"We’ve come to love you both." Nara had tears in her eyes. "When you leave
here, if you can’t find that Starship of yours, you come live with us on Nador
Omega. We can always use help on a farm, and I know Seven is a great
seamstress."</P>
<P>"There’s always room for family," Tach added.</P>
<P>"<I>Voyager</I> has a long head start, although I don’t know how long they
may have stayed to search for us." B’Elanna turned and smiled at Seven. "Our
shuttle is pretty fast, and maybe Seven can rig us a slipstream. I’m not giving
up on getting home just yet…but, if we can’t find them… we will keep your offer
in mind."</P>
<P>"<I>Voyager</I> is the first family I knew after leaving the collective. I
seem to have a knack for finding members of my family I never knew I had." Seven
looked over at Ty and then squeezed B’Elanna to her chest. "B’Elanna’s home is
in the Alpha Quadrant, and we must try to return, but if that is not to be, I
would be happy to come to Nador Omega."</P>
<P>"You’re wrong," B’Elanna whispered and turned to look into Seven’s eyes. "The
Alpha Quadrant isn’t my home. It’s just a place. My home is right here,"
B’Elanna said as she placed her hand over Seven’s heart.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed, trying to move the lump in her throat.</P>
<P>"You two act like you’re still newly joined," Tach said as he rolled his
eyes. Nara hit him with a well-placed elbow to the ribs and he winced. "See what
I have to put up with?" he said.</P>
<P>"It is almost time," Seven said quietly. They all grew serious, knowing that
Seven’s ability to track time was almost flawless. If the Dengari were true to
their word, the beam out would be very soon. </P>
<P>The talked for several more minutes and Tach held a small box of tools to his
chest, hoping that they would be beamed out with them. They had belong to his
father, and he cherished them, but if they were left behind, at least B’Elanna
and Seven could use them for the last months of their own sentence. Without
warning Tach and Nara and Ty began to sparkle and then disappeared, taking the
toolbox with them. Seven squeezed B’Elanna tighter and began to cry. She was not
alone; B’Elanna’s own cheeks were wet with hot, salty tears.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The night shift came and went on board <I>Voyager</I>, and Janeway was awake
the entire time. She was a woman of action, and not used to waiting helplessly
while people she was sworn to protect suffered. Especially when one of them was
the woman she loved. Hours passed for her, but she knew days were whipping by on
Jusari Prime. So she waited, enduring each minute, knowing that certainly Seven
and B’Elanna were going through hideous atrocities at the hands of god knew
who.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Wake up, Lana," Seven whispered to her lover who was slumbering deeply. </P>
<P>B’Elanna was in a comfortable, warm place, but the graceful hand that was
teasing her nipples awake was too much to resist. She smiled and arched into the
caress.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven repeated and began kissing her wife’s throat, nipping the
delicious caramel skin.</P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna moaned and then wrapped her arms around Seven’s shoulders.
"Yes?" she asked, drawing the word out.</P>
<P>"Wake up…I am ready for breakfast." Seven ran her hand over B’Elanna’s belly.
Neither woman wore anything to sleep in, enjoying the feel of flesh on
flesh.</P>
<P>B’Elanna pried one eye open and studied her lover incredulously. "Breakfast?"
She groaned and kissed Seven’s temple. "I am so whipped," she whispered. "All
right, Be’nal. You want breakfast… I’ll get you breakfast. Are there any of
those duck eggs left over from yesterday?" </P>
<P>"I do not want eggs," Seven whispered and moved her lips down to B’Elanna’s
nipple.</P>
<P>"Oh, god," B’Elanna said as her body screamed out for more. "You keep that up
and I’m not gonna’ be willing to get out of this bed."</P>
<P>"That is exactly what I had in mind for breakfast." Seven pressed her leg
onto B’Elanna’s center causing the Klingon to growl deeply, the sound making
Seven moan and bite her lover’s chest in response. Seven loved the deep, feral
sounds her wife made when she touched her.</P>
<P>"And here I thought I was gonna’ have to make Borg barley." B’Elanna ran her
hands though Seven’s hair, which had grown out and now reached more than halfway
down to her waist.</P>
<P>"Lay back… I will get my breakfast ready. You need only be awake to enjoy
it." Seven continued rubbing her leg from B’Elanna’s hips down her legs and then
back. Each pass made the Klingon more vocal. </P>
<P>B’Elanna sucked in a breath, fighting the urge to flip Seven onto her back
and get her own breakfast from between the former drone’s long legs. There were
some advantages to having the cabin to themselves again, the most wonderful
being the fact that their lovemaking was as spontaneous as it had once been.
There didn’t seem to be anywhere in the Homestead that Seven didn’t find
arousing, be it the kitchen table, in front of one of the two fireplaces, in the
pantry, or the more traditional bedroom.</P>
<P>"Umm," Seven whispered into B’Elanna’s chest as her hand slid down and tested
the waiting wetness between B’Elanna’s legs. "I believe my breakfast is
ready."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah, it’s ready," B’Elanna responded. She had handfuls of Seven’s
blonde hair, loving the way it felt between her fingers. She let the satin
strands slip away as her lover moved ever southward on her overheating body.</P>
<P>"Good," Seven answered. She kissed the well toned abdomen and raked her teeth
over the muscles while her leg expertly parted B’Elanna’s. Her hands were
lingering higher, one over each of B’Elanna’s breasts, gently tugging at the
nipples in unison. She would shift her grip and rub the palms of her hands over
the rigid peaks and then grip the entire fleshy weight of Lana’a breast in an
unhurried massage that drove the Klingon to brink of oblivion. Many times
Seven’s attentive touch on her breasts would bring B’Elanna to release, but
Seven had other plans on this morning. </P>
<P>"Oh, yes," B’Elanna whispered as she felt Seven moving further down.</P>
<P>Seven inhaled deeply once she reached her goal, her eyes closing when the
musky fragrance filled her senses. She placed her mouth over B’Elanna and
exhaled, her hot breath heating the area even more. B’Elanna screamed
incoherently and relaxed her body, awaiting whatever Seven had in mind for
her.</P>
<P>"Mine," Seven said with a wicked grin. She raked her tongue up the length of
her wife’s opening gathering the thick juices as she went.</P>
<P>"Sweet Kahless, yes. I’m yours…yours, Seven."</P>
<P>"I know," the exBorg answered and went back for another leisurely swipe. She
moved her hands down and wrapped them around her lover’s strong thighs and
parted them further, then drove her mouth into B’Elanna’s pulsing center. The
contact was firm, but unhurried, lingering with thorough enjoyment. When Seven
needed more contact, she lifted one of B’Elanna’s legs over her shoulder and
drove her tongue inside the Klingon.</P>
<P>"Yours, only yours," B’Elanna promised, her hands finding Seven’s head and
stroking her temples to encourage her.</P>
<P>"Mine," Seven growled into her lover. She needed more, so she brought
B’Elanna’s other leg up over her shoulder, but didn’t stop there. She pushed the
coffee colored leg higher, opening Lana to her, then twisted so that she could
get a better angle and enjoy every bit of the divine essence. B’Elanna, always
willing to offer assistance, grabbed her own leg and opened herself even wider
and Seven rewarded her by releasing the leg and letting her hand join her
mouth.</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah," B’Elanna managed to whisper as she began to hyperventilate. She
felt Seven’s fingers tease her opening, dipping only slightly inside, and then
backing out to circle her. A thin sheen of sweat covered both of their bodies,
testimony to their mutual enjoyment of the activity, and B’Elanna arched into
her lover.</P>
<P>Seven sucked on B’Elanna’s engorged lips, and then moved back up to give the
painfully hard nub a slow, gentle suck. She let her fingers edge inside of
B’Elanna, moaning as she felt the slickened muscles quiver as she drove deeper.
She shifted her face from side to side, letting her whole face stimulate her
lover. Seven’s fingers drove even deeper, then paused as the muscles around them
pulsed and then clinched to keep them in place. Once B’Elanna’s inner walls
gripped her in place, she knew her lover was close. She tugged her fingers back,
not enough to pull out, but enough to cause B’Elanna’s grip to tighten to hold
her. This was Seven favorite moment. She knew she had her beloved wife in the
palm of her hand, in more ways than one. She could shift her fingers, just
enough to imply movement and cause her lover to spasm, and that was exactly what
she did, over and over again until B’Elanna was howling for release.</P>
<P>"Please, my Be’nal, let me go," the proud warrior begged. "Let me fall."</P>
<P>"Never," Seven responded. "I will never let you fall. I will always catch
you." She went back to the salty sweetness and drove the Klingon higher. "But I
will let you come," she said. With that she pinned B’Elanna’s center in place
with a gentle bite, not hard enough to cause pain, but enough to trap the
hardened clit as it peeked out of its hood. Seven’s tongue danced across the
tiny muscle and she began to thrust inside B’Elanna, the length of her fingers
drawing in and out of the fevered passage. </P>
<P>B’Elanna was lost, awash in the sensations, and then, her body froze, and she
drew in a long ragged breath and held it while her very being shook with
release. After the little death she released the breath in a long howling cry of
Seven’s name.</P>
<P>Seven crawled up the sweat-covered body of her lover and collapsed onto her
chest. She had climaxed several times while pleasuring her wife. She buried her
face between B’Elanna’s breasts while she tried to bring her heartbeat back to
normal, then just relaxed and let her weight press down on the exhausted
Klingon. </P>
<P>They clung to each other like shipwreck survivors to a log in a storm. Each
woman’s arms heavy from her sated exhaustion, but unwilling to relinquish their
grip for fear the moment might be lost. Seven finally began to stir, her body
recovering first, and she placed tiny kissed on the skin beneath her.</P>
<P>"I love you, Lana," she whispered and then climbed up and fell half onto the
pillow, with half of her weight still on her wife.</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna whispered, turning her head to kiss whatever part of Seven
that she could, which happened to be her narrow nose. </P>
<P>"Forever." Seven edged a bit closer so that their sweat covered foreheads
pressed together. She would have crawled inside of B’Elanna’s skin if possible,
so deep was her need to connect on every level. They stayed there for several
minutes, silly grins covering their faces like lovestruck teenagers, and then
B’Elanna’s eyes darkened and she eased back.</P>
<P>"I want to have a baby," B’Elanna whispered. "I know we don’t have any way to
do that while we’re trapped here, but as soon as we leave here in three months,
I want to find a doctor to help us get pregnant… I mean, if you want to…" </P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. "I want to. But, we don’t have to wait unless you want
to," she added.</P>
<P>"Darling, I know you’re a regular Swiss Army knife, but unless you’ve got an
implant I haven’t seen…I don’t see how we can." B’Elanna smiled, relieved that
Seven was as eager to have a baby as she was.</P>
<P>"While the Borg found single cell fertilization slow and much more time
consuming than assimilation, there were times when it was necessary," Seven
explained.</P>
<P>"Borg sex?" B’Elanna asked, then jealousy flashed across her features. "You
never…you didn’t, did you?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She leaned over and gave B’Elanna a chaste kiss. "However I
am…equipped to perform the procedure."</P>
<P>B’Elanna pulled back and then took a lingering look between her wife’s legs.
</P>
<P>"I don’t think so, love," B’Elanna said and broke into a fit of very
non-Klingon giggles.</P>
<P>"Very funny. Your ability to amuse yourself never ceases to amaze me." Seven
raised her eyebrow and the Borg eyepiece along with it.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry, Seven, but…okay…" She pulled Seven back to her. "I really am
sorry. How can you… we… you know?"</P>
<P>Seven paused, uncertain if she should continue. She had made the offer
without considering that B’Elanna might not be willing to endure all that the
procedure entailed. </P>
<P>"Hey?" B’Elanna lifted Seven’s chin so that she could look into her eyes.
"Can you really do this? Can we?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but it would be… it would involve my assimilation tubules."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened, but then she realized that Seven would never do
anything to hurt her. "Tell me how."</P>
<P>"It is simple," Seven said. "When Borg ships became stranded, or passed
through an area devoid of any new species to…assimilate, the Collective used
other methods to increase the number of available drones. Drones considered to
have the most desirable traits were used to procreate."</P>
<P>"Oh?" B’Elanna said, the jealousy edging back to the surface.</P>
<P>"I was never in the position to need this technique," Seven said. "But I am
capable of utilizing it. I can explain it to you in detail." </P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. "Don’t explain it to me. Show me."</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway hadn’t slept in the days since she had found out the truth
about Jusari Prime. She went to her quarters only to take a sonic shower and
change into a clean uniform. The mere thought of eating made the Starfleet
captain sick to her stomach and even water made her queasy. She worked around
the clock, trying to figure out some way to activate the artificial wormhole,
but she simply didn’t have enough information to even begin to solve the
problem. Her body began to tire, and her temper grew with each hour. </P>
<P>Kathryn was in her ready room, at her desk, when she heard the door chime
announcing someone’s arrival.</P>
<P>"Come in," she said quietly. She straightened in her chair trying to at least
look like she wasn’t dying inside.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said as he approached her desk. </P>
<P>"Have a seat," she said as she motioned to the chair across from her. He
raised an eyebrow, preferring to stand, but knowing she would not continue until
he sat. </P>
<P>"Thank you," he said as he gracefully lowered himself to the chair.</P>
<P>"What can I do for you, old friend?"</P>
<P>He took a deep breath and regarded her.</P>
<P>"Must be serious if you need to think that hard about the answer," Kathryn
said. </P>
<P>She had a way of making anyone comfortable, but Tuvok was Vulcan, so such an
action was wasted on him. It did however give him a few more moments to
formulate his answer. The Doctor had asked him to speak to her, feeling Chakotay
had been a little too eager to disobey her orders lately and that she might be
more likely to respond to the friend she had known longest on the ship.</P>
<P>"It has been brought to my attention that you are neglecting your own
health," he said bluntly. </P>
<P>"Oh?" she asked, leaning back into her chair defiantly. "And isn’t that
normally an area the Doctor or even First Officer should address with me?"</P>
<P>"The Doctor," Tuvok said distastefully, "Was uncertain of your willingness to
listen to your First Officer."</P>
<P>"And the Doctor was too chicken to speak to me himself," Janeway finished for
him.</P>
<P>"He was…reticent…given his recent request to leave the ship and his
subsequent return under less than stellar circumstances," Tuvok said. "I
was…drafted."</P>
<P>"I see." Janeway stood. "Join me on the couch?" It was not a request.</P>
<P>"You have not been taking any off time to rest in your quarters," Tuvok
accused. "And given your appearance, I do not believe you have slept in your
ready room either."</P>
<P>"I’m having a bout of insomnia, nothing more." Janeway sat at one end of the
couch and leaned her chin onto her fist. "Nothing that should alert the head of
security."</P>
<P>"And you have not eaten in the mess hall," he added. He noticed that neither
her customary coffee, nor her second favorite, a pot of tea, was anywhere to be
seen. "And before you tell me you have been eating alone, I should inform you
that I have accessed your replicator rations and I know that you have not eaten
anywhere else either." </P>
<P>"I don’t think I like you taking such an interest in my personal life,"
Janeway said, her voice deepening.</P>
<P>"Believe me, I do not enjoy it," he said. "Nevertheless, the fact remains
that as captain your health effects the safety of the ship and therefore it does
fall under my discretion."</P>
<P>"Tuvok, I’m fine. Or at least I will be once we get B’Elanna and Seven back
on board." Kathryn rubbed her eyes and sighed. "It’s part of being captain. When
some of the lambs are out of the fold, you don’t sleep."</P>
<P>"I believe this particular shepherd needs to consider her own health a
priority." Tuvok had the annoying habit of using one’s own analogy against
them.</P>
<P>"Point taken," she said but she and Tuvok both knew she had no intention of
altering her behavior.</P>
<P>"Captain, I do not believe the only issue is…lost sheep." He straightened his
posture, not entirely comfortable with where he was about to take the
conversation.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Kathryn’s tone made it clear that she was even less pleased with the
conversation than he was.</P>
<P>"I believe it is more a matter of which sheep are missing," he said. "Or
rather…a particular sheep."</P>
<P>"Let’s leave the sheep out of this and get to the point."</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow and nodded his agreement. "You are in love with Seven
of Nine."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"I believe you to heard me." Tuvok suddenly found his tunic too tight around
his throat and had to fight the urge to tug at the collar.</P>
<P>"I hope not, because that topic is off limits. Did the Doctor make this
little diagnosis on his own?" Janeway stood and paced. If her stomach hadn’t
been empty, she would have thrown up.</P>
<P>"The Doctor is unable to recognize his own feelings for Seven, I doubt that
he has any idea about yours. He is rather…self-absorbed where emotions are
concerned," Tuvok said. He actually flinched when the captain spun around and
glared at him. "I have known you long enough to recognize the depth of your
romantic attraction," Tuvok stated. </P>
<P>"I’m not going to discuss this with you," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Then who will you discuss it with? Because your concern for her is
interfering with your duty to this crew." He stood and walked over to her.</P>
<P>"I have never let anything interfere with my duty to this crew," she snapped.
She thought about the Sullivan hologram, and how her sense of duty had made her
choose it over the woman she loved. </P>
<P>"Your maintenance of your own health is one of your primary duties," he
pointed out.</P>
<P>"What do you suggest?" She rubbed her forehead, feeling a first class
migraine trying to take hold, and she damn sure wasn’t about to ask the Doctor
for something to stop it.</P>
<P>"For now, nothing," he said logically. "All we can do is wait until tomorrow
when Lieutenant Torres and Seven are released. Until then, I suggest that you go
to your quarters and rest… even if that requires a sedative. Once they are back
on board, I suggest that you tell Seven how you feel."</P>
<P>"You can’t be serious."</P>
<P>"Vulcans are always serious." He raised an eyebrow making his face seem even
sterner to prove his point. "When Seven was last on board, her actions indicated
that at one point she returned your feelings." He linked his hands behind his
back. He hated dealing with humans and their inability to see or face their
emotions. If a species was going to have emotions, he thought the least they
could do was to deal with them.</P>
<P>"At one point?" Kathryn asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Her actions suggest that she was… displeased with certain of your actions."
Of all the emotions Tuvok had to deal with when working with humans, love was by
far the most unsightly. "I believe that she was jealous of your
<I>involvement</I> with… the hologram." He found the prospect of humans loving
holographic representations of beings even more disturbing. "I do not believe
she wished to retain the feelings that she had for you after that event."</P>
<P>"I hurt her," Kathryn translated.</P>
<P>"That is what I said." Tuvok nodded.</P>
<P>"And that’s supposed to make me feel better?" she asked with a wry grin that
never reached her eyes.</P>
<P>"My motive for speaking to you was to get you to sleep, not to alter your
emotions. If you wish to do that, I am not the person to speak to." </P>
<P>"And let me guess, I should talk to Seven, right?"</P>
<P>"That has yet to be seen. Given the situation in which she has been immersed,
her state of mind cannot be calculated." Tuvok considered his next words
carefully. "She is a highly logical being, but the conditions on Jusari Prime as
well as the simple passage of time may have altered her emotions. As humans say,
‘out of sight, out of mind.’"</P>
<P>"What about, ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder?’" Kathryn said, mostly to
herself.</P>
<P>"Humans are full of inconsistencies," he said with a sigh. "How Seven will
react is an unknown variable. Add to that, the fact that we know nothing of what
she is experiencing, and the possibilities are…incalculable."</P>
<P>"So what are you suggesting?" Kathryn asked with a confused look.</P>
<P>"That you contact the Doctor and have him prescribe a sedative and rest until
tomorrow."</P>
<P>"Take two pills and call you in the morning?" Kathryn asked with a shake of
her head.</P>
<P>"Captain?"</P>
<P>"Never mind," she said. "I’ll contact the Doctor."</P>
<P>"When?" Tuvok asked. He knew about the captain’s tendency to procrastinate if
it involved her own well being.</P>
<P>"Point taken. I’ll log off duty and call him as soon as you leave," she
promised.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Are you certain?" Seven asked. She reached out and took B’Elanna’s hand. "I
would be required to… use my tubules to remove the genetic material from your
ovarian follicles."</P>
<P>B’Elanna crinkled her face at that particular prospect, but she had decided.
</P>
<P>"And then, I’d be pregnant?" the Klingon asked.</P>
<P>"No." Seven’s eyes widened. "I thought you understood, I would have to carry
our child."</P>
<P>"But, what about your nanoprobes?" B’Elanna asked. She sat up in the bed and
eased Seven up until she was sitting next to her. "Wouldn’t that mean the baby
would be Borg? Would it be a drone?"</P>
<P>"I would never create a child under those conditions," Seven assured her
wife. "When the Borg reproduce in this fashion, the fetus has no implants. It is
born fully organic. Only after its birth can the assimilation begin. The
nanoprobes that are present in the host drone… the mother… are not present in
the child’s body at birth. It was discovered that any attempts to assimilate the
fetus internally would cause spontaneous abortion. Our child would not become
Borg unless it were to be assimilated after its birth, like any other child,
human or Klingon."</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" B’Elanna asked. "We don’t have access to the medical
facilities to remove implants like the Doctor did with you."</P>
<P>"I am positive," Seven said. "There are memories in the Collective mind of
times the host…the mother… was injured, or killed during combat when close to
birth. On all of those occasions the child was delivered and could not be
retrieved. Those children were fully organic, and as so, they were expendable,"
Seven said in a whisper. The thought of a child being expendable cut her deeply.
She thought of Ty, and Naomi, and realized that she would give her life to save
either of them.</P>
<P>"If you’re sure, let’s do it." B’Elanna leaned over and pressed her lips to
Seven’s, letting her mouth relax into her lover’s. Seven moaned and deepened the
touching of lips to a fiery kiss, her arms surrounding B’Elanna and guiding her
back into the bed.</P>
<P>They spent a the next ten minutes just kissing, relaxing into the other’s
touch. Once Seven felt her wife’s body molding completely to hers, she
began.</P>
<P>Seven explained each step as she was doing it, mingling the technological
description with caresses and kisses so that their child would be born of true
lovemaking and not a sterile Borg procedure.</P>
<P>Seven’s touch was passionate, but tender, as it always was. Her hand made its
way across B’Elanna’s belly. She massaged the area around B’Elanna’s navel,
making the Klingon giggle and squirm. </P>
<P>"You know I’m ticklish there," B’Elanna said into Seven’s mouth. She bit
Seven’s lip, holding it in place while she ran her tongue over the delicate
flesh. Seven smiled and tugged away and then leaned back to taste B’Elanna’s
mouth again, then pulled away and looked down to where her hand was resting on
B’Elanna’s stomach.</P>
<P>"My tubules will enter through your abdominal wall. It is smaller than the
assimilation tubule, only large enough to remove one of your ova," Seven
explained. She waited for B’Elanna to nod before continuing. "There may be some
minor discomfort. I am sorry, Be’nal. I promised to never hurt you."</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna whispered. "We made this decision. I know you wouldn’t hurt
me on purpose. Besides, I’m a Klingon, we live for pain," she joked. Seven
smiled and nodded.</P>
<P>"I love you," Seven whispered. A tiny tubule came out of the back of her
hand, barely bigger than a thread and B’Elanna briefly wondered if it was big
enough for the task. The tubule slithered over B’Elanna’s tummy, and then tilted
into her flesh. She took in a startled breath, surprised more than injured. </P>
<P>Seven looked up to her, worry covering her pale features.</P>
<P>"Surprised me," B’Elanna explained.</P>
<P>Seven raised her eyebrow and then went back to her task. "The tubule is now
entering the follicle, finding the most mature ova," Seven described. "It has
it." She leaned forward and watched as the tubule extracted itself.</P>
<P>"That’s it?" B’Elanna asked. "I’ve had worse hangnails."</P>
<P>"Now, I must remove my ova," Seven said. She reached for her own stomach, but
B’Elanna’s hand covered hers.</P>
<P>"I want to help," B’Elanna whispered and then guided her lover’s hand into
position. A tubule appeared, but it was the thicker assimilation tubule, dozens
of times bigger. "Hey, why is it bigger?"</P>
<P>"It is necessary," Seven assured her. "This tubule must not only harvest my
ova, but hold both ovum while they are matured. Then two of my specialized
nanoprobes will enter the ovum and prepare them for joining. Once that is done,
I must wait until the cells are joined."</P>
<P>"How long?" B’Elanna asked as the tubule moved over Seven’s skin.</P>
<P>"A few minutes, the nanoprobes speed up the initial bonding." Seven could see
the concern on B’Elanna’s face. "I will be fine." The tubule angled into Seven’s
tender skin, disappearing into the tissue. The larger tubule was more intrusive,
causing Seven to wince. </P>
<P>"I’m here." B’Elanna squeezed her wife’s hand offering what support she
could.</P>
<P>Seven nodded. "My ova has been extracted. The ovum are developing." Seven
took a deep breath and closed her eyes, trying to focus on the life being
created and not the sharp pain in her abdomen. She felt B’Elanna’s lips on her
forehead and opened her eyes to see B’Elanna’s deep brown eyes studying her
face.</P>
<P>"You okay?" Concern colored B’Elanna’s words and her voice cracked. Seven
nodded and rested her forehead against B’Elanna’s. A thin layer of sweat covered
Seven’s pale skin.</P>
<P>After several minutes, Seven lifted her head. "The ovum are fully developed.
The nanoprobes are joining them together."</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned over and brushed her lips over Seven’s. "Kiss me," she
breathed. "Our child is being conceived." Seven whimpered and kissed her. It was
a loving, delicate, and sensual kiss, meant to affirm their love instead of
inflame the passion that was always brewing just below the surface and they both
began to cry.</P>
<P>"They are joined," Seven breathed in B’Elanna’s mouth. "Our child is within
me, waiting to be implanted in my womb."</P>
<P>"I love you," B’Elanna whispered. She kissed away the tears from Seven’s
cheek, knowing that the salty taste would always remind her of this moment.</P>
<P>Seven inhaled sharply and her body stiffened, her eyes squeezing tightly
shut.</P>
<P>"Are you all right?" B’Elanna asked. Seven nodded but bent over and
panted.</P>
<P>"The Borg are… meticulous. Merely placing the joined cells onto the wall of
my uterus is not sufficient. The tubule is boring into the tissue to assure
implantation," Seven said calmly, but her face was sweating heavily.</P>
<P>"I’m here, Be’nal." B’Elanna held Seven to her, careful to not bump the
tubule.</P>
<P>Seven’s breathing slowed, and her body relaxed. "It is finished," she
whispered. They watched as the tubules retracted and disappeared into Seven’s
hand. Seven rolled onto her back and took a few gulps of air while B’Elanna
snuggled up to her.</P>
<P>Tears streamed down Seven’s cheeks, falling onto the back of B’Elanna’s neck.
She turned, and studied Seven. </P>
<P>"Are you okay?" B’Elanna asked again.</P>
<P>"Yes, my Be’nal," Seven said. She turned and kissed B’Elanna tenderly. "This
is the first time my tubules have ever created a life instead of destroying
one." She lifted B’Elanna’s hand and placed it on her belly and held it in place
over their growing child.</P>
<P>They stayed in that position for a long time, until finally a kink in
B’Elanna’s neck forced her to shift her weight. "What’s happening now?" B’Elanna
asked as she settled back down beside Seven.</P>
<P>Seven turned and stared at her wife, then she began laughing. "B’Elanna, I do
not know. I only knew what was happening before because my tubule was performing
the actions. From now on, I will not know anymore than any other…mother," the
last word stuck in her throat.</P>
<P>"We’re gonna’ have a baby," B’Elanna whispered.</P>
<P>"A daughter, " Seven corrected. "We have no Y-chromosomes, so we cannot have
a male child. That would require a Y chromosome which can only be derived from a
male donor."</P>
<P>"A daughter," B’Elanna repeated with a goofy grin. She seemed to have lost
the ability to do more than repeat short phases.</P>
<P>"You will…however, have to…breast feed," Seven informed her. "My nanoprobes
will not allow my body to produce milk. It was considered an inefficient energy
source. You can be given an injection to stimulate milk production."</P>
<P>"Breast feeding? Wow." B’Elanna’s speaking ability had still not returned.
Seven hoped it didn’t last for the entire pregnancy.</P>
<P>"Not for nine months," Seven pointed out and kissed B’Elanna’s forehead,
checking for a fever to explain the loss of her ability to speak in complete
sentences.</P>
<P>"Nine months," B’Elanna repeated. Seven smiled and decided to give her
beloved Klingon a while to assimilate the information.</P>
