<P>"Move!" B’Elanna yelled as she sprinted toward the turbolift, dodging
crewmembers in the corridor. "Computer, hold turbolift on deck ten, main
Engineering." She rushed into the lift, her mind replaying the sound of Seven’s
screams. "Sickbay, emergency express," she ordered. The decks moved by too
slowly for the Klingon. She swore that she could see the decks inching past.
"Come on!" she yelled.</P><I>
<P>*"Command not recognized. Please restate request,"* </I>the computer
responded.</P>
<P>"Hurry up," B’Elanna said, although she knew the express command would get
her there as quickly as possible.</P><I>
<P>*"Turbolift speed already at maximum."*</P></I>
<P>B’Elanna pounded her fist against the door, willing it to move faster. She
remembered when she and Seven had crashed on Jusari Prime and how Seven had
snapped her own arm to get out of the restraints. Seven had shattered the bones
in her arm and she hadn’t so much as whimpered. B’Elanna shuddered as she
wondered what could possibly make her wife scream out in agony.</P>
<P>The lift stopped and B’Elanna ran toward sickbay. She could hear Seven
screaming, but not just screams of pain. Seven was terrified, devastated by the
sound of her voice. She was screaming "No!" over and over. B’Elanna ran into a
crewman and was knocked to floor on top of him. She quickly climbed back to her
feet and sprinted the last few meters to sickbay as she heard Seven let out a
wounded howl that almost tore B’Elanna’s heart out of her chest.</P>
<P>The door hissed open and B’Elanna saw Neelix flipping over some kind of
medical device and struggling with the Doctor. Behind them, Seven was arching
her back off of the biobed and screaming. B’Elanna jumped over the device and
went to Seven, taking her hand.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven gasped. "Stop him."</P>
<P>B’Elanna went into warrior mode and spun to face the two men. "Neelix! Let
the Doctor help her," she yelled.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said, her voice hoarse. "He wants to kill our baby."</P>
<P>"I am trying to save Seven’s life," the Doctor said as he got the upper hand
and tossed Neelix aside.</P>
<P>Neelix stumbled to his feet and slapped his comm badge. "Neelix to the
captain, I need you in sickbay now. Please, emergency transport." The Talaxian
was panting, exhausted by his struggle with the hologram. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna," the Doctor said disarmingly. "If I don’t take action right now,
Seven and the fetus are both going to die. If I act now, I can at least save
Seven."</P>
<P>Seven had B’Elanna’s hand in a death grip. "He wants to abort our daughter.
Do not let him…Promise me, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"What’s happening?" B’Elanna demanded as she looked down at Seven, noticing
her extended belly. </P>
<P>"Promise," Seven begged.</P>
<P>"I promise," B’Elanna said. She didn’t know what was going on, but she knew
that if she had been carrying the child, she would die before terminating the
baby. Her heart ached at what the promise might cost her. She could lose them
both. "Why aren’t you helping her?" B’Elanna demanded.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, you don’t understand." The Doctor moved to the biobed, scanning
Seven. </P>
<P>"Don’t trust him," Neelix said as he moved over to the biobed. </P>
<P>The Doctor let out a disgusted sigh. He would never injure Neelix, but his
enhanced holographic strength gave him a great advantage in any physical
confrontation, still, as a Doctor, he had little or no training in the art of
combat. </P>
<P>Neelix had used his scrappy size to keep the stronger Doctor at bay until
B’Elanna arrived.</P>
<P>All heads turned toward the sounds of a materialization. Captain Janeway
appeared with Tuvok at her side, armed with a compression riffle.</P>
<P>"Explain," Janeway ordered as she studied the stand off in front of her.</P>
<P>"Finally," the Doctor said. "Captain, get Neelix and Lieutenant Torres out of
my sickbay. Their delays may cost Seven her life."</P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna snarled. "This photonic psycho has flipped out yet again.
He is trying to force Seven to have an abortion against her wishes. It’s just
like when he used that Cardie hologram when I told him not to."</P>
<P>"The fetus has returned to the metabolic rate of Jusari Prime. If I don’t
abort it, Seven will die and so will the fetus," the Doctor summarized.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to the bridge, all clear." Tuvok lowered his weapon. </P><I>
<P>*"Understood,"*</I> Chakotay said over the comm. </P>
<P>Janeway moved to Seven and B’Elanna. "Do you want this?" she asked Seven.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she shook her head to emphasize her response.</P>
<P>Janeway spun and glared at the hologram. "Find another answer, Doctor."</P>
<P>"Captain," he whined. "I don’t even know what’s causing it. If it continues
at this rate, she could die in two to three hours."</P>
<P>"Three hours? Then why the Hell were you rushing to kill our child?" B’Elanna
bellowed.</P>
<P>"In case you hadn’t noticed, your wife is in agony," the Doctor snapped.
"With the metabolic rates out of sync, I can’t even give her anything for the
pain. Do you want her to suffer?" </P>
<P>"When did this start?" Janeway asked. "Could it be related to the
gravitational increase? Time and space are closely linked."</P>
<P>"It started well after we entered the increased gravity field," the Doctor
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Yeah, but the effects wouldn’t have been severe enough to notice for a few
hours," B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>"We can’t be sure," the Doctor said.</P>
<P>Tuvok stepped forward. "The increased gravity may have mirrored the
conditions causing the temporal differential on Jusari Prime. If the Borg
nanoprobes interpreted that as a return to the planet, they would try to
adjust."</P>
<P>"And just where did you all get your medical degrees?" the Doctor asked.</P>
<P>"Is it possible?" Janeway demanded. She looked over at Seven, her blonde hair
was matted to her face and she was covered in sweat. She was breathing
irregularly and clutching B’Elanna’s hand.</P>
<P>"Possible, but highly unlikely," the hologram said. "If that were the case,
Seven would be out of sync with the rest of us as well." He crossed his arms
over his chest. </P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she tried to roll onto her side. "My metabolism was
formed in regular space, as were my nanoprobes. I would not be forced out of
phase, in fact my nanoprobes would keep me in sync with the surrounding temporal
conditions."</P>
<P>"Why wouldn’t the baby’s nanoprobes be the same as yours?" the captain
asked.</P>
<P>"The neonatal nanoprobes were created on Jusari Prime, but they adjusted to
the temporal conditions when we left that planet." Seven had to stop to take
deep breaths, and B’Elanna stroked the exdrone’s face offering what comfort she
could. "The neonatal technology is separate from mine. I programmed the baby’s
nanoprobes to supersede my safety to keep our child healthy."</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked. "Why didn’t you tell me that?"</P>
<P>Janeway wasn’t interested in placing blame. They had a working theory and she
wasn’t going to watch Seven die. "Doctor, get Seven ready to travel. We have to
move her to the protected areas in Engineering. We’ve kept the gravity there as
close to normal as possible."</P>
<P>"I’m a Doctor, not a taxi service. I can’t haul my patients around like
luggage," he said indignantly.</P>
<P>"Can you help her here?" Janeway demanded. She looked at the device flipped
onto its side. She didn’t recognize it, then realized that it must be the device
to terminate the pregnancy. "Can you help her here <I>without</I> harming the
baby?" she corrected.</P>
<P>"All right," the Doctor said with a defeated tone.</P>
<P>"I do not want him touching me," Seven said between gasps.</P>
<P>"Seven," Kathryn said quietly. "You don’t have another option right now, but…
you’ll have B’Elanna with you every step of the way… and Tuvok." She nodded to
her Chief of Security. "If the Doctor attempts any procedure that you expressly
forbid, Tuvok will delete his matrix. We will reprogram a new EMH from the cache
files in the main computer."</P>
<P>"Understood, Captain," Tuvok said as he stepped closer to the Doctor.</P>
<P>"You can’t be serious?" The Doctor glared at Janeway.</P>
<P>"I can and I am," Janeway said as she stared him down. "Seven is the one
person on board who fought me to let you be fully sentient, but you seem to
bypass your ethical subroutines on a regular basis. We agreed that you would not
be countermanding any patient’s wishes after you used the Cardassian program to
save B’Elanna. I had my doubts about you after you were so willing to torture
Seven for Captain Ransom. We won’t ever have this conversation again."</P>
<P>"Yes, and if I hadn’t saved B’Elanna, Seven wouldn’t have a wife or a child,
now would she?" the hologram asked.</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna yelled. "Can we get my wife to the secured section of
Engineering and figure this out later?"</P>
<P>"Of course," the Doctor said as he gave the captain a wounded look. "I am
still the Chief Medical Officer, am I not?" he asked.</P>
<P>"For the moment," Janeway said. </P>
<P>The Doctor ignored the comment and began preparing Seven for her journey to
Engineering. The captain backed out of the way and leaned against the wall,
making sure her orders were followed. No one seemed to find it odd, in fact,
Neelix leaned against the wall next to her. His eyes never left the Doctor.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was focused on Seven and the way her face was contorted in pain. She
put her hand on Seven’s belly and winced when her wife flinched. "Did I hurt
you?" she asked as she started to pull her hand away.</P>
<P>"Leave it," Seven said in a rasping whisper. She put her hand over B’Elanna’s
and held it there.</P>
<P>"I’m staying with them, too," Neelix announced.</P>
<P>The captain nodded.</P>
<P>"If this doesn’t work, I won’t be able to do much to help her in
Engineering," the Doctor said as he brought out an anti-gravity stretcher. "I
can take the dermal regenerators, but trying to perform surgery down there isn’t
really an option if she insists on keeping the fetus."</P>
<P>"Neelix," B’Elanna leaned away from Seven and waved the Talaxian over. "I
need something from my quarters, can you get it for me?"</P>
<P>"Of course, B’Elanna." He moved closer and she whispered her request into his
fuzzy ear. He eased back, confused, then nodded. "I’ll be back as quickly as I
can," he said, then turned and hurried out. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>They moved Seven quickly through the ship, her pain increasing as the strain
on her body magnified. While they relocated her, Tuvok went over a data padd
with the gravitational information. He determined that there had already been
five times when the ship had been under the gravitational stresses that would
cause a metabolic spike. Most were for under an hour at a time, short,
unintentional incursions into the wakes of the dark matter whirlpools. The fact
that the earlier spikes were short made them difficult to diagnose, but the fact
that the child’s metabolism returned to normal was a good sign. The Doctor’s
scans revealed that Seven’s pregnancy had advanced over a month in the last two
days. Given the temporal differential on Jusari Prime, that mean Seven had been
exposed to the increased gravity for just over four hours. Each hour with the
metabolic spike in effect advanced the pregnancy an entire week.</P>
<P>They got to Engineering and all eyes were on them. It wasn’t everyday a Borg
drone was being carted around by a Captain, Chief Engineer, Chief of Security,
and the Chief Medical Officer.</P>
<P>"Vorik," B’Elanna yelled as they came into main Engineering. "Take the
engines off line and put the ship onto emergency energy conservation mode. We’ll
have to rely on the impulse engines to supply power for the entire ship."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," the Vulcan said as he began the engine shut down sequence.</P>
<P>"Hang on, love," B’Elanna whispered. She leaned down next to Seven. "We’re
almost there. Just hang on." The anti-gravity table hovered between the four,
although the Doctor seemed as if he were not part of the small group. </P>
<P>He continued scanning Seven, his frown increasing with each new finding.</P>
<P>"Hurry up," B’Elanna yelled. Until they had the warp core shut down, they
couldn’t safely move Seven into the protected area of the engine room. The
Doctor wanted to position Seven as close to the warp core as possible. They had
managed to keep the warp core on line so that the ship had full power. Seven’s
condition changed that, although the ship wasn’t in any immediate danger. They
would be able to restart the engines as soon as they cleared the dark matter
field and moved Seven back to sickbay or her alcove.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Vorik stated calmly. "There is an established shut down
sequence that must be followed."</P>
<P>"I know that," the Klingon said, trying to remember that ripping his head off
wouldn’t help Seven.</P>
<P>Janeway stepped forward. "Vorik, use the emergency shut down sequence, and by
pass the overload section and the start up routine. We haven’t been using the
engines for propulsion, so we can leave that out."</P>
<P>He looked at her skeptically, but it was her ship. "Aye, Captain."</P>
<P>Four minutes later they had Seven in position and waited while the Doctor
scanned her again. He let out a long sigh, a completely unnecessary act since he
didn’t even need to breathe.</P>
<P>"The metabolism is almost normal," he said. "Almost."</P>
<P>"What does that mean?" B’Elanna asked. She still had Seven’s hand in hers,
but the exdrone was getting weaker and was barely keeping her eyes open. </P>
<P>"It means that if she can replenish her energy reserves she may be all right,
but I can’t be sure." The Doctor took out a dermal regenerator and a laser
scalpel and cut Seven’s biosuit in half and then began healing the large bruises
around her belly. The skin had stretched so quickly that even her Borg
nanoprobes couldn’t keep the tissue from being traumatized.</P>
<P>"Oh, Seven," B’Elanna whispered when she saw the damage. No wonder she had
been screaming so loudly. The bruises on the outside were from the internal
tearing of her muscles.</P>
<P>Neelix came into the engine room, his arms full. He was wrestling the fur
comforter from B’Elanna and Seven’s bed along with B’Elanna’s jacket.
"B’Elanna," he whispered as he came closer. "Where would you like these?"</P>
<P>"Give them to me," B’Elanna said as she took them and put them on one of the
nearby consoles. She carefully took off her uniform tunic, plucking off the comm
badge first, and then slid on her leather jacket. She felt the comforting weight
of the leather wrap around her, a physical manifestation of Seven’s love for
her. B’Elanna closed her eyes and fought to keep from crying. Seven had spent
weeks making the jacket, getting it just right, sitting in front of the
fireplace at night stitching. The Klingon settled it against her body, enjoying
the feel, the smell, and the rich chocolate brown color. She sighed and put her
comm badge onto her chest.</P>
<P>"It gorgeous," Kathryn said quietly. She moved over to B’Elanna and ran her
hand over the collar, and then straightened the jacket into place and helped
B’Elanna zip it. "How did you find this on that planet?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna squeezed her eyes shut and her lip trembled. "Seven made it for
me."</P>
<P>Kathryn pulled B’Elanna to her chest and held her. "It’s beautiful. I had no
idea she was so skilled," she whispered into B’Elanna’s ear. "I’m so sorry."</P>
<P>B’Elanna let Kathryn hold her and remembered when she had her first
experience with the Barge of the Dead. She had awakened and clung to Kathryn
like a lost child, and the captain had cradled her, cooed to her until she was
all right. B’Elanna knew if Seven didn’t pull through, she would never be all
right again. </P>
<P>"I’m sorry, Captain." B’Elanna sniffled and pulled back.</P>
<P>"Don’t be. Remember," Kathryn said. "I told you to come to me if you needed
anything."</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said. She turned and took the fur and carried it to
Seven.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" the Doctor demanded. "This isn’t a barn. I mean, it’s
not a sickbay either, but this is too much."</P>
<P>"Shut up," B’Elanna said as she pushed past him and tucked the folded fur
under Seven’s head as a pillow.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes flickered open. "Is the baby all right?" She looked up at
B’Elanna, exhaustion making it difficult to keep her deep blue eyes open. She
inhaled, smiling when the familiar scent of home filled her nostrils. She turned
and rubbed her cheek against the fur. "I love that color on you," Seven said
when she looked back at B’Elanna’s jacket and then her eyes drifted shut.</P>
<P>The Doctor scanned Seven, taking extra time near her belly. "Amazingly, there
is no damage to the fetus…right now. I can’t make any guarantees about the next
few hours. But, I will say that I am amazed by the resiliency of the neonatal
nanoprobes. They have maintained the integrity of the placenta and umbilical
cord, and the fetus has suffered no ill effects."</P>
<P>"How is Seven?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>His eyes darkened. "She hasn’t fared so well."</P>
<P>"What does that mean, Doctor?" Kathryn asked as she rubbed her temples. She
could see the anguish in B’Elanna’s eyes and wanted him to get to the point.</P>
<P>"As it stands, she is approximately eighteen weeks into the gestation, we can
take the fetus safely at twenty four weeks," the hologram explained.</P>
<P>"What do you mean, take?" B’Elanna asked. She was still angry at the
hologram, and didn’t trust him for one second.</P>
<P>"The fetus can be raised in an incubator at twenty four weeks, although the
longer it can be carried, the better." He cleared his throat. "The problem is, I
don’t know if Seven’s body can tolerate the pregnancy for another six weeks. I
don’t know if she can tolerate all she’s been through so far."</P>
<P>"I will carry my child to term," Seven said from the anti-gravity stretcher.
"As soon as we are clear of the gravitational river, I will regenerate. That
will help my body heal."</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor said, "How much longer until we clear the gravitational
river?"</P>
<P>"Maybe…twelve hours," Kathryn said after a few calculations in her head.</P>
<P>His expression was crestfallen, and he slowly shook his head.</P>
<P>"What?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"She doesn’t have that long," the Doctor explained. </P>

<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she turned to the Doctor. "You’re wrong. You said
yourself the baby is fine, and Seven is strong. Her nanoprobes will help her
hold on until she can regenerate."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," the Doctor said as he pulled the Klingon away from Seven. "Maybe,
if she could regenerate in the next hour, but the baby has been depleting
Seven’s reserves and whatever she programmed the neonatal nanoprobes to do, the
bottom line is that her system is failing. All of her energy, nutrients, even
most of the oxygenated blood cells are being routed directly to the baby. I’ve
been injecting her with triox compounds to increase the oxygen supply and with
systemic electrolytes, which are helping too, but it’s not enough."</P>
<P>"Lana." Seven tried to sit up.</P>
<P>"What is it?" B’Elanna rushed back to Seven’s side.</P>
<P>"Take me to my alcove, now," Seven said. She pleaded with B’Elanna, certainty
filling her blue eyes. "The Doctor should be able to keep my body alive for at
least six hours. The metabolic spike will allow our baby to reach 24 weeks. She
will be able to survive. I will hold on that long. I promise."</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said, pulling away. "You are not going to sacrifice yourself.
No. Absolutely not."</P>
<P>"You promised," Seven reminded her.</P>
<P>"No, I promised that we wouldn’t let him abort our child. I never agreed to
let you throw your life away." B’Elanna turned and went to the captain. "There
has to be another way."</P>
<P>Janeway rubbed her chin, deep in thought, then her eyes locked on B’Elanna.
"We can’t take Seven to her alcove, but maybe we can bring her alcove here."</P>
<P>"What do you have in mind?" the Doctor asked. "Can we bring the Borg alcove
in here?"</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said, shaking her head. "But we can hook something up like
Seven used on the planet… something portable."</P>
<P>"Of course," B’Elanna said. "I should have thought of that. Damn it." She
spun, scanning the engine room. "Parsons, get over here."</P>
<P>A tall engineer turned and walked toward B’Elanna. "What is it, ma’am?"
Parsons asked.</P>
<P>"I have a project. It’s top priority. We need to take one of the portable
power converters and set it up so that Seven can regenerate with it. Take
whoever you need, but you’ve only got an hour to finish," B’Elanna said. She was
going through the list of things she needed, calculating that even with a full
team, it would be difficult to set up in an hour.</P>
<P>Parsons moved closer. "I’ll get right on it, but it took us hours to prepare
the portable regenerator we sent with you and Seven on your last mission."</P>
<P>"Get whoever worked on it last time," B’Elanna ordered. "They have the best
chance of finishing on time."</P>
<P>Parsons glanced at Seven. "Is she gonna’ be okay?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said. "She’s going to get through this. Failure isn’t an
option," she told him. "Bring the supplies in here and we’ll get started."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." He turned and jogged across the engine room to the storage
area.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The Doctor continued working on Seven using monitors and instruments from the
portable medical kit. He had given Seven as much triox compound as he safely
could, trying to keep her blood oxygenated enough for her and the baby. It was a
difficult task considering that the neonatal nanoprobes were actively seeking
out any resources Seven managed to manufacture. The accelerated growth had taken
all of the nutrients from Seven and had even began striping her body of its
fatty deposits, a limited resource the lean exdrone couldn’t afford to lose.
Worse still, the neonatal nanoprobes began breaking down Seven’s muscle mass for
energy.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok stood nearby, checking to make sure that the Doctor didn’t try to
resort to his earlier plan. The hologram saw it as a personal affront to his
integrity, arguing that he had already given his word to Seven and the captain
that he would not try to end the pregnancy. Neelix was close by too, at Seven’s
side whenever B’Elanna would step away to help with the construction of the
portable regenerator. The captain went to the bridge to try to get through the
gravitational river faster.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Chakotay turned when the doors to the bridge opened and stood when he saw
Janeway enter. Her face was impassive, but her eyes were troubled. He could tell
whatever Neelix had called her to sickbay for, it had been especially
unpleasant.</P>
<P>"Captain?" he asked as he moved away from her chair and toward his own. </P>
<P>"At ease, Commander," she said as she waved her hand toward her ready room.
"I’m not staying long." She came down to the command level and leaned next to
Tom Paris. "Tom, I need you to go over the course and see if you can shave any
time off of our trip through this gravitational river."</P>
<P>Tom smirked. Not only was Seven fighting with B’Elanna, it seemed she was
also making mistakes. "Think Seven missed something, ma’am?" he asked a bit too
happily.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said sharply. "I think she plotted the safest course that would
avoid any turbulence. I want you to get us through faster even if it’s a bumpy
ride."</P>
<P>"Okay," Paris said slowly.</P>
<P>"Double-check any new heading, make sure it doesn’t put too much stress on
the hull," Janeway said to Chakotay. "I’ll be in my ready room."</P>
<P>Chakotay nodded and raised both eyebrows, silently asking if she needed to
talk. She shook her head, but he took it to mean that she didn’t want to, not
that she didn’t need to. "All right," he finally said.</P>
<P>Tom turned around and smiled as soon as Janeway disappeared behind the ready
room door. He looked up at Harry. "Guess there’s trouble in paradise if the
captain had to go break up the argument. Hope B’Elanna didn’t bust Seven up as
bad as she did me."</P>
<P>"I think you’re off base," Chakotay said dangerously. "Off base…and out of
line."</P>
<P>"Oh, come on, Chakotay… Seven’s in sickbay… and there’s a fight… She and Lana
were already arguing earlier. What else could it be?"</P>
<P>"Stow it, Paris," the commander said. He looked down at his command panel
reading the latest report from the Doctor. Seven was not improving and the baby
was still in danger. He had been monitoring the read outs, and wondered why the
Doctor had enough time to add notes to the database. He hoped his theory was
wrong, that the Doctor couldn’t do anything to help her so he was busying
himself with updates. He decided to find out from the closest source. "Harry,
you have the bridge. I’ll be in the captain’s ready room."</P>
<P>"Aye, sir," Ensign Kim said as he nodded to a crewman behind him to take over
ops. He took the command chair and watched as Chakotay waited for the captain to
answer the ready room door chime.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Come in," Janeway said. She had been monitoring the Doctor’s reports and was
as nervous as a Ferengi at a charity fund-raiser. "Chakotay? You leaving my
bridge unattended?"</P>
<P>"Harry looks good in your chair," he joked as he came to her desk and sat
without waiting for her permission. "How’s Seven? I can’t tell much from the
updates. It’s all pretty clinical." He didn’t add that what he could understand
didn’t sound promising and he was hoping Kathryn would have better news.</P>
<P>"I’m sure it’s worse than it sounds," she said. Kathryn leaned her weight
onto her elbows on her desk and rested her head on her hands. She rubbed her
closed eyes as if she could remove the images of Seven, pale, sweating, and
trembling from the pain, out of her mind.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, is she going to… I mean… she will be okay, right?" He had never
seen her so visibly upset about any member of the crew.</P>
<P>"I don’t know." Kathryn lifted her head and leaned back in her chair. "The
Doctor…he thinks…" Kathryn sighed and then stood, too tense to sit still. "He
thinks her only chance to…survive… is to abort the child."</P>
<P>"That’s going to break her heart," Chakotay said as he climbed to his feet
and went to the captain’s side. "B’Elanna’s too."</P>
<P>Kathryn shook her head. "Seven refused." She turned and looked into his eyes.
After all they had been through together, she did love him, but more like a
brother than as a lover. "That’s why Neelix needed me in sickbay."</P>
<P>"You didn’t try to talk her into it, did you?" he asked. "I mean, I don’t
want to lose her, but you can’t expect her to just…"</P>
<P>"No," Kathryn said. She put her hand on his shoulder silencing him instantly.
"It’s her choice. Neelix needed me to…" she paused, her jaw clinching as she
remembered beaming into sickbay seeing the Doctor ready to forcefully perform
the abortion. "The Doctor didn’t agree with Seven’s decision. He was overriding
her choice when I arrived."</P>
<P>"Did he?" Chakotay’s eyes darkened and he seemed to grow a few inches
taller.</P>
<P>"No, Neelix and B’Elanna were able to hold him off until I got there."
Kathryn almost smiled at her First Officer. She had seen him protective before,
but now he seemed to take on a dangerous aura. For a Borg drone, Seven certainly
inspired fierce protection. Kathryn carefully explained the entire situation to
Chakotay, hoping he might have a different take on the situation. After telling
Chakotay about her threat to delete the Doctor, she got some advice she hadn’t
expected.</P>
<P>"Kathryn," he said gently. "I think you may have overreacted."</P>
<P>"What?" she demanded. "I made it clear when he treated B’Elanna against her
wishes that this wouldn’t be tolerated. He tortured Seven on the <I>Equinox</I>.
Now, he does this. At least with B’Elanna, he was saving her life, but he was
going to kill Seven’s child. We all talk about Seven’s need to regain her
humanity, but it’s the Doctor who needs humanity."</P>
<P>"I know it’s upsetting, Kathryn," he said softy. "But, it’s his humanity, not
his lack of it, that is the problem."</P>
<P>Janeway looked at him, shocked, too confused to even ask him to clarify.</P>
<P>"Kathryn… if he were human… we would never expect him to treat someone he
cared…no, loved." Chakotay rubbed his jaw and sighed. "He is in love with her.
He didn’t make a cold decision to abort her child. He was panicking, seeing
someone he loved about to die in horrible pain, and he needed to act. It’s a
human reaction. And, even knowing that you might deactivate him after the
incident with B’Elanna, he was willing to give up his existence."</P>
<P>"In love with her?" Janeway paused, wondering what she would do to save
Seven. She would give her own life, that much was true, but force Seven to
sacrifice her unborn child? No. Never. "He has a strange way of showing it."</P>
<P>"Seven is learning to accept her emotions, but she has an advantage."
Chakotay took a deep breath. "Kathryn, she <I>is</I> human. Her body is built to
feel. The Doctor is breaking new ground. He wasn’t designed to feel anything; we
learned that when we lost Ensign Jetal. Plus, the Doctor doesn’t have someone
like B’Elanna to help him adjust."</P>
<P>"Maybe," she said. His words made sense, but she wasn’t ready to forgive the
hologram just yet. She would have to see how Seven recovered, if she recovered,
before she could make that decision.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Okay, that’s it," Samantha Wildman said as she connected the last of the
fittings into place. She was kneeling next to the anti-gravity table that was
resting on a stack of crates. Seven was completely still; she hadn’t moved in
the last half an hour as the engineering crew hurried to complete the portable
regeneration unit.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Sam," B’Elanna said. She was standing next to the stretcher
holding Seven’s limp hand. "Doctor?"</P>
<P>"We should hurry," he said as he scanned Seven again. "We’ll need to reduce
the energy output by forty percent. Her body can’t handle any more. With the
energy this low, she may be able to remain conscious during the
regeneration."</P>
<P>"Do it," B’Elanna said to Ensign Wildman. She leaned down next to her wife
and kissed her temple. "Seven? We’re ready to start your regeneration. Can you
open your eyes, love?"</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes didn’t move, and her breathing was ragged and labored. She had
stopped sweating and her skin was cold and dry.</P>
<P>"Her heart is weakening," the Doctor explained. "When the neonatal nanoprobes
depleted her body’s limited supply of fat cells, they broke down the muscles.
Her heart was badly damaged."</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked again. She heard the Doctor, but didn’t want to
acknowledge his words. It hurt too much. She glanced up when Ensign Wildman
began connecting the regeneration cable to Seven’s back. "Here," B’Elanna
whispered. "Let’s turn her." She rolled her wife toward her, biting her lip when
Seven’s hand flopped limply over the side of the stretcher.</P>
<P>"Okay, she’s hooked up," Samantha said.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes flickered and her hand twitched. "Lana," she said, the word more
like a breath.</P>
<P>"I’m here, love." B’Elanna pulled the hair from Seven’s brow, the dried sweat
caking it against her skin.</P>
<P>"Cold," Seven whispered as she shivered. "So slow," she added.</P>
<P>B’Elanna tugged the fur blanket up and over the regeneration cables. "There,
is that better?"</P>
<P>"Slow…" Seven whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was confused, and she looked up at the Doctor who was studying his
tricorder with a frown. "What is slow?" she finally asked.</P>
<P>"The drum," Seven replied. "So slow."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes shot open wide and she stood up straight and pinned the
Doctor in her gaze. "Is her heart slowing?" she demanded.</P>
<P>"Yes," he said, puzzled. "The regeneration is already helping the fetus, and
helping with the damaged abdominal muscles, but…her heart, it’s not healing.
I’ve seen similar damage described in the historical medical records. Victims of
starvation often had heart damage when their bodies actually began feeding on
their own muscle. Seven’s remaining heart tissue is dying, but her nanoprobes
should be reviving them."</P>
<P>"Shouldn’t the nanoprobes repair the dead tissue? Like they did for me when
Seven saved me?" Neelix stepped forward. He remembered the miracle the
nanoprobes had done when he had…died. </P>
<P>"They should be," the Doctor said with shake of his head. "But they’re
not."</P>
<P>"Sam, help me," B’Elanna ordered. She eased back the fur. "Roll her onto her
side. I’m getting up here with her." Ensign Wildman immediately reached out to
help her.</P>
<P>"Just a minute," the Doctor said in a huff. "This is completely out of the
question."</P>
<P>"If I don’t get her heart rate up, she’ll die," B’Elanna said as she tossed
off her jacket.</P>
<P>"And how do you plan on doing that?" the Doctor demanded. "I can’t give her
any medication, just what can you do? Will her to get well?"</P>
<P>"She’ll hear my heart and match the rhythm." B’Elanna slid under the fur and
eased Seven toward her. "Sam, get her head onto my chest… easy. Careful of her
belly."</P>
<P>"This is insane," the Doctor said as he shook his head. "I had no idea you
were such a romantic, Lieutenant. But as romantic as that seems to you, and
contrary to Klingon belief… you can’t share a heartbeat with someone else… no
matter what your myth says about the great Kahless," he added. He was familiar
with the Klingon history, and the misguided belief that Kahless and his bride
shared the same heartbeat once they were married.</P>
<P>"Actually, Doctor, I believe that you are the one who is mistaken," Tuvok
said calmly. He moved over and easily lifted Seven and positioned her face over
B’Elanna’s heart. "Vulcans in deep meditative states can alter their coronary
rhythm to match their <I>Sim’re</I> <I>katra</I>… their vision master. It is
possible that someone as mentally structured as Seven could alter her heart to a
beat she hears. It is <I>ni’var</I>, the sacred duality of things. A unity of
two becoming one."</P>
<P>"Poppycock," the Doctor declared. "Seven is not Vulcan, she is injured, and
she needs medicine, not myth." The hologram rolled his eyes. "Vulcan romantic
fairytales."</P>
<P>"She’s done it before," B’Elanna said quietly, trying to calm her own heart.
"On the planet, during a vision quest. She would have died if she hadn’t used my
heartbeat to come back."</P>
<P>"Fascinating," Tuvok said as one eyebrow shot up on his forehead.</P>
<P>"Yes, <I>fascinating</I>," the Doctor said mockingly. "It’s all just
fascinating. Too bad we can’t…" he paused as he scanned Seven. "Her heart rate
is stabilizing."</P>
<P>"Indeed," Tuvok said. His expression would have been smug, if Vulcans were
prone to emotion. "It would seem in the absence of medicine, she chose myth.
Perhaps she believes in Vulcan fairytales." </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>For the next six hours, B’Elanna held Seven to her chest, and with each
minute that passed, she thanked Kahless. Every minute was more than the Doctor
had expected, and every moment meant the regeneration had more time to help
Seven’s body regain its strength. </P>
<P>The hologram continued his scans, amazed that Seven was alive, let alone
seemed to be making progress. As Seven’s heart began to mend, he felt as if his
matrix were stabilizing for the first time all day. Ever since Seven had been
carried into sickbay, he had felt like his matrix was about to begin a cascade
breakdown, he could barely access the necessary data, and he felt driven to do
whatever was necessary to keep Seven alive. He also felt like ignoring any
nonscientific measures, which made no sense. He would run a complete diagnostic
as soon as Seven was safe. For now, he muddled through, going back to the
familiar, scanning her and injecting her with triox compound; it was the only
thing he had found that would cross the metabolic barrier between Seven and the
baby. Even with the temporal differential reduced to a minuscule variant, the
other medications were rendered inactive or altered to a toxic level. He
theorized that it was because triox was only an altered oxygen molecule and it
wasn’t seen as a foreign element to Seven or the child. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the child’s neonatal nanoprobes were still superseding Seven’s
needs in favor of the fetus’. Even with the added energy from the regeneration,
Seven’s systems were still stressed to the very limit of survival.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"I’m telling you, Harry, B’Elanna and Seven are history." Tom Paris had
turned his pilot’s chair around and was chatting with his friend.</P>
<P>"Tom, they were just having an argument." Harry checked the ship’s course and
then looked up from the command console. "And I don’t think Seven is in sickbay
because of a disagreement with B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Yeah?" Tom asked as he crossed his arms over his chest. "Well… remember when
Lana and I had our disagreement? Half the crew ended up in sickbay."</P>
<P>"No," Harry said, shaking his head. "Seven would never cheat on B’Elanna. No
way."</P>
<P>"I didn’t cheat on her," Tom yelled. "It was a hologram."</P>
<P>"Whatever, Tom." Harry raised his hands to signal that he wasn’t starting a
fight with the helmsman. "All I’m saying is that Seven doesn’t look at anyone
else, real or hologram… and she would never touch anyone else. B’Elanna is the
only one she wants or needs."</P>
<P>"Give her time." Tom turned back toward his helm controls.</P>
<P>"If she has time," Harry said quietly. He had been reading the command
reports from the Doctor. He didn’t like the way the Doctor described her
condition as <I>gravely critical</I>. Harry hadn’t heard adjective ever paired
with the term ‘critical,’ and he decided that the imaginative Doctor must have
decided merely using critical wasn’t sufficient.</P>
<P>"What’s that mean?" Tom turned back around and gave Harry his full
attention.</P>
<P>"Nothing…" Harry stalled.</P>
<P>"What? What is it?" Paris demanded. "Are you getting something on the command
console? Is Lana okay?"</P>
<P>Harry rolled his eyes. "B’Elanna is fine. Seven is… well, I don’t know how
she is. I’ve never heard about half of this stuff, but whatever it is…it isn’t
good."</P>
<P>"Like what?" As medical assistant, Paris had been somewhat surprised he
hadn’t been called to assist, but decided if either of the women had been in
danger, he would have been called to help.</P>
<P>"Tom, what is cardiac necrosis? And… what does it mean if a procedure has a
high probability of two hundred percent mortality?" Harry asked. He knew he
shouldn’t announce the reports from the command console, but what little
understanding he had of medical terminology told him that Seven was in serious
trouble.</P>
<P>Tom’s face lost all color and his eyes narrowed. "Harry, that isn’t
funny."</P>
<P>"I’m not kidding, Tom. What does it mean?" Harry watched as his arrogant
friend seemed to sink into his chair.</P>
<P>"Two hundred percent mortality is a term used only during a pregnancy. It
refers to something that can kill the mother and child." Tom tried to swallow,
but his mouth had gone dry. "Cardiac necrosis is when the tissue of the heart
dies…it’s irreversible."</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" Harry asked, his voice squeaking as his own throat
constricted.</P>
<P>"Harry, I may goof off and forget little things, but these are terms that
scared me when I learned them. You don’t just forget them." He rubbed his face,
hoping that his own antics hadn’t caused any of Seven’s problems. He wanted her
upset, hell… he wanted her to explode and confront B’Elanna, but he never wanted
her or her baby hurt. </P>
<P>Chakotay came onto the bridge, he took one look at Harry’s guilty expression
and Tom’s look of complete shock, and glared at both men.</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim, the command reports are not for general crew distribution."
Chakotay tried to give him a Janeway glare, but his brown eyes didn’t have the
smoldering, dangerous quality the captain’s did. Still, it was enough to make
Harry sit up straight and almost swallow his own tongue.</P>
<P>"Sir?" Ensign Kim asked.</P>
<P>"Give it up, Harry," Chakotay said as he nodded toward the command chair.
"You got caught. Just be glad it was me, and not the captain."</P>
<P>"Yes, sir," Harry said as he stood and gave his seat to Chakotay.</P>
<P>"Sir?" Paris asked. "Should I be helping the Doc?"</P>
<P>Chakotay sat and took a deep breath, then slowly released it. "It won’t
matter, Mister Paris, but thanks for offering. They’re doing everything they
can. I just hope it’s enough." </P>

<P>Seven groaned and her fully human hand move up to caressed B’Elanna’s neck.
It took every ounce of concentration to force her muscles to do her bidding but
she needed to feel B’Elanna’s skin, to feel the warmth of her body and the
strength of the blood pulsing through her veins. Seven’s fingers were cold, but
B’Elanna turned her face toward them anyway, needing the connection even in
slumber. The Klingon was sleeping fitfully, having spent the last nine hours
laying next to Seven, holding her and listening to every whimper or groan the
exBorg made. Seven’s fingertips lingered on B’Elanna’s pulse point, the thrum of
blood surging through her body tapping gently under her cool touch.</P>
<P>Neelix was sitting with his back propped against a nearby bulkhead. He caught
Seven’s movement out of the corner of his golden eyes and stood up immediately.
He paused long enough to twist his back, releasing a crackling cascade as he
groaned in protest of the hours sitting on the hard deck plating.</P>
<P>"Seven?" he whispered as he made his way to her side. "Seven? Are you awake?"
He rested his hand on her shoulder and studied her face looking for any sign
that she was conscious.</P>
<P>"Umm…" B’Elanna blinked her eyes and then opened them completely as she
looked over at Neelix. His furry yellow hair was sticking up on one side and
pressed to his face on the other. "Neelix?" she whispered. "What are you doing?"
She started to ease herself out from under Seven and then felt the exdrone’s
grip intensify as Seven refused to let her go.</P>
<P>"She moved," Neelix said as he stroked Seven’s shoulder. It was an
unconscious act on the Talaxian’s part, as if he were trying to draw her out of
her dangerous sleep.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna noticed the hand resting on her neck and the way Seven’s
breathing wasn’t as labored as it had been. She looked over at Neelix. "Find the
Doctor."</P>
<P>"Of course," Neelix said as he rushed off to get the Doctor from the next
room. Tuvok had taken him into B’Elanna’s office for a discussion almost an hour
earlier.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna put her hand on Seven’s cheek. </P>
<P>"Hmm," Seven moaned and burrowed her face into B’Elanna’s chest. Her lips
parted and she sighed, then she let her hand drift down to caress the Klingon’s
breast. "Lana," she whispered. Her voice sounded like she was chewing gravel,
deep and raspy, and her mouth would need a great deal of moisture to even be
called dry.</P>
<P>"Oh, darling." B’Elanna shifted her weight and lowered Seven onto the
stretcher and kissed her face, dozens of tiny kisses filled with affection, but
placed gently on her skin so that she wouldn’t injure her recovering wife. "You
scared me." Tears joined B’Elanna’s lips on Seven’s pale skin. "You scared me so
much," B’Elanna said as her kisses slowed, her lips pressed a bit more firmly,
lingering as she used the opportunity to test the temperature of Seven’s face.
She was beginning to warm up.</P>
<P>"It hurts," Seven whispered, not quite awake yet.</P>
<P>"Where?" B’Elanna eased back and her hand moved down to Seven’s belly. </P>
<P>"There," Seven said. She inhaled sharply as B’Elanna’s hand touched her
aching abdominal muscles. </P>
<P>"Doctor?" B’Elanna half-yelled as she turned to look for the hologram. She
turned back to Seven and her sable eyes studied the deep blue eyes looking up at
her. "What can I do?" B’Elanna asked. Her brave Klingon composure was
crumbling.</P>
<P>"Hold me," Seven responded and tugged B’Elanna back down to her. She didn’t
have to ask twice. B’Elanna molded to her body, careful to keep her weight off
of Seven and instead settled along her side.</P>
<P>They embraced, and for the first time since the ordeal began B’Elanna felt
like she could let her heart consider what the next day would bring. She had
been focusing on the next minute, and avoiding what dawn would bring, because up
until Seven opened her eyes again, B’Elanna was terrified that she would wake up
without a wife, a child, or a life. She took a deep breath and let the tears
come. She knew that she wouldn’t have faced the day alone; she wouldn’t have
faced anything alone. She was ashamed that she had already taken steps to assure
that she wouldn’t have had to face waking up alone ever again. </P>
<P>"You’re awake," the Doctor pointed out needlessly. "Come on, now, Lieutenant,
up, up up. I need to scan her." He was in better spirits, relieved that he had
been mistaken about Seven’s chances. </P>
<P>B’Elanna slid off of the stretcher but held Seven’s hand, refusing to lose
contact for even a second. The engineering crew that was around didn’t give it a
second look, having gotten used to seeing the tough Klingon offer her soul to
the beautiful exBorg.</P>
<P>"Well," the Doctor said with a smile. "It’s about time those nanoprobes
kicked in." He looked down at Seven, his eyes actually showing his fatigue. It
was emotional exhaustion because his physical stamina was endless. "I take it
your little nanoprobe vacation is over?"</P>
<P>"Emergency Medical Hologram," Seven said coldly, her eyes looking more Borg
than human. "I am recovering…as is my child…no thanks to you."</P>
<P>"I…ahh, Seven?" He seemed lost, staring at his patient without any idea how
to proceed.</P>
<P>"How is she?" B’Elanna asked. She felt Seven’s grip intensify so she rubbed
her thumb over the back of the exdrone’s hand to calm her. Seven’s eyes never
left the Doctor, never softened, and if anything, her glare became more
intense.</P>
<P>"The fetus is doing well," the Doctor said as he focused on the familiar role
of physician. "The nanoprobes have repaired the cardiac necrosis." He looked at
Seven and flinched when he saw the anger radiating from her face. He quickly
averted his eyes and looked at B’Elanna. "It’s a miracle… one that I can’t claim
any credit for. If you…and the captain hadn’t thought of moving her in
here…"</P>
<P>"Our child," Seven said. She had regained her voice, but it was hard and cold
and trembling with emotion. "You will refer to her as <I>our child</I>…not
‘<I>the fetus</I>.’ You dismissed <I>our child</I> as expendable. I will not
forget that…ever." </P>
<P>"Seven, please, try to understand," the Doctor asked as he closed his
tricorder. "You can’t believe I wanted to hurt the… your child. I just didn’t
want you to die."</P>
<P>"Leave," Seven said. She turned to B’Elanna. "Make him leave, or I will."</P>
<P>"Doctor, will Seven be okay without you for a while?" B’Elanna asked as she
moved around the makeshift bed. </P>
<P>"Well, yes," he answered. "I just need to give her another dose of the triox
compound, and then she should be fine for now. I need to repair the damaged
muscles in her abdomen, but I can’t do that here. It will have to wait until we
can take her sickbay."</P>
<P>"Then leave," B’Elanna said. Her eyes were not as intense as Seven’s, but the
resentment just beneath the surface was obvious. "I’ll call you if there’s any
change."</P>
<P>"I was trying to save her," the Doctor whined. "Doesn’t anyone see that?"</P>
<P>"Doctor, perhaps this is for the best," Tuvok said calmly. "It would be an
excellent opportunity to investigate the matter we discussed."</P>
<P>The hologram glared at Tuvok. "Fine, but I want someone to monitor the
medical tricorder at all times. Call me if there is any change."</P>
<P>"I’ll see to it," Neelix said as he reached out for the tricorder. He was
still uncomfortable with the hologram even after the Doctor had healed the
bruises from the scuffle in sickbay.</P>
<P>"Please don’t let your anger with me keep you from letting me help Seven."
The Doctor gave Neelix the equipment and pointed out what he should look for.
Neelix had some medical training and he nodded in understanding.</P>
<P>The captain chose that moment to enter Engineering. She stared at the Doctor
as he left for sickbay and then went to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna said with a half smile.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, may I help you?" Seven turned to Kathryn and smiled
weakly.</P>
<P>"I think you should just stay right where you are," Kathryn said with a wry
grin. "Glad to see you’re feeling better. You gave us all quite a scare," she
said as she moved over to the stretcher and looked down at the blonde. "I am
ordering you to get healthy and stay that way. Is that understood?" Kathryn gave
Seven a stern glare tempered with genuine affection.</P>
<P>"Aye, Captain," Seven said, then smirked.</P>
<P>"That’s one order I will personally make sure she keeps," B’Elanna chimed in.
She went to the other side of the stretcher and took Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"Here, here," Neelix said. </P><I>
<P>*"Bridge to Janeway,"*</I> Chakotay said over the comm badge.</P>
<P>"Go ahead," Janeway said as she straightened to her full height.</P><I>
<P>*"We’re clearing the gravitational river as expected…"*</P></I>
<P>"And?" the captain asked. She had just left the bridge, and knew he wouldn’t
be calling to tell her what she already knew.</P><I>
<P>*"There’s a ship on long range scanners. I thought you might want to be here
for first contact. We don’t recognize the configuration, but it’s a good sized
freighter with phasers and a few antimatter charges."*</I> Chakotay’s voice was
calm, but had a hint of concern lacing through his rich tones. <I>*"How’s
Seven?"*</P></I>
<P>"Mother and child are doing well." Janeway smiled down at the blonde who was
still much paler than usual. "I’m on my way." She shook her head and rolled her
eyes. "Just couldn’t manage without me, could you, Commander?" </P><I>
<P>*"I know you hate it when I have all the fun,"*</I> he said. Kathryn could
hear the smile in his voice. *<I>"Tell Seven and B’Elanna congratulations.
Chakotay out."*</P></I>
<P>Janeway quirked her brow and frowned. "I’m the captain. I’m supposed to close
the channel." </P>
<P>B’Elanna cleared her throat and wouldn’t look at the captain.</P>
<P>"Well, I’ll leave you two alone. I trust Mister Neelix will be an ample
chaperone?" Kathryn’s eyes sparkled for the first time since the day had
begun.</P>
<P>Seven raised her eyebrow in response. "I am sure we would tax Neelix’s
ability to chaperone us, but we also have Lieutenant Tuvok… and I am not at my
best. I believe Engineering is safe."</P>
<P>"Glad to hear it," Janeway said as she turned and left.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway sat in her command chair and watched the main viewscreen as
they approached the damaged ship. It was twice the size of <I>Voyager’s</I>
largest shuttle, but it was bulky and cumbersome, obviously designed for
carrying cargo and not for speed. The ship was drifting, with severe damage to
its main nacelle, and judging from that damage, it had come through the
gravitational river with much more difficulty than <I>Voyager</I> had.</P>
<P>"Open hailing frequencies, Mister Kim," Janeway said quietly. "Looks like
they’ve had a rough go of it. Let’s see if we can offer some assistance."</P>
<P>"Open," Kim responded.</P>
<P>"Alien vessel, this is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship
<I>Voyager</I>, can we be of assistance?"</P>
<P>"They’re responding," Harry said after a brief delay. "Audio only."</P>
<P>"Let’s hear it," Janeway ordered.</P><I>
<P>*"Starship Voyager, this is the freighter Galnor. Any assistance would be
greatly appreciated."*</I> His voice was deep and sounded extremely stressed.
Static broke up the signal momentarily. <I>*"Voyager… our engines are
overloading. If you can grab us with a tractor beam, we can shut them
down."*</P></I>
<P>The captain looked over to Ensign Kim and raised her eyebrows in silent
question. She didn’t like the idea of having her shields down when there was a
well-armed, unknown element just off of her bow.</P>
<P>"Weapons systems seem to still be intact," Harry said.</P>
<P>"<I>Galnor</I>, if you’ll take your weapons off line, we’ll bring you in with
a tractor beam," Janeway said cautiously.</P>
<P>The static intensified and then the viewscreen flickered as the image came in
from the freighter. The small bridge was in disarray and a woman was in the
background pounding a console with what appeared to be a shovel. The small woman
turned and yelled off screen. "Tach, you fool, they think we’re a couple of
pirates. Shut down the phaser banks, you big goat."</P>
<P>The big goat in question walked into the screen and sat at the Conn.
"Shutting down phaser banks," he said as he turned to look into the screen. His
dark features were flushed and sweat beaded on his thick browridge.
"<I>Voyager</I>, do you have a pair of crewmembers by the name of B’Elanna and
Seven?" he asked hopefully. "Have you rescued them from Jusari Prime?"</P>
<P>Janeway stiffened. The last mention of Jusari Prime ended up with her in a
firefight on her own ship. "Can I ask why you want to know?" the captain
responded.</P>
<P>The small woman on the freighter laughed and tossed her makeshift hammer
aside and stalked over to the man. "I can’t let you do anything, can I?" she
asked playfully. "Captain Janeway, I am Nara, and this… brilliant
conversationalist is Tach, my husband."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled, remembering B’Elanna’s descriptions of the couple. Tach was
even more whipped than B’Elanna had claimed. "Nice to meet you," Janeway said.
"I’ve got two crewmembers who will be very happy to see you."</P>
<P>Nara smiled. "You tell Seven that I haven’t been able to get Ty down for a
nap since we last saw her, and tell B’Elanna that Tach’s been moping around like
his best calf died since we left." </P>
<P>Tach glared at his wife and his heavy brow blushed.</P>
<P>"Any chance we can talk to them?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"Actually, if you’d like, we can beam you over. I will need to have a
security team escort you until we verify who you are," Janeway explained.</P>
<P>"That must be the ‘fiery redhead’ we heard about," Tach whispered. The comm
system picked up his words and let the entire bridge hear the comment.</P>
<P>Kathryn felt her cheeks burn as she blushed bright red. Chakotay leaned over
and smiled at her. "I think that proves they know who <I>you</I> are," he
said.</P>
<P>"Keep it up, Commander… Tuvok would look quite nice in red," she told him as
she eyed his tunic and the rank insignia on his collar. She turned back to the
screen. "Nara, Tach, we would be honored to welcome you on board, and your
son…umm, Ty?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Ty," Nara said. "Thank the great goddess he’s asleep. One mention of
Seven and he looks around for her and just cries."</P>
<P>"How are our friends, Captain?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"I’ll talk to you when you come on board," Janeway said. She hoped Seven was
up to visitors. The two animated aliens on the screen seemed like they could
offer Seven sincere support and love.</P>
<P>"Great," Nara said. "We’ll shut down all the systems on board and wait for
beam over."</P>
<P>"Good enough," Janeway.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Well?" B’Elanna stood next to Seven, looking over Neelix’s shoulder as he
scanned her. </P>
<P>"Everything looks normal," the Talaxian said with a smile. "We must be far
enough from the Gravity River that it’s not effecting her anymore."</P>
<P>The doors to Engineering opened and the Doctor hesitated in the entrance.</P>
<P>"I want to go home," Seven said wearily. She rested her forearm over her eyes
and sighed. She was tired of being on display in main Engineering. </P>
<P>"Not so fast," the Doctor said as he came closer. "Now, I know I am the last
person you want to see right now, but…you need to let me repair the damage to
your muscles…please."</P>
<P>Seven lowered her arm and sat up. "Commander Tuvok will be there?" she asked,
looking over at the Vulcan. B’Elanna edged closer, then leaned down and kissed
Seven’s temple and began massaging the blonde’s neck.</P>
<P>"Yes." Tuvok nodded. "I will stay with you until you have recovered." Tuvok
had been worried about Seven, but the displays of emotion were very trying. It
seemed when Seven and B’Elanna were in the same room, they both became most
illogical. It was as if the two were in a constant state of Pon Far. He cringed,
remembering B’Elanna’s brief brush with the Pon Far when Vorik had initiated a
bond with her. She was fierce, aggressive and passionate in her distaste of
Vorik’s actions. He was suddenly glad that Klingon’s couldn’t initiate Pon Far
because if Seven and B’Elanna had the added fire of the Pon Far in their veins,
he was certain that even an ancient Earth firehose wouldn’t slow the pair
down.</P>
<P>"I will comply," Seven said. </P>
<P>"I’ll be with you all the way." B’Elanna pulled back and trotted to a nearby
crate to get her jacket. When she hurried back to the stretcher, she lost her
grip and the jacket almost fell to the floor. The Klingon caught it, but not
before something dropped from the inside pocket and bounced off of the deck
platting with a loud clang.</P>
<P>Seven straightened on the stretcher and her eyes narrowed as she stared at
the dagger she had made for B’Elanna. The Klingon reached out quickly, as soon
as it quit bouncing, and tried to cover it with the jacket. She was too
late.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres," Seven said harshly. "What is that doing here?" Even as she
asked the question the former Borg had a very good idea of the answer.</P>
<P>Neelix stepped forward in full ambassadorial mode. "I brought it to her," he
said. "She wanted to have something near her that you made."</P>
<P>"She has the jacket," Seven responded. Her eyes were locked on B’Elanna who
had the good sense to look guilty.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and moved to the stretcher. "You know what it’s doing
here…and before you blow up, answer me one question."</P>
<P>Seven nodded, too frightened and angry to speak.</P>
<P>"What would you have done? If I had been carrying our daughter and you lost
us both?" B’Elanna rolled the jacket around the knife and set the bundle onto
the edge of the stretcher.</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and bit her lip. She knew how much B’Elanna had been
hurting through the ordeal, but the idea of her taking her own life was a
tangible reminder of what her wife had been through. "The same," Seven
whispered.</P>
<P>"What?" the Doctor demanded. He was livid. "Are you telling me that you would
just kill yourself? Gut yourself right here in Engineering? What kind of great
warrior’s death would that be?" He stalked closer and put his hands on his hips.
"I will not have you wasting your life. I forbid it."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and shook her head. "You just don’t get it, do you, Doctor?
Without Seven and my daughter…I wouldn’t have a life."</P>
<P>"You did just fine before you two got together, and if this suicidal behavior
is a sample of what your union has to offer, well, frankly, I’ve seen enough.
First Seven refuses treatment and almost loses her life, then I find out that
you were going to just ‘fall on your sword.’ You two shouldn’t be allowed in the
same room… let alone to be married."</P>
<P>"Back off, Hologram." B’Elanna lunged at him and tossed in a growl for good
measure.</P>
<P>Tuvok wished he were anywhere else at the moment. "Lieutenant, Doctor… there
are other more pressing matters. We should get Seven to sickbay."</P>
<P>"Yes, of course," the Doctor agreed instantly. He was overwhelmed, he had
resigned himself to the possibility that he might lose Seven and the child, but
it hadn’t occurred to him that B’Elanna would choose death over life without
Seven. He would have been the first doctor in Starfleet history to have a
three-hundred percent mortality rate.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven whispered and pulled her wife closer. "If I ever lose you
and our child… make them hold the barge. I will follow in the next
heartbeat."</P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven’s forehead. "You’re fine, the baby’s
fine, and I’m fine. That Barge isn’t gonna’ be taking any of us for a very long
time."</P>
<P>"Be’nal, I am sorry I hurt you." Seven wrapped her hand around B’Elanna’s
neck holding her in place. </P>
<P>"Shh," B’Elanna murmured as she rested her forehead against Seven’s. "You
didn’t do any such thing. You fought hard and came back to me…again. Now, let’s
get you better so we can go home."</P>

<P>*"Janeway to Torres."* </P></I>
<P>"Yes, Captain?" B’Elanna asked as she sat up. She was sitting in a chair next
to Seven’s biobed in the sickbay. The exdrone had dozed off after the Doctor had
finished repairing the damage to her stomach muscles.</P><I>
<P>*"Lieutenant, I need you in conference room one right away,"*</I> Janeway
said over the comm.</P>
<P>"On my way, ma’am," B’Elanna said as she stood.</P><I>
<P>*"Understood. Janeway out."*</P></I>
<P>Seven sat up and started to swing her legs off of the biobed.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. She reached out and gently gripped Seven’s legs. "You
are staying right here. I’ll take care of whatever the problem is and be back
before you know it."</P>
<P>"I am feeling much better," Seven insisted. "What would it hurt if I
accompanied you?"</P>
<P>"Because…I would be worrying about you, and not the ship. We promised to put
the ship first." B’Elanna stepped back and went to the next biobed where Neelix
was sleeping. Tuvok had left, convinced that the Doctor would follow orders, but
Neelix had insisted on staying with Seven. B’Elanna reached down and shook the
Talaxian by the shoulder.</P>
<P>"What?" Neelix said as he sat up and looked around the room. "Seven? Is she
okay?"</P>
<P>"I am fine, Mister Neelix," Seven said. She liked the Talaxian, and while
many on the ship saw him as somewhat comical, Seven had a new appreciation for
his bravery. "Thank you, for your concern."</P>
<P>"Oh, well…Seven…I was just doing what anyone would have done." Neelix
blushed, his yellowish face shading to a bright orange. Even his spots
darkened.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she straightened her uniform jacket. "You acted with
honor. I owe you more than I can ever say." She saw that he was embarrassed, so
she changed the subject. "I have to go for now. Can you sit with Seven?"</P>
<P>"Of course," he said happily and hopped off of the biobed. His short nap had
invigorated him. "I’ll keep her company until you get back." He patted
B’Elanna’s shoulder. "Don’t you worry, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>"I’m sure she couldn’t be in better hands," B’Elanna said as she headed for
the door.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Neelix choked out. He knew the reserved Klingon didn’t hand out
compliments easily, and more importantly, she didn’t trust the welfare of her
wife and child to just anyone.</P>
<P>The doors hissed shut behind B’Elanna, and Neelix turned to look at Seven.
She raised an eyebrow and nodded.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Mister Neelix." Seven looked down. It was her turn to blush. "You
protected my child when I could not. I will not forget that."</P>
<P>"Seven," Neelix whispered. He stood next to the biobed and studied Seven’s
visibly larger belly and he smiled, imagining the tiny life being nurtured
within her body. "I have seen too many lives cut short to stand by and watch one
taken before it begins." He held out his hand, hesitating as if he was afraid to
touch her, that she might disappear before his eyes. His furry yellow hand
shook. </P>
<P>"I will not forget," Seven repeated. She took his hand in hers and pressed it
to her stomach. He was still shaking, but seemed calmer.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna hurried down the corridor to the conference room. She knew whatever
the problem was, it must be important. Janeway wouldn’t have called her away
from Seven if it hadn’t been an emergency. Both she and Seven were not even off
of their leave yet, and if the gravitational river hadn’t called them away from
their rest, they would both be in their quarters…probably making love. Except
that they had needed to use the gravitational river…and now Seven was in
sickbay. She paused for a brief instant to smooth her tunic and then went into
the room.</P>
<P>Captain Janeway was sitting at the main table looking over a data padd when
the door opened. She looked up and smiled. It wasn’t the reaction B’Elanna
expected during an emergency.</P>
<P>"Captain? What can I do for you?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Well, now," Nara said from her vantage point at the far side of the room.
"Rrrrr," she growled as B’Elanna spun toward the sound of her voice. "If I’d
known you looked this handsome in uniform, I would have given your wife some
competition."</P>
<P>"Nara?" B’Elanna yelled as she ran to the densely muscled woman. "By Kahless,
am I glad to see you." She grabbed Nara and lifted her up in fierce hug, making
the Narian squeak</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat. "I take it she is who she says she is?" Kathryn
was completely unprepared to see such an emotional display from the Klingon.
</P>
<P>"This is Nara. She helped Seven and I on the planet," B’Elanna said once she
finally released her friend. She turned back to Nara. "Where are Tach and
Ty?"</P>
<P>Nara nodded toward the bathroom door that was attached to the conference
room. "Ty wasn’t impressed by replicated…umm, what was that?" she asked the
captain.</P>
<P>"Strained peas," Janeway said with a wry grin. "Can’t say that I blame
him."</P>
<P>The bathroom door opened and Tach came out with Ty on his hip. Tach’s pale
brown shirt had a large green blotch that was edged by a darkened area that was
proof of the large amounts of water he had tried to rinse it out with.</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty squealed. "My Ba! Now!" He wiggled in his father’s arms.</P>
<P>"Ty." B’Elanna went toward Tach, feeling her throat constrict. She didn’t
even try to hold her emotions in check. "My little Tiger! I’ve missed you." She
reached out for the child just as he was escaping his father’s grip. His little
body was a sorely missed weight in her arms. She held him to her chest, inhaling
the scent of his hair. She felt tears on her cheeks as she kissed his jet-black
hair.</P>
<P>"My Ba back. Good Ba," he said as he enjoyed her hug. "Ba stay," he pleaded,
then arched his back and looked around the room. He squirmed in her arms as he
scanned the room. His eyes stopped on Janeway, who was in shock, a half smile on
her face as she watched her Klingon chief engineer who was completely at home
with the dark haired boy on her hip. </P>
<P>"Oh sweetie, I’m here now," B’Elanna said as she kissed his cheeks over and
over again.</P>
<P>He arched away and looked at her. His eyebrows crinkled together on his thick
ridgebrow. "Where Evan?" he demanded. His lip pulled down in a pout he had
learned from the former Borg. "Go to my Evan, now?" His eyes held the internal
hope that seemed reserved for childhood.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and squeezed him to her. "Your Seven missed you, Tiger." She
turned and looked at Tach who was waiting patiently to be noticed. "Hey," she
said with a smile. "Get over here, you old goat." She held out one arm and gave
him a half hug around his son who was not letting go anytime soon.</P>
<P>Tach smiled, letting his dear friend take her fill of the contact, knowing
she had not seen him in months, not just the week he had been away from her.
When she moved away, she smiled warmly at him.</P>
<P>"My little one missed you," Tach said. He nodded at the tyke who had his tiny
fists buried in B’Elanna’s hair to make sure that she didn’t escape.</P>
<P>"Go to Evan, now?" Ty asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s smile faded and Tach took her by the arm. He sensed something was
wrong, but the captain hadn’t told him anything about Seven or B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Nara moved over and tried to take Ty. "What is it?" </P>
<P>Ty squirmed and gripped his legs around B’Elanna’s chest. "No," he told his
mother. "Stay with my Ba. Go find my Evan."</P>
<P>"Hey, little guy," B’Elanna whispered. "Seven isn’t feeling very good right
now…but I think you are just the medicine she needs." </P>
<P>Ty crinkled his nose and lips at the mention of medicine. He knew that word
from his bout with a nasty bug on Jusari Prime. He had been forced to sip bitter
herbs every morning for over three weeks, and he hadn’t forgotten it.</P>
<P>"What happen?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"It’s a long story," B’Elanna said as she moved to the table and leaned
against it. She rubbed Ty’s back as she spoke. "Let me tell you about it."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Janeway said, "I’ll leave you and your friends to catch up." She
turned to Nara, who seemed to be in charge. "If you’d like, we can get you
quarters on board while we help repair your ship."</P>
<P>"That would be extremely generous," Nara said.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Tach said.</P>
<P>"Believe me," Janeway said. "After everything you helped Seven and B’Elanna
with, it’s nothing." Kathryn smiled at Ty who was resting his head on B’Elanna’s
shoulder and was playing with her comm badge. The child was completely content
and looked like he wouldn’t leave her arms without a major battle. One glance at
Nara and Kathryn realized that the child probably came by his stubbornness
genetically.</P>
<P>Nara nodded. "I thank you for your kindness. We consider Seven and Lana to be
gifts from the great goddess. We would welcome the chance to be with them."</P>
<P>"Evan?" Ty whipped his head around, then looked at B’Elanna expectantly. His
tiny lip quivered. "Ba? Where my Evan?"</P>
<P>"Let’s go see your Seven, okay?" B’Elanna offered. She knew that lip quiver
all to well. It generally proceeded a freeflowing torrent of tears.</P>
<P>"Evan!" he squealed happily and began bouncing on B’Elanna’s hip.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"So, you see," Neelix explained to Seven who was trying her best to seem
interested, "the best way to prepare leela root is to let it simmer until the
skin falls off."</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said slowly. "And have you considered using spices other than
the… hot Talaxian peppers? Perhaps…something that does not stimulate the human
tear duct?"</P>
<P>"Well… I… I never realized that the spices were too intense," he said
honestly.</P>
<P>"They are… perhaps too flavorful for many on board," she said delicately.</P>
<P>"No wonder I always have so many leftovers," he mumbled.</P>
<P>The sickbay doors opened and B’Elanna walked halfway into the room. "Up for
visitors?"</P>
<P>"I am always up for you, Be’nal," Seven said with a smile.</P>
<P>Before B’Elanna could comment, someone else announced his presence from
around the corner.</P>
<P>"Evan! Evan! My Evan," Ty yelled as soon as he heard Seven’s voice.</P>
<P>"Ty?" Seven’s eyes widened and seemed to brighten instantly.</P>
<P>"Bring him in," B’Elanna said, shaking her head.</P>
<P>"Here I was worried about you and you’re off taking a nap," Nara said as she
came around the corner trying to keep Ty still. He was climbing up her body and
arching his back, trying to get loose so that he could find his precious
<I>Evan</I>.</P>
<P>"Nara, I have missed you." Seven sat up but Neelix was there to stop her from
standing. She saw Tach come in behind his wife and she sighed. "Tach, my wife
missed you terribly. I was not as efficient a hunter as you were."</P>
<P>He looked at her belly as he and Nara moved over to her. "Looks like you gave
B’Elanna something I never could have. Not without Nara leaving me out as bear
bait," he added with a coy smirk. He cringed before Nara’s hand struck him in
the chest, having known the blow was coming before he finished the off-color
comment.</P>
<P>Nara rolled her eyes and moved next to the biobed so that Ty could see his
<I>Evan</I>. "Are you okay?" Nara whispered as she leaned down to kiss Seven’s
forehead. Neelix backed up out of the way, simply watching the interaction.</P>
<P>"Better now," Seven said honestly.</P>
<P>"Go to Evan. Evan no leave. Evan bad." Ty reached out and grabbed Seven’s
long hair, refusing to let go when his mother tried to stand.</P>
<P>Seven took him from his mother. Nara was cautious, locking eyes with the
exdrone to make sure she was up to holding the wiggling bundle. </P>
<P>"Come here," Seven said as she lifted Ty to her chest. He sighed happily and
settled his weight onto her and played with her hair with one hand as he
yawned.</P>
<P>"He missed you," Nara said quietly. "We missed you…especially at bedtime. He
wouldn’t go to sleep without your singing."</P>
<P>"And my Nara is many things, but a singer is not one of them," Tach
volunteered.</P>
<P>"Believe me, I remember," Seven said. She cringed and continued rubbing Ty’s
back as he dozed off.</P>
<P>"I think I am insulted," Nara said indignantly.</P>
<P>"Feel free to be insulted…just don’t sing." B’Elanna laughed as she moved
next to Seven and began stroking Ty’s back. Her hand brushed against Seven’s,
causing both women to smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After a brief visit, the Doctor materialized and insisted that the visitors
leave. Neelix took Tach and Nara on a tour of the ship while Ty stayed in
sickbay, unwilling to leave Seven’s arms even while he was asleep. His tiny
fists would tighten anytime Seven tried to move him away from her, so she
cradled him, humming contentedly to soothe him.</P>
<P>"I hardly think having a child in sickbay is appropriate," the Doctor said as
he shooed Neelix and Nara out the doors. He turned to see Seven smiling down at
Ty. She kissed his forehead and hugged him to her chest and then her expression
lost all its warmth.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you should terminate him," Seven said coldly. "Except on this
occasion I am capable of stopping you myself." She climbed out of the bed,
steadying herself on B’Elanna’s arm. "Killing children does seem to be your
answer to everything."</P>
<P>"Seven, I didn’t want to harm your child. I didn’t think I had any other
choice." His eyes wrinkled around the edges and sincere regret covered his
face.</P>
<P>"I am going home," Seven stated as she shifted Ty onto her hip. She squeezed
B’Elanna’s arm, and the Klingon nodded her support. Ty blinked and opened his
eyes, sensing that his beloved Evan was upset. He tightened his grip as he
stared at the strange man.</P>
<P>"Please, I know you’re upset with me, Seven," the Doctor pleaded. "But let me
help you."</P>
<P>"Is it safe for her to go back to our quarters?" B’Elanna asked. Her eyes
were cold, letting the hologram know that she hadn’t forgiven him either.</P>
<P>"Well, technically," he admitted. "But I would like to keep her here to
rest."</P>
<P>"What makes you think I could ever rest in your presence again?" Seven
asked.</P>
<P>Ty saw the anger in his beloved Evan’s eyes and turned toward the Doctor.
"Bad man."</P>
<P>"Well, out of the mouths if babes," the Doctor said with a sigh. "Fine, go
home. But… the moment you have any discomfort, I want you back here
immediately."</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow letting him know that she had no intention of
returning to sickbay voluntarily. Her expression softened when Ty’s hand traced
her lips.</P>
<P>"My Evan," he said possessively.</P>
<P>Seven smiled as kissed his tiny fingers.</P>
<P>"Let’s go home," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Home?" Ty asked excitedly. "Go back cabin, now?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna ruffled his dark, straight hair and then caressed his cheek. "No,
Ty. We can’t go back to the cabin."</P>
<P>"Ba stay?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes, Ba stay," B’Elanna promised. "Come on, Be’nal." She guided Seven toward
the door.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Neelix was showing his guests the mess hall, which was mostly deserted. Tuvok
was having a cup of Vulcan tea off to one corner and Tom was having coffee while
watching Harry Kim rummage through the large industrial refrigerator. Tom saw
the newcomers and came over to them. He smiled warmly, curious about them; any
new faces helped lessen the boredom.</P>
<P>"Hello," Tom said with a charming smile. "Who do we have here?"</P>
<P>"Tom, these are friends of B’Elanna and Seven’s. They helped them on the
planet." Neelix smiled and then turned to his charges. "Nara, Tach, this is Tom
Paris, our helmsman."</P>
<P>"Greetings," Nara said. </P>
<P>"You must be skilled to guide this vessel," Tach said.</P>
<P>"Well, I don’t like to brag, but it is challenging." Tom stood to his full
height and pushed out his chest.</P>
<P>The mess hall doors opened and Seven came in with B’Elanna. Ty was wide-eyed,
taking in all the new exotic scenery. Tom’s eyes narrowed and his face lost some
its charm. Nara noticed it immediately, as did Tach. Tach also noticed the
change in Tom’s scent. Ancient Narian males could distinguish mood changes in
other males by the scent of the distinctive hormones put they off, but it was a
skill mostly lost over the years. Strong emotional changes would still effect
Narians. The scent the helmsman was putting off was a mixture aggression and
desire. </P>
<P>"Over here." Nara smiled at her son who was deliriously happy with his two
‘aunts.’ "Seven, I thought you were supposed to be resting."</P>
<P>"I feel much better," Seven said. Her eyes stopped on Tom, who was doing his
best to look innocent. "We returned to our quarters and I changed my
attire."</P>
<P>"You look stunning, Seven," Neelix said. She was wearing dark charcoal slacks
and a lavender blouse. It was loose fitting so that her newly enlarged belly
wasn’t obvious and it was a perfect compliment to her ivory skin tone.</P>
<P>"Have you found them quarters yet?" B’Elanna asked Neelix. She had her arm
wrapped around Seven and let her hand drift hand to the exdrone’s hip as they
stopped in front of Neelix. "This little guy is ready for a nap," she added as
she rubbed Ty’s back. The boy was fighting to stay awake, and despite his
wide-open eyes, he was exhausted. He kept rubbing his eyes and cuddling against
Seven, both signs that he needed his nap.</P>
<P>"It is well past his nap hour." Nara moved to take him.</P>
<P>"Evan," Ty whispered as he clutched her neck. "Evan stay. No go away."</P>
<P>Neelix stepped closer and studied Ty. "Seems like he’s taken quite a shine to
you, Seven. I was going to put them in the VIP quarters on deck three, but if
you’d like, I could see if someone in the crew quarters would let them stay near
you."</P>
<P>"No, thank you," Tach said. He had been quiet, studying the helmsman to
figure out why he wreaked of anger and hostility. "We don’t want to take
anyone’s home. We’ll stay in the…what did you call it?…VIP quarters.</P>
<P>Tom shook his head and rolled his eyes. "Oh, I’ll bet that most of us would
love sleeping in the VIP quarters for a while. It gets pretty crowded in the
lower decks."</P>
<P>"Funny," Seven said as she pinned Tom in her gaze. "I find that I have plenty
of room, in fact, Lana and I sleep so close together that we could manage with a
bed half the size of ours." Seven turned to her wife. "Isn’t that right,
Be’nal?"</P>
<P>"Absolutely." B’Elanna barely stopped herself from laughing.</P>
<P>Tom’s eyes darkened. "Well, I guess that’s fine if you spend all of your time
together sleeping."</P>
<P>Nara burst out laughing, covering her mouth and struggling to breathe through
her nose. Her eyes watered, and after a several more heartfelt fits of laughter
she stood upright and shook her head at Tom.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris, if you think that, then this ship must have the best
soundproofing of any starship I’ve ever seen," Nara said. She giggled and looked
over at B’Elanna. "It’s a wonder we had any game in our valley. You make more
noise than any of those bears."</P>
<P>"Bears?" Ty’s attention fixed on B’Elanna. "Bear got Evan," he reminded her
gravely.</P>
<P>"Yes, it did," B’Elanna said. "Then what happened?" She didn’t see Tom’s neck
turning bright red as anger and jealousy raged.</P>
<P>"Ba killed it," Ty proclaimed proudly.</P>
<P>Neelix’s eyes widened. "Really?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven confirmed. "The beast mauled me and B’Elanna… lost her temper."
She glared at Tom. "It is exceedingly unwise to anger a skilled warrior such as
my wife."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, you fought a bear? That’s incredible," Neelix said. He was smiling
at her with wonder in his eyes. "How did you kill it?"</P>
<P>Ty helped B’Elanna tell the story. "Bear was napping!" He squealed and began
giggling. His eyes sparkled just like Nara’s had when she was giggling.</P>
<P>Tom snorted and looked over at B’Elanna. "Doesn’t sound like a very Klingon
thing to do. In fact, not many warriors nap on the battlefield."</P>
<P>Seven handed Ty to a surprised Nara. She moved to Tom in a few swift steps
and faced him, leaning down until her noise was almost touching his. "Warriors
may not sleep…but Ensigns do."</P>
<P>The small group was suddenly quiet, and Ty decided it was time to explore. He
wiggled and Nara let him down onto the floor. He crawled around seeing what he
could get into.</P>
<P>Seven backed away from Tom who was momentarily speechless.</P>
<P>"Umm, well, yes," Neelix said. "Why don’t I go check on some lunch for the
baby?"</P>
<P>"No peas," Nara and Tach said in unison. Neelix nodded and escaped the tense
group.</P>
<P>Tom regained his misplaced bravery. "So, Seven, are you saying that B’Elanna
would have to defend you from an ensign? Any particular ensign in mind? ‘Cause
I’ll bet there’s at least one ensign she’d like to surprise late at night in his
bed." Tom was too stupid to quit while he was ahead. </P>
<P>"On the contrary," Seven hissed as she quickly moved back into Tom’s face.
"As any of the Dengari can tell you... I am the more dangerous spouse in our
marriage."</P>
<P>"You’ve got that right," Nara added.</P>
<P>Tach was getting agitated, and he edged closer, but before he could act, his
son did.</P>
<P>"Bad Man!" Ty yelled. He grabbed Tom’s leg and buried his teeth into the
fleshy part of his calf. Ty was young, but his instinctual sense of smell told
him that the nasty man wanted to hurt his Evan.</P>
<P>"Ouch! You little monkey!" Tom yelled as he jumped back. "Get that cavebaby
away from me."</P>
<P>"Enough." Seven had her hand around Tom’s neck before the words had finished
leaving his lips. "You will not call him that… You will not insult me, and you
will NOT disparage my wife…ever again." Seven drove Tom back against a nearby
bulkhead, but her grip was not yet cutting off his air supply. "And if you ever
suggest that my wife is interested in you, I will make sure you never speak
again."</P>
<P>The few people in the mess hall had turned to watch the display. No one came
to Tom’s rescue. Even Harry felt that he had it coming to him.</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Tom squeaked. "Can’t you take a joke?" He
thought his ‘boyish charm’ would eventually get him out of his predicament.</P>
<P>Seven lifted him off of the ground, leaving his feet to dangle helplessly.
She ignored the twinge in her belly as she tightened her grip. "We know about
the Vulcan Balm," Seven said slowly. Her eyes were flickering with dangerous
energy and Tom realized that he had poked a very dangerous beast with a stick
one too many times. This beast was about to strike back. He scanned the room
looking for assistance. His eyes stopped on Tuvok, who was next to the door.
</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow, and nodded, then he turned without a word and left
the mess hall.</P>
