<P>Kathryn Janeway left the reception, went to her ready room and tried to bury
herself in her work. Three hours later she had completed all of the personnel
reports that weren’t due for two more weeks and she still couldn’t shake the
image of B’Elanna’s hand resting on Seven’s belly. It was obvious that Seven was
completely in love with B’Elanna and utterly devoted to her. Kathryn wasn’t the
sort to waste her time thinking about what could have been, but she also wasn’t
the sort to turn her feelings off like a light switch. Seven had two and a half
years to fall in love with B’Elanna, but Kathryn didn’t have the luxury of time.
She had sent Seven off on a simple away mission, only to have her return a week
later with everything changed. </P>
<P>"This is ridiculous," Kathryn said to the empty room. She took a drink of her
coffee that had cooled hours earlier. It tasted as bitter as she felt. "Okay,
you should just be happy for them," she told herself. She knew she couldn’t
offer half of what B’Elanna had given Seven. Kathryn was married to her ship,
she couldn’t take a crewmember as a lover, and even if she did, she could never
give that lover her whole heart. And the bottom line was, Seven had been through
so much already, she shouldn’t have to settle for anything less than everything.
</P>
<P>Kathryn leaned back in her chair and rubbed her eyes. She was tired, too
tired to sleep. She thought about the way B’Elanna had looked at Seven, her eyes
full of adoration, not a single ounce of doubt, full of complete trust, and
offering her heart and soul, her whole heart and soul, not the meager leftovers
after the <I>USS Voyager</I> had taken her pound of flesh. </P>
<P>She stood and paced, and remembered growing up on the agricultural park; she
remembered her mother. Gretchen Janeway was a good Starfleet wife, she stayed
home, raised the children, never complained, and she waited. She waited for the
day when her husband would put her first, when Starfleet would get enough of
him. That day never came. Kathryn waited too; she waited for the day that she
would see the sorrow and the loneliness leave her mother’s eyes. That day never
came either. Her mother never came first, and Kathryn realized that she would
never wish that existence on Seven. </P>
<P>"Don’t ever put her second, B’Elanna," Kathryn whispered to the empty
room.</P><I>
<P>*"Larson to Captain Janeway."*</I> the bridge officer’s voice echoed over
Kathryn’s comm badge.</P>
<P>"Janeway, here."</P><I>
<P>*"Ma’am…I wouldn’t normally contact you for this, but since you are in your
ready room…"*</P></I>
<P>"Go ahead, Larson." Janeway smiled, wondering if she had ever been that eager
to please. Of course she had.</P><I>
<P>*"Ma’am, I ran some extra scans of our flight path… and long range scanners
are showing some dark matter. I thought you might want to take a look. Maybe we
can harvest some anti matter."*</P></I>
<P>"Thank you, Larson. That’s a good idea. How far out is it?" Janeway stood and
headed to the door. </P><I>
<P>*"Twelve hours, ma’am."*</P></I>
<P>"Good work," she said. It was always a good idea to recognize extra effort,
even if she couldn’t offer her crew the same promotions they could get in the
Alpha Quadrant. "Dark matter can have a nasty gravity well that extends
thousands of light years... Have the helm plot us a course that keeps us out of
range."</P><I>
<P>*"Yes, ma’am."*</P></I>
<P>Janeway walked onto the bridge, nodding at Larson as she went to her command
chair. She might as well log some time with the gamma shift. They didn’t get to
work with her often.</P>
<P>"Let’s see that dark matter," she said as she scanned the data at her comm
station. She frowned. "Helm, alter course to 242 mark 132. We’re already in the
outer current of the gravity well. Let’s stay clear if we can avoid it."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven was not quite awake, she twisted and tried to roll over onto her side
but something blocked her. She opened her eyes and could tell it was still the
night shift, the lighting was lowered, but there was enough light for her to see
that B’Elanna was not beside her, then she heard mumbling. She smiled and lifted
the covers.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was curled around Seven’s body, her cheek pressed to Seven’s waist
while her hand cradled the soft curve of Seven’s belly. B’Elanna was asleep, but
she was nuzzling Seven’s side and mumbling.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered. "Come back up here, darling." She reached down and
guided B’Elanna back up to her pillow.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and then whimpered a very unKlingon sound and smacked her
lips before she crawled onto Seven’s chest and hummed contentedly. Her hand
drifted up and settled over Seven’s heart, B’Elanna’s second favorite location.
Any time the Klingon’s hand wasn’t on Seven’s belly, it was resting over her
heart.</P>
<P>Seven ran her fingers through B’Elanna’s hair. She liked the longer style,
loved to gather it up and tie it off in a ponytail with a piece of leather
lacing and then swish it when the mood struck her.</P>
<P>She smiled in the darkness, then shifted her weight when she felt a twinge in
her side. She reached down and rubbed the offending muscle, then felt B’Elanna’s
hand meet hers on her stomach. The twinge became a dull pain, and she shifted
trying to stop the cramp.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s leg moved over Seven’s thigh; even in her sleep the Klingon like
to cover Seven with as much of her flesh as possible. Her knee slid higher until
it gently nudged Seven’s bladder.</P>
<P>"Ouch," Seven squirmed and pushed B’Elanna leg away and took in a deep
gasp.</P>
<P>"Mmm. Seven?" B’Elanna’s eyes opened, though she was far from awake. "Ya’
okay?" she asked with a yawn as her eyes closed.</P>
<P>"Cramps," Seven responded and kissed B’Elanna’s head. "Go back to sleep."</P>
<P>"Roll over," B’Elanna said as she shifted her weight off of Seven. "Come on,
I’ll have your back relaxed in no time," she said without opening her eyes.
B’Elanna was used to rubbing Seven’s back in the middle of the night. Seven’s
long body seemed prone to cramps that settled in her lower back.</P>
<P>"Not my back," Seven said even as she rolled onto her side, after all,
B’Elanna’s back rubs were the Omega molecule of touch…pure perfection. "Ouch,"
Seven said once she was on her side.</P>
<P>"Where?"</P>
<P>"My stomach, and sides." Seven rubbed her belly, the skin felt tight, and she
was sure she was getting as big as a class two shuttle craft.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna sat up, fully awake. "Computer, lights." The room
brightened, and both women squinted against the bright light. "Why didn’t you
wake me? Should we call the Doctor?"</P>
<P>"No, it is just a cramp," Seven insisted.</P>
<P>"How do you know?" B’Elanna asked. She ran her fingers over Seven’s stomach
and sides. "Where does it hurt?"</P>
<P>Seven rolled her eyes, an affectation she had only recently picked up. "It is
a cramp. It is almost gone." She slid B’Elanna’s hand to the spot where the
cramp had been.</P>
<P>"You sure?" </P>
<P>"Yes, now go back to sleep." Seven settled back down onto her pillow.</P>
<P>"Wake me up if it happens again, okay?" B’Elanna settled down and spooned
Seven from behind, reaching down and pulling the bearskin blanket up around
them.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," Seven said. "Computer, lights out."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tom Paris sat alone at a small table in the mess hall nursing his cup of
coffee. He was also nursing a severe hangover. He had left the reception the
night before and went to Fairhaven, drowning his sorrows in drink and Becca’s
holographic arms. Both cures left him feeling empty.</P>
<P>"Tom, mind if I join you?" Harry asked his friend. He wouldn’t normally ask,
but Tom had chosen a small table well away from the rest of the crew who were
having breakfast.</P>
<P>"Hey, Harry." He nodded at an empty chair.</P>
<P>Harry settled his meal, carefully arranging his utensils and coffee cup, and
then began seasoning his eggs with enough pepper to make them turn battleship
grey.</P>
<P>"Jesus, Harry, how can you eat those?"</P>
<P>"What? They’re good." Harry shrugged and continued his meal. "You left in a
hurry last night," Harry said quietly.</P>
<P>Tom let out a disgusted snort and rolled his eyes. "Why should I stick around
to see that Borg rub my face in it?"</P>
<P>"Tom, they love each other. Maybe if you had stayed last night you would have
seen that." Harry set his fork down, making sure it was centered on his napkin.
He was nothing if not organized.</P>
<P>"Oh, please," Tom said. He emptied his coffee cup in one gulp. "Lana’s gonna’
come to her senses soon, and when she comes crawling back to me… I’m gonna’ make
her beg."</P>
<P>Harry bit his lip, then took a sip of his coffee. He stared at his meal,
suddenly wishing he had sat somewhere else. "Seven’s pregnant," Harry said as he
put down his cup.</P>
<P>"What?" Tom demanded. "She freaks out ‘cause I slept with a hologram, but she
stays with Seven after she screwed some guy?"</P>
<P>Conversation in the mess hall stopped as Tom’s yelling echoed through the
room.</P>
<P>"It’s B’Elanna’s baby," Harry said quietly.</P>
<P>"Come on, Harry. She may be the all mighty Borg, but she’s not that mighty."
Tom was fuming. He had asked B’Elanna about kids and she had said that they
weren’t even ready to get married, let alone talk about kids. She also said that
Tom wasn’t ready to be a father, and he needed to grow up before they could talk
about it.</P>
<P>"It’s true, Tom." Harry looked over at his friend. He knew Tom was having a
rough time, but suspected it was more about ego than a broken heart. "Don’t push
this, Tom. You have no idea what you’re getting into." His dark eyes narrowed as
compassion covered his dark features.</P>
<P>"No," Tom said as he stood. "That Borg bitch doesn’t know what she’s getting
into."</P>
<P>"Tom," Harry stood and grabbed the helmsman’s arm. "Damn it, Tom. It’s over.
Let B’Elanna be happy."</P>
<P>Harry saw the punch coming, but was too shocked to block it or even flinch.
He dropped to one knee and grabbed his jaw. "That could have went better," he
whispered.</P>
<P>"Stay out of this, Harry. It’s none of your business," Tom said as he stalked
out of the mess hall.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway sat at the head of the conference room table and studied her
officers. Tuvok waited patiently for the captain to explain, the Doctor was
reading over a medical data padd that most likely contained his latest opera,
and Harry wasn’t looking at anyone. That was the good news. </P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven, who were both still officially off duty, looked like two
teenagers at their senior prom. They tried to look professional, but the
frequent stolen glances and smiles were more obvious than if they had just
broken down and held hands or offered to carry each others’ notebooks to study
hall. It didn’t help that neither woman was in uniform, having been called to
the meeting during breakfast in their quarters. B’Elanna was wearing black
slacks and a blue-gray tank top, covered by her ever present leather jacket.
Seven was radiant in a pair of cream slacks and matching silk top and she wore
her thick braid hanging over her left shoulder down to her belly. </P>
<P>The remaining two officers were staring at the couple. Neelix had a goofy
grin as he studied Seven. Tom Paris’ expression was unreadable as he watched
B’Elanna, although Janeway suspected it was at the hostile end of the
spectrum.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway began. "We are entering an area pocked with dark matter.
We need to plot a course through the sector that avoids the gravity wells but
doesn’t add two months to our journey. As it is, going through this sector will
take four months because we won’t be able to go to warp. If we go around the
dark matter zone, it will take us six months at maximum warp." She turned to
B’Elanna. "I’m sorry to cut into your leave, but I could really use your input,
B’Elanna. The gravity wells are going to play havoc with the warp engines, so
I’d like you to enhance the forcefields around the critical systems. We may just
take them off line if we have to since the gravity wells make it impossible to
form a static warp field."</P>
<P>"Of course," the Klingon answered. She was figuring out which schematics she
would have to study for the task at hand. She didn’t like being rusty and had
been pouring over all the ship’s technical manuals.</P>
<P>"Seven," the captain said as she turned toward her, "We need the most
accurate charts possible, and you are the best." Kathryn smiled ruefully.</P>
<P>Seven nodded. "I would find the challenge a pleasant diversion. Too much free
time can be… unsettling."</P>
<P>"Tom," the captain said as she gave him her attention, "You’ll need to be on
top of whatever Seven gives you."</P>
<P>Tom rolled his eyes. "I didn’t think giving was in the Borg vocabulary."</P>
<P>"Ensign?" Janeway demanded. "Is there a problem I should be aware of?"
Kathryn kicked herself for her poorly chosen words.</P>
<P>"No problem, ma’am…just a little joke to lighten the mood," Tom said.</P>
<P>"I suggest you leave moral to Neelix." Janeway’s voice left no doubt that she
was furious. She didn’t like Tom acting like a spoiled child, especially when he
dragged his temper tantrums into her staff meetings.</P>
<P>"Understood," Paris said.</P>
<P>"Doctor, does the increased gravity pose any risk to the crew?" Janeway asked
the hologram.</P>
<P>"None, captain. Fortunately, the human body, being made up of mostly good old
fashioned water, is less fragile than B’Elanna’s engines." The Doctor was smug,
as if he were personally responsible for the human form and its advantages over
the ship’s engines. "With the exception of some space sickness, enduring a few
of the gravity wells will not be a problem."</P>
<P>"Space sickness?" Tuvok asked. "Would it not be prudent to avoid all of the
gravity wells?"</P>
<P>"Now, now, Commander," the Doctor said. He added a tisk tisking sound before
continuing. "I’m sure you’ll manage just fine." </P>
<P>"Indeed?" Tuvok wondered if the Doctor would be as glib if his matrix were as
effected as Tuvok was when he got space sickness.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway said, cutting off the useless debate before it could
begin. "Let’s get to work. Harry, I want a class four probe prepared within the
next week. Use the Borg shielding so we can send it into one of the dark matter
clouds and recover some anti-matter. But let’s get our course safely plotted
first." </P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." Harry smiled. He enjoyed special projects and the challenges
they offered.</P>
<P>The group stood and slowly left the table. Tom came around the table and
quickly left. Seven waited for B’Elanna to catch up with her so that they could
walk out together.</P>
<P>"Will you meet me for lunch?" Seven asked coyly. She felt like she was making
her first date. Illogical considering she knew she had B’Elanna’s heart.</P>
<P>"Think Neelix will have anything as good as that stew you used to make for me
when it rained?" B’Elanna had to consciously remind herself to not hold Seven’s
hand. It was not professional, and they didn’t want to start any bad habits.</P>
<P>"Stew?" Neelix asked as he joined them. "Seven, have you been doing more
cooking? I can always use another helper in the mess hall." He smiled, waiting
to see if he had successfully hooked the exdrone.</P>
<P>"Conditions on the planet were harsh," Seven said gravely. "I do not think
the captain would allow cannibalism on board. Plus it would considerably reduce
the crew manifest."</P>
<P>Neelix’s jaw almost hit the floor. He stopped and gapped at her like he was a
fish yanked out of its tank, his mouth opening and closing.</P>
<P>B’Elanna took Seven’s elbow and herded her out of the room. "You are so bad,
Seven," she whispered as they climbed into the turbolift.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Harry Kim entered the Astrometrics lab and cleared his throat. "Ah, Seven?"
He asked.</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim, how may I assist you?" Seven asked without looking up from her
calculations.</P>
<P>"I was wondering if you could help me modulate the Borg shielding for the
probe."</P>
<P>"That project is to be completed after we finish plotting our course through
the dark matter zone." Seven looked up at Harry, her expression chastising.</P>
<P>"Well, yeah," he stuttered. "But there’s nothing more I can do to plot the
course, so I thought I’d get a jump on it."</P>
<P>Seven let him off the hook. "Your initiative is admirable. However, I am
still busy calculating the most efficient flight plan."</P>
<P>"Well, do you need some help?" he offered.</P>
<P>She paused, torn between her preference for working alone and the prospect of
finishing the task sooner.</P>
<P>"That would be...acceptable," she finally said.</P>
<P>"Great," Harry said enthusiastically. "Where should I start?"</P>
<P>Seven smirked, but didn’t let him see it. "I am tracking what appears to be
an ion trail through the sector. It would seem logical that the other ships
traversing this sector would have had similar concerns as <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"Yeah, that’s logical," Harry said, but he doubted he would’ve thought to
check for old ship courses.</P>
<P>"Access the aft sensor information and use it to create a map that overlays
the various gravity wells and the cumulative effects they have on each other,"
she ordered.</P>
<P>"No problem," Harry said. He retrieved the data and began cross referencing
the material as Seven had suggested. It was a time-consuming process.</P>
<P>"So, are you excited?" Harry asked when the silence became bothersome to
him.</P>
<P>"It is a routine action. Plotting a course could hardly be called exciting."
Seven moved from console to console adjusting the sensors to get the latest
results.</P>
<P>"I meant about the baby," Harry said with a disarming smile.</P>
<P>"Oh…" Seven was stymied. Of course she was excited. Why did people insist on
asking questions with obvious answers? She couldn’t understand why crewmembers
continually asked her if she was happy, or excited, or her least favorite,
"don’t you wish the baby was already here?"</P>
<P>"So," Harry asked again, "Is B’Elanna excited?"</P>
<P>"Yes." Seven smiled, and then consciously chose to let her guard down with
Harry. "She can barely wait. I think she is the epitome of ‘the nervous
father.’"</P>
<P>Harry laughed at the image that painted. "Hey," he said he looked down at his
completed data. "Look it this."</P>
<P>"Intriguing," Seven said she studied the way the overlapping gravity wells
interacted. The conflicting gravity made the surrounding space look like a
Labyrinth, but that was not what caught her eye.</P>
<P>"Ensign, check these areas here… here… and here, then see if the increased
gravity of the overlapping fields is stable."</P>
<P>"Okay," he said slowly. "Why?" he asked even as he checked the data. His eyes
widened. "Yes, it is."</P>
<P>"Is there a consistent direction of movement? Is it in the direction we wish
to travel?" she asked as she leaned over the console with him.</P>
<P>"Yes..." he said. "What are you thinking?"</P>
<P>"That we may have found a way to cut several months off of our journey,"
Seven said.</P>

<P>B’Elanna sat at one end of the conference room’s long table. She, along with
the rest of the senior staff members, were watching Seven explain her latest
findings<I>. "She’s so incredible,"</I> B’Elanna thought as she studied her
wife. "<I>She has no idea how beautiful she is. She moves like a ghost, outside
of our puny human reality, floating gracefully through our existence. Oh hell,
I’m thinking in poetry. What’s next? Sprinkling flowers in her path so she won’t
have to walk on the carpet?" </I>B’Elanna covered her mouth with her hand and
smirked. <I>"I wonder what kind of flowers she likes best?"</P></I>
<P>Seven was wearing her blue and gray biosuit, the closet thing to a uniform
she had, but instead of trying to force her long hair up into a bun, she had it
braided and then looped it back into itself in the back. Even doubled back, it
reached past her shoulders. Seven was all business, composed and focused, and
B’Elanna couldn’t stop staring. How could she have ever thought Seven was an
unemotional "Ice Queen?" </P>
<P>Even as professional as Seven was acting, as serious as she kept her
expression, the passion just under the surface was obvious. All anyone had to do
was look. Seven’s cobalt blue eyes flickered around the room as she spoke and
the corners of her mouth edged up a fraction of a centimeter. It was enough to
let B’Elanna know that no matter how much Seven enjoyed knowledge for the sake
of knowledge, she was thrilled to have come up with a way to help
<I>Voyager</I>.</P>
<P>"So," Seven said as she pointed to the large comm panel on the wall that was
displaying the map Harry had constructed. "As you can see, the dark matter
pockets overlap creating areas of intense gravity that rival those found in
black holes."</P>
<P>"And?" Tom asked as he almost yawned. "So what? We already know that we won’t
have warp drive for…what is it? …. Four months? Thanks for the news flash."</P>
<P>He was about to continue, but the twin glares he got from Janeway and
B’Elanna made him change his mind.</P>
<P>"What it means, Mister Paris," Seven continued as if he had politely asked a
sincere question. "Is that while we may not be able to use the warp drive, but
we will still be able to travel at warp."</P>
<P>"How?" The captain leaned forward and rested her palms on the desk.</P>
<P>Seven nodded, acknowledging Janeway before pointing back at the map. "These
areas of increased gravity form swirling vortexes, similar to whirlpools. Mister
Kim and I have plotted a course between the spatial whirlpools that spin this
same direction." It was generous to say that Harry had helped plot the course
considering she was the one who quickly went through the maps and discovered the
best flight plan, but she knew how important recognition was to humans, and she
rather liked Ensign Kim.</P>
<P>"Well, it was mostly Seven," Harry said truthfully.</P>
<P>"Mister Kim, your assistance was critical to this project. Thank you for
volunteering." Seven made a point of letting the captain know that Harry had
helped of his own accord, something else humans found relevant. "Now," Seven
said, getting back to the point. "These whirlpools overlap, and where the
vortexes touch, they create an area of directed gravitational displacement."
Seven pointed to the diagram that showed a current weaving through the dark
matter field.</P>
<P>Janeway stood. "It’s a river," she said as she moved next to Seven to get a
better look. "And it’s moving faster than the speed of light." Her lips curved
up on both sides. "This is brilliant, Seven."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled brightly, because, damn it, it was a great idea, and someone
was gonna’ beam proudly over Seven’s discovery and she knew Seven wouldn’t let
her own happiness show.</P>
<P>"It was not my discovery," Seven said honestly. </P>
<P>Tom was not impressed. "So who’d you assimilate it from? Some nice
peaceful…"</P>
<P>"Paris," B’Elanna hissed before the captain could. "I’ve had about all of
your mouth that I’m gonna’…"</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat, stopping B’Elanna midsentence. "I will handle
Ensign Paris… after the meeting." Her voice was deep, and rumbled, the way it
did right before she gave someone a verbal lashing that left them feeling like
their skin had been flayed off. "Seven, please continue."</P>
<P>"As I was saying, this was not my idea. I noticed ion trails through the
matter field, and figured that previous travelers would have plotted the safest
courses. I noticed the predominate pattern and realized that the gravitational
current had propelled the ships as they traversed the sector."</P>
<P>"An astute observation," Tuvok said, impressed, but too Vulcan to say any
more.</P>
<P>"There are however, two areas that are…problematic," Seven said, bringing the
mood down a notch.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"On this end of the gravitational ‘river,’ there is an area of extreme
turbulence where the whirlpools have increased backwash. It will be unstable and
have extremely elevated gravity. The ship will have to be reinforced."</P>
<P>"Rapids," Janeway said. "I think our ship can handle a little rough
water."</P>
<P>Seven raised her metallic implant over her left eye. "This ‘rough water’ is
capable of pulling the iron out of your bloodstream."</P>
<P>"Well then," Janeway said with a smile. "It’s a good thing I take my
vitamins."</P>
<P>"Ha," the Doctor snorted. "How I wish <I>that</I> were true."</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned forward and pushed Seven’s chair away from the table as the
blonde returned to her seat. "Great job," she whispered as Seven sat down.</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to the side as she slid the chair into place. She was
glancing sideways at B’Elanna, almost coyly, and she let a whisper of a smile
pass over her lips before turning to focus on the captain. </P>
<P>"<I>Oh, yeah,"</I> B’Elanna thought. "<I>She knows she’s good</I>."</P>
<P>"All right," the captain said as she stood facing the table with her hands on
her hips. "Let’s get to work on the reinforcements. We should reach the Gravity
River in just over one day, and I want to be ready. You all have copies of
Seven’s findings, so get to work on figuring out where the structural integrity
needs to be shored up. Dismissed."</P>
<P>The crew stood and moved toward the door.</P>
<P>"Ensign Paris," Janeway said ominously. "You will be staying behind."</P>
<P>"Umm, yes ma’am," he said as he studied the carpeting.</P>
<P>Janeway stood in front of Tom, pinning him in place with her most murderous
glare until the rest of the crew disappeared behind the hissing door.</P>
<P>"Ma’am, I can explain," Tom said as the doors were hissing closed.</P>
<P>"Did I give you permission to speak?" Her eyes had lost all of their blue and
looked completely gray.</P>
<P>He opened his mouth to say "no"…then stopped. Was he supposed to speak now or
just be quiet?</P>
<P>"Well?" she demanded.</P>
<P>That answered that question. </P>
<P>"No, ma’am." </P>
<P>"Mister Paris, I will not tolerate your temper tantrums. If I had my way,
you’d be in the brig right now." She stepped closer, her anger coming off her
body in waves. Tom took a half step away before she could continue. "I got a
report about an incident in the mess hall. It seems several witnesses reported
that you hit Harry Kim." </P>
<P>The captain walked behind Paris, but he had enough sense to remain standing
at attention as she circled him.</P>
<P>"Tuvok interviewed Harry about the incident, and Harry explained that you
were showing him a Tsunkatse move and he forgot to duck." She circled back
around and stared him down, letting him know that she recognized a lie when she
heard one. "I would have you in brig except that I’d have to have Harry in the
cell next to you for lying to a superior officer, and I won’t punish him for his
loyalty…no matter how misguided."</P>
<P>Tom continued staring dead ahead. "<I>Well, at least Harry didn’t rat me
out," </I>he thought.</P>
<P>"I realize that you are having a difficult time coming to terms with recent
events," Janeway said, her voice softening to the ‘mortal wound’ tone instead of
the ‘instant death’ tone she had been using. "You can’t keep taking it out on
Seven."</P>
<P>"But…" Tom shifted his weight, as antsy as a thoroughbred in a race gate.</P>
<P>"No buts." The ‘instant death’ tone was back. "Get over it…grow up… or just
pretend that you are an adult. I don’t care what you do as long as you quit
storming around the ship like it’s your private playground and someone stole
your favorite toy." She turned and walked to the window, silent as she watched
the stars blur past. Each one was a sun, part of a solar system that whipped
past in the blink of an eye. There were probably thousands…tens of thousands of
people in each solar system dealing with broken hearts…and every one of them was
probably acting more mature than Tom Paris was.</P>
<P>"Tom," she said as she turned and walked back to him. "They are happy. Deal
with it. I hate getting involved in my crewmembers’ romantic lives, but in this
case, I have to say that you don’t have any right to act so wounded. You and
B’Elanna had broken up more than a month before she and Seven went on the away
mission."</P>
<P>"Maybe if you <I>did</I> get involved in romance with the crew this wouldn’t
have happened at all," Tom said before the adult part of his brain could
convince the child part that the words were suicidal.</P>
<P>"You will not take that tone with me." Janeway’s eyes narrowed and Tom Paris
learned first hand that the "instant death" tone was not the most lethal one in
Kathryn Janeway’s arsenal. "And you will not <I>presume</I> to comment on my
personal life."</P>
<P>"Yeah?" he asked. The helmsman often mistook stupidity for bravery. "Well,
that Borg was in love with you before she left, now all of the sudden she’s hot
for Lana? What am I supposed to think?"</P>
<P>"You are supposed to THINK." Janeway stepped closer, her chest inches from
his. She was shorter than him, but somehow managed to use the height
disadvantage to seem more imposing. "Use your brain for once and not a lower
part of your anatomy." She knew the comment was inappropriate, but damn it... He
pissed her off. She didn’t need a sniveling Ensign reminding her that she could
have had Seven if she had just reached out and taken what was offered.</P>
<P>Tom gapped at her. Had she just said what he thought she said?</P>
<P>"Report to the bridge and start working on the course Seven plotted." Kathryn
retreated into captain mode because she wasn’t sure she could keep her temper in
check if the personal nature of the discussion continued. "If I see or hear
about you throwing anymore of your hissy fits, I will put you in the brig… and
Harry will be there with you. You may not give a damn about your own career, but
maybe you’ll have a little respect for his."</P>
<P>That hurt. Harry was Tom’s best friend, and lately he done a pretty good job
of alienating him. "Yes, ma’am," he said. </P>
<P>"Both you and Ensign Kim will be pulling a double shift today. So, after the
alpha shift, Harry will have the bridge. You can ask him what post he wants you
to fill. Don’t be surprised if he has you doing grunt work," Janeway said, some
of the anger draining off her. </P>
<P>"I… I never asked Harry to lie for me," Tom said quietly.</P>
<P>"I know that," Janeway said, "If you had, I would have had you both in the
brig cleaning waste reclaimers with your sonic tooth brushes."</P>
<P>Tom let his expression show his disapproval.</P>
<P>"Yes, Mister Paris, I am not above using the ‘classics’ of military
discipline." She sighed. "Go on, get to work."</P>
<P>"Ma’am?" he paused, looking truly contrite.</P>
<P>"Yes?"</P>
<P>"I’m sorry… I was <I>really</I> out of line with those comments about you."
He looked to her expectantly, like a puppy wanting a bone, except his bone was
absolution. </P>
<P>He didn’t get it. </P>
<P>"Yes, you were," she said. "Dismissed."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna went to her quarters for lunch, hoping she would surprise Seven. She
had asked the computer where Seven was, and was thrilled when the computer
unemotionally stated ‘Seven of Nine is in her quarters.’ Seven’s quarters, not
Lieutenant B’Elanna Torres’ quarters. The computer had simply stated a fact, but
to B’Elanna it was a reminder that her dream was in fact reality. She quickened
her pace as she made her way through the corridors toward…home. </P>
<P>She entered their quarters and smiled when she saw the biosuit Seven had been
wearing earlier in the day. It was tossed across the couch, and B’Elanna
suddenly forgot about lunch and headed for the bedroom. Apparently, Seven had
some other kind of meal in mind for their lunch break. </P>
<P>She paused at the doorway and leaned in, but instead of finding Seven dressed
in a silky nightgown and propped up on a pillow, she found her wife sound
asleep. Seven was wearing a pair of flannel boxers and an oversized tee shirt,
both of which had been replicated to match B’Elanna’s ‘lazy wear.’ B’Elanna
chose the same outfit when she didn’t feeling like doing anything, or… when she
didn’t feel well. B’Elanna rushed to the bed and knelt beside it so she could
study Seven. She brushed her fingers over Seven’s forehead, checking for any
sign of fever. Seven was cool.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes flickered before slowly opening and she sighed, then yawned.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna whispered. She leaned over and kissed the forehead she had
just touched. "You feeling okay?" She looked at Seven, noticing that she had
dark rings under her eyes. "You look tired, darling."</P>
<P>Seven smiled up at her wife and moved to the far side of the bed and patted
the mattress. "I’m fine, just a little tired." She held her hand out to
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Have you seen the Doctor?" B’Elanna put her hands on her hips and gave Seven
a stern look.</P>
<P>"Lana, I’m pregnant. This is normal. Remember how tired Nara used to
get?"</P>
<P>"Okay… but when do you see him again?" B’Elanna kicked off her boots and
crawled onto the bed, groaning when she slid into Seven’s arms.</P>
<P>Seven kissed B’Elanna’s forehead, letting her lips linger on the ridges,
making sure each of the four bumps got equal attention. "I have a check up in
three days… and you know that. You made the appointment."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah…" B’Elanna snuggled closer. She had hoped that Seven had made
another appointment, though it really wasn’t necessary. B’Elanna just worried
about everything. "I’ll meet you in sickbay. It’s at thirteen hundred hours,
right?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. She was smiling and playing with the tie holding
B’Elanna’s ponytail in place. She removed it and sighed when her fingers dug
into B’Elanna’s thick, satiny hair. "I do not mind going alone," she added. She
didn’t want to force B’Elanna to leave engineering, but secretly hopped that she
would be there. Seven didn’t know if Tom Paris was scheduled for sick bay that
day, and he was beginning to get to her with his overt hostility. </P>
<P>"Not a chance," B’Elanna said. She turned her head and kissed Seven’s hand as
it played with her hair. She felt Seven’s body relax, it was subtle, considering
the exdrone was sprawled out comfortably on the mattress, but B’Elanna felt the
change. "What is it?"</P>
<P>"Hmm?" Seven let her eyes close, the idea of a nap pulling at her
consciousness.</P>
<P>"Why are you nervous about the check up? Are you sure you’re okay?" B’Elanna
lifted her weight up onto one elbow so that she could look at Seven.</P>
<P>"I am fine…the baby is fine." Seven’s eyes opened and she saw the concern on
her partner’s face. "It… it is just… I…" Seven sighed. "I believe it is time for
me to have a … discussion with Ensign Paris."</P>
<P>"Tom?" B’Elanna asked, then the realization hit her. Seven was going to
confront him, something B’Elanna knew she should have handled herself before it
began bothering Seven. "No," she ordered.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No. He is my responsibility. I’ll talk to him…today." B’Elanna hoped she
could keep her temper in check with him because she really didn’t want to end up
in the brig.</P>
<P>"I am the one he has the problem with. I will not have you fighting my
battles," Seven said as she sat up. "You do not have to protect me."</P>
<P>"The Hell I don’t," B’Elanna said a bit too quickly. "You’re my wife, and he
is my problem. I have to be the one to talk to him. Just leave him to me. I
don’t want you getting involved."</P>
<P>"I am involved." Seven’s eyes narrowed as her temper kicked in. "And you are
also my wife. It is my responsibility to protect you as well."</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said as she realized her hormonal wife was offended. "I
know you want to help, but this isn’t your place. It’s traditional for the
spouse who was involved with a…trouble maker…to deal with the problem."</P>
<P>"Isn’t my place?" Seven climbed off the bed and stared down at B’Elanna.
Seven’s hair was down, and bounced when she put her hands defiantly on her hips.
"And what is my place? To stay at home while you talk to Tom Paris…while he
tries to convince you that you should return to him, while he tries to seduce
you? I should deal with this…problem. I assure you he will not bother either of
us again."</P>
<P>B’Elanna almost laughed, almost. The idea of returning to Tom was the most
ludicrous thing she had ever heard, but if Seven brought it up, it must be
bothering her. "Seven, Tom has nothing to offer me, nothing to entice me… I have
everything I could ever want right here with you." B’Elanna stood up and moved
in front of Seven. "I’m just gonna explain to him that if he doesn’t leave us
alone…I will rip his face off." B’Elanna wrapped her hands around Seven’s waist
and she looked up at her wife.</P>
<P>"I am more than capable of ripping his face off." Seven’s lips puffed out as
she began her infamous Borg pout.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and leaned into her wife. "I know, love. That’s why I should
handle this." She let her hands migrate around to Seven’s back and then began to
massage the tight muscles of her lower back. "He’s not a complete jerk. I think
he’ll come around."</P>
<P>"I do not wish for him to come around you at all," Seven said with a twinge
of anger in her voice. "I do not like the way he… leers at you."</P>
<P>"Umm, Seven?" B’Elanna eased back and looked up at her. "I have to put up
with ninety percent of the men on board leering at you…and about sixty percent
of the women."</P>
<P>Seven raised her blonde eyebrow, letting B’Elanna know she doubted the
statistics the Klingon had just quoted, then her eyes darkened. "Yes, but I was
never in love with any of them."</P>
<P>"I never felt anything for Tom like I do for you. Yes, I loved him, but it
was… child’s play compared to what we have. You are my heart, you own my soul…
and…" B’Elanna let her hand move onto Seven’s belly, "You are the one having my
baby."</P>
<P>"It is…disconcerting. He doesn’t seem to notice those things." Seven relaxed
as B’Elanna’s hand circled her belly.</P>
<P>"He doesn’t have to. You and I know," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"I try to remember that, but…" Seven sighed again.</P>
<P>"But what?" B’Elanna reached up and caressed Seven’s cheek. "Talk to me,
love."</P>
<P>"It is different for you. I have no past," Seven explained. She felt
B’Elanna’s body stiffen as tension filled her compact frame. "What is it?" Seven
asked.</P>
<P>"You have a past. Your past just has a lot more integrity and class,"
B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Explain." Seven studied B’Elanna’s expression. She didn’t like the worry
lines around her wife’s eyes.</P>
<P>"The captain," B’Elanna said as her eyes locked with Seven’s.</P>
<P>"I had feelings for her at one time, but she did not return them." Confusion
covered Seven’s face. "And you know that you are my life, you gave me my soul,
Be’nal." She stroked B’Elanna’s cheek with the back of her fingers. "You are
everything to me. I love you. My feelings for the captain never filled me the
way you do."</P>
<P>"I love you, too." B’Elanna pressed her cheek against Seven’s fingers.
"But…"</P>
<P>"There are not buts," Seven said sharply. "We love each other…nothing else
matters."</P>
<P>"The captain is in love with you," B’Elanna explained.</P>
<P>"That is… preposterous." Seven’s eyes widened. "She is happy for us. She has
told me so. I have seen her looking at us…together…and she smiles. Tom Paris
does not smile when he looks at us."</P>
<P>"Like I said, she has more integrity and class than Tom."</P>
<P>"That is obvious, but I do not see how that relates to this conversation,"
Seven said.</P>
<P>"Seven, my beloved…" B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "You are so
incredible. Your heart is so true that you don’t even notice how she looks at
you, do you?"</P>
<P>"I do not care how anyone else looks at me. I only care about you." Seven
studied her wife, wondering if she should perhaps pay attention to other
people’s expressions. With the exception of Tom Paris, she really didn’t care
how anyone else looked at her or B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven, I’ve seen the captain when she doesn’t realize I’m watching her. She
loves you, but she can tell you’re happy. She would never interfere with that."
B’Elanna’s face saddened. "Darling, she looks at you like I would if I ever lost
you."</P>
<P>"You will never lose me. How could you even say that?" Anger covered Seven’s
face. </P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna soothed. "I’m not saying that…just that I recognize how much
she loves you." She sighed and rested her forehead on Seven’s chest. "I guess
I’ll talk to her when I finish with Tom."</P>
<P>"No," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Seven, I need to clear the air with her. I have too much respect for her not
to," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"No," Seven repeated. "She is my responsibility. If what you say is true,
then I should handle this."</P>
<P>"I don’t think that’s such a good idea. I have a lot more experience with
this kind of thing." B’Elanna eased back and looked up at Seven, imploring her
to give in.</P>
<P>"So you must handle your own romantic entanglements, but I am incapable of
handling mine?" Seven asked. She was angry, but she knew in the back of her mind
it wouldn’t have bothered her so much if she wasn’t so tired, and if she didn’t
ache all over. She loved being pregnant, but in the last few days, she had felt
progressively worse, not enough to think she was ill, just the cumulative
effects of being tired.</P>
<P>"I didn’t say that," B’Elanna said carefully. She could see the fire in
Seven’s eyes and was working overtime to extinguish it before it burned them
both. "It’s just that you two never actually had a relationship, and…well… since
I understand how easy you are to love…I would be the logical choice," B’Elanna
said as she tired using a more practical approach.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven said. She smiled, seeing right through her wife’s blatant
attempt to shift her focus. "I will speak to the captain. You must let me do
this. It is the right thing to do."</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said. "I’ll talk to Tom, you talk to Janeway, but if you
don’t feel comfortable… I can go with you…"</P>
<P>Seven raised an accusing eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Okay…okay. Besides? How bad can it turn out?" B’Elanna asked.</P>

<P>Kathryn Janeway sat at her desk in her ready room studying the data on the
gravitational river. It was an amazing piece of deduction on Seven’s part. She
had figured out how to use the gravity currents with only a smattering of
evidence left behind by the previous ships. Janeway admitted to herself that
while she may have figured it out eventually, it would have taken her far longer
than it had taken Seven. She looked up when the ready room door chime sounded.
</P>
<P>"Come in," she ordered. The doors hissed open and B’Elanna Torres walked in.
</P>
<P>"Captain? You asked to see me?" B’Elanna walked over and stood in front of
Janeway’s desk. </P>
<P>"Yes. Thank you for coming so quickly. I know you’ve been working overtime in
engineering to get things ready." Janeway pointed to the chair next to Torres.
"Have a seat, please." </P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am, we’re almost finished." B’Elanna sat, keeping her back straight.
</P>
<P>"Relax, B’Elanna." Janeway smiled. "I’m not checking up on you. I just wanted
to thank you for all the extra effort you’ve put in on this. I know you haven’t
had much time off to get acclimated to being back on board." </P>
<P>"We’re fine," B’Elanna said, unconsciously mentioning Seven anytime she
thought about her own well being; their fates were completely intertwined. </P>
<P>"Glad to hear it." Janeway smiled. She caught the plural reference. "You both
certainly look well." Kathryn ran her fingers through he own hair, and nodded
toward B’Elanna. "That’s a good look on you." </P>
<P>B’Elanna blushed. "Seven likes it long." </P>
<P>"She’s done a great job on the gravitational river. I’m impressed." Kathryn
leaned back and studied B’Elanna. She looked fabulous. </P>
<P>"Seven was happy to help," B’Elanna said, unaware that her eyes sparkled when
she said her wife’s name. </P>
<P>"I’m happy for the two of you," Kathryn said sincerely. "You’re a good
match." </P>
<P>"Thank you." B’Elanna decided that there was no time like the present. Seven
couldn’t possibly be mad at her…It wasn’t like she had approached the captain.
Janeway brought it up. "Captain, there’s something I’d like to talk you about.
Off the record… it’s a personal matter." </P>
<P>"All right." Kathryn leaned forward and rested her chin on her closed fist.
</P>
<P>"Umm," B’Elanna said as she looked around the ready room, not quite sure how
to start. "This is really hard. Captain... Kathryn..." B’Elanna looked into the
older woman’s eyes to see if she would balk at the use of her first name. </P>
<P>"Go ahead, B’Elanna." Janeway smiled disarmingly. </P>
<P>"Thank you. Kathryn, I don’t want this to sound...possessive, or defensive or
confrontational..." B’Elanna realized this was going to be much harder than she
had first thought. </P>
<P>"What is it?" Kathryn’s eyes were completely sincere, and her face showed
honest concern. "Just say it." </P>
<P>"Okay." B’Elanna sighed. "I just want you to know that I appreciate the
support you’ve shown Seven and I... Despite your feelings for her." </P>
<P>Kathryn raised both eyebrows, but didn’t deny it. Inside she was panicking,
she had tried so hard to keep her feelings hidden. Obviously she hadn’t done a
very good job. </P>
<P>"Seven and I both care a great deal for you," B’Elanna continued. "I’m so
sorry that you...that you are hurting." </P>
<P>"Hey," Kathryn said quietly. "Don’t ever apologize for being happy." She
leaned back and shook her head, then smiled ruefully. "I can’t say that I am
happy I was so obvious, but I can promise you that I am happy for you both."
</P>
<P>"You’re not obvious," B’Elanna assured her. "It’s just that I recognize what
you feel." </P>
<P>"Yes, I guess you would," Kathryn conceded. "I hope this doesn’t interfere
with our friendship, B’Elanna. I assure you, I have complete respect for your
relationship." </P>
<P>"Kathryn, I know that." B’Elanna stood and walked around the desk and leaned
against it, facing Kathryn. "That’s why I wanted to talk to you. You have been a
wonderful friend, mentor, and champion for me, and Seven. She considers you one
of her best friends, and I’d hate to see her lose that. I don’t want to lose
your friendship either." </P>
<P>"That won’t happen." Kathryn smiled up at B’Elanna. "It helps that you’re
both so happy. I’m happy for you. I’ve never seen either of you so... so..."
Kathryn searched for the right word. </P>
<P>"Complete?" B’Elanna offered. </P>
<P>"Yes, complete." Kathryn stood. "If either of you need anything, just ask. I
mean that." </P>
<P>"We will," B’Elanna said as she stood. "Oh, which reminds me, after we get
through the dark matter field... we might need a little time off." She smiled
shyly. </P>
<P>"You’ve earned it," Janeway said. "After all, that away mission was a bit
longer than expected. You’re overdue for about three months of leave." </P>
<P>"I think we’ll save some of that time off for after the baby," B’Elanna said
as Kathryn walked her to the door. </P>
<P>"Good enough. That’ll give you time to train a replacement for your absence."
Kathryn smiled, but inside, she ached, the mention of the baby another reminder
of what she didn’t have. </P>
<P>"Thanks, captain," B’Elanna said as she walked onto the bridge. Janeway
smiled and waved as the Klingon went to the turbolift<I>. "Well, that was easy.
Now I just have to talk to Tom,"</I> B’Elanna thought. <BR></P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Finding Tom only required one question to the computer. He was in his
quarters, and B’Elanna considered waiting until he was in a more public
location, but then realized that he might not be as belligerent without an
audience. She stood in front of his door for a moment before activating the
chime.</P>
<P>Tom was sitting on his couch eating dinner and watching the television that
B’Elanna had constructed for him. He looked at the door when the chime
sounded.</P>
<P>"Go away," he yelled.</P>
<P>"Tom, open the door. We have to talk," B’Elanna responded through the closed
door. She knew how to override his privacy code. In fact, he probably hadn’t
changed it since they had been together. She had changed hers as soon as she
broke up with him.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" he said as he jumped up. ‘<I>She finally came to her senses,</I>’
he thought as he went to the door, pausing to smooth his hair with both hands.
"Come in," he said as the door opened. He gave her a charming smile. "Guess you
missed me, huh?"</P>
<P>"Tom…" B’Elanna rolled her eyes, but he took it as a playful gesture instead
of recognizing it as exasperation.</P>
<P>"Lana, I really like your hair like that. I love the way you tie it so far
down your back…it makes it look, Klingon…wild. I’ll bet it feels great." He
stepped closer and reached for her ponytail.</P>
<P>She knocked his hand away as she stepped back. "What part of ‘<I>I am
married’</I> do you not understand?" </P>
<P>"Lana, you were trapped on a planet, all alone. I understand you were…lonely,
and hey, she is hot, but…"</P>
<P>"Tom, I’m trying to be civil, but you’re making it really difficult not to
kick your ass." B’Elanna walked over and looked at the TV. The sound was muted
but she recognized the program, Buck Rogers.</P>
<P>"All that hostility?" Tom asked with a smirk. "There must be some feelings
left if I still get under your skin." </P>
<P>He was so smug it took all of B’Elanna’s strength to keep from smacking the
half smile off of his face. </P>
<P>"Paris, I came to talk to you because, believe or not I do care, as a friend.
You’re making a complete ass of yourself, which is pitiful, but not my business.
You are also harassing my wife. That is my business. I won’t put up with
that."</P>
<P>"Okay…" Tom stopped and studied B’Elanna. He realized Seven must have done
quite a number on her to have her acting so… well, so married. He decided to
switch tactics. "So, is that all you came to say? Do you think we can still be
friends, Lana?" He gave her his wounded puppy look.</P>
<P>"That’s up to you, Tom. I love Seven. She’s my life, and I won’t let anyone
or anything hurt her. I’d rather die… or kill." B’Elanna rubbed her hand,
massaging the palm. She had calluses on her hands from the tools she hadn’t used
in years. On the planet, she used different tools every day, but none quite like
the ones in engineering, and not for the long hours she had used them earlier in
the day.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I want to work this out, okay?" He looked over his shoulder. "Can
you give me a second, I need to splash some water on my face. I just climbed out
of a Jeffrey’s tube. I was reinforcing the bridge structural integrity fields
all afternoon. Give me a minute, okay?"</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she sat on the edge of the couch. "I’ve been
crawling around them myself. I feel like I’m covered in grime." She was perched
on the edge of the cushion, still not comfortable relaxing.</P>
<P>Tom smiled, not believing how lucky he was, and then hurried into his
bathroom, splashed water onto his face and quickly dried off. He opened the
medicine cabinet and took out a small jar of salve. He looked over his shoulder
and then smelled the medicine and rubbed some onto his thumb. He carefully
closed the jar without smudging his thumb and hurried back to the living
room.</P>
<P>"Lana, I’m sorry I’ve been so… difficult." He moved over to the couch, but
before he could sit next to her, she stood.</P>
<P>"Tom, can’t you just try to be happy for me?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I’m trying," he said. He crinkled his brow, frowning as he studied her
neck.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna rubbed her neck self-consciously.</P>
<P>"Grime," he said as he reached out and used his thumb to rub her throat just
under the ear. "There, got it." He smiled. "I really should finish my dinner.
Janeway’s got me pulling a double. I guess I asked for it."</P>
<P>"Just try to be nice, Tom. I know you’ve got it in you." B’Elanna moved
toward the door. "I’m glad you still like the TV."</P>
<P>"You kidding? I love it," he said as she opened the door. "Thanks, Lana," he
said as she left.</P>
<P>"Be nice," she said again as she went down the corridor<I>. ‘I really have
the hang of these sensitive talks,’</I> she thought as she headed back to
engineering.</P>
<P>Tom went into the bathroom and washed his hands. He looked down at his thumb,
which was turning purple, and smiled. "Now for a little chat with the Borg," he
said to the mirror.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven was in Astrometrics when she heard the door open. She turned to see Tom
Paris coming toward her and she stood to her full height.</P>
<P>"Ensign Paris, if you are here for the course corrections, I have already
sent them to the bridge." Seven was not in the mood to put up with his antics.
Her back was aching and she was exhausted even after she had taken a short
nap.</P>
<P>"I just came to see if you had anything I should know about before I report
to the bridge for the beta shift," Tom said as circled her. </P>
<P>"You were on the alpha shift," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"Janeway thought I could use a double." He moved in front of Seven, blocking
her view of the console.</P>
<P>"You are disturbing my work. Please move." Seven wondered what B’Elanna would
say if she talked to him about his attitude, then decided she would not break
her promise to B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"Sorry," he said as he moved aside. "It must be hard for you."</P>
<P>Seven looked at him and raised an eyebrow. </P>
<P>"You know, being back here, with everyone. It’s not just you and Lana
anymore," he explained.</P>
<P>"We are adapting, Ensign." Seven wanted to choke him for calling her wife
‘Lana.’</P>
<P>"Yes," he smiled broadly, then leered at Seven. "I’m glad to see that you’re
so…open minded."</P>
<P>"Explain," Seven demanded. She was tired of his games.</P>
<P>"Oh," he said, suddenly looking like he had ruined some surprise, or revealed
something he shouldn’t have. "I…I thought you and Lana had an open relationship.
I mean, when she came by to…visit me this afternoon, I thought…well never
mind."</P>
<P>"Explain," she demanded again. "What is an ‘open relationship?’"</P>
<P>"Never mind. I really should be going. Tell Lana I really enjoyed
our…conversation this afternoon." He moved toward the door. "If you have
anything new, send it up to the bridge."</P>
<P>Seven glared at him as he left. She didn’t like him coming to her department
and didn’t believe he was being truthful about the reason for being there. She
closed her console and logged off for the day.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna hurried home after her shift, eager to see Seven. She missed her
wife, and she was a bit confused by the glances and giggles she kept getting
from her crew. She wanted to go to her quarters and fall into bed…with
Seven.</P>
<P>"Hey, I missed you," B’Elanna said as she came through the door. Seven was
resting on the couch with her feet up.</P>
<P>"And I missed you, Be’nal." Seven sat up and smiled at B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"You look tired," B’Elanna said with a frown. "Are you working too hard?" She
sat next to Seven and lifted the exdrone’s feet onto her lap and began rubbing
her calves.<BR></P>
<P>"I <I>am</I> tired," Seven said as she leaned back into the couch. She sighed
as B’Elanna worked the tension out of her legs. She had forgotten how many hours
she used to spend on her feet. On the planet, when they were on their feet they
were walking through the dense forest, not standing in one place on the hard
deck plating.</P>
<P>"Seven, I’m getting scared, you shouldn’t be this tired." B’Elanna ran her
hand up Seven’s leg then detoured to her hand and squeezed it.</P>
<P>"I am fine." Seven yawned.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said, not quite convinced. "How about some dinner?"</P>
<P>"Okay," Seven said as she sat up.</P>
<P>"We can eat here tonight. You rest," B’Elanna ordered.</P>
<P>"I will rest later," Seven said as she pulled her legs around and she leaned
over and kissed B’Elanna’s cheek. "I have not welcomed you home. Come here," she
ordered in a husky whisper.</P>
<P>B’Elanna turned her head and welcomed Seven’s lips. The kiss started slow,
with tender bites, and tongues tracing lips before entering. Seven shifted her
weight and draped herself across B’Elanna’s lap as the Klingon took control of
the embrace. B’Elanna moaned into Seven’s mouth as her tongue massaged Seven’s
and her hands moved across the prone former Borg’s chest. </P>
<P>"I thought you were tired," B’Elanna said when she pulled away for a
breath.</P>
<P>"I am never too tired to properly greet my wife," Seven explained.</P>
<P>"I love you," B’Elanna whispered and gave Seven a quick kiss on the
forehead.</P>
<P>"I am glad," Seven said. "I love you too." She suddenly frowned, considering
her talk with Tom Paris. "B’Elanna? What is an ‘open relationship?’ Does it mean
that we are completely honest with each other?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna stared down at Seven, shocked. "What are you talking about?"</P>
<P>"Tom Paris came by Astrometrics," Seven said. "He said you talked with him,
and that he believed we had an ‘open relationship.’ I assumed, given our level
of trust, that must have been what he meant."</P>
<P>"I’ll kill him." B’Elanna’s face contorted with rage. "That bastard."</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"An open relationship means that a couple agrees to take lovers," B’Elanna
said with her teeth clinched.</P>
<P>"Why would he think that?" Seven stood up and stretched, trying to get the
kink out of her back.</P>
<P>"I’m sure he didn’t. He probably thought he could start trouble between us."
B’Elanna stood and moved over and took Seven by the shoulders, looking her in
the eyes. "What else did he say?"</P>
<P>"Nothing of consequence," Seven said. She tilted her head and then concern
filled her eyes. "You are injured." She reached out and touched B’Elanna’s neck.
There was a small purple mark on her neck.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna rubbed her throat.</P>
<P>Seven leaned over and studied it, then gently ran her fingers over it. Her
Borg enhanced eye zoomed in on the skin and she noted that it was not a
contusion at all. Rage filled her eyes and she took a deep breath.</P>
<P>"I know precisely why he said what he did," Seven said. She gently took
B’Elanna by the arm and led her to the bathroom and pointed out the mark.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened as she saw what looked like a well placed hickey. "I…
I…I never! I swear."</P>
<P>"Of course you did not," Seven said. "He obviously caused this mark in some
manner other than using his mouth."</P>
<P>"It’s that easy for you?" B’Elanna’s eyes filled with tears. "You just
believe me like that?" She was furious with Tom, but Seven’s complete faith
melted her heart. She wondered if she could be as trusting if Seven came home
sporting a hickey. She hoped so.</P>
<P>"I believe <I>in</I> you, in <I>us</I>, and I know our hearts are bonded."
Seven rubbed the mark in question. "Besides, I am familiar with your hickeys…
they do not discolor in this manner."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. She loved when Seven, the prim and proper former Borg
drone, used words like hickey.</P>
<P>"But," Seven said. "I will deal with Ensign Paris. It is obvious he assaulted
you in some manner." Her eyes turned cold, and B’Elanna remember the men in the
cell, the vacant looks in their lifeless eyes.</P>
<P>"I’ll take care of him," B’Elanna said. "But this time, I won’t
be…diplomatic."</P>
<P>"He hurt you," Seven stated, her voice quivering with the rage she held in
check. The more she thought about it, the more angry she became.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna said as she pulled Seven to her. "He didn’t even touch me. I
don’t know how he…" B’Elanna closed her eyes and sighed, and she remembered him
touching her neck, right where the mark was. She also remembered the stares and
giggles when she returned to engineering after her talk with him. "That
bastard."</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna pulled away and went to the other room and found her tricorder under
a stack of padds. She went to Seven and held it out. "Scan me." She handed it to
Seven.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow and carefully lifted B’Elanna’s chin, her fingers
warm against the Klingon’s skin. "There are traces of an organic compound. I am
not familiar with it." She handed the tricorder back to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I know this," B’Elanna said as she looked at it and tried to remember what
it was. She went to the comm panel and downloaded the data to the main computer.
"Computer, identify this compound… common name."</P><I>
<P>*"Working,"*</I> the computer responded and chirped as it processed the data.
<I>*"The compound is the synthetic form of Vulcan athletic balm."*</P></I>
<P>B’Elanna turned to Seven. "Vulcan athletic balm is used to help bring blood
to an injured muscle. If it’s used full strength, on a non Vulcan species, it
draws the blood to the surface, leaving a bruise."</P>
<P>Seven’s rage returned. "Is it dangerous?" she demanded.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she shook her head.</P>
<P>"Then I will not have to kill him," Seven said. She was not making a
joke.</P>

<P>Voyager approached the gravitational river on schedule, but most of the
senior staff members were not on the bridge as they neared the event horizon.
B’Elanna was in engineering, Seven was in Astrometrics monitoring the dark
matter, and Tom Paris and Harry Kim were both taking a mandatory rest after
pulling a double the night before. The captain decided to wait an additional
eight hours so that Tom and Harry could come on duty. She was angry with Tom,
but he was the best pilot on the ship, and she wanted him at the helm. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several hours before the ‘big event’ B’Elanna went to Astrometrics to see
Seven. She had waited while Seven regenerated before they began their shift, and
had promised to meet her for their late afternoon break. Seven had said that she
needed some advice, but wouldn’t elaborate.</P>
<P>Seven turned when she heard the door open, and smiled when she saw her wife
heading toward her with a small container. Seven was glad she worked alone,
because she could properly greet her beloved.</P>
<P>"I was not aware that we were having a picnic," Seven said as she tried to
snatch the package.</P>
<P>"Not a picnic," B’Elanna said as she yanked the container away from Seven’s
grabby hands. "Just a snack for my fussy wife."</P>
<P>"Then give it to me before I show you how fussy I can be," Seven said
menacingly.</P>
<P>"Oh, trust me, I know how fussy you can be." B’Elanna held the container
behind her back.</P>
<P>"Then kiss me." Seven smiled and moved against B’Elanna. She wrapped the
smaller woman in her arms, using the closeness to reach behind her and grab the
food container.</P>
<P>"Hey?" B’Elanna protested weakly. She smiled as she watched Seven rip open
the package.</P>
<P>"Nuts?" Seven asked happily when she saw the contents.</P>
<P>"You were craving those crunchy nuts we used to get down by the lake."
B’Elanna moved closer and picked up one of the nuts and fed it to Seven. "I had
to taste every damn nut in Neelix’s kitchen to find one that tasted like your
favorite."</P>
<P>"Mmm." Seven closed her eyes, savoring the flavor. She had been craving the
sweet nuts since they had left the planet, but she hadn’t been brave enough to
ask Neelix to find a substitute.</P>
<P>"Good?" B’Elanna smiled. "You owe me, love. I can’t tell you how disgusting
most of the nuts I tried were."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said sincerely, then took and handful of the nuts and put
them all into her mouth.</P>
<P>"So, what did you need?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Seven’s smile disappeared. "I am… experiencing… apprehension, about… talking
with the captain."</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded. "I can understand that, but I don’t think you have to worry
about that."</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven reached out and took another nut.</P>
<P>"I…ah…already spoke to her," B’Elanna confessed.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven demanded. "You forbid me to confront…<I>him</I>, and yet you
approached Kathryn?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna flinched. It wasn’t the tone, or the fact that she knew she was
wrong, it was hearing Seven call the captain by her first name. It was so
intimate.</P>
<P>"You didn’t think I could handle it, did you?" Seven asked. Her eyes shined
as tears welled up. "How could you?" Pain covered Seven’s pale features.</P>
<P>"No, Seven…it wasn’t like that," B’Elanna said as she took Seven’s hands in
hers. She felt a lump in her throat as she watched a tear slide down Seven’s
cheek.</P>
<P>"How was it?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"I meant to tell you last night, it just slipped my mind," B’Elanna said,
digging the hole deeper.</P>
<P>"Last night?" Seven pulled away from B’Elanna. "You did this last night?"</P>
<P>"That doesn’t matter," B’Elanna said. "What matters is that she called me to
talk to her, and it just came up."</P>
<P>"You promised me," Seven said. She turned and walked away. "Please
leave."</P>
<P>"Seven, please," B’Elanna pleaded.</P>
<P>"Go," Seven ordered. She was hurt, and angry, and couldn’t believe that
B’Elanna would break a promise to her.</P>
<P>She turned to leave, wanting to let Seven calm down, but she stopped. "No,"
B’Elanna said. "I won’t walk out with you thinking I betrayed you. Damn it,
Seven. Turn around and talk to me."</P>
<P>For a moment neither moved, Seven stared at the wall, and B’Elanna stared at
Seven’s back, looking for some sign that she would give in. Finally Seven’s
shoulders dropped, and B’Elanna knew she would talk to her.</P>
<P>"Why, Be’nal?" Seven whispered.</P>
<P>The pain in Seven voice cut into B’Elanna’s chest, so physical was the injury
that B’Elanna almost stumbled. "The captain called me to talk to me, and it just
came up," B’Elanna said, her voice barely a whisper, pain making her voice
crack.</P>
<P>Seven turned, pulled by the pain in her wife’s voice. "You are…hurt," Seven
said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded, unable to respond.</P>
<P>The doors hissed open and Harry Kim came in, yawning.</P>
<P>"Get out," B’Elanna and Seven turned and yelled in unison.</P>
<P>Harry’s eyes widened and he practically ran as he spun and left.</P>
<P>Seven spoke first. "You promised."</P>
<P>"We were already talking, she… she was telling me how happy she was for us.
It just seemed like the perfect time." B’Elanna knew that it had been a good
time to talk to Janeway, and she wondered briefly why Seven was so upset. Then
she realized, she had never broken her word to Seven, ever, not in any matter,
until now. She realized she could have waited, could have let Seven bring it up
in her own time. "Oh, god, Seven I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you."</P>
<P>Seven saw the regret in B’Elanna’s eyes. She took a deep breath and closed
her eyes. She thought about what had happened, about B’Elanna, and how much she
loved her, trusted her. Then she thought about the captain. It would be just
like Janeway to begin a conversation that would lead to a discussion of
feelings, and it would be awkward to avoid the issue and bring it up again
later.</P>
<P>B’Elanna edged closer, needing closeness.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes opened. "No, B’Elanna. I am sorry. I know you would not
intentionally break your word to me. If it came up, you should have taken
advantage of the opportunity."</P>
<P>B’Elanna closed her eyes and released a sigh, and tears rolled down her
cheeks. "Thank you," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Shh," Seven said as she wrapped her arms around B’Elanna. The Klingon
collapsed into Seven, clinging to her.</P>
<P>"I’m so sorry." </P>
<P>"No, do not apologize. You have done nothing wrong," Seven assured her. "I am
being…hormonal."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "Well, so am I."</P>
<P>"How did the conversation go?" Seven asked without letting B’Elanna go.</P>
<P>"Great, actually," B’Elanna said and then explained in detail.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway stared at the forward viewscreen, amazed by what she saw.
"Incredible," she said, shaking her head. The gravitational river was in front
of them, and unlike most anomalies involving gravity, this one was quite
visible. The light from the surrounding stars was bending toward the river, and
there were flickers of light as any meteorites and space debris were being
sucked into the river and being shot across the length of the disturbance.</P>
<P>"It’s beautiful," Chakotay said, his eyes sparkling. He was an anthropologist
by choice, but still a scientist at heart, and he was seeing something he had
never even heard of. "I thought only a black hole could bend light like that."
The surrounding light was being pulled from every source making the length of
the river look like a series of pinwheels.</P>
<P>"Take us in Tom," Janeway said calmly. Inside she was adding another notch on
her professional belt, one more first for <I>Voyager</I> and her crew. "Nice and
steady."</P>
<P>"Aye ma’am," he said as he headed into it.</P>
<P>The ship bucked as it was rocked by the pounding gravity. Tuvok was thrown to
the floor, landing next to Harry Kim. The rest of the bridge crew were already
seated, still, Janeway had to cling to the arm of her chair to keep from joining
Harry and Tuvok on the floor. It wasn’t especially graceful or elegant, but it
worked in a pinch.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paris, I’d appreciate it if you’d keep my ship in one piece. We don’t
have warranty service out here," she said as the ship was tossed in the opposite
direction.</P>
<P>"I'm trying, captain," Tom said as he fought to bring the ship into the
safety of the gravitational river. "Okay," he said as the ship stopped pitching
and settled into a bouncing rhythm.</p>
<p>"Tom," Chakotay said as he loosened
his grip on his chair arms. "Can we looked forward to this for the next fourteen
hours?"</p>
<p>"No," Janeway answered for him. "We only anticipate rough travel
through the rapids. We should clear them in about an hour and a
half."</p>
<p>Tuvok raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment. He was already feeling
space sick.</p>
<p>***</P>
<p>In Astrometrics, the first impact knocked Seven to the floor. As she
tried to stand, the second lurch sent her sprawling onto her backside. She sat
there until the ship stopped flinging in every direction and began to rattle and
shake as they entered the rapids. Only then did she stand and make her way back
to the console and check the flight path. True, she knew what it would tell her,
but she liked to be certain.</p>
<p>She rubbed her forehead and rested her
weight against the console and decided that she may have to torture B’Elanna.
They had completely patched things up before the Klingon left for engineering,
but B’Elanna had never mentioned anything about pregnancy causing space
sickness. B’Elanna was in serious trouble.</p>
<p>***</P>
<P>An hour and a half later, B’Elanna was more than ready for the shaking to
stop. Most of her precious tools had been rattling obnoxiously inside their
cabinets the entire time and she was about to throw every tool on the ship out
an airlock and replicate new ones when they finished crossing the gravitational
rapids. One final lurch and the ship settled into its normal smooth
flight.</p>
<p>"It’s about damn time," Torres said to no one in particular, then
turned to her Vulcan officer. "Vorik, run a complete diagnostic and see if
anything shook apart."</p>
<p>Vorik nodded and went to his own comm station to
begin the check. He didn’t point out that starships were designed for rough
travel and the likelihood that <I>Voyager</I> would actually fly apart at the
seams from some minor bouncing was quite rare. He also knew from experience such
an astute observation would not be taken well by the volatile half-Klingon Chief
Engineer.</p>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p>Seven felt awful. She was nauseous, and sore, and worst of all, she
didn’t have B’Elanna there to hold her. On Jusari Prime, when she had
experienced morning sickness, she took great comfort from B’Elanna’s tender
devotion. Dealing with the space sickness alone just made her feel worse. To
make it even more aggravating, now she was getting cramps.</p>
<p>She went to
the console on the far side of the room and began checking for any sign that the
sensors had been vibrated out of alignment when she suddenly felt the room spin.
She grabbed the console, wondering why the bridge hadn’t given any warning, then
she realized it wasn’t the room that was moving. She slid down the console and
rested her head on her bent knees and tried to take slow breaths. She knew she
had to monitor the ship’s progression through the gravitational river, but she
couldn’t seem to stand. Space sickness was far more disabling than morning
sickness. At least she wasn’t vomiting. She hated that particular human bodily
function.</p>
<p>***</P>
<p>Kathryn Janeway smiled, hoping all of her teeth were still intact and
hadn’t been shaken out of her mouth. "Ensign Kim, I want a ship wide diagnostic
and damage reports from all divisions," she ordered.</p>
<p>"Aye, ma’am," he
said as he straightened his uniform.</p>
<p>"What is that?" Neelix asked as he
pointed to the viewscreen. There were hundreds of meteorites and chunks of
debris in the surrounding space and all of it seemed to be matching
<I>Voyager’s</I> course exactly.</p>
<p>"That is flotsam, just like us." Janeway
smiled ruefully at the Talaxian who had asked to witness the unique anomaly from
the unused science station on the bridge. "That debris field was all of those
tiny points of light we saw being sucked into the river. Inside here, we're all
moving the same speed. Just along for the ride."</p>
<p>"It’s not nearly as
beautiful in here," Neelix noted.</p>
<p><I>* "Seven of Nine to the
bridge."*</I></p>
<p>"Go ahead, Seven," Janeway said.</p>
<p><I>*"Captain...
"*</I> Seven paused, and her voice was odd, disconnected.</p>
<p>"Seven, is
everything all right?" Janeway stood like she always did when something bothered
her and she needed to feel like she was doing something.</p>
<p><I>*"No,"*</I>
Seven said, her voice filled with disgust. *<I>"I am unable to access the
consoles, and I need someone to replace me in Astrometrics."*</I></p>
<p>"What’s
wrong?" Chakotay asked. Behind him Neelix turned around and his wrung his yellow
hands.</p>
<p><I>*"I am experiencing extreme space sickness,"*</I> Seven
responded bitterly. <I>*"I cannot reach the console."*<BR></I><BR>"Where are
you?" Chakotay asked.</p>
<p>There was long pause before Seven sheepishly
answered. <I>*"On the floor."*</I></p>
<p>"I'll send someone right up," the
captain promised. She would have laughed at the comical image of the elegant
exdrone sprawled across the floor, but there was more than irritation in Seven’s
voice. There was fear. "Seven, I want you to report to sickbay, on the
double."</p>
<p><I>*"Yes, captain. Seven of Nine out."*</I></p>
<p>Seven never
agreed to go to sickbay, not without an argument, and her agreement now made
Kathryn very nervous.</p>
<p>"Captain," Neelix said. "I’d be happy to go down
and take over for Seven," he offered.</p>
<p>"I'm worried too," Janeway said as
she smiled knowingly. She knew the Talaxian could run the Astrometrics scanners
in a pinch, but the concern on his furry features gave away his real intent.
"Go, and instead of baby-sitting Astrometrics, make sure she gets to sickbay.
We’ll have Harry monitor the scanners from ops."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Neelix said
as he hurried to the turbolift.</p>
<p>At the helm, Tom Paris smiled. He figured
Seven wasn’t space sick as much as she was just good old fashioned angry. Harry
Kim had told him about walking in on Seven and B’Elanna in the middle of a huge
fight. Obviously his plan had worked perfectly. B’Elanna had returned home
sporting a hickey, and Seven had gone ballistic. B’Elanna probably tried to
explain that she must have bumped into something in one of the Jeffrey’s tubes.
The Borg must have refused to believe her. He was sure that they would both have
been too upset to even consider checking for any other cause. Tom shook his
head, and smiled; it was almost too easy.</p>
<p>Neelix asked the computer for Seven’s location for the second time, and
she was still in Astrometrics. It was just like her to wait to be relieved
before leaving her post, he thought. The doors opened and he saw her on floor,
leaning against the console with her eyes closed. She was paler than he had ever
seen her, and that was saying a lot considering he had seen her when she was
completely Borg.</p>
<p>"Seven?" He ran to her, kneeling and feeling her face,
she was cold, and clammy, and her eyes didn’t open when he touched
her.</p>
<p>"Mister Neelix," she said without opening her eyes. "Could you
assist me? I cannot seem to stand."</p>
<p>"Neelix to sickbay, medical
emergency, transport Seven of Nine directly to sickbay." He leaned back but she
didn’t dematerialize as expected.</p>
<p><I>*"Mister Neelix?"*</I> the Doctor’s
voice came over Neelix’s comm badge. <I>*"We can’t get a lock on Seven. What is
the problem?"*<BR></I><BR>"Doctor," Seven answered. "I am experiencing space
sickness. I am reporting to sickbay now." She opened her eyes and tried to
stand, but was only successful when Neelix pulled her to her
feet.</p>
<p>"Easy," Neelix said as he wrapped his arm around her
waist.</p>
<p><I>*"Seven?"* </I>the Doctor asked. *<I>"If you’re sure you’re all
right, I’ll let Mister Neelix bring you in. All the people with similar
complaints are still emptying out of my sickbay. This rough ride has taken its
toll on the crew."*<BR></I><BR>"Acceptable," Seven said as she nodded toward the
door. She wished B’Elanna were there. Her wife’s touch was much more soothing
than Neelix’s despite his sincere concern and the way his grip was gentle, yet
firm.</p>
<p>"Just a little farther," Neelix said when they were almost to the
turbolift. "You know, space sickness causes some nasty cramping, and from the
way you’re holding your stomach, I'll bet you’d like some nice hot tea to settle
that tummy."</p>
<p>"You would lose that wager," Seven responded. "In fact I
believe you would end up wearing your tea," she added, remembering the time
B’Elanna had tried giving her tea for her nausea on the planet. Even Lana’s
Klingon reflexes hadn’t been fast enough to help her avoid the tea on its return
journey. </p>
<p>"He he he..." Neelix giggled. "At least your sense of humor in
intact," he said.</p>
<p>Neelix’s unique laugh was a comfortingly familiar
sound. Seven really did like the silly man. All thought of comfort left Seven’s
mind as she dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>"Lana," Seven yelled as she double over
and clutched her belly.</p>
<p>Neelix reacted instantly, drafting the nearest
crewmember. "Lieutenant Larson, come here," he ordered.</p>
<p>Larson jogged
over to him, concerned by the display. All of the crew in the corridor had
stopped what they were doing and moved closer to offer assistance.</p>
<p>"Grab
her," Neelix ordered as he moved to her side. The two men lifted her and hurried
to the turbolift.</p>
<p>"This is not space sickness," Seven said. Her teeth
were tightly clinched and she was now sweating profusely.</p>
<p>"Easy, Seven,"
Neelix said. "We’ll get you to sick bay in no time." They stepped into the
turbolift and Larson ordered the lift to sickbay, adding the emergency express
command that kept the lift from stopping for other passengers.</p>
<p>By the
time Larson and Neelix carried Seven through the doors to sickbay she was
convulsing.</p>
<p>"Doctor!" Neelix yelled.</p>
<p>The hologram turned and
instantly hurried to them. "What happened?" he demanded. "This is not space
sickness."</p>
<p>"I don’t know," Neelix said as they put her onto a biobed.
Larson quickly left, not sure of what to say or do to help.</p>
<p>"I want
B’Elanna." Seven tried to sit up.</p>
<p>"Lay down," the Doctor snapped. "Hold
still and let me scan you."</p>
<p>"Easy," Neelix said as he took her hand and
patted it. "I’ll get B’Elanna in just a second. Let’s find out what’s wrong so
we know what to tell her."</p>
<p>"This can’t be," the Doctor said as he stared
at his tricorded.</p>
<p>"What?" Seven and Neelix demanded in unison.</p>
<p>"No
wonder the transporter could get a lock on you," the hologram said as he began
gathering equipment and piling it onto the empty bed next to Seven’s. The other
crewmembers had already left, their space sickness going away once the ship
stopped bouncing.</p>
<p>Seven screamed, and hugged her belly, the pain making
her see red and white sparks behind her closed eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it Doctor?"
Neelix asked.</p>
<p>"The fetus...it’s growing at a rate... it’s ... for every
second Seven experiences, the fetus is maturing the equivalent of 186.2
seconds." The Doctor hurried to a storage locker and removed a large
device.</p>
<p>"The planet, Jusari Prime," Seven said. "That is the exact
temporal differential."</p>
<p>"Well," the Doctor said, "apparently this fetus
misses Jusari Prime. It’s gone back to that temporal metabolism."</p>
<p>Neelix
let go of Seven’s hand long enough to tap his comm badge then reached down and
took her hand again. "Neelix to Lieutenant Torres," he said quietly, not wanting
to disturb the Doctor who already seemed quite disturbed.</p>
<p><I>*"What can I
do for you, Neelix?"*</I> B’Elanna asked.</p>
<p>"B’Elanna, you need to get to
sick bay, now." Neelix looked down at Seven. She still had her eyes tightly
closed, unable to do much more than hold her belly. "It’s Seven," Neelix
explained.</p>
<p><I>*"I’m on my way,"*</I> she said, her voice cracking.
<I>*"What’s wrong?"*</I></p>
<p>Seven chose that moment to sit straight up and
let out a blood curdling scream. Until that moment, Neelix hadn’t truly known
what that term meant.</p>
<p><I>*"Seven?"*</I> B’Elanna yelled over the comm
badge.</p>
<p>"Computer, deactivate comm signal," the Doctor ordered. "Neelix,
we don’t need Lieutenant Torres listening to this. She will be worried enough as
it. Now, get over here and help me." He was moving a large device next to the
bed. It was on rollers, and he had to retrieve it from a rarely used locker. He
had never used the device in his entire existence.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"
Seven asked as she fought to get a full breath. Her belly felt like it was
tearing in half, and each time she tried to speak, she felt like she was
suffocating because she had to stop panting.</p>
<p>"The fetus is maturing too
quickly." The Doctor plugged in the device. "The only reason it hasn’t
spontaneously aborted is because of the neonatal nanoprobes. The Borg technology
is protecting the fetus, expanding the womb nano-seconds before the fetus fills
the space."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Seven asked again.</p>
<p>"Seven," he
explained. "You won’t survive much longer under these conditions. I’m going to
abort the fetus." He patted her arm, and tried to look comforting.</p>
<p>"No,"
Seven said as she pushed his hands away. "You will not harm my child. I forbid
it."</p>
<p>"Seven, the fetus is drawing all of your energy and trying to rip
you in half. There’s no other choice." The Doctor went back to setting up the
machine.</p>
<p>"No," Seven ordered. "I am the patient and I refuse to undergo
any procedure that will harm my child." She was gasping between words, the
struggle to speak taxing what little energy she had left. "You cannot do this. I
refuse."</p>
<p>"Doctor, you can’t do this. She just told you not to," Neelix
said as he tried to grab the hologram’s arm. "It’s her right to choose… you
can’t do this against her wishes."</p>
<p>"She doesn’t know what she’s saying,"
the Doctor yelled. "I am the physician. She’ll thank me when this is over." He
shoved Neelix aside and grabbed a long tubular device from the rolling
table.</p>
<p>"Computer, deactivate Emergency Medical Hologram," Neelix ordered.
The hologram gave him an angry glare as he dematerialized.</p>
<p>"Lana," Seven
yelled. "Why isn’t she here?"</p>
<p>"She’s coming," Neelix said. He didn’t know
what to do, he wasn’t trained to treat more than a broken leg, but before he
could ponder that issue, the Doctor rematerialized.</p>
<p>"Mister Neelix, get
out of my sickbay." The hologram went back to the rolling table and grabbed the
device.</p>
<p>"No," Neelix said as he blocked the Doctor from Seven. The fur on
his face stood on end and the tuft of hair on his head seemed to fluff. "Stay
away from her."</p>
<p>The Doctor swatted the Talaxian away as if he were a fly,
using his superior strength to fling Neelix away. "Seven, this will only take a
second. Hold very still," he said as he moved closer. "Trust me, this is for the
best."</P>
