<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 45: Getting into the routine -->

<P>Day one: 11:06</P>B’Elanna was in her quarters, sitting on the edge of the
bed holding Kayla. Seven was sleeping beside her, stretched out under the fur
comforter.
<P></P>
<P>"Shh, little one. Let your mama sleep," B’Elanna whispered and kissed her
daughter’s forehead. Kayla was kicking her feet and squirming, ready to eat
again. Nara had walked B’Elanna through the first feeding, but now the Narian
was gone and B’Elanna was trying it on her own.</P>
<P>Kayla frowned, sucked on her fist, and kicked her feet even harder.</P>
<P>"I’m trying," B’Elanna whispered as she fought to unbutton her blouse without
putting the baby down. "Geeze, I’m leaking again and you’re not even crying."
B’Elanna watched as twin stains appeared on her blouse.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven sat up and moved behind her wife. </P>
<P>"Your daughter is an eating machine," B’Elanna said. Kayla began to whimper.
"I fed her less than two hours ago."</P>
<P>"Should I call Nara?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No." B’Elanna moved Kayla to the side. "I’m Chief Engineer… I think I can
feed my daughter. Nara showed me and it wasn’t that difficult."</P>
<P>"I want to help." Seven scooted behind B’Elanna. She put one leg on each side
of her wife and reached around her and helped support Kayla. </P>
<P>"Umm," B’Elanna moaned happily. "I like that," she said as Seven put her hand
over B’Elanna’s on Kayla’s back. </P>
<P>"She has your fingers." Seven rested her chin on B’Elanna’s shoulder and
studied their daughter. </P>
<P>"And your nose." B’Elanna freed her breast from the nursing bra and then
lifted Kayla to her. The baby nuzzled her breast, seeming to play with the
hardening nipple more than trying to eat. "She learned that from you," B’Elanna
added.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven tipped the baby’s head toward B’Elanna’s nipple. She latched
on and began suckling. "I never get distracted when I am near your breasts. You
are the one who cannot pay attention."</P>
<P>"You are very distracting, my Be’nal." B’Elanna leaned back against Seven and
sighed, then stared at Kayla. "Look." B’Elanna stared down, her voice full of
wonder.</P>
<P>"Our love made her," Seven said as she kissed B’Elanna neck.</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna whispered. She watched a while longer and then sighed. "This
is a piece of cake."</P>
<P>"I knew you could do it," Seven said. "I believe we have mastered
parenting."</P>
<P>"Yeah, no problem," B’Elanna said and then inhaled sharply. "I’m sure I’ll
get used to having a vacuum attached to my chest."</P>
<P>"It will be simple," Seven promised her.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Day two: 11:58.</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes, pausing before she stepped out of her regeneration
chamber. The small unit took up one corner of their cramped quarters, and Seven
had suggested that she go back to regenerating in the cargo bay. B’Elanna had
refused.</P>
<P>"Welcome back," B’Elanna said from the rocking chair across the room. She was
holding Kayla, and studying her wife.</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven smiled and went toward her family. "Did you sleep?"</P>
<P>"Talk to your daughter," B’Elanna said. "Every time I try to doze off she
decides to test those lungs of hers."</P>
<P>"Is she ill?" Seven knelt in front of B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"No, just Klingon." </P>
<P>Seven leaned down and kissed Kayla’s cheek. "I thought Klingon children do
not cry."</P>
<P>"Not according to what my mother told me." B’Elanna yawned. "They keep quiet
right after they’re born, but once they get to be a few hours old… look
out."</P>
<P>"Try to sleep." Seven stood and took the baby. "I will hold her."</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said as she stood. "I’m sure she’ll fall into a routine
soon."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna rolled over and looked at the clock. It was 02:06, and Kayla had
been crying since before 01:00. Seven was walking around their quarters trying
to soothe her, but nothing seemed to help.</P>
<P>"Maybe she’s hungry again," B’Elanna offered when Seven made a lap through
the bedroom. B’Elanna’s Klingon instincts were driving her insane. Her breasts
had filled three nursing pads and seemed to be leaking as much as if her
daughter was eating.</P>
<P>"She just ate," Seven said as she stopped and looked at B’Elanna’s wet
nightgown. She went to the nightstand and opened the top drawer. "Here," she
said as she shoved a breast pump at her wife.</P>
<P>B’Elanna grumbled. "No one told me I’d have to siphon off these squirting
wells attached to my chest."</P>
<P>"It will get easier." Seven paced into the living room.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Day three: 04:02</P>
<p>B’Elanna rolled over and looked at her daughter. Kayla was next to the
bed in a crib. She refused to nurse. She also refused to go to sleep. It was
04:02, almost morning, and the Klingon was exhausted. Every time she started to
doze off, Kayla would scream at the top of her lungs. It seemed that since the
tiny bundle was now outside of Seven’s womb, she wanted her growling Klingon
mother to entertain her. B’Elanna was not amused.</p>
<p>On the other side of
the bed, Seven was sleeping soundly. Now that she had didn’t have a kicking baby
inside anymore, she was curled up on her side and was snoring quite loudly. Even
when Kayla would sleep, B’Elanna couldn’t seem to drift off with the Borg
enhanced snooze that was rattling the entire bedroom. B’Elanna wondered if
beaming her wife onto the couch was grounds for divorce.</p>
<p>The previous
night Kayla had fallen asleep just after 03:00, but Seven had decided it was the
perfect opportunity to make love to B’Elanna. At the time it seemed like a great
idea to B’Elanna, but now, twenty some hours later... without any sleep... she
decided it was a plot on Seven’s part to kill her.</p>
<p>B’Elanna sighed
happily when Seven’s snoring finally stopped. A few moments later she watched as
Kayla’s eyes flickered shut. B’Elanna closed her own eyes just as she felt her
wife’s hand snake around her waist.</p>
<p>"She is asleep," Seven said as she
nuzzled B’Elanna’s earlobe. "Now we can find something else to do." Seven’s hand
moved up and cupped B’Elanna’s breast.</p>
<p>"Be’nal, I need sleep," B’Elanna
whined even as her body responded.</p>
<p>"It has been forever," Seven whispered
huskily. She rolled B’Elanna onto her back. "I miss you." She nuzzled B’Elanna’s
temple and kissed her ear.</p>
<p>"I have baby spit in my hair," B’Elanna
whined. "How can you possibly be aroused?"</p>
<p>"You always arouse me," Seven
said as she tried to straddle her wife.</p>
<p>"I need sleep," B’Elanna repeated
and she squirmed away from her wife. Seven seemed to have grown extra
hands...hands that were everywhere at once. The Klingon suddenly realized that
sleeping naked was not conducive to getting any sleep when Seven was
involved.</P>
<p>"I need you," Seven said as her hand made its way back to B’Elanna’s
chest.</p>
<p>"Be’nal..." B’Elanna whined, drawing out the word. "For the love
of Kahless...just let me sleep for one hour."</p>
<p>"I do not wish to force you
into anything unpleasant," Seven said as she eased away.</p>
<p>"I know it would
be very pleasant," B’Elanna said with a sigh. She rolled toward Seven and
studied her in the dimly lit room. Seven’s eyes were flickering with fire, a
fire that burned only for B’Elanna. "Unfortunately...if I don’t get some
sleep... I’m not gonna’ survive much longer."</p>
<p>"Are you ill?" Seven felt
B’Elanna’s forehead, leaning over to kiss her ridges for good
measure.</p>
<p>"No, just exhausted." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and tucked it
under her cheek. "My beloved... I didn’t get to regenerate this morning and wake
up freshly charged. That child of yours hasn’t let me sleep all day...or
night."</p>
<p>"I will comply," Seven said grouchily.</p>
<p>"I promise, it
won’t be too long," B’Elanna said as she snuggled closer, careful not to wake
Kayla.</p>
<p>"It has already been too long," Seven said with a sigh.</p>
<P>"Darling, what’s the hurry?" B’Elanna yawned and leaned over to check on
Kayla before turning back to Seven.</P>
<P>"Opaca said that as of today… four hours and three minutes ago… I can now
engage in <I>all</I> sexual activities," Seven said as she raised her eyebrows
to make the point. "Since two weeks before Kayla’s birth… you have been unable
to… go inside. That restriction is now lifted."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said as she watched her wife’s eyes sparkle. </P>
<P>Seven leaned over and began kissing B’Elanna’s ear. "I need to feel you
inside me, B’Elanna… to feel my body wrap around your fingers," she whispered,
her voice husky. </P>
<P>"Oh, god," B’Elanna moaned.</P>
<P>"It has been forever since I felt you inside my wetness," Seven continued as
she nibbled on B’Elanna’s ear.</P>
<P>"Seven, please… I am so tired," B’Elanna complained halfheartedly. She
reached over and caressed her wife’s breast. "I need to sleep," she whispered as
she began kissing Seven.</P>
<P>"You do not appear to want sleep," she pointed out, and then B’Elanna pulled
Seven on top of her. "I will do all of the work," Seven promised.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "When you do all the work…I end up feeling like an
overcooked noodle. I don’t think I could survive the ‘wow phenomenon’ right now,
love." She pulled Seven down to her lips and they shared a slow, lingering
kiss.</P>
<P>"All you have to do is love me," Seven whispered as she straddled B’Elanna’s
hips.</P>
<P>"Oh, is that all?" B’Elanna asked between kisses.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven promised. She kissed B’Elanna’s neck and guided her wife’s hand
between her legs. </P>
<P>"Oh, god," B’Elanna moaned as she felt her wife’s wetness cover her
fingertips. </P>
<P>"I have missed you." Seven began kissing down B’Elanna’s chest, gently biting
her full breasts. "I need to feel you, Be’nal." She moved her lips down and
nuzzled the hardening nipple.</P>
<P>"Oh… Sweet Kahless." B’Elanna sighed as she lifted her fingers inside of
Seven. The welcoming heat sent a charge of electricity to B’Elanna’s core.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said with a growl. She pressed down, making B’Elanna’s finger
move further inside her. "Yes, my Be’nal." She carefully bit down on the nipple
in front of her, then jerked back as milk squirted out and hit her in the eye.
"Ugh!"</P>
<P>"Oh geeze," B’Elanna said as Seven sat up. She felt milk running down her
chest, getting instantly sticky as it cooled.</P>
<P>"Do not move," Seven ordered and she gripped B’Elanna’s wrist. "Stay right
where you are." Her eyes locked with B’Elanna’s letting her know that taking her
fingers out was not an option. Seven carefully leaned over to the nightstand and
dug around the drawer. She moved back and kissed B’Elanna forcefully, making the
Klingon forget about the milk between their bodies. </P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna hissed as she heard and felt the breast pump latch onto her
chest. "What are you doing?" She pushed Seven off of her chest, but her fingers
were still pinned inside of her wife.</P>
<P>"Shh." Seven tried to kiss B’Elanna again.</P>
<P>"Oh no," B’Elanna said as she pulled out of Seven. "We are not mixing these
two activities. No way."</P>
<P>"But…" Seven’s eyes shot open as her body protested B’Elanna’s absence.</P>
<P>"No buts," B’Elanna said. "<I>This</I> is definitely mommy time," she said
pointing to the breast pump. "And <I>that</I> is definitely wife time," she
added as she pointed between her wife’s legs. "We are not mixing them. No… No
way. This ship doesn’t have a counselor, and I guarantee you if we mix these two
things…I will need a counselor."</P>
<P>Seven moved off of her wife and rested on one elbow as she watched the pump
sucking on the nipple she craved. She sighed as she held it in place, not quite
understanding B’Elanna’s protests, but preferring to honor the request. When the
pump stopped, she moved it to the other side and waited impatiently for it to
finish. After several minutes it stopped and she reached over and put the pump
aside and tucked the milk into a stasis container beside the bed. She rolled
over and kissed the back of B’Elanna neck.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and then began snoring…loudly.</P>
<P>Seven frowned and tried kissing her wife’s temple.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smacked her lips and whined, then rolled over toward Seven and
cuddled onto her chest… sound asleep.</P>
<P>Seven was not amused.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Day four: 09:30</P>
<P>"She is asleep. I moved the crib into the living room so that your snoring
will not wake her," Seven said as she crawled into bed.</P>
<P>"My snoring? Love, your snoring puts me to shame." B’Elanna rolled over and
hugged Seven. "Ouch." She pulled back. "Damn breasts."</P>
<P>"Do you need the pump?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No, I am not a dairy cow," B’Elanna said as she settled onto her back.</P>
<P>"I did not say that you were a bovine." Seven moved over to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I feel like a cow," she whined.</P>
<P>"Go to sleep." Seven kissed her temple and began rubbing the ridges on her
forehead.</P>
<P>"Sleep," B’Elanna whispered happily. She sighed and yawned just as the door
chime sounded. "No. Sweet Kahless, she just went to sleep."</P>
<P>Seven jumped out of bed and ran to the door wearing only her floor length
sapphire gown. She reached it before it rang again and opened the door and
stared at the captain.</P>
<P>"Seven, how are you feeling?" Kathryn asked. She was holding a brightly
colored package. </P>
<P>Seven stared at it. </P>
<P>"It’s a baby gift," Kathryn said as she looked at the dark rings under
Seven’s eyes.</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven took it. "However I do not believe Kayla can open it at
her present level of motor development."</P>
<P>"It’s really for you and B’Elanna," Kathryn said with a tolerant smile. She
wasn’t sure if Seven was joking or not.</P>
<P>"I am sure she will love it, Kathryn," Seven said with a smirk. "Would you
like to come in?"</P>
<P>"Thank you." Kathryn followed Seven into her living room and looked into the
crib at Kayla and smiled. "She’s so beautiful. She really is a little angel."
</P>
<P>"She is perfect." Seven stood next to Kathryn. "Although I do not think an
angel would deprive my wife of sleep the way she has."</P>
<P>"Is B’Elanna asleep right now?" Kathryn looked toward the closed bedroom
door.</P>
<P>"I hope she is…although it is doubtful." Seven smiled down at Kayla. "Our
daughter seems to enjoy waking B’Elanna up every one point nine hours and then
keeping her up for at least an hour at a time."</P>
<P>"Do you have any milk in bottles?" Kathryn asked as she studied the tiny
sleeping form. It was hard to imagine the adorable bundle causing any problems.
Kayla was sleeping with her fists tucked under her chin, her lips were pursed,
and she breathed deep and regular. </P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said slowly. "B’Elanna produces more milk than Kayla can
consume. We have saved the additional milk for future use."</P>
<P>"Well," Kathryn said with a half grin, "Why don’t you wrap up your little
darling…and take her out to mingle…and let B’Elanna sleep?"</P>
<P>"An excellent idea," Seven said. "However, I do think I should change."</P>
<P>"I think that’s a very good idea." Kathryn sighed and tried not to look at
Seven’s cleavage straining to get out of the silky fabric. She really didn’t
want to notice that Seven’s belly had returned almost to normal, her figure once
again sure to turn heads. Her Borg nanoprobes had performed a miracle again.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kayla was the hit of the mess hall. She had woken up as soon as Kathryn and
Seven arrived at the crowded room and began nuzzling Seven’s chest in time for
lunch. She took the bottle without a peep and delighted the crew with her gentle
disposition. She looked around the faces of the crowd, her eyes wide and
curious, and never cried once. Seven couldn’t convince anyone that Kayla spent
most nights crying for B’Elanna to hold her. After visiting with everyone
present, Kayla cuddled up on Neelix’s chest and went to sleep. The furry
Talaxian held her for almost an hour until he had to get ready for the next
lunch crowd. He grumbled as he handed her over to Samantha Wildman who swore
that Kayla was the most perfect child she had ever seen, after Naomi.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Naomi joined them after her studies just as Kayla woke up. Kayla opened her
eyes and peered happily around without even a whine or grunt. She spent the next
hour being carried around the room by Naomi who saw her as her personal doll.
Kayla quietly allowed Naomi to oversee three changes of clothing. Naomi would
pick out an outfit and ask Seven to put it on her. They finally decided on the
dark green jumper that the captain had brought as a gift. It picked up the red
highlights in Kayla’s hair and showed off the dark, rich coloring she got from
B’Elanna. It was a happy time for Seven, but she missed B’Elanna. She consoled
herself with the thought that her wife was getting some much-needed rest.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After the long visit, Seven asked Kathryn to go with her and Kayla to the
Tach’s orchard. The captain accepted, happy to spend some of her off time with
her dear friend. Seven enjoyed the walk in silence, staring down at her daughter
in her arms. Once there, Seven revealed her reason for asking Kathryn along.</P>
<P>"How long were you involved with Mark?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"What?" Kathryn asked, somewhat shocked. She stopped in front of a blossoming
apple tree and turned. "Why?"</P>
<P>Seven carefully arranged a blanket on the sweet smelling grass and put Kayla
down to enjoy the fresh air. She stood, and sighed before turning to face her
friend.</P>
<P>"What is it, Seven?" Kathryn moved closer.</P>
<P>"I believe…that B’Elanna has lost interest in me…sexually." Seven studied the
grass at her feet.</P>
<P>"I find that hard to believe," Kathryn said gently. "I’ve never seen anyone
more in love than she is with you," Kathryn said honestly. "What would make you
think that she’s losing interest?"</P>
<P>"It has been…an eternity since we last… made love," Seven said. Her voice was
full of sorrow. "For the first time in our relationship…she is not…we do not…"
Seven sighed and turned away.</P>
<P>Kathryn stared at her lanky friend’s back. Seven was incredibly sexy from any
angle. She wondered exactly how long an "eternity" was to a Borg. "Seven,
how...umm...long has it been?"</P>
<P>Seven took a shuddering breath before speaking. "We have not made love in
thirty-one…" She took another breath and then bit her lip before continuing.
"Thirty-one hours."</P>
<P>Kathryn stared at Seven, her mouth refusing to work as she thought of her own
<I>years</I> of celibacy. Finally Kathryn found her voice. "Seven, call me when
it’s been thirty-one months," Kathryn said with a shake of her head.</P>
<P>"Months?" Seven asked, mortified. "Is it possible to survive that long?"</P>
<P>"I assure you, it is." Kathryn laughed and sat next to Kayla and studied the
sleeping child. "You went for a long time before you and B’Elanna, umm, got
together."</P>
<P>"As the saying goes, I did not know what I was missing," Seven said as she
sat next to Kathryn. "It is not a physical matter of sexuality," Seven
explained. "My love for B’Elanna…transcends everything. It is more than
physical. My love for her is so…complete that it spills over into the physical
plane. I cannot do anything other than love her. I literally hurt if I do not
touch her." </P>
<P>"Well, it won’t kill you. Although you may think it will," Kathryn said.
"Besides, she’s probably just adjusting to motherhood."</P>
<P>"Will our intimacy always be hindered?" Seven asked. Her face showed her fear
and disgust. "Why didn’t anyone tell me this?"</P>
<P>"Seven, calm down. Chances are, everything will return to normal as soon as
she gets used to things," Kathryn said delicately. "Besides, you said that she
hasn’t been sleeping. That is bound to effect her…umm… appetite."</P>
<P>"We have gone without sleep in the past and it has never lessened her
appetite for me," Seven whined.</P>
<P>"Give it time," Kathryn advised. She shook her head and tried not to laugh at
her friend’s misery, but the willowy blonde really needed a reality check.
Kathryn hadn’t been as sexually active with any of her partners as Seven and
B’Elanna appeared to be with each other. Poor B’Elanna probably needed every bit
of Klingon stamina to keep up with Seven’s Borg…resilience.</P>
<P>Seven stretched out next to Kayla, smiling as she watched her child yawn.
Kathryn looked on, amazed at the transformation. The former Borg looked as human
as any member of the crew, her eyes were shining and the edges of her lips were
curling up.</P>
<P>"It is worth it," Seven said as she touched Kayla’s cheek. "As much as I will
miss making love several times a day…she is worth any sacrifice."</P>
<P>"Seven, quit pouting. Let your wife get some rest and deal with it." Kathryn
picked up one of the small towels from the diaper bag and tossed it as Seven.
"You have a gorgeous wife, a wonderful daughter and a more active sex life than
ninety-nine percent of this crew. So quit rubbing it in everyone’s faces."</P>
<P>"I do not care what most people do or do not do," Seven stated as she pulled
the towel off of her face. "I only care what has changed between my wife and I.
Everything and everyone else is… irrelevant."</P>
<P>"That’s a good answer," Kathryn said with a smirk. "I think it will be fine
as soon as B’Elanna gets over the shock of being a mother."</P>
<P>"Really?" Seven asked hopefully.</P>
<P>"Yes, really." Kathryn stretched out on her back and laughed. "Thirty-one
hours… my god, Seven… You really have no idea how lucky you are." She smiled as
she closed her eyes and tried to picture B’Elanna’s reaction to the conversation
she was having with Seven. "Thirty-one hours," Kathryn whispered again as she
covered her face with her arms. "Good lord."</P>
