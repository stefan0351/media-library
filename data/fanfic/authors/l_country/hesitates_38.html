<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 38: Aftermath -->

<P>As the door to her ready room closed, Kathryn heard a desperate, guttural
scream coming from inside and recognized it as the Klingon death howl. She
leaned against the wall and rubbed her temples. She stayed there, ignoring the
concerned looks from the rest of the crew as she wondered how she was going to
help her young friend through her loss. She listened and she heard loud crashes,
identifying a few of the sounds. One was definitely her desk being overturned,
another she assumed was her Da Vinci bust hitting the wall. The crashing ended
after a few minutes and she heard strange noises that reminded her of the
shipyards at Utopia Planitia. It sounded like metal being bent and shaped, but
she dismissed that because it simply wasn’t possible, then the crashing
continued.</P>
<P>"Captain," Chakotay said as he came over to her. "How is she?"</P>
<P>A loud ripping noise followed by a thud came from behind the door.</P>
<P>"How do you think she is?" Janeway asked. They both listened until the sounds
died down.</P>
<P>"I spoke with Nara," he said quietly.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"She’s in the new orchard with Ty, looking at the trees Tach planted."
Chakotay nodded toward the silent ready room. "Are you sure you should have left
her alone?"</P>
<P>"She’s a very private person," Kathryn said sadly. "She needed to go
through…that…alone," she added. "She’s letting off some steam, and I don’t think
she’d do that with an audience."</P>
<P>"It doesn’t sound like you’ll have a ready room when this is over." He put
his hand on Kathryn’s shoulder. "Don’t leave her in there too long."</P>
<P>Kathryn nodded. "Her ten minutes are up right now. Why don’t you get back to
my bridge."</P>
<P>"Aye Captain." He squeezed her shoulder. "Good luck."</P>
<P>"I’ll need it." She turned and entered her ready room. "Oh my," she said as
she spun and closed the door and sealed it with her personal privacy code. </P>
<P>She turned back around and saw Seven sitting in the middle of the wreckage of
what had once been Janeway’s private sanctuary. It looked like a tornado had
been through the room…twice. Everything in the room was shattered or ripped to
shreds, most notably was the couch. It was reduced to a fluffy ocean of padding
covering the floor and a few scattered piles of metal that had been its frame.
The desk was broken in half, one piece having been hurled onto the upper deck
and crushed against the wall. The other half of the desk sat at its normal
location, looking like half of it had beamed off of the ship and the remaining
piece had simply fallen over. Kathryn moved closer to the center of the debris,
trying to look at Seven’s face, but all she could see was the former Borg’s back
as she hunched over in the mess.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Kathryn asked gently, but the young blonde didn’t even flinch.
Kathryn moved closer and knelt beside her. She was covered in dust and had
pieces of the couch stuffing stuck in her hair but Kathryn’s eyes focused on her
hands. Seven was cradling Kathryn’s lucky teacup, holding it reverently. Even in
her rage she hadn’t been able to destroy something so precious to the
captain.</P>
<P>"Your cup," Seven whispered as she turned. Her eyes were swollen from crying
and she was pale. "I seem to have damaged your ready room…however…I could not
break your ‘lucky tea cup.’ Please take it."</P>
<P>Kathryn took the cup and held it in one hand while she rested the other hand
on Seven’s shoulder. "I’m so sorry," she whispered. It occurred to her that
Seven was far more fragile than the porcelain cup, and she wished it were the
cup that was shattered and not her dear friend’s heart.</P>
<P>Seven turned and looked at the teacup in Janeway’s hand. "Where was my luck
today?" she asked in a tiny voice that sounded more like a child than the strong
woman Janeway had come to know.</P>
<P>The words hit Kathryn like a fist and she stood and hurled the teacup into
the wall. She paced and rubbed her eyes as she felt tears hot on her cheeks.
Kathryn sighed and then wiped her eyes one last time and went back to Seven and
sat beside her in the debris.</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"There is no reason." Janeway took Seven’s hand and patted her comfortingly.
She had to shift her legs to make a soft spot on top of the scattered mess.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at her belly and then rested her hand on it. "B’Elanna
loved our daughter," she said quietly. "She would look at my belly with such
love and devotion. She would talk to the baby, tell her stories…" Seven looked
at Kathryn, her lower lip trembling. "Our daughter will never see that love,
never see the love Lana had in her eyes."</P>
<P>"Then we’ll tell her," Kathryn said. "Everyday."</P>
<P>"That is…insufficient." Seven closed her eyes tightly and drew in a shaking
breath and then collapsed onto Kathryn. She began taking gulps of air as the
tears fell uncontrolled. Kathryn lowered Seven into her lap and gently stroked
her blonde hair. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven cried for hours, and Kathryn held her, murmuring comforting words that
did more for Kathryn than Seven. The former drone was beyond any words and she
let her pain pour from her eyes in salty streams. Finally, Seven dozed off, her
face still resting on Kathryn’s lap and the older woman stared down at her.
Kathryn had no idea how to help. She wished that there was some way to bring
B’Elanna back, but she knew that miracles were scarce, especially in the Delta
Quadrant. Seven was restless, mumbling in her sleep and shifting her weight
often. Kathryn eased out from under her and walked a few steps away before
tapping her comm badge.</P>
<P>"Janeway to sickbay, I need Opaca in my ready room, now," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor answered. He was insulted and his tone made it evident.
"It’s one thing to create a holographic midwife, but now you want her to use my
emitter? What’s next, is she going on away missions?"</P>
<P>"Send Opaca to my ready room, now," Janeway said again. Her tone made it
clear it wasn’t up for debate.</P>
<P>"Fine," the Doctor responded as the channel went dead.</P>
<P>Opaca materialized, looking somewhat disoriented, but she took one look at
the room and Seven and hurried toward her. </P>
<P>"Shh," Janeway whispered. "She just went to sleep. Could you scan her…make
sure she’s okay?"</P>
<P>"I’ll scan her," Opaca said sadly. "But I doubt she’ll be okay. Not for a
very long time." She moved forward, careful not to awaken Seven, and scanned
her. After a moment she moved away, taking Janeway by the arm and not speaking
until they were well away from Seven. "Physically she’s fine. I would like her
to eat something, and if that’s not possible, maybe you can get her to
regenerate, but I wouldn’t hold my breath on that one."</P>
<P>"Why?" Kathryn whispered.</P>
<P>"I happen to know that B’Elanna always sat with her when she regenerated…ever
since they were on Jusari Prime," Opaca explained. "Seven told me she loves that
time together. She is unconscious, but has an innate sense of B’Elanna’s
presence…watching over her. She told me that it makes her feel completely
cherished. I don’t think she’ll be too eager to regenerate alone."</P>
<P>"I see," Kathryn said quietly. She looked at Opaca, surprised to see her
holographic eyes darkened with grief. Opaca was full of surprises, and Kathryn
found her extremely easy to talk as if they had known each other for years.
"Maybe you can talk to her when she feels up to it. You’re very good with
her."</P>
<P>"I care a great deal for her. She’s grown so much since she was rescued from
the Borg," Opaca said sadly. "I hate seeing her go through this."</P><I>
<P>*"Chakotay to Janeway,"*</I> the commander said.</P>
<P>"Janeway here," Kathryn whispered. She looked over and saw Seven stir and
then settle back onto the hard deck. "What is it, Commander?"</P><I>
<P>*"I just spoke with the Stellar Guard, and…well…I think you’d better look at
what they told us. I routed the information to your console, but it won’t go
through."*</P></I>
<P>Kathryn looked at the wall where the information feed for her desk console
used to be. The conduit had been ripped from the wall. She vaguely remembered
seeing part of it on the upper deck under the window.</P>
<P>"Bring me the information on a data padd," Kathryn said quietly. "And bring
it yourself, Commander. No one else is to enter my ready room."</P><I>
<P>*"Understood, Chakotay out."*</P></I>
<P>"What now?" Kathryn shook her head. She looked over at Seven; she was
mumbling louder and Kathryn went to her, carefully gathering her up onto her
lap. Seven gripped her legs and whimpered.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered in her sleep. Her voice was so full of love that
Kathryn thought her own heart would break.</P>
<P>The door chimed and Kathryn ordered the computer to release the lock.
Chakotay took one look at the destruction and stopped, stunned by the amount of
damage Seven had done in the ten minutes Janeway had left her alone. He
carefully walked over to Kathryn and gave her the data padd, trying not to look
at Seven resting in the captain’s lap.</P>
<P>"Check this out immediately." Janeway nodded at the padd. "But keep it under
wraps. There’s no reason to get anyone’s hopes up."</P>
<P>"I’m already on it," he said as he made his way out of the debris field.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Opaca asked.</P>
<P>"Maybe a miracle." Kathryn reread the padd. It was a detailed report from the
Stellar Guard. </P>
<P>"Then may the prophets guide you," Opaca said as she tilted her head to one
side.</P>
<P>The data padd explained what Chakotay had discovered when he spoke with the
Narians. Chakotay had explained that the station had been lost and the Narians
had asked if the team had beamed onto <I>Voyager</I> or used standard escape
protocol. Chakotay asked what they meant, and they explained. It was normal for
Narians to be in dangerous meteor storms and they had developed strategies just
for them. Since their system of targeting meteors was similar to the one Seven
had designed, they knew which meteors would miss the planet completely. Those
meteors were not shot down until the Stellar Guard had extra time. Because of
that, the larger meteors that were not a threat became emergency beam out
sights. In the event of a meteor strike, a crew could beam onto the meteor and
wait for rescue. <I>Voyager</I> had not scanned any of the meteors that had
continued past the destroyed station. Kathryn hoped that Tach was well versed in
the method described on the padd. <I>Voyager</I> had been too far away for a
beam out, but there had been dozens of meteors close enough for Tach’s
transporter to reach.</P>
<P>"What miracle are you talking about?" Seven asked as she sat up. She grabbed
the data padd and scanned it.</P>
<P>"I thought you were asleep," Kathryn said with a half smile.</P>
<P>"I was…but I awakened when the commander left you this," Seven accused as she
waved the padd at the captain. "Why was I not informed immediately? We must
begin a search at once."</P>
<P>"Seven, this a long shot. The station was depressurized, and they didn’t have
time to reach the transporters." Kathryn tried to take the padd, but Seven
pulled it to her chest like a life preserver.</P>
<P>"She is alive," Seven yelled angrily as she stood up. "I should not have
given up on her so quickly. It is my humanity that makes me so…weak as to accept
her death."</P>
<P>"You’re wrong." Kathryn stood and tried to take Seven by the arm but she
pulled away and gave the captain an icy glare. "Seven, it’s your humanity that’s
making you instantly believe this right now. It’s called hope…and since it’s new
to you…I don’t want to see you hurt by it."</P>
<P>"How could I be hurt by knowing my wife is alive?" Seven picked up a piece of
the broken teacup and cradled it in her Borg enhanced left hand. Her right hand
still clutched the data padd. </P>
<P>"Seven, all I’m saying is that you shouldn’t assume we’re going to find
them." Kathryn edged closer. She could see Seven’s hands trembling. "I want them
to be all right. God, I want it more than anything," Kathryn said. She had loved
Seven deeply and wanted a life with her, but she knew the former Borg belonged
with B’Elanna. "Seven, I’m just saying let’s go into this hopefully, but not
blindly."</P>
<P>"She is alive," Seven whispered. She held out the shard of broken porcelain
to Kathryn. "This is me without my Be’nal. Broken, unable to do that which I was
designed for… and like this, I could be mended…but the fractures would always be
there. Without B’Elanna, my life is incomplete."</P>
<P>"I know it feels that way, but you are a strong and independent woman. You
don’t need anyone to be complete," Kathryn said as she bent down to look into
Seven’s downcast eyes.</P>
<P>"You are wrong," Seven said. Her voice was bleak and desperate. "B’Elanna
holds my heart. I gave it to her, and while I will go on and function for our
daughter’s sake… I will never be whole again until I meet my Be’nal in Stovocor.
I cannot get back my heart, she carries it with her wherever she goes."</P>
<P>Kathryn smiled sadly. "When did you become such a poet, my friend?"</P>
<P>"The day B’Elanna and I fell in love."</P>
<P>"I’m worried about you." Kathryn rested her hand on Seven’s shoulder.
"Please, don’t let yourself believe this…only to be shattered if it isn’t
true."</P>
<P>"I know she is alive, Kathryn. I just didn’t listen to what my soul was
telling me." Seven turned and smiled at Kathryn. "She is alive."</P>
<P>Opaca came over to them and paused before reaching out and touching Seven on
the elbow. "Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven looked down at the short hologram.</P>
<P>"How do you know she is alive?" Opaca asked.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and she clutched the broken porcelain to her chest. "Because my
heart still beats. If Lana were … gone… it would not."</P>
<P>Kathryn sighed. "Well, I can’t argue with that logic. Will you wait in here
while I check with Chakotay?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"I have the right to help look for my wife," Seven said. "Besides, I am the
only one who believes she is alive, so I will look more diligently."</P>
<P>"All right," Kathryn said. "Let’s go."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Janeway entered the bridge with Seven at her side. Opaca had beamed back to
sickbay. The Captain took over the bridge and sat in her chair and Seven went
immediately to the auxiliary science station and began trying to find the
meteors that had been closest to the station when it exploded. She was surprised
to see that Harry Kim had already marked four possible targets. </P>
<P>"Coming up the third target," Ensign Kim said.</P>
<P>"Third?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"We already checked two of them," Chakotay said.</P>
<P>"Good thinking," Janeway said quietly. "How much air do they have?" She was
considering them alive until they had proof, something she realized she should
have done earlier. It just seemed so impossible that they could have survived
the impact.</P>
<P>"Narian emergency suits are designed for longer periods of exposure," Tuvok
said. "They employ concentrated liquid oxygen canisters. They should have almost
twelve hours left."</P>
<P>"That’s fine if you don’t mind having a bomb strapped to your back," Paris
said from the helm. "Guess they didn’t have a spaceshuttle <I>Challenger</I> in
their history."</P>
<P>"That’s enough, Ensign," Janeway said. She didn’t like him making jokes about
B’Elanna or the group of space travelers Earth had lost early in its
history.</P>
<P>"This meteor has no life signs," Seven said. "We should move on to the forth
target."</P>
<P>"Narian ship approaching, Captain," Harry said.</P>
<P>"On screen." Janeway stood as she looked at a Narian captain with reddish
hair and big brown eyes. His browridge was thick and his eyebrows met in the
middle. He looked like the Irish Setter Kathryn had left back in the Alpha
Quadrant. </P>
<P>"<I>Voyager</I>," he said as he leaned forward in his chair. "I am Captain
Jakdar. We have been searching the meteors for your missing crew."</P>
<P>"Yes?" Janeway sent out a prayer to the universe.</P>
<P>"Target 16," he said as rubbed his chin. "We recovered two bodies, one
Narian…one Klingon as you described. We will beam them over immediately."</P>
<P>Kathryn sat and gripped the arms of her chair. </P>
<P>"Captain!" Harry Kim yelled.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes rolled back into her head and she hit the deck plating in a
crumpled pile. Janeway felt her own heart ache at the thought of Seven going
through the agony again. Tuvok and Harry reached Seven and checked her for
injuries.</P>
<P>"Thank you, for your assistance," Janeway said grimly as she turned back to
the screen. "We’ll send you the coordinates to our morgue."</P>
<P>"Morgue?" Jakdar asked. "Why? They are in our transporter room ready to come
home."</P>
<P>"You said bodies…" Janeway said slowly. </P>
<P>"Yes, two healthy bodies. And the female is rather… insistent. She has quite
a temper." He smiled at Janeway wondering why she seemed upset.</P>
<P>"They’re alive?" Tom asked happily.</P>
<P>"Of course," Jakdar said.</P>
<P>"In our language, we refer to people as…bodies…only when they are deceased,"
Kathryn said as she looked back at Seven. The willowy former drone was still out
cold.</P>
<P>"My apologies," Jakdar said. His browridge blushed deep crimson. "Our
deceased are called shells."</P>
<P>"Please beam them directly to the bridge," Janeway said. "Drop the
shields."</P>
<P>There was a brief delay and then Tach and B’Elanna appeared on the bridge in
front of the helm and looked around. They had their helmets tucked under their
arms and were covered in sweat and grime, but both had weary smiles on their
faces.</P>
<P>"Oh, sweet Kahless, am I glad to see you," B’Elanna said with a sigh.</P>
<P>"So am I." Tach tossed his helmet onto the floor, not caring where it rolled.
"Nana B’Elanna is driving me crazy."</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said from the tactical station where he was kneeling next to
Seven. "Perhaps Lieutenant Torres could assist me?" Harry was beside him, the
men blocking Seven from view.</P>
<P>"I just got back," B’Elanna whined. "Honestly, I just need a hot shower and a
chance to see my wife. Is that too much to ask?"</P>
<P>Harry stood and stepped out of the way as Seven tried to sit up. Her
expression was dazed and her eyelids fluttered.</P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna dropped her helmet and sprinted to her wife. She pushed
Tuvok out of the way and held the bewildered blonde in her arms. "What
happened?"</P>
<P>"Be’nal?" Seven’s eyes shot open. "You are alive." She yanked B’Elanna to her
and they fell onto the floor in a heap. "The Narians said you were dead." Seven
rolled over, pinning B’Elanna to the deck in a very intimate position. "They
said they had your bodies." Seven gently touched B’Elanna’s cheek, making sure
she was real.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Tach said, drawing the word out. "They had our bodies…and here we
are."</P>
<P>Tuvok cleared his throat. </P>
<P>Seven looked up and glared at him and then she turned back to B’Elanna and
kissed her without restraint.</P>
<P>The Vulcan cleared his throat again, wishing he had a firehose.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna said when Seven let her come up for air. </P>
<P>"You are in serious trouble," Seven said as she stood. She pulled B’Elanna up
to her and wrapped her arms around her. "You are forbidden from repairing any
stations during meteor storms."</P>
<P>"Ladies?" Janeway crossed her arms over her chest. "Why don’t you take this
off of my bridge?"</P>
<P>"Oh, ma’am," B’Elanna said as her face turned deep red. "Yes, ma’am."</P>
<P>"Tach," Chakotay said. "I think you’d better let Nara know that you’re all
right. You were both reported dead."</P>
<P>"Great goddess, where is she?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"In the orchard," Chakotay said. "With Ty."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, Seven, why don’t you go with him," Janeway said.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." B’Elanna moved toward the door and tugged Seven with her.
B’Elanna could still feel the blush burning her cheeks as she climbed into the
turbolift.</P>
<P>They rode in silence, and Seven held B’Elanna in her arms, squeezing so
tightly that the Klingon actually squeaked once. She looked up at Seven, who
loosened her grip and then kissed B’Elanna’s temple. The turbolift stopped and
Tach hurried out, but Seven wasn’t willing to let go of her wife. </P>
<P>"Are you all right, Lana? Were you injured?" Seven ran her hands over the
fabric of the exposure suit.</P>
<P>"I’m fine." B’Elanna pulled Seven out of the lift. "A few bumps and bruises,
maybe a little frostbite," she joked. "You have no idea how cold that meteor
was."</P>
<P>"Where?" Seven grabbed B’Elanna’s exposure suit by the metal ring that was
used to anchor the helmet into place. She snapped it in half and then shredded
the suit down the front and tossed the pieces onto the floor.</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna was suddenly feeling a chill as her sweat covered arms were
exposed to the cool air. She had been wearing only her uniform pants and a tank
top under the exposure suit, and while it had been cold on the meteor, the suit
was extremely hot on board the ship. Now she was covered in sweat and
<I>Voyager’s</I> climate controlled air felt cold against her arms.</P>
<P>"Where are you injured?" Seven demanded as she grabbed B’Elanna’s tank top,
about to give it the same fate as the exposure suit.</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said as she held Seven’s wrists. "Hey, take it easy,
love."</P>
<P>"I thought you were dead," Seven said in a whisper. She eased out of
B’Elanna’s grip and moved her hands up to cup B’Elanna’s face. "You are my life…
and I knew that I had to continue on for our daughter. It hurt so badly. How
could I have taught our child to love life when all I wanted to do was join
you?"</P>
<P>"I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere." B’Elanna put her hands over Seven’s,
holding them to her skin. "I will be here with you, for you… and we will raise
our daughter to treasure every moment…just like we do."</P>
<P>Seven pulled B’Elanna to her chest and clung to her. "I do treasure our
life," Seven said. "And you." Seven felt tears on her cheeks and was surprised.
She eased back and wiped them away. "I thought I had cried as much as physically
possible." She stared at her wet fingers.</P>
<P>"I’m so sorry, Be’nal," B’Elanna said as she took Seven’s hand and kissed the
tears from her fingertips. "From now on, you’ll only have tears of joy."</P>
<P>"I wish that could be true." Seven leaned against the wall. She was
exhausted, and her back hurt. "But we live dangerous lives."</P>
<P>"I hate to think of you crying all alone," B’Elanna said as she leaned
against Seven’s chest. She loved the way their bodies molded together.</P>
<P>"Kathryn was with me," Seven said. She smiled, enjoying the familiar weight
of B’Elanna in her arms.</P>
<P>"I’m so glad," B’Elanna replied. "She really is a good friend." B’Elanna
snuggled into Seven, not caring that anyone could walk by at any moment.</P>
<P>The turbolift opened and the friend in question came out. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I just wanted to check on you and Tach. I think you two should go
to sickbay," Kathryn said. She smiled at the look of contentment on Seven’s
face. She knew without a doubt that the former Borg belonged in B’Elanna’s arms
and she’d do everything in her power to help them with any bumps that might be
in the road ahead.</P>
<P>"Captain, I’m fine," B’Elanna said into Seven’s chest. Her lanky wife
wouldn’t let her pull away enough to turn her head.</P>
<P>"She will go to sickbay," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Good." Kathryn looked down at the tatters of the exposure suit. "That looks
familiar," she said with smile.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, I will repair your ready room." Seven shifted B’Elanna to one side
but still had her trapped in her grip. "I was not… I am… I… I was upset."</P>
<P>"I know." Kathryn smiled warmly. "Just remind me to never get you upset at
me. If you did that to my ready room…and you weren’t even mad at me, I shudder
to think what would happen if I ever got you angry."</P>
<P>"I would never harm you," Seven said sincerely.</P>
<P>"I know that," Kathryn assured her.</P>
<P>"What are we talking about?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I was…upset when I thought you were…gone," Seven explained. "I damaged the
ready room…severely."</P>
<P>"It’s nothing that can’t be replaced." Kathryn rested her hand on Seven’s
arm. "Although you will be doing the repairs yourself… and since your wife did
upset you, she can help."</P>
<P>"Of course, Kathryn." B’Elanna smiled warmly. "How bad can it be?"</P>
<P>"How bad, indeed?" Kathryn raised both eyebrows and an evil grin covered her
elegant features. </P>
<P>"The damage is considerable," Seven said. "I was despondent, but I felt much
better after I slept with Kathryn." </P>
<P>"B’Elanna…" Kathryn stuttered as her eyes widened and she shook her head in a
most inelegant manor. </P>
<P>B’Elanna rolled her eyes and smiled. "How long were you able to sleep,
Be’nal?" She leaned over and kissed Seven’s cheek. She knew Seven must have been
speaking in precise terms because her wife was incapable of breaking their
vows.</P>
<P>"I am uncertain…." Seven said. "I lost track of time. Kathryn, how long was I
asleep?"</P>
<P>"Uh… less than an hour." Kathryn felt her cheeks warm and knew she was
blushing.</P>
<P>"Kathryn," B’Elanna said with sincere affection. "I know you would never take
advantage of anyone, and I know Seven wouldn’t make love to anyone else."</P>
<P>"Make love?" Seven asked. "Oh, the euphemism for sex. Of course I did not
‘sleep with’ Kathryn. I slept while she comforted me."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Kathryn, for being with Seven." B’Elanna sighed. "I’m glad she
didn’t have to go through this alone. You’re a good friend… to us both."</P>
<P>Kathryn almost said that she was just doing her job, but realized how untrue
that would have been. "You two are my friends," she finally managed to say. "And
we Janeways don’t take that lightly."</P>
<P>"Neither do we Torres’," Seven said with a smile. She saw the surprised looks
from B’Elanna and Kathryn and tilted her head to the side. "Well, I am your
wife. Am I not a Torres? Or would you rather be B’Elanna of Nine? I know we will
keep our own names for professional uses… our maiden names… but I would like the
ship’s records to reflect our union."</P>
<P>"I would be honored if you took my name, my wife." B’Elanna felt a lump in
her throat.</P>
<P>"Seven Torres? That’s nice, but…" Janeway said with a wry grin. "I kind of
like B’Elanna of Nine."</P>
