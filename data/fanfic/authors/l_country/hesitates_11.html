<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Eleven: Answered Prayers -->

<P>Nara stood in the doorway of the kitchen and cleared her throat. B’Elanna
jerked her head around, startled. She had been sitting at the table removing the
hulls from some small nuts while Seven stood in the corner regenerating near the
cooking hearth.</P>
<P>"Need something?" B’Elanna asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Can she hear us?" Nara asked as she studied Seven.</P>
<P>"She’s aware of my presence, I don’t know about you." B’Elanna stood and
moved over to the door, blocking Nara’s view. "Look, I’m not real comfortable
with anyone hanging around looking at her while she’s regenerating…"</P>
<P>"I didn’t mean to intrude," Nara said sincerely. "I was just concerned. Is
she all right?"</P>
<P>"She’s fine," B’Elanna said quietly. "I didn’t mean to bite your head off,
it’s just that, well…"</P>
<P>"You worry about her," Nara said with a smile. "As it should be. I’ll tell
Tach to stay out of the kitchen whenever she’s…uh… regenerating. How long does
it take?"</P>
<P>"About two hours, sometimes more if I don’t keep after her to eat right."
B’Elanna walked into the main room with Nara, but continually looked over her
shoulder. She wasn’t used to having Seven out of her site when she was so
unprotected. </P>
<P>Nara shook her head and smiled. "Go back to her. I’ll just be looking over
the skins you’ve gathered so I can start showing Seven how to make those shirts
fit a little better."</P>
<P>"Thank you," B’Elanna said. She went back the kitchen and continued cracking
open the nuts. It was a time consuming task made more difficult by the fact that
the Klingon constantly caught herself staring at her wife and wondering what she
did to deserve the beautiful woman.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tach closed the door to the smoking shed and washed his hands in a nearby
bucket. He turned when he heard footsteps. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna," he said. "I finished hanging that meat. Those cattle of yours are
a little bigger than I’m used to." He smiled shook the water from his hands.</P>
<P>"You’re done?" B’Elanna asked. "It usually takes me until evening to prepare
it for drying."</P>
<P>"You took that animal down like a first class hunter, but thirty five years
of experience butchering cattle gives me an advantage in there." He pointed to
the spears on the ground. "Those’ll work, obviously, but I think I can rig up a
crossbow if you’re interested."</P>
<P>"I like the way you think." Her smile widened. </P>
<P>"I took the liberty of having a good look at the storage area this morning.
Might be nice to set up a cold room, maybe somewhere we could hang a few sides
of meat." He fidgeted with a stick from the ground. "Don’t mean to be
presumptuous."</P>
<P>"Not at all," B’Elanna assured him. "We thought of that too, but we haven’t
found anyway to rig it."</P>
<P>"Well, if we built an insulated building a little bigger than the smoke shed,
couldn’t we use some of the coolant from the shuttle and some tubing? Don’t all
thrusters need coolant?" he asked.</P>
<P>"For a farmer, that’s pretty good thinking. Unfortunately, we checked into
that, and there isn’t enough coolant or tubing to rig it." B’Elanna sighed,
thinking how nice it would be to have fresh steaks instead of just jerky and
rabbit.</P>
<P>"Even with our shuttle?" he asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stopped in her tracks, her mind calculating tubing and coolant
requirements per square foot of the area to be refrigerated. She was in full
engineer mode and it felt good. </P>
<P>"I’m gonna’ enjoy having you around, Tach." She pulled him to a stop and
looked into his pale brown eyes. He might look like a Neanderthal, but he was a
godsend. "Ya’ know, right before you two got here, Seven and I were asking for a
tailor and plumber. Looks like he sent me an engineer too."</P>
<P>"Asking who?"</P>
<P>"Kahless." Torres laughed. "I don’t believe much in prayer, but it seems like
he heard me."</P>
<P>"Have you paid tribute?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Uh, no."</P>
<P>"Well, you must. Won’t you incur this Kahless’ wrath?" Tach seemed extremely
concerned, looking around as if Kahless would jump out of a tree and strike them
both dead on the spot. "What is the expected offering for such a gift?"</P>
<P>"Um, well, I was joking about going to the sweat caves for a day… we were
just kidding." Now Torres looked around, expecting to her wife jump out of a
tree and strike her dead for getting trapped in the current conversation.
"Besides, we don’t have sweat caves here," she tried.</P>
<P>"A sweat house is easy enough to prepare," Tach said waving one hand in the
air. "We should wait until Nara has brought the child into being. We will need
her help." </P>
<P>"Um, Tach…<I>If</I> I were to do a sweat, I hardly think I’d need your wife’s
help. No offense." She looked around for her own wife thinking the fates would
probably drop the exdrone on her any minute.</P>
<P>"No offense taken." He studied B’Elanna. "Have you ever entered a ritual
sweat?"</P>
<P>"Well, not exactly."</P>
<P>"And it is part of your spiritual quest?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Well, I’m only half Klingon. But I have had experiences," she said, thinking
of her unpleasant visit to the Barge of the Dead.</P>
<P>He smiled. "We will help you through it. I sense you are a woman of honor,
B’Elanna. If you promised your Kahless a sweat, you must give it." He walked
away, obviously considering the subject settled.</P>
<P>"Thanks," she said. She walked toward the cabin, thinking about her words
before the shuttle arrived. Each step closer to the Homestead made her realize
how much Tach and Nara’s arrival had been exactly what she had requested, and
she was Klingon after all. Besides, how difficult could a day of sweating be?
She sweated everyday. It might even be kind of fun.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The next month passed quickly, with everyone keeping busy. Nara taught Seven
and B’Elanna faster ways to tan the hides and helped collect herbs, berries and
nuts. Their days were busy, despite the fact that they had four people working.
The first thing they did was build the cold storage house for the meat, then
they moved on to expanding the cabin, which Seven was especially grateful for.
The two weeks it had taken to add a separate bedroom had been the longest of her
life. She had become quite short tempered in the close quarters, not
appreciating the fact that she and B’Elanna had to limit their lovemaking. She
enjoyed making love with her beloved Klingon at least once a day, and preferred
the spontaneity of grabbing B’Elanna whenever the mood stuck her, often spending
the afternoon in bed. She was not amused by the concept of planning lovemaking
around times when they had the cabin alone, not amused at all.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The first night after the new bedroom had been completed she and B’Elanna
moved into it, the group deciding that the "Newly Joined" should have the more
spacious addition and the privacy it afforded. The first day after it had been
completed, Seven and B’Elanna never left their bed.</P>
<P>Once Seven felt properly reintroduced to her wife, the group began B’Elanna’s
dream project. They added a bathtub with running hot and cold water as well as
putting in a real toilet with leech fields. The Klingon decided she was in
heaven. Indoor plumbing and a hot bath seemed almost decadent, add to that a
private room with six feet of hot-blooded blonde, and life couldn’t get any
better. Now they just had to wait for Nara’s baby, and then settle the minor
matter of the sweat she owed Kahless.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven was sitting in front of the fire making a jacket for B’Elanna. She and
Nara had carefully prepared the calfskin so that it was as smooth as a newborn’s
bottom, or so Nara explained. Seven would wait until she actually felt the child
in question’s bottom before deciding. She had used a rich brown dye made from
tree bark on the leather. She thought it would complement B’Elanna’s eyes and
looked forward to giving it to her.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Nara said from the small table.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven looked up from the leather covering her lap as she sat in front
of the fire.</P>
<P>"How long before Tach and B’Elanna get back?" she asked, knowing that Seven
had an incredible ability to keep track of time and estimate when any given task
would be completed.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow. "They were going out to the herd at the end of the
lake. If they were successful with their hunt, they should be back in under two
hours," she explained and then went back to her project.</P>
<P>"Um, Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven asked, looking up again.</P>
<P>"It’s time," Nara said.</P>
<P>"Time?" Seven stared at Nara, then the realization sank in. Her pale features
lost what little color there was and then she stood and tossed the jacket onto
the floor. "You must wait until Tach returns," Seven decreed. </P>
<P>"It doesn’t work that way," Nara said with a faint smile.</P>
<P>"I do not care how it works," Seven said as she moved to the table. "You will
wait for Tach."</P>
<P>Nara laughed and shook her head. She had grown very fond of Seven and
B’Elanna and was still amazed that Seven’s brilliant mind often had no
understanding of day to day reality.</P>
<P>"I see no humor in this situation," Seven said, her voice rising as she paced
around Nara. She stopped and cautiously looked under the table as if the child
would come crawling out at her.</P>
<P>"Oh, Seven, believe me, this is funny." Nara stood, using the table to lever
herself out of the chair.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" Seven yelled and jumped back. She looked from Nara’s
belly to the rug, edging closer and then pulling back, not sure if the child
would flop onto the cabin floor.</P>
<P>"I’m having contractions," Nara explained calmly. "I’m going to walk around a
little so my back doesn’t hurt so bad. Then I’m going to go over to the bed and
get the supplies together."</P>
<P>"No," Seven ordered. "You should not be doing any of that. I will prepare the
bed, and you should not be walking," With that, Seven picked up Nara and carried
her toward the bed.</P>
<P>"I’m in labor, not crippled," Nara said. </P>
<P>Seven stopped and stared at the bed, then at Nara. "What do I need to
do?"</P>
<P>"Let me see?" Nara said. "For starters…you can put me down."</P>
<P>Seven settled Nara on the bed and glared at her. "You are enjoying my
discomfort," she accused.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am." Nara shifted until she was more comfortable. "Now get me a stack
of towels, some clean, hot water and some jerky."</P>
<P>"What are you going to do with the jerky?" Seven asked, horrified.</P>
<P>"Eat it," Nara said and then burst into laughter. "Seven, how can someone as
smart as you are know so little about birth?"</P>
<P>"As a Borg I had no experience with this process, and I do not remember my
own birth," she said, somewhat offended. She hurried to the storeroom and came
back with the jerky and towels. </P>
<P>"Thanks." Nara took the jerky and began chewing it while she put the towels
on the bed under her and then started removing her pants. </P>
<P>Seven went to the door and looked outside for any sign of B’Elanna or Tach
but saw none. She went back to the bed and stood with her hands linked behind
her back.</P>
<P>"You must delay this child’s arrival. I have insufficient experience to
assist you," Seven said.</P>
<P>"It probably won’t get here for a few hours anyway," Nara said calmly. "If it
does, just do what I tell you."</P>
<P>"Very well." Seven nodded, somewhat more relaxed. "How many children have you
delivered?"</P>
<P>"Well, none," Nara said.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "You will not have this child until they return. I forbid
it."</P>
<P>"Seven, children don’t listen even after they’re born. They certainly don’t
listen while they’re inside." Nara shook her head and looked to the door. She
was trying to remain calm, but the idea of Seven as a midwife did not appeal to
her. "Maybe you should go get them," Nara said.</P>
<P>"I do not believe that is the prudent course of action," Seven said, although
the idea of leaving the cabin certainly appealed to her. She had complained
about the foot of snow outside, but now she would be quite willing to go outside
even if the snow increased to ten feet.</P>
<P>Nara looked at Seven and then the door while Seven studied the floor. They
both knew Seven was in over her head. A sound outside caused both of them to
turn toward the door. Seven sprinted outside without grabbing a coat or shoes.
She saw Tach and B’Elanna lifting a side of beef into the cold storage.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven yelled, running toward her spouse.</P>
<P>Tach and the Klingon looked up, both covered in sweat.</P>
<P>"What it is?" B’Elanna asked as she moved toward her wife.</P>
<P>"<I>Your</I> child is coming," Seven said to Tach angrily.</P>
<P>Tach smiled and ran toward the cabin. His thick brow ridge crinkled as his
smile widened with each step. B’Elanna began moving toward the cabin as well,
but stopped when she reached Seven.</P>
<P>"Hey, is everything all right?" she asked noticing how pale Seven was and the
look of terror in her eyes.</P>
<P>"No. No, it is not. You left me here and… and…"</P>
<P>She saw Seven shiver, and took off her thick cloak and wrapped it around her
as she led her toward the cabin. "Good thing we came across this bull on this
side of the meadow." She knew Tach was the only one experienced at assisting
births, although his experience was limited to cattle. "Is Nara okay?" B’Elanna
asked.</P>
<P>"<I>She</I> is fine. <I>She</I> finds the experience humorous." Seven stopped
and looked at B’Elanna and then pulled her into a hug. </P>
<P>B’Elanna held her for a moment and then eased away. "Let’s go inside where
it’s warm."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and kept her arm around B’Elanna the entire time. Once inside,
they went to the bed to check on Nara.</P>
<P>"Her water broke," Tach said calmly. "Could still be a while, though. The
contractions are still a ways apart."</P>
<P>"That is disgusting," Seven said after looking at the bed and seeing the
water in question and then headed for the other room.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two hours later B’Elanna was able to convince Seven to come back into the
room. It was just in time for her to see the baby born. Suddenly, she didn’t
find the experience quite as disgusting. She watched as Nara and Tach held their
son, a child their love created, and she felt an unfamiliar ache inside.</P>
<P>B’Elanna seemed to feel her lover’s pain and took her hand. "You okay?" she
asked.</P>
<P>"I did not realize," Seven whispered as she watched the tiny child struggling
to hold Tach’s finger in his fist.</P>
<P>"Realize what?" B’Elanna ran the back of her fingers down Seven’s cheek. The
taller woman smiled into the touch and lowered her face down to her
partner’s.</P>
<P>"He is already a person," Seven said as she pressed her forehead against
B’Elanna’s. "A person who is loved just for being… for existing."</P>
<P>"That’s the way it’s supposed to be." B’Elanna kissed Seven’s nose. "Come on,
let’s give them some time alone." She led Seven back to the main room and they
sat in front of the crackling fire and held each other, unknowingly thinking the
same thoughts. Each woman was wondering what a child of theirs would look like
and hoping that the other would someday want to have children, but each still
too unsettled by the new feelings to voice them.</P>
