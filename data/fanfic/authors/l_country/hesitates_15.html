<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Fifteen: Duty and Devotion -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway hadn’t slept in the days since she had found out the truth
about Jusari Prime. She went to her quarters only to take a sonic shower and
change into a clean uniform. The mere thought of eating made the Starfleet
captain sick to her stomach and even water made her queasy. She worked around
the clock, trying to figure out some way to activate the artificial wormhole,
but she simply didn’t have enough information to even begin to solve the
problem. Her body began to tire, and her temper grew with each hour. </P>
<P>Kathryn was in her ready room, at her desk, when she heard the door chime
announcing someone’s arrival.</P>
<P>"Come in," she said quietly. She straightened in her chair trying to at least
look like she wasn’t dying inside.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said as he approached her desk. </P>
<P>"Have a seat," she said as she motioned to the chair across from her. He
raised an eyebrow, preferring to stand, but knowing she would not continue until
he sat. </P>
<P>"Thank you," he said as he gracefully lowered himself to the chair.</P>
<P>"What can I do for you, old friend?"</P>
<P>He took a deep breath and regarded her.</P>
<P>"Must be serious if you need to think that hard about the answer," Kathryn
said. </P>
<P>She had a way of making anyone comfortable, but Tuvok was Vulcan, so such an
action was wasted on him. It did however give him a few more moments to
formulate his answer. The Doctor had asked him to speak to her, feeling Chakotay
had been a little too eager to disobey her orders lately and that she might be
more likely to respond to the friend she had known longest on the ship.</P>
<P>"It has been brought to my attention that you are neglecting your own
health," he said bluntly. </P>
<P>"Oh?" she asked, leaning back into her chair defiantly. "And isn’t that
normally an area the Doctor or even First Officer should address with me?"</P>
<P>"The Doctor," Tuvok said distastefully, "Was uncertain of your willingness to
listen to your First Officer."</P>
<P>"And the Doctor was too chicken to speak to me himself," Janeway finished for
him.</P>
<P>"He was…reticent…given his recent request to leave the ship and his
subsequent return under less than stellar circumstances," Tuvok said. "I
was…drafted."</P>
<P>"I see." Janeway stood. "Join me on the couch?" It was not a request.</P>
<P>"You have not been taking any off time to rest in your quarters," Tuvok
accused. "And given your appearance, I do not believe you have slept in your
ready room either."</P>
<P>"I’m having a bout of insomnia, nothing more." Janeway sat at one end of the
couch and leaned her chin onto her fist. "Nothing that should alert the head of
security."</P>
<P>"And you have not eaten in the mess hall," he added. He noticed that neither
her customary coffee, nor her second favorite, a pot of tea, was anywhere to be
seen. "And before you tell me you have been eating alone, I should inform you
that I have accessed your replicator rations and I know that you have not eaten
anywhere else either." </P>
<P>"I don’t think I like you taking such an interest in my personal life,"
Janeway said, her voice deepening.</P>
<P>"Believe me, I do not enjoy it," he said. "Nevertheless, the fact remains
that as captain your health effects the safety of the ship and therefore it does
fall under my discretion."</P>
<P>"Tuvok, I’m fine. Or at least I will be once we get B’Elanna and Seven back
on board." Kathryn rubbed her eyes and sighed. "It’s part of being captain. When
some of the lambs are out of the fold, you don’t sleep."</P>
<P>"I believe this particular shepherd needs to consider her own health a
priority." Tuvok had the annoying habit of using one’s own analogy against
them.</P>
<P>"Point taken," she said but she and Tuvok both knew she had no intention of
altering her behavior.</P>
<P>"Captain, I do not believe the only issue is…lost sheep." He straightened his
posture, not entirely comfortable with where he was about to take the
conversation.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Kathryn’s tone made it clear that she was even less pleased with the
conversation than he was.</P>
<P>"I believe it is more a matter of which sheep are missing," he said. "Or
rather…a particular sheep."</P>
<P>"Let’s leave the sheep out of this and get to the point."</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow and nodded his agreement. "You are in love with Seven
of Nine."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"I believe you to heard me." Tuvok suddenly found his tunic too tight around
his throat and had to fight the urge to tug at the collar.</P>
<P>"I hope not, because that topic is off limits. Did the Doctor make this
little diagnosis on his own?" Janeway stood and paced. If her stomach hadn’t
been empty, she would have thrown up.</P>
<P>"The Doctor is unable to recognize his own feelings for Seven, I doubt that
he has any idea about yours. He is rather…self-absorbed where emotions are
concerned," Tuvok said. He actually flinched when the captain spun around and
glared at him. "I have known you long enough to recognize the depth of your
romantic attraction," Tuvok stated. </P>
<P>"I’m not going to discuss this with you," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Then who will you discuss it with? Because your concern for her is
interfering with your duty to this crew." He stood and walked over to her.</P>
<P>"I have never let anything interfere with my duty to this crew," she snapped.
She thought about the Sullivan hologram, and how her sense of duty had made her
choose it over the woman she loved. </P>
<P>"Your maintenance of your own health is one of your primary duties," he
pointed out.</P>
<P>"What do you suggest?" She rubbed her forehead, feeling a first class
migraine trying to take hold, and she damn sure wasn’t about to ask the Doctor
for something to stop it.</P>
<P>"For now, nothing," he said logically. "All we can do is wait until tomorrow
when Lieutenant Torres and Seven are released. Until then, I suggest that you go
to your quarters and rest… even if that requires a sedative. Once they are back
on board, I suggest that you tell Seven how you feel."</P>
<P>"You can’t be serious."</P>
<P>"Vulcans are always serious." He raised an eyebrow making his face seem even
sterner to prove his point. "When Seven was last on board, her actions indicated
that at one point she returned your feelings." He linked his hands behind his
back. He hated dealing with humans and their inability to see or face their
emotions. If a species was going to have emotions, he thought the least they
could do was to deal with them.</P>
<P>"At one point?" Kathryn asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Her actions suggest that she was… displeased with certain of your actions."
Of all the emotions Tuvok had to deal with when working with humans, love was by
far the most unsightly. "I believe that she was jealous of your
<I>involvement</I> with… the hologram." He found the prospect of humans loving
holographic representations of beings even more disturbing. "I do not believe
she wished to retain the feelings that she had for you after that event."</P>
<P>"I hurt her," Kathryn translated.</P>
<P>"That is what I said." Tuvok nodded.</P>
<P>"And that’s supposed to make me feel better?" she asked with a wry grin that
never reached her eyes.</P>
<P>"My motive for speaking to you was to get you to sleep, not to alter your
emotions. If you wish to do that, I am not the person to speak to." </P>
<P>"And let me guess, I should talk to Seven, right?"</P>
<P>"That has yet to be seen. Given the situation in which she has been immersed,
her state of mind cannot be calculated." Tuvok considered his next words
carefully. "She is a highly logical being, but the conditions on Jusari Prime as
well as the simple passage of time may have altered her emotions. As humans say,
‘out of sight, out of mind.’"</P>
<P>"What about, ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder?’" Kathryn said, mostly to
herself.</P>
<P>"Humans are full of inconsistencies," he said with a sigh. "How Seven will
react is an unknown variable. Add to that, the fact that we know nothing of what
she is experiencing, and the possibilities are…incalculable."</P>
<P>"So what are you suggesting?" Kathryn asked with a confused look.</P>
<P>"That you contact the Doctor and have him prescribe a sedative and rest until
tomorrow."</P>
<P>"Take two pills and call you in the morning?" Kathryn asked with a shake of
her head.</P>
<P>"Captain?"</P>
<P>"Never mind," she said. "I’ll contact the Doctor."</P>
<P>"When?" Tuvok asked. He knew about the captain’s tendency to procrastinate if
it involved her own well being.</P>
<P>"Point taken. I’ll log off duty and call him as soon as you leave," she
promised.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Are you certain?" Seven asked. She reached out and took B’Elanna’s hand. "I
would be required to… use my tubules to remove the genetic material from your
ovarian follicles."</P>
<P>B’Elanna crinkled her face at that particular prospect, but she had decided.
</P>
<P>"And then, I’d be pregnant?" the Klingon asked.</P>
<P>"No." Seven’s eyes widened. "I thought you understood, I would have to carry
our child."</P>
<P>"But, what about your nanoprobes?" B’Elanna asked. She sat up in the bed and
eased Seven up until she was sitting next to her. "Wouldn’t that mean the baby
would be Borg? Would it be a drone?"</P>
<P>"I would never create a child under those conditions," Seven assured her
wife. "When the Borg reproduce in this fashion, the fetus has no implants. It is
born fully organic. Only after its birth can the assimilation begin. The
nanoprobes that are present in the host drone… the mother… are not present in
the child’s body at birth. It was discovered that any attempts to assimilate the
fetus internally would cause spontaneous abortion. Our child would not become
Borg unless it were to be assimilated after its birth, like any other child,
human or Klingon."</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" B’Elanna asked. "We don’t have access to the medical
facilities to remove implants like the Doctor did with you."</P>
<P>"I am positive," Seven said. "There are memories in the Collective mind of
times the host…the mother… was injured, or killed during combat when close to
birth. On all of those occasions the child was delivered and could not be
retrieved. Those children were fully organic, and as so, they were expendable,"
Seven said in a whisper. The thought of a child being expendable cut her deeply.
She thought of Ty, and Naomi, and realized that she would give her life to save
either of them.</P>
<P>"If you’re sure, let’s do it." B’Elanna leaned over and pressed her lips to
Seven’s, letting her mouth relax into her lover’s. Seven moaned and deepened the
touching of lips to a fiery kiss, her arms surrounding B’Elanna and guiding her
back into the bed.</P>
<P>They spent a the next ten minutes just kissing, relaxing into the other’s
touch. Once Seven felt her wife’s body molding completely to hers, she
began.</P>
<P>Seven explained each step as she was doing it, mingling the technological
description with caresses and kisses so that their child would be born of true
lovemaking and not a sterile Borg procedure.</P>
<P>Seven’s touch was passionate, but tender, as it always was. Her hand made its
way across B’Elanna’s belly. She massaged the area around B’Elanna’s navel,
making the Klingon giggle and squirm. </P>
<P>"You know I’m ticklish there," B’Elanna said into Seven’s mouth. She bit
Seven’s lip, holding it in place while she ran her tongue over the delicate
flesh. Seven smiled and tugged away and then leaned back to taste B’Elanna’s
mouth again, then pulled away and looked down to where her hand was resting on
B’Elanna’s stomach.</P>
<P>"My tubules will enter through your abdominal wall. It is smaller than the
assimilation tubule, only large enough to remove one of your ova," Seven
explained. She waited for B’Elanna to nod before continuing. "There may be some
minor discomfort. I am sorry, Be’nal. I promised to never hurt you."</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna whispered. "We made this decision. I know you wouldn’t hurt
me on purpose. Besides, I’m a Klingon, we live for pain," she joked. Seven
smiled and nodded.</P>
<P>"I love you," Seven whispered. A tiny tubule came out of the back of her
hand, barely bigger than a thread and B’Elanna briefly wondered if it was big
enough for the task. The tubule slithered over B’Elanna’s tummy, and then tilted
into her flesh. She took in a startled breath, surprised more than injured. </P>
<P>Seven looked up to her, worry covering her pale features.</P>
<P>"Surprised me," B’Elanna explained.</P>
<P>Seven raised her eyebrow and then went back to her task. "The tubule is now
entering the follicle, finding the most mature ova," Seven described. "It has
it." She leaned forward and watched as the tubule extracted itself.</P>
<P>"That’s it?" B’Elanna asked. "I’ve had worse hangnails."</P>
<P>"Now, I must remove my ova," Seven said. She reached for her own stomach, but
B’Elanna’s hand covered hers.</P>
<P>"I want to help," B’Elanna whispered and then guided her lover’s hand into
position. A tubule appeared, but it was the thicker assimilation tubule, dozens
of times bigger. "Hey, why is it bigger?"</P>
<P>"It is necessary," Seven assured her. "This tubule must not only harvest my
ova, but hold both ovum while they are matured. Then two of my specialized
nanoprobes will enter the ovum and prepare them for joining. Once that is done,
I must wait until the cells are joined."</P>
<P>"How long?" B’Elanna asked as the tubule moved over Seven’s skin.</P>
<P>"A few minutes, the nanoprobes speed up the initial bonding." Seven could see
the concern on B’Elanna’s face. "I will be fine." The tubule angled into Seven’s
tender skin, disappearing into the tissue. The larger tubule was more intrusive,
causing Seven to wince. </P>
<P>"I’m here." B’Elanna squeezed her wife’s hand offering what support she
could.</P>
<P>Seven nodded. "My ova has been extracted. The ovum are developing." Seven
took a deep breath and closed her eyes, trying to focus on the life being
created and not the sharp pain in her abdomen. She felt B’Elanna’s lips on her
forehead and opened her eyes to see B’Elanna’s deep brown eyes studying her
face.</P>
<P>"You okay?" Concern colored B’Elanna’s words and her voice cracked. Seven
nodded and rested her forehead against B’Elanna’s. A thin layer of sweat covered
Seven’s pale skin.</P>
<P>After several minutes, Seven lifted her head. "The ovum are fully developed.
The nanoprobes are joining them together."</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned over and brushed her lips over Seven’s. "Kiss me," she
breathed. "Our child is being conceived." Seven whimpered and kissed her. It was
a loving, delicate, and sensual kiss, meant to affirm their love instead of
inflame the passion that was always brewing just below the surface and they both
began to cry.</P>
<P>"They are joined," Seven breathed in B’Elanna’s mouth. "Our child is within
me, waiting to be implanted in my womb."</P>
<P>"I love you," B’Elanna whispered. She kissed away the tears from Seven’s
cheek, knowing that the salty taste would always remind her of this moment.</P>
<P>Seven inhaled sharply and her body stiffened, her eyes squeezing tightly
shut.</P>
<P>"Are you all right?" B’Elanna asked. Seven nodded but bent over and
panted.</P>
<P>"The Borg are… meticulous. Merely placing the joined cells onto the wall of
my uterus is not sufficient. The tubule is boring into the tissue to assure
implantation," Seven said calmly, but her face was sweating heavily.</P>
<P>"I’m here, Be’nal." B’Elanna held Seven to her, careful to not bump the
tubule.</P>
<P>Seven’s breathing slowed, and her body relaxed. "It is finished," she
whispered. They watched as the tubules retracted and disappeared into Seven’s
hand. Seven rolled onto her back and took a few gulps of air while B’Elanna
snuggled up to her.</P>
<P>Tears streamed down Seven’s cheeks, falling onto the back of B’Elanna’s neck.
She turned, and studied Seven. </P>
<P>"Are you okay?" B’Elanna asked again.</P>
<P>"Yes, my Be’nal," Seven said. She turned and kissed B’Elanna tenderly. "This
is the first time my tubules have ever created a life instead of destroying
one." She lifted B’Elanna’s hand and placed it on her belly and held it in place
over their growing child.</P>
<P>They stayed in that position for a long time, until finally a kink in
B’Elanna’s neck forced her to shift her weight. "What’s happening now?" B’Elanna
asked as she settled back down beside Seven.</P>
<P>Seven turned and stared at her wife, then she began laughing. "B’Elanna, I do
not know. I only knew what was happening before because my tubule was performing
the actions. From now on, I will not know anymore than any other…mother," the
last word stuck in her throat.</P>
<P>"We’re gonna’ have a baby," B’Elanna whispered.</P>
<P>"A daughter, " Seven corrected. "We have no Y-chromosomes, so we cannot have
a male child. That would require a Y chromosome which can only be derived from a
male donor."</P>
<P>"A daughter," B’Elanna repeated with a goofy grin. She seemed to have lost
the ability to do more than repeat short phases.</P>
<P>"You will…however, have to…breast feed," Seven informed her. "My nanoprobes
will not allow my body to produce milk. It was considered an inefficient energy
source. You can be given an injection to stimulate milk production."</P>
<P>"Breast feeding? Wow." B’Elanna’s speaking ability had still not returned.
Seven hoped it didn’t last for the entire pregnancy.</P>
<P>"Not for nine months," Seven pointed out and kissed B’Elanna’s forehead,
checking for a fever to explain the loss of her ability to speak in complete
sentences.</P>
<P>"Nine months," B’Elanna repeated. Seven smiled and decided to give her
beloved Klingon a while to assimilate the information.</P>
