<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Four: Justice for all -->

<P>"It’s not my fault," B’Elanna said for the fifth time in ten minutes.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven said as she turned around and stared at Torres who was
sitting on a small bunk in the tiny, dingy cell. "And exactly whose fault is
it?"</P>
<P>"Stupid Dengari," B’Elanna said under her breath. "How was I supposed to know
they had two battle cruisers in that nebula?" Torres asked as she stood and
crossed to Seven.</P>
<P>"On the bright side," Seven said sarcastically, "We now know there is a
wormhole inside the nebula."</P>
<P>B’Elanna glared at Seven, but said nothing.</P>
<P>"Unfortunately, I do not think a wormhole that goes to the Dengari penal
colony will assist <I>Voyager</I> in any way." Seven walked to the doorway and
studied the forcefield with her Borg eyepiece looking for any weakness. She saw
none.</P>
<P>Torres was glad to see the two guards coming down the corridor. It meant she
didn’t have to respond to Seven’s remark. The guards were muscular, but lanky,
with dark coloring and had thick black hair pulled back over there ears. Their
uniforms were as black as their hair, made of reflective material that absorbed
phaser fire, much to Torres’ horror. She had tried firing on the boarding party
that over took the <I>Delta Flyer</I> only to watch in stunned silence as the
shots simply disappeared into their clothing with a muted hiss.</P>
<P>"We’ve got company," Torres whispered as she stood and moved next to Seven.
The former Borg stood to her full height and positioned herself between the
entrance and B’Elanna. The Klingon noticed, but said nothing.</P>
<P>"It is time," said Kendo, the shorter of the two guards. He was still at
least six inches taller than Seven. Malok, his silent companion, was almost ten
inches taller than the lanky Borg and he held two sets of shackles in his
hands.</P>
<P>"Time?" B’Elanna asked as she tried to step around Seven. "What the hell does
that mean?" Seven shot her an angry glare but the Klingon ignored her. "When are
we gonna’ talk to someone in charge?"</P>
<P>Malok nodded toward B’Elanna before speaking. "Your sentence has been
decided. You are very lucky that you have been given the minimum term."</P>
<P>"Sentence?" Torres yelled. "We haven’t even had a trial!"</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Seven said quietly. </P>
<P>"Suspects are not worthy of appearing before the magistrate. Had you been
found not guilty, you would have been given an audience with the magistrate,"
Kendo explained.</P>
<P>"How can we be found not guilty if we can’t give a defense?" Torres
demanded.</P>
<P>Kendo paused and then smiled. "Were you in Dengari space?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"Then you are guilty," he explained. "Come."</P>
<P>"What is our sentence?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>Malok frowned and studied the deck plating, not wanting to meet their
gaze.</P>
<P>"Two and one half years," Malok said.</P>
<P>"Unacceptable," Seven said, pushing B’Elanna behind her. "I forced Lieutenant
Torres to violate your space. I will serve both terms for a total of five years
and you will release her." </P>
<P>"What?" Torres yelled.</P>
<P>"A noble offer, but that is not how we do things," Malok answered. He
motioned to his partner and the man stepped forward. "Co-operate and you will
not be injured…again. Please."</P>
<P>"Please, B’Elanna," Seven said gently. "Do not resist. <I>Voyager</I> will
find us in a matter of days and the captain will figure something out." She
didn’t add that she been terrified when she had seen B’Elanna beaten into
submission during their capture. It had taken three guards and five broken ribs
to restrain Seven when she had seen B’Elanna go down.</P>
<P>"Fine," Torres said, noticing that Seven had used her first name and said
please. She held her hands out to the second guard and flinched as he snapped
the shackles into place. She would have fought, but when she had woken up in a
strange sick bay and looked across the room to see Seven being operated on, she
had known it was her fault. Luckily, the Dengari had technology similar to
<I>Voyager’s</I>, and they had repaired Seven’s damaged ribs and punctured
lung.</P>
<P>The guards escorted them onto a small ship without any windows and motioned
them into two seats near the front of the cramped cabin. </P>
<P>Malok, the taller guard finally spoke. His voice was deep, and sounded almost
sad. "Secure," he said as he clamped B’Elanna into the chair. He had small
ridges on his cheeks, much like his companion, but more pronounced. Torres found
the species almost attractive, except that they apparently thought throwing
someone in prison without a real trial was completely acceptable.</P>
<P>"Now you," the shorter guard said to Seven.</P>
<P>She sat, and placed her arms chair as B’Elanna had done. The taller guard
moved closer and began fastening the heavy metal clamps, two near the wrist, two
on her upper arm. His eyes met Seven’s and he quickly looked back to his
hands.</P>
<P>"Please," Seven said to him, her eyes pleading. "My left arm is damaged. This
exoskeleton helps support it. Could you loosen the clamps?"</P>
<P>Torres almost choked when she heard the blatant lie. She was amazed how
easily the fabrication rolled off the former Borg’s full lips. The guard seemed
moved, and he studied her left hand. </P>
<P>"Does it hurt?" he whispered.</P>
<P>"It is painful, but I can tolerate it. I cannot bend it, so the clamps cut
into my flesh," Seven said, then tilted her head and actually batted her
eyelashes at him. "Please."</P>
<P>"Okay," he said quietly and loosened the clamps. "How’s that?" He put his
fingers under the clamp to check the tightness and sucked in a deep breath when
Seven flinched and whimpered when he touched her skin. He frowned and loosened
them a bit more.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven whispered as he stepped away. She looked over at B’Elanna
who was biting her lip to keep from laughing.</P>
<P>"What about our shuttle?" Torres finally asked.</P>
<P>The shorter guard turned. "It will be held until your release. You have the
option of having any personal items with you, except for weapons or
communications devices."</P>
<P>"We’ll take everything," Torres said. "And there’s a power converter we need
from the cargo bay."</P>
<P>"You won’t have any power where you’re going," he answered.</P>
<P>"She’ll die without it," Torres said motioning toward Seven with her head.
"Her, injuries, make it necessary for her to take energy directly from the
converter." It wasn’t entirely true, since Seven could eat solid food and sleep
when she had to, but the power converter allowed her to maintain more productive
levels and made sleep almost unnecessary. B’Elanna also hoped she could use the
converter to make a signal device.</P>
<P>"Is it portable," Malok asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said.</P>
<P>"We’ll load it," he said. "It might help." </P>
<P>The two guards left and B’Elanna looked over at Seven. "Any bright
ideas?"</P>
<P>"We will adapt," Seven said. She looked down at her loosely restrained left
arm. "Thank you for bringing up the power converter."</P>
<P>"It’s the least I can do," Torres said quietly. "Sorry I got us into this.
Oh, and by the way, Borg… what did you think you were pulling trying to take the
fall alone? You think I’d go back to <I>Voyager</I> and just leave you here to
serve my sentence?"</P>
<P>"No," Seven smirked before continuing. "I expected you to go to
<I>Voyager</I> and bring back help."</P>
<P>"Oh," Torres said.</P>
<P>The two guards returned, their arms full of items from the shuttle. Malok
began packing them into a large locker at the back of the cabin. He carefully
examined each object as he placed them into the storage container while the
shorter guard returned for more things. </P>
<P>"Medical supplies," Malok said. "These will come in handy if you can keep
them."</P>
<P>"Where are we going?" Seven asked, turning her head to try to look at
him.</P>
<P>"Jusari Prime. It’s our penal colony," he said as he continued to pack things
into the locker. "The shuttle will come down just outside the outer limits of
Non-V City, the secondary city. It’s for non-violent offenders, but you should
still be wary. The violent offenders migrate toward Non-V to take advantage of
the newcomers. As soon as they see the shuttle come down, the scavengers will
head for your position. They’ll kill you if they can."</P>
<P>"Great," Torres said. "Any other good news for us?"</P>
<P>He finished putting the things in the locker then stood and held out a
laser-cutting torch. "I can’t let you have this. It can be used as a
weapon."</P>
<P>Seven leaned toward him. "What else can you tell us?"</P>
<P>"Try to get as far way from the city as quickly as you can. Most of the
life-sentencers gather there." He moved closer and knelt between the two women
and took a map off of the flat dashboard. It had no instruments and seemed
designed more for storage than anything else. He opened the map and held it up
to them. It showed the entire planet’s surface with four continents around the
equator. "V-City is here. You should avoid that area at all costs," he said
pointing to the center of the largest continent. "This is Non-V, it’s not much
better." He pointed to an area near one of the eastern most seaboards. </P>
<P>"Why do we have to go to either?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"We send offenders to one of the two starting points. It’s up to you where
you go then." He reached into his waist pack and took out a device that looked
like a large hypospray and adjusted the setting. "As long as you stay within the
area near the equator, the weather is moderate. If you go further, the weather
is harsher, but there are fewer people."</P>
<P>"How do we get back?" Torres asked.</P>
<P>"This," he said pressing the hypospray into Seven’s neck. "I just set it for
your release date. It has a genetic marker as well as a radioactive tracer. We
already installed a universal translator at the hospital." He pressed the hypo
into B’Elanna’s neck and stood. "At the end of your sentence you will be
retrieved by transporter."</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to one side. "Why not transport us onto the
surface?"</P>
<P>Malok leaned against the dash and looked at her. "The shuttle is supposed to
give you a fighting chance. It allows you to take your possessions with you, but
you won’t be able to bring them with you when you return, so leave anything of
value here. If you can keep the scavengers away, you can use the shuttle for
shelter, but I wouldn’t suggest it. They make good targets."</P>
<P>"Malok," Torres whispered. "We have a ship that will come looking for us,
<I>Voyager</I>. Tell where we went. Please."</P>
<P>"It won’t matter," he said. "They’ll never get through the wormhole."</P>
<P>"You are mistaken," Seven said. "Our captain will not give up on us."</P>
<P>He sighed and stood. "It won’t matter. I’m sorry. Oh, and don’t waste your
time trying to get this shuttle to fly. It isn’t designed to leave orbit. We
launch it from a cruiser into the atmosphere, and its guidance system takes it
to the landing zone. Takes about ten minutes. It doesn’t have any communications
equipment at all." He turned back and looked at Seven. "Stay out of the cities.
Your golden hair is very rare. They’ll… they’ll like you."</P>
<P>"What the hell does that mean?" Torres demanded.</P>
<P>He looked into the Klingon’s dark eyes. "These are not nice people. She will
be a primary target."</P>
<P>"I am no one’s target," Seven said.</P>
<P>Malok turned to Torres. "If you can, dye her hair black. It might help some.
If it doesn’t, well… the transporter retrieval system will pull out anyone with
your DNA markers. If… well… any offspring will be beamed out with you."</P>
<P>"Offspring?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"You can’t send her down to that hell hole," Torres said as she struggled
against her restraints. </P>
<P>"I’m sorry," he said as he went to the door when Kendo returned with his arms
full of gear.</P>
<P>Kendo placed the energy converter into the locker and turned around as Malok
continued stowing the rest. </P>
<P>"It’s against rules," Kendo said quietly to Torres. "But I took one of the
solar collectors from your cargo bay, maybe you can use it to help your
friend."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Torres said. She felt her chest tightening and began to wonder
if <I>Voyager</I> would ever find them. The two guards were competent, and kind,
but what worried her was the way they kept looking at Seven with sincere regret.
Whatever they were headed for, B’Elanna would do whatever was necessary to keep
Seven safe.</P>
<P>"It’s time," Malok said as he secured the locker.</P>
<P>"Good luck," Kendo said. "You will be retrieved exactly two and one half
years after you land, no matter where you are. If you get separated, you will be
reunited when we retrieve you."</P>
<P>"Stay away from the cities," Malok said as he squeezed Seven’s shoulder, then
he and Kendo left the shuttle. </P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven said nothing as they listened to the outer door being
locked down. They felt the shuttle vibrate as it was lifted into the launch bay.
B’Elanna flexed against her restraints, but the alloy didn’t budge. She looked
over at Seven and raised her eyebrows in question.</P>
<P>Seven twisted her wrist and grimaced when her thumb popped out of its socket.
She rotated her shoulder as she worked for the best angle. Her wrist was still
at the wrong angle to clear the second restraint so she pulled her entire weight
away from her arm. Torres groaned when she heard the bone snap and watched as
Seven pulled the flopping limb up through the restraint. Once clear of the
restraint she turned and examined the clamp holding her fully human arm.</P>
<P>"Kahless!" B’Elanna said. "Didn’t that hurt?"</P>
<P>"Pain is irrelevant at the moment," Seven said as she pulled at her
restrained arm. She placed her Borg enhanced hand near her fully human hand and
accessed the tiny control panel near her wrist. Her assimilation tubules
slithered out of her hand and she held them up to the restraint. The tiny
tubules contained microscopic drills in the tips, which Seven used to eat away
at the alloy holding her in place. After several minutes she yanked her arm free
and went to B’Elanna’s chair and began drilling to free her.</P>
<P>"That thing’s pretty handy," Torres said as she watched the Borg drills eat
through the alloy with ease.</P>
<P>"There are some advantages to being a drone," Seven said. The final clamp
broke in half and Seven went immediately toward the locker at the back of the
cabin.</P>
<P>"Get the bone mender and let me fix that arm," B’Elanna said. She stood and
began looking over the small cabin.</P>
<P>"There is no time," Seven said as she grabbed a tricorder from the pile of
supplies. "Use this to find the best way to access the propulsion system. We can
alter the shuttle’s course."</P>
<P>"Umm, Seven? This thing isn’t spaceworthy," Torres said even as she began
scanning the cabin.</P>
<P>"Correct, but if we can access the propulsion, we can land somewhere away
from the two major cities." Seven pulled out a box of tools and began digging
through them with her uninjured arm. "I believe it would be to our advantage to
avoid contact with any of the planet’s current inhabitants."</P>
<P>"Good idea." B’Elanna paused near the back of the cabin. "Here, there’s a
fuel line to the main thrusters."</P>
<P>Seven began tearing away the panel with a large spanner. "Once we access
this, you will need to figure out how to restrict the flow to alter the
shuttle’s flight path. I will begin scans of the planet so I can determine the
best landing zone."</P>
<P>"Got it," Torres said as she lifted the panel out and leaned into the
opening.</P>
<P>Seven reset the tricorder and tried to scan through the shuttle’s thick hull.
"I can’t get any interstellar readings, but I am getting a clear image of the
planet. We are coming in over the main continent. Reduced fuel to aft thrusters
by 40 percent. That will put us into a tight turn."</P>
<P>"Okay," Torres said and grabbed the edge of the panel. The shuttle responded,
tossing Seven across the floor. She rolled onto her knees and continued scanning
the planet surface. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant, do you have a preference? Desert or mountain?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Desert or mountain," Seven repeated. "We can reach two areas, one is desert,
one mountain."</P>
<P>"Mountain," Torres said. "But it better not be cold."</P>
<P>"Increase aft thruster to 72 percent," Seven said, raising an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"72 percent? Seven, I’m winging it."</P>
<P>"Winging it?" Seven asked, mortified.</P>
<P>"I don’t exactly have a comm panel here. I’m just kinda’ cutting off the flow
a little."</P>
<P>"Then ‘kinda’ cut off the supply to 72 percent of normal." Seven crawled
closer to Torres. Seven continued scanning. "Reduced aft thruster to 60
percent."</P>
<P>B’Elanna glared at Seven and then tried to estimate her adjustment.</P>
<P>"Too much, increase thrust to 74 percent," Seven ordered.</P>
<P>"I’m gonna’ kill Janeway for this," Torres said even as she increased the
thrust.</P>
<P>"We are coming in for a landing," Seven said. "I suggest you brace for
impact. I do not believe this shuttle was designed for a rough terrain landing.
I will monitor our descent."</P>
<P>"What about your arm?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Go. After landing I may have more serious injuries for you to attend." Seven
began making minute adjustments to the thruster but it was difficult because she
could only access one of the shuttle’s two sets of thrusters. By increasing or
decreasing the thrust she was able to make the shuttle turn, but only in one
direction, to the right. So if they needed to turn the left, they had to make a
three-quarter circle to the right to effect a one-quarter turn to the left.</P>
<P>"Seven, leave it," B’Elanna said. "Take cover."</P>
<P>"1500 kilometers…" Seven said, glancing at the tricorder, still making
adjustments to the thrusters. "1000…"</P>
<P>"Seven, brace yourself. That’s an order."</P>
<P>"500…" Seven made one final adjustment. "Impact in 6 seconds…"</P>
<P>"I told you to take cover," Torres yelled. "Seven, get…" The shuttle’s impact
cut Torres off. She had tied herself back into the restraint chair and was
thrown forward, knocking the wind out of her chest. The sound of metal on rock
filled her ears and she wondered if the small shuttle would tear into pieces or
just burst into flames. She was pitched to the left and saw a flash of blue go
past her, followed by the sound of flesh against steel. The grinding stopped and
Torres found herself still in the chair. She looked over and saw Seven under the
front panel of the shuttle.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna ripped at her ties and then crawled over the very still
body under the dash. "Seven? Don’t you die on me, Borg. That would be just like
you to leave me to fend for myself." She careful turned the blonde over and saw
a deep gash across her temple. "Damn it."</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, must you always use such colorful euphemisms?" Seven whispered
as she sat up.</P>
<P>"You’re damn right I do," B’Elanna answered. "Are you okay?"</P>
<P>Seven stared at the half Klingon before answering. "Given our current
situation, I believe any answer would be relative."</P>
<P>"You’re fine," Torres said as she moved to get the medical pack. She quickly
scanned Seven and then healed the deep cut on her temple. "No concussion. Must
be that hard head."</P>
<P>"We should verify our location," Seven said as she tried to stand.</P>
<P>"Not so fast," Torres said, yanking her back down to the floor. "Let me fix
that arm first. Where’d you park us anyway?"</P>
<P>"I attempted to land on the smaller of the two continents off the western
coast of the main land mass." Seven held her arm out for Torres to examine. It
had swelled and turned a deep purple and seemed to have an extra bend in the
middle of her lower arm.</P>
<P>"How close are we to the main continent? The one where the cities are?"
B’Elanna frowned at the tricorder. "Damn, Seven. You snapped the radius and the
ulna."</P>
<P>"There are 2,500 miles of ocean between us and the continent with the prison
cities." Seven grimaced as B’Elanna tried to straighten the damaged arm. "As for
my injury, I had to break the bones in order to free myself from the
restraints."</P>
<P>"This is gonna’ hurt," Torres said as she gripped the arm on each side of the
breaks. </P>
<P>"It already hurts," Seven responded dryly.</P>
<P>"It’s gonna’ get worse," Torres said. "Wait, let me give you a
painkiller."</P>
<P>"No," Seven held B’Elanna in place with her good arm. "We may need the
painkiller for more serious injuries in the future. I can tolerate the
pain."</P>
<P>Torres studied Seven for several seconds and then nodded. "I’m sorry." She
wrenched the bones back into place with a muted crunch. </P>
<P>Seven said nothing, but squeezed her eyes shut and took deep breaths and a
tear slid down her cheek. </P>
<P>"Oh, God, I’m sorry," B’Elanna said again and gently set her arm in her lap.
She wiped away the tear and cupped Seven’s cheek in her hand. "With that tough
act of yours, you’d make a great Klingon."</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes, expecting to see Torres mocking her, but found only
sincerity. "Thank you."</P>
<P>"You’re welcome." Torres used the bone mender to knit the bones back together
and then they both stood. "Let’s take a look around the neighborhood," B’Elanna
said as she headed for the door.</P>
