<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 22: Revelations -->

<P>B’Elanna watched Dehar’s eyes bulge, then she turned and snarled when Janeway
and Tuvok fought to pull her off the downed man.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna!" Janeway yelled, though she took a step back when the Klingon
barred her razor sharp incisors. "Let him go. That’s an order," the captain
said.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, your actions are illogical." Tuvok tried to pinch B’Elanna’s
neck, but her Klingon physiology kept her from passing out.</P>
<P>Seven moved around the table quickly and came up behind her wife and molded
herself to B’Elanna’s body from behind. She ignored the dangerous aura radiating
off of her spouse and slid her hands down B’Elanna’s arms until her hands
covered the Klingon’s. "Let him go," Seven whispered. </P>
<P>The blonde’s body seemed to have a calming effect on B’Elanna, and Seven’s
words did what Tuvok’s muscle and Janeway’s orders could not. B’Elanna released
Dehar and let Seven lift her off of the choking man.</P>
<P>"Janeway to the Doctor, medical emergency in conference room two. Doctor, I
need you…Now!" Janeway moved toward B’Elanna who was still wrapped in Seven’s
arms. </P>
<P>Seven was standing behind the shorter Klingon nuzzling her ear and whispering
soothing murmurs to her. "Shh," Seven whispered. "I am here. We are both all
right." She rubbed her cheek against B’Elanna’s ear.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Janeway said as she stormed over to B’Elanna, ignoring the tall
blonde who was literally holding the Lieutenant up. "What the hell did you think
you were doing?"</P>
<P>"Anarchy," the Magistrate said as he stood. "This is what your leniency will
get you. The criminals will destroy the peacekeepers."</P>
<P>Janeway ignored the man. "I’m waiting for an answer, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>B’Elanna said nothing as she stared at Dehar. She was shaking, and had broken
out into a sweat. She was in full battlelust, having realized that Dehar was the
one who had almost cost her everything, and her Klingon physiology was running
roughshod over her human half.</P>
<P>"Please state the nature…" the Doctor began as he materialized, then stopped.
He took one look at Torres, then the downed man and went to assist him. "Let me
guess," the hologram asked with a sarcastic smirk. "This Dengari here slept with
a holographic barmaid?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna growled.</P>
<P>"Shh," Seven whispered and shifted B’Elanna so that she was beside her, still
wrapped by a protective arm. "Magistrate, you speak of anarchy? That peacekeeper
of yours took a monetary inducement and allowed two prisoners to enter our cell
while we slept. We could have both been killed, along with our unborn child."
She hugged B’Elanna closer, feeling her wife’s shaking shift to slight trembles
as her body began to relax, the Klingon hormones releasing their grip. "If this
is what you offer, I for one would prefer honest anarchy. At least your people
would know what to expect," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Is this true?" the Magistrate asked as he moved toward Dehar.</P>
<P>Now that the Doctor had healed his fractured larynx, Dehar sat up. He shook
his head.</P>
<P>"He is lying," Seven said. She looked at Janeway, who suddenly looked more
understanding, and then the former drone continued. "The bracelet Dehar is
wearing belonged to one of the men who attacked us. We witnessed that prisoner
offering the bracelet as incentive to let him into our cell. Dehar refused, but
he obviously reconsidered."</P>
<P>"Dehar," the Overseer said as she moved closer. "I will find out if this is
true."</P>
<P>"She is a criminal," Dehar rasped. "My word cannot be questioned by
hers."</P>
<P>"Test the bracelet," B’Elanna said, her voice shaking. "I can bet you’ll find
that dead prisoner’s DNA."</P>
<P>The Doctor scanned the bracelet before Dehar could protest. "There are
innumerable skin flakes and DNA remnants of another person on the bracelet. I’d
say someone else wore this for several years before Mr. Dehar, and it looks like
Dehar’s DNA only began appearing within the last few days. I can compare it to
the prisoner in question if you have his DNA on file."</P>
<P>"He will be punished," the Overseer promised.</P>
<P>"I am a guard…a Dengari citizen… that woman has no rights," Dehar said, his
voice hoarse, each word causing shooting pains. He struggled to his feet,
leaning on the Doctor.</P>
<P>Seven stared at Dehar. "My wife is Klingon. When I joined with her I adopted
that culture’s creed and its customs," the former Borg said as she eased
B’Elanna out of her arms and moved closer Dehar.</P>
<P>The Klingon raised an eyebrow and watched the scene unfold.</P>
<P>"As a Klingon spouse," Seven continued, "I am well within my rights to plunge
my fist into Dehar’s chest and remove his heart." Seven raised the implant over
eye when she saw Janeway smirk. "It would be my sacred right to devour his
cardiac organ, although a coward without honor would not be a worthy meal. I
would rather feed it to my pet targh," she told the Overseer.</P>
<P>Seven walked over to Dehar who leaned away from the exdrone, sensing the
strength the young woman had at her disposal. He paled visibly and released a
tiny squeak as he realized that this was by far the more dangerous of the two
women he had wronged. Seven reached out and ran her left hand down his well
armored chest plate, then dug her Borg encased fingers into the fabric and armor
and shredded it.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes narrowed and her voice took on an almost Klingon growl. "Be
thankful I do not own a targh." Seven turned and went back to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>No one commented as Seven put her hands on B’Elanna’s shoulders and stared
into her eyes. The Klingon smiled and pressed her forehead against Seven’s.</P>
<P>"I have a targh," B’Elanna whispered. </P>
<P>"Your stuffed animal Toby does not count," Seven said, "But perhaps he
should." </P>
<P>There was a long, awkward pause. </P>
<P>Tuvok watched, his expression unchanging, but he admitted to himself that if
he had not been Vulcan, the revelation about an unborn child would have made his
jaw drop, and he also would have allowed himself to enjoy Seven’s visual
demonstration or her anger. Fortunately, he was composed enough to avoid such an
unseemly display of emotion.</P>
<P>"Well," the Doctor finally said. "I guess we won’t be changing
<I>Voyager’s</I> no pets allowed rule anytime soon."</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat. "Overseer, I apologize for my officer’s actions,
but I hope under the circumstances, you will leave her punishment to me."</P>
<P>"Under the circumstances," the Overseer said quietly, "I hope you will not
punish her at all."</P>
<P>"I will abdicate." The Magistrate sat and crossed his arms over his chest. "I
am an old man, I am too far removed from my subjects, and I have no stomach to
understand the people who serve me."</P>
<P>"Magistrate, I think it is time," the Overseer said.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is," he responded. "But I am no longer Magistrate. That is your
title now…daughter."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok escorted the Dengari delegation off the ship, handing Dehar over to a
pair of muscular guards while the Doctor returned to sickbay. The hologram was
somewhat insulted that the captain had dismissed him out of hand. He had wanted
to hear what the captain would tell Seven after her blatant intimidation of an
alien guest after her wife had almost ripped the man’s throat out. Janeway
stayed in the conference room with B’Elanna and Seven, the three sitting quietly
at the table until the room emptied. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres," Janeway said quietly after the door hissed shut behind
the Doctor. "I’m only going to have this conversation once, is that clear?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," Torres said.</P>
<P>The captain nodded before continuing. "Lieutenant…B’Elanna, your behavior was
unacceptable…"</P>
<P>"You know what he did," Seven cut in angrily.</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway hissed, holding up her hand. "I’m letting you stay as a
privilege. I am not in the habit of dressing down my officers in front of an
audience."</P>
<P>"Understood." Seven’s eyes flashed, but she leaned back and crossed her arms.
"Thank you, Captain," she added in whisper. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I understand why you attacked him. I may have done it in your
place," Janeway said. The irony almost made the words catch in her throat. "But
when you agreed to act as a member of Starfleet, you agreed to live by our
creed." The captain glanced over at Seven, letting her know that even though she
had chosen to live by Klingon tradition, it didn’t excuse her from Starfleet’s
rules either. "If you can’t honor the oath to Starfleet, to me, then I need to
know right now."</P>
<P>"Ma’am…" B’Elanna looked into the captain’s eyes, she cared for Janeway,
looked up to her, and wanted to make her proud. "I will honor my oath to you,
and to Starfleet, but I also made an oath to Seven, and I will not break
that…for anyone or anything."</P>
<P>"And if your oath to Seven comes between your oath to me, to this ship?" the
captain asked. She had to know the answer, despite her respect for the young
Klingon.</P>
<P>B’Elanna swallowed, glanced at Seven and sighed. "Captain, Seven and I have
talked about this. She and I are a family, but we are also part of
<I>Voyager’s</I> family. We will put the ship and the crew first, as honor
demands. But after hours?" B’Elanna smiled. "After hours belong to us."</P>
<P>"I think I can live with that," Janeway said with a wry grin. Inside her
heart clenched. The after hours did indeed belong to them, and they belonged to
each other. Any fool could see that, and Kathryn Janeway was no fool.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded. "I would lay my life down to save any member of this crew…
and I know Seven would too," she said. "We are Starfleet officers…" B’Elanna
cleared her throat and smirked. "But I am Klingon too…Just don’t put me into a
small room with anyone who tries to hurt my wife."</P>
<P>"I’ll remember that," the captain said. "But I will have to toss you in the
brig… next time."</P>
<P>A wide grin spread over Seven’s face. She released a breath she hadn’t
realized she had been holding and relief sparkled in her lapis blue eyes. </P>
<P>The captain saw Seven’s expression and pinned her with a deadly glare. "Don’t
think you’re off the hook either." She leaned back and watched as the relief on
Seven’s face faded and was replaced by embarrassed remorse.</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said seriously.</P>
<P>Janeway leveled her gaze on the exdrone, but there was a cobalt glint beneath
her slate blue eyes. "Be thankful I do not own a targh?" Janeway asked as she
scrunched her face and quoted the young exdrone. The elegant captain covered her
full lips with both hands and burst into laughter.</P>
<P>Seven raised both eyebrows almost to her hairline, her outrage apparent. Her
expression and mood did not improve when B’Elanna joined the captain in a long,
much needed fit of laughter.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven found themselves confined in cargo bay two yet again, but
not as a punishment. This time it was so Seven could regenerate. With all the
commotion, there hadn’t been time to set up one of the Borg devices in their
quarters. B’Elanna was resting against her wife’s long lanky legs as the exdrone
took in her energy from the ship. The deck plating underneath her was cold, and
hard, and uncomfortable, but there wasn’t anywhere else B’Elanna wanted to be.
Seven only needed a few hours of regeneration to supplement her food intake,
which was still considerable, even though she didn’t care for Neelix’s cooking.
B’Elanna’s eyes were closed as she rested against her spouse, but they shot open
when she heard the cargo bay door open.</P>
<P>"Hi," Naomi Wildman said as she walked across the huge room. "Is Seven almost
ready to wake up?"</P>
<P>"Almost. What’s up, squirt?" B’Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>"Um, well…" Naomi stared at Seven, and her mind wandered. "Her hair is really
long," she said as she stepped up onto the dais. "Does it take her a long time
to braid it?"</P>
<P>"Sometimes," B’Elanna said seriously. "But I help her if she’s in a
hurry."</P>
<P>Naomi’s eyes widened like saucers. She couldn’t imagine the fierce Klingon
braiding anyone’s hair.</P>
<P>"Did you come to ask about Seven’s hair?" B’Elanna sat back down on the floor
and rested against Seven’s legs. She stretched her own much shorter legs in
front of her, then motioned for Naomi to sit.</P>
<P>"No, I just think it’s pretty…all braided like that," Naomi said with a
giggle. She sat in front of B’Elanna and curled her legs up Indian style on the
deck plating. "I came to see if you would come to dinner with me…tonight."</P>
<P>"What about your mom?" B’Elanna asked. She silently agreed with the child’s
assessment of Seven’s new hairstyle. It did look pretty.</P>
<P>"Oh," Naomi said as she studied Seven. "Mom said I could meet you in the mess
hall." She kept glancing back and forth between the sleeping exdrone and the
Klingon resting comfortably against her as if she were a giant Borg pillow.</P>
<P>Seven let out a quiet groan and her left hand twitched once; both actions
almost imperceptible. B’Elanna stood and then reached down and offered Naomi her
hand. The child took it and was pulled to her feet.</P>
<P>"Why don’t you ask Seven what she thinks?" B’Elanna said as she turned.</P>
<P>*"<I>Regeneration cycle complete,"* </I>the computer announced.</P>
<P>"How did you know?" Naomi asked, her voice full of wonder.</P>
<P>"After two and a half years, I just do." B’Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes and stepped out of the alcove. She stretched and looked
down at Naomi, then back at B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"Naomi came to invite us to dinner," B’Elanna explained.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Uh huh," Naomi said. "I asked Neelix to fix something special."</P>
<P>"Well then," Seven said as she took Naomi’s tiny hand, "Shall we go?"</P>
<P>"Acceptable," Naomi said. She paused, and reached up and took B’Elanna’s hand
on the opposite side. The Klingon looked surprised, but took it in stride like
any good warrior, and let Naomi pull her and Seven toward the exit. She missed
the amused smirk on her wife’s face.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The mess hall was quiet and dark when they entered, and B’Elanna went into
Engineer mode. "Why is the power out?"</P>
<P>"Surprise," yelled a chorus of voices. The lights came up and most of the
crew came pouring out of the kitchen or jumped out from behind the tables.</P>
<P>B’Elanna glared at Naomi, but there was a hint of a smile on her lips. "You
are in so much trouble, squirt."</P>
<P>Naomi giggled and let go of the two startled women. "It’s your wedding
reception," she explained.</P>
<P>"I got that, Naomi," B’Elanna said as she reached over and yanked Seven next
to her.</P>
<P>"Explain?" Seven whispered as the well-wishers stampeded toward the two.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned into Seven. "Trust me, you don’t want to know," she
whispered. "If I had known this was coming…I woulda’ brought Naomi Wildcow home
for supper."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes showed her shock.</P>
<P>"Hey, tell me if you agree with me in an hour," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, Seven, congratulations," Neelix said as he hurried over. "Naomi
and I have been working nonstop to surprise you. Did it work?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Neelix. Naomi was quite the little spy." B’Elanna smiled sweetly at
Naomi.</P>
<P>The half-Katarian child quickly found somewhere else to be.</P>
