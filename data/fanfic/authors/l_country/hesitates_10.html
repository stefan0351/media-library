<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Ten: Close Quarters -->

<P>It took just over two hours to get back to cabin, which surprised B’Elanna.
She had expected a clumsy farmer and his pregnant wife to slow them down, but
both proved to be competent. They traveled quietly through the trees and didn’t
complain about the weight of the tools. Once back at the cabin, the farmers were
impressed.</P>
<P>"I don’t think you’ll be needing much help from me with the cabin," Tach said
as he shook his head. "That’s a sturdy structure, and from the size of that
smoke shed, looks like I have some hunting to do."</P>
<P>"Come on inside," B’Elanna said as she opened the door. The fire in the
hearth was mostly burned down, but there were coals glowing brightly thanks to
the hard wood and the well-crafted fireplace. The room was warm and the smell of
breakfast still lingered.</P>
<P>Nara followed B’Elanna and smiled as she took in the surroundings. "Well now,
we can work with this," she said as she looked at the stack of furs off against
one wall. "I’ll have you in shirts in no time." She moved to the hearth and
warmed her hands.</P>
<P>Seven and Tach came in last and stacked most of the tools near the door. Tach
picked out a small box and carried it over to the table next to the fire.</P>
<P>"Get those boots off," Nara ordered. "I won’t be tending you in a
sickbed."</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," Tach said as he sat on the floor at his wife’s feet.</P>
<P>"<I>Oh god,"</I> B’Elanna thought. "<I>He’s me… and we’re both whipped."</I>
She turned and looked at Seven who had both eyebrows raised and her arms
crossed. Her blue eyes were pinned on B’Elanna’s wet boots.</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," B’Elanna said with a huff and tugged her boots off.</P>
<P>Tach smiled at the Klingon and she shrugged her shoulders and sat next to
him.</P>
<P>Seven ignored her own wet feet and stoked the fire, pausing her run her hand
through B’Elanna’s hair as she passed. Once the flames were putting off as much
heat as a warp core breech, she went to the kitchen and started heating some
water and collecting spices and some dried meat. </P>
<P>Nara came up behind her. "Can I help you with that?"</P>
<P>Seven turned at looked at the shorter woman’s bulging belly. "Perhaps you
should rest. I do not want the child coming out early."</P>
<P>"No chance of that." Nara laughed and rubbed her stomach. "I love Tach, but
that man’s never been early to anything in his life."</P>
<P>"And the child knows this?" Seven asked suspiciously.</P>
<P>"Great Goddess, I hope so." Nara laughed again. Seven liked the sound of the
tiny woman’s rich laugh. "What is that?" Nara asked, pointing to the pot.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna calls the animal a cow, but I assure you, that is a deceptive
designation." Seven tossed in some wild mushrooms.</P>
<P>"Well, if they’re cows, Tach will get the best from them."</P>
<P>"We do not…farm them. They are wild and we take them as we need them," Seven
said a bit sadly.</P>
<P>"You don’t much like killing them, do you?" Nara moved closer and examined
the various vegetables on the counter, tossing in a few that interested her.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said quietly. "I have seen enough death."</P>
<P>"I hope you never change that way of thinking. Death should never be
welcomed. We take a life when we need it. The Goddess doesn’t like waste. Take
what you need and leave the rest." Nara smiled up at Seven. "And soon, we’ll be
having new life." </P>
<P>Seven nodded, liking the idea of new life, but uncertain about who the
goddess in question was. "I have never seen a lifeform from its initial
emergence."</P>
<P>"Well, you will," Nara said as she looked around the kitchen, stopping when
she saw the power converter. "What’s that? I didn’t think there was any
electricity on the planet." </P>
<P>"It is a solar converter. I require it to augment my…implants." Seven glanced
out toward the other room, suddenly nervous.</P>
<P>"I noticed your…prosthetics. I didn’t realize your injuries required special
treatment. Where you injured in an accident?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"I was Borg," Seven said quietly.</P>
<P>"Borg? What is that? I don’t understand?" Nara moved closer, staring at the
implant over Seven’s eye.</P>
<P>"Be glad you do not. If you did, we would most likely not be meeting now."
Seven stepped away and turned to leave. "The stew needs to simmer for a while
before it is tender. Help yourself to anything you want." Seven went back out to
the fire and sat next to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"You’re soaked," B’Elanna whispered as she wrapped a fur around her wife and
then crawled around her and began taking off her shoes. Seven said nothing, just
watching as B’Elanna removed her shoes and rubbed her feet to warm them. The
compact Klingon then moved around behind Seven and rubbed her shoulders. Seven
relaxed into the touch and leaned back against her.</P>
<P>"You been married long?" Tach asked, smiling at the two women.</P>
<P>"Almost five months," B’Elanna said as she leaned down and kissed Seven’s
temple from behind.</P>
<P>"Four months twenty eight days," Seven corrected. "Our anniversary is in two
days."</P>
<P>"Then I guess we’ll be having a party," he said. He noticed Seven’s eyes
widen. "Or perhaps the two of you can celebrate alone. I remember being newly
joined."</P>
<P>"It’s not that," B’Elanna said, though she knew that was a big part of it.
"We’ve been alone for a while, and we may need some time to adjust to
having…company."</P>
<P>"Good enough," he said. </P>
<P>Nara came in and sat on one of the seats at the small table. She leaned back
and let her head fall over the headrest and released a long sigh.</P>
<P>"Are you having the child?" Seven asked, sitting up.</P>
<P>"No," Nara said without moving. "Just nice to be off my feet."</P>
<P>B’Elanna pulled Seven back to her and giggled. "It’s not just gonna’ come
shooting out without warning."</P>
<P>Seven turned her head and kissed B’Elanna’s cheek. "Are you certain?"</P>
<P>"Well, yeah," B’Elanna said. "Well, pretty sure." She looked over at Tach.
"That thing isn’t gonna’ come flying out of there is it?"</P>
<P>"Goddess, I hope not," he said calmly.</P>
<P>"Tach," Nara said, her eyes still closed. "I think you need to go out hunting
tomorrow and help bring in some meat. You need to pull your weight."</P>
<P>"Our weight," he corrected then looked over at B’Elanna. "You mind showing me
around in the morning?"</P>
<P>"Not at all. I was going out myself." B’Elanna felt Seven squeeze her arms
and she pulled the blonde closer. She enjoyed the closeness, then remember
something else. "There are a few rules, though," B’Elanna added.</P>
<P>"It’s your valley," he said carefully. "What is it?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna rubbed Seven’s arm as she spoke, the feisty Klingon not even aware
she was doing it. "Well, we use whatever we kill, all the meat, and the hide.
And we don’t take the best animals of the herd, leave those for breeding," she
explained.</P>
<P>"You sure you’re not a farmer?" he asked. "Those are good rules. It’ll keep
the herd strong."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said. "One other thing. There’s a honey red calf, you leave
that one alone."</P>
<P>"Breeder?" he asked.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she kissed Seven’s hair. "That one is my wife’s pet.
You don’t want to hurt that one, as a matter of fact, maybe you shouldn’t take
any of the honey red ones. I don’t."</P>
<P>Seven blushed, touched by her lover’s words. She had known that B’Elanna
would never kill the calf she had named after Naomi Wildman, but she hadn’t been
aware that the protection extended to all the reddish blonde cattle. </P>
<P>"I didn’t know," Seven said, turning to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Well, I didn’t think you’d want to look at a hide the same color as your
little Naomi Wildcow." Torres began blushing too. She wasn’t used to having
witnesses to her soft side.</P>
<P>Seven didn’t seem phased by the newcomers. "I love you, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Me too, my wife," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Naomi Wildcow?" Tach asked with grin that proved he had his own soft
spot.</P>
<P>"I have a friend, a child. She was my family on board our ship," Seven
explained. "Her name is Naomi Wildman. The calf looks like her. Well, it
resembles her…slightly."</P>
<P>Nara sat up. "Tach, you best not be bringing home any ‘honey red’ hides or
I’ll string you up myself."</P>
<P>"Yes, dear," he said. He looked over at B’Elanna. "Will you show me exactly
what a ‘honey red’ cow is?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and rested her chin on Seven’s shoulder. It occurred to her
that her life on this prison planet seemed more full and rewarding than being
Chief Engineer ever had, although if they ever got back to <I>Voyager</I>, she
knew her life would be just as full. It wasn’t the planet, or mountain air, or
even the new friendly couple. Her life was full because of the woman she held in
her arms, and nothing would ever change that.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Captain Janeway was tired of waiting. The Overseer had promised her that the
all-powerful "Magistrate" would arrive soon but it wasn’t fast enough for
Janeway. The Magistrate was due in three days, but Kathryn decided she would
have her crewmembers long before that.</P>
<P>"Tuvok, you’re with me," Janeway said as she came out of her ready room.
"Chakotay, you have the bridge. I’m going over there and I’m not coming back
until I have news about B’Elanna and Seven." She didn’t wait for a response and
Tuvok had to rush to make it to the turbolift with her.</P>
<P>Chakotay nodded. He had already argued with the fiery redheaded captain,
trying to convince her to just wait until the Magistrate arrived, but she didn’t
agree. He looked down at Tom Paris who was obviously concerned as well and the
two men sighed in unison.</P>
<P>Janeway and Tuvok waited at the airlock for their escort. They had been
traveling the corridors everyday to appeal to the Overseer to allow a visit, but
so far she had not agreed. Janeway had seen several groups of prisoners being
led to battlecruisers that always disappeared into the nebula. She had decided
to take <I>Voyager</I> into the nebula and retrieve her lost crewmembers if she
didn’t get satisfaction soon.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway," the tall guard said as he opened the air lock. "I will
take you to the Overseer’s office."</P>
<P>"Malok, isn’t it?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," he said, shifting his weight.</P>
<P>"I keep seeing prisoners leaving, but none arriving. Why is that?" Janeway
walked alongside the giant of a man while Tuvok seemed almost bored as he
followed behind her. Tuvok’s expression was impassive, but behind his dark eyes
he was noticing every detail of the space station, from the leaking pipe near
the airlock to the fact that Malok’s boots needed a shine.</P>
<P>Malok glanced around before speaking. "The prisoners arrive at a different
docking ring, near the medical facility."</P>
<P>"Why would they need a medical facility? Doesn’t the prison have doctors on
staff?" she asked. She was well aware that a guard should not be sharing any
tactical information, and that this man was probably risking his job or worse.
She waited for his answer, figuring that if he was going to answer, he would do
so when he felt safe.</P>
<P>They walked awhile longer then Malok paused and looked at a small atrium that
most likely helped process the station’s air supply. Janeway stood next to him,
waiting.</P>
<P>"Jusari Prime is not exactly a prison," he said quietly.</P>
<P>Janeway nodded, keeping her face calm.</P>
<P>"Prisoners are released in two main cities and must fend for themselves," he
said.</P>
<P>"And the medical facilities?" she asked.</P>
<P>"There are none on the planet. After retrieval, prisoners are checked for any
illness and their genetic markers and universal translators are removed. We use
the markers to track and retrieve the prisoners." Malok turned away and watched
as another guard approached and passed by. Janeway said nothing.</P>
<P>"The doctors are very conscientious," Malok said. "They also handle placing
the children."</P>
<P>"Children?" Janeway asked, truly confused.</P>
<P>Malok turned and faced her. "It is my people’s greatest shame, Captain. The
violent criminals are given life sentences, and they become…predatory. Many of
the women return with children. We place the ones the mothers do not wish to
raise and terminate any unwanted conceptions."</P>
<P>All the color drained from Janeway’s face and she actually felt lightheaded.
"You send women down there to be preyed upon?" she asked, her voice
cracking.</P>
<P>He looked down, unable to meet her eyes. "There are not many women sent to
Jusari Prime. Our own citizens are not sent there except for heinous crimes, and
there are not many female travelers in our space."</P>
<P>Janeway glared at Malok, her eyes completely grey. "So you won’t put your own
people in harms way, but you send others into hell?"</P>
<P>"As I said, my people are ashamed. The Magistrate began this new system
seventy five years ago. It has cut down on crime and it is cost effective," he
said quietly. </P>
<P>"Cost effective?" Janeway demanded in a harsh whisper to avoid being
overheard. "I want my people out of there, now. What kind of monsters allow this
to go on?"</P>
<P>"Most citizens know nothing of the actual horrors of Jusari Prime." His
expression was pained. "Those who work here are born to it. We have no choice.
If I were to leave, I would be captured and sent to Jusari Prime for life."</P>
<P>"How do I get my people out of there?"</P>
<P>"I cannot help you," he said. "I do what I can to help the prisoners."</P>
<P>"How? By apologizing for dooming them?" Janeway said. Her voice was more
snarl than speech.</P>
<P>"I look the other way, leave a restraint a little too loose, accidentally
send the nonviolent offenders off course away from the city," he explained.</P>
<P>"What about my people?" Janeway looked down the corridor at a small group
that was approaching. Four guards were dragging two men in shackles.</P>
<P>Malok began walking with Tuvok and Janeway flanking him on either side. "Your
people seemed resourceful," he said. "The golden haired one complained of an arm
injury and asked me to loosen her restraint, but I do not think she was injured.
I… agreed to loosen the restraint." With that he was silent, and walked quickly
to the Overseer’s office.</P>
<P>Janeway was beyond angry. She was horrified at what her away team might be
going through and furious with herself for not demanding their release sooner.
She only hoped B’Elanna and Seven had been able to hold there own so far<I>. "A
few days… they’re both strong. They can keep themselves safe for a few
days,"</I> she told herself, but inside she wasn’t convinced.</P>
<P>Once they reached the office Malok leaned closer to Janeway. "There is more,"
he whispered. "But to reveal it means certain death. Find out about the planet,
study it."</P>
<P>Janeway moved closer. "What am I looking for?" she asked, wondering what
other horrors could be worse than what he had already revealed.</P>
<P>"Hurry," he said and then marched back down the corridor leaving Janeway at
the Overseer’s office under the supervision of the two guards at the door.</P>
