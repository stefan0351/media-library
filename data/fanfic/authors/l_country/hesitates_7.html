<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Seven: New Feelings -->

<P>Two months passed, and B’Elanna and Seven fell into a familiar routine. They
woke up with the sun and had breakfast together, talking about their thoughts
about dozens of topics. B’Elanna would go out and hunt for game, usually small
rabbit-like animals that had tiny round ears and long hind legs. They would eat
the rabbits as fresh meat, and about once every two weeks B’Elanna would hike
out to the meadow to take down one of the ‘cows.’ The herd had stayed away from
the cabin once they discovered the two humanoids were predators, but there were
six large herds that roamed the valley. All of them came down each morning to
drink from the lake and graze in the huge meadow. B’Elanna would kill and dress
the animal and then Seven would come to help her bring the meat back. It took
almost an entire week to dry the meat and even longer to tan the hide, but most
of the labor involved slicing the meat and hanging it. After that, they only had
to turn the meat while it smoked in the large shack that B’Elanna had built just
for curing the meat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven spent the early mornings collecting nuts and working with the various
barleys and wheats she had harvested from the surrounding valley. She was using
her own nanoprobes to bio-engineer a hardier plant with a fast rate of maturity,
unfortunately, it still took far too long for her. In the afternoon, Seven would
spend a few hours regenerating with the modified power converter. The solar
panel didn’t provide as much energy as her alcove on board <I>Voyager </I>had,
but it also didn’t have to power a comm station and a full database like her
station on the ship had. She was taking in more and more energy from food, and
the regeneration only had to power her Borg implants, but B’Elanna still checked
the power converter everyday to make sure it was working at peak efficiency. The
Klingon also made a point of finding something to do at the Homestead while
Seven was regenerating. She was never more than ten feet away from her companion
while she was unconscious during the process. Even though they had set up the
small device inside the cabin near the hearth, she wasn’t going to risk Seven
being attacked.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Each day the two women grew closer, they had not moved into a sexual
relationship yet they had become increasingly more comfortable with each other.
B’Elanna had never considered herself an overly affectionate person, but she
found herself drawn to Seven in a way that was completely new. Anytime she was
around the lanky blonde she felt the need to touch her. Seven seemed to feel the
same way, constantly touching B’Elanna’s waist when she eased past her in the
confines of the cabin, or just wrapping her arms around her from behind when
they would watch the sun set. B’Elanna felt cherished, and it was a new and
welcome feeling, one she never had the entire time she had dated Tom.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Seven said as she came out of the cabin. She walked over and
sat next to B’Elanna on the long bench they had set up looking out over the
valley. Their bodies seemed drawn together, Seven’s leg pressing against
B’Elanna’s as soon as she relaxed.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is," B’Elanna said and leaned against her companion. </P>
<P>Seven wrapped her arm around B’Elanna and leaned over and kissed her temple.
"Are you going hunting?" </P>
<P>"I was thinking about taking a day off." B’Elanna snuggled into the embrace
and ran her hand over Seven’s top. It was made of leather from one of the cows,
the golden colored suede a pleasant contrast to Seven’s pale skin that peeked
through the leather laced opening. Seven’s biosuit had not survived her
encounter with the large bear.</P>
<P>"I have been perfecting the barley," Seven said. "I believe I have solved the
problem of the extended growing season. Perhaps you would like to assist me?"
Seven asked. The truth was that she loved spending time with B’Elanna no matter
what they were doing.</P>
<P>"I’d like that," B’Elanna said and then kissed Seven on the cheek. "Maybe
later we can go on a picnic."</P>
<P>"Acceptable." Seven blushed, something B’Elanna found endearing. "I have
altered the dermal regenerator, I think I may be able to use it to accelerate
the growth of the barley."</P>
<P>"Really?" B’Elanna thought the idea was brilliant. "So can we look forward to
some Borg barley for breakfast soon?" </P>
<P>Seven smiled, she had grown comfortable enough with her companion and herself
to engage in gentle teasing. "Perhaps, if you behave yourself. Otherwise I will
be forced to eat it myself."</P>
<P>"Lucky Barley," B’Elanna said and stood up. She turned and offered her hand
to Seven and helped her up.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and lead the way to the makeshift nursery she had set up near
the curing shed.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The dermal regenerator ending up working better than either had expected. By
lunchtime they had a six by twelve-foot area of barley that was ready for
harvest. Seven was leaning over the barley waving the regenerator over the
shorter stalks, deeply concentrating on providing the perfect amount of
assistance to the smaller plants.</P>
<P>"Hey, time for lunch," B’Elanna said as she wrapped her arms around Seven’s
waist. Seven shifted to one side causing them both to tumble into the waist high
barley.</P>
<P>"You are <I>not</I> behaving yourself," Seven said as she rolled over and
pinned B’Elanna to the ground.</P>
<P>"Did I tell you how brilliant I think using that regenerator is?" B’Elanna
pulled Seven’s full weight onto her enjoying the intimate press.</P>
<P>"Four times." Seven smiled.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna stared up into Seven’s eyes; they were dark blue and
sparkling the way they always did when she looked at B’Elanna. It was a color no
one on <I>Voyager</I> would recognize since it was her passion for the Klingon
that had darkened them. </P>
<P>"Yes?" Seven was lost in B’Elanna’s deep brown eyes.</P>
<P>"I love you," she whispered uncertainly, terrified she was rushing Seven.</P>
<P>Seven’s lips trembled, and her eyes began to tear up. "I love you, too." She
leaned down and kissed B’Elanna with complete abandon. Soon they had rolled over
and smashed the rest of the barley.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed as she picked a stray piece of barley out of her mouth, not
quite knowing how it got there. "We’re crushing all your hard work."</P>
<P>"I do not care," Seven said as she continued kissing B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Okay, this is one way to bring in a harvest." She rolled Seven over and
began unlacing her top, eager to reach her full breasts. Her hands were shaking,
making it difficult to loosen the leather laces, but finally she was able to
slide her hand through the opening. The leather was soft and the earthy smell
filled her nostrils, but Seven’s skin was softer. B’Elanna moaned when she felt
her lover’s breast heavy in her hand and warmed by the contact with the
leather.</P>
<P>Seven arched into B’Elanna’s hand wanting to increase the contact.
"B’Elanna," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Call me Lana," she answered as she squeezed Seven’s breast and kissed her
throat.</P>
<P>"Lana…" Seven smiled, liking the way the shortened name sounded. She moved
her hands down B’Elanna’s back and began lifting her shirt. Their kissing
continued and Seven managed to get her hands under the thin fabric of B’Elanna’s
tank top, her hands migrating to her breasts. </P>
<P>"Inside…cabin," B’Elanna gasped. "Now."</P>
<P>Seven didn’t seem convinced and she continued her gentle massage of
B’Elanna’s breasts. When B’Elanna sat up, Seven seized the moment and tore off
the Klingon’s shirt and took her bra covered nipple in her mouth and pressed
B’Elanna back down into the fresh barley.</P>
<P>"Oh, god." B’Elanna guided Seven’s hands to her bra and they tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>Seven stared openly at her lover and then began kissing her hardening
nipples.</P>
<P>"Inside the cabin," B’Elanna said even as she moaned at the contact. She was
a romantic, but the barley was poking through her pants distracting her, and she
didn’t want any distractions when they made love for the first time.</P>
<P>Seven pulled back, her eyes wild and darting over B’Elanna’s exposed body.
She took the half-Klingon into her arms and carried her to the cabin continually
kissing her neck.</P>
<P>Once in the cabin, Seven kicked the door shut and let B’Elanna down. She
turned to lock the door and felt B’Elanna tugging at her top. Seven turned back,
smiled at her shorter lover, then peeled off the leather shirt.</P>
<P>"You’re beautiful," B’Elanna whispered. She moved closer until their bare
chests came together with an almost electric touch. "I love you," she whispered
into Seven’s mouth as their tongues met. They stumbled to the bedroom and
B’Elanna eased Seven down onto the pile of blankets and furs and crawled down
beside her. </P>
<P>"‘Lana, I… I want to…" Seven was shaking and looked down at the blankets.
"But, I…"</P>
<P>"What is it?" B’Elanna asked as she took Seven’s face in her hands.</P>
<P>"I do not have any experience with…" Seven looked back down at the blankets
and blushed.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and caressed her lover’s cheek. "There’s no hurry. We can go
as slowly as you like."</P>
<P>Seven gave B’Elanna a frustrated glare. "I do not wish to go slowly. I am
simply unsure of how to proceed."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna laughed. "We can take care of that, darling."</P>
<P>"Darling?"</P>
<P>"It’s a term of endearment. Is it all right?" B’Elanna looked shyly at her
lover.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is." Seven leaned over and kissed B’Elanna and let her hands roam.
"Show me what to do."</P>
<P>"You’re doing fine," B’Elanna said with a whimper. "Just keep touching me."
B’Elanna let her body collapse onto the blankets and held her arms out to
Seven.</P>
<P>"I will." Seven climbed onto her and began kissing her neck. They continued
to explore each other for several minutes until their remaining clothes became
problematic.</P>
<P>"Clothes off. Now," ordered B’Elanna. She tugged off her pants and then
helped Seven out of hers. </P>
<P>"Now what?" Seven rolled onto her back and looked up at B’Elanna.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned over and straddled Seven, resting her weight on her hands and
staring down at her. "We make love," she said as she lowered her weight onto
Seven’s body. They continued kissing until B’Elanna eased off to the side and
began caressing Seven’s chest and making her way down to her belly.</P>
<P>"Show me, Lana," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and placed it on her own breast, demonstrating how
she liked to be touched. Seven was a fast learner and soon her mouth joined her
hands. After a few maddening moments B’Elanna edged her lover onto her back
again and began guiding Seven’s legs apart. Seven rolled her head on the pillow
and moaned, her legs spreading of their own accord.</P>
<P>"Like this," B’Elanna whispered. She ran her fingers down and over Seven’s
belly, alternating between gentle touches and a slow scraping of her fingernails
over Seven’s muscled abdomen. Every few passes she would detour to let her
fingers tangle in the blonde thatch of hair between her lover’s legs and then
return to her belly. The entire time, her lips traveled from Seven’s mouth to
her neck and then down to her breasts. Finally, when Seven’s nipples were
painfully erect, B’Elanna let her hand slip down to her lover’s thigh and slowly
moved back toward her center. </P>
<P>Seven’s breathing was coming in ragged breaths and she was alternating
between whimpers and moans, not knowing what her body was craving, but certain
that B’Elanna was the only one who could provide it.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered. "Lana…" she felt lightheaded, like she was leaving
her body, which at the moment was the last thing she wanted to do. Right now her
body was feeling things she hadn’t known existed and she wanted to be there for
the entire experience.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna whispered into her ear. She kissed Seven’s cheek and
then nipped at her throat. "Right here. Are you ready?" B’Elanna asked as she
let her fingers caress Seven’s opening. The moisture she found flowing from her
lover answered her question. "Oh, yeah, you’re ready."</P>
<P>"Yes… I do not know <I>what</I> I am ready for…but I <I>know</I> I am ready,"
Seven said between gasps. She was panting, arching her back each time B’Elanna
kissed or touched her. </P>
<P>The Klingon laughed, deep and throaty, and pressed Seven’s hips back onto the
blankets. She leaned up and kissed Seven tenderly as her fingers dipped into the
waiting wetness. She was like molten slick velvet, her labia swollen and
saturated. </P>
<P>"Yes, <I>that</I>," Seven yelled. "I am ready for <I>that</I>." Her legs
trembled as B’Elanna circled her with loving sweetness.</P>
<P>"You feel so good, Seven," B’Elanna said between kisses.</P>
<P>Seven could only whimper in response and turn to kiss B’Elanna again. She dug
her willowy hands into B’Elanna’s thick sable hair, trying to deepen the kiss
even more. B’Elanna growled into her mouth and tugged at her lip as she pulled
away and looked into her cobalt blue eyes.</P>
<P>"No," Seven begged, trying to pull B’Elanna back to her mouth.</P>
<P>"I want to look at you." B’Elanna had tears filling her passion darkened
eyes.</P>
<P>Seven nodded and looked up at her lover as she felt B’Elanna enter her. "Oh,"
Seven moaned, her eyelids drooping as she felt herself filled for the first
time. "Lana, I love you." She continued moaning, her voice rising with each
thrust. Their eyes remained locked and Seven felt her own hot tears sliding down
her cheeks and a power was building inside her toward some unknown focus. Then,
she knew she was there, her body stiffened and she felt her breath leave her
body and her muscles seemed to be warring with each other, torn between
clenching to keep B’Elanna inside her and shaking her into a million tiny
pieces.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt Seven gripping her fingers and felt the rush of moisture as her
lover climaxed. She continued her caress, lightening the contact as she guided
Seven through another peak, then slowed and let her come down. Seven went limp,
as if her bones had been tossed aside and B’Elanna eased out of her and gathered
her into her arms, snuggling down on her chest and showering her skin with
fleeting kisses.</P>
<P>They lay in their cabin, covered in sweat, gasping as they fought for their
hearts to slow. B’Elanna clung to Seven, not wanting to lose the connection with
the woman who held her twin hearts.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven finally managed to ask, her voice hoarse and rasping.</P>
<P>"Yes, love?" B’Elanna asked without lifting her head from its warm resting
place on Seven’s breast.</P>
<P>"Thank you, for loving me." </P>
<P>B’Elanna felt Seven’s chest begin to shake, and she lifted her head to see
that the one-time Borg was sobbing. She shifted her weight so that she could
stroke Seven’s cheek with the back of her hand. "What’s wrong?"</P>
<P>Seven shook her head, smiling through the tears. "Nothing."</P>
<P>"Oh, darling." B’Elanna laughed and kissed each of Seven’s eyes, savoring the
salt. "I love you."</P>
<P>Seven slid to the side and positioned B’Elanna on her back. "I want to love
you." She kissed B’Elanna torturously with gentle, soft kisses that she didn’t
deepen, teasing the Klingon until she was growling like the bear she had killed
months earlier. </P>
<P>"Please," B’Elanna begged.</P>
<P>Seven smiled into another kiss, then pulled back. "I am glad you are the
first, the only one I will ever love this way." </P>
<P>It was a promise of monogamy that B’Elanna had not asked for, but one she
would be eternally grateful for, because in that moment she knew she had given
her soul to Seven. She had never understood the Klingon rituals that swore
eternity to a partner after making love, but now she did. She realized that she
had never made love until this very day with Seven and she knew she would never
touch anyone else or be touched by another because Seven owned both Klingon
hearts beating inside her chest.</P>
<P>"You are the only one," B’Elanna said, her voice breaking. "I am yours,
Seven. I pray to Kahless you never tire of me, because no one but you will ever
touch my soul again."</P>
<P>"Tai be’nal?" Seven whispered. It was a benediction and a request, the
Klingon term meaning, "honored wife?" When uttered during love making it was a
promise of love beyond the grave and a request for your partner’s pledge in
return.</P>
<P>"HIja’ epetai-zana," B’Elanna answered without hesitation, telling Seven "It
is true Honored and exalted one," in Klingonese. The response meant that she
belong to Seven forever. </P>
<P>Seven kissed her and then eased away and turned her cheek to B’Elanna for the
ritual bite, but B’Elanna shook her head.</P>
<P>"Never pain, my wife." B’Elanna then kissed her on the cheek instead of
sinking her teeth into her flesh. "I will spill my last drop of blood to prevent
you from shedding even a drop of blood or a single tear in pain."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and reached up and turned B’Elanna’s cheek toward her and
pressed her lips to the tender flesh and left a lingering kiss in place of a
bite. "I will never hurt you, B’Elanna," Seven promised. "If I had a god to pray
to, I would thank him…or her…for bringing me to this planet with you."</P>
<P>"Even if <I>Voyager</I> never comes for us, I will thank Kahless everyday for
giving me this time with you." B’Elanna pulled Seven on top of her and their
kisses deepened as Seven began to love B’Elanna as she had been loved, but she
had a been a Borg, so it was her goal to improve on the perfection of B’Elanna’s
touch. They spent the rest of the day and night learning ways to bring each
other to heights of passion unknown to either woman before. The animals of the
valley heard new cries that night and more than one beast looked out into the
night wondering what predator had such fierce cries.</P>
