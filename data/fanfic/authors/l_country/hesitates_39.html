<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 39: Together again -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway waited as the turbolift took her back to the bridge. The
Doctor and Opaca had examined Tach and B’Elanna thoroughly, finding them both
healthy. When Kathryn, Seven and B’Elanna had arrived at the orchard, Nara had
been hugging Tach, crying as she checked him for injuries. She took one look at
B’Elanna and rushed to her and gave her a kiss on the lips. B’Elanna had allowed
it, but her eyes drifted over to Seven who was shaking her head and smiling
indulgently. Nara had been so excited that she proceeded to kiss Seven as well.
Tach had then commented that he was missing out, and to everyone’s surprise,
Seven had kissed him on the cheek and hugged him. Ty slept through it all,
curled up under an apple tree.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The turbolift doors opened and Kathryn paused in the doorway. On screen was
Nador Omega, the side that they had taken refuge behind during the meteor storm.
She could see the continent below on the surface, but just barely. The
atmosphere was clogged with smoke and debris, and seemed to be thickening as she
watched. More startling was that the space over the planet was packed with ships
of every size. It looked like a Ferengi used shuttle lot.</P>
<P>"Commander," Janeway said as she entered the bridge. "What do we have
here?"</P>
<P>"Captain, welcome back." He turned and smiled warmly and moved to his own
chair. "How are Tach and B’Elanna?"</P>
<P>"Very well," she responded as she sat in her chair. "What’s all this?" She
motioned to the screen.</P>
<P>"The Narians are abandoning the planet," Chakotay said and his smile faded.
"They got word from Sha’Lar. The government wants them to migrate to Nador
Three. It’s about three months away."</P>
<P>"They’re giving up?" she asked incredulously.</P>
<P>"Apparently they don’t have a choice. They have some self-governing capacity,
but they are still a colony of Sha’Lar." Chakotay rubbed the tattoo over his eye
and his frown deepened.</P>
<P>"I can’t imagine that making the settlers very happy." Kathryn watched the
ships carefully maneuvering around each other.</P>
<P>Tuvok shifted his weight. "The Stellar Guard informed us that three more
phaser cannons were destroyed by meteor strikes," the tall Vulcan explained. "It
is only a matter of time before the planet returns to its state before
colonization."</P>
<P>"Have you told Tach and Nara?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"No," Chakotay said as he studied the carpet in front of his chair. "I
thought I’d leave that to you. Betoc, Tach’s friend from the Stellar Guard,
asked to come on board as soon as he gets the evacuees settled. They’re setting
up a synchronous orbit to keep the ships away from the meteors."</P>
<P>"Make him feel welcome," Kathryn said quietly. "I wish we could have helped
more."</P>
<P>"We were only delaying the inevitable," Tuvok pointed out. "Their phaser
cannons would have failed no matter what we did. Even if Lieutenant Torres and
Tach had been successful in repairing the damaged station, the planetary net
still would have failed."</P>
<P>"Let’s not mention that to Tach or Lieutenant Torres," Janeway said
pointedly.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Hurry up," Tach said as he paced the living room of the VIP quarters. "Betoc
will be here any minute." He went over to the couch. "Come out of there, my
little terror." He gently took Ty by the leg and lifted him out from behind the
couch, dangling him in the air. Ty laughed and swung his weight from side to
side.</P>
<P>"Fa, more," Ty squealed when Tach put him down.</P>
<P>"Oh no, you stay out of there while I go check on your Mother." Tach walked
back to the small bedroom and paused when he saw Nara. She was sitting on the
bed hugging her arms to her chest and was crying. "Hey," Tach whispered as he
knelt beside her. "What’s wrong?"</P>
<P>She inhaled deeply and shook her head, then grabbed him and hugged him. "I
almost lost you, you stupid old goat."</P>
<P>"But you didn’t," he said as she held her.</P>
<P>"I thought I did. Don’t you ever do anything like that again…or I’ll kill you
myself." Nara leaned back and cupped his chin in her hand. "You are my sacred
bondmate…how was I supposed to tell our son about that bond without you
around?"</P>
<P>"Shh…" He wiped the tears from her cheeks. "Our son will grow up seeing what
love is."</P>
<P>"Promise me?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Always." He leaned forward and rubbed his thick forehead against hers.</P>
<P>"Fa," Ty said proudly. "Ty fix padd."</P>
<P>Tach turned, and Nara wrapped him from behind with her arms resting over his
broad shoulders. Ty held out what was left of a data padd. He had somehow
removed the back panel and gutted it.</P>
<P>"Your son seems to have a knack for that." Nara kissed the back of Tach’s
neck. "He dismantled the clock this morning while you were off playing on that
meteor."</P>
<P>"Playing?" Tach shook his head. He held out his hand to his son. "Let’s have
a look at your project, Ty." The toddler ran to his father and handed over his
treasure. Tach inspected it carefully grunting and humming as he made note of
each dangling piece of wire hanging out of the device. "You’ve done a wonderful
job," he assured the child. "But from now on…let me handle fixing the data
padds, okay?"</P>
<P>Ty nodded and hugged his father.</P>
<P>"Was it awful?" Nara asked.</P>
<P>"No worse than any other meteor I’ve beamed onto." Tach squeezed his son,
reveling in the warmth of his tiny body. "It was damn cold, and I thought
B’Elanna was going wring my neck."</P>
<P>"Were you scared, husband?" she whispered as she nuzzled his neck.</P>
<P>"Terrified. We barely got to the beam out area in time. We had already lost
our atmosphere, and the computer from the ship picked up the incoming meteor so
it beamed us out." He let Ty go and the boy sprinted off in search of something
else to fix. Tach turned to face Nara. "We beamed onto a good size meteor, so it
had its own gravity, but it was weak. We had to tie off…and let me tell you,
being tied to B’Elanna for nine hours isn’t exactly a pleasant experience."</P>
<P>"She was worried about Seven, wasn’t she?" Nara asked as she tucked his
graying hair behind his ears.</P>
<P>"Yes." He closed his eyes and rested his head on Nara’s chest. "We waited, we
couldn’t call for help because the impact with the station sent out an
electromagnetic pulse… it knocked out our comm systems." He wrapped his arms
around her. "It took us an hour just to get communications between our suits,
and let me tell you, I think I learned every curse in Klingon and Human."</P>
<P>"English," Nara corrected. "Neelix informed me that the Starfleet standard
language is English… but, yes…it is from Earth."</P>
<P>"Whatever it’s called, it is a…colorful language. Since we hadn’t been
rescued right away, we knew that <I>Voyager</I> probably thought we were dead."
Tach pulled back. "She was worried about Seven, and I swear, if the Stellar
Guard hadn’t found us, I think B’Elanna would have jumped off of that meteor and
flown back to <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"She probably would have made it, too," Nara said with a half grin.</P>
<P>"Come on, Betoc is waiting," Tach said as he climbed to his feet. "We have to
find out what the Minister wants us to do."</P>
<P>"I don’t know why the Minister of Sha’Lar should have any say in our
decisions." Nara stood and tugged at her skirt hem. "We’ve been doing just fine
without them for almost 80 years."</P>
<P>"I know, but they’ve been trying to get control of our colony for at least 75
of those years." Tach wrapped his arm around her and held her to his side as
they walked out to the living area. "The Minister will probably get reelected
because of our triumphant return to the civilized sector."</P>
<P>"Ha, civilized… the people of Sha’Lar don’t know what that even means." Nara
bumped him with her hip. "Nador Three isn’t much better."</P>
<P>"You’ve never even been there…or Sha’Lar for that matter," Tach said "But we
will not be moving to Sha’Lar, that you can be sure of."</P>
<P>"Are you kidding? They wouldn’t even let me on the planet." Nara looked
around for Ty but didn’t see him. "Now…where’s your son?"</P>
<P>They heard a crash, and turned to Ty standing on a chair he had scooted over
to the replicator. He had Tach’s toolbox at his feet and was prying the front
panel from the wall.</P>
<P>"Tyranlanar!" Nara yelled as she ran toward him.</P>
<P>"Ty fix," he said with a satisfied smile. He pointed to a pile of various
foods splattered on the floor.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna stood at one end of the conference room table waiting for
the rest of the group to arrive. They had been taking a walk in the new orchard
and left when it became too crowded. For the moment they had the huge room to
themselves.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said, chastising her wife. She looked at the door as she
trapped Seven’s wandering hands just as she was about to reach her nipples.
"What are you doing? This place is gonna’ be crawling with people in a half
hour."</P>
<P>"Thirty-nine minutes," Seven corrected as she lifted B’Elanna and sat her on
the table and then began kissing her neck. She still needed assurance that she
had B’Elanna back, and for Seven that meant tasting her skin.</P>
<P>"Someone could walk in any second," B’Elanna said even as her body responded.
"Oh god," she whispered when Seven nibbled on her throat. "We can’t do this."
Her legs came up and wrapped around Seven’s waist. Both women were consummate
professionals, but Seven seemed to need proof that she wasn’t dreaming, that
B’Elanna was in her arms.</P>
<P>"Thirty-seven minutes," Seven said as she pressed against her wife. Her hands
moved across the Klingon’s chest, stopping when she reached her breasts. "Kiss
me," Seven ordered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked over Seven’s shoulder at the door and then pulled her closer.
Their lips met in a heated press as Seven’s caresses focused on the pebbled nubs
forming under B’Elanna’s uniform tunic. She circled her wife’s hardening
nipples, smiling into the kiss when B’Elanna began to whimper.</P>
<P>"Stop," B’Elanna begged as she eased back to get a breath. "We can’t do this
in here and you’re making me crazy," she said but then leaned back and grabbed
Seven and pulled her back to her mouth. Her legs squeezed Seven, grinding their
bodies together. "Oh… we don’t have time to do this," she whimpered. She reached
into Seven’s blouse and moaned when she felt the warm weight of her wife’s
breast.</P>
<P>Seven tossed her head back and bit her lip to keep from crying out and then
put her hands over B’Elanna’s. "I almost lost you…I just need to feel your
touch, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Well… now I need a whole lot more than that," B’Elanna said with a growl.
She used her legs to yank Seven closer. </P>
<P>Their lips met, it was fast and hard, and the passion ignited as their
tongues dueled. Seven lifted B’Elanna up and then climbed onto the table, laying
the Klingon across the hard, simulated wooden surface. She straddled the shorter
woman and leaned down, but her belly got in the way. She rested her weight on
one arm and began exploring with the other. B’Elanna’s legs tangled with her
lanky wife’s as they each battled to vanquish their earlier fears. B’Elanna felt
the warmth of Seven’s hardening nipple under her fingers just as they heard the
whoosh of the doors.</P>
<P>Tuvok cleared his throat as he stood in the doorway. "I do not believe that
was the intended use for that particular piece of furniture," the Vulcan
stated.</P>
<P>"Oh geeze," B’Elanna said as she tried to move her wife off of her. Seven
slowly disengaged from B’Elanna and climbed off of her and then helped her down
from the table.</P>
<P>"Commander Tuvok, you are early," Seven stated as she buttoned her
blouse.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Tuvok raised one eyebrow. "Perhaps you lost track of time. The
meeting begins in twenty-one point two minutes. It is standard procedure to do a
security check before allowing the captain to meet with foreign
dignitaries."</P>
<P>B’Elanna blushed furiously as she turned her back and tried to pull her tunic
down. It was tangled with her bra, which had been pushed up above her breasts.
"Can’t you wait outside?" she asked. She realized she couldn’t get the tunic
back into place because her hands were shaking. </P>
<P>"Commander?" Seven nodded at him. He turned around while she went to her
wife. "Hold still," Seven said as she untangled the fabric. Her fingers glanced
across the hardened nipples and B’Elanna gave her a glare that Janeway would
have been proud of. Seven merely smirked in response. "There, you are
presentable," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Wait." B’Elanna tucked Seven’s blouse into her slacks. Seven’s belly was too
big for her to comfortably wear her biosuit, and when she was officially off
duty she chose the more comfortable slacks. "There," B’Elanna said once the
willowy blonde was mostly dressed. She heard the door hiss again and shook her
head. "I can’t believe I let you do that," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Tuvok," Janeway said as she went to the table. "Our guest should be beaming
over. I thought we should accompany him personally." She looked at B’Elanna and
tilted her head to the side. She noticed the deep red color on her chief
engineer’s face. "Ladies, how are you?"</P>
<P>"Fine, ma’am," B’Elanna said a bit too quickly.</P>
<P>"We are…well," Seven added.</P>
<P>"Well?" Janeway asked with a knowing glance. "It looks like you two have a
bit of extra…energy. Perhaps you could work on my ready room when we finish
here?"</P>
<P>"Sure," B’Elanna said. She went to the table and pulled out a chair for
Seven. "Why don’t you sit. Save your energy for later."</P>
<P>Seven slid into the chair, pausing to smile at her wife. "I have plenty of
energy," she whispered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna sat at the table waiting for Janeway and Tuvok to return.
Seven had tried to convince B’Elanna that a few kisses were in order, but the
Klingon wasn’t about to get caught necking in the conference room…twice. Unknown
to B’Elanna or her amorous wife, Tuvok had used the walk to the Transporter Room
to give the captain a detailed report of the new use Torres and Seven had
discovered for the table.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said without looking at her wife. "Don’t even think it."</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked innocently.</P>
<P>"You were about to kiss my neck," B’Elanna said as she spun her chair and
looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"I was merely checking to see that your hair was in place," Seven said. She
was standing close to B’Elanna, and had in fact been ready to kiss her neck
before her wife had turned the chair around. "Besides, I missed you, Be’nal,"
Seven said as she gave B’Elanna her most pitiful pout.</P>
<P>"You can just keep missing me until we are in our quarters," B’Elanna said.
She leaned back and used her foot to playfully move her wife away.</P>
<P>"And if I do not wish to wait?" Seven grabbed her wife’s foot.</P>
<P>The doors opened saving B’Elanna from a fate far better than death, probably
more like heaven, and the captain led a small group into the room. B’Elanna
stood and quickly sidestepped to avoid Seven’s grasp.</P>
<P>"Betoc," Janeway said as she went to the head of the table. "This is
Lieutenant B’Elanna Torres, my Chief Engineer, and Seven of Nine, my
Astrometrics officer."</P>
<P>"A pleasure to meet you," he said as he moved to sit next to Janeway.</P>
<P>Tach was next to Tuvok. "B’Elanna is the one who helped me on the station,"
the Narian said. "She is my Fas’na, and Seven is her wife."</P>
<P>Betoc paused, then smiled. He went to B’Elanna and offered his hands.
"Welcome, Fas’na. Tach is a supreme pain in the backside, but I hope you will
not hold that against me."</P>
<P>Nara moved up beside Tach and wrapped her arm around his waist. "Betoc is our
Fas’fa. He is the brother we invited to our family the same way we did you,"
Nara said to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Is this a family reunion?" Seven asked as she sat.</P>
<P>"No," Betoc said with a laugh. "And you are correct, we should get down to
the matters at hand."</P>
<P>"What can we do for you?" Janeway asked. "I understand that your people have
decided to leave Nador Omega."</P>
<P>"We did not make that decision," Betoc said as he sat. He looked around the
table as Nara and Tach sat next to Tuvok. "The Minister of Sha’lar decided for
us. We are a colony, and while we were considering asking for independence
before this tragedy, we are in no position to bargain now."</P>
<P>"Can you stay? Try to rebuild with terra-forming?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"That would be difficult," Tach answered. "Most of our industrialized areas
were destroyed. We don’t have any means to repair the damaged phaser cannons,
and certainly no way to build new ones."</P>
<P>"We’ve been ordered to immigrate to Nador Three. It’s close, and they have a
good sized population willing to accept us," Betoc said. He clenched his fists
and his face darkened. "That is one of the problems."</P>
<P>"I don’t understand," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Betoc? What have you heard?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"Our colony, though small, has produced some of the greatest minds our people
have ever seen," Betoc explained to Janeway. "And as you know," he said to Tach,
"They have been trying to get our children to go to Sha’lar for schooling, at
least to the university."</P>
<P>"Yes, and they’d have our children brainwashed before they ever reached
Sha’lar," Nara said bitterly. "A three year trip through space to teach them how
to be good citizens, and then off to the University for indoctrination."</P>
<P>"Is that what they want now?" Kathryn leaned forward.</P>
<P>"No," Betoc said. He looked down at the table, unwilling to meet Tach’s
eyes.</P>
<P>"They want the children now?" Seven demanded. She slammed her fist onto the
table. "No, they cannot have Ty. I will not allow it."</P>
<P>"Easy." B’Elanna covered Seven’s clenched fist. "Tach and Nara will handle
this."</P>
<P>"We won’t send our child off to be raised by strangers," Nara said
firmly.</P>
<P>"They don’t want that," Betoc said as he finally raised his head. "Tach can
keep his son."</P>
<P>"Thank the goddess." Tach let out a sigh of relief. </P>
<P>"Tach, it’s worse." Betoc looked over at Nara. "The Minister is invoking the
ancient rule. He says that the best of our people’s… family lines have been
concentrated on Nador Omega, that the best scientists were sent here originally
and that it’s time we…corrected that mistake."</P>
<P>"No," Nara said. "He can’t be serious. There hasn’t been genetic reassignment
in a hundred years."</P>
<P>"They wouldn’t ask that of us," Tach said as he gripped Nara’s hand. "It’s
barbaric."</P>
<P>"They can and they are," Betoc said. "When we reach Nador Three, we will be
reassigned. Of course, husbands will be compensated," he added
sarcastically.</P>
<P>"And just what is the going rate for a wife?" Nara demanded.</P>
<P>"Twelve sectors of prime farming land and his choice from the Deputy
Minister’s stable of concubines."</P>
<P>"I’ll die first," Nara said as her eyes narrowed. </P>
<P>"We are sacred bound," Tach said. His browridge darkened and his deep brown
eyes showed only hate. "We cannot be unjoined."</P>
<P>"You know they do not recognize sacred bonds," Betoc said. "Our colony is one
of the only ones who’ve returned to the ways of the ancient goddess. Those on
Sha’Lar care more for their own desires than those of the goddess."</P>
<P>"What is he talking about?" B’Elanna asked Tach.</P>
<P>"Genetic reassignment was a common practice on Sha’Lar for hundreds of
years," Tach said quietly. His voice was shaking. "A Minister would notice that
one province had a better class of athletes, or engineers, or like now,
scientists. He would order all of the women of the area… reassigned outside of
the province to spread out the genetic base by giving some to each municipality
to ensure diversity."</P>
<P>"What about the families?" Kathryn asked, her eyes wide with shock.</P>
<P>"Never worry," Nara said bitterly. "The husbands kept the male children, and
were well paid for their wives. They usually got a new wife in the deal as well,
from another province."</P>
<P>"Captain, you cannot allow this," Seven said as she looked to Kathryn.</P>
<P>"We can’t change their social system, Seven. No matter how appalling we think
it is," Janeway said sadly. She looked to Tach. "But, we can help you in any way
possible. Your shuttle was destroyed, so I am offering you asylum here, on
<I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said as he raised an eyebrow. "You could be involving
<I>Voyager</I> in a social revolt, a clear violation of the Prime Directive. The
Minister may send armed troops to enforce this genetic reassignment."</P>
<P>"They’re already on the way," Betoc said. "As soon as the Minister heard
about our problems a month ago, he sent troops from Nador Three. This was
probably his plan all along. The troops will be here in two months."</P>
<P>"Well, we won’t be here when they arrive," Tach said. "Betoc, our shuttle was
destroyed trying to save the planet. I think the least you can do is find me a
replacement and give me a head start."</P>
<P>"Gladly, Fas’fa," Betoc said. "The Supreme Commander of the Guard was killed
by one of the first meteor strikes. I’m the acting commander, so I can get you a
small ship without anyone noticing. We’ve lost so many as it is, I should be
able to add one more to the list of lost ships."</P>
<P>"Will they come after you?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"I doubt it," Betoc said. "Tach and Nara were reported lost with the rest of
the Caldori Province. I never updated the records…I was afraid something like
this might happen."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Tach said. He looked over at Nara. "I will never let them
separate us."</P>
<P>"If you have been reported dead, you cannot go to any Narian colony," Seven
pointed out.</P>
<P>"I’d rather go back to Jusari Prime and live out my days in our cabin than be
sold off to a new husband." Nara looked over at Seven. "At least it would be my
choice."</P>
<P>"There is another option," Kathryn said as she looked at Nara. "You could
stay on <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"I remind you that <I>Voyager’s</I> resources are limited," Tuvok said. The
others looked at him, expecting him to list the reasons why they couldn’t stay,
but he had other plans. "Tach’s ability as a farmer has already freed up
impressive amounts of energy as well increasing the production of oxygen. Nara’s
ability to make Mister Neelix’s food…more palatable has also helped reduce the
amount of replicator rations being utilized. Their staying on board would be the
logical choice."</P>
<P>Nara looked at Tach and nodded.</P>
<P>"Captain, we would be honored to stay on board, at least for the time being,"
Tach said. "We’ll take a shuttle from Betoc, and if we start to outstay our
welcome, we’ll find a nice planet where we can settle down."</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "You will not leave to settle down. You have already proven
your value to the ship and you have…family here. It would be illogical for you
to leave. Besides, unlike some of the current passengers, you are improving the
quality of life on board immensely."</P>
<P>"I agree, you have made things better," Kathryn said with a smile. She turned
to Seven. "Although I think Mister Neelix is much more than a passenger and he
has been invaluable."</P>
<P>"Of course he is," Seven said indignantly. </P>
<P>"I think my wife is referring to the <I>Equinox</I> crew," B’Elanna said with
a smirk. "They haven’t pitched in much."</P>
<P>"Indeed," Tuvok said. "Aside from performing the duties we have required of
them, they have taken no initiative." Tuvok straighten his back and tilted his
head at Janeway. "Tach and Nara’s willingness to assist the ship while they were
indeed only passengers… suggests that they would be an enormous asset to the
crew."</P>
<P>"I’m already sold on the idea, Tuvok," Kathryn said warmly. "Don’t worry
Tu-vee, Ty and his parents will be a welcome addition."</P>
<P>"Vulcans do not worry," Tuvok responded.</P>
<P>"I should be going," Betoc said sadly. "I have much to do."</P>
<P>"You’re welcome to spend some time with Tach and Nara if you like," Kathryn
said.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Betoc said. "I will only stay a short while. There are others
under my command that I have to arrange ‘<I>destroyed’</I> vessels for. Many in
the Stellar Guard have sacred bondings as well. They are scattering in all
directions in hopes of escaping the genetic reassignment."</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway said as she stood. "I’ll leave you to make the
arrangements. I have to go convince my first officer that we have room for a few
more crew on our manifest."</P>
<P>"If he argues, I will be happy to convince him," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so," Kathryn said. "As a matter of fact, I don’t think I want
you doing any more convincing at all. Which reminds me, I want you and B’Elanna
to begin fixing my ready room."</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said grimly.</P>
<P>"And when you’re finished there," Janeway said as she paused at the door. "We
need to have a discussion about the proper use of this conference room."
Kathryn’s eyes drifted to the table and then over to B’Elanna. "Is that
understood?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," B’Elanna said. She watched Kathryn leave and then leaned over
to her wife. "You are in so much trouble," she whispered.</P>
<P>"We," Seven said as she turned to her wife. "<I>We</I> are in so much
trouble. I was I not alone on the table," she whispered.</P>
