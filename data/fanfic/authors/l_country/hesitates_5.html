<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Five: Home Sweet Home -->

<P>Seven pushed the shuttle door open with her foot and then let B’Elanna go
through first. Torres leaned out and paused, holding her hand up to keep Seven
behind her.</P>
<P>"Wow, nice driving, Seven." Torres leaned back in and smiled.</P>
<P>Seven followed Torres out of the door and looked out over a vast valley full
of evergreen trees that were hundreds of feet tall. She looked behind the
shuttle at the exposed ground that stretched out for almost a mile where the
shuttle had crashed through the dense forest, then she turned to the front of
the shuttle itself. The entire front end was caved in and there were huge pieces
of the structure torn away.</P>
<P>"Our survival was…unlikely." Seven touched the dented alloy, then jerked her
hand back from the friction-heated metal. </P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, I say any landing you can walk away from is a good one." Torres
turned and looked around the forest. "Looks like we won’t have to worry about a
welcoming party. I say we try to set up a transmitter to contact
<I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>Seven looked at B’Elanna suspiciously. "That could prove to be difficult
given the lack of communications components and given the fact that
<I>Voyager</I> will not even be looking for us for at least four more days. Our
more pressing concern is survival."</P>
<P>"Oh, all right," Torres said with a dramatic huff. "But I’m telling you right
now that I hate camping. I’d be much happier playing with circuitry then playing
campfire girl."</P>
<P>"Playing? I do not believe we should be wasting our time playing."</P>
<P>"Oh, shut up and find some firewood, Seven." Torres retrieved the tricorder
and then went into the forest and began scanning the area.</P>
<P>Seven frowned and leaned against the shuttle and watched as Torres walked in
circles, scanning and rescanning the area. After several minutes she went inside
and began cataloging the supplies they had.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Nine hours later Seven had a huge roaring fire built in front of the shuttle
wreckage. It looked more like a small forest fire than any control burn. Torres
came out to check on the inferno for the third time.</P>
<P>"Seven, I said start a fire, not burn down half the forest. What are you
gonna’ have left to burn tomorrow?" Torres moved closer, holding her hands out
to warm them against the cooling night air.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you would prefer to freeze to death," Seven responded as she used a
branch to push a large rock into the flames.</P>
<P>B’Elanna ignored the comment and stared into the flames and then looked up at
the night sky. It was filled with brilliant stars and two moons, both only half
full. "I rigged the energy converter with the solar panel. It should hold you
until <I>Voyager</I> finds us."</P>
<P>"If they find us. We should prepare for the possibility that they may not
rescue us." Seven moved around the fire pit and pushed another rock into the
flames.</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna said quietly. "We should get some sleep so we can get an
early start tomorrow."</P>
<P>"I will be in shortly. Have you noticed anything on the tricorder scans?"</P>
<P>"Nothing except a few small animals. I think the bigger critters must have
been scared off by our landing," Torres said. She moved around the fire next to
Seven and watched her push another rock into the flames.</P>
<P>"Critters?" Seven asked without looking up.</P>
<P>"Yeah, animals." Torres pointed at the rocks in the flames. "What are you
doing with those?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled and gave B’Elanna a sideways glance. "I believe the temperature
will drop considerably tonight…and you requested that I avoid a cold landing
zone. I will bring the heated rocks into the shuttle to increase the
temperature."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, and blushed. "Thanks." She turned and went inside, hoping
Seven hadn’t noticed her reddened cheeks.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna yelled at Seven. "Why should we build a cabin when we have a
perfectly good shuttle to sleep in?" Torres took a bite of her ration bar and
rested her head on the large boulder she was stretched out on top of.</P>
<P>Seven stepped away from the downed tree she was stripping and stalked over
the B’Elanna. "Because the shuttle does not have enough insulation. It is
designed for the short flight from orbit to the ground and half of the fuel
cells were allocated to heating the interior. We will freeze if we do not build
more efficient shelter."</P>
<P>"Efficient? Oh, that’s the Borg I know and love," Torres yelled as she jumped
off of the rock. "How many Borg log cabins have you built? Or did you just
assimilate them?"</P>
<P>Seven glared at Torres and moved closer to her until their chests were almost
touching. "I am not a Borg. We have been here three days and it is obvious we
cannot communicate with anyone on the surface let alone in orbit." Seven stepped
closer pushing Torres back into the rock she had been resting on. "It is
entirely possible we will not be rescued. We must build a shelter before the
winter weather sets in."</P>
<P>"Back off, Borg," Torres growled, pushing Seven with both hands.</P>
<P>Seven picked her up by the collar of her uniform jacket. "I am not Borg. If I
were, you would be a drone or dead," Seven said through clenched teeth and
tossed Torres off to the side.</P>
<P>B’Elanna took a deep breath and prepared to attack, but then looked at
Seven’s arrogant features and noticed something else; she saw pain. She stood in
place and studied the tall blonde. Seven had her hands clenched, the knuckles
gone white, and her jaw was trembling.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna said gently.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven said without looking up.</P>
<P>"I know you’re not a Borg. I was just angry." Torres edged closer to her
volatile companion.</P>
<P>"Anger is irrelevant. Your opinion is irrelevant." Seven turned away.</P>
<P>"Okay, I tried," B’Elanna said as she turned and walked back to the log Seven
had been stripping of branches. She kicked at the pile of bark Seven had already
peel off. "You gonna’ use this for kindling?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered, still not turning around.</P>
<P>B’Elanna began gathering up the bark, the closest thing to a peace offering
she could think of.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Seven asked without turning. She was looking out into the dense
tree cover and her voice sounded small and alone.</P>
<P>"Yes?" B’Elanna asked as she continued with the bark.</P>
<P>"The men in those cities? The ones Malok spoke of?" Seven said in a
whisper.</P>
<P>"Yeah? What about them?" Torres carefully put the bark into a small pile and
studied Seven’s back.</P>
<P>"Malok said…any offspring would be beamed up with us," Seven said. "He was
referring to unwelcome sexual advances and the possible children from those
couplings, was he not?"</P>
<P>"Yes, he was." B’Elanna stood and moved a few steps closer to Seven.</P>
<P>"If those men had… attacked me, would you hate me?" Seven asked, so quiet
that if Torres hadn’t been focused on her, she wouldn’t have been able to
hear.</P>
<P>"No, of course not, Seven." Torres moved closer and put her hand on Seven’s
shoulder and eased the taller woman around so that she could look at her. "Why
would you ask that? Seven, I would never blame you for that."</P>
<P>Seven lifted her head and looked into B’Elanna face. There were tears sliding
down the former drone’s alabaster cheeks. "The Borg took me against my will. I
had no choice. Every time you call me ‘Borg’ or ‘drone,’ you remind me that you
have not forgiven me for being attacked." </P>
<P>B’Elanna felt like someone had thrown her out an airlock. She felt like all
the air was ripped from her chest and just looking at the pain on Seven’s face
felt like a dagger being plunged into her stomach. It had never occurred to her
that Seven felt such pain from her assimilation. Now that she heard the words,
she wondered how she could have ever missed it. The pain on Seven’s face was so
intense, and obvious, even under her thinly veiled attempts to look emotionless.
She saw in Seven’s face her own attempts to hide her own shame from growing up a
"half-breed" that was never accepted by either race.</P>
<P>"Seven, I… I never knew." B’Elanna closed her eyes and rubbed her ridged
brow. "Geeze, I know how stupid that sounds. I… I’m just sorry."</P>
<P>"I did not tell you this to receive an apology, only to clarify as to why the
situations are different," Seven said sincerely.</P>
<P>"They’re not different. And I promise you, I won’t forget that." Torres
pulled Seven back toward the downed tree. "Come on, let’s get back to work on
that log cabin."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After eight days of back breaking work the shelter was not finished, and
there was still no sign that <I>Voyager</I> had come looking for them. ‘The
Homestead,’ as B’Elanna had decided to call the small cabin, overlooked a deep
blue lake and a rolling green valley. It was almost finished. Seven had used
chunks of the hull plating and fashioned them into axes. The walls of the cabin
were double thick and packed with a one foot thick layer of mud and insulation
from the inside of the shuttle walls. B’Elanna had suggested using the shuttle’s
thin insulation to add to the cabin’s walls and Seven had quickly volunteered to
salvage the itchy material from the hull.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna warmed her hands as she stood next to the small fire in front of the
budding cabin. They had a lot of work to do before the structure would be a
shelter, but she needed to do another parameter survey. She wanted to make sure
there weren’t any other prisoners in the area. She looked over at Seven, who was
using a sharpened piece of hull plating as a makeshift plane, slicing off layers
of wood to get the lumber to conform to her ‘master plan’ for the cabin. That in
and of itself was rather comical, making B’Elanna smile at the picture of a Borg
carpenter, but there was more. Seven was singing, almost as if she was doing it
unconsciously. The sounds of her melodic voice carried across the meadow and
would have been quite awe inspiring if she hadn’t been singing one of the
Doctor’s favorite ditties.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said as she walked over to the beautiful blonde. "Can’t you
sing something else?"</P>
<P>Seven stopped, the words to "I’ve been working on the railroad" dying on her
full lips. "You do not like my song selection?" she asked as she looked up from
the wood shavings littering the forest floor at her feet.</P>
<P>"Do ya’ see any railroads?" B’Elanna asked as she swung her arm in a wide
arch.</P>
<P>"No…" Seven said slowly, "However…I am working." She glanced over at the
evidence, a stack of perfectly formed boards, each one shaved to within a
centimeter of perfection.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well," B’Elanna said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable as Seven studied
her. Seven’s deep blue eyes seemed to look beneath her skin, directly into her
soul, and it made the Klingon nervous. "Can’t you pick something that
seems…relevant to your situation? I heard enough of that song from the Doctor…
although I like your version much better," she said before she could stop the
words from tumbling out of her mouth.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said and then blushed. "I will try to choose a song more
to your liking."</P>
<P>"Umm, you’re welcome," B’Elanna said. She was mesmerized by the blush moving
across Seven’s skin like a wave, not just her face, but down her neck and
plunging under the fabric of her biosuit. B’Elanna wondered how far down the
color managed to spread, and then realized Seven was looking at her. It was
B’Elanna’s turn to blush. "I should get going."</P>
<P>"You will be careful?" Seven asked. She sounded genuinely concerned, as
opposed to the smug, condescending tones B’Elanna was used to hearing from her
on board <I>Voyager</I>.</P>
<P>"I will," B’Elanna promised.</P>
<P>Seven stood and went to pick up a small pack that was sitting next to her. "I
packed a nutritional supplement for you consisting of nuts, berries, and two
ration bars," Seven said as she held out the package. "I also including an
emergency blanket."</P>
<P>"Thank you…" B’Elanna was stunned by the gesture. "I… I shouldn’t be gone
more than a few hours, but this is… wow. Thanks."</P>
<P>"You are welcome. I didn’t want you to be caught unprepared. I am however,
glad that you will be… <I>back</I> before nightfall." Seven said. She had to
stop herself from calling the small encampment <I>home</I>.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed as she secured the pack to her waist. "Don’t worry, I’ll be
here to keep you warm." B’Elanna suddenly blushed anew. "I mean… I…"</P>
<P>"It is all right," Seven assured her. "Your Klingon physiology does make your
body heat… desirous. I was uncomfortable sharing our heat at first but it does
seem most…efficient."</P>
<P>"Yeah, efficient little heater. That’s me," B’Elanna said as she headed off
into the forest, escaping while she could. ‘<I>My Klingon physiology does more
than make me put off heat,’</I> she thought as she moved quickly through the
trees. ‘<I>It also makes me want to do more than share heat with you,’</I> she
thought of the previous night. <I>‘I want to generate some heat of our own.’</I>
</P>
<P>As B’Elanna moved through the trees, she remembered the night before. She and
Seven had both been shivering despite the large heated rocks Seven had moved in
to warm the shuttle. Finally, Seven got up and came to B’Elanna’s bedroll and
settled next to her, spooning her from behind. B’Elanna thought her heart was
going to beat out of her chest. She had known she was attracted to the exdrone
for some time, but in that moment, in the near darkness, she could feel Seven’s
skin before they ever touched, as if B’Elanna’s body was calling out to Seven’s.
She had asked Seven what she was doing, and Seven had slid under the blanket
next to her, replying, "Conserving heat." Seven had no idea how much heat she
was generating with the press of her lanky body against B’Elanna’s more compact
form. It took several hours for B’Elanna to fall asleep, the distraction of
Seven’s sighs and sleepy groans had made B’Elanna want to roll over and take the
former Borg into her arms. It took all of her willpower to stop from doing just
that.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna made her perimeter sweep around the valley in a few hours and the
sun was high in the sky when she returned to the cabin site. As she neared the
meadow, she heard Seven’s voice echoing across the grassy hillside. She had
taken B’Elanna’s words to heart and was singing something else. It was a song
B’Elanna was unfamiliar with, but she was taken by it none the less. She made
her way through the dense forest and found herself being as quiet as possible,
as if disturbing Seven would have been a terrible crime. She crested the last
hill to see Seven standing at one end of the cabin structure tying off boards
that would become the rafters. The exdrone was singing as she worked,
occasionally stepping back to inspect her handy work, but never losing her
perfect pitch. B’Elanna leaned against a tree and enjoyed the scene.</P>
<P>Seven continued working, tightening the ropes as she sang the chorus. <FONT
face="BellGothic BT,Arial Narrow"><I>"I want to lay down on your shoulder, just
inside your arms," </I></FONT>she sang<FONT
face="BellGothic BT,Arial Narrow"><I>. "I wanna listen to you heartbeat and your
breathing on and on. I want to lay down on your shoulder, surrender to your
peace… and go to sleep."</I></FONT> Seven moved to the pile of wood and picked
up a large board, struggling to lift it, but kept singing. <FONT
face="BellGothic BT,Arial Narrow"><I>"After we’re gone a million miles. Made
true our dreams with sweat and bone. After we build it up… with our bare hands.
Made strong a place we can call home…"</P></I></FONT>
<P>B’Elanna wondered what had inspired Seven to choose that song. Was it their
experience the night before? B’Elanna had awakened in the night to find Seven
snuggled on top of her. Seven had been mortified when she woke up a few minutes
later. She jumped up and apologized profusely. B’Elanna had chalked it up to the
fact that Seven hadn’t ever slept next to anyone and had naturally sought out
the warmth and comfort of another body. Now she wondered if the unconscious
gesture had a deeper meaning, that Seven might have feelings beyond
friendship.</P>
<P>B’Elanna shifted her weight, causing a small branch to snap.</P>
<P>Seven turned, her eyes flashing and her expression angry. "Do not ‘sneak up’
on me," she yelled, obviously embarrassed. "You have accused me of being
rude…and yet this behavior is exactly what you instruct me to avoid." She fell
back into full Borg mode as she slammed a board into place over the doorway.</P>
<P>"I didn’t mean to sneak up on you," B’Elanna said, although she had been
quite stealthy in her approach. She went to Seven and tried to help her lift one
of the larger boards. "It was beautiful," she said quietly.</P>
<P>"It was… a reflection of my mood," Seven said, and then realized what the
admission sounded like. "I am…tired, and require sleep."</P>
<P>"Oh, I see," B’Elanna said, not buying the excuse for a second. "Why don’t
you go take a nap. This isn’t a Borg cube. I don’t expect you to work yourself
into the ground."</P>
<P>"Into the ground?" Seven asked as she clenched her hands, trying to relieve
the cramping in her fingers. "Borg cubes have no ground." Seven shifted the
board, trying to get it to drop into the notch she had carved into the
rafter.</P>
<P>"I meant, don’t overdo it," B’Elanna said. She knew full well that Seven
understood. She was beginning to get a handle on the exdrone’s dry sense of
humor.</P>
<P>"I see," Seven said as she made sure the board was in place before letting
go. She stepped back and absentmindedly rubbed her sore palms.</P>
<P>"Did you hurt yourself?" B’Elanna asked, pointing at the exBorg’s hand.</P>
<P>"It is nothing," Seven replied. "We have much work to do before
nightfall."</P>
<P>"Let me see," B’Elanna insisted. She grabbed Seven’s hand and pulled it to
her. Seven held her arm firm, throwing B’Elanna off balance. "Come on, Seven.
Just let me have a peek."</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven said as she relaxed her arm and let B’Elanna examine her.
She uncurled her fingers and revealed bloodied blisters covering her fully human
palm.</P>
<P>"Kahless! Why didn’t you say something?" B’Elanna exclaimed. She tugged Seven
toward the first aid kit just inside the area that was going to be the cabin’s
living room. "This must hurt like hell."</P>
<P>"My pain is irrelevant. We must…"</P>
<P>"Not to me," B’Elanna shouted, making Seven stop mid-sentence. "Damn it. Do
you think I want you hurting?" She lifted Seven’s hand and blew on the bloodied
and overheated skin. She could smell the blood, mingled with sweat and thought
of her Klingon heritage. This was considered a romantic aroma, and yet the
thought of Seven’s blood made her chest ache. She didn’t like the idea of
anything hurting the exdrone. She wondered when her feelings had shifted toward
Seven; her animosity was gone, replaced by concern. Perhaps she had always been
attracted to her, and just hid it beneath Klingon hostility. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant?" Seven asked after a few minutes. She was enjoying the sensation
of B’Elanna’s warm hand cradling her injured appendage, but was becoming
distracted by B’Elanna’s warm breath over her sensitive skin. Seven identified
the emotion that went with the sensation. She was becoming aroused. She had to
make B’Elanna stop immediately. The way the Klingon was pursing her lips and
gently blowing on her palm was extremely distracting, as if she were frozen in
mid-kiss. "I fail to see the medicinal value of your action," Seven finally
managed to say.</P>
<P>"Huh?" B’Elanna looked up and realized what she was doing. She had been
caressing Seven’s hand while blowing across the injured area, leaving the dermal
regenerator sitting on the ground. "Oh, yeah. I…needed to make sure there wasn’t
any sawdust in the wound," B’Elanna explained lamely.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, letting the Klingon know that she didn’t quite
believe the excuse.</P>
<P>"Hold still," B’Elanna said as she healed the injury. Once finished, she
continued holding Seven’s hands in her own. She turned them over repeatedly as
if checking for any missed blisters.</P>
<P>"I believe I am fully healed," Seven said, though she was reluctant to lose
contact. She liked the way B’Elanna’s higher Klingon temperature made her hands
feel as if there were nimble infernos dancing over Seven’s skin.</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah." B’Elanna released Seven’s hands, instantly missing the weight of
her willowy fingers. "From now on, stop when you get a blister and let me heal
it."</P>
<P>"I will," Seven promised. If the tender treatment was standard procedure,
Seven hoped she got many more blisters. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two more days passed without incident, and the two women continued to sleep
curled around each other at night. Neither mentioned it, but both felt passions
awakening toward the other. Both were too afraid to mention their budding
emotions, certain their feelings were not returned.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The sun rose from behind the mountains in the east, and B’Elanna stopped her
work on the cabin roof to watch as the golden light broke over the summit. She
found the difficult work strangely rewarding, and while it didn’t involve
schematics or warp cores, there was a great deal of engineering involved in
designing the cabin. B’Elanna had insisted on a large fireplace in the middle of
the structure. It opened on two sides, one that faced the sleeping room, and
another that heating a small cooking area. The Klingon-human hybrid looked down
through the rafters into the room below and watched as Seven concentrated
intently on some project. B’Elanna smiled and leaned her chin onto her hand as
she watched as Seven worked near the hearth. After several minutes, Seven
stopped and looked up at B’Elanna and caught her staring.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, do you require assistance?" Seven asked with a tiny smile
as she shielded her eyes from the sun coming through the bare rafters.</P>
<P>"Ahh…no," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"You have quit working. Are you tired? I would be glad to take over for you."
Seven stood up and went to the ladder they had crafted a week earlier. She
grabbed a Starfleet canteen on the way and climbed the ladder with ease. "Are
you dehydrated?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. She didn’t want to admit that she had been simply
enjoying watching her companion. "Just resting." Seven handed her the water and
Torres took a long drink.</P>
<P>"If I assisted you, we could finish the roof by lunch," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"Thanks. That’s a good idea, then we can finish moving the rest of the
supplies down from the shuttle." B’Elanna looked up the hillside at the shuttle.
It was at the top of the ridge, and it would have been almost impossible to see
were it not for the angry tear across the landscape their landing had caused.
They had decided to build the cabin down by the lakeshore so that they could use
the natural protection of the mountainside and would be close to an abundant
water supply. B’Elanna turned back toward the lake and realized it was a utopian
setting.</P>
<P>Seven sat on the roof and looked down at the lake, then at B’Elanna. She had
been driven to distraction by the Klingon’s habit of striping down to her tank
top while she worked in the sun. The sun was barely up, and already B’Elanna had
been working three hours on the roof, long enough so that her arms were
glistening with sweat and her muscles were pumped into sharp angles. It was most
distracting.</P>
<P>"It’s very beautiful here," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. "Although I believe the Borg would have found this planet
unremarkable."</P>
<P>"Good thing we didn’t invite any Borg to our little party," B’Elanna said and
then took another drink.</P>
<P>"Party, indeed." Seven raised an eyebrow. She looked down at the roof, and
then turned to Torres. "I find that I am feeling a sense of…satisfaction as we
near completion of the ‘Homestead,’ and yet, I would gladly leave it unfinished
if <I>Voyager</I> were to arrive and rescue us."</P>
<P>"Well, it’s a damn fine cabin for two women who’ve spent more time in space
than they have with grass under their feet." Torres handed Seven a stack of
shingles. "You did a great job on these. I didn’t have the patience to cut
them."</P>
<P>Seven seemed uncertain how to respond to the complement. "I am certain you
could have managed." She reached for a handful of square nails from a pile near
Torres. "These nails were an insightful invention."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "I didn’t invent nails, I just figured out how to slice up
the deck plating and shape them. Now, let’s get to work. I can’t handle all this
warm and fuzzy talk." </P>
<P>Seven nodded and they went to work, both distracted by thoughts of
<I>Voyager</I> and why they hadn’t been rescued yet.</P>
