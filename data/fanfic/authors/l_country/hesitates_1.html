<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter One: Holograms and broken hearts -->

<P>Seven of Nine stood in the pub and watched as a mere Hologram announced his
relationship with the captain. Her face remained unchanged for the most part,
with the exception of a slightly raised eyebrow. The rest of the crew present
showed their surprise in their expressions but they tried to act unaffected.
"Sullivan" was the holo-character’s name, and he had apparently been programmed
for drunken self-pity. Seven watched his display for a few moments and then
quietly excused herself from the Fairhaven program. </P>
<P>Tom Paris had created the program for the crew’s recreational enjoyment, but
Seven had not enjoyed it at all. In fact, the former Borg drone found the
holodeck a complete waste of time. Indulging in fantasies when there was work to
be done seemed an ineffective use of time. Now Seven had to face the fact that
not only did Captain Janeway find the holodeck an acceptable use of time and
resources, she apparently found its characters suitable for romantic
entanglement. </P>
<P>Seven made her way to the Astrometrics lab without speaking to any of the
crewmembers she passed, but that in itself was not new. She found superfluous
conversation almost as wasteful as spending time on the holodeck. Seven was a
commanding presence, with her tall, lanky build accented by her striking blonde
hair and blue eyes that alternated from an arctic blue to a deep cobalt
depending on her outfit and mood. The crewmembers that saw her this day saw a
young woman who looked much the same as the drone had when Janeway had first
rescued her from the Borg Collective. Her face was cold, her features harsh,
eyes deep blue and lifeless. Most assumed it was just another of her Borg moods,
some wondered if she was having a bad day, but none could have guessed she was
dealing with a broken heart.</P>
<P>Once she was safely inside the sterile confines of the Astrometrics lab,
Seven began cataloging the scans from the last few star systems <I>Voyager</I>
had passed through, trying desperately to get her mind off of the holographic
bartender from Fairhaven. No matter how many intricate equations she worked on,
she could not shake the images of Michael Sullivan touching the woman she loved.
The idea that Kathryn would let a hologram touch her, love her, when Seven was
aching to ease the captain’s loneliness, was physically painful. After two
hours, Seven gave up and went to regenerate.</P>
<P>Seven kept to herself even when an interstellar storm battered the ship, but
she had heard that the Fairhaven program was damaged, almost lost, yet it had
been saved. Most of the crew went to the grand reopening to celebrate, but there
were two notable exceptions. </P>
<P>Captain Janeway stayed away, warring with her own inner demons as she tried
to understand how and if she could have fallen in love with a hologram. She was
confused, and more than a little disgusted with herself since Michael Sullivan
wasn’t even a sentient hologram. He lacked the sophistication of the Doctor’s
program, unable to feel, or speculate, or to even understand his own existence.
The more Janeway thought about it, the more she realized that it wasn’t so much
Michael Sullivan she loved, but the idea of being in love. But that wasn’t
exactly true either. It was the idea of being in love with someone acceptable.
She had decided long ago that she couldn’t afford to get involved with any of
her crew, and her recent conversation with the Doctor had only reinforced that
belief. Starfleet allowed for captains to date crewmembers, but Kathryn had
never been one to cross that line. She had always had her own built-in safety
net, Mark, the ever-faithful fiancé, but now he had moved on. And to make
matters worse, she was not just captain, but the supreme Starfleet officer in
the Delta quadrant. So in effect, she <I>was</I> Starfleet command, and that
meant her dating a crewmember would have been like an admiral dating a cadet.
Janeway didn’t want to even consider crossing that bridge.</P>
<P>The other person who chose to miss the grand reopening was Seven of Nine. She
had decided that the only use she had for the holodeck was to play Velocity, and
even that didn’t interest her at the moment. Ever since she had discovered
Janeway’s "relationship" with the hologram she had avoided the holodeck and the
captain. Just the thought of either one caused the surprisingly fragile blonde’s
chest to constrict and her throat to feel painfully dry. Instead, Seven studied
the massive amounts of data she had recently collected when <I>Voyager</I> had
been trapped in orbit around a planet out of sync with the rest of the
universe’s timestream. She wished for a moment that she had beamed down to the
planet because in that timestream, she would have long since lived out her life,
and in fact would have been dead for centuries. She had heard that "time heals,"
and she wondered how much time must pass before simply thinking of Kathryn
wouldn’t make her feel like crying. She remembered when One had died. He had
been like her son, and she truly loved him, but his loss had not cut as deeply
and Kathryn’s decision to be with the hologram. Perhaps it was the difference
between losing someone to fate, and having them choose another.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Back on the holodeck, things were not going as expected. The bartender,
Seven’s rival, was drinking more ale than he was serving. He was drunk and
pining away for his Katie O’Clare. For the first ten minutes it had been almost
amusing, but it quickly progressed to downright annoying. The program had been
on-line less than a half-hour before Harry Kim deactivated the whining
bartender. From there, things went down hill. Tom Paris decided to run his
secondary beverage server. He activated Rebecca O’Toole, or "Becca", as she was
known. Becca’s most noteworthy "attributes" were her extremely large breasts,
her extremely revealing blouse, and her extreme willingness to share both.
Unfortunately for Tom Paris, he was enjoying all of Becca’s attributes when his
girlfriend B’Elanna Torres arrived. Tom’s head was buried inside Becca’s blouse
chasing an olive he had dropped down her cleavage moments before, and Becca was
all too eager to assist by arching her back and pushing her permanently erect
nipples into Tom’s face.</P>
<P>"Oh, Tommy, me boy," Becca said with a thick<FONT size=2> </FONT>brogue.
"You’ve gotta’ talented tongue. Would ye like ta’ come upstairs with me like ya’
di’ last night?" She pulled him toward the back of the bar and leaned against
the rough oak wall.</P>
<P>Tom’s hands were joining his mouth under the thin cotton blouse and his
boyish giggle was unmistakable. "I’m expecting someone tonight," he said. "But I
will take you up on that come the morrow," he answered in his version of the
local dialect.</P>
<P>"Oh, surely ye kin sneak away fer a few hours?" the hologram laughed.</P>
<P>What happened next was not entirely clear considering that those who were
close enough to actually see B’Elanna’s reaction were either knocked out of the
way, or rendered unconscious. The Klingon-human hybrid ended Becca’s short
holographic life with a quick snap of her slender neck. Though she had been only
a fantasy creation, her body made a satisfying thud as she crumpled to the
floor. Luckily for Tom Paris, Tuvok happened to be at the pub playing "rings"
because the Vulcan was the first person to reach Torres. Tuvok was hurled over a
nearby table, but his grip on B’Elanna’s arm caused her to tumble over the table
with him. The two struggled on the floor while Tom dove behind the bar counter.
Tuvok had B’Elanna in a headlock, but a well-placed elbow to his ribs doubled
him over long enough for the svelte engineer to escape. She was over the bar
counter in one leap, and Paris came flying back over the bar a split second
later. It would have been an impressive leap on Tom’s part, except he had not
propelled himself. B’Elanna had tossed him headfirst toward the "Rings" area and
then followed him with a deep growl. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway was in her quarters when she was called to sickbay. She was not
amused by what she found.</P>
<P>When Janeway entered sickbay the first thing she noticed was that every bed
was occupied. The second thing she noticed was that there was a security team
around one bed apparently having an impromptu wrestling match with someone.</P>
<P>"All right," Janeway said with a take no prisoners whip of command in her
voice. "What the hell is going on?"</P>
<P>"Captain, there was an altercation in the Fair Haven program," Tuvok informed
her.</P>
<P>Janeway cringed, assuming Michael Sullivan was still pining for her. "And why
did the crew get involved?" she asked, motioning toward the crowded sickbay.</P>
<P>"The crew started it," the Doctor said as he looked up from Tuvok’s obviously
broken arm. "Why does everyone always blame the hologram?"</P>
<P>"Explain." the captain’s eyes narrowed.</P>
<P>"Ouch," Tom Paris yelled from a nearby bed. "Take it easy, Neelix."</P>
<P>"Maybe next time you won’t be so eager to help a hologram retrieve her lost
garnish," Neelix snapped at the bruised and battered helmsman.</P>
<P>Janeway took a step closer to Paris. "Am I to understand you started
this?"</P>
<P>"Pa’tak!" Torres yelled from across the room. "Let me go you son of a targh!"
</P>
<P>The captain turned in time to see Jensen, who was of the burlier security
officers, fly across the room.</P>
<P>"Get off of me!" B’Elanna yelled. "Let me finish what I started. Tom Paris
you Denivian slime devil, I’m gonna’ rip your heart out and feed it to you."</P>
<P>"Lieutenant!" Janeway barked as she made her way toward the pile of security
officers. "At ease, B’Elanna," she ordered.</P>
<P>Two of the security team shifted their focus toward the captain, one of them
got B’Elanna’s boot against his jaw for his lack of attentiveness, and the other
got her fist across his throat. Both men were dropped to their knees. Torres
scrambled to her feet and lunged toward Tom’s position when Janeway’s steely
glare froze her in place.</P>
<P>For a moment B’Elanna’s eyes darted over the captain’s wiry frame looking for
a way past her, but Janeway’s eyes hardened and she squared her stance letting
Torres know that she’d have to go through her commanding officer to get to her
target. </P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna said as she sighed and relaxed her own stance. Her
Klingon blood was in full battlelust, but she would never hit the compact woman
who blocked her path. They shared a long and respectful friendship, and B’Elanna
had come to see Janeway as something of a surrogate for the mother she hadn’t
seen in too many years.</P>
<P>"I think you’ve got some explaining to do," Janeway said. The security
officers managed to get back on their feet and quickly grabbed Torres by each
arm.</P>
<P>"Let me go," Torres demanded, yanking her arms free with relative ease.</P>
<P>"Are you going to restrain yourself?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Yes, Ma’am," Torres said through gritted teeth. The two security officers
looked to the captain and then stepped away when she nodded her approval.
B’Elanna sighed and ran her tongue over her teeth tasting blood, but she ignored
the more obvious trickle of blood making its way down her forehead.</P>
<P>"I’m waiting." Janeway’s voice was quiet and low, warning B’Elanna that she
wasn’t in the mood for any stalling.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes drifted to the deck plating. "Apparently Paris can’t keep it
in his pants. He’s screwing one of those holographic sluts. It’s bad enough that
he’s cheating on me, but with a hologram? He dishonored me, Captain. The whole
crew’s laughing at me."</P>
<P>"And you felt that action warranted putting half my crew in sickbay?" Janeway
kept her face calm, but inside cringed at the topic of sex with holograms.</P>
<P>"No, Ma’am. It didn’t involve any of them," Torres said motioning to the
crowded sickbay. "This was between that Pa’Tak and me," she explained, pointing
to Paris.</P>
<P>"I disagree," Tuvok said as he stepped beside the captain, his injuries
healed. "Had you been left to your own devices, I believe <I>Voyager</I> would
no longer have a helmsman for the alpha shift."</P>
<P>"Damn right," Torres said with a snort.</P>
<P>"That is unacceptable, Lieutenant," Janeway said, quickly silencing B’Elanna.
"I don’t care what Tom did or who he did it with. You will not physically accost
any member of this crew."</P>
<P>"But he dishonored me." Torres’ eyes flashed as she shifted her weight.</P>
<P>"Enough," Janeway said as she held up her hand. "You will sit down and wait
for your injuries to be treated and then you will go to the brig. Directly to
the brig, without stopping by Mr. Paris’ quarters, and you will wait there until
I can figure out what to do with you." Janeway released a disgusted sigh. "Is
that clear, Lieutenant?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna bit her lip and then looked into the captain’s slate blue eyes.
"Yes, Ma’am."</P>
