<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 32: Disclosure -->

<P>Tom watched the Vulcan security chief disappear and then looked back at
Seven. He expected to see her eyes turned completely Borg with the blue entirely
hidden. He had seen her face go blank on many occasions, and while it was
unnerving, he was used to it. What he saw this time terrified him.</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to one side and leaned into Tom’s chest, his legs
swaying from side to side several inches from the ground. "You wanted me to
think that my wife had been unfaithful," Seven said. "That will never happen,
and I will kill you if you ever try to come between us again," she whispered in
his ear, her voice shook, and her eyes were bright blue and full of rage. Her
face was as wild and feral, and human as Tom had ever seen. Her Borg control was
gone, leaving behind a human pushed past the edge, a human with the strength of
five Vulcans, and her hand was wrapped around his throat.</P>
<P>"Seven, please," Tom begged. His body shook and he was sweating profusely.
"Please, I…Please," tears rolled down his cheeks. Seven’s jaw quivered as she
fought to stop from snapping his neck.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok entered the corridor and stood just outside the door listening. He knew
that if he stepped in now, the animosity between Seven and Tom Paris would only
continue. He had listened as Seven and B’Elanna had talked in Engineering. Seven
had been the one convincing Lieutenant Torres to leave Paris alone. Tuvok had
stood quietly, off to one end of the large engine room, his Vulcan ears easily
picking up their whispered discussion. He had been appalled when he had heard
Torres describe the use of Vulcan athletic balm in an attempt to make her appear
unfaithful. He knew that Paris wasn’t intimidated by discipline or the brig.
Perhaps he would be intimidated by a six-foot tall blonde Borg. </P>
<P>Tuvok stood with his hands behind his back listening to the sounds from the
mess hall. He would intervene only if he felt it was absolutely necessary. It
was an orthodox method, but as the captain liked to say, "desperate times called
for desperate measures." He heard the turbolift open and turned to see the
captain walking toward him. Times suddenly became more desperate.</P>
<P>"Tuvok?" Janeway asked with a faint smile as she came alongside him. "What
are you doing out here?"</P>
<P>He paused before speaking. He once again wished that he didn’t have to deal
with humans.</P>
<P>"What’s going on?" Janeway asked. She studied the dark, handsome Vulcan, and
if she didn’t know better, she would say he looked like he had just been caught
with his hand in the cookie jar.</P>
<P>"I am letting Seven of Nine and Mr. Paris…come to an understanding." He
raised one eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Oh, god, Tuvok. She’ll kill him," Janeway said. She was also aware of Tom’s
plot to frame B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I do not believe she would take a life in front of the Narian child," he
pointed out.</P>
<P>"I can’t believe you did this. We will talk about this later," she promised.
"Now, let’s get in there."</P>
<P>They entered the mess hall to find Harry Kim standing next to Tom. Harry had
one arm holding up Tom, and the other hand on Seven’s shoulder. The rest of the
small group was sitting back watching.</P>
<P>"Everyone just calm down," Harry said. "Seven, I will make sure Tom backs
off."</P>
<P>"Me? She’s the one who moved in on Lana," Tom whined.</P>
<P>"Tom, shut up," Harry ordered. He was having a hard enough time keeping Seven
from grabbing Tom’s neck again.</P>
<P>"Excuse me," Janeway said sweetly. "I’m not interrupting, am I?" She walked
over and let her eyes stop on Harry’s efforts to control the two combatants.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tom said happily. "Thank god you’re here. That Borg was just…"</P>
<P>Harry shoved Tom back into the wall. "Seven was just showing Tom a
few…Tsunkatse moves," Harry said pointedly.</P>
<P>"I suspected that would be your explanation," Tuvok said as he stood beside
the captain.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris?" Janeway asked. She noticed that Seven was strangely quiet,
and that her face was flushed.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am…Tsunkatse," Tom said and then sighed and rolled his eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Janeway asked turning to the exBorg.</P>
<P>Seven took a calming breath and released it. "I believe Mister Paris now has
a rudimentary understanding of the…technique. I will however be…happy to
instruct him further should it become necessary."</P>
<P>"See that it doesn’t," Janeway ordered. Her voice was deep and smoky and let
everyone know that she wouldn’t tolerate any more from any of them.</P>
<P>"Yes, Captain," Seven said as she pulled free from Harry’s grip and went back
to her wife.</P>
<P>Tom let out a long relieved sigh. </P>
<P>"Mister Paris, I won’t tolerate your childish behavior anymore," Janeway
said, her voice rumbling. "You’ve used up all of your chances. Is that
understood?"</P>
<P>"Sure," Tom said dismissively.</P>
<P>"Is that understood?" she asked again, letting some of her anger lace through
her silky voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," he said seriously.</P>
<P>"I suggest you go back to your quarters," Janeway said quietly. She reached
out and stopped him as he moved past her. "And Mister Paris, I <I>strongly</I>
suggest that you leave the use of Vulcan medical balms to Tuvok or Vorik. Is
<I>that</I> understood?"</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," he said and then scurried away. As he passed Nara and Tach, Ty
leaned into his mother and glared at the helmsman.</P>
<P>Janeway let her face return to her diplomatic benign interested look and then
joined the small group. She noticed Harry sneak out as she stepped next to
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Tach, Nara, how are you enjoying your tour?" the captain asked.</P>
<P>"You have a fine ship," Nara said. She shifted Ty to the opposite hip and
looked at Seven who was still visibly upset. "A little more excitement than I
prefer before a meal."</P>
<P>"Well," Janeway said, pinning first B’Elanna and then Seven with her command
glare, "I think we’re through having excitement."</P>
<P>"I hope so," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Go to Ba." Ty held out his arms and the Klingon smiled and took him. His
face lit up despite how tired he was. "Bad man," Ty said as he looked at the
door.</P>
<P>"Shh, he’s gone, you little tiger." B’Elanna kissed his head and tickled him.
He squirmed and giggled.</P>
<P>"Seven, I thought you were supposed to be resting," Janeway said. </P>
<P>"I knew that Mister Neelix would finish his tour in the mess hall. I wanted
to see how Tach and Nara were," Seven explained. "I was unaware that Ensign
Paris would be present."</P>
<P>"I see," the captain said. She had the same idea herself, figuring Neelix
would end up in his mess hall so that he could get the visitors a late lunch
since both shifts of <I>Voyager’s</I> midday meal had already passed. "Now that
you’ve checked on them, perhaps you should rest."</P>
<P>"I tried to tell her that," B’Elanna said as she rubbed Seven’s waist with
her free hand. "But did she listen?"</P>
<P>"Not likely," Nara said with a snort.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled despite herself.</P>
<P>"I assure you, I was well rested," Seven insisted.</P>
<P>"Bull," Janeway said. "Go back to your quarters and rest. That’s an
order."</P>
<P>Seven was going to protest, but one look at the relief that covered
B’Elanna’s face changed her mind. "Yes, Captain."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several hours later, the Doctor and Harry Kim stood in holodeck one studying
a series of complex algorithms and matrix designs. The Doctor was a hologram,
and yet many of the computations left him scratching his holographic head.</P>
<P>"What’s the matter, Doc?" Harry asked. He stretched his back, tried from the
six hours he had spent in the holodeck already. "I didn’t think you got
tired."</P>
<P>"I don’t, Mister Kim, but I am…impressed by your ability to construct
holograms." The Doctor cleared his throat and held out the data padd to Harry.
"Can you integrate these files, or will that exceed the program’s capacity?"</P>
<P>Harry took the padd and checked several of the files. "Well, normally, I’d
say yes, but the captain did say that we could use as much of the computer’s
memory core as we need."</P>
<P>The Doctor crossed his arms over his chest. "Yes, well… I think that may have
been a little indulgent on her part. I mean, if we used all of the memory
available, this hologram would have more data than I do."</P>
<P>"Afraid of a little competition?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>"Hardly," the hologram responded a bit too quickly. "I just don’t see why we
need this secondary hologram at all."</P>
<P>"Well, uh…" Harry didn’t know how to respond. He knew exactly why they needed
the new hologram, but he didn’t know how to phrase it without insulting the
Doctor.</P>
<P>"I know, Mister Kim…Seven will be more comfortable with the new program." The
Doctor sighed and looked plaintively at Harry. "I just don’t know why the
captain couldn’t wait until Seven had a chance to calm down. We might not even
need this…this… replacement in a few days."</P>
<P>"Doc, no disrespect intended, but you did try to abort her…"</P>
<P>"I know what I did, Mister Kim," the Doctor yelled. "I had my reasons, and I
wish the captain would trust that I will respect her wishes now."</P>
<P>"Doc," Harry said gently. "It’s a matter of Seven not trusting you anymore.
She needs to trust her doctor. Don’t you want her to feel comfortable?"</P>
<P>"Of course I do," the hologram responded. "I just… well, I was looking
forward to delivering the baby."</P>
<P>"Maybe Seven will let you be there," Harry suggested, though he doubted the
exdrone would agree.</P>
<P>"Maybe," the Doctor said, but he also knew better. "Let’s bring this thing on
line," he said with false cheer.</P>
<P>"Okay," Harry said as he accessed the files. "Hey, how did you decide who to
model it after?"</P>
<P>"There were several doctors in the database, but this one stood out," the
Doctor explained. "She was a midwife in the Cardassian labor camps. I figured I
got into so much trouble with that Cardassian hologram, maybe I could make up
for it by having a Bajorian specialist."</P>
<P>"So she isn’t a doctor?" Harry asked as he began materializing the
hologram.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," the Doctor corrected. "She got her degree after the
occupation. She delivered thousands of children in the camps, and hundreds more
after she completed her medical degree. She is considered the leading Federation
expert on comparative birthing techniques."</P>
<P>"Yeah? Did she ever deliver a Borg?" Harry asked. He fine-tuned the data and
the short, dark haired Bajorian hologram materialized in front of them. She was
in her late forties, wearing traditional Bajorian garb, a forest green tunic and
pants and a long dangling ear cuff on one side. She stood motionless, not yet
having been programmed for any more than a physical matrix.</P>
<P>"Not likely, Mister Kim," the Doctor said, though he did smile. "She did
however spend two years on the Klingon homeworld helping to train midwives there
with some of the new advanced medical equipment. She also spent several years on
Earth."</P>
<P>"Wow, that’ll come in handy," Harry said as he tapped a few more buttons and
sent the first block of data to they new hologram’s matrix. The woman flickered
and then stabilized. Harry sent another data block and smiled as the short
woman’s blank expression shifted and she looked back at him curiously.</P>
<P>"Hello," she said politely. "Have we met?"</P>
<P>"Ah…no," Harry said.</P>
<P>"I am the Emergency Medical Hologram," the Doctor said formally. "We
programmed you as a specialist."</P>
<P>"Well, given the data I can access," she said with a smile, "I’m guessing
neither of you needs my help. I doubt that either of you is pregnant."<BR></P>
<P>"No," Harry said. He decided that the Doctor’s sarcastic subroutine must have
been incorporated into her matrix.</P>
<P>"The patient is carrying a one quarter Klingon, three quarter human child,"
the Doctor explained.</P>
<P>"What is the mother’s species?" she asked politely as she stepped closer.</P>
<P>Harry looked to the Doctor.</P>
<P>"She is primarily human… with…Borg implants," the Doctor said.</P>
<P>"Really? And she is no longer part of the Collective?" She asked excitedly.
"And the father? He’s part Klingon?"</P>
<P>"Actually," the Doctor said. "The secondary mother is half Klingon, half
human."</P>
<P>"Hmm, external ovum recombinant fertilization?" she asked, seeming to take
mental notes as she listened.</P>
<P>"No," the Doctor said. "It was in inter-utero technique…of Borg design."</P>
<P>"Ah," she said as she nodded her head. She steepled her fingers under her
chin and pursed her lips. "When do I meet them?"</P>
<P>"We need to finish programming you first," Harry said delicately.</P>
<P>"Yes, of course," she said. "I do have the Emergency Medical Hologram
subroutines, so I understand my basic nature. I am curious though, why this
personality subroutine?"</P>
<P>"You were the best qualified," the Doctor explained.</P>
<P>"Good," she said. Her deep brown eyes sparkled. "So, I guess you can call me…
Doctor Opaca? Although I do personally prefer just Opaca."</P>
<P>"Sure," Harry said. He thought he had heard the name before but wasn’t
sure.</P>
<P>"My sister would certainly have something to say about me." She laughed, an
infectious, yet refined giggle.</P>
<P>"Sister?" Harry asked, confused.</P>
<P>"Well, not <I>my</I> sister…the doctor I was modeled after. Her sister was
something of a philosopher. Perhaps you’ve heard of her… Kai Opaca?"</P>
<P>"The Kai?" Harry spun and gave the Doctor a dirty look. "We made a hologram
of the Kai’s sister? What are the Bajorian crewmembers gonna’ say?"</P>
<P>"Former Kai," the Doctor corrected.</P>
<P>"If I am any judge of Bajorian reactions," Opaca said, "I would guess that
they would say… hello."</P>
<P>"Great," Harry said. "Two smart-mouthed holograms. I can’t wait until
B’Elanna meets you. She’ll probably kill me for creating you."</P>
<P>Opaca smiled. "Are you close to my patients? Tell me about them," she
asked.</P>
<P>"Well, they, uh," Harry stammered. He suddenly remembered the request he had
put in to the ship’s stores two days earlier…for extra soundproofing. His
quarters were next to B’Elanna’s. She had already installed extra padding in the
walls when she had been dating Tom. Harry had no idea what B’Elanna and Seven
were doing every night, he just knew that he didn’t want to hear it all night
long. He felt his cheeks blushing.</P>
<P>"A feisty pair, I take it," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"Um, yeah," Harry answered as he hoped he never had to witness exactly how
feisty. He wasn’t sure he would survive that particular knowledge. As it was, he
had way too much information about their lovelife. He had heard Seven screaming
out something in Klingon one night, and his curiosity got the best of him. He
repeated the phrase for the computer and asked for a translation. It offered two
possible translations. The first was, "I need your Torpedoes, yes don’t be
lazy," which he was pretty sure wasn’t what Seven had screamed. The second
translation although most likely accurate, made him wish that he had just went
back to sleep and ignored the comment completely. It hadn’t occurred to him that
Seven would use profanity, certainly not the Klingon word for ‘fuck,’ and most
certainly not combined with a string of other curses arranged in a rather randy
set of descriptive instructions involving where and how to perform the
expletives. He definitely had way too much information about the couple.</P>
<P>The new hologram waited patiently as she watched Harry turn an even deeper
shade of red.</P>
<P>"Let’s get your matrix fixed and then answer questions later," Harry said. He
wanted the topic changed quickly.</P>
<P>"As you wish," she said with a smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna was sitting on one end of the in couch her quarters with Ty sleeping
next her. Ty’s head was nestled on the Klingon’s lap and he was rubbing her knee
while he slept. She had one hand resting on his small back and was watching
Seven sitting at the opposite side of the couch. Seven was concentrating a small
blanket she was attempting to knit. It was teal green and so far… it was about
four inches long by two feet wide. She was frowning at the offending item. No
matter how careful she was, she couldn’t get the blanket to be symmetrical.</P>
<P>Ty whimpered and smacked his lips in his sleep.</P>
<P>Seven looked down, noticing that he had dozed off, then let her eyes drift up
to meet B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"He finally quick fighting and went to sleep," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>Seven raised eyebrow and stopped knitting. She wrapped the yarn carefully in
the blanket and put it on the end table and then turned back to B’Elanna and
looked down at Ty.</P>
<P>"Do you want me to move him to the sleeper?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Not just yet," B’Elanna said. "Let’s make sure he’s completely out." She
looked over at the sleeper, a portable child’s bed with low sides. It was
similar to a cradle combined with a playpen, but was designed so that the child
would be kept safe from rolling around while sleeping but could easily climb out
once they were awake.</P>
<P>"You do not fool me, Be’nal," Seven said that she reached out and put her
hand over B’Elanna’s on Ty’s back. "You just want to steal a few more moments
with him."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, but didn’t deny the accusation.</P>
<P>"I have something to take care of," Seven said as she stood. "Enjoy your
guest. I will be back shortly."</P>
<P>"Where are you going?" B’Elanna asked without looking up. She was staring
down at Ty wondering what her daughter would look like. She hoped the baby was
going to have Seven’s features.</P>
<P>"I will explain when I return," Seven said cryptically.</P>
<P>"Okay…" B’Elanna looked up and smiled at her wife. "I can’t wait to hold our
daughter, my love."</P>
<P>Seven smiled and leaned down to kiss B’Elanna. She had intended to give her a
quick, chaste kiss, but was pleasantly surprised when B’Elanna’s hand snaked
around her neck and held her close while she kissed Seven deeply.</P>
<P>"I shall hurry." Seven caressed B’Elanna’s cheek. </P>
<P>"Are you sure you feel up to leaving?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I am fine, love," Seven assured her. "I regenerated for many hours in
Engineering as well as having a nap here."</P>
<P>"Hurry back…I miss you already," B’Elanna said. She blushed and looked
away.</P>
<P>"Do not feel embarrassed for missing me, Be’nal." Seven lifted her wife’s
chin and pressed her lips to B’Elanna’s in a searing kiss. "I will miss you as
well. I have plans for you this evening."</P>
<P>"I’ll get Ty settled for the night," B’Elanna promised.</P>
<P>Seven walked into the corridor and paused after the door hissed shut behind
her. "Computer, locate Ensign Tom Paris," she ordered.</P><I>
<P>*"Ensign Paris is in holodeck two,"*</I> the computer responded.</P>
<P>Seven turned and moved quickly toward the holodeck. She was extremely unhappy
with Tom Paris’ recent behavior and she knew that it had hurt B’Elanna deeply.
Despite the fact that Tom and B’Elanna had broken up, she knew her wife cared
for the boyish helmsman. As she had watched B’Elanna with Ty, she decided that
she would try to mend the fences between Ensign Paris and herself. Being Borg,
she did not believe in putting off anything. She decided that if Paris was in
the holodeck, he shouldn’t object to her talking to him. It was, after all, a
public location.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Opaca sighed and paced the grid in holodeck one. She was bored, tired of
listening to Harry Kim and the Doctor discuss which features to give her as if
she were the latest model on a shuttlecraft sales lot. </P>
<P>Harry shook his head. "No, that doesn’t make sense," he told the Doctor. "Why
should we incorporate all of your medical training?"</P>
<P>"Because," the Doctor said sharply, "If we are going to have a second medical
hologram, why not make it capable of helping during any emergency?"</P>
<P>"Oh, well, that makes sense." Harry turned to the new hologram. "Doctor
Opaca? Do you have any preferences? Anything you’d like added?"</P>
<P>The short Bajorian turned and went over to Harry. "Actually, I’d like to meet
my patients. If I’m going to deliver their child, I need to develop a
relationship with them, let them grow to trust me." She looked over at the
Doctor. "Especially after what happened with you," she added, though it was said
with compassion, not reproach.</P>
<P>"Well, I…" the Doctor nodded. "I guess it is a good thing the captain agreed
to this. It’s probably the best thing for everyone involved."</P>
<P>"From what you’ve told me," Opaca said, "Seven thinks of you as a mentor. You
care deeply for her, so it is best that you have someone else to step in to take
care of her."</P>
<P>"Hey, Doc?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>Both holograms turned.</P>
<P>"No, umm… I meant <I>the</I> Doc," he corrected as he pointed to
<I>Voyager’s</I> doctor.</P>
<P>"Yes, Mister Kim," he asked.</P>
<P>"I have an idea how we can speed up the trust factor with Seven and Doctor
Opaca," Harry explained.</P>
<P>"Really?" the Doctor asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Harry said enthusiastically. "It’s something Tom came up with when he
created Fairhaven. He wanted the crew to interact on a more personal level with
the characters, so he added some synthetic pheromones. He said if the holograms
put off the signals that our subconscious recognized as human, we would feel
closer to them."</P>
<P>"What?" the Doctor demanded. "Exactly which pheromones did he add to the
program…and how did he get the computer to allow them to be used near the
crew?"</P>
<P>"Well, pheromones are harmless, right?" Harry asked. "Tom just used the
computer database to incorporate the different signals from the studies on human
hormonal interaction. He was really excited about it. He said it would be a
breakthrough in holographic design."</P>
<P>Opaca stepped up beside Harry. "If you’re talking about the Hamilton hormonal
study of 2330, that was with strictly naturally occurring pheromones in human
social interactions. It was not related to synthetic pheromones. They are quite
different." </P>
<P>"I’ll say," the Doctor said grimly. "Prolonged exposure to some synthetic
pheromones can cause emotional and psychological side effects."</P>
<P>"Side effects?" Harry asked, his voice cracking.</P>
<P>"Did he include any…sexual pheromones?" Opaca rested her hand on Harry’s
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Ha," the Doctor said with a snort. "If you had ever met Mister Paris, I
don’t think you’d have to ask that question."</P>
<P>"Why?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>"Because," Opaca explained, "Synthetic hormones…especially those involved in
sexual attraction… have been found to have prolonged effects. They can make
people become irrational, possessive, and even violent."</P>
<P>"That explains Mister Paris’ recent behavior," the Doctor said quietly. He
turned to his new colleague. "Mister Paris has been exhibiting all of those
behaviors."</P>
<P>"Anyone else?" Opaca asked.</P>
<P>"Well, the only characters that have the pheromonal interface are…Becca,
Sullivan, and Geary, the town crier. We figured if we had too many of the
characters putting off hormones it would get confusing," Harry said. He suddenly
pictured Sullivan crying in his beer over the captain, and then thought about
the fact that she had been ‘in love’ with the hologram. It was an irrational
reaction, especially for the reserved Janeway. When she found out about the
phenomenal interface, he and Tom were both going to be pulling extra duty for
the rest of the flight home.</P>
<P>"I don’t think anyone else was effected," the Doctor said happily. "Mister
Paris spent a great deal of time in the program, and most of that was with
Becca, so he would have had a great deal of exposure."</P>
<P>"The captain," Harry said. "She was with Sullivan…a lot."</P>
<P>"Oh dear," the Doctor said as the ramifications hit him. The captain had
known something was amiss in her relationship with the hologram, and he had
counseled her to keep seeing him. "At least she broke up with him," he added,
suddenly hopeful that she hadn’t been effected. "She couldn’t have done that if
she was being bombarded by the pheromones."</P>
<P>Opaca nodded. "True, unless she had some type of extreme emotional shock that
would have overrode the pheromones." She smiled at her holographic companion.
"It’s in your databanks. The studies on synthetic hormones from the Jergenson
case studies on Risa found that the artificial hormones could be drowned out by
genuine emotional reactions."</P>
<P>"Of course," he said, brushing off imaginary dust from his tunic sleeve. "My
databanks are extensive."</P>
<P>"Our databanks," she corrected.</P>
<P>"Umm…doctors?" Harry asked. "What are we gonna do about Tom?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes," the Doctor responded. He looked over at Harry with a worried
expression. "We should find him, of course, and make sure that no one else runs
the Fairhaven program. Hopefully it requires massive amounts of exposure to have
any effect."</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim?" Doctor Opaca asked. "Can you give us the specs on the
pheromonal interface so that we can figure out how much the various crewmembers
were exposed to?"</P>
<P>"Sure," Harry said as he went to the console to get the information. "I just
hope Tom stays away from Seven and B’Elanna until we can get him back to
normal."</P>
<P>"We’ll contact him as soon as we take a look at these specs. Even Mister
Paris can’t get into any trouble in an hour or so," the Doctor said.</P>
