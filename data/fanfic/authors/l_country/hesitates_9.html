<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Nine: Changes -->

<P>Seven looked out of the cabin door at the falling snow and smiled when she
heard B’Elanna in the kitchen. She turned and followed the sounds of the
Half-Klingon heating something on the hearth.</P>
<P>"Good morning," B’Elanna said without turning around. She could hear Seven’s
approach, and smiled knowing what was coming next.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Seven answered as she wrapped B’Elanna in her arms and kissed
her neck. "What are we having?"</P>
<P>"Borg barley." B’Elanna tilted the large pot away from the fire to show her
wife their breakfast. She leaned back into Seven’s body and sighed, savoring the
contact.</P>
<P>"Did you put bee saliva in it?" Seven asked as she wrinkled her nose.</P>
<P>"Yes, I put honey in it. It’s too bland without it. No offense, love, but
that barley is gross." B’Elanna struggled as Seven playfully poked her ribs.</P>
<P>"And how exactly does adding bee saliva make the meal less gross?"</P>
<P>"It just does," B’Elanna said. She put the pan back onto the burner and
turned to face her lover. "Trust me."</P>
<P>"I require convincing." Seven tilted her head down and gently kissed
B’Elanna. They kissed briefly before Seven pulled back and caressed B’Elanna’s
cheek.</P>
<P>"Convinced?" B’Elanna asked, smiling when her taller partner nodded. She
toyed with the laces of Seven’s leather shirt, noticing the way it was a bit
looser on one side than the other. "How come we can build a cabin, make weapons,
pots and pans, but we can’t make a simple shirt that does you justice?"</P>
<P>"I had not considered it." Seven looked down at the garment. In truth, she
hadn’t noticed, she considered the fit of the apparel irrelevant, but if it
bothered her wife, she would find a way to fix it. "Perhaps we are better
engineers and warriors than tailors."</P>
<P>"Yeah? Well, right now, I’d promise Kahless himself a day in the sweat caves
if he’d send us a tailor." B’Elanna turned and took the barley cereal off of the
heat and began filling the two bowls on the table. "And while I’m thinking about
it, maybe Kahless could send us a plumber too. I’m tired of not having a
shower."</P>
<P>Seven picked up the canteen on the table and poured two glasses of tea. She
had discovered some sweet, tangy leaves that grew near the lake that made a
beverage far better than anything Neelix had ever created. It was a tea blend
that was bitter but when raspberry leaves were added it became quite pleasant.
It also had a potent caffeine kick.</P>
<P>"I could help you with your bathing," Seven offered with a coy grin. She
enjoyed watching B’Elanna use the steaming water from the hearth and a soft rag
to wipe her body each night. She liked the way the cooling water made her
lover’s caramel skin erupt into goosebumps and the way her skin seemed even more
sensitive when she finished. Many nights Seven couldn’t even wait for B’Elanna
to take the used water outside before carrying her to their bed to make love to
her. They would wake up in the morning and have to wash the soiled pot before
preparing water for their morning wash routine. Of course, since it was Seven’s
fault, she had to do the predawn chore, but she didn’t consider it a sacrifice,
quite the contrary.</P>
<P>"You could help me in a shower too, or better yet, a nice hot bath." B’Elanna
smiled, her mind wandering to images of Seven in a fragrant bubble bath.</P>
<P>A loud roar suddenly shook the cabin walls. Seven jumped to her feet and ran
out of the door with B’Elanna close behind. They jogged to the middle of their
camp and watched as a craft shot overhead and went down in the trees on the
other side of the lake.</P>
<P>"Damn, it." B’Elanna shifted her weight from foot to foot. She had rushed out
barefooted and the thin layer of snow felt like pins in her feet. "We need to go
check that out."</P>
<P>Seven turned, quickly noticing her wife shuffling her feet and scooped up the
feisty Klingon. "You should not be outside without your shoes," she
chastised.</P>
<P>"Seven, a shuttle just crashed, and for all we know it could be a murderer or
worse and you’re worried about my bare feet?" B’Elanna held on around Seven’s
willowy neck as she was carried back inside.</P>
<P>"Whoever they are, they will wait for you to put your shoes on. I will not
have you injuring yourself." Seven gently placed B’Elanna next to the fire and
went to get her boots.</P>
<P>"You’re not my mother," B’Elanna said, but her complaint was softened by the
wide grin on her face and the fact that she was warming her chilled feet on the
hearth.</P>
<P>"No, I am your wife. I outrank your mother." Seven used a towel to dry
B’Elanna’s feet before handing her a fresh pair of socks.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and finished putting on her footwear. "You just remember you
said that when you meet my mother." </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna dressed warmly, collected the med kit, and then gathered
all of the weapons they had before heading toward the crash site. Both were
quiet, each worrying about the other and what they might find.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>They reached the site after an hour and a half of hiking. The snow was a
light dusting, having only fallen a few nights before, with most of it melting
off except under the thickest trees. Seven used the tricorder to locate the
exact location, but B’Elanna insisted on taking the lead as they followed the
long rut carved through the forest by the ship’s impact. </P>
<P>"Over there," B’Elanna whispered and pointed to a shuttle exactly like the
one they had been sent down in.</P>
<P>Seven nodded and made her way around a large boulder. She scanned the
wreckage, seeing two lifesigns. "Lana," she whispered and then held up two
fingers to indicate the number of occupants. The Klingon nodded and gripped her
spear tightly as she raised it up to her shoulder. As they rounded the boulder
they heard a loud moan, and stopped. </P>
<P>"Who are you?" B’Elanna demanded as she stepped out and straddled a man
leaning against a downed tree. He was almost six feet tall, and well muscled,
his hair brown peppered with grey at the temples and he had a thick brow
ridge.</P>
<P>He looked up, terror filling his eyes and then looked back toward the
shuttle.</P>
<P>"Who are you?" B’Elanna asked again, adding a throaty growl for good
measure.</P>
<P>"Please don’t hurt him," a woman said from the shuttle as she leaned out of
the door. She was smaller than the man, with mousy brown hair and small pretty
features. Both she and the man looked almost human except for a slightly thicker
brow ridge that made them both look rather unintelligent like the Cro-Magnon’s
of Earth’s past.</P>
<P>Seven stepped out of the trees next to the shuttle, startling the woman who
screamed and jumped back, but quickly recovered and leaned back out.</P>
<P>"One more time," B’Elanna said. "Who are you? Answer now or I get…grouchy.
"</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven interrupted. She turned to the woman. "Can he
understand?"</P>
<P>The woman nodded slowly.</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to one side and glared at the woman. "Then I suggest he
answers the question."</P>
<P>"I am Tach," the man said as he tried to stand. His leg gave out and he fell
to the wet, cold ground.</P>
<P>"Well, Tach, what are you doing here?" B’Elanna asked as she moved the spear
to a less threatening position at her side.</P>
<P>He seemed to relax slightly once the weapon was no longer posed to hit him in
the throat. "My wife and I were imprisoned for carrying contraband."</P>
<P>"Contraband?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>He nodded. "We were transporting our livestock, Kelvin cattle. We didn’t know
that they had been outlawed in this system."</P>
<P>"How long are you here for?" Torres asked as she knelt beside him and
examined his leg.</P>
<P>"One year," he said warily. "Who are you?"</P>
<P>"Trespassers," B’Elanna said with a smile. </P>
<P>Seven eyed the woman. "We will not harm you."</P>
<P>"I’m Nara," she said as she climbed down. Once she was out of the door it was
clear why she had stayed inside. She was pregnant, and judging from the size of
her belly, it wouldn’t be long before a child joined the small group.</P>
<P>"You are pregnant," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"Yes, but only for about another month," Nara said quietly.</P>
<P>Seven looked inside the cabin, noticing that the chair restraints were in
place and realized Tach shouldn’t have been hurt in the crash. "How did you
injure yourself?" she asked, suddenly suspicious. "How did you alter your
trajectory away from the prison cities?" </P>
<P>"The guard, Malok, reprogrammed the guidance system. He said we wouldn’t want
to go to the cities," Nara said as she made her way toward her husband.</P>
<P>"And this leg?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Tach mumbled something and looked away, while Nara smiled. </P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I fell out of the shuttle," he said.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said and bit her lip to stop from laughing. "Seven, bring me
that med kit." She looked into Tach’s eyes and smiled. "I’m B’Elanna. This is
Seven, my wife."</P>
<P>"Nice to meet you. We are Narians," he said. "Does your wife run your house,
too?" he asked with a wry grin. B’Elanna smiled and bit her lip.</P>
<P>Seven placed the kit next to Tach’s leg and leaned over near B’Elanna’s face.
"Do you trust them?" she whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna shrugged and mended the leg. "Seven is human, and I’m Klingon, well
mostly. So, Tach, what are you gonna’ do?"</P>
<P>He flexed his leg and then stood carefully, smiling when his leg held his
weight. "We brought our tools. We are farmers, so we will farm." He moved
careful toward the shuttle hopping from rock to rock.</P>
<P>"Tach, don’t break the other one," Nara ordered.</P>
<P>He smiled and squeezed her arm when he finally reached her. "Even my luck
isn’t that bad, Nara."</P>
<P>Seven looked to B’Elanna and raise an eyebrow. "We should go. The snow could
start again soon."</P>
<P>"Thank you, for your help," Tach said. "Perhaps we will see you again."</P>
<P>"Thank you, for helping my husband. Tach, we should build a fire. Don’t
dawdle." Nara went back into the shuttle. Tach obediently followed.</P>
<P>B’Elanna watched, then turned to Seven. "Maybe we should, you know, help them
until they can get on their feet. I mean, she’s pregnant for Kahless sake."</P>
<P>Seven smirked, and crossed her arms. "Kahless? Perhaps these are the tailors
you asked for… or the plumber."</P>
<P>"You were gonna’ offer to help all along, weren’t you," B’Elanna accused with
a smile.</P>
<P>"Falling in love has made me weak," Seven replied and took B’Elanna’s
hand.</P>
<P>"Hey, Tach?" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>"Yes?" he asked, leaning out of the shuttle with his arms full of tools.</P>
<P>"You wouldn’t happen to be a tailor would you?" B’Elanna asked and squeezed
Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"No," he said, obviously confused. "But my Nara is quite a seamstress."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened. "And are you a plumber?"</P>
<P>"Great Goddess, no," he laughed. "As I said, I am a farmer. But I have done
my share of home repairs. Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll be having a home
other than this shuttle for a while."</P>
<P>"Kahless?" Seven whispered and looked at B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Don’t look at me," B’Elanna said in a whisper. "Um, Tach, can you two
travel?"</P>
<P>"Nara can, but I can’t guarantee myself. I am a bit…clumsy." He flinched and
Nara leaned out.</P>
<P>"I told you not to dawdle. Where’s the firewood?" She stretched and rubbed
the small of her back.</P>
<P>"If you’re interested, we have a cabin a few hours from here. It’s warm and
dry, and we have a good supply of food," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>Nara leaned into Tach, and wrapped her arm around him. "We have nothing to
offer in return," she said.</P>
<P>"You’re a farmer," B’Elanna said. "You can help us… uh, farm. Can you
hunt?"</P>
<P>He nodded.</P>
<P>Seven stepped forward. "Nara, you are a seamstress? We require…assistance,"
she explained, then pointed to her shirt to prove the point.</P>
<P>Nara jumped down from the shuttle and approached Seven, carefully examining
her clothes. "You’re a big one, aren’t you?" she asked. "And you certainly do
need…assistance."</P>
<P>Seven pulled away and glared at the smaller, rounder woman. "Do you wish to
accept our offer?"</P>
<P>Nara smiled. "I like her." She turned to B’Elanna. "Are you as difficult as
she is?"</P>
<P>"Worse," Torres said as she stepped onto a rock behind Seven that put her
several inches above her wife. She wrapped her arms around Seven from behind and
rested her chin on her lover’s shoulder. "Much worse."</P>
<P>"It’s a deal," Nara said without looking to Tach.</P>
