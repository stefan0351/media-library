<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 25: Storm on the horizon -->

<P>B’Elanna sat at one end of the conference room’s long table. She, along with
the rest of the senior staff members, were watching Seven explain her latest
findings<I>. "She’s so incredible,"</I> B’Elanna thought as she studied her
wife. "<I>She has no idea how beautiful she is. She moves like a ghost, outside
of our puny human reality, floating gracefully through our existence. Oh hell,
I’m thinking in poetry. What’s next? Sprinkling flowers in her path so she won’t
have to walk on the carpet?" </I>B’Elanna covered her mouth with her hand and
smirked. <I>"I wonder what kind of flowers she likes best?"</P></I>
<P>Seven was wearing her blue and gray biosuit, the closet thing to a uniform
she had, but instead of trying to force her long hair up into a bun, she had it
braided and then looped it back into itself in the back. Even doubled back, it
reached past her shoulders. Seven was all business, composed and focused, and
B’Elanna couldn’t stop staring. How could she have ever thought Seven was an
unemotional "Ice Queen?" </P>
<P>Even as professional as Seven was acting, as serious as she kept her
expression, the passion just under the surface was obvious. All anyone had to do
was look. Seven’s cobalt blue eyes flickered around the room as she spoke and
the corners of her mouth edged up a fraction of a centimeter. It was enough to
let B’Elanna know that no matter how much Seven enjoyed knowledge for the sake
of knowledge, she was thrilled to have come up with a way to help
<I>Voyager</I>.</P>
<P>"So," Seven said as she pointed to the large comm panel on the wall that was
displaying the map Harry had constructed. "As you can see, the dark matter
pockets overlap creating areas of intense gravity that rival those found in
black holes."</P>
<P>"And?" Tom asked as he almost yawned. "So what? We already know that we won’t
have warp drive for…what is it? …. Four months? Thanks for the news flash."</P>
<P>He was about to continue, but the twin glares he got from Janeway and
B’Elanna made him change his mind.</P>
<P>"What it means, Mister Paris," Seven continued as if he had politely asked a
sincere question. "Is that while we may not be able to use the warp drive, but
we will still be able to travel at warp."</P>
<P>"How?" The captain leaned forward and rested her palms on the desk.</P>
<P>Seven nodded, acknowledging Janeway before pointing back at the map. "These
areas of increased gravity form swirling vortexes, similar to whirlpools. Mister
Kim and I have plotted a course between the spatial whirlpools that spin this
same direction." It was generous to say that Harry had helped plot the course
considering she was the one who quickly went through the maps and discovered the
best flight plan, but she knew how important recognition was to humans, and she
rather liked Ensign Kim.</P>
<P>"Well, it was mostly Seven," Harry said truthfully.</P>
<P>"Mister Kim, your assistance was critical to this project. Thank you for
volunteering." Seven made a point of letting the captain know that Harry had
helped of his own accord, something else humans found relevant. "Now," Seven
said, getting back to the point. "These whirlpools overlap, and where the
vortexes touch, they create an area of directed gravitational displacement."
Seven pointed to the diagram that showed a current weaving through the dark
matter field.</P>
<P>Janeway stood. "It’s a river," she said as she moved next to Seven to get a
better look. "And it’s moving faster than the speed of light." Her lips curved
up on both sides. "This is brilliant, Seven."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled brightly, because, damn it, it was a great idea, and someone
was gonna’ beam proudly over Seven’s discovery and she knew Seven wouldn’t let
her own happiness show.</P>
<P>"It was not my discovery," Seven said honestly. </P>
<P>Tom was not impressed. "So who’d you assimilate it from? Some nice
peaceful…"</P>
<P>"Paris," B’Elanna hissed before the captain could. "I’ve had about all of
your mouth that I’m gonna’…"</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat, stopping B’Elanna midsentence. "I will handle
Ensign Paris… after the meeting." Her voice was deep, and rumbled, the way it
did right before she gave someone a verbal lashing that left them feeling like
their skin had been flayed off. "Seven, please continue."</P>
<P>"As I was saying, this was not my idea. I noticed ion trails through the
matter field, and figured that previous travelers would have plotted the safest
courses. I noticed the predominate pattern and realized that the gravitational
current had propelled the ships as they traversed the sector."</P>
<P>"An astute observation," Tuvok said, impressed, but too Vulcan to say any
more.</P>
<P>"There are however, two areas that are…problematic," Seven said, bringing the
mood down a notch.</P>
<P>"Yes?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"On this end of the gravitational ‘river,’ there is an area of extreme
turbulence where the whirlpools have increased backwash. It will be unstable and
have extremely elevated gravity. The ship will have to be reinforced."</P>
<P>"Rapids," Janeway said. "I think our ship can handle a little rough
water."</P>
<P>Seven raised her metallic implant over her left eye. "This ‘rough water’ is
capable of pulling the iron out of your bloodstream."</P>
<P>"Well then," Janeway said with a smile. "It’s a good thing I take my
vitamins."</P>
<P>"Ha," the Doctor snorted. "How I wish <I>that</I> were true."</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned forward and pushed Seven’s chair away from the table as the
blonde returned to her seat. "Great job," she whispered as Seven sat down.</P>
<P>Seven tilted her head to the side as she slid the chair into place. She was
glancing sideways at B’Elanna, almost coyly, and she let a whisper of a smile
pass over her lips before turning to focus on the captain. </P>
<P>"<I>Oh, yeah,"</I> B’Elanna thought. "<I>She knows she’s good</I>."</P>
<P>"All right," the captain said as she stood facing the table with her hands on
her hips. "Let’s get to work on the reinforcements. We should reach the Gravity
River in just over one day, and I want to be ready. You all have copies of
Seven’s findings, so get to work on figuring out where the structural integrity
needs to be shored up. Dismissed."</P>
<P>The crew stood and moved toward the door.</P>
<P>"Ensign Paris," Janeway said ominously. "You will be staying behind."</P>
<P>"Umm, yes ma’am," he said as he studied the carpeting.</P>
<P>Janeway stood in front of Tom, pinning him in place with her most murderous
glare until the rest of the crew disappeared behind the hissing door.</P>
<P>"Ma’am, I can explain," Tom said as the doors were hissing closed.</P>
<P>"Did I give you permission to speak?" Her eyes had lost all of their blue and
looked completely gray.</P>
<P>He opened his mouth to say "no"…then stopped. Was he supposed to speak now or
just be quiet?</P>
<P>"Well?" she demanded.</P>
<P>That answered that question. </P>
<P>"No, ma’am." </P>
<P>"Mister Paris, I will not tolerate your temper tantrums. If I had my way,
you’d be in the brig right now." She stepped closer, her anger coming off her
body in waves. Tom took a half step away before she could continue. "I got a
report about an incident in the mess hall. It seems several witnesses reported
that you hit Harry Kim." </P>
<P>The captain walked behind Paris, but he had enough sense to remain standing
at attention as she circled him.</P>
<P>"Tuvok interviewed Harry about the incident, and Harry explained that you
were showing him a Tsunkatse move and he forgot to duck." She circled back
around and stared him down, letting him know that she recognized a lie when she
heard one. "I would have you in brig except that I’d have to have Harry in the
cell next to you for lying to a superior officer, and I won’t punish him for his
loyalty…no matter how misguided."</P>
<P>Tom continued staring dead ahead. "<I>Well, at least Harry didn’t rat me
out," </I>he thought.</P>
<P>"I realize that you are having a difficult time coming to terms with recent
events," Janeway said, her voice softening to the ‘mortal wound’ tone instead of
the ‘instant death’ tone she had been using. "You can’t keep taking it out on
Seven."</P>
<P>"But…" Tom shifted his weight, as antsy as a thoroughbred in a race gate.</P>
<P>"No buts." The ‘instant death’ tone was back. "Get over it…grow up… or just
pretend that you are an adult. I don’t care what you do as long as you quit
storming around the ship like it’s your private playground and someone stole
your favorite toy." She turned and walked to the window, silent as she watched
the stars blur past. Each one was a sun, part of a solar system that whipped
past in the blink of an eye. There were probably thousands…tens of thousands of
people in each solar system dealing with broken hearts…and every one of them was
probably acting more mature than Tom Paris was.</P>
<P>"Tom," she said as she turned and walked back to him. "They are happy. Deal
with it. I hate getting involved in my crewmembers’ romantic lives, but in this
case, I have to say that you don’t have any right to act so wounded. You and
B’Elanna had broken up more than a month before she and Seven went on the away
mission."</P>
<P>"Maybe if you <I>did</I> get involved in romance with the crew this wouldn’t
have happened at all," Tom said before the adult part of his brain could
convince the child part that the words were suicidal.</P>
<P>"You will not take that tone with me." Janeway’s eyes narrowed and Tom Paris
learned first hand that the "instant death" tone was not the most lethal one in
Kathryn Janeway’s arsenal. "And you will not <I>presume</I> to comment on my
personal life."</P>
<P>"Yeah?" he asked. The helmsman often mistook stupidity for bravery. "Well,
that Borg was in love with you before she left, now all of the sudden she’s hot
for Lana? What am I supposed to think?"</P>
<P>"You are supposed to THINK." Janeway stepped closer, her chest inches from
his. She was shorter than him, but somehow managed to use the height
disadvantage to seem more imposing. "Use your brain for once and not a lower
part of your anatomy." She knew the comment was inappropriate, but damn it... He
pissed her off. She didn’t need a sniveling Ensign reminding her that she could
have had Seven if she had just reached out and taken what was offered.</P>
<P>Tom gapped at her. Had she just said what he thought she said?</P>
<P>"Report to the bridge and start working on the course Seven plotted." Kathryn
retreated into captain mode because she wasn’t sure she could keep her temper in
check if the personal nature of the discussion continued. "If I see or hear
about you throwing anymore of your hissy fits, I will put you in the brig… and
Harry will be there with you. You may not give a damn about your own career, but
maybe you’ll have a little respect for his."</P>
<P>That hurt. Harry was Tom’s best friend, and lately he done a pretty good job
of alienating him. "Yes, ma’am," he said. </P>
<P>"Both you and Ensign Kim will be pulling a double shift today. So, after the
alpha shift, Harry will have the bridge. You can ask him what post he wants you
to fill. Don’t be surprised if he has you doing grunt work," Janeway said, some
of the anger draining off her. </P>
<P>"I… I never asked Harry to lie for me," Tom said quietly.</P>
<P>"I know that," Janeway said, "If you had, I would have had you both in the
brig cleaning waste reclaimers with your sonic tooth brushes."</P>
<P>Tom let his expression show his disapproval.</P>
<P>"Yes, Mister Paris, I am not above using the ‘classics’ of military
discipline." She sighed. "Go on, get to work."</P>
<P>"Ma’am?" he paused, looking truly contrite.</P>
<P>"Yes?"</P>
<P>"I’m sorry… I was <I>really</I> out of line with those comments about you."
He looked to her expectantly, like a puppy wanting a bone, except his bone was
absolution. </P>
<P>He didn’t get it. </P>
<P>"Yes, you were," she said. "Dismissed."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna went to her quarters for lunch, hoping she would surprise Seven. She
had asked the computer where Seven was, and was thrilled when the computer
unemotionally stated ‘Seven of Nine is in her quarters.’ Seven’s quarters, not
Lieutenant B’Elanna Torres’ quarters. The computer had simply stated a fact, but
to B’Elanna it was a reminder that her dream was in fact reality. She quickened
her pace as she made her way through the corridors toward…home. </P>
<P>She entered their quarters and smiled when she saw the biosuit Seven had been
wearing earlier in the day. It was tossed across the couch, and B’Elanna
suddenly forgot about lunch and headed for the bedroom. Apparently, Seven had
some other kind of meal in mind for their lunch break. </P>
<P>She paused at the doorway and leaned in, but instead of finding Seven dressed
in a silky nightgown and propped up on a pillow, she found her wife sound
asleep. Seven was wearing a pair of flannel boxers and an oversized tee shirt,
both of which had been replicated to match B’Elanna’s ‘lazy wear.’ B’Elanna
chose the same outfit when she didn’t feeling like doing anything, or… when she
didn’t feel well. B’Elanna rushed to the bed and knelt beside it so she could
study Seven. She brushed her fingers over Seven’s forehead, checking for any
sign of fever. Seven was cool.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes flickered before slowly opening and she sighed, then yawned.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna whispered. She leaned over and kissed the forehead she had
just touched. "You feeling okay?" She looked at Seven, noticing that she had
dark rings under her eyes. "You look tired, darling."</P>
<P>Seven smiled up at her wife and moved to the far side of the bed and patted
the mattress. "I’m fine, just a little tired." She held her hand out to
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Have you seen the Doctor?" B’Elanna put her hands on her hips and gave Seven
a stern look.</P>
<P>"Lana, I’m pregnant. This is normal. Remember how tired Nara used to
get?"</P>
<P>"Okay… but when do you see him again?" B’Elanna kicked off her boots and
crawled onto the bed, groaning when she slid into Seven’s arms.</P>
<P>Seven kissed B’Elanna’s forehead, letting her lips linger on the ridges,
making sure each of the four bumps got equal attention. "I have a check up in
three days… and you know that. You made the appointment."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah…" B’Elanna snuggled closer. She had hoped that Seven had made
another appointment, though it really wasn’t necessary. B’Elanna just worried
about everything. "I’ll meet you in sickbay. It’s at thirteen hundred hours,
right?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. She was smiling and playing with the tie holding
B’Elanna’s ponytail in place. She removed it and sighed when her fingers dug
into B’Elanna’s thick, satiny hair. "I do not mind going alone," she added. She
didn’t want to force B’Elanna to leave engineering, but secretly hopped that she
would be there. Seven didn’t know if Tom Paris was scheduled for sick bay that
day, and he was beginning to get to her with his overt hostility. </P>
<P>"Not a chance," B’Elanna said. She turned her head and kissed Seven’s hand as
it played with her hair. She felt Seven’s body relax, it was subtle, considering
the exdrone was sprawled out comfortably on the mattress, but B’Elanna felt the
change. "What is it?"</P>
<P>"Hmm?" Seven let her eyes close, the idea of a nap pulling at her
consciousness.</P>
<P>"Why are you nervous about the check up? Are you sure you’re okay?" B’Elanna
lifted her weight up onto one elbow so that she could look at Seven.</P>
<P>"I am fine…the baby is fine." Seven’s eyes opened and she saw the concern on
her partner’s face. "It… it is just… I…" Seven sighed. "I believe it is time for
me to have a … discussion with Ensign Paris."</P>
<P>"Tom?" B’Elanna asked, then the realization hit her. Seven was going to
confront him, something B’Elanna knew she should have handled herself before it
began bothering Seven. "No," she ordered.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No. He is my responsibility. I’ll talk to him…today." B’Elanna hoped she
could keep her temper in check with him because she really didn’t want to end up
in the brig.</P>
<P>"I am the one he has the problem with. I will not have you fighting my
battles," Seven said as she sat up. "You do not have to protect me."</P>
<P>"The Hell I don’t," B’Elanna said a bit too quickly. "You’re my wife, and he
is my problem. I have to be the one to talk to him. Just leave him to me. I
don’t want you getting involved."</P>
<P>"I am involved." Seven’s eyes narrowed as her temper kicked in. "And you are
also my wife. It is my responsibility to protect you as well."</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said as she realized her hormonal wife was offended. "I
know you want to help, but this isn’t your place. It’s traditional for the
spouse who was involved with a…trouble maker…to deal with the problem."</P>
<P>"Isn’t my place?" Seven climbed off the bed and stared down at B’Elanna.
Seven’s hair was down, and bounced when she put her hands defiantly on her hips.
"And what is my place? To stay at home while you talk to Tom Paris…while he
tries to convince you that you should return to him, while he tries to seduce
you? I should deal with this…problem. I assure you he will not bother either of
us again."</P>
<P>B’Elanna almost laughed, almost. The idea of returning to Tom was the most
ludicrous thing she had ever heard, but if Seven brought it up, it must be
bothering her. "Seven, Tom has nothing to offer me, nothing to entice me… I have
everything I could ever want right here with you." B’Elanna stood up and moved
in front of Seven. "I’m just gonna explain to him that if he doesn’t leave us
alone…I will rip his face off." B’Elanna wrapped her hands around Seven’s waist
and she looked up at her wife.</P>
<P>"I am more than capable of ripping his face off." Seven’s lips puffed out as
she began her infamous Borg pout.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and leaned into her wife. "I know, love. That’s why I should
handle this." She let her hands migrate around to Seven’s back and then began to
massage the tight muscles of her lower back. "He’s not a complete jerk. I think
he’ll come around."</P>
<P>"I do not wish for him to come around you at all," Seven said with a twinge
of anger in her voice. "I do not like the way he… leers at you."</P>
<P>"Umm, Seven?" B’Elanna eased back and looked up at her. "I have to put up
with ninety percent of the men on board leering at you…and about sixty percent
of the women."</P>
<P>Seven raised her blonde eyebrow, letting B’Elanna know she doubted the
statistics the Klingon had just quoted, then her eyes darkened. "Yes, but I was
never in love with any of them."</P>
<P>"I never felt anything for Tom like I do for you. Yes, I loved him, but it
was… child’s play compared to what we have. You are my heart, you own my soul…
and…" B’Elanna let her hand move onto Seven’s belly, "You are the one having my
baby."</P>
<P>"It is…disconcerting. He doesn’t seem to notice those things." Seven relaxed
as B’Elanna’s hand circled her belly.</P>
<P>"He doesn’t have to. You and I know," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"I try to remember that, but…" Seven sighed again.</P>
<P>"But what?" B’Elanna reached up and caressed Seven’s cheek. "Talk to me,
love."</P>
<P>"It is different for you. I have no past," Seven explained. She felt
B’Elanna’s body stiffen as tension filled her compact frame. "What is it?" Seven
asked.</P>
<P>"You have a past. Your past just has a lot more integrity and class,"
B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Explain." Seven studied B’Elanna’s expression. She didn’t like the worry
lines around her wife’s eyes.</P>
<P>"The captain," B’Elanna said as her eyes locked with Seven’s.</P>
<P>"I had feelings for her at one time, but she did not return them." Confusion
covered Seven’s face. "And you know that you are my life, you gave me my soul,
Be’nal." She stroked B’Elanna’s cheek with the back of her fingers. "You are
everything to me. I love you. My feelings for the captain never filled me the
way you do."</P>
<P>"I love you, too." B’Elanna pressed her cheek against Seven’s fingers.
"But…"</P>
<P>"There are not buts," Seven said sharply. "We love each other…nothing else
matters."</P>
<P>"The captain is in love with you," B’Elanna explained.</P>
<P>"That is… preposterous." Seven’s eyes widened. "She is happy for us. She has
told me so. I have seen her looking at us…together…and she smiles. Tom Paris
does not smile when he looks at us."</P>
<P>"Like I said, she has more integrity and class than Tom."</P>
<P>"That is obvious, but I do not see how that relates to this conversation,"
Seven said.</P>
<P>"Seven, my beloved…" B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "You are so
incredible. Your heart is so true that you don’t even notice how she looks at
you, do you?"</P>
<P>"I do not care how anyone else looks at me. I only care about you." Seven
studied her wife, wondering if she should perhaps pay attention to other
people’s expressions. With the exception of Tom Paris, she really didn’t care
how anyone else looked at her or B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven, I’ve seen the captain when she doesn’t realize I’m watching her. She
loves you, but she can tell you’re happy. She would never interfere with that."
B’Elanna’s face saddened. "Darling, she looks at you like I would if I ever lost
you."</P>
<P>"You will never lose me. How could you even say that?" Anger covered Seven’s
face. </P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna soothed. "I’m not saying that…just that I recognize how much
she loves you." She sighed and rested her forehead on Seven’s chest. "I guess
I’ll talk to her when I finish with Tom."</P>
<P>"No," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Seven, I need to clear the air with her. I have too much respect for her not
to," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"No," Seven repeated. "She is my responsibility. If what you say is true,
then I should handle this."</P>
<P>"I don’t think that’s such a good idea. I have a lot more experience with
this kind of thing." B’Elanna eased back and looked up at Seven, imploring her
to give in.</P>
<P>"So you must handle your own romantic entanglements, but I am incapable of
handling mine?" Seven asked. She was angry, but she knew in the back of her mind
it wouldn’t have bothered her so much if she wasn’t so tired, and if she didn’t
ache all over. She loved being pregnant, but in the last few days, she had felt
progressively worse, not enough to think she was ill, just the cumulative
effects of being tired.</P>
<P>"I didn’t say that," B’Elanna said carefully. She could see the fire in
Seven’s eyes and was working overtime to extinguish it before it burned them
both. "It’s just that you two never actually had a relationship, and…well… since
I understand how easy you are to love…I would be the logical choice," B’Elanna
said as she tired using a more practical approach.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven said. She smiled, seeing right through her wife’s blatant
attempt to shift her focus. "I will speak to the captain. You must let me do
this. It is the right thing to do."</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said. "I’ll talk to Tom, you talk to Janeway, but if you
don’t feel comfortable… I can go with you…"</P>
<P>Seven raised an accusing eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Okay…okay. Besides? How bad can it turn out?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
