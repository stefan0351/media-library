<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 29: Dawn -->

<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she turned to the Doctor. "You’re wrong. You said
yourself the baby is fine, and Seven is strong. Her nanoprobes will help her
hold on until she can regenerate."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," the Doctor said as he pulled the Klingon away from Seven. "Maybe,
if she could regenerate in the next hour, but the baby has been depleting
Seven’s reserves and whatever she programmed the neonatal nanoprobes to do, the
bottom line is that her system is failing. All of her energy, nutrients, even
most of the oxygenated blood cells are being routed directly to the baby. I’ve
been injecting her with triox compounds to increase the oxygen supply and with
systemic electrolytes, which are helping too, but it’s not enough."</P>
<P>"Lana." Seven tried to sit up.</P>
<P>"What is it?" B’Elanna rushed back to Seven’s side.</P>
<P>"Take me to my alcove, now," Seven said. She pleaded with B’Elanna, certainty
filling her blue eyes. "The Doctor should be able to keep my body alive for at
least six hours. The metabolic spike will allow our baby to reach 24 weeks. She
will be able to survive. I will hold on that long. I promise."</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said, pulling away. "You are not going to sacrifice yourself.
No. Absolutely not."</P>
<P>"You promised," Seven reminded her.</P>
<P>"No, I promised that we wouldn’t let him abort our child. I never agreed to
let you throw your life away." B’Elanna turned and went to the captain. "There
has to be another way."</P>
<P>Janeway rubbed her chin, deep in thought, then her eyes locked on B’Elanna.
"We can’t take Seven to her alcove, but maybe we can bring her alcove here."</P>
<P>"What do you have in mind?" the Doctor asked. "Can we bring the Borg alcove
in here?"</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said, shaking her head. "But we can hook something up like
Seven used on the planet… something portable."</P>
<P>"Of course," B’Elanna said. "I should have thought of that. Damn it." She
spun, scanning the engine room. "Parsons, get over here."</P>
<P>A tall engineer turned and walked toward B’Elanna. "What is it, ma’am?"
Parsons asked.</P>
<P>"I have a project. It’s top priority. We need to take one of the portable
power converters and set it up so that Seven can regenerate with it. Take
whoever you need, but you’ve only got an hour to finish," B’Elanna said. She was
going through the list of things she needed, calculating that even with a full
team, it would be difficult to set up in an hour.</P>
<P>Parsons moved closer. "I’ll get right on it, but it took us hours to prepare
the portable regenerator we sent with you and Seven on your last mission."</P>
<P>"Get whoever worked on it last time," B’Elanna ordered. "They have the best
chance of finishing on time."</P>
<P>Parsons glanced at Seven. "Is she gonna’ be okay?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said. "She’s going to get through this. Failure isn’t an
option," she told him. "Bring the supplies in here and we’ll get started."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." He turned and jogged across the engine room to the storage
area.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The Doctor continued working on Seven using monitors and instruments from the
portable medical kit. He had given Seven as much triox compound as he safely
could, trying to keep her blood oxygenated enough for her and the baby. It was a
difficult task considering that the neonatal nanoprobes were actively seeking
out any resources Seven managed to manufacture. The accelerated growth had taken
all of the nutrients from Seven and had even began striping her body of its
fatty deposits, a limited resource the lean exdrone couldn’t afford to lose.
Worse still, the neonatal nanoprobes began breaking down Seven’s muscle mass for
energy.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tuvok stood nearby, checking to make sure that the Doctor didn’t try to
resort to his earlier plan. The hologram saw it as a personal affront to his
integrity, arguing that he had already given his word to Seven and the captain
that he would not try to end the pregnancy. Neelix was close by too, at Seven’s
side whenever B’Elanna would step away to help with the construction of the
portable regenerator. The captain went to the bridge to try to get through the
gravitational river faster.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Chakotay turned when the doors to the bridge opened and stood when he saw
Janeway enter. Her face was impassive, but her eyes were troubled. He could tell
whatever Neelix had called her to sickbay for, it had been especially
unpleasant.</P>
<P>"Captain?" he asked as he moved away from her chair and toward his own. </P>
<P>"At ease, Commander," she said as she waved her hand toward her ready room.
"I’m not staying long." She came down to the command level and leaned next to
Tom Paris. "Tom, I need you to go over the course and see if you can shave any
time off of our trip through this gravitational river."</P>
<P>Tom smirked. Not only was Seven fighting with B’Elanna, it seemed she was
also making mistakes. "Think Seven missed something, ma’am?" he asked a bit too
happily.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said sharply. "I think she plotted the safest course that would
avoid any turbulence. I want you to get us through faster even if it’s a bumpy
ride."</P>
<P>"Okay," Paris said slowly.</P>
<P>"Double-check any new heading, make sure it doesn’t put too much stress on
the hull," Janeway said to Chakotay. "I’ll be in my ready room."</P>
<P>Chakotay nodded and raised both eyebrows, silently asking if she needed to
talk. She shook her head, but he took it to mean that she didn’t want to, not
that she didn’t need to. "All right," he finally said.</P>
<P>Tom turned around and smiled as soon as Janeway disappeared behind the ready
room door. He looked up at Harry. "Guess there’s trouble in paradise if the
captain had to go break up the argument. Hope B’Elanna didn’t bust Seven up as
bad as she did me."</P>
<P>"I think you’re off base," Chakotay said dangerously. "Off base…and out of
line."</P>
<P>"Oh, come on, Chakotay… Seven’s in sickbay… and there’s a fight… She and Lana
were already arguing earlier. What else could it be?"</P>
<P>"Stow it, Paris," the commander said. He looked down at his command panel
reading the latest report from the Doctor. Seven was not improving and the baby
was still in danger. He had been monitoring the read outs, and wondered why the
Doctor had enough time to add notes to the database. He hoped his theory was
wrong, that the Doctor couldn’t do anything to help her so he was busying
himself with updates. He decided to find out from the closest source. "Harry,
you have the bridge. I’ll be in the captain’s ready room."</P>
<P>"Aye, sir," Ensign Kim said as he nodded to a crewman behind him to take over
ops. He took the command chair and watched as Chakotay waited for the captain to
answer the ready room door chime.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Come in," Janeway said. She had been monitoring the Doctor’s reports and was
as nervous as a Ferengi at a charity fund-raiser. "Chakotay? You leaving my
bridge unattended?"</P>
<P>"Harry looks good in your chair," he joked as he came to her desk and sat
without waiting for her permission. "How’s Seven? I can’t tell much from the
updates. It’s all pretty clinical." He didn’t add that what he could understand
didn’t sound promising and he was hoping Kathryn would have better news.</P>
<P>"I’m sure it’s worse than it sounds," she said. Kathryn leaned her weight
onto her elbows on her desk and rested her head on her hands. She rubbed her
closed eyes as if she could remove the images of Seven, pale, sweating, and
trembling from the pain, out of her mind.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, is she going to… I mean… she will be okay, right?" He had never
seen her so visibly upset about any member of the crew.</P>
<P>"I don’t know." Kathryn lifted her head and leaned back in her chair. "The
Doctor…he thinks…" Kathryn sighed and then stood, too tense to sit still. "He
thinks her only chance to…survive… is to abort the child."</P>
<P>"That’s going to break her heart," Chakotay said as he climbed to his feet
and went to the captain’s side. "B’Elanna’s too."</P>
<P>Kathryn shook her head. "Seven refused." She turned and looked into his eyes.
After all they had been through together, she did love him, but more like a
brother than as a lover. "That’s why Neelix needed me in sickbay."</P>
<P>"You didn’t try to talk her into it, did you?" he asked. "I mean, I don’t
want to lose her, but you can’t expect her to just…"</P>
<P>"No," Kathryn said. She put her hand on his shoulder silencing him instantly.
"It’s her choice. Neelix needed me to…" she paused, her jaw clinching as she
remembered beaming into sickbay seeing the Doctor ready to forcefully perform
the abortion. "The Doctor didn’t agree with Seven’s decision. He was overriding
her choice when I arrived."</P>
<P>"Did he?" Chakotay’s eyes darkened and he seemed to grow a few inches
taller.</P>
<P>"No, Neelix and B’Elanna were able to hold him off until I got there."
Kathryn almost smiled at her First Officer. She had seen him protective before,
but now he seemed to take on a dangerous aura. For a Borg drone, Seven certainly
inspired fierce protection. Kathryn carefully explained the entire situation to
Chakotay, hoping he might have a different take on the situation. After telling
Chakotay about her threat to delete the Doctor, she got some advice she hadn’t
expected.</P>
<P>"Kathryn," he said gently. "I think you may have overreacted."</P>
<P>"What?" she demanded. "I made it clear when he treated B’Elanna against her
wishes that this wouldn’t be tolerated. He tortured Seven on the <I>Equinox</I>.
Now, he does this. At least with B’Elanna, he was saving her life, but he was
going to kill Seven’s child. We all talk about Seven’s need to regain her
humanity, but it’s the Doctor who needs humanity."</P>
<P>"I know it’s upsetting, Kathryn," he said softy. "But, it’s his humanity, not
his lack of it, that is the problem."</P>
<P>Janeway looked at him, shocked, too confused to even ask him to clarify.</P>
<P>"Kathryn… if he were human… we would never expect him to treat someone he
cared…no, loved." Chakotay rubbed his jaw and sighed. "He is in love with her.
He didn’t make a cold decision to abort her child. He was panicking, seeing
someone he loved about to die in horrible pain, and he needed to act. It’s a
human reaction. And, even knowing that you might deactivate him after the
incident with B’Elanna, he was willing to give up his existence."</P>
<P>"In love with her?" Janeway paused, wondering what she would do to save
Seven. She would give her own life, that much was true, but force Seven to
sacrifice her unborn child? No. Never. "He has a strange way of showing it."</P>
<P>"Seven is learning to accept her emotions, but she has an advantage."
Chakotay took a deep breath. "Kathryn, she <I>is</I> human. Her body is built to
feel. The Doctor is breaking new ground. He wasn’t designed to feel anything; we
learned that when we lost Ensign Jetal. Plus, the Doctor doesn’t have someone
like B’Elanna to help him adjust."</P>
<P>"Maybe," she said. His words made sense, but she wasn’t ready to forgive the
hologram just yet. She would have to see how Seven recovered, if she recovered,
before she could make that decision.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Okay, that’s it," Samantha Wildman said as she connected the last of the
fittings into place. She was kneeling next to the anti-gravity table that was
resting on a stack of crates. Seven was completely still; she hadn’t moved in
the last half an hour as the engineering crew hurried to complete the portable
regeneration unit.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Sam," B’Elanna said. She was standing next to the stretcher
holding Seven’s limp hand. "Doctor?"</P>
<P>"We should hurry," he said as he scanned Seven again. "We’ll need to reduce
the energy output by forty percent. Her body can’t handle any more. With the
energy this low, she may be able to remain conscious during the
regeneration."</P>
<P>"Do it," B’Elanna said to Ensign Wildman. She leaned down next to her wife
and kissed her temple. "Seven? We’re ready to start your regeneration. Can you
open your eyes, love?"</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes didn’t move, and her breathing was ragged and labored. She had
stopped sweating and her skin was cold and dry.</P>
<P>"Her heart is weakening," the Doctor explained. "When the neonatal nanoprobes
depleted her body’s limited supply of fat cells, they broke down the muscles.
Her heart was badly damaged."</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked again. She heard the Doctor, but didn’t want to
acknowledge his words. It hurt too much. She glanced up when Ensign Wildman
began connecting the regeneration cable to Seven’s back. "Here," B’Elanna
whispered. "Let’s turn her." She rolled her wife toward her, biting her lip when
Seven’s hand flopped limply over the side of the stretcher.</P>
<P>"Okay, she’s hooked up," Samantha said.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes flickered and her hand twitched. "Lana," she said, the word more
like a breath.</P>
<P>"I’m here, love." B’Elanna pulled the hair from Seven’s brow, the dried sweat
caking it against her skin.</P>
<P>"Cold," Seven whispered as she shivered. "So slow," she added.</P>
<P>B’Elanna tugged the fur blanket up and over the regeneration cables. "There,
is that better?"</P>
<P>"Slow…" Seven whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was confused, and she looked up at the Doctor who was studying his
tricorder with a frown. "What is slow?" she finally asked.</P>
<P>"The drum," Seven replied. "So slow."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes shot open wide and she stood up straight and pinned the
Doctor in her gaze. "Is her heart slowing?" she demanded.</P>
<P>"Yes," he said, puzzled. "The regeneration is already helping the fetus, and
helping with the damaged abdominal muscles, but…her heart, it’s not healing.
I’ve seen similar damage described in the historical medical records. Victims of
starvation often had heart damage when their bodies actually began feeding on
their own muscle. Seven’s remaining heart tissue is dying, but her nanoprobes
should be reviving them."</P>
<P>"Shouldn’t the nanoprobes repair the dead tissue? Like they did for me when
Seven saved me?" Neelix stepped forward. He remembered the miracle the
nanoprobes had done when he had…died. </P>
<P>"They should be," the Doctor said with shake of his head. "But they’re
not."</P>
<P>"Sam, help me," B’Elanna ordered. She eased back the fur. "Roll her onto her
side. I’m getting up here with her." Ensign Wildman immediately reached out to
help her.</P>
<P>"Just a minute," the Doctor said in a huff. "This is completely out of the
question."</P>
<P>"If I don’t get her heart rate up, she’ll die," B’Elanna said as she tossed
off her jacket.</P>
<P>"And how do you plan on doing that?" the Doctor demanded. "I can’t give her
any medication, just what can you do? Will her to get well?"</P>
<P>"She’ll hear my heart and match the rhythm." B’Elanna slid under the fur and
eased Seven toward her. "Sam, get her head onto my chest… easy. Careful of her
belly."</P>
<P>"This is insane," the Doctor said as he shook his head. "I had no idea you
were such a romantic, Lieutenant. But as romantic as that seems to you, and
contrary to Klingon belief… you can’t share a heartbeat with someone else… no
matter what your myth says about the great Kahless," he added. He was familiar
with the Klingon history, and the misguided belief that Kahless and his bride
shared the same heartbeat once they were married.</P>
<P>"Actually, Doctor, I believe that you are the one who is mistaken," Tuvok
said calmly. He moved over and easily lifted Seven and positioned her face over
B’Elanna’s heart. "Vulcans in deep meditative states can alter their coronary
rhythm to match their <I>Sim’re</I> <I>katra</I>… their vision master. It is
possible that someone as mentally structured as Seven could alter her heart to a
beat she hears. It is <I>ni’var</I>, the sacred duality of things. A unity of
two becoming one."</P>
<P>"Poppycock," the Doctor declared. "Seven is not Vulcan, she is injured, and
she needs medicine, not myth." The hologram rolled his eyes. "Vulcan romantic
fairytales."</P>
<P>"She’s done it before," B’Elanna said quietly, trying to calm her own heart.
"On the planet, during a vision quest. She would have died if she hadn’t used my
heartbeat to come back."</P>
<P>"Fascinating," Tuvok said as one eyebrow shot up on his forehead.</P>
<P>"Yes, <I>fascinating</I>," the Doctor said mockingly. "It’s all just
fascinating. Too bad we can’t…" he paused as he scanned Seven. "Her heart rate
is stabilizing."</P>
<P>"Indeed," Tuvok said. His expression would have been smug, if Vulcans were
prone to emotion. "It would seem in the absence of medicine, she chose myth.
Perhaps she believes in Vulcan fairytales." </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>For the next six hours, B’Elanna held Seven to her chest, and with each
minute that passed, she thanked Kahless. Every minute was more than the Doctor
had expected, and every moment meant the regeneration had more time to help
Seven’s body regain its strength. </P>
<P>The hologram continued his scans, amazed that Seven was alive, let alone
seemed to be making progress. As Seven’s heart began to mend, he felt as if his
matrix were stabilizing for the first time all day. Ever since Seven had been
carried into sickbay, he had felt like his matrix was about to begin a cascade
breakdown, he could barely access the necessary data, and he felt driven to do
whatever was necessary to keep Seven alive. He also felt like ignoring any
nonscientific measures, which made no sense. He would run a complete diagnostic
as soon as Seven was safe. For now, he muddled through, going back to the
familiar, scanning her and injecting her with triox compound; it was the only
thing he had found that would cross the metabolic barrier between Seven and the
baby. Even with the temporal differential reduced to a minuscule variant, the
other medications were rendered inactive or altered to a toxic level. He
theorized that it was because triox was only an altered oxygen molecule and it
wasn’t seen as a foreign element to Seven or the child. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the child’s neonatal nanoprobes were still superseding Seven’s
needs in favor of the fetus’. Even with the added energy from the regeneration,
Seven’s systems were still stressed to the very limit of survival.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"I’m telling you, Harry, B’Elanna and Seven are history." Tom Paris had
turned his pilot’s chair around and was chatting with his friend.</P>
<P>"Tom, they were just having an argument." Harry checked the ship’s course and
then looked up from the command console. "And I don’t think Seven is in sickbay
because of a disagreement with B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Yeah?" Tom asked as he crossed his arms over his chest. "Well… remember when
Lana and I had our disagreement? Half the crew ended up in sickbay."</P>
<P>"No," Harry said, shaking his head. "Seven would never cheat on B’Elanna. No
way."</P>
<P>"I didn’t cheat on her," Tom yelled. "It was a hologram."</P>
<P>"Whatever, Tom." Harry raised his hands to signal that he wasn’t starting a
fight with the helmsman. "All I’m saying is that Seven doesn’t look at anyone
else, real or hologram… and she would never touch anyone else. B’Elanna is the
only one she wants or needs."</P>
<P>"Give her time." Tom turned back toward his helm controls.</P>
<P>"If she has time," Harry said quietly. He had been reading the command
reports from the Doctor. He didn’t like the way the Doctor described her
condition as <I>gravely critical</I>. Harry hadn’t heard adjective ever paired
with the term ‘critical,’ and he decided that the imaginative Doctor must have
decided merely using critical wasn’t sufficient.</P>
<P>"What’s that mean?" Tom turned back around and gave Harry his full
attention.</P>
<P>"Nothing…" Harry stalled.</P>
<P>"What? What is it?" Paris demanded. "Are you getting something on the command
console? Is Lana okay?"</P>
<P>Harry rolled his eyes. "B’Elanna is fine. Seven is… well, I don’t know how
she is. I’ve never heard about half of this stuff, but whatever it is…it isn’t
good."</P>
<P>"Like what?" As medical assistant, Paris had been somewhat surprised he
hadn’t been called to assist, but decided if either of the women had been in
danger, he would have been called to help.</P>
<P>"Tom, what is cardiac necrosis? And… what does it mean if a procedure has a
high probability of two hundred percent mortality?" Harry asked. He knew he
shouldn’t announce the reports from the command console, but what little
understanding he had of medical terminology told him that Seven was in serious
trouble.</P>
<P>Tom’s face lost all color and his eyes narrowed. "Harry, that isn’t
funny."</P>
<P>"I’m not kidding, Tom. What does it mean?" Harry watched as his arrogant
friend seemed to sink into his chair.</P>
<P>"Two hundred percent mortality is a term used only during a pregnancy. It
refers to something that can kill the mother and child." Tom tried to swallow,
but his mouth had gone dry. "Cardiac necrosis is when the tissue of the heart
dies…it’s irreversible."</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" Harry asked, his voice squeaking as his own throat
constricted.</P>
<P>"Harry, I may goof off and forget little things, but these are terms that
scared me when I learned them. You don’t just forget them." He rubbed his face,
hoping that his own antics hadn’t caused any of Seven’s problems. He wanted her
upset, hell… he wanted her to explode and confront B’Elanna, but he never wanted
her or her baby hurt. </P>
<P>Chakotay came onto the bridge, he took one look at Harry’s guilty expression
and Tom’s look of complete shock, and glared at both men.</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim, the command reports are not for general crew distribution."
Chakotay tried to give him a Janeway glare, but his brown eyes didn’t have the
smoldering, dangerous quality the captain’s did. Still, it was enough to make
Harry sit up straight and almost swallow his own tongue.</P>
<P>"Sir?" Ensign Kim asked.</P>
<P>"Give it up, Harry," Chakotay said as he nodded toward the command chair.
"You got caught. Just be glad it was me, and not the captain."</P>
<P>"Yes, sir," Harry said as he stood and gave his seat to Chakotay.</P>
<P>"Sir?" Paris asked. "Should I be helping the Doc?"</P>
<P>Chakotay sat and took a deep breath, then slowly released it. "It won’t
matter, Mister Paris, but thanks for offering. They’re doing everything they
can. I just hope it’s enough." </P>
