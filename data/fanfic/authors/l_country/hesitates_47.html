<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 47: Investigations -->

<P>"Federation law is very clear on this matter," the Doctor said. He handed the
captain a data padd. "There has been genetic tampering."</P>
<P>"Well, of course there was," Janeway said with a disgusted sigh. "They are
two women. They had to tamper with the genetic material to even conceive."</P>
<P>"I am aware of that," the Doctor snapped. "These are not those kinds of
irregularities. This child is perfect," he said as if that explained
everything.</P>
<P>"And?" Janeway demanded.</P>
<P>"Genetically perfect," Opaca said. "It is a statistical impossibility. There
isn’t so much as one chromosome with any defect. Nothing."</P>
<P>"And this is a problem…why?" Janeway leaned against the wall and studied the
readings on the padd. In the back of her mind her human genetics classes were
coming back to her. "There should be minor mistakes…on the molecular level," she
said quietly.</P>
<P>"Yes," the Doctor said. "And there should be traits that are recessive,
undesirable traits that should show up. There aren’t any."</P>
<P>"And this couldn’t be random chance?" Kathryn tapped the padd changing the
screen to a read out of Kayla Torres’ chromosome map.</P>
<P>"No," Opaca said quietly. She moved next to Kathryn and leaned against her
shoulder and pointed to a strand on the screen. "That’s a common pair there. It
determines eye color. With B’Elanna’s brown eyes, Kayla should have brown as
well. B’Elanna doesn’t carry a blue eye gene."</P>
<P>"And Kayla’s eyes are going to be blue?" Kathryn asked. She noticed that
Opaca’s matrix was very well designed; the hologram put off body heat.</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said. "Instead of using one chromosome from each parent…Kayla
somehow ended up doubling Seven’s on this gene. Her eyes will be exactly the
color of Seven’s."</P>
<P>"Why?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"They obviously tampered with her genetic code," the Doctor said. "And that
is illegal. From the looks of her chromosome map… every single trait has been
altered to the most perfect possible combination. I guess Seven took Borg
perfection a little too seriously. Lieutenant Torres should have known
better."</P>
<P>"You can’t honestly believe that B’Elanna and Seven did this intentionally?"
Janeway put the padd on his desk and gave the Doctor her most lethal glare.</P>
<P>"I don’t," Opaca said. "We know Seven used Borg technology to conceive. I
think the nanoprobes just did what Borg nanoprobes do…they make perfection."</P>
<P>"Really?" the Doctor asked sarcastically. "And since when do the Borg care
about eye color?"</P>
<P>Opaca rolled her eyes and stomped her foot. "You can be so stubborn," she
said. "There has been research that suggests blue eyed space travelers have less
space sickness. It’s one of the reasons so many Klingons get space sick. Most of
them have brown eyes."</P>
<P>"Pure speculation," the Doctor said. </P>
<P>"What difference could eye color possibly make?" Janeway asked. Opaca turned
to her and smiled warmly. It was very disarming and reminded Kathryn of someone
she knew but she couldn’t place who it was. </P>
<P>"Captain, eye color can effect sensitivity to sunlight, so why not the
effects of weightlessness?" Opaca asked. "Blue eyes are slightly more resilient
and hold their shape a bit better in zero G. That would effect space
sickness."</P>
<P>"You think the nanoprobes did all this… remapping?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"Impossible," the Doctor said. "I can’t believe that Seven and B’Elanna
didn’t have some control over this. It’s just too… perfect."</P>
<P>"Exactly," Opaca said as she tossed her hands into the air. "When mankind
tampers with genetics…they don’t ever do it well. All of the eugenics wars
showed us that. Any product of chromosomal tampering shows signs of genetic
problems in other areas. Usually mental instability, and Kayla doesn’t show any
defective genes. Not one. If Seven and B’Elanna did do this, she wouldn’t be so
perfect."</P>
<P>"What did they say?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"Well, umm…." the Doctor looked away.</P>
<P>"You haven’t asked them?" Kathryn sighed and rolled her head back and rubbed
her neck. "Why not?"</P>
<P>"He wouldn’t let me," Opaca said. "And as long as he wasn’t endangering my
patient…my program won’t let me override him."</P>
<P>"Why don’t we ask them?" Janeway suggested. She shook her head. "Doctor, why
did you have to make this so difficult?"</P>
<P>"Protocol dictates that I speak with you so that we can prepare charges
against them. I can’t legally talk to them before I contact the authorities…and
here in the Delta Quadrant…that’s you."</P>
<P>"Lucky me," Kathryn said under her breath.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"It is my turn," Seven said as she climbed on top on B’Elanna. The former
drone had rested for all of six minutes and was now fully recharged.</P>
<P>"And just what are you going to do to me?" B’Elanna asked. She could feel
Seven’s wetness seeping through the silk of her nightgown. She wiggled and
looked up at Seven, her eyes sending a silent challenge.</P>
<P>"First, I must get this out of the way," Seven said as she hooked her finger
on the top of B’Elanna’s gown. She grabbed it with both hands and ripped it down
the front. "That is better." She leaned down and kissed the newly exposed
skin.</P>
<P>"Do you have any idea how many rations we waste when you do that?" B’Elanna
wrapped her hands around Seven’s waist.</P>
<P>"Do you care?" Seven moved her mouth to B’Elanna’s throat and kissed her
pulse point.</P>
<P>"Not at all." B’Elanna sighed happily.</P>
<P>Seven began nibbling on B’Elanna’s earlobe. "Do we still have the dermal
regenerator in the drawer?"</P>
<P>"Why? Did I hurt you?" B’Elanna pushed Seven up and tried to examine the
marks on her breast and side.</P>
<P>"No, my Be’nal," Seven said as she pressed B’Elanna’s hands above her head.
"But I intend to mark you where you most enjoy it, and we cannot leave those
marks or you will blush." She leaned down and bit the spot in question. B’Elanna
loved the feel of Seven sucking on her throat, high on her neck, far too high to
be hidden beneath a uniform.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said. She turned head exposing her neck and laughed. "You
know, you have a very large vampire streak in you, my love."</P>
<P>Seven moaned and sucked B’Elanna’s neck, then eased back. "Indeed?" she
asked, her voice taking on a perfect Transylvanian accent. "I intend to drink
more than your blood, my beloved."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and pulled Seven to her and kissed her nose. "How do you do
that?" she asked. "That sounds just like those awful movies from old Earth."</P>
<P>"I want to be accurate," Seven said in her vampire accent. Her eyes were
lidded and more seductive than any vampire. She kissed B’Elanna slowly, mapping
every inch of her mouth until both women were breathless.</P>
<P>"Do the Klingon vampire," B’Elanna begged.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow and smiled. "JachchoHmeH 'Iwraj penaghtaH," she said
in Klingonasse somehow managing to use perfect Klingon phrasing and grammar yet
using a distinctly Transylvanian accent.</P>
<P>"Promise?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Seven nodded.</P>
<P>"Now, in English," the Klingon giggled.</P>
<P>"I will pleasure you until your blood screams," Seven said with her
Transylvania accent. "Then I will drink you," she added.</P>
<P>"Right now." B’Elanna pulled Seven down to her. Seven’s kisses were gentle,
but commanding and always left B’Elanna feeling completely satisfied, yet always
wanting more. The Klingon lost herself in the contact and felt the familiar
flame burning deep in her belly.</P>
<P>Seven pulled away and moved to B’Elanna’s neck and began marking her wife.
Her lips wrapped around the sensitive flesh and she moaned as she sucked loudly.
"Mine," Seven whispered. She moved further down B’Elanna’s neck and bit her
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am," B’Elanna said happily.</P>
<P>After several minutes of enthusiastically marking both sides of B’Elanna’s
neck, Seven shifted her weight and settled next to her wife and caressed her
cheek. "I never knew making love could be so pleasurable on so many levels," she
said as she leaned over and kissed B’Elanna, biting her lower lip. "I had no
idea there would be so much laughter."</P>
<P>B’Elanna hooked her leg over Seven’s hip, urging her closer until their
bodies molded together. "It’s incredible with you…every time." She traced
Seven’s lips with her finger and then down her jaw to her implant. "All my life
I never knew what was missing, and now I do. You. You are my soulmate." She
leaned over and left a sweet, gentle kiss on Seven’s lips, easing back so that
she could look into her lapis blue eyes. "How could I have been so blind when we
first met? I thought you were cold and unemotional."</P>
<P>"I was." Seven took B’Elanna’s hand and kissed each knuckle. "I was hiding
from my soul. The Borg had it so completely buried that only a stubborn Klingon
could find it."</P>
<P>"You’re wrong, my beloved," B’Elanna whispered as her hand caressed Seven’s
chest, stopping to play with her bonding necklace. "You gave me back my soul. I
never laughed like this before. I was so serious in bed. I thought I had to be
some…some… Klingon ideal. I missed the point completely. I was having sex. I
never made love until I was with you."</P>
<P>"Perhaps…" Seven said as she leaned over and kissed B’Elanna on each side of
her mouth, "We could only awaken this in each other." She moved her kisses
closer and traced her wife’s lips with the tip of her tongue. "We are a puzzle
that can only be solved when we are joined." She nipped B’Elanna’s lip, seeking
entrance.</P>
<P>"My Borg poet." B’Elanna let Seven into her mouth. </P>
<P>They absorbed each other through their kisses, slowly, taking all the time in
the universe. Gradually their hands began to explore. B’Elanna mirrored each
touch of Seven’s hand, each fleeting caress becoming gentler until it was almost
a whisper on their skin. They both savored this type of lovemaking. It built a
fire slowly, the heat smoldering as they focused completely on the other’s
fingers to register the sensual flickering like a warm breeze across bare skin.
</P>
<P>Seven escalated the touches first, letting her hand trail over B’Elanna’s
belly and down to the wetness she longed to get lost in. Both women moaned at
the first contact, and Seven entwined her legs with B’Elanna’s so that her wife
could have equal access. Their kiss broke and they rested their faces on the
same pillow, inches apart, their eyes locked. Each twin caress escalated the
trembling as the bundles of nerves burst into white-hot flame. Each touch sent
both women closer to oblivion as they fell deeper into each other’s eyes.</P>
<P>Seven whimpered and her eyes half closed as she reached the peak first. She
fought against the fall, wanting to bring her wife with her into bliss. B’Elanna
felt the telltale flutters under her fingers and knew that Seven was holding
back, waiting for her.</P>
<P>"I love you, my Be’nal," B’Elanna whispered huskily as she slowed her
touch.</P>
<P>"Lana… I love you." Seven fought to get the words out. Her body cried out for
release but she needed to wait for her beloved. Her fingers slid lower, her
longer arms allowing her a better reach, and she dipped inside of B’Elanna and
the Klingon’s eyes rolled back as she moaned.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna whispered. Her fingers went back to the place she knew Seven
needed them and they both leaned their faces closer until their foreheads
touched as they fell.</P>
<P>Seven wrapped her arms around B’Elanna and pulled her close as they rode out
the aftershocks in a tender embrace. They took slow, ragged breaths as their
hearts slowed. They were silent. There was no need for words. Their connection
was so intense that it left them both with tears threatening to fall as they
drifted off into peaceful sleep.</P>
<P>Ten minutes later B’Elanna’s eyes shot open and she groaned. Seven opened her
eyes and pulled away and looked between them at the growing pool of milk
gathering on the sheets. Seven tried not to laugh, she really did, but it was
too much for her.</P>
<P>"Moo?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna gave her wife an answer. She hit her with a pillow and straddled
her, letting the leaking milk drip onto Seven’s belly. "This is not funny."</P>
<P>"Yes…it…is," Seven said as she tried to worm her way out from under B’Elanna.
</P>
<P>The Klingon tightened her knees, pinning the Borg in place.</P>
<P>Seven glanced over at the nightstand. "Are you certain that we could not use
the pump for a little…wife time?"</P>
<P>"Woman! You are a sex machine," B’Elanna said as she hit Seven with the
pillow again.</P>
<P>"Are you complaining?" Seven asked between hits.</P>
<P>"Hell, no." B’Elanna tossed the pillow off of the bed and leaned down to kiss
Seven. She was going to ignore the wetness from her milk between them, but the
chiming of the door made that a moot point.</P>
<P>"Send them away," Seven ordered when B’Elanna tried to sit up. Seven had her
firmly pinned to her chest.</P>
<P>"Let me up and I will." B’Elanna leaned closer and bit her wife’s lip.</P>
<P>"It is difficult to let you up when you are enticing me to keep you," Seven
said between kisses. The door chime sounded again.</P>
<P>"Let me up," B’Elanna offered, "And I will kill them with my bat’tleth. It
should only take two minutes."</P>
<P>Seven rolled B’Elanna over and climbed off of her. "It will only take me
thirty seconds."</P>
<P>"Seven…darling…" B’Elanna jumped up and ran after her wife. "Sweet Kahless,
you can’t really kill them."</P>
<P>Seven turned and raised an eyebrow at her wife. She handed her a tee shirt
and a pair of sweats since the Klingon’s robe was still in the living room.</P>
<P>"Okay… I knew you weren’t going to kill them," B’Elanna said as she pulled
the shirt over her leaking breasts.</P>
<P>"Go deal with… those," Seven said, pointing to the growing milk stains on the
tee shirt. "I will deal with whoever is at the door." Seven pulled on her own
robe and yanked the belt tight around her waist.</P>
<P>"How come I had to be the damn milk cow?" B’Elanna went to the dresser,
growling. She saw one of her shoes and kicked it across the room. "Stupid milk
cow."</P>
<P>Seven opened the door and glared at the captain. She quickly changed her
expression and stood up straight and linked her hands behind her back.</P>
<P>"Captain, how may I help you?" Seven asked formally.</P>
<P>"I need to talk to you and B’Elanna," Kathryn said. She looked at Seven and
noticed that her hair was not in its braid. It was a mess. It looked like she
had been sucked out of an airlock, and then Kathryn realized that whatever Seven
and B’Elanna had been doing, it was obviously a lot more strenuous than any
decompression. "I’m sorry to interrupt," she said as she cleared her throat.</P>
<P>"We were finished." Seven motioned for the captain to come in. "For the
moment," she added.</P>
<P>"I see," Kathryn said, though she really wished she didn’t understand the
implications of the statement. It was a miracle poor B’Elanna had survived three
years with Seven.</P>
<P>B’Elanna came out of the bedroom wearing a fresh tee shirt that didn’t have
milk stains ringing her breasts. "Captain?" she asked as she tried to casually
settle the nursing pads into place in her bra.</P>
<P>"Perhaps we could sit down?" Kathryn asked. She tried not to notice the
hickeys on both sides of B’Elanna’s neck. <I>‘Seven is going to kill her,</I>’
Kathryn thought as she sat on the couch. <I>‘I’m going to get a call from
sickbay and find B’Elanna dead…She’ll have a huge smile on her face…but she’ll
be dead.’ </P></I>
<P>"What is it?" Seven asked as she sat. B’Elanna sat beside her on the arm of
the couch. </P>
<P>"Kathryn, you’re scaring me. Is everything all right?" B’Elanna asked. Her
hand seemed to migrate onto Seven’s shoulder and she rubbed the tense muscles of
her wife’s neck.</P>
<P>"When Kayla was conceived, did you do anything unusual?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s face turned bright red and her eyes widened.</P>
<P>"Why? Seven asked. She reached up and linked her fingers with B’Elanna’s on
her shoulder. "What is wrong?"</P>
<P>"There are genetic irregularities," Kathryn said quietly.</P>
<P>"What’s wrong with her?" B’Elanna asked. "Why didn’t Opaca tell us?"</P>
<P>Seven’s face drained of color, the beautiful pink afterglow disappearing
completely as her face turned a chalky white.</P>
<P>"Nothing is wrong with her," Kathryn assured them. "That’s actually the
problem."</P>
<P>"Is she ill?" Seven asked in a whisper.</P>
<P>"No." Kathryn moved closer and rested her hand on Seven’s knee. "The problem
is that she is genetically perfect. Almost as if there was genetic
tampering."</P>
<P>"That’s illegal," B’Elanna said, confusion filling her voice. "And stupid.
Those scientists always screw something up when they mess with chromosomes."</P>
<P>"So… you two didn’t?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"No!" B’Elanna crinkled her face, showing her disgust. "Why would we do
that?"</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes…" Seven said quietly as she stood and moved away from the
couch. "It was my nanoprobes, wasn’t it?" She stared down at her Borg hand,
turning it as if studying a horrible disfigurement. </P>
<P>"That’s what Opaca thinks," Janeway said. "She thinks your nanoprobes
selected each genetic trait that was most beneficial and corrected any defects."
</P>
<P>"I have made my child… a Borg?" Seven asked as she moved further away.</P>
<P>"She’s not a Borg," B’Elanna insisted. She stood and went to Seven. "She’s
our child, and you didn’t do anything wrong."</P>
<P>"There isn’t anything wrong with her, Seven," Janeway said. "Opaca says the
worst thing you’ll have to face is that she’ll be smarter and more coordinated
than other children. That doesn’t sound too bad, now does it?"</P>
<P>"We already knew she was going to be smart," B’Elanna said as she hugged
Seven. "With us as her SoSoys how could she not be?"</P>
<P>"No one will know. I assure you." Kathryn moved over to the two women. "I
just had to make sure you two didn’t do this intentionally."</P>
<P>"Why would we?" Seven asked. "Why would anyone make their child…different? I
know the pain of that. I would never make my child endure that…and yet…I
have."</P>
<P>"Be’nal," B’Elanna said as she rubbed Seven’s back. "It’s going to be fine.
We will get through this." She turned to Kathryn. "How smart are we talking?"
B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Opaca said that she can’t be any smarter than the genetic material you two
supplied. The nanoprobes just…stacked the deck in her favor." Kathryn gave
B’Elanna a half grin and nodded toward Seven. "I’d say that means pretty damn
smart."</P>
<P>"They did not… alter her genes?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No, they just gave her the best of what there was to work with," Kathryn
said with a smile. "Of course, given who her moms are…I think that’s still an
unfair advantage."</P>
<P>"If they chose the best of the material," Seven said. "Kayla would look
exactly like B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Hey, I’m kinda’ partial to your looks," B’Elanna said. </P>
<P>"Well, she will have Seven’s blue eyes," Kathryn volunteered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled. "I love your eyes," she said as she turned to Seven.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, are you sure Kayla will be normal?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"She will not be any more intelligent or strong than either of you. She will
have the advantage of having every gene being perfect." Kathryn moved closer.
"All things considered, I think that is a pretty nice legacy."</P>
<P>"I still think Opaca should have told us." Seven pulled B’Elanna’s arms
around her waist.</P>
<P>"The Doctor wouldn’t let her," Kathryn explained.</P>
<P>"What is wrong with him?" B’Elanna said with a growl.</P>
<P>"Calm down," Kathryn said. "I had a long talk with him today. And I’m meeting
Opaca in my quarters when I finish here. I want her to be free to override the
Doctor’s decisions even when it isn’t a matter of life and death."</P>
<P>"She must have been troubled by not being able to tell us," Seven said
quietly. "She cares very much for us…and Kayla."</P>
<P>"Yes, she does," Kathryn said. "And that’s something else that troubles me.
She isn’t supposed to have feelings at all."</P>
<P>"She acts as if she was programmed with emotions," B’Elanna said. "I just
thought Harry did a really good job mimicking feelings…but she seems… like
there’s more to it."</P>
<P>"She is certainly better adjusted than the Doctor," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Adjusted or not," Kathryn said grimly. "She isn’t supposed to feel anything.
I may not be an expert with holographic matrixes, but that woman has feelings."
Kathryn sighed and rubbed her forehead. "I’ll leave you two alone. I have to go
get to the bottom of this."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Kathryn. I am glad you told us," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Yes, thank you," B’Elanna added. </P>
<P>"You’re welcome," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>Seven walked Kathryn to the door and waved as she left. She turned and looked
into B’Elanna’s eyes and then ran to her.</P>
<P>"Shh, love." B’Elanna held Seven to her. "It’s gonna’ be okay. Kayla is
healthy. She’s gonna’ be fine."</P>
<P>"I am sorry," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>"Don’t be sorry." B’Elanna squeezed her tighter. "Without your nanoprobes, we
wouldn’t even have our beautiful daughter. Don’t ever apologize for that."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and sniffled as B’Elanna held her.</P>
