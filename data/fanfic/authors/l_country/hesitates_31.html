<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 31: Reunion and Retribution. -->

<P>*"Janeway to Torres."* </P></I>
<P>"Yes, Captain?" B’Elanna asked as she sat up. She was sitting in a chair next
to Seven’s biobed in the sickbay. The exdrone had dozed off after the Doctor had
finished repairing the damage to her stomach muscles.</P><I>
<P>*"Lieutenant, I need you in conference room one right away,"*</I> Janeway
said over the comm.</P>
<P>"On my way, ma’am," B’Elanna said as she stood.</P><I>
<P>*"Understood. Janeway out."*</P></I>
<P>Seven sat up and started to swing her legs off of the biobed.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. She reached out and gently gripped Seven’s legs. "You
are staying right here. I’ll take care of whatever the problem is and be back
before you know it."</P>
<P>"I am feeling much better," Seven insisted. "What would it hurt if I
accompanied you?"</P>
<P>"Because…I would be worrying about you, and not the ship. We promised to put
the ship first." B’Elanna stepped back and went to the next biobed where Neelix
was sleeping. Tuvok had left, convinced that the Doctor would follow orders, but
Neelix had insisted on staying with Seven. B’Elanna reached down and shook the
Talaxian by the shoulder.</P>
<P>"What?" Neelix said as he sat up and looked around the room. "Seven? Is she
okay?"</P>
<P>"I am fine, Mister Neelix," Seven said. She liked the Talaxian, and while
many on the ship saw him as somewhat comical, Seven had a new appreciation for
his bravery. "Thank you, for your concern."</P>
<P>"Oh, well…Seven…I was just doing what anyone would have done." Neelix
blushed, his yellowish face shading to a bright orange. Even his spots
darkened.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she straightened her uniform jacket. "You acted with
honor. I owe you more than I can ever say." She saw that he was embarrassed, so
she changed the subject. "I have to go for now. Can you sit with Seven?"</P>
<P>"Of course," he said happily and hopped off of the biobed. His short nap had
invigorated him. "I’ll keep her company until you get back." He patted
B’Elanna’s shoulder. "Don’t you worry, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>"I’m sure she couldn’t be in better hands," B’Elanna said as she headed for
the door.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Neelix choked out. He knew the reserved Klingon didn’t hand out
compliments easily, and more importantly, she didn’t trust the welfare of her
wife and child to just anyone.</P>
<P>The doors hissed shut behind B’Elanna, and Neelix turned to look at Seven.
She raised an eyebrow and nodded.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Mister Neelix." Seven looked down. It was her turn to blush. "You
protected my child when I could not. I will not forget that."</P>
<P>"Seven," Neelix whispered. He stood next to the biobed and studied Seven’s
visibly larger belly and he smiled, imagining the tiny life being nurtured
within her body. "I have seen too many lives cut short to stand by and watch one
taken before it begins." He held out his hand, hesitating as if he was afraid to
touch her, that she might disappear before his eyes. His furry yellow hand
shook. </P>
<P>"I will not forget," Seven repeated. She took his hand in hers and pressed it
to her stomach. He was still shaking, but seemed calmer.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna hurried down the corridor to the conference room. She knew whatever
the problem was, it must be important. Janeway wouldn’t have called her away
from Seven if it hadn’t been an emergency. Both she and Seven were not even off
of their leave yet, and if the gravitational river hadn’t called them away from
their rest, they would both be in their quarters…probably making love. Except
that they had needed to use the gravitational river…and now Seven was in
sickbay. She paused for a brief instant to smooth her tunic and then went into
the room.</P>
<P>Captain Janeway was sitting at the main table looking over a data padd when
the door opened. She looked up and smiled. It wasn’t the reaction B’Elanna
expected during an emergency.</P>
<P>"Captain? What can I do for you?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Well, now," Nara said from her vantage point at the far side of the room.
"Rrrrr," she growled as B’Elanna spun toward the sound of her voice. "If I’d
known you looked this handsome in uniform, I would have given your wife some
competition."</P>
<P>"Nara?" B’Elanna yelled as she ran to the densely muscled woman. "By Kahless,
am I glad to see you." She grabbed Nara and lifted her up in fierce hug, making
the Narian squeak</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat. "I take it she is who she says she is?" Kathryn
was completely unprepared to see such an emotional display from the Klingon.
</P>
<P>"This is Nara. She helped Seven and I on the planet," B’Elanna said once she
finally released her friend. She turned back to Nara. "Where are Tach and
Ty?"</P>
<P>Nara nodded toward the bathroom door that was attached to the conference
room. "Ty wasn’t impressed by replicated…umm, what was that?" she asked the
captain.</P>
<P>"Strained peas," Janeway said with a wry grin. "Can’t say that I blame
him."</P>
<P>The bathroom door opened and Tach came out with Ty on his hip. Tach’s pale
brown shirt had a large green blotch that was edged by a darkened area that was
proof of the large amounts of water he had tried to rinse it out with.</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty squealed. "My Ba! Now!" He wiggled in his father’s arms.</P>
<P>"Ty." B’Elanna went toward Tach, feeling her throat constrict. She didn’t
even try to hold her emotions in check. "My little Tiger! I’ve missed you." She
reached out for the child just as he was escaping his father’s grip. His little
body was a sorely missed weight in her arms. She held him to her chest, inhaling
the scent of his hair. She felt tears on her cheeks as she kissed his jet-black
hair.</P>
<P>"My Ba back. Good Ba," he said as he enjoyed her hug. "Ba stay," he pleaded,
then arched his back and looked around the room. He squirmed in her arms as he
scanned the room. His eyes stopped on Janeway, who was in shock, a half smile on
her face as she watched her Klingon chief engineer who was completely at home
with the dark haired boy on her hip. </P>
<P>"Oh sweetie, I’m here now," B’Elanna said as she kissed his cheeks over and
over again.</P>
<P>He arched away and looked at her. His eyebrows crinkled together on his thick
ridgebrow. "Where Evan?" he demanded. His lip pulled down in a pout he had
learned from the former Borg. "Go to my Evan, now?" His eyes held the internal
hope that seemed reserved for childhood.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and squeezed him to her. "Your Seven missed you, Tiger." She
turned and looked at Tach who was waiting patiently to be noticed. "Hey," she
said with a smile. "Get over here, you old goat." She held out one arm and gave
him a half hug around his son who was not letting go anytime soon.</P>
<P>Tach smiled, letting his dear friend take her fill of the contact, knowing
she had not seen him in months, not just the week he had been away from her.
When she moved away, she smiled warmly at him.</P>
<P>"My little one missed you," Tach said. He nodded at the tyke who had his tiny
fists buried in B’Elanna’s hair to make sure that she didn’t escape.</P>
<P>"Go to Evan, now?" Ty asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s smile faded and Tach took her by the arm. He sensed something was
wrong, but the captain hadn’t told him anything about Seven or B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" Nara moved over and tried to take Ty. "What is it?" </P>
<P>Ty squirmed and gripped his legs around B’Elanna’s chest. "No," he told his
mother. "Stay with my Ba. Go find my Evan."</P>
<P>"Hey, little guy," B’Elanna whispered. "Seven isn’t feeling very good right
now…but I think you are just the medicine she needs." </P>
<P>Ty crinkled his nose and lips at the mention of medicine. He knew that word
from his bout with a nasty bug on Jusari Prime. He had been forced to sip bitter
herbs every morning for over three weeks, and he hadn’t forgotten it.</P>
<P>"What happen?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>"It’s a long story," B’Elanna said as she moved to the table and leaned
against it. She rubbed Ty’s back as she spoke. "Let me tell you about it."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Janeway said, "I’ll leave you and your friends to catch up." She
turned to Nara, who seemed to be in charge. "If you’d like, we can get you
quarters on board while we help repair your ship."</P>
<P>"That would be extremely generous," Nara said.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Tach said.</P>
<P>"Believe me," Janeway said. "After everything you helped Seven and B’Elanna
with, it’s nothing." Kathryn smiled at Ty who was resting his head on B’Elanna’s
shoulder and was playing with her comm badge. The child was completely content
and looked like he wouldn’t leave her arms without a major battle. One glance at
Nara and Kathryn realized that the child probably came by his stubbornness
genetically.</P>
<P>Nara nodded. "I thank you for your kindness. We consider Seven and Lana to be
gifts from the great goddess. We would welcome the chance to be with them."</P>
<P>"Evan?" Ty whipped his head around, then looked at B’Elanna expectantly. His
tiny lip quivered. "Ba? Where my Evan?"</P>
<P>"Let’s go see your Seven, okay?" B’Elanna offered. She knew that lip quiver
all to well. It generally proceeded a freeflowing torrent of tears.</P>
<P>"Evan!" he squealed happily and began bouncing on B’Elanna’s hip.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"So, you see," Neelix explained to Seven who was trying her best to seem
interested, "the best way to prepare leela root is to let it simmer until the
skin falls off."</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said slowly. "And have you considered using spices other than
the… hot Talaxian peppers? Perhaps…something that does not stimulate the human
tear duct?"</P>
<P>"Well… I… I never realized that the spices were too intense," he said
honestly.</P>
<P>"They are… perhaps too flavorful for many on board," she said delicately.</P>
<P>"No wonder I always have so many leftovers," he mumbled.</P>
<P>The sickbay doors opened and B’Elanna walked halfway into the room. "Up for
visitors?"</P>
<P>"I am always up for you, Be’nal," Seven said with a smile.</P>
<P>Before B’Elanna could comment, someone else announced his presence from
around the corner.</P>
<P>"Evan! Evan! My Evan," Ty yelled as soon as he heard Seven’s voice.</P>
<P>"Ty?" Seven’s eyes widened and seemed to brighten instantly.</P>
<P>"Bring him in," B’Elanna said, shaking her head.</P>
<P>"Here I was worried about you and you’re off taking a nap," Nara said as she
came around the corner trying to keep Ty still. He was climbing up her body and
arching his back, trying to get loose so that he could find his precious
<I>Evan</I>.</P>
<P>"Nara, I have missed you." Seven sat up but Neelix was there to stop her from
standing. She saw Tach come in behind his wife and she sighed. "Tach, my wife
missed you terribly. I was not as efficient a hunter as you were."</P>
<P>He looked at her belly as he and Nara moved over to her. "Looks like you gave
B’Elanna something I never could have. Not without Nara leaving me out as bear
bait," he added with a coy smirk. He cringed before Nara’s hand struck him in
the chest, having known the blow was coming before he finished the off-color
comment.</P>
<P>Nara rolled her eyes and moved next to the biobed so that Ty could see his
<I>Evan</I>. "Are you okay?" Nara whispered as she leaned down to kiss Seven’s
forehead. Neelix backed up out of the way, simply watching the interaction.</P>
<P>"Better now," Seven said honestly.</P>
<P>"Go to Evan. Evan no leave. Evan bad." Ty reached out and grabbed Seven’s
long hair, refusing to let go when his mother tried to stand.</P>
<P>Seven took him from his mother. Nara was cautious, locking eyes with the
exdrone to make sure she was up to holding the wiggling bundle. </P>
<P>"Come here," Seven said as she lifted Ty to her chest. He sighed happily and
settled his weight onto her and played with her hair with one hand as he
yawned.</P>
<P>"He missed you," Nara said quietly. "We missed you…especially at bedtime. He
wouldn’t go to sleep without your singing."</P>
<P>"And my Nara is many things, but a singer is not one of them," Tach
volunteered.</P>
<P>"Believe me, I remember," Seven said. She cringed and continued rubbing Ty’s
back as he dozed off.</P>
<P>"I think I am insulted," Nara said indignantly.</P>
<P>"Feel free to be insulted…just don’t sing." B’Elanna laughed as she moved
next to Seven and began stroking Ty’s back. Her hand brushed against Seven’s,
causing both women to smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After a brief visit, the Doctor materialized and insisted that the visitors
leave. Neelix took Tach and Nara on a tour of the ship while Ty stayed in
sickbay, unwilling to leave Seven’s arms even while he was asleep. His tiny
fists would tighten anytime Seven tried to move him away from her, so she
cradled him, humming contentedly to soothe him.</P>
<P>"I hardly think having a child in sickbay is appropriate," the Doctor said as
he shooed Neelix and Nara out the doors. He turned to see Seven smiling down at
Ty. She kissed his forehead and hugged him to her chest and then her expression
lost all its warmth.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you should terminate him," Seven said coldly. "Except on this
occasion I am capable of stopping you myself." She climbed out of the bed,
steadying herself on B’Elanna’s arm. "Killing children does seem to be your
answer to everything."</P>
<P>"Seven, I didn’t want to harm your child. I didn’t think I had any other
choice." His eyes wrinkled around the edges and sincere regret covered his
face.</P>
<P>"I am going home," Seven stated as she shifted Ty onto her hip. She squeezed
B’Elanna’s arm, and the Klingon nodded her support. Ty blinked and opened his
eyes, sensing that his beloved Evan was upset. He tightened his grip as he
stared at the strange man.</P>
<P>"Please, I know you’re upset with me, Seven," the Doctor pleaded. "But let me
help you."</P>
<P>"Is it safe for her to go back to our quarters?" B’Elanna asked. Her eyes
were cold, letting the hologram know that she hadn’t forgiven him either.</P>
<P>"Well, technically," he admitted. "But I would like to keep her here to
rest."</P>
<P>"What makes you think I could ever rest in your presence again?" Seven
asked.</P>
<P>Ty saw the anger in his beloved Evan’s eyes and turned toward the Doctor.
"Bad man."</P>
<P>"Well, out of the mouths if babes," the Doctor said with a sigh. "Fine, go
home. But… the moment you have any discomfort, I want you back here
immediately."</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow letting him know that she had no intention of
returning to sickbay voluntarily. Her expression softened when Ty’s hand traced
her lips.</P>
<P>"My Evan," he said possessively.</P>
<P>Seven smiled as kissed his tiny fingers.</P>
<P>"Let’s go home," B’Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"Home?" Ty asked excitedly. "Go back cabin, now?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna ruffled his dark, straight hair and then caressed his cheek. "No,
Ty. We can’t go back to the cabin."</P>
<P>"Ba stay?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Yes, Ba stay," B’Elanna promised. "Come on, Be’nal." She guided Seven toward
the door.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Neelix was showing his guests the mess hall, which was mostly deserted. Tuvok
was having a cup of Vulcan tea off to one corner and Tom was having coffee while
watching Harry Kim rummage through the large industrial refrigerator. Tom saw
the newcomers and came over to them. He smiled warmly, curious about them; any
new faces helped lessen the boredom.</P>
<P>"Hello," Tom said with a charming smile. "Who do we have here?"</P>
<P>"Tom, these are friends of B’Elanna and Seven’s. They helped them on the
planet." Neelix smiled and then turned to his charges. "Nara, Tach, this is Tom
Paris, our helmsman."</P>
<P>"Greetings," Nara said. </P>
<P>"You must be skilled to guide this vessel," Tach said.</P>
<P>"Well, I don’t like to brag, but it is challenging." Tom stood to his full
height and pushed out his chest.</P>
<P>The mess hall doors opened and Seven came in with B’Elanna. Ty was wide-eyed,
taking in all the new exotic scenery. Tom’s eyes narrowed and his face lost some
its charm. Nara noticed it immediately, as did Tach. Tach also noticed the
change in Tom’s scent. Ancient Narian males could distinguish mood changes in
other males by the scent of the distinctive hormones put they off, but it was a
skill mostly lost over the years. Strong emotional changes would still effect
Narians. The scent the helmsman was putting off was a mixture aggression and
desire. </P>
<P>"Over here." Nara smiled at her son who was deliriously happy with his two
‘aunts.’ "Seven, I thought you were supposed to be resting."</P>
<P>"I feel much better," Seven said. Her eyes stopped on Tom, who was doing his
best to look innocent. "We returned to our quarters and I changed my
attire."</P>
<P>"You look stunning, Seven," Neelix said. She was wearing dark charcoal slacks
and a lavender blouse. It was loose fitting so that her newly enlarged belly
wasn’t obvious and it was a perfect compliment to her ivory skin tone.</P>
<P>"Have you found them quarters yet?" B’Elanna asked Neelix. She had her arm
wrapped around Seven and let her hand drift hand to the exdrone’s hip as they
stopped in front of Neelix. "This little guy is ready for a nap," she added as
she rubbed Ty’s back. The boy was fighting to stay awake, and despite his
wide-open eyes, he was exhausted. He kept rubbing his eyes and cuddling against
Seven, both signs that he needed his nap.</P>
<P>"It is well past his nap hour." Nara moved to take him.</P>
<P>"Evan," Ty whispered as he clutched her neck. "Evan stay. No go away."</P>
<P>Neelix stepped closer and studied Ty. "Seems like he’s taken quite a shine to
you, Seven. I was going to put them in the VIP quarters on deck three, but if
you’d like, I could see if someone in the crew quarters would let them stay near
you."</P>
<P>"No, thank you," Tach said. He had been quiet, studying the helmsman to
figure out why he wreaked of anger and hostility. "We don’t want to take
anyone’s home. We’ll stay in the…what did you call it?…VIP quarters.</P>
<P>Tom shook his head and rolled his eyes. "Oh, I’ll bet that most of us would
love sleeping in the VIP quarters for a while. It gets pretty crowded in the
lower decks."</P>
<P>"Funny," Seven said as she pinned Tom in her gaze. "I find that I have plenty
of room, in fact, Lana and I sleep so close together that we could manage with a
bed half the size of ours." Seven turned to her wife. "Isn’t that right,
Be’nal?"</P>
<P>"Absolutely." B’Elanna barely stopped herself from laughing.</P>
<P>Tom’s eyes darkened. "Well, I guess that’s fine if you spend all of your time
together sleeping."</P>
<P>Nara burst out laughing, covering her mouth and struggling to breathe through
her nose. Her eyes watered, and after a several more heartfelt fits of laughter
she stood upright and shook her head at Tom.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris, if you think that, then this ship must have the best
soundproofing of any starship I’ve ever seen," Nara said. She giggled and looked
over at B’Elanna. "It’s a wonder we had any game in our valley. You make more
noise than any of those bears."</P>
<P>"Bears?" Ty’s attention fixed on B’Elanna. "Bear got Evan," he reminded her
gravely.</P>
<P>"Yes, it did," B’Elanna said. "Then what happened?" She didn’t see Tom’s neck
turning bright red as anger and jealousy raged.</P>
<P>"Ba killed it," Ty proclaimed proudly.</P>
<P>Neelix’s eyes widened. "Really?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven confirmed. "The beast mauled me and B’Elanna… lost her temper."
She glared at Tom. "It is exceedingly unwise to anger a skilled warrior such as
my wife."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, you fought a bear? That’s incredible," Neelix said. He was smiling
at her with wonder in his eyes. "How did you kill it?"</P>
<P>Ty helped B’Elanna tell the story. "Bear was napping!" He squealed and began
giggling. His eyes sparkled just like Nara’s had when she was giggling.</P>
<P>Tom snorted and looked over at B’Elanna. "Doesn’t sound like a very Klingon
thing to do. In fact, not many warriors nap on the battlefield."</P>
<P>Seven handed Ty to a surprised Nara. She moved to Tom in a few swift steps
and faced him, leaning down until her noise was almost touching his. "Warriors
may not sleep…but Ensigns do."</P>
<P>The small group was suddenly quiet, and Ty decided it was time to explore. He
wiggled and Nara let him down onto the floor. He crawled around seeing what he
could get into.</P>
<P>Seven backed away from Tom who was momentarily speechless.</P>
<P>"Umm, well, yes," Neelix said. "Why don’t I go check on some lunch for the
baby?"</P>
<P>"No peas," Nara and Tach said in unison. Neelix nodded and escaped the tense
group.</P>
<P>Tom regained his misplaced bravery. "So, Seven, are you saying that B’Elanna
would have to defend you from an ensign? Any particular ensign in mind? ‘Cause
I’ll bet there’s at least one ensign she’d like to surprise late at night in his
bed." Tom was too stupid to quit while he was ahead. </P>
<P>"On the contrary," Seven hissed as she quickly moved back into Tom’s face.
"As any of the Dengari can tell you... I am the more dangerous spouse in our
marriage."</P>
<P>"You’ve got that right," Nara added.</P>
<P>Tach was getting agitated, and he edged closer, but before he could act, his
son did.</P>
<P>"Bad Man!" Ty yelled. He grabbed Tom’s leg and buried his teeth into the
fleshy part of his calf. Ty was young, but his instinctual sense of smell told
him that the nasty man wanted to hurt his Evan.</P>
<P>"Ouch! You little monkey!" Tom yelled as he jumped back. "Get that cavebaby
away from me."</P>
<P>"Enough." Seven had her hand around Tom’s neck before the words had finished
leaving his lips. "You will not call him that… You will not insult me, and you
will NOT disparage my wife…ever again." Seven drove Tom back against a nearby
bulkhead, but her grip was not yet cutting off his air supply. "And if you ever
suggest that my wife is interested in you, I will make sure you never speak
again."</P>
<P>The few people in the mess hall had turned to watch the display. No one came
to Tom’s rescue. Even Harry felt that he had it coming to him.</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Tom squeaked. "Can’t you take a joke?" He
thought his ‘boyish charm’ would eventually get him out of his predicament.</P>
<P>Seven lifted him off of the ground, leaving his feet to dangle helplessly.
She ignored the twinge in her belly as she tightened her grip. "We know about
the Vulcan Balm," Seven said slowly. Her eyes were flickering with dangerous
energy and Tom realized that he had poked a very dangerous beast with a stick
one too many times. This beast was about to strike back. He scanned the room
looking for assistance. His eyes stopped on Tuvok, who was next to the door.
</P>
<P>Tuvok raised an eyebrow, and nodded, then he turned without a word and left
the mess hall.</P>
