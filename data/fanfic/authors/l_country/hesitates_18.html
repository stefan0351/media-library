<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Eighteen: Adjustments -->

<P>Janeway went directly to her quarters and used a hypospray the Doctor had
given her for the headaches she had been suffering from since the Dengari
situation began. After a quick look in the mirror to make sure that her command
mask was in place, she made her way to the bridge. She wanted to get the ship
underway before the mysterious Magistrate arrived. She had used up every ounce
of patience with the Dengari Overseer and had no interest in meeting the
Magistrate and wanted to get back on course to the Alpha quadrant. Kathryn hoped
the familiar routine of the bridge would take her mind off of Seven. </P>
<P>Part of her was truly happy that Seven seemed to have found someone she could
love, someone who obviously loved her in return, but a smaller part felt like
she had been shown a cruel glimpse of the happiness she could have shared with
the exBorg. Both thoughts only made the weight of her loneliness press down on
her like it hadn’t since she had found out that her fiancee Mark had moved on
and married someone else back in the Alpha Quadrant. </P>
<P>"Mister Paris," Janeway said as she walked onto the bridge, "Take us out of
here as soon as we get clearance to disengage the airlock."</P>
<P>"Aye, Ma’am," he said slowly. It wasn’t normal for her to start spouting
orders before even greeting whomever had the bridge.</P>
<P>"Captain," Chakotay said as she walked down to the command deck. "Everything
all right?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Commander. B’Elanna and Seven are safely on board." Janeway paused as
the tattooed officer climbed out of her chair and into his own, and then she sat
without another word.</P>
<P>Chakotay turned back toward Ensign Kim at Ops. "Harry, any word from the
station?"</P>
<P>"Yes, sir. They’re still finishing up some last minute things before they can
disengage the airlock." Harry studied his comm panel intently but was more than
a little curious about B’Elanna and Seven.</P>
<P>"How did B’Elanna look?" Tom Paris asked as he turned.</P>
<P>"Fine," Janeway answered, not elaborating.</P>
<P>"Did she ask about me?" he asked.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said, hoping Tom would get the hint that she didn’t want to
talk about it.</P>
<P>"She was probably pretty preoccupied, right?" Tom persisted.</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said. <I>‘Sometimes,’ </I>she thought, ‘<I>he can be so
dense</I>.’</P>
<P>"Probably just wanted to climb into a warm bed, huh?" he asked, unaware of
how that particular question would affect the captain.</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said. Her voice was at its most deadly register reserved for
the Kazon or Hirogen.</P>
<P>"She didn’t mention me at all?" he asked again. His face showed his
disbelief, as if the captain had simply not been paying attention to B’Elanna,
because certainly she would have asked about him.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway said. She wondered if anyone would object to her asking Tuvok
to test his Vulcan nerve pinch on the helmsman. Probably not.</P>
<P>The doors to the turbolift opened and the Doctor came into the room.
"Captain, I just finished checking Lieutenant Torres and Seven. If you have a
moment, I think I should brief you on my findings."</P>
<P>"Fine. In my ready room." Janeway wasn’t in the mood to talk about either of
the women, but she had a ship to run, so she pushed herself out of her
chair.</P>
<P>"Doc?" Tom asked. "Think Lana is up to a little visit?" His eyes suggested
his question was more about a date than a visit. "I mean, after two and half
years, she has to have forgiven me, right?"</P>
<P>Janeway sighed and looked at the helmsman. "Mister Paris," Janeway said
ruefully, "I think that ship has sailed."</P>
<P>The Doctor snorted a half laugh. "That ship has not only sailed, but it’s
coming back to port with a copilot and full cargo hold."</P>
<P>Janeway cleared her throat and nodded toward her ready room while Tom gave
them both a confused stare.</P>
<P>"Chakotay, you have the bridge. Take us out of here as soon as we’re clear."
Janeway led the way off of the bridge. She still had a lingering sense of dread
about the Magistrate and wanted to be long gone before he arrived.</P>
<P>The Doctor followed Janeway into her ready room and studied the various items
decorating her office as she sat at her desk. He wondered if he should add a
bust of one of his medical heroes or perhaps a famous opera star to his own
office.</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Janeway nodded to the chair across from her.</P>
<P>"Captain," he said as he sat. "I just wanted you to know that my concerns
about the child were unfounded. There is no risk of it, or rather her, being
Borg."</P>
<P>"Glad to hear it," she said. That was one less hardship for Seven and
B’Elanna to endure she thought happily.</P>
<P>"And, despite what I first thought, I don’t think either Lieutenant Torres or
Seven will need counseling for post traumatic stress disorder or the effects of
internment." He smiled proudly as if it was by some miracle of his own
doing.</P>
<P>Janeway’s only response was a set of raised auburn eyebrows.</P>
<P>"It seems they were not even with the other inmates. They were alone in a
mountain region," he explained. "So, while we were all worrying ourselves sick
about their well being, they were off having a romantic vacation," he added, his
voice dripping with sarcasm. "We should all be so lucky."</P>
<P>"I’m sure upsetting you wasn’t their only goal, Doctor. I’m guessing they had
a tough time of it." She sighed, relived that her crewmembers hadn’t been forced
to deal with the horrors that had filled her own thoughts since they had went
missing. </P>
<P>"Yes, well…" he said as he tugged at his holographic collar. He had the good
sense to look contrite before continuing. "I’d like them to take off at least a
few weeks to relax and get back into the swing of things, as it were."</P>
<P>"You’re giving them time off after a two and half year vacation?" Janeway
wasn’t through dressing the hologram down just yet. "How generous of you." Her
eyes lacked the sparkle they had when she was teasing.</P>
<P>"Point taken, captain." He knew when he was beaten, and had the intelligence
to quit while he was ahead. "While they may have had less harsh conditions than
we had speculated, they did have to struggle."</P>
<P>"I’ll make a note in my log," she said. "Doctor, you said they weren’t with
the other inmates?"</P>
<P>"Yes." He nodded. "They were completely isolated for most of the time."</P>
<P>"Well, then how did Seven… how… her, well if not one of the convicts, how did
she get…" Janeway struggled, not comfortable with the topic, but still having an
overwhelming curiosity about the subject.</P>
<P>"Pregnant?" the Doctor supplied. "We have Lieutenant Torres to thank for
that," he said with a smirk. "Well, Lieutenant Torres and good old Borg
ingenuity."</P>
<P>Janeway stared at him, her mouth refusing to function.</P>
<P>"In six months," he said with a smile, "We’re going to have a little
Klingon-human-Borg tyke running around. Well, I guess that isn’t entirely
accurate. She’ll be one quarter Klingon and three quarters Human."</P>
<P>"I see," Janeway said, but in truth she had no idea how B’Elanna and Seven
had managed that particular feat, and the last thing she wanted to do was try to
think about it. That invited images she didn’t want, images of the two women in
a heated embrace. No, she didn’t want to think about that at all.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven made their way down to the crew deck after finishing up in
sick bay. They passed several crew members who were warm and welcoming, though
somewhat surprised to see the two women together, that and the fact that both
women looked significantly different than they had the last time they had been
on board. Seven’s rich brown leather pants and blood stained white top weren’t
nearly a surprising as the thick braid that came down over her left shoulder
reaching her belly. B’Elanna was an even more bizarre site. She was wearing her
dark brown leather pants and a loose fitting surgical gown. Her hair had also
grown out, and she wore it pulled back into a loose ponytail tied off at the
shoulder with a piece of leather. Her sable brown hair reached down passed her
shoulder blades.</P>
<P>They reached B’Elanna’s quarters and were thrilled to find a package waiting
next to the door. It was from Malok, and contained not only the bearskin and
B’Elanna’s knife but her jacket as well. Seven had left the leather garment in
their cell during her haste to accompany B’Elanna to the surgical bay.</P>
<P>"Welcome home," B’Elanna said as she walked into her quarters.</P>
<P>"Thank you." Seven took the package from B’Elanna and put it onto the low
table and then turned to the Klingon with a feral grin. "Show me our bed," the
exdrone demanded and her eyes lidded as she leaned in for a kiss.</P>
<P>"I thought you needed a nap?" B’Elanna’s asked after a lingering kiss.</P>
<P>"I need you more," Seven said. She wrapped B’Elanna in her arms and rested
her forehead against her wife’s ridged brow. "You scared me today. I now
understand the promise you wanted me to make after our vision quest." She ran
her fingers down B’Elanna’s cheek and then followed the same path with whisper
soft kisses.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry," B’Elanna whispered. She groaned and leaned into Seven’s body,
her mocha colored hands kneading the muscles in Seven’s lower back. "Your back’s
like a rock. It must be killing you." B’Elanna untangled from the embrace and
led Seven to their bed, pausing only long enough to bring the bearskin.</P>
<P>"Don’t ever leave me, Be’nal," Seven whispered as B’Elanna lifted the blood
stained shirt over her head. Her blonde braid got tangled, then slapped down
onto her chest and B’Elanna tugged on her braid with a smile, using it to pull
Seven into searing kiss.</P>
<P>"I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere." B’Elanna eased Seven onto the bed,
face down, and straddled her leather covered backside. She tenderly massaged
Seven’s lean, long back, giving each muscle loving, soothing attention until
every bit of tightness was gone, then settled herself next to Seven.</P>
<P>"Make love to me," the fully relaxed and aroused blonde begged.</P>
<P>"Always," B’Elanna breathed into a kiss on Seven’s full lips. "Always, my
beloved. Now, roll over." Her brown eyes darkened to the color of night at she
leaned over to steal another kiss, and they made love under the same bearskin
that had warmed them every night since the first time they had opened their
souls to each other. It was just as wonderful, magical, and fresh as that first
time. Each meeting of lips was a benediction, a promise of forever. Each touch
of velvet soft skin against well muscled limbs ignited fires so fierce that they
consumed the pair until they lay spent and their breathing was reduced to
labored gasps. All in all, it was a perfect homecoming.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Several decks away Kathryn Janeway was awake in her bed, but for a much
different reason. After staring at the ceiling for an hour she got up and went
for a walk. She wandered aimlessly through the various decks until she found
herself at a familiar location. She stared at the doors to Cargo Bay two and
felt like her soul was being ripped from her body. She had to stop herself from
activating the door, then almost laughed at the absurdity of the action. Seven
was probably with B’Elanna, in her…no, their quarters, and even if Seven was in
the Borg alcove regenerating, B’Elanna was probably there with her. Even if the
Klingon wasn’t there, watching another woman’s wife sleep was completely
inappropriate. </P>
<P>Kathryn walked back to the turbolift and began going over her past actions.
She had watched Seven regenerate, sleep, on countless occasions, and had never
admitted the intimacy it implied. Watching Seven sleep had been the most
intimate act Kathryn had indulged in since she had left the Alpha Quadrant. Now
the beautiful blonde Borg was sleeping next to B’Elanna Torres. Kathryn pushed
that image out of her mind and headed back to her quarters alone.</P>
