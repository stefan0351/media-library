<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 2 -->

<p>Buffy looked at Faith again and gently touched her hair. She felt the tears start to well up and abruptly turned away from the other slayer lying on the hospital bed, hanging onto life by a thread.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Faith..." Buffy said to the wall.</p>
<p>She looked back one more time, gave Faith a parting wave and walked out of the room. On her way she  nearly knockeed over a metal tray that held medical supplies all too much like the things Angelus had kept as toys for Buffy's liking.</p>
<p>As she stepped out the door of the room she looked down the now vacant corridors and shuddered at the memory of Der Kindestod.</p>
<p>'There must be somthing I can do for her...I'm the slayer...we're the slayers! Our deaths are not  supposed to be caused by eachother!' Buffy thought.</p>
<p>Buffy continued her trek down the hallway and quickened her step as soon as the doors were in view.</p>
<p>"I hate hospitals" she said aloud.</p>
<p>The blonde slayer walked over the hospital lawn and towards the sidewalk.</p>
<p>'Not much of a shortcut, but it'll do' she thought.</p>
<p>As soon as she was on the concrete path she started going, not in the direction of home and not in the direction of...well, she didn't know where she was going. She just knew she was going.</p>
<p>After passing many parks, and lots of houses everything started to thin out, more trees less civilization. A few more steps and she knew where she was going. It wasn't somewhere she wanted to be, but she knew she had to go.</p>
<p>Angel's former residence came into view. The mansion.</p>
<p>Buffy walked up to the door but opted to go around into the garden. She noticed that there was no 'for sale' sign on the front lawn. This caused her to wonder what Angel was doing, and what he had planned for the old place.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered Dru's garden memories flooded Buffy and once again she nearly fell apart.</p>
<p>In her mind's eye she saw herself fighting Angelus. She saw Spike and Dru lazing about. She saw Angel practicing Tai Chi.</p>
<p>But most of all she saw the shadows that would be there forever to her...even in broad daylight. All she could see was the darkness. And Angelus would forever be the king of it. He was here. Inside every crack in the wall, in every stone in the path, lurking in every shadow was pure evil. The evil that she once loved.</p>
<p>As she slowly entered the house she felt a surge of anger, anger at herself for all she had done. She was the cause of so much pain for her friends, and her family. The death of Ms. Calendar the physical tourture Giles had gone through, and the emotional pain he would forever endure. All the times her friends so dear to her had been attacked or injured at Angelus's hand. She might as well have done it all herself.</p>
<p>Was it not her job to slay the vampire? Was Angel not a vampire? Should she not have slain him the first chance she had? Perhaps not, he was good then. But she certianly shouldn't have gotten so close to him. It was her fault he became so evil.</p>
<p>She knew in her heart that she could not have killed him then. Or even now for that matter. With that thought she entered the hall, and she saw where she had risked her life to give Angel back his. She could still see small spots of blood on the floor, that she knew to be hers.</p>
<p>She couldn't stand there any longer and she continued on.</p>
<p>This spot was almost worse than the last. It was where she and Angel had made love. What was so right in her mind then seemed so wrong to her now. But how could she have forseen the outcome? She couldn't have. And it was right at the time.</p>
<p>She sat down reluctantly, but she knew she needed to think.</p>
<p>Buffy finally addmitted this to herself. Despite all that had happened as a result, if she could go back she wouldn't change anything.</p>
<p>Guilt flooded her at this realization. Jenny's life...Kendra's? Mabey she could overlook all else, but the human loss? The damage this had done to Giles she could see beyond, he seemed to be dealing. And Kendra's death had brought her Faith.</p>
<p>Again guilt flooded her when she awknowledged her willingness to trade one person for another.</p>
<p>Jenny's death however, was one thing she could never forgive herself for. Jenny had not only died at Angel's hand but she had died for trying to help her and regain her trust.</p>
<p>Buffy put these thoughts out of her mind. What had happened had happened and nothing could change the past, all she could do was learn from her mistakes and not make the same ones twice.</p>
<p>With newfound resolve Buffy got up and walked out of the mansion with pride, pride that had been gone since she stabbed Faith.</p>
<p>She didn't know it at the time, but as she walked out of Angel's place physically she also left emotionally. He did not own her anymore, she was not his girl and he was not her guy. She was moving on. Dealing. As he had dealt by leaving her, she was dealing by leaving him.</p>
<p>Life. That's what this was all about. Leaving the land of the dead or undead for that matter, and joining the land of the living.</p>
<p>If there was one thing Buffy was sure of, it was that Faith was going to join her on that trip. That was importiant to her. But why? Why did she feel so strongly about Faith?</p>
<p>Again Buffy started down the pavement. Kicking stones as she walked and counting cars that sped past.</p>
<p>She still hurt, but the pain was finally ebbing. It was going to be a long journy.</p>
<p>By the time Buffy got home it was almost dark and time for her to head to Giles' place. They had to use it to meet ever since they blew up the library.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------At Giles' House--------------------</p>
<p>Buffy knocked on the door several times fogetting totally about slayer strength and putting a huge dent in the wood.</p>
<p>Giles opened up and went into the kitchen to prepare some tea, Buffy went and sat down on the couch. Finding she could not sit still for very long she got up and started to look through his records. She put on the only one she even vaugly recognized and sat down again.</p>
<p>Finally Giles came into the room.</p>
<p>"Well Buffy, it seems with the ascension gone awry the demonic activity has subsided greatly. I would imagine that most demons and other creatures had planned to leave and allow the mayor to have his city to himself."  With that Giles removed his glasses and started to wipe them on his shirt.</p>
<p>"So this is a good thing I'm guessing" Buffy replied.</p>
<p>"Yes yes of course it's a good thing. I think you are going to have a relatively quiet summer."</p>
<p>"Fine, I need some time to deal with everything."</p>
<p>Giles again removed his glasses and this time rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>"Very well then, however umm...you will be keeping up patroling correct?"</p>
<p>"Yeah yeah, don't worry. Gotta keep this town demon free. And that is just what I am going to go do."  Buffy stood up and excused herself. Leaving Giles alone in his apartment.</p>
<p>Giles flopped down onto the couch and tossed his glasses onto the coffee table.</p>
<p>"Do be careful." he muttered to himself.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------Patrolling-------------------------</p>
<p>Buffy walked through the dark cemetary, not looking at any of the headstones. She still remembered what happened last night and she didn't want that to happen again. She had the erie feeling that someone was watching her.</p>
<p>Suddenly a vampire jumped up out of no where and charged her.</p>
<p>"Bad move."</p>
<p>With that she kicked him hard in the face and took advantage of her opportunity to punch him in the stomache. He fell to the ground and she came down hard with a stake. He rolled out of the way and sprung up to his feet. He delivered a shattering upercut and Buffy flew back into a tree dropping her stake. The vamp ran over to her and picked it up. He kicked Buffy in the chest and she felt the air rush out of her lungs. Again he hit her in the face, Buffy was losing badly. She slunk down to the ground curled up into a ball clutching her stomach. The vamp rose up above her with the stake and was about to bring it down on her. She shut her eyes. Nothing happened. No shooting pain nothing. When she opened her eyes she saw, she was covered in dust. Somehow, someone had dusted him.</p>
<p>Buffy said a silent thanks and continued on. She then staked 3 more vamps and decided to call it quits.</p>
<p>Buffy walked home. Again she thought about Faith.</p>
<p>'I miss her so much. My partner, my friend, the only one who could have possibly understood me...not to mention the way she look's after a fight...' Buffy looked up startled. 'I did not just think that.' She shook her head as if to get the thought out.</p>
<p>Buffy got home and went upstairs quietly so she would not wake her mother. Once she was in her room she shed Faith's jacket and tossed it onto the back of her chair. She went over to the cd player and put on KoRn. Faith's favorite.</p>
<p>The music was loud, so she had to quickly turn it down but Buffy loved it. It was so crazy it just cleared you head totally.</p>
<p>She fell asleep. A crash then woke her almost immediatly and she ran down the stairs to see what had gone bump in the night. As she entered her kitchen she was shocked by the site.</p>
