<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 3 -->

<p>There was Faith. And what was she doing? Nothing other than cooking.</p>
<p>"Faith? Wha...what are you doing here?" Buffy managed to get out.</p>
<p>"Hey, chill. Don't look so surprised B. I told you slaying always makes me hungry and horny and that i.v. stuff just sucks so here I am."</p>
<p>"Slaying? You were out slaying? But your in the hospital in a coma with a huge stab wound,"</p>
<p>Faith took off her ring and put it on the counter so she could mix what she was making a little more thoroughly.</p>
<p>"Hey hey, don't underestimate me. I was in a coma on graduation day...and you, you weren't looking so good yourself."</p>
<p>"Yeah but I woke up...you didn't. I must be dreaming."</p>
<p>"Aww...does that mean I'm the girl of your dreams B? How sweet."</p>
<p>"Whatever...you are still in the hospital arn't you...arn't you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah I guess the bod's in there still but I'm 5 by 5 over here."</p>
<p>Buffy goes over and sit's on the kitchen counter, realization dawns on her.</p>
<p>"You...in the cemetery. You saved me."</p>
<p>"Yeah B, I was there. Watchin' out for you. You arn't doing so good. I must say though, your taste in music and clothes has definatly improved."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"What can I say? I had the best model to check out all the styles on."</p>
<p>Buffy blushed at her remark, realizing that it was somewhat of a come on.</p>
<p>"Chill B. You don't need to get so embarrassed about everything."</p>
<p>With that Faith finished mixing whatever it was in the bowl and put it into a pan. She lowered it into the oven and walked over to the spoon that she had been using. Faith picked it up and started to lick it clean. Buffy was watching intently as she cleaned off every last bit of the batter.</p>
<p>Faith looked over at Buffy looking at her and smiled.</p>
<p>"See something you like B?"</p>
<p>"Yes...I mean no." Buffy was clearly flustered.</p>
<p>Faith started to walk towards Buffy seductively. Buffy felt herself tremble as Faith ran her hand up Buffy's arm. Faith leaned into kiss her and Buffy moved towards her when suddenly Faith pulled away.</p>
<p>"You did it B...You killed me" Faith said as her face clouded with pain and she fell back.</p>
<p>Just as she would have hit the ground the setting changed and again Buffy was on the roof with Faith, holding the bloody knife. Faith threw herself off the roof.</p>
<p>At that moment Buffy awoke in a cold sweat and started to cry.</p>
<p>Joyce heard the sounds of her daughter crying and went into her room. She sat down on the bed next to Buffy and took her into a warm embrace.</p>
<p>   "It's ok Buffy, it was just a dream. I'm here for you it's ok." Her mother made soothing noises and stroked her hair gently.</p>
<p>"M-mom it was terrible."</p>
<p>"I know, but it's over now. Whatever it was, it's gone. And I'm here."</p>
<p>"N-no mom that's just it. It's not over. It never will be over. She's going to die."</p>
<p>"Nobody is going to die it's ok just calm down."</p>
<p>Buffy started to relax as her mom talked to her, just as she had when she was a child. Buffy felt herself being drawn into sleep again.</p>
<p align="center">--------------------Next morning----------------------</p>
<p>Buffy got up out of her bed and slipped some jeans on and a tank top. Soon memories of last nights dream? flooded her.</p>
<p>She quickly descened the steps so that she could check out the kitchen.</p>
<p>It was perfectly clean. Not one thing was out of place. Had it all been a dream?? She looked over to where Faith had been standing. There was no signs of anyone cooking and there was no signs of anyone being stabbed.</p>
<p>Buffy went and got herself a glass, as she went over to the sink to run the tap she saw it. Faith's ring. Right where she had left it.</p>
<p>'Was it a dream?' was all Buffy could think.</p>
<p>And she knew it was time to go and see Faith again.</p>
<p>Buffy went to the fruit bowl and grabbed a bananna that she gulped down in 3 bites. She didn't have time for anything other than getting to the hospital. Her mom was at work so she didn't have to worry about being quizzed on the events of the previous night. For that she was glad.</p>
<p>Buffy walked out the front door and headed down the walk towards the Sunndale Hospital.</p>
<p>She moved briskly through and was soon at her destination. Once again most of her courage left her as she walked up the huge steps and into the hospital.</p>
<p>The walls were so pale, 'why don't they paint them? Mabey the patients would feel better then' she thought to herself.</p>
<p>The door to Faith's room was right in front of her. She opened it softly and walked into the room. She tip toed over to Faith's bed and pulled up a chair.</p>
<p>"You are so pale...you need to get out of here. You need to slay again. Remember how much you loved slaying?" Buffy wispered to her.</p>
<p>"When you...y'know, worked for the mayor...did you still slay at all? Or was it just stuff for the mayor? I guess he never wanted you to kill the vamps...they did work for him. Sorry, I guess this is a bad topic."</p>
<p>Buffy started to cry quietly and a tear dripped onto Faith's cheek. When Buffy looked down she saw the tear and gently wiped it away.</p>
<p>"Sorry" she said quietly.</p>
<p>Buffy sniffled and shifted in her seat.</p>
<p>"Here...this is yours" With that she slipped the ring from last night back onto Faith's finger and held her hand. She sat there looking down at the other slayer, so sick and pale. It was all her fault.</p>
<p>Buffy looked out Faith's window and watched some cars go by.</p>
<p>"There they go, so blissfully unaware. I made so many sacrifices for them. WE made so many sacrifices. At the prom...when they gave me the umbrella, I realized that I couldn't have done what I did without you. There were so many times that you were there to help me out of a pinch. I could have been finished so many times...but you always came through. Just like last night, I don't know how but you did."</p>
<p>Again Buffy started to sob silently.</p>
<p>"I'm so so sorry." She choked out. But managed to continue...</p>
<p>"You mean so much to me...more than you could ever know. More than I even know. Don't die on me. I need to hear your laugh one more time. I need to hear your slant on things, life, relationships...everything. I need you in my life. Don't go away from me."</p>
<p>After saying that, Buffy had to leave, she couldn't bear another moment in that room.</p>
<p>As she got up to go, Buffy felt something so slight anyone but a slayer may have missed it. She wasn't sure but she thought Faith squeezed her hand and let it go.</p>
<p>"I'm SO sorry." Buffy couldn't bear to look down now.</p>
<p>If she had, she would have seen that tears were now forming at the corners of Faith's eyes as well. Had she heard what Buffy had said?</p>
<p>Buffy walked out of the room, her inner turmoil causing her so much pain. It hurt to think, it hurt to walk, it hurt to breath. Everything hurt.</p>
