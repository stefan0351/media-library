<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 1 -->

<p>Buffy Summers was sitting quietly in the shade of a huge tree in a big grassy park. The birds were singing and the sun was shining as always, only Buffy was not shining with it.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with me? God knows I should be happy, I mean we won! We all survived the ascension, except for Snyder but wasn't that a bonus anyways? Will is staying in town, so are Xander and Oz...Giles will stick around untill I go and we graduated! We did it...Why can't I just be happy?"  Buffy asked herself quietly.</p>
<p>But deep down she knew. For all that they had achieved and won, she had lost greatly as well. Angel was gone. Her first love. He had left her and not even had the guts to say goodbye. Cryptic and brooding till the end. She loved him, or she had at one point. After all they had been through...and he decides to leave her based on somthing the Mayor had said? He was insane was he not?</p>
<p>Somthing else had happened when Angel had walked away from her and out of her life. As he left, she realized that what they once had together was gone. As it had been for weeks before the actual ascension, or even their breakup before the prom. They were growing apart. Even though they had somthing different and special...it was gone. It faded away slowly and the last remnants left with him.</p>
<p>The circumstances of their relationship had been different of course. He was a Vampire, she The Slayer and things only got far more complicated from then on. He was old...really really old. He had seen it all and he knew what went bump in the night...most of the time it was him. As she found out when they finally consumated the relationship.</p>
<p>'That brings me to Angelus' She thought. 'The demon with the face of my Angel. So much changed then, far too much.'</p>
<p>That was all Buffy could bear and she started to sob quietly. She then heard a noise and raised her head readying herself for battle out of habit, not even realizing it was broad daylight.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Are you ok?" It was Willow. Buffy relaxed.</p>
<p>"Yeah Will...sorry about the dissapearing act I just needed some time alone. You know, to think about things."</p>
<p>"Of course I totally understand I just wanted to tell you that Oz and I are going out of town because Oz's band has a gig in LA and he invited me to go with him but I wanted to tell you cause I didn't want to..."</p>
<p>Buffy smilled at the Willow babble. Somthing familiar and comforting in times of change. It was time to interupt her though.</p>
<p>"It's ok Will, you don't have to babysit me I can take care of myself. I am a totally self-sufficent youngish adult. I don't need a Julie Andrews."</p>
<p>She gave her friend a warm smile and stood up.</p>
<p>"Go, have a good time and I will see you when you get back."</p>
<p>"Ok, but Buffy...don't do anything...rash?"</p>
<p>Buffy cringed at the refrence to last summers activities.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'll be here with bells on waiting for you when you get back."</p>
<p>With that Buffy hugged Willow and they walked off towards her house.</p>
<p align="center">---------------------That night-----------------------</p>
<p>Buffy was lying awake in her bed. She couldn't sleep, inner conflict was gnawing away at her. Soon her thoughts wandered back to the events of graduation...and Faith.</p>
<p>Faith. There was one subject that was very hard for Buffy to deal with. Ever since her turn to the dark-side Buffy had blamed herself for the loss.</p>
<p>'If only I had been a better friend. If only I had included her more. If only I had made her feel more at home with the group...If only I hadn't let her kill that guy. Why was he even in that ally anyways? What was wrong with him, working for the mayor. He must have deserved it.'</p>
<p>Buffy thought back to the dream.</p>
<p>'She helped me. She saved the day for us. She probably saved all of our lives. Oh God she doesn't deserve to die...at my hands. My hands will forever bear her blood.'</p>
<p>Again Buffy started to sob. What could she do? She had killed the only one who understood her and who knew exactly what she was going through. The one who could practicly read her mind.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't know what had caused her to stab Faith and attack her the way she had.</p>
<p>'Was it really Angel? I could have just knocked her out and dragged her back...I could have used were-Oz's tranq gun...there were so many other options if Angel was the only reason I went to her.'</p>
<p>No, it wasn't Angel. It was somthing else. When Buffy thought of Faith somthing inside her changed...it was almost like when she had first met Angel. Only, it was so much more. Her feelings for Faith ran deeper than she even cared to know.</p>
<p>Yet, none of this explained why she did what she did. Her heart knew why she did it and it screamed out to tell her. Yet her brain didn't want to receive the messages. She didn't want to register the facts that she knew were true.</p>
<p>As her heart screamed out to her she tried to drown it out with violence. Buffy headed off to the cemetary. Clad in cargo's a white tank top and Faith's infamous leather jacket.</p>
<p>The jacket. It was her comfort thing now. She wore it almost all the time, she even fell asleep in it a few times. She had it so much it started to worry Giles and the rest of the Slayerettes who were still around. It had been a month and the gang had not once seen her without it, even in the California summer heat.</p>
<p>As she approached the cemetary her slayer instincts started to kick in and relief washed over her as she started to forget what was bothering her.</p>
<p>She opened the gate and went in.</p>
<p>Almost immediatly a fresh vampire jumped out at her from behind a tree.</p>
<p>Buffy easily blocked it's clumsy attack and countered with a cresent kick that sent him flying into a headstone. The dazed vamp was no match for her and she kicked him again, this time in the face. He was now lying on a freshly dug grave.</p>
<p>"Bad bad vampire. You don't show any respect for the dead. Buffy will teach you a lesson."</p>
<p>Once again she kicked him. He was now clutching his side in pain. Buffy stradled the vamp who was flat on his back and started to beat on his face, much like Faith had done on so many occasions. Buffy felt herself losing control and she just didn't care. If you could beat a vamp to death he would easily have died several times already, but Buffy wasn't letting up. She finally reagain a little control and staked him before she could lose it again.</p>
<p>Buffy looked over at the headstone.</p>
<p>"Sorry about that...Faith?" Buffy went white and ran out of the cemetary crying.</p>
<p>If she was a little more stable at the time, and if she had read the stone clearly she would have seen that it was that of an elderly lady who had passed in her sleep and not the Faith who had been keeping her up at night.</p>
<p>As soon as she got home Buffy called the hospital.</p>
<p>"Hello...Is Faith umm...Faith Wilkins still in your care?" She asked franticly.</p>
<p>The nurse on the other end asked her to calm down and informed her that Faith was still there and had not changed since she was brought in a month ago. Buffy politly apologized and hung up the phone. She headed upstairs hoping that she may get some sleep before she went to see Faith first thing in the morning tommorow.</p>
<p align="center">---------------------Next Morning---------------------</p>
<p>Buffy slowly walked down the corridor towards Faith's room. The mayor had prepaid for her room so she would have a private on with individual care as long as she needed, even though he was no longer around.</p>
<p>Her courage had left her and she was now incredibly nervous. Her steps came to a halt as she reached the door to Faith's room and opened it slowly.</p>
<p>Buffy saw no flowers at her bedside and no balloons around her. There was a window though, so sunlight streamed in and over her pale face, her hair was dull and her eyes closed. Still.</p>
<p>She noticed the scars, and how well they had been healing, the doctors were still in shock about it. Buffy smiled to herself, thinking about how strong Faith was.</p>
<p>'She'll pull through. I know she will.' Buffy told herself repeatedly.</p>
<p>Buffy needed so desperatly to belive this. It was all that kept her from falling apart.</p>
<p>At that moment the doctor came in to change the dressing on Faith's wound. Though her scars were healing easily, somthing was wrong with the stab wound. It wasn't going away properly.</p>
<p>As the doctor removed the bloody bandage Buffy winced and grabbed her own side at the site of the stab wound.</p>
<p>"She just won't heal up. It won't stop bleeding." The doctor told her.</p>
<p>"And yet she's not losing any blood. It's like...well some kind of trick. It's the same with tears. You can cry forever and yet you won't run out." With that the doctor finished up and left.</p>
<p>Buffy was now crying sobbing. She had caused Faith all of this, and it may never stop? She looked at the doctor before he left. His nametag read Doctor Hope.</p>
