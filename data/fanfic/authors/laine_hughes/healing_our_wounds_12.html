<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Epilogue -->

<p>Joyce got home a few days later, and was overjoyed to see Faith alive and kicking. She had always liked that girl.</p>
<p>Faith secretly took Buffy to rehab, helping her deal with everything. Slowly and lovingly.</p>
<p>Joyce never found out about Buffy's 'adventure' not to anyones surprise.</p>
<p>Buffy made up with the gang, and Faith was readily welcomed back. Their relationship took a little getting used to, but almost everyone soon came around.</p>
<p>Everyone but Xander. He was the only one who acted weird around Faith, but that was to be expected.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't blame him. If she had lost her shot with Faith?? Who wouldn't go a little crazy?</p>
<p>As the day's went by, Faith and Buffy grew closer and closer. Their love was blossoming.</p>
<p>Buffy told Faith about her dad, and her childhood, every last detail about Angel. Angel stories amused Faith to no end, the poor guy. Little did he now just how critically he was being evaluated.</p>
<p>Faith was slower to talk. Her pain went alot deeper than Buffy's, and was alot harder for her to deal with.</p>
<p>Faith's inner demons rivaled those that they fought on each dark Sunnydale night.</p>
<p>It was with Buffy's love and support that she eventually found the courage to speak about her dad's abuse. About her mom's drugs problems, that eventually killed her. About her own failures. And finally, the tragedy of her watcher.</p>
<p>Soon Buffy knew it all. Faith had let her in.</p>
<p>The pair were deeply in love. And though they passionatly made love to eachother many times, and though they continued to grow closer, neither forgot that first kiss.</p>
<p>It was then, inside of her mothers jeep, after Faith had almost killed a man to save her, that Buffy realized what Faith had known for a long time.</p>
<p>She truly loved her, with all of her heart and all of her soul.</p>
<p>This true love was what had saved her life.</p>
<p>Together they had found a way to heal each others wounds.</p>
