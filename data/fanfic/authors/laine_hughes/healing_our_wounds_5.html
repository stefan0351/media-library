<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 5 -->

<p>Buffy ran up the stairs as soon as she was done eating, much to her mothers dismay. Joyce was now becoming quite worried about her daughter.</p>
<p>'Teenagers.' She thought. And smiled to herself.</p>
<p>Buffy went into her room and again locked the door behind her. She went over to her cd rack and picked out some Everclear. Yet another one of Faith's cds. She put it in and walked over to her bed as the music began. The first song started with a little beach boyesque ditty.</p>
<p>'On to more important things' she thought.</p>
<p>Buffy pulled the journal out from under her pillow and looked at it. The quality was very high, it was leather bound,</p>
<p>'so typical' Buffy thought, and giggled to herself at the inside joke.</p>
<p>And the front had "Faith" emblanized in gold on it. Buffy turned it over in her hands, she could smell Faith's scent on the book. Slightly musky, but sweet and ever so feminine.</p>
<p>She slowly opened it.</p>
<p>Inside the front cover was a message:</p>
<p><i>To Faith:<br> I may not always be there for you, but remember I care about you. Use this for your deepest thoughts, and keep these pages sacred. I can always see what's in them. I reside within.</i></p>
<p><i>Sincerely, your Watcher Emme.</i></p>
<p>As soon as she had read it Buffy knew exactly how much pain Faith had endured when her watcher had died. They had been close. She was like the mother Faith never had, to lose her and to have to watch would have been devastating.</p>
<p>Buffy started to hurt inside at the idea of Faith in so much pain. She wanted to take it all away from her.</p>
<p>'Another slayer becomes the victim because of her work' Was all Buffy could think.</p>
<p>She turned to the first page in the journal.</p>
<p><i>Dear Emme:<br> I am so sorry. I am so pathetic. I let him do that to you, I am weak. WHY! WHY was I chosen? I can't do this. I...</i></p>
<p>The first message trailed off there. The page was rough in spots. Buffy looked closer. Tears. It was from tears Faith had cried onto the paper.</p>
<p>This discovery caused Buffy to ache inside again.</p>
<p>There was nothing she could do to ease Faith's pain. Not only that but she had caused her more. Physical and emotional.</p>
<p>Again Buffy started to weep.</p>
<p>It was all she could do to turn the page. There wasn't a message on the next page or the page after. She anxiously flipped though the entire thing. Once she got to the end there was an envelope.</p>
<p>She took it out and looked at it. She turned it over in her hands. It was addressed to her.</p>
<p>This was a mystery. Buffy had no idea how Faith could have known she would get this journal or why she would put a letter to her inside of it.</p>
<p>Something inside of her began to stir as she opened the plain white envelope.</p>
<p>She drew out the page and began to read.</p>
<p><i>Dear Buff:<br> Well this kinda sucks huh? Cause I must be dead or else you would never be looking at this. Was he a big vamp? Or was it a demon? Or mabey both. I hope your ok still. I never wanted you to get hurt. I bet you fought hard with me, right to the end, please God don't say he or whatever it was got you to. But for the battle we were side by side and five by five right?</i></p>
<p>Buffy was consumed by guilt. She started to cry freely.</p>
<p>"Yes Faith, yes I fought hard. Yes I fought with you, but not that way. I fought against you. We were side by side but not five by five. No, we were far from that. And no, he never got me. I never got me. Just you. I fucking killed you...No...You are not dead. Just a coma. It's just a coma. People get out of coma's all the time."</p>
<p>The note continued.</p>
<p><i>I couldn't tell you this to your face, so that's why I'm putting it down here. I know somehow you'll get it.</i></p>
<p><i>When you told me that I could trust you, and that you would always be there for me...I couldn't say anything back. I just wanted you to know that it meant the world to me. I think it was at that moment that I realized just how deep my feelings for you ran.</i></p>
<p><i>Is this creeping you out yet? Cause if it is sorry, but I have to say it.</i></p>
<p><i>Buffy Summers, I love you. And I'm sorry that I can't be there for you now. I tried I'm sure. I'm just so sorry.</i></p>
<p><i>Love always, Faith</i></p>
<p>The next part was in different ink, as if it had been written later.</p>
<p><i>ps- about the mayor...I got in too deep. At first all I wanted was to help you. But then he threatened me. He told me that if I left you would be the first to die. I belived him.</i></p>
<p><i>pps- sorry about Angel. I always had a bad temper and the jelousy consumed me. I don't expect you to forgive me...I hope he lives, I regretted it as soon as I did it.</i></p>
<p>Buffy was now hysterical and sobs wracked her small frame.</p>
<p>Faith was only in it to protect her? She had done all everything to save her?</p>
<p>So much pain so much guilt.</p>
<p>If ever she needed a release it was now. She needed something. Buffy got up and walked over to her closet, she took out the chest and the false bottom. She picked up the baggie and looked at it closely.</p>
<p>Buffy knew how it went. She knew the drill, she had seen it on tv enough times to know what to do.</p>
<p>Buffy walked over to her dresser and picked up a small cosmetic mirror. She took it over to her bedside table and set it down with the powder. She walked over to her garbage and pulled out an old slurpee cup. She took out the straw trimmed it down with her manicure scissors. Buffy placed it on the table as well.</p>
<p>Then she reached into her pocket and drew out her wallet. Inside was her hard plastic library card.</p>
<p>"Sunnydale High Library. Rupert Giles Librarian. How fucking ironic" She said aloud.</p>
<p>Buffy sat down on her bed and reached over onto the little table. She took the baggie and dumped a generous amount of the powder onto the mirror. She divided it into lines with the library card.</p>
<p>"Buffy Summers, vampire slayer, highschool graduate, class protector and slayer slayer."</p>
<p>Now sobbing hystericly she could barely get out the last words.</p>
<p>Buffy leaned over the table and placed one end of the shortened straw in her nose, and the other in front of a line. She plugged half her nose and sucked in hard with the straw. One line of white powder down and 4 to go.</p>
<p>Buffy did the rest of the lines quickly. Her nose was itching and she was sniffing, she continued to rub her nose. About 5 minutes later it started to kick in.</p>
<p>All of the sudden she was somewhere else. It felt so good. She was warm and elated. She felt she could do anything. Go anywhere, talk to anyone. All of it, she could do with ease.</p>
<p>Buffy felt as if she was floating around her room on a cloud. Everything was vivid and beautiful. Colors splashed across her walls, she reached out and touched them. She was touching the colors. The could she was on felt so soft and pillowy. Her mind was racing and all she could feel was pleasure.</p>
<p>Soon, about 20 minutes later Buffy started to feel worse. Everything about Faith hit her. And hard. That's when the anxiety kicked in.</p>
<p>Her world was spinning now and she felt cold and alone. Her head pounded and the light hurt her eyes. Her heart was beating fast and the room started to spin.</p>
<p>She needed more. Buffy repeated the process. More white powder onto the mirror, more lines with the card and finally the straw.</p>
<p>Again her nose hurt, but again she felt elated.</p>
<p>Pleasure filled her, from the tips of her toes to the top of her head. Pure joy. It was great, and unlike anything Buffy had ever felt before.</p>
<p>All too soon she started to feel sad and cold. The depression, the anxiety. She ran to her door to check if her mom was watching.</p>
<p>No, the coast was clear.</p>
<p>So again she snorted a few lines. This time, she felt  confidant and strong. She slipped on Faith's jacket and crawled out her window.</p>
<p>'Time for me to do some serious slayage.'</p>
<p>In her drug induced state, Buffy had the nerve to do anything. One problem though, she didn't have the ability.</p>
<p>She managed just barely to get safely to the ground, nearly breaking her neck falling.</p>
<p>She stumbled out across her front lawn and into the night.</p>
<p>"Gimme your best shot Sunnyhell!"</p>
<p>She shouted, and then collapsed. Her world went black.</p>
