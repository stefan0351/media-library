<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 11 -->

<p>Faith was stalking down each hallway with fury burning inside of her.</p>
<p>That was when she heard Buffy's voice coming from behind one of the doors.</p>
<p>Faith heard a few words and knew immediately what was going on.</p>
<p>Rage filled her and she kicked down the door, it went flying off it's hinges narrowly missing Buffy and the dealer who were standing just to the right of it.</p>
<p>Faith saw the guy manhandling Buffy and Buffy's feeble attempts at shaking him off, her repeatedly telling him to stop.</p>
<p>Faith had never felt like this before. Her vision was red and blurred and hate boiled up within her.</p>
<p>She grabbed the guy and threw him off of Buffy, tossing him roughly to the floor.</p>
<p>She looked back to make sure Buffy was ok, she was. Scared but ok.</p>
<p>Faith walked over to the guy who lay cowering on the floor, getting a good look at him for the first time.</p>
<p>"Jake Edson???" She said shock resonating in her voice.</p>
<p>"F-Faith? Oh shit." The guy tried to turtle.</p>
<p>"This is where you came you lowlife motherfucker. Sunnydale! Boston got a little to hot for you I take it?"</p>
<p>Faith didn't bother to hear his answer, she kicked him hard in the ribs.</p>
<p>"So, you just stayed long enough to get my mom hooked within an inch of her life and now this?? Look at her!! No don't! I don't want your dirty eyes on her. She's no junkie, and look at what you did to her!!"</p>
<p>He looked up at Buffy.</p>
<p>"I told you not to look at her!!"</p>
<p>This time Faith kicked him in the head. Hard.</p>
<p>"Get up. I SAID GET UP!"</p>
<p>Jake stood up weakly.</p>
<p>Faith backhanded him. He stumbled backwards. She delivered a cresent kick to his gut. He was now up against the wall. She punched him in the face, harder and harder, losing all control. She beat and beat on his face untill it was so bloody and bruised no facial featured were desernable.</p>
<p>The blood drew Faith out of her reverie and saw what she had done.</p>
<p>She started to kick him, again losing control.</p>
<p>"Faith!" Buffy screamed.</p>
<p>"Faith stop...look what you're doing! He's almost dead...he's gonna die soon! Don't do this!!!" Buffy pleaded.</p>
<p>Faith backed off.</p>
<p>The man who had essentially killed her mother, and tried to do the same to Buffy was now a puddle on the floor.</p>
<p>Faith started to cry. Tears flowing freely, she was no longer afraid to show emotion in front of anyone.</p>
<p>Buffy went over to her and hugged her.</p>
<p>"It's ok...Faith it's going to be ok."</p>
<p>"He...he killed my mom B. He got her hooked...she died B. A drug od."</p>
<p>Buffy was in shock. She could only imagine what seeing her in heroin shock could have been like for Faith.</p>
<p>"Oh Faith...I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>Faith continued to sob on Buffy's shoulder. Buffy too started to cry.</p>
<p>"Faith, Faith I'm so so so sorry." Buffy choked out.</p>
<p>"We have to leave. Let's go." Faith said.</p>
<p>They walked to the jeep and got in. Faith sat in the drivers seat. Buffy looked across at her.</p>
<p>There was still pain on Faith's face and in her eyes. All Buffy wanted was to take that pain away. Melt it out of Faith.</p>
<p>Buffy leaned in and started to kiss her gently. Faith accepted the kiss and she too leaned towards Buffy.</p>
<p>Their lips each gently caressing the others, tongues dueling in what seemed like a never ending battle. Neither wanted it to ever end. How they felt in eachothers arms...it could be compared to nothing. Neither had ever felt this way.</p>
<p>The kiss was full of passion and heat, but most of all, Love.</p>
<p align="center">------------------At Buffy's House---------------------</p>
<p> Before now, Buffy hadn't really realized what she was doing. The full effects of what had happened hadn't even begun to sink in.</p>
<p>Faith and Buffy were sitting on the couch in eachothers arms, comforting one another.</p>
<p>"Faith...I'm sorry about everything. I was so stupid."</p>
<p>"Yeah B, it was pretty dumb." Faith said.</p>
<p>Buffy punched her playfully.</p>
<p>"If you hadn't come when you did..."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"I mean, I was going to leave again. This time I wasn't going to come back."</p>
<p>Faith started to well up at the thought of life without Buffy.</p>
<p>"That...I would never let that happen. I would search the entire globe for you. Not stopping untill I found you."</p>
<p>"That'd be a wicked long trip Faith." Buffy said.</p>
<p>Faith laughed slightly at the mockery of her slang.</p>
<p>"Ah, no big. It would've been your bad." Faith said, mocking her right back.</p>
<p>The pair giggled and cuddled even more, getting as close to eachother as they could.</p>
<p>Suddenly Faith got serious.</p>
<p>"Buffy...you said you knew how Angel felt, and that's why you were leaving..."</p>
<p>"Yeah..."</p>
<p>"Angel didn't leave for the same reasons you were going to."</p>
<p>"You were going to leave out of love."</p>
<p>"Yeah. I love you so much. I didn't want to hurt you anymore."</p>
<p>"But you weren't. Your leaving would have hurt me more than anything else."</p>
<p>"I know that now."</p>
<p>"Angel, he left because he was selfish. He left because of his guilt. You had forgiven him, everybody had. It was his choice to leave, he...he belived he deserved to suffer, and that forgiveness he shouldn't be given."</p>
<p>"That's true as well. He never saw that we truly didn't blame him and that we just wanted the old Angel back. He didn't want my love. He wanted his pain."</p>
<p>Faith's face fell when Buffy said love.</p>
<p>Buffy noticed this and continued.</p>
<p>"I didn't love him anymore though. He knew it. That was part of his pain I think. It was easy for him to leave...to avoid the inevitable."</p>
<p>Faith realized what Buffy was saying.</p>
<p>"He knew I was falling in love with you. He knew he couldn't have me. So he ditched town and went somewhere that he could be alone."</p>
<p>Faith thought about this.</p>
<p>"And anyways, I think LA suits his finely tuned brooding abilities and cryptic guy routine a little better."</p>
<p>"I have to admit, that guy can brood with the best of them." Faith said.</p>
<p>"It's an art form with him."</p>
<p>They broke into a fit of giggles. The night continued on this way, giggeling, cuddeling, just being in love.</p>
