<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 4 -->

<p>As Buffy burst out of the hospital and into the bright Sunnydale heat she started to run. And run she did.</p>
<p>Before she knew it she was in front of Sunnydale High, or what was left of it anyways. Since the explosion it had been under construction to rebuild it, but with no mayor city affairs were not really being taken care of as they should have been.</p>
<p>Buffy wandered over to the back of the school and stared at the gaping hole that used to be the library.</p>
<p>A sad smile crossed her face at the bittersweet memories she had of the place.</p>
<p>'Oh Giles...you were so shocked that first day, how could the slayer forsake her sacred duties? Well, I couldn't. And look at where it got me.' She thought to herself.</p>
<p>Having done enough guilt tripping down memory lane for one day Buffy decided to head home.</p>
<p>She walked quickly she was almost running. The blonde girl in heels and a leather jacket running down the street in the middle of summer was drawing attention from passerbys. One guy was brave enough to talk to her.</p>
<p>"Hey sister...what's your rush?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked up startled.  "what?"</p>
<p>"I said what's the rush?" He wiped her tear stained cheeks.</p>
<p>"I...just leave me alone."</p>
<p>She tried to brush past him but he moved into her path so she couldn't get passed. Buffy was in no mood to fight but she would if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>She talked slowly now, being sure to enunciate each word so this time he would understand.</p>
<p>"Get...the...FUCK...out of my way."</p>
<p>A sick smile crossed the guys face.</p>
<p>"Such strong language for such a small girl. C'mon. I like you."</p>
<p>With that he grabbed her and started to drag her behind him.</p>
<p>"Listen asshole, and listen good. I don't have to go with you and I don't have to let you touch me. Get your filthy hands off now."</p>
<p>She spun around and out of his grasp, into her patented fighting stance.</p>
<p>"Hey little lady, I don't want to make you do anything your not comfortable with. I just thought that you could use my help. Look at you! Tear stained face, messy hair. I can help."</p>
<p>He had piqued her interest.</p>
<p>"You? How are you going to help me?"</p>
<p>"Let's just say I have something that can cheer you up...something good."</p>
<p>"Like what? I doubt you have the cure for the common coma. How about the cure for a sacred duty that you just can't escape and that causes all those you love, or at least a good number of them to die? Can you bring people back from the dead smart guy? No. I didn't think so." She spat the words at him.</p>
<p>"Actually sweetcakes, I do. And that's what I'm trying to show you. So come on and let's go."</p>
<p>Despite knowing better Buffy had to see what this guy had. She knew if it got to be bad she could probably get out of anything. She was the slayer after all.</p>
<p>They walked for a few blocks and came to a dingy apartment building, it made Faith's hotel look like some five star suite at the Plaza. Inside was even worse. Dirty rugs, cracked walls, Buffy was sure she had seen a somebody passed out in a corner. The place reeked of urine and somthing else. Somthing worse. Her thoughts were interupted by the guy's voice.</p>
<p>"Not anything special, but what lies within is well worth the scenery."</p>
<p>The guy opened up an apartment and they both went in. To her left was something that could have resemble a kitchenette at one point. To her left was a door that she assumed lead to the bedroom. Directly in front of her was a couch and a tv. Both looked like rejects from the 50's.</p>
<p>"Home sweet home." The guy said and smirked.</p>
<p>Buffy was so disgusted that she couldn't even respond, she just walked towards the couch and sat down. In her ragged state she didn't even care that a huge cockroach scurried under the cushions as she shifted on the lumpy piece of furniture.</p>
<p>"Ok, I'm ready for whatever it is you have that's going to cure me."</p>
<p>"You sure little girl?" Again the creepy smile.</p>
<p>"Just get it." She said and shot him a glance that sent him running to get whatever it was he had.</p>
<p>The guy went into the bedroom and when he emerged he was carrying a futuristic metal briefcase that looked so out of place in the disgusting retro apartment.</p>
<p>He approached and sat down beside Buffy on the couch. A little too close for comfort but she just didn't have it in her to care. The guy gently put the case down on the stained coffee table.</p>
<p>"Do you have any idea what may be in this case?"</p>
<p>"Do I look like I give a shit?" Was Buffy's curt reply. Followed by another look of hatred.</p>
<p>The guy just chuckled. He opened the case. Inside were several small baggie filled with fine white powder each with a unique label that Buffy could not quite read, a set of hypodermic needles, a few more baggies with other substances of different colors and textures.</p>
<p>"This is what I like to call mind candy. A little bit of happiness here on earth. And I, being the generous man I am will give it to you for free."</p>
<p>Buffy's enhanced slayer hearing told her that he had said 'this time' under his breath.</p>
<p>Fear struck her at the sight of the needles. Just like her 18th birthday...Giles had betrayed her. She could have died so easily. Her mom could have died. Buffy gritted her teeth at the thought.</p>
<p>'Whatever...I don't care about him. If it wasn't for him I could have gotten away from all of this. God! Who cares. I'll just see what this is about and then that's it. No strings attached.'</p>
<p>The guy pulled out one of the white baggies. And lay it on the table. He licked his pinky and dipped the tip in just barely, he drew it out and licked it off, motioning for Buffy to do the same.</p>
<p>The taste was strange. Unlike anything else. Medicine-y but not...sweet but sour, and yet bitter as well all at once. This mystified her.</p>
<p>The guy closed the case, leaving the baggie on the table in front of them. He stood up and took the case back into the room he had got it from.</p>
<p>"So...do you want it? It's good quality."</p>
<p>Buffy vaguely remembered learning something about drugs and things like that in health class. Forget it. The school itself doesn't even exist anymore.</p>
<p>Buffy picked up the baggie and shoved it into one of the pockets of the leather jacket. She stood up and headed for the door. The guy got up and followed her.</p>
<p>"Hey hey, not so fast. That'll only last you a day mabey two, here's my card. When you run out call me."</p>
<p>At being handed the card Buffy finally noticed how well dressed and groomed he was for living in such a dump. He even had a beeper and what she thought looked like a cell phone. Was that him BMW outside?</p>
<p>Again she pushed the thoughts out of her mind and she swaggered out of the place in a very Faith-like manner. As she went she was sure she heard the guy laugh slightly behind her.</p>
<p>It was getting late so Buffy decided the best place to go was home. It took her awhile but finally she got to her door. She went in and started to hastily go for the stairs.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Honey is that you?" She heard her mom say.</p>
<p>'Who the hell does she think it is?'</p>
<p>"Yeah it's me."</p>
<p>"Why the rush dear? Come down here, I haven't seen you all day."</p>
<p>Buffy was none to thrilled by the thought of having to talk to her mom with an illicit substance in her pocket.</p>
<p>"Umm...Ok mom." She headed down and stood by her mom.</p>
<p>"How was you day?"</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>"Did you see Mr. Giles?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He called me at work."</p>
<p>"WHAT? WHY?"</p>
<p>"He said he's been concerned about you since the whole graduation thing."</p>
<p>"Fuck him." Buffy muttered under her breath.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" It was now Joyce's turn to be in complete shock.</p>
<p>"Nothing"</p>
<p>Joyce's face showed her disbelief.</p>
<p>"Ok, well dinner will be ready in 45 minutes."</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>With that Buffy ran up to her room. Her mothers concerned look completely lost on Buffy's quickly dissapearing back.</p>
<p>Once safely in her room with the door shut and locked Buffy took the baggie out of her pocket and opened up her keepsake chest. She removed the false bottom revealing a few stakes, some garlic and some holy water. She tossed these things into the back of her closet and lay the baggie in it, now the sole occupant of the box. She then put the false bottom back in and locked the chest, shoving it into her closet.</p>
<p>"That's that" she muttered to herself.</p>
<p>Buffy took off Faith's jacket and slung it over the back of her chair. As she did this Buffy caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. For a second she thought it was Faith. She was wearing leather pants, and a mesh shirt that closely resembled something Faith would wear.</p>
<p>Buffy quickly turned away and looked at her room. Boxes and boxes of Faith's stuff cluttered it up. She had taken everything, not wanting to lose one precious memory of her Faith.</p>
<p>Her Faith. She tossed it around in her head, liking the sound of it. She opened up a box to look through some of the things.</p>
<p>Inside were some magazines. Buffy read the titles to herself: Guitar World, Music Weekly, Mad Magazine, and finally Martha Stewart Living.</p>
<p>The last one made Buffy smile. Faith had her little endearing secrets and a definate soft-side. This was a quiet reminder of all the things Buffy had yet to learn about her counterpart. Things she may never get a chance to learn.</p>
<p>Deeper down in the box were some photos. All of them were of the whole gang together. Happier times. Willow, Xander, Oz, Buffy and Faith all wrestling on the ground. Cordelia poster-girling it with Faith in the background making a face. Buffy and Willow giving eachother a high-five. Oz and Faith engaged in a serious conversation, it had been about why leather was so much more comfortable than vinyl. The thought made Buffy laugh softly. Another shot of Corelia and Xander hugging, and Willow and Oz hugging.</p>
<p>Buffy had no idea that Faith had all these pictures. When they had taken them, Faith had insited she didn't want copies. But somehow certian ones out of each persons copies had gone missing.</p>
<p>Buffy was suprised that Faith had kept them. They all thought she was evil and had just thrown them out of her memory.</p>
<p>Under the photos was a journal.</p>
<p>Before Buffy could open it up her mom called her from downstairs.</p>
<p>"Dinner time Buffy"</p>
<p>"Damn it." She said aloud.</p>
<p>The journal would have to wait. She got up, walked over to her bed and slid it under her pillow.</p>
<p>She vowed to read it right after dinner.</p>
