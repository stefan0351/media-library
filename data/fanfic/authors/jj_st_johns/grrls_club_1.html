<!-- The Grrls Club \ Chapter One: What To Wear? -->

<p><u>Jennifer and Megan Delaney's Quarters</u></p>
		<p>"Popcorn?" Questioned Megan</p>
		<p>"Done" Jennifer ticked an imaginary list</p>
		<p>"Sushi"</p>
		<p>"Tick"</p>
		<p>"Cheese and Bickies"</p>
		<p>"Yep"</p>
		<p>"Cushions"</p>
		<p>"Done"</p>
		<p>"And finally.."</p>
		<p>"Alcohol!"</p>
		<p>"All done, I think that's it Megan"</p>
		<p>The Delaney twins had successfully turned their living quarters into a 20th century lounge room complete with a television that played holovids. They looked around their room and admired their efforts. The room was ready for the inaugural meeting of the grrls club.</p>
		<p>"This is going to be a hoot Jen, I cant believe we didn't think of it sooner" chuffed Megan</p>
		<p>" I know, I know, How stupid can we be" laughed Jen.</p>
		<p><u>The Wildman's Quarters</u></p>
		<p>"But Mom I am a girl, why can't I go?" Asked a very hopeful Naomi Wildman.</p>
		<p>"Sweetie you know it's for big girls" Samantha kissed the top of her daughters head." Besides you'll have lots of fun with Neelix"</p>
		<p>"Will you tell me all about it mom?"</p>
		<p>"Sure thing sweetie. Now what do you think of these PJ?" Samantha turned around in her pink checkered flannel PJ.</p>
		<p>"I think mom that these would look good with those" Naomi tapped a few commands into the replicator.</p>
		<p>"They're absolutely great" Samantha took a pair of whit fluffy bunny slippers from the replicator and proceeded to put them on. Naomi giggled. A chirp announced Neelix at the door. Samantha let Neelix in and then stood at the open door, she looked left then right, then took of at a fast pace to the Delaney Quarters.</p>
		<p><u>Susan Nicoletti and Tarzi Dax Quarters</u></p>
		<p>" What about these?" Enquired Tarzi</p>
		<p>"I like the purple ones better, you know the silk ones"</p>
		<p>" Okay Susan, I'll change" Tarzi went over to her chest of draws and proceeded to pick out the purple boxer and singlet PJ set.</p>
		<p>" Now me. Tarzi what do you think about these?" Susan stood before Tarzi in a white night shirt.</p>
		<p>They twirled and fussed for the next 5 minutes. When they both were happy with their looks, they opened the door to their quarters looked left then right and then they ran barefoot to the Delaney quarters.</p>
		<p><u>Cha'Hal Laren and Michelle Smythes Quarters</u></p>
		<p>"Cha'Hal you cant be serious" giggled Michelle Ensign Cha'Hal stood before her mate in a pair of orange briefs and a white T-shirt with a big orange teddy bear motif on the front.</p>
		<p>"Oh go gone Shelly humor me put yours on"</p>
		<p>Ensign Michelle Smythe sighed she knew all hope was lost. She wouldn't win this one.</p>
		<p>The two ensigns stood at their door in identical outfits with matching oversized orange teddy bear slippers.</p>
		<p>"Ok Shelly on two" Cha'Hal took hold of her girlfriend's hand "One, two!" The ensigns took of skipping to the Delaney Quarters.</p>
		<p><u>B'Elanna Torres Quarters</u></p>
		<p>"Targs" B'Elanna said to no one in particular </p>
		<p>"What am I going to wear!" Another set of PJ's landed onto the pile already on the Lieutenants bed.</p>
		<p>"Nuh Huh" B'Elanna discarded the green set and the blue flannels. "Argh!!!"</p>
		<p>"Yep these will do" B'Elanna stood in front of the bedroom mirror in a pair of black boxers with a matching midriff top. She took another 10min to finalize herself.</p>
		<p>She steadied herself at the door to her quarters. B'Elanna looked left then right, fixed her best klingon I'll kill you if you say anything stare and proceeded to stroll to the Delaney sisters quarters.</p>
		<p><u>Seven of Nine's Quarters</u></p>
		<p>Seven was at her computer console in her living room.</p>
		<p>" Tell me Doctor why is it necessary for me to attend this grrls club?"</p>
		<p>The Doctor looks at Seven. He knew she was a bit anxious by the way that her implant above her left eye slightly moved. </p>
		<p>"Seven? Didn't Lieutenant Nicoletti discuss the topic of why should you attend today?"</p>
		<p>"Susan informed me that it was a different way for me to embrace my humanity. I believe she was not telling the truth"</p>
		<p>"Why do believe that the Susan was not telling you the truth Seven?"</p>
		<p>"The way her lip slightly curled into a smile and her pupil dilated slightly"</p>
		<p>"Seven, she was probably thinking about all the fun that your going to have"</p>
		<p>"Fun is irrelevant" stated Seven hoping to end the discussion so she wouldn't have to go.</p>
		<p>"Seven in the immortal words of wisdom from Ensign Paris you need to lighten up. Go Seven you'll experience girl talk, staying up all night playing social games generally having a good time"</p>
		<p>"I still do not see the relevance of attending"</p>
		<p>The Doctor thought it was time to play his trump card. "Didn't B'Elanna specifically ask if you were going and that it would be great to go out together"</p>
		<p>Seven lips turned into a slight smile. Yes it was true that B'Elanna had specifically asked if she was going. She remembered the sparkle in B'Elanna's eyes and how that made her warm.</p>
		<p>"Ok Doctor I will attend so as not to disappoint the lieutenant"</p>
		<p>"Good Seven. Now remember that your sleep wear is programmed in to the replicator unit under sleep wear one and no footwear. You will look very cute"</p>
		<p>Seven arched her implant above her left eye and queried "cute?"</p>
		<p>" Your invitation did say sleep wear must look cute. Oh and have fun Seven. Doctor out"</p>
		<p>Seven looked at the data pad to her right. Yes the invitation did say cute sleep wear and no sight to sight transport to their quarters. Seven walked over to the replicator and keyed in the appropriate commands.</p>
		<p>She looked at herself in the mirror. She wondered what the doctor was thinking when he programmed these.</p>
		<p>As Seven left her quarters she passed a very puzzled looking ensign Kim.</p>
		<p>"Good evening Ensign Kim" Seven kept walking as if there was nothing wrong with seeing a 6ft ex borg walking down the corridor in a loosely fitting all in one blue PJ. </p>
		<p>When Harry gained his composure and turn to respond, he was graced with the sight of a very cute bottom that was covered with a big-buttoned flap.</p>
		<p>"It IS now!" He said to know one in particular.</p>
		<p><u>Jennifer and Megan Delaney's Quarters</u></p>
		<p>Jennifer looked around her quarters. It seemed very busy and noisy with lots of hoots, especially when Seven and B'Elanna turned up. Megan was busy handing out Champaign glasses to everyone. Everyone was here except one. She remembered when B'Elanna came to her with the suggestion and the heated discussion that followed with Megan. It took all her powers of reasoning to convince Megan that it was a good idea.</p>
		<p>The door chirped announcing that the last guest had arrived. Jennifer opened the door. The giggles in the room died down a bit, everyone looked at the door.</p>
		<p>At the door stood Captain Kathryn Janeway in a pair of red flannel PJ with little whit ducklings all over them. In her arms instead of the fluffy toy were two rather large bottles of Picard Champaign.</p>
		<p>"Well Jennifer are you going to let me in. It wouldn't be good to give my commanding officer any more ammunition than he all ready has to humiliate me now would it?" smirked the Captain</p>
		<p>Jennifer moved aside and let the Captain through.</p>
		<p>Kathryn looked around the room most of her junior officers were their looking splendid in their PJ and with empty glasses in their hands.</p>
		<p>" Looks like I got here just in time" She handed the bottles to Jennifer.</p>
		<p>" So Captain, Is this the new command uniform?" Chuckled B'Elanna to break the ice.</p>
		<p>"It's Kathryn tonight B'Elanna" she grabbed her collar of her PJ and turned it up to show everyone.</p>
		<p>"Look No pips"</p>
		<p>The room broke into laughter</p>
		<p>"Ok Kathryn, Open this and get pouring" said Jennifer handing Kathryn one of the bottles.</p>
		<p>Kathryn proceeded to fill everyone's glasses; she even convinced Seven that it was a GOOD idea to have some.</p>
		<p>Megan tapped the side of her glass and proceeded to clear her throat in an unconvincing serious manner.</p>
		<p>"Hmm Hmmm Ok Grrls here is to the inaugural annual meeting of the Grrls club!!."</p>
		<p>Lots of shouting of "hear hear" echoed around the room.</p>
