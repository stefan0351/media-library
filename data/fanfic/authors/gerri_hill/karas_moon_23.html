<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Twenty-Three -->

<p>Kara opened the windows to the breeze, surprisingly happy to be back at the
			cottage. She took a cigarette and walked to the water, her eyes feasting on the
			blue expanse of Puget Sound, sail boats competing with the much larger vessels
			of the sea.</p>
		<p>She strolled the shore, watching sea gulls flying over, trying to clear her
			head. She had made the right decision, she knew. And it felt good to be back
			home, around her familiar surroundings. Away from Ginny. Maybe she would be able
			to work here. For the last week, she had not been able to pick up a brush. Her
			heart and mind had been elsewhere.</p>
		<p>She breathed deeply, savoring the smell of the sea and she closed her eyes,
			letting the wind soothe her, the sound of the water relax her. And it did. For
			the last two hours, she had thought of little else, other than the words Ginny
			had spoken to her. "I'm in love with you." Kara shut her mind to Ginny's
			whispered words. She didn't want to remember the pain in Ginny's eyes when Kara
			had left her.</p>
		<p>She turned her back to the wind and cupped her cigarette, lighting it with
			practiced ease. She had forgotten about her daily count and had bought an entire
			carton when she had stopped at the grocery store on her way home. Bad habits die
			hard, she thought as she climbed the hill back to her cottage.</p>
		<p>She was actually able to work, and for the first time in her life, the brush
			flew over the canvas without the accompanying sketch to guide her. She painted
			from memory. She painted from the heart. </p>
		<p>The giant tree loomed over the forest, beckoning the visitor into the woods
			for a closer look. The sun was gone, leaving only a faint glow in the sky, but
			the moon was out, shining ghostly upon the forest. Kara brought the trees to
			life in the moonlight. And the giant monster in the middle held the secret. Upon
			its old, crusty bark, she painted the shadows of two lovers, embracing. Two
			lovers locked in each other's arms.</p>
		<p>She worked day and night, stopping only occasionally to nap and when she
			remembered, to eat. </p>
		<p>It was to be hers to keep. She would not share it with anyone. It was much
			too personal for that. But, oh, it pained her to remember the need Ginny had for
			her that night. So much need that Ginny had not cared that Phil was coming along
			the path, looking for them. She had not cared that he might catch them. "Don't
			stop," she had pleaded with Kara. And Kara couldn't. She, too, ignored the sound
			of Phil's voice. She only wanted to give what Ginny had needed.</p>
		<p>She dropped her arms to her sides, exhausted. She stared at the shadow
			figures, remembering. And she cried.</p>
