		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." A pause, then, "How's it going?"</p>
		<p>Ginny felt her heart constrict at the sound of Kara's soft voice and she
			clutched the phone to her, as if she could touch Kara.</p>
		<p>"Okay," she lied. "I guess."</p>
		<p>"Oh." </p>
		<p>"We're going to Drury Falls this afternoon. Nana wants a campfire and
			hotdogs," she explained.</p>
		<p>"Sounds like fun."</p>
		<p>"Come with us?" she asked hesitantly.</p>
		<p>"I don't think so," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"Please? Nana wanted me to call you. She expects you to be there." Ginny
			lowered her voice, glancing into the living room where Phil and Nana sat. "I
			want you to come," she added softly.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, it would be uncomfortable for you . . . for me, too."</p>
		<p>"I know, Kara. Don't you think I know? But I need to see you," Ginny pleaded.
			"Please, Kara. I may very well go crazy if I don't see you."</p>
		<p>"Hotdogs?"</p>
		<p>"We've got some vegetarian ones at the store. I'll get some for you," she
			promised.</p>
		<p>She heard Kara's deep sigh and she knew that her jaw was clinched and she
			wished she were there to soothe it. To hold her. </p>
		<p>"Okay. I'll come," she said finally. "If you think we'll be okay."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Kara," Ginny said softly. "I . . . I miss you."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't. This is hard enough."</p>
		<p>"I know. And I lied before. It's not okay. I'm so miserable."</p>
		<p>She heard Kara's low chuckle.</p>
		<p>"Sweetheart, I'm the one who's miserable." </p>
		<p>She hung up, staring at the phone, wondering what she was going to do. Kara
			was right. It would be uncomfortable for them, both of them, but she had to see
			her. She needed to look into her eyes. She closed her own, remembering Kara's
			soft touch upon her body, the soft lips that had brought her such pleasure. It
			wasn't Phil. It never had been. She had been a fool to allow him to come here
			and a bigger fool yet to allow him into her bed. It was Kara she wanted. In her
			life and in her bed. Not Phil. Not any man.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>They hiked up to the falls and sat on the rock, just out of the reach of the
			cool spray. Ginny had hoped that Kara would come early, but by the time that
			Nana was ready to hike, there had been no sign of her. Ginny was afraid that she
			had changed her mind and that she wouldn't come, after all. And she needed her
			to come. She needed to see her. She needed to talk to her, to tell her how she
			felt and she couldn't wait another day. As she sat there, she had already
			decided that if Kara didn't show, she would drive to the cabin herself. She
			didn't give a damn what Phil or Nana thought. </p>
		<p>"This is beautiful," Phil said. "Good idea, Nana."</p>
		<p>She beamed at him and Ginny had a crazy notion that Nana loved him much more
			than Ginny ever had. She watched him. He was a handsome man. She had always
			thought so, anyway. But she knew now that he wasn't what she wanted and he never
			could be. She knew without a doubt that she would never be with a man again. She
			knew that with certainty after last night. </p>
		<p>She had cried and Phil hadn't understood. He had held her and tried to soothe
			her but she had pulled out of his arms. She didn't want his touch. She didn't
			ever want his touch again. She had taken her pillow and slept on the couch, only
			going back to her room when she heard Nana stirring.</p>
		<p>Phil hadn't commented on it today, but he had watched her, she knew. And
			tonight, she would tell him. She would tell him that she didn't love him and
			that she was not going to marry him and she would send him away. It would break
			Nana's heart, of course, but Ginny couldn't worry about that now. She could not
			survive the week if things remained as they were. </p>
		<p>It was nearly six when they got back to their picnic table, but still no sign
			of Kara. Ginny tried not to let her disappointment show, helping to unload their
			firewood for their later fire and showing the proper amount of enthusiasm for
			the hotdog dinner that Nana had planned.</p>
		<p>"I wonder where Kara is?" Nana asked for the third time and she stared off
			down the dirt road, looking for her truck.</p>
		<p>"Probably working and lost track of time," Ginny offered. And perhaps it was
			true. </p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Kara turned the Land Cruiser onto the bumpy road, cigarette clamped between
			her teeth, her eighth of the day. She would rather being going anywhere at this
			moment other than to meet Phil. Even the damn dentist, she thought But Ginny had
			pleaded and Kara admitted that she couldn't stay away from her another day, even
			if she had to share her with a man. A man who hoped to marry her.</p>
		<p>Had they slept together? Of course. He had come up here for that very reason,
			after all, she thought bitterly. Jealousy consumed her and ate at her stomach
			and she hated herself for what she was feeling. See what happens when you fall
			for a straight woman, she thought. Straight? Ginny was many things, but straight
			was not one of them. Not after the way she made love to Kara. She couldn't be.
			The way she touched her with such intensity, such passion. No. No one could make
			love to another woman like that and be straight.</p>
		<p>Nana saw her and waved and Kara forced a smiled and waved back. She had never
			been one for praying, but she sent a silent plea to anyone who might be
			listening.
			<i>Please, just get me thought this evening</i>.
		</p>
		<p>"We were wondering if you'd forgotten," Nana said. </p>
		<p>"Working," she lied. She hadn't
			picked up a brush in two days.</p>
		<p>Ginny walked up to her and met her eyes, uncaring that Nana was watching
			them. All she wanted to do was to wrap her arms around her and hold her. "Kara,"
			she said softly. "I'm so glad you're here," she whispered, hoping Nana couldn't
			hear.</p>
		<p>"Hi." Kara's eyes greedily traveled over Ginny, remembering how responsive
			she had been in her arms and she felt her pulse quicken. She shouldn't have
			come, she thought.</p>
		<p>"Come meet Phil," Nana said and pulled Kara after her. Ginny saw the anguish
			in Kara's eyes as they left her and she followed close behind. </p>
		<p>"Phil, this is Kara Morgan, the artist," Nana presented importantly.</p>
		<p>"Hello," he said and took Kara's outstretched hand. "I've seen your work.
			Very nice."</p>
		<p>Kara smiled and released his hand quickly. He was attractive, she thought
			with dismay. If you liked that sort of thing, anyway. </p>
		<p>"Which is more than we have," Nana added.</p>
		<p>"I don't really have anything finished, Louise."</p>
		<p>"My boss bought Tomorrow and Today," Phil said.</p>
		<p>"Oh." Kara smiled, hating the fact that this man had access to her painting.
			"That's one of my favorites. Top ten."</p>
		<p>"You mean, you rank your paintings?" Phil asked. "What? One to ten?"</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "Some I just like more than others," she said. "But everyone
			has different tastes. Some I like so much, they become too personal to part
			with," she said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, so you don't sell everything?"</p>
		<p>She smiled briefly and Ginny saw that it didn't reach her eyes. "Sometimes I
			paint just for me," she said. "Others, I give as gifts." She shrugged, not
			wanting to have this conversation with him.</p>
		<p>"Wow. Some gift. Well, it's very nice to meet you. Nana's told me quite a bit
			about you," he said.</p>
		<p>Kara glanced at Louise who smiled sheepishly. "A beer?" Louise asked.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, please."</p>
		<p>"I'll get it," Phil offered.</p>
		<p>Kara turned and found Ginny watching her and her eyes moved over her quickly.
			Ginny brought her hands out, as if to touch her, then dropped them to her sides.
		</p>
		<p>"Kara," she whispered softly, her eyes searching. She didn't care that Nana
			was watching.</p>
		<p>"Here you go," Phil said and Kara turned to him, muttering a thank you and
			took the offered beer.</p>
		<p>They sat in lawn chairs and Kara observed this man that had shared Ginny's
			life. And still did. An attractive man, but still a man, she noted. And
			possessive. He sat close to Ginny, touching her knee with his hand as he spoke
			and Kara couldn't take her eyes off of them. She felt jealously smoldering
			inside of her and hated it. What she and Ginny had shared was most likely
			temporary. And most likely over. Phil had come here to stake his claim. </p>
		<p>"Are you from Seattle?" he asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Well, once Ginny moves back, we'll have to get together," he said
			easily.</p>
		<p>She met his eyes for a moment. "Sure," she said lightly. She ventured a
			glance at Ginny who met her eyes and Kara did not miss the quick apology that
			flashed her way.</p>
		<p>"Did you bring your sketch pad, Kara?" Nana asked. "It's almost sunset."</p>
		<p>"No, Louise. I've sketched the falls before. They're much better at sunrise,"
			she said. </p>
		<p>"They're beautiful at any time," Phil stated. </p>
		<p>Kara smiled, hating this man. "Yes, they are. I was speaking of sketching,
			though."</p>
		<p>Ginny rubbed her temples, feeling a headache approaching. This had been a
			mistake, she thought wearily. Phil was actually competing with Kara, as if he
			knew she was a threat.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?" </p>
		<p>"Hmmm?" She looked up at Nana.</p>
		<p>"Why don't you take Kara to the Big Tree?"</p>
		<p>Ginny glanced at Kara. "Have you seen it?" she asked. It would give them a
			chance to talk. She hoped Kara had not been there before.</p>
		<p>"No. What big tree?"</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed. "Big Tree. It's a cedar. Three hundred feet tall and as wide
			as a house," she said.</p>
		<p>"You go ahead. Phil and I will start the fire," Nana said.</p>
		<p>They walked away in silence, Kara with her hands shoved in her pockets,
			Ginny's folded securely under her arms. When they reached the trailhead, the sun
			was already past the trees and shadows covered the path as they entered the
			forest. They were both silent as they walked.</p>
		<p>"Are you upset with me?" Ginny finally asked.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Then why won't you talk to me?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"What should I say? That Phil's a nice guy?" Kara thought she hated him.</p>
		<p>"No. That's not what I mean. You're being difficult," Ginny accused. </p>
		<p>"I'm being difficult? I didn't even what to come here this evening," she
			said. "I didn't want to see you with him. To see him touch you like that." </p>
		<p>"Yes, it was a mistake," Ginny said. "You were right."</p>
		<p>They walked on, slowly, along the path, both struggling with their
			thoughts.</p>
		<p>"Have you enjoyed his company?" Kara finally asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny ignored her question, instead, she pointed to the massive tree up
			ahead. "The Big Tree," she said.</p>
		<p>"Jesus," Kara murmured and she bent her head back, trying to find the top as
			it disappeared into the sky. "That's one big tree."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled, but it faded when she met Kara's blue eyes. "Have you enjoyed
			his company?" Kara asked again.</p>
		<p>"Don't, Kara," Ginny said softly. She walked on, up to the base of the giant
			and leaned against it.</p>
		<p>"You've slept with him?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny closed her eyes, not wanting to discuss Phil. Not now.</p>
		<p>"Haven't you?" Kara asked again.</p>
		<p>"He's sharing my room, yes," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"He's made love to you?" </p>
		<p>Ginny looked away, her hands reaching out to touch the rough bark. Made love?
			No. She wouldn't call it that. Kara gripped her forearms hard and turned her
			around to face her.</p>
		<p>"I'm just so . . . lost," Ginny whispered. "I don't have a say in anything.
			He acted like we hadn't been apart at all."</p>
		<p>Kara stared at her, blue eyes peering into green. "Did he make love to you
			like I did?" Kara asked, her eyes holding Ginny prisoner. </p>
		<p>"Kara . . .."</p>
		<p>"Did you ask him to? Did you want him to?"</p>
		<p>Ginny trembled under Kara's angry gaze, but she couldn't look away.</p>
		<p>Kara pushed Ginny roughly against the tree, holding her there. "Did you want
			him the way you wanted me?" she whispered, pressing her body against Ginny. "Did
			you beg him to put his mouth on you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head, her breath coming quickly through her parted lips.</p>
		<p>"Did he make you feel the way that I did?" Kara demanded and she moved her
			face to Ginny's, foreheads touching as their breath whispered against each
			other. </p>
		<p>Ginny closed her eyes and waited for Kara's bruising, angry kiss. But the
			lips that touched hers were soft and gentle, not angry and Ginny's mouth opened
			to her, her hands moving to Kara's face. </p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . I can't stand this," Kara whispered. She covered Ginny's breasts
			with urgent hands, cupping them softly, feeling the nipples strain against her
			palms. "The thought of him touching you . . . like this," she whispered, her
			voice trailing away as she kissed Ginny. "Ginny, did you feel this with him?
			Were your breasts ready for his touch, like they are mine?" she demanded.</p>
		<p>"No, Kara . . . never like you," Ginny whispered into her mouth. "Never like
			you." </p>
		<p>Kara held her close, her hands cupping Ginny's hips, pressing them to her,
			trying to make Ginny see how it was with them, how it could never be with anyone
			else. But Ginny's hands wouldn't still. They took Kara's face and brought her
			mouth close and she moaned softly when their tongues touched.</p>
		<p>"I want you so much," Ginny whispered urgently. "Kara, please." Ginny's chest
			heaved as if she'd been running and she clutched Kara to her. "I need you," she
			whispered. "I need you to make love to me." </p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . don't," Kara warned.</p>
		<p>"I mean it," she said and she took Kara's hand and shoved it between her
			legs. "Touch me."</p>
		<p>Kara could feel her wetness through her shorts and she was lost. She pressed
			Ginny against the tree and unbuttoned her shorts in one quick motion, her hand
			pushing past the waistband with ease. Ginny's legs parted and Kara's fingers
			moved through her wetness, touching her so gently that Ginny nearly cried.</p>
		<p>"Oh, God." </p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .." Kara breathed against her mouth. </p>
		<p>Ginny's legs failed to support her and she clung to Kara, her back arched
			against the rough bark of the giant tree. She had never wanted like this, never
			needed like this and she held Kara's hand to her, harder.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>Kara's tongue in Ginny's mouth matched the rhythm of her fingers and she held
			Ginny as she rocked against her, bringing her closer to orgasm.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? Kara?" a voice called to them from the forest trail.</p>
		<p>Kara froze at the sound of Phil's voice as it carried through the trees. He
			was looking for them.</p>
		<p>Ginny grabbed Kara's neck and pulled her back to her. "Please, don't stop,"
			she begged. "Don't stop."</p>
		<p>"Ginny," Kara whispered. "Phil is coming."</p>
		<p>"I don't care about him. I need you." Ginny's hands guided Kara's mouth back
			to hers. "Don't stop, Kara. Not now."</p>
		<p>Kara moved on her again, her fingers frantic now and Ginny arched against her
			hand, her body convulsing, throbbing and Kara swallowed her scream, sliding down
			the base of the tree with Ginny as her legs gave way.</p>
		<p>"Kara," Ginny sighed and she let her tears fall. "I'm so sorry," she
			whispered. "I'm so sorry." </p>
		<p>"Ginny? Kara?" Phil called again.</p>
		<p>"We're coming," Kara yelled to him and she saw the beam of his flashlight
			through the trees and she just now realized how dark it had become.</p>
		<p>"Kara, I'm sorry I made you do that," Ginny whispered against her mouth. "I
			just . . . needed you. I needed your touch."</p>
		<p>Kara took her face in gentle hands. "You don't ever have to be sorry for
			wanting me that way," Kara said and she wiped the tears from Ginny's eyes with
			her thumbs. "Come on. We've got to get back."</p>
		<p>Ginny let herself be pulled to her feet and she stood by numbly as Kara's
			hands came to her and tucked her shirt back into her shorts. Oh, God, she
			thought.
			<i>I'm in love with her</i>.
		</p>
		<p>"Ginny, honey, come on," Kara urged. "He's coming."</p>
		<p>Oh, Lord
			<i>. A simple endearment can melt
				my heart</i>. I love her, Ginny thought again. And on the heels of that: What
			have I done?
		</p>
		<p>Kara took her hand and pulled her along the trail just as Phil's light came
			into view. Their hands dropped immediately and they took a step apart.</p>
		<p>"There you are," he said. "We were getting worried a bear had eaten you or
			something."</p>
		<p>Ginny couldn't find her voice and Kara spoke for them. "We got to talking and
			just lost track of time," she said.</p>
		<p>"Well, come on. Nana's starving." He draped a possessive arm around Ginny's
			shoulders and walked ahead of Kara. Kara watched them, watched as Ginny's legs
			attempted to keep up with Phil's. She hated him.</p>
		<p>"I was getting worried," Nana said. "It gets dark quickly in the forest."</p>
		<p>"You know how girls can talk," Phil said. </p>
		<p>"Open the wine, Phil," Nana said. "I'm going to celebrate." She smiled and
			clasped Ginny's hands. "Why didn't you tell me?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Tell you what?" Ginny asked weakly. </p>
		<p>"That you're getting married! Phil told me you talked about it yesterday. I'm
			so excited I can hardly stand it," she said.</p>
		<p>"Married?" Ginny repeated in a hushed whisper. Her eyes flew to Phil, then,
			more importantly, to Kara.</p>
		<p>"Isn't it exciting, Kara? I suppose Ginny told you all about it in the
			woods," Nana said excitedly.</p>
		<p>Kara couldn't breathe and her eyes moved slowly to Ginny. "Yes," she managed.
			"Wonderful."</p>
		<p>Phil walked up, practically beaming and Kara felt as humiliated as she ever
			had in her life. She forced a smile to her face and offered her hand to him. "I
			suppose congratulations are in order, then." She wondered if he could still feel
			Ginny's wetness on her fingers. </p>
		<p>"Thank you," he said sincerely. "I'm so thrilled she accepted." </p>
		<p>Kara glanced at Ginny, keeping the pain in her eyes shielded. "I hope you'll
			be very happy," she said to Ginny.</p>
		<p>Ginny was certain that she was going to pass out right here. With any luck,
			she would fall into the fire and it would all be over quickly. She shot Phil a
			look that would kill most men and he had the good sense to look away from her.
			She looked again at Kara, wanting to take her away from here and explain, but
			Kara refused to meet her eyes.</p>
		<p>Kara forced down her hot dog, nearly choking on every bite. She refused to
			look at Ginny. She refused to look at Phil. Tension settled around the campfire
			and even Nana seemed to notice.</p>
		<p>"Have you set a date?" Nana asked, disrupting the silence.</p>
		<p>"No," Phil said. "But I hope soon. The sooner the better, you know."</p>
		<p>Ginny said nothing and she tossed her plate into the fire, and everyone
			watched as her uneaten hot dog sizzled in the flames. She would kill him, she
			decided. She had just cause. He had just ruined her life. And Kara. Kara
			wouldn't even look at her. And who could blame her. One minute, Ginny is begging
			her to make love to her, the next, she finds out Ginny's to be married. She
			groaned softly. God, what had just happened here? </p>
		<p>"And babies?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"Nana! Please," Ginny said quietly.</p>
		<p>"Well, you're not getting any younger," she continued</p>
		<p>"Nana . . .
			stop," Ginny said sharply and she shot Phil another look.</p>
		<p>Kara waited what she thought was a respectable time, then stood. "I've got
			some work to finish," she lied. "Thank you for inviting me," she said to Louise.
			"But I need to get going."</p>
		<p>"Are you leaving already? We've got marshmallows, too," Nana offered.</p>
		<p>Kara ran her hands through her hair and she wanted to scream. "I'll have to
			pass," she said. "Nice to meet you, Phil. It was . . . enlightening."</p>
		<p>"Maybe I'll see you around this week," he said.</p>
		<p>"Probably not. I've got a lot of work to do." She turned, and with only a nod
			to Ginny, walked purposefully to her truck.</p>
		<p>"Kara, wait," Ginny called and ran after her. She had to talk to her. She
			didn't care that Phil and Nana were staring after her.</p>
		<p>Kara kept walking, not trusting herself to speak.</p>
		<p>"Wait," Ginny demanded in a soft voice.</p>
		<p>Kara stopped, her hand on the door. "I've nothing to say to you."</p>
		<p>"I didn't know anything about that."</p>
		<p>"Really?"</p>
		<p>"How can you think I can want you like that if I'm planning on marrying
			Phil?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara's eyes bored into hers. "One last time? Cheap thrill?"</p>
		<p>"Don't be like that. It's not you," Ginny said softly. "You know how I feel
			about you," Ginny insisted.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, go back where you belong," she said, motioning with her head. </p>
		<p>"I don't belong with him," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Well, you certainly don't belong with me."</p>
		<p>Ginny felt as if she'd been slapped and she stood by silently as Kara slammed
			the door and sped off.</p>
		<p>She walked slowly back to the fire, accepting the burning marshmallow without
			a word.</p>
		<p>"Kara sure was quiet tonight," Nana said after an eternity of silence.</p>
		<p>"She's different," Phil commented. </p>
		<p>Certainly different from you, Ginny thought. And I'm in love with her and she
			doesn't want me anymore.</p>
		<p>They packed their things and drove back, Ginny thankful there was no more
			talk about a wedding. When Phil would have followed Nana into the house, Ginny
			stopped him.</p>
		<p>"I'd like to talk to you. In private," she said, glancing at Nana. When Nana
			closed the door, Ginny turned on him, eyes flashing. "How dare you?" she
			hissed.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .."</p>
		<p>"How dare you tell Nana that? You know how much she wants us to get
			married."</p>
		<p>He had the audacity to smile at her. "I needed all the help I could get."</p>
		<p>"You bastard," she spat, wanting to slap the smile from his face.</p>
		<p>"Ginny! You act like this is a surprise. We've talked about it."</p>
		<p>"I'm not going to marry you. You knew that last night." Her voice softened.
			"Phil, I'm not in love with you."</p>
		<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
		<p>"I don't love you. I'm not going to marry you."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, we've spent four . . . nearly five years together. We're good
			together."</p>
		<p>"Good?" She shook her head. "You call what you did to me last night good?
			No."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, let's talk about this. I was trying to make love to you."</p>
		<p>"Make love? You forced yourself on me, after I asked you to stop."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, we're a couple. Couples make love." </p>
		<p>"I want you to leave," she said. "In the morning."</p>
		<p>"I'm here a couple of days, you get pissed off and you're sending me away?"
			He laughed. "Ginny, be reasonable."</p>
		<p>"I am being reasonable. And you're right," she said. "I am pissed off. I'm
			pissed as hell that you told Nana we were getting married and I'm pissed as hell
			that you're even here in the first place." She was pacing then, her voice rising
			with each word. "You come up here and act like nothing has changed. You act like
			I didn't leave nearly a year ago because I didn't want to get married. How . . .
			dare . . . you?"</p>
		<p>Phil stared at her and for the first time, she saw uncertainty in his
			eyes.</p>
		<p>"You were just scared. Marriage is a big step, Ginny. But I love you."</p>
		<p>"You don't even know me anymore, Phil. I'm not the same person that
			left."</p>
		<p>Phil stared at her again, silently. Finally, he brushed at his moustache with
			one finger.</p>
		<p>"What's with
			you and the artist?" he asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny wasn't afraid to meet his eyes. "My relationship with her is none of
			your business."</p>
		<p>"If I didn't know you better, I'd say . . .."</p>
		<p>"Don't, Phil," she said quietly. "You have no idea."</p>
		<p>"I watched you. You were so quiet before she came and then when she got
			there, you couldn't take your eyes off her." His voice was angry and he grabbed
			her arms. "Did that dyke come on to you or what? Is that what this is
			about?"</p>
		<p>"Dyke?" Ginny laughed softly in his face. "Is that what she is?" </p>
		<p>He shoved her away, his eyes searching hers for answers. "Did she?"</p>
		<p>"My relationship with her is none of your business," she said again.</p>
		<p>"Isn't it? My God, Ginny, what's happened to you?" He shoved his hands
			nervously through his hair and peered at her. "We were going to get
			married."</p>
		<p>"No. We were not. And that has nothing to do with Kara," she said.</p>
		<p>"Please tell me you're not involved with her," he whispered. "Please?"</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at him, refusing to look away. "We're . . . more than friends,
			yes," she admitted. "And that has nothing to do with you."</p>
		<p>"Jesus," he muttered. "I can't believe this." He turned his back on her and
			Ginny was tempted to go to him, to comfort him, but he shrugged her hand away.
			"Was I that bad in bed? Jesus, you had to replace me with a fucking woman?" he
			yelled.</p>
		<p>"Phil, this has nothing to do with you. It just . . . happened."</p>
		<p>"But you're not a . . . a goddamned lesbian," he whispered. </p>
		<p>"If what I feel for her makes me a lesbian, then yes, I guess I am." She took
			his arm and this time he didn't pull away. "I don't expect you to understand,
			Phil. I don't understand it myself."</p>
		<p>"That's why you cried last night?"</p>
		<p>She nodded and shoved her hands in her pockets. "I wasn't ready to accept
			this, I guess. I didn't know for sure that I could be in a . . . a lesbian
			relationship like this. But she's what I want." </p>
		<p>"So, it's over? Just like that?" he asked, his tone hurt again. "Because some
			dyke came on to you?"</p>
		<p>"Stop calling her that," she said sharply. Then her voice softened. "Don't
			you see? This has nothing to do with you. I tried, Phil. That's why I let you
			come up here. But it's me. Something was missing with us. That's why I ran. I
			just didn't know what it was."</p>
		<p>"And you can't know now," he insisted.</p>
		<p>"Phil, she's not the first woman I've been . . . attracted to. It was before
			I met you and nothing happened. I couldn't allow anything to happen. But . . .
			with Kara . . .." She clutched at her heart and closed her eyes. "This is who I
			am. I'm so sorry."</p>
		<p>"You're sorry? That's all you can say? What the hell is Nana going to
			say?"</p>
		<p>"She doesn't know. And I'm not ready to tell her."</p>
		<p>"Well, maybe I should. Maybe she could talk some sense into you."</p>
		<p>"Phil, please don't be this way. It's not you. It's me."</p>
		<p>"I think you're sick," he said bitterly. "This whole thing is sick."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry you feel that way then." She faced him squarely and didn't flinch
			from the anger in his eyes. "I'll tell Nana you're leaving in the morning."</p>
		<p>She walked inside, slamming the door behind her. Why did she tell him? Did
			she honestly expect him to understand?</p>
		<p>She got her pillow and tossed it on the sofa, unmindful of Nana watching.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"What?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing. Everything." </p>
		<p>"Ginny?" </p>
		<p>"Nana, I don't want to talk now."</p>
		<p>"Where's Phil?"</p>
		<p>"Outside, I suppose," she said curtly.</p>
		<p>"You've had a fight? Ginny, you just got engaged," Nana said innocently. </p>
		<p>"Nana, I'm not engaged. I'm not getting married."</p>
		<p>"But, Phil . . .."</p>
		<p>"Phil is leaving tomorrow," Ginny said between clinched teeth.</p>
		<p>"Leaving? I don't understand," she said. Nana sat on the sofa beside Ginny
			and took her hand. "What is it, child?"</p>
		<p>"Nana, I'm not . . . I just . . . I don't want to marry Phil. Let's just
			leave it at that." </p>
		<p>"But he loves you."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled gently and kissed Nana's hand.</p>
		<p>"But I don't love him."</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-One">
		<p>"Kara! Open up, please," Ginny yelled through the door. She walked around to
			the porch, but the door was locked, the inside dark. Where could she be? She
			leaned her back against the wall, tucking her hair behind her ears nervously.
			Where is she? She had been calling all morning, but she had just assumed that
			Kara was just not answering. Finally, she could stand it no more and she left
			Nana at the store with a mumbled excuse.</p>
		<p>"Kara!" she yelled. Damn it all!</p>
		<p>She waited nearly thirty minutes, pacing back and forth, before giving up and
			driving home. Nana was in the kitchen but she didn't come out. Nana wasn't
			speaking to her today. Because of Phil. Ginny had tried to explain, after Phil
			had left, but Nana would have none of it. She just didn't understand how she
			could let a good man go. </p>
		<p>She walked to the phone and punched out the Dobson's number, counting ten
			rings before she hung up. Where was she? Was she all right?</p>
		<p>They ate their dinner in silence until Ginny couldn't stand it another
			second. </p>
		<p>"Nana, how long are you going to be this way?"</p>
		<p>"What way?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"I'm not in the mood, Nana. I've had a very bad day," she said wearily. "Why
			won't you talk to me?"</p>
		<p>"It's your own fault you've had a bad day, sending that poor man away like
			that," she said.</p>
		<p>"Would you have me marry him, knowing that I don't love him?"</p>
		<p>"But he loves you," Nana insisted, as if that was enough.</p>
		<p>"But what about me? Don't I count?"</p>
		<p>"You're nearly thirty," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Twenty-eight," she corrected. "And so what?" She leaned forward. "I don't
			need a man, Nana," she said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, pooh. Everyone needs a man."</p>
		<p>"For what?" Ginny challenged. "I've got a job. I can support myself."</p>
		<p>"Babies," Nana countered.</p>
		<p>"I don't think I want babies," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Ginny! Of course you do. I want to be a great-grandmother," she said.</p>
		<p>"You already are." </p>
		<p>"As if I've ever seen Becky's kids."</p>
		<p>Ginny shrugged, certainly not wanting to bring her sister into the
			conversation. She didn't want to completely ruin her day.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, what's been wrong? If I didn't know better, I'd say you changed when
			you met Kara, but that would hardly be fair to her."</p>
		<p>"Nana," Ginny said seriously. "I can't tell you what's wrong. You would never
			understand."</p>
		<p>Nana opened her mouth to speak, but Ginny held up her hands. "Enough. Let's
			call a truce."</p>
		<p>When Nana took her book into the living room, Ginny sat nervously in the
			kitchen, her hand reaching for the phone. She was actually startled to hear a
			voice on the other end.</p>
		<p>"What?" Kara asked briskly.</p>
		<p>"Where have you been?" Ginny demanded.</p>
		<p>"Out."</p>
		<p>"Out where? I've been calling you all day, I came by. Kara, are you okay?"
			Ginny asked quietly.</p>
		<p>"No. But don't worry about it. I'll get over it."</p>
		<p>"I'm coming over," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"No. I don't want to see you," Kara said. </p>
		<p>"Tough! I want to see you," Ginny replied. "I need to see you."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't do this to me. Let's just leave it alone."</p>
		<p>"We've got to talk," Ginny insisted quietly. </p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk."</p>
		<p>"I'm coming over."</p>
		<p>"I won't answer the door," Kara warned.</p>
		<p>"The hell you won't!"</p>
		<p>Ginny hung up on Kara's expletive and walked to her room, quickly exchanging
			sweatpants for jeans.</p>
		<p>"Who was that on the phone?" Nana called hopefully. "Phil?"</p>
		<p>"Kara." Ginny walked back out, keys dangling in her hands. "I'm going over
			there for a minute," she said.</p>
		<p>"This late? Whatever for?" Nana asked, puzzled.</p>
		<p>"I need to talk. I won't be long."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Ginny found Kara on the back porch, smoking. She walked to her chair and
			squatted down beside her.</p>
		<p>"Your fifth?" she asked lightly.</p>
		<p>"I haven't stopped at five since the day I met you," Kara said.</p>
		<p>Ginny took the cigarette from her fingers and stubbed it out, her eyebrows
			raised at the sight of the overflowing ashtray. "Well, we'll have to work on
			that, won't we."</p>
		<p>"Why are you here?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"Why do you think?" Ginny took Kara's hand between her own and rubbed it
			lightly. "I never meant for you to get hurt. I just wanted to see you, to be
			with you, regardless that Phil was there, too." Her voice lowered. "It was you I
			wanted to be with."</p>
		<p>"But you slept with him." Kara finally raised wounded eyes to Ginny. "Didn't
			you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. I did. And it was a very . . . big mistake," she said softly. "He
			wasn't you. He couldn't make me feel the way that you do, Kara. But I had to
			know," she whispered. "I had to know if what I feel with you is real or if I was
			just running from him." Ginny reached out and touched Kara's face, her hand
			pushing lightly against her clinched jaw. "Please understand, Kara."</p>
		<p>"I do. I know this is new for you, this thing between us. But, when Louise
			dropped the bombshell . . . the scent of you was still fresh on my fingers," she
			whispered. </p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry. I had no idea that was coming." Ginny lowered her eyes, then
			brought them back to Kara when she felt tears forming there. "The night before,
			he tried to touch me again, I asked him to stop, but . . . he wouldn't. He . .
			.." She let her tears fall as she remembered how she'd laid there as he took
			her. She should have stopped him. She should have fought him. But she didn't.
			She just laid there while he took her.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?" Kara whispered, her eyes too brimming with tears.</p>
		<p>"I was crying and he didn't understand. But I couldn't tell him. Not then. I
			slept on the couch. I think maybe he felt that he was losing me so he used Nana
			against me. He knows how much she wants us to get married."</p>
		<p>"He raped you?" Kara asked, her voice thick with emotion.</p>
		<p>"It wasn't exactly rape, Kara. But it wasn't consensual." Ginny reached out a
			hand and gently caressed Kara's face, feeling the dampness of tears there. "I'm
			so sorry. I'll understand if you don't want anything more to do with me."</p>
		<p>Kara squeezed her eyes shut, wishing she didn't feel so strongly about her.
			Wishing she hadn't fallen in love with her. And wishing she didn't hurt so.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, I came up here, not looking for anything but to sketch and paint. But
			when I met you, when I got to know you . . . I . . .." She let her thought go
			unfinished. How could she tell this woman, this woman she'd known only two
			months, that she'd fallen in love with her? "I don't want to just walk away from
			this. But you, this is so new for you, so different. I don't expect you to just
			abandon the life that you know and assume that this is what you want. There's so
			much out there for you. So many opportunities."</p>
		<p>"So many other women, you mean?"</p>
		<p>When Kara didn't answer, Ginny stood and tugged on Kara's hand.</p>
		<p>"Let's go inside. I want to lay with you . . . and I want to hold you," she
			said softly. "We'll talk later," she promised.</p>
		<p>They undressed slowly, touching each other only with their eyes, and Kara
			lifted the covers, pulling Ginny into her arms. They held each other, arms
			stroking soothingly, calmly.</p>
		<p>"What did you tell him?" Kara finally asked, her words spoken softly, slowly.
		</p>
		<p>"I told him that I wasn't in love with him and that I would never marry him,"
			Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"And Louise?"</p>
		<p>"Nana doesn't understand. She's still angry with me for sending him away,"
			she said as her hand rubbed slow circles on Kara's waist. "I wanted to tell her
			about you but I just couldn't."</p>
		<p>"No. I don't blame you for that. She would hate me."</p>
		<p>"Yes. I think she would," she admitted. Nana would blame Kara for Phil
			leaving. She would never understand how Ginny could find her magic with another
			woman.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .." Kara ran her fingers through Ginny's soft hair, brushing it
			back from her face. "Tell me what you want from me," she whispered.</p>
		<p>"I'm not sure," Ginny admitted. "Like you said, this is new for me. I know
			that no one has ever made me feel this way, made me want like this. I know that,
			Kara. When I'm with you, like this, nothing else matters."</p>
		<p>Kara moved her hands over Ginny's breasts, feeling the nipples harden at her
			touch.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled and closed her eyes at the now familiar touch. How was it that
			in such a short time, she could know, without a doubt, that this touch was what
			she'd craved all her life? The soft, gentle touch of this woman? The only time
			she'd ever felt complete in her entire life was when this woman touched her,
			made love to her. She moved, rolling onto her side and fitting her body next to
			Kara's, breasts on breasts, stomach, hips and thighs molding together. Finally,
			mouths met, gently, quietly, then with more hunger. </p>
		<p>Kara wondered if it was enough, this fire that burned between them. And for
			how long? Kara wondered when Ginny would tire of her lovemaking, when would she
			go looking for someone else, someone else she could compare this to. Kara had
			had many lovers over the years, but none had stirred her soul quite the way that
			Ginny had. </p>
		<p>But what about Ginny? There was a whole new world of opportunity out there
			for her. Maybe not here, but certainly in Seattle, where the lesbian community
			was thriving. She could meet any number of women, make new friends, begin
			relationships. </p>
		<p>That's what really bothered her. She had fallen in love with this woman, she
			wanted to be with her; she wanted a relationship with her. And that scared her
			more than she wanted to admit. She'd had only one in her life. Marsha. And she
			thought, at the time that it ended, that she would never again share her life so
			completely with anyone. But here she was, wanting Ginny that way. Wanting to
			wake up with her each morning, wanting to share in her life, be a part of it. Be
			a big part.</p>
		<p>Ginny probably had not even looked past the sex to think about what her
			future would hold. She was young. She had plenty of time to play the field, to
			sample the water, to experiment. And she would meet someone with her same
			interests, someone who she could think about building a future with and then
			maybe she would choose to tell Louise, who might join in her happiness
			eventually.</p>
		<p>"What are you thinking?" Ginny whispered as Kara's mouth stilled.</p>
		<p>Kara looked into her eyes, searching for answers, but finding only desire,
			desire for her. Her expression softened and she drew Ginny close, touching her
			lips again.</p>
		<p>"Just thinking," she murmured against her lips. </p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. "Don't think so much, then." She pushed Kara back boldly,
			fitting her body on top of hers. "Let me make love to you. You still want that,
			don't you?"</p>
		<p>Doesn't she know? Can't she see how it is with me? Kara clasped her face
			between her hands. "I want that very much."</p>
		<p>She closed her eyes as Ginny's lips moved softly across her face, covering
			each eye in turn, nipping gently at her neck, whispering into her ear and Kara
			lost herself completely under those softly demanding lips.</p>
		<p>She felt Ginny's soft hair spray out across her breasts and she put her hands
			there, her fingers combing it away from Ginny's face.</p>
		<p>Ginny's mouth covered her breast and Kara was conscious of how very slowly
			Ginny was loving her tonight. There was no urgency in her touch, only the sweet
			certainty that she knew how to touch Kara and she knew what Kara wanted. Oh, and
			she did. Kara's body responded to her gentle touches, moving against her hands,
			pressing into her hips. </p>
		<p>Ginny's mouth came back to hers, tracing Kara's lips with her tongue, boldly
			sucking her lower lip into her mouth. Kara moaned, taking Ginny's tongue inside,
			sucking her in deeper. </p>
		<p>"I can't get enough of you," Ginny whispered against her mouth. "I can't get
			close enough." She pressed her body to Kara's, their breasts smashed together,
			hips joined.</p>
		<p>Kara's hands molded Ginny to her, caressing her rounded hips, squeezing her
			softness. "Come inside me," Kara urged.</p>
		<p>Ginny's hand moved between their joined bodies and her breath stilled when
			she touched her. So wet. Her fingers pushed through, letting Kara surround them
			with her warmth. She moved deeper into her, pulling out, then back in again,
			harder this time, moving her hips against her hand, against Kara. </p>
		<p>"Yes, like that," Kara whispered. </p>
		<p>Ginny's body shuddered as her hips rocked against Kara, her fingers moving
			deep inside her, touching her core. She had never felt such intimacy, such a
			joining of souls before. Their breath mingled and joined, as their bodies did
			and Ginny covered Kara's mouth, taking her release into her mouth as Kara cried
			out, holding Ginny's fingers deep inside her.</p>
		<p>Kara's hands trembled as she touched Ginny's face, wiping the perspiration
			from her brow. She was so certain of her love for this woman that she nearly
			cried, knowing that she could not have her. Not yet.</p>
		<p>"Kara," Ginny whispered, words of love crowding her brain, but she couldn't
			find the courage to speak any of them, to utter them out loud. She was still
			afraid. She was afraid that Kara would not want to hear them. She was afraid
			that all Kara wanted between them was this, this wonderful lovemaking that they
			shared.</p>
		<p>Their eyes met as they both struggled with their feelings. Kara shielded
			hers, afraid Ginny would see too much. </p>
		<p>"Let me love you," Kara whispered.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>Kara kissed her tenderly, lightly brushing her lips. "Lay back," she urged
			and Ginny moved over, her head touching the pillow, waiting for Kara's mouth to
			return to hers.</p>
		<p>Kara's kiss turned passionate; hot and demanding when Ginny took her tongue
			inside. Her knee pressed between Ginny's leg and she knelt between her parted
			legs, her mouth going to her breasts; her nipples hard and erect and she took
			one into her mouth, sucking the tip inside, drawing Ginny into her.</p>
		<p>She wanted to wait. She wanted to go slow, to love Ginny with the same
			tenderness that Ginny had shown her. But she lost her resolve when her hand
			touched Ginny, when her fingers brushed her. She wanted her mouth there, always.
		</p>
		<p>She slid between Ginny's legs, her hands pushing her thighs apart and Kara
			lowered her mouth to her, sighing contentedly when her tongue moved through her
			wetness. Ginny surged up to meet her and Kara buried her face in her, her cheeks
			coated with her wetness. She felt Ginny's legs wrap around her shoulders and she
			took her into her mouth, sucking hard, pushing against her with a desire so
			strong it shook her to her very core. </p>
		<p>"God, Kara," Ginny murmured, stroking her head, pushing her face closer
			against her. "Yes..."</p>
		<p>Ginny's hips moved against Kara's face, her thighs opening wider, wanting
			Kara inside her. Oh Lord, but what this woman did to her. If their lovemaking
			lasted a lifetime, she would never tire of this. She knew no one could ever make
			her feel this way.</p>
		<p>Kara's tongue moved over her, then deep inside her. She listened to Ginny's
			sharp breathing, felt her hands clutch her face, felt her pleasure. When Ginny's
			hips arched and stilled, Kara was not nearly ready for this to end. She brought
			her fingers to Ginny, joining her mouth and Ginny cried out her name, pressing
			Kara hard against her and her spasms shook Kara like never before. She took her
			into her mouth and felt her throb against her tongue, then let herself be pulled
			from her, to be enfolded in soft arms.</p>
		<p>"Dear God, but you drive me crazy when you do that," Ginny said into her
			ear.</p>
		<p>Yes. It nearly drove her crazy to have her mouth there, to feel Ginny pulse
			against her tongue. But what if? What if there were any number of women out
			there who could give Ginny as much pleasure? Kara had never thought of herself
			as an exceptional lover before. But with Ginny, she was different. She wanted to
			please her. She didn't care about herself. She wanted Ginny to find the
			fulfillment that she had never had before. </p>
		<p>"Kara?" </p>
		<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
		<p>"What's wrong?" Ginny asked gently. "Your eyes . . . you look sad."</p>
		<p>Kara buried her head in Ginny's neck, smelling the light perfume she had
			sprayed that morning. "Nothing," she murmured. </p>
		<p>Ginny lifted Kara's head and searched her eyes, trying to read them. What was
			it? Was it Phil? Was it something else? Was she not satisfied with Ginny? Did
			she need more?</p>
		<p>"Kara, what do you feel when I make love to you?" </p>
		<p>"What do you mean?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"I mean . . . is it good enough? Do I satisfy you?" she asked softly.</p>
		<p>Kara smiled and drew Ginny to her lips. "You are a beautiful lover. The best.
			Haven't I told you that?"</p>
		<p>Had she told Marsha that, too? Did she tell all her lovers that? Was Ginny
			just one more in a line of many? She was consumed with jealousy at the thought
			of other women loving Kara, touching her the way that Ginny did. Had they fallen
			in love with her, too? Ginny kissed her possessively, knowing she was trying to
			make Kara forget all her other lovers, all those that had come before her. Could
			she chase them from her mind? </p>
		<p>"What?" Kara asked. </p>
		<p>"I haven't had nearly enough," Ginny said and she pushed Kara back, taking
			her breast, trying to possess her.</p>
		<p>"You haven't?" Kara asked with a chuckle. </p>
		<p>"Not nearly," Ginny murmured against her breast before she moved lower,
			needing to love Kara with her mouth, needing to show her how much she needed
			her.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Two">
		<p>It was nearly dawn when she got home, exhausted. They had not slept. She
			hadn't wanted to. When Kara had finally fallen asleep, Ginny left her, brushing
			her cheek lightly with her lips, whispering words of love to her sleeping form.
		</p>
		<p>She had not been able to tell her, of course. She had been afraid of Kara's
			response. Kara, who had had many lovers, had probably heard the words many times
			before. What would her reaction be? Would she be amused? </p>
		<p>Ginny showered, hearing Nana in the kitchen and she thought of Nana's
			reaction, should she guess that Ginny had fallen in love with a woman. She would
			be devastated. Nana could never understand.</p>
		<p>"When did you finally get home?" Nana asked as she handed a cup of coffee
			from the espresso machine.</p>
		<p>"Late."</p>
		<p>"Must have been. You look tired," she said, watching her.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, sipping from her coffee. </p>
		<p>"Phil called," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny let out her breath slowly, wondering what in the world he could have to
			say. "And?"</p>
		<p>"Ginny, I just don't understand you. The man is heartbroken," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Nana, please," Ginny said, shaking her head.</p>
		<p>"Maybe you were hasty, Ginny. Maybe you need to think about this," she
			said.</p>
		<p>"I've thought about it for the last nine months, Nana."</p>
		<p>"But what will you do? Living out here with me," she said, motioning to the
			windows. "I won't be around for ever. Then what? What will you have? No husband,
			no babies," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny thought Nana was near tears and she went to her and hugged her. "Nana,
			please don't worry about me. I know you just want me to be happy. But, right
			now, this is what I want."</p>
		<p>Nana let out a great sigh. "I don't understand women today," she said. "Kara,
			for instance. Thirty-four and alone. Why must you be so independent? There's
			nothing wrong with having a man to take care of you," she said. </p>
		<p>"I'm not going to get married just to have someone take care of me, Nana. I
			can do that myself," she said gently.</p>
		<p>"I'm worst than a mother, aren't I?"</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. "I wouldn't know," she said.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't mean . . .."</p>
		<p>"Nana, I've always felt closer to you than to her. You know that."</p>
		<p>Nana touched her cheek and smiled. "I'm sorry, child. I'll leave you alone
			about Phil. You know what's best," she said. </p>
		<p>"Thank you."</p>
		<p></p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Kara packed her few things, shoving them blindly into her bag. She didn't
			have much. Most of her clothes were still at the cottage. She had already loaded
			her paintings, packing them carefully in the back of the Land Cruiser.</p>
		<p>Going to see Ginny was going to be the hardest thing she had ever done. But
			she must, she told herself. She couldn't stay here for the next few months and
			continue this affair with Ginny as if they had a future together. She had to
			give Ginny some time. Some time to discover herself. Some time to adjust to her
			new life and to figure out what she wanted from it. To figure out if this was
			what she wanted. </p>
		<p>But she was hurting. She couldn't deny that. She had fallen so deeply in love
			with Ginny that she felt as if she were cutting out her own heart by leaving.
			But better now, then two months down the road, when Ginny came to her senses and
			realized that Kara wasn't the only woman out there.</p>
		<p>And maybe later, after they had both had some time, Ginny might decide that
			Kara could make her happy in the long run. She might want to have a future with
			Kara. Kara closed her eyes, envisioning living out here with Ginny, waking up
			with her every morning, building a life together. Then she slowly shook her
			head. Did she really believe that would happen?</p>
		<p>Ginny was only twenty-eight. She would meet someone younger, someone with her
			own interests, someone to make her forget about Kara and her summer of
			discovery.</p>
		<p>Leave now and save face, she thought, shoving her clothes hastily into her
			bag. In a few hours, she would be safely back at the cottage, away from Ginny.
			She would have time to mend, time to heal her broken heart. Marsha's leaving
			couldn't even compare to the pain she was feeling now, she knew. Marsha, who she
			had spent six years with, had left her so quietly that Kara hadn't even known
			she was gone.</p>
		<p>But Ginny, she thought. Ginny would rip her heart out without even knowing
			it.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Ginny looked up as the bell jingled, like she always did. She smiled,
			surprised to see Kara at the store. But her smile faded when she saw the sadness
			in Kara's blue eyes. She went to her, unmindful of Nana watching.</p>
		<p>"What is it?" she asked, stopping a mere foot in front of her.</p>
		<p>"I'm . . . leaving," Kara said. "For awhile."</p>
		<p>"Leaving?"</p>
		<p>"Hello, Kara," Nana said, walking up to them.</p>
		<p>Kara pulled her eyes away from Ginny and forced a smile to her face. "Hello,
			Louise. I came to say goodbye," she said.</p>
		<p>"Goodbye?"</p>
		<p>"I'm going to Seattle. I don't know how long I'll be gone," she said. "So I
			wanted to stop by."</p>
		<p>"Well, we'll still be here when you get back," Nana said lightly, ignorant to
			the tension between the two women.</p>
		<p>Kara turned back to Ginny, her heart splitting in two at the look in her
			green eyes. "Can we talk?" </p>
		<p>Ginny nodded numbly. "I'll be right back," she said to Nana.</p>
		<p>Ginny followed Kara outside, her eyes taking in her packed truck. "Kara?" She
			turned frightened eyes to her. "What are you doing?"</p>
		<p>"Ginny, I've got to get back," she said quietly. "I've got . . . some
			business to take care of," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny studied her eyes. "You're running away," she said, knowing it was
			true.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Why? Tell me." </p>
		<p>"Ginny." Kara reached out a hand to Ginny, then dropped it to her side. </p>
		<p>"Why are you leaving me?" Ginny whispered. "Was it that bad for you?"</p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't," Kara said. She placed her hands on Ginny's shoulders and made
			her look at her. "This thing between us . . . you need some time. I need to give
			you time."</p>
		<p>"I'm in love with you," Ginny blurted out.</p>
		<p>"Please don't say that," Kara groaned. She dropped her hands, her heart
			beating painfully in her chest. "You don't know what's out there," she said.
			"This is all new for you. Don't assume you love me, just because I'm the one
			that made you realize your alternatives."</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at her, hearing her words, knowing what Kara was doing. "You're
			afraid," Ginny said. "You're afraid of what I feel for you."</p>
		<p>It was Kara's turn to stare. "Don't settle for me," she said gently. </p>
		<p>"Oh, I see," Ginny said. "I need to sleep around first. See what's out there?
			See if I just imagined all this?"</p>
		<p>Kara nodded weakly.</p>
		<p>"Get a little more experience?" Ginny laughed. "Do I need to practice?"</p>
		<p>"Ginny, you know that's not what I mean," Kara said. </p>
		<p>"Isn't it? I could tell last night, I guess. You were so far away," she
			whispered. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, no. That's not it. Surely you know . . .."</p>
		<p>"I'm a beautiful lover. Yeah, right," she said bitterly. </p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .."</p>
		<p>"Why didn't you tell me before? Why did you make me think that is was good
			for you, too?"</p>
		<p>"Ginny, listen to me," Kara said, gripping her shoulders again. Oh, God, this
			isn't what she wanted Ginny to think. This wasn't how she envisioned their
			parting. "I care about you. I . . . care about you very much," she said again.
			"I don't want you to hurt me," she whispered, her voice cracking with
			emotion.</p>
		<p>"Hurt you?" Ginny asked, amazed. "How could I hurt you?" </p>
		<p>"I just want you to be sure," Kara said. "Before we go too far."</p>
		<p>"So you're going to leave me? That's how you want me to be sure?"</p>
		<p>"I have to. For me as much as for you," she said.</p>
		<p>"It won't change anything," Ginny said. "I know how I feel." She looked up
			into Kara's eyes. "I'm in love with you. Don't leave me," she whispered and she
			felt tears gather in her eyes. "Please?"</p>
		<p>Kara swallowed hard, hating herself for what she was doing. "Take care of
			yourself," Kara said and she touched Ginny's face gently.</p>
		<p>"Do you love me, too, Kara?" Ginny asked softly. "Is that why you're running
			away?"</p>
		<p>Kara's jaw clinched from the ache in her heart and she pulled her eyes from
			Ginny's. She walked to her truck and slammed the door and sped away. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Three">
		<p>Kara opened the windows to the breeze, surprisingly happy to be back at the
			cottage. She took a cigarette and walked to the water, her eyes feasting on the
			blue expanse of Puget Sound, sail boats competing with the much larger vessels
			of the sea.</p>
		<p>She strolled the shore, watching sea gulls flying over, trying to clear her
			head. She had made the right decision, she knew. And it felt good to be back
			home, around her familiar surroundings. Away from Ginny. Maybe she would be able
			to work here. For the last week, she had not been able to pick up a brush. Her
			heart and mind had been elsewhere.</p>
		<p>She breathed deeply, savoring the smell of the sea and she closed her eyes,
			letting the wind soothe her, the sound of the water relax her. And it did. For
			the last two hours, she had thought of little else, other than the words Ginny
			had spoken to her. "I'm in love with you." Kara shut her mind to Ginny's
			whispered words. She didn't want to remember the pain in Ginny's eyes when Kara
			had left her.</p>
		<p>She turned her back to the wind and cupped her cigarette, lighting it with
			practiced ease. She had forgotten about her daily count and had bought an entire
			carton when she had stopped at the grocery store on her way home. Bad habits die
			hard, she thought as she climbed the hill back to her cottage.</p>
		<p>She was actually able to work, and for the first time in her life, the brush
			flew over the canvas without the accompanying sketch to guide her. She painted
			from memory. She painted from the heart. </p>
		<p>The giant tree loomed over the forest, beckoning the visitor into the woods
			for a closer look. The sun was gone, leaving only a faint glow in the sky, but
			the moon was out, shining ghostly upon the forest. Kara brought the trees to
			life in the moonlight. And the giant monster in the middle held the secret. Upon
			its old, crusty bark, she painted the shadows of two lovers, embracing. Two
			lovers locked in each other's arms.</p>
		<p>She worked day and night, stopping only occasionally to nap and when she
			remembered, to eat. </p>
		<p>It was to be hers to keep. She would not share it with anyone. It was much
			too personal for that. But, oh, it pained her to remember the need Ginny had for
			her that night. So much need that Ginny had not cared that Phil was coming along
			the path, looking for them. She had not cared that he might catch them. "Don't
			stop," she had pleaded with Kara. And Kara couldn't. She, too, ignored the sound
			of Phil's voice. She only wanted to give what Ginny had needed.</p>
		<p>She dropped her arms to her sides, exhausted. She stared at the shadow
			figures, remembering. And she cried.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Four">
		<p>It was Sunday, nearly noon, but Ginny couldn't bring herself to get out of
			bed. For the last two weeks, she had put on a brave front, appearing cheerful in
			front of Nana, eating meals with a vigor she did not feel and participating in
			meaningless conversations when her mind was elsewhere. Elsewhere! She laughed.
			Her mind wasn't elsewhere. It was on Kara. It had been since the moment she had
			walked out of her life. Each day, she went to the store, waiting for the phone
			to ring. Each time the bell jingled, she looked up, hoping to find Kara standing
			in the doorway. Finally, yesterday, she had given up. Kara wasn't coming back.
			Kara didn't want her in her life. Kara didn't need her. </p>
		<p>And so she had stayed in bed. Hiding. She could not put on a brave front any
			longer. She had told Nana she wasn't feeling well, which, of course, was the
			truth and Nana had brought her soup to eat, which still stood on the nightstand
			beside her. She couldn't force down another meal. She was certain that she would
			never eat again. </p>
		<p>She rolled over, wishing for the pain in her heart to go away. Never in her
			life had she felt so alone. The pain of her childhood could not even compare.
			She loved Kara. Of that, at least, she was certain. But why had Kara run? What
			was she afraid of? Was Ginny's need of her too much? Had she felt smothered?
			Ginny's first thought was her inexperience in bed, but she knew that wasn't the
			reason. Their lovemaking had been too passionate, to intense for her to have
			imagined it. Kara had enjoyed it as much as Ginny had. There was another reason
			for her leaving.</p>
		<p>The knock on her door cut short her thoughts and she called for Nana to come
			in. </p>
		<p>"How are you feeling?"</p>
		<p>"Better," Ginny lied.</p>
		<p>"Good. I was worried about you. You're never sick," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny turned away, her eyes looking out the window, seeing nothing. She was
			on the verge of tears and she didn't want Nana to see. She would never be able
			to explain tears. She had never cried in front of Nana.</p>
		<p>"You didn't eat your soup, Ginny," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"I didn't think I could keep it down," she said. "But I'm better now."</p>
		<p>"Let me heat it for you," Nana said with relief. </p>
		<p>"Okay. I'll get up now, I think," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana smiled and left her and Ginny made herself rise, tossing off the
			protective covers. Staying in bed, hiding, would not solve anything.</p>
		<p>Later that week, as Ginny choked down another meal, she knew what she had to
			do. She had to find Kara. She had to know the reason she left. She could deal
			with the truth. But not knowing was slowly driving her crazy. </p>
		<p>"Nana, things will slow down in a few weeks, once the season winds down. If I
			left for a couple of days, would you and Jessica be okay?"</p>
		<p>"Of course, Ginny. Where are you going?"</p>
		<p>"To Seattle," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana's face broke into a smile. "I knew it. Your forced cheerfulness these
			last few weeks couldn't fool me." She beamed at Ginny. "You're going to Phil,
			aren't you?"</p>
		<p>Phil. Always Phil, Ginny thought. "I'm just going to Seattle," Ginny said
			tiredly. "Not necessarily to see Phil."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I know you've been miserable since he left," Nana continued. "Of course
			we can handle the store. You stay gone as long as you need. Oh, Ginny, I'm so
			glad you're going . . .."</p>
		<p>Ginny left her protest unspoken as Nana rambled on and on about Phil. She
			simply stopped listening. She was more concerned about how she was going to find
			Kara in a city the size of Seattle.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Five">
		<p>"Oh, Kara, it's gorgeous. They're all fabulous." She smiled at her. "As
			always," she added. Stephanie sorted through the paintings, her eyes drawn again
			to the giant tree and Kara instantly regretted her decision to sell it. It was
			too personal. She didn't want a stranger peering at it, imagining who the lovers
			were, imagining it was themselves in that embrace.</p>
		<p>But it had become too painful for even Kara to look at. </p>
		<p>"I'll have them displayed within the week," Stephanie said. "This one is
			intriguing," she said, her hands touching Kara's painting. "It's different from
			what you normally do." She looked up and smiled. "I may want to keep this one.
			Just display it for awhile." She stared at Kara. "By the way, what are you doing
			back in town?"</p>
		<p>"Recuperating," Kara said easily. </p>
		<p>"Oh?" Stephanie asked with interest.</p>
		<p>"I was out in the woods for a month or so," she said. "I've only been back
			five weeks." Five weeks and two days, her mind counted, since she'd seen
			Ginny.</p>
		<p>"You're getting too old for that. Time for you to settle," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara smiled, taking one last look at the giant tree, at the shadows on its
			bark. She wanted to settle. She wanted to settle in a little town called
			Chiwaukum, with a green-eyed blond who had stolen her heart and soul.</p>
		<p>"I've got to go," she said quietly. </p>
		<p>"I'll be in touch," Stephanie called after her.</p>
		<p>Kara drove to the nearest liquor store, bypassing her usual wine for a bottle
			of scotch. Once home, she poured a generous amount and walked to the shore,
			cigarette hanging comfortably between her fingers and she ignored the light mist
			falling. </p>
		<p>For the past five weeks, she had been making this trip to the water, looking
			for answers. She had wanted to call her, but she hadn't dared. She didn't want
			to bother her. She didn't want to stir up memories. And it was better this way,
			she told herself. Each day it got easier.</p>
		<p>She laughed bitterly. Who was she kidding? Certainly not herself. Each day
			was harder than the one before. Each day Ginny's memory came to her more
			clearly. Each night, Ginny's touch was heavier on her body.</p>
		<p>Maybe she should go out. Maybe she should call up an old friend and have
			dinner or something. Or something. The thought of being with someone else simply
			nauseated her. She wanted no one else. She wanted only Ginny.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Six">
		<p>Ginny took the ferry to Bainbridge Island, wondering frantically where she
			would start looking. The phone book had proved useless. Kara was not listed
			among the 'Morgans' and the operator had firmly told her it was an unlisted
			number. No amount of begging by Ginny had budged him.</p>
		<p>She was looking for a needle in a haystack, she realized as she drove down
			the highway, turning off on each side road that looked like it would take her to
			the water. She hadn't realized how many small towns dotted the island and Kara
			could live in any one of them. It was a fruitless trip, she knew, but she kept
			driving and searching. She had to find her.</p>
		<p>When darkness came, she turned around, heading back to the ferry and Seattle.
			She would have dinner, she thought, and maybe call up one of her old friends.
			They could sit around and talk about her miserable love life! She could just
			image the look on their faces should she confess that she had fallen in love
			with a woman.</p>
		<p>She could always walk to Capitol Hill, the unofficial gay neighborhood of
			Seattle. Maybe stroll down Broadway for an hour or so and have dinner at one of
			the restaurants there. In spite of her mood, that sounded much more appealing
			than room service and another night alone.</p>
		<p>She parked two blocks away, the foot traffic heavy on a Saturday night and
			she blended in with the crowd. She found herself staring at the two women
			walking in front of her, holding hands. They were young, early twenties, she
			thought, but still, they looked so comfortable with each other. She immediately
			thought of Kara and pictured them walking arm and arm like this. She tore her
			eyes away and looked at other faces, strangers in the crowd. She walked into the
			indoor mall, pushing through the milling shoppers. Coffee. Real Seattle coffee.
			She stood in line at the coffee bar, dying for a real latte after months of
			relying on her portable espresso machine.</p>
		<p>She took her coffee and stopped at the newspaper stand, the local gay paper
			catching her eye. She bought one, taking it to a table with her. </p>
		<p>It was all there. Bars, diners, bookstores and any other gay-oriented
			activity she could possibly want. To say she was surprised was an
			understatement. She just had no idea how large the gay community was in Seattle.
			She knew now that she had purposefully ignored that part of city before.</p>
		<p>She flipped through the pages, looking for women's bars. Perhaps Kara was
			right. Maybe she did need to explore her newfound sexuality. Maybe she was
			rushing things with Kara.</p>
		<p>Of course she wasn't, though. She knew how she felt about Kara. But it
			wouldn't hurt to look, she told herself. Kara obviously didn't want her. With
			that, she went back to her hotel to change and to mentally prepare herself for a
			night out on the town.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Seven">
		<p>Kara stood staring at the empty canvas, brush in hand, when the knocking on
			her door disrupted her thoughts. Who? No one knew she was back.</p>
		<p>Marsha. Kara's breath caught at the sight of her. She hadn't seen her in over
			a year. She was as beautiful as ever</p>
		<p>"My God, look at you," Marsha said and raised up on tiptoe to kiss her
			lips.</p>
		<p>Kara smiled, surprised at how glad she was to see her. "What in the world are
			you doing here?"</p>
		<p>"Can't I visit an old friend?" Marsha asked.</p>
		<p>Kara shut the door and followed Marsha inside, smelling the perfume that she
			remembered from long ago.</p>
		<p>"When Stephanie told me you were back, I said, no, it can't be. It's still
			summer. You should be out camping or something, looking for your colors," she
			said, with just a hint of bitterness in her voice.</p>
		<p>"I came back early," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"You never did that for me."</p>
		<p>Their eyes met and Kara smiled. "Did you come here to fight?"</p>
		<p>Marsha pulled out a cigarette and waited for Kara to light it. "No. I came to
			visit," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara poured them each a glass of scotch and shoved a cigarette between her
			own lips. "Let's go outside," she said.</p>
		<p>"I miss it here," Marsha said, when they settled on the deck.</p>
		<p>"Where's Robin?" Kara asked, surprised that she felt no anger.</p>
		<p>"Things didn't work out," Marsha said.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Marsha waved her apology aside. "It's ironic, really. She said I worked too
			much, that I was never around."</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "How long ago?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, it's been several months now." Marsha pulled on her cigarette, letting
			the smoke out slowly. "What about you?"</p>
		<p>"What about me?"</p>
		<p>"Anyone in your life?"</p>
		<p>Kara laughed again. "You know me. All work and no play."</p>
		<p>Marsha leaned forward, her index finger reaching out to touch Kara's hand.
			"Want to play now?" she asked wickedly.</p>
		<p>Kara met her eyes, knowing that beneath her teasing tones, she was very
			serious. </p>
		<p>"I've missed being with you," Marsha continued.</p>
		<p>Kara smiled, thinking that if she had come a few months ago, she might have
			been tempted. But she let Marsha kiss her. Her mouth parted and she actually
			hoped that she could still feel something for her. But she didn't. She pulled
			away, not looking at her and she brought her cigarette to her lips.</p>
		<p>Marsha leaned back and watched her. "So, who is she?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Who?"</p>
		<p>Marsha laughed. "I saw your paintings."</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And you forget. I watched you paint for six years. I've never seen that much
			passion in one painting before."</p>
		<p>Kara swallowed the last of her drink, but said nothing.</p>
		<p>"Are you in love with her? The woman in your painting?"</p>
		<p>"My, but you are perceptive," Kara said lightly.</p>
		<p>Marsha took her hand again. "Look at you. You're all tense." She squeezed her
			arm. "Why don't you tell me about it?"</p>
		<p>"You don't want to hear it, I'm sure," Kara said.</p>
		<p>Marsha shrugged. "What are friends for?"</p>
		<p>Kara smiled at her, liking her more now than she had in years. Kara held up
			her empty glass. "I'll need another for this story," she said.</p>
		<p>"I'll get it," Marsha said and came back with the bottle and their
			cigarettes. "Now, do tell."</p>
		<p>"Just like that?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. You've fallen in love. I want to know all about her," Marsha said.</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "She's straight."</p>
		<p>"Kara! Have you lost your mind?"</p>
		<p>"Maybe I should rephrase that. She was straight when I met her."</p>
		<p>"Why, you devil," Marsha teased. "Now I'm really interested."</p>
		<p>"I'm in over my head, Marsha," Kara said, taking out her cigarettes and
			lighting one. </p>
		<p>Marsha laughed. "This is so interesting. Kara Morgan in over her head!"
			Marsha grinned. "Tell me how it started."</p>
		<p>"She owns a little grocery store in Chiwaukum, in the Wenatchee Mountains,"
			Kara said. "I rented a cabin there for the summer."</p>
		<p>"She owns a grocery store? How old is she?"</p>
		<p>"Twenty-eight," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"A child," Marsha said and grinned. "I love it. Go on," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "We became friends. She told me about Phil, this guy in
			Seattle who wanted to marry her and I told her about women," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And we became more than friends," Kara said quietly, remembering. "And then
			Phil shows up, wanting to take her back to Seattle and that's a whole different
			story," Kara said. "Anyway, she sent him away."</p>
		<p>"Wait, wait," Marsha said. "I want to hear the part about Phil. I love it
			when men don't get their way."</p>
		<p>"I must have been insane," Kara said. "They invited me on a cookout, Louise
			and all," she said.</p>
		<p>"Who's Louise?"</p>
		<p>"Grandmother," Kara said. "Anyway, I shouldn't have gone. I mean, Phil was
			there, I knew they had probably slept together and I was crazy with jealousy.
			But I went. Ginny and I took a walk around sunset, to the Big Tree," she
			said.</p>
		<p>"Your painting?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. We're standing there, up against this tree . . .."</p>
		<p>"Making love?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. And Phil comes looking for us, but we don't stop. We couldn't. That's
			when I knew for certain that I loved her."</p>
		<p>"Jesus. Did he catch you?"</p>
		<p>"No. But when we got back, Louise announced that Phil and Ginny are getting
			married."</p>
		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"I know," she said. "I'm crazy." </p>
		<p>"But she sent him away?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. And I left."</p>
		<p>"Just like that?"</p>
		<p>"She said that she loved me," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"And you ran for your life?"</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "She's not straight, Marsha. She only thought she was." </p>
		<p>"Oh, Kara. Do I know you or what?"</p>
		<p>"Meaning?" </p>
		<p>"You're just protecting yourself, aren't you? In case she finds out there are
			other fish in the sea?"</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "Very good," she said, inhaling deeply on her cigarette.</p>
		<p>"Kara, you can be so stubborn sometimes. Don't you know what a good catch you
			are?"</p>
		<p>Kara laughed again. "You didn't think so."</p>
		<p>"I was selfish. I wanted more of you than you could give me."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Marsha shook her head. "So? When are you going back?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know that I am."</p>
		<p>"Why not?"</p>
		<p>"She just ended a five-year relationship with a man. A man who thought they
			were going to get married. And now she's discovered that . . .."</p>
		<p>"She's gay?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. There was a woman once, before Phil, that she was involved with. Well,
			not sexually, but they were headed that way and she ran from it. Now that she's
			accepted who she is, she's got her whole life in front of her."</p>
		<p>"And you're scared she won't choose you?"</p>
		<p>"Something like that," Kara murmured.</p>
		<p>"So you leave before she has a chance to tell you."</p>
		<p>"Something like that," she said again.</p>
		<p>"You haven't told her, have you?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"That you're in love with her." </p>
		<p>Kara shook her head. "No. And I doubt that I will."</p>
		<p>Marsha smiled and touched her glass to Kara's. "Here's to foolish women in
			love," she said lightly. "Foolish being the key word, Kara."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Eight">
		<p>Ginny walked into the bar, feeling that every eye in the room was on her.
			More women than she ever thought she'd see were crammed together in the loud and
			smoky club. She shoved her way to the bar and got a beer, then walked through
			the crowd, looking at faces, suddenly wondering what she would do if Kara was
			there. But of course, she wouldn't be. Ginny didn't think that bars were Kara's
			style. </p>
		<p>She had scarcely taken a drink from her beer when a pretty, young women,
			barely college age, asked her to dance. Ginny stared at her, shocked, then
			politely declined. For a moment, she had forgotten where she was and why. She
			was embarrassed and wanted to call the girl back, but she let her go. She wasn't
			interested in that woman in the least.</p>
		<p>She didn't decline her next offer, even though the woman was even more
			masculine that Phil. She was at least closer to Ginny's age. </p>
		<p>"I'm Mandy," the woman said.</p>
		<p>Mandy? This was no Mandy! "Ginny. Nice to meet you."</p>
		<p>The woman pulled her close and Ginny could smell bourbon on her breath and
			she turned her face away from her.</p>
		<p>"I haven't seen you around before," Mandy said.</p>
		<p>"I'm just visiting," Ginny explained.</p>
		<p>"I hope for awhile," Mandy said seductively.</p>
		<p>"Leaving in the morning, I'm afraid," Ginny lied. She felt the woman's large
			breasts press against her own and she wanted to pull away.</p>
		<p>"That's a shame. But the night's long," Mandy whispered in her ear.</p>
		<p>Not long enough to convince me to stay with you! "I'm actually waiting for
			someone," Ginny lied again. She prayed that the song would end.</p>
		<p>"Well, just my luck," Mandy said but she continued to hold Ginny close.</p>
		<p>Ginny suffered through the slow dance, escaping Mandy's arms as soon as the
			song ended and moved to the other side of the room, away from Mandy.</p>
		<p>She made herself stay until midnight, enduring countless dances with
			strangers, none of whom stirred even the slightest desire in her. None of them
			could compare to Kara, not that she thought any of them ever would.</p>
		<p>Back at her hotel, she lay on her bed, fully clothed, feeling even more
			depressed than before. Kara, where are you? I need you.</p>
		<p>She closed her eyes and let silent tears fall, feeling her heart breaking all
			over again. How could she love someone so much, finally, and they just leave
			her? Leave with a half-assed excuse that it was for her own good? It made no
			sense. </p>
		<p>And it wasn't fair. She had been looking for so long. Looking for that magic,
			that burning desire. And she had finally found it with Kara. And now she was
			gone from her life as quickly as she had come into it.</p>
		<p>She awoke during the night and undressed, crawling beneath the covers
			finally. But she couldn't sleep any more. She tossed and turned, her thoughts
			jumbled with memories of Kara. Kara's lips coming to her; Kara's hands cupping
			her breasts. Kara's mouth settling over her, taking her to heights she had only
			dreamed of. Kara. Kara's face. Kara's eyes. Kara.</p>
		<p>She got up. Angry. </p>
		<p>"Damn her," she whispered to her empty room. She had to stop. She couldn't go
			on like this. It was slowly driving her insane, this desire, this need she had
			for Kara.</p>
		<p>"Well, she doesn't want you. She doesn't love you."</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed bitterly. And what could she possibly offer Kara anyway?
			Friendship? Yes, they were friends. But she was sure Kara found her lacking in
			bed. Ginny didn't have experience. She didn't know how to love a woman. Kara had
			probably been with many women, all of whom were vastly superior to Ginny when it
			came to making love.</p>
		<p>Ginny was jealous again. Jealous of those women who had touched Kara, had
			made love to her. Was there someone now? Had she called up an old friend? Was
			there someone staying with her at her cottage?</p>
		<p>Ginny slammed her fist on the table, cursing herself for the tears that ran
			down her cheeks; cursing herself for being weak.</p>
		<p>She should just go back, she thought. Go back to Nana and her lonely life.
			She would forget about Kara. Eventually. Maybe even look back on this with
			fondness someday. Kara had, after all, shown her that there was a whole new life
			for her, just waiting to be explored.</p>
		<p>But instead of leaving, she took a bus downtown and walked the familiar
			streets, window-shopping and people watching. She paused at the high-rise where
			Phil worked. Where she had once worked, too. She should go up. At least say
			hello. At least so that she could tell Nana she had seen him.</p>
		<p>But she didn't. He would want to talk. It would just start all over again and
			it was better this way. She didn't want to see him, anyway. He meant nothing to
			her anymore. He was just a distant memory of another life. </p>
		<p>She walked down to the waterfront and had lunch, taking her seafood platter
			out to the patio overlooking Puget Sound. She had to fight the gulls for her
			last shrimp, but it was relaxing to be out here again. The familiar smell, the
			familiar sounds. She hadn't realized she had missed Seattle. She had stayed away
			because of Phil. But Chiwaukum was only a couple of hours through the mountains.
			She could come back now, if she wanted. She no longer felt the need to avoid
			Phil. That was over.</p>
		<p>She wondered through Pike Place Market, watching as the vendors displayed
			their goods, shoving through the crowds. Back on the street, she walked again
			through downtown, pausing to watch the horse-drawn carriages carry tourists
			along to the waterfront. She walked on, passing shops and people, her mind blank
			and empty for once.</p>
		<p>She passed an art gallery, one that she had walked past a hundred times
			before and her breath caught in her throat. She reached out to touch the glass,
			her eyes wide. It couldn't be. She brought her hand to her chest, trying to
			chase the pain away. The Big Tree. By Kara Morgan. She looked at the card again,
			but it was there.</p>
		<p>Her eyes blinked quickly, trying to hide the tears that had formed. She
			stared, dumbfounded. The forest was ablaze in white light, the moon seeming to
			chase the sun from the sky. Her eyes followed the giant tree into the dark
			forest, down its rough bark, bark that she could still feel pressing against her
			skin. The path to the tree seemed to glow and she followed it now, as her feet
			had followed it all those weeks ago. And there, at its base, stood the shadows
			of two lovers, beneath the summer moon, heads drawn together, embracing. Hands
			touching, loving.</p>
		<p>She shuddered and her breath left her in a silent gasp. Is that how they had
			been? Wrapped so closely together that even the barest of light could not
			penetrate? She watched, and remembered. </p>
		<p>"Did you want him the way you wanted me? Did you beg him to put his mouth on
			you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny swallowed hard, her eyes unseeing as she stared at the painting.</p>
		<p>"Did he make you feel the way that I did? Were your breasts ready for his
			touch, like they are mine?"</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head. "Never," she whispered. She closed her eyes and saw
			them, her hand placing Kara's between her legs. "Touch me."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, Phil is coming."</p>
		<p>"I don't care. I need you. Don't stop."</p>
		<p>She groaned, remembering. "I'm so sorry."</p>
		<p>"You don't ever have to be sorry for wanting me that way."</p>
		<p>And then, "Ginny, honey, come on."</p>
		<p>And Ginny knew. Kara loved her. It was all there, right in front of her. Kara
			loved her.</p>
		<p>She pushed through the door, going immediately to the painting.</p>
		<p>"May I help you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny looked up, stunned. "I . . . I want to buy this one," she stammered.
		</p>
		<p>The woman smiled. "Ah, are you familiar with her work?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Well, we have some others of hers. I'm afraid this one is not for sale."</p>
		<p>Ginny swallowed. "What do you mean?"</p>
		<p>The woman smiled again. "The owner has decided to keep it and display it for
			awhile. Perhaps in a few months . . .." She walked away, beckoning Ginny to
			follow. "Come, we have some others by Kara Morgan."</p>
		<p>Ginny followed, her eyes wide as she saw familiar scenes appear before her.
			The waterfalls, at sunrise. Nana's favorite lake, also at sunrise. She looked
			closer, seeing two deer faintly in the mist. She moved on and her eyes teared
			again. Their lake. Their sunset. She reached out. She had sat right there,
			beside Kara and watched as the colors changed, as the lake turned from blue to
			orange before her eyes. She glanced at the card. Ginny's Lake. She raised her
			eyes to the woman.</p>
		<p>"Yes, this one is beautiful," the woman said. "But, its been sold."</p>
		<p>Ginny's heart sank. Sold? That was her lake. That was her sunset. She took a
			deep breath and turned to the woman. "I want the one in the window," she said
			evenly.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>"Please, I have to have it. Ask the owner," Ginny pleaded. </p>
		<p>"Very well. I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>Ginny watched her go, then turned again to Kara's paintings. They were
			beautiful. All of them. She could picture Kara standing over them, her fingers
			holding the brush gently, lovingly stroking the canvas, bringing the scenes to
			life.</p>
		<p>"Ma'am?"</p>
		<p>Ginny turned. "Yes?"</p>
		<p>"She'll part with it for three thousand," the woman said.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded. "Okay." She didn't care about the price. She would have drained
			her entire savings to have it.</p>
		<p>The woman smiled. "She would like to display it for awhile. Could some
			arrangement be made?"</p>
		<p>"No. I'm not from Seattle."</p>
		<p>"Perhaps we could ship it to you then?"</p>
		<p>"No." Ginny forced a smile. "I'm sorry. But I must have it now." </p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Nine">
		<p>Kara stood looking out over Puget Sound, unseeing, as the ferry took her to
			Seattle. A party. She didn't feel like a party. She didn't feel much like
			anything, but Marsha had talked her into it. A bunch of their old friends would
			be there, she had said.</p>
		<p>"Big deal," Kara muttered. She glanced to the west, the sun still hanging on,
			dipping into the sea as it fought with the clouds that brought a slow drizzle.
			And the colors were magnificent. But she could find little joy in them this
			evening. She turned her face away and cupped her hands, flicking a flame to her
			cigarette.</p>
		<p>She drove through the wet streets, thoughts of Ginny crowding her mind and
			she pushed them all away.</p>
		<p>"Jesus, look at you," Marsha said, drawing Kara inside. "You look like
			shit."</p>
		<p>"Thanks."</p>
		<p>"I mean it. When's the last time you've eaten?"</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged, slipping another cigarette between her lips. Marsha watched
			her, concern showing on her face. "I've never seen you this way, Kara. I'm
			worried about you."</p>
		<p>"Please," Kara said and rolled her eyes. "I'm fine."</p>
		<p>"Why don't you call her?" Marsha asked gently.</p>
		<p>Kara shook her head. "No." She took a deep drag off her cigarette. "I'm
			extremely happy being miserable."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Thirty">
		<p>"It's the Big Tree," Nana said excitedly. </p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"It's . . . beautiful," she said, looking closer. "Look, there are people ..."</p>
		<p>"Yes," Ginny said sharply. </p>
		<p>Nana looked up. "Should we hang it above the sofa?" </p>
		<p>"No. I want to put it in my room," she said.</p>
		<p>"In your room? Why, it would look wonderful out here," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at her. "I would rather hang it in my room."</p>
		<p>"Well, okay. It is your painting," Nana said defensively. "Did you see
			her?"</p>
		<p>"No. I bought it at a gallery, downtown," she said.</p>
		<p>"What did you pay?"</p>
		<p>"It doesn't matter," Ginny said quietly.</p>
		<p>"Too much, no doubt. You should have just asked her for one. She said she
			sometimes gave them as gifts," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Like I said, I didn't see her," Ginny said. She left, taking the painting
			with her. She propped it against the bed and stared at it, again. It was all
			there. Everything she felt, it was there. Kara had captured it exactly. Their
			love. </p>
		<p>She squeezed her eyes closed, trying to ward off the tears that she knew
			would come. She had been unable to stop them last night and today. She had
			cried. She had cried for herself. She cried for Kara. She cried because the pain
			in her heart was nearly too much for her to bear. </p>
		<p>Maybe she shouldn't have taken the painting. It was too painful to look at,
			really. Maybe she should just put it away for awhile. Maybe later, years from
			now, she could look at it and not remember.</p>
		<p>"Where are you?" she whispered. "Why won't you come back to me? I know you
			love me." She tucked her face into her hands and cried, deep sobs that came from
			her heart.</p>
		<p>She cried when the espresso machine gave her mocha instead of a latte. She
			pounded the side, tears streaming down her face.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Damn thing," she muttered. She sipped the mocha and it burned her mouth.
		</p>
		<p>She cried when she restocked the shelf with cereal, knocking several boxes to
			the floor. She picked them up, wiping at her tears.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? What's wrong?" Nana asked. </p>
		<p>"Nothing."</p>
		<p>She cried when she burned the garlic bread they were having for dinner.
			"Goddamn it!" she yelled, jerking the bread from the oven. </p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," she whispered.</p>
		<p>Nana stared at her, not knowing what to say. </p>
		<p>And she cried in bed, the light still on, her eyes staring at Kara's painting
			for hours on end. </p>
		<p>Nana suffered through her bouts of tears in silence. Ginny could not tell her
			what was wrong. Nana had quit asking. She walked around her gently, trying not
			to upset her.</p>
		<p>One night, weeks later, as Ginny lay in bed, tears running down her cheeks,
			Nana came to her.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, what's wrong, child?" she asked gently. "I want to help."</p>
		<p>Ginny turned bruised eyes to Nana. "I'm . . . I'm so lonely," she
			whispered.</p>
		<p>Nana sat on the edge of the bed and brushed her hair, as if soothing a child.
		</p>
		<p>"Why don't you just call?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Call?"</p>
		<p>"Phil," Nana said gently. </p>
		<p>Ginny cried harder, her shoulders shaking. "Oh, Nana. It's not . . . not
			Phil," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana looked at her, puzzled.</p>
		<p>Ginny couldn't keep it inside any longer. She no longer cared if Nana hated
			her.</p>
		<p>"I miss . . . Kara," she cried.</p>
		<p>"Kara?" </p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, covering her face with her hands.</p>
		<p>"I don't understand," Nana whispered.</p>
		<p>"Kara left . . . because of me," she said.</p>
		<p>"You're not making sense," Nana said. "Why would she leave because of
			you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny took Nana's hand. "Kara and I . . . we . . .." But she couldn't say the
			words. Not to Nana.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? What? What's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"I love her," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>Nana frowned. "You're good friends."</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head. "More than friends, Nana."</p>
		<p>Nana frowned again, her eyes searching Ginny's. "What are you saying,
			child?"</p>
		<p>"We . . .." Ginny closed her eyes. "We were lovers," she whispered softly.
			"I'm in love with her."</p>
		<p>"Ginny?" Nana gasped. "You're not saying . . . that you and Kara?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Nana. I know you don't understand." She opened her eyes, but Nana
			couldn't meet hers. "I didn't know how to tell you."</p>
		<p>"But . . . Phil. You're not . . . like that. Kara's not . . .." But Nana
			stopped. "Is she?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"My God. What did she do to you?" Nana hissed. </p>
		<p>"No. It wasn't her. It was me, Nana." She took Nana's hand, trying to make
			her understand. "Why do you think I ran from Phil? It just wasn't right with
			him. There was no magic. I was looking for that magic that you had with
			Grandpa," she said. "And then I met Kara. And I finally found what I had been
			looking for. She made me feel everything that I'd been missing."</p>
		<p>Nana shook her head. "I don't understand," she said softly. "I just don't
			understand."</p>
		<p>"I know you don't. I wasn't going to tell you." She turned away. "She's gone,
			anyway."</p>
		<p>"She's why you've been hurting?"</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, tears coming again. "I love her. But I don't think she's coming
			back to me."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Thirty-One">
		<p>Kara drove through the mountains, the road more familiar than it should be.
			It had been three months since she had traveled here. Three months since she had
			left Ginny. Her stomach tightened. What would Ginny say to her? Would she be
			angry? </p>
		<p>Maybe she would be thankful Kara had left. Maybe she had time to sort out her
			life, to decide what she really wanted. Maybe it wasn't Kara.</p>
		<p>Kara closed her eyes briefly, thinking of the pain she would feel if Ginny
			sent her away. But then, it couldn't be any worse than the pain she had been
			suffering these past few months. Marsha, of all people, had made her come
			back.</p>
		<p>"You're making yourself sick. Hell, you're making me sick just watching
			you."</p>
		<p>Kara could smile now. It was almost over, one way or the other.</p>
		<p>The Dobson place was as she had left it. She opened the windows, letting the
			breeze chase away the stale smell of the closed-up cabin. She unpacked what
			little she had brought back with her. She had been afraid to pack too much. She
			wasn't certain how long she would be staying. And October was but a few weeks
			away.</p>
		<p>She gave in to the nervousness that had been threatening the entire trip and
			took a beer and a cigarette to the porch and settled in her chair, pleased that
			it still felt comfortable to her. She listened to the calls of the birds, the
			calming sound of the wind in the trees. Different than the sound the wind made
			at her cottage, yet familiar, and she relaxed. </p>
		<p>She would go to her at the store, she decided. Not at the house, where Nana
			could watch their every move, hear their every word. And the store was safer,
			she thought. Ginny might be less inclined to strike out at her, if that was to
			be her intention.</p>
		<p>She should go, yet she stayed rooted to the chair, fumbling into her pack for
			another cigarette. Nerves. What a terrible thing for a woman her age. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Thirty-Two">
		<p>Ginny looked up at the sound of the bell, like she always did. Her smile
			faltered and she dropped the change she was handing to Mrs. Peters, listening as
			it clattered to the counter top, then the floor. Kara.</p>
		<p>"I'll get it," Mrs. Peters said, but Ginny hardly heard. Startled green eyes
			met blue across the room.</p>
		<p>Her heart beat painfully in her chest and she couldn't breathe. But Kara was
			there, standing by the door, still holding it open, as if she were afraid to
			come inside.</p>
		<p>Ginny moved, her feet carrying her slowly around the counter, her eyes never
			leaving Kara's. She stopped a mere foot from her, surprised to find fear in
			Kara's eyes.</p>
		<p>"Don't you ever . . . leave me again," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>Ginny let her breath out slowly, then moved into Kara's arms, pressing
			against her warmth, feeling so much relief that she thought she would surely
			die. Strong arms held her close and she breathed in Kara's scent.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .."</p>
		<p>But Ginny pulled out of her arms and turned to Nana, who was watching them
			with wariness. </p>
		<p>"Can you manage without me?" </p>
		<p>"I suppose," Nana said, unable to meet Kara's eyes.</p>
		<p>Ginny turned and walked out the door, feeling Kara's presence behind her. Why
			was she here? Did she come back for Ginny or did she come to finally explain?
			She stopped at Kara's Land Cruiser, then turned and met her eyes, tears forming
			in her own at the profound sadness in Kara's.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . I . . .."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk yet," she said, wiping a tear off her cheek.</p>
		<p>Kara drove quickly down the road, her eyes glancing at Ginny frequently, but
			Ginny refused to look at her. "We need to talk," Kara finally said. "Do you want
			to go to your house?"</p>
		<p>"No. I'm not ready to talk," Ginny said quietly.</p>
		<p>Kara drove to the Dobson cabin in silence, glancing occasionally at the woman
			beside her, the woman who simply stared out the window as they drove. Once
			inside, they stood staring at each other for countless seconds, both trying
			desperately to read the other's eyes.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Kara finally said. "I just wanted you to have a chance . .
			.."</p>
		<p>"I said . . . I don't want to talk yet," Ginny whispered. She went to Kara
			and slipped into her arms. "I just want to love you," she said softly.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny," Kara murmured into her hair, breathing deeply. All the endless
			weeks of pain vanished as her hands moved over Ginny's soft body, molding her to
			her own. </p>
		<p>"I need to . . . be with you," Ginny whispered. "I need to know if it's
			true," she said.</p>
		<p>"If what is true?"</p>
		<p>"I saw it in your painting, but I thought maybe I was just hoping, wishing,"
			she said, her voice ripe with emotion and unshed tears. At Kara's frown, she
			said, "I went to Seattle looking for you. I saw the tree. I bought it."</p>
		<p>Kara touched Ginny's face, tears brimming in her own eyes.</p>
		<p>"Tell me I didn't imagine the love in that painting."</p>
		<p>"I knew for certain that I loved you that night," she whispered. "And I was
			afraid."</p>
		<p>Ginny drew Kara's head to hers, meeting her lips for the first time, feeling
			as weak as she had that other time, so long ago now. "Show me," she
			whispered.</p>
		<p>Kara drew Ginny's naked body to her, touching her breasts with gentle
			fingers, feeling the familiar hardness against her palms. She had thought, once,
			that she might never again feel Ginny beside her, like this. But Ginny was here,
			she was real and Kara loved her with a passion she had only dreamed of. Her
			mouth left Ginny's, moving to her breasts and Kara buried her face between them
			and she cried.</p>
		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"I love you," Kara whispered. "I'm so sorry. I was just scared to death over
			what I felt."</p>
		<p>Ginny pulled her up, letting her own tears fall and she pressed her face into
			Kara's neck. "Don't cry, sweetheart," she whispered. "I love you so very much.
			I'll never hurt you."</p>
		<p>Ginny pushed Kara gently on the bed and covered her, needing to show her how
			much she loved her. Her kisses were soft, feather-light on her face, her eyes.
			Words of love poured from her and she murmured in Kara's ear, promising her,
			tempting her with the ecstasy that was to come. Her tongue slid slowly over
			Kara's, into her mouth, needing to know her again. She moved to her breasts, her
			tongue raking each nipple in turn, feeling them harden, taking each into her
			mouth, feeling them swell even more as she gently sucked, gently teased.</p>
		<p>"Ginny."</p>
		<p>"Yes. I'm here." Ginny's tongue moved over her, tasting her, wetting a path
			that her mouth followed and she heard Kara's heart beating loudly, heard her
			breath catch when Ginny kissed her thighs, moving over her, touching her first
			with gentle hands, soothing her, spreading her thighs even more. She breathed
			the scent of Kara and she was lost. She knelt between her legs, eyes closed as
			she touched her, fingers moving through her silkiness, then inside her as Kara
			moaned softly. </p>
		<p>"I love you so much," Ginny whispered. She lay down and buried her face
			between Kara's legs, tasting her, loving her. Her tongue moved deep within her,
			feeling Kara drawing her in. She took her gently between her lips, her tongue
			moving over her, stroking her, feeling Kara move with her, writhing under her
			mouth before yielding to the pleasure that Ginny brought to her. Kara clutched
			Ginny's head, fingers entwining in her hair, and she held Ginny to her, hard,
			pushing her hips against her face, begging her.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . oh, Ginny," she breathed and then she stilled, her voice gone as
			her breath caught and her hips arched once and she screamed out, calling Ginny's
			name again before her legs gave way and she relaxed, spent, arms falling to her
			sides, chest heaving.</p>
		<p>Ginny knelt between her legs, hands resting on Kara's stomach. "I love you,
			Kara," she whispered.</p>
		<p>Kara's eyes opened slowly and she reached out to touch Ginny's face, still
			wet with her. "I hurt you," she said. "I'm so sorry." </p>
		<p>"Yes," Ginny nodded. "You hurt me. You left me and I wanted to die," she
			said. "I just couldn't understand, Kara. I felt so strongly about this and you
			just disappeared, as if it meant nothing to you."</p>
		<p>"I ran. I was . . .."</p>
		<p>"You were scared I would hurt you," Ginny stated. She crawled next to Kara,
			wrapping her arms around her and snuggling close to her. "It wasn't until I saw
			the painting that I finally realized why you had really left. But I couldn't
			find you." Her voice broke and she swallowed back tears. "I tried."</p>
		<p>"I won't leave you again," Kara promised. </p>
		<p>"No. I won't let you. This is what I want, Kara. Not some faceless woman from
			my future. Not a chance to meet someone else, someone other than you." She
			traced Kara's lips with her finger, then cupped her cheek, making Kara look at
			her. "You not only took my heart, Kara. You took my soul. I'm just half a person
			when you're gone."</p>
		<p>Kara let tears slip easily from her eyes as she held Ginny's gaze. Foolish
			women in love. Indeed. She had made a big mistake by leaving. They should have
			talked then, they should have shared all of this then. But she had been too
			scared all those weeks ago. Her pride had told her to run before Ginny decided
			there were others out there, much better than herself.</p>
		<p>"I just wanted you to be sure . . . that I was what you wanted. I didn't want
			to assume . . .." Kara said, trying to explain.</p>
		<p>"I'm sure." Then Ginny smiled and leaned over to touch her lips to Kara's.
			"I'm sure that I want you in my life, like this. I'm sure that I love you. I'm
			sure that I want you to make love to me . . . right now," she finished in a
			whisper as her kiss deepened.</p>
		<p>Kara's lovemaking was slow, unhurried. She touched Ginny with gentle hands
			and soft lips, saying she was sorry, over and over again. Then Ginny was guiding
			her, spreading her legs for her and Kara went to her, her mouth loving her, her
			tongue moving through her wetness, her moan mingling with Ginny's as her tongue
			slipped deep inside her.</p>
		<p>Much too soon, Ginny thought. Too soon. But she couldn't stop the flame as it
			moved through her body, consuming her, igniting the fire that burned beneath
			Kara's mouth. She clutched at the bed, her fists raking through the covers as
			she tried to anchor herself, but she was washed away as wave after wave hit her,
			causing her to cry out, to scream Kara's name, to press Kara even closer to
			her.</p>
		<p>"Oh . . . my . . . God," she whispered. "No one but you," she breathed, so
			softly.</p>
		<p>Kara gathered Ginny in her arms. "No one but you." </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Thirty-Three">
		<p>Kara laughed as Ginny surveyed the room, trying to find the perfect place to
			hang the Big Tree. Kara already knew it would go over the fireplace, but Ginny
			wanted to be certain it was the best place for them to see it at all times.</p>
		<p>They bought the Dobson cabin together. It needed a little work, but they had
			time. In the past month, they had been to Seattle to collect some of Kara's
			things and they moved most of Ginny's from Nana's house. Nana had not yet
			accepted this. She didn't understand the love they had for each other and Kara
			didn't blame her. But she knew it was very hard for Ginny. Louise could hardly
			stay in the same room as Kara now.</p>
		<p>"She'll come around," Ginny had said. "Give her time."</p>
		<p>Kara's eyes followed Ginny across the room, watching her. Her heart swelled
			with love each and every time she looked at her. Kara knew she had never been so
			happy in all her life. Finally, she felt at home.</p>
		<p>"You know what I think?" Ginny asked as she stood with her hands perched on
			her hips.</p>
		<p>"What's that?"</p>
		<p>"I think we should hang it over the fireplace."</p>
		<p>Kara arched one eyebrow.</p>
		<p>"Really? What a wonderful idea," she teased.</p>
		<p>Ginny walked slowly towards her, her own eyebrow raised. </p>
		<p>"Do you have any idea how sexy you are?" Ginny asked. She slid her arms
			around Kara and pressed her hips intimately against her. Kara responded
			instantly.</p>
		<p>But Ginny pulled away, a grin on her face.</p>
		<p>"So, will you help me hang it?"</p>
		<p>"Now?" Kara asked, trying to pull Ginny back.</p>
		<p>"Yes, now. Baby, we spent the entire morning in bed."</p>
		<p>"And what's wrong with the afternoon, too?"</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed, then laughed harder when she saw that Kara was serious.</p>
		<p>"We did that yesterday."</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>Ginny reached out and cupped Kara's cheek, her eyes soft upon her.</p>
		<p>"Why haven't you been painting?"</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "I've been busy."</p>
		<p>"You haven't painted since you've been back."</p>
		<p>Kara dipped her head, then looked up shyly at Ginny. "I'd rather be with
			you," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny heard the words behind the words. She moved closer to Kara, one hand
			sliding easily under her shirt to touch warm skin.</p>
		<p>"I'm not Marsha," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara looked up, surprised. "I know. I just . . .."</p>
		<p>"I'm not going to leave you. I won't go out with friends because you're not
			paying me enough attention, honey. Painting is your life," she said.</p>
		<p>"You're my life."</p>
		<p>"No. I'm a part of your life. Painting is, too. It's who you are. It's what
			makes you special."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to fall into the same trap, Ginny. I get so involved, I just
			lose track of time."</p>
		<p>"Then I'll remind you. And if I feel like you're ignoring me, I'll sneak up
			behind you," she said, moving behind Kara as she spoke. "Like this," she
			whispered, moving both hands under Kara's shirt now, sliding up to cup her
			breasts. "And I'll tell you that I need you," she murmured into her ear. She
			felt Kara's heart pounding beneath her hands and she closed her eyes, so sure of
			their love for each other. She slid one hand lower, along Kara's thigh and felt
			her tremble in her arms. "And I know you'll stop what you're doing, because you
			love me . . . and you want me."</p>
		<p>Kara turned quickly and captured Ginny, wrapping long arms around her before
			kissing her soundly.</p>
		<p>"Are you teasing me?" she murmured against her mouth.</p>
		<p>"Never."</p>
		<p>Their mouths met again, harder, and their bodies moved together in a dance
			that was known only to them.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Louise stood in the opened doorway, a witness to a love she never thought
			she'd see. She'd heard laughter from inside and walked up the wooden steps,
			unnoticed. She saw, for the first time, Ginny's happiness. She could see it in
			her eyes as she looked at Kara. She could see it as Ginny moved to the other
			woman, touching her so naturally that Louise blushed with the genuine love she
			saw there. And Kara. Oh, her eyes followed Ginny around the room, a smile
			touching her face just from being in her presence. She saw their teasing, their
			affection for one another. It reminded her of her own marriage. </p>
		<p>How could she have disapproved of this? Had she ever seen Ginny so happy? But
			then, they had moved together, had touched in ways Louise could never have
			imagined.</p>
		<p>She cleared her throat loudly, coughing lightly. The couple pulled apart
			quickly, a crimson blush lighting Ginny's face immediately.</p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"I thought I should intervene before I witnessed something far too personal
			for grandmothers," she said lightly, stepping fully into the room</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I . . . I didn't expect you," Ginny said and she moved farther
			away from Kara.</p>
		<p>Louise took a deep breath and clasped her granddaughter's hands. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't be sorry. I'm the one who should be sorry. I couldn't see the
			love you have for her. I couldn't imagine . . . what you could have with Kara."
			She glanced quickly at Kara, a woman she had admired before and then shunned.
			She knew that she was wrong. "I have never seen you so happy."</p>
		<p>Ginny's eyes misted over and she hugged Nana tightly. She had been so afraid
			she had lost her love.</p>
		<p>"I love her," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I can see that. I'm sorry I judged you."</p>
		<p>Ginny pulled away from Nana and grabbed for Kara's hand. She pulled her close
			to her side, her eyes meeting Nana's again.</p>
		<p>"I've found my magic, Nana," Ginny whispered. "I so want you to be happy for
			me."</p>
		<p>"I am." She raised her eyes to Kara, meeting the blue, blue eyes of the woman
			who loved her Ginny. "I'm happy for you both. I'm sorry it's taken me this long
			to see what you have."</p>
		<p>Kara lifted a corner of her mouth in a smile. Louise had come around.</p>
		<p>"We're having lasagna for dinner, Louise. I hope you'll stay," she
			offered.</p>
		<p>"Of course. And I'd like to look around. I haven't been to the Dobson place
			in years. Imagine, Ginny, married forty years and divorcing. Why, I declare . .
			. it's not like your grandfather and I didn't have fights. But we would never
			let it come to this. We would work through it. People nowadays . . .."</p>
		<p>Kara listened as her voice trailed off when Ginny led her through the cabin,
			showing her the kitchen.</p>
		<p>She smiled as Ginny shot her a glance over Nana's shoulder. Everything was
			complete. Nana had come around.</p>
		<p>She followed them into the kitchen and grabbed a beer and her cigarettes and
			moved to the deck in the back, ignoring the light mist that surrounded her. She
			lit her cigarette easily, listening as Ginny and Nana moved about the house,
			Ginny telling her about the plans they had.</p>
		<p>She tired to think of a time in her life when she'd felt more content, more
			at home, and she couldn't. There was nothing else in her life that could compare
			to this. She knew without a doubt that she loved Ginny completely. As she also
			knew that Ginny loved her. </p>
		<p>"Baby?"</p>
		<p>Before she could turn, a gentle hand stroked her back.</p>
		<p>"You okay?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara turned and moved into Ginny's arms, hugging her tightly to her
			chest.</p>
		<p>"I'm so in love with you."</p>
		<p>She felt Ginny smile against her neck, then soft lips nibbled there.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Kara . . . don't you know what you do to me? I love you, too,
			sweetheart."</p>
		<p>Their bodies pulled apart, but their eyes did not. Green locked on blue and
			they smiled. Slow, gentle smiles that touched their hearts . . . and souls. </p>
