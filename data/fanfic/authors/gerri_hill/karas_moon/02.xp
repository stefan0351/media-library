	<chapter title="Eleven">
		<p>Kara stayed away. For three days, she worked on her painting, finishing up
			the sunrise at the lake and continuing on the sunset she had shared with Ginny.
			Ginny. She had occupied her thoughts day and night, but Kara refused to call
			her. She refused to go by the store. She needed time away from her. Never in her
			life had another woman crowded in on her so, making her nearly crazy with
			wanting her. It had been so long since she had known this kind of desire. </p>
		<p>"She's straight," she said again.
			<i>Isn't she?</i> She lit a cigarette, her
			sixth, and slumped down in the lawn chair. Smoking and drinking, she had done
			much more of both since she had met Ginny, she thought, as she lifted the beer
			bottle to her lips. She tried not to picture the two of them together, as they
			had been in her dreams last night.
		</p>
		<p>She shook her head slowly, absently knocking ashes from her cigarette. It
			wasn't as if she were looking for someone. She had realized in the last three
			years that she didn't really need anyone in her life. If she got lonely, if she
			got the urge for someone's touch, there were always willing women in Seattle.
			Casual sex was much safer on the heart than going through all that silly
			courting anyway. </p>
		<p>She had found a lake on the map that she wanted to look at, but she had been
			putting it off. She glanced at the sky, clear and blue. This evening would be a
			good time, she thought. Only, it was at the other end of town, past the general
			store, and she had not wanted to even be near there, for fear Ginny or Louise
			would be out front. Then she would feel compelled to stop and visit and she
			would be forced to look into Ginny's green eyes and she would be lost all over
			again.</p>
		<p>She stopped her thoughts. She couldn't just keep avoiding her. She came out
			here to work. If there was a lake she wanted to go to, she would go. She was
			acting like a teenager with a crush, for God's sake! With that, she stubbed out
			her cigarette and drained the last of her beer. She would go, take a look and if
			the colors were good, sketch another sunset and be on her way.</p>
		<p>She drove quickly, with good intentions not to even glance at the store, but
			her eyes were drawn to it. She saw Ginny sitting on the porch and she cursed
			when Ginny lifted a hand in greeting and, without even thinking, Kara turned her
			Toyota into the drive and stopped beside her.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing?" Kara asked through the opened window.</p>
		<p>"Just sitting," Ginny explained. "You?"</p>
		<p>"There's a lake, out on Mill Creek," she said, motioning up the road.</p>
		<p>"Potter's Lake," Ginny supplied. </p>
		<p>"You've been there?"</p>
		<p>"Many times."</p>
		<p>"Any good?"</p>
		<p>"Quiet. Lot's of trees," Ginny said, her eyes on Kara. "The fishing's not
			great."</p>
		<p>"Oh, darn," Kara said with a smile.</p>
		<p>They stared at each other and Ginny couldn't pull her eyes away, even when
			she felt her pulse begin to pound nervously. Her eyes dropped briefly to Kara's
			lips, remembering all that those lips had done to her in her dreams. She blushed
			crimson and found Kara's eyes again, trying to read them.</p>
		<p>The screen door opened and Ginny finally broke Kara's hold on her.</p>
		<p>"Why, Kara," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Hello, Louise."</p>
		<p>"Going out sketching again?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Why don't you take Ginny? I think she's feeling cooped up."</p>
		<p>Ginny looked from Nana to Kara and back again. "Oh, I couldn't leave the
			store just yet," she said.</p>
		<p>"Nonsense," Nana exclaimed.</p>
		<p>Nonsense? Ginny rubbed her temples, trying to think of an excuse not to be
			alone with Kara.</p>
		<p>"We're not busy. You run along. I can lock up."</p>
		<p>Ginny looked up and met Kara's amused eyes that just hinted at a challenge.
			"You don't mind?" she asked weakly.</p>
		<p>"Not at all," Kara lied. Of course she minded. She didn't want to be alone
			with her. But she said, "I'd love your company."</p>
		<p>Ginny crawled up in her Land Cruiser, resisting the urge to cling to the
			door, and she made herself relax. It was short-lived, however. Kara's arm
			slipped along the back of the seat behind her as she turned to back up and Ginny
			could almost feel it caressing her shoulders. She shivered from the heat of it.
		</p>
		<p>"How have you been?" Kara asked when they pulled away.</p>
		<p>"Fine. You?"</p>
		<p>"Okay." </p>
		<p>"Have you been working?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara glanced at her, aware of her nervousness. And of her own.</p>
		<p>"Should I apologize for the other night?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"For what?"</p>
		<p>"For what I said."</p>
		<p>"Don't be silly," Ginny said with a lightness she wasn't feeling. "I asked
			the question."</p>
		<p>There were no other cars at the lake and Ginny glanced at the sky, mindful of
			the approaching evening and how utterly alone they would be. She shouldn't have
			come, she thought. She shouldn't be out here alone with Kara. She felt confused
			and all mixed up inside whenever she was near Kara. Whenever she found Kara's
			eyes on her. </p>
		<p>She watched as Kara got out, sketch pad tucked under her arm, and she looked
			at her through the opened window.</p>
		<p>"Coming?" Kara asked. </p>
		<p>Ginny nodded and her eyes followed Kara as she walked away but she was still
			sitting there when Kara turned back around to glance at her questioningly.</p>
		<p>"Coming," Ginny said and she finally opened the door.</p>
		<p>"Don't be afraid of me," Kara said as they walked. "I would never . . .."</p>
		<p>"I know you wouldn't," Ginny said sharply. "I'm not afraid."</p>
		<p>"Aren't you?"</p>
		<p>"Not of you, exactly," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Then what?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing," Ginny murmured. "Let's don't talk about it, please."</p>
		<p>Kara nodded. "Okay. We won't talk." </p>
		<p>They walked along the path, Ginny following Kara as the trail narrowed toward
			the water. Kara looked overhead, trying to pretend that she was interested in
			the colors, but she wasn't. Her mind wasn't on sketching. She was thankful for
			the trees. They blocked out the setting sun and the lake reflected only the
			forest as it darkened with only a hint of the colors of sunset.</p>
		<p>Kara knew she should simply tell Ginny that the colors were no good and that
			they should turn back. Go home, where it would be safe. Where she would not be
			tempted. But she didn't. They were completely alone and her pulse raced at the
			thought. She wanted to be alone with her, she realized and she felt foolish.
			Ginny wanted nothing from her, she reminded herself.</p>
		<p>They walked to the shore, the lake surface smooth as glass in the still
			evening. Ginny noticed that Kara made no move to take out her sketchpad, but
			Ginny made no mention of it. She wasn't sure she could speak. She felt her heart
			pounding and she took in a deep breath of air, trying to still her racing pulse.
			What was she expecting? That Kara would sweep her into her arms and kiss her?
			That she would say she had been dreaming about her, too and she just had to see
			what it would be like to kiss her? Is that what she wanted? Did she want Kara to
			take her in her arms? God, of course not! She wanted no such thing!</p>
		<p>Oh, she brought a trembling hand to her throat, feeling her pulse beat wildly
			and she knew that she had probably worked herself into a frenzy over nothing!
			Surely, Kara was having none of these same feelings. Surely, Kara was not the
			least bit attracted to her. Was she?</p>
		<p>They stood there, the silence nearly deafening as they both looked out over
			the lake. When Ginny turned, Kara's eyes were on her, and her own lifted and met
			her questioning stare. What was she thinking? What was she feeling? Kara tried
			to find the answers in her eyes but failed.</p>
		<p>Ginny touched a hand to her chest, feeling the tightness, wishing her heart
			would slow to normal. She felt the pull between them and wondered if Kara felt
			it, too. </p>
		<p>"Too many trees," Kara finally managed.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded but her eyes never left Kara's. She was quickly losing the
			battle with herself and she took a hesitant step toward Kara.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Show me," she whispered. "I need to know." She saw Kara's jaw clinch
			nervously and she wanted to put her hand there. "Please?"</p>
		<p>Kara shook her head. "Ginny, don't," she warned. "You don't know what you're
			doing."</p>
		<p>Of course not but that didn't stop her as she reached out and captured Kara's
			warm hand. "I want to know," she said softly. "Kiss me."</p>
		<p>Kara felt the last thread of sanity flee at those softly whispered words. Her
			eyes dropped to the lips that were so inviting. Yes, she knew she should stop
			this, she knew she should walk away. But she couldn't deny herself the
			pleasure.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt Kara pull her towards her and she went willingly. When Kara's hand
			touched her face to guide her, she closed her eyes and waited for Kara's lips to
			touch hers. </p>
		<p>"Ginny," Kara whispered again and Ginny felt Kara's breath, warm on her face.
			She turned towards it and when their lips met, it was not slow and gentle. It
			was hurried and hungry and Ginny's mouth opened under hers and she whimpered
			softly when their tongues touched briefly for the first time. </p>
		<p>Kara pulled her in close, dropping her sketch pad to the ground and fitting
			Ginny's body with hers, feeling Ginny's breasts press against her own and she
			lost what little resolve she had. Her hands slid to Ginny's hips and she cupped
			her roundness, pulling Ginny flush against her as Ginny's trembling hands moved
			over her shoulders and around her neck. </p>
		<p>"Yes," Ginny breathed against Kara's lips and her tongue explored Kara's warm
			mouth, pushing past her lips. Soft lips, not a man's lips. She was on fire. </p>
		<p>It was magic. Their kisses were hot, wet and Ginny felt unfamiliar desire
			pool between her legs and she moaned softly against Kara's lips. Kara started to
			pull away, but Ginny followed, refusing to release her, all thought gone except
			these insane feelings that this woman created in her. Kara's lips softened and
			now they moved with exquisite gentleness over her own and Ginny felt her legs
			threaten to collapse as Kara cupped her face between her hands and touched her
			lips again and again.</p>
		<p>"Ginny," Kara whispered when she finally drew back. "Why?"</p>
		<p>"You know why," she accused. Ginny lowered her head and buried it against
			Kara's chest, her breath coming fast between her parted lips. "I just . . . had
			to know," she whispered.</p>
		<p>Kara tipped her chin up and looked deep into her eyes. "And now you think you
			know what it's like to kiss a woman?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," came the whispered answer.</p>
		<p>"And are you curious, too, as to how it would feel if I touched your
			breasts?" </p>
		<p>Ginny took in a deep breath, afraid to answer as Kara's hands slid
			dangerously close to her breasts.</p>
		<p>"Do you want to know?" Kara whispered and she bent again to take Ginny's
			mouth, which opened instantly to her tongue. Her hands stopped, the tops just
			brushing the swell under Ginny's breasts.</p>
		<p>"I'm so afraid of what I'm feeling," Ginny whispered, although her body
			begged for Kara's touch and she pressed closer, feeling her nipples harden at
			the thought of Kara's hands on them. In the early twilight, her eyes sought
			Kara's, trying desperately to make some sense of her feelings. </p>
		<p>Kara's hands trembled. It would be so easy, she knew. One more kiss, one
			touch. But she heard the fear in Ginny's voice, could see the uncertainty in her
			eyes. </p>
		<p>"You should be afraid," Kara said finally and pushed Ginny away, nearly
			causing her to stumble. She stepped back, her hands brushing her hair from her
			eyes. Jesus. What are you thinking? What are you doing?</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry," Ginny whispered, her own hands trembling as they wrapped
			around herself. "I never should have asked."</p>
		<p>Kara turned her back to Ginny, needing time. "Why are you sorry? It's not
			like I didn't want to kiss you."</p>
		<p>"I don't know what to say, Kara. I'm sorry . . .."</p>
		<p>"Please stop saying that. I'm the one who . . .."</p>
		<p>"No." Ginny swallowed with difficulty. "I've been thinking about you," she
			admitted. "Thinking things I shouldn't." She took a deep breath and turned away.
			"I can't stop . . . I mean . . . you're thinking I'm just curious, aren't you?"
			she asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know. Are you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny touched Kara's arm and turned her around to face her. "Maybe. I've
			never really thought about being with a woman before," she said. Her mind
			refused to bring up Renee. "Until I met you."</p>
		<p>Kara laughed and shoved her hands inside her pockets to stop herself from
			reaching out to her. "Well, if you're thinking of experimenting, you'll have to
			look elsewhere. I'm not really into that." She jerked up her sketchpad and began
			walking back along the trail and Ginny followed, running after her.</p>
		<p>"Kara, wait. I need to talk about this."</p>
		<p>"Well, I don't," Kara snapped. Stupid, stupid fool, she cursed herself.</p>
		<p>"You don't understand," Ginny said, trying to keep up with Kara's long
			strides.</p>
		<p>"No, I suppose I don't," she said.</p>
		<p>"Goddamn it, will you stop," Ginny shouted.</p>
		<p>Kara stopped and turned around, her eyes angry. "What?"</p>
		<p>"I know what you're thinking," Ginny said. </p>
		<p>Kara laughed without humor. "Oh, I seriously doubt it."</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at her, her thoughts gone suddenly as she saw the desire still
			shimmering in Kara's eyes. It scared her more than she thought possible.</p>
		<p>"Don't play with me," Kara warned softly.</p>
		<p>"I'm not," Ginny said. "I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>"Because you don't know what you're doing," Kara continued, her voice now
			gentle. "I want you. But then, I guess you already know that."</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded weakly and she was frightened by the look in Kara's eyes. But
			more than that, she was frightened by what her own might reveal. </p>

	<chapter title="Twelve">
		<p>Ginny slept naked for the first time in years, her body yearning for
			someone's touch. Kara's touch. She laid still, her arms firmly at her sides
			while her mind raced, memories of Kara's lips still fresh. She closed her eyes,
			her body on fire. Before she realized it, her hands moved to her breasts,
			touching her erect nipples lightly, feeling her stomach churn with desire. Her
			breath came quickly as she pictured Kara's hands on her, touching just under her
			breasts. "Are you curious, too, as to how it would feel if I touched your
			breasts?" God, yes. And she knew, didn't she? Her hand moved lower, across her
			belly and she touched her soft hair, imaging Kara's hand there. Her legs parted
			and she touched herself, moaning softly at the wetness she found. Her hips moved
			on the bed, reaching out to her hand, to Kara's hand and her pulse pounded in
			her temples as she stroked herself, bringing herself closer to orgasm.</p>
		<p>"No," she cried and pulled her hand away. She would not. "What am I doing?"
			God, it was Kara she wanted.</p>
		<p>She rolled over onto her stomach, her body still trembling and wanting. Kara.
			She wanted Kara. The truth of her thoughts scared her to death. She wanted a
			woman. She wanted Kara. And she was scared.</p>
		<p>She overslept. Nana was knocking impatiently on her door, asking if she was
			all right and Ginny forced herself out of her dream, her wonderful dream and she
			turned, eyes trying to focus on the door that opened slowly. </p>
		<p>"Ginny?" Nana's voice was concerned.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. What time is it?" she asked, her voice husky with sleep and
			desire.</p>
		<p>"Nearly seven. Do you want me to open up?"</p>
		<p>Ginny very nearly sat up, then she remembered her nakedness and slumped down
			again under the covers. "Would you mind? I'll be there in a few minutes."</p>
		<p>"Are you sick?"</p>
		<p>"No. I had trouble falling asleep is all," she said.</p>
		<p>"You've been doing that a lot lately," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine, Nana."</p>
		<p>Nana watched her for a moment longer, then smiled and told her to hurry.
			Ginny waited until the door closed before she stood and wrapped her robe around
			her, her breasts, her body, still aching for Kara's touch. She shoved at her
			hair, tucking it behind her ears and rubbed her face, trying to wake up. Her
			body felt like lead and she tried to hurry through her shower, but she stood for
			endless moments under the warm spray, reliving the night before, remembering
			Kara's hot mouth on hers. Remembering how seeking her own had been. And how
			natural it felt.</p>
		<p>"God, I'm losing my mind," she murmured. Maybe she needed to call Phil. Maybe
			she just needed to be with him. It had been a long time, too long really. It
			wasn't normal to go without sex this long. That's all it was, surely, she
			thought. Why else would she be having these insane thoughts about another
			woman?</p>
		<p>At the store, she stood listlessly behind the counter, pen poised over the
			inventory list, her eyes staring past it. Without conscious thought, she saw
			Kara, saw the two of them embracing; breasts touching, hips pressing together,
			lips seeking, tongues dueling.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?" </p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"You've been working on that list for the last hour." Nana walked over and
			glanced over her shoulder. "You're still on the first page!"</p>
		<p>"Sorry. I can't seem to concentrate," she murmured. </p>
		<p>"Want me to do it?" </p>
		<p>"No, Nana. I'm sorry," she said. "I'll do it."</p>
		<p>"They close at five," she reminded her.</p>
		<p>"I know."</p>
		<p>Nana left her and Ginny forced her eyes to the page, marking down the items
			they needed to order. She shut her eyes several times, trying to block out
			images of Kara as they came to her and she firmly put them from her mind,
			instead she forced herself to recall Phil and pictured herself kissing him,
			wanting him. But it was not Phil that had her body trembling with want.</p>
		<p>Later, when the bell jingled over the door, she glanced up, afraid it would
			be Kara, but two women walked in. Ginny watched them and smiled slightly when
			they met her eyes. Were they lovers? </p>
		<p>God, now she was thinking that every woman she met was a lesbian! Why would
			that even enter her mind? It never had before. But she stared at them, seeing
			the familiar glances they shared and knew instantly that they were lovers. </p>
		<p>Suddenly, Kara swam before her eyes; Kara's mouth as she bent to Ginny;
			Kara's tongue as it pushed into her mouth, tasting every inch of her. Kara's
			hands, as they rested just under her breasts. And Ginny had wanted her to touch
			them. She wanted it now. She could feel her nipples harden at the thought and
			she longed for Kara's touch. Her stomach turned as she saw Kara's hands move
			over her breasts, cupping them, bringing them into her waiting mouth. Ginny was
			aware of the ache between her legs and she knew she wanted Kara's hands there,
			too. Oh, God . . .I want a woman.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?" Her mind tried to focus, but all she saw was Kara.</p>
		<p>"Ginny!" Nana said again and touched her arm.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. What?"</p>
		<p>"You're a thousand miles away. These women are interested in fishing and I
			told them how you and your grandfather used to go all the time. Tell them how to
			find one of the lakes."</p>
		<p>Ginny looked up and saw the women watching her and she blushed, fearing her
			thoughts were exposed.</p>
		<p>"Are you familiar with the area?" she managed.</p>
		<p>"We're camping out on Mill Creek, but the fishing's not very good there," one
			said.</p>
		<p>"No. It never has been." Ginny smiled. "There's a local fishing spot, but if
			someone asks how you found it, don't you dare mention my name." She told them
			how to get to Battle Canyon Creek and the hidden lake, the one that Kara had
			sketched. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, I'm worried about you," Nana said. "Why don't you go home early?"</p>
		<p>"You opened. I can't very well let you close, as well."</p>
		<p>"Don't be silly. Jessica is here. Why don't you call in the order, then go
			home. Get some sleep."</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, knowing full well that if she left the store, she wouldn't go
			to sleep. How could she sleep? Her traitorous body was threatening her, making
			demands that she could not, would not satisfy! </p>
		<p>Oh, this insanity has got to stop! I'm not a lesbian, she told herself over
			and over again. I'm not attracted to women. I'm not attracted to . . . Kara. She
			shut her eyes to the imagines of last night and turned away from Nana
			quickly.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? Are you all right?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"Fine," she managed.</p>
		<p>"Something's wrong. My God, you're as white as a sheet," Nana fussed. "Are
			you getting sick?"</p>
		<p>"I'm . . . I just feel a little dizzy," she said and it was the truth.</p>
		<p>"Will you please go home? I can do the order, Ginny." Nana reached up and
			felt her forehead, checking for fever and Ginny was surprised that Nana wasn't
			burned, considering how hot her body felt. "I don't think you have a fever,"
			Nana said. </p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh, yes, I have a fever, all right!</i> Ginny nearly laughed hysterically
			and she covered her mouth with her hand. I'm losing my mind!
		</p>
		<p>But she went home, leaving the store to Nana. She stripped off her clothes
			and took a cold shower, then crawled into bed, her skin still damp and she
			closed her eyes, only then allowing Kara to intrude into her thoughts.</p>
		<p>What is happening to me? How can that woman affect me so? Why now? She
			groaned and rolled her head into the pillow. It was her own fault, she knew.
			Kara would never have kissed her if Ginny hadn't practically begged her to. And
			why had she begged? Good Lord, had she been insane? </p>
		<p>"I'm not a lesbian," she whispered. Of course not. There was Phil. She liked
			being with Phil. She liked sex with him. She rolled her eyes and sighed. Who was
			she kidding? It had never been great with Phil. In fact, it had never . . .
			stop! "I just haven't met the right man," she murmured. "That's all."</p>
		<p>I won't see Kara again, she vowed. Not unless she comes into the store. Then
			she would have to be civil to her. But that was all. She would not allow Nana to
			invite her to dinner ever again. She would not go out sketching with her ever
			again. And eventually, the guilt and shame that she was feeling over that one
			indiscretion would fade and she would be normal again. She should be thankful
			that it had stopped with just a kiss. She laughed bitterly. Just a kiss? That
			was hardly just a kiss! Hadn't their bodies pressed together? Hadn't her body
			been screaming for Kara's touch upon her breasts?</p>
		<p>Maybe she would call Phil. Maybe she would invite him to come visit. Sex.
			Maybe that was all she needed. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Thirteen">
		<p>Kara sat on the porch, smoking, like she had been doing most of the day. She
			could not paint. She could not do much of anything. She had gone on a long walk
			that morning, trying to dispel Ginny from her thoughts. Little good it had done.
			She had been with her all day and she acknowledged the desire that still licked
			at her lower regions. </p>
		<p>She vowed she would not see Ginny again. At least, not alone. Last night, she
			had come so close to losing herself in Ginny's soft mouth. She had wanted to
			touch her. She had wanted to pull her to the forest floor and make love to her.
			Only Ginny's frightened eyes had stopped her from taking what she wanted.</p>
		<p>And of course, Ginny had no idea how close she had been. Kara wanted her with
			a passion that surprised even her. Ginny's body had been soft, yielding and
			responsive. Ginny's body had begged to be touched and she probably didn't even
			know it herself. Only the look in her eyes had stopped Kara.</p>
		<p>And then she was angry. Angry that Ginny had been afraid. Angry for wanting
			her. Angry that Ginny had made her want her.</p>
		<p>"Jesus. Is she straight or what?"</p>
		<p>Yes. Of course she was. She had merely been curious. Experimenting, maybe.
			Sex wasn't great with Phil, or so she had hinted. Maybe she was just trying to
			find out how it would feel if she kissed a woman. </p>
		<p>Well, Kara didn't want any part of it. She was too damn old to get mixed up
			in this kind of game. She didn't need it. She needed to work. She would go out
			sketching, every morning and every evening, until she had enough ideas to put to
			canvas and she would get the hell out of here and go back to Seattle.</p>
		<p>Where it was safe, she added.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Fourteen">
		<p>"You're looking better today," Nana said over breakfast.</p>
		<p>"You skipped your walk," Ginny accused. "I could have fended for myself."</p>
		<p>"I wanted to make sure you were okay. You missed dinner."</p>
		<p>Ginny hadn't left her room the night before. She had slept some. A troubled
			sleep, but still, she had slept. She had heard Nana moving about in the house,
			had heard her making dinner, but she didn't want to join her. She didn't want to
			have to answer any questions. So she had stayed in bed, pretending to be asleep.
			She was hiding from Nana, but she couldn't hide from her thoughts. Or her
			dreams.</p>
		<p>But she was better this morning. She didn't get all flushed when she thought
			about Kara's kiss, at least. Well, not much anyway. She closed her eyes. I won't
			think about it today. I won't.</p>
		<p>They rode to the store together and Ginny stayed busy, doing paper work and
			trying desperately to occupy her mind. It worked. She was surprised when she
			glanced at the clock and it was already after twelve.</p>
		<p>"Aren't you going for lunch?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"I think I'll just eat it here," she said.</p>
		<p>"You've been working nonstop. You should get away," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny rubbed her head, thinking that if Nana even had a clue as to what was
			going on inside her, she would not want her to be alone with her thoughts for
			even one minute.</p>
		<p>"No. I don't really feel like going to the park today," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana shrugged. "I'll make you a sandwich, then."</p>
		<p>Ginny opened her mouth to stop her. She wasn't hungry. But she let Nana walk
			away. She would force down the sandwich and save herself having to answer to
			Nana.</p>
		<p>"Oh, there's Kara," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny's heart fluttered in her chest and her palms grew damp as she raised
			her eyes to the door.</p>
		<p>"Well, she didn't stop," Nana said. "I guess she was out sketching."</p>
		<p>Ginny let out a sigh of relief and briefly thanked the heavens for sparing
			her. She didn't think she could face Kara. Not yet. And especially not in front
			of Nana.</p>
		<p>"I really like her, Ginny," Nana said when she brought their sandwiches.
			"Maybe we need to fix her up."</p>
		<p>"Fix her up?"</p>
		<p>"With a man," Nana explained.</p>
		<p>Ginny covered her mouth and suppressed the laughter that threatened to
			surface. Fix her up with a man?</p>
		<p>"Maybe Phil knows some nice man that would be perfect for her." Nana smiled
			sadly. "She's already thirty-four. She can't wait around for ever."</p>
		<p>"Nana, I don't think Kara would appreciate you-"</p>
		<p>"Oh, I know she said she wasn't looking, that she didn't need anyone, but I
			don't believe that for a minute. She's so attractive. If she would wear a little
			makeup and grow her hair out, she would have men lining up to ask her out."</p>
		<p>Ginny bit into her sandwich to save from answering. It was no use. Nana would
			never be convinced that a woman could be happy without a man in her life. Of
			course, Ginny could always tell Nana the truth, that Kara preferred to be with
			women.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well. I guess it's really none of my business," Nana said. "She'll be
			going back to Seattle soon, anyway."</p>
		<p>"Yes, she will," Ginny murmured. The sooner, the better, she thought.</p>
		<p>Nana fixed her eyes on Ginny. "Why haven't you called Phil?"</p>
		<p>"I . . . just haven't."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't make the man wait forever. He may lose patience and then what?
			Maybe he'll meet someone else and then who will you have?"</p>
		<p>"Nana, please don't start," Ginny pleaded.</p>
		<p>"Do I need to call him myself?"</p>
		<p>"Don't you dare!"</p>
		<p>Nana stared at her for a moment longer. "Well, I declare. Women nowadays.
			I'll never understand you."</p>
		<p>Ginny rubbed her temples, trying to ward off the headache that threatened.
			She wanted to scream out in frustration. Her nerves were on edge and she counted
			to ten before speaking.</p>
		<p>"Nana, we've been over this time and again. When I'm ready, I'll call him,"
			she said quietly. "Now, please. I don't want to talk about it."</p>
		<p>"I'm only concerned-"</p>
		<p>"I know you are," she said gently. "And I love you for it."</p>
		<p>The bell jingled and a customer came in, a stranger, and Nana got up to help
			them and Ginny closed her eyes in relief. It was one thing to be worried over
			these feelings she had for Kara, but at least that she could do silently. Nana's
			constant concern over her and Phil's relationship was slowly wearing her down
			until she was certain that she was going to snap at her.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny. If you happen to talk to Kara, ask her about Sunday," Nana
			called.</p>
		<p>"Sunday?"</p>
		<p>"You haven't forgotten? Settler's Day is Sunday," Nana reminded her. </p>
		<p>Settler's Day in the park. Ginny had forgotten. The town got together each
			year to celebrate its founding with food and drink and music. For a mere five
			dollars a person, all the burgers and fries you could eat and a glass of keg
			beer would run you only a buck. </p>
		<p>"Nana, I don't think Kara would enjoy it. I mean, it's burgers," she
			said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, pooh. There's plenty of other stuff to eat," Nana said, dismissing her
			lame excuse with a wave of her hand. "She doesn't know a soul here, Ginny. It
			would be rude if we didn't invite her."</p>
		<p>"But still . . .."</p>
		<p>"Ginny? Why in the world wouldn't you want to invite her? There'll be tons of
			tourists there. At least, we hope so," she added. "The more people, the more
			money."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled and nodded. "Okay. If I talk to her, I'll mention it," she
			conceded. But, of course, she had no intention of talking to her. Kara would
			never know about Settler's Day from her. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Fifteen">
		<p>What is it they say about the best-laid plans? Ginny couldn't remember, only
			her plan for Settler's Day had been shot out the window. She had not seen or
			spoken to Kara and she assumed that she could spend Sunday in the park without
			looking over her shoulder, worrying about where Kara was. But no. </p>
		<p>"She said she would love to come," Nana said. "And I can't believe you didn't
			call her."</p>
		<p>"I forgot," Ginny lied.</p>
		<p>"Well, she said she has been busy. That's why she hasn't been by. Imagine my
			surprise to find her on the trail," Nana said and she rambled on about meeting
			Kara at the lake and how she gotten to watch her sketch but Ginny only pretended
			to listen. It had been five days since she had seen her. Five days since she had
			kissed her. </p>
		<p>Oh, Lord! Not that again. She could almost get through the day now without
			vividly remembering her kiss, without her traitorous body still responding. Now
			she would have to see her. She would have to speak to her. Knowing Nana, she
			would insist that Kara sit and eat with them, too. </p>
		<p>"She asked about you, by the way," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny jerked her head up. "What did you say?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I told her that you had been sick that one day, but you were feeling
			better now," Nana said and Ginny closed her eyes and groaned silently. "We need
			to have her over for dinner again, too. She's much too thin," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny opened her mouth to speak, to tell Nana that, no, she didn't want Kara
			over for dinner, but Nana had turned back to the cake that she was frosting.
			Ginny rubbed her temples and sighed. She could get through it. Just one day.
			Kara wouldn't bring up the kiss, Ginny knew. If she had wanted to press the
			issue, she would have come to the store at some point during the last five
			days.</p>
		<p>And just what had Kara been thinking, anyway? Why had she stayed away? Well,
			Ginny knew why. Kara thought Ginny had been playing with her. Kara thought Ginny
			had just been curious. And she had, she told herself. That was all! But she
			hadn't been playing with her, toying with her. Ginny would never do that. She
			was not a tease. She had simply been . . . what? Attracted? No, she didn't like
			that word. She was not attracted to Kara, she stubbornly insisted. She had
			simply been experimenting. Yes, that was a much safer word! </p>
		<p>After much worrying over what to wear, Nana was finally ready to go. Ginny
			had simply shoved a T-shirt inside her shorts and found her cleanest pair of
			athletic shoes.</p>
		<p>"At my age, shorts are a bit casual," Nana complained.</p>
		<p>"Good Lord, Nana. It's a picnic. Don't wear a dress."</p>
		<p>"I'd hate for people to talk," she said, but she eyed the pair of shorts that
			Ginny had laid on her bed.</p>
		<p>"Everyone will have shorts on. Now quit worrying," Ginny said. "And wear your
			walking shoes, too."</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny, are you sure?"</p>
		<p>Ginny had rolled her eyes to the ceiling and nodded. Nana was always
			concerned with what other people thought.</p>
		<p>They loaded the two cakes and the bowl of potato salad that they had
			volunteered to make into Nana's car and Ginny drove through town, now crowded
			with cars, and made their way to the park.</p>
		<p>"Looks like a lot of people in town today," Nana said. "Maybe we'll have a
			good crowd this year."</p>
		<p>"Well, the weather is gorgeous," Ginny said. And it was. Clear, blue skies
			beckoned and not even a hint of a breeze. Perfect summer weather.</p>
		<p>"I hope Kara can find us," Nana said.</p>
		<p>I hope she doesn't, Ginny thought. Oh, but that was cruel. She liked Kara,
			she really did. If it wasn't for . . . well, if it wasn't for what had happened
			between them, she thought that they could be good friends. That they were
			friends. But Ginny had ruined that with her . . . experiment.</p>
		<p>The park was beginning to fill and they left the car in the shade of a giant
			spruce. Ginny balanced the two cakes while Nana carried the pie. Nana called out
			to friends as they passed and she actually blushed when Mr. Arnold complimented
			her outfit.</p>
		<p>"See, I told you people would notice," Nana said quietly.</p>
		<p>"It was a compliment," Ginny said with a laugh. "Besides, he had on
			shorts."</p>
		<p>"Well, that's different," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed. "Oh, yes. He's a man. He can be comfortable."</p>
		<p>"Ginny!"</p>
		<p>"Oh, Nana. You look great. Quit worrying."</p>
		<p>But Ginny was the one worrying. She looked around, fearing that Kara would be
			there, waiting. The men were already heating the assorted grills, getting ready
			for burgers and a small crowd had gathered by the kegs of beer, but there was no
			sign of Kara. She breathed a sigh of relief, thankful she had been spared for at
			least a little longer.</p>
		<p>Nana mingled with her friends and Ginny walked off, avoiding the children
			that ran and played in the park. A temporary stage had been set up and the band
			was already there, tuning their guitars, getting ready for later. Vendors had
			set up their goods in booths along the street and Ginny thought it looked more
			like a flea market than a picnic, but still, it brought money into the town.</p>
		<p>Ginny turned around and made her way back to where she had left Nana and her
			heart jumped into her throat. Kara was there, talking with Nana, laughing at
			something Nana had said and Ginny stopped and stared. They hadn't seen her, Kara
			hadn't seen her, and she let her eyes travel over Kara slowly, and as she did,
			each moment that she had stood in Kara's arms came back to her with vivid
			clarity. She could still imagine her mouth on her, still taste her, still feel
			her tongue as it slid over her own. </p>
		<p>She groaned and slammed her eyes shut, willing her thoughts away. She opened
			them again and made herself move. Nana looked up and waved and Ginny forced a
			smile to her lips as she walked up.</p>
		<p>"Look who I found," Nana said.</p>
		<p>There was a moment of awkward silence between them as their eyes collided,
			then Kara smiled and turned back to Nana.</p>
		<p>"I didn't realize this was such a big deal," she said.</p>
		<p>"Well, I don't know if it's the burgers or the dollar beer that draws them,"
			Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Or maybe the cake you were mentioning," Kara said. She looked up at Ginny
			then. "How have you been?" she asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny swallowed nervously and nodded. "Okay."</p>
		<p>Kara nodded, too. </p>
		<p>"Have you been working?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes. A lot," she said. "I've been out every morning and evening. The
			sunrises have been beautiful."</p>
		<p>"I was telling Kara that she should take you out some morning for the
			sunrise. You've seen her sketch in the evening, but the lake she did this
			morning was just beautiful," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny's eyes widened and she glanced at Kara, but her eyes revealed nothing,
			only slight amusement at Nana's words.</p>
		<p>"Well, you know me . . . I'm not exactly a morning person," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, pooh. You should do it once. She's very good," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, knowing perfectly well how good she was and she wasn't thinking
			about sketching. She swallowed again, feeling Kara's eyes on her but when she
			looked up, Kara was looking at Nana. Ginny was thankful. She didn't want to have
			to look at her. She couldn't. Not when she still felt . . . something.
			Attracted, her body screamed, but she ignored that. No, not attracted to her.
			Just . . . something.</p>
		<p>But Kara was being kind, wasn't she? There was no hint in her words or
			actions that there had ever been even the slightest indiscretion on Ginny's
			part. Ginny frowned. Had she spent the last five days worrying over nothing? Had
			their kiss affected Kara so little that she had not even given it a second
			thought? No. Ginny remembered that night all too well. She remembered the look
			in Kara's eyes. She remembered her words. "I want you." </p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?" Ginny murmured, glancing at Nana.</p>
		<p>"I said you should take Kara to get a beer. And bring me an iced tea, please.
			I'm going to help the ladies cut the cakes." Nana left them standing there and
			Ginny looked nervously at Kara.</p>
		<p>"You want one?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes, please."</p>
		<p>They walked off silently, leaving ample space between them and Ginny cursed
			her nervousness. What did she think? That Kara would sweep her into her arms and
			continue what they had started that night? Lord, she felt her pulse pounding in
			her throat and it was wrecking havoc on her senses. She was having a hard time
			breathing and she opened her mouth slightly, gulping in fresh air.</p>
		<p>Kara shoved her hands in her shorts and stared ahead, not daring to look at
			Ginny. She could tell Ginny was uncomfortable. Hell, she was uncomfortable,
			herself. They should talk. They should have talked before today, she realized.
		</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"If I said I'm sorry-"</p>
		<p>"Why should you be sorry?" Ginny asked. "I'm the one who should apologize.
			I'm the one who started it," she said quietly. "And I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>"Okay."</p>
		<p>Ginny turned and dared to look into her eyes. "Kara, I never meant . . . I
			wasn't playing with you. I wouldn't do that."</p>
		<p>Kara nodded and Ginny pulled her eyes away. </p>
		<p>"I wasn't going to come today, but Louise insisted," Kara explained. "I know
			you'd be more comfortable if I weren't here."</p>
		<p>"I'm . . . okay," Ginny said. "I've practically forgotten about it,
			actually," she lied. </p>
		<p>"Good. Me, too," Kara said easily. </p>
		<p>Ginny bit her lower lip. So, it had meant nothing to Kara, after all. She
			probably did that sort of thing all the time. Straight women, just like herself,
			were probably always . . . experimenting with Kara. Oh, Jesus, stop it! You want
			her to forget it, don't you? </p>
		<p>"Let me buy you a beer," Ginny said and she dug into her pockets for money.
			"Hi, Matt. Two, please," she said.</p>
		<p>"How you doing, Ginny?" he asked.</p>
		<p>"Fine. How's Jean?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, she's ready to drop any minute," he said. "Her ankles are swollen so she
			didn't make it." </p>
		<p>"This will be number four?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes. We'll keep trying until we have a boy," he said as he handed them the
			beer.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Matt. Tell Jean I said hello."</p>
		<p>"Will do."</p>
		<p>They walked off and Ginny rolled her eyes. "Four. Can you imagine?"</p>
		<p>"No. Let's hope it's a boy, for Jean's sake," Kara said and she winked at
			Ginny and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Really," Ginny agreed, trying to ignore the fluttering in her stomach.</p>
		<p>They found Nana and gave her the iced tea she had requested, then she waved
			them away.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, show Kara some of the booths. They usually have art, although I doubt
			it's in the same class as hers," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "Louise, I'm hardly famous."</p>
		<p>"Nonsense," she said. "You've been in a magazine. That's famous." She went
			back to her cake. "Don't linger, though," she called. "I'll save us a
			table."</p>
		<p>Ginny chuckled and led Kara away, shaking her head. Nana was a handful!</p>
		<p>"She's something else," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"Yes. And she thinks the world of you, by the way," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>Kara raised her eyebrows and smiled. "I take it, she hasn't actually read the
			article?"</p>
		<p>"No. She knows nothing about your . . . personal life," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Good."</p>
		<p>"She would never understand," Ginny added.</p>
		<p>"I know."</p>
		<p>They walked along the booths, pausing occasionally to pick up some of the
			crafts that were displayed. There were a few paintings and Kara studied them
			while Ginny studied her. It was safer to look when Kara wasn't aware, Ginny
			thought. And she did look. Try as she may, she could not stop her eyes from
			moving over her body, up her tan legs, past her shorts and coming to a sudden
			halt at the familiar tank top tucked inside. It was painfully obvious to her
			that Kara wore no bra and her eyes refused to move away from her breasts. Her
			breath caught and she swallowed with difficulty, finally raising her eyes, then
			blushing crimson when Kara caught her staring.</p>
		<p>Kara held Ginny's eyes captive for several embarrassing seconds, then, with
			an arch of one eyebrow, she released her.</p>
		<p>Ginny breathed again and she dared not look at Kara. What is wrong with
			you?</p>
		<p>She felt totally out of control and her hands were trembling as she brought
			her beer cup to her lips. God, she was looking at a woman's breast! Had she lost
			her mind?</p>
		<p>"I think I need another beer," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"Me, too," Ginny murmured. She was hot and she knew it had nothing to do with
			the summer day!</p>
		<p>They found Nana sitting at a table, two seats saved for them and Kara waited
			politely for Ginny to slide along the bench seat first.</p>
		<p>"What do you think?" Nana asked Kara.</p>
		<p>"I like it. It's fun," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny was all too aware of the woman sitting next to her to participate in
			the conversation. Her skin burned where Kara's leg brushed her thigh and she
			couldn't stop her pulse from racing through her veins. She tried to think of
			Phil, she tried to recall how it was to kiss him, to make love with him, but
			nothing would come to her. The memory of Kara's kiss pushed Phil from her mind
			and Ginny felt herself grow warm as she recalled standing by the lake, moving
			into Kara's arms, her mouth opening to Kara, her own tongue pushing wildly into
			Kara's mouth.</p>
		<p>"Oh," she groaned softly and she closed her eyes tight.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
		<p>"Are you okay?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny looked across the table at Nana and felt herself blush hotly. "I'm
			fine," she said. "Just a little hot," she murmured.</p>
		<p>"It is quite warm today. I'm so glad I wore shorts," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny tried to listen as Nana told Kara about their morning but her mind was
			on the leg that pressed gently against her own. Good Lord, I can't stand it!
			What was Kara doing to her? Did she not have any idea of the effect she was
			having on Ginny? Ginny sighed, savoring the feeling of Kara's bare leg pressed
			against her own. She refused to wonder why she didn't move away from that warm
			touch.</p>
		<p>Ginny was so thankful when the food was ready, she stood behind Kara and Nana
			in line, listening to Nana ramble on, meeting Kara's amused eyes occasionally.
			How could Kara act like nothing had happened between them? How could she be so
			unaffected by it all? </p>
		<p>Because she's a lesbian. She's used to kissing other women! Ginny slammed her
			eyes shut. Well, she was not a lesbian and she was not used to kissing other
			women and it was driving her absolutely crazy! God, her skin crawled just being
			near Kara and she just wanted the day to be over and for Kara to go away again
			and leave her in peace.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"Are you okay?" Kara whispered.</p>
		<p>"No, I'm not," she admitted. Her eyes flew to Kara's and she wished she had
			not looked. She couldn't pull away and she felt her chest heave as she tried to
			catch her breath. "I can't be around you like this," she whispered.</p>
		<p>She saw a brief flash of understanding cross Kara's eyes before she nodded.
			"I know. I'm sorry," Kara said softly. "It's my fault. I shouldn't have
			come."</p>
		<p>"No. It's . . .."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, look, there's Mr. and Mrs. Dower. You remember them?" Nana called to
			the Dower's but they didn't hear her. "Oh, I'll have to look them up later. You
			were just a teenager the last time they saw you," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"I remember them," Ginny said absently, her eyes still locked with
			Kara's.</p>
		<p>They took their plates back to the table, Kara's loaded high with nothing but
			fries and two pieces of cake, and Ginny was again forced to endure sitting close
			to Kara.</p>
		<p>"Oh, the band's good this year, Ginny," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Although she had hardly been listening. She ate in silence, her mind
			far away from the conversation between Kara and Nana. </p>
		<p>Kara gathered up their plates when they had all finished eating and went for
			more beer and Ginny looked up and smiled at Nana.</p>
		<p>"Having a good time?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Wonderful," Nana said. "But are you?"</p>
		<p>"Of course."</p>
		<p>"You've been awfully quiet," Nana said. "Are you not feeling well?"</p>
		<p>"I feel fine," Ginny said. Why, oh why must Nana always notice?</p>
		<p>"Do you think Kara's having a good time?"</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded. "I think so." Was she? It was hard to tell. Kara, too, had been
			quiet. </p>
		<p>"Here you go," Kara said, balancing two cups of beer and an iced tead in her
			hands. Ginny reached out to help her and when their hands touched, she trembled
			from the electricity between them, spilling beer on the table.</p>
		<p>"God, I'm sorry," she murmured, mopping up the spill with her napkin.</p>
		<p>"It's okay."</p>
		<p>She couldn't stand it. Not another minute. They had to talk. This was slowly
			driving her insane, this . . . attraction, yes, okay, attraction, that she had
			for Kara. And she could not stand it a second longer. She needed to . . . what?
			Talk? Yes, she needed to talk to her about it. She was so confused inside. Her
			traitorous body screamed for release but her mind refused to listen to it. This
			couldn't be happening to her. She was not a lesbian!</p>
		<p>Ginny leaned toward Kara, speaking softly so that Nana would not hear. "We
			need to talk." When Kara looked at her, she added, "I need to talk."</p>
		<p>"Okay," Kara agreed. "Why don't we take a drive?"</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded and turned to Nana. "We're going to walk around a bit, Nana.
			You'll be okay here?"</p>
		<p>"Of course. You run along."</p>
		<p>They walked towards Kara's Land Cruiser without speaking and Ginny wondered
			what in the world she would say to Kara. She only wished for one thing; that her
			heart wouldn't pound so whenever Kara was near.</p>
		<p>Kara opened the door for Ginny and she crawled inside, remembering the last
			time she had been in Kara's truck. They had been driving back, after The Kiss.
			They had not spoken. Not one word. Kara had stopped in front of the house and
			Ginny had nearly run from the truck then.</p>
		<p>"Where to?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"It doesn't matter," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>Kara drove slowly down the deserted streets and she reached into the console,
			fishing out her crumpled pack of cigarettes. She shoved one into her mouth, then
			glanced at Ginny.</p>
		<p>"You don't mind, do you?"</p>
		<p>"Of course not," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara inhaled deeply, letting the smoke settle in her lungs, calming her. So,
			Ginny wanted to talk. Great. Just what she wanted to do. Talk about how she had
			kissed her and screwed up her life.</p>
		<p>"Why don't we go to my house?" Ginny said. "We can sit and talk, then."</p>
		<p>Kara hesitated. The last thing they needed was to be alone in Ginny's house.
			But she nodded anyway. </p>
		<p>Ginny walked quickly ahead of Kara, suddenly nervous at being alone with her.
			Maybe they should have kept driving and talked in the truck. She wrapped her
			arms around herself and turned to Kara as soon as the door was closed.</p>
		<p>"I can't stop thinking about it," she said quickly. "What's happening to
			me?"</p>
		<p>"Ginny, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have ever . . .."</p>
		<p>"I . . . begged you to," Ginny reminded her. "And now, I can't stop thinking
			about it." She turned away from Kara, unable to look at her. "I've never thought
			about a woman before, not like this." She remembered Renee. No, it had never
			been like this with Renee. She would not have allowed it. But maybe, if she'd
			continued to see her, it might have evolved into a sexual attraction. Who was
			she kidding? It was a sexual attraction. She just couldn't admit it at the time.
		</p>
		<p>"Ginny, I don't know what you want me to say."</p>
		<p>Ginny met blue eyes filled with regret and she shook her head slowly. It
			wasn't Kara's fault.</p>
		<p>"There was a woman once," Ginny said quietly. "I was just out of college. She
			was my boss. At the time, I thought it was just friendship. We spent a lot of
			time together but I wouldn't allow my feelings to grow into something else. She
			wanted more but I couldn't . . . I didn't know. I met Phil shortly after
			that."</p>
		<p>Kara caught her breath. This, she was not expecting.</p>
		<p>"But I'm not a lesbian," she whispered. "I'm . . . just not. I don't want
			these feelings."</p>
		<p>"Okay. You're not," Kara said, trying to say the words that she thought Ginny
			wanted to hear. "Maybe you're just questioning your love for Phil and this was .
			. . something to try."</p>
		<p>"Is that what you think?" Ginny asked. It could be true. She wanted it to be
			true. Kara moved closer and stood in front of her. "Ginny, it was just a kiss. I
			didn't touch you," she said. "We weren't even close to . . . anything."</p>
		<p>"Weren't we?" Ginny whispered. She felt as if she were in a dream. Her eyes
			clouded and all she could see were the two of them, as they had been that night.
			She remembered Kara's hands resting just under her breasts. She remembered how
			her body had begged for Kara's hands to move, how it had begged for Kara to
			touch her breasts. She remembered how she had imagined Kara's mouth on them, how
			she had imagined Kara's hands . . . on her, her fingers inside her. She raised
			her eyes to Kara's and she felt the rise and fall of her chest as she tried to
			keep pace with her uneven breathing. She didn't understand the burning need that
			was consuming her body, moving through her with each uneven breath, settling at
			the pit of her stomach and demanding relief. </p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . please don't look at me that way," Kara whispered. </p>
		<p>Ginny swallowed down the lump in her throat but her eyes refused to leave
			Kara's. "This is madness, what I'm feeling," Ginny murmured. Her tongue came out
			and wet her lips and Kara's eyes followed. Ginny moaned low in her throat from
			the look in Kara's eyes and she took a step towards her.</p>
		<p>"Kiss me again," she begged. "Show me that there's nothing here, Kara. Show
			me that I just imagined it all."</p>
		<p>Kara shook her head, no, but Ginny's hands were already touching her, already
			moving up her arms to her neck. "Kara, please," she whispered as she was drawn
			to Kara's warm body.</p>
		<p>Kara couldn't have refused even if Louise had chosen that moment to walk in
			on them. Her hands went quickly to Ginny's face and she cupped her, pulling
			Ginny's mouth to hers. Ginny's lips were parted and wet and Kara devoured them
			hungrily, her resolve having vanished with the brush of Ginny's tongue against
			her own.</p>
		<p>Ginny's hands gripped hard at Kara's shoulders and she was certain that she
			was going to pass out from the intensity of it all. Blood pounded in her ears
			and she couldn't breathe. Then Kara's mouth turned gentle and she could breathe
			again and she wanted to breathe Kara in. Her hands moved over Kara's back and
			she pressed her body close, her hips moving instinctively against Kara.</p>
		<p>"Dear God, Kara," she whispered, when she was finally able to pull away,
			finally able to take her lips from Kara's. Barely.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Kara murmured and she tried to pull back but Ginny held her.</p>
		<p>"Don't stop," Ginny pleaded and her mouth went back for more. One more kiss,
			one more touch of her tongue. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, no," Kara said. She held Ginny at arms length. "What are we doing?"
			she whispered.</p>
		<p>Ginny stood there, her breathing rapid as she looked at Kara. "I know I
			shouldn't feel this way, but I do." She reached out and took one of Kara's hands
			and brought it to her breasts without thinking. "Oh, Jesus," she murmured. "Oh
			my God." Her eyes slid shut as she felt Kara's hand close over her breast, when
			she felt Kara's thumb caress her erect nipple.</p>
		<p>Kara's mind screamed for her to stop but her body wouldn't listen. Both hands
			now cupped Ginny's breasts and her mouth found a throbbing vein in the soft neck
			that was exposed.</p>
		<p>Ginny pressed closer, desire crowding out all other thoughts. Her dreams
			didn't do justice to the pleasure that Kara brought to her. It was through a
			deep fog that she felt her shirt being pulled from her shorts, felt warm hands
			touch her hot skin. She didn't stop the hands that moved over her flesh, hands
			that impatiently shoved her bra away.</p>
		<p>Kara had to have her mouth there. She had lost all sense of propriety. She no
			longer cared if what they were doing was wrong or not.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Kara, yes," Ginny breathed when she felt a wet tongue rake across her
			nipple. She pulled Kara closer, gasping when Kara's hot mouth closed over her,
			gently sucking at her nipple, driving her insane with desire. Her eyes slammed
			shut as she held Kara to her breast. Her legs parted instinctively and pressed
			down hard on Kara's thigh.</p>
		<p>It was only then, when desire shot through her, right to her center, making
			her press harder against Kara, that she realized how far they had gone, had
			quickly she had lost control. It was only then that fear replaced desire. </p>
		<p>"No," she whispered. "No, Kara."</p>
		<p>Kara immediately pulled away, her eyes clouded with desire.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry, Ginny," she said quickly, moving away from Ginny, away
			from temptation. She ran both hands through her short hair and groaned softly.
			"I didn't mean to go that far."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, too," Ginny whispered before tears closed up her throat. She
			could say no more.</p>
		<p>"Please don't do this," Kara begged. "Please don't cry. This is all my fault.
			I let it go too far."</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head but still, no words would come. She sat down heavily on
			the sofa and pulled her T-shirt down. Her hands were shaking and she covered her
			face with them.</p>
		<p>"Please, Ginny," Kara pleaded. </p>
		<p>Ginny finally lifted her tear-stained face to Kara and she was shocked by the
			genuine regret she found there.</p>
		<p>"I think I just want you to go now, Kara." At the anguish that crossed Kara's
			face, Ginny reached out a hand and captured Kara's fingers. "I just need to be
			alone and sort this all out. I'm not angry with you. I can't be angry with you
			when I'm the one that wanted this."</p>
		<p>"I wanted it, too," Kara whispered.</p>
		<p>"I know. That's what scares me so."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Sixteen">
		<p>Ginny laid in bed for a long time, waiting on sleep to come. She draped one
			arm across her eyes, wanting to hide from the humiliation she felt. What Kara
			must think of her. She was a tease, she admitted. Nothing but a damn tease. But
			it wasn't intentional, she thought. It wasn't. She had simply lost control. In
			Kara's presence, she seemed to do that a lot.</p>
		<p>Had Kara's mouth really been at her breast or had she imagined it? Yes, and
			her nipples hardened now at the thought of it. For a moment, she had simply lost
			herself in Kara's touch. For a moment, she had just let go and let her feelings
			have full reign.</p>
		<p>But she had come to her senses, thank God, and Kara had stopped when she
			asked her to. What was it that she wanted from Kara? What did she need from her?
		</p>
		<p>"I want to make love with her," Ginny whispered. "I do. I want all of
			her."</p>
		<p>She turned her head into the pillow, willing these feelings to go away. She
			didn't want to want Kara. She didn't want to have these feelings for a
			woman.</p>
		<p>But she did. She couldn't deny them any longer. It was driving her insane.
			Tomorrow, she would go to her. She would go to Kara and beg her to make love to
			her if she had to. Kara had wanted her tonight, Ginny knew that. She could feel
			that, see that in her eyes. Maybe Kara could give her the release that her body
			craved.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Seventeen">
		<p>Ginny stood nervously beside her car, her eyes wide. Her legs were shaking
			and she wasn't sure she could even walk to the cabin. She swallowed, her hand
			reaching back to the car. Maybe she should just leave. Maybe this was a mistake.
			Why was she in such a hurry to disrupt her life? To change everything? And it
			would. She could never go back to the life she had.</p>
		<p>But she wasn't happy with her life. Was she? Hadn't she been searching all
			these years? Searching for what, she hadn't known. Not until she met Kara,
			anyway. Now she knew.
			<i>I want her.</i>
		</p>
		<p>She walked to the door, her hand trembling as she knocked lightly. She heard
			footsteps then Kara was there, holding the door open.</p>
		<p>Their eyes collided and her breath caught in her chest. Kara stood barefoot
			before her, an old paint-stained T-shirt hanging out over faded blue shorts.
		</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . what are you doing here?" she asked softly.</p>
		<p>"I had to come. You knew I would," she accused. They stared, neither making
			an attempt to move. "May I come in?" she finally asked.</p>
		<p>Kara stepped back, letting Ginny pass and she shut the door behind her.</p>
		<p>"I've been thinking . . . thinking about us," Ginny said quietly. She turned
			around and gasped. Hot desire burned in Kara's eyes.</p>
		<p>"You shouldn't have come," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"I want you," Ginny said simply. </p>
		<p>"No. I can't do this," Kara said. "I won't stop the next time."</p>
		<p>"I don't want you to stop," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, listen to what you're saying."</p>
		<p>"Please . . . you're not going to make me beg, are you?"</p>
		<p>"You don't know what you're doing," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"No, you're right. I don't. And I'm scared to death."</p>
		<p>Kara laughed nervously. "Then why?"</p>
		<p>"I want you, Kara. I want to make love with you," she said quietly and she
			watched as Kara nervously swallowed. </p>
		<p>"I don't want you to hate me, Ginny . . . and you will."</p>
		<p>. "No, I won't. You want me, too. I can see that in your eyes," Ginny
			whispered.</p>
		<p>Kara moved to her and took her hands. "Yes, I want you. I just don't want to
			hurt you." And I don't want you to hurt me, she added silently.</p>
		<p>"I want you to be the one, Kara. I want you to show me." Ginny's hands
			gripped Kara's tightly. "Please?"</p>
		<p>Kara left her protest unspoken. Ginny's eyes were begging and Kara ignored
			the warning bells in her head and she lowered her mouth and captured Ginny's
			lips, lips that opened under hers. She felt Ginny's hands tremble as they
			clutched her arms and Kara pulled her mouth away.</p>
		<p>"Don't be scared," Kara begged.</p>
		<p>"I am. I'm scared to death. I don't know what to do," she said. "How to touch
			you."</p>
		<p>"I'll show you," Kara said softly. Her hands cupped Ginny's face and her kiss
			was soft, gentle. But when Ginny's tongue came out to meet hers, Kara's mouth
			turned hungry and she moaned against Ginny's mouth, taking her tongue
			inside.</p>
		<p>Their breath came fast and they pulled away, both their chests heaving with
			their desire. Ginny reached up and touched Kara's clinched jaw, soothing her.
		</p>
		<p>"You're scared, too," Ginny said with awe.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>"I don't want this to be a mistake," Kara whispered.</p>
		<p>"It would be a mistake to ignore this attraction."</p>
		<p>Kara took Ginny's hand and led her into the bedroom. The afternoon sun was
			gone, leaving the room in shadows. Ginny stood still, but her hands shook
			uncontrollably in Kara's. She had never been more nervous in all her life.</p>
		<p>Kara knew this was probably a mistake but she couldn't stop it. Not this
			time. She wanted what was about to happen. Her hands went to Ginny's waist and
			she tugged her shirt from her shorts.</p>
		<p>Ginny's breath poured from her as Kara pulled the shirt over her head. Ginny
			raised her eyes to Kara's as Kara unsnapped her bra and Ginny let it fall to the
			floor. She stood and watched as Kara's face softened and she saw that Kara's
			hands were trembling, too, as they reached out to touch her. But her hands
			stopped, just a breath away and Ginny saw Kara squeeze her eyes shut
			tightly.</p>
		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, God, I . . . I just want you so much," she murmured. She needed to go
			slow, despite the ache in her. She finally cupped Ginny's full breasts with
			gentle hands.</p>
		<p>Ginny murmured a sigh and closed her eyes, her body melting under Kara's soft
			caress. She gasped when Kara's warm mouth covered her erect peak, taking the
			nipple inside and Ginny's hands went to Kara's face and she held her there, her
			head bent back, eyes closed tightly. So different from Phil, she thought
			crazily. Oh, and it felt so good. As she knew it would. Her legs would not
			support her a minute longer and she collapsed on the bed, weak from Kara's
			mouth.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?" Kara asked with uncertainty.</p>
		<p>"Come to me," Ginny said softly. "Please?"</p>
		<p>Kara's breath caught at her soft plea and she moved and stood by the bed,
			pulling Ginny's face into her. She wanted her so badly, she had to force herself
			to go slow. She didn't want to scare Ginny but she wanted her more than she
			could ever remember wanting before.</p>
		<p>Ginny was calm as she reached out and slipped her hands under Kara's shirt,
			moving to her warm waist, touching her bare skin for the first time. Her
			composure vanished, however, when Kara took her hands and moved them to her
			breasts.</p>
		<p>"Touch me," Kara commanded softly.</p>
		<p>Ginny's fingers touched her hard nipples, then closed over her breasts, each
			fitting easily in her hands. So soft, she thought. So unlike a man. She groaned,
			wanting to touch them with her mouth and she shoved Kara's shirt up, pulling
			Kara into her waiting mouth.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny," Kara whispered and she pulled the shirt over her head quickly,
			standing silently before her as Ginny's mouth moved to her other breast. Ginny's
			hands went to her shorts and fumbled with the button.</p>
		<p>"Take these off, please," Ginny begged. She wanted to touch her bare skin.
			She wanted to see her naked. Kara let her shorts fall to the floor and Ginny
			held her breath, overcome with desire for this woman. She was so thin, but her
			small breasts were full, erect and Ginny reached out, but Kara captured her
			hand.</p>
		<p>"Now, you," she said and reached for Ginny's waistband, unbuttoning her
			shorts with ease and pulling them down Ginny's hips.</p>
		<p>Ginny laid still, feeling her heart pounding and fearing she would surely
			pass out when Kara finally came to her. But her arms welcomed Kara, moving over
			her shoulders and pulling her close as Kara laid her naked body on top of Ginny,
			molding herself to Ginny.</p>
		<p>"Oh . . .." Ginny shut her eyes, guiding Kara's mouth to hers. It was slow.
			Slower than she could ever have imagined and her hands caressed Kara's warm
			back, savoring each kiss, each brush of their tongues. Then their slow
			exploration turned hungry as lips claimed the other and Ginny moaned as Kara's
			tongue went inside her mouth, exploring with warm wetness.</p>
		<p>When Kara slid lower, Ginny's hands guided her to her breasts and she groaned
			softly when Kara sucked hungrily on her. Her legs opened instinctively and Kara
			settled between them, pressing into her and Ginny rose up to meet her, aching to
			be touched by her. She trembled when Kara's hand moved over her waist and her
			breath caught when Kara's fingers ran through her soft triangle of hair, so
			close to her desire.</p>
		<p>"Yes," she breathed. "Please. I need you to touch me," Ginny begged. She had
			dreamed of this moment all her life and she couldn't suppress the cry that tore
			from her lips when Kara's fingers slid into her wetness.</p>
		<p>Kara wanted to take her. She wanted her fingers deep inside. Ginny was so wet
			to her touch, she could hardly make herself slow down. She wanted to shove
			Ginny's legs apart and bury her face in her wetness and she groaned against
			Ginny's breast, making her fingers slow even when Ginny's hips moved frantically
			beneath her. </p>
		<p>"Kara," Ginny murmured. "Oh, God . . . Kara." It was heavenly, this woman's
			soft touch upon her. </p>
		<p>Kara was lost, hearing her name uttered so beautifully from Ginny's lips and
			she pulled her fingers away. Ginny whimpered but Kara moved to her mouth and
			silenced her, kissing her hard.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I can't wait," Kara murmured. "I want you too much."</p>
		<p>She slid down her body, her hands urging Ginny's legs apart. </p>
		<p>"What . . . what are you doing?" Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>"Shhh."</p>
		<p>Ginny saw her intention and she gasped, clutching at Kara's shoulders even as
			her warm mouth left wet kisses in its wake. </p>
		<p>Kara moved down and quickly covered Ginny with her mouth, her groan mingling
			with Ginny's as she tasted her.</p>
		<p>"Oh . . . God." Ginny's hips pressed against Kara's face and she thought she
			would surely die from pleasure. Her vision swam and she shut her eyes as Kara's
			tongue moved over her. Sweet Jesus, she thought. No one had ever loved her this
			way. Phil had never even tried. Is this how women make love? She didn't think
			she could stand another second and when Kara's tongue plunged deep inside her,
			she cried out, her hands clasping Kara's head to her hard. Yes, oh yes. Her body
			trembled from deep within and Kara's mouth tugged at her, her tongue stroking
			her fast and Ginny exploded in a burst of color, her eyes blinded by the
			intensity of her orgasm. She screamed, her mouth open wide and her hips rocked
			with Kara. She felt her body draining, as if Kara were sucking the life from her
			limbs and she finally collapsed, her arms dropping limply to her sides as tears
			streamed from her eyes. </p>
		<p>She tried to roll over, embarrassed, but her body wouldn't move and she laid
			there, sobs wracking her shoulders.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? God, did I hurt you?" Kara moved beside her and took her in her
			arms.</p>
		<p>Ginny clutched her, squeezing her eyes shut. She buried her head in Kara's
			shoulder, unable to stop her tears.</p>
		<p>"What is it?"</p>
		<p>"Never . . . no one's ever . . . I've never . . .." She gave up and Kara held
			her, her hands gently soothing her, caressing her hair.</p>
		<p>"Oh, God," Ginny mumbled. "I didn't think it was possible," she said.</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"How you made me feel," she said softly. "No one's . . .."</p>
		<p>"No one's made love to you that way before?" Kara asked gently.</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head, embarrassed.</p>
		<p>"Then I'm glad I'm the first," Kara said. </p>
		<p>Ginny kissed Kara softly, tasting herself on Kara's lips. "Show me how to
			touch you," she said.</p>
		<p>"Do I need to show you?"</p>
		<p>"I want you to feel what I did," Ginny said. </p>
		<p>"You know I will."</p>
		<p>Ginny watched her, meeting her eyes, seeing them cloud with desire. And she
			remembered what Kara had told her once. That women knew how to touch women. She
			wanted to give Kara pleasure like she had never wanted before. </p>
		<p>Her hands were confident as they moved to Kara's breasts. "Lay back," she
			said. Her mouth moved over Kara's face, touching her lips lightly, nipping at
			her neck before finding her breast. She took the swollen nipple into her mouth
			and she felt Kara shudder in her arms. And, Lord, how wonderful it felt to have
			this woman's breast in her mouth. Yes, she wanted to give this woman pleasure.
			Her hands and mouth moved as if she'd done this hundreds of times before. She
			felt Kara's body respond to her and she pressed her weight into Kara, her hips
			meeting Kara's in a rhythm as old as time. Her body knew what to do, even if she
			didn't and her hand moved between them, needing to touch Kara, needing to feel
			her warmth. </p>
		<p>She moaned softly when Kara took her hand and placed it between her thighs.
			Kara's wetness enveloped her and Ginny's fingers moved into her, sliding wetly
			over her, into her.</p>
		<p>"Yes," Kara murmured quietly. "Like that."</p>
		<p>And she was so wet, Ginny's hand was dripping with her and she matched Kara's
			rhythm, her hand moving with the motion of Kara's hips. The scent of her drifted
			to Ginny and she knew she wanted her mouth on her. She wanted to taste her. She
			had to taste her. She wanted to feel Kara moving under her mouth.</p>
		<p>"I want you," Ginny whispered. "I want all of you." </p>
		<p>With a desire so strong she couldn't control it, her mouth quickly replaced
			her fingers and she groaned loudly as she tasted Kara's sweetness for the first
			time. She thought foolishly that she didn't know what she was doing, that she
			couldn't possibly be giving Kara pleasure, but Kara's hands urged her on,
			pressing her face back to her.</p>
		<p>"Yes, please. Don't stop," Kara whispered.</p>
		<p>Ginny's tongue moved over her, around her, and Kara's soft sighs washed over
			her. Ginny buried her face again into her wetness, sucking her into her mouth,
			hearing Kara cry out softly and her own pleasure surged through her, threatening
			to explode again. Her tongue stroked her quickly and she felt Kara's hips still
			as she rose off the bed and then Kara clutched Ginny's head with her hands and
			arched into her. </p>
		<p>"Ginny!" The word was torn from her mouth and Kara cried out.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt Kara throb against her tongue and she gasped as her own orgasm
			came swiftly over her again.</p>
		<p>Kara gathered Ginny to her, kissing her face, her eyes, her lips. "You're a
			beautiful lover, Ginny," she whispered. "So beautiful."</p>
		<p>Ginny felt on the verge of tears again. In all the years with Phil, he had
			never once said those words to her. She couldn't speak now and she snuggled
			close to Kara, feeling her lips move over her face.</p>
		<p>"I wanted you so much," Ginny said. "Like that. I've wanted you since that
			first kiss," she admitted to Kara and to herself.</p>
		<p>"I know."</p>
		<p>"I had an orgasm and you weren't even touching me," Ginny confessed.</p>
		<p>"I know," Kara said again, softly.</p>
		<p>"Is it always like that? With women?"</p>
		<p>Kara smiled. When was the last time she'd felt this way?</p>
		<p>Ginny leaned up on her elbow, gazing into Kara's eyes. "Is it?"</p>
		<p>"It might be for you."</p>
		<p>"Is it for you?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"No," Kara admitted. "It's not often like this for me." </p>
		<p>Ginny lay back down, satisfied. She took Kara's hand and held it as she
			snuggled against her, against her warmth. "I don't reach an orgasm very
			often."</p>
		<p>"With Phil?" Kara asked gently.</p>
		<p>"No. Not very often," she admitted. "Seldom, actually."</p>
		<p>"Maybe . . .."</p>
		<p>"No. I wouldn't want him that way," Ginny said. "I wouldn't want him to do
			that," she whispered. And she knew that she would never let Phil love her that
			way. It could only be Kara. </p>
		<p>Kara knew they should talk, but her hands wouldn't still. Desire flamed again
			and she wondered if she would ever tire of touching her. She captured Ginny's
			breast with her mouth and felt Ginny's hands move through her hair, holding her,
			murmuring soft words as Kara sucked hungrily at her breast. Was she responsive
			like this with Phil? Did he not know what he had? No. Men seldom did.</p>
		<p>Ginny's body flamed under Kara's touch and she wanted Kara's mouth on her
			again, but her orgasm shook her so suddenly when Kara's fingers slid over her,
			she clutched Kara's hand between her thighs, refusing to let it go.</p>
		<p>This give and take was so new to Ginny, and her confidence grew with each
			touch. She knew instinctively how to touch Kara and her hands moved over her,
			into her wetness and she watched Kara's face as she cried out her name again,
			her body pulsing against her fingers. She pulled away, wanting her mouth there
			again and she moved between Kara's legs, her tongue reaching out to her.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .." Kara said softly.</p>
		<p>"I just want to . . . feel you again . . . with my mouth," Ginny murmured
			against her.</p>
		<p>Kara drew in a deep breath, her body numb and she laid back, letting Ginny
			move over her. When Ginny's arms wrapped around her hips, pushing Kara's legs
			even farther apart, she felt her body respond again. Ginny moved with such
			slowness, such gentleness over her, as if all she wanted was to taste her, to
			drink her fill.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt Kara respond, felt Kara's body move against her mouth and she
			sighed, loving the way she could make Kara want her. Her tongue teased her,
			moving around Kara's desire until Kara whimpered softly.</p>
		<p>"You're driving me crazy," Kara breathed. "I can't stand it."</p>
		<p>Ginny lifted her head and smiled. "I didn't think you'd be ready . . .."</p>
		<p>"I am," Kara whispered.</p>
		<p>Ginny's smile vanished, her desire for this woman overtaking her and she
			groaned softly when her mouth settled over her again. She couldn't get enough of
			her and she inhaled deeply, savoring her scent, holding Kara's legs apart as her
			tongue plunged inside of her, then out to tease her swollen nub.</p>
		<p>"Yes . . . oh, please . . . Ginny . . . hurry," Kara whispered and Ginny
			did.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Eighteen">
		<p>Kara felt Ginny move away, taking her warmth with her, and she opened her
			eyes, finding Ginny sitting on the side of the bed, the sheet wrapped loosely
			around her hips.</p>
		<p>"What is it?" Kara asked. </p>
		<p>"I've got to go," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>Kara reached out and touched her back, moving lightly across her silken skin.
			"What time is it?" She didn't even remember falling asleep.</p>
		<p>"After two," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Are you all right?" Kara asked softly.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled in the darkness. She was exhausted. Her body was numb and she
			was certain that she wouldn't be able to walk. But all right? She didn't know.
			She felt almost as if she were in a dream. Almost. She turned around and took
			Kara's hand, bringing it to her lips, tasting the remnants of her desire still
			clinging to Kara's fingers. </p>
		<p>"I'm fine, really," she murmured. "But I've got to go. Nana will be worried."
		</p>
		<p>Kara knelt behind her, brushing her hair off of her neck and putting her lips
			there. Ginny sighed, surprised that her body still had the energy to respond.
			She turned and found Kara's lips, swollen like her own after their night of
			lovemaking.</p>
		<p>"We need to talk," Kara stated gently.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I know." Ginny smiled slightly and touched Kara's face, feeling her jaw
			clinch. "Last night was . . .."</p>
		<p>"Incredible," Kara finished for her.</p>
		<p>"Yes. Yes, it was. But I need some time . . . to think," Ginny said softly.
			She felt Kara withdraw, felt her body tense and she brushed at Kara's hair
			gently, letting her fingertips run down her smooth cheek to her swollen lips.
			"I've got to go," she said again. </p>
		<p>Kara nodded. "Okay."</p>
		<p>"Kara . . . it's never been like this for me," she confessed. "I'm so
			scared."</p>
		<p>"I know. But please don't hate me. No matter what happens, please don't hate
			me."</p>
		<p>"No. I don't. I couldn't."</p>
		<p>Ginny reached for her clothes and she felt Kara's eyes on her. Her body
			responded just knowing that Kara was looking at her and she wanted to crawl back
			in bed with Kara and make love all over again. But she dressed slowly, not
			daring to look at Kara. She needed some time to sort out her feelings.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"I got up at midnight and you still weren't home," Nana said as they had
			coffee. "I was beginning to worry."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. Time just got away," Ginny said weakly. She knew she looked a
			sight. She could hardly meet her own eyes in the mirror. Her lips were swollen
			and red and she was certain that Nana would be able to tell exactly what she had
			been doing last night.</p>
		<p>"Well, you look like you've hardly slept a wink. And as tired as you've been
			lately," Nana fussed.</p>
		<p>And she was exhausted. More tired than she could ever remember being. Her
			thoughts felt jumbled. Should she feel ashamed? Should she be thinking of Phil?
			All she could see was Kara, Kara's beautiful body under her hands, under her
			mouth. Kara crying out when Ginny's tongue touched her. Ginny crossed her legs
			and looked away. She wanted her. After spending hours loving her last night, she
			still wanted her. She could spend hours more in her arms.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
		<p>"Are you worried about Phil?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"Phil?"</p>
		<p>"Well, he hasn't called in awhile and you just haven't been yourself lately.
			Why don't you give him a call," Nana said gently. "It wouldn't hurt for you to
			make the next move, you know." </p>
		<p>Oh, Nana, if you only knew, she thought. She sighed wearily. "No, he hasn't
			called in a couple of weeks." </p>
		<p>"More like four," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"I don't want to call him, Nana," Ginny said firmly.</p>
		<p>"This playing hard to get will only last so long," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed. "I'm not playing hard to get. I'm just not ready to see him,"
			she said.</p>
		<p>"Have you talked to Kara about him?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. We've talked," Ginny said, and it wasn't a lie. Kara knew all about
			Phil.</p>
		<p>"What does she think?"</p>
		<p>Ginny was nearly overcome with a case of nervous laughter and she covered her
			mouth with her hand. God, what was she supposed to say to that? That Kara thinks
			that a man has no idea how to touch a woman? And it was true, of course.</p>
		<p>"She thinks I don't love Phil," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Well, she's probably not the best one to ask. After all, she's never been
			married," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Not to a man, no. </p>
		<p>At lunch, Ginny walked to the park, eating her sandwich without tasting it,
			her mind jumping between Kara and Phil. She had spent four years with Phil,
			going on five now if she counted the separation. Only one night with Kara. And
			there was no doubt in her mind that she had found what she had been looking for.
			That burning desire. That magic. And she had found it in another woman's arms.
			In Kara's arms. And she was still frightened.</p>
		<p>Now what? Was she a . . . lesbian? Would she feel that way in any woman's
			arms? She didn't think so. It wasn't as if she was attracted to every woman she
			saw. Only Renee before this. But was that the truth? After Renee, she had
			refused to form any close friendships with women. She knew now, that
			self-consciously, she was running, hiding. She had just never entertained the
			idea of being with a woman sexually. It hadn't been a possibility before. She
			just assumed that what she had with Phil was all there was and that it would
			have to be enough.</p>
		<p>But again, the question nagged at her. Was it Kara or was it women? She
			thought back to the first time she had met Kara, that day in the store. Hadn't
			she felt something even then? Hadn't her breath caught when she looked into
			Kara's blue eyes? Yes. And the more she was with her, the more she thought about
			her, about being touched by her.</p>
		<p>She threw her sandwich away and walked along the trail, remembering last
			night. She had been afraid. She hadn't known what to do. But in Kara's arms, she
			knew. She knew how to touch her, knew what made Kara's body respond. She just
			knew. Like Kara had known.</p>
		<p>She leaned against a tree, her eyes closed to the sun and she remembered
			Kara's mouth on her, her tongue sliding through her wetness, bringing her to
			orgasm. Her breath caught, feeling the now familiar desire surge through her.
			Desire for Kara, a woman. </p>
		<p>Why hadn't Phil ever loved her that way? He had never even tried and she
			hadn't known that she wanted him to. Would it have been the same with him? No.
			But if he had, would she then have been satisfied? No. Phil just didn't make her
			feel the way that Kara did. And she had never wanted to pleasure Phil the way
			that she did Kara.</p>
		<p>She waited for the shame to strike her, but it didn't. She had been nervous,
			so nervous. Even now, she still had a hard time believing that she had spent the
			night making love with a woman, making love to a woman. But she had. And it had
			felt so right. Maybe that's what frightened her now. It had felt right to be
			with Kara. And it was okay. She had survived.</p>
		<p>She pushed off the tree, heading back. She was ready for the day to be over.
			She wanted to see Kara again. And she wasn't frightened in the least.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"I'm going to Kara's," Ginny said. "Don't wait dinner."</p>
		<p>"Again? Isn't she working?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Had she been able to work? "I might be late," Ginny
			called.</p>
		<p>"Well, I won't worry if you are. You'll get something to eat?"</p>
		<p>Ginny felt a blush creep along her face as Nana watched her. Something to
			eat? They wouldn't bother with food, no. Each other's body was all the
			nourishment they needed tonight. </p>
		<p>Ginny found Kara on the porch and their eyes held. Ginny saw relief in Kara's
			eyes and she smiled slightly. She took Kara's hand and led her inside without a
			word. </p>
		<p>They stood staring, their eyes seeking. Then they flew together, arms
			wrapping around the other, lips searching and touching, tongues dancing in
			greeting. Ginny reached up and pulled Kara's shirt over her head, again finding
			no bra. Her hands went to her, cupping her swollen breasts, taking a nipple into
			her mouth. </p>
		<p>Kara groaned, her own hands reaching out to Ginny, lifting her shirt,
			touching her warm skin.</p>
		<p>Ginny drew back and stripped off her shirt, watching Kara's eyes darken when
			she dropped her bra to the floor. Ginny took her hand and led her into the
			bedroom, not bothering with the covers. She drew Kara to the bed, her hands
			shoving between Kara's legs, cupping her through her shorts. She wanted her. She
			couldn't control this wild hunger she had. She had ached with it all day. She
			wanted her now and her fingers were frantic as they shoved inside her shorts.
			Her tongue pushed against Kara's and she moaned when she felt her flesh, hot and
			wet to her touch.</p>
		<p>Kara laid back, sensing Ginny's need for her. She unbuttoned her shorts,
			giving Ginny room and her legs parted for her, ready for her.</p>
		<p>Ginny plunged inside of her, deep and hard and Kara surged up to meet her,
			her hips undulating against Ginny's fingers. Ginny pulled out, sliding through
			her wetness, moving over her like silk and she stroked her, faster, until she
			felt Kara still against her hand and cry out, her legs wrapping tight against
			Ginny's fingers.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt perspiration on her brow and she closed her eyes, shocked by her
			need for this woman. She had never been aggressive in bed before. Phil wouldn't
			have allowed it. But with Kara, she felt free to express herself, express her
			desire. </p>
		<p>"I wanted you," Ginny whispered. </p>
		<p>Kara pulled Ginny into her arms and held her, her lips brushing lightly
			across her damp forehead.</p>
		<p>"You're a very fast learner," Kara murmured. "Sure you haven't done this
			before?"</p>
		<p>"Only in my dreams." Ginny rested her head on Kara's breast while the other
			made lazy circles across her stomach. "I couldn't stop thinking of you
			today."</p>
		<p>"That makes two of us," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"I wasn't sure if you still wanted me," Ginny admitted. </p>
		<p>"Why would you think that?"</p>
		<p>"I didn't know if last night was just . . . if all you wanted . . .."</p>
		<p>"Just one night?" Kara supplied.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded.</p>
		<p>"I haven't wanted like this in a very long time, Ginny. You scare me, too.
			This is new for you. You don't know what you want, you don't know what's out
			there." </p>
		<p>"And you do?" Ginny whispered. </p>
		<p>"I know I want you, yes. But you . . .."</p>
		<p>"I want you, too. It doesn't matter what's out there, Kara."</p>
		<p>Kara watched her, wanting to believe her. But Ginny didn't know how it could
			be. She had no one to compare Kara with. And what did she want? A summer affair?
			No. She was too old for that. And her feelings for Ginny went beyond an affair.
			She was falling in love with her and her eyes widened, shocked by her own
			admission.</p>
		<p>"What are you thinking?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing," Kara murmured. "Let me love you," she whispered and she silenced
			Ginny with her mouth, swallowing her questions.</p>
		<p>Ginny's questions died as thought was lost under Kara's insistent mouth. With
			gentle hands, Kara shoved Ginny's shorts down, her hands moving lightly over her
			body. Kara shrugged her own shorts off and lay naked on top of Ginny, pressing
			her into the bed, warming her body with her own. Ginny held her, brushing her
			hands through Kara's short hair, guiding her mouth to her breast.</p>
		<p>Kara covered her full breast, her tongue raking lightly across the taut
			nipple. Ginny moaned in her ear and Kara closed her eyes, loving the sounds of
			pleasure coming from Ginny.</p>
		<p>Kara drew back and smiled. "Tell me what you want," she whispered.</p>
		<p>"Kara . . .."</p>
		<p>"Tell me and I'll do it. Anything."</p>
		<p>Ginny's hips pressed up, her desire boiling over. "I want your mouth . . .
			your tongue . . . where only you have been." She was so wet and she parted her
			legs, wrapping them around Kara's thigh, pressing her wetness to her. </p>
		<p>Kara kissed her, her tongue brushing lightly across her lips, then she gasped
			as Ginny sucked her tongue inside her mouth. Her thigh pushed harder against
			Ginny's wetness, meeting the thrusts of Ginny's hips.</p>
		<p>"Please . . . your mouth," Ginny murmured against Kara's lips. "I want your
			mouth to take me." She was so near orgasm already but all she wanted was Kara's
			hot mouth on her, where she had been remembering it all day. Her hips slowed and
			she urged Kara downward, pushing lightly on her shoulders.</p>
		<p>Kara felt the urgency in Ginny's hands, saw the look of pleasure on her face
			as Kara slid lower along her body. Her hands pushed Ginny's legs apart and her
			mouth found her, wet and wanting. Ginny pressed up and met her, opening wider
			and her breath hissed between her teeth.</p>
		<p>"Kara . . . Kara." God, yes. This was what she wanted, what only this woman
			had ever given her.</p>
		<p>Her whispered name was like a drug and Kara nearly devoured her in her desire
			to please her. Her tongue moved through her wetness, surrounding her. Her mouth
			opened and she covered Ginny completely, sucking her hungrily into her mouth.
		</p>
		<p>"Dear Lord," Ginny breathed and she clutched at Kara, her heels digging into
			the bed.</p>
		<p>Kara's shoulders pushed into Ginny, driving her legs apart, pushing her
			farther up the bed with the force of her desire. </p>
		<p>"Oh, God!" Ginny screamed. "Kara . . .." Ginny's heart pounded in her ears
			and Kara's mouth sucked her in, not letting her go and Ginny was filled with
			such sweet pleasure. Her body throbbed against Kara's face and she felt as if
			she were drowning, sinking into blackness, trying to catch her breath. "Yes, yes
			. . . God, yes," she breathed, feeling her orgasm build, threatening to swallow
			her, to end this sweet torture. It came to her slowly, climbing, driving her mad
			and she pulsed in Kara's mouth, spasms shaking her. Kara's mouth held her,
			continuing her assault on her as wave after wave rammed into Ginny, causing her
			to cry out Kara's name again and again.</p>
		<p>When her body stilled and her hips lay limply on the bed, only then did
			Kara's mouth leave her. Ginny could not even open her eyes and she rolled her
			head from side to side. </p>
		<p>"I didn't think it could possibly get any better than last night," she
			whispered. "But each time . . .."</p>
		<p>"I know." Kara bit her neck gently, then moved to her ear. "I wanted you like
			that all day," she whispered back.</p>
		<p>"I don't think I can move."</p>
		<p>Kara leaned up on her elbow, letting her eyes move lovingly over Ginny's
			face, down to her breasts. She was in love with her. The certainty of that
			thought filled her heart painfully. Love brought hurt. It always did. She
			touched Ginny's face gently, her eyes lingering on her full lips. She hadn't
			been looking for love, of course. The women who had shared her bed since Marsha
			were simply diversions. Someone to ease a lonely night, someone to talk to for a
			moment, then gone. No feelings were involved. No commitments, no worries. Just a
			physical release that they both had needed.</p>
		<p>But it was so very different with Ginny. Kara wanted her, sure. But she also
			needed her. A deep, burning need that touched her very core, causing her to
			question her very existence. How had she lived this long without Ginny in her
			life? How could she go on, now that she'd had her? </p>
		<p>"What are you thinking about?" Ginny asked gently.</p>
		<p>Kara closed her eyes, unaware that Ginny had been watching her. "I was just
			thinking about you," Kara admitted. "About how you make me feel."</p>
		<p>"Then why did you look so sad?"</p>
		<p>Why, indeed?
			<i>Because now that I've had you, I don't think I can live
				without you.</i> She rested her head against Ginny's breast again, letting Ginny
			stroke her hair.
		</p>
		<p>"You're not going to tell me?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Is it Marsha?" Ginny asked. </p>
		<p>"Marsha?"</p>
		<p>"Are you thinking about her?"</p>
		<p>"Why would you think that?"</p>
		<p>"You loved her once. Are you thinking about that?" Ginny asked again.</p>
		<p>"No. That was a long time ago, Ginny."</p>
		<p>"Was it . . . was it good with her?" she asked quietly.</p>
		<p>Kara looked up and met her eyes. "It was never like this," she said
			truthfully. "It's never been like this with anyone."</p>
		<p>"I find that hard to believe. It's not like I know what I'm doing," Ginny
			said, finally breaking the hold her eyes had on her. </p>
		<p>"Does that frighten you?" Kara asked. "That you know how to touch me?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not sure. I mean, I know I want you . . . like this. But, is this who I
			am? What I am? Is it just you or is it . . .."</p>
		<p>"Or can any woman make you feel this way?" Kara asked. She closed her eyes
			against the pain that she was feeling. Always pain when you loved a woman.</p>
		<p>"I don't think so," Ginny said softly. "If any woman could make me feel this
			way, I wouldn't have waited for you."</p>
		<p>"But you won't know until you've tried it," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"I don't think I want to . . . try it, Kara." In fact, she knew she didn't.
			No one could ever make her feel what Kara did. She knew in her heart that it was
			the truth. But she couldn't say the words. Kara would never believe her, anyway.
			Kara had experience. She'd been with other women, and Ginny was jealous of each
			of them. Had Kara loved them this way, too? Had they wanted her so deeply that
			nothing else mattered?</p>
		<p>Kara raised up and kissed her softly. She'd had enough talking. "Can you stay
			the night with me? Please? I would love to wake up with you," Kara murmured
			against her lips.</p>
		<p>"Yes, but I'm not ready for sleep," she whispered.</p>

	<chapter title="Nineteen">
		<p>"What do you mean, Phil is coming?" she asked, stunned by Nana's words.</p>
		<p>"Well, he called last night. He wanted to surprise you. He took off all next
			week and he's coming tomorrow." Nana watched her. "I thought you'd be thrilled.
			I told him how you just haven't been yourself lately."</p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"Well, you haven't."</p>
		<p>Ginny paced behind the counter, thankful there were no customers in the
			store. "Where will he stay?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Well, with us, of course. Ginny, I'm not a prude. I know you sleep together.
			I won't mind if he stays in your room," Nana said innocently. </p>
		<p>Ginny closed her eyes, cursing silently. What was she going to do? She did
			not want to see Phil. And she certainly did not want him sharing her bed. And
			for a week? She would never survive.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, you surely don't want him staying in the lodge out on Lake Wenatchee,
			do you? That's twenty miles away," she said.</p>
		<p>"No," she murmured. We certainly couldn't have that! "What time tomorrow?"
			she asked.</p>
		<p>"He's leaving in the morning. Should be here by noon." </p>
		<p>"Noon?"</p>
		<p>"Yes and I think you should just take the afternoon off. I know it's
			Saturday, but Jessica and I can handle it."</p>
		<p>Ginny felt like crying but she forced herself to smile at Nana. She meant
			well. "You'll stay home tonight, I hope," Nana continued. "We need to clean
			house. And I'll have meals to plan," she added. "Oh, this will be fun, won't it?
			You can show him around, take him hiking or something. He likes that, doesn't
			he? And, now Kara can meet him. I'm sure she'll like him . . .." Nana rambled
			on, but Ginny had stopped listening. </p>
		<p>Kara. What was she going to do about Kara? She closed her eyes, trying to
			ward off the wave of guilt that settled over her. She had just spent the night
			making love to Kara, waking up entangled in another woman's arms and now she had
			to tell that same woman that Phil was coming to spend a week with her. A week in
			her bed.</p>
		<p>She knew
			that Kara would understand. Ginny couldn't very well tell Phil and Nana that she
			would rather Phil not come at all, that she would rather continue exploring her
			new relationship with Kara. That would be just crazy. Maybe it was good Phil was
			coming. Did she have any feelings for him still? This would be the only way to
			find out. </p>
		<p>Suddenly, it
			was all just too complicated. But then, did she think that it wouldn't be? That
			she could just ease into this new phase of her life without complications?</p>
		<p>Nana left the store early to start dinner and Ginny waited until Jessica had
			left at closing to call Kara. </p>
		<p>"It's me," she said, when Kara had answered.</p>
		<p>"I missed you today," Kara said softly. "Can you come over?" she asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny closed her eyes for a moment, wishing she could go to Kara. "I can't,"
			she said quietly.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong?" </p>
		<p>"Phil is coming," she said.</p>
		<p>There was silence and Ginny pictured Kara standing there, clutching the
			phone. </p>
		<p>"I see," Kara said finally.</p>
		<p>"He called last night, when I was with you. He's taking vacation next week
			and coming to visit. Nana's got it all arranged," she explained.</p>
		<p>"Where will he stay?" </p>
		<p>"Here, at the house." Ginny heard the uncertainty in Kara's quiet voice.</p>
		<p>"In your bed?"</p>
		<p>Ginny was silent for a moment. "Yes," she finally said.</p>
		<p>"I see," Kara said again.</p>
		<p>"Kara, I don't know what I can do. I don't know how to tell him or Nana that
			I don't want to see him. They've got it all planned. That's all Nana talked
			about today."</p>
		<p>"I understand. It's not like I didn't know about Phil. I mean, I know you're
			still technically involved. I just . . . I guess I didn't expect him to show up
			so soon after we . . ." she let her voice trail off and Ginny squeezed her eyes
			shut, not wanting to hear the hurt in Kara's voice, knowing she could do nothing
			about it.</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry," she finally said. </p>
		<p>"Well,
			there's not a whole lot you can do now. And Ginny, maybe this is good, this is
			what you need right now. To see if . . . to see if you . . . still have feelings
			for him. Maybe you'll see him and it'll all come back to you."</p>
		<p>Ginny wondered how hard it was for Kara to say those words. She hadn't seen
			Phil in nearly nine months now. Her body told her that it was only Kara's touch
			she needed but her mind still balked. Was it women or was it just Kara? But did
			it matter anymore? </p>
		<p>"I don't
			want to be with him," Ginny said. "I'm just so confused about everything, Kara.
			I know I want you . . . but . . .."</p>
		<p>"I know," Kara said. "This is so new for you. Don't worry about me, Ginny.
			You've got unfinished business with him. Maybe this thing between us is just . .
			.."</p>
		<p>"Just what? A passing affair?"</p>
		<p>"Something like that," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"Don't do this, Kara. I know how I feel about you," Ginny insisted. "This
			morning when I woke up, it felt so right to be in your arms. It was the most
			natural thing in the world to wake up with you, to make love with you this
			morning. No one's ever made me feel the way that you do. Phil hasn't come
			close," Ginny whispered. "And that's why this is killing me that he's
			coming."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. If I could turn back time . . .."</p>
		<p>"No. I
			wouldn't want that. I don't regret this, Kara. We both knew something was
			pulling us together. We both knew this would happen. Didn't we?" she asked
			hesitantly.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Then
			she laughed gently. "Well, in my dreams. I never thought you would actually come
			to me."</p>
		<p>Ginny
			smiled, feeling some of the tension dissipate. "There was no way I could not go
			to you, Kara." </p>
		<p>"Which
			brings us back to Phil."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry,"
			she said simply.</p>
		<p>"Well, there's nothing we
			can do about this. I'll give you room. You need some time with him, Ginny,
			whether you think so or not. You know, we haven't exactly spent our time talking
			about this thing between us. Maybe we should have. I just . . ."</p>
		<p>"I know. But other things kept getting in the way," she said lightly. She
			didn't want to try to analyze her feelings for Kara. She just wanted . . . to be
			with her.</p>
		<p>Ginny sighed, wishing she had just driven over to the cabin. This
			conversation should have been in person, not over the phone. But she knew they
			would get precious little talking done. She couldn't seem to keep her hands to
			herself whenever she was around Kara. Anyway, maybe Kara was right. She did need
			to see Phil, to see if there was anything there, if there ever had been.</p>
		<p>"We'll talk after he's gone. After you see . . . how you feel." </p>
		<p>"I know that you're right," Ginny said. "Maybe I do need some time to see how
			I feel about . . . everything."</p>
		<p>Kara let out a heavy sigh. "Yes. You do. Because if you don't you'll always
			wonder if it would have worked out with him."</p>
		<p>"But I can't stop thinking about you, Kara," Ginny whispered. </p>
		<p>"I know. You haven't left my thoughts all day," Kara said quietly. After only
			a slight pause, she cleared her throat. "Have a good week," she said and hung up
			abruptly.</p>
		<p>Ginny listened to the dial tone a moment longer, then hung up gently. Despite
			her words, Ginny had heard the pain in Kara's voice. </p>
		<hr/>
		<p>When Phil walked in the store just shortly after noon, Ginny forced a smile
			to her face and went to him. He looked the same. His brown hair cut short, his
			moustache neatly trimmed. </p>
		<p>"God, I've missed you," he whispered in her ear. His arms held her tightly,
			pressing her breasts against his hard chest and she raised her face for his
			bruising kiss. </p>
		<p>"It's good to see you," she managed, pulling out of his arms.</p>
		<p>"You look great," he said. "Country living must agree with you."</p>
		<p>"Hello, Phil," Nana said, giving him a big smile.</p>
		<p>"Nana!" He gave her a brisk hug and kissed her cheek. "Thanks for having me,"
			he said.</p>
		<p>"I'm so glad you're here, Phil. And Ginny is, too." She winked at him. "I
			think she's been missing you."</p>
		<p>"Nana!" Ginny turned pleading eyes to Nana, but she ignored her.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny. It doesn't hurt that Phil knows you've missed him, does it?"</p>
		<p>"Have you missed me?" Phil asked. </p>
		<p>"I suppose," Ginny said and forced another smile to her face. Had she missed
			him? She hadn't given much thought to it in more weeks than she could count.</p>
		<p>But Phil looked happy with her answer and he draped an arm around Ginny
			possessively. "We've got a lot of catching up to do, sweetheart."</p>
		<p>"Yes. That's why I've given Ginny the afternoon off," Nana said, pleased with
			herself.</p>
		<p>"That's wonderful."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, take him to the house and help him unpack. We'll have dinner at
			seven. Roast," she added.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled and nodded, wishing she were anywhere at this moment other than
			here. Nana was positively beaming and Ginny didn't have the heart to spoil
			things for her. </p>
		<p>She rode with Phil to the house. Nana had planned it that way, she supposed.
			Nana had skipped her walk this morning, instead, riding with Ginny to the store.
			She would drive Ginny's car home later.</p>
		<p>"You are glad to see me, aren't you?" Phil asked. </p>
		<p>"I wish you had asked before taking vacation," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"I tried. You weren't home," he reminded her.</p>
		<p>No. She had been with Kara, in her arms . . . making love. She felt a twinge
			of guilt and sighed, trying to keep thoughts of Kara away. She had to if she
			were to survive this week. "I still wish you had waited and talked to me
			first."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, I had to see you. You've been gone for nine months. Don't you think
			that's long enough?"</p>
		<p>"Long enough for what?"</p>
		<p>He smiled in that way of his. Cocky, she thought. And she hated it. "It's
			time we got married, Ginny."</p>
		<p>"Married?" </p>
		<p>"Yes. I know you left because you were scared when I asked you before. I love
			you, Ginny. We're good together. It's been four years. Well, nearly five now.
			It's time."</p>
		<p>Ginny closed her eyes, feeling sick to her stomach. How dare he? How dare he
			come here after nine months of separation and talk marriage? As if they had
			never been apart? As if they had not spoken of this before? </p>
		<p>"I'm not ready," she said. </p>
		<p>"Don't start that again, please. You're just scared," he said.</p>
		<p>"Turn here," she said, motioning to the house. "And I am not scared," she
			insisted.</p>
		<p>They unpacked in silence, Ginny feeling very crowded as he invaded her room
			with his things.</p>
		<p>"I like your room," he said. He sat on the bed and took her hand
			possessively, enclosing it in his larger one. "I've missed you. I've missed
			making love to you."</p>
		<p>"Phil . . . ," she shook her head but he pulled her down beside him.</p>
		<p>"Nana won't be home until six," he said. "She told me."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled slightly, her eyes meeting his brown ones. Nana was trying her
			best to get her married off. She lifted her neck as Phil placed his lips there,
			the familiar feel of his moustache raking against her skin.</p>
		<p>"Have you missed me?" he asked.</p>
		<p>She closed her eyes and nodded as he pushed her back on the bed, his hands
			nearly groping at her breasts. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, there's been no one since you left," he murmured against her
			lips.</p>
		<p>She was nearly overcome with guilt and she wrapped her arms around his strong
			shoulders, so different from Kara's. But it wasn't right. She opened her mouth
			to protest and he shoved his tongue inside urgently, pushing at hers, crushing
			her lips beneath his. She whimpered, feeling tears sting her eyes. Why couldn't
			he make her feel the way that Kara did? </p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny, you feel so good," he whispered. He took her hand and placed it
			on his swollen groin, urging her to stroke him.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt his power through his jeans and she let her hand move over him,
			once so familiar to her, now nearly alien. </p>
		<p>"Let's take these off," he said, his hands going to her jeans. "I'll take
			care of you, sweetheart," he whispered.</p>
		<p>She was in a daze as he lowered her jeans. Her mind was blank, completely
			blank as his rough, possessive hands moved over her. He paused only briefly at
			her breasts, then his mouth came back to hers, and he kissed her with a force
			that bruised her lips.</p>
		<p>"I can't wait," he murmured and he spread her legs with his knees, plunging
			deep inside her.</p>
		<p>She cried out in shame and gasped as he thrust into her, pushing her hard
			against the bed. God, oh God, she thought. She squeezed her eyes shut, hearing
			him groan with each thrust as he pounded into her.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny," he gasped and he came inside of her, his hips shaking as he held
			himself over her.</p>
		<p>She felt a tear escape and she rolled her head away from him. Why . . . oh,
			why? Surely he knew that she was not aroused, that she had not reached an
			orgasm. Surely he knew that she had not enjoyed that. It was sex. That was all.
			There had been no love involved. But, she admitted with sadness, she had let
			him. </p>
		<p>"God, that was so good." He pulled out of her and took her hand gently in
			his. "But fast. I've missed you," he said again. "Tonight we'll go slower," he
			promised. </p>
		<p>Tonight. And the night after that and all week, he would be sharing her bed.
			She breathed deeply, feeling choked on her unshed tears. She felt nearly sick to
			her stomach. Why had she just allowed that? That assault on her. And that's all
			it had been. She was simply an object there to satisfy him, to bring him relief.
		</p>
		<p>He sat up and reached for his jeans, which had gathered around his ankles.
			"Get up, sweetheart. You can show me around town." She didn't move and he
			reached for her. "Or are you wanting some more of that?" he asked, winking at
			her.</p>
		<p>She swallowed with difficulty and forced a smile. "No."
			<i>Definitely not</i>. She made herself move,
			pulling her jeans back around her waist. She felt repulsed. She felt violated.
			She wanted to run into the bathroom and shower. She wanted to scream out in
			frustration. He had no idea, she thought. No idea that he had not satisfied her.
			And he had not even tried.
			<i>Oh, Kara, I'm sorry</i>.
		</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>She kept her back to him as she fastened her bra. "What?"</p>
		<p>"You are going to marry me, aren't you?"</p>
		<p>
			<i>Tell him. Tell him now</i>. She turned
			back around, the words on her lips, but the look in his eyes stopped her. He
			looked so vulnerable, so child-like. Her shoulders slumped and she looked
			away.
		</p>
		<p>"Let's don't talk about it now, Phil. Please?"</p>
		<p>"Okay. We've got all week, anyway. But I warned you, didn't I? I told you I
			would be coming to take you back," he said.</p>
		<p>"Yes, you warned me."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Ginny cut into her roast, her appetite vanishing with each bite. Nana and
			Phil carried on a conversation without her, neither seeming to notice that she
			was a thousand miles away from them. She heard Kara's name and she looked up,
			puzzled.</p>
		<p>"We haven't seen her work, though," Nana was saying.</p>
		<p>"That's amazing. Mr. Bradshaw just bought one of her paintings," he said.
			"Hung it in the conference room."</p>
		<p>"Is it any good?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"Oh. Very. It's called Tomorrow and Today. It's a seastack, out off the
			Peninsula. The sun is setting in the west and one side of the stack is orange,
			nearly crimson and the moon is shining overhead, in the east, making the facing
			side almost glow a ghostly white. It's beautiful, really."</p>
		<p>Ginny listened with interest, thinking how ironic it was that Phil had seen
			Kara's work but she, who had spent countless hours in her arms, had not even
			thought to ask to see it.</p>
		<p>"Well, I knew she would be good," Nana said. </p>
		<p>"She must be. Cost him over two thousand bucks," Phil said.</p>
		<p>"My, my," Nana said. "Ginny, can you image that? And here I was thinking
			maybe I'd like one of her paintings."</p>
		<p>Phil looked at Ginny and smiled. "So, you're hanging out with a famous artist
			and you haven't even seen any of her paintings. Are you sure it's the same Kara
			Morgan?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," Ginny said lightly, glancing at Nana.</p>
		<p>"Oh, we've seen her sketch, but nothing else," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Well, I'd certainly like to meet her," Phil said.</p>
		<p>Ginny cringed, imagining having to introduce Phil to Kara. </p>
		<p>"Oh, and I'm sure she wants to meet you, too. Ginny's told her all about you.
			Haven't you, Ginny?"</p>
		<p>Ginny gave Nana a penetrating glance and nodded, shoving a piece of roast
			into her mouth to avoid speaking.</p>
		<p>"Why don't we have a cookout tomorrow? We can go to the campgrounds out by
			Drury Falls. There's a wonderful hiking trail there. You do like to hike, don't
			you Phil?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"I guess so. Not that I get much of a chance in Seattle," he said.</p>
		<p>"We can invite Kara, Ginny. Maybe have a campfire with hotdogs and chili,"
			Nana said. "Sounds exciting, doesn't it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, let's do. What do you say, Ginny?" Phil asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded weakly, thinking she would never invite Kara. She would make up
			some excuse. She could not handle the both of them together. She would simply go
			insane if she tried.</p>
		<p>Phil lounged by the TV while Ginny and Nana cleaned up. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, you don't have to help. I know you'd rather be out there with Phil,"
			Nana said. </p>
		<p>Ginny let out a heavy sigh. "No. I'll help," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana set the plates down and took Ginny's arm. "What's wrong, child? You
			hardly said a word at dinner."</p>
		<p>"Nothing's wrong, Nana."
			<i>Only	everything</i>.
		</p>
		<p>"Phil loves you," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded. "Yes, I believe he does," she said. </p>
		<p>"Good."</p>
		<p>That night, as Ginny crawled into bed beside Phil and let him take her into
			his arms, she felt that she had surely reached the lowest point in her life. She
			nearly choked when his tongue shoved into her mouth and when his hands grasped
			her breasts in his vise-like grip, she finally pushed him away.</p>
		<p>"No, Phil," she said.</p>
		<p>"No? What do you mean?" </p>
		<p>"I mean, no. I don't want you to touch me. I don't want this."</p>
		<p>"Ginny? Are you okay?"</p>
		<p>"No. I'm not. You come here after nine months of separation, thinking that
			nothing has changed. Well, it has," she said quietly. "Things have changed. I've
			changed."</p>
		<p>"I still love you. I still want to marry you," he said simply.</p>
		<p>"Phil, I left because I needed some time away from you. I wasn't sure that I
			wanted to marry you. I'm still not sure," she said cautiously.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, we've been together for years. What's next for us, if not
			marriage?"</p>
		<p>"Phil, don't do this to me. You know how much Nana wants us to get married.
			She's been harping on me since I moved here. I'm happy right now," she said,
			choosing her words carefully.</p>
		<p>Phil laughed. "You can't possibly be happy. There's nothing here for you. And
			you're too young to be an old maid, even if Nana does think you're fast
			approaching that age," he said lightly. "Besides, I'm not leaving until you
			agree to marry me."</p>
		<p>"I'm not going back to Seattle, Phil," she said firmly.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny. Don't be difficult," he teased. "Let me make love to you," he
			coaxed. "You must have missed it, too."</p>
		<p>"Phil, don't," she warned, but his hands came out again and he pulled her on
			top of him, his arousal pushing up against her. </p>
		<p>"See how I want you," he said and he pressed her firmly against him.</p>
		<p>"Phil, please, don't do this," she begged, trying to break his hold, but his
			mouth smothered her protests.</p>
		<p>She hated herself as he pulled her panties down and entered her. Images of
			Kara's gentle lovemaking came to her as Phil plundered her body and she didn't
			try to stop the tears that flowed from her eyes.</p>
