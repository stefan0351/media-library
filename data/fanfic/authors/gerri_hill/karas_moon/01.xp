		<p>The sun had not yet peeked over the mountains, but Kara hurried anyway. With
			her sketchpad tucked securely under her arm, she picked her way along the trail
			to the lake. Her flashlight shining, she agilely avoided the exposed roots of
			the massive trees lining the path and she paused, leaning against the trunk of
			one of those giants to catch her breath. She had come down this same trail the
			evening before and had sketched the lake at sunset, but she knew the colors of
			early morning would be more to her liking. </p>
		<p>She slowed as she saw the water through the trees. Something caught her eye
			along the edge and through the mist, she saw the shadows of two deer as they
			walked slowly along the fringe of the lake. As if sensing her presence, their
			heads turned her way, and she froze and watched as their ears twitched,
			listening for her next step. They stared at her as she stared back and for
			several seconds she barely took in a breath, not wanting to disturb the scene.
			Finally, with a disinterested toss of their tails, they walked off into the
			trees and disappeared. </p>
		<p>She hurried now as the morning light crept over the hills, and she walked
			nearly to the edge of the lake, sat again on the same rock as before and waited
			for the colors of sunrise to strike her. She shivered in the cool of the morning
			and she rubbed her hands across her bare legs, waiting. </p>
		<p>When the first pinks appeared over the water, her fingers moved quickly,
			nimbly sketching the lake in the dim light of dawn and when the pinks erupted to
			orange, she added more color as the sound of her chalk on paper echoed through
			the silent forest. When the full sun peeked through, changing the brilliant
			orange to dull yellow, she put her pad down and stretched her neck, raising her
			arms over her head. She looked at her work, then picked up another color and
			quickly added the shadows of the deer along the rim. She rarely painted animals
			of any kind, but she wanted to remember the deer, in case she decided to add
			them when she took this to canvas. As an afterthought, she sketched her
			trademark in the top corner, a full moon hanging over the lake, and closed her
			pad. Only then did she hear the footsteps behind her. </p>
		<p>"Good morning. "</p>
		<p>Startled, she turned. She hadn't expected hikers this early and was clearly
			surprised by the older woman standing there watching her. Kara stared at her in
			silence before finding her voice. </p>
		<p>"Hello," she murmured. </p>
		<p>"I didn't want to disturb you earlier. You were so engrossed. I've never seen
			anyone out here this early before. " </p>
		<p>The woman was clearly nervous and Kara took a moment to compose herself. She
			replaced the glare on her face with a forced smile and gathered up her sketchpad
			and chalks, trying to ignore the woman as politely as possible. She had never
			been good with strangers. </p>
		<p>"I'm Louise Harrison, by the way," the woman said, extending her hand. </p>
		<p>Kara looked up and, after a brief pause, touched hands with the woman. "Kara.
			Kara Morgan. "</p>
		<p>"I don't believe I've seen you before. Tourist? "</p>
		<p>"Not exactly. "</p>
		<p>Kara moved to walk past her, but the woman put her hands on her hips, clearly
			expecting an explanation. </p>
		<p>"I'm renting the Dobson cabin," Kara finally explained. </p>
		<p>"The Dobson place? I thought they were only going away for a week or two."</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't know about that," Kara said. "I've rented it through October."</p>
		<p>"Well, I'll be. I wonder what happened? " Louise asked, expecting Kara to
			answer. </p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. She had lived in the city her whole life, she wasn’t used to
			keeping tabs on her neighbors. </p>
		<p>"You're going to be here through October, you say? "</p>
		<p>"Yes. "Kara again tried to pass, but the woman continued. </p>
		<p>"Well, come by the store then. Ginny will be glad to meet you. There's very
			few people her own age out here in the mountains. "</p>
		<p>"Who? " Kara asked. </p>
		<p>"My granddaughter. We have the general store over at the end of town," the
			woman explained, motioning with her hand. </p>
		<p>"Oh. "Kara smiled politely, finally walking past the woman. "Actually, I
			haven't been into town yet. "</p>
		<p>Louise surveyed her sketchpad under her arm. "You're an artist? " </p>
		<p>"Yes. "</p>
		<p>"Hobby? "</p>
		<p>"It started out that way, yes. "</p>
		<p>"Well, you must be good if you can make a living at it. "</p>
		<p>"Sometimes. "Kara squared her shoulders, raising to her full height. She’d
			had enough of idle conversation for one day. "Listen, it was nice to meet you,
			but I've got to get back. Louise, was it? "</p>
		<p>"Yes. Come by the store," she said again. "We've got coffee," she called to
			Kara’s retreating back. </p>
		<p>Kara smiled slightly and made her escape, hurrying back along the path to her
			truck, anxious to return to her solitude. </p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Two">
		<p>Ginny looked up as the bell over the door jingled and she smiled warmly at
			her grandmother. </p>
		<p>"Good morning, Nana. How was your walk? "</p>
		<p>"Oh, it's a beautiful day out, Ginny. "Louise walked around the counter and
			tossed her purse on the bottom shelf, nudging Ginny out of the way. "I told you
			I would put these out this morning. " </p>
		<p>Ginny had been pricing the freeze-dried meals that they kept in stock for the
			backpackers that swarmed the mountains in summer. She let Nana take over and
			went to get herself a latte from the espresso machine. She proudly touched the
			side, rubbing off a smudge with her thumb. It was the first thing she added when
			she had purchased the general store last fall. Coffee was one of the few things
			she missed about Seattle. </p>
		<p>"Want one? " she asked. </p>
		<p>"No, thanks. I just had some juice. Oh, Ginny, I met the most interesting
			woman this morning," Nana said. </p>
		<p>"When? " Ginny asked absently as she pushed the button for steamed milk. </p>
		<p>"Out on the trail, by the lake," Nana explained. "An artist. I watched her
			work, although I'm sure she didn't know I was spying on her. "</p>
		<p>"Spying? Why? " </p>
		<p>"Well, I didn’t want to disturb her. She had this large pad and a handful of
			colored chalk things and her hands just flew over the paper. "Louise sighed
			heavily. "I wanted to ask to see it, but once she stood up, I lost my nerve. "
		</p>
		<p>"What do you mean? "Ginny took a sip of her coffee and smiled contentedly.
			Nothing like good coffee. </p>
		<p>"Well, she was . . . imposing. Taller than most women. And her eyes. Oh,
			Ginny, the most odd color of blue I’ve ever seen. Seemed to look right through
			you. "</p>
		<p>"What's her name? " </p>
		<p>Nana looked up and frowned. "Kara Morgan. Ever heard of her? "</p>
		<p>"Kara Morgan? I'm not sure. Wasn't there an article earlier this year about
			her in Northwest Magazine? " </p>
		<p>"I don't remember. You know I never actually read those articles," she said
			and smiled sheepishly. "I just enjoy the pictures. "</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled, too. "You and me both. So, she's here painting? "</p>
		<p>"I suppose. She's renting the Dobson place until October. I was certain the
			Dobson's were only going to be gone a week or so. At least, that's what I heard.
			I wonder if they are having problems? " she mused. Then she looked back at
			Ginny. "But anyway, I told her to come by. She's a little older than you, but I
			told her you didn't have any friends here your own age. "</p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"Well, you don't. You keep saying you have nothing in common with the people
			around here. "</p>
		<p>"I'm sure I would have nothing in common with an artist, either. "</p>
		<p>"You designed ads. That's art," Nana said emphatically. </p>
		<p>"I hardly think what I did for the marketing firm could be called art, Nana."</p>
		<p>"Well, she wasn't overly friendly anyway. She may not even stop by. "</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head and sipped from her coffee. It was true. She had made
			few friends since she had moved here. Most of the locals were older and those
			that were close to her own age were married with small children and she
			certainly didn't have anything in common with them. So far, she had been content
			having Nana as her only friend. </p>
		<p>The bell jingled again and Mr. Arnold came in carrying his poodle under his
			arm. </p>
		<p>"Good morning, ladies," he said, bowing slightly at his waist. </p>
		<p>"Why, Mr. Arnold, how are you today? " Nana greeted him and Ginny was again
			amazed at how Nana had taken to running the store. But then, Nana had lived most
			of her adult life here. These people were her people. It had taken several
			months for them to warm up to Ginny, despite the many summers she had spent here
			as a child. But now, after nearly a year, she felt almost like a local. </p>
		<p>She gave a humorless smile to her reflection in the glass behind the counter.
			So far removed from Seattle, but hardly a local here. Sometimes, she did miss
			her fast-paced job in the city. And sometimes, she missed the people there. </p>
		<p>Like Phil, she thought, but she didn't want to think about him right now. He
			had been calling again, hinting that he was coming for a visit and she had been
			putting it off. He would want to talk marriage and after being away from him the
			last eight months, she was fairly certain that she would not marry him. Only she
			didn't have the heart to tell him. Or Nana. She had hoped her absence would end
			things with Phil, but still, he called. </p>
		<p>"Ginny? "</p>
		<p>"What? " she asked, pushing her thoughts aside for the moment. </p>
		<p>"Would you slice Mr. Arnold some ham? Just a half-pound. "</p>
		<p>"Of course. "</p>
		<p>The day took on its familiar routine. The morning filled with locals and a
			handful of strangers. The afternoon would be spent catering to the tourists and
			vacationers who had slept in and were late getting out to enjoy the warm day.
			Jessica, the high school student who helped during the summer months, came in at
			noon and Ginny escaped for a quick lunch, taking her sandwich out to the park
			like she did everyday. </p>
		<p>With elbows leaning on the table, she tossed a corner of her bread to the
			chipmunks that came to beg. She wondered if they waited for her every day or if
			they just happened to be out and about when she was eating. She sighed. Was she
			lonely? Not really, although she did miss her friends in Seattle. Their phone
			calls, like their letters, were getting less frequent as time went by. But it
			was her own choice to move out here. She had been closer to Nana than to her own
			mother and when her grandfather had passed away, only a few months after her
			mother, she had used her family inheritance and bought the store, feeling her
			grandmother would need someone to look after her. She knew now that Nana was
			just fine, but it was as good an excuse as any to get away from Phil. She should
			have just told him she wasn't ready to get married, but after four years, it was
			time to do something. They couldn't just continue dating and Phil wanted
			children and she dreaded telling him she had no desire to be a mother. She
			secretly feared she would end up like her own mother; loving one child so much,
			her first and scarcely noticing that she had another, waiting for her attention
			as well. </p>
		<p>But she pushed those thoughts aside. She didn’t want to think about her
			sister. And with their mother gone, she seriously doubted she would ever see her
			again. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Kara applied background colors to the canvas, adding gray to soften the dark
			sky. She had decided on the morning scene, with deer and all and she worked
			right through lunch, finally stopping when her stomach demanded attention. </p>
		<p>She took out the tofu she had brought with her from Seattle and sautéed it
			with vegetables and put the pasta on to boil. She opened a bottle of wine and
			went out on the porch while her dinner cooked. The crumbled pack of cigarettes
			beckoned and she lit one, inhaling deeply and letting the smoke out slowly. She
			needed to savor every one. She had vowed she would quit and she was down to five
			a day. At the rate she was going, a few more months and she would quit
			altogether. </p>
		<p>"Right," she murmured. She had been stuck on five for the last month or so.
		</p>
		<p>She stretched her long legs out, the wineglass hanging loosely in her hand
			and she gazed out at the forest. It was quiet here. No close neighbors to
			disturb her work. </p>
		<p>She had come to Chiwaukum one weekend in May with a friend and had seen
			endless opportunities for her work. The surrounding Wenatchee National Forest
			was littered with small lakes and offered a wonderful view of Glacier Peak,
			hovering over them at more than ten thousand feet. On impulse, she had inquired
			about renting a place for the summer. The local real estate agent had called her
			barely two weeks ago about the Dobson cabin and she had snatched it up. She
			usually traveled during the summers, camping or staying at local resorts while
			she sketched, then spent the winter putting her ideas on canvas. But she had
			tired of that and the thought of working in solitude and the quiet of her own
			cabin all summer had been too tempting to pass up. She had not really closed up
			her cottage on Bainbridge Island, though. She was only a few hours from Seattle.
			She could always go back. </p>
		<p>She finished her cigarette and brought her dinner out to the porch. The
			evening was cool, but clear and she ate while she watched the colors of sunset
			settle on the forest, her favorite time of day. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Three">
		<p>It wasn't until the following afternoon, after Kara had worked through lunch
			again, that she decided to drive into town. She had brought most of the food she
			would need with her. Being a vegetarian, she couldn't always count on small town
			grocery stores having what she needed, but cream for her coffee was a necessity
			and she thought she would check out Louise's store. Maybe they would carry
			enough and she wouldn't have to make a trip into Seattle just to shop for food.
		</p>
		<p>She passed through the town, which was a stretch by anyone's imagination. A
			few stores, catering strictly to tourists, an old lodge that looked quite
			charming, and one gas station. At the edge of town, where the forest nearly
			swallowed it up, stood the general store. A log cabin, with porch and all, it
			looked as if it came right out of the last century. She parked her Land Cruiser
			next to a four-wheel drive Ford truck, looking like it had seen better days. She
			ran her hand affectionately across the hood of her Toyota, her pride and joy. It
			had been the first major purchase she’d made with her own money. </p>
		<p>She glanced above her head, admiring the freshly painted sign. Ginny’s
			General Store. A paper flyer taped to the window of the door offered fresh
			coffee and espresso. Another notified locals of the monthly bingo game at the
			community center. She grinned. Life moved a lot slower out here than in Seattle.
		</p>
		<p>Kara looked up as the bell above her head signaled her arrival and she walked
			into the store, glancing up to meet the friendly green eyes of the woman
			standing behind the counter. Kara held her gaze, the corner of her mouth lifting
			in a quick smile before looking away and she walked slowly down one of the rows
			of shelves lined with canned goods towards the cooler. She grabbed a carton of
			cream then turned and looked around. She spotted the espresso machine in the
			corner and made her way to that. A real cup of coffee with steamed milk nearly
			made her mouth water. </p>
		<p>"Why, Ms. Morgan, you found us," Nana called as she saw Kara. </p>
		<p>"Louise. Nice to see you again. I remembered you said you had coffee," Kara
			replied as she sipped from her cup. </p>
		<p>"Ginny's idea. She missed Seattle’s coffee, although I prefer just plain old
			roast," she said as she walked over to Kara and casually took her hand. "Come
			meet Ginny. "</p>
		<p>Kara looked again into sea-green eyes. "Hello. Kara Morgan. "She extended a
			hand in greeting. </p>
		<p>Ginny paused for only a moment, the slightly husky voice still vibrating in
			her ears. She reached out and touched her hand quickly. </p>
		<p>"Ginny Harrison. "</p>
		<p>"I'm so glad you decided to come by," Louise said. "I told Ginny about you. "
		</p>
		<p>"You did? "Kara glanced quickly at Ginny Harrison, watching as she nervously
			tucked strands of blonde hair behind her ears, then brushed at the bangs hanging
			in her eyes. </p>
		<p>"Yes, she did," Ginny said. "Welcome to Chiwaukum. She said you were staying
			at the Dobson place. " </p>
		<p>"For the summer, at least. "</p>
		<p>Their eyes met again and Kara was
			surprised at the gentle tug of attraction she felt for this woman. Her warm,
			green eyes seemed almost to beckon and Kara laughed to herself. The young woman
			was most likely straight. Her blonde hair was neatly styled, just barely
			brushing the tops of her shoulders in the back but shorter around her face and
			Kara was very conscious of her own hair, cut short over her ears and barely
			reaching her neck. With two fingers, she brushed it away from her forehead,
			finally pulling her eyes away and turning to Louise.
		</p>
		<p>"Your offer of coffee drew me," she said, sipping from her cup again. "I've
			missed Seattle's coffee, too. "</p>
		<p>"You and Ginny. That's all she complained about. Not a decent cup of coffee
			for miles, she kept saying. "</p>
		<p>Kara looked again at Ginny. "The espresso machine was a good idea. " </p>
		<p>Ginny grinned. "Absolutely. During the summer months, most of our customers
			are from Seattle. They need some place to go to get a cup of real coffee. "</p>
		<p>"Well, thank you," Kara said, raising her cup in salute. "What do I owe you?"She pulled a couple of bills from her front jeans pocket and handed them to
			Ginny. </p>
		<p>"Why don't you come for dinner tonight? " Louise asked unexpectedly. </p>
		<p>Kara looked down, embarrassed. "I'm afraid I'd be more trouble than it's
			worth," she said. "I'm a vegetarian. Most people find it difficult to invite me
			to dinner. "</p>
		<p>"Nonsense. I've got a wonderful vegetable soup that I could whip up. You
			wouldn't mind, would you, Ginny? "</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at Nana for only a second, then shook her head. "No, of course
			not. Please join us. "</p>
		<p>Kara looked from Ginny to Louise and back again. "Okay then, I guess. " </p>
		<p>"Great," Louise said and gave Kara directions to their house. </p>
		<p>Kara left, slowly shaking her head. Why? She wasn’t good with people,
			strangers. Why had she agreed to dinner? Then she grinned. Because you’re a
			sucker for blondes, she told herself. </p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"Well, what do you think? " Louise asked Ginny after Kara had left. </p>
		<p>"About what? "</p>
		<p>"About the artist, of course," Louise said. </p>
		<p>"She seemed nice enough, although I don't know why you insisted on inviting
			her to dinner," Ginny said. Something about the woman’s eyes made her
			uncomfortable. Ice blue. For a second, she wondered if they were real. With her
			jet-black hair, she would have expected dark eyes, not the vibrant blue that
			stared back at her. But it was not the dead, lifeless eyes that colored contacts
			produced. No, these eyes were very much alive. </p>
		<p>"I thought you might like her company. " </p>
		<p>"I'm sure I will. She was just . . . " Ginny shrugged. "A little
			intimidating. "</p>
		<p>"Yes. At first, I thought it was her height," Nana said. "But I think it’s
			her eyes. They seem to just look right into you. "</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, her mind drifting back to the dark-haired stranger who had just
			left. </p>
		<p>"Well, anyway, she seems near your age. Maybe you can make a new friend."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Nana, for looking out for me," she said dryly. </p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny. I just wish you had some friends here, is all," she said. </p>
		<p>Ginny let her shoulders sag and she forced a smile. "I know, but I'm fine,
			really. " </p>
		<p>"Are you? I know Phil has been calling, but you never tell me about it. When
			are you going to see him again? " she asked. </p>
		<p>"Actually, he wants to come visit. "Ginny knew it was a mistake the minute
			the words were out of her mouth. Nana’s eyes lit up and Ginny turned away from
			them. </p>
		<p>"That's wonderful, dear. Maybe you two can work out your differences after
			all," she said. "Do you think he’ll come soon? " </p>
		<p>Ginny ignored the question. "So what kind of vegetable soup do you have that
			you can just whip up? " she asked, changing the subject. It was always Phil with
			Nana. </p>
		<p>"Well, there's that soup I make with chicken. I can just leave out the
			chicken," she said with raised eyebrows. "Don't you think that would be okay?"</p>
		<p>Louise left the store early to start dinner and by the time that Ginny had
			arrived, the soup was simmering and Nana was tidying the kitchen. </p>
		<p>"I'm going to take a quick shower," she called. </p>
		<p>"Fine, dear," Louise called back. </p>
		<p>Ginny undressed in her room and slipped a robe over her naked body, grabbing
			underclothes on her way out. She was running late and their guest was expected
			in fifteen minutes. She hurried down the hall to the spare bathroom, hearing
			Nana singing in the kitchen and she smiled. It seemed Nana was looking forward
			to their dinner guest much more than Ginny was. It wasn't that she had taken an
			instant dislike to Kara Morgan or anything. In fact, she seemed quite charming.
			She just hated the idea of Nana finding friends for her. </p>
		<p>She was dismayed to find that the tall woman was already seated on the sofa
			when she walked out of the shower. She gave an embarrassed smile and hurried
			past the door in her robe. Apparently Kara Morgan was timely, something Ginny
			had never been accused of!</p>
		<p>Kara watched her run past, her eyes locked on the tan legs exposed beneath
			her robe. She smiled and turned back to Nana, catching the end of her monologue.
		</p>
		<p>When Ginny finally joined them, Nana was serving wine like an expert hostess
			and Ginny nearly laughed out loud, knowing Nana had never served wine a day in
			her life!</p>
		<p>"Hello. Sorry I'm running late," she said to Kara. </p>
		<p>"No problem. " </p>
		<p>Ginny was again conscious of blue eyes following her across the room and she
			felt an involuntary shiver run down her spine. </p>
		<p>"Kara's from Seattle, too," Louise said to Ginny as she accepted the glass of
			wine from her as if she had done it numerous times before. </p>
		<p>"Really? I'm afraid I don't know anything about your work," Ginny admitted.
		</p>
		<p>"There's not much to know. I'm just an artist, not quite as struggling as I
			used to be," she admitted. </p>
		<p>Ginny sipped her wine, thankful Nana had chosen one of their better bottles
			for the occasion. "Are you familiar with our area? " she asked. </p>
		<p>"No, not at all," Kara said. "I came here for the first time in May and fell
			in love. "Kara let her eyes rest on Ginny’s for a second. "How long have you
			been here? </p>
		<p>"Since last October, although I've spent summers here since I was a child."Ginny glanced at Nana and knew that they were both remembering happier times
			from long ago. </p>
		<p>Kara nodded and an uncomfortable silence filled the room as she wondered why
			she had accepted this dinner invitation. She normally liked being alone while
			she worked, hardly ever making friends along the way. She glanced at Ginny as
			she sipped from her wine and she wondered what this young woman was doing out
			here, alone and so far from Seattle. </p>
		<p>"Ginny surprised me when she said she intended to buy the store and come live
			with me," Louise said, as if reading her thoughts. "Here I thought she was all
			ready to get married. "</p>
		<p>Ginny glanced at Kara and rolled her eyes. "I found out Nana didn't really
			need taking care of," she said. </p>
		<p>"No, but I would love great-grandchildren someday," she said. </p>
		<p>Ginny hoped Nana wouldn't start with that, but it was too late. The seed had
			been planted. </p>
		<p>"Phil is a wonderful man, Kara. Why she left him behind in Seattle, I'll
			never know," she said. </p>
		<p>"Nana!" Ginny exclaimed. </p>
		<p>"Are you married? " Nana asked Kara, dismissing Ginny with a wave of her
			hand. </p>
		<p>"No. Never," Kara said. </p>
		<p>"Never? What are you? Early thirties? "</p>
		<p>"Thirty-four," Kara said. It had been a long time since she had to explain
			about her lack of a husband to anyone. </p>
		<p>"Well, I hope Ginny doesn't wait that long. She's already twenty-eight. Her
			clock is ticking, if you know what I mean," she said. </p>
		<p>"Nana, please," Ginny said quietly. </p>
		<p>"He's a fine man, Ginny. You can't wait around for ever. "She turned
			expectantly to Kara. "Isn't that right? " </p>
		<p>"I wouldn't know about that. I'm not exactly looking for a husband," she said
			lightly, feeling the strain of this conversation with these strangers. </p>
		<p>"No? Are you one of those independent feminists who thinks she doesn't need a
			man in her life? " Nana asked, softening her words with a smile. </p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>A brief smile touched Kara’s lips and drained her wineglass. "I'm just happy
			being alone," she said quietly, feeling no need to explain herself. "I don't
			really need a man to take care of me. "</p>
		<p>Ginny met her eyes, trying to apologize silently and Kara accepted with a
			slight nod before looking away. </p>
		<p>"In my time," Nana continued, "you were married by twenty or you were
			considered an old maid. I know women wait longer these days, but really,
			twenty-eight is long enough," she said. </p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"Oh, all right. I just want you to be happy. Is that so hard for you to
			accept? "</p>
		<p>"I am happy," Ginny insisted. </p>
		<p>"Bull!You've been moping around here for the last eight months!" </p>
		<p>Ginny let out an exaggerated sigh and raised her hands in defeat. "Shouldn't
			you be checking on dinner? "</p>
		<p>"Very well. I can take a hint. "Nana excused herself with only a slight huff.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Ginny said. "At her age, Nana just speaks what's on her mind."</p>
		<p>"It's okay. She's not the first to inquire about my marital status," Kara
			said lightly. "So, who's Phil? " she asked, turning the conversation away from
			herself. </p>
		<p>"That's another story, I'm afraid. "</p>
		<p>"Running away? " Kara guessed. </p>
		<p>"You might say that. Only don't tell Nana. She’s convinced Phil and I will be
			married by Christmas. "</p>
		<p>"Your secret's safe with me. "</p>
		<p>"I think I read an article about you in Northwest Magazine," Ginny said,
			again changing the subject. "Well, I skimmed the article," she admitted. </p>
		<p>Kara met her eyes, wondering if Ginny remembered everything about that
			article. It had made no secret that she was a lesbian. </p>
		<p>"I remember something about a mural you painted," Ginny said. </p>
		<p>"In Yakima," Kara supplied. </p>
		<p>"Yes. So, are you famous or what? " Ginny asked lightly. </p>
		<p>"Not really, no. I have a decent following here in Washington and down the
			coast, but I'd hardly call me a household name. I'm surprised that you've
			actually heard of me," she said. </p>
		<p>"I'm not really into the art scene," Ginny apologized. </p>
		<p>"Not very many people are," Kara said. </p>
		<p>"Dinner, you two," Nana called and Kara stood, thankful that the evening was
			nearly over. </p>
		<p>"This looks good," Kara said as she filled her bowl. "I hope you didn't go to
			any trouble. "</p>
		<p>"What trouble? " Nana shrugged. "I just left out the chicken. " </p>
		<p>Ginny met the amused eyes of Kara Morgan across the table and smiled. Nana
			really was a handful, she admitted. Especially when she wanted to be!</p>
		<p>The conversation during dinner was polite, but sparse. Ginny tried her best
			to draw the dark-haired woman out, but most of her questions were responded to
			with one syllables words. She suspected Kara was not much of a talker, but she
			wondered if Nana’s earlier comments had offended her. </p>
		<p>Kara made her escape as soon as she had helped clear the table. "I enjoyed
			dinner," she lied. "But I've got an early day tomorrow. "</p>
		<p>"Oh? Where to this time, Kara? " Nana asked. </p>
		<p>"Lake Wenatchee," she said. </p>
		<p>"It's beautiful out there. Will you paint it? "</p>
		<p>"I'll sketch it first, see how it feels," she said. "It was nice of you to
			invite me out here. Thanks again for dinner. "</p>
		<p>Ginny walked her to the door, feeling a need to apologize. "I hope Nana
			didn't make you uncomfortable," Ginny said quietly. "Or offend you. She didn’t
			mean any harm. "</p>
		<p>"It was fine. I appreciate a meal out now and again," she said, forcing a
			smile. "Maybe I'll see you around. " </p>
		<p>Ginny met her eyes, again astounded by their blueness as they peered into
			hers. "Maybe so. Come by for coffee anytime. " </p>
		<p>"Thanks. I will," Kara said and walked away quickly. She let out a deep sigh
			when she reached the safety of her own truck. She had never been good at social
			events, never been good with strangers. She knew she had only accepted the
			dinner invitation because Ginny Harrison had intrigued her. She laughed at
			herself now. Ginny had a very real boyfriend waiting in Seattle, a boyfriend
			Louise hoped would one day be Ginny's husband. She drove away to the Dobson
			cabin, now hers for the next several months and put the younger woman from her
			mind. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Four">
		<p>Kara stood at the edge of the parking lot of Lake Wenatchee, clad in her
			normal shorts and tank top, her unopened sketchpad still shoved under her
			arm.</p>
		<p>"Well, I think I’ve found the area’s hot spot," she murmured. Vacationers
			crowded into nearly every available space as multicolored tents dotted the
			shoreline and the lake itself was practically littered with boats. She could
			still sketch it, she supposed, but she was far too distracted now by all the
			clutter.</p>
		<p>She let out a heavy sigh, thinking she should have asked Louise more about
			the lake last night and saved herself a trip out this morning. She went back to
			her Land Cruiser and sat with the door open, the map spread out across the
			steering wheel. Doesn’t have to be a lake, she thought. There were just so many
			small ones tucked into the mountains that she hated to miss any opportunity to
			capture one in the perfect light.</p>
		<p>Without thinking, she reached for her cigarettes. She could always swing by
			the store and see if Ginny could recommend any. Maybe she’d be willing to show
			her around, too. She looked up and met her amused expression in the mirror.</p>
		<p>"No playing with the locals, Kara."</p>
		<p>She folded the map and headed back, stopping only once when she found a tiny
			dirt road leading off into the forest. The road stopped abruptly at a small
			clearing and an interesting creek flowed rapidly around boulders before
			disappearing into the trees. She watched it for a moment, wondering if the
			clearing was enough to capture the morning sunrise. It wasn’t too far. Maybe she
			would check it out one morning. She pulled out her notepad and scribbled down
			directions then turned the SUV around.</p>
		<p>As she approached town, she slowed when she neared the general store,
			pleasantly surprised to see Ginny walking along the road. She stopped and lifted
			a hand in greeting and Ginny walked over without hesitation.</p>
		<p>"Hi. How was the lake?" Ginny asked. She leaned through the open window and
			Kara met her green eyes briefly before looking away.</p>
		<p>"Crowded. Where're you headed?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"To the park for lunch."</p>
		<p>"Park?"</p>
		<p>"Just down the dirt road there," she said, pointing. "Have you eaten?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Want to join me?" Ginny asked. "You can have my apple," she offered.</p>
		<p>Kara tapped the stirring wheel with her thumbs and her mouth twitched in a
			slight smile. Why not?</p>
		<p>"Okay. Hop in."</p>
		<p>Ginny led the way to her usual picnic table and Kara followed, her eyes
			watching Ginny’s graceful strides and she remembered those same legs, peeking
			from beneath her robe last night. Now, they were covered in faded blue jeans.
			When Ginny turned, Kara quickly veiled her eyes and looked away.</p>
		<p>"This is a National Forest picnic area, but everyone in town just refers to
			it as The Park," Ginny said and slid onto the bench.</p>
		<p>"It's quiet here," Kara said. She looked around, finding only a few tables
			occupied, most with families, urging the kids to eat before returning to the
			playground.</p>
		<p>"Yes. Usually." Ginny unwrapped her sandwich and tossed her apple to Kara.
			"Sorry, but that's all I have."</p>
		<p>"It's fine. I usually forget to eat lunch, anyway." Kara rubbed the apple on
			her shirt, shining it, then took a large bite, feeling the juice slide down her
			chin.</p>
		<p>Ginny bit into her own sandwich, then looked up and watched as Kara licked
			the apple juice from her lips. Ginny felt nearly mesmerized by the sight of
			Kara’s tongue as it wet her lips and she stopped chewing and watched.</p>
		<p>"What?" Kara asked, sensing Ginny's gaze on her.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?" Ginny raised her eyes to Kara's blue ones and frowned, then bit into
			her sandwich again.</p>
		<p>Kara’s mouth moved into a slow grin, then she brushed it away. No playing
			with the locals, she reminded herself again. But there was something about the
			green-eyed woman that intrigued her.</p>
		<p>"So, what are you doing here, really?" Kara asked, hoping it was a safe
			question.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. Should she give the practiced speech she told everyone or
			should she tell this stranger the truth? She shrugged, opting for her
			speech.</p>
		<p>"When my grandfather died, I thought Nana would need someone to take care of
			her, so I used my inheritance from my mother and bought the store and moved."
			She shrugged again and tucked her hair behind her ears. "I moved here in
			October."</p>
		<p>Kara leaned her elbows on the table and met Ginny's eyes with a smile.
			"You've got that well rehearsed, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled too. "Is it that obvious?"</p>
		<p>Kara nodded. "And Phil?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm such a coward when it comes to him. He's really a sweet man, only he
			wanted to get married and I kept putting him off." She let out a heavy sigh and
			looked up at the trees. "He was getting restless, demanding."</p>
		<p>"Wouldn't take no for an answer?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"I mean, he wanted three kids, a house in the suburbs, the whole nine yards.
			I just wasn't ready," Ginny said. Then, almost to herself, "I wasn’t sure."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you just don't love him," Kara said, reading her thoughts.</p>
		<p>Ginny hadn't been able to tell herself that. After four years, surely she
			loved him. But something was missing and she felt like she would be settling if
			she just went ahead and married him.</p>
		<p>"Maybe I just don't love him enough," she allowed. "Maybe I've read too many
			romance books." She leaned forward and said softly, "I mean, I want that
			passion, that burning desire for someone that makes you crazy when you're not
			with them and crazier still when you are. You know what I mean?"</p>
		<p>"You're a romantic," Kara stated.</p>
		<p>"Maybe so. Maybe there's no such thing as that kind of love." Ginny met her
			eyes for a moment. "Have you ever had that?"</p>
		<p>Kara looked past her, into the trees. "No. Never," she said quietly. She had
			thought, once, that she had found it, but she had given up searching for it when
			Marsha left her one winter. She had been so involved in her painting that it was
			two days before she even knew she was gone. She pushed her thoughts back into
			her memory and forced a smile. "But I'm not really expecting it anymore."</p>
		<p>Ginny hadn't missed the pain that had flashed across Kara's face briefly,
			before she had hidden it, but she wouldn’t pry. They were only strangers. You
			don't bare your soul to strangers.</p>
		<p>"So, what did you do in Seattle?" Kara asked, looking for a safer
			subject.</p>
		<p>"I was in marketing. I designed ads. That's where I met Phil," she said. "We
			worked for the same firm."</p>
		<p>"So you quit your job and moved up here to take care of Louise?" Kara
			grinned. "And Phil had no idea you were running away?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, he had an idea, all right." Ginny laughed. "He said he would give me six
			months to come running back, then he was coming to get me."</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And it's been eight and he'll be coming this summer." She sat up straight
			and tried to mimic his tone. "Ginny, you're not making sense. We love each
			other, it's only natural that we get married."</p>
		<p>"Have you ever tired the direct approach? Leave me alone, I'll call you if I
			want you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed. "No. The truth is, I don't want to hurt him. He’s done nothing
			wrong."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you're hanging on to him, just in case," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"Just in case what?" Ginny asked sharply.</p>
		<p>"In case nothing better comes along. At least you'll still have him," she
			said.</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head. "No. I would hate to think that's what I'm doing." She
			wondered if indeed Kara wasn't right though.</p>
		<p>Their eyes met across the table for an instant and Kara saw a spark of anger
			in the younger woman’s eyes, daring her to say more.</p>
		<p>Kara looked away but offered a smile. "I've upset you. I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>"No. Maybe you've hit on the truth and I don't like it." Ginny stood and
			tossed her bag into the trash. "Maybe I am simply hanging on to him for that
			reason. It would suck, but it may be true."</p>
		<p>"Well, it's none of my business, anyway," Kara said and stood and tossed a
			perfect strike into the trash can, her apple disappearing into the bin.</p>
		<p>They rode back in silence and when Ginny got out, she walked around to the
			driver's door and leaned in.</p>
		<p>"I'm not angry with you, Kara. I just haven't had a chance to talk to anyone
			about this before. My friends, they all think Phil is a wonderful man and that
			I'm insane not to marry him. Nana wants great-grandchildren and for me not to be
			an old maid," she said lightly. "I guess maybe you made me see things
			differently. And the truth sometimes hurts," she said quietly, her eyes again
			locking on blue.</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "Again, I’m sorry. None of my business." She lifted a hand as
			Ginny stepped back. "Thanks for lunch. I'll see you around," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded and watched as Kara drove off. Through the back window, she saw
			her light a cigarette and she thought again that she had never met a woman quite
			like her before. Strong, independent, alone and seemingly happy. But she
			remembered the pain that had been on her face earlier, briefly, before Kara had
			hidden it. She wondered who had caused this woman pain?</p>
		<p>Kara savored her cigarette, her third of the day, as she drove slowly to her
			cabin. She should work, she thought, but she felt restless. She took a beer, one
			of only six she had brought with her, and walked into the woods to the property
			line. The old fence was in need of repair and she crawled through it easily into
			the forest beyond. She walked aimlessly, letting her mind drift. She had not
			thought of Marsha in a very long time, she realized. Kara had barely turned
			thirty-two when Marsha left. Her work was just catching on and her paintings
			were in demand and she had been very busy. Too busy to notice that she was
			neglecting Marsha and everything else in her life. They had met when she was
			twenty-six; Kara, a spoiled rich kid pretending to be an artist and Marsha,
			fresh out of college, trying to land a corporate job that would take her out of
			her parents shabby home in Tacoma. Marsha had been impressed with Kara's cottage
			on Bainbridge Island and even more impressed when she found out that Kara's
			parents had given it to her as a gift. Kara had gotten Marsha a job with her
			father's company and they had settled into their life with ease. And it had been
			fun, especially at the beginning. Kara had no worries. She sold a few paintings
			here and there and accepted her parents monthly allowance without guilt. But the
			more successful she got, the more it consumed her, this need to make a name for
			herself, to be a successful working artist. It had taken its toll on their
			relationship. Her endless travel during the summers, the endless hours of
			painting during the winters had been their undoing.</p>
		<p>And Marsha had simply disappeared from her life one day. When Kara realized
			what had happened, it had been too late to salvage things. Marsha had met
			someone else and Kara had let her go. There had been no one since. Oh, plenty of
			women had shared her bed, but none had gotten into her heart. Not that many had
			even tried.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Five">
		<p>After Nana had gone to bed, Ginny sorted through the old issues of Northwest
			Magazine. When she found the one she wanted, she took her cup of hot tea and
			settled on the sofa to read. The picture of Kara Morgan stared back at her and
			Ginny scanned her face, finally settling on her blue eyes, wondering at her
			sudden curiosity for this woman. She pulled her eyes away and began reading,
			glancing back to Kara's picture occasionally. Her eyes followed her index finger
			as she read, but the article was very impersonal, shedding little light into the
			woman herself. It wasn't until the final paragraph that Ginny stumbled over the
			words.</p>
		<p>
			<i>When asked if it bothered her that she is still sometimes referred to as
				the ‘lesbian artist’, Ms. Morgan replied with ease. "I've never made my personal
				life a secret," she said. "I just don't feel it’s pertinent to my work. My
				sexual preference does not influence the way I paint and I don’t necessarily
				like being labeled that way."</i>
		</p>
		<p>A lesbian. Ginny stared at her picture again, her eyes dropping for a split
			second to the lips that curved in a smile. She closed the magazine quickly and
			sat still. Of course she had known. That was why she really went back to read
			the article. She didn’t like to just assume these things.</p>
		<p>Renee. The name was so familiar, yet it had been years.</p>
		<p>She let out a heavy sigh, finally letting in memories that she had thought
			were well buried. She had been so young and Renee had been much too dynamic for
			her to resist.</p>
		<p>But she had, she reminded herself. She leaned back, closing her eyes,
			remembering.</p>
		<p>Renee Hampton. Her first boss. Her first crush on a woman.</p>
		<p>But it was just a crush, she reminded herself. Renee had been ten years older
			and so beautiful. Ginny remembered the day Renee had looked up and caught her
			staring. Ginny had tried to look away, but Renee’s eyes had held her. They had
			been working late and Ginny had been more than happy to stay the extra few
			hours, if it meant spending time with Renee. But when Renee had insisted on
			treating Ginny to dinner, their relationship had moved beyond the workplace and
			soon Ginny found herself looking forward to weekends when Renee would drag her
			to all sorts of activities that she would never venture on alone.</p>
		<p>Even now, Ginny could remember clearly the night it happened. Renee had been
			so excited about the whale-watching excursion that Ginny hadn’t the heart to
			disappoint her, but boats made her extremely nervous. And nauseous. They had
			barely left Puget Sound when Ginny’s breakfast left her. Renee had spent the
			entire trip by her side and that night, after Ginny had apologized profusely,
			Renee had wrapped her in long arms and Ginny found herself on the receiving end
			of a very intimate hug. Warning bells had gone off immediately and by the time
			that Renee’s lips had sought Ginny’s, she had been able to pull away.</p>
		<p>
			<i>"I’m sorry. I thought you wanted this."</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>"No, I’m not . . . I don’t . . . no."</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>"Then . . . what is all this about?"</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>"I just . . . I thought we were friends."</i>
		</p>
		<p>Ginny lifted one corner of her mouth and smiled. She had been so naive. She
			hadn’t had a clue that Renee was a lesbian. Whatever attraction there had been
			for Ginny, it was just friendship. There had been nothing more. There never
			could have been. But regardless, their relationship stopped there. Two months
			later, Ginny had found another job and she had not seen Renee since.</p>
		<p>And now Kara.</p>
		<p>She sipped her tea, one hand absently thumbing through the magazine, stopping
			when Kara’s picture stared back at her.</p>
		<p>Ginny sat very still, mesmerized by the picture. Kara Morgan was an
			attractive woman but the flawless picture was breathtaking. Her hair was a
			little longer in the picture, Ginny noted. And diamond earrings sparkled in each
			ear. The few times she had seen her, Kara had not worn jewelry. Finally, with a
			sigh, she closed the magazine.</p>
		<p>"Well, it doesn't matter," she said quietly. She liked Kara. She wasn't going
			to avoid her, she decided, just because she was a lesbian. Kara would be leaving
			after the summer anyway.</p>
		<p>Although the next morning, when Kara walked in and strode purposefully
			towards the espresso machine, Ginny wasn't quite able to meet her eyes. She was
			being ridiculous, she knew, but something told her she should avoid those blue,
			blue eyes. They would be nothing but trouble.</p>
		<p>"Good morning, Kara."</p>
		<p>"Morning, Louise."</p>
		<p>"Did you have a taste for Seattle coffee this morning?"</p>
		<p>"Mocha," she said and turned amused eyes to Ginny. "Hello."</p>
		<p>"Hi," Ginny murmured, feeling embarrassed and hating herself for it. She
			shouldn't have read the article, she realized. If Kara had wanted her to know,
			she would have told her. It wasn’t any of her business, anyway. And did it
			really matter, she asked herself for the hundredth time.</p>
		<p>Kara fished out a couple of crumpled bills from her pocket and handed them to
			Ginny. When their fingers touched, Ginny pulled back quickly, as if burned, and
			met the questioning eyes across from her, but she didn’t allow those blue eyes
			to capture hers for long.</p>
		<p>Kara’s eyebrows drew together in a frown, wondering what in the world was
			going on. Then it hit her. Ginny had either re-read the article or had
			remembered it from earlier. Ginny looked nearly frightened to be in the same
			room with her. Kara had thought of inviting Ginny to dinner but now she knew she
			would never ask. She had seen that look from straight women before. Fear.</p>
		<p>Ginny had half a mind to lay the change on the counter, but then she saw the
			challenge in Kara's eyes and she dropped it onto her outstretched palm, her
			fingers raking its surface.</p>
		<p>Kara moved with her back to Louise and whispered, "Don't look so scared. It’s
			not contagious, you know."</p>
		<p>Ginny blushed and looked away. "I'm sorry," she murmured. What else could she
			say? "It’s just . . .."</p>
		<p>"Doesn’t matter."</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged and left with a curt goodbye to Louise.</p>
		<p>Why was it that some straight women found it so hard to be friends? Did they
			think that being alone with a lesbian would tarnish them? That they were in
			danger of being converted? Kara pulled out her cigarettes angrily and shoved one
			between her lips. Women! Sometimes they were a royal pain in the ass.</p>
		<p>When she reached the cabin, she sat in the truck and sipped her coffee, her
			anger subsiding. She didn't really want to make friends with Ginny, anyway. She
			would get much more work done being alone. With that, she picked up her
			sketchpad and went inside, intending to add more color to the meadow she had
			sketched that morning. She pushed thoughts of Ginny Harrison aside and began
			working. She was surprised to notice the sun setting later and she glanced at
			her watch. She had not only worked through lunch, she was missing dinner as
			well.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Six">
		<p>When three days came and went and there had been no sign of Kara, Ginny knew
			that she had to apologize. It had been unforgivable, the way she had acted. So
			she found Kara’s blue eyes disturbing? It meant absolutely nothing. Kara had not
			made even the slightest innuendo. She wasn't an unenlightened prude, she told
			herself. She could accept people for what they were and if Kara still wanted to
			be friends with her, she would make a peace offering.</p>
		<p>"I'm going to drive over to the Dobson place," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Kara hasn't been around, has she. I suppose she's working," Nana said
			absently.</p>
		<p>"Don't wait dinner on me. I'll just heat it up when I get back."</p>
		<p>"Okay, dear. I'm glad you've made a friend. Have fun." Nana turned back to
			the chicken she was frying, dismissing Ginny with a wave of her hand.</p>
		<p>Ginny parked her car next to Kara's Toyota and walked nervously to the door.
			She had not thought of what she was going to say and she was afraid that Kara
			wouldn't accept her apology. She knocked several times and waited, her feet
			kicking at the rocks absently.</p>
		<p>"Hey, I'm back here."</p>
		<p>She turned, startled. Kara stood at the side of the cabin, a cigarette
			dangling from her fingers. She disappeared again behind the cabin and Ginny
			followed. She found Kara leaning against the railing, holding a beer bottle
			lightly in her hand. When she turned blue eyes her way, Ginny could still see a
			hint of anger there.</p>
		<p>"I . . . I came to apologize," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Really? Why?" Kara turned to her and held her eyes but Ginny didn't
			flinch.</p>
		<p>"For the way I acted the other day," she finally said.</p>
		<p>"And how did you act?"</p>
		<p>Ginny looked away and sighed heavily. "God, you're not going to make this
			easy, are you?"</p>
		<p>"Should I?" Kara asked sharply.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. When I read the article again and found out . . .."</p>
		<p>"That I was a lesbian?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. I . . . it just surprised me, I guess. I didn't mean to treat you so
			badly," she said sincerely. "Your . . . personal life . . . it doesn’t matter
			one way or the other."</p>
		<p>Kara nodded. "So, you’re not afraid of me?"</p>
		<p>"Afraid?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. You seemed to be almost terrified to be in the same room with me."</p>
		<p>"No." Ginny relaxed and leaned her elbows on the railing. "No, I'm not afraid
			of you, Kara. I'd like us to be friends," she said. "If you want that," she
			added.</p>
		<p>Kara chuckled and went inside to get Ginny a beer, clearly surprised that she
			had made the effort to come here.</p>
		<p>"Do you want to ask me anything?" Kara said when she returned.</p>
		<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
		<p>"Straight women are usually curious." She slumped down into one of the chairs
			and waited for Ginny to follow.</p>
		<p>Ginny glanced at the woman who looked so relaxed suddenly, her shorts sliding
			up as she crossed one leg over the other. Ginny pulled her eyes from the long,
			tan legs stretched out before her and tipped the beer bottle to her lips. She
			wasn't exactly curious, she told herself. Well, maybe a little.</p>
		<p>"How long have you been this way?" she finally asked.</p>
		<p>Kara laughed and tossed her cigarette down and stepped on it with her hiking
			boot. "All my life, I guess. Or do you mean, how long have I known I was a
			lesbian?"</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. "Yes, that's what I mean."</p>
		<p>"In high school, I suppose, although it wasn't until college that I finally
			acted on my feelings."</p>
		<p>"And are you involved with someone now?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara laughed again. "No. Not in awhile. I've been working and I'm told I
			can't do both," she said, unable to keep the bitterness out of her voice.</p>
		<p>Ginny noticed her stinging tone, but she didn't comment on it. She waited for
			Kara to continue, but Kara clearly didn't want to share any more
			information.</p>
		<p>"Have you had dinner?" Kara asked suddenly.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"I had intended on asking you over the other morning, but . . . well, I
			didn't want to make you uncomfortable."</p>
		<p>"I'm really sorry. That was stupid of me," Ginny said. "I’m not usually so
			rude."</p>
		<p>"I've got plenty," Kara continued, as if she hadn’t spoken.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded. "Okay. Dinner would be nice."</p>
		<p>Ginny sat at the table as Kara lit a candle and placed it between them. She
			looked up into the amused eyes standing over her, but said nothing. So, Kara was
			playing games, was she?</p>
		<p>"So, what have you decided to do about Phil?" Kara asked as she handed Ginny
			a plate of pasta.</p>
		<p>"I haven't really decided to do anything," she said.</p>
		<p>"Still hiding?"</p>
		<p>"I suppose," Ginny smiled. "I'm hoping it will just go away."</p>
		<p>"Well, from what I remember about men, it won't."</p>
		<p>Ginny looked up, surprised.</p>
		<p>"What? Do you think that I've never slept with a man?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know. Have you?"</p>
		<p>"Of course." She leaned forward and grinned. "I was terrified the first time
			I thought I might be gay. I made an offer to the quarterback and he didn't turn
			me down," she said and laughed.</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And, I felt nothing, other than pain," she said and laughed again. "But, the
			first time and all." She shrugged. "But, anyway, I dated in college, too, but I
			just could never make a connection with any of them. Then I met Andrea. Six foot
			two and a star on the basketball team and I finally found out what I had been
			missing all those years. That's when I knew for sure."</p>
		<p>"What about your family?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, they went through denial for a couple of years, tried to get me to see a
			therapist and I refused. But, being the only child of a very prominent family,
			they couldn't very well disown me. And they haven't." Kara twisted pasta around
			her fork and felt Ginny watching her. "What about you? Any siblings?"</p>
		<p>"No. I was an only child, too. Only my mother never knew it," she said with
			difficulty.</p>
		<p>Kara raised her eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"Becky is four years older than I am. She hung the moon."</p>
		<p>"Or so your mother thought?"</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. "The apple of my mother's eye, yes. Fortunately, my father
			thought the same about me. We each had all the attention that we could stand."
			Her eyes clouded over and Kara waited for her to continue. "Dad died when I was
			twelve," she said softly.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>"And I was left alone, with a mother who didn't know I existed and a sister
			who never let me forget it."</p>
		<p>"Louise and your grandfather?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. My father's parents; they were great. I spent every summer out here for
			as long as I could remember. After Dad died, I came here as soon as school was
			out for the summer and didn't return until it started back again." Ginny nodded
			when Kara offered more wine and she watched as her fingers gripped the bottle,
			her nails cut neat and short.</p>
		<p>"Then what?"</p>
		<p>"College, that I paid for myself. A job and then Phil," she finished. "Very
			exciting."</p>
		<p>"And Becky?"</p>
		<p>Ginny shrugged. "I saw her at my mother's funeral. Before that, I hadn't seen
			her in years."</p>
		<p>"So your childhood rivalry continued when you were adults?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, God, yes. Believe me, she was as surprised as I was to find that I was
			even mentioned in the will," she said bitterly. "My dad's doing," she
			explained.</p>
		<p>"And I thought being an only child was tough," Kara said gently. "I'm
			sorry."</p>
		<p>Ginny looked up and smiled, knowing her eyes were sparkling with tears.
			"You're a very good cook," she said, changing the subject with ease. "I can't
			find my way around a kitchen, I'm afraid."</p>
		<p>Kara took the hint and let the conversation drift to less personal things.
			Ginny helped with the dishes, despite Kara's plea not to and left shortly
			afterwards, but not before giving Kara a quick hug and another apology. She
			supposed Ginny was lonely after all. Maybe she just missed Phil. Or maybe she
			was just tired of Louise’s company.</p>
		<p>Kara took her last cigarette out to the porch and smoked in the darkness, her
			mind wandering back to Ginny with such ease that it startled her. Perhaps Ginny
			had been wise to be afraid of her, she mused. Kara had found her eyes moving to
			Ginny time and again during the evening and she inhaled deeply on her cigarette,
			refusing to acknowledge the attraction that was growing each time she saw
			her.</p>
		<p>"She's straight," she told the darkness.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Ginny undressed quietly, not wanting to wake Nana. She had been astonished
			when she glanced at her watch on the way home. They had spent hours talking, as
			if they were old friends. Comfortable friends. Or merely familiar strangers.
			Perhaps it was true; easier to share thoughts and secrets with a virtual
			stranger than your closest friend. Whatever the reason, she had enjoyed their
			time together and she had found Kara to be a captive audience.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Seven">
		<p>Kara couldn't work and she set her brushes aside, acutely aware that she had
			again been thinking of Ginny and the quick brush of their bodies when Ginny had
			hugged her so unexpectedly. It had been three days since she had seen her but
			her image was still fresh in her mind. The way she tucked stands of blond hair
			behind her ears when she was nervous, the way her green eyes had flashed when
			she spoke of her sister, the way the corners of her mouth lifted when she
			smiled, the way her lips parted.</p>
		<p>"God," Kara groaned and she shoved out the back door and onto the porch,
			taking in deep breaths of cool air. "What are you doing?" she asked herself.
			"She’s straight. Forget about it." She went back in for a cigarette and was
			startled when the phone rang. She wasn't even aware that it worked.</p>
		<p>"Hello?"</p>
		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"I had hoped the Dobson's hadn't stopped their service. Listen, I was going
			to the park for lunch. I thought you might like to join me," she said
			uncertainly. She had wanted to see her again and she had been disappointed when
			Kara hadn't come to the store.</p>
		<p>"What time is it?"</p>
		<p>"Twelve-thirty. You haven't eaten, have you?"</p>
		<p>Kara smiled. "No. I'll meet you at the store in a few minutes."</p>
		<p>She made a quick cheese sandwich and took the remaining two beers from the
			refrigerator and left without thinking about her apparent haste. Ginny was
			waiting on the porch and walked out to meet Kara's truck even before she
			stopped.</p>
		<p>"Hi."</p>
		<p>"Hello." Their eyes met for an instant, then Ginny climbed in and slammed the
			door and Kara pulled away without another word.</p>
		<p>"I wasn't interrupting your work, I hope," Ginny said when they had settled
			at the picnic table and opened their beer.</p>
		<p>"No. Actually, I was taking a break anyway."</p>
		<p>"I got the impression that you work right through meals," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Why's that?"</p>
		<p>"Because you didn't even know what time it was."</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "I forget sometimes," she admitted.</p>
		<p>"Do you forget a lot of things when you're working?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"Like?"</p>
		<p>"Well, you mentioned the other night that you're not involved with anyone,
			that you couldn't do both," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Oh. That," Kara said and waved the words away.</p>
		<p>"Why won't you tell me? I told you about Phil," Ginny urged. She wanted to
			know more about her, about her private life. She didn’t pause to wonder why.</p>
		<p>"It's a long story," she said and smiled. "And boring," she added.</p>
		<p>"I'll be the judge of that," Ginny said and motioned for her to continue.</p>
		<p>"I was a struggling artist when I met Marsha." She smiled. "Only I didn't
			know I was struggling. My folks made sure my bank account was never empty," she
			said quietly.</p>
		<p>Ginny raised her eyebrows but said nothing.</p>
		<p>"My parents had given me a cottage on Bainbridge Island and she moved in with
			me and went to work for my father's company . . .."</p>
		<p>"Wait, wait," Ginny interrupted. "Your parents gave you a cottage? On
			Bainbridge Island?"</p>
		<p>Kara nodded sheepishly.</p>
		<p>"A view of the Sound?" she asked.</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Are they disgustingly rich or what?"</p>
		<p>"Pretty much, yes."</p>
		<p>"Okay, I'm sorry. Go on. You moved in together," Ginny said. "And?"</p>
		<p>"And she went to work each day and I painted whenever the mood struck. I sold
			a few pieces now and then and we were happy enough, I guess."</p>
		<p>"How old were you?"</p>
		<p>"I was twenty-six when we met," she said. "Anyway, there was this gallery,
			down on Long Beach that wanted to show my work. Tourists started snatching it up
			and I had to work longer to keep up and the next thing I knew I had agreed to a
			showing at a gallery in Seattle and it just went on and on."</p>
		<p>"Must have been tough," Ginny said sarcastically.</p>
		<p>"It was, really. I wasn't prepared for it. I didn't know how to pace myself.
			I would get involved in my work and a month would pass without me ever leaving
			the house. Needless to say, our relationship went down the tubes," she
			finished.</p>
		<p>"How long ago?"</p>
		<p>"Nearly three years."</p>
		<p>"And are you sorry? I mean, sacrificing your relationship for your success?"
			Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't think that's a fair question," Kara said seriously. "I wasn't
			intentionally sacrificing the relationship. It just happened. One day I realized
			that she was gone. That she had been gone and I hadn't even missed her," she
			said quietly. "I stopped for awhile. Painting, I mean."</p>
		<p>"What did you do?" Ginny asked softly. "Did you find her?"</p>
		<p>Kara shook her head. "She had already met someone else."</p>
		<p>"Oh. I’m sorry."</p>
		<p>"Anyway, I went to San Francisco for awhile, but it wasn't Seattle, so I came
			back home. Picked up a brush and . . ." she raised her hands again. "Here I
			am."</p>
		<p>"And the mural?"</p>
		<p>"Lord, that was a mistake. I was sorry I had been commissioned for that one.
			I like to work alone, most artists do. Not have tourists and town officials
			hanging over my shoulder with each stroke of the brush, making suggestions,
			asking why I did this, why didn't I do that. I couldn't wait to finish. Needless
			to say, it's not one of my best, but it's proudly displayed in downtown Yakima,
			Washington," she said and grinned. "And I haven't been back since."</p>
		<p>"Well, if I'm ever in Yakima . . .."</p>
		<p>"Yes, be sure to go by and pay your respects," Kara said and laughed.</p>
		<p>Ginny grinned, too. "I enjoy your company," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara arched an eyebrow. "And that's bad?"</p>
		<p>"No. I didn't mean it like that. I just enjoy talking with you."</p>
		<p>"Well, from what Louise said, you don't have much to choose from around
			here."</p>
		<p>"You're being difficult," Ginny said with a smile. "Just say thank you."</p>
		<p>Kara leaned forward, resting her chin on her palms. "Well, not to frighten
			you, but I enjoy your company as well."</p>
		<p>Their eyes met for an instant and Ginny felt a blush creep onto her face.
			"Thank you."</p>
		<p>They were silent for a moment, both finishing their sandwiches and tossing
			bread to the chipmunks that came begging.</p>
		<p>"Nana says you sketch in the early morning," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Not always. Sunset, too. The evening is my favorite time of day," she said
			quietly. "All of the colors come together at that one precise moment and it's as
			if they're suspended in time, just for the barest of seconds and I'm never quick
			enough to get it just right, though I try time and again," she said.</p>
		<p>"What?" Ginny asked, mesmerized by her soft voice.</p>
		<p>Kara smiled. "I paint mornings, evenings, never daylight. It's too sharp,
			there is no color, only brightness," she explained.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, as if she understood perfectly.</p>
		<p>"And the moon," she added.</p>
		<p>"That's right. There's a full moon in all your paintings," Ginny said,
			remembering the article.</p>
		<p>"I love the moon. I could stare at it for hours, I think," Kara said softly.
			"It's like it's watching you. Everything you do, the moon sees."</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at her, feeling hypnotized by her words as those blue eyes
			pulled her in.</p>
		<p>"I'm going out this evening. Would you like to tag along and see what I
			mean?" Kara asked, surprising herself. She normally hated having someone watch
			her work.</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't be bothering you?"</p>
		<p>"No. As long as you don't offer suggestions."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. "I'd like that," she said.</p>
		<p>"So would I," Kara said as their eyes met. "I'll come for you at seven."</p>
		<p>Nana was envious that Ginny was going to watch Kara work. She had only spied
			her that first morning. Kara had never again been on the trail by the lake.</p>
		<p>"What about dinner?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"I'll get something when we come back," Ginny said. She was drying her hair
			and it was nearly seven already. She hated to make Kara wait.</p>
		<p>But Kara was seated patiently in the living room, listening to Nana and she
			raised her eyes to Ginny and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Sorry," Ginny said. "Bad habit, but I'm working on it."</p>
		<p>"No problem. We've got time," Kara said. Her eyes followed Ginny as she bent
			to kiss Louise on the cheek and they flickered over her jeans before resting
			again on her face.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt Kara's eyes on her and she was acutely aware of the sensations
			rippling through her body. She wouldn't meet her eyes as they walked to the
			door.</p>
		<p>"Have fun, you two," Nana called.</p>
		<p>"Where are we going?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara backed out of the driveway, her arm resting along the back of Ginny’s
			seat and she peered out the rear window.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt Kara's fingers graze her shoulder as she turned back around and
			Ginny felt goosebumps on her neck from their touch. It frightened her.</p>
		<p>"There's a small lake on Battle Canyon Creek," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"How did you find that? It's a well-kept secret among the locals," Ginny
			chided.</p>
		<p>"You've been there?"</p>
		<p>"I used to fish there with my grandfather," Ginny said. "I haven't been there
			in years."</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged and turned down a Forest Service road. "It wasn't hard to find,
			but the road's bumpy as hell," she said.</p>
		<p>The sun was falling below the trees when they parked, but Ginny suspected
			that the colors weren't yet right, because Kara didn't seem to be hurrying. She
			gathered her sketchpad and colored chalk and led the way along a path. There
			were only two other cars there and Ginny recognized them as locals.</p>
		<p>"There's a break in the trees just as the sun sets," Kara explained. "The
			lake is a perfect reflection."</p>
		<p>They walked up the trail, but instead of heading to the water, Kara went into
			the trees and stopped at a rise with the water below them.</p>
		<p>"I don't mean to ignore you," Kara apologized as she flipped open her
			sketchpad.</p>
		<p>"Go ahead. I'll just watch," Ginny said. She sat down in the grass a few feet
			from Kara and pulled her knees up to her chin. Kara sat cross-legged on the
			ground, faded jeans covering the tanned legs Ginny was used to seeing. She
			watched as Kara's fingers found the color she wanted and before Ginny's eyes,
			the lake appeared on the paper. As the sun crept lower, Ginny became aware of
			the changing colors. The few clouds in the sky reflected the orange of the sun
			and she watched as Kara added that, too. Ginny took her eyes away from the woman
			next to her and forced herself to look at the water as it changed from a
			brilliant blue to a shimmering orange.</p>
		<p>Kara added color, too and soon her lake was as orange as the sky as the sun
			hung, suspended just over the horizon for a split second and Ginny held her
			breath as it silently slipped from view. Kara's hand stilled and Ginny looked up
			to find Kara watching her.</p>
		<p>"Well?" Kara’s quiet voice broke the silence.</p>
		<p>"It was beautiful," Ginny said softly. "Can I see?" she asked.</p>
		<p>Kara hesitated, then handed over her sketch and she watched Ginny's face
			break out in smile.</p>
		<p>"You've captured it exactly. It's as if the sun is still there, hanging on to
			the day," she said quietly. "You've put your moon in, I see," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara clinched her jaw and met Ginny’s intense green eyes as they searched her
			own. She could almost see the currents that passed between them, feel the
			electricity in her veins as green eyes locked on blue. Ginny finally lowered her
			gaze, her eyes closing heavily as she sighed.</p>
		<p>Ginny felt her pulse throbbing in her neck and she acknowledged the growing
			attraction she had for this woman. She could feel it. She took a deep breath,
			trying to push it away. They sat quietly, legs crossed before them and watched
			the color drain from the sky. Ginny became uncomfortably aware of the intimate
			setting as dusk settled over the forest. She should get up, she should suggest
			they go back, back to the safety of Nana’s company.</p>
		<p>But she didn’t.</p>
		<p>"Kara?" Ginny asked, as she leaned back on her elbows.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
		<p>"What's it like?"</p>
		<p>"What?" Kara asked, turning to her.</p>
		<p>"Kissing a woman?" she asked before she could stop herself.</p>
		<p>Kara tried to read her eyes, but the approaching darkness prevented it. "Why
			do you want to know?"</p>
		<p>"I was just . . . wondering, I guess. Kissing is nice, you know, but some
			men, well, they just forget about it, I think."</p>
		<p>"Phil?"</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head. Phil wasn’t much for kissing. She sighed again. Why in
			the world had she started this conversation?</p>
		<p>"Never mind," she murmured.</p>
		<p>Kara smiled. So, Ginny was curious. That surprised her.</p>
		<p>"From what I remember, men were much more interested in bigger and better
			things. Never wanted to take the time for kissing. That’s the great thing about
			women," Kara said. "Most women like to kiss. And of course, a woman knows."</p>
		<p>"Knows what?" Ginny asked hesitantly.</p>
		<p>Kara turned to Ginny. "A woman knows what you want and how it makes you
			feel," she said quietly.</p>
		<p>Ginny swallowed, the sound echoing in the quiet forest and she felt herself
			drawn to this woman sitting so close to her. Like a magnet, she thought, as she
			struggled to pull her eyes away from Kara’s. She felt as helpless as a moth
			drawn to fire. She was far too aware of her and was thankful for the darkness,
			as images of Kara's lips on hers flashed through her mind, making her stomach
			flutter. They stared at each other for countless seconds, then Kara moved away
			and gathered up her work.</p>
		<p>"Come on. We better get you back," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny accepted Kara's outstretched hand and their fingers entwined as Kara
			pulled her to her feet. Kara didn't immediately release her hand and Ginny
			didn't pull away. Not until she felt the fire burning between them did she
			finally drop Kara’s hand.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eight">
		<p>Ginny spent a fitful night, tossing in her bed as she remembered Kara's
			words. "A woman knows." How would Kara's kiss be? Hot and wet? Or would it be
			slow and tender?</p>
		<p>Ginny groaned and rolled over, hating herself for her thoughts. What was she
			doing? Why did this woman occupy her mind so? And thoughts of kissing her, no
			less! She was not attracted to women! She never had been! What she was thinking
			was insane!</p>
		<p>
			<i>Renee.</i>
		</p>
		<p>No. She hadn't been attracted to Renee. At least, not sexually. And she was
			positive that she was not sexually attracted to Kara, either.</p>
		<p>"You're straight, for God's sake," she murmured. "Act like it."</p>
		<p>She got out of bed and went into the kitchen for a drink of cold water and
			she stood at the sink, watching the moon overhead. Nearly full. Kara's moon.</p>
		<p>Was she watching it, too? Or was she sleeping peacefully, unaware of the
			effect she was having on Ginny?</p>
		<p>"She's not blind," Ginny whispered. And how embarrassing would that be? Kara
			had not so much as said one inappropriate thing. Ginny found Kara's eyes on her
			sometimes, but that was all.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>Ginny turned and found Nana watching her. "I'm sorry. Did I wake you?"</p>
		<p>"Are you all right?"</p>
		<p>She held up her glass. "Thirsty."</p>
		<p>"I think I'll have some, too," she said and moved into the room. "Must be
			this moon. I can't sleep a wink."</p>
		<p>Ginny glanced up again at the moon and again thought of Kara. "Yes. I know
			what you mean," she murmured.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Kara paced her room in the darkness, a cigarette glowing hotly in her hands.
			"What's it like?" The soft words echoed in her brain again and again. She shoved
			one hand into her hair and took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. It had
			been far too tempting.
			<i>What's it like to kiss a woman? Here, let me show
				you</i>.
		</p>
		<p>She should really stay away from Ginny. It was becoming uncomfortable to be
			around her. She laughed out loud, thinking it hadn't been since college that
			she'd been attracted to a straight woman.</p>
		<p>And it had been a very long time since she'd had such a consuming need to
			kiss someone, she thought.</p>
		<p>So she stayed away. And she painted. She was inspired, if nothing else and
			she started on the sunset the next day, working feverishly all day. When she
			reached for a beer that evening, she remembered she hadn't thought to buy more
			and she opened a bottle of wine instead. While her soup heated, she took her
			wine and cigarette out to the porch and sat, listening to the evening approach.
		</p>
		<p>She sat until darkness surrounded her, her cigarette glowing in the night.
			Her thoughts drifted to the previous evening and she let them. She saw Ginny
			sitting on the grass beside her, leaning on her elbows, watching her with those
			intense green eyes. Had she been merely curious? Kara brought the cigarette to
			her lips and inhaled deeply. Possibly. Or maybe Ginny felt the electricity
			between them, too.</p>
		<p>No. She was straight, Kara reminded herself. And straight women were curious.
			But still, there was something happening between them. She could feel it and she
			suspected that Ginny could feel it, too. Would she even chance seeing Kara
			again? Had she been afraid that Kara might actually try to kiss her?</p>
		<p>She stood up suddenly, putting a halt to her thoughts. She ate inside, barely
			tasting the soup as her mind remained focused on Ginny.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"You never said how it went the other night," Nana said over dinner two
			nights later.</p>
		<p>"With Kara?"</p>
		<p>Nana nodded as she cut into her steak.</p>
		<p>"It was interesting. I never noticed the colors before," Ginny said. "How
			they change nearly every second before the sun goes down," she said quietly.</p>
		<p>"Is she any good?"</p>
		<p>"Very. She captured it exactly," Ginny said, remembering how Kara's fingers
			had moved over the paper, snatching up color after color without looking. "She
			has this thing about the moon," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"The moon?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. She puts a full moon in all of her paintings," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Well, I'd like to see one of them, wouldn't you," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Yes. I would."</p>
		<p>"Does she have any finished?"</p>
		<p>"She didn't say," Ginny said. And she hadn't thought to ask. She had been too
			busy wondering about kissing a woman to ask. She blushed, putting a halt to her
			thoughts. No need to go over all that again. She had already spent two sleepless
			nights.</p>
		<p>"Maybe we should have her over to dinner again," Nana said. "You seem to have
			become friends."</p>
		<p>"Yes. I like her," Ginny said carefully. And she did like her, it was true.
			She only wished she wouldn't constantly think about kissing her.</p>
		<p>Nana stood back and watched her. "Are you all right, Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Of course. Why do you ask?"</p>
		<p>"You've been quiet. Your answers are short." She watched her for awhile
			longer. "Are you thinking about Phil?" she asked.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. No, Phil had definitely not been in her thoughts lately. "I'm
			fine, Nana. Really. And, no, I haven't been thinking about Phil."</p>
		<p>"Well, he hasn't called in a week or so, has he?"</p>
		<p>"No, he hasn't."</p>
		<p>"Maybe he's waiting for you to call," she prompted.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled again. "Nana, don't start," she said gently.</p>
		<p>"Well, I just don't understand you. If it's me you're worried about, don't.
			I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. And, in case you haven't
			noticed, I enjoy running the store. Your investment would be safe."</p>
		<p>"I know. You're wonderful at it. But Phil and I . . . we just needed some
			time apart," she said.</p>
		<p>"Honey, I know marriage is a big step. But don't run from it. When you find a
			good man that loves you, you better grab him. They don't come along every day,"
			she said.</p>
		<p>"Nana, when did you know that Grandpa was right for you?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'd had my eye on him," she said with a wink. "He just didn't know it."
			She put her fork down and Ginny could tell she was remembering. "The first time
			he kissed me, it was magic. Pure magic. I had been waiting for months, but he
			was a damn fool and thought he would offend me if he tried to kiss me." She
			laughed. "By the time that he actually got around to it, I was so ready for it,
			I nearly passed out."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. Magic. That's how it should be. That's how she wanted it to be.
			Was it magic when Phil kissed her? Had it been that first time? She tried to
			remember when they had first kissed. A lunch date, and he had brushed her cheek.
			Then he had cooked dinner for her and had stolen a kiss as she had poured wine.
			But magic? No, she wouldn't have called it magic.</p>
		<p>"Are you worried about Phil not being the right one, dear?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not certain that he is," she admitted.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, you'll know. But he's good for you, isn't he?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. He's good." And he was. He just didn't stir her soul like she needed
			him to.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Nine">
		<p>Kara had purposefully gone to the store during lunch, hoping that Ginny would
			be out. And she was. Nana greeted her with a smile and drew her inside.</p>
		<p>"I'm afraid that Ginny's at the park," she apologized.</p>
		<p>"That's okay. I ran out of beer," Kara said and took two six-packs from the
			shelf. She looked around. "You don't happen to have any tofu, do you?"</p>
		<p>"Tow what?"</p>
		<p>"Never mind," Kara said and laughed. She picked through the fresh vegetables
			and bought a few more bags of pasta. "I can make do with this," she said.</p>
		<p>"Ginny will be disappointed she missed you," Nana said. "Why don't you come
			over for dinner again?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, Louise, thanks, but I don't want to trouble you with my diet," she
			said.</p>
		<p>"No trouble," Nana said, racking her brain, trying to think of something she
			could cook without meat.</p>
		<p>"Really, but I appreciate the offer," Kara said, letting out a sigh of
			relief. It was short-lived, however. The bell jingled over the door and she
			turned and met green eyes across the room.</p>
		<p>"I thought that was your Land Cruiser outside," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Beer," Kara said and she shoved a bill at Nana.</p>
		<p>"Have you been working?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes. It's coming along."</p>
		<p>They stood watching each other, Kara not realizing that Nana was trying to
			give her change.</p>
		<p>"Sorry," she murmured and held out her hand. "Well, I better go. See you
			around," she said. She had nearly escaped out the door when Ginny called to
			her.</p>
		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?" She turned around and Ginny walked over to her.</p>
		<p>"Come to dinner?"</p>
		<p>"I think Louise is out of vegetable dishes," she said quietly.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled. "Come early. There's a trail at the park I want to show you,"
			she said. "And don't worry. We'll do something with rice," she added.</p>
		<p>Kara's eyes lingered for a moment, then she nodded. "Okay. But don't go to
			any trouble."</p>
		<p>"Come about six?"</p>
		<p>Kara nodded again, knowing she was foolish to accept. The less time she spent
			in Ginny's company, the better. What was it about this woman? Green eyes
			remained fixed on her and she smiled weakly.</p>
		<p>Ginny watched her retreating back until Kara was out of sight and she sighed.
			Why had she insisted on dinner? She knew she was playing with fire but that
			hardly mattered anymore.</p>
		<p>Ginny was chopping vegetables for their stir-fry when Kara knocked on the
			door.</p>
		<p>"Go ahead. I can finish," Nana said and waved her away. "But I'll wait for
			you to cook. I'm not really certain what you're trying to make here."</p>
		<p>"I'm not really certain myself, Nana."</p>
		<p>She wiped her hands on a towel before opening the door. Kara had traded her
			shorts for jeans and her T-shirt was tucked inside neatly. Ginny's eyes traveled
			slowly upward, stopping only when blue eyes locked with hers. She drew a nervous
			breath as she stared at the taller woman.</p>
		<p>Kara held up a bottle of wine. "I hated to come empty handed again."</p>
		<p>Ginny shook herself, finally stepping back.</p>
		<p>"Thank you. Let me give it to Nana, then we can go to the park."</p>
		<p>Kara watched her, her eyes following her as she walked away.</p>
		<p>Ginny was aware of Kara's eyes burning into her and she had to force herself
			to keep walking. But when she was safely seated in Kara's vehicle, she couldn't
			seem to relax. She was aware of Kara's nearness like never before and she
			refused to look at her as she drove. She closed her eyes for a moment. I'm not
			attracted to her! Not like that. When they parked, they sat for a few seconds,
			their eyes lighting everywhere except on each other. Finally, Ginny opened the
			door and Kara followed suit.</p>
		<p>"The trail follows the stream," Ginny said and they walked in silence, past
			the picnic table where they had shared lunch.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"You're awfully quiet. Is everything okay?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes, of course. I just wanted you to see the stream." She managed a weak
			smile as Kara's eyes peered into hers and she finally looked away, afraid. "I
			don't know about the colors, though. Probably too dark in the woods," she said,
			continuing.</p>
		<p>They walked on, the shadows lengthening as they followed the small stream.
			Ginny seemed nervous and Kara wondered why. Was she afraid to be alone with her?
			No. Ginny was the one who had suggested the walk, not Kara.</p>
		<p>Ginny tried to keep her breath even and steady as she walked, but this
			woman's nearness wrecked havoc on her system. The walk had been a mistake, she
			realized now. She had simply wanted to spend time alone with her, without Nana.
			Time to talk. But they had been doing very little talking. Instead, their
			glances had collided time and again.</p>
		<p>Kara's hand on her arm stopped her and she looked up.</p>
		<p>"In the spider web," Kara said softly and motioned with her hand. A butterfly
			had been caught in the web and its legs were captured, but it continued to
			struggle to escape.</p>
		<p>"Let's save it," Ginny said and reached for it. Kara stopped her.</p>
		<p>"It's probably dinner. And breakfast," she said.</p>
		<p>"But it's too pretty to leave," Ginny said, her eyes turning sad at the
			thought of the beautiful butterfly becoming dinner for a spider.</p>
		<p>Kara agree and reached up to untangle the butterfly, trying not to disturb
			the web. The butterfly wrapped around Kara's finger and she gently pulled the
			web free.</p>
		<p>"Oh," Ginny breathed. "Let me see." She reached for Kara's hand and brought
			it to her, the butterfly still clinging to Kara's finger.</p>
		<p>As they watched, it flew away into the trees without a second look to its
			rescuers. Kara lowered her hand, Ginny's fingers still wrapped around it. They
			stood there for seconds, minutes before their hands finally drew apart.</p>
		<p>Ginny was aware of her heart beating, pounding in her ears and she forced her
			eyes from Kara. Why did this woman affect her? This
			<i>woman</i>. Ever since
			Ginny had laid eyes on her, her mind and body had asked a thousand questions.
			Questions that she struggled to answer.
		</p>
		<p>"Come on," Kara said quietly and continued down the trail.</p>
		<p>Ginny watched her, her feet still firmly planted. Kara looked completely at
			home in her jeans and hiking boots. Comfortable. Loose jeans that were snug on
			her backside, gently swaying as Kara walked and Ginny found she couldn't pull
			her eyes away.</p>
		<p>"Are you coming?" Kara called, breaking Ginny out of her self-induced trance.
			Well, not entirely self-induced. The woman in the jeans had something to do with
			it. Ginny finally moved, walking briskly to catch up and they continued along
			the path in silence, both fumbling with their thoughts, looking for something
			safe to say.</p>
		<p>"Is it too dark here?" Ginny finally asked.</p>
		<p>"It's nice. Pretty." She stopped where boulders had fallen and formed small
			rapids in the creek. "This would be nice at night, the moon overhead," Kara said
			softly. "The trees would make perfect shadows on the water."</p>
		<p>Ginny wasn't watching the water. She was watching Kara, watching as her chest
			rose and fell with each breath. She lowered her glance, settling on the soft
			swell of Kara's breasts. She wore no bra. Her eyes found Kara's nipples as they
			strained against her T-shirt and when she realized she was staring, she tore her
			eyes away, her lids slamming shut for a brief moment and she took a deep breath,
			savoring the smell of the forest and trying to come to her senses. What are you
			doing?</p>
		<p>"I thought you might like it," she finally managed to say.</p>
		<p>"I do. It's very beautiful," Kara said quietly, but her eyes were fixed on
			Ginny, not the stream.</p>
		<p>"Nana will be waiting for me to start dinner," Ginny said, but she made no
			move to go, aware that Kara was watching her. She kept her eyes glued to the
			stream.</p>
		<p>"Yes," Kara murmured. "We should go. Thanks for showing me this. I can
			appreciate beautiful spots like this without having to paint them."</p>
		<p>Ginny looked up and let her eyes settle on Kara's for a moment, then turned
			and led the way back.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Ten">
		<p>Kara called Ginny at the store two days later. She had stayed away, hoping to
			give herself time to quell the budding attraction she felt between them.
			Attraction that she knew now was not one-sided. Ginny's eyes were too expressive
			to hide that. But Kara would take it no farther. That was a line she would not
			cross. Instead, she would try to be a friend to Ginny. She knew that Ginny was
			having some issues with her relationship with Phil. Maybe she just needed a
			friend to talk through them. Kara could do that.</p>
		<p>"I'm having an early dinner," she said. "Want to join me?"</p>
		<p>Ginny hesitated only a moment before agreeing. She realized she had missed
			Kara.</p>
		<p>Kara fussed over the lasagna most of the afternoon, thankful there was some
			garlic bread in the freezer. She had not shopped with the intention of having a
			dinner guest when she'd left Seattle but her homemade lasagna was one of her
			favorites.</p>
		<p>They sat on the porch while the bread heated, sipping wine and Ginny watched
			as Kara lit her cigarette.</p>
		<p>"You don't smoke much, do you?"</p>
		<p>Kara laughed. "I've been in the process of quitting for several months now.
			Does it bother you?"</p>
		<p>"No," Ginny said. She wondered if it had bothered Marsha. "Do you date?" she
			asked suddenly. If Kara was surprised by the question, she didn't show it.</p>
		<p>"Some," Kara said. "You?" Kara raised one eyebrow as she watched Ginny.</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled and looked away. "No."</p>
		<p>"Still holding out for Phil?"</p>
		<p>"Well, there aren't a lot of eligible men out here in Chiwaukum," she
			said.</p>
		<p>"Oh."</p>
		<p>"Not that I've been looking," Ginny added quickly. "I mean, technically, Phil
			and I are still an item," she said.</p>
		<p>"But?"</p>
		<p>"But, like I said before, there should be more. You know?"</p>
		<p>Kara nodded.</p>
		<p>"He's a wonderful man, and I should be thankful that he wants me, I
			guess."</p>
		<p>"But you're looking for that maddening desire?" Kara asked with just a hint
			of teasing in her voice.</p>
		<p>"Yes. You probably think I'm silly," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Not at all. Everyone should hope to find that," Kara said.</p>
		<p>"What about you? Are you still looking for it?"</p>
		<p>"I guess we're all looking," Kara said and shrugged.</p>
		<p>"Has there been anyone since Marsha?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"In my life or in my bed?" Kara asked with a grin.</p>
		<p>"Both?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I've dated, if that's what you mean. And a few have stayed the night,
			but none that I wanted to start a relationship with."</p>
		<p>"Do you get lonely?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>"Not really. I've always been a loner. I've never felt the need to surround
			myself with people, friends. That's where Marsha and I differed. She always had
			a lot of friends."</p>
		<p>"And when you painted?"</p>
		<p>"She left and went out with them," Kara finished. "I didn't mind,
			really."</p>
		<p>"Do you miss her?" Ginny asked gently.</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "Sometimes. I'm not certain if I miss her or I just miss what
			we had."</p>
		<p>"Does it bother you to talk about her?"</p>
		<p>"No. I'm past that. It has been a long time."</p>
		<p>"Were you still in love with her when she left?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara leaned forward and smiled. "You certainly are full of questions
			tonight," she said.</p>
		<p>"Were you?" she asked again.</p>
		<p>Kara sat back and inhaled deeply on her cigarette, letting the smoke out
			slowly. "I guess I thought I was," she finally said.</p>
		<p>"Meaning?"</p>
		<p>"Meaning I hadn't realized that we had fallen out of love," she said quietly.
			"It just happened and I never even knew."</p>
		<p>"You blame yourself?"</p>
		<p>"I guess you were right. I got so involved with my work that I forgot about
			my relationship."</p>
		<p>"What about-"</p>
		<p>"Enough!" Kara said and laughed. "Dinner, please," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara again lit a candle and placed it between them, then served them both
			heaping plates of lasagna with the garlic bread.</p>
		<p>"My turn," Kara said after she had filled their wineglasses.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
		<p>"Phil. What's it like with him?"</p>
		<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I know he wants to marry you and you're hiding up here, trying to
			decide. But, what do you do with him?"</p>
		<p>"In bed?" Ginny asked, shocked.</p>
		<p>Kara laughed lightly. "Please. Spare me the details." She grinned. "No, I
			mean, what do you do together? Where do you go?"</p>
		<p>"Oh," Ginny said, relieved. "Well, the usual things. Dinner, movies, out with
			friends. That sort of thing. Phil likes to cook, so we stayed in a lot,
			too."</p>
		<p>"Did you live together?" Kara asked.</p>
		<p>"No. I was firm about that. I needed my space," she said.</p>
		<p>"Is he any good?" Kara asked and flashed a grin.</p>
		<p>"Good?"</p>
		<p>"In bed?" Kara asked easily.</p>
		<p>Ginny blushed hotly. Why on earth were they having this conversation? "It's
			okay. I mean . . . sure, the sex is . . . fine," she stammered, feeling a sudden
			need to defend her relationship with Phil. The sex wasn't great but she would
			never admit this to Kara.</p>
		<p>"He's surely not the only one you've slept with, is he?"</p>
		<p>Ginny blushed again. "No, he's not."</p>
		<p>"Good. I would hate to think that I've slept with more men then you have,"
			Kara grinned.</p>
		<p>"That would be ironic, yes," Ginny said and matched her grin. "There was only
			one other, though. I won't count my high school sweetheart. He was only allowed
			to touch my breasts," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara leaned forward and raised her eyebrows mischievously. "Lucky him," she
			said.</p>
		<p>Ginny blushed yet again and had a hard time dragging her eyes away from
			Kara's.</p>
		<p>"What's it like? With a woman, I mean," Ginny asked shyly.</p>
		<p>"You mean, what do we do?"</p>
		<p>"No. I can imagine . . . I mean, I know what . . . you do, I guess, but . . .
			I don't. What I mean is . . . oh, never mind," she said, thoroughly embarrassed
			now. "Forget it."</p>
		<p>"No. What do you want to know?" Kara asked seriously.</p>
		<p>Thoughts of Renee suddenly came to her and Ginny very nearly blurted out her
			story but she stopped herself. There was absolutely no need for Kara to know
			about Renee.</p>
		<p>"Never mind," she said again.</p>
		<p>Kara stood and took her empty plate into the kitchen, but called over her
			shoulder. "It's okay to ask, you know. It's only natural to be curious about
			things you don't understand."</p>
		<p>Ginny rested her head in her hands. Curious? Much too curious, she told
			herself.</p>
		<p>Kara stood in the kitchen and watched Ginny as the candlelight flickered
			around her. She had been clearly surprised by her question. She wondered how she
			would have answered it.</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded when Kara returned with the bottle of wine and she watched her
			pour, her eyes locking on long fingers that held her glass lightly. She had
			really nice hands, Ginny noted.</p>
		<p>"That was a delicious meal, by the way," she murmured, pushing her plate
			away.</p>
		<p>"Thanks." Kara searched for a safe topic, something to put them both at ease,
			but nothing came to her.</p>
		<p>"I am curious about one thing," Ginny finally said and the words were out
			before she could stop them. "What kind of women do you find attractive?"</p>
		<p>Kara nearly choked on her wine. Darkness had settled and the candle flickered
			between them. Ginny met Kara's gaze shyly but did not look away.</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>"I was just wondering," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>Kara let out a deep breath, knowing she was dangerously close to crossing
			that line. And telling herself that Ginny was straight was doing absolutely no
			good.</p>
		<p>"Okay. You mean physical appearance or what?"</p>
		<p>Ginny was aware of the sound of her heartbeat and her hand trembled as she
			set her wineglass down. But she asked anyway.</p>
		<p>"If I were a lesbian, would you be attracted to me?" Ginny asked quietly.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Jesus. She actually expects me to answer that?</i>
		</p>
		<p>Kara twirled her wineglass nervously in her hand, desperately searching for a
			safe answer to the unexpected question that hung between them. She leaned
			forward slightly and rested her elbows on the table.</p>
		<p>"You want me to honestly answer that question?"</p>
		<p>Ginny was swallowed up by blue eyes and she knew she had crossed into
			dangerous territory, but yes, she wanted her to answer it honestly. And she
			realized she wanted the answer to be "yes".</p>
		<p>"I'm just wondering what kind of women you find attractive," she
			murmured.</p>
		<p>"You're very . . . attractive," Kara said softly as she took in every detail
			of Ginny's face. "And if you were a lesbian, we wouldn't be sitting at this
			table talking. We'd be in my bed, making love until dawn."</p>
		<p>Ginny's breath caught in her throat and she swallowed with difficulty,
			knowing Kara could see how much her words had affected her. She forced her eyes
			away and took her wineglass, nearly spilling it as she brought it to her
			lips.</p>
		<p>"But, since you're not a lesbian, it doesn't really matter, does it?"</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head but refused to meet Kara's eyes.</p>
		<p>She slept fitfully, images coming to her in the night, images of a woman,
			touching her, kissing her. Images of Kara as she laid beside her, her naked body
			warm to her touch, her naked body sliding over her own. And Ginny went to her
			willingly, her own hands seeking, her own mouth opening under Kara's.</p>
		<p>"God," she whispered and she sat up, perspiration glistening on her body and
			she buried her face in her hands, embarrassed by her dreams. She brushed her
			damp hair away from her face and closed her eyes, pushing Kara away from
			her.</p>
		<p>It wasn't even yet five, but she got up, her feet carrying her numbly to the
			kitchen and she made coffee, then stood under the cool spray of the shower,
			washing away the last images of her dream.</p>
		<p>"You were up early," Nana accused later.</p>
		<p>"Couldn't sleep," Ginny said and she looked away, afraid her eyes would
			reveal her thoughts.</p>
		<p>"You need to get more exercise. Why don't you walk with me in the mornings?"
		</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed. "Someone's got to open up the store."</p>
		<p>"Well, then, do it in the evenings. You ought to ask Kara. I'm sure she would
			walk with you," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny nearly blushed and shook her head. "I would hate to disturb her work,"
			she managed to get out.</p>
		<p>"Did you have fun last night?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes. We just had dinner and visited," Ginny said carefully.</p>
		<p>"She's a nice girl, isn't she?"</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded. "Yes. She is." Very nice.</p>
		<p>"Did you get a chance to see any of her paintings?"</p>
		<p>"No. I didn't think to ask," Ginny said.</p>
		<p>"Well, what do you talk about, if not her work?"</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at her, at a loss for words.</p>
		<p>"Ask her sometime, will you?" Nana continued.</p>
		<p>"I will," Ginny promised. She bent to kiss her cheek. "Enjoy your walk. I'll
			see you later."</p>
