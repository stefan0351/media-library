<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Thirty-Two -->

<p>Ginny looked up at the sound of the bell, like she always did. Her smile
			faltered and she dropped the change she was handing to Mrs. Peters, listening as
			it clattered to the counter top, then the floor. Kara.</p>
		<p>"I'll get it," Mrs. Peters said, but Ginny hardly heard. Startled green eyes
			met blue across the room.</p>
		<p>Her heart beat painfully in her chest and she couldn't breathe. But Kara was
			there, standing by the door, still holding it open, as if she were afraid to
			come inside.</p>
		<p>Ginny moved, her feet carrying her slowly around the counter, her eyes never
			leaving Kara's. She stopped a mere foot from her, surprised to find fear in
			Kara's eyes.</p>
		<p>"Don't you ever . . . leave me again," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>Ginny let her breath out slowly, then moved into Kara's arms, pressing
			against her warmth, feeling so much relief that she thought she would surely
			die. Strong arms held her close and she breathed in Kara's scent.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . .."</p>
		<p>But Ginny pulled out of her arms and turned to Nana, who was watching them
			with wariness. </p>
		<p>"Can you manage without me?" </p>
		<p>"I suppose," Nana said, unable to meet Kara's eyes.</p>
		<p>Ginny turned and walked out the door, feeling Kara's presence behind her. Why
			was she here? Did she come back for Ginny or did she come to finally explain?
			She stopped at Kara's Land Cruiser, then turned and met her eyes, tears forming
			in her own at the profound sadness in Kara's.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . I . . .."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk yet," she said, wiping a tear off her cheek.</p>
		<p>Kara drove quickly down the road, her eyes glancing at Ginny frequently, but
			Ginny refused to look at her. "We need to talk," Kara finally said. "Do you want
			to go to your house?"</p>
		<p>"No. I'm not ready to talk," Ginny said quietly.</p>
		<p>Kara drove to the Dobson cabin in silence, glancing occasionally at the woman
			beside her, the woman who simply stared out the window as they drove. Once
			inside, they stood staring at each other for countless seconds, both trying
			desperately to read the other's eyes.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," Kara finally said. "I just wanted you to have a chance . .
			.."</p>
		<p>"I said . . . I don't want to talk yet," Ginny whispered. She went to Kara
			and slipped into her arms. "I just want to love you," she said softly.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny," Kara murmured into her hair, breathing deeply. All the endless
			weeks of pain vanished as her hands moved over Ginny's soft body, molding her to
			her own. </p>
		<p>"I need to . . . be with you," Ginny whispered. "I need to know if it's
			true," she said.</p>
		<p>"If what is true?"</p>
		<p>"I saw it in your painting, but I thought maybe I was just hoping, wishing,"
			she said, her voice ripe with emotion and unshed tears. At Kara's frown, she
			said, "I went to Seattle looking for you. I saw the tree. I bought it."</p>
		<p>Kara touched Ginny's face, tears brimming in her own eyes.</p>
		<p>"Tell me I didn't imagine the love in that painting."</p>
		<p>"I knew for certain that I loved you that night," she whispered. "And I was
			afraid."</p>
		<p>Ginny drew Kara's head to hers, meeting her lips for the first time, feeling
			as weak as she had that other time, so long ago now. "Show me," she
			whispered.</p>
		<p>Kara drew Ginny's naked body to her, touching her breasts with gentle
			fingers, feeling the familiar hardness against her palms. She had thought, once,
			that she might never again feel Ginny beside her, like this. But Ginny was here,
			she was real and Kara loved her with a passion she had only dreamed of. Her
			mouth left Ginny's, moving to her breasts and Kara buried her face between them
			and she cried.</p>
		<p>"Kara?"</p>
		<p>"I love you," Kara whispered. "I'm so sorry. I was just scared to death over
			what I felt."</p>
		<p>Ginny pulled her up, letting her own tears fall and she pressed her face into
			Kara's neck. "Don't cry, sweetheart," she whispered. "I love you so very much.
			I'll never hurt you."</p>
		<p>Ginny pushed Kara gently on the bed and covered her, needing to show her how
			much she loved her. Her kisses were soft, feather-light on her face, her eyes.
			Words of love poured from her and she murmured in Kara's ear, promising her,
			tempting her with the ecstasy that was to come. Her tongue slid slowly over
			Kara's, into her mouth, needing to know her again. She moved to her breasts, her
			tongue raking each nipple in turn, feeling them harden, taking each into her
			mouth, feeling them swell even more as she gently sucked, gently teased.</p>
		<p>"Ginny."</p>
		<p>"Yes. I'm here." Ginny's tongue moved over her, tasting her, wetting a path
			that her mouth followed and she heard Kara's heart beating loudly, heard her
			breath catch when Ginny kissed her thighs, moving over her, touching her first
			with gentle hands, soothing her, spreading her thighs even more. She breathed
			the scent of Kara and she was lost. She knelt between her legs, eyes closed as
			she touched her, fingers moving through her silkiness, then inside her as Kara
			moaned softly. </p>
		<p>"I love you so much," Ginny whispered. She lay down and buried her face
			between Kara's legs, tasting her, loving her. Her tongue moved deep within her,
			feeling Kara drawing her in. She took her gently between her lips, her tongue
			moving over her, stroking her, feeling Kara move with her, writhing under her
			mouth before yielding to the pleasure that Ginny brought to her. Kara clutched
			Ginny's head, fingers entwining in her hair, and she held Ginny to her, hard,
			pushing her hips against her face, begging her.</p>
		<p>"Ginny . . . oh, Ginny," she breathed and then she stilled, her voice gone as
			her breath caught and her hips arched once and she screamed out, calling Ginny's
			name again before her legs gave way and she relaxed, spent, arms falling to her
			sides, chest heaving.</p>
		<p>Ginny knelt between her legs, hands resting on Kara's stomach. "I love you,
			Kara," she whispered.</p>
		<p>Kara's eyes opened slowly and she reached out to touch Ginny's face, still
			wet with her. "I hurt you," she said. "I'm so sorry." </p>
		<p>"Yes," Ginny nodded. "You hurt me. You left me and I wanted to die," she
			said. "I just couldn't understand, Kara. I felt so strongly about this and you
			just disappeared, as if it meant nothing to you."</p>
		<p>"I ran. I was . . .."</p>
		<p>"You were scared I would hurt you," Ginny stated. She crawled next to Kara,
			wrapping her arms around her and snuggling close to her. "It wasn't until I saw
			the painting that I finally realized why you had really left. But I couldn't
			find you." Her voice broke and she swallowed back tears. "I tried."</p>
		<p>"I won't leave you again," Kara promised. </p>
		<p>"No. I won't let you. This is what I want, Kara. Not some faceless woman from
			my future. Not a chance to meet someone else, someone other than you." She
			traced Kara's lips with her finger, then cupped her cheek, making Kara look at
			her. "You not only took my heart, Kara. You took my soul. I'm just half a person
			when you're gone."</p>
		<p>Kara let tears slip easily from her eyes as she held Ginny's gaze. Foolish
			women in love. Indeed. She had made a big mistake by leaving. They should have
			talked then, they should have shared all of this then. But she had been too
			scared all those weeks ago. Her pride had told her to run before Ginny decided
			there were others out there, much better than herself.</p>
		<p>"I just wanted you to be sure . . . that I was what you wanted. I didn't want
			to assume . . .." Kara said, trying to explain.</p>
		<p>"I'm sure." Then Ginny smiled and leaned over to touch her lips to Kara's.
			"I'm sure that I want you in my life, like this. I'm sure that I love you. I'm
			sure that I want you to make love to me . . . right now," she finished in a
			whisper as her kiss deepened.</p>
		<p>Kara's lovemaking was slow, unhurried. She touched Ginny with gentle hands
			and soft lips, saying she was sorry, over and over again. Then Ginny was guiding
			her, spreading her legs for her and Kara went to her, her mouth loving her, her
			tongue moving through her wetness, her moan mingling with Ginny's as her tongue
			slipped deep inside her.</p>
		<p>Much too soon, Ginny thought. Too soon. But she couldn't stop the flame as it
			moved through her body, consuming her, igniting the fire that burned beneath
			Kara's mouth. She clutched at the bed, her fists raking through the covers as
			she tried to anchor herself, but she was washed away as wave after wave hit her,
			causing her to cry out, to scream Kara's name, to press Kara even closer to
			her.</p>
		<p>"Oh . . . my . . . God," she whispered. "No one but you," she breathed, so
			softly.</p>
		<p>Kara gathered Ginny in her arms. "No one but you." </p>
