<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Twenty-Four -->

<p>It was Sunday, nearly noon, but Ginny couldn't bring herself to get out of
			bed. For the last two weeks, she had put on a brave front, appearing cheerful in
			front of Nana, eating meals with a vigor she did not feel and participating in
			meaningless conversations when her mind was elsewhere. Elsewhere! She laughed.
			Her mind wasn't elsewhere. It was on Kara. It had been since the moment she had
			walked out of her life. Each day, she went to the store, waiting for the phone
			to ring. Each time the bell jingled, she looked up, hoping to find Kara standing
			in the doorway. Finally, yesterday, she had given up. Kara wasn't coming back.
			Kara didn't want her in her life. Kara didn't need her. </p>
		<p>And so she had stayed in bed. Hiding. She could not put on a brave front any
			longer. She had told Nana she wasn't feeling well, which, of course, was the
			truth and Nana had brought her soup to eat, which still stood on the nightstand
			beside her. She couldn't force down another meal. She was certain that she would
			never eat again. </p>
		<p>She rolled over, wishing for the pain in her heart to go away. Never in her
			life had she felt so alone. The pain of her childhood could not even compare.
			She loved Kara. Of that, at least, she was certain. But why had Kara run? What
			was she afraid of? Was Ginny's need of her too much? Had she felt smothered?
			Ginny's first thought was her inexperience in bed, but she knew that wasn't the
			reason. Their lovemaking had been too passionate, to intense for her to have
			imagined it. Kara had enjoyed it as much as Ginny had. There was another reason
			for her leaving.</p>
		<p>The knock on her door cut short her thoughts and she called for Nana to come
			in. </p>
		<p>"How are you feeling?"</p>
		<p>"Better," Ginny lied.</p>
		<p>"Good. I was worried about you. You're never sick," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny turned away, her eyes looking out the window, seeing nothing. She was
			on the verge of tears and she didn't want Nana to see. She would never be able
			to explain tears. She had never cried in front of Nana.</p>
		<p>"You didn't eat your soup, Ginny," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"I didn't think I could keep it down," she said. "But I'm better now."</p>
		<p>"Let me heat it for you," Nana said with relief. </p>
		<p>"Okay. I'll get up now, I think," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana smiled and left her and Ginny made herself rise, tossing off the
			protective covers. Staying in bed, hiding, would not solve anything.</p>
		<p>Later that week, as Ginny choked down another meal, she knew what she had to
			do. She had to find Kara. She had to know the reason she left. She could deal
			with the truth. But not knowing was slowly driving her crazy. </p>
		<p>"Nana, things will slow down in a few weeks, once the season winds down. If I
			left for a couple of days, would you and Jessica be okay?"</p>
		<p>"Of course, Ginny. Where are you going?"</p>
		<p>"To Seattle," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana's face broke into a smile. "I knew it. Your forced cheerfulness these
			last few weeks couldn't fool me." She beamed at Ginny. "You're going to Phil,
			aren't you?"</p>
		<p>Phil. Always Phil, Ginny thought. "I'm just going to Seattle," Ginny said
			tiredly. "Not necessarily to see Phil."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I know you've been miserable since he left," Nana continued. "Of course
			we can handle the store. You stay gone as long as you need. Oh, Ginny, I'm so
			glad you're going . . .."</p>
		<p>Ginny left her protest unspoken as Nana rambled on and on about Phil. She
			simply stopped listening. She was more concerned about how she was going to find
			Kara in a city the size of Seattle.</p>
