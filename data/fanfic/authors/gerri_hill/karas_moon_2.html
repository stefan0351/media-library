<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Two -->

<p>Ginny looked up as the bell over the door jingled and she smiled warmly at
			her grandmother. </p>
		<p>"Good morning, Nana. How was your walk? "</p>
		<p>"Oh, it's a beautiful day out, Ginny. "Louise walked around the counter and
			tossed her purse on the bottom shelf, nudging Ginny out of the way. "I told you
			I would put these out this morning. " </p>
		<p>Ginny had been pricing the freeze-dried meals that they kept in stock for the
			backpackers that swarmed the mountains in summer. She let Nana take over and
			went to get herself a latte from the espresso machine. She proudly touched the
			side, rubbing off a smudge with her thumb. It was the first thing she added when
			she had purchased the general store last fall. Coffee was one of the few things
			she missed about Seattle. </p>
		<p>"Want one? " she asked. </p>
		<p>"No, thanks. I just had some juice. Oh, Ginny, I met the most interesting
			woman this morning," Nana said. </p>
		<p>"When? " Ginny asked absently as she pushed the button for steamed milk. </p>
		<p>"Out on the trail, by the lake," Nana explained. "An artist. I watched her
			work, although I'm sure she didn't know I was spying on her. "</p>
		<p>"Spying? Why? " </p>
		<p>"Well, I didn?t want to disturb her. She had this large pad and a handful of
			colored chalk things and her hands just flew over the paper. "Louise sighed
			heavily. "I wanted to ask to see it, but once she stood up, I lost my nerve. "
		</p>
		<p>"What do you mean? "Ginny took a sip of her coffee and smiled contentedly.
			Nothing like good coffee. </p>
		<p>"Well, she was . . . imposing. Taller than most women. And her eyes. Oh,
			Ginny, the most odd color of blue I?ve ever seen. Seemed to look right through
			you. "</p>
		<p>"What's her name? " </p>
		<p>Nana looked up and frowned. "Kara Morgan. Ever heard of her? "</p>
		<p>"Kara Morgan? I'm not sure. Wasn't there an article earlier this year about
			her in Northwest Magazine? " </p>
		<p>"I don't remember. You know I never actually read those articles," she said
			and smiled sheepishly. "I just enjoy the pictures. "</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled, too. "You and me both. So, she's here painting? "</p>
		<p>"I suppose. She's renting the Dobson place until October. I was certain the
			Dobson's were only going to be gone a week or so. At least, that's what I heard.
			I wonder if they are having problems? " she mused. Then she looked back at
			Ginny. "But anyway, I told her to come by. She's a little older than you, but I
			told her you didn't have any friends here your own age. "</p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"Well, you don't. You keep saying you have nothing in common with the people
			around here. "</p>
		<p>"I'm sure I would have nothing in common with an artist, either. "</p>
		<p>"You designed ads. That's art," Nana said emphatically. </p>
		<p>"I hardly think what I did for the marketing firm could be called art, Nana."</p>
		<p>"Well, she wasn't overly friendly anyway. She may not even stop by. "</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head and sipped from her coffee. It was true. She had made
			few friends since she had moved here. Most of the locals were older and those
			that were close to her own age were married with small children and she
			certainly didn't have anything in common with them. So far, she had been content
			having Nana as her only friend. </p>
		<p>The bell jingled again and Mr. Arnold came in carrying his poodle under his
			arm. </p>
		<p>"Good morning, ladies," he said, bowing slightly at his waist. </p>
		<p>"Why, Mr. Arnold, how are you today? " Nana greeted him and Ginny was again
			amazed at how Nana had taken to running the store. But then, Nana had lived most
			of her adult life here. These people were her people. It had taken several
			months for them to warm up to Ginny, despite the many summers she had spent here
			as a child. But now, after nearly a year, she felt almost like a local. </p>
		<p>She gave a humorless smile to her reflection in the glass behind the counter.
			So far removed from Seattle, but hardly a local here. Sometimes, she did miss
			her fast-paced job in the city. And sometimes, she missed the people there. </p>
		<p>Like Phil, she thought, but she didn't want to think about him right now. He
			had been calling again, hinting that he was coming for a visit and she had been
			putting it off. He would want to talk marriage and after being away from him the
			last eight months, she was fairly certain that she would not marry him. Only she
			didn't have the heart to tell him. Or Nana. She had hoped her absence would end
			things with Phil, but still, he called. </p>
		<p>"Ginny? "</p>
		<p>"What? " she asked, pushing her thoughts aside for the moment. </p>
		<p>"Would you slice Mr. Arnold some ham? Just a half-pound. "</p>
		<p>"Of course. "</p>
		<p>The day took on its familiar routine. The morning filled with locals and a
			handful of strangers. The afternoon would be spent catering to the tourists and
			vacationers who had slept in and were late getting out to enjoy the warm day.
			Jessica, the high school student who helped during the summer months, came in at
			noon and Ginny escaped for a quick lunch, taking her sandwich out to the park
			like she did everyday. </p>
		<p>With elbows leaning on the table, she tossed a corner of her bread to the
			chipmunks that came to beg. She wondered if they waited for her every day or if
			they just happened to be out and about when she was eating. She sighed. Was she
			lonely? Not really, although she did miss her friends in Seattle. Their phone
			calls, like their letters, were getting less frequent as time went by. But it
			was her own choice to move out here. She had been closer to Nana than to her own
			mother and when her grandfather had passed away, only a few months after her
			mother, she had used her family inheritance and bought the store, feeling her
			grandmother would need someone to look after her. She knew now that Nana was
			just fine, but it was as good an excuse as any to get away from Phil. She should
			have just told him she wasn't ready to get married, but after four years, it was
			time to do something. They couldn't just continue dating and Phil wanted
			children and she dreaded telling him she had no desire to be a mother. She
			secretly feared she would end up like her own mother; loving one child so much,
			her first and scarcely noticing that she had another, waiting for her attention
			as well. </p>
		<p>But she pushed those thoughts aside. She didn?t want to think about her
			sister. And with their mother gone, she seriously doubted she would ever see her
			again. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Kara applied background colors to the canvas, adding gray to soften the dark
			sky. She had decided on the morning scene, with deer and all and she worked
			right through lunch, finally stopping when her stomach demanded attention. </p>
		<p>She took out the tofu she had brought with her from Seattle and sautéed it
			with vegetables and put the pasta on to boil. She opened a bottle of wine and
			went out on the porch while her dinner cooked. The crumbled pack of cigarettes
			beckoned and she lit one, inhaling deeply and letting the smoke out slowly. She
			needed to savor every one. She had vowed she would quit and she was down to five
			a day. At the rate she was going, a few more months and she would quit
			altogether. </p>
		<p>"Right," she murmured. She had been stuck on five for the last month or so.
		</p>
		<p>She stretched her long legs out, the wineglass hanging loosely in her hand
			and she gazed out at the forest. It was quiet here. No close neighbors to
			disturb her work. </p>
		<p>She had come to Chiwaukum one weekend in May with a friend and had seen
			endless opportunities for her work. The surrounding Wenatchee National Forest
			was littered with small lakes and offered a wonderful view of Glacier Peak,
			hovering over them at more than ten thousand feet. On impulse, she had inquired
			about renting a place for the summer. The local real estate agent had called her
			barely two weeks ago about the Dobson cabin and she had snatched it up. She
			usually traveled during the summers, camping or staying at local resorts while
			she sketched, then spent the winter putting her ideas on canvas. But she had
			tired of that and the thought of working in solitude and the quiet of her own
			cabin all summer had been too tempting to pass up. She had not really closed up
			her cottage on Bainbridge Island, though. She was only a few hours from Seattle.
			She could always go back. </p>
		<p>She finished her cigarette and brought her dinner out to the porch. The
			evening was cool, but clear and she ate while she watched the colors of sunset
			settle on the forest, her favorite time of day. </p>
