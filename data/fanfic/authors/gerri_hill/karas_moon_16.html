<!-- Kara's Moon \ Sixteen -->

<p>Ginny laid in bed for a long time, waiting on sleep to come. She draped one
			arm across her eyes, wanting to hide from the humiliation she felt. What Kara
			must think of her. She was a tease, she admitted. Nothing but a damn tease. But
			it wasn't intentional, she thought. It wasn't. She had simply lost control. In
			Kara's presence, she seemed to do that a lot.</p>
		<p>Had Kara's mouth really been at her breast or had she imagined it? Yes, and
			her nipples hardened now at the thought of it. For a moment, she had simply lost
			herself in Kara's touch. For a moment, she had just let go and let her feelings
			have full reign.</p>
		<p>But she had come to her senses, thank God, and Kara had stopped when she
			asked her to. What was it that she wanted from Kara? What did she need from her?
		</p>
		<p>"I want to make love with her," Ginny whispered. "I do. I want all of
			her."</p>
		<p>She turned her head into the pillow, willing these feelings to go away. She
			didn't want to want Kara. She didn't want to have these feelings for a
			woman.</p>
		<p>But she did. She couldn't deny them any longer. It was driving her insane.
			Tomorrow, she would go to her. She would go to Kara and beg her to make love to
			her if she had to. Kara had wanted her tonight, Ginny knew that. She could feel
			that, see that in her eyes. Maybe Kara could give her the release that her body
			craved.</p>
