<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Twenty-Six -->

<p>Ginny took the ferry to Bainbridge Island, wondering frantically where she
			would start looking. The phone book had proved useless. Kara was not listed
			among the 'Morgans' and the operator had firmly told her it was an unlisted
			number. No amount of begging by Ginny had budged him.</p>
		<p>She was looking for a needle in a haystack, she realized as she drove down
			the highway, turning off on each side road that looked like it would take her to
			the water. She hadn't realized how many small towns dotted the island and Kara
			could live in any one of them. It was a fruitless trip, she knew, but she kept
			driving and searching. She had to find her.</p>
		<p>When darkness came, she turned around, heading back to the ferry and Seattle.
			She would have dinner, she thought, and maybe call up one of her old friends.
			They could sit around and talk about her miserable love life! She could just
			image the look on their faces should she confess that she had fallen in love
			with a woman.</p>
		<p>She could always walk to Capitol Hill, the unofficial gay neighborhood of
			Seattle. Maybe stroll down Broadway for an hour or so and have dinner at one of
			the restaurants there. In spite of her mood, that sounded much more appealing
			than room service and another night alone.</p>
		<p>She parked two blocks away, the foot traffic heavy on a Saturday night and
			she blended in with the crowd. She found herself staring at the two women
			walking in front of her, holding hands. They were young, early twenties, she
			thought, but still, they looked so comfortable with each other. She immediately
			thought of Kara and pictured them walking arm and arm like this. She tore her
			eyes away and looked at other faces, strangers in the crowd. She walked into the
			indoor mall, pushing through the milling shoppers. Coffee. Real Seattle coffee.
			She stood in line at the coffee bar, dying for a real latte after months of
			relying on her portable espresso machine.</p>
		<p>She took her coffee and stopped at the newspaper stand, the local gay paper
			catching her eye. She bought one, taking it to a table with her. </p>
		<p>It was all there. Bars, diners, bookstores and any other gay-oriented
			activity she could possibly want. To say she was surprised was an
			understatement. She just had no idea how large the gay community was in Seattle.
			She knew now that she had purposefully ignored that part of city before.</p>
		<p>She flipped through the pages, looking for women's bars. Perhaps Kara was
			right. Maybe she did need to explore her newfound sexuality. Maybe she was
			rushing things with Kara.</p>
		<p>Of course she wasn't, though. She knew how she felt about Kara. But it
			wouldn't hurt to look, she told herself. Kara obviously didn't want her. With
			that, she went back to her hotel to change and to mentally prepare herself for a
			night out on the town.</p>
