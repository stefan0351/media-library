<!-- Coming To An Agreement \ Part 2 -->

<p>At 0800 hours the next morning, the senior staff of Voyager was in the conference room. It was time for the staff meeting.</p>
<p>Neelix had droned on and on about what supplies they had managed to obtain, and mercifully sat down.</p>
<p>The other departments had already given their briefings and the captain asked &#034;If there's nothing else&#034;</p>
<p>It was a rhetorical question. A prelude to dismissing the officers. The doctor and Voyager's helmsman, Tom Paris had almost risen to their feet, when Seven answered.</p>
<p>&#034;Actually, yes. There is something that I should mention.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven?&#034; Janeway asked, curiously.</p>
<p>The Borg was reticent at the best of times. It was unusual indeed for her to offer information that did not have to do strictly with the Astrometrics department.</p>
<p>&#034;Yesterday afternoon, lieutenant Torres was approached by a member of the Zeist species. They offered to make her a captain of her own ship.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt all eyes on her and shot an exasperated look at Seven.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, why didn't you mention this?&#034; Chakotay asked, the tribal tattoo over his left eye wrinkled as he frowned.</p>
<p>&#034;Because it wasn't important. I told them I wasn't interested.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant, it is true that you declined their offer. However, it is still important.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, what do you know about this species and why is it important if B'Elanna has already refused their offer.&#034; Janeway asked.</p>
<p>If Seven was mentioning it, then it was relevant. If one of her crew was in danger, the captain wanted all the information she could get.</p>
<p>&#034;As I told lieutenant Torres, the Zeist were considered unworthy of assimilation by the Collective.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Bet they were disappointed.&#034; Paris muttered, derisively.</p>
<p>&#034;Indeed,&#034; Seven continued. &#034;All of their technology is stolen and they need to periodically gather new species to care for their ships for them. Taral indicated to the lieutenant that their acquired species are compensated. That is not true. They are taken against their will if they do not go voluntarily. The Zeist see their offers as generous and are offended when refused.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked from Janeway to B'Elanna wanting to be extremely careful how she phrased what she wanted to say.</p>
<p>&#034;I believe lieutenant Torres could be in danger on the station.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Oh, Seven, come on.&#034; B'Elanna growled. &#034;It can't be that bad. Are you trying to make sure I don't get any leave?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, please&#034; the captain silenced her. &#034;Seven, is it really that serious?&#034;</p>
<p>Seven spared the auburn haired woman a condescending look.</p>
<p>&#034;Captain, I am Borg. I do not exaggerate.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Captain!&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway ignored the engineer's plea and looked around the table.</p>
<p>&#034;Ideas?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Well,&#034; Chakotay began. &#034;She needs shore leave as much as anyone else. With the stress she's under, maybe even more.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I agree.&#034; The doctor said. &#034;It could be mentally and physiologically detrimental to deny her some down time, captain.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;True,&#034; said Kim, &#034;but we don't want to lose her, either.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I wish you wouldn't talk about me like I'm not here.&#034; B'Elanna grumbled.</p>
<p>Janeway held up her hands for silence. There was a grin curling her lips as she took in B'Elanna's disgruntled expression.</p>
<p>&#034;It's alright, lieutenant.&#034; She assured her. &#034;I have no intention of denying you down time.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna breathed a sigh of relief as her shoulders relaxed.</p>
<p>&#034;However&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her shoulders tense up, again.</p>
<p>&#034;I don't want you on that station alone for any reason. I know that's my standing order already, but I also know you like totake chances? Any time you are on the station, you will be armed.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Okay, captain.&#034; B'Elanna said with a big grin. &#034;I can do that.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, I mean it.&#034;</p>
<p>She could see the captain was serious and forced the smile off her face.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, of course, captain. I promise.&#034;</p>
<p>I promise I'll be careful, she amended to herself.</p>
<p>&#034;Very well, if there's nothing else.&#034; </p>
<p>Everyone looked around the table carefully before leaving the conference room.</p>
<p>Janeway sat thinking for a moment after the room emptied. She was pleased by Seven's protectiveness of the Klingon engineer. Although the two had always shared a less than friendly relationship, Seven was becoming defensive of her adopted 'collective' that made up the crew of Voyager.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>Voyager had been at space station, Goeth for two weeks. Repair crews were putting the finishing touches to the bussard collectors.</p>
<p>B'Elanna finished the final modifications on the sensor array and put her tools back into her kit. She looked at Ensign Kari Jamison, who was assisting her, and grinned.</p>
<p>&#034;Well, that's it. I think we deserve to celebrate a little.&#034;</p>
<p>The two women walked out of the maintenance bay and entered the station's main corridor.</p>
<p>As soon as they walked out, B'Elanna saw them.</p>
<p>A group of the Zeist creatures were waiting for her. She felt her fingers tingle and wanted to reach for her phaser. She didn't because she didn't want to start a fight. Janeway would have her hide. And more importantly, no more shore leave.</p>
<p>A tall, skinny male creature immediately stepped in front of the women. The other five Zeist casually arranged themselves beside their leader.</p>
<p>&#034;I am Danar. Leader of the Zeist consortium aboard this station.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;That and a couple of coins will buy you an ale. What do you want?&#034; </p>
<p>B'Elanna was tired and not in the mood for this. She felt her Klingon blood begin to boil and had to clench her fists to keep from killing this thing where it stood.</p>
<p>&#034;I have come to see if you have re-considered our offer.&#034; He said smoothly.</p>
<p>&#034;Look, no offense, but I'm not interested.&#034; B'Elanna snarled. &#034;Why can't you just take 'no' for an answer?&#034;</p>
<p>The creature pulled his head back as though he had been struck.</p>
<p>&#034;You would so blatantly dare to insult me?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I'm not trying to insult you.&#034; Torres said, trying to find a diplomatic way out of this.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm really not. But you must understand, I already have the best job in the galaxy. I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept.&#034;</p>
<p>Danar moved too fast for Torres to see. His hand slipped into his jacket, reaching for a weapon.</p>
<p>&#034;Don't.&#034; Jamison warned in a deadly voice.</p>
<p>B'Elanna saw that the half Bajoran had already pulled her phaser and had it trained on the Zeist. Damn she was good!</p>
<p>&#034;I will shoot you, if you make me.&#034; She warned.</p>
<p>Danar slowly removed his hand. &#034;You win, for now. But if I were you, I would be very careful in the future. You will not always be so lucky.&#034;</p>
<p>The women backed up to the maintenance bay without speaking. There would be no celebrating today. It was time to head back to the ship.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>B'Elanna managed to talk Jamison into keeping their little adventure to themselves. It wouldn't do for the captain or the commander to hear about it. She promised the ensign that she would take extra precautions when she was on station.</p>
<p>The next day saw the completion of all ship repairs, and the start of most of engineering enjoying some well-earned down time.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had every intention of getting good and blasted. The only problem was finding someone to go on station with her. Tom and Harry had already left. Lerona had her friends, and most of the department was already gone. She didn't want to defy the captain and go on her own.</p>
<p>I know, she thought triumphantly. I'll ask Seven.</p>
<p>&#034;Computer, locate Seven of Nine.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven of Nine is in Cargo Bay 2.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I knew it. She thinks shore leave is irrelevant.&#034; B'Elanna snorted as she headed for the turbo lift to take her to deck 8.</p>
<p>Torres saw the Borg as soon as the cargo bay doors hissed open. She was inputting commands into a console and didn't look up when B'Elanna entered.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna Torres, how may I assist you?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;How do you do that?&#034; Damn she was infuriating. </p>
<p>&#034;Elaborate.&#034; Seven said finally looking at her.</p>
<p>&#034;You always know it's me without even looking. How?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I possess enhanced Borg hearing. I identify you by several things. The sound of your respiration, your hear-beat is more accelerated than a human and your footfalls are heavier. And the scent of your skin.&#034; She said, as though explaining to a child.</p>
<p>&#034;My skin?&#034; she was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, your scent is.... spicier than others.&#034; Seven explained calmly.</p>
<p>&#034;And you can do this with everyone?&#034; Torres asked in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#034;No. Only those with whom I spend most of my time. Yourself, Captain Janeway, Tuvok&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Okay, okay. I get the idea.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Was that what you came to ask me?&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna shot a quick look to see if the blonde was being sarcastic. She looked sincere and B'Elanna was amazed to realize that for all her intellect, she really was quite na&#239;ve.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and spit it out before she could change her mind.</p>
<p>&#034;No. I came to see if you would go to the station with me.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven quirked her cortical implant at the half-Klingon engineer.</p>
<p>&#034;Indeed. Why me? You have made your dislike of me apparent. Could you not find another to accompany you?&#034;</p>
<p>She wasn't going to make this easy, was she, B'Elanna thought.</p>
<p>&#034;No, Seven.&#034; She answered honestly. &#034;Tom and Harry are already gone. And by the way, I like you fine.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant, I understand that you and Lieutenant Paris are engaged in a romantic relationship. If you wished to join him, I am sure he would not mind.&#034;</p>
<p>That did make B'Elanna hesitate for a moment. Seven was right. Shouldn't it be Tom she went to the station with? Then she realized that his already having left was just an excuse. She had been getting tired of his juvenile antics lately and she needed a breather. She didn't want to spend time with him.&nbsp; Then she completely surprised herself with the comment that she was sure came out of her own mouth.</p>
<p>&#034;I don't want to be with him. I want to spend some time with you.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna was amazed at the brilliance of the smile that slowly covered the Borg's face. It made her look younger and sweeter, somehow.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt the breath catch in her throat. Why had she never noticed how lovely the young woman was? The Borg implants didn't distract from her beauty, but seemed to enhance it somehow.</p>
<p>&#034;Very well.&#034; Seven said that in the softest voice B'Elanna had ever heard her use.</p>
<p>Seven quickly logged off her terminal and turned to B'Elanna with an expectant expression.</p>
<p>&#034;Umokayfine.&#034; B'Elanna stammered. &#034;First thing we have to do is get a phaser for you out of the armory. You know the captain's rule about being armed, here.&#034; She added unnecessarily.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pushed the uncomfortable feelings away and walked out of the cargo bay with a Borg trailing closely behind.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>They were sitting in another bar. Seven was thankful the lieutenant had chose a little better location this time. The air wasn't quite as stifling, although the noise level was still extremely high.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is a pre-requisite to such an establishment.</p>
<p>Seven sat quietly contemplating her companion. B'Elanna's continuously watched the patrons of the bar as though she couldn't bring herself to look at the young blond.</p>
<p>Seven didn't mind the lack of conversation. It gave her time to reflect on her feelings. She didn't understand what she had felt in the cargo bay when B'Elanna&nbsp; said she wanted to spend time with Seven.</p>
<p>Their experiences with each other had always been so explosive. Yet, undeniably, she had felt an entirely pleasant tingle course through her veins at B'Elanna's statement. She did not believe she was malfunctioning.</p>
<p>In retrospect, she had to admit she had always looked forward to seeing the engineer. She even looked forward to arguing, and although she would never admit it, had even gone out of her way on occasion to provoke her, just to get a reaction. </p>
<p>It was confusing to the young woman because she realized she reacted the same way to Captain Janeway. The difference being that in the Captain's presence, Seven seemed to function better. In the Klingon's presence, she was easily angered and distracted.</p>
<p>Seven remembered the doctor saying that sometimes-strong emotions such as antagonism were used to mask a deeper feeling. She wondered what those deeper feelings could be.</p>
<p>Seven looked at B'Elanna, as if to memorize her features. The high, proud forehead ridges, her slightly upturned nose. She was surprised to realize her heartbeat and respiration had elevated minutely. She felt a surge of tightness in her lower belly. </p>
<p>This is arousal! Why had she never realized how she felt? Was it because of Lieutenant Paris? Seven knew the two were in a romantic relationship. Maybe she had known subconsciously that there would never be any room for her in B'Elanna's life, and she had settled for what she could provoke from the half-Klingon. Anger.</p>
<p>She compared her to feelings for the engineer to those she had for her Captain. She was disconcerted to realize she had a similar reaction when thinking of the fiery redhead. Could one be attracted to more than one person? Seven dismissed her feelings for the Captain as irrelevant. Although she had little experience with Human relationships, she realized the Captain would be unlikely to get involved with a member of her crew. </p>
<p>Seven heard the sudden indrawn gasp from her companion and looked up to see what had caught her attention.</p>
<p>The unmistakable sight of three Zeist entering the establishment caught her attention.</p>
<p>They chose a table near the front of the bar, facing squarely toward the two women. When the waiter arrived at their table, they waved him brusquely away and stared openly at Voyager's engineer.</p>
<p>She was right, Seven thought, they do look out of place without beverages. And their hostile intent was obvious.</p>
<p>&#034;I suspect it is time to vacate the premises.&#034; Seven stated calmly.</p>
<p>&#034;S'okay.&#034; B'Elanna slurred. &#034;We kin take 'em.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Undoubtedly.&#034;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Was it B'Elanna's imagination, or was the Borg being sarcastic?</p>
<p>Seven grasped B'Elanna's upper arm and hauled her unceremoniously to her feet.</p>
<p>&#034;Hey...&#034; B'Elanna began in an aggravated tone.</p>
<p>&#034;No time, lieutenant. You are inebriated and we are out numbered. I suggest it is time to leave.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Always spoilin' my fun.&#034; she grumbled, but followed as steadily as she could.</p>
<p>Seven was not surprised to see the Zeist following at a not so discrete distance behind them. She quickly reviewed their options. </p>
<p>The Zeist had done nothing for her to justify an emergency transport to Voyager, so she couldn't justify the extra expenditure of ship's energy. However, she was uncomfortable with the condition of her companion. B'Elanna wasn't exactly in fighting form, and the Zeist was unlikely to be receptive to a diplomatic speech.</p>
<p>Chances were they were here to either kidnap the engineer or kill her. It was irrelevant that the engineer had an escort. If Seven were in the way, B'Elanna's fate would be her own.</p>
<p>The young woman finally decided to use an indirect route to the ship. Hopefully, she would be able to elude them in the winding corridors and numerous cargo and loading bays.</p>
<p>She dodged left down a narrow, darkly lit path, pulling B'Elanna with her. She still had hold of the smaller woman's upper arm since she was staggering.</p>
<p>B'Elanna retained enough awareness to know they were in trouble. She was taking long inhalations of air in an effort to clear her head.</p>
<p>&#034;Take out your phaser.&#034; she whispered sharply.</p>
<p>Seven was startled she hadn't thought of that herself and quickly removed her fully human hand from B'Elanna's arm to reach for her phaser. She saw B'Elanna had already drawn her own.</p>
<p>Seven released her other hand; gratified that B'Elanna seemed to have sobered quickly.</p>
<p>&#034;Down here.&#034; </p>
<p>B'Elanna led the way into a large cargo bay filled with packing crates and miscellaneous garbage. The hull shown iridescently and forcefields covered a number of places where stars were clearly visible.</p>
<p>&#034;This was not a good idea.&#034; Seven stated.</p>
<p>The forcefields would effectively block their communicators should they request an emergency beamout.</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't respond as she shuffled down the center aisle in the cargo bay. She was headed for the back where they could take cover. Maybe they could hide from the Zeist. Their communicators might not work, but neither would any locators the Zeist might have.</p>
<p>Seven was just passing to B'Elanna's left when they heard shouts behind them. She dodged to the left behind a large tritanium crate as disrupter blasts fired. The blasts were so close, she felt heat on the back of her bio-suit.</p>
<p>She turned quickly to see if the lieutenant had made it to cover and was dismayed to see her sprawled on the floor. She was lying on her back, and her uniform was smoking around her midsection. She must have turned toward the attackers when they had shouted.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna!&#034; she shouted without thinking.</p>
<p>Seven crouched and ran toward the fallen woman. She scooped her up with her Borg enhanced arm, firing a blast of her phaser toward the aliens. She was gratified to see one of them fall and the others duck for cover as she ran behind another smaller crate with her burden.</p>
<p>She had to crouch with her back pressed against the crate to keep from being a target. Seven wrapped her left arm around B'Elanna and pulled the lieutenant tightly against her chest. She could feel blood from the abdominal wound seeping between the bands of Borg mesh.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's intestines seemed to have acquired a life of their own, trying to slide past the gaping wound. Seven pressed down hard, trying to hold the slippery guts inside. She leaned around the crate and could see the remaining two Zeist walking cautiously down the aisle. </p>
<p>Apparently, they were confident they could dispatch one woman. They didn't take into account that she was Borg.</p>
<p>Seven leaned and fired too rapidly for the aliens to react. She swept her phaser from left to right in continuous fire. Both aliens were stunned and dropped to a heap.</p>
<p>Seven dropped her phaser and lowered B'Elanna carefully to the ground. Belatedly, she realized her breath was coming in huge gulps. She attempted to slow her respiration. It wouldn't do B'Elanna any good if she passed out from hyperventilating.</p>
<p>The blond used her Borg hand to neatly split the seam of B'Elanna's trouser leg and removed the material to use as a makeshift bandage for her stomach.</p>
<p>She eased B'Elanna up from the deck enough to slip the material under her back and tied it tightly around her waist. It was crude but would have to suffice. With that finished Seven grabbed her phaser and carefully hefted the smaller woman into her arms.</p>
<p>Seven strode briskly for the cargo doors while keeping an eye on the Zeist. She was unfamiliar with their physiology and didn't know how long a phaser stun would keep them out.</p>
<p>As she walked toward the door, she could feel the heat of B'Elanna's blood soaking into the front of her bio-suit.</p>
<p>&#034;You will not perish, Lieutenant.&#034; She said, hearing a husky, quivering voice she barely recognized as her own.</p>
<p>&#034;Please...your continued existence has become important for my well-being.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven brushed her lips along the rippled forehead as she exited the doors.</p>
<p>She slid her left hand down B'Elanna's body and cupped it under the woman's thigh until she was completely supporting her with the Borg arm, and quickly tapped her communicator with her right hand.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven of Nine to Voyager. Emergency transport, two to beam directly to sickbay.&#034;</p>
<p>She had never been so relieved as she was at that moment, when the familiar sparkles of the transporter matrix danced in her vision.</p>
