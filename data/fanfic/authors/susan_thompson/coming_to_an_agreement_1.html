<!-- Coming To An Agreement \ Part 1 -->

<p>&#034;Captain, long range sensors are picking up unusually high energy readings from a large metallic object. Approximately four light years away.&#034; Came the voice of Voyager's boyishly handsome communications officer, Ensign Harry Kim.</p>
<p>Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation starship, Voyager, rose slowly to her feet, attempting to curb the flood of excitement coursing through her body. But she couldn't keep the interest from showing in her blue gray eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed like every time they had unusual readings, the crew of Voyager ended up fighting for their lives. One learned to be cautious.</p>
<p>&#034;On screen.&#034; The compact woman ordered quietly.</p>
<p>The forward viewscreen illuminated to show a large, gray mass still a considerable distance away. It appeared tiny in the vastness of space and the hull was strangely fuzzed as though slightly out of sync.</p>
<p>Janeway raked her fingers through her shoulder length auburn locks in an unconscious gesture of frustration as she concentrated on the image.</p>
<p>&#034;Captain, judging by energy signatures and various species bio-readings, it would appear to be a manned space station.&#034; Tuvok's voice was smooth, without inflection of any kind. As a Vulcan, he tended not to get very animate about anything. At least not that he would allow to show.</p>
<p>After months of one confrontation after another with various inhabitants of the Delta Quadrant, Voyager could really use an overhaul. Not to mention some well-earned shore leave for the crew, assuming things checked out.</p>
<p>Tensions among the crew were becoming more tangible than usual. Especially with her Chief Engineer, B'Elanna Torres and a certain Astrometrics officer. B'Elanna's most recent encounter inside a Malon freighter and something called the V'har had her Klingon Temper more easily frayed and Janeway was finding herself refereeing between the two head strong women on a steadily increasing basis. Something had to give.</p>
<p>&#034;Can't you clean it up a little?&#034; Commander Chakotay asked, the tribal tattoo over his left eye wrinkling slightly as he frowned, trying to force his eyes to focus.</p>
<p>&#034;Sorry, commander. Not from this distance... Voyager's systems took quite a beating when that Malon freighter exploded.&#034; Harry apologized.</p>
<p>&#034;Tuvok,&#034; the energetic captain interrupted. &#034;Send a subspace message on all frequencies to the station keeper. Let them know we're interested in obtaining supplies and making repairs. See what they expect in return. I'll be in my ready room until we find out something further. You have the bridge, Chakotay.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, Captain.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Understood.&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway stood and walked across the command center and down the short flight of steps before entering her inner sanctum.</p>
<p>Kathryn sat wearily behind the desk and rubbed the bridge of her nose with her thumb and forefinger. She was tired and on edge. She had been putting in double and triple shifts, along with everyone else, trying to get the ship repaired since the freighter incident. It was so hard to make needed repairs being stranded 55,000 light years from the Alpha Quadrant. Space stations were few and far between.</p>
<p>This could be just what they needed.</p>
<p>The door chime interrupted Kathryn's thoughts.</p>
<p>&#034;Come.&#034;&nbsp; She called curiously.</p>
<p>B'Elanna Torres literally stalked into the room. Her hands were fisted at her sides and Janeway could see her jaws tensing as she ground her teeth together.</p>
<p>Kathryn lifted a hand, forestalling B'Elanna's torrent. &#034;What's she done, now?&#034; she asked with humor coloring her eyes.</p>
<p>&#034;It's not funny, captain!&#034; The Klingon-Human hybrid growled. &#034;I can't get a damn thing done with that Borg cluttering up the engine room. Every time I turn around, she's in the way. She doesn't even ask permission before starting something.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna took a breath trying to calm herself. Janeway listened with a half smile curling her mouth. She knew it was best to let the younger woman vent her wrath.</p>
<p>&#034;Just now, I was trying to recalibrate the aft nacelles. I couldn't understand why I kept coming up with a 0.34 phase variance until I realized Seven was re-configuring the plasma conduits. Every time I made a modification, she nullified it!&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway stifled a sigh. These conflicts were getting out of hand. But, Janeway thought she might be able to try a different approach with the engineer than choosing sides.</p>
<p>&#034;You know B'Elanna, she's just trying to help.&#034; Kathryn began.</p>
<p>&#034;I know, but can't your pet Borg help somewhere else?&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna knew she had gone too far by the look in the captain's eyes, and regretted the words as soon as they were out of her mouth.</p>
<p>&#034;That'll do, lieutenant.&#034; Janeway's eyes were flint gray. &#034;You'll be interested to know we've picked up a space station on long range sensors. With any luck we'll be able to make repairs there, and you'll be able to get Seven out of your hair for a while.&#034;</p>
<p>Although this was welcome news, it was delivered in coldly enunciated words. B'Elanna retained enough common sense to know she wasn't out of hot water yet, and tried not to act entirely too overjoyed.</p>
<p>&#034;Understood, captain. Sorry about that, but she just makes me so crazy sometimes.&#034; B'Elanna offered apologetically.</p>
<p>Slowly Janeway relented, letting the brief surge of anger drain out of her.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, we're all tired. I know it sometimes seems as though Seven is deliberately getting in the way, but she really is trying. And I know she's been pulling extended shifts so others can get some rest. I think she's starting to feel it. I'll talk to her and get her to regenerate.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Thanks, Captain.&#034; B'Elanna offered her a wry glance. &#034;I guess I'll try using some of Tuvok's meditation techniques in the meantime.&#034;</p>
<p>The captain smiled knowing the engineer had recently trained with the Vulcan in an effort to learn to control her temper. Needless to say, the experiment hadn't been a complete success.</p>
<p>Leaving the captain to her thoughts, B'Elanna started back to the engineering department. She still needed to get the aft nacelles aligned.</p>
<p>Kathryn's eyes followed the form of the olive-skinned woman as she left the room. As soon as the ready room door hissed closed, Janeway pressed the gold communicator on her left breast.</p>
<p>&#034;Janeway to Seven of Nine.&#034; She said wearily.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven here, Captain.&#034;</p>
<p>Honestly, the young woman sounded as Vulcan as Tuvok, she thought with a dismayed sigh.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, I'd like to see you in my ready room.&#034;</p>
<p>There was a slight pause before Seven responded in a neutral tone, although Kathryn was sure she detected a faint trace of exasperation.</p>
<p>&#034;Understood.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven knew instinctively that the summons somehow involved Lt. Torres. Obviously the engineer had been complaining to the Captain again.</p>
<p>Seven passed the Klingon on her way out of engineering. Neither woman deemed it necessary to look at the other. On B'Elanna's part, she felt like she had 'just run to mommy' to 'tattle'. But, she couldn't have Seven constantly usurping her authority. And she might be able to get her modifications finished with the blonde ex-Borg out of her hair for a moment.</p>
<p>On Seven's part, it was simply unnecessary to acknowledge the lieutenant. And truth be told, she was a little angry, but refused to give the engineer the satisfaction of knowing that.</p>
<p>Seven exited the turbo lift on deck one and walked over to press the chime requesting entrance to the captain's ready room. At one time she would not have bothered and would just have entered without announcing herself, but for some reason the Captain's approval had become important to her. Since Janeway had severed her from the collective, her opinion had come to mean a great deal to the younger woman. </p>
<p>She entered as soon as she heard Janeway's husky voice inviting her. Seven walked over to stand at polite attention in front of the desk, calmly linking her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>Janeway looked at her studiously for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, its come to my attention that you and lieutenant Torres have been arguing, again.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven inclined her head toward the captain, and raised her right brow.</p>
<p>&#034;Indeed, Captain. I was not aware of such an occurrence. When was this altercation supposed to have occurred?&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway was stunned for a moment. B'Elanna hadn't actually said they had argued. Just that Seven's actions had been counter-productive to her own. Had B'Elanna even mentioned the problem to Seven?</p>
<p>&#034;It was supposed to have been this morning.&#034; She said with a frown. &#034;She said you kept re-configuring plasma conduits while she was re-calibrating the aft nacelles.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Ah.&#034; Seven said with understanding. &#034;That explains why my modifications would not hold. But, I assure you captain, lieutenant Torres did not say anything to me.&#034;</p>
<p>The young woman seemed completely unremorseful about having caused a problem. Kathryn could understand how infuriating that must be to the fiery tempered engineer.</p>
<p>&#034;Well, I admit she should have come to you with the problem before talking to me.&#034; The captain began carefully.</p>
<p>&#034;Perhaps she did not think I would accede to her request.&#034; Seven offered tentatively.</p>
<p>&#034;Would you?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Perhaps not.&#034; She allowed. &#034;Lieutenant Torres is not always logical in her thought processes. If I felt her reasoning was flawed, I might have ignored her. Also&#034; the young woman broke off, looking quickly at the captain as though she had said too much, and Janeway was surprised to see a faint touch of pink color her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#034;Alsowhat?&#034; Now we're getting to the heart of the subject, Janeway realized.</p>
<p>&#034;I find myself easily angered by her. I know of no other member of the crew who affects me in this manner. Although occasionally you do as well.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven was nothing but honest. Being in the Borg Collective for 18 years, completely devoid of emotion tended to do that to a person, Kathryn ruefully acknowledged. She held in the urge to laugh as she realized Seven was completely serious.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, why do you think it's so easy for B'Elanna to make you angry?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Because she is erratic. Rather than limiting our discussion to logic, she becomes emotional and makes disparaging remarks about me.&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway felt a brief surge of anger for her chief engineer. Her feelings for Borg were almost maternal and she knew instinctively that while Seven's outer appearance was arrogance, inside she was extremely sensitive. She realized it wouldn't help matters to fly off the handle and controlled her emotions with an effort. </p>
<p>&#034;I see. So not only do you become angry, but perhaps her comments also hurt your feelings?&#034; She inquired gently.</p>
<p>&#034; 'Hurt my feelings.' &#034; The blond considered the words carefully. &#034;Yes, captain. I believe that is an accurate statement.&#034;</p>
<p>Somehow, Janeway felt this was her own fault. She had intervened between the two enough times that she should have seen this. As Captain, it was her responsibility to ensure the crew got along or worked out their problems to ensure the smooth operation of the ship.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm sorry, Seven. I'll speak to B'Elanna. But, in the meantime, you do have to remember that she is in charge of engineering. When you're helping out down there, you need to let her know before undertaking any tasks. To avoid just this sort of problem.&#034; She explained.</p>
<p>&#034;I will consider your words, Captain.&#034; </p>
<p>Seven turned toward the door, understanding that the conversation was over.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven&#034; Janeway said, stopping her.</p>
<p>Seven turned around and watched as the smaller woman got up and came around the desk.</p>
<p>Janeway placed her hand on Seven's right bicep in a comforting gesture, feeling the outline of the starburst implant that gave the young woman's human arm additional strength through the material of the blue bio-suit. In an unconscious gesture meant to reassure, she rubbed her thumb over the warm metal.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm sorry she hurt you.&#034; She said gently.&nbsp; &#034;Sometimes, B'Elanna's Klingon temper gets the better of her. I know that doesn't make it any better, but try to bear it in mind.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, captain. The doctor has advised me to 'take it with a grain of salt.' I am unsure what sodium chloride has to do in relation to this topic, but I understand that I must make allowances.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Do me a favor, too.&#034; Janeway said softly.</p>
<p>Seven looked at her curiously wondering what the 'favor' could possibly be.</p>
<p>&#034;Go regenerate.&#034; She continued before the Borg could interrupt. &#034;I checked the logs. I know it's been approximately 72 hours since you last regenerated. It's not going to help matters if you collapse from exhaustion.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I will comply.&#034; Seven would have sighed with frustration just then if she had that particular Human affectation.</p>
<p>She left and Janeway had just re-seated herself at the desk with a fresh cup of coffee when the door chime sounded.</p>
<p>&#034;What is this, Grand Central?&#034; Kathryn grumbled before inviting in her next visitor.</p>
<p>Commander Chakotay walked over and handed her a padd.</p>
<p>&#034;Here are the initial read-outs on the space station, Captain. Administrator H'rath extends his welcome and says we are free to barter for supplies and repairs.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Well, that sounds positive.&#034; She said, perusing the padd while her first officer lowered his bulk into the chair beside her desk.</p>
<p>&#034;You won't say that after you finish reading.&#034; He predicted with a grin.</p>
<p>Janeway sipped from her cup while studying the padd.</p>
<p>&#034;Is this accurate?&#034; she asked, sitting the cup on her desk.</p>
<p>Janeway was appalled. The space station's hull showed signs of multiple breeches held in place by forcefields. It was clearly dilapidated and in need of much repair, itself.</p>
<p>&#034;Oh, it's accurate, all right. We'll be lucky if they even have the technology to make repairs, much less be able to utilize it. But, Neelix says he's heard of this place. Space station Goeth, he called it. He says we should still be able to obtain supplies and get in a little R &#038; R for the crew.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;This place looks seedy to me.&#034; Janeway admitted. &#034;Did he say anything else?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;He said the scurge of the quadrant hang out here. If we are going to afford time off, I recommend crewmen carry hand phasers.&#034;</p>
<p>Chakotay watched closely for a startled expression to ghost across the finely chiseled features. He wasn't disappointed.</p>
<p>&#034;Hand phasers, commander? Will the administrator allow that?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Evidently, it's expected.&#034; He said calmly.</p>
<p>Janeway sat back and stared at the top of her desk. Sometimes she felt the weight of the universe rested heavily on her narrow shoulders. She didn't like affording down time in a place like this, but knew the crew needed a break.</p>
<p>&#034;I guess we really don't have a choice.&#034; She said finally. &#034;Every one could use some time off. Tuvok's got his hands full with altercations breaking out all over the ship. The crew is worked to the point of exhaustion. Not to mention the repair time we need, assuming the station can provide for that.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I concur, Captain. I'll take an away team and check things out first. If every thing is alright, I'll set up a rotating schedule for leave.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Sounds good, Chakotay. Keep me informed.&#034;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>B'Elanna was furious. They finally find a station where they can take some leave, and she had to keep working to make repairs. It wasn't fair. Someone would probably get in a fight and shore leave would be cancelled before she ever got a chance.</p>
<p>On top of all her frustration, Seven was still hanging around like a stone around B'Elanna's neck.</p>
<p>With Voyager at station keeping, there was little for the ex-Borg to do in Astrometrics, so she filled her time by helping out with the repairs. B'Elanna had tried to talk Seven into taking some personal time on the station, but the young woman had declared it an 'inefficient use of her time.'</p>
<p>Still, they had been lucky the station could accommodate them. Goeth didn't boast any dilithium, but they could cover just about everything else.</p>
<p>The repair crews had been working on the exterior hull plating inside one of the cavernous maintenance bays all day. When the relief shift finally arrived, B'Elanna informed Seven that she was going to have a drink before returning to her quarters.</p>
<p>&#034;Is that wise?&#034; Seven asked with an arrogant quirk to her cortical implant.</p>
<p>&#034;It's only one drink, Seven.&#034; B'Elanna growled. &#034;I know I'm not on leave, but if I'm off duty, surely I can have one lousy drink before heading back.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna put her hands on her hips, daring Seven to defy her.</p>
<p>&#034;That was not my concern.&#034; Seven pointed out, surprising the half-Klingon. &#034;The captain has stated all personnel must be accompanied on the station.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled her lips back in an expression that could not be confused for a smile, showing slightly pointed teeth.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm a big girl. I have my phaser, and I don't need a bodyguard.&#034;</p>
<p>The Borg hesitated momentarily. She didn't want to anger the volatile engineer and certainly there was little harm that could result in one drink before returning to Voyager. However, she had no wish to encounter the captain's wrath, which would happen if B'Elanna stayed on station alone.</p>
<p>&#034;I will accompany you.&#034; She stated emphatically.</p>
<p>&#034;What? You?&#034; B'Elanna sputtered in disbelief.</p>
<p>&#034;Do you have an objection to my presence, or to me personally, lieutenant?&#034; Seven asked, suddenly surprised at the emotion tightening her chest, and trying not to show anything in her expression.</p>
<p>B'Elanna bit back the automatic response. &#034;I always object to your presence.&#034; when she saw the look of hurt that rested briefly in the blonde's ice blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#034;No, of course not.&#034; She said gruffly. What an ass she could be, sometimes, she thought.</p>
<p>&#034;Let's go find a bar.&#034;</p>
<p>They walked down the main avenue of the station in silence. B'Elanna was looking for just the right place. They had passed two establishments that Seven thought would have been adequate. Apparently there was some special requirement for the Klingon that those places did not meet.</p>
<p>When B'Elanna finally chose a bar and strode briskly for an empty table in the back, Seven was surprised. This was by far the smokiest, dirtiest place they had seen. It was extremely packed and the noise was at such a level, the young woman could barely hear her own thoughts.</p>
<p>Seven placed her chair against the wall and sat facing the crowd. She had seen the captain do this on occasion and recognized the sound tactics behind such an action.</p>
<p>&#034;Oh, relax.&#034; B'Elanna whispered, seeing the look of distaste on the other woman's face.</p>
<p>A waiter walked toward them, seeing the uniform and recognizing a potentially good customer.</p>
<p>&#034;Two house ales.&#034; B'Elanna ordered, tossing the replicated coinage onto the tabletop.</p>
<p>The scruffy waiter scooped up the metal and scurried away.</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant, alcohol impairs my cortical implant, and motor functions.&#034; Seven informed her.</p>
<p>&#034;So don't drink it.&#034; was the easy rejoiner.</p>
<p>&#034;I do not understand.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, this is a bar. If you don't have a drink in front of you, you'll stand out. Just sip it. Or if you don't like it, I'll switch mugs with you when I finish mine.&#034; She offered helpfully.</p>
<p>&#034;I see. So this is a ploy whereby you will be able to have two drinks instead of the one you originally spoke of.&#034; Seven surmised.</p>
<p>&#034;Whatever works.&#034; B'Elanna grinned, continuing to eye the crowd.</p>
<p>The waiter soon deposited their drinks and scurried quietly away. Seven took a small sip of the oatmeal thick beverage, and gasped slightly at the heat that burned down the inside of her thoracic cavity and into her stomach. That was enough of that.</p>
<p>B'Elanna affected not to notice the heat and downed a quarter of her drink in one draught.</p>
<p>She had been watching the crowd until she felt her companion's sudden, intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#034;What?&#034; she asked testily, turning her head to meet the Borg's icy gaze.</p>
<p>&#034;You enjoy that?&#034; Seven was incredulous.</p>
<p>&#034;It's not so bad.&#034;</p>
<p>A sudden movement in front of their table caught the women's attention.</p>
<p>The alien standing in front of them was distinctly rat-like from his beady, black eyes to the gray fur lightly dusting his body. The only differences were the oddly human ears and the absence of a tail.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes?&#034; B'Elanna asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#034;You are the famous engineer of the wonderful, large ship, yes?&#034; The thing rasped at her.</p>
<p>&#034;Depends whose askingand who's been doing the talking.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna was instantly distrustful of the musty thing. Whether it was something instinctual or just because she didn't like the odor coming from it, she wasn't sure.</p>
<p>&#034;No need to be worried.&#034; He (it) hissed, taking a seat without waiting to be invited.</p>
<p>&#034;I am a friend, Taral. The stories of your engineering skills are plentiful from your crew. I am here to make you an offer.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Unlikely, that you are a friend.&#034; Seven intoned.</p>
<p>She noticed B'Elanna's questioning glance.</p>
<p>&#034;Species 1765, the Zeist.&#034; Seven explained, never taking her eyes off the uninvited guest.</p>
<p>&#034;Considered unremarkable, and unworthy of assimilation by the Collective. What technology they have is stolen, and they lack the necessary knowledge to maintain and repair that technology. They 'acquire' members of other species to perform such tasks.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No doubt that is true.&#034; The alien interrupted. &#034;But whomever we 'acquire' is rewarded handsomely.&#034;</p>
<p>He turned his attention back to the engineer. &#034;You for example could have command of your own ship, with a crew freely at your disposal. All we ask in return is that you pass your knowledge on to others of our consortium.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;In other words,&#034; B'Elanna said sarcastically, &#034;I get to be the captain of a rag-tag ship, with 'unworthy' technology, and a ratty crew.&#034; She was for once grateful for the Borg's assimilated knowledge.</p>
<p>&#034;In so many words.&#034; Taral conceded, with a whine in his voice.</p>
<p>&#034;No thanks, I already have a job.&#034; She said dismissively.</p>
<p>&#034;Don't decide now. I'll let you think it over.&#034; </p>
<p>The alien rose suddenly, departing before B'Elanna had a chance to respond.</p>
<p>&#034;It is unlikely that they will give up easily.&#034; Seven said to a suddenly nervous half-Klingon.</p>
<p>B'Elanna wasn't in the mood to stay in the bar. It was time to head back to Voyager.</p>
