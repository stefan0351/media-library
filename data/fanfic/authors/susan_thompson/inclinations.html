<p>Sometime she just didn't know what to do. In the Collective there was never any doubt. There was never any hesitation. There was harmony of purpose and each member worked toward that goal with unwavering devotion.</p>

<p>These individuals were different, alien. They pursued a common goal but only in a limited capacity. Once free of their daily burden of duty, they seemed to scamper madly about the ship. They pursued irrelevant goals such as the forming of personal relationships. She had assumed the sole driving influence of forming these relationships was copulation as a prelude to procreation. Had she been incorrect? Was there another purpose? Perhaps it was to find one being over all other to form a permanent bond to. To never be alone again.</p>

<p>Being wrong was anathema to the young woman and it took her a long time to recognize her error. Now looking back, she realized she too had been working toward forming a personal relationship.</p>

<p>It had not been a conscious decision on her part, but there was no other explanation. How many times had she gone out of her way to antagonize the young brunette in engineering? How many times had she deliberately ignored her just to get a response? Everyone believed their behavior was formed from disdain or outright hatred. So had she.</p>

<p>Now she knew differently. She had become aware that the diminutive woman was quite important to her. The Klingon was necessary for her continued well being.&nbsp; She secretly thrilled to the energetic presence, feeling an actual shiver of something at the sound of that voice. She desired to touch the smooth, olive skin, to explore the contours of skin, muscle and bone.</p>

<p>Seven was beginning to think that perhaps B'Elanna might not object to her presence quite as much as she believed either. </p>

<p>She possessed an eidetic memory and although she had been taken over by many of the personalities stored in her cortical array that did not mean she didn't regain memories of the experience later. She distinctly remembered the Son of K'Vok's attempt to initiate a mating bond with Lt. Torres. She distinctly remembered the smell of B'Elanna's arousal. Would she have been aroused by Seven's actions if she disliked her as intensely as she led the blond to believe?</p>

<p>The problem was Seven didn't know what to do about the situation. </p>

<p>How could she get the engineer's feelings to go from tolerance to desire? She would have to research the matter. Perhaps the doctor, as her mentor, would be able to advise her.</p>

<p>Seven had been preparing to regenerate for the evening but discarded that impulse. She left the cargo bay and headed for sickbay. This was the optimum time to pursue this idea. The gamma shift had just gone on duty and most of the ship was quiet. Few crewmembers roamed the corridor and would be unlikely to be in sickbay at this time of the night. Since the doctor was a hologram and didn't require sleep she wasn't concerned with disturbing him.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#034;The current time is 0600 hours. Regeneration cycle complete.&#034; Seven of Nine stepped away from the alcove seconds after the female voice of the computer sounded. </p>

<p>A slow soft smile graced her lips as she recalled the doctor's advice from the previous evening. </p>

<p>Initially he had been surprised when she stated she was interested in dating, again. She had previously informed him that there were no mates for her on board Voyager.&nbsp; He was considerably more surprised to learn of her intended prey, having never considered Seven could be interested in another woman. He was, after all, a product of his programming. Nevertheless, he had overcome his limitations and provided her with some valuable information.</p>

<p>Romance was the key. Even though the engineer was half Klingon, the doctor held the belief that the tactic would be quite effective. </p>

<p>Lieutenant Paris had ceased to become a problem. After the last 'Fair Haven' fiasco where the crew of Voyager were suspected of being spirit people, B'Elanna had decided he was too immature and without honor. She had summarily ended the relationship and with her temper, the helmsman knew better than to try and approach her.</p>

<p>Seven considered her options while walking to Astrometrics. She would start small. The lieutenant was extremely intelligent and would catch on if Seven weren't careful. She didn't want to frighten the young woman away. Seven suspected the senior staff meeting at 1100 hours would be perfect to start laying the ground work of her assault on B'Elanna's heart.</p>

<p>The ex drone spent the morning inputting the next six star systems in to the Astrometrics computer. While working, she plotted the progression of her attack on the unwitting Klingon. Being a Borg drone for 18 years had bestowed the gift of patience on the young woman. She was willing to take as long as it took. Her objective was clear, and her own heart would settle for nothing less than her perfect mate.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seven timed it perfectly. She arrived at the door to conference room one seconds ahead of lieutenant Torres. Seven assumed an accommodating demeanor and stepped aside, indicating that the lieutenant should proceed her into the room.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven.&#034; B'Elanna greeted with a small frown.&nbsp; She couldn't understand why the arrogant Borg would suddenly develop manners.</p>

<p>&#034;After you lieutenant.&#034; Seven stated in an uncharacteristically demure voice.</p>

<p>&#034;Uh, thanks.&#034; She looks positively shy, B'Elanna thought.</p>

<p>As the Klingon walked into the conference room, Seven deliberately moved as close behind the smaller woman as she could without actually touching her.</p>

<p>B'Elanna could feel the heat from Seven's body against her back. The fresh clean scent of the young woman assaulted her senses. She unconsciously took a deep breath, inhaling the aroma deeply into her lungs and felt a tingle in her lower belly. She took her seat quickly to get away from the Borg and shot her a considering look. She was so used to the arrogance and icy demeanor the woman constantly displayed that she just wasn't prepared for the sudden shift.</p>

<p>B'Elanna was horrified when Seven sat next to her at the large conference table. The animosity between the two was legendary. Usually Seven sat at the end of the table so she could occasionally glare at the lieutenant when their opinions differed on something.</p>

<p>Captain Janeway entered the conference room and quickly held up a hand, preventing the junior officers from standing. </p>

<p>&#034;Let's get right to business.&#034; She said taking her seat at the head of the large table. &#034;We're coming up on the Kintari expanse. B'Elanna, I need you and Seven to work on enhancing the shield grid. This nebula is puts off strong tachyon emissions and I want Voyager's shields ready to handle the problem.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;That won't be necessary, Captain.&#034; B'Elanna interjected quickly. &#034;My engineering crew can handle it and besides, that'll free Seven up to monitor the nebula from astrometrics.&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway took a deep breath, the compact woman preparing to work up a full head of steam.</p>

<p>&#034;I understand your reluctance, lieutenant.&#034; Seven spoke before the captain had the chance.</p>

<p>Seven raised her Borg enhanced hand, ostensibly to rest it on the conference table. She 'accidentally' brushed the Klingon's knuckles during the move and felt B'Elanna stiffen. &#034;I know I have not always been receptive to your authority in the engineering department. I assure you, I will follow your directives.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Well, there you go.&#034; Kathryn said with a grin. &#034;Problem solved.&#034;</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice that Seven held the Klingon in her gaze a few seconds longer than necessary. No one except the Klingon.</p>

<p>The rest of the meeting proceeded in much the same fashion. Each time B'Elanna expected a fight from the Borg, she got acquiesce. Every time she expected arrogance, she got consideration. By the time they were dismissed, she was completely off balance.</p>

<p>At least the damn drone didn't follow me out of the room, she thought as Seven stayed in her seat. </p>

<p>&#034;Seven? Is there something else?&#034; The energetic captain asked.</p>

<p>&#034;Yes,&#034; Seven said returning her gaze. &#034;But I am unsure if now is an appropriate time to address this particular matter.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I see. Is it a personal matter?&#034; Normally the blond would not interrupt her duty shift for a 'philosophical discussion, so Kathryn was understandably curious.</p>

<p>&#034;Yes.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Can you tell me what it relates to?&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I wish to engage in a personal relationship with a member of the crew. I have sought the doctor's advice, but he has given me poor information in the past. I wished to ask your advice as my friend.&#034; She said honestly. </p>

<p>&#034;Well,&#034; Kathryn said, &#034;this really isn't the time or place for this, but I think I can spare you a few minutes&#034; she said with a smile.</p>

<p>She was extremely happy for the young woman. Their relationship since Seven had been severed from the collective hadn't always been smooth, but they had persevered and developed a strong friendship. Kathryn was proud Seven had progressed to the stage of developing romantic feelings for another individual. Yet at the same time she didn't want to see the young woman hurt.</p>

<p>She suggested they adjourn to the ready room to continue the discussion. While Seven sat in the chair on the upper level, Kathryn obtained a cup of her favorite beverage from the replicator. Seven had already declined the offer of liquid refreshment.</p>

<p>&#034;I guess the first thing to know,&#034; she said sitting on the sofa next to the ex Borg, &#034;is do you think this person has feelings for you.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I am unsure.&#034; Seven admitted. &#034;To date Lt. Torres and I&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Lt. Torres?&#034; the captain interrupted in surprise. &#034;I'm sorry, Seven. Please continue.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Lt. Torres and I have had an adversarial relationship. However, I believe this is not entirely indicative of hostility. From your reaction I gather you do not agree. Explain.&#034;</p>

<p>Janeway placed a reassuring hand on Seven's forearm </p>

<p>&#034;I'm sure you're right. Deeper emotions can often be concealed with an outward appearance of disdain or dislike. When I first met Justin Tighe, we had much the same type of relationship. And we ended up engaged to be married.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Precisely.&#034; Seven appeared almost smug with this apparent confirmation.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven,&#034; Kathryn said placing her mug on the glass coffee table, &#034;tell me what you feel for B'Elanna.&#034;</p>

<p>Seven considered the statement carefully for a long moment. Finally she turned and held the captain's gaze intently.</p>

<p>&#034;I feel many things when I am around her. She has the ability to hurt me with just a word. She can also make me happy with just a look. The touch of her skin causes my own to burn. I am proud of her intelligence although I have had no direct influence over it. When she accomplishes something, I feel as though I have also. I anticipate seeing her and often find myself inventing reasons to do so. When I think of her I feel a tingling sensation in my stomach. I do not understand these impulses or responses, but find them quite pleasurable.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Do you think B'Elanna has similar feelings for you?&#034; Kathryn couldn't help but ask.</p>

<p>&#034;I do not know.&#034; Seven said softly. &#034;I do not think I could bear it if she did not.&#034;</p>

<p>To Kathryn's great surprise tears suddenly filled the ice blue eyes and Seven turned her face away. Kathryn scooted forward quickly. She grasped Seven's chin between her thumb and forefinger and brought her gaze gently back around.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven, you are a very special person. I think B'Elanna would be very lucky to have you.&#034;</p>

<p>In the end, Kathryn promised to sound the lieutenant out. She would try to ascertain if the engineer had similar emotions. Kathryn extricated the promise from Seven to return the favor someday. After all, if their friendship had progressed to the level where she was giving the young woman advice on her lovelife, surely it was only right that Seven do the same.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seven walked through the doors of engineering and saw B'Elanna standing at the main console. Crewmembers scurried busily around the room completing various tasks. B'Elanna spotted the Borg walking toward her and addressed her testily.</p>

<p>&#034;About time. I was beginning to think you weren't coming.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;My apologies, Lt. I was speaking with the captain. How may I be of assistance?&#034;</p>

<p>Again, the young woman caught her off guard. She had expected a sarcastic come-back to her remark. Not an apology.</p>

<p>&#034;Uh, that's okay.&#034; B'Elanna wasn't about to be out-done by a Borg. She could be reasonable, too after all.</p>

<p>&#034;I need your help re-calibrating the EPS conduits in jeffries tube 34K.&nbsp; As they are right now, they won't withstand the additional strain from the modified sensor array.&#034;</p>

<p>Seven careful studied the padd the engineer handed her. She could feel B'Elanna studying her features almost as intently.</p>

<p>&#034;This is delicate work.&#034; Seven said looking up. </p>

<p>Their eyes connected and neither could look away. B'Elanna felt an electrical charge shoot through her body at the intensity of the gaze. Kahless, she thought, her eyes are gorgeous.</p>

<p>&#034;Uh, huh?&#034; she asked stupidly.</p>

<p>&#034;I said, this is delicate work.&#034; Seven repeated with a slight smile quirking her lips. &#034;I will need assistance.&#034;</p>

<p>B'Elanna was having difficulty pulling her mind back to the task at hand. If she didn't know better, she would think Seven was flirting with her! All of the discrete glances and casual touches in the conference room, and now this. Still, she decided to be cautious. She could be misreading this whole situation.</p>

<p>&#034;How about if I assign Lt. Carey to work with you. He's pretty good you know.&#034; She said not looking away from eyes the color of a summer sky.</p>

<p>Seven spotted the beginning signs of arousal in the Klingon and pressed her advantage. She stepped closer, until she was only a step away from the agitated Klingon.</p>

<p>&#034;No.&#034; she said softly. &#034;He is good, but you are the best. The captain would want her best people working on the problem.&#034; </p>

<p>B'Elanna could feel the sweet breath whisper over her face and before she knew what she was doing said, &#034;Wouldn't want to disappoint the Captain.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Indeed.&#034; Seven agreed.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned and walked toward the jefferies tube. She was halfway across engineering before she realized B'Elanna wasn't there. She turned to see a stunned Klingon staring intently behind her.</p>

<p>&#034;Lt.?&#034; she asked with a quirk of her cortical implant.</p>

<p>&#034;How did I get myself into this?&#034; B'Elanna grumbled as she picked up a toolkit and followed the curvaceous blond.</p>

<p>Seven relented and decided to not keep distracting the Lt. at the moment. They still had work to do and the task would not proceed efficiently if the engineer couldn't concentrate. They worked well together even though they were jammed together in the tiny space of the jeffries tube. B'Elanna couldn't help but think about the events of the day regarding Seven's unusual behavior. But she did try to keep her mind on her work and Seven seemed to be acting normal for the moment. Perhaps she's contracted some alien virus, B'Elanna thought and decided to speak to the Doctor about it later. </p>

<p>Toward the end of their work, there was a definite discrepancy. No matter what they did, the EPS conduits continued to show a .0003 phase variance. Under normal conditions that was well within tolerance, but these were not normal conditions. That small of a phase variance inside a class 8 nebula could cause an overload to the deflectors and sensor array resulting in a massive anti-matter explosion.</p>

<p>&#034;Aarrgghhh!&#034; B'Elanna growled slumping back against the bulkhead. &#034;I just don't understand this!&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Perhaps you require 'a break'.&#034; Seven suggested.</p>

<p>&#034;What?&#034;</p>

<p>Lt., you have been working steadily since 1100 hours. It is now 1930 hours. Perhaps you are tired and require a break.&#034; She said reasonably.</p>

<p>&#034;Maybe you're right.&#034; B'Elanna admitted. &#034;I am kind of hungry.&#034;</p>

<p>Seven saw her opening and took it without hesitation. Since they were finished for the evening, there was no reason not to step up her campaign on the smaller woman.</p>

<p>&#034;We could run more scans while partaking of our nutritional supplements. Perhaps we could discover the cause of the variance.&#034;</p>

<p>B'Elanna knew she was gaping at the other woman and forced herself to close her mouth.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven, are you asking me to go to dinner with you?&#034; she asked quietly, suddenly feeling the cramped space.</p>

<p>&#034;And if I am,&#034; Seven asked leaning closer, &#034;would you agree?&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;What are you doing?&#034; B'Elanna croaked as Seven leaned toward her.</p>

<p>&#034;Clarify?&#034;</p>

<p>Instead of the drone's normally cool inflection, the word was uttered softly, breathlessly. Her lips were scant inches from B'Elanna and she could see the tip of Seven's pink tongue inside her mouth.</p>

<p>B'Elanna's mouth was suddenly as dry as the Craters of Tarfat.</p>

<p>&#034;I mean, why are you acting like this? We never got along before now. Why the sudden change?&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I require a more intimate relationshipwith you.&#034; Seven whispered as she lowered her lips to B'Elanna's waiting mouth.</p>

<p>At the last second B'Elanna pulled away, bonking her head sharply against the bulkhead.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven, stop. You're ill. You've got a virus or something.&#034; B'Elanna panted. </p>

<p>She would never admit to how turned on she was at the moment. </p>

<p>&#034;I am not ill.&#034; Seven stated emphatically. &#034;I want to be with you.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Well, what if I don't want to be with you?&#034; B'Elanna grated, suddenly aggravated beyond reasonable thought.</p>

<p>She was mortified to see the beautiful blue eyes brim with tears.</p>

<p>&#034;You do notwant me?&#034; Seven asked in a small voice.</p>

<p>&#034;I'm sorry.&#034; B'Elanna said feeling an overwhelming need to comfort the younger woman.</p>

<p>Gently she placed her palm against Seven's pale cheek. The skin was warm and supple and B'Elanna felt another shock course through her. </p>

<p>&#034;It's just that I've never been involved with another woman. I've never even considered it.&#034; She said honestly. &#034;And you know I just broke up with Tom. I'm not eager to rush into something else.&#034;</p>

<p>Seven took a moment to work through what the Klingon was saying. B'Elanna didn't say she wasn't attracted, just that she hadn't considered anything between them. Seven clearly remembered the scent of the engineer's arousal earlier and knew B'Elanna was attracted to her, even if B'Elanna didn't know it yet.</p>

<p>&#034;You are attracted to me.&#034; Seven said leaning forward again.</p>

<p>She stopped a scant breath away from B'Elanna's soft lips. &#034;But you are not ready for this yet.&#034; She continued. &#034;I will wait until you are ready.&#034;</p>

<p>Seven softly brushed her lips across the Klingon's. Then she was gone. B'Elanna leaned heavily against the hull plating trying to catch her breath as she watched the sensual sway of the Borg's hips as she crawled out of the jeffries tube.</p>
<hr>
<p>Kathryn Janeway sat in her command chair on the bridge and watched as the stars hurtled by at warp speed. Her thoughts were on a certain brunette engineer and were decidedly unprofessional. Kathryn had of course heard about the woman's expertise in B'Elanna's department, but she had never had occasion to actually have a conversation with the young woman.</p>

<p>A few days before she had seen the ensign in the mess hall. The half Bajoran had thick, shoulder length brown hair. Her eyes were so dark they looked almost black. She wore the standard Bajoran earring in her right ear, but there was something unusual about her. Her attitude </p>

<p>The woman seemed energetic, and full of good humor. To Kathryn's experience most Bajoran's were almost sullen. When she had managed to catch the woman's eye she felt pinned in place. Almost like a moth caught in the dancing light of a flame.</p>

<p>It was no wonder she didn't have time to react when the intrepid class ship was abruptly tossed like a toy in a giant's playground.</p>

<p>Janeway was unable to retain her grip on the edges of her command chair and dimly felt the pain of fingernails being torn from the nailbeds as she went flying across the command center. Her head struck the deck plating with a dull thud and blackness swam at the edges of her vision.</p>

<p>Control panels exploded throwing showers of sparks that blended eerily with the crimson wash of the illumination.</p>
<hr>
<p>B'Elanna watched the easy-going young engineer from the corner of her eye, fighting the smile attempting to curl the corners of her mouth. As a half-Klingon it wouldn't do to show her amusement, but her demeanor had improved considerably in the last few days.</p>

<p>Seven of Nine had begun leaving small gifts in brightly wrapped paper in the corridor outside her quarters. B'Elanna knew they were from Seven even though she never left a note.</p>

<p>Since the evening in the jefferies tube, Seven had been careful not to push the Klingon too hard toward a romantic entanglement. She left the gifts and never inquired as to whether or not B'Elanna liked them. She was considerate and attentive when they worked together, but found discrete ways to touch B'Elanna frequently. And the way she looked at B'Elanna Sometimes the Klingon thought she would spontaneously combust.</p>

<p>B'Elanna found herself looking forward to seeing the young woman. She had always known Seven was gorgeous and admitted perhaps some of the antagonism on her part was do to jealousy. Now that the beautiful woman had directed her charms toward the Klingon, B'Elanna found herself proud of Seven's Nordic beauty. And to be honest, B'Elanna found the sensual blond extremely compelling. </p>

<p>She had told Seven she didn't know if she could be involved with another woman. Now she knew she could, and was wondering how much longer she could stand it before she called Seven to her quarters and ravished her. </p>
<p>B'Elanna's attention was drawn to Ensign Robbie Jamison standing at her console bobbing her head to the music playing in her mind. Her fingers passed with easy competence over the console while the focus of her attention was on the song she had learned from Tom Paris' 20th century rock and roll program.&nbsp; Suddenly it was too much to contain and the willowy half Bajoran burst out signingloudly.</p>

<p>&#034;I feel goodnuh&nbsp; nuh nu nu nuh! I knew that I would, now!&#034;</p>

<p>The subtle vibration of the deck plating interrupted the chuckle that had started in B'Elanna's chest. The shaking increased then all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>The deck abruptly tilted at a sharp angle and she was forced to hold on to her terminal with all her Klingon strength. B'Elanna could hear the groans of the outer hull straining and would have said a brief prayer to Kahless if she hadn't been otherwise occupied. She had a fleeting impression of Jamison flying over her own station.</p>

<p>Voyager's automatic fire suppression systems activated as several fires erupted from damaged plasma conduits and relay circuits. The flames were quickly doused; creating a fog that thickened the air even further.</p>

<p>The shaking ceased as suddenly as it began. The hiss of escaping gases and popping of shorted electrical conduits blended with the cries and moans of the wounded. B'Elanna struggled to stop her knees from shaking as the adrenaline of exhilaration flooded her system. Her blood seemed to freeze at the intonations from the ship's computer.</p>

<p>&#034;Warning. Radiation levels at 1500 isorems and rising. Warp core breech imminent.&#034;</p>

<p>All eyes turned to the chief engineer as if too frightened to react. B'Elanna absently thought they looked like frightened tiika cats.</p>

<p>&#034;Get out of her!&#034; she roared, galvanizing the stunned crew into moving.</p>

<p>She knew the blast doors would be automatically activated as soon as the radiation reached dangerous levels, sealing the rest of the ship from exposure. Unfortunately, it would also seal in anyone unlucky enough to be in engineering once the doors were down. Once sealed, it would be impossible to open those doors until the radiation had been vented.</p>

<p>B'Elanna spared a brief prayer that Seven was uninjured. She pushed thoughts of the young blond away, knowing she couldn't afford to get distracted right now. Crewmembers scrambled out of engineering. The wounded were scooped up and scooted out.</p>

<p>B'Elanna began inputting commands to shut down the warp reactor. If she didn't get the core shut down Voyager was going to make one hell of a bang! The radiation could be vented later. She knew she would die from the exposure, but it was worth the sacrifice to save 141 lives. It would be worth it to save Seven.</p>

<p>In that instant B'Elanna knew she had made a terrible mistake. She had been holding Seven at arms length. She had wanted the courtship and tender flirtations Seven had been showering her with and had resisted allowing the natural progression of the relationship for fear the tenderness would stop. Seven wasn't Tom Paris. Her wooing was sincere; not something that would cease when she got what she wanted.</p>

<p>She realized something else, too. She loved Seven and knew the young woman loved her, although she had never said the words. Perhaps Seven would howl to Stovokor for her and let them know a warrior was on her way.</p>

<p>Then she realized she wasn't alone. Jamison was using a hyper spanner to restrict the ionized flow of plasma particles into the injectors.</p>

<p>&#034;Robbie, get out of here!&#034; she growled, feeling a strange mix of irritation and admiration for the young woman.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the ensign spared her a lopsided grin and said, &#034;After you, lieutenant.&#034;</p>

<p>I don't have time for this, the fiery Klingon hybrid thought. If she wants to die, fine.</p>

<p>&#034;Secure all engineering systems.&#034; B'Elanna ordered tensely.</p>

<p>Jamison dropped the spanner and rushed to one of the few still operating consoles, fingers flying over the display. &#034;Warp core pressure at 2100 kilopascels.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Lock down the magnetic constrictors. We've got to get the reaction rate down before we can seal it.&#034; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Movement from the far side of the room caught Robbie's eye. She spared a quick glance to see the blast doors beginning their descent from the upper level.</p>

<p>&#034;Warning.&#034; The computer chimed at the same time, &#034;radiation levels at critical. Warp core breech in one minute fifty two seconds.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;B'Elanna, we have to get out of herenow! We can finish shutting down the core from the auxiliary station.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;One more minute.&#034; She muttered only marginally realizing the ensign had called her by her first name.</p>

<p>A relay junction behind the Klingon chose that moment to explode. Jamison watched in stunned fascination as the smaller woman sailed over the console toward the ruptured plasma coolant tank. She knew organic tissue would liquefy on contact with the coolant but was unable to look away.</p>

<p>Fortunately, B'Elanna also saw where her unplanned flight path was taking her and managed to twist to avoid the coolant, but diverted herself headfirst into the protective bulkhead ringing the core assembly.</p>

<p>Robbie leapt to the unconscious engineer, struggling to get the dense frame over her shoulders and away from leaking fluids knowing they were both suffering severe plasma burns. She staggered toward the rapidly closing blast doors, attempting to avoid the coolant flow. Robbie gritted her teeth against the pain burning her legs. She had to hurry; the doors were almost down!</p>

<p>The dark-haired woman was almost to the exit when her legs gave way, too damaged to support the combined weight. Robbie used the momentum from the fall to push/throw B'Elanna toward the opening. She sobbed in frustration as she realized they weren't going to make it.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a pair of strong hands were grasping the Klingon and pulling her through the doorway. Robbie pulled herself desperately toward the exit on her elbows. Lieutenant Carey grabbed her hands and yanked her from the room just as the doors sealed with a heavy thud.</p>
<hr>
<p>Janeway struggled to retain awareness. As soon as the shaking ceased, she pushed herself shakily to her feet and dropped into her command chair.</p>

<p>&#034;Report.&#034; She snapped, pushing the thick auburn hair out of her eyes while surveying the chaos surrounding her.</p>

<p>Harry Kim stood unsteadily over his operations board, a steady trickle of blood dripping from the corner of his left brow. To his credit, he didn't seem to notice the injury as he assessed the ship's damage.</p>

<p>&#034;All primary systems off-line. Shields down to 27%. Internal communications and inertial dampers off-line.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Can someone please tell me why the two most critical systems on this ship go off-line every time we hit a bump?&#034;</p>

<p>Kathryn didn't really expect an answer while around her the bridge crew continued to pull themselves together. Trying to focus through the pounding in her temples, she realized her first officer was still lying on the deck and didn't show signs of moving anytime soon.</p>

<p>&#034;Tuvok, find out if we have any casualties and send damage control teams to all critical stations.&#034; She ordered as she knelt over Chakotay. &#034;And find out what the hell happened!&#034;</p>

<p>All the blood, she thought. For one brief moment she was afraid it was too late for him. Then she felt the steady flutter of pulse in his neck through her fingertips. &#034;Computer, site to site transport. Beam Commander Chakotay to sickbay.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Unable to comply. Internal transporters off-line.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Damn.&#034; Kathryn huffed as she signaled a couple of crewmen to carry the injured man to the medical bay.</p>

<p>&#034;Captain, we have a warp core breech in progress.&#034; Tuvok stated in the same tone that he would have used to tell her the time of day. &#034;Radiation levels are at critical in engineering.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Double damn!&#034; she grated, blue gray eyes flashing. &#034;Harry, get down there and help seal that breech.&#034;</p>

<p>She hated sending the injured young man, but the ship came first. Feeling powerless to help, she sat in her chair and allowed her crew to do their work. Kathryn forced herself to remain in her chair and maintain a calm appearance. All she could think about was the warp core breech, the radiation gases flooding engineering, and two very special people that were undoubtedly doing everything they could to seal the breech. She glanced back when she heard the turbolift doors open and close.</p>

<p>Seven of Nine strolled almost calmly to the aft engineering station. Her eyes met Janeway's gaze across the command center and she raised her ocular implant inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#034;Captain, are you damaged?&#034; she inquired politely.</p>

<p>Her friend's stoic demeanor absurdly reassured Kathryn, but she could see the haunted look in that icy gaze. She knew the Borg was worried about B'Elanna and no doubt wanted to be with her, but she wasn't. She was maintaining her post in a time of crisis. Like any good Starfleet officer.</p>

<p>Kathryn felt a momentary twinge of guilt, but pushed it roughly away. She was worried too, about a brunette Bajoran. She may be the captain, but that didn't mean she didn't have personal feelings.</p>

<p>Realizing she still hadn't answered Seven she said, &#034;No, I'm fine. What's our status?&#034;</p>

<p>The former Borg drone understood the reason for the shift in conversation and allowed it to go unchallenged. She knew the Captain didn't like to admit being susceptible to injury.</p>

<p>&#034;Warp containment has been sealed, although energy reserves are down to 32%. Internal back up systems are coming on-line. Sickbay reports numerous injuries but no fatalities.&#034;</p>

<p>Janeway allowed a small sigh of relief as she tugged the bottom of her uniform tunic and turned back to the front. The movement reminded her of the torn fingernails and numerous small contusions she had sustained.</p>

<p>&#034;Tuvok, I'll be in my ready room. You have the bridge. Keep me informed on repairs.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Acknowledged.&#034;</p>

<p>Kathryn entered her ready room and retrieved the dermal regenerator she kept in her lower desk drawer. She had found through experience that it was prudent for the captain of a Starship to retain one for personal use.</p>

<p>Two hours later the senior staff, minus Chakotay and B'Elanna who were still in sickbay along with Ensign Jamison, were in an emergency meeting in conference room one assessing the situation.</p>

<p>Tuvok had determined that they had been hit by a massive graviton wake. The wake had originated through a subspace rift. Due to a small phase variance in the deflector array, the graviton wake had cut through the shields and disrupted all primary systems and severely depleting energy reserves. Long range sensors had since been restored.</p>

<p>Harry reported communications, inertial dampers and shields had been restored, but warp power was still unavailable. It was estimated it would take several days to repair the extensive damage. They would have to restock their supply of dilithium ore at the next available M class planet. Impulse engines were operating, but at impulse power it would only take about three hundred years to reach the Alpha Quadrant.</p>

<p>Janeway ordered Seven to begin scanning the adjoining star systems for a suitable planet that might yield a supply of dilithium while Harry was to assist Lt. Carey with getting the rest of the ship's systems operational.</p>

<p>&#034;All in all, we're in pretty good shape.&#034; Janeway said. &#034;Repairs are proceeding quickly but I want to find a solution to our phase variance problem so we don't have to face this again. I know I can count on all of you. Dismissed.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Seven.&#034; She said quietly and waited while everyone else left the room.</p>

<p>&#034;Before you start scanning star charts, you need to go to sickbay. I know you're worried about B'Elanna. It's been a long day. Our reserves will last for a while, so I think you can wait until the morning before beginning your scans.&#034;</p>

<p>For a brief moment Seven looked as though she might argue. Then she simply said, &#034;Thank you, Kathryn.&#034; and left quickly.</p>

<p>Kathryn couldn't help the lop-sided grin from crossing her face as Seven exited the conference room. Seven had never used her first name and knew for her to have done so meant she was extremely moved by the gesture on the captain's part.</p>

<p>Janeway walked across the command center to the inner sanctum of her ready room, leaving Tuvok in command of the bridge. Seated at her desk with a fresh cup of Colombian Blue, Kathryn pulled up the Doctor's report of the injuries suffered during the encounter with the anomaly.</p>

<p>There had been a multitude of injuries, thankfully none of them had resulted in fatalities. Only three crewmembers remained in sickbay. Chakotay was still under observation for a few more hours because of the concussion he had sustained when his head impacted the railing between the command center and the aft engineering station, but it was the other two patients that drew most of her concern.</p>

<p>B'Elanna had fractured her skull. Janeway winced in silent sympathy realizing the kind of force that would be required to crack the young half-Klingon's reinforced cranium. She had also suffered two cracked ribs, third degree plasma burns, and mild radiation poisoning.</p>

<p>Jamison had third degree plasma burns to the lower legs and severe burns to her lungs.</p>

<p>Harry had informed Kathryn of the scene in engineering when he arrived and described how Jamison had endangered herself to rescue the Klingon.</p>

<p>She was glad to see the ensign was recovering and would soon be released from sickbay. Kathryn took a moment to add a commendation for bravery to Jamison's record before she sat back in her chair.</p>

<p>She remembered a discussion with Chakotay shortly after receiving a &#034;Dear John&#034; letter from Mark Johnson. She had told Chakotay that receiving the letter made her realize she was using Mark as a safety net to avoid becoming involved with someone else.</p>

<p>Thinking back on that discourse she realized she had substituted other 'safety nets' to avoid the same thing. The biggest one being her command. It was an excuse. Starfleet was a long way away. Sixty years to be exact. Why was she denying herself a chance to find happiness?</p>

<p>Making a command decision, Kathryn stood and yanked down on the bottom of her uniform jacket. There was no guarantee that Robbie Jamison amorous feelings, but she would never know if she didn't try.</p>

<p>Leaving her ready room, Kathryn headed for sickbay.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seven walked through the doors of sickbay and strode briskly for the Klingon's bedside.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt the strong presence and opened her eyes, smiling shyly at her beloved. </p>

<p>&#034;Hi.&#034; She said softly.</p>

<p>Seven stepped next to the smaller woman and gently picked up her hand. &#034;How are you feeling?&#034;</p>

<p>Seven looked pale and haggard. B'Elanna realized exactly how worried the young woman had been and tried to reassure her.</p>

<p>&#034;I'm okay. The Doc's patched me up good as new. I'm just waiting for him to say I can leave.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;You can leave.&#034; He interrupted rudely.</p>

<p>Seven addressed him sternly. &#034;Are you certain?&#034;</p>

<p>He sniffed as though insulted and said, &#034;I don't make mistakes about such things. Of course I'm certain.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I warn you, if she collapses I will disrupt your holo-matrix.&#034; She threatened calmly.</p>

<p>The doctor knew she was one of the few people on Voyager that could carry out that threat. If it were possible for a hologram to become pale, he could be considered ghostly.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven,&#034; B'Elanna interrupted, &#034;I really am fine. Would you like to walk me to my quarters?&#034; she asked in a husky voice full of innuendo.</p>

<p>Seven didn't have to respond as she gently helped the engineer to her feet. The blond wrapped an arm tenderly around the Klingon's shoulders to support her.</p>

<p>Both women looked up in when the doors hissed open to admit Captain Janeway.</p>

<p>&#034;B'Elanna, how are you feeling?&#034; she asked with genuine concern.</p>

<p>&#034;Much better, captain. The doctor's released me back to my quarters.&#034; </p>

<p>&#034;Good, Harry and Lt. Carey are making repairs. Make sure you rest. I don't expect to see you back to work for a couple of days.&#034; </p>

<p>Janeway walked away heading for Robbie's bio-bed. Seven and B'Elanna were both surprised when she gently took the Bajoran's hand into her own. They were no more surprised than the ensign was, but she did look terribly pleased and grinned up at her superior officer.</p>

<p>Seven never released her hold from around the slender shoulders</p>

<p>&#034;You don't have to do that, you know.&#034; B'Elanna said with the hint of a smile. &#034;I can walk.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I want to.&#034; Seven said gently. &#034;Would you deny me this pleasure?&#034;</p>

<p>B'Elanna stopped and looked deeply into the blond's eyes. She raised a hand brushing the backs of her knuckles along the soft cheek.</p>

<p>&#034;I will never deny you anything again.&#034;</p>

<p>Seven shivered at the implication of the softly spoken promise and assisted the passionate woman to her quarters.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at the chief engineer's quarters, B'Elanna pulled Seven onto the sofa next to her. She held the long fingered fully human hand in her own and turned to her.</p>

<p>&#034;Seven, there's something I need to tell you.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;Yes?&#034; She asked with trepidation.</p>

<p>&#034;No, it's okay.&#034; B'Elanna assured her. &#034;I just wanted to tell you that I've been thinking. I was wrong to restrict what's been happening between us. I've been keeping you at arms length because I enjoyed the attention I was getting from you.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;That is illogical.&#034; Seven pointed out.</p>

<p>&#034;That's what I realized.&#034; B'Elanna said with a chuckle. </p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on a point between her feet as she continued. The next words were the hardest she had ever spoken and she knew they were the most important ones she would ever speak. &#034;After the warp core started to breech and the radiation was pouring into engineering, I realized I might never have the chance to tell you how special you've become to me. I don't want to keep you at a distance and I need to tell youI love you.&#034;</p>
<hr>
<p>When she couldn't bear the silence any longer she dared to look up. Seven was gazing at her in wonder.</p>

<p>&#034;You love me?&#034; she asked almost desperately.</p>

<p>&#034;Yes. Do you think you could love me, too?&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I do. I have loved you for a very long time.&#034; Seven whispered.</p>

<p>&#034;Do you think you could show me?&#034; B'Elanna invited.</p>

<p>Seven's response was to gently scoop the smaller woman into her arms and carry her into the bedroom.</p>
<hr>
<p>&#034;What took you so long?&#034; Robbie asked softly.</p>

<p>&#034;I had work to do.&#034; Janeway returned slightly nonplused that the ensign had actually expected her earlier. She hadn't even known she was going to be here.</p>

<p>&#034;How did you know?&#034; Janeway asked. &#034;I've never had the inclination to-spend time with another woman before.&#034;</p>

<p>&#034;I knew the first time I saw you.&#034; Robbie said. &#034;I was just waiting until you were readyKathryn.&#034;</p>
