<!-- Summer \ Part Two -->

<p>Sunday morning came around too soon. Ellie groaned as she stretched in the bed, and rose stiffly to strip off the sheets and fold them on top of her dirty clothes.</p>
		<p>'Right. A quick shower and coffee and I'm off.'</p>
		<p>She moved about the apartment, inspecting it one last time for forgotten things. She left the keys in a envelope on the kitchen table, with a note to the landlord with instructions where to send the security deposit. All lights were off, the stove scrubbed, dishes washed. The place was clean enough.</p>
		<p>At 8:45 she closed the door behind her and sat finally on the outside stoop to wait for David and his friend. Ellie had never met the other man before last night. In retrospect, he looked a bit on the scruffy side. She doubted he was a student. He appeared to be a few years older than David as well. Maybe still trying to be a carefree summer worker like the others in town, but with a harder edge than she fancied. He looked last night, standing next to David, as if he had smoked too many cigarettes, spent too many nights drunk in bars. She could somehow envision David to be like him in a few years, harder and disillusioned.</p>
		<p>It was 9:30 when the two men approached her. Did she imagine that they were staggering a bit? Not drunk this time of day, surely? Unless they had partied all night?</p>
		<p>"Oh, there you are finally," she called, trying to keep the disapproval and censure out of her voice.</p>
		<p>"Don't want to keep a woman like you waiting, eh Fred?"</p>
		<p>"Ha!" the other man laughed with a sneer. "Oh no. We all have things to do! Let's leave this dump. Better things are waiting up the road, right lassie?"</p>
		<p>"Right. We've a long trip ahead. You'll catch the bus in Lehighton? Both of you traveling on together then?"</p>
		<p>"We're off to Hell together, eh Fred?" David answered without looking in her direction.</p>
		<p>Ellie settled herself in the driver's seat and watched the men throw small satchels in the back by her suitcases and books. David sat next to her with Fred behind in the small back seat.</p>
		<p>She spoke up to him as she glanced in her rearview mirror.</p>
		<p>"It is a bit crowded back there. Good thing you don't have far to go." She looked at the stranger with apology in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Don't you worry, love. This is exactly what we need, eh David?"</p>
		<p>"Damn right." David answered back, an oddly determined and cold look about him.</p>
		<p>The town disappeared behind them as David fingered the radio and managed not to pick up any stations clearly.</p>
		<p>"Afraid the radio doesn't work very well out here. Hard to pick up stations this far out."</p>
		<p>"Well, I for one am sick of this isolated hole. I want more excitement than I can find around here. Don't you agree, Fred?"</p>
		<p>"To bigger and better places, money and willing women!" Fred called out, pretending a toast. Ellie could just visualize the men drinking and toasting all night.</p>
		<p>"You two look like you had quite a night of it. Did you sleep at all?" She took in their rumpled clothes and unshaven faces.</p>
		<p>"No. We drank until we ran out of coin, and laid out on the beach."</p>
		<p>"Your apartment vacated already?"</p>
		<p>"I just had a room. Not the grand accommodations you girls had."</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't call it grand. But with four of us, it wasn't bad. Money's tight for us all, as I am sure you do realize."</p>
		<p>"And now you've got a nice piece of change for next year, I guess."</p>
		<p>Ellie looked at David as he stared ahead, hearing anger and resentment in his voice.</p>
		<p>"I've worked hard all summer, David, to get tuition for next year. It's been a long haul, but worth it. How about you?"</p>
		<p>"What? No, money and I part too easily. I can always use more. Easy come, easy go. I haven't saved much at all."</p>
		<p>"Will you come back next year?"</p>
		<p>"Hell no. I'm going to burn my bridges behind me. Too many uptight bitches around here, " he mumbled more to himself than for Ellie to hear.</p>
		<p>She heard the comment nonetheless, and was growing more uncomfortable by the minute. Apparently David still had hard feelings and resentment toward her. She wondered as she drove how one could tell someone else that there was no interest in him without offending the fellow? She hadn't had enough experience in these things. Perhaps his wounded pride was part her doing, although not intentional. It seemed not a good idea after all to have agreed to share the ride with him.</p>
		<p>'Well, just twenty miles or so.'</p>
		<p>They had traveled up the coast. With the tourists and students all returned home, the stretch of road was more desolate than ever. Ellie wanted to leave the place with a happy memory, not the strained atmosphere that filled the car. She had a longing to see Vanessa again, to sit on the rocky cliffs with her, enjoying the summer sun and sea breezes.</p>
		<p>'I wonder which is her house. And how she spends the winter? I wonder if the homes here are protected from the cold winter winds and snows? '</p>
		<p>She imagined a crackling fireplace inside at night and woolen blankets on partially shielded porches, wine and cheese and soft music offsetting the howling of the wind muted by shutters.</p>
		<p>"I would like to get one more look at the ocean, David. Would you mind if I stopped here and just said goodbye to the place? One last time? Silly I know, but a last bit of the wind and spray and all, before a long winter inland. I love the coast so."</p>
		<p>David looked around at the spot, desolate and barren. He turned cold eyes on her and smiled a satisfied smile.</p>
		<p>"I don't think I could have picked a more perfect spot, eh Fred? Last impressions are so important, don't you think?"</p>
		<p>"Well, yes. I do love this part of the coast. If you don't mind. You won't miss your bus or anything? Are you on a strict timetable?"</p>
		<p>"Do stop. No hurry. The pleasure will be a mutual one."</p>
		<p>"You seem in an odd mood today, if you don't mind my saying so."</p>
		<p>"Odd? Not any more flattering a thing to say than your other judgments all summer, Ellie. You don't like me much."</p>
		<p>"David, please. Let's not have harsh words. Let's not leave the summer with unpleasant memories of each other."</p>
		<p>"Why should the end be different than the whole wasted time? I did not enjoy the summer. Just one disappointment and frustration after another."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry to hear it David."</p>
		<p>"When did you start to care what I feel? " he turned angrily to her. "You have been so tied up in your own self-centered world."</p>
		<p>"David..."</p>
		<p>"I'm sick of talking, Ellie. Sick of struggling to be a polite good little boy. It's not my nature to be so passive, to wait to be given things, and not just take what I want."</p>
		<p>"I am sorry you aren't more happy. But I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for in the days and weeks ahead. I don't want to argue or fight with you, David." Ellie had pulled the car over to the side of the road, and sighed audibly. "Look, I'm going to take a five minute stretch and look at the ocean. I won't be long. Then let's start fresh, alright? And try to be pleasant to each other."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>David just glared at her without speaking as she unbelted herself and exited the car. She closed the door and stood wearily by the roadside a moment, before straightening her shoulders and heading off toward the rocky shoreline. She could hear the men in a heated discussion as she moved away.</p>
		<p>'What a perfectly terrible way to end the summer. The air is so thick with anger and resentment in there. I am surprised I can even breath. Well, twenty miles more and I can put it all behind me.'</p>
		<p>Part of her just wanted to leave the two men there. She really didn't need or want this aggravation. She stood quietly by the sea, trying to let the peace of the spot relax her, inhaling the salty air, and for the last time of the summer just feel the calm that the ocean always gave her. It would be another long hard year at school with a full course load and a forty hour work week as well.</p>
		<p>She could hear car doors open and close behind her. 'Maybe they'll walk. Ha! I wish.' She was nonetheless startled to hear David walk up behind her.</p>
		<p>"Are you saying farewell to the ocean as well, David? She turned to offer him a sad smile. "It is such a beautiful spot."</p>
		<p>He snarled a response close to her ear. "Just for the record, my name is not David."</p>
		<p>"What?" Ellie turned around to look at him, shocked by the odd statement and the tone of his voice. Her gaze toward him however was distracted by activity at her car. She saw Fred opening her luggage and tossing her clothes on the road.</p>
		<p>"What in the world is he doing?" she gasped out loud at the sight.</p>
		<p>"Stop that!" she called over David's shoulder, and began to run toward her car. "Stop that! Have you lost your mind?"</p>
		<p>David grabbed her arm to spin her back to look at him.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry. He is only looking for your summer earnings."</p>
		<p>"You have to stop him," she almost pleaded with him. Once again she called out to Fred. "You can't have that money. It is my tuition for next year."</p>
		<p>"You still don't get it." David squeezed her arm harshly.</p>
		<p>"Let me go, David. You're hurting me. I have to stop him. All my things..." She tried to pull herself away but he held her now with both hands on her arms.</p>
		<p>"I wanted to give you something by which to remember the summer. And to remember me especially."</p>
		<p>"Let me go!"</p>
		<p>"You see, a simple robbery just doesn't stand out quite like a beating and a robbery. If I had the time, I'd rape you as well. But frankly, Ellie, you're not worth the effort. You held out all summer. You've been too busy earning your money. Too good for me. Well, college girl, keep your precious favors. I'll just take your car and your tuition money. And give you some nice bruises to look at, instead of my kisses."</p>
		<p>"David, you don't understand." Tears were filling her eyes. She still did not comprehend the danger she was in, only aware that all her hard work, all her plans for next year were falling apart. "Don't do this, please."</p>
		<p>"Shut up! I found your wallet in the dash. The rest of the money must be in your cases. We'll find it."</p>
		<p>Just then Fred yelled out with a satisfied shout. "Got it! Almost three grand!"</p>
		<p>Ellie took her eyes off the angry man holding her to look at Fred as he stood waving her cash in the air.</p>
		<p>"No!"</p>
		<p>It was then that David punched her viciously in the stomach. She bent over in reflex, clutching herself, gasping for breath. She felt pain and the need to vomit. He laughed at her before smashing her face with his fist, impacting her jaw and cheek. She screamed before falling to the ground, before she felt a hard kick to her ribs and kidneys, before unconsciousness took away the shock and pain. She remembered how oddly soft the coarse sea grass felt, and how dark it was suddenly. And how quiet the world became.</p>
		<p>Vanessa had completed the three mile walk up the coast as she did every morning. She had dimly been aware of a car passing by on the road above the beach. She was surprised as she climbed up toward her house to see a car parked by the pavement.</p>
		<p>While she loved the ten acres of windswept cliff and gnarled trees that filled the high land near the state park and the rambling home she had purchased, she had her share of trespassers. At least now, with fall approaching, she would have her peace again.</p>
		<p>'Another person to chase off.'</p>
		<p>She smiled involuntarily at the thought of the last trespasser she had tried to scare away, wondering how Ellie was doing on her homeward journey. Two things suddenly and simultaneously jarred the pleasant thoughts from her mind. She noticed a man haphazardly throwing clothes out of suitcases onto the road, undergarments scattering in the wind. Outside the car was a dumped case of books, and more clothes. She noticed a painting thrown against a rock.</p>
		<p>'What in the world is going on? A robbery?'</p>
		<p>At the same instant, a woman's scream set her in motion, running toward the beach.</p>
		<p>'A painting? Oh my God, Ellie!'</p>
		<p>She raced ahead past the car, hearing a harsh whistle as a warning to someone from the man near the car. She wasn't sure where the scream had come from. It seemed to fill the air before being lost in the steady gusts of sea breeze. 'The beach!' She paused a moment on the hillside to scan the area, only to see a man kicking a downed figure. She saw a vicious grin on his face as he turned to run past her and jump into the waiting car.</p>
		<p>Vanessa was torn between wanting to stop him and her desire to help the woman. She ran ahead, bending toward the blond. She still saw the car purposefully back up and flatten suitcases and clothes and the painting, before speeding off down the road, leaving scattered clothes flipping and rolling in the wind.</p>
		<p>She forced her eyes to take in the woman before her. She knew it was Ellie.</p>
		<p>"Dear God. Please be alright." Her hands were trembling as she gently rolled the girl onto her back, taking in the filthy clothes, the injured face, bruised with a bleeding lip. The left eye already looked like it would swell shut. Ellie was unconscious but breathing, with a steady pulse. Vanessa felt her limbs carefully for breaks and found none. She was torn with indecision whether to leave the girl and call for help, or risk carrying her back to the house herself.</p>
		<p>'I can't leave her. They might come back. I can do this. Poor dear Ellie. It breaks my heart and fuels my rage. I want to scream and cry at the same time. The bastards!'</p>
		<p>She scooped the girl up, surprised how light she was in her arms. She cradled her against her chest and carefully walked back toward her house, avoiding any jarring steps. By the time she had traversed the three hundred yards to her porch, she felt the girl's weight, but was only too happy to get her to safety.</p>
		<p>She kicked open the screen door and placed her gently down on the sofa. Making sure Ellie was still breathing regularly, she ran for the phone. Vanessa knew Dr. Jacobs, the local generalist, from her work with the property owner's association. She dialed his number from memory, speaking quickly and efficiently, describing the problem. She would call the police as well, but not until the girl was awake and alert.</p>
		<p>She next moved to the kitchen to retrieve a pot and then the hallway bath for a hand towel and warm soapy water. She began the careful task of washing the girl's arms and hands of dirt and blood. Her left arm was scraped with an angry looking abrasion. The girl's face had born the brunt of the man's punches. Vanessa carefully cleaned it as best she could. The dirty clothes would be fine for now. Hopefully no ribs were broken. She gingerly touched Ellie's left side, making the girl moan, trying to pull away, even in her unconscious state.</p>
		<p>'The bastard! Who could hurt this angel, or hate her so?'</p>
		<p>Memories flooded her mind ...of another beautiful woman, beaten and raped, unhappy memories of her lover, the woman who seven years ago dared to love her, and received only hatred from small minds. Charlene had chosen to run from the antagonism and violence, leaving Vanessa more alone and only guilty that just because of her, Charlene had suffered such indignity and pain. It was the last time Vanessa had tried to have any relationship. And now, this beautiful girl, again beaten.</p>
		<p>'Certainly not because of me? Am I so cursed? Is it so dangerous to even know me?'</p>
		<p>She shuddered at the thoughts filling her mind. But now was not the time to relive that horror. She forced herself to concentrate on Ellie. She fetched crushed ice and placed it carefully on the blond's swollen lip and cheek. She sat and waited for Dr. Jacobs.</p>
		<p>'And then soon the police. Perhaps I'll call them now as well, after all. I could give my version, perhaps apprehend the criminals before they flee too far.'</p>
		<p>And so decided, she phoned the local constable. He would radio to the towns ahead, Lehighton and Avalon, the description of a light green Ford with two men aboard. She described the one who had attacked Ellie carefully. He seemed to have been the same man who accosted them at dinner. Obviously someone Ellie had known well, to have provided a ride out of town. The officer would be by in a few hours unless she called that Ellie's condition prevented an interview.</p>
		<p>After what seemed like hours, Dr. Jacobs arrived. Actually only thirty minutes had passed. She had used the time to observe the girl, but more importantly, to draw the images of the two men she had seen. Done with that, Vanessa was concerned that the girl had not yet awakened.</p>
		<p>Dr. Jacobs rushed through the door, medical bag in his hand, shrugging out of his top coat, the macintosh he wore rain or shine. He was a kind older man, gray hair and balding, in a sweater and bow tie.</p>
		<p>"Where is she, my dear?"</p>
		<p>"This way. On the sofa."</p>
		<p>"Has she awakened?"</p>
		<p>"Afraid not."</p>
		<p>"Poor thing." He stood and looked at the girl stretched out on the couch. "Who did this to her? And why?"</p>
		<p>"A robbery and a vicious beating. They ran off as I approached."</p>
		<p>"Do you know the girl?"</p>
		<p>"Actually I did meet her on the cliffs and in town. Summer waitress, a college student, just heading home today."</p>
		<p>" Is there family to notify?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know. She was working to earn her tuition. I don't know if there is family, or only a short supply of money. She's a very sweet girl. Such a shame to see her so mistreated."</p>
		<p>"Right. Well, let me have a look."</p>
		<p>He knelt down by the sofa and inspected her, much as Vanessa had done. "No obvious fracture of arms or legs."</p>
		<p>"Her ribs, doctor."</p>
		<p>"Let me have a look." He unbuttoned her blouse, pulling it free of her jeans, opening it to reveal a white lace bra and extensive bruising along her left ribcage. "Well, the ribs move with the others on inspiration. Nothing badly fractured. Let me have a listen." He found his stethoscope in his bag, and worked a moment over her. "Air moves well. Doubt any significant bleeding in the lungs. Nothing punctured." He listened absently to her heart, and then palpated her abdomen. "Soft, good bowel sounds. Now let me have a look at her head and face."</p>
		<p>"I saw the man kicking her ribs and side. I don't know how her face or head were injured. She was on the ground as I approached, with him standing over her. Just a nasty bastard!" she added with emotion.</p>
		<p>"Indeed, dear. She was fully dressed?"</p>
		<p>Vanessa nodded. "As was he."</p>
		<p>"So thankfully no rape?"</p>
		<p>"I haven't touched her clothes. I don't think so. I washed her arm and her face. And iced it."</p>
		<p>"Yes. You have done well." As he spoke, he carefully inspected her skull for lumps or depressions, looked behind her ears, over her mastoid for bruising, looked in her ears for bleeding, felt along her neck for misalignment. He lifted each eyelid to check for pupil reactivity. The left lid was swollen, and as he moved the tender tissue, Ellie cringed slightly. With his opthalmoscope, he looked in the easily visible right eye. He set his instruments away after checking the girl's reflexes.</p>
		<p>"Get her shoes off, will you?"</p>
		<p>"Certainly." Vanessa knelt as well, unlacing Nike running shoes and removing thin cotton socks.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me then." He efficiently scratched the soles of her feet and watched her toes move. "And will you help me roll her? Over on her right side? Just hold her like that."</p>
		<p>The girl was supported against Vanessa's chest as she knelt by the sofa. Dr. Jacobs pulled up the open blouse to inspect the spine and ribs again from behind, and listen once more to her lungs.</p>
		<p>"Look at those bruises. Just sickening how some one would be so cruel."</p>
		<p>Vanessa looked over the girl's back, seeing the expanse of tan skin that she had imagined, but now grotesquely painted angry purple in clearly demarcated kick marks. Dr. Jacobs rolled her over onto her back gently, and closed her blouse, leaving it unbuttoned.</p>
		<p>"Do you have an afghan?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, of course." At her words, Vanessa quickly moved to the hall closet, retrieving a woven woolen throw, carefully covering the girl.</p>
		<p>"Leave the ice on for another twenty minutes or so. I don't think she needs hospital, Vanessa. Unless you'd rather not have her here."</p>
		<p>"No. Leave her. I'll be more than happy to look after her. She has no one here in town. Her friends have all returned to school. I had a sandwich with her last night at the bookstore, by chance."</p>
		<p>"Well, she's in good hands then. I'll come by in the morning to check on her again. She should be waking up soon, Vanessa. She will hurt. She will be dazed. Expect nausea and dizziness. She's had a bad concussion. If she doesn't wake in another hour or two, call me back. If she drifts out again after waking, not sleeping mind you, but out like this, call me. Try to keep her up most of today, if you can. She should not have double vision or numbness or a heavy limb. Call me if she's not right. I think it's just a damn awful beating."</p>
		<p>"Thank you for coming so promptly. All her things are scattered on the road. Would it be safe if I ran out? If I were quick about it?"</p>
		<p>"Are the police coming?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. I called them."</p>
		<p>"Well, let them see things as they are."</p>
		<p>"Right. Good idea."</p>
		<p>"I'll call later to check up on her. Otherwise I'll see you in the morning."</p>
		<p>"Thank you again. And I'll cover any bills involved."</p>
		<p>"Fine, then. What is the girl's name?"</p>
		<p>"Ellie. Ellie Smith. Studying writing and literature."</p>
		<p>"Right. Poor thing. Give her some broth and tea and crackers later."</p>
		<p>"Certainly."</p>
		<p>"And aspirin is fine if she can keep it down. "</p>
		<p>"Good. You've been very helpful."</p>
		<p>"Shall I send my nurse over later?"</p>
		<p>"No. I'll be fine with her. I'll call if I get nervous."</p>
		<p>Then Dr. Jacobs was out the door, shrugging on his rain coat.</p>
		<p>"A cup of tea sounds good to me about now. I need to get my nerves settled." She spoke her thoughts out loud.</p>
		<p>"What? What did you say?"</p>
		<p>Vanessa turned to see a dazed blond student, her face a mask of puzzlement. Ellie tried to sit up, but groaned, sinking back down to the sofa. Vanessa moved to kneel beside her again. After a moment of hesitation, she took Ellie's hand in her own, rubbing it softly.</p>
		<p>"Ellie? It's Vanessa."</p>
		<p>"Vanessa? How did you get here?" she murmured, looking at the older woman.</p>
		<p>"Don't get up. Just rest, Ellie. You're alright."</p>
		<p>"I can't wake up. Must be a dream." She struggled to sit up again, flinching in pain.</p>
		<p>"Easy there, sweetling." Vanessa spoke in a quiet soothing voice.</p>
		<p>"I meant to tell you, Vanessa." The girl spoke slowly, her voice serious. "I love the sound of your voice."</p>
		<p>Vanessa smiled at the student, who tried so hard to focus on her face.</p>
		<p>"And, I'm....I'm so cold." The girl shivered.</p>
		<p>"Let me take that ice off you. And fetch you another blanket."</p>
		<p>"A dream." Ellie murmured before closing her eyes.</p>
		<p>Vanessa moved a strand of hair off the girl's face, pausing a moment to just look at her, so delicate and vulnerable as she was then, and seemed so small on the couch. "My poor dear."</p>
		<p>She stood and climbed the stairs, returning with a favorite quilt, down filled and satin covered. She covered the girl again, and went off to make tea and toast for herself. She returned in a few moments, and sat across from the girl, absently munching toast and sipping her tea, deep in thought. Ellie seemed to be waking finally. Vanessa saw her eyes flutter open, sometimes focus on her, then look around the room slowly. She had already found quick movements made her dizzy.</p>
		<p>"Am I in your house, Vanessa?"</p>
		<p>"Umm." The brunette nodded. She set her cup down and walked over , sitting carefully on the couch next to the girl. "How are you feeling?"</p>
		<p>"I don't think you want to know."</p>
		<p>"Have a headache?"</p>
		<p>"Ask me what doesn't hurt. It would be easier. I thought I was dreaming. Waking with you here."</p>
		<p>"I know."</p>
		<p>"I was knocked out."</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Near your home?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. I heard you scream out. I was out prowling around for good light."</p>
		<p>Ellie tried to smile, but it hurt to much. "Did you rescue me again?"</p>
		<p>"Seems like it."</p>
		<p>"How did I get in here?"</p>
		<p>"What, my living room?"</p>
		<p>Ellie nodded, looking about her again.</p>
		<p>"Well, I couldn't just leave you on the cliff side. What would the neighbors think?"</p>
		<p>"Are they gone?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"And my car?"</p>
		<p>Vanessa nodded. " 'Fraid so."</p>
		<p>"And my things?"</p>
		<p>"Well, there are suitcases and things scattered on the road. I thought the police should see it all. So did Dr. Jacobs. He's been and gone already, and will be back again in the morning. You'll be fine, he says."</p>
		<p>"Not fine, Vanessa. I don't know what I'm going to do." She spoke in a flat voice, now fully awake.</p>
		<p>"This is not the time to worry about anything. You're safe and basically in one piece. That's all that matters."</p>
		<p>Ellie shook her head sadly. "I would curse them if I weren't better trained."</p>
		<p>"Well, I cursed them for you, several times."</p>
		<p>"What time is it?"</p>
		<p>"About noon."</p>
		<p>"Noon? I've been out a few hours. Vanessa, I think..."</p>
		<p>"Yes?" Vanessa watched her suddenly pale and look anxious.</p>
		<p>"Do you have a basin? I'm afraid I might be sick."</p>
		<p>"Right. Hold on." Vanessa jumped up and ran to the kitchen, dumping the pan she had washed the girl with, and hurried back to find Ellie rolled over, holding her mouth, needing to vomit.</p>
		<p>"Here." She held out the pan. Ellie, however embarrassed, could not prevent herself from vomiting. She retched a few times, with Vanessa holding the pan with her.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I am so sorry."</p>
		<p>"Sshhh. Relax. And just feel better. It's the head injury. Doctor said to expect it. I should have been more prepared. " She handed the girl a warm wash cloth to wipe her mouth.</p>
		<p>"I'm being such a bother for you."</p>
		<p>"Don't think about it, Ellie. Let's get you better. Could you sip some tea?"</p>
		<p>"Maybe. Get this taste out of my mouth."</p>
		<p>"Let me dump this, and return with it empty. Just in case. You lay still. Then I'll get you some tea. Just to sip a little."</p>
		<p>"Alright."</p>
		<p>"Do you want crackers?"</p>
		<p>"Better not."</p>
		<p>"Be back in a jiff."</p>
		<p>A few minutes passed before Vanessa returned with a tea tray and a small plate of dry crackers. And a few mints. She sat it all on the coffee table which she moved closer to Ellie's arm.</p>
		<p>Ellie took the cup and after two or three sips, sat it down, surprised her hand trembled with the effort. She rolled to her back again, and closed her eyes.</p>
		<p>"My head feels six sizes too big. And I'm as weak as a kitten, and so dizzy."</p>
		<p>"Then you're right where you should be, safe and warm. Get some rest. The constable said he'd be around at two PM. Wanted to be sure you could talk."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to talk. Or even think."</p>
		<p>"Can you answer his questions? Is it coming back to you?"</p>
		<p>"In all its horrid detail, yes. I must look a fright."</p>
		<p>"Yes, a little worse for wear. But nothing a few days sunning on a rock won't cure. It could have been so much worse. We'll get through this. Everything will be alright."</p>
		<p>Vanessa could see the girl's gray eyes fill up with tears, and watched them stream silently down her face. It was apparent that she was trying so hard not to cry, tried turning her face away. Vanessa moved again to the couch, wanting to comfort the girl.</p>
		<p>"Hey," she reached out to wipe tears away. "You can cry. I won't tell anyone."</p>
		<p>"Vanessa, I.." Her words were replaced with the sobs she could not contain. Vanessa wasn't sure if she pulled the girl into her arms, or if Ellie reached for her. But Ellie cried on Vanessa's shoulder, softly held in strong arms until she finally calmed. The older woman sensed her settling. She reached into her slacks for a clean handkerchief and then rubbed the girl's back a moment.</p>
		<p>"Here. You look like you can use this more than me."</p>
		<p>Ellie sat up, leaning back on the sofa, while she wiped her eyes, and then blew her nose. She regarded her unlikely savior, and took in her shirt. "Now, I've ruined your blouse."</p>
		<p>"No. You did that earlier." Vanessa shrugged, pointing out the blood and dirt smeared on her sleeve, acquired from carrying the girl into the house.</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry. For all of this. I'll get you a new blouse."</p>
		<p>"I'm not letting you off that easy."</p>
		<p>"Oh, you're not? What then?" Ellie found herself smiling despite her pain, embarrassment and suffering.</p>
		<p>"I'll think of something. " Vanessa spoke softly, smiling kindly at the girl. "Now, let me get you a cold cloth to soothe your eyes. The constable is due any time. Are you up to it? If not, I 'll have him come by later."</p>
		<p>"No. I want to get this over with. I could stand a bathroom, if you'll point me in the right direction."</p>
		<p>"I'll do one better. I'll help you there."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Vanessa. You're ever so kind."</p>
		<p>"Just don't tell anyone. I've worked years on my reputation as an ogre."</p>
		<p>"A very sweet and beautiful ogre."</p>
		<p>"I'll take that into consideration. But you've been concussed. I won't hold you responsible for anything you say today."</p>
		<p>Ellie smiled again at her words. "Come on. Help this poor cripple to the bathroom. Or you'll be cleaning up another mess." With those words, she threw off the cover.</p>
		<p>"Right. Can you stand?"</p>
		<p>Ellie pushed herself up to stand, and visibly swayed.</p>
		<p>"Easy there." Vanessa slid her arm around Ellie's waist to steady her. Both women noticed Ellie's blouse hanging open, and both blushed. "Dr. Jacobs checked your ribs and lungs. Can you get it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. I'll just button it."</p>
		<p>"Yes. Before the constable comes. He's an older man. We wouldn't want him to have a coronary at the sight of a lace bra, now would we?"</p>
		<p>Ellie smiled again, but then seemed to shudder.</p>
		<p>"What? You've turned a new shade of pale."</p>
		<p>"Just as long as David hadn't..."</p>
		<p>"Nothing like that happened, Ellie. I happened by. They took off. You'll hear my version when the constable comes. Fully clothed but beaten," she added softly.</p>
		<p>"Well then, you are right. It could have been so much worse. I'll give my thanks for small favors."</p>
		<p>"So? Bathroom?"</p>
		<p>They made it into the bath without a major misstep. Ellie was safely back to the sofa when the door knocker sounded.</p>
		<p>"The constable." Vanessa stated calmly.</p>
		<p>"Alright. Vanessa?" The woman paused before heading to the door, hearing Ellie's question. "My head is killing me."</p>
		<p>"I won't let this drag on."</p>
		<p>"No. What I meant: do you have some aspirin or something?"</p>
		<p>"Now or later?"</p>
		<p>"Later is fine. Get the door. I hate to be a baby but...."</p>
		<p>"Right after he leaves. And maybe some broth?"</p>
		<p>"Alright." She smiled at the determined look on Vanessa's face.</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"You'd make a good nurse."</p>
		<p>"And you've had your bell rung. " Vanessa smiled at the compliment nonetheless. The knocker sounded again. "Let me see to the police."</p>
		<p>Ellie heard a man's voice questioning Vanessa. Soon both entered the large living room. A wiry older man in a brown uniform , carrying a clipboard, stood at Ellie's side. Vanessa sat down on the couch near Ellie for moral support.</p>
		<p>"Miss Smith, I'm Officer Gage. I need to ask you some questions. I'm sorry to see you hurt like this."</p>
		<p>Ellie nodded stiffly. "What do you need to know?"</p>
		<p>"Tell me what happened, if you can. I'll ask for detail as we go. I've heard part of the story on the phone," he added, nodding toward Vanessa.</p>
		<p>Ellie began recounting what she could about the ride out of town, what she knew about David and his friend. She paused as she remembered walking away from them to look at the sea.</p>
		<p>"This is difficult for you. But please go on," the law officer said in an encouraging voice.</p>
		<p>"He told me his name wasn't David. And then explained what he planned on doing, and why. They were after my summer earnings. I was such a fool to give them a lift."</p>
		<p>"Not your fault. How could you have known?" Vanessa added, trying to ease her concern.</p>
		<p>"I never trusted him, or liked him really. We kept being thrown together all summer because of mutual friends. I would not ...." She looked helplessly at Vanessa.</p>
		<p>"He was interested in you romantically?" Vanessa volunteered.</p>
		<p>"At least sexually. I refused him. I thought he'd gotten over it all. I saw him with a few girls around town."</p>
		<p>"He knew about your money?" Officer Gage redirected the conversation.</p>
		<p>"My flat mates spent most of their time scolding me about working so hard. I had to earn as much as I could for tuition. David and I had even talked about my long work days and such. So yes, he did know about my money in that degree."</p>
		<p>"And the other man?"</p>
		<p>"I never met him before."</p>
		<p>"And then what happened?"</p>
		<p>"He followed me out of the car. I had stopped to clear the air, so to speak, since he had grown angry with me as we left town. And I wanted to see the ocean one more time." She smiled sadly at Vanessa. "This was my favorite spot." Vanessa smiled gently at her words. "And then the other one was riffling through my luggage at the car. He had found the money. Then the beating began, after harsher words from David. I never thought he would hurt me. I was worried about my things. And then I must have blacked out."</p>
		<p>"How much money did you have with you?"</p>
		<p>"My summer wages. All of it. $3500."</p>
		<p>"What is your license plate number? Car type, color? Miss Leland called for us to look for a late 80's light green Ford."</p>
		<p>"An '89 Ford Galaxy, license number 1CN322, Esquire County."</p>
		<p>"No one spotted the car so far. We've been on the lookout for it since ten or so, thanks to Miss Leland. They may have gotten by or ditched the car. It's not likely we'll find them, I'm afraid. Later on, we'll have our sketch artist do a composite sketch."</p>
		<p>"Not necessary, Constable. I've sketched them both." Vanessa spoke up, retrieving her pictures. "I think the resemblance is accurate. David is about my height. Black hair, two hundred pounds, brown eyes. Tan complexion. Muscled like a footballer. The other man I didn't get too good a look at. Still I wonder, Ellie, can you look at these? Would it be too much?"</p>
		<p>"Let me see." Vanessa saw her tense and turn a worrisome shade of gray, looking at David's face. She finally turned her gaze to regard Fred's countenance.</p>
		<p>"The likeness is very real, for both of them. Fred seemed older, maybe twenty eight or so. Thinner. He smelled of cigarettes and liquor in the closed car. They both had on jeans and T-shirts, both unshaven."</p>
		<p>"Very good, then. Miss Leland, shall we go on the porch to speak about what you saw?"</p>
		<p>Vanessa raised an eyebrow at Ellie.</p>
		<p>"I should hear it all, I think." Ellie answered the unspoken question.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure, Ellie?"</p>
		<p>"Go ahead."</p>
		<p>It took only a few minutes to complete the story: the scream, the car being riffled, David kicking a downed girl and running off, backing up the car to purposefully run over the belongings spread on the road.</p>
		<p>"A nasty one, if I say so. You're lucky you are as well off as you are. Not just a simple robbery. Hateful behavior."</p>
		<p>"Then I got her inside, and helped clean her some. Dr. Jacobs came round, and now yourself."</p>
		<p>"Miss Smith, where will you be staying, if we need to get in touch with you?"</p>
		<p>When Ellie suddenly looked desolate and uncertain, even lost, Vanessa spoke up. "Miss Smith will be staying here with me for a while. You have my number. " Vanessa spoke matter-of-factly.</p>
		<p>"Yes, of course. We will do our best. I'll need to see the crime scene."</p>
		<p>"I will take you out now, if you wish. I need to get all her things under cover, as well."</p>
		<p>"Vanessa, I'll pick my things up in a bit."</p>
		<p>"You will stay inside and rest." She spoke more sternly than she had intended, seeing the girl flinch at her words. The constable moved to the porch, sensing a tension in the room between friends. Vanessa watched him exit and turned toward Ellie. "I don't mean to sound overbearing. I'm sorry if I did. All that bending, lifting will make you more dizzy and nauseated. Not to mention stir up your back and ribs. I'll pick it all up in a flash. Let me do this? Alright?"</p>
		<p>"I do feel like garbage. I just hate to be a burden. To not be able to do for myself."</p>
		<p>"Well, even us solitary types need a hand now and again. Put up your feet. You deserve a break. And we can talk about you staying here. You're very welcome here, you know, even if I spoke prematurely."</p>
		<p>"Alright. But we should talk. My pride and upbringing. Still you know I am more than grateful for all you are doing."</p>
		<p>Vanessa could see her eyes start to fill.</p>
		<p>"Now don't cry again, alright? I'll need to fetch you a fresh handkerchief."</p>
		<p>"I will be good. Go on. Show the good constable where my underwear are," she smiled ruefully.</p>
		<p>"Well, if they haven't blown back to town by now. Think of the shocking details in the neighborhood: scented lace undergarments showing up in the most embarrassing places. You'll be the ruination of many a good marriage in these parts, if I don't get moving." She winked at the girl.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Vanessa!" Ellie found herself smiling again. "What an image. The good doctor or the vicar picking my thongs out of the bushes behind their homes. What a good story that would make."</p>
		<p>"Thongs?" She raised another eyebrow making Ellie blush again. "Well, you work on that story...'the bra that got away', while I protect the constable's virtues. I'll be right back. I am going to take a few pillow cases out, in case the satchels are too far gone. I'll ask the constable to bring over your books. Might as well put him to work."</p>
		<p>"Go on then."</p>
		<p>"Need anything?"</p>
		<p>"No. Just hurry back. I could use the company. I hope they kept my dirty wash. It would serve them right." She called after the older woman.</p>
		<p>"That's the spirit!"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ellie heard the sheriff deposit something on the porch and drive off. More time passed before Vanessa came in to lay two over-stuffed pillowcases and a few battered partially zipped suitcases inside the door. Vanessa perched finally on the arm of the couch.</p>
		<p>"Your books and notebooks are safe. Although a little dirty. We can sort out the clothes later, if it's alright?"</p>
		<p>"Whatever. "</p>
		<p>"I don't know what's missing, but I will have you know that I walked a mile round to pick up your unmentionables. And there are still some very sexy pieces dangling from a few pine trees that I couldn't reach. And the beach! I wrestled three gulls to get your bikini back."</p>
		<p>"Stop it. It hurts too much to laugh."</p>
		<p>"Alright then. Oh, they did dump your dirty wash. I have it all in one of those sacks."</p>
		<p>"Oh how embarrassing!" Ellie covered her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Well, I've personally never seen dirty sheets before. I just throw out all my soiled bedding. Keeps the laundry bills down. So it was a good learning experience."</p>
		<p>"Stop already. You're just trying to make me less self conscious about this whole ordeal."</p>
		<p>"Is it working?"</p>
		<p>"I think so. For an irritable stern recluse who resents trespassers, you are quite the good hostess."</p>
		<p>Both women smiled.</p>
		<p>"Speaking of being a good hostess, can I tempt you with some broth and toast and aspirin? I'm a terrible cook, but...."</p>
		<p>"Only if you'll let me help."</p>
		<p>"Up to it?"</p>
		<p>"Um, think so. I need some water and aspirin directly."</p>
		<p>"You just don't trust my cooking."</p>
		<p>"I would never say such a thing. But I'll watch especially closely for wasps and bats."</p>
		<p>"Not for lunch. That's dinner usually."</p>
		<p>"Alright. Broth and toast and aspirin sounds very good."</p>
		<p>Ellie stood carefully and waited a moment for the dizziness to pass. Vanessa watched her with concern.</p>
		<p>"The kitchen is off to the right, just through those doors. We'll move you to the table. Unless you'd be more comfortable here?"</p>
		<p>"I don't think it matters where I sit right now. I couldn't be comfortable anywhere, honestly."</p>
		<p>"You'll feel better in a few days. Come in the kitchen. We can talk while I burn the toast."</p>
		<p>Vanessa moved without thinking to support the girl's waist and steady her. Ellie looked up at her without speaking, but leaned into her strong shoulder gratefully. She sank into a cushioned captain's chair with a groan.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe how sore I am. He must have kicked me everywhere."</p>
		<p>"Let me get you something for pain. I do have something stronger."</p>
		<p>"Aspirin is fine. Really. I would be afraid to take anything more right now. I feel dizzy enough."</p>
		<p>Vanessa worked quietly a while, opening cans and lighting the stove again. It took only a few moments before she sat with Ellie, each eyeing toast and broth and tea.</p>
		<p>Ellie spoke up, looking at the older woman. "You should eat something more substantial."</p>
		<p>"Who is the patient here?"</p>
		<p>"I tend to be bossy, and give unwanted advice all the time. Or so I have been told."</p>
		<p>"That I doubt, Ellie. But I promise to make something heartier for supper, if you are up to it."</p>
		<p>Ellie took a few spoonfuls of broth and dipped her toast in the soup.</p>
		<p>"I won't be chewing for a while. With this jaw."</p>
		<p>"Shall I ice it again?"</p>
		<p>"No....too cold." The blond sighed again. "What a royal mess."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Vanessa ate her soup in silence. She raised her tea cup and toasted the girl. "To better days."</p>
		<p>"And good friends." Ellie added quietly, feeling her eyes tear up again. "You know, you are being much too nice. It's making me want to cry."</p>
		<p>"What? My being nice? Then I'll have to be more miserable. I've had a lot of practice with that, for sure."</p>
		<p>"Don't talk like that about yourself, Vanessa. You've only shown me kindness and friendship." Ellie paused, lost in thought.</p>
		<p>"You seem a thousand miles away." Vanessa encouraged her to speak her thoughts out loud.</p>
		<p>"I don't know what to do."</p>
		<p>"About what?"</p>
		<p>"About this entire mess."</p>
		<p>"Tell me what you are thinking?"</p>
		<p>Ellie paused, unsure how much to reveal or to burden this woman even more with her troubles.</p>
		<p>"I've got all day to listen. No where to go. And I would like to help."</p>
		<p>"Don't be nice. I will cry. I am warning you."</p>
		<p>"Don't do that either."</p>
		<p>Ellie touched Vanessa's hand, unconsciously playing with the long fingers of the artists hand, again lost in thought. She finally spoke up.</p>
		<p>"If I have no tuition money, I can't go back to school. I'm paying my own way."</p>
		<p>"You have worked so hard all summer."</p>
		<p>"So ironic. What is that expression?: 'the best laid plans of mice and men...' So here I am, without a car, no money, no school, no home."</p>
		<p>"No family?" Vanessa asked kindly.</p>
		<p>"No family that wants to see me. I'll have to get a job again, save up for a winter term."</p>
		<p>"You are a determined woman, aren't you?"</p>
		<p>"I want my degree, whatever it takes. So until I get some transportation away, I could stay in town, go back to the restaurant. Get a room someplace. And after a few weeks, maybe a small apartment. But how can I save enough for a car and tuition and just living? I am such a fool, to be robbed of everything and now...."</p>
		<p>"Ellie?" Vanessa interrupted her quietly.</p>
		<p>"What? Oh, I know I am rambling. I am sorry. I just..."</p>
		<p>"Ellie?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"First of all, why would you want to go into town and rent a room?"</p>
		<p>"I can't stay here."</p>
		<p>"Why not?"</p>
		<p>"I've intruded into your life enough. You don't want a problem like me..."</p>
		<p>"How can you know that?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"Ellie, I have a huge house on a beautiful beach. I ramble around here like a recluse, as you know. I have more money than I know what to do with. I have no other commitments that demand my time. Just painting when the mood strikes. I like you, Ellie Smith. Why in the world shouldn't I be a help, if I'm able? You need a place to mend. I promise I won't paint you, looking like you do now, what with bruises and all. Purple is not your color." She smiled kindly again at the girl. "And I could use the company."</p>
		<p>"Vanessa, how can I just take advantage of you like this?"</p>
		<p>"Think about my offer. Stay here until you're well. Then we can talk again. Seems like you need a vacation anyway, to recover from your summer vacation."</p>
		<p>"All for nothing."</p>
		<p>"No, not for nothing. Things have a way of working out. Sometimes it just takes time. This house has six bedrooms."</p>
		<p>"Six bedrooms?"</p>
		<p>"And eight fireplaces and two porches. You could be here a week and I probably wouldn't even notice."</p>
		<p>"You noticed me on your beach."</p>
		<p>"Well, you were hard to miss. Claiming all my favorite spots where I sit to think or paint."</p>
		<p>"I didn't really, did I?"</p>
		<p>"That is why I kept running into you."</p>
		<p>"Honestly, I think I was hoping to run into you. You're very intriguing."</p>
		<p>"Hardly. But don't change the subject. Please stay a while, Ellie. I would love to have you here. Think of all the material for your writing."</p>
		<p>"You are very kind. I don't know what to say."</p>
		<p>"Don't say anything. Just feel better. We can go for a walk tomorrow on the cliffs, if you are up for it. You can help me chase trespassers."</p>
		<p>"I'm one myself, Vanessa."</p>
		<p>"No. You are an invited guest. And a friend. It all comes with that squatters rights thing."</p>
		<p>"Don't make me cry." She could feel her eyes fill even as she said the words.</p>
		<p>"Let's get you settled. And then put on a wash. Maybe get your clothes organized."</p>
		<p>"I should do it."</p>
		<p>"How 'bout we do it together? I'm not touching any really dirty wash. Ugh!"</p>
		<p>Ellie smiled and shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Let me clear the table and bring out the bags. You can sort things out. We'll get a wash going, and then I'll show you to a room. The views upstairs are wonderful. And it is never hot with the breezes from the shore. Very quiet at night. Good for thinking or sleeping or dreaming. Then later, we can wander out and try to retrieve those bras and thongs dangling from the trees. My reputation is bad enough. I can hear them now. She continued in a high strained artificial voice. " Did you know she actually decorated her pine trees with woman's lingerie? LIke a Christmas tree! Has the woman no shame? And she paints women in the nude! Just whose underwear are they?"</p>
		<p>Ellie laughed. "You have got to be crazier than me. But not by much. What must you think of this small town? And all the gossip? It must bother you."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I am used to it. I just generate curiosity, I suppose."</p>
		<p>"It's your haunting good looks and cool demeanor, you know."</p>
		<p>"I suppose it is all a way to distance myself. Are you sure you are up to staying here? You should hear all the rumors before you decide to stay." Vanessa spoke seriously suddenly.</p>
		<p>"Well, it is a little too late for that, isn't it? You already told the constable that I would be staying."</p>
		<p>"I never thought. I...."</p>
		<p>"You look mortified. Just how bad is your reputation, Vanessa Leland?" Ellie smiled kindly at the artist. "I really didn't hear much about you in town, and I was trying to discover all I could."</p>
		<p>"You didn't ask the right people. Perhaps you should not stay."</p>
		<p>"Now you're throwing me out?"</p>
		<p>Vanessa continued in a rush. "Ellie, I'm the notorious lesbian in town. Your reputation, a young innocent here alone with me..." she spoke seriously.</p>
		<p>"I just spent the summer living with three other woman in a small apartment. What does that make me?"</p>
		<p>"It is not the same thing."</p>
		<p>"Have you thought that I might be bad for your reputation?"</p>
		<p>"Hardly."</p>
		<p>"Well," Ellie looked at her with a mischievous glare. "Perhaps I will do an interview with the paper:</p>
		<p>'Infamous lesbian kidnaps young student, beats her into submission, subjecting her to unmentionable acts, hanging the girl's underwear outside in strange pagan ritual.'</p>
		<p>"Oh, god, what a thought. You don't suppose anyone would...."</p>
		<p>"I will be sure to kneel at your feet when the doctor comes in the morning, and address you as Mistress." Ellie burst out laughing. "Oh, you should see your face! Now you have turned a lovely shade of pale."</p>
		<p>"You are terrible," Vanessa replied, finally laughing as well.</p>
		<p>"So you see, Vanessa, it's already too late. I might as well stay a while, if you can put up with me. But maybe you should take warning. You may not be the only suspicious character in town."</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"Well, some might gossip that I am a psychotic stalker, following you all summer, staging a beating at your doorstep, just to get into your house and your life. " Ellie raised an eyebrow and stared in the most menacing fashion that she could manage, until both woman broke out in laughter again.</p>
		<p>"Oh, that sinister sneer!" Vanessa wiped tears from her eyes. "But you're much too cute to be a psychotic stalker. God, how priceless. I haven't laughed so hard in years."</p>
		<p>"Looks can be deceiving. And so can rumors." Ellie added quietly. "I think you are too hard on yourself."</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Ellie. Maybe all the gossip and innuendo bother me more than I like to admit."</p>
		<p>"Well I for one say: 'just trash rumors.' So, if it's alright, I will stay awhile, until I'm mended and know what to do. And I'll be eternally grateful for the rescue, and your unwarranted hospitality and kindness."</p>
		<p>"It's all settled then. My home is yours, Ellie. So, shall we tackle this wash, then?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The next few hours passed in easy comradeship, doing two washes between them. Vanessa carried everything upstairs, and chose a room for Ellie next to her own, adjacent to a bath. The bed was made up fresh, the windows opened to the breeze. She returned downstairs to find Ellie looking at a wall of books in the living room.</p>
		<p>"I chose a room for you."</p>
		<p>"Just so I am not in the way."</p>
		<p>"Never. Help yourself to anything that interests you." Vanessa spoke absently, nodding at the bookcase. " I have eclectic taste in literature."</p>
		<p>Ellie turned to study the tall woman who leaned on the door frame. "Where did you study?"</p>
		<p>"Several places."</p>
		<p>"And that is all you will volunteer?"</p>
		<p>"I am always reluctant to talk about myself."</p>
		<p>"Just curious. You are clearly well educated."</p>
		<p>"Yes. Father insisted on the best for his wayward daughter. Out of guilt, I think, for having no time for me at all. So I finished my undergraduate degree and went on to get a doctorate. I taught for a few years. I am the product of ten years of the most expensive education England had to offer, before returning to Canada."</p>
		<p>"How old are you,Vanessa?"</p>
		<p>"Care to guess?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"I'm thirty three."</p>
		<p>"Very young to be so learned, a professor and famous to boot."</p>
		<p>"I got an early start. And was just as determined as you seem to be."</p>
		<p>"I am twenty three. I got a late start and am trying to enter my sophomore year."</p>
		<p>"Doing it all the hard way. By sweat and tears. Not like me. It was too easy. Maybe why, in the end, it meant less to me."</p>
		<p>"It obviously meant something, for you to work so hard and accomplish so much at a young age."</p>
		<p>"At one time, perhaps. But things change. And now, well...I mostly paint. You don't look twenty three. " Vanessa hoped to change the subject with her comment.</p>
		<p>"What? You thought I was fifteen or so? "</p>
		<p>"You do look young. But not that young. Please."</p>
		<p>"How long have you lived here?"</p>
		<p>"Three years.</p>
		<p>"Your house is lovely."</p>
		<p>"You haven't seen the tour. When you're up to it, I'll take you around."</p>
		<p>"I could stroll around now."</p>
		<p>"Alright. You've seen the kitchen, and the living room. Come through here. The dining room which I never use."</p>
		<p>"You don't entertain?"</p>
		<p>"Need you ask? And here, a screened porch along the back of the house."</p>
		<p>"How much land? Do you really own the beach front?"</p>
		<p>"Twenty five acres, and ten acres of beach front."</p>
		<p>"I could be jealous of this place, if it were in me."</p>
		<p>"But it's not in you, I know."</p>
		<p>"No. I am happy you have such a wonderful retreat."</p>
		<p>"Do you think you can handle the stairs?"</p>
		<p>"Slowly."</p>
		<p>"I wonder if a hot bath might make you feel better."</p>
		<p>"If I got in the tub, I might be unable to get out."</p>
		<p>"Maybe a hot shower. Loosen your back some?"</p>
		<p>"That might work."</p>
		<p>"Let me show you to your room. You can decide if you want to rest or shower, or finish the tour."</p>
		<p>"Alright. I might borrow some more aspirin? And a hot water bottle. I am sore."</p>
		<p>"I have one of those electric heating pads, moist heat, good for sore backs. I'm sure I can find it in some closet."</p>
		<p>"That sounds good."</p>
		<p>Vanessa waited for her to start up the stairs. "Go on up. I'll be along. I want to look for that heating pad. You can poke around upstairs if you get there before me."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to pry."</p>
		<p>"You won't. You'll see your things in a spare room on the right."</p>
		<p>With those words, Vanessa ducked back into the hall and a closet there. She checked the closet off the kitchen, but shrugged her shoulders.</p>
		<p>'Must be upstairs someplace.'</p>
		<p>Just then the phone rang.</p>
		<p>"Hello?"</p>
		<p>"Vanessa, Dr. Jacobs. How is our patient?"</p>
		<p>"Awake, alert and very sore. But she's kept some broth and toast down, and we're up walking."</p>
		<p>"Good. Very good. Do you think I need come around in the morning?"</p>
		<p>"I'll ask her, but I think not."</p>
		<p>"Use hot baths, mild exercises, aspirin, heating pad. She should be better each day."</p>
		<p>"I will ring back if she wants you to come. And certainly if she is worse."</p>
		<p>"Right. I won't come unless I hear from you. And if problems do arise in the next few days, you will call me?"</p>
		<p>"Of course. Good day doctor."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Vanessa joined Ellie in the hall upstairs.</p>
		<p>"Made it." Ellie commented quietly. Vanessa observed her holding onto the wall as she spoke.</p>
		<p>"Are you alright?"</p>
		<p>"Just dizzy."</p>
		<p>"Let me show you your room. Should you lay down?"</p>
		<p>"Maybe I ought to. For an hour or so."</p>
		<p>"And then it will be dinner. I can bring you up something."</p>
		<p>"Not. I'll join you for dinner. I should cook it."</p>
		<p>"You can cook tomorrow. Put up with my culinary attempts tonight. My cooking won't kill you, at least not in small amounts. Only over an extended period of time."</p>
		<p>"You are too much," Ellie said smiling. "And you said you were poor at humor."</p>
		<p>"I am usually. You inspire me to be pleasant, I think. "</p>
		<p>"Well, you make me feel most welcome and also very safe. And somehow not so alone. This experience has been...."</p>
		<p>"Worth forgetting." Vanessa finished the thought, seeing Ellie grow too serious again. "Here is your room. I hope it will do. If not, there are four others to choose from."</p>
		<p>The room before them was at least twenty by thirty feet, bright and airy with three large windows. The walls were white, and the bedspread and upholstered chairs were navy and white flowers, as was the room border. The wooden floor was covered in a wool Wilton area rug, a dark blue and green pattern. The dresser was cherry as was the poster bed. The walls were decorated with water colors of sea grass along the coast line, and long wooden piers with pelicans and gulls. There was a love seat and brass floor lamp beneath a window looking out at the shoreline and cliffs. A steady sea breeze moved the cotton sheers in a lazy swirl. A fireplace and a high back overstuffed chair with a down filled cushion finished the other wall.</p>
		<p>Vanessa walked on ahead, and turned down the large bed, fluffing the pillows before she turned to regard the girl.</p>
		<p>"I still need to find the heating pad," she spoke absently. She finally realized that Ellie had not left the doorway. Rather she stood regarding her quietly, then let her eyes move from one fixture to the next. "What? Would you prefer another room?</p>
		<p>It's near mine, and the bath is right next door. I thought..."</p>
		<p>"This is the loveliest room I have ever seen." Ellie spoke slowly. "And I swear, you are the loveliest person I've ever met."</p>
		<p>"Will you be comfortable here?" Vanessa asked, uncertain of the emotions that seemed to cross the girl's face.</p>
		<p>"Yes, dear Vanessa. I couldn't imagine a more perfect spot. I'm just a little overwhelmed by this house, this room, and most of all by you. I feel I'm here by mistake somehow. Like I've boarded the wrong plane. And any minute the stewardess will return me to where I belong."</p>
		<p>"Then I'll have to work harder to convince you that you really are where you are meant to be. The only thing wrong is not where you are, but the unpleasant path that brought you here."</p>
		<p>Ellie just looked at the woman with quiet wonder. She moved finally to sit on the bed near her. "I don't know how I'll ever repay your kindness."</p>
		<p>"By letting me help you anyway I can." She spoke perhaps with more sentiment than she intended. She unconsciously brushed a lock of hair off Ellie's cheek, and smiled at the girl. "I'll let you...rest then. " The older woman finished somewhat awkwardly.</p>
		<p>Ellie looked away from her, but was reluctant to have her leave. She spotted the paintings.</p>
		<p>"Are they yours?"</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"The paintings?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"You have such talent. Are you good at everything you attempt?"</p>
		<p>"Now you are trying to make me laugh. I think painting is the only thing in my life I have done well. All the rest, I'm not sure of."</p>
		<p>"Did they ruin the oil painting? My painting?"</p>
		<p>"I did not get a good look at it. The frame won't be repaired. The canvas? We can inspect it later if you want. Or I'll let you pick another."</p>
		<p>Ellie shook her head. "No. I want that one, regardless."</p>
		<p>"Then we'll have to salvage it, won't we?"</p>
		<p>"You seem good at salvaging."</p>
		<p>"Pardon?"</p>
		<p>"You've managed to salvage my trampled spirits and flagging hope." She smiled warmly at the artist, stretching back stiffly onto the bed. " Where are my shoes?" She looked at her bare feet in surprise. "I've been so preoccupied, I've only just noticed."</p>
		<p>"You know, you have a habit of suddenly shifting topics of conversation. But regardless, I took them off earlier. Dr . Jacobs had to scratch your feet, or some such. I'll bring them up directly."</p>
		<p>"I am fine without them. I'm resting now, anyway. I was just thinking..."</p>
		<p>"Changing the subject again?" Ellie smiled at her gentle kidding. "Go on. I am sorry to have interrupted."</p>
		<p>"I was just thinking that you have seen my worst today."</p>
		<p>"Your worst?"</p>
		<p>"I've bled all over you. You've washed me, held me while I vomited, held me while I've cried, sorted my dirty wash, caught me from falling, comforted me when I've been so needy. Seen me bruised and battered and ugly. Taken me in when I'm homeless and penniless."</p>
		<p>"And your point is what, exactly?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sure it's all more than you signed on for."</p>
		<p>"I'll tell you what, Ellie Smith. What I've seen today, your strength, your gratitude, your wit and charm in the face of adversity and pain....if these are your worst, I can't wait to see you at your best."</p>
		<p>She bent quickly and kissed the top of the blond's hair, and moved away toward the door.</p>
		<p>"Get some rest, before I make an idiot of myself."</p>
		<p>She was halfway out the door, afraid to look back, when Ellie called to her. "Vanessa?"</p>
		<p>She turned automatically to meet Ellie's gaze, serious and caring.</p>
		<p>"You could never make yourself a fool in my eyes. Anything but. I'll see you later."</p>
		<p>Vanessa closed the door softly behind her, leaning against the wall, her eyes closed and her thoughts racing.</p>
		<p>'Careful Vanessa. Don't start something.' 'I'm not sure I have a choice. Something's already started.' 'Go do something useful. Find the heating pad. Take a cold shower. Paint something.'</p>
		<p>'Yes. I better.'</p>
