<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 12: Spam Scanning -->

<p>Sam drove up to the palace in her car almost running over the neighbor's cat. She put the car in park and it sounded like the neighbor's cat was stuck somewhere under her car. However, it wasn't the cat, it was the car.</p>
<p>"Good old reliable." Sam said when she closed the door and one of the rear-view mirrors fell off. She just knew that was going to happen if she closed the door to hard. But she hadn't time to fix that. She was busy putting operation 'prove I'm not some crazy pregnant freak' into work.</p>
<p>She walked up to her room and rumbled around her desk in search of a telephone number. But it was impossible to find anything in that mess. Magazines, candy bar wrappers, old candy bars, a mouldy bowl of cereals, huge amounts of loose papers and somewhere under there her laptop, were lying on her desk making it look like a dumpster. When she realized she would never find the piece of paper she was looking for in that mess, she dug up her laptop and logged on to the whinyass.com community and searched through old messages from "D_the_slayer_wannabe" for her phone number.</p>
<p>"Yay!" She shrieked when she found what she was looking for.</p>
<p>She picked up the phone right away and dialed the number.</p>
<p>Someone, Sam presumed it was a female, who sounded kinda rude picked up the phone.</p>
<p>"Uhm, hi may I please speak to Dawn?"</p>
<p>"Okay, hold on. Dawn! It's for you!" The girl sighed.</p>
<p>"Hell-o-o!" Dawn sang.</p>
<p>"Hi, it's Sam from ..."</p>
<p>"Oh! Sam!" the girl squealed, "What's up?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, hi." Sam said feeling rather uncomfortable with the other girl's enthusiasm. "Uhm, I don't really know how to explain this but I need your help."</p>
<p>"With?"</p>
<p>"Remember you've told me all these weird stories about your weird sister and weird friends?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>"Well something really weird happened and I need your help to get me out of this mess."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"I'm pregnant."</p>
<p>"And the weird part is?"</p>
<p>"I have a girlfriend?"</p>
<p>"I still don't get the weird part."</p>
<p>"Well, my girlfriend impregnated me."</p>
<p>"Aaaah. Now I get it. You should've told me that from the start. I think this is a case for Willow."</p>
<p>"The Wiccan?"</p>
<p>"No, the tree." Dawn laughed but Sam didn't get it. And Dawn got that, so she cleared her throat and continued. "I told you about her."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, she's the one that's with that other Wiccan, right?"</p>
<p>"Exacto."</p>
<p>"You really think she could help me?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, oh you know what? You can come to Sunnydale this weekend."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Jupp, I'm sure! You and your girlfriend can stay here, I'm sure Willow and Tara can show you some nightly-disco-dancing-gay-action, if there is any here... You know Sunnydale is kind of a..."</p>
<p>"Uhm, yeah, sure." Sam interrupted Dawn before she gave her a full one-hour long re-view Sunnydale's non-existing nightlife. She had no time for that. She had more important things to do. Like finding her girlfriend. "I was thinking about bringing some friends along, but we can all just get a room somewhere..."</p>
<p>"Nah, you can all stay here, it's a big house."</p>
<p>"You sure?"</p>
<p>"Jupp."</p>
<p>"And your sister?"</p>
<p>"She won't mind, she's all busy with the slaying and bleached vampires, ya know."</p>
<p>"K, I'll call you Friday when we're on our way?"</p>
<p>"Great!"</p>
<p>"Great, bye then."</p>
<p>Sam hung up the phone with a big happy grin on her face. All she needed to do now was to find Brooke and talk to her and operation 'prove I'm not some crazy pregnant freak' was on a roll.</p>
