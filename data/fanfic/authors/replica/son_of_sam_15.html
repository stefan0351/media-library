<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 15: It Takes Two To Boogie -->

<p>Sam walked up to the house on the address that the girl in the shop gave her and rang the doorbell. After a couple of seconds, a girl with brown hair and leather pants opened the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Hi, is this the Summers house?"</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"I'm looking for Dawn Summers."</p>
<p>"Hold on." Said the girl and closed the door. Sam heard some shouting coming from inside and guessed it was the right house. She waved at the others to get out of the car.</p>
<p>A red haired, kinda tall (somewhat taller than Sam), kinda skinny, kinda happy shiny girl opened the door with the biggest smile Sam had seen since Brooke made her try on an Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka-dot Bikini.</p>
<p>The two girls greeted each other with a friendly hug and enthusiastic Hi's.</p>
<p>"Dawn, this is my girlfriend Brooke." Sam said when Brooke approached the door. The two shake hands and Sam later introduced the rest of the gang.</p>
<p>"Everybody, this is Faith." Dawn said when they stepped in to the house and found the brunette sitting in the kitchen. She gave them a half-hearted smile and a little wave.</p>
<p>"Okay... Let's go in to the other room instead." Dawn said shoving the girls out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"So, how was the trip?" Dawn asked while everybody was finding somewhere to sit. Sam and Brooke sat down next to each other on the sofa with Carmen, Mary Cherry sat down on a chair and when Lily was about to grab the chair beside her, Nicole gave her a little shove so poor Lily landed on top of Dawn.</p>
<p>"Hey! What was that for?" Lily wailed.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry Lily. I didn't see you."</p>
<p>"Uhm, the ride here was nice." Brooke answered Dawn's question.</p>
<p>"So your sister doesn't mind all us being here?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Nah, and if she doesn't like it I can just run away again."</p>
<p>Carmen broke out into one of her famous awkward chuckles because she thought Dawn was joking. But we all know, little Dawn wasn't joking.</p>
<p>"Hey, l'il Dawnie, where are we all going to sleep? Cause I ain't crashing on the floor like some common Joe." Mary Cherry said.</p>
<p>"Let's see... Three of you could sleep upstairs; two can sleep here on the couch and... One would have to sleep on the floor." Dawn gave her a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>"Well that ain't me."</p>
<p>"Me neither." Nicole said.</p>
<p>"Guys, we don't have to decide that now. Let's... talk about something else." Said Sam. "So, when do we get to meet Willow and her girlfriend?"</p>
<p>"I think they'll be here any minute now. They said they were going to swing buy the magic box to grab some stuff after school and then hurry back home to meet you guys."</p>
<p>"The magic box?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a magic store that our friend Giles owns. It's full with books and witchy stuff."</p>
<p>"Giles?"</p>
<p>"He's British. And kinda old actually. We only know him because he used to be Buffy's watcher."</p>
<p>"Is that like British for her sugar daddy?" Nicole asked and the others giggled in unison.</p>
<p>"Naah, he was more like the guy that made sure she didn't get in to much trouble."</p>
<p>"Oh." The girls said all at the same time.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes of semi-awkward small talk, Willow and her girlfriend Tara walked into the room.</p>
<p>"Hello!" She said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Hi." Everybody in the room answered.</p>
<p>"Hey, Will, this is Sam and her girlfriend Brooke."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you." The four ladies shake hands.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>While Faith and Dawn were out on a tour around SunnyD with Carmen, Lily, Mary Cherry and Nicole, the others stayed at home to prepare a spell to find out whom the father of Sam's baby is.</p>
<p>"Okay, first of all, I need a lock of you hair Brooke." Willow said looking in one of her spell books. "And I also need a drop of your blood."</p>
<p>"Okay." Brooke said giving Sam a worried look.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous." Tara said in a low voice. "We just need it to put a spell on this little aniseed. If you want to you can go outside and get some air while we do this."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Hey, are you sure about his?" Sam asked Brooke.</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About all this. The spell that Willow and Tara are doing."</p>
<p>"I... I don't know. I mean, do you really think this will work?"</p>
<p>"I think so. Dawn said Willow has been doing spells and stuff like that for years now. And besides, the whole thing about me being pregnant by you is freaky enough. This has to work."</p>
<p>"And what if it doesn't?"</p>
<p>"Don't you trust me Brooke?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do."</p>
<p>"Then why do you say something like that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. You have to understand that this isn't easy for me to handle sweetie. What if I would all of the sudden get pregnant? Wouldn't you believe I'd slept with someone else before you would even think of the possibility that it might have been you?"</p>
<p>"Okay, you might me right on that one. But still, it hurts when you don't believe me."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry baby." Brooke said and gave Sam a kiss.</p>
<p>"Uhm... Sorry to interrupt you little smooch fest," Willow said standing at the front door, "But I need you guys to come in for a little while."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Tonight, before you go to sleep, you put the little aniseed in you belly button..." Willow said handing over the seed to Sam.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" Brooke asked surprised.</p>
<p>"Jupp, pretty much."</p>
<p>"So, how does this work?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Well, if the aniseed is still in your belly when you wake up, the baby is Brookes. But if the aniseed has fallen out, it's not."</p>
<p>"But what if I accidentally knock the seed out in my sleep?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that. This seed is enchanted remember? If it really is Brooke's baby it's gonna be there in the morning even if you take it out yourself."</p>
<p>"Wow, this is so cool." Sam smiled.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>After the grand tour of Sunnydale, the girls headed back to the Summer's house for some pizza and fun, along with Anya and Xander who had joined the party as well. Lily and Mary Cherry were getting kinda cozy in the couch together while Nicole tried her best at getting in their way. But Anya, who was quire fascinated with the blonde, kept getting in her way. Sam and Willow were talking computer stuff, Lily and Tara were exchanging vegetarian recipes and Faith was trying to flirt with a rather flattered Brooke. After a while, Buffy came home and stuffed herself with the last pieces of pizza. In other words, it was quite a nice evening for the Santa Monica girls.</p>
<p>When it was time to go to bed, a little fight broke out over the bed arrangements. First of all, no one wanted to sleep on the floor. Second of all, Mary Cherry had asked Lily if she wanted to share the couch with her but both Carmen and Nicole insisted on sleeping on the couch too. The only ones who knew where to sleep were Sam and Brooke, who were going to take Dawn's bed. Mary Cherry suggested they should take it out side and wrestle over the beds, but Sam had a much better idea. To simply draw lots and leave it to the chance.</p>
<p>Again, everybody where happy except Nicole. Carmen had got the spare bed upstairs, Lily and Mary Cherry got the couch and Nicole had to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag. She tried to sneak out and get a room at the nearest Motel but both Buffy and Faith had stopped her, claiming that it was too dangerous for her to walk around by her self.</p>
<p>Upstairs, Sam and Brooke were in bed and Sam had the aniseed in her belly.</p>
<p>"So, are you ready?" Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"For tomorrow. It will be a very big day for the two of us."</p>
<p>"The three of us." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>Brooke placed a kiss on Sam's belly. "It doesn't matter what happens to this little seed. I love you so much Sammy. And I wanna be there for you and the baby, no matter what."</p>
<p>Sam stared at Brooke with her mouth opened.</p>
<p>"What? Did I say something wrong?"</p>
<p>"No Brooke. It's just... That was... I mean... That was probably the sweetest thing you ever said to me. You don't know how much that means to me."</p>
<p>"I think I do Sam. That came straight from the heart, I really meant it. I love that baby as much as I love you."</p>
<p>"Jesus Brooke, you're making me cry."</p>
<p>"And you are making me cry."</p>
<p>"Promise me you'll never leave me Brooke."</p>
<p>"I promise. I'll never ever leave you."</p>
