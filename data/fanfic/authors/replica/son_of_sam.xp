<chapter title="Part 1: Dream a Little Dream">
<p>"Princess? Hey Princess, wake up. Brooke! Come on!"</p>
<p>Brooke slowly opened her eyes and saw something dark in front of her face. As her vision got less blurry, she could make out a pair of dark eyes and dark hair.</p>
<p>"What are you dreaming about?"</p>
<p>Brook squinted looking up at the brunette sitting on her bed.</p>
<p>"W-what... Why?"</p>
<p>"You were talking in your sleep again."</p>
<p>Brook tried to sit her self up while rubbing her eyes with one hand. "What time is it?" She asked when realizing that it was still dark outside.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Maybe two or three something." The brunette shrugged.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and hit Sam on the arm with a small pillow.</p>
<p>"Sam! Why the hell did you wake me up? I've got early practice tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You sounded scared and I thought you might want some comfort." Sam pouted rubbing her arm though the pillow didn't hurt her at all.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and stroke the brunette's cheek with her thumb. She just looked to damn cute pouting. "What was I saying?" She smiled.</p>
<p>"You where saying 'Oh spank me harder Sammy!' and then there were some grunting." Sam didn't believe the blonde's eyes could possible get more wider than they were right then. Without being able to stop the giggle forming bigger in her throat, she threw her self back in the bed bursting in to a hysterical laugh.</p>
<p>Brooke looked at the laughing brunette in front or her with insecurity spread all over her face. "What's so funny Sam?" She asked pulling the covers up to hide her face.</p>
<p>"It's just that..." Sam paused to gather her self and clear her throat, "You looked SO cute and so scared when I told you..."</p>
<p>She paused again to catch her still irregular breath, "But I'm only joking princess." She burst in to yet another laugh, though more moderated this time.</p>
<p>Brooke was red from embarrassment, hiding her face in her hands. Sam finally managed to control her laughter and tried to get Brooke to take away her hands from her face. "Hey! Why are you hiding? Don't tell me you actually were dreaming of me spanking you? Cause if that's what you want then..."</p>
<p>"Sam!" The blonde exclaimed while hitting Sam with the same small pillow as last time. "I was not! But I sure think you would like that!"</p>
<p>"What if I do?" Sam teased.</p>
<p>Brooke hit Sam again, this time with her fist. "Aotch! What's up with you hitting me? Aha. Maybe you're the one who wanna spank me?" That earned Sam yet an other blow on her arm.</p>
<p>"Did you wake me up just to piss me off Sam? Cause I just wanna kick your..."</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay!" Sam hold up her hands for protection in case of the blonde striking an other blow at her.</p>
<p>"Was I actually talking in my sleep Sam? Cause if I was, I wanna know, and if I wasn't," Brooke paused and locked eyes with Sam, "get out of my room!" Brooke threw her self on top on Sam and started tickling her. Sam struggled for a while before she managed to get out of Brookes grip.</p>
<p>"I can't get out of your room if you keep pinning me down to your bed princess." Sam laughed. "Do you or do you not want to know what you were saying?"</p>
<p>"So I was talking in my sleep..." Sam nod. "Okay, what did I say?"</p>
<p>"You were saying something like 'No Sammy, that is not my baby'. Is there something you're not telling me?" Brooke stared at Sam with her mouth slightly opened. "God Brooke, are you pregnant?"</p>
<p>"What? No Sammy! I just remembered what I was dreaming."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh?"</p>
<p>"You were pregnant Sam. And the weirdest thing was that I was the father... I mean mother... or... you know what I mean."</p>
<p>"You impregnated me Brooke?" Sam asked giggling.</p>
<p>"Yeah. And it was really weird. Everything was so real." Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"I don't think we have to worry about that happening, do we princess?" Sam flashed the blonde a mischievous grin moving closer so they were sitting face to face. She cupped her face with her hands and moved in brushing her lips against Brookes.</p>
<p>"Sam I don't think we..." Brooke made it only so far, because before she knew it, Sam was claiming her lips.</p>
<p>"Sam please," Brooke broke the kiss," it's late and I really need to sleep. You know how sulky Nic gets when I slack at practice."</p>
<p>"But I need you Brooke." Sam pouted. "Can't I at least sleep next to you in your bed? My bed is so cold and lonely."</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. She really needed her sleep, however, she knew Sam would never give in. And those puppy dog eyes were really making her all mushy. "Okay Sam. But don't you be putting your hands on inappropriate places! I need to sleep." She said patting on the bed.</p>
<p>Sam's face lit up like a Christmas tree and she hurried to lay down next to the cheerleader. She spooned her and rested her face in Brooke's hair. After a while, when Brooke managed to drift in to sleep, Sam started to place feather light kisses on her neck. Brooke turned a little and Sam bit her, first carefully and then harder. The blond let out a small moan as she turned some more. The brunette grinned and caressed the length on Brookes leg, moving her hand up to Brookes tummy and just when she was about to cup one of Brookes breasts, the blond slapped her hand.</p>
<p>"I told you Sam: No hand on inappropriate places! Do I have to throw you out of my room?" She felt Sam shaking her head. "Good. Now, I really need to sleep. I promise we can play tomorrow, okay baby?"</p>

<chapter title="Part 2: Lost and Found">
<p>Sam was rummaging in her locker trying to find that notebook were she had notes for the school paper. She had all her ideas there; 'What's up with Nicole Julian's so called redemption?' and that stupid column about the deceased May Tuna. Sam had heard from Kennedy High's own gossip queen Mary Cherry that May's sister, April Tuna, had paid the principal to get that column in to the paper.</p>
<p>"I don't believe this! People on this school don't have the slightest clue about recycling garbage!" The girl standing next to Sam exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I though you have given up on that Lily"</p>
<p>"Sam, environmental issues are not something you give up just like that." Lily said in a serious tone shaking her head. Sam raised a brow. "Okay," the Latina continued, "I might not be as... pushy, as I used to be. But that does not mean that I have given up!"</p>
<p>"Okay Lily, I believe you." The brunette smiled. Knowing the assertively of Lily in these things, better not argue with her.</p>
<p>"Damn! I can't find my notebook."</p>
<p>"You mean that little red one you always carry around?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Have you seen it?"</p>
<p>"You left in on the desk last period. I saw it but I though you were going back to get it."</p>
<p>Sam slammed the door of her locker and walked rapidly towards the classroom with out saying anything. Lily figured Sam was going after her notebook and followed the brunette.</p>
<p>"It's not here!"</p>
<p>"Are you sure Sam? Have you checked under the seats?"</p>
<p>"Yes I have. God, I don't believe this! This is not good." Sam said holding her head with her hands.</p>
<p>"It's just a note book Sam."</p>
<p>"No Lily, It's not 'Just a notebook'!" Sam said on the edge of breakdown. "I have a lot of confidential info from my... sources. And if that information gets in the wrong hands. I'm fried! Dead!"</p>
<p>"You have sources?" Lily asked puzzled.</p>
<p>"Because of journalist ethics, I can't tell you her name, but it rimes with hairy berry. And you know that this hairy berry can say anything about anybody if you just press the right buttons."</p>
<p>"So what kind of information did you have in there?"</p>
<p>"I have been doing this thing about Nicole. Cause I think it's extraordinary, not to mention weird, how much she has changed since she hit me with the car. I think she went a little mental."</p>
<p>"You were gonna print that in the school paper?" Lily asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"No, it was just something I did for the challenge of it. And now my note book is probably SO in the wrong hands" Sam said throwing her hands in the air.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brooke was standing on the school parking lot, leaning against Sam's car taping her foot and starting to get a little bit too impatient.</p>
<p>"What's up hun?" She heard a voice say from behind.</p>
<p>"Hi Nic." Brooked offered a half-hearted smile.</p>
<p>"What are you...?" Nicole stopped mid sentence when she realized Brooke was standing next to Sam's car. "Do you want me to give you a ride home Brookie? Don't want you risking your life in the Spam mobile."</p>
<p>"Nic." Brooke pleaded.</p>
<p>"I know hun." The blonde sighed. "I am really trying my best to be all cordial with Miss McPherson you know."</p>
<p>"You don't have to pretend Nic. I think Sam will do just fine without your sympathy. She has the last three years." Brooke said dryly.</p>
<p>Nicole tried her best to hide the stabbing feeling of Brooke's words. Things between Brooke and Nicole had been not so very good for quite a while. Especially after the accident. And it was because of the accident that Nicole had changed her way of thinking, her way of acting. Heck, if she hadn't done that she'd be in juvenile by now. However, no one seemed to believe she had changed. No one was able to see the 'New Nicole'. The only thing her so-called friends could see was the old, cold-hearted, psycho bitch they had learned not to mess with.</p>
<p>"Okay Brooke. I'll see you tomorrow at practice." Nicole offered her a smile and turned to walk away.</p>
<p>Brooke stood stunned as the other blonde walked away. Nicole didn't give her a hard verbal punch right in the face, as she usually would do. Not even a snotty comment. Brooke couldn't even begin to understand what the heck had happened to Nicole. She could understand Nicole's regrets regarding the accident. Nevertheless, things were just too wired, even for Nicole.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Brooke was caught off guard as she felt a warm breath against her neck. "Hey princess."</p>
<p>"Jesus! Sam!" Brooke squirmed as she turned around feeling her heart race at 100 km/h. "Are you trying to scare me to death?"</p>
<p>"I was only saying hi. What's got you so scared?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing. I'm just tired. I've been waiting for you here almost twenty minutes!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Honey. Lily wanted to... ehm... talk to me, about something." Sam answered nervously. She didn't want Brooke to find out about the Nicole report. Brooke would make her stop writing it. And mabye even giving her a hard time about it.</p>
<p>"Something wrong Sammy?"</p>
<p>"Nah. Everything's okay." She wrapped her arms around the blonde's slim body and pulled her in for a kiss. "Let's go home instead. You promised we're gonna play to day." She whispered in a husky tone.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 3: The Reproduction Of Death">
<p>"Listen up my soon to be college drop-outs!" Ms Roberta Glass stood in front of her desk trying to gather her lively bunch of students.</p>
<p>"It accures to me that this class is looking more like a gays rights movement parade rather than an actual biology class." Ms Glass looked over at Sam and Brooke, later at Lilly who rolled her eyes. Just when Lilly was about to open her mouth to comment on that, Ms Glass spoke up again.</p>
<p>"Hear me out before you start nagging Esposito." The bio teacher turned around putting a bunch of papers on the desk.</p>
<p>"The painfully annoying miss Esposito submitted me a written proposition regarding "more influence" in this class's curriculum", Miss Glass gestured quotation marks with her fingers, "as well a suggestion to bring up the subject of in vitro fertilization. At first, I dismissed it as I do all of Esposito's suggestions. However, I am honestly sick and tired of trying to come up with, and I quote miss irksome; 'interesting, fruitful and instructive' subjects that would capture your attention, since more than half of you are going to flunk this class anyway. So, today we are talking about in vitro fertilization."</p>
<p>Lily stared at her teacher with her mouth opened. This was probably the only time Bobbi Glass had agreed on something she had suggested without the ulterior motive to make a complete fool of her in front of the entire class. On the other hand, was she?</p>
<p>"Before we see the movie provided by the lovely people from the state board of education, I am going to run down some simple facts so you know what the heck we're talking about. I think the Mc-Blissfuls should pay extra attention." Ms Glass handed out a sheet to each student with texts and illustrations. Brooke raised a brow at the paper and looked worried at Sam who just shrugged and kept on reading the paper.</p>
<p>"In Vitro Fertilization is a technique involving the fertilization of eggs by sperm in a test tube outside the body. This is probably the only way to continue the reproduction of your race, Miss Julian." Nicole gave Ms Glass an icy look as her classmates burst in to a giggle in unison.</p>
<p>"It was developed as a treatment for women who have blocked or badly damaged Fallopian tubes which prevents the egg and sperm from meeting. However, it is more and more often used by gay rights activists to prove that same sex couples certainly can breed as well. Mr. John, can you turn out the lights please."</p>
<p>Ms Glass rolled the movie, grabbed a bag of popcorns and sat her self to read 'malicious today magazine' without paying any attention to either the movie or her students.</p>
<p>For every minute the movie continued, Brooke got a deeper frown between her eyes. Her mouth was half opened and her eyes got wider and wider until finally, she practically clanged on to Sam who wasn't even looking at the movie. She was too busy trying to figure out where her notebook could be.</p>
<p>"What's wrong Brooke?" She whispered.</p>
<p>"I-I don't.... So much ovary and sperm and... I don't know." Brooke answered without taking her eyes of the screen.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. She would expect Carmen to react like this about this kind of movies, but not Brooke. And speaking of Carmen, Sam turned her head to see how Carmen was doing and saw a similar frown on her face. "You're not the only one with the frown Honey."</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke looked at Sam for the first time during the movie.</p>
<p>"Look around."</p>
<p>Brooke looked around in the classroom. She saw Carmen's almost disgusted expression on her face and Josh sitting next to her looked more clueless than anything else. Sitting behind them, Lily looked almost too interested and Emory Dick looked as clueless as Josh. Brooke turned her head to look at the seat behind them and she saw Nicole polishing her nails and looking very unmoved. Next to her, Harrison had the same expression as most of the students of male gender in that classroom: confused.</p>
<p>"Harrison looks a bit worried, don't you think?" Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"I think it comes as a bit of a shock to him that two girls can have a baby without any of them having to sleep with a boy."</p>
<p>"Can the love birds please keep quiet?" Bobbi Glass shouted from behind her magazine.</p>
<p>Sam and Brooke had to hold a hand over their mouths to keep the laughter to burst out. Sam and Brooke's newfound love was still a very sensitive subject for Harrison and the two used to make fun of that all the time.</p>
<p>As the movie ended, Ms Glass put unwillingly away her magazine and turned on the lights. The students squinted at the sudden strong light.</p>
<p>"Bottom Line kids! With the fees of the many specialists involved in this process, it will cost many thousands of Dollars with no guarantee of success. I think adoption is a better option. And if you two Mc-Irritating lovebirds are denied adoption, you can always ask Esposito to fight for your right to do so. Any questions?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry flung her arm in the air immediately, nodding enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Bobbi Glass sighed. She was hoping to get rid of the kids as soon as possible to continue reading the article in malicious today magazine. "What is it Cherry?"</p>
<p>"Ah have a question, miss Glass, sir."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Ah was wonderin'; is it possible ta reproduct without havin' ta go through the customary constituents of repruduction, without in vitro fertilization bein' in the picture?"</p>
<p>"You mean virgin birth? No that is not possible as far as we know. Any other... Yes Cherry?" Ms Glass was getting impatient as Mary Cherry threw her arm in the air again.</p>
<p>"Mah cousin Mary-Lou ones had an experience with virgin birth. Only, the strangest thing happened after nine moths. Her stomach just sunk in and the baby had disappeared! We figured the devil took it!" Mary Cherry looked around the classroom with her eyes wide and her arms stretched out to her sides, while her classmates looked at her with their brows raised.</p>
<p>"I think what your cousin Mary-Lou experienced is a feign pregnancy, whitch means that one thinks she is pregnant as the body starts to show sign of pregnancy, though she is actually not. This is sometimes caused by mental illness or other psyshic stress. I do not think the devil took her child, Cherry. Or did you, miss Julian?"</p>
<p>Nicole offered her teacher a sarcastic smile and continued polishing her nails while Mary Cherry looked puzzled at Nicole, with her head crooked to the side.</p>
<p>"Did ya steal mah cousin Mary-Lou's baby, Nic?"</p>
<p>"I know using your brain is not one of your best abilities Mary Cherry, but you can't actually believe that I would steal your stupid cousin's stupid non-existing baby?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry nod rapidly and Nicole sighed. "I did not steal a baby Mary Cherry. It was just a mocking remark claw made referring to me being evil."</p>
<p>"That is right Miss Julian. You are indeed the spawn of Satan, if not Satan her self."</p>
<p>The bell rang and everybody got up to leave. Miss Glass did not even bother to give them any assignments. She was comfortable with just letting them all flunk her class.</p>
<p>"Is it just me or has Bobbi Glass just got more bitter and mean over the years?" Carmen asked Mary Cherry as they walked out.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 4: Talk About Wanting">
<p>Sam and Brooke were sitting in Sam's bed working on their history paper together and listening to music. Actually, Brooke was trying to work on her history paper while Sam was busy nibbling on the cheerleader's earlobe. Brooke tried to push Sam away gently pointing at her book. However, Sam didn't care for the blonde's indications. She kissed her neck, moving down to her shoulders and finally her collarbone. Brooke smiled as she felt her whole body soften at the touch of her girlfriend. When she felt a strong tingle starting deep inside her stomach moving down to her crotch, she reckoned it was time to stop before she was all lost in Pleasureville.</p>
<p>"Sam", she whined, "stop that! You know we have to get this done." The cheerleader realized she didn't sound so convincing since Sam continued kissing her, now slowly moving her hands over her tummy, giving her goose bumps in strange places.</p>
<p>Brooke put down the book and settled down resting on her elbows so she was lying face to face with the brunette.</p>
<p>"You know Sam, I've been thinking."</p>
<p>"Did it hurt?" Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"Ha-Ha really funny Sam. But seriously; I've been thinking about that in vitro fertilization thing."</p>
<p>"I thought it freaked you out."</p>
<p>"Yeah it did, sort of. It reminded me of that time I thought I was pregnant by Josh. I was so scared and confused and just wanted it all to go away. And now, I would do anything to have your baby."</p>
<p>"You want to have my baby?" Sam laughed not really believing what she just had heard.</p>
<p>Brooke frowned, confused. That last statement she had said without thinking. However, after further consideration, it made a whole lot of sense. Even if she knew that it was practically impossible for them two to breed, something inside her longed for it.</p>
<p>"Don't you think we are a bit too young to be thinking about kids Brooke?"</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged. "The fact that we are to women does not really make the reproducing part of our relationship very simple."</p>
<p>"Don't ya mean reproduct?" Sam asked mimicking Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"You know what I mean Sam. Don't you want to have kids some day?"</p>
<p>"I don't know Brooke..." Sam noticed that the blonde in front of her got a sad expression on her face. "I mean, sure I would. I just don't see a reason to be thinking about that right know. Besides, I would rather see us making our dreams come true; become something; see the world and learn some languages... before we start thinking about the kid thing."</p>
<p>"I guess you're right." The blonde sighed. "But I think biology is calling out my name."</p>
<p>Sam gave her a questioning look. "I mean that I feel the urge to have a baby Sam. I would just love to have a little miniature version of you running around calling me mommy." The blonde said dreamingly.</p>
<p>"Mac looks kinda like me when I was a baby..." Sam trailed off as she saw something interesting in the magazine lying on the bed.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. Clearly, Sam couldn't understand her and the sudden "touched-by-nature" feeling. On the other hand, maybe it wasn't nature. Maybe she wanted to have kids with Sam because she loved her more than life it self. That got Brooke a bit confused. Her whole life she had figured she would meet Mr. Right, marry him, have kids and live happily ever after. However, when she realized Sam was her Mr. Right, everything was turned up side down. She sometimes comfort her self by thinking that they at least didn't have to bother about eventually moving in together, since that bit had been taken care of even before they even got together romantically. This sometime was more a worry than a relief.</p>
<p>"Earth calling Brooke. Hello?" Brooke blinked and saw Sam looking at her with a stupid, yet so gorgeous grin on her face.</p>
<p>"Are you still here?" Sam teased.</p>
<p>"Shut up and kiss me you fool." Brooke whispered in a 50's drama queen style, gently pressing her body against the brunette's.</p>
<p>Sam did not hesitate to obey her girlfriend, kissing her passionately, slowly moving so Brooke finally was lying on top of her. As their kisses got more fiery and their breaths got more rapid and their hands just all over each other, Brooke (all dizzy from desire) fumbled with Sam's top for quite a while before Sam had to pull it of her self. Otherwise, the blonde had ripped the thing into small pieces.</p>
<p>Brooke stopped the kissing for a moment and looked at Sam's upper body. Her eyes traced the scars over the brunette's right chest, down to her ribs, ending at her tummy. She tried to figure out why Sam only had scars on the right side of her body, only to shake that though out of her head as it was killing the I-so-want-Sammy mood. The blonde placed feather light kisses following the line of scars up to Sam's chest. She was surprised Sam didn't whine and push her away. Usually, the brunette didn't appreciate when Brooke paid extra attention to the scars on her body.</p>
<p>As Brooke was kissing her way further up Sam's body in a voyage towards those pouty lips, she found her self face to face (well, kinda) with a small silver amulet with an even smaller light green stone in the middle. She stared at it for a moment before she looked up to meet Sam's questioning expression.</p>
<p>"What's this Sammy?" She asked pointing at the amulet.</p>
<p>"Oh I forgot to tell you!" The brunette replied cheerfully and sat her self up. "I got it from Lilly and Carmen today. They had been out shopping yesterday and found it at some antique shop. They said they had to buy it cause it was calling out my name."</p>
<p>"Aw, that so sweet."</p>
<p>"Actually, Carmen claims she literally heard the amulet call my name. But Lily just shrugged it of as a case of bad food poisoning."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled and brought Sam closer for a tender kiss, enjoying the feeling of the other girls' warm and soft lips. When their kisses got even fierier than last time, it was Sam's turn to brake the kissing, much to Brooke's disappointment.</p>
<p>"Princess, I do wish I could have your baby. I mean; if it was possible."</p>
<p>Brooke didn't comment on that, just brought the other girls as close as possible and continued with the heated kisses, caressing every inch of Sam's body with her hands. At that moment, she really wished she could make Sam's wishes come true. A little miracle never the less.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 5: What Goes In Must Come Out">
<p>"Sam, are you okay in there?" Brooke leaned against the bathroom door and heard something that sounded very similar to someone throwing their guts up.</p>
<p>Sam had run upstairs just as she had finished her breakfast holding a hand over her mouth with eyes big as tennis balls. The same thing had happened at dinner the day before. Jane had sent Brooke after Sam to find out what the heck was wrong with the brunette.</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Oh god..." Sam muttered from inside before she threw up again.</p>
<p>"Come on honey, Let me in!" Brooke sighed when she got no response other than some not so pleasant sounds coming from Sam.</p>
<p>Just when she was about to kick the bathroom door in, she remembered that she had a little "key-thingy" to open the door from outside. Brooke rushed to her room, got the key, fumbled with it for a second and exclaimed an 'A-ha!' of victory as she opened the door with a great smile. Sam on the other hand did not greet her with a great smile. She was lying on the floor next to the toilet looking un-great. Brooke helped the girl on the floor to her feet and led her to her bed.</p>
<p>"Okay Sam, what's up with you?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"What do I mean? So I didn't just hear you throw up your insides. Are you okay or should we pay a visit to the doctor?" </p>
<p>Sam had to think about that question before she answered. Yesterday at dinner, she had all of the sudden felt as all the food she just had eaten was rushing up her throat. Later on the evening, she had felt okay without any signs of illness. She had figured it must have been something in the food her body didn't like.</p>
<p>"I don't know Brooke. I feel fine now."</p>
<p>"Are you sure Sam? Cause you didn't sound so fine."</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes. "I'm fine Brooke, really. I'm just a bit stressed out. You know with mid terms like two weeks away and the school paper and... Shit!" Sam tossed her self out of bed heading for her desk where she rummaged around papers and books and old candy bar wrappers in search of the an article that had to be in that same day.</p>
<p>"What are you looking for?" Brooke asked, a bit scared of the sudden maniac reaction of the brunette.</p>
<p>"It's a... A thing... I have to..." Sam muttered as she looked around the now even messier mess.</p>
<p>"Ah! Here it is. Thank god! I almost saw my life flash before my eyes."</p>
<p>"Sam," The blonde approached Sam taking her hand, "I think you've got to wind down a little. You're gonna give your self a heart attack."</p>
<p>"Stop playing doctor Brooke. I'm fine and I'm not winding down until after mid terms."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Ah honestly don't know what ya talking about l'il Lily!</p>
<p>"Don't you play dumb with me Mary Cherry. I..."</p>
<p>"Ahm not playing." Mary Cherry interrupted the angry Latina holding a piece of paper in front of her face. "Ah am dumb. Momma Cherry even got me papers to prove it."</p>
<p>"And all this time, we though you were pretending." Nicole said sarcastically as she passed them by.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry gave Nicole her patented clueless expression with her head tilted to the side. "Ah though you knew I was dumb Nic."</p>
<p>Nicole turned around and had to mentally slap her self for saying anything to Mary Cherry. That girl didn't make it easy to be the "all new and improved Nicole Julian" as she would practically throw the opportunities to insult her right in the face of poor all new and improved Nicole.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of things that you are and are not Mary Cherry. And maybe you aren't the cleverest little Cherry on the tree but you do have qualities that make you..." Nicole had to think about something nice yet not all too mushy to say. "Special."</p>
<p>"Well thank ya Nic!" Mary Cherry exclaimed gleefully.</p>
<p>Nicole gave the southern girl a smile and turned to walk away. She had things she wanted to talk to Mary Cherry about, but not with Lily present. The blonde made a note to self to grab Mary Cherry next time she saw her alone.</p>
<p>"Hello! Mary Cherry? Are you in there?" Lily was enormously annoyed by the resent interruption in her interrogation of the ludicrous blonde in front of her.</p>
<p>"Well why are still standing there hun?"</p>
<p>"I was accusing you off sending me that gift basket Mary Cherry!"</p>
<p>"Ah told you l'il Lily; ah have absolutely nothin' ta do with it."</p>
<p>"I'm not stupid. Who else would send me a basket of meat delicacy and sign the card 'So ya'll don't starve' huh?"</p>
<p>"Hey guys what's up?" Sam entered the scene.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to make Mary Cherry to fess up!"</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, can I talk to you for a second?" Sam chose to ignore the present conversation between the two girls since she had more important things to take care of.</p>
<p>As the girls entered a conveniently empty Novak, Sam checked the stalls just in case some one was sneaking around eavesdropping on important conversations.</p>
<p>"Have you seen anybody with that little red note book of mine?"</p>
<p>"Ah do not believe so Sammy. Have ya lost it?"</p>
<p>"I think so... It's been gone for like a month now and it's freaking me out."</p>
<p>"Don't ya worry Sammy. As ya legitimate and officious source ah promise ta keep my eyes open for any beast of prey carrying around ya holy book of journalism."</p>
<p>"That's... great Mary Cherry. Just..." Sam trailed off and imagined Mary Cherry running around school with a dagger chasing people with red notebooks. And judging by Mary Cherry's past follies, that was a possible scenario.</p>
<p>"Just don't kill anybody okay?"</p>
<p>"Ya silly girl! Why would ah do anything like that?" Mary Cherry laughed gently elbowing Sam in the stomach.</p>
<p>Sam chose not to answer that since Brooke had told her that on career week, the computers had chosen serial killer as the career best suited for Mary Cherry. Instead, she gave the blonde an encouraging smile and left the Novak.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 6: Bran Flakes!">
<p>"Are you feeling better now Sammy?"</p>
<p>"As good as can be." Sam flashed her girlfriend her best smile only to get Brooke off her back. The blonde had been nagging about the throwing up all day asking if she was okay every five minutes.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime and the girls and Lily were "enjoying" their school lunch and making small talk. Actually, Lily was doing all of the talking and the other two nodded and hummed in the right places. Lily was furious over the gift basket she was sure Mary Cherry had sent to her. Not only was she offended by the fact that she was sent part of dead animals to her house, the person who send it was clearly claiming that she was too skinny.</p>
<p>"I am not too skinny! Aren't I?"</p>
<p>"Uh... No! Of course not." The two other girls answered simultaneously.</p>
<p>After a while, Carmen joined their table complaining about some sophomore girls not liking her new routines.</p>
<p>"Isn't PMS just a bitch?" Carmen complained. "I've got such a craving for bran flakes and I don't even know why. I just want to stuff my self with a whole box of dry cereal."</p>
<p>"That is SO disgusting Carmen." Sam said making a face and feeling something very strange going on in her stomach.</p>
<p>"Sam, I though you liked dry cereals. You always stuff yourself with rice krispies in the mornings and..."</p>
<p>Sam storming off with her hands covering her mouth interrupted Brooke mid sentence. She made a straight line towards the toilets knocking over several sophomore kids. The girls around the table sat silent for a while exchanging concerned looks.</p>
<p>"What's up with Sam?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." Brooke sighed. "She's been like this since yesterday. All of the sudden she runs up to throw up. Oh God! You don't think she has some strange eating disorder, do you?"</p>
<p>"Aren't eating disorders usually a little more discrete than storming off from a crowded cafeteria holding your hands over your mouth?" Carmen asked looking at the direction Sam had gone.</p>
<p>"Maybe she's got the stomach flue." Lily offered.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't she be all fevery and sweaty and weak in that case?"</p>
<p>"Maybe she's allergic to something in the food?" Lily suggested poking at Sam's food.</p>
<p>"Here she comes!" Brooke spoke up for the first during Lily and Carmen's game of "what makes Sammy vomit."</p>
<p>Sam slowly walked towards her table holding one hand over her stomach and the other over her forehead. She had just experience the feeling of throwing up more amounts of fluid than she had consumed that day. She had never in her life felt like this. It didn't resemble either stomach flue nor food poisoning or any other inconvenience her stomach had experienced. However, the last thing she wanted was to see a doctor. After all the time in hospital and the regular examinations after the accident, she would rather agree to another make over done by Mary Cherry. Despite the fact that Mary Cherry's last make over had ended up with her almost burning Sam's hair off.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Brooke asked worriedly as the brunette approached the table.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Just some post-disgorge dizziness, that's all."</p>
<p>Sam slowly sat down in front of Brooke as three sets of eyes followed her every move.</p>
<p>"You aren't all fevery, are you?" Carmen asked her.</p>
<p>"Not that I know of."</p>
<p>"Is there something in the food that made you sick? Like that thing that is supposed to be a sausage? Lily asked poking around Sam's plate again.</p>
<p>"No!" Sam slapped Lily's hand away. "I think it's ulcer."</p>
<p>"That's one violent ulcer you've got!" Carmen chuckled.</p>
<p>"You can always try to sue the school for food poisoning." Emory Dick all of the sudden appeared from behind Lily.</p>
<p>Lily turned around and hit him over the head with a straw. "Haven't your parents taught you that it is rude to listen to other peoples conversations?"</p>
<p>"I do believe they have. However, that does not keep me from doing it now." Emory said in his usual haughty kind of way.</p>
<p>Carmen glared at him. "Emory, make like an egg and scramble."</p>
<p>"Point taken." He disappeared only to reappear one second later. "Think about it Sam."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I will, Emory." Sam said kindly only to prevent Carmen from hitting him with the apple she held in her hand.</p>
<p>"I have so not forgiven him over that distended anus thing."</p>
<p>"Carm, that happened like two years ago."</p>
<p>"But do you know that people still comment on it?"</p>
<p>The other three girls burst in to laughter but Carmen just shrugged, not able to see the funny side of the whole thing. That distended anus thing made her the victim of many crude jokes.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you are okay now Sammy?" Brooke took Sam's hand in hers.</p>
<p>"Yes! Jesus, Brooke. Obsessive much? You have to stop asking if I am okay every five minutes! I might have to slap you if you ask again."</p>
<p>"But I'm worried Sam. What if there's something wrong with you? Maybe something to do with the accident?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry Brooke." Sam tried to give the blonde her best reassuring smile. "Apart from the scars and sporadic stiffness in my right leg, I'm fine. Just don't talk about cereals. Or wheat, rye, barley and oats."</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other, then at Sam, then back at each other. Brooke hoped Sam was only joking or had some damn good explanation. Otherwise, she would have to take Sam to the hospital to get her head checked for any side effects from that head trauma.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me like that? It was Carmen's cereal talk that got me all sick."</p>
<p>"You got sick cause I am PMSing?"</p>
<p>"No, I got sick cause you were talking about cereals." Sam felt her stomach starting to turn again and wasn't very keen on running to the toilets again. "Let's change the subject, please."</p>
<p>"Nah, wait. First you've got to explain the cereal thing." Lily was really interested in what Sam had to say. Little did she know, Sam was getting a free ticket to puke-land again.</p>
<p>"If I tell you I might have to..."</p>
<p>"Kill you?" Carmen asked amused.</p>
<p>"No, throw up."</p>
<p>"Sam, come on!" Brooke whined pulling at Sam's arm.</p>
<p>"You guys, not changing the subject here." Sam said making a face. The other girls gave her a dirty look and Sam realized they were not letting her of the hook. "Okay, every time I think about or eat cereals I get this really odd feeling in my stomach, and then my insides start racing up my throat."</p>
<p>Carmen and Lily made disgusted faces as if Sam had told them she dirt. Brooke looked at Sam as if she had told her she was giving up journalism for cheerleading. I.e. Brooke was bewildered.</p>
<p>"Changing the subject now," Sam broke the silence, "how's mid terms going?"</p>
<p>Carmen was the first one to react. "Oh! I'm... Not so good."</p>
<p>Lily was second. "It would be going better if Ms Glass had given us a better study plan other than "Study your notes." Is it legal to that cruel towards your students?"</p>
<p>"It must me in this state." Carmen muttered standing up. "I'll se you guys later."</p>
<p>"See you Carm." Sam said gathering her things to leave. "I have to take care of some things before next period."</p>
<p>"You promise to get that ulcer checked?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes. She really appreciated her friends concerns. However, this time it was more an aggravation than appreciated.</p>
<p>"I promise." Such a lie, Sam thought. She bent down to kiss Brooke (who had been awfully quite during lunch period) on the top of her head. "I'll see you later princess."</p>
<p>"See ya Sam."</p>
<p>Lily took a minute to contemplate Brooke. The blonde looked perplexed and bothered and just really not like the blazing, bubbly teen she should look like. Lily reckoned it was time for some damage control.</p>
<p>"Brooke? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and clutched her head in her hands, resting her elbows on the table. "She so damn stubborn! I know she won't go to the doctor until that damn ulcer knocks her out. What if it isn't ulcer? What if she's walking around with some strange, deadly disease?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, breath. Relax. I'm sure Sam will be okay. I'll talk to her. And if she doesn't listen to me; we can get Carmen to help us lure her to the health center."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. She didn't like the idea of having to force Sam to see a doctor bearing in mind everything the brunette had gone through the last six moths. However, she would die from anxiety if Sam continued like that.</p>
<p>"I think we need to start working on a plan right away."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 7: Fool If You Think It's Over">
<p>Brooke was waiting impatiently in the kitchen of the palace, casually stuffing her self with grapes while reading a magazine. Lily and Carmen where coming over to lure Sam over to the health center for a routine check. Sam on the other hand thought they were going to sign up as blood donors. Lily had managed to convince her with some bogus lie she never though Sam would buy.</p>
<p>Brooke felt a little bad and a little afraid. Bad because she felt it was somewhat wrong to have to force Sam in to something she obviously didn't want, and afraid cause Sam had been PMSing big time the past few days and she was to afraid of Sam's eventually violent reaction.</p>
<p>"Hey Brooke." Lily and Carmen entered the palace kitchen.</p>
<p>"Hi guys." Brooke looked up from the magazine trying to smile but the smile faded in to a frown.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?" Lily asked sitting her self down in front of the Blonde.</p>
<p>"I don't know. It's just that I don't know if I should be lying to Sam. After everything all the lying and deceiving each other ..." Brooke put her head on the table and started to cry.</p>
<p>Carmen and Lily exchanged worried looks for a while not knowing what to do with the crying cheerleader who was now gently bumping her head on the table.</p>
<p>"Uhm... Brooke?" Carmen carefully stroke Brooke's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry guys. I need a lady time." Brooke said into the table.</p>
<p>Both brunettes mouthed 'oh' and Lily took out a lady time from her bag.</p>
<p>"I keep them in my bag. You never know when they come in handy." Lily smiled.</p>
<p>After wiping her tears away and smiling awkwardly at the awkwardly smiling brunettes, Brooke started pacing around the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Don't you think we should just tell Sam what's going on? You know, we've got a strict honesty policy in this family... and I think Sam might kill me. She's really into this honesty thing."</p>
<p>"Brooke. Do you know what Sam told me when I tried to talk to her yesterday?" Brooke shook her head. "She told me to back off and go and save a monkey instead." Both Carmen and Brooke burst in to laughter.</p>
<p>"I would've kicked her ass if I didn't know she was PMSing." The little brunette continued. "That's why we have to do this. It feels kinda stupid but Sam can be so damn stubborn when she wants to." The other two girls nod in agreement. "It's been two weeks now and am I the only one that have noticed how much weight she's lost?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Let's roll!" Sam shouted coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. "Let's get this over with."</p>
<p>"Hey Lily, I'm so glad we're doing this. It feels good, you know; giving something back to the gentle people who saved my life." Lily couldn't discern if it was genuine joy or sarcasm in Sam's voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, isn't that great." Lily stated flatly. The whole plan was feeling more and more stupid for every minute.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Four girls were sitting quietly reading magazines in the waiting room of the local health center. Brooke was anxiously flipping trough the pages without giving them much attention. She was occupied trying to come up with something to say to Sam. Sitting beside her, was Sam in the middle of a mental argument with the article she was reading. She wished someone could smack the journalist who wrote it. She wished she could smack him. Hard. Maybe even kill him. When those thoughts had reached her head, she decided to flip the page before something bad happened.</p>
<p>"Samantha McPherson?" An old man in a white robe called out, looking at some papers in his hands.</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, that's me." Sam said, slowly standing up looking confused.</p>
<p>"Come this way miss." The doctor indicated the direction of his office with his arm.</p>
<p>Sam turned around to be met by three nervous smiles. "Aren't you guys coming or what?"</p>
<p>"I'll go with you Sam." Brooke stood up.</p>
<p>"I thought they were going to call us in together."</p>
<p>"Well... Uhm... honey, were sort of lied about the blood donor thing." Brooke said in a low voice keeping a safe distance from the brunette.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I booked you an appointment with the doctor to get that ulcer checked."</p>
<p>"Nuh-uh!" Sam exclaimed pouting and crossing her arms around her chest.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. The doctor was observing them with his brow raised. The blonde gave him a sheepish smile and grabbed a hold on Sam's arm.</p>
<p>"Come on, this way." Brooke said between clenched teeth showing the brunette behind the doctor.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam sat on a chair while the doctor was taking a blood sample. Sam had no idea what it was for and she didn't even bother to ask. She just wanted to get it over with.</p>
<p>"When did you have your last period?"</p>
<p>"I'm... Well it's supposed to come any day now." Sam answered confused.</p>
<p>The doctor hummed and nod sitting him self at his desk tapping on his computer before he looked up at Sam making her nervous with those absent stares.</p>
<p>"I am going to prescribe Nexium for you. It will gradually ease the retching. You take one pill each day for fourteen days and if the symptoms remain after 14 days, you give me a call. And don't forget to call in a few days to get the results from the pregnancy test."</p>
<p>"Pardon?" Sam asked in a pitch much higher than her usual voice while taking the pills from the doctor.</p>
<p>"I said that you have to..."</p>
<p>"Yeah... I-I heard what you said." Sam interrupted the doctor.</p>
<p>"It's just that I have never... I mean I-I don't do... I mean I don't think I-I-I..."</p>
<p>"Something wrong?"</p>
<p>Sam stopped stuttering and stared at the doctor for a moment. She was so close to getting out of there and for some reason she just couldn't tell the doctor why there were no chance in hell she could be pregnant. Though it pissed her off that he just had assumed that was the cause of the illness. To prevent any inconvenience with the doctor. She just smiled, nod and left his office. She figured it would be better to just not bother about calling back.</p>
<p>When she came out Brooke, Lily and Carmen were sitting in the same chairs as before, looking more bored than they used to look in bio class.</p>
<p>"So?" Brooke asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"He gave me pills. I'll be okay." Sam replied in a surly tone of voice.</p>
<p>"That wasn't so bad, was it?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"You could have told me, I'm not a kid."</p>
<p>Lily rolled her eyes. "Yeah right Sam. I tried to talk to you yesterday and you told me to go and save a monkey instead."</p>
<p>Sam made no comments. She just stood in the middle of the waiting room pouting with her arms crossed around her chest. She was pissed off at her two friends and her girlfriend. Even though she felt a little silly standing there like a kid who had been refused candy.</p>
<p>"Oh get over it McPherson!" Brooke suddenly stood up. "I'll wait in the car. You can come out when you are done pouting."</p>
<p>Carmen followed the blonde giving Sam guilty smile on her way out. Lily reckoned it was time for what she was best at; damage control.</p>
<p>"Sam?" The pouty brunette didn't answer. She just pretended to be very interested in a poster hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>"Don't give me the silent treatment. Come on. I'm sorry. It was really dumb but you brought it on your self. If you hadn't said that monkey thing I might have let you in on our little secret."</p>
<p>"Not making it better Lily!" Sam said still grouchy.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's enough." Lily grabbed Sam's arm and started dragging her along towards the exit. "We can talk about this at home Miss pouty."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 8: Bah Humbug">
<p>Nicole Julian was standing in front of one of the mirrors in the Novak touching up her make up. She had a gut feeling Mary Cherry would turn up any second. She had seen her in the halls and spotted a serious need of a touch-up.</p>
<p>And she was right. Just a few seconds after Nicole was done touching up, Mary Cherry burst in to the Novak, looking quite nervous when she spotted Nicole. The Texan walked to the mirror next to Nicole and started applying lip-gloss in an awkward silence, shooting sideway glances at the shorter blonde next to her.</p>
<p>"Okay Nic. Why ya looking at me like that?"</p>
<p>Nicole shrugged, looking innocent. "I don't know what you are talking about Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry gave her a skeptical look before she continued with the lip-gloss, pouting for the mirror. After a few second, the blonde could not take more.</p>
<p>"You are drivin me crazy with those innocently observin, yet very frightenin looks ya givin me! Now tell me what's on that unscrupulous little heart of yours."</p>
<p>"I still don't know what you are talking about Mary Cherry. Gee, I've must have bumped my head really bad, huh?" Nicole said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Well ya have ta be careful where ya put your head." Mary Cherry tried her best to lighten the mood but her smile faded and she started to slowly recoil as two icy blue eyes where locked with hers. "I thought ya were new and improved Nic." Mary Cherry asked nervously.</p>
<p>"I am. That's why there are no automobiles involved in this little face off."</p>
<p>"Oh." Mary Cherry gulped. "That's great Nic. Don't wanna make road killing a habit, do we?"</p>
<p>Nicole snorted. "How about backstabbing, Mary Cherry? Is that something we want to make into a habit?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry shrugged gesticulating 'I don't know' with her hands, trying her best to look as innocent as possible.</p>
<p>"Okay Mary Cherry, I'll cut right to the chase." Nicole held up a little red notebook, Sam's little red notebook. "Recognize this?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry stood frozen in place with her mouth opened. She was perplexed beyond. That notebook had been gone almost two months now and she had forgetten she had promised Sam help her get it back. On the other hand, Nicole didn't look like the one she should be crossing. Mary Cherry considered the pros and cons of the two answerers she could give Nicole. She decided to stick with option number two; lying her ass off.</p>
<p>"Ah have never ever seen that pad before, Nic."</p>
<p>"Are you sure, Mary Cherry?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry nodded vigorously thinking she was now free of charges.</p>
<p>"Yeah hi, nice try hun. But you see, this is Sam McPherson's notebook." Nicole said mockingly.</p>
<p>"How do ya know it's Sam's notebook?"</p>
<p>"Please, stop acting as such a retard Mary Cherry. I know you're smarter than that. It says right here; Sam McPherson. For a regular Nancy Drew-wannabe, you think she would be a little more careful where she puts her things."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry looked around in the Novak. She couldn't run because Nicole was blocking her path to the door, she didn't know what to say because all her emergency lies were suddenly forgotten and running for a stall wouldn't improve her situation.</p>
<p>"The question is, Mary Cherry, why are you doing this?"</p>
<p>"Doing what Nic?" Mary Cherry had decided to plead innocence since playing dumb to save her ass was one of her specialties.</p>
<p>Nicole sighed. "Why are you playing Sam's little helper?"</p>
<p>"I'm only telling her things that are true..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that were true two years ago Mary Cherry." Nicole interrupted the Texan wrathfully making her flinch. "If you haven't noticed it, I am trying to change here. You know: one good deed everyday."</p>
<p>"Ah just wanted to be her friend. You know now that Sam and Brooke have made an unconventional commitment, ah thought it would be best to burry the hatchet." Mary Cherry gesticulated a burry of a hatchet with her hands that almost made Nicole laugh.</p>
<p>"You know there are better ways to make friends."</p>
<p>"There are?" Mary Cherry asked genuinely confused.</p>
<p>"Look, I know that in the old days when it was we (cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me of Kennedy high), against them (the socially challenged outcasts), we ruled with cruelty; lying, cheating, backstabbing, ridiculing others and so forth. However, I think it is time for a serious attitude change, Mary Cherry. The dawn of a new era." Nicole gesticulated at the sealing with her arm with dreamy eyes.</p>
<p>"You see," Nicole continued, "I have lost my best friend because of my ruthless and somewhat crazed behavior." Mary Cherry nod in agreement making Nicole arch an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"And now I am getting her back. Spam-free or not. It doesn't matter. Brooke is the one that matters to me."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry gave Nicole a smile full of empathy and put her hand on Nicole's shoulder. "That was just beautiful Nic!" She said on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>"Yeah, okay Mary Cherry, stop the sobbing. You're going to ruin my coat."</p>
<p>"But ah am touched." Mary Cherry wiped away her tears before her eyeliner was ruined. "Maybe now we can be like old times. Well, except for the barbarous behavior maybe."</p>
<p>Nicole raised a brow at Mary Cherry's choice of words but shrugged it off. Sometimes it was better to ignore the blonde's follies.</p>
<p>"I am going to talk to Sam about this... thing. And you Mary Cherry, just keep your mouth shut. Please."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry nodded enthusiastically clapping her hands together. This was the most exiting thing that had happened in months. It was almost feeling like those good old days.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 9: You Are In Serious McTrouble Young Lady!">
<p>Sam was sitting on Brooke's bed repeating the words 'this is not happening' over and over again in her head. She had serious problems thinking straight. The strangest thing had happened and she didn't have a clue what to do about it or what to think of it. She tried to pinch her self out of the assumed dream, but this was no dream.</p>
<p>It was 18 days after the visit at the doctors. She had taken the pills the doctor had prescribed and they did help, but only something. She could still not eat or think about cereals. And sometimes just the thought of orange juice just made her sick. Sam tried to hide it as much as possible from Brooke and the parentals by avoiding things that made her want to vomit.</p>
<p>15 days after the visit, one day after the pills had run out, Sam got an interesting phone call from one of the nurses at the health center. The nurse said that since Sam had failed to call back, she was calling Sam to tell her that she was pregnant. Of course, Sam didn't believe her. She just laughed and said that there must be some mistake cause there was no chance in hell she was pregnant. However, the nurse insisted that no mistake had been done. Since Sam insisted that there was no chance in hell she could be pregnant, the nurse booked her another appointment with the doctor the next day. She had took another blood test and got the results back later that day. It said the same thing; Sam was pregnant. At that time, Sam was getting pretty pissed off. She stormed off to the Womens clinic and took a blood test and a urine test. She was going to prove she was NOT pregnant. The next day she got the results back and, surprise surprise, Sam was pregnant. As soon as she got the results she went down to the Womens clinic again to talk to a nurse cause the whole thing was freaking her out. The nurse tried to calm down the somewhat crazed brunette and decided that they should do an Ultrasonography on her. That way, they could really prove if she was pregnant or not. Sam almost fell out of the bed when she saw what was inside her on the little screen. At first, it was a little messy but then the nurse pointed out a little head and something that could resemble a body (but looked more like a kidney bean). Sam felt panic taking over as she looked around for any hidden cameras or some funny guy jumping out saying "You are on candid camera!" But no one jumped out from nowhere. The nurse looked very sure of the thing. Sam was pregnant no doubt about that. And on top of it all, she was two months pregnant. Sam hadn't even thought about the fact that she had skipped two periods. Her menstruation cycle had not been her first priority the last couple of months.</p>
<p>After three blood tests, one urine test and one Ultrasonography, Sam still couldn't believe that she had a little kid inside her. And who could blame her? The only person she had ever had sex with was Brooke and she was pretty sure the blonde was not capable of such things as knocking her up. Then, the most hideous feeling took over her body. What if something had happened to her and she couldn't remember? What if someone had...? Sam panicked as those thought filled her head. She had to literally shake them of. Something inside her knew what had happened. She just had to drag it out of her messy head.</p>
<p>She was waiting for Brooke to come home from practice. She didn't have a clue about what she would say to Brooke but she figured she would be as understanding as always and help her out of that mess.</p>
<p>As her thoughts wondered off, she started to think about everything that had happened the last couple of months. Those issues with cereals started to make a whole lot of sense. She remembered when her mom was pregnant and couldn't stand various dishes and threw up almost every morning for months.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. A warm feeling spread through her body when she thought about the fact that she was pregnant. She could feel something inside her that was warm and fuzzy that had never been there before. She thought about Brooke and how much she loved her and that maybe having a kid together wasn't such a bad thing after all. And then, she got up from bed as if something had stung her ass. Words and pictures flashed before her eyes at 1000 words/second. Suddenly, everything was crystal clear. Just like that. She realized, she was pregnant and Brooke was the... Mother? Father? Fother? Mather? Smother? Heather? Weather? Something like that. Sam couldn't completely figure it out but it made so much sense in a very freaky and out of this world kind of way. It had to be magic. And what had caused it? Sam looked around her room and saw the little amulet she'd got from Carmen and Lily. She picked it up, looked at it, and she was sure that the amulet was the cause of it all. It was like that amulet made Sam forget everything about a little thing called commonsense.</p>
<p>At that moment, Brooke had come home. Sam heard her coming up the stairs and coming down the hall. The footsteps stopped outside the bedroom and at the door stood a smiling Brooke looking beautiful as always.</p>
<p>"Hey Babe. What's up?"</p>
<p>"Hey princess!" Sam happily embraced the blonde.</p>
<p>"Well aren't we a little ray of sunshine today." Brooke laughed giving Sam another hug.</p>
<p>"I've got news, but I don't know how you are going to take this..."</p>
<p>"Something wrong Sammy?" Brooke immediately turned in to worried-mode.</p>
<p>"I don't know if wrong is the right word to describe this, but something's definitely up." Sam took the blonde who now was in full worried-mode by the hand and led her to the bed. "I think you better sit down."</p>
<p>Sam started to tell the whole story of the three blood tests and one urine test. She showed her the papers she'd got from the Womens clinic and copies of the ultrasound scan. Brooke started to laugh like Sam did the first time the nurse called her.</p>
<p>"Ha-ha really funny Sam. April fool's day is in two months. I don't know why you go through so much trouble just to play a little joke on me. I'm not buying this." She took the ultrasound scans and looked at them closer. "What are these? Jane's scans?"</p>
<p>"No Brooke, they're mine." Sam whispered.</p>
<p>"Cut it out Sam! You are not fooling me." Brooke's smile faded slowly as she saw that the brunette in front of her was doing the opposite of smiling.</p>
<p>"Brooke this is not a joke. I am serious. I've spent the last three days running between different places trying to prove that I am not pregnant. I don't know how, but I am... pregnant"</p>
<p>Brooke stared at Sam with her mouth opened for quite a while. Almost too long for Sam. She knew that what she just had said sounded stupid and judging from the look on Brooke's face, she was not happy about the news. And Sam was right. Brooke tried to gather her mind that had wondered off to another dimension. She could tell Sam was telling the truth. Nevertheless, that could only mean one thing; Sam had cheated on her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean you don't know how?" Brooke asked her snapping out of the paralyze. "Sam, I know you are well aware of the birds and the bees."</p>
<p>"I don't know Brooke!" Sam snapped. "You are the only one I've ever had sex with, you know that!"</p>
<p>"Well apparently not." Brooke said crossing her arms around her chest. She was blooming out into full combat-mode.</p>
<p>"What are you saying Brooke? That I cheated on you?" Brooke gave her a 'DUUH STUPID!' kinda look and Sam felt stupid indeed. Telling your girlfriend that you are pregnant and then getting pissed because she thinks you have cheated isn't the most logic thing to do. On the other hand, nothing in this odd situation was very logic.</p>
<p>"Sam, what the hell do you want me to believe, huh? My girlfriend tells me she's pregnant and though I lack the essential attributes to impregnate her, she actually wants me to believe she has not slept with anybody but me. Puh-lease." Brooke snorted.</p>
<p>Sam didn't know what to say. Everything she had planned to say felt all of the sudden useless. She couldn't even look Brooke in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to say Brooke. I'm telling you the truth. I'd hoped you would believe me..."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Brooke exploded making Sam flinch. "Did you hit your head on the way home or what? I know you're not so stupid to actually think that I would believe you're telling me the truth."</p>
<p>"Tell me Sam, who was it? George? Some random guy whose name you don't even know? Tell me!"</p>
<p>"Please Brooke..."</p>
<p>"Or was it Harrison? Couldn't resist the temptation Sam? You always had a thing for my left over, didn't you, Sammy?" Brooke's voice was full of rage.</p>
<p>That hit Sam like a big rock against her chest. She couldn't hold back the tears anymore. "Stop it Brooke! You don't know what you're talking about..."</p>
<p>"Then tell me Sam! Enlighten me!"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you if you stop interrupting me!" Sam wiped away the tears and took a deep breath. "Look, I have not slept with anybody but you. I know it sounds weird, but you just have to believe me. Don't you trust me?"</p>
<p>"I used to trust you Sam, but not anymore. After everything we've gone through... and... and you do something like this? I can't believe this shit!"</p>
<p>"You have to listen to me..."</p>
<p>"No, I am not gonna listening to you." Brooke grabbed a hold of Sam's arm and started pushing her towards the door. Sam tried her best to get out her grip but Brooke was much stronger than her.</p>
<p>"Get out Sam! When you are ready to tell me what happened and stand up for what you have done, then we talk. But right now I want you to get the hell out of my room!" Brooke managed to shove Sam outside and closed the door with a loud bang.</p>
<p>Sam sat outside the door listening to Brooke crying while crying herself. She tried to get Brooke to talk to her several times but the blonde wouldn't respond to her pleads. After a while, the parentals came home and Brooke never came down to dinner that evening.</p>

<chapter title="Part 10: Conversation With Dumb People">
<p>It was the day after the big fight with Brooke and Sam was nervously walking through the crowded halls of Kennedy High in search of the tall blonde.</p>
<p>Sam searched every corner of the school but still no signs of Brooke. The hole in her stomach had turned into the Grand Canyon. If she didn't find Brooke soon she would pass out from pure agony. As she rounded the corner heading towards the Novak, she bumped in to Carmen and Lily.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Sam said without noticing it was her friends she'd bumped in to.</p>
<p>Lily managed to grab a hold on Sam's arm before she got away from them. "Sam?"</p>
<p>Sam turned around seeing Lily and Carmen looking at her with questioning looks.</p>
<p>"Oh, It's you guys. Sorry, I didn't see you." Sam said looking both ways down the hall like a maniac.</p>
<p>"Are you okay Sam?" Carmen asked trying to get the brunette's attention.</p>
<p>"I don't... It's... We... Me and Brooke kinda...."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Me and Brooke had a fight yesterday."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's why Brooke was acting so strange when we bumped into her in the Novak." Carmen said.</p>
<p>"W-w-what when?" Sam asked with eyes that looked like they were going to pop out of their sockets any second.</p>
<p>"Just a couple of minutes ago..." Lily didn't have the chance to finish her sentence before Sam was nothing but a dash on the way to the Novak, much like Flash Gordon.</p>
<p>Lily and Carmen looked at each other shrugging and headed for the Novak in a slower pace.</p>
<p>When they entered the Novak, they found Sam sitting on the settee in the middle of the Novak crying her eyes out. It was odd for the two brunettes to see Sam like that. She rarely showed emotions like that, especially not in school.</p>
<p>The brunettes sat them selves down with Sam. Carmen put her arm around her and Sam buried her face in Carmen's shoulder. Lily made an icky face when she saw Sam's snot all over Carmen's blouse.</p>
<p>"Why were you guys fighting?" Lily asked, rather surprised. This was the first time there had been reports of any fighting in the six months Sam and Brooke had been together. Lily figured there would never be any major fighting between those two cause they were one of those lucky couples that are etch others perfect match.</p>
<p>"Yhmphmpm umphmphmp" Sam said into Carmen's shoulder.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Uhm, Sam, you're gonna choke on my shoulder." Carmen said gently removing Sam from her shoulder.</p>
<p>Sam wiped away the tears from her eyes and cleared her throat. "I said you would never understand."</p>
<p>"At least we could try." Carmen gave the brunette an encouraging smile.</p>
<p>"It can't that bad... can it?"</p>
<p>"It's so bad."</p>
<p>"Spill it Sam."</p>
<p>"Okay, but do you promise to hear me out before you freak out?"</p>
<p>Both brunettes nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>Sam took a deep breath and stood up. She tried to figure out a smooth way to lay it all down to friends. However, she realized there was no smooth way to explain this. If she were lucky, Lily and Carmen would be more understanding and maybe even believe her.</p>
<p>"Okay; I am pregnant, Brooke did it but she thinks I've cheated on her which I haven't."</p>
<p>"Say what?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed. "I'm pregnant."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed again "I. Am. Pregnant."</p>
<p>Both brunettes in front of Sam stared at her with their jaws opened wide. A long awkward silence followed. Well, at least it was awkward for Sam. Lily and Carmen were not moving nor talking. Luckily enough, Carmen broke the silence with a hysterical chuckle followed by Lily's girly giggles. But the room was yet again filled with an awkward silence when both brunettes on the settee noticed Sam's new expression. She was leaning against the sinks with her arms around her chest pouting and rolling her eyes. They recognized that face. Sam was serious, this wasn't even funny.</p>
<p>"Are you serious Sam?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"But how... I mean... Brooke is... you are... How?" Carmen was obviously the most confused brunette in that room.</p>
<p>"I don't know." Sam was very serious now. It was her only defense.</p>
<p>"But you're both..." Carmen stopped her self mid-sentence and stared at Sam with her mouth opened and her eyes wide. "OMG... OMG... OMG." Was the only thing she managed to say.</p>
<p>"What? What?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me Brooke is actually a... man!"</p>
<p>Now it was Sam's turn to laugh. She was laughing so hard her stomach started to ache.</p>
<p>"No! She's not a man."</p>
<p>"Then how come you are pregnant? Are you sure Sam? Have you..."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes Lily! I am sure, 100% sure. I've done all the tests, I AM SURE!" Sam said throwing her arms up in the air.</p>
<p>"I-I-I'm not following you Sam." Said Carmen and Lily nod in agreement.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Sam, are you ok? Have you eaten something from your closet again?"</p>
<p>"No!" The two clueless brunettes were really getting on Sam's last nerves. She never expected them to react so stupidly. She took out the papers from the last pregnancy test and handed it to Lily. "Read."</p>
<p>Lily read the paper and handed it to Carmen. When she was finished reading it both girls started first at each other and at Sam.</p>
<p>"Okay, who's the father Sam?" Lily asked standing up.</p>
<p>"It's Brooke."</p>
<p>"Seriously Sam!"</p>
<p>"I am serious!"</p>
<p>"Ugh, come on! You know that's impossible!"</p>
<p>"It's not!"</p>
<p>"Sam, get a grip! You know you can trust us, come on! Who's the father? Harrison?"</p>
<p>"OMG! Lily! Why does everybody automatically assume I've slept with Harrison? You of all people know I never had feeling for Harrison..."</p>
<p>"I don't ... Okay I'm sorry. Just tell us."</p>
<p>"You know what Lily?" Carmen managed to say after a couple of seconds of silently watching the conversation between Lily and Sam like a game of tennis. "I don't care who the father is, I don't think that's important. What's important is that we have to be there for Sam in times of need and/or crisis no matter what. I know I wasn't around that much after the accident and the whole thing with Brooke, but I've told you I'm sorry and that I wish I was. This time I'm 100% with you Sam."</p>
<p>A great big shiny smile appeared on Sam's face. She hadn't felt this happy in weeks. The only thing that could really make her day was the support from the people she loved. If only Brooke could be this supportive, it would be heaven.</p>
<p>Lily remembered the lyrics from that Placebo song... "A friend in need's a friend indeed" and decided that she had to support Sam on this one.</p>
<p>"I'm withya Sam." Lily said giving Sam a hug. "But you know this whole 'Brooke is my baby's daddy' thing is kinda strange."</p>
<p>Sam just had to laugh. Indeed this was a weird situation but Carmen and Lily hade given her new hope. All of the sudden it didn't feel so hopeless with Brooke. She was sure she could win her back one way or the other. That's when she decides she was going to prove that she was no loony and that she was too pregnant by Brooke.</p>
<p>"I think I know a way to prove to you all I'm not some crazed pregnant freak."</p>
<p>Both Carmen and Lily laughed. "Yeah sure Sam, but how're you gonna do that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll see. Sam said in her usual self-confident kinda way. "But you can't tell anybody about this, okay?" Both girls nod.</p>
<p>"Shit! We're late for class." Both Lily and Carmen headed for the door but Sam didn't move, she was too busy making genius plans.</p>
<p>"Aren't you coming Sam?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh, naah I'll catch up with you guys in the cafeteria."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it everybody's favorite teen journalist Sam McPherson?" Nicole said as she entered the Novak and saw Sam standing in front of the sinks.</p>
<p>"Go to hell Nicole."</p>
<p>"I've already been there, thank you." Nicole approached Sam.</p>
<p>"I'm actually glad I found you here Spam, we need to talk."</p>
<p>"I doubt we have anything to talk about."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I think we do."</p>
<p>Nicole took out Sam's notebook from her bag and held it up in front of the brunette's face. Sam looked at it for a while without really knowing what to do. Should she take it? "Go ahead, take it. It's yours. Be more careful next time."</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly. I've heard about you and Brookie."</p>
<p>"Wha..." Sam frowned then she sighed. "It's none of your business Nicole."</p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong Spam. You made it my business when you started to snoop around my business." Nicole said pointing at the notebook.</p>
<p>"It's not like this is news to anybody, Satan. Everybody knows you are a manipulating bitch. And the rest; well, it comes as no surprise after that sordid attempt at a drag racing career."</p>
<p>"I don't think you should be insulting me now that I am feeling so generous Spam. I came over here to offer you some help to win your loved one back."</p>
<p>"I don't need nor do I want your help. I'm not falling for your little tricks anymore. Your middle name is payback, I'll never forget that."</p>
<p>"I'm not playing you Spam, I just spent the last half hour with your heart broken girlfriend and she said she never wanted to see you again. And besides, I ran over you. You should be the one paying back." Sam looked at Nicole rather stumped. Her tone of voice was not at all familiar. She never thought the blonde could house real feelings in that ice cold heart of hers. However, Sam was softening up because of that desperate feeling inside of her.</p>
<p>"She said that? Where is she?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you that, I promised her. She doesn't know I came down here to talk to you."</p>
<p>"Okay, why are you doing this again?"</p>
<p>"Brookie is my best friend, I love her. I hate to ser her like this and for some odd reason I'm sure you're the only remedy. Anybody can see that, she loves you like crazy. In addition, you do love her, right?</p>
<p>Sam nod.</p>
<p>"And besides, wouldn't you help out a friend in need?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I am not evil." Sam said grinning.</p>
<p>"Okay Spam, do you want your girlfriend back or not?"</p>
<p>Sam had to think about that. Well not the part about getting her girlfriend to speak to her again, but the part where Nicole helps her. Nicole, the same person that more than six moths ago went a little loony and almost ran over Sam's one and only love. Ending up with Sam trying to get Brooke out of the way, Nicole heading right for the wall and taking Sam with her on the way. Brooke had told Sam to just ignore Nicole, not to bother about the past and concentrate on the future. However, that had been impossible for Sam. The last couple of moths (before the whole pregnancy/notebook disappearing thing) Sam had been obsessed with trying to find out why and how Nicole had managed to get away with what she'd done only with therapy and regular visits to the AA. But on second thought that sounded kind of a drag. And Sam had to admit that Nicole had been keeping an unusually low profile their senior year at Kennedy High. No 'Delusions of Grandeur', no bitching around trying to destroy Sam's life. Just... Cheerleading. That's the only thing Nicole had been up to. And she hadn't even tried to take the captain position away from Carmen. She had been happy with co captain. Apparently, everybody in the cheerleading squad pretended like nothing had happened, so why shouldn't Sam? The thought about loosing Brooke over this was just too much for Sam's poor heart, she could already feel it breaking into thousands of small pieces. She decided that, as weird and creepy it might've seemed, she would accept Nicole's help.</p>
<p>"Okay," Sam said, "I'm going home now and try to get a hold on someone from Sunnydale I..."</p>
<p>"From that hell hole?" Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I uh... have a plan."</p>
<p>"Need help?"</p>
<p>"Maybe... I need you to find Brooke, you know where she is?"</p>
<p>"Maybe..."</p>
<p>"Can you call me when you've found her?"</p>
<p>"You've got is Spam. But I can't promise she'll be happy to see you."</p>
<p>"I'll take care of that." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>Nicole headed for the door when she suddenly turned around.</p>
<p>"Oh, by the way Spam, are you pregnant?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Who's the father?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed. "Brooke."</p>
<p>"Spam, you do need help." Nicole said leaving the Novak with a big grin on her face.</p>

<chapter title="Part 12: Spam Scanning">
<p>Sam drove up to the palace in her car almost running over the neighbor's cat. She put the car in park and it sounded like the neighbor's cat was stuck somewhere under her car. However, it wasn't the cat, it was the car.</p>
<p>"Good old reliable." Sam said when she closed the door and one of the rear-view mirrors fell off. She just knew that was going to happen if she closed the door to hard. But she hadn't time to fix that. She was busy putting operation 'prove I'm not some crazy pregnant freak' into work.</p>
<p>She walked up to her room and rumbled around her desk in search of a telephone number. But it was impossible to find anything in that mess. Magazines, candy bar wrappers, old candy bars, a mouldy bowl of cereals, huge amounts of loose papers and somewhere under there her laptop, were lying on her desk making it look like a dumpster. When she realized she would never find the piece of paper she was looking for in that mess, she dug up her laptop and logged on to the whinyass.com community and searched through old messages from "D_the_slayer_wannabe" for her phone number.</p>
<p>"Yay!" She shrieked when she found what she was looking for.</p>
<p>She picked up the phone right away and dialed the number.</p>
<p>Someone, Sam presumed it was a female, who sounded kinda rude picked up the phone.</p>
<p>"Uhm, hi may I please speak to Dawn?"</p>
<p>"Okay, hold on. Dawn! It's for you!" The girl sighed.</p>
<p>"Hell-o-o!" Dawn sang.</p>
<p>"Hi, it's Sam from ..."</p>
<p>"Oh! Sam!" the girl squealed, "What's up?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, hi." Sam said feeling rather uncomfortable with the other girl's enthusiasm. "Uhm, I don't really know how to explain this but I need your help."</p>
<p>"With?"</p>
<p>"Remember you've told me all these weird stories about your weird sister and weird friends?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>"Well something really weird happened and I need your help to get me out of this mess."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"I'm pregnant."</p>
<p>"And the weird part is?"</p>
<p>"I have a girlfriend?"</p>
<p>"I still don't get the weird part."</p>
<p>"Well, my girlfriend impregnated me."</p>
<p>"Aaaah. Now I get it. You should've told me that from the start. I think this is a case for Willow."</p>
<p>"The Wiccan?"</p>
<p>"No, the tree." Dawn laughed but Sam didn't get it. And Dawn got that, so she cleared her throat and continued. "I told you about her."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, she's the one that's with that other Wiccan, right?"</p>
<p>"Exacto."</p>
<p>"You really think she could help me?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, oh you know what? You can come to Sunnydale this weekend."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Jupp, I'm sure! You and your girlfriend can stay here, I'm sure Willow and Tara can show you some nightly-disco-dancing-gay-action, if there is any here... You know Sunnydale is kind of a..."</p>
<p>"Uhm, yeah, sure." Sam interrupted Dawn before she gave her a full one-hour long re-view Sunnydale's non-existing nightlife. She had no time for that. She had more important things to do. Like finding her girlfriend. "I was thinking about bringing some friends along, but we can all just get a room somewhere..."</p>
<p>"Nah, you can all stay here, it's a big house."</p>
<p>"You sure?"</p>
<p>"Jupp."</p>
<p>"And your sister?"</p>
<p>"She won't mind, she's all busy with the slaying and bleached vampires, ya know."</p>
<p>"K, I'll call you Friday when we're on our way?"</p>
<p>"Great!"</p>
<p>"Great, bye then."</p>
<p>Sam hung up the phone with a big happy grin on her face. All she needed to do now was to find Brooke and talk to her and operation 'prove I'm not some crazy pregnant freak' was on a roll.</p>

<p>"Brookie... Don't you think that you should...?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"But maybe you should..."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Brookie..."</p>
<p>"Nooo!"</p>
<p>Scenario: Brooke, drunk as a skunk, sitting on a rock down by the beach and Nicole standing in front of her trying to get her to stand up.</p>
<p>"Nic!" Brooke wailed waving her arms in an attempt to hold her self up on the rock while avoiding Nicole's hand grabbing her arm.</p>
<p>"Honey, I doubt you sitting here drinking cheap wine is gonna make things better."</p>
<p>"What do you know?" Brooke asked frowning at Nicole. "I don't wanna see her ever again."</p>
<p>"You don't have to Brookie, just... Let's go home." Nicole failed yet again to grab Brooke as the blonde threatened to hit her with the bottle. "Come on Brooke! I'll drive you home."</p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. "Nic, you don't have a driver's license."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. Gee, I forgot. But someone's got to drive you home."</p>
<p>"Nope. I'll walk home."</p>
<p>"Oh please B. You couldn't get yourself down from this rock if your life depended on it."</p>
<p>"Could too!" Brooke said trying to stand up but got only half way up before she fell down on the rock again.</p>
<p>"Hon, you're sitting on seaweed ... and a dead fish," Nicole said making a disgusted face, "Now if that's not a reason for you to get your drunk ass home and sleep away the alcohol and the shame, I don't know what is."</p>
<p>"I'm sitting on seaweed?"</p>
<p>"And a dead fish."</p>
<p>"Eeew!" Brooke squealed standing up without falling back for the first time. "Look at my pants!"</p>
<p>"I think we should call Spam..."</p>
<p>"Don't call her that." Brooke snapped.</p>
<p>"Okay, gee, sorry B." Nicole rolled her eyes. "I think we should call Sam and ask her to pick you up."</p>
<p>"You really think so?"</p>
<p>"Well... Yeah I do. You two should talk, don't you think so B?"</p>
<p>"She's evil!" Brooke said with a dramatic voice as if she was talking about something horrible.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't use the word evil but she is kinda..." Brooke looked at Nicole with big puppy eyes and Nicole thought she was too cute to upset. "Uhm, no B. Sam's not evil. Let's call her, okay?"</p>
<p>"Call who?"</p>
<p>"Sam... Jesus Brooke! Drunk much?"</p>
<p>"This is my first bottle." Brooke said holding up the almost empty vine bottle to take another sip. Nicole was faster to react than Brooke was so she managed to swipe the bottle from Brooke's hand.</p>
<p>"Hey! Gimme that!"</p>
<p>"Okay, you've wailed enough young lady. Sit here while I call Sam."</p>
<p>"No! I don't want her to see me like this."</p>
<p>"I don't think Sam cares in what state you're in. She..."</p>
<p>"I'm in California."</p>
<p>"No, I mean... Arrgh!" Nicole was now losing patience. "Listen to me Brooke. I promised Sam I would find her and bring you to her. Or the other way around. Something like that."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why? Cause she wants to talk to you."</p>
<p>"No, I mean why do you want to help Sam? Is this one of your dirty tricks? Cause I won't let you screw me and Sam up Nic."</p>
<p>"No! You're my friend Brooke and I miss you and... I want to help you. I've changed. And I'm trying to prove that by helping you guys out."</p>
<p>"Okay... Call Sam."</p>
<p>30 minutes later and Sam was at the beach walking towards the place where Nicole and Brooke were waiting for her.</p>
<p>"Hey Nicole."</p>
<p>"Hey Sam."</p>
<p>"I, Uhm... Thank you."</p>
<p>"No problem." Nicole shrugged.</p>
<p>"No, I really mean it. Thank you. To be honest; I wasn't sure you'd come through."</p>
<p>"I told you I would help you, didn't I?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'm not exactly used to a helping Nicole."</p>
<p>"Well, you better get used to it."</p>
<p>"I can't promise anything. But I'll try." Sam smiled and reached out her hand. Nicole took her hand feeling a bit awkward shaking hands with one of her former enemies. Sam was feeling exactly the same way but realized she better let that go because Nicole did her a really big favor. She figured she'd come to the letting go part when she worked things out with Brooke.</p>
<p>"Where's Brooke?" Sam asked looking around not seeing the blonde.</p>
<p>"She's down there." Nicole pointed at a pier where a bunch of stoners were sitting under it around a fire and indeed Brooke was sitting there singing with them.</p>
<p>Sam laughed shaking her head. "Guess we better go and get her."</p>
<p>"You go ahead Sam. I should get back home." Nicole said looking at her watch.</p>
<p>"Okay. Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Bye Sam."</p>
<p>"Bye Nic." After a couple of seconds Sam remembered her Sunnydale plan and decided, she should invite Nicole on the trip. After all, Nicole was showing sides Sam never thought existed.</p>
<p>"Hey Nic!"</p>
<p>Nicole turned around surprised. "Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm planning on going to Sunnydale this weekend and sort this mess up..."</p>
<p>"To that hell hole?" Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. "Yes, to that hell hole. Do you wanna come with us?"</p>
<p>"Me?" Nicole looked even more surprised now. Spam inviting her along on a trip, now that didn't happen every day.</p>
<p>"Yes, you." Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"So; you, me and Brookie in the spam mobile?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly. Lilly and Carmen are coming too. And... Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>"Oh. All of us in your car?"</p>
<p>"I think we need a bigger car."</p>
<p>"I can take care of that. Take care of Brooke and I'll call you tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Oh, okay. Bye."</p>
<p>"Bye."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam sat down besides Brooke and placed her hand on the blonde's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Brooke said rather surprised. "Were you looking for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Cause last time we talked you threw me out of your room. And you didn't show up at school today. I got worried."</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. We should've talked about it. You wanna talk now?"</p>
<p>"There's not much to talk about Brooke. I already told you everything there is to say. Now it's up to you, whether you trust me or not."</p>
<p>"I wanna trust you Sam but... You don't expect me to believe I knocked you up?"</p>
<p>"Why not? It's the truth. Why would I lie about something like that? Besides, I never lie to you."</p>
<p>"I know Sam. It's just... I don't know." Brooke rested her head against Sam's shoulder. "My head hurts." She said pouting.</p>
<p>Sam smiled and placed a soft kiss on her cheek.</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll talk about this when you're not as fuddled as you are now." She sneered. "Let's get you home before mom and Mike comes home."</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Can you carry me to the car?"</p>
<p>"In your dreams blondie! Not get up and start walking."</p>
<p>"You are evil." Brooke mumbled while trying to stand up.</p>
<p>"Well, that's what you get for not believing in me." Sam said with a smug face.</p>

<chapter title="Part 14: She's Got A Ticket To The Road Trip From Hell">
<p>"Oh God." Brooke said holding her hands over her forehead. "My head!"</p>
<p>"You drank a whole bottle of wine all by yourself yesterday."</p>
<p>"Please, don't remind me."</p>
<p>"I brought you breakfast. That will make you feel better."</p>
<p>"Thanks. Hey, what time is it?"</p>
<p>"It's almost twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>"Please tell me it's twelve o'clock at night."</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>"OMG Sam! I'm later for school." Brooke said jumping out of the bed and knocking over the tray spilling the food all over the bed.</p>
<p>"Relax!" Sam said grabbing Brooke's arm. "I called the school. Told them you had tonsillitis and couldn't talk."</p>
<p>"Oh..." Brooke sat down on the bed again. "I ruined my breakfast." She said looking at the bed with a miserable look on her face.</p>
<p>"You wanna go on a trip?"</p>
<p>Brooke's face light up. "What kind of trip?"</p>
<p>"I thought we could visit my friend Dawn in Sunnydale."</p>
<p>"Yeah. But why do you wanna go to that hell hole?"</p>
<p>"Hey, why's everybody calling Sunnydale a hell hole?"</p>
<p>"Cause it's a small town where people die all the time maybe?"</p>
<p>"People die here too you know."</p>
<p>"But not as much as in Sunnydale."</p>
<p>"Anyway Brooke, I really think you should come along on this trip."</p>
<p>"And why is that?" Brooke raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Cause I am going to prove to you that you are the father/mother of this child."</p>
<p>"Sammy..."</p>
<p>"And don't say no, because you really don't have a choice. If you love me and want to be with me, you better come along."</p>
<p>"For your information, I was going to say I'd love to go with you."</p>
<p>"Oh... Well, good for you!"</p>
<p>"Sam, why are you acting weird?"</p>
<p>"I'm confused. I don't really know what to do with all this. You really hurt me Brooke, when you threw me out of your room and disappeared the next day. Then to find you drunk, singing songs with a bunch of wasted surfers, let's just say it hasn't exactly been the funniest day in my life. But I want to work things out with you. I want you to believe me Brooke."</p>
<p>"I want to believe you Sam. But I'm also confused. I just don't know what to believe anymore. I don't want to lose you. I love you so much."</p>
<p>Tears started running down the Blonde's cheeks and Sam put her arms around Brooke holding her really close. They sat like that, holding each other, for a long time until Brooke's stomach started to riot and she had to stuff herself with food.</p>

<p>"Are we there yet?"</p>
<p>"Nic, we've only been on the road for 10 minutes."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm bored already." Nicole sighed. "Why do I have to sit here in the back with these two, anyway?" Nicole shoot sideway glances at the two girls who were sitting on each of her sides; Carmen and Lily.</p>
<p>"Because Brookie was feeling a little bit nauseous and wanted to sit in the front with Sam." Said Mary Cherry who was driving the car.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry had picked the girls up in a lobster red mini-van with matching red fluffy interior. Brooke felt sick from the seats so she decided to ride in the front with Sam and Mary Cherry. Nicole had no choice but to sit in the back with Carmen and Lily since she was the last one to be picked up by the Mary Cherry-mobile and the two brunettes in the back insisted on window seats. No one in the back was actually happy with the seating arrangements. But when Nicole reminded herself why she was doing this, it felt a little bit better. She could go back to filing her nails instead of being annoyed by Lily frenetically chewing on carrots or Carmen's humming.</p>
<p>When Lily was done eating carrots, she had to find something else to entertain herself with. After a couple of minutes of trying to figure out whether Nicole had ever had a nose job or not, she caught Mary Cherry looking at her in the rear-view mirror. When Mary Cherry noticed Lily was looking at her she gave the brunette her best smile and a little wink. Lily smiled and winked back. And they kept doing that until Nicole looked up from filing her nails and noticed them looking at each other. The thought of Mary Cherry and Lily flirting was just too disturbing for Nicole so she decided to stall Mary Cherry for a while.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, where did you get this car?"</p>
<p>"It's momma Cherry's car." Mary Cherry answered not really giving Nicole much attention.</p>
<p>Nicole sighed. She wasn't interested in having an hour long conversation about a lobster red van with Mary Cherry if the blonde would continue flirting with Lily in the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, stop flirting with Lily."</p>
<p>Carmen was so shocked she spit out her soda all over Sam, Sam accedently knocked Brooke in the eye with her elbow, Lily almost choked on her flapjack and Mary Cherry almost drove into a car on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>"Now, was that really necessary?" Asked Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Don't ever do that again." Brooke said holding one hand over her eye and wiping away soda from Sam's face with the other.</p>
<p>"You almost killed Lily!" Carmen said.</p>
<p>"I was not flirting with Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>"Damn right l'il Lily!"</p>
<p>"Oh puh-lease! It's a wonder we...."</p>
<p>"Okay!" Brooke screamed. "All this drama is not good for the baby. So please; no more spitting soda over people or driving off the road."</p>
<p>"Whatever." Nicole pouted and crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Yaaay!" All the girls shouted at the same time when they passed the 'Welcome to Sunnydale' sign.</p>
<p>"Finally I can get away from Lily's hysterical chewing and Carmen humming show-tunes." Nicole said touching up her make-up in a small mirror.</p>
<p>"Hey Nic, I thought you said you are nice now." Sam said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"I've been sitting here with these two freaks and I haven't killed them yet. I think we can call that improvement."</p>
<p>Sam turned around with a chuckle while Carmen and Lily exchanged frightened looks. Carmen started to scratch at the door while nervously looking at Lily who was doing the same.</p>
<p>"Oh please," Nicole sighed, "like I would bother to kill you two and ruin my coat while doing it."</p>
<p>"Sam, do you know the address where Dawn lives?" Mary Cherry asked.</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Sam searched her pockets and gave the two blondes sitting with her a sheepish smile. "I kinda forgot it at home."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do now?"</p>
<p>"Maybe we could go in to a store and ask if anybody knows the Summers?"</p>
<p>"Okay hun, this town ain't that small." Nicole said.</p>
<p>"It's worth a try."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam and Lily stepped into a little kinda dark store that at first sight looked like a bookstore, but as they stepped in, it looked like a something-else. A girl was standing behind a counter looking utterly bored.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" She said.</p>
<p>"Okay, that what an interesting way to greet your costumers." Lily whispered.</p>
<p>"Uhm. Hi, I'm looking for someone named Dawn Summers, I wonder if you know her?"</p>
<p>"Know her? Hah! With my luck I'm stuck with that little brat forever."</p>
<p>"So you do know her?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, yes. Why? Are you coming to take her away?" The girl's face light up.</p>
<p>"Not really. We're here to visit her. Do you know where she lives?"</p>
<p>"Yes. How come you don't know where she lives, if you're here to visit her?"</p>
<p>"I forgot the address at home... and her phone number. So... Could you give us the address?"</p>
<p>"Sure. But if you're evil under disguise, you're in trouble."</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing." The girl wrote the address on a piece of paper and handed it to Sam.</p>
<p>"Okay... Thank you."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>

<chapter title="Part 15: It Takes Two To Boogie">
<p>Sam walked up to the house on the address that the girl in the shop gave her and rang the doorbell. After a couple of seconds, a girl with brown hair and leather pants opened the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Hi, is this the Summers house?"</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"I'm looking for Dawn Summers."</p>
<p>"Hold on." Said the girl and closed the door. Sam heard some shouting coming from inside and guessed it was the right house. She waved at the others to get out of the car.</p>
<p>A red haired, kinda tall (somewhat taller than Sam), kinda skinny, kinda happy shiny girl opened the door with the biggest smile Sam had seen since Brooke made her try on an Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka-dot Bikini.</p>
<p>The two girls greeted each other with a friendly hug and enthusiastic Hi's.</p>
<p>"Dawn, this is my girlfriend Brooke." Sam said when Brooke approached the door. The two shake hands and Sam later introduced the rest of the gang.</p>
<p>"Everybody, this is Faith." Dawn said when they stepped in to the house and found the brunette sitting in the kitchen. She gave them a half-hearted smile and a little wave.</p>
<p>"Okay... Let's go in to the other room instead." Dawn said shoving the girls out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"So, how was the trip?" Dawn asked while everybody was finding somewhere to sit. Sam and Brooke sat down next to each other on the sofa with Carmen, Mary Cherry sat down on a chair and when Lily was about to grab the chair beside her, Nicole gave her a little shove so poor Lily landed on top of Dawn.</p>
<p>"Hey! What was that for?" Lily wailed.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry Lily. I didn't see you."</p>
<p>"Uhm, the ride here was nice." Brooke answered Dawn's question.</p>
<p>"So your sister doesn't mind all us being here?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Nah, and if she doesn't like it I can just run away again."</p>
<p>Carmen broke out into one of her famous awkward chuckles because she thought Dawn was joking. But we all know, little Dawn wasn't joking.</p>
<p>"Hey, l'il Dawnie, where are we all going to sleep? Cause I ain't crashing on the floor like some common Joe." Mary Cherry said.</p>
<p>"Let's see... Three of you could sleep upstairs; two can sleep here on the couch and... One would have to sleep on the floor." Dawn gave her a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>"Well that ain't me."</p>
<p>"Me neither." Nicole said.</p>
<p>"Guys, we don't have to decide that now. Let's... talk about something else." Said Sam. "So, when do we get to meet Willow and her girlfriend?"</p>
<p>"I think they'll be here any minute now. They said they were going to swing buy the magic box to grab some stuff after school and then hurry back home to meet you guys."</p>
<p>"The magic box?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a magic store that our friend Giles owns. It's full with books and witchy stuff."</p>
<p>"Giles?"</p>
<p>"He's British. And kinda old actually. We only know him because he used to be Buffy's watcher."</p>
<p>"Is that like British for her sugar daddy?" Nicole asked and the others giggled in unison.</p>
<p>"Naah, he was more like the guy that made sure she didn't get in to much trouble."</p>
<p>"Oh." The girls said all at the same time.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes of semi-awkward small talk, Willow and her girlfriend Tara walked into the room.</p>
<p>"Hello!" She said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Hi." Everybody in the room answered.</p>
<p>"Hey, Will, this is Sam and her girlfriend Brooke."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you." The four ladies shake hands.</p>
<hr/>
<p>While Faith and Dawn were out on a tour around SunnyD with Carmen, Lily, Mary Cherry and Nicole, the others stayed at home to prepare a spell to find out whom the father of Sam's baby is.</p>
<p>"Okay, first of all, I need a lock of you hair Brooke." Willow said looking in one of her spell books. "And I also need a drop of your blood."</p>
<p>"Okay." Brooke said giving Sam a worried look.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous." Tara said in a low voice. "We just need it to put a spell on this little aniseed. If you want to you can go outside and get some air while we do this."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Hey, are you sure about his?" Sam asked Brooke.</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About all this. The spell that Willow and Tara are doing."</p>
<p>"I... I don't know. I mean, do you really think this will work?"</p>
<p>"I think so. Dawn said Willow has been doing spells and stuff like that for years now. And besides, the whole thing about me being pregnant by you is freaky enough. This has to work."</p>
<p>"And what if it doesn't?"</p>
<p>"Don't you trust me Brooke?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do."</p>
<p>"Then why do you say something like that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. You have to understand that this isn't easy for me to handle sweetie. What if I would all of the sudden get pregnant? Wouldn't you believe I'd slept with someone else before you would even think of the possibility that it might have been you?"</p>
<p>"Okay, you might me right on that one. But still, it hurts when you don't believe me."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry baby." Brooke said and gave Sam a kiss.</p>
<p>"Uhm... Sorry to interrupt you little smooch fest," Willow said standing at the front door, "But I need you guys to come in for a little while."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Tonight, before you go to sleep, you put the little aniseed in you belly button..." Willow said handing over the seed to Sam.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" Brooke asked surprised.</p>
<p>"Jupp, pretty much."</p>
<p>"So, how does this work?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Well, if the aniseed is still in your belly when you wake up, the baby is Brookes. But if the aniseed has fallen out, it's not."</p>
<p>"But what if I accidentally knock the seed out in my sleep?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that. This seed is enchanted remember? If it really is Brooke's baby it's gonna be there in the morning even if you take it out yourself."</p>
<p>"Wow, this is so cool." Sam smiled.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After the grand tour of Sunnydale, the girls headed back to the Summer's house for some pizza and fun, along with Anya and Xander who had joined the party as well. Lily and Mary Cherry were getting kinda cozy in the couch together while Nicole tried her best at getting in their way. But Anya, who was quire fascinated with the blonde, kept getting in her way. Sam and Willow were talking computer stuff, Lily and Tara were exchanging vegetarian recipes and Faith was trying to flirt with a rather flattered Brooke. After a while, Buffy came home and stuffed herself with the last pieces of pizza. In other words, it was quite a nice evening for the Santa Monica girls.</p>
<p>When it was time to go to bed, a little fight broke out over the bed arrangements. First of all, no one wanted to sleep on the floor. Second of all, Mary Cherry had asked Lily if she wanted to share the couch with her but both Carmen and Nicole insisted on sleeping on the couch too. The only ones who knew where to sleep were Sam and Brooke, who were going to take Dawn's bed. Mary Cherry suggested they should take it out side and wrestle over the beds, but Sam had a much better idea. To simply draw lots and leave it to the chance.</p>
<p>Again, everybody where happy except Nicole. Carmen had got the spare bed upstairs, Lily and Mary Cherry got the couch and Nicole had to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag. She tried to sneak out and get a room at the nearest Motel but both Buffy and Faith had stopped her, claiming that it was too dangerous for her to walk around by her self.</p>
<p>Upstairs, Sam and Brooke were in bed and Sam had the aniseed in her belly.</p>
<p>"So, are you ready?" Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"For tomorrow. It will be a very big day for the two of us."</p>
<p>"The three of us." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>Brooke placed a kiss on Sam's belly. "It doesn't matter what happens to this little seed. I love you so much Sammy. And I wanna be there for you and the baby, no matter what."</p>
<p>Sam stared at Brooke with her mouth opened.</p>
<p>"What? Did I say something wrong?"</p>
<p>"No Brooke. It's just... That was... I mean... That was probably the sweetest thing you ever said to me. You don't know how much that means to me."</p>
<p>"I think I do Sam. That came straight from the heart, I really meant it. I love that baby as much as I love you."</p>
<p>"Jesus Brooke, you're making me cry."</p>
<p>"And you are making me cry."</p>
<p>"Promise me you'll never leave me Brooke."</p>
<p>"I promise. I'll never ever leave you."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 16: Did I Do That?">
<p>"Hey, lovebirds wake up!" Nicole said throwing a pillow on Mary Cherry's head.</p>
<p>"What do you want Nicole?" Lily said throwing back the pillow at the blonde.</p>
<p>"Not that it's any of you concern Lily, but I'm quite worried about this."</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About the two of you spooning in the couch while I had to sleep on the floor not being able to even toss and turn in that small sleeping bag because of the disturbing though of you cuddling."</p>
<p>"We were not cuddling, Nicole."</p>
<p>"Yeah Nic. You were the one that said we had to make friends with outcasts."</p>
<p>"Yeah, Hi. Make friends, not make out."</p>
<p>"Cut it out, Nicole. You're just yellous because Mary Cherry asked me to sleep on the couch and not you."</p>
<p>"Hey, what's all the fuss about?" Carmen said entering the room in her pink Hello Kitty pajamas.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Nicole is just deluded." Lily answered.</p>
<p>"When do they serve breakfast in this place?" Mary Cherry asked.</p>
<p>"I guess if we want breakfast, we'll have to make it our selves."</p>
<p>The four girls walked in to the kitchen where they found Dawn and Tara making pancakes.</p>
<p>"Oh! Pancakes!"</p>
<p>"Hey, good morning guys. Did you sleep well?" Dawn asked.</p>
<p>All the girls nod except Nicole. "I am so getting a room tonight." She said.</p>
<p>"Nic, stop being so rude." Mary Cherry smiled giving Nicole a shove.</p>
<p>"I hope our pancakes can make up for the bad night." Tara said handing over a plate with pancakes and syrup with a smile.</p>
<p>Nicole shrugged, pouted, gave Mary Cherry an ugly face and finally sat her self down with the plate.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Good morning princess." Sam said kissing Brooke on the forehead.</p>
<p>"Good morning to you too." Brooke rubbed her eyes and turned around to face Sam. "So, have you checked?"</p>
<p>"My belly?"</p>
<p>Brooke nod.</p>
<p>"Nope. I wanted to wait for you to wake up."</p>
<p>"Wow. I'm impressed Sam. You've been up longer than me and haven't even peeped?"</p>
<p>"Well, actually: I woke up like five minutes ago and couldn't take it anymore. So I woke you up."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I thought so McPherson, you're such a Curious George. Hah, no pun intended."</p>
<p>"Ha-Ha, really funny Brooke. How about skipping the comedy act and check out my belly instead?"</p>
<p>"So you want me to do the honors?"</p>
<p>"Jupp."</p>
<p>"Okay, but before I do it. I just want you to remember what we talked about last night."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I remember Brooke."</p>
<p>"Okay, here it goes."</p>
<p>Brooke pulled down the covers and gently pulled up Sam's shirt but pulled it down again and looked at Sam who was staring up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes! My god Brooke, just look at it already!"</p>
<p>"Okay." Brooke laughed and finally looked into Sam's belly button.</p>
<p>"OMG... OMG Sam."</p>
<p>"What? Is it there?"</p>
<p>Brooke did not answer. She just stared at Sam's belly.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam sat herself up and looked down. "OMG!"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be a dad." Brooke said with a shaky voice. "We're gonna have a baby together."</p>
<p>Tears were running down Sam's cheeks and she threw herself on top of Brooke and kissed her like never before. There was no time to be shocked or confused. She just wanted to smooch with Brooke and never let go.</p>
<p>However, Brooke broke the kiss. "Hey, what are we going to name the baby?"</p>
<p>"Brooke." Sam wailed. "You're kinda ruining the moment here."</p>
<p>"Do you realize we're bringing a little mini-me to the world?"</p>
<p>"Uhm, yeah? How about Sam Jr?"</p>
<p>"I mean; There are a lot of important things to discuss Sam! Like how are we going to get the money to support this child? And you won't be able to go to college and I..."</p>
<p>"Brooke, relax. We have a lot of time to think about that. Let's just enjoy the good news and smooch some more?"</p>
<p>"Sam Jr?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Sam Jr?"</p>
<p>"How about Brooke Jr?"</p>
<p>"How about not?"</p>
