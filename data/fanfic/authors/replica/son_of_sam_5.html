<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 5: What Goes In Must Come Out -->

<p>"Sam, are you okay in there?" Brooke leaned against the bathroom door and heard something that sounded very similar to someone throwing their guts up.</p>
<p>Sam had run upstairs just as she had finished her breakfast holding a hand over her mouth with eyes big as tennis balls. The same thing had happened at dinner the day before. Jane had sent Brooke after Sam to find out what the heck was wrong with the brunette.</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Oh god..." Sam muttered from inside before she threw up again.</p>
<p>"Come on honey, Let me in!" Brooke sighed when she got no response other than some not so pleasant sounds coming from Sam.</p>
<p>Just when she was about to kick the bathroom door in, she remembered that she had a little "key-thingy" to open the door from outside. Brooke rushed to her room, got the key, fumbled with it for a second and exclaimed an 'A-ha!' of victory as she opened the door with a great smile. Sam on the other hand did not greet her with a great smile. She was lying on the floor next to the toilet looking un-great. Brooke helped the girl on the floor to her feet and led her to her bed.</p>
<p>"Okay Sam, what's up with you?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"What do I mean? So I didn't just hear you throw up your insides. Are you okay or should we pay a visit to the doctor?" </p>
<p>Sam had to think about that question before she answered. Yesterday at dinner, she had all of the sudden felt as all the food she just had eaten was rushing up her throat. Later on the evening, she had felt okay without any signs of illness. She had figured it must have been something in the food her body didn't like.</p>
<p>"I don't know Brooke. I feel fine now."</p>
<p>"Are you sure Sam? Cause you didn't sound so fine."</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes. "I'm fine Brooke, really. I'm just a bit stressed out. You know with mid terms like two weeks away and the school paper and... Shit!" Sam tossed her self out of bed heading for her desk where she rummaged around papers and books and old candy bar wrappers in search of the an article that had to be in that same day.</p>
<p>"What are you looking for?" Brooke asked, a bit scared of the sudden maniac reaction of the brunette.</p>
<p>"It's a... A thing... I have to..." Sam muttered as she looked around the now even messier mess.</p>
<p>"Ah! Here it is. Thank god! I almost saw my life flash before my eyes."</p>
<p>"Sam," The blonde approached Sam taking her hand, "I think you've got to wind down a little. You're gonna give your self a heart attack."</p>
<p>"Stop playing doctor Brooke. I'm fine and I'm not winding down until after mid terms."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Ah honestly don't know what ya talking about l'il Lily!</p>
<p>"Don't you play dumb with me Mary Cherry. I..."</p>
<p>"Ahm not playing." Mary Cherry interrupted the angry Latina holding a piece of paper in front of her face. "Ah am dumb. Momma Cherry even got me papers to prove it."</p>
<p>"And all this time, we though you were pretending." Nicole said sarcastically as she passed them by.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry gave Nicole her patented clueless expression with her head tilted to the side. "Ah though you knew I was dumb Nic."</p>
<p>Nicole turned around and had to mentally slap her self for saying anything to Mary Cherry. That girl didn't make it easy to be the "all new and improved Nicole Julian" as she would practically throw the opportunities to insult her right in the face of poor all new and improved Nicole.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of things that you are and are not Mary Cherry. And maybe you aren't the cleverest little Cherry on the tree but you do have qualities that make you..." Nicole had to think about something nice yet not all too mushy to say. "Special."</p>
<p>"Well thank ya Nic!" Mary Cherry exclaimed gleefully.</p>
<p>Nicole gave the southern girl a smile and turned to walk away. She had things she wanted to talk to Mary Cherry about, but not with Lily present. The blonde made a note to self to grab Mary Cherry next time she saw her alone.</p>
<p>"Hello! Mary Cherry? Are you in there?" Lily was enormously annoyed by the resent interruption in her interrogation of the ludicrous blonde in front of her.</p>
<p>"Well why are still standing there hun?"</p>
<p>"I was accusing you off sending me that gift basket Mary Cherry!"</p>
<p>"Ah told you l'il Lily; ah have absolutely nothin' ta do with it."</p>
<p>"I'm not stupid. Who else would send me a basket of meat delicacy and sign the card 'So ya'll don't starve' huh?"</p>
<p>"Hey guys what's up?" Sam entered the scene.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to make Mary Cherry to fess up!"</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, can I talk to you for a second?" Sam chose to ignore the present conversation between the two girls since she had more important things to take care of.</p>
<p>As the girls entered a conveniently empty Novak, Sam checked the stalls just in case some one was sneaking around eavesdropping on important conversations.</p>
<p>"Have you seen anybody with that little red note book of mine?"</p>
<p>"Ah do not believe so Sammy. Have ya lost it?"</p>
<p>"I think so... It's been gone for like a month now and it's freaking me out."</p>
<p>"Don't ya worry Sammy. As ya legitimate and officious source ah promise ta keep my eyes open for any beast of prey carrying around ya holy book of journalism."</p>
<p>"That's... great Mary Cherry. Just..." Sam trailed off and imagined Mary Cherry running around school with a dagger chasing people with red notebooks. And judging by Mary Cherry's past follies, that was a possible scenario.</p>
<p>"Just don't kill anybody okay?"</p>
<p>"Ya silly girl! Why would ah do anything like that?" Mary Cherry laughed gently elbowing Sam in the stomach.</p>
<p>Sam chose not to answer that since Brooke had told her that on career week, the computers had chosen serial killer as the career best suited for Mary Cherry. Instead, she gave the blonde an encouraging smile and left the Novak.</p>
