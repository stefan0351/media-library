<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 13: We Used To Be Friends -->

<p>"Brookie... Don't you think that you should...?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"But maybe you should..."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Brookie..."</p>
<p>"Nooo!"</p>
<p>Scenario: Brooke, drunk as a skunk, sitting on a rock down by the beach and Nicole standing in front of her trying to get her to stand up.</p>
<p>"Nic!" Brooke wailed waving her arms in an attempt to hold her self up on the rock while avoiding Nicole's hand grabbing her arm.</p>
<p>"Honey, I doubt you sitting here drinking cheap wine is gonna make things better."</p>
<p>"What do you know?" Brooke asked frowning at Nicole. "I don't wanna see her ever again."</p>
<p>"You don't have to Brookie, just... Let's go home." Nicole failed yet again to grab Brooke as the blonde threatened to hit her with the bottle. "Come on Brooke! I'll drive you home."</p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. "Nic, you don't have a driver's license."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. Gee, I forgot. But someone's got to drive you home."</p>
<p>"Nope. I'll walk home."</p>
<p>"Oh please B. You couldn't get yourself down from this rock if your life depended on it."</p>
<p>"Could too!" Brooke said trying to stand up but got only half way up before she fell down on the rock again.</p>
<p>"Hon, you're sitting on seaweed ... and a dead fish," Nicole said making a disgusted face, "Now if that's not a reason for you to get your drunk ass home and sleep away the alcohol and the shame, I don't know what is."</p>
<p>"I'm sitting on seaweed?"</p>
<p>"And a dead fish."</p>
<p>"Eeew!" Brooke squealed standing up without falling back for the first time. "Look at my pants!"</p>
<p>"I think we should call Spam..."</p>
<p>"Don't call her that." Brooke snapped.</p>
<p>"Okay, gee, sorry B." Nicole rolled her eyes. "I think we should call Sam and ask her to pick you up."</p>
<p>"You really think so?"</p>
<p>"Well... Yeah I do. You two should talk, don't you think so B?"</p>
<p>"She's evil!" Brooke said with a dramatic voice as if she was talking about something horrible.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't use the word evil but she is kinda..." Brooke looked at Nicole with big puppy eyes and Nicole thought she was too cute to upset. "Uhm, no B. Sam's not evil. Let's call her, okay?"</p>
<p>"Call who?"</p>
<p>"Sam... Jesus Brooke! Drunk much?"</p>
<p>"This is my first bottle." Brooke said holding up the almost empty vine bottle to take another sip. Nicole was faster to react than Brooke was so she managed to swipe the bottle from Brooke's hand.</p>
<p>"Hey! Gimme that!"</p>
<p>"Okay, you've wailed enough young lady. Sit here while I call Sam."</p>
<p>"No! I don't want her to see me like this."</p>
<p>"I don't think Sam cares in what state you're in. She..."</p>
<p>"I'm in California."</p>
<p>"No, I mean... Arrgh!" Nicole was now losing patience. "Listen to me Brooke. I promised Sam I would find her and bring you to her. Or the other way around. Something like that."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why? Cause she wants to talk to you."</p>
<p>"No, I mean why do you want to help Sam? Is this one of your dirty tricks? Cause I won't let you screw me and Sam up Nic."</p>
<p>"No! You're my friend Brooke and I miss you and... I want to help you. I've changed. And I'm trying to prove that by helping you guys out."</p>
<p>"Okay... Call Sam."</p>
<p>30 minutes later and Sam was at the beach walking towards the place where Nicole and Brooke were waiting for her.</p>
<p>"Hey Nicole."</p>
<p>"Hey Sam."</p>
<p>"I, Uhm... Thank you."</p>
<p>"No problem." Nicole shrugged.</p>
<p>"No, I really mean it. Thank you. To be honest; I wasn't sure you'd come through."</p>
<p>"I told you I would help you, didn't I?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'm not exactly used to a helping Nicole."</p>
<p>"Well, you better get used to it."</p>
<p>"I can't promise anything. But I'll try." Sam smiled and reached out her hand. Nicole took her hand feeling a bit awkward shaking hands with one of her former enemies. Sam was feeling exactly the same way but realized she better let that go because Nicole did her a really big favor. She figured she'd come to the letting go part when she worked things out with Brooke.</p>
<p>"Where's Brooke?" Sam asked looking around not seeing the blonde.</p>
<p>"She's down there." Nicole pointed at a pier where a bunch of stoners were sitting under it around a fire and indeed Brooke was sitting there singing with them.</p>
<p>Sam laughed shaking her head. "Guess we better go and get her."</p>
<p>"You go ahead Sam. I should get back home." Nicole said looking at her watch.</p>
<p>"Okay. Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Bye Sam."</p>
<p>"Bye Nic." After a couple of seconds Sam remembered her Sunnydale plan and decided, she should invite Nicole on the trip. After all, Nicole was showing sides Sam never thought existed.</p>
<p>"Hey Nic!"</p>
<p>Nicole turned around surprised. "Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm planning on going to Sunnydale this weekend and sort this mess up..."</p>
<p>"To that hell hole?" Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. "Yes, to that hell hole. Do you wanna come with us?"</p>
<p>"Me?" Nicole looked even more surprised now. Spam inviting her along on a trip, now that didn't happen every day.</p>
<p>"Yes, you." Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"So; you, me and Brookie in the spam mobile?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly. Lilly and Carmen are coming too. And... Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>"Oh. All of us in your car?"</p>
<p>"I think we need a bigger car."</p>
<p>"I can take care of that. Take care of Brooke and I'll call you tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Oh, okay. Bye."</p>
<p>"Bye."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam sat down besides Brooke and placed her hand on the blonde's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Brooke said rather surprised. "Were you looking for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Cause last time we talked you threw me out of your room. And you didn't show up at school today. I got worried."</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. We should've talked about it. You wanna talk now?"</p>
<p>"There's not much to talk about Brooke. I already told you everything there is to say. Now it's up to you, whether you trust me or not."</p>
<p>"I wanna trust you Sam but... You don't expect me to believe I knocked you up?"</p>
<p>"Why not? It's the truth. Why would I lie about something like that? Besides, I never lie to you."</p>
<p>"I know Sam. It's just... I don't know." Brooke rested her head against Sam's shoulder. "My head hurts." She said pouting.</p>
<p>Sam smiled and placed a soft kiss on her cheek.</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll talk about this when you're not as fuddled as you are now." She sneered. "Let's get you home before mom and Mike comes home."</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Can you carry me to the car?"</p>
<p>"In your dreams blondie! Not get up and start walking."</p>
<p>"You are evil." Brooke mumbled while trying to stand up.</p>
<p>"Well, that's what you get for not believing in me." Sam said with a smug face.</p>
