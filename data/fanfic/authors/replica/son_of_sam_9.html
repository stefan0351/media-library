<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 9: You Are In Serious McTrouble Young Lady! -->

<p>Sam was sitting on Brooke's bed repeating the words 'this is not happening' over and over again in her head. She had serious problems thinking straight. The strangest thing had happened and she didn't have a clue what to do about it or what to think of it. She tried to pinch her self out of the assumed dream, but this was no dream.</p>
<p>It was 18 days after the visit at the doctors. She had taken the pills the doctor had prescribed and they did help, but only something. She could still not eat or think about cereals. And sometimes just the thought of orange juice just made her sick. Sam tried to hide it as much as possible from Brooke and the parentals by avoiding things that made her want to vomit.</p>
<p>15 days after the visit, one day after the pills had run out, Sam got an interesting phone call from one of the nurses at the health center. The nurse said that since Sam had failed to call back, she was calling Sam to tell her that she was pregnant. Of course, Sam didn't believe her. She just laughed and said that there must be some mistake cause there was no chance in hell she was pregnant. However, the nurse insisted that no mistake had been done. Since Sam insisted that there was no chance in hell she could be pregnant, the nurse booked her another appointment with the doctor the next day. She had took another blood test and got the results back later that day. It said the same thing; Sam was pregnant. At that time, Sam was getting pretty pissed off. She stormed off to the Womens clinic and took a blood test and a urine test. She was going to prove she was NOT pregnant. The next day she got the results back and, surprise surprise, Sam was pregnant. As soon as she got the results she went down to the Womens clinic again to talk to a nurse cause the whole thing was freaking her out. The nurse tried to calm down the somewhat crazed brunette and decided that they should do an Ultrasonography on her. That way, they could really prove if she was pregnant or not. Sam almost fell out of the bed when she saw what was inside her on the little screen. At first, it was a little messy but then the nurse pointed out a little head and something that could resemble a body (but looked more like a kidney bean). Sam felt panic taking over as she looked around for any hidden cameras or some funny guy jumping out saying "You are on candid camera!" But no one jumped out from nowhere. The nurse looked very sure of the thing. Sam was pregnant no doubt about that. And on top of it all, she was two months pregnant. Sam hadn't even thought about the fact that she had skipped two periods. Her menstruation cycle had not been her first priority the last couple of months.</p>
<p>After three blood tests, one urine test and one Ultrasonography, Sam still couldn't believe that she had a little kid inside her. And who could blame her? The only person she had ever had sex with was Brooke and she was pretty sure the blonde was not capable of such things as knocking her up. Then, the most hideous feeling took over her body. What if something had happened to her and she couldn't remember? What if someone had...? Sam panicked as those thought filled her head. She had to literally shake them of. Something inside her knew what had happened. She just had to drag it out of her messy head.</p>
<p>She was waiting for Brooke to come home from practice. She didn't have a clue about what she would say to Brooke but she figured she would be as understanding as always and help her out of that mess.</p>
<p>As her thoughts wondered off, she started to think about everything that had happened the last couple of months. Those issues with cereals started to make a whole lot of sense. She remembered when her mom was pregnant and couldn't stand various dishes and threw up almost every morning for months.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. A warm feeling spread through her body when she thought about the fact that she was pregnant. She could feel something inside her that was warm and fuzzy that had never been there before. She thought about Brooke and how much she loved her and that maybe having a kid together wasn't such a bad thing after all. And then, she got up from bed as if something had stung her ass. Words and pictures flashed before her eyes at 1000 words/second. Suddenly, everything was crystal clear. Just like that. She realized, she was pregnant and Brooke was the... Mother? Father? Fother? Mather? Smother? Heather? Weather? Something like that. Sam couldn't completely figure it out but it made so much sense in a very freaky and out of this world kind of way. It had to be magic. And what had caused it? Sam looked around her room and saw the little amulet she'd got from Carmen and Lily. She picked it up, looked at it, and she was sure that the amulet was the cause of it all. It was like that amulet made Sam forget everything about a little thing called commonsense.</p>
<p>At that moment, Brooke had come home. Sam heard her coming up the stairs and coming down the hall. The footsteps stopped outside the bedroom and at the door stood a smiling Brooke looking beautiful as always.</p>
<p>"Hey Babe. What's up?"</p>
<p>"Hey princess!" Sam happily embraced the blonde.</p>
<p>"Well aren't we a little ray of sunshine today." Brooke laughed giving Sam another hug.</p>
<p>"I've got news, but I don't know how you are going to take this..."</p>
<p>"Something wrong Sammy?" Brooke immediately turned in to worried-mode.</p>
<p>"I don't know if wrong is the right word to describe this, but something's definitely up." Sam took the blonde who now was in full worried-mode by the hand and led her to the bed. "I think you better sit down."</p>
<p>Sam started to tell the whole story of the three blood tests and one urine test. She showed her the papers she'd got from the Womens clinic and copies of the ultrasound scan. Brooke started to laugh like Sam did the first time the nurse called her.</p>
<p>"Ha-ha really funny Sam. April fool's day is in two months. I don't know why you go through so much trouble just to play a little joke on me. I'm not buying this." She took the ultrasound scans and looked at them closer. "What are these? Jane's scans?"</p>
<p>"No Brooke, they're mine." Sam whispered.</p>
<p>"Cut it out Sam! You are not fooling me." Brooke's smile faded slowly as she saw that the brunette in front of her was doing the opposite of smiling.</p>
<p>"Brooke this is not a joke. I am serious. I've spent the last three days running between different places trying to prove that I am not pregnant. I don't know how, but I am... pregnant"</p>
<p>Brooke stared at Sam with her mouth opened for quite a while. Almost too long for Sam. She knew that what she just had said sounded stupid and judging from the look on Brooke's face, she was not happy about the news. And Sam was right. Brooke tried to gather her mind that had wondered off to another dimension. She could tell Sam was telling the truth. Nevertheless, that could only mean one thing; Sam had cheated on her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean you don't know how?" Brooke asked her snapping out of the paralyze. "Sam, I know you are well aware of the birds and the bees."</p>
<p>"I don't know Brooke!" Sam snapped. "You are the only one I've ever had sex with, you know that!"</p>
<p>"Well apparently not." Brooke said crossing her arms around her chest. She was blooming out into full combat-mode.</p>
<p>"What are you saying Brooke? That I cheated on you?" Brooke gave her a 'DUUH STUPID!' kinda look and Sam felt stupid indeed. Telling your girlfriend that you are pregnant and then getting pissed because she thinks you have cheated isn't the most logic thing to do. On the other hand, nothing in this odd situation was very logic.</p>
<p>"Sam, what the hell do you want me to believe, huh? My girlfriend tells me she's pregnant and though I lack the essential attributes to impregnate her, she actually wants me to believe she has not slept with anybody but me. Puh-lease." Brooke snorted.</p>
<p>Sam didn't know what to say. Everything she had planned to say felt all of the sudden useless. She couldn't even look Brooke in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to say Brooke. I'm telling you the truth. I'd hoped you would believe me..."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Brooke exploded making Sam flinch. "Did you hit your head on the way home or what? I know you're not so stupid to actually think that I would believe you're telling me the truth."</p>
<p>"Tell me Sam, who was it? George? Some random guy whose name you don't even know? Tell me!"</p>
<p>"Please Brooke..."</p>
<p>"Or was it Harrison? Couldn't resist the temptation Sam? You always had a thing for my left over, didn't you, Sammy?" Brooke's voice was full of rage.</p>
<p>That hit Sam like a big rock against her chest. She couldn't hold back the tears anymore. "Stop it Brooke! You don't know what you're talking about..."</p>
<p>"Then tell me Sam! Enlighten me!"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you if you stop interrupting me!" Sam wiped away the tears and took a deep breath. "Look, I have not slept with anybody but you. I know it sounds weird, but you just have to believe me. Don't you trust me?"</p>
<p>"I used to trust you Sam, but not anymore. After everything we've gone through... and... and you do something like this? I can't believe this shit!"</p>
<p>"You have to listen to me..."</p>
<p>"No, I am not gonna listening to you." Brooke grabbed a hold of Sam's arm and started pushing her towards the door. Sam tried her best to get out her grip but Brooke was much stronger than her.</p>
<p>"Get out Sam! When you are ready to tell me what happened and stand up for what you have done, then we talk. But right now I want you to get the hell out of my room!" Brooke managed to shove Sam outside and closed the door with a loud bang.</p>
<p>Sam sat outside the door listening to Brooke crying while crying herself. She tried to get Brooke to talk to her several times but the blonde wouldn't respond to her pleads. After a while, the parentals came home and Brooke never came down to dinner that evening.</p>
