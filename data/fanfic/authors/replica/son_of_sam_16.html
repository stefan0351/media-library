<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 16: Did I Do That? -->

<p>"Hey, lovebirds wake up!" Nicole said throwing a pillow on Mary Cherry's head.</p>
<p>"What do you want Nicole?" Lily said throwing back the pillow at the blonde.</p>
<p>"Not that it's any of you concern Lily, but I'm quite worried about this."</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About the two of you spooning in the couch while I had to sleep on the floor not being able to even toss and turn in that small sleeping bag because of the disturbing though of you cuddling."</p>
<p>"We were not cuddling, Nicole."</p>
<p>"Yeah Nic. You were the one that said we had to make friends with outcasts."</p>
<p>"Yeah, Hi. Make friends, not make out."</p>
<p>"Cut it out, Nicole. You're just yellous because Mary Cherry asked me to sleep on the couch and not you."</p>
<p>"Hey, what's all the fuss about?" Carmen said entering the room in her pink Hello Kitty pajamas.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Nicole is just deluded." Lily answered.</p>
<p>"When do they serve breakfast in this place?" Mary Cherry asked.</p>
<p>"I guess if we want breakfast, we'll have to make it our selves."</p>
<p>The four girls walked in to the kitchen where they found Dawn and Tara making pancakes.</p>
<p>"Oh! Pancakes!"</p>
<p>"Hey, good morning guys. Did you sleep well?" Dawn asked.</p>
<p>All the girls nod except Nicole. "I am so getting a room tonight." She said.</p>
<p>"Nic, stop being so rude." Mary Cherry smiled giving Nicole a shove.</p>
<p>"I hope our pancakes can make up for the bad night." Tara said handing over a plate with pancakes and syrup with a smile.</p>
<p>Nicole shrugged, pouted, gave Mary Cherry an ugly face and finally sat her self down with the plate.</p>

<p>"Good morning princess." Sam said kissing Brooke on the forehead.</p>
<p>"Good morning to you too." Brooke rubbed her eyes and turned around to face Sam. "So, have you checked?"</p>
<p>"My belly?"</p>
<p>Brooke nod.</p>
<p>"Nope. I wanted to wait for you to wake up."</p>
<p>"Wow. I'm impressed Sam. You've been up longer than me and haven't even peeped?"</p>
<p>"Well, actually: I woke up like five minutes ago and couldn't take it anymore. So I woke you up."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I thought so McPherson, you're such a Curious George. Hah, no pun intended."</p>
<p>"Ha-Ha, really funny Brooke. How about skipping the comedy act and check out my belly instead?"</p>
<p>"So you want me to do the honors?"</p>
<p>"Jupp."</p>
<p>"Okay, but before I do it. I just want you to remember what we talked about last night."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I remember Brooke."</p>
<p>"Okay, here it goes."</p>
<p>Brooke pulled down the covers and gently pulled up Sam's shirt but pulled it down again and looked at Sam who was staring up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes! My god Brooke, just look at it already!"</p>
<p>"Okay." Brooke laughed and finally looked into Sam's belly button.</p>
<p>"OMG... OMG Sam."</p>
<p>"What? Is it there?"</p>
<p>Brooke did not answer. She just stared at Sam's belly.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam sat herself up and looked down. "OMG!"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be a dad." Brooke said with a shaky voice. "We're gonna have a baby together."</p>
<p>Tears were running down Sam's cheeks and she threw herself on top of Brooke and kissed her like never before. There was no time to be shocked or confused. She just wanted to smooch with Brooke and never let go.</p>
<p>However, Brooke broke the kiss. "Hey, what are we going to name the baby?"</p>
<p>"Brooke." Sam wailed. "You're kinda ruining the moment here."</p>
<p>"Do you realize we're bringing a little mini-me to the world?"</p>
<p>"Uhm, yeah? How about Sam Jr?"</p>
<p>"I mean; There are a lot of important things to discuss Sam! Like how are we going to get the money to support this child? And you won't be able to go to college and I..."</p>
<p>"Brooke, relax. We have a lot of time to think about that. Let's just enjoy the good news and smooch some more?"</p>
<p>"Sam Jr?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Sam Jr?"</p>
<p>"How about Brooke Jr?"</p>
<p>"How about not?"</p>
