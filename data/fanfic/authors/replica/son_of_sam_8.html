<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 8: Bah Humbug -->

<p>Nicole Julian was standing in front of one of the mirrors in the Novak touching up her make up. She had a gut feeling Mary Cherry would turn up any second. She had seen her in the halls and spotted a serious need of a touch-up.</p>
<p>And she was right. Just a few seconds after Nicole was done touching up, Mary Cherry burst in to the Novak, looking quite nervous when she spotted Nicole. The Texan walked to the mirror next to Nicole and started applying lip-gloss in an awkward silence, shooting sideway glances at the shorter blonde next to her.</p>
<p>"Okay Nic. Why ya looking at me like that?"</p>
<p>Nicole shrugged, looking innocent. "I don't know what you are talking about Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry gave her a skeptical look before she continued with the lip-gloss, pouting for the mirror. After a few second, the blonde could not take more.</p>
<p>"You are drivin me crazy with those innocently observin, yet very frightenin looks ya givin me! Now tell me what's on that unscrupulous little heart of yours."</p>
<p>"I still don't know what you are talking about Mary Cherry. Gee, I've must have bumped my head really bad, huh?" Nicole said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Well ya have ta be careful where ya put your head." Mary Cherry tried her best to lighten the mood but her smile faded and she started to slowly recoil as two icy blue eyes where locked with hers. "I thought ya were new and improved Nic." Mary Cherry asked nervously.</p>
<p>"I am. That's why there are no automobiles involved in this little face off."</p>
<p>"Oh." Mary Cherry gulped. "That's great Nic. Don't wanna make road killing a habit, do we?"</p>
<p>Nicole snorted. "How about backstabbing, Mary Cherry? Is that something we want to make into a habit?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry shrugged gesticulating 'I don't know' with her hands, trying her best to look as innocent as possible.</p>
<p>"Okay Mary Cherry, I'll cut right to the chase." Nicole held up a little red notebook, Sam's little red notebook. "Recognize this?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry stood frozen in place with her mouth opened. She was perplexed beyond. That notebook had been gone almost two months now and she had forgetten she had promised Sam help her get it back. On the other hand, Nicole didn't look like the one she should be crossing. Mary Cherry considered the pros and cons of the two answerers she could give Nicole. She decided to stick with option number two; lying her ass off.</p>
<p>"Ah have never ever seen that pad before, Nic."</p>
<p>"Are you sure, Mary Cherry?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry nodded vigorously thinking she was now free of charges.</p>
<p>"Yeah hi, nice try hun. But you see, this is Sam McPherson's notebook." Nicole said mockingly.</p>
<p>"How do ya know it's Sam's notebook?"</p>
<p>"Please, stop acting as such a retard Mary Cherry. I know you're smarter than that. It says right here; Sam McPherson. For a regular Nancy Drew-wannabe, you think she would be a little more careful where she puts her things."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry looked around in the Novak. She couldn't run because Nicole was blocking her path to the door, she didn't know what to say because all her emergency lies were suddenly forgotten and running for a stall wouldn't improve her situation.</p>
<p>"The question is, Mary Cherry, why are you doing this?"</p>
<p>"Doing what Nic?" Mary Cherry had decided to plead innocence since playing dumb to save her ass was one of her specialties.</p>
<p>Nicole sighed. "Why are you playing Sam's little helper?"</p>
<p>"I'm only telling her things that are true..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that were true two years ago Mary Cherry." Nicole interrupted the Texan wrathfully making her flinch. "If you haven't noticed it, I am trying to change here. You know: one good deed everyday."</p>
<p>"Ah just wanted to be her friend. You know now that Sam and Brooke have made an unconventional commitment, ah thought it would be best to burry the hatchet." Mary Cherry gesticulated a burry of a hatchet with her hands that almost made Nicole laugh.</p>
<p>"You know there are better ways to make friends."</p>
<p>"There are?" Mary Cherry asked genuinely confused.</p>
<p>"Look, I know that in the old days when it was we (crème de la crème of Kennedy high), against them (the socially challenged outcasts), we ruled with cruelty; lying, cheating, backstabbing, ridiculing others and so forth. However, I think it is time for a serious attitude change, Mary Cherry. The dawn of a new era." Nicole gesticulated at the sealing with her arm with dreamy eyes.</p>
<p>"You see," Nicole continued, "I have lost my best friend because of my ruthless and somewhat crazed behavior." Mary Cherry nod in agreement making Nicole arch an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"And now I am getting her back. Spam-free or not. It doesn't matter. Brooke is the one that matters to me."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry gave Nicole a smile full of empathy and put her hand on Nicole's shoulder. "That was just beautiful Nic!" She said on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>"Yeah, okay Mary Cherry, stop the sobbing. You're going to ruin my coat."</p>
<p>"But ah am touched." Mary Cherry wiped away her tears before her eyeliner was ruined. "Maybe now we can be like old times. Well, except for the barbarous behavior maybe."</p>
<p>Nicole raised a brow at Mary Cherry's choice of words but shrugged it off. Sometimes it was better to ignore the blonde's follies.</p>
<p>"I am going to talk to Sam about this... thing. And you Mary Cherry, just keep your mouth shut. Please."</p>
<p>Mary Cherry nodded enthusiastically clapping her hands together. This was the most exiting thing that had happened in months. It was almost feeling like those good old days.</p>
