<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 7: Fool If You Think It's Over -->

<p>Brooke was waiting impatiently in the kitchen of the palace, casually stuffing her self with grapes while reading a magazine. Lily and Carmen where coming over to lure Sam over to the health center for a routine check. Sam on the other hand thought they were going to sign up as blood donors. Lily had managed to convince her with some bogus lie she never though Sam would buy.</p>
<p>Brooke felt a little bad and a little afraid. Bad because she felt it was somewhat wrong to have to force Sam in to something she obviously didn't want, and afraid cause Sam had been PMSing big time the past few days and she was to afraid of Sam's eventually violent reaction.</p>
<p>"Hey Brooke." Lily and Carmen entered the palace kitchen.</p>
<p>"Hi guys." Brooke looked up from the magazine trying to smile but the smile faded in to a frown.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?" Lily asked sitting her self down in front of the Blonde.</p>
<p>"I don't know. It's just that I don't know if I should be lying to Sam. After everything all the lying and deceiving each other ..." Brooke put her head on the table and started to cry.</p>
<p>Carmen and Lily exchanged worried looks for a while not knowing what to do with the crying cheerleader who was now gently bumping her head on the table.</p>
<p>"Uhm... Brooke?" Carmen carefully stroke Brooke's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry guys. I need a lady time." Brooke said into the table.</p>
<p>Both brunettes mouthed 'oh' and Lily took out a lady time from her bag.</p>
<p>"I keep them in my bag. You never know when they come in handy." Lily smiled.</p>
<p>After wiping her tears away and smiling awkwardly at the awkwardly smiling brunettes, Brooke started pacing around the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Don't you think we should just tell Sam what's going on? You know, we've got a strict honesty policy in this family... and I think Sam might kill me. She's really into this honesty thing."</p>
<p>"Brooke. Do you know what Sam told me when I tried to talk to her yesterday?" Brooke shook her head. "She told me to back off and go and save a monkey instead." Both Carmen and Brooke burst in to laughter.</p>
<p>"I would've kicked her ass if I didn't know she was PMSing." The little brunette continued. "That's why we have to do this. It feels kinda stupid but Sam can be so damn stubborn when she wants to." The other two girls nod in agreement. "It's been two weeks now and am I the only one that have noticed how much weight she's lost?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Let's roll!" Sam shouted coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. "Let's get this over with."</p>
<p>"Hey Lily, I'm so glad we're doing this. It feels good, you know; giving something back to the gentle people who saved my life." Lily couldn't discern if it was genuine joy or sarcasm in Sam's voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, isn't that great." Lily stated flatly. The whole plan was feeling more and more stupid for every minute.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Four girls were sitting quietly reading magazines in the waiting room of the local health center. Brooke was anxiously flipping trough the pages without giving them much attention. She was occupied trying to come up with something to say to Sam. Sitting beside her, was Sam in the middle of a mental argument with the article she was reading. She wished someone could smack the journalist who wrote it. She wished she could smack him. Hard. Maybe even kill him. When those thoughts had reached her head, she decided to flip the page before something bad happened.</p>
<p>"Samantha McPherson?" An old man in a white robe called out, looking at some papers in his hands.</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, that's me." Sam said, slowly standing up looking confused.</p>
<p>"Come this way miss." The doctor indicated the direction of his office with his arm.</p>
<p>Sam turned around to be met by three nervous smiles. "Aren't you guys coming or what?"</p>
<p>"I'll go with you Sam." Brooke stood up.</p>
<p>"I thought they were going to call us in together."</p>
<p>"Well... Uhm... honey, were sort of lied about the blood donor thing." Brooke said in a low voice keeping a safe distance from the brunette.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I booked you an appointment with the doctor to get that ulcer checked."</p>
<p>"Nuh-uh!" Sam exclaimed pouting and crossing her arms around her chest.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. The doctor was observing them with his brow raised. The blonde gave him a sheepish smile and grabbed a hold on Sam's arm.</p>
<p>"Come on, this way." Brooke said between clenched teeth showing the brunette behind the doctor.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam sat on a chair while the doctor was taking a blood sample. Sam had no idea what it was for and she didn't even bother to ask. She just wanted to get it over with.</p>
<p>"When did you have your last period?"</p>
<p>"I'm... Well it's supposed to come any day now." Sam answered confused.</p>
<p>The doctor hummed and nod sitting him self at his desk tapping on his computer before he looked up at Sam making her nervous with those absent stares.</p>
<p>"I am going to prescribe Nexium for you. It will gradually ease the retching. You take one pill each day for fourteen days and if the symptoms remain after 14 days, you give me a call. And don't forget to call in a few days to get the results from the pregnancy test."</p>
<p>"Pardon?" Sam asked in a pitch much higher than her usual voice while taking the pills from the doctor.</p>
<p>"I said that you have to..."</p>
<p>"Yeah... I-I heard what you said." Sam interrupted the doctor.</p>
<p>"It's just that I have never... I mean I-I don't do... I mean I don't think I-I-I..."</p>
<p>"Something wrong?"</p>
<p>Sam stopped stuttering and stared at the doctor for a moment. She was so close to getting out of there and for some reason she just couldn't tell the doctor why there were no chance in hell she could be pregnant. Though it pissed her off that he just had assumed that was the cause of the illness. To prevent any inconvenience with the doctor. She just smiled, nod and left his office. She figured it would be better to just not bother about calling back.</p>
<p>When she came out Brooke, Lily and Carmen were sitting in the same chairs as before, looking more bored than they used to look in bio class.</p>
<p>"So?" Brooke asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"He gave me pills. I'll be okay." Sam replied in a surly tone of voice.</p>
<p>"That wasn't so bad, was it?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"You could have told me, I'm not a kid."</p>
<p>Lily rolled her eyes. "Yeah right Sam. I tried to talk to you yesterday and you told me to go and save a monkey instead."</p>
<p>Sam made no comments. She just stood in the middle of the waiting room pouting with her arms crossed around her chest. She was pissed off at her two friends and her girlfriend. Even though she felt a little silly standing there like a kid who had been refused candy.</p>
<p>"Oh get over it McPherson!" Brooke suddenly stood up. "I'll wait in the car. You can come out when you are done pouting."</p>
<p>Carmen followed the blonde giving Sam guilty smile on her way out. Lily reckoned it was time for what she was best at; damage control.</p>
<p>"Sam?" The pouty brunette didn't answer. She just pretended to be very interested in a poster hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>"Don't give me the silent treatment. Come on. I'm sorry. It was really dumb but you brought it on your self. If you hadn't said that monkey thing I might have let you in on our little secret."</p>
<p>"Not making it better Lily!" Sam said still grouchy.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's enough." Lily grabbed Sam's arm and started dragging her along towards the exit. "We can talk about this at home Miss pouty."</p>
