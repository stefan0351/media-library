<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 1: Dream a Little Dream -->

<p>"Princess? Hey Princess, wake up. Brooke! Come on!"</p>
<p>Brooke slowly opened her eyes and saw something dark in front of her face. As her vision got less blurry, she could make out a pair of dark eyes and dark hair.</p>
<p>"What are you dreaming about?"</p>
<p>Brook squinted looking up at the brunette sitting on her bed.</p>
<p>"W-what... Why?"</p>
<p>"You were talking in your sleep again."</p>
<p>Brook tried to sit her self up while rubbing her eyes with one hand. "What time is it?" She asked when realizing that it was still dark outside.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Maybe two or three something." The brunette shrugged.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and hit Sam on the arm with a small pillow.</p>
<p>"Sam! Why the hell did you wake me up? I've got early practice tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You sounded scared and I thought you might want some comfort." Sam pouted rubbing her arm though the pillow didn't hurt her at all.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and stroke the brunette's cheek with her thumb. She just looked to damn cute pouting. "What was I saying?" She smiled.</p>
<p>"You where saying 'Oh spank me harder Sammy!' and then there were some grunting." Sam didn't believe the blonde's eyes could possible get more wider than they were right then. Without being able to stop the giggle forming bigger in her throat, she threw her self back in the bed bursting in to a hysterical laugh.</p>
<p>Brooke looked at the laughing brunette in front or her with insecurity spread all over her face. "What's so funny Sam?" She asked pulling the covers up to hide her face.</p>
<p>"It's just that..." Sam paused to gather her self and clear her throat, "You looked SO cute and so scared when I told you..."</p>
<p>She paused again to catch her still irregular breath, "But I'm only joking princess." She burst in to yet another laugh, though more moderated this time.</p>
<p>Brooke was red from embarrassment, hiding her face in her hands. Sam finally managed to control her laughter and tried to get Brooke to take away her hands from her face. "Hey! Why are you hiding? Don't tell me you actually were dreaming of me spanking you? Cause if that's what you want then..."</p>
<p>"Sam!" The blonde exclaimed while hitting Sam with the same small pillow as last time. "I was not! But I sure think you would like that!"</p>
<p>"What if I do?" Sam teased.</p>
<p>Brooke hit Sam again, this time with her fist. "Aotch! What's up with you hitting me? Aha. Maybe you're the one who wanna spank me?" That earned Sam yet an other blow on her arm.</p>
<p>"Did you wake me up just to piss me off Sam? Cause I just wanna kick your..."</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay!" Sam hold up her hands for protection in case of the blonde striking an other blow at her.</p>
<p>"Was I actually talking in my sleep Sam? Cause if I was, I wanna know, and if I wasn't," Brooke paused and locked eyes with Sam, "get out of my room!" Brooke threw her self on top on Sam and started tickling her. Sam struggled for a while before she managed to get out of Brookes grip.</p>
<p>"I can't get out of your room if you keep pinning me down to your bed princess." Sam laughed. "Do you or do you not want to know what you were saying?"</p>
<p>"So I was talking in my sleep..." Sam nod. "Okay, what did I say?"</p>
<p>"You were saying something like 'No Sammy, that is not my baby'. Is there something you're not telling me?" Brooke stared at Sam with her mouth slightly opened. "God Brooke, are you pregnant?"</p>
<p>"What? No Sammy! I just remembered what I was dreaming."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh?"</p>
<p>"You were pregnant Sam. And the weirdest thing was that I was the father... I mean mother... or... you know what I mean."</p>
<p>"You impregnated me Brooke?" Sam asked giggling.</p>
<p>"Yeah. And it was really weird. Everything was so real." Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"I don't think we have to worry about that happening, do we princess?" Sam flashed the blonde a mischievous grin moving closer so they were sitting face to face. She cupped her face with her hands and moved in brushing her lips against Brookes.</p>
<p>"Sam I don't think we..." Brooke made it only so far, because before she knew it, Sam was claiming her lips.</p>
<p>"Sam please," Brooke broke the kiss," it's late and I really need to sleep. You know how sulky Nic gets when I slack at practice."</p>
<p>"But I need you Brooke." Sam pouted. "Can't I at least sleep next to you in your bed? My bed is so cold and lonely."</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. She really needed her sleep, however, she knew Sam would never give in. And those puppy dog eyes were really making her all mushy. "Okay Sam. But don't you be putting your hands on inappropriate places! I need to sleep." She said patting on the bed.</p>
<p>Sam's face lit up like a Christmas tree and she hurried to lay down next to the cheerleader. She spooned her and rested her face in Brooke's hair. After a while, when Brooke managed to drift in to sleep, Sam started to place feather light kisses on her neck. Brooke turned a little and Sam bit her, first carefully and then harder. The blond let out a small moan as she turned some more. The brunette grinned and caressed the length on Brookes leg, moving her hand up to Brookes tummy and just when she was about to cup one of Brookes breasts, the blond slapped her hand.</p>
<p>"I told you Sam: No hand on inappropriate places! Do I have to throw you out of my room?" She felt Sam shaking her head. "Good. Now, I really need to sleep. I promise we can play tomorrow, okay baby?"</p>
