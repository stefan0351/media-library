<P>Today was not a good day to die,  B'Elanna Torres decided, but she did  conclude that it was a good day to kill.   After just three brief, but long months of marriage to Tom she found herself standing before her Captain requesting a divorce. She wasn't sure what was worse, that he had an affair or that it was with his latest holo creation.  She felt completely dishonored and the fact that she seemed to be the last to know only intensified her humiliation.  Of all the people on board Voyager that she counted as friends, the last person she would have expected to be the one to tell her was Seven of Nine.   No, now that she thought about it, it made perfect sense that Seven would be the one.   It had taken her more than three years, but B'Elanna had finally begun to see just how special, how unique, how much integrity...well just how wonderful that former Borg drone really  was.   When Seven had found her yesterday in jeffries tube 12,  B'Elanna couldn't  remember ever seeing her look so out of sorts before.</p>
<p>"Lt. Torres....B'Elanna, I must speak with you."</p>
<p>'Well this is a first, she's never called me B'Elanna before.'  </p>
<p>"Sure, Annika, what's on your mind," `two can play at this game,' she thought.</p>
<p>Seven was taken aback at first.  No one ever called her Annika, not even the Captain.  In fact, no one had even asked to call her by her human designation except Captain Janeway three years early.   She was `uncomfortable' with that name then, but hearing B'Elanna use it just now made her reconsider her previous decision.  She wasn't sure if it was She that had changed since being severed from the collective, or if it was just the person using her name with such liberty that made her question herself.  That thought confused her, so she decided to file it away for further examination.  Right now she had a rather sorrowful obligation, and she couldn't allow herself to be so easily distracted.   She wasn't even ready to begin dealing with why this `duty' was affecting her so completely. Seven not being one to beat around the bush began.  </p>
<p>"I regret to inform you that I have some rather difficult information that concerns you...or rather Lt. Paris.....well your marriage."</p>
<p>This got B'Elanna's attention fast, as her Klingon instincts came online and she began to get defensive.  Her marriage hadn't been the quick fix she had hopped for, and she had just recently begun to realize how foolish she had been for thinking it would be.  </p>
<p>"Spit  it out Borg,  I haven't got time for games."</p>
<p>"No, but it would appear that your husband does."  As soon as the words left Seven's mouth she regretted them.  Why did it take so little from Lt. Torres to get to her.   </p>
<p>"Don't let her get your goat, Seven," was the advise the Captain had given, as if that was to clarify the problem. </p>
<p>B'Elanna's reply was understandably harsher, "Just what the hell is that supposed to mean, drone!"</p>
<p>The only thing Seven hated being called worse than  `Borg' was `drone', but this time she refused to allow  `her goat to be got' by the lieutenant and rushed on.   </p>
<p>"I inadvertently walked in on Lt. Paris's holo-program.  He was...," here Seven paused, trying to think of the gentlest, yet still most accurate description of what she saw.  "...he was engaged with one of the female characters...in a sexual way."  She added, examining B'Elanna's eyes for understanding. </p>
<p>Her deep sable eyes revealed much; hurt, embarrassment, anger, humiliation and defiantly understanding as she shouted, "What!  Tom...Lt. Paris was copulating with a holodeck character?"  B'Elanna needed to make sure there was no room for misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Seven felt a sudden urge to reach out to B'Elanna, to take her hand, but frankly was a little scared..at both the urge and the Lieutenant.  So she just nodded her head and said, "Yes." That was five hours ago.   </p>
<p>B'Elanna had spent those five hours confirming Seven's story.  The fact that it was Seven who witnessed Tom's indiscretion and then reported it to her pretty much meant that it was true.  No matter how adversarial  their relationship had been in the past, Seven wasn't one to hold a grudge, or to make up a story.  Seven didn't lie, hell she didn't even exaggerate.  And so here she was, standing before her Captain, asking her to reverse her failed marriage.    </p>
<p>The Captain had been more than understanding.  She, naturally, took care of the legality of the situation.  But, she also acted as a surrogate mother for B'Elanna.  Comforting her brilliant Chief Engineer, allowing her to literally cry on her shoulder.  By the time B'Elanna left the ready room, her marriage had been annulled, the "Paris-Torres" quarters had been re-designated back to just the "Torres" quarters, and Tom and all his stuff had been reassigned new, much smaller, crew accommodations as far away from B'Elanna's as possible.  </p>
<p>The chime at her door surprised her.  Since her breakup she had placed a "do not disturb" status on both her quarters and her com-badge while off duty. She had told Tom that she didn't want to talk to him about the divorce anymore, and she couldn't imagine who would be either brave enough, or stupid enough to come knocking at her door just a two weeks after her split. </p>
<p>"Computer, identify the PetaQ outside my quarters?" Since B'Elanna had programmed a few `essential' Klingon phrases into the computer in her quarters it had no problem answering her request in it's calm, monotone voice, "The petaQ outside your quarters is Seven of Nine."  </p>
<p>This made B'Elanna cringe, of all the people on board Seven was probably the only one who would have just heard herself  being insulted...twice.  She also happened to be about the only person  B'Elanna could tolerate these last few weeks.  She got to the door just in time to see her `friend' (is that what she had become?)  turn around to leave.</p>
<p>"Seven, hey come back, I didn't realize...."</p>
<p>".....that I was the PetaQ at your door," she finished helpfully, raising the implant just above her left eye in that way that B'Elanna was soon learning to enjoy. </p>
<p>"Yeah, something like that.   What brings you by?  Would you care for a drink?"</p>
<p>Now Seven had been asked this question dozens of times, and with out fail had almost always declined the offer.  But even though she knew that she did not `require liquid refreshments at this time,' she hesitated.  It wasn't even that she wanted a beverage, she recognized that she simply wanted to spend some social time with this beautiful woman before her.   </p>
<p>That admission seemed to please her, and it was with a slight smile that she informed B'Elanna that, " Yes, I would care for a drink."  B'Elanna just stared at her patiently, almost recognizing how unique this situation was.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna started mumbling to herself about the `perfect Borg' drink as she walked to the replicator.  </p>
<p>"I know just the thing."  And with that B'Elanna proceeded to order two Shirley Temples from the replicator.  She handed the drink to Seven and watched intently for her reaction.  For her part, Seven had been a bit nervous by B'Elanna's excitement.  She was almost afraid to see what B'Elanna's idea of a `perfect' drink would be for her. The smile that spread across Seven's face was small by anyone else's standards, but it spoke volumes to B'Elanna, and made her just a bit wistful to think of all the wonderful experiences Seven had been cheated out of.  She made a decision then and there that she would be the one to befriend this incredible women and introduce her to the many pleasures that life had to offer.  That choice seemed to bring a great deal of pleasure to her, even though she wasn't quite ready to admit it.</p>
<p>"You like it Seven?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is wonderful.  It seems to make my mouth..." she hesitated, "...happy, but that doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps my implants are malfunctioning already.  What is the synthehol percentage in a  Shirley Temple?"</p>
<p>This made B'Elanna grin openly.   Seven, feeling vulnerable, started to rethink her desire to spend time with this feisty half Klingon, began to leave.  Not being very experienced with feelings yet, B'Elanna  read Seven's face like a book and started to reassure her immediately.  As B'Elanna spoke she put her hand on Seven's shoulder, causing Seven to turn around and face her.  </p>
<p>"Seven, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to scare you.  There's no synthehol in a Shirley Temple, honest.  You were just so...well it was cute the way you assumed you were malfunctioning do to synthehol consumption."  She tried to reassure the former Borg with precise language.  "If you think this is good, wait till you taste a vanilla Coke!"  </p>
<p>B'Elanna's excitement was back and Seven found herself caught up in it.  </p>
<p>"If it is so good, then why must I wait?  I wish to experience a  vanilla Coke right now!"  </p>
<p>This was to much for B'Elanna, who proceeded into a fit of giggles.  A sound that Seven found all to pleasing.  </p>
<p>"All right, but first why don't you finish your Shirley Temple, and tell me why you came by."</p>
<p>Seven became serious, as well as taking a rather large sip of her drink, and took a seat on the couch, where B'Elanna joined her.  </p>
<p>"I wanted to check up on you.  To see how you are functioning.  Since your divorce from Lt. Paris you have not been seen outside you quarters except in your official capacity as Chief Engineer?  I am beginning to become concerned."</p>
<p>The last part was spoken with such sincerity, and warmth that B'Elanna let her own shields down, "I didn't think anyone would notice."</p>
<p>"I noticed," was all Seven needed to say.  </p>
<p>"Seven, about what you did, about telling me about Tom...."</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, I am so sorry for the pain I caused you. I know I can never hope to be you friend after what I've done, but.."</p>
<p>Now it was B'Elanna's turn to interrupt, "Oh, Seven how could you think that?  You didn't cause me any pain, that was Tom's doing. And as for not being my friend, well it's to late, you already are my friend.  You truly have grasped what it is to be a true friend.  You were in a very awkward situation when you found out about Tom.  None of my other so called friends had the courage to come to me with the difficult truth.  But you did.  Of all people, and after all the times I've been harsh with you, insulted you, banished you from engineering.  No, Seven, it is I who needs to apologize to you.  Do you think you can forgive me for being such a jerk?"</p>
<p>"Yes, B'Elanna." was all Seven had to say and B'Elanna knew it.  She had been forgiven. This made her all the more in awe of her new friend  and she became even more committed to helping Seven recapture the joy stolen from her.  </p>
<p>"Truly I am Honored to be counted among your friends." And Seven knew just how profound a statement B'Elanna had made. And so it was with her best attempt at humor that Seven asked, " So PetaQ, where's my vanilla Coke?"  The Smile on her new friends face told her that her timing was...well  perfect. Three vanilla Cokes, and two  Shirley Temples later, ( not to mention a plate of banana pancakes, greasy cheeseburgers, and ice-cream sundaes) the two satiated friends parted company for the night.   </p>
<p>Captain Kathryn Janeway had the perfect plan to help along the recovery of her Chief Engineer's mending heart and it was with that thought that she called B'Elanna Torres to her ready room.</p>
<p>"You wanted to see me Captain?"  B'Elanna was feeling a bit uncomfortable, she realized she hadn't been in the Captain's ready room since she'd  broken down the day of her divorce three weeks early.  She hadn't been this formal to the Captain since her Maquis days.   </p>
<p>Janeway understanding at once tried to reassure her, "At Ease, B'Elanna.  How are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Just fine, Ma'am.  Engineering is running at optimal efficiency."</p>
<p>Janeway couldn't resist, " `optimal efficiency' you sound like Seven!", she didn't take the bait so the Captain continued.  </p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I was asking about you, not your department." At hearing herself  being compared to Seven the oddest thing happened.  In the past, even this little attempt at teasing would have been met with anger, even contempt.  But the only thing B'Elanna felt at her Captain's remark was a sense of pride at being likened to the former borg. Before she had time to process her feelings Janeway moved on to the reason she had called her in the first place.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, how would you like to take the Delta Flyer out on a scout mission?  Are food stores are practically bare.  Astrometrics has located three class M planets two sectors away." She was careful not to mention the name of which Astrometrics officer had done the survey, no need to aggravate the woman before her. She had not realized there had been a cessation of hostilities.   "While Voyager will be busy negotiating passage rights with the Galicians, I thought a scouting mission might get us a jump start on replenishing our cupboards."  </p>
<p>"Captain?", this had the lieutenant utterly confused.  Why would Janeway want her Chief Engineer off collecting edible plant samples?</p>
<p>Janeway could sense B'Elanna's puzzlement at once and dove right in, "The truth is B'Elanna, I thought you could use a week or so away from Voyager.  It might just help you to get your bearings straight.  Of course you can't go alone, I leave the choice of personnel  up to you...that is if you even want this mission?"</p>
<p>The thought of being away from Voyager for a week had real appeal.  Since her divorce she hadn't had any down time, except for one very happy evening spent with Seven.  She couldn't bring herself to use the holodeck.  Every time she tried she just kept wondering if Tom had been there first, doing God only knows what.  A week away from the engine room, away from crew members, who's eyes held looks of sympathy or worse, pity. A week away from hushed whispers  when she walked into the mess hall.  And mostly a week away from Tom Paris. It didn't take B'Elanna long to jump at the offer, and it took even less time for her to figure out who she wanted to spend a whole week alone with in the Delta Flyer.</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain...I'd like this mission."</p>
<p>Seven of Nine didn't know what to make of her most recent away team assignment.  She was utterly confused as to why the Captain would send two of her top senior officers on a scouting mission...for food no less.   The only thing that surprised Janeway about Seven's immediate  appearance was that she had used the door chime.</p>
<p>"Captain, explain yourself.  Why have you assigned me to this away mission?" The Captain  was enjoying her job today.  "You'll have to ask Lieutenant Torres that.  This is her mission, she requested you."  </p>
<p>The look on Seven's face was priceless.   Janeway would have given almost anything for a holo-imager. Once Seven composed herself the only response she gave was predictable, although Janeway felt it took `understatement' to a whole new level,</p>
<p>"Acceptable."  And with that the borg was off to pack her bags.</p>
<p>B'Elanna Torres couldn't remember the last time she had been this excited about a mission.  Hell, she couldn't remember the last time she had been this excited.  Just when she was starting to get a grip on why, or rather `who' she was getting all worked up about, as if on cue in walked Seven of Nine to the shuttle bay.  She was smiling.  More accurately she was grinning. B'Elanna noted a rather lopsided,`I'm not sure why I'm so happy, but I just can't stop myself from showing it' kind of grin.  She recognized it at once since she'd only just seen it on herself when she'd caught her reflection in an instrument panel.  </p>
<p>`Well sweet Kahless...I'm falling for the "Ice Princess"!' That thought neither upset, or bothered B'Elanna.  If anything it seemed to excite her all the more.   After deciding to reach out in friendship to Seven, it didn't take long to realize just how much they had in common.   They were both brilliant engineers. They both had a kind of split heritage, their `darker' side often eliciting fear from others and shame from within.  They always seemed to be struggling for acceptance from others, as well as themselves. B'Elanna fighting to reign in her emotions, Seven trying to loosen her control and experience her's. Once B'Elanna had realized this she understood Seven, her aloofness, her arrogance.   She had seen it in herself many times and now recognized it for what it was, an attempt to cover over insecurities.   But the woman before her was neither aloof, nor arrogant at the moment and all B'Elanna could do was smile back that  same goofy grin.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, all their gear stowed away, and preflight check done, the Delta Flyer was launched and the "foraging flight for food", as B'Elanna liked to call it, was under way. </p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres Mission Log, Star Date 54329:  Seven of Nine and I have just departed Voyager in the Delta Flyer.  We will be scanning three M class planets in this region of space in the hopes of discovering edible plant life to replenish Voyager's stores, while the ship and crew are negotiating  with the Galicians in the next sector over. Computer add current location and end log."</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, may I ask you a question?"</p>
<p>"You just did, but if you promise to call me "B'Elanna for the duration, I'll let you ask me another."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, Why did you request me for this mission?" One of the qualities that B'Elanna was learning she admired most about Seven was her bluntness.  She knew it made others uncomfortable, but she had long recognized the courage and honesty it took to confront others in this way.  So with out any hesitation she turned to look Seven straight in the eyes and said, "Because of all the people on Voyager that I'd want to share a week long mission with,  aboard a small space craft, looking for food stuffs, you're the only one that seemed to make it sound enjoyable." And with that she flashed a wicked grin, swivelled her chair back facing forward and attempted to lighten the highly charged cockpit with some levity.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna Torres - Personal log:   Star date...the day Annika Hanson, Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One agreed to accompany  the brave warrior/engineer B'Elanna Torres, Daughter of Miral from the House of Prasba, on the dangerous "foraging flight for food" mission. We have a whole week to ourselves to scan a few planets for roughage and try not to get into too much trouble.  I'm not so   sure we will succeed in this difficult task, but I will certainly try to... comply. Computer end log."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's attempt was successful and even earned her a smile from her companion; though they were not as rare as they had once been, it was still a treasure, to be sure.  The two fell into a relaxed conversation about life on Voyager, Mr. Neelix's latest attempt at cuisine, what projects were coming up in both engineering and Astrometrics.  The only lull in conversation was during dinner.  B'Elanna once again took it upon herself to introduce Seven's taste buds to the "wonderful world of fried foods."  Seven was soon learning how B'Elanna like to give everything a title, and was soon fast in thought trying to come up with one for B'Elanna herself.   </p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and pretty soon they were both ready to `regenerate' as Seven still called it .  In fact it had been months since she had been dependent on her alcove.  The Doctor finally being able to wean her from the daily necessity of regeneration.  Seven only hoped she would be spared from the disturbing nightmares on this trip, which had  become a fairly frequent occurrence.  Since being given her own quarters she had taken to sleeping in the nude.  It seemed utterly inefficient to replicate and clean a garment who's only function was to be worn while the wearer was unconscious and covered up further by bedding.  </p>
<p>However,  with the close quarters on board the Delta Flyer, Seven had the foresight to replicate what she hoped was an appropriate form of sleep-wear. And so with the computer at the helm, and sensors set to maximum the two women prepared for bed.  B'Elanna exited from the en suite and looked stunning, in what Seven could only guess had to be black pajamas made from silk.  </p>
<p>"B'Elanna, you are beautiful," Seven said this so softly that B'Elanna wasn't sure she had heard  right.  The growing blush on Seven's face and her quick departure into the john had told her she had.  Seven started to get nervous as she realized that her sleep-wear did not have bottoms.  It was a long fifteen minute wait for B'Elanna Torres, sitting up in the top bunk, when finally a somewhat reluctant ex-borg entered the room.</p>
<p>She was wearing what looked like an oversized button downed, collared dress shirt, made from cotton.  It was the palest shade of blue, which seemed to exaggerate the color in the wearer's eyes all the more.  From the front it was quite an appropriate length, and came to just above Seven's knees.  However, when she turned to her side to approach the bunks B'Elanna saw how the garment failed it's owner by exposing a exquisitely  long leg by falling to just below the waist.  Add to this the fact that Seven's hair was down, framing her face in an almost angelic effect, and B'Elanna was absolutely beside herself.  It was the sexiest thing she had ever seen. And in an instant it was gone, as Seven in one swift movement was in the bottom bunk, and calling for the computer to dim the lights.  B'Elanna just laid in her bunk, thanking Kahless for such a vision of loveliness.  </p>
<p>After a bit of tossing and turning from the lower bunk B'Elanna found the courage to speak, as she popped her head over the side, "Hey Seven, can I ask you something?"</p>
<p>Seven, feeling hesitant at first, looked up into what she decided were the most beautiful brown eyes in the universe and found all the assurance she needed to respond, "You already have, but if you promise to refer to me as Annika for the duration, then you may ask me another."</p>
<p>B'Elanna just stared in wonder at Seven for a moment, recognizing the significance of the step Seven had just made.  And even though she was pretty sure that Seven's response had unwittingly answered her question she went ahead and asked it anyway, if for no other reason then to be able to say this woman's name out loud.</p>
<p>"Annika, why did you accept this mission?"</p>
<p>"I had no intention to at first.  Then the Captain informed me that you had requested my presence.  Since this mission does not require the skill of an engineer, or a former borg drone I assumed you wished to continue deepening are friendship.  Since I also share that goal,  I was...pleased to accept this assignment. Was I in error?"</p>
<p>"No, you weren't mistaken.  Good night Annika."</p>
<p>"Sleep tight B'Elanna, don't let the `bed bugs bite'."  And with a smile on her face the proud warrior/engineer relaxed into slumber.  </p>
<p>It was some time later that B'Elanna's conscious mind started to stir at the soft, yet distressful noises from the lower bunk.  The instant her mind wrapped around the owner of those noises she woke up with a start, fully alert.  She jumped out of bed, literally, not even bothering to use the ladder. Seven's words were becoming more clear, and more agitated with each passing second. </p>
<p>"B'Elanna wasn't sure if she should wake her friend, or try to soothe her into a restful sleep. Before she could make up her mind Seven bolted upright, screaming, "Papa, help me!" This practically broke B'Elanna's hearts, as she knew all to well what Seven had been dreaming about.  She was sitting in Seven's bed, holding her from behind a second later.  </p>
<p>"Shhh, it's okay Annika, it was just a dream.  You're safe now.   The Borg wont get you. I'm here." And for the briefest of seconds, sitting in the dark, Annika believed it.  She believed she was safe.  She believed she was six years old again, being comforted by her mother after a bad dream.  Then she remembered.  She wasn't six anymore, the Borg did get her, and her parents. She was Seven of Nine, Astrometrics officer on The Star Ship Voyager.  When she realized this no amount of comforting words from B'Elanna could have stopped the flood gates from opening. As she turned to face the woman holding her, tears poured out that had been held back for far to long.  B'Elanna simply held Seven in her arms tighter and gently rocked her back and forth.  She knew all to well how much Seven needed this.   They fell asleep that way, and eight and a half hours later that's how they woke up.  And there wasn't the least bit of awkwardness, or apprehension felt by either one of them.  </p>
<p>The next few days followed in much the same manner.  While they went about on there mission, scanning and cataloging each planet for edible plants their friendship did in fact deepen.  Each night they would start out in separate bunks, only to find themselves waking up to the all too familiar cries of Seven. Both women were visibly disturbed by the stressful dreams, and yet neither were complaining of  the opportunity to hold each other close.  By the fourth night B'Elanna had a plan.  </p>
<p>"Look Annika, I have an idea that might help get rid of your nightmares....but you have to promise not to laugh or tell anybody when we get back to Voyager."</p>
<p>Seven was torn.  She didn't want to miss out on being held by B'Elanna, but she needed to be able to sleep through the night with out being disturbed by these painful images.  </p>
<p>"B'Elanna you have my word as your friend," Seven promised as her mind went through all the conceivable options B'Elanna would offer that would require such a pledge.   When B'Elanna reached up to her bunk and pulled out what looked like a  plush toy Seven was utterly confused.  She could tell it was a miniature targ, the Klingon equivalent of a dog, but she was unsure how this inanimate object was supposed to help her sleep. When she looked up from the `targ' at her friend she could see just how important this object was to the Klingon woman.  She saw the vulnerability in her eyes.  </p>
<p>It was with reverence that she took the furry animal as asked, "What is it?"</p>
<p>It was all B'Elanna could do not to laugh out loud and she realized just how silly it was for a woman her age to be sleeping with a stuffed animal.  Still, `Toby' had often comforted her in her most lonely hours, so she proceeded.  "This," she said with pride, "is Toby, my stuffed targ."</p>
<p>"Yes I see that, but how  will it protect me?"  Seven was still unclear how the whole thing worked.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna, being in too deep now to back out tried to explain, "Well,  I've often found that holding Toby while I sleep is very comforting."</p>
<p>Seven looked down at the worn creature in her hands with a renewed  respect.  </p>
<p>"How is this achieved?"  B'Elanna could hear the wonder in Seven's voice and found it utterly adorable.   </p>
<p>"Well, I don't know exactly.  It just does.  I've had Toby my whole life, my father gave it to me before I even knew what a targ was."</p>
<p>Seven was beginning to understand, "So you believe holding something that you are attached to, that you have a bond with, while trying to sleep can bring such comfort to a person as to be able to prevent the individual from having nightmares."</p>
<p>"Exactly!," B'Elanna wasn't feeling as silly anymore.  To hear Seven explain it with such logic made the whole thing sound scientific.  She wasn't expecting the next bit of Seven's logic though.</p>
<p>Seven handed back Toby to B'Elanna and explained why he wouldn't work, "I do not have an attachment to Toby, therefore it will not work."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could hear the disappointment in Seven's voice and it about broke her heart. </p>
<p>"Well what do you have an attachment to? We can replicate anything, it doesn't have to be Toby." Seven's face lit up as she approached the replicator and began programming in the specifications.  B'Elanna couldn't wait to see what kind of stuffed animal Seven would produce. It was with complete surprise that she found herself looking at a miniature version of herself. The gentle Klingon slope on it's forehead left no doubt about the identity of the doll.  Seven had a huge smile on her face as she showed off her new toy.  It was a stuffed version of the engineer, wearing her Starfleet uniform with Maquis insignia.  She had a little combadge and an isolinear spanner in one hand (Seven thought that added to the doll's authenticity).</p>
<p>B'Elanna was dumb struck.  "Seven?  You replicated....me?"</p>
<p>"Yes.  I have an attachment with you.  Have we not bonded over the last few days, the last few nights?  You did say I could chose anything.  I know this doll cannot provide me with as much comfort as I get from being held by you, but it may be able to provide me with enough to get me through the night with out having to bother you while you sleep."  </p>
<p>"Seven, holding you hasn't been a bother."  B'Elanna didn't know if she should tell Seven just how much she had enjoyed holding her.  She decided to take an alternate route,  "In fact I'm glad we came on this trip together, who knows how long you would have gone before telling anybody about these nightmares.  I don't want you experience any more pain in your life. You've already had more than your fair share."  </p>
<p>For the first time in Seven's brief life as an individual she found herself speechless.  B'Elanna took advantage of her friend's state and reached out to put her arms around her.  She gathered her up into a loving, yet platonic embrace.   She wasn't quite ready to risk Seven's heart, or her's for that matter, however she was becoming increasingly aware of just how strong her feelings were becoming for the beautiful blonde. </p>
<p>"Look Annika, why don't we just cut to the chase and share the bottom bunk?  Why use the stuffed B'Elanna when the real thing's available?" Seven recognized the logic of this suggestion at once, which is why she found her response to it so odd.  She was practically giddy, and once in bed, under the covers and in the arms of B'Elanna she found that sleep was the last thing on her mind.  For B'Elanna's part she found that holding this incredible woman was the closest thing to perfection she'd ever experienced in her life.  All the other nights when she had held her friend it had been to comfort her as a mother or sister would.  As B'Elanna lay in bed she was feeling anything but motherly, and certainly not sisterly.  </p>
<p>`Kahless, if holding Seven feels this good, what does kissing her feel like?'  She didn't like where this line of thinking was taking her, so she tried focusing on one of the meditation techniques Tuvok had taught her.   B'Elanna's last conscious thought before she drifted off to sleep was a silent prayer of thanks to Vulcan discipline.</p>
<p>As B'Elanna slowly became aware of her surroundings, the first thing she noticed was how incredibly soft her mattress was. The second thing she noticed was that it was breathing. At some point during the night the two women had switched positions, and now it was Seven who was holding B'Elanna.  She also realized that they had made it through the night without a nightmare.  </p>
<p>"Good morning," the mattress said looking down into the face of a very chagrined half Klingon.  </p>
<p>"You held out on me B'Elanna Torres!" Seven said this with a false anger that never reached her eyes.  "You failed to inform me how wonderful it is to do the holding."  And this is how the beginning of a very eventful day five of the "foraging flight for food"  was to begin.</p>
<p>They were hopeful as the Delta Flyer approached the third planet they had been sent to check out.  Neither of the first two planets had managed to provide much in the way of nutrition, and they had higher hopes for this last planet on their mission. As Seven took her seat next to B'Elanna she couldn't help noticing the change.   She had kept her hair down, which would have been noteworthy enough. Instead of wearing her usual skin tight "Super Woman" outfit, as some of the crew liked to call it, she was wearing a pair of casual khaki pants and a buttoned down shirt that was not altogether unlike her nightshirt, minus the collar.   Before she realized it, she was openly staring at the woman before her, not quite understanding why this outfit would be even more appealing then her biosuit.  Seven was quick to notice that her attire was having the desired effect on B'Elanna, and had to hold back from laughing.  </p>
<p>"Oh...um sorry Annika, I didn't mean to stare."</p>
<p>"No problem"</p>
<p>This B'Elanna had to question, " `No problem,' you sound like Tom!"</p>
<p>"Understandable, it is his expression.  The Doctor has been working with me on my diction...attempting to help me integrate more casual phrases into my speech.  He suggested I observe the crew and mimic certain common sayings."   </p>
<p>"Annika, you don't have to change the way you talk."</p>
<p>"I realize that, I'm just trying to `fit in' more." As the sensors came to life delivering relevant information on the planet just ahead of them Seven began repeating it not much louder then a mumble, "suitable atmosphere, rich mineral deposits, lots of dense vegetation."</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat unsure of herself, Seven looked up from her console and shouted, "Eureka!"  </p>
<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
<p>"Eureka!  Our mission goal is successful.  We have found a planet with enough vegetation to replenish Voyager for months."  As if that was supposed to explain her outburst.  </p>
<p>"Absolutely correct Annika, I was just a little...surprised with your new enthusiastic vocabulary."  B'Elanna wasn't quite sure how to tell Seven how silly such an antiquated phrase like `Eureka' sounded coming from her lips.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, we may have a problem.  This planet is inhabited by roughly seventeen million, six hundred fifty-three thousand, two hundred humanoids."</p>
<p>"I see the Doctor hasn't touched on the art of rounding off yet.  What part of that figure is `rough' exactly?" With all the bravado Seven could muster she looked B'Elanna straight in the eyes and said, "There are an additional two hundred, seventy three individuals that were left out of my initial report.  I didn't want to... overwhelm you with my figure, but perhaps it is to late for that?" </p>
<p>"Annika...are you flirting with me?"  B'Elanna didn't even try to keep the hope out of her voice. </p>
<p>Seven's face lit up as she swivelled her chair towards the front of the cockpit and away from the woman who was bringing joy back into her existence.   </p>
<p>"Yes, is it working?" But before B'Elanna was given a chance to respond Seven continued on..</p>
<p>Seven of Nine Personal log: Star date Today.....   As B'Elanna, warrior/engineer, and I approach the  third M class planet on our mission, it would appear that both our goals on our  "foraging flight for food" will be accomplished, however the fact that there are `lots of people' on the planet may complicate Voyager's attempt to restock on food stuffs. I also gladly report that B'Elanna has discovered a most pleasant cure for my unpleasant dreams that I look forward to having administered to me many more times. Computer-End log" </p>
<p>`Sweet Kahless, I'm ready to swear the Oath with this woman and I haven't even kissed her yet!' But before either woman could rectify that situation all hell broke lose on the Flyer. As the ship pitched violently back and forth both women worked frantically at the controls.  They were able to reach the M Class planet before the situation became to dire.  The computer reported the grim news, "Altitude adjustment off line.  Helm control off line"  </p>
<p>"Seven, reroute power from the weapons array."</p>
<p>"I can not comply."</p>
<p>"What, no cute slang for `we're gonna crash!' "</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, prepare for....a difficult landing."  As they both stole one last glance at each other that they really couldn't afford, they each saw the love they carried for the other reflected back at them.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna ditched the flyer in what she hoped was a deep lake.  As she regained consciousness she noticed that the flyer was floating but they were taking on water fast.  She was relieved to feel a pulse from the person she had not more then minutes earlier figured out was the love of her life.  She ran a tricorder over Seven; no broken bones, just unconscious with a concussion.  Every system on board was fried.  She strapped an emergency pack to her back and picked up Seven of Nine. Then she blew the hatch and jumped into the cold, but thankfully not freezing water.  She began swimming on her back, with her arm under Seven's arm and chest, careful to keep her head above water.  She was about two-thirds of the way to the shore when Seven began to wake up.  She decided to rest and see how Seven was doing.  As B'Elanna slid her arm free and shifted Seven around to face her she saw near terror in the ex-drone's face. Seven, starting to panic, began to flail her arms about and go under.  B'Elanna quickly dove down  and tried to grab Seven.  By this time Seven had begun to swallow a lot of water and was not helping in her own rescue attempt by clutching on to B'Elanna for dear life, almost causing them both to drown.  B'Elanna had to break free and resurface for air.  That being accomplished she dove under again and reached Seven from behind, pulling her to the surface.  She made it to the shore in record time and began to resuscitate her friend.  Seven's borg technology kicked in as she spit up all the water in her lungs, gasping and coughing for air the whole time.</p>
<p>B'Elanna started in on Seven once she realized she was going to be okay.  Anyone else would have been able to hear the fear and the love just beneath the anger, "You gotta be kidding me, you can't swim?  You almost got us both drowned.  Aren't there any pools in the collective?"</p>
<p>Seven's voice was filled with shame and fear, "It would appear the answer to that question is obvious.  Borg do not swim!  </p>
<p>The Hanson's also failed to instruct me.  I am sorry that I put your life in danger.  I have never felt so panicked before." Just hearing Seven talk had a calming effect on B'Elanna.  </p>
<p>And hearing the remorse in her words, especially the fact that Seven felt the need to apologize for never being taught to swim, made B'Elanna regret her harsh tone all together.   She knelt before Seven, taking her hands in her own and drawled back, "No problem."  She brought Seven's delicate fingers to her lips, gently kissing and caressing them to her cheek and continued, "I'm just glad I wasn't the one knocked out."</p>
<p>Seven tried to remain  placid, but failed completely when her standard response came out sounding more like a gasp than an answer, "Indeed..."   </p>
<p>This was the scene the rescue team of about twenty men stumbled upon at the shore of the lake.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was surprised at how similar this species looked to the Kazon, except they had lighter skin, with spots along the outside of their faces like the Trill.  'Oh, and much better hair,'she thought.</p>
<p>"Ladies are you alright?  Where is your Head-Mate?" the lead rescuer didn't seem to care that he was breaking the mood.</p>
<p>The last part got a confused glance from Seven before B'Elanna chose to answer the first part of his quarry, "Ah..yeah we're okay... I think.  Our shuttle lost power and helm control, so I put down in this lake of yours..."</p>
<p>This caused the senior officer to disregard the two women altogether, as he shouted out orders, "Get the marine rescue team out here on the double.  We have a down ship with a possible survivor."</p>
<p>"Wait, there's no one else!  Hey, excuse me...," B'Elanna hadn't felt this ignored since she was a child visiting the Klingon Home world.  Seeing that her friend was having no effect on the harried pace of the rescue team, Seven decided some borg exactness might help, "Gentlemen, there is no one to rescue.  We were unaccompanied in our shuttle."</p>
<p>"Impossible, you can't fly a shuttle by yourself," the officer was incredulous. </p>
<p>"Well that's apparent," he heard one of his men say under his breath.</p>
<p>Now the officer was getting agitated, "Where is your other Mate?  The two of you are clearly bonded, but where is your man?"  </p>
<p>"We have no man.  Why do you assume we are..."</p>
<p>But B'Elanna broke her off, not wanting to open that can of worms, decided to stick with protocol, "I am Lieutenant Torres, and this is Seven of Nine.  We are from the Star Ship Voyager.  We were on a scout mission looking to replenish our food supplies, when our shuttle malfunctioned, causing us a rather `difficult landing.' "  B'Elanna couldn't stop herself from using Seven's terminology for the crash, but this last part was said while glaring at the man who made the wise crake about her flying ability.</p>
<p>Another man came forward at this, possibly the second in command, "You two are officers...on a star ship?"</p>
<p>"Yes, why is that so hard to believe?"</p>
<p>"Well, your...a well, you're female," as if that explained it all.</p>
<p>"Yeah...What's your point?" was all B'Elanna could come up with.  </p>
<p>Seven, refusing to get flustered simply stated the truth, "I can assure you that our gender, as it pertains to our function on board Voyager, is irrelevant." This got a chuckle from the whole group of onlookers.  </p>
<p>"Look, if you could just take us to what passes as your headquarters, we can send a message to our ship and be out of your way."  As they started walking to their transport vehicles, the last comment B'Elanna heard before boarding was another condescending remark from another one of the lower officers, "The short one's cute when she gets all  riled up."  </p>
<p>Seven's stifled smile alerted B'Elanna that she had heard it too.  Not wanting to cause further agitation Seven knew better then to say anything at this time.</p>
<p>Captains Personal Log: It's been two days since we've heard from B'Elanna and Seven, and now they're not at the rendezvous site.  We are retracing their warp signature and are heading toward the third planet on their course to investigate.</p>
<p>As Captain Janeway walked on the bridge she took note of the worried looks of her crew. </p>
<p>"Mr. Paris, What's our ETA to the planet?"  </p>
<p>"Just under twelve hours Captain."</p>
<p>"Chakotay, I have a bad feeling about this."  </p>
<p>Not wanting to let the Captain get carried way by her gut, Chakotay tried to reassure his commanding officer, "We've scanned their course and haven't found any sign of debris.  We will find them.  If any two members of this crew can take care of themselves, it's these two.  That is if they can keep from tearing each other apart."</p>
<p>`Well he hasn't gotten the memo on the change in status of these two either,' was what the Captain thought.  All she could say was, "I just hope they're not in too much trouble."</p>
<p>Had the Captain been able to see her two crewmen at the moment she would not have only been relieved, but jealous as well. The accommodations the two were given were on a par with the finest resorts on Riza.  </p>
<p>They had come to understand that the attitude toward women on the planet was somewhat archaic.  B'Elanna had said, "Just this side up from a cave man and his club."  </p>
<p>Since these delicate creatures seemed to be without the benefit of a guardian, naturally the local government leader had to step in.  It didn't hurt that these two exotic women were gorgeous and that he was in the market for a new wife, or two.  The end result was that B'Elanna and Seven were being treated like visiting dignitaries, with the occasional condescending comment. Since having been assumed to be mates at the rescue sight the day before, they had both gone along with it.  It seemed like the attachment might offer them a little bit of protection from unwanted suitors, of which there seemed to be an unlimited supply. They were told that most men couldn't afford to take on two wives at once.  Both seemed to enjoy the illusion, as well as the solitary bed in their suite.  But neither woman questioned the other about it for fear of being rejected.  They simply continued in the fantasy, but had failed to consummate the relationship, even with a kiss.</p>
<p>The two women were kept up in their suite, it was inappropriate for them to be out in public unaccompanied by a male.  But B'Elanna was certainly making the most of this impromptu shore leave.  At the moment they were each getting a massage.   "That about does it Miss Torres.  Neala will be up in a little while to do your hair and nails."</p>
<p>"Ummm, thanks," was the most B'Elanna could get out (which wasn't lost on Seven). Her massage had a more abrupt finish, with one final slap on her backside, the masseuse was off. Seven sat up quickly, covering herself  with a sheet.  She hadn't realized just when she had become anxious about B'Elanna seeing her nude,  implants and all.  </p>
<p>"You enjoyed that woman touching you."  It wasn't a question and B'Elanna almost felt guilty for enjoying the massage, "Well yeah didn't you?"</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I do not care for these diversions.  It has been more then thirty hours since our message was said to be transmitted. The Captain would have at least contacted us by now.  I have reason to believe this species intention's are not what they seem.  And I fail to understand why we need are `hair and nails' done for yet another time!"</p>
<p>"I agree."  </p>
<p>"That is a relief.  For a moment I was beginning to believe that you were enjoying yourself." </p>
<p>"Please!  Do I look like a `hair and nails' kind of woman?" Seven opened her mouth to comment, but before she could </p>
<p>B'Elanna cut her off, "Don't answer that...I do admit that the massage wasn't half bad."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I find the demeaning attitude these men have for women completely unacceptable."</p>
<p>"Congratulations Annika, you are now ready to join the Federation.  No, seriously, you're right, Janeway would have been here by now.  I doubt they really sent our message.  We have to get access to a communication grid ourselves and resend the transmission."</p>
<p>"What do you suggest?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna had been formulating a plan all morning, now she had to see what Seven thought of it.  "Well, the local head of government doesn't seem to be satisfied with his current set of wives."</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>
<p>"What, you haven't noticed the way he gawks at us...at you in particular?"</p>
<p>"If that means he wants us for wives, than so does the rest of the planet." </p>
<p>"Well that may be true, but the rest of the planet can't afford us both.  Remember Sweetie?"  B'Elanna quite enjoyed throwing out these little terms of endearment since they had been declared `mates'.  She especially enjoyed the looks she got from Seven.  They were usually a combination of confusion and pleasure. B'Elanna added, "Not to mention, he keeps calling here to invite us to his home for dinner tonight."  </p>
<p>"And you have a plan?"</p>
<p>"Yes.  We pretend to be charmed by him, request to be alone with him and drink him under the table.  Once that's done we find the communication grid and contact the ship."</p>
<p>"Well, your plan lacks a certain sophistication, but with the way they underestimate women here it just might work."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the endorsement wife...just let me do the drinking!" </p>
<p>With `hair and nails' done for yet another time, all that was left for the two women to do was pick out an outfit for their evening.  B'Elanna chose a sleek red dress that went to just below the knees.  She could barley sit, but she knew the effect would be stunning.  She was quite excited to see what Seven would come up with, as she stood out on the balcony patiently.   As she waited, she couldn't help feeling nervous, like she was about to go on her first date with `Annika Hanson'.  It was with real regret, she realized, that she would showering her attentions onto a complete stranger, instead of the woman who had recently become the object of her desire.  The fact that Seven would be doing the same multiplied her anxiety tenfold.</p>
<p>When Seven joined her outside the first thing she thought was, `Sweet Kahless she's beautiful.'  The second thing she thought was, `My God, I want to take her to bed and never leave."  The third thing she thought was, `Why isn't she ready for this damn dinner, we're gonna be late.'</p>
<p>Seven was getting better at reading B'Elanna's facial expression's and was amused as she watched the changes go first from admiration and joy, to desire, and finally to confusion and mild annoyance.</p>
<p>"Annika, what's wrong, how come you're not ready?" It was Seven's turn to be confused.  She was wearing the same outfit that she had on right before the Flyer crashed; the one B'Elanna had seemed to like so much.  Before Seven could explain herself she became speechless when she saw what B'Elanna was wearing.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, misunderstanding Seven's silence, started to get nervous and walked to within a breath of her.   Cupping her face delicately with one hand as she softly spoke, "What is it sweetie?  Are you alright?"  The contact and physical proximity of this beautiful creature before her only served to make Seven even more flustered, but seeing real fear in B'Elanna's eyes brought her back to reality.</p>
<p>"You are...exceptional," Seven barely spoke this out loud.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>She tried again, "You make it difficult for me to speak. You are beautiful B'Elanna Torres."</p>
<p>At hearing the complete adoration in Seven's voice B'Elanna lost all thoughts of being late and started contemplating much more important things, like how alluring Seven's lips were, and how completely captivated she was by this woman.  With out further delay B'Elanna delivered herself into the arms of her former nemesis and gently brushed her lips to Seven's.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna knew this was probably Seven's first kiss, and she was determined to make this `first' special.  She devoted herself entirely to this moment in time.  The kiss lingered; there was no rush to it. It was soft at first, inviting as B'Elanna sought entry into this woman's heart.  As her hand continued to faintly caress her face, B'Elanna patiently sucked and nibbled at her bottom lip, pulling Seven's mouth deeper into her own.  </p>
<p>Seven had never felt anything more wonderful, and then it got better.  For a split second she was perplexed, then she realized what she was feeling was B'Elanna's tongue seeking permission to enter her mouth, which she granted with an aroused sigh.  As B'Elanna's tongue circled her own something in Seven was awakened.  Her compulsion to feel B'Elanna, to touch every part of her was almost frantic, and yet she reveled in it.  She pulled B'Elanna to her closer, circling her hands around her waist. As the kiss deepened she dropped her hands to B'Elanna's perfectly shaped bottom and lifted the shorter woman off the ground. In response to this B'Elanna let out a growl, that sounded more like a sweet purr to Seven.  Seven was thrilled beyond understanding that her ministrations could produce such a delightful sound from this seductive woman.  Only the need for air brought this, their first kiss, to an end.</p>
<p>"Wow," breathlessly spoken by B'Elanna, was answered with an equally breathless,</p>
<p>"Indeed," from Seven. And then, "I would like to do that again." This brought a warm smile to B'Elanna's face.  </p>
<p>It took every bit of discipline she had to pull back from Seven's embrace.  She let her arms slip from around Seven's waist and had to settle for holding her hands, not yet ready to give up all contact with her yet.  </p>
<p>"I too would like to kiss you again, but right now we are late for our `date', and you're not even dressed yet."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?  I am completely dressed."  After seeing the formal evening wear B'Elanna had on she knew exactly what B'Elanna meant, but she had learned enough the last few days not to let an opportunity to tease ....or possibly induce a blush, slip by. </p>
<p>"Annika, I know you're `dressed' dressed.  I mean dressed... for the dinner."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, is it not our intention to distract and `lead on' this man in order to get him inebriated, thus rendering him unconscious, allowing us free access to contact the ship."  </p>
<p>"Yes, that's a very official way of putting it.  Remind me to let you write the report on this one."</p>
<p>"Then judging by your response to my outfit, both on the shuttle and just now, I believe this attire to be perfect." B'Elanna had to admit she had a point, but all she could think to say was, "Oh."  And Seven was indeed rewarded with a blush from B'Elanna.  </p>
<p>"Very well, I shall change into something more appropriate. I will be ready in five minutes."</p>
<p>The dinner had gone exactly as they had planned.  As Seven predicted they were totally underestimated.  It took a mere inquiry from Seven for the dining chamber to be emptied of guards.  B'Elanna was amazed at how masterful Seven was at flirting. The alcohol that was served was strong, but B'Elanna was stronger and for one of the very few times in her life she sent up a silent prayer of thanks to her mother for her Klingon DNA.  It would take only a bit of this grain based drink to effect Seven, unfortunately to keep up appearances Seven had been forced to drink just that amount.  By the fifth course of the meal the local head of state was soundly passed out, Seven was well on her way to intoxication, and B'Elanna was quite happy. This combination of circumstances made for not the most efficient of escape attempts.  First they dragged their `date' into his outer office.  This way the servants would simply assume they had all retired upstairs.  As B'Elanna searched for the communication devise, it was all she could do to keep focused as Seven's drunken advances seemed far more interesting than a `silly communication grid' as Seven had taken to calling it.  After twenty minutes of searching, twelve Klingon expletives, and nearly two dozen passes from Seven, B'Elanna finally found what she was looking for.  It didn't take long for her to figure out the device, even in her current state.</p>
<p>Before she knew it she had contacted Voyager and a moment later Kathryn Janeway was on the view screen.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, Is everything alright?  We were beginning to worry about you two."</p>
<p>Before B'Elanna could answer her Captain, a drunk, and strong ex-borg pushed her out of the way and began to report, "Kathryn, How are you?  We have missed you as well!  Haven't we B'Elanna?"</p>
<p>As if Seven's formal dress didn't draw enough attention, her use of both the Captain's and the Chief Engineer's first names had the attention of every bridge officer riveted to the forward view screen.  You could hear a muffled protest from B'Elanna in the background.</p>
<p>"We've been adrift with out them.  Now let me talk."</p>
<p>"Now, now sweetie, don't be that way.  You ARE cute when you get all riled up!  Remember, you wanted me to give the report." The Captain, seeing that her two crewmen were alive and well, and apparently on a very friendly terms couldn't quite keep the amusement out of her voice, "Seven, are you drunk?"</p>
<p>"Yes Kathryn, I am quite inebriated.  But I assure you, it was done for official duty.  I would much rather be back in my room kissing my wife some more."  Which is exactly what Seven proceeded to do, with not an ounce of resistance from B'Elanna.  It was a short kiss, but the passion was plain for all to see.  </p>
<p>"Wife?" this from Tom.  He still had hopes of winning back B'Elanna.</p>
<p>At hearing Tom's voice, B'Elanna forced herself to focus on the transmission and not the gorgeous woman who she had planned to make her wife for real.  </p>
<p>"Captain, it's a long story.  Our shuttle crashed on this Neanderthal planet.  Apparently the only thing they think women are good for is becoming multiple wives.  Upon seeing us together they assumed we were mates.  They refused to send a message to you, so we...," but this is as far B'Elanna got in the report, Seven deciding to cut in.</p>
<p>"...acting as perfect mates, distracted and `led on' the local governing official with our attire in order to get him inebriated, thus rendering him unconscious, allowing us free access to contact the ship.  Sweetheart, your plan has worked.  You are brilliant my `Warrior/Engineer' whom I am in love with."  Seven's words sent B'Elanna's head spinning, as she took hold of Seven's hands in her own. </p>
<p>Even the Captain's sarcasm didn't seem to spoil the mood, "Yes, Lieutenant, I look forward to hearing about all the intricate details of you plan when we get you back...which should be in just under an hour.  Can you two lay low until then?"</p>
<p>"I think my wife and I  can find something to occupy ourselves with Captain."</p>
<p>"Indeed," was the last thing the bridge crew heard as the view screen returned to a star field. </p>
<p>It was Chakotay who said out loud what many were thinking, "They do seem to be perfect mates."</p>
