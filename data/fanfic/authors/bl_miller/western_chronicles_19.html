<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 19: Moving On -->

<p>After a quick breakfast and cup of coffee, the pair headed over
		to the corral to retrieve the horses and put Tombstone behind them. Since they were going
		to be on the road again, Rebecca had changed from her worn dress to her britches and
		shirt. Once at the corral, Josie went to pay the owner while Rebecca went in to feed the
		horses a few apples. They weren't ripe enough for humans, but the animals didn't seem to
		mind. Rebecca was still intimidated by the palomino's sheer size, but was bound and
		determined to make friends with the horse. The gray mare in the next stall whinnied and
		nudged her with her nose every time Rebecca turned her attention to the big palomino. Even
		though the little horse had been with them for some time, it was the first time Rebecca
		had ever really looked at her. The little horse had a gentle, sweet expression; Rebecca
		could almost swear she was smiling. "Now stop pushing me," she squealed as she
		backed up out of reach. "Oh, you're a cute one," she said, stepping in front of
		the gray horse's stall. She held out one apple, which the horse took eagerly. Rebecca took
		advantage of the busy mouth and stroked the mare's nose. "Oh, you like that, don't
		you?", she cooed. Phoenix nickered in protest and she complied with another apple.
		"Now don't be jealous Phoenix." She went back to scratching the gray horse.
		"I don't remember you being so friendly before," she said as she started to use
		both hands to scratch and rub the smaller horse, who snorted with enjoyment. She didn't
		hear Josie enter the stable and lean up against one of the supports.</p>

		<p>"Do you like her?" Her voice caused Rebecca to jump
		slightly. </p>

		<p>"Well, as far as horses go, she's fine." She almost
		added a comment about the mare being friendlier than Phoenix but decided against it. </p>

		<p>"She's yours," Josie said. Rebecca turned around and
		looked at her with a look of confusion.</p>

		<p>"I...I guess I have been thinking of her as mine ever
		since...."</p>

		<p>Josie laughed and shook her head. "Rebecca, this isn't the
		horse we picked up...back there." She pointed to a stall on the opposite end of the
		stable. "That's the horse we've had with us all along." Rebecca looked from one
		horse to the other, and could not imagine how she had mistaken this sweet little mare for
		that one. </p>

		<p>"Really? Oh Josie," she moved over and wrapped her arms
		around the taller woman's waist as she gave her a hug.</p>

		<p>"Really," she answered as she extricated the younger
		woman's arms from around her body. "Rebecca, I don't like to be hugged."</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry," she said, but the twinkle never left her
		green eyes. "How did you come by this horse?"</p>

		<p>Josie shrugged as if it was no big deal. "She was with the
		man I brought in for the bounty. Her and the buckboard. Since her disposition seemed
		more...suitable for you, I decided to sell the other horse and keep this one for
		you."</p>

		<p>"Buckboard? You mean I won't have to walk everywhere or ride
		behind you?" She gave a look up at Phoenix, her eyes showing her dislike of riding
		upon the massive steed.</p>

		<p>"It would seem that way." With the look of happiness in
		Rebecca's eyes, Josie didn't have the heart to mention that it was still a short-term
		arrangement. "Let's get them ready."</p>

		<p>An hour later they were on the road again. They rode on the flat
		wagon, Josie handling the reins for the mare while Phoenix walked behind, tethered to the
		back of the buckboard. Rebecca sat next to the gunslinger, holding the Winchester in case
		Josie needed it. Time passed while she related the different things she had learned from
		Doc Jackson's medical book and tales of American history. At some point, she decided that
		since the mare was her horse she had to give her a name. "Flossy," she said.</p>

		<p>"Flossy?" Josie gave her a look. "You've got to be
		kidding."</p>

		<p>"Nope. I like it. Do you like it, Flossy?" To Josie's
		dismay, the mare whinnied in agreement with the new name from the honey-voiced woman.
		"Flossy it is then."</p>

		<p>"Flossy," Josie said as she rolled her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Hey, be nice. I could have named her Petunia."</p>

		<p>"Flossy is fine."</p>

		<p>"I thought you'd see it my way," Rebecca said smugly,
		proud to have won the argument. Josie smirked.</p>

		<p>"Just remember that you are responsible for 'Flossy'. You
		have to feed and brush her and take care of her gear."</p>

		<p>"Oh sure, Josie. I'll do a good job too, you just
		watch."</p>

		<p>"Uh huh," the gunslinger said in a knowing tone. There
		was no doubt in her mind that Rebecca would do everything in her power to please her or
		prove that she should stay with her. What Josie didn't want to admit to herself was that
		it was working. After taking care of Smith, there really wasn't a reason that Rebecca
		couldn't have stayed in Tombstone, except that Josie wouldn't be able to keep an eye on
		her then.</p>

		<p>They traveled northeast, hoping to reach Wilcox by nightfall. It
		was an insignificant small town and wouldn't have been worth stopping in at all except
		that it was the last place they could get supplies before reaching the Oxbow Route. Josie
		drove the wagon with Phoenix tethered behind while Rebecca sat next to her. The Winchester
		leaned on the seat between them, within easy reach should the gunslinger need it. The hot
		summer sun beat down on them unmercifully, making Josie regret her choice in clothing. The
		black long sleeved shirt and britches only served to absorb the heat, not to mention her
		Stetson, which quickly found its way into the back of the wagon. It wasn't long before the
		top three buttons on her shirt were open in a futile attempt to cool off.</p>

		<p>"Damn it's hot," she muttered as she wiped her brow
		again. The gray bandanna usually wrapped around her neck was now soaked with sweat and
		grime as she used it to keep the perspiration from running down her face. The dust from
		the road stuck to her skin, only serving to add to her discomfort. Her legs felt like they
		were on fire as the dark britches continued to soak in the heat. There was no sign of
		trees or shade anywhere. Rebecca wordlessly handed her the canteen of water. Josie tipped
		it up and took a large swallow before making a face and handing it back. "Ugh, that
		water's hot enough to make coffee," she grumbled.</p>

		<p>"Sorry," Rebecca said before pulling out two pieces of
		jerky and handing one to the gunslinger. Josie shook her head.</p>

		<p>"If I eat that, I'll have to drink more of that rancid
		water. No thanks."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca was never happier to see the sun setting before in her
		life. By mid-afternoon, Josie's mood was decidedly foul from being overheated and the
		young woman was afraid to say a word for fear of getting her head bitten off. They passed
		a small ranch and both let out a sigh of relief. Wilcox couldn't be much further ahead.
		"We'll rest in town for the night," Josie said, keeping her eyes straight ahead.
		"The horses need to rest and I need a bath."</p>

		<p>"Yes you do," she agreed, wrinkling her nose. Josie
		turned and looked at her.</p>

		<p>"Hey..." she said, feigning hurt. "You don't smell
		so good yourself."</p>

		<p>Rebecca thought the gunslinger was being serious until she saw a
		twinkle in the blue eyes and a small grin appeared. She smiled and let out a soft laugh.
		Josie turned her attention back to the dusty road. "We'll get cleaned up and let
		someone else cook dinner," she said. Now that the sun was setting and she was
		beginning to cool off, Josie felt bad about the way that she had snapped at the young
		woman she was beginning to consider a friend. Her brow furrowed. When was the last time
		she cared about anyone else's feelings? It only took a few seconds for her to decide that
		it had been far too long. "Maybe we can even pick up a new dress for you while we're
		there," she said, noting the smile that came across Rebecca's face.</p>

		<p>Since they were only staying the one night, Josie decided to
		splurge and get two rooms at the hotel instead of the flophouse. After bathing, they went
		downstairs to the combination saloon/restaurant and had a hearty meal of stew and
		cornbread. Josie had several mugs of beer while Rebecca sipped on her sarsaparilla. The
		heat from the day and their full bellies dictated an early evening and both retired
		immediately after dinner.</p>

		<p>Josie awoke in the middle of the night, her dreams too much to
		bear. Again and again she saw the face of the young girl looking up at her, her chest
		completely covered with blood. She got out of bed and splashed some water on her face from
		the basin. Knowing that sleep would now be impossible, she settled into a chair and waited
		for the sun to rise.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was sleeping soundly when Josie entered her room with two
		cups of coffee. "Time to get up, Rebecca," she said as she set the cups on the
		small table. Seeing no movement from the young woman, she kicked the bed with her booted
		foot, but not with much force.</p>

		<p>"Grmphf."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, let's go. I want to get our supplies and get on
		the road early." She waited another moment, then jerked the blanket off of the
		sleeping girl. She never expected what happened next.</p>

		<p>The young woman yelped and curled up into a ball, pressing
		herself against the wall. Her arms covered her head and her whole body shook in fear.
		Josie took a step back. "Rebecca?" she said softly. Slowly the young woman moved
		her arms and looked up at her.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled. "Guess you just
		surprised me." She crawled off the bed and headed for the chamber pot in the corner.
		Josie kept her back to her until she heard the scraping of the chair against the floor
		then turned around and took her seat. There was an awkward silence as each woman remained
		deep in her own thoughts. Josie watched Rebecca out of the corner of her eye. Rebecca's
		face and body betrayed every emotion as she fought to regain some kind of composure. She
		drained half of her coffee before speaking. When she did, her voice still carried a bit of
		shakiness to it. "Please don't wake me up like that again." Memories of her
		father coming in to wake her up, angry and sometimes violent flooded her mind. There were
		too many times that the blanket being pulled back wasn't enough to wake her after sitting
		up half the night reading books that he didn't know she had and she'd find herself being
		woken up by him pulling her out of bed roughly. She involuntarily shuddered at the memory.</p>

		<p>"I won't," Josie said. She wanted to ask what it was
		that had frightened her so, but comforting and personal conversations were foreign to her
		now and she wasn't sure she could handle all the emotions that went with caring that much
		about someone else. She finished her coffee and stood up. "I'll meet you
		outside."</p>

		<p>Rebecca changed into her dress, frowning at the way it looked. At
		dinner last night she was embarrassed to wear such a tattered thing in such a nice place,
		but unlike Josie, she couldn't walk around town in britches. No one dared question someone
		as tall and well armed as the gunslinger about her clothes, but a small thing like herself
		would only bring about trouble wandering around like that.</p>

		<p>Josie was leaning against a post when Rebecca finally exited the
		hotel. The gunslinger looked at the faded and slightly tattered dress and grimaced.
		"The first thing we're doing is moseying over to the dressmaker's and getting you a
		new dress."</p>

		<p>Rebecca thought about offering to make a dress herself, but
		something inside told her that the gunslinger wanted to buy this dress for her. She nodded
		and allowed herself to be led to the dressmaker.</p>

		<p>The dressmaker was a large woman, easily twice the weight of
		Josie and three times the girth. The top of her dress barely held her more than ample
		bosom as she walked over to talk to them. "I'm Rita, owner and seamstress. And just
		what'll ye be looking for today, missies?"</p>

		<p>"She needs a new dress," Josie said. "Something
		simple and easy to care for." She looked quickly at the wide expanse of skin showing
		from the front of the seamstress's dress. "And not revealing."</p>

		<p>Rita wondered if she should have been insulted, but answered.
		"Aye, a simple traveling dress, perhaps? Something in a calico?" she said as she
		moved over to a rack containing several simple dresses of varying colors and sizes. She
		removed a dress from the rack and held it up so both women could see it. It was a light
		green checkered pattern with long sleeves and a high lace neck that Rebecca was sure would
		choke her. She was just about to voice her opposition to it when Josie nodded.</p>

		<p>"That'll be fine." She turned to Rebecca and said.
		"You stay here and wait for the dress, and I'll go get the supplies." She strode
		to the door and grasped the knob, then turned back. "And Rebecca..."</p>

		<p>"Yes?"</p>

		<p>"Don't leave." There was something about the tone in
		Josie's voice that made the young blonde swear it was less of a statement and more of a
		question.</p>

		<p>"I won't."</p>

		<p>Josie nodded then left in search of the rest of their supplies.
		Rebecca resigned herself to her fate and let the large woman fit her for the dress. As she
		was being turned and pinned she swore to herself that the instant they were out of town
		she was changing back into to her britches. She smiled as she imagined what it would be
		like to see her tall companion wearing a dress.</p>

		<p>Josie returned almost two hours later with the wagon loaded down
		with a variety of supplies and staples. A small washboard was securely tied to the side of
		the wagon, while the back area contained as many supplies as Josie could afford. She
		wasn't the least bit happy with the cost. The largest sack contained oats for both horses.
		Unwilling to ask for assistance, Josie hefted the sack herself, pulling a muscle in her
		lower back in the process. She was glad when Rebecca bounded out of the shop, new dress in
		hand, and climbed up into the wagon without assistance. The gunslinger waited until the
		young woman placed her new garment carefully in the small trunk under the seat then
		clicked Flossy into motion. The forward jerk reverberated through her sore muscle, causing
		Josie to take a sharp breath.</p>

		<p>"Josie? Are you okay?" Rebecca looked at her carefully,
		searching for any sign of injury, wondering if the outlaw had been in another saloon
		fight.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine," she replied, her eyes never leaving the
		road ahead as they pulled out of town.</p>

		<p>"You sure?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...." She said in an annoyed tone.</p>

		<p>"Sorry," the young woman said. Several minutes passed
		before she spoke again. "Josie, have I told you the story about Daniel Boone? No?
		Well..." she burst into her tale, knowing full well that the gunslinger was only
		half-listening, but preferring to hear her own voice over the howls of the coyotes in the
		distance. Several hours and tales later, Josie pulled the wagon off the trail and chose a
		spot to set up camp for the night.</p>

		<p>Pulling the horse to a stop, Josie waited for Rebecca to get down
		before slowly getting down herself. The sore muscle aggravated by hours of sitting on the
		wooden bench made itself known as soon as she tried to straighten out and stretch. Rebecca
		had just walked around to that side of the wagon and saw the unmasked look of pain on her
		face. "Josie, you're hurt!"</p>

		<p>"No," she said softly. "Just a sore back, that's
		all."</p>

		<p>"I could rub it for you. I mean, I still have some liniment
		and I got pretty good at rubbing my own muscles when they were sore."</p>

		<p>Josie looked at her for a moment before making her decision. She
		reached behind her back and tried to reach the protesting muscle herself. She nodded and
		watched the smile break out on Rebecca's face. "Great. I'll move this stuff out of
		the wagon and you can..."</p>

		<p>"No. That sack..." she said pointing to the oats,
		"...is what gave me this. We'll have to sleep on the ground tonight. You should be
		used to it by now."</p>

		<p>"Sure, no problem." She turned and started to remove
		the items they would need to camp on the ground. "No problem..." she whispered
		to herself. "I should be used to sleeping on the hard ground, uh huh, sure. Much more
		comfortable than, oh, say a padded wagon back, yup."</p>

		<p>"Quit bellyaching or I will make you empty out the wagon,
		including the sack of oats," Josie said, but her tone made it clear that she wasn't
		being serious. Both chuckled at the thought of her trying to lift the large, heavy sack.</p>

		<p>Josie lay down on the blanket and let Rebecca deal with setting
		up the small camp and getting the fire started. They ate a hearty stew, washed down by
		Josie with a mug of ale from the small keg on the wagon while her companion settled for
		tepid water from the larger keg. Only when all the dishes were wiped and put away and the
		shotgun was placed within easy reach of her hands did the gunslinger finally remove her
		shirt and settle on her stomach while Rebecca knelt down next to her and opened the bottle
		of liniment. "Where exactly?" the young woman asked as she placed her fingers
		down lightly near Josie's spine.</p>

		<p>"Lower...okay, over to the left...ow, right there...."</p>

		<p>"Like this?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah...just like that...." Josie closed her eyes and
		rested her cheek against her forearms as she relaxed under the gentle ministrations.</p>

		<p>"I'll tell you a story...." Rebecca spoke gently as her
		hands continued to gently massage the muscles in the bounty hunter's lower back.
		Everywhere her hands moved she felt the tightness and tension and she worked slowly to
		loosen and relax every muscle she found.</p>

		<p>"That reminds me of a story my mother used to tell me when I
		was a little girl," Josie murmured when the story was finished. She made no effort to
		stop Rebecca from massaging up her back. "You do that good, you know?"</p>

		<p>"Thank you," she replied. "Would you like me to
		tell another story?" Her fingers kneaded and rolled over Josie's back, washing away
		months of tension. Getting no answer, Rebecca began another story, and another, and
		another as time rolled by. Several times she felt the gunslinger jerk, but she could tell
		that it was from the pain, not her touch. Her arms began to ache by the time she finally
		sat back. "How was that?"</p>

		<p>Josie turned her head and looked at her young companion before
		sitting up and stretching. She rolled her head and twisted her back, allowing a small
		smile to come to her lips. "It feels better," she said before reaching over and
		grabbing her sleeping shirt. Rebecca tried not to let her disappointment at not getting a
		better compliment show.</p>

		<p>"Good. Well, I guess I'll go to bed. Goodnight." She
		rose and headed to the other side of the fire.</p>

		<p>"'Night," Josie replied as she watched the young woman
		settle into her blankets. She arched her back one more time, relishing the limberness.
		"Thank you, Rebecca," she said just loud enough for Rebecca to hear before
		turning over and facing away from her, but not before seeing the smile on the young
		woman's face. Josie made a mental note to compliment her more often.</p>
