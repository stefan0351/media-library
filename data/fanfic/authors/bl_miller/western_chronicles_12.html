<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 12: Lessons -->

<p>"If you're gonna ride with Josie, you need to learn some
		things. You do want to be helpful, don't you?", Belle said as she handed the young
		woman a mug of coffee. </p>

		<p>"Anything, name it. I'll learn anything," Rebecca said
		enthusiastically. </p>

		<p>"How are you at sewing?" She almost laughed at the
		stricken look on the blonde girl's face. </p>

		<p>"I can't sew to save my soul." </p>

		<p>"Well, you're gonna learn, my dear. Wounds need to be
		stitched, not to mention clothing. A neat row of small, tight stitches helps to prevent
		infection and disease. Now you wouldn't want Josie to go through life with a jagged scar
		'cause you didn't stitch it right, now would you?", Belle said as she rose and pulled
		out a small sewing basket from under the counter. </p>

		<p>"No, of course not." She looked at the materials being
		laid out in front of her with trepidation. "But you mean I'd have to actually do
		that...put a needle...into her skin?", she paled at the thought. </p>

		<p>"Just think of it as soft leather." She placed a needle
		in Rebecca's hand. "Now let's get started." </p>

		<p>An hour later, Rebecca held up a two small pieces of leather sewn
		together. Belle took it from her and held it up to the light. She shook her head.
		"Does that seam look straight to you?" Before Rebecca could even reply she
		pulled a small knife from her belt and cut the threads apart. "Try again, and this
		time pay attention to the seam, not just the stitches." </p>

		<p>Hours later an extremely frustrated Rebecca handed Belle her
		latest effort, fully expecting it to be pulled apart again. The older woman went through
		her usual routine to inspect it. "Not bad. Quite an improvement over when we began,
		now wouldn't you say?" she added as she handed it back to the young woman. Rebecca
		turned it over in her hands, noting that it did indeed look better than her first
		attempts. Belle collected the loose materials and put them back in the basket.
		"Starting tomorrow, you practice your stitching for one hour each morning and one
		hour each night. Work on straight seams and jagged ones. Mend your clothing to fit you
		properly. If I see one seam out of line, I'll tear the whole thing apart and make you
		start over." </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>After a week Josie was up on her feet and starting to feel a bit
		anxious to leave. With the aid of a cane she walked over to her window and looked out.
		Rebecca was sitting under a tree, taking advantage of the afternoon shade. The outlaw's
		keen eyes picked out that the young woman was sewing, all of her attention on her task. A
		soft knock on the door interrupted her. "Come in, Belle." Belle was pleased to
		see Josie on her feet. She could not help but notice that the gunslinger's eyes were
		riveted on the attractive young blonde out in the yard. </p>

		<p>"She's pretty spunky, that one," Belle said with a
		chuckle. "Been practicing her stitching all the time." She walked up behind the
		outlaw and joined her in watching the young woman. "She's trying to impress
		you." </p>

		<p>"She's afraid I'm going to leave her behind somewhere."
		</p>

		<p>"Are you?" Hearing no answer, Belle continued.
		"How long has she been traveling with you?" </p>

		<p>"Not long. This isn't a permanent arrangement." </p>

		<p>"Well, it don't hurt none for her to know how to stitch
		people up." </p>

		<p>Josie moved from the window back to the bed. "Nope, I don't
		suppose it does." </p>

		<p>Even though Belle offered her the use of the other unoccupied
		bedroom, Rebecca preferred to sleep on a pallet on the floor in Josie's room, explaining
		that she wanted to be close in case Josie needed something. She was awakened one night by
		the sounds of the tall woman thrashing about in her bed. When Josie cried out as if in
		pain, Rebecca leapt to her feet and groped her way to the bed in the darkness. </p>

		<p>"Nooo," Josie moaned as she violently shook her head
		from side to side. Without hesitation, Rebecca climbed up onto the bed with the outlaw.
		She slid her arm under her shoulder and pulled Josie's head to her chest. Gently she ran
		her hand over Josie's sweat drenched forehead and hair, and softly she began to sing.
		</p>

		<p>Belle was also wakened by the sounds of the gunslinger, but she
		immediately recognized it for the nightmare it was. Josie had always been plagued by
		nightmares, often times calling out in remembered pain long into the night. Belle
		considered going to see if there was something she could do, when she heard the sweet
		strains of 'Beautiful Dreamer' in a clear and beautiful voice. The sounds of Josie's
		nightmare were no longer audible; with a smile Belle relaxed back onto her own bed,
		listening to the young girl sing. </p>

		<p>When Josie's breathing was once again deep and even and her brow
		no longer furrowed, Rebecca eased herself out from under the sleeping woman. She actually
		hated to leave the comforting warmth of Josie's body, but she was afraid she would fall
		asleep herself, and the thought of what Josie would do if she found her there was enough
		to send her back to her pallet on the floor. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>After healing from her gunshot wound, Josie helped Belle mend the
		roof and do other repairs around the small ranch. Every so often Rebecca would come into
		view, usually caring for one of the horses or hauling buckets of water. The outlaw noted
		that not once had she heard her young companion complain of all the hard labor. </p>

		<p>Rebecca worked as hard as she could, trying to prove to both
		women that she was capable of pulling her own weight. Belle was more forthcoming with the
		compliments, but it was the rare look of approval in Josie's face that encouraged her to
		continue on when her limbs ached and her muscles screamed. The liberal amounts of liniment
		helped, but only slightly. </p>

		<p>The extra time devoted to practicing her stitches showed in
		Rebecca's newly tailored clothes. Knowing that she would be expected to wear pants if she
		wanted to ride double with Josie, she determined to make the clothes that they had taken
		from the dead man fit her as well as Josie's fit her. She succeeded more than she would
		have imagined. She no longer had to push her sleeves up just to see her hands. Her
		britches were now the right length and no longer required a belt to stay up. There was no
		mistaking the pride in her face when she showed off her outfit for the first time. </p>

		<p>"Wonderful, Rebecca," Belle said as she inspected the
		seams. "When you first picked up the needle you couldn't stitch a straight line. Now
		look what you've done. Child, you can do anything you set your mind to if you only
		try." </p>

		<p>Rebecca looked over to Josie. "Better," was all the
		outlaw said, but the small smile on her face spoke much more. The smile that swept across
		the young blonde woman's face remained there for the rest of the day as she went about her
		chores. </p>
