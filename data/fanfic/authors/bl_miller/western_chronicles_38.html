<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 38: Preparations -->

<p>The routine they had established varied little as the days went
		by. Each morning it was harder for Josie to pull herself away from the sleeping form next
		to her. Instead of separating herself from Rebecca, she found her arms snaking around her
		to draw her even closer. And even in her sleep, Rebecca returned the embrace, snugging her
		own arm around Josie?s middle and draping her leg over Josie?s thigh. Josie had
		never felt such contentment. She would wait until she heard Charles puttering around in
		the house and finally with a soft kiss to Rebecca?s lips she would drag herself out
		of bed.</p>

		<p>Before Josie climbed up on the roof, both she and Charles trooped
		to the flower garden to pick a handful of flowers. With a wave, Charles would then make
		his way to the cottonwoods to visit with his wife, and Josie would put the fresh flowers
		in the vase for Rebecca.</p>

		<p>On the fifth morning before he walked away, Charles called out to
		Josie who stopped and turned around. "Been meaning to ask you, you know
		Rebecca?s birthday is coming up in a few days?" he began, but stopped when
		the look on her face made it clear she had not known.</p>

		<p>"No, she didn?t tell me," she said. She was hurt
		that Rebecca had told Charles about her birthday, but did not share it with her. She
		squared her shoulders and tried to act like it didn?t matter. "What day is
		it?"</p>

		<p>"The twenty-first. I want to do something special for her,
		but I don?t know her well enough to know what she?d like. Maybe you could give
		me some ideas?"</p>

		<p>Josie thought about it for a few moments and then said,
		"Well, she loves to read. A book would be nice. Or some fabric and embroidery
		thread," she added, remembering how much Rebecca had enjoyed embroidery once she
		finally caught on.</p>

		<p>Charles? face lit up; he had the perfect gift for her.</p>

		<p>"Thanks, Josie. Oh, and not a word to Rebecca, all
		right?"</p>

		<p>"Count on it," she said as she watched him walk off
		with lightness in his step she had not seen before. She only wished she had an idea of
		what she could give her. And then it came to her. The piece of wood she had been
		half-heartedly whittling on for several days had gradually resolved itself into a fairly
		decent looking totem. If she could finish it in time she was certain Rebecca would like
		it, fascinated as she was with all things Cherokee. It would mean stopping work on the
		roof earlier in the day so she would have more daylight hours to work on it. Rebecca had
		been occupied with her own tasks and didn?t seem to notice what the gunslinger was up
		to, so she figured she could accomplish it without her being any the wiser. Josie hummed
		as she went about her work on the roof, and thought of things she could do to make
		Rebecca?s birthday a very special day.</p>

		<p>Horace arrived two days before Rebecca?s birthday. From her
		vantage point on the roof Josie could see the dust of his wagon even before the wagon
		itself was visible. She was fairly certain it must be Charles? brother coming down
		the road, but to be on the safe side she climbed down from the roof and strapped on a gun.
		When he pulled into the door yard with a jangling of harness and was met by a tall woman
		dressed in black with her hand lightly resting on the handle of her gun, he pulled up
		short with a look of confusion on his face that changed to fear. "Has something
		happened to my brother?" He asked, his voice tinged with hysteria. Josie removed her
		hand from her gun and held both hands in front of her as a sign of peace.</p>

		<p>"No, he?s fine," she said quickly to relieve his
		anxiety. "He?s out in the grove yonder," she said gesturing toward the
		cottonwoods, and Horace nodded in understanding. He often found his brother out there when
		he came to visit. "My friend and I have been helping him around the place in exchange
		for an axle for our wagon."</p>

		<p>Horace visibly relaxed when he realized his brother was in no
		danger. He looked around then and it was obvious that a lot of work had been done to the
		place since the last time he was there. The roof was almost completely replaced and the
		yard was neatly trimmed and the rubbish that had accumulated over the years was gone. Even
		the flowerbeds, which had been overrun with weeds when last he noticed, were neat looking
		and colorful. It did not look like the same place at all, but instead looked as it had
		when Ruth was alive. He shook his head, incredulous. "I wouldn?t a recognized
		the place," he said, smiling and stepping forward with his hand outstretched.
		"I?m Horace, Charles? younger brother," he said as he pumped her hand
		vigorously.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" She nearly blurted out her last name, but
		realized that Horace was more a man of the world than his brother, and might be inclined
		to turn her in for the reward if he knew who she was.</p>

		<p>"Purely pleased to make your acquaintance," he said
		brightly. "You have surely done wonders here. My brother is lucky to have found
		you."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I only did the roof. Charles and my friend Rebecca have
		been working on the rest of the place. And speaking of Rebecca, I have a favor to ask of
		you?" she added conspiratorially.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>When Rebecca walked through the door that evening with a bucket
		of wild blackberries she had picked down by the creek, Josie and Charles abruptly fell
		silent. It seemed that every time she came upon them unawares these days they were in the
		middle of a heated discussion that ended the moment she appeared. Since she had never in
		her life had anything special done for her birthday, it did not occur to her that they
		were planning something pleasant. Rather she feared that Josie might be softening her up
		with flowers and kindness every day because she was conspiring with Charles to leave her
		there when she departed. Certainly Josie was not acting like she wanted to leave her, and
		in fact, the opposite seemed to be true. And Josie had promised never to leave her behind
		as long as she wanted to stay with her, so Rebecca was truly confused about what was going
		on.</p>

		<p>The one thing she was not confused about was the way she felt
		every time Josie brushed her finger over her lips, or whispered into her ear, or twined
		her fingers together with her own. Josie?s smile made her weak in the knees, and when
		she spooned her body around Rebecca?s in bed at night, Rebecca could feel the wetness
		bloom between her legs. She had never realized that it was possible for two women to love
		each other as a man and a woman did, but when Josie told her about Genie, it was obvious
		from the pain in her voice that Josie had been in love with Genie. Dare she hope that
		Josie?s actions were those of a woman in love? It seemed so, but Rebecca?s lack
		of experience made her uncertain. She promised herself that she would pluck up her courage
		and ask the beautiful outlaw outright.</p>

		<p>But she didn?t. Josie excused herself right after supper and
		went out to the barn to "work on something." Rebecca cleaned up the kitchen as
		fast as she could, and was putting a shawl around her shoulders to go out and speak to
		Josie when Charles practically pounced on her.</p>

		<p>"Where you off to?" He asked innocently enough, but it
		appeared to Rebecca that he was more than simply curious.</p>

		<p>"Thought I?d go see if I could help Josie with whatever
		she?s working on," she replied. She continued toward the door, and Charles
		bounded in front of her and hooked his arm through hers.</p>

		<p>"Aw, I kinda hoped you might want to play some card games
		with me. Josie?s about finished with that roof and you folks?ll be movin?
		on. There?s still lots of games I need to teach you before you go."</p>

		<p>He sounded almost desperate to the girl, and she realized that
		when they did leave ? and she was determined Josie would not leave her behind ?
		Charles would be even lonelier than he was before they came, having become used to the
		presence of other people. With a sigh she took off her shawl and draped it back on the peg
		by the door, and smiling at the old man, she took a seat at the table. "OK, Charles,
		what can I beat you out of today?" She said with a grin. She would talk to Josie
		later.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Gin," Rebecca said triumphantly, lying her cards out
		on the table with a flourish. Charles groaned and threw his cards down on the table and
		scowled playfully at his young protégé.</p>

		<p>"Upon my soul girl, if I hadn?t dealt those cards
		myself, I?d have to wonder if you weren?t pulling a fast one on old
		Charlie."</p>

		<p>"Beginners luck. Again," she said with a laugh as she
		gathered up the cards. When she had finished putting the cards together, she stood up and
		stretched. They had been playing for at least an hour or more, and the hard wooden chairs
		were less than comfortable. She stifled a yawn. "Excuse me. I?m about done
		in," she said apologetically. "Think I?ll just go see if?"</p>

		<p>"You can?t quit without letting me have a chance to get
		even," Charles said quickly. "How about best three out of five? You already have
		two to my one, so it shouldn?t take long." He started shuffling the cards, and
		dealt out the hands without waiting for a response from the little blonde. She shook her
		head as if to say there was no winning an argument with this stubborn old man, gave
		another stretch and started to sit down. At that moment the door opened and Josie stepped
		through, surprised to see Rebecca still up. The young woman normally went to bed shortly
		after finishing her chores in the kitchen. There was a silent conversation between
		Josie?s eyes and Charles?, and the gunslinger realized that he had been keeping
		the little blonde from going out to see what Josie was up to. She mouthed "thank
		you" at him as she walked into the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water.</p>

		<p>"Your little friend whupped my tail at gin all night,"
		Charles grumbled lightly as he gathered up the cards. Turning to Rebecca he smiled and
		said, "Think you got the right idea, punkin?. I?m plumb wore out my self.
		Suppose we have us a grudge match tomorrow, what do you say?"</p>

		<p>"Sounds good to me," Rebecca agreed quickly, glad he
		had abandoned the notion of playing another game. "I?m just going to make a
		little trip to the uh?" she nodded in the general direction of the back of the
		house where the outhouse was located then continued, "and then I?m going to bed.
		How about you, Josie?"</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "I think I?ll let you go to the
		"uh" by yourself, and I?ll be along to bed directly." Rebecca gave her
		a big smile as she threw her shawl around her shoulders once again and, picking up a
		lantern, she headed out into the night. Taking advantage of her absence, Josie filled
		Charles in on the errand she had sent Horace on for the next day, which relieved his mind.
		His brother was seldom late, and he had been concerned when Horace had not shown up that
		day as he said he would.</p>

		<p>Her hands were red-brown from the stain she used on the totem. As
		she wiped at them with a rag dabbed in coal oil, they were talking animatedly about how
		surprised Rebecca was going to be the next day, when the object of their conversation
		walked back through the door, and they fell silent. Josie smiled at her warmly, and
		Charles gave her a wink. He rose and took the lamp from Rebecca?s hand and darted out
		the door to relieve his bladder, which had begun to pain him after sitting for so long. He
		had been afraid to excuse himself while they were playing their game for fear she would go
		in search of Josie.</p>

		<p>Pumping water into the sink, Josie washed her hands several times
		until she was satisfied that the smell of the coal oil was gone. She turned from the sink
		to find Rebecca standing virtually right behind her, a look of concern on her face. Josie
		blinked a few times in surprise to find that her self defense mechanism had allowed the
		young girl to get so close without her even realizing she was there.</p>

		<p>"What is it, Rebecca? What?s wrong?" Josie reached
		out and brushed a strand of hair from Rebecca?s forehead, then she lightly caressed
		her cheek. Running her hand down the adored face, she lightly touched Rebecca?s lips
		with her fingertips. Rebecca trembled at the touch, and her eyes fluttered shut. Josie put
		her arms around Rebecca?s waist, and the smaller woman allowed herself to be pulled
		into those strong arms. She laid her head on Josie?s chest, listening to the sound of
		Josie?s heart thundering like an avalanche down a mountain.</p>

		<p>Rebecca?s plan to calmly talk to Josie dissolved as she
		blurted out, "Don?t leave me here. Please take me with you; I c-couldn?t
		s-stand it if you left me?" She burrowed into Josie?s chest, her head
		resting just below the taller woman?s chin.</p>

		<p>"Whoa, whoa," Josie said, pulling back so she could see
		Rebecca?s face. "What makes you think I?m going to leave you? I said you
		could stay with me as long as you wanted to, and I meant it. Of course you?ll come
		with me." She tilted Rebecca?s chin up so she could look into her eyes.
		"Rebecca, I?d be lost without you. Now come on, let me see a smile." Josie
		put her finger by the corner of Rebecca?s mouth and gently pushed up, creating a
		lop-sided smile. "Kinda crooked but better than nothing," she said softly, which
		made Rebecca smile genuinely.</p>

		<p>"OK, if you?re not planning to leave me here, then what
		is it that you and Charles are cooking up that you both shut up every time I come into the
		room? I thought at first it was my imagination, but when it continued for days, I
		couldn?t pretend it wasn?t happening any more. I was scared, Josie."</p>

		<p>"Oh sprite, it?s?nothing to be scared about,"
		she said quickly. She almost blurted out their plans for her birthday and bit the words
		back just in time. "In fact, I think you?ll be pleased when you find out what it
		is." Rebecca still had a look of confusion on her face, but Josie shook her head and
		smiled. "I?ve said too much already. You?ll find out everything soon
		enough. Be patient, and trust me, will you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes of course, but?"</p>

		<p>"No buts. It?s time for bed. Come on." She grasped
		Rebecca?s hand and led her toward the little bedroom they shared. Rebecca twined her
		fingers together with Josie?s and followed willingly, still curious but no longer
		worried. She trusted Josie completely.</p>

		<p>Josie cupped her hand behind the flame of the candle and leaned
		forward to blow it out so that Rebecca could get undressed in the dark, as was her habit.
		The gunslinger hoped that one day soon her precious young friend would no longer feel the
		shame and embarrassment she had carried for so long because of her abusive father, and
		would allow Josie to see all of her.</p>

		<p>"Wait," Rebecca said from behind her, and she turned to
		once again find the little blonde close enough to kill her, if that had been her plan.
		Josie?s razor sharp instincts had been dulled by the safe life she had been living
		lately. Once they left this haven behind, she would need to hone them again for her own
		safety, as well as for Rebecca?s. "I?want to talk a while, and I want to
		see your face," Rebecca said softly.</p>

		<p>"Fine with me," Josie said with a grin. "Do you
		mind if I get undressed while we talk?"</p>

		<p>"Not at all," Rebecca replied softly, sinking down to
		the edge of the bed and watching as the gunslinger?s fingers methodically unfastened
		the buttons of her black shirt. When she peeled it off to reveal her shoulders and her
		creamy breasts, Rebecca was unable to take her eyes away from the beautiful spectacle.
		Josie?s breasts fairly glowed in the dancing candle flame, and Rebecca ached to reach
		out and touch them. Transfixed by the tantalizing beauty in front of her, Rebecca suddenly
		found herself tongue-tied and blushing. She couldn?t even think of what it was she
		wanted to say, and she simply sat like a schoolgirl admiring her first real crush.</p>

		<p>Josie couldn?t help but notice where Rebecca?s eyes
		were fastened, and she smiled at the mix of emotions revealed in that simple look. If she
		had ever wondered whether there was a chance the little blonde was attracted to her, she
		wondered no more. Blatant desire was written on Rebecca?s young face, but there was
		uncertainty as well. Josie knew she must be patient with Rebecca and give her all the time
		she needed to sort out her feelings without her influence. Much as she wanted to take the
		smaller woman in her arms and smother her with kisses, she knew that Rebecca was not ready
		for that. She would allow Rebecca to set the pace, taking her cues from her.</p>

		<p>Rebecca suddenly realized that she was staring at Josie?s
		breasts, and she had no concept of how much time had passed while she did so. She blushed
		as she wondered what Josie must be thinking. Reluctantly she dragged her eyes off
		Josie?s glorious body and brought them to her beautiful face. Josie was watching her,
		a smile tipping up the corners of her mouth. Casually Josie turned away, pouring water
		from the pitcher on the wash stand into the wash basin. She figured Rebecca would have
		time to compose herself while she washed up a little. She soaked a cloth in the cool water
		and scrubbed it over her face, gooseflesh rising on her skin at the contact with the
		water. She wished she had thought to warm up some water before retiring to the bedroom,
		but it was a bit late for that now.</p>

		<p>The smooth planes of Josie?s back were appealing to Rebecca,
		but were not the magnet for her eyes that her chest had been. Rebecca was able to remember
		what it was she wanted to talk to Josie about, and she cleared her throat and began.
		"Josie?I wanted to ask you about?I mean, I?ve been wondering
		if?that is, if you?did you love Genie? I mean, romantically love her. Like a man
		and a woman do?" She could feel her cheeks flaming, but once she started speaking, it
		suddenly became very important that she got her question out before she lost her nerve
		completely. Josie?s back stiffened at the question, and she laid down her washcloth
		and turned around again to face the furiously blushing girl.</p>

		<p>"Are you asking me if I was in love with Genie?" She
		asked, and Rebecca nodded mutely. "Yes. Yes, I was. But like a man and a woman?"
		She shook her head and seemed to contemplate her answer. "It was very different. More
		intense, more?I don?t know, fulfilling. I couldn?t imagine having those
		kinds of feelings for a man. We didn?t?make love. Perhaps we would have if she
		had lived?I don?t know, but?we didn?t even discuss it. I thought we
		had all the time in the world?." Her voice trailed off as she choked back a sob.
		This was not what she wanted to be doing; grieving for her lost love in front of the woman
		with whom she was now very much in love. She gulped a couple of times and took a deep
		breath to regain her composure.</p>

		<p>"Have you ever made love with other women since then?"
		Rebecca asked breathlessly. Josie took a few moments to frame her answer, and Rebecca
		wished she could bite out her tongue for having even asked. In her mind she kicked herself
		for starting this train of thought, but she had to see it through. She needed to know if
		Josie was still attracted to women, or if that was simply the crush of a teenaged girl.</p>

		<p>"You ask hard questions," Josie said sincerely. She sat
		on the edge of the bed and began to pull her boots off while considering how to reply.</p>

		<p>"Let me help," Rebecca said, dropping to the floor in
		front of the gunslinger. Lifting each foot in turn she pulled off her boots followed by
		the socks. She sat cross-legged on the floor and, drawing Josie?s right foot into her
		lap she began to massage it. Josie?s eyes drifted shut and she gave a little sigh.
		"What?s the answer?" Rebecca persisted.</p>

		<p>"I?ve had sex with a few," Josie replied, and
		Rebecca looked at her questioningly with her eyebrow raised. "All right, more than a
		few," she amended with a wry smile. "But in my heart I never made love with any
		of them. It was just a pleasant way to relieve tension. Meant nothing to
		me?emotionally." Rebecca?s thumbs pressed convulsively on the bridge of
		Josie?s foot as she took in the meaning of her words.</p>

		<p>"Easy love," Josie said with a chuckle. "I have to
		walk on those feet, and that won?t be easy if you crush my instep."</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry," Rebecca said, hastily letting go of
		Josie?s foot.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed lightly. "Feast or famine with you, isn?t
		it sprite? I didn?t say you had to stop; just don?t break my foot." Rebecca
		blushed again and averted her eyes, but she did pick up Josie?s foot and begin
		massaging it again. "OK, now it?s my turn to ask a question. Why all the
		questions about making love with women?"</p>

		<p>Once again Rebecca?s gift with words deserted her, and she
		found herself unable to speak in coherent sentences. "It?s the way you?ve
		been acting for the last few days, more attentive than usual?not that you?re not
		attentive other times," she stammered. "I?m not saying this right?what
		I mean is, I thought you were just being nice to me because you were going to ditch me,
		but now I know you weren?t, and I?it seemed like you were courting me.
		Like?well, like a man would. And I never thought about?that with a woman before,
		and I wasn?t sure if I was right. Were you? Courting me, I mean?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. But that wasn?t fair; it was my turn to ask the
		questions. Now don?t think about these questions, just answer from your heart. Do you
		love me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," she answered without hesitation.</p>

		<p>"Are you in love with me?"</p>

		<p>"I don?t know?yes, I think so. How can I know? I
		was never in love before."</p>

		<p>"Do you find yourself attracted to me, sexually?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca took a deep breath and then let it out in a shudder.
		"Oh God, yes. But Josie I?m afraid? I don?t know what you want from
		me. What if I can?t?what if I?m not?enough for you?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, Rebecca?whatever you are, whatever you want to be,
		is enough for me. I want you to be happy. I would love nothing better than to make love
		with you for the rest of my life, but if all you want is to travel with me and be my
		friend, I can live with that. If anything happens between us, it will be because you say
		you want it to. I will never push you or try to make you do something you don?t want
		to." She reached down and clasped Rebecca by her wrists and pulled her up to where
		she could place a kiss on her forehead. Then she whirled her around and sat her down on
		the edge of the bed facing the other side of the room, and at the same time she rose and
		unbuckled her belt and dropped her pants to the floor. "Don?t turn around.
		I?m naked," she said as she grabbed her longjohns from the back of a chair and
		quickly stepped into them. By the time Rebecca did turn around, Josie was slipping her
		arms into the sleeves and all but covered up. "I?m going to blow out this candle
		now so you can get undressed. Unless you want to tease me by getting naked in front of
		me," Josie said with a raised eyebrow and a sly smile.</p>

		<p>"Blow it out," Rebecca said shyly. She really had
		wanted to see Josie stripped, and the thought of taking off her clothes in front of the
		gunslinger excited her more than she could say. But it was too soon. Her mind was whirling
		like a cyclone, and what she wanted kept getting hopelessly tangled with what she thought
		she should do. "Can we sleep on this tonight and talk about it again tomorrow?"
		She asked hopefully.</p>

		<p>Josie puffed out the candle, and returned to the bed. "Of
		course we can. Tomorrow will be a perfect day to talk about it," she said, knowing
		what surprises the next day would bring to the pretty little blonde. She vowed to stay on
		her side of the bed as much as possible, and to keep her hands to herself. When the time
		was right, she knew Rebecca would let her know.</p>
