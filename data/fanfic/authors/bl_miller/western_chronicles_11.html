<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 11: The Calm Port -->

<p>Rebecca helped Josie sit up and eat, filling the air with a
		constant chatter the whole time. She discovered quickly that the outlaw was quite
		interested in history and proceeded to tell the story of the Boston Tea Party. When she
		noticed the blue eyes fighting to stay awake, she moved closer and spoke in lower tones.
		The soft voice had the desired effect. Within minutes, Josie was sound asleep. Rebecca
		lingered a while longer, enjoying the opportunity to see the outlaw unguarded and
		vulnerable. She <img src="res/fanfic/authors/bl_miller/western_chronicles/starr1.gif" alt="Belle Starr" align="right" width="166" height="299"/>brushed a stray
		lock of black hair away from the older woman's face. </p>

		<p>"She'd break your hand if she saw that." Rebecca jumped
		out of her seat and turned to see Belle standing in the doorway. </p>

		<p>"I didn't...I mean I...." </p>

		<p>"Relax, child. Just giving you a warning. I've known Josie
		for many years now, and touching just isn't something she's good at." </p>

		<p>"What do you know about her? I mean, it's not like she's
		much for girl talk or anything," they both chuckled quietly. </p>

		<p>"I think whatever Josie wants you to know about her, she'll
		tell. I make it a point not to talk about other people, especially when they can shoot as
		well as her." She waited until Rebecca nodded in understanding. "Now, she ain't
		gonna be able to help out around here for a while, so you're going to help out for her.
		Right now I think we should get some rest. Tomorrow will be a busy day." </p>

		<p>And tomorrow was a busy day, as were the days after that. Belle
		put the young woman to work mending fences and tending to the horses. In the evening,
		Rebecca would pull buckets of water from the well to use for cooking and cleaning. At
		night, she would eat dinner with Josie and tell her more stories about the war of
		independence. </p>

		<p>"...and then General Arnold moved his troops north..."
		</p>

		<p>"Why did you stay?" Josie interrupted. Rebecca looked
		at her for a moment, as if not understanding the question. </p>

		<p>"I stayed because you're my friend. Friends do that for one
		another, you know." </p>

		<p>There was a long silence as Josie turned her head to stare at a
		knot on the wall. Rebecca sat there silently, unsure of what to say or if she should leave
		or not. "Thank you," the outlaw finally said quietly. Her face was an unreadable
		mask. </p>

		<p>"Well, um..." Rebecca stood up and rubbed her hands on
		the front of her dress as she tried not to let her happiness at the thanks show.
		"Guess it's time to turn in. Tomorrow's gonna be a busy day," she unconsciously
		rubbed her aching forearms. </p>

		<p>"If you rub liniment into it, it won't hurt as much,"
		Josie said. She received a warm smile for her efforts. </p>

		<p>"Thanks." Without thinking about it, Rebecca leaned
		forward and gave the outlaw a quick hug. "Good night." She felt Josie stiffen
		and make no effort to return the embrace. "Sorry." </p>

		<p>"It's all right, Rebecca. I'm just not a touchy-feely kind
		of person, that's all." She fixed her blue eyes on a knot on the wall for a moment.
		"Don't forget to rub liniment on those muscles," she added softly. </p>

		<p>"I won't forget. Good night." As she left the room
		Rebecca smiled from ear to ear. They had actually spoken kind words to one another. She
		had called Josie a friend and the outlaw had looked for a moment as if she were going to
		respond in kind. The young woman took it as a very good sign indeed. </p>
