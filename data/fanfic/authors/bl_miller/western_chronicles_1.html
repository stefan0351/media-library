<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 1: Alone -->

<p>The late afternoon sun set across the wind-ravaged canyon,
		turning the rock into a brilliant tapestry of orange and brown. The lone rider sat atop
		her golden mare, her raven hair flowing loose over her shoulders. The wide brim of her
		black Stetson kept the orange ball of flame from blinding her as she looked around for a
		safe place to sleep. She spotted a cave off in the distance, and leaned down to whisper
		into the horse's ear. "Come on, Phoenix. Just a little bit longer and we'll
		rest." Josie urged the horse forward up a narrow slope, her eyes watching the
		surrounding area the entire time. It had only been six weeks since her gang had been
		ambushed while trying to rob a train in Missouri. It was only her quick thinking and fast
		gun that kept her alive. She hoped that Henry and Jonah had also escaped; she'd seen them
		take off in separate directions to draw the posse away from her. She also knew that the
		ambush had been orchestrated by one of her men in an attempt to kill her, presumably to
		collect the bounty that was on her head. To be sold out for one thousand dollars by one of
		the men she had been riding with for two years still stuck in her craw. When they had set
		out on what was to be their last train robbery she could not have foreseen that before the
		day was out, she would be riding for her life with a fully armed posse on her heels, not
		knowing the fate of her two trusted comrades. </p>

		<p>When she reached the cave entrance, Josie dismounted and removed
		the saddle and saddlebags from Phoenix' back. She tethered the mare to the base of a
		nearby tree, where she began to crop grass in the dappled shade. </p>

		<p>Josie carried her few belongings into the cool interior of the
		cave. Not that there was much in the saddlebags; most of her supplies were left at the
		main camp when she left for her ill-fated trip to the railway siding. Once settled into
		the cave with a small fire to keep her warm, Josie took stock of her inventory, starting
		with her clothes. She had her black boots, complete with silver tips and spurs. Filthy
		black cotton trousers covered her legs, and a thin black long sleeved shirt and brown
		leather vest covered her upper torso. She wore a black leather belt that was more than
		just for keeping her pants up and a hidden pocket sewn into the inside concealed a small
		knife. If her hands were tied behind her back, the pocket was within easy reach. That
		little secret saved her life more than once. The vest also had a secret compartment. A
		dingy gray kerchief was wrapped around her neck. Her black Stetson was resting nearby.
		These were the only clothes she owned now.</p>

		<p>Her weapons were the only other things she still had. Two Colt
		Peacemakers were strapped to her legs by bullet-rimmed gun belts that crossed each other
		over her slender hips.</p>

		<p>A Winchester 73 in a brown leather scabbard was strapped to the
		saddle. Josie had less than six cartridges for it, since the rest had been expended while
		escaping from the posse. Each boot contained one bowie knife, and she still had her whip,
		albeit a bit shorter than when it was new.</p>

		<p>Rummaging through the saddlebags again, she found no money, no
		dried meat, nothing she could use. Only a small bottle of ink and a broken pen resided in
		one pouch, while a fork and spoon took up another. Josie had no pots or pans, nothing in
		which to cook a meal. Removing the leather cover to her canteen and heating the metal
		container in the fire made hot water. She wished she had more than one canteen; the days
		were too hot to ride without draining the flask at least twice. Josie tried to follow the
		river, knowing that a town would eventually appear.</p>

		<p>With no bedroll with which to cover herself, Josie laid her head
		on the saddle, using the scratchy saddle-blanket as a pillow, and settled in for a light
		sleep.</p>
