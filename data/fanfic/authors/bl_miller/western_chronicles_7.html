<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 7: Divvying up the booty -->

<p>Josie rode back to the campsite and took inventory of the
		supplies. The men were well stocked, with full compliments of weapons and supplies. The
		guns were useless to her, being of inferior quality to her own. She stuffed some bullets
		into a pouch and tied it to her saddle horn. Never can have too many bullets, she mused.
		She was about to search the tents for the best bedroll when she heard the sound of Rebecca
		vomiting off in the bushes. Cursing herself mentally, Josie went to check on the young
		woman.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was just wiping her mouth when Josie walked up to her.
		"I told you not to follow. What part of that don't you understand?" The outlaw
		said angrily, although she was slightly concerned about the pallor of the girl's face. The
		paleness only served to accent the bruises more.</p>

		<p>"I understood you perfectly." Rebecca replied angrily.
		She was embarrassed to be seen in such a state; after all, the dead men were bandits. But
		the sight of their dead bodies still made the innocent girl sad for the loss of life.
		"You can't take all their stuff, so I see no reason why I can't pick through it too.
		After all, I could use some of these things as well."</p>

		<p>"Suit yourself, little girl." Josie said evenly.</p>

		<p>"My name is Rebecca!" She retorted. "And I'm not a
		little girl."</p>

		<p>"Makes no difference to me." Josie replied as she
		headed back to rummage through the men's belongings.</p>

		<p>Exiting a tent with her new bedroll in hand, Josie noticed the
		scent of fresh meat cooking. Looking at the fire, she saw that Rebecca had thrown more
		logs on and was cooking up some of the food that the dead men had left behind. The
		outlaw's stomach growled as the pleasant odor conjured up memories of long ago meals. One
		thing that Josie had no skill at was cooking.</p>

		<p>"There's plenty for both of us." Rebecca said as she
		continued to turn over the cooking beef. She kept her eyes on the food, fearful of the
		possible angry look that might be coming from the outlaw. "I mean, there's no sense
		wasting it. The meat won't travel well and if we don't eat it, then the vultures
		will." Josie conceded the point, making her stomach grumble again with joy at the
		thought of decent food. Without saying a word, Josie continued to search the camp for
		useful items. She came up with a small folding shovel, several pieces of flint, a few
		dollars and coins, two more canteens, and spare clothes. Her saddlebags were full of the
		much-needed supplies by the time Rebecca announced that the food was ready to eat.</p>

		<p>Rebecca waited a few minutes for the outlaw to come over and pick
		up the plate of beef and beans before making a plate of her own. Without a sound, Josie
		sat down on the other side of the fire and started to eat her food. Rebecca quietly passed
		her the canteen of water. Josie made no effort to take it, concentrating solely on eating
		the tasty food. Setting the water flask on the ground between them, Rebecca turned her
		attention back to her dinner. She was spooning some more beans on her plate when she saw
		Josie reach out toward her, plate in hand. Rebecca suppressed a smile as she scooped the
		food onto the outlaw's plate.</p>

		<p>After wiping her plate with the last of the bread from the men's
		camp, Josie set the dirty dish and utensils down on the ground. Without so much as a thank
		you, she rose to her feet and wandered off. Rebecca sat quietly by the dying fire, afraid
		to leave and afraid to stay. The big horse was munching on some grass nearby, so she knew
		that the outlaw would be back. Deciding between the unknown and the murderer who had
		already threatened to kill her, Rebecca maintained her position by the fire.</p>

		<p>Rebecca had used up most of the loose kindling while trying to
		keep the fire going. It was now twilight and she was beginning to wonder if Josie really
		was going to come back, despite the evidence of Phoenix standing nearby.</p>

		<p>"You still here?" Rebecca jumped at the sound of the
		outlaw's voice just behind her. Josie continued to walk past her until she reached the
		opposite side of the fire. She dropped an armful of wood onto the ground. Reaching for a
		nearby hatchet, Josie cut the branches into usable lengths, throwing several directly into
		the fire.</p>

		<p>"I-I didn't know if I should leave or not. I mean, I
		wouldn't want you to have to kill anyone else or anything." Rebecca said nervously.
		Josie said nothing as she continued to chop the wood. Uncertain of what else to do, the
		young woman got up and started to walk around the camp, heading for the still-tethered
		horses of the dead men. Rifling through the saddlebags, she found a pen and a small bottle
		of ink. She didn't find any paper or parchment. A more thorough search revealed only small
		scraps of paper and a pocket-sized bible. There was a blank page preceding the beginning
		of the familiar book, but Rebecca didn't dare use it. She had once bent the corner of a
		page in her father's bible and received a sound whipping for it. Putting the bible back in
		the saddlebag, the young woman returned to the fireside.</p>

		<p>Josie was finished cutting the wood and was now intently cleaning
		one of her guns. Positioning herself so she could watch the outlaw but not be too close,
		Rebecca sat down. The long fingers moved gracefully across the smooth steel, polishing it
		with an old, stained piece of cloth. Rebecca heard the soft click as Josie opened the
		barrel to clean it. Hours seemed to fly by as the outlaw cleaned all of her weapons and
		the young woman watched.</p>

		<p>The warm fire, the filling meal, and the hypnotic rhythm of
		Josie's hand rubbing the polishing cloth across the steel all served to lull Rebecca to
		sleep. The outlaw watched her for a few moments before covering her with one of the
		blankets. Hours later, Josie still sat there, wondering why this young girl seemed so
		intent on following her.</p>
