<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 13: Parting -->

<p>"Where are you headed?", Belle asked as she watched
		Josie saddle Phoenix. The early morning heat hung in the air, promising a scorcher of a
		day ahead. The gunslinger wiped her brow with her bandanna. </p>

		<p>"Tombstone; you know that little mining town not far from
		here." Belle nodded. Josie looked around to make sure Rebecca wasn't nearby then
		leaned in close and spoke quietly. "She'll be safe enough there." </p>

		<p>"She's been getting stronger, ya know. Working so hard here
		and all. She's a good talker, unlike someone we know," her eyes twinkled at the scowl
		from Josie. "That little sprite's got a strong heart." </p>

		<p>"I'm not changing my mind, Belle." </p>

		<p>Josie turned her attention back to tightening straps and checking
		the fit of the bridle. Belle looked out and caught sight of the young blonde heading their
		way. "She's coming, Josie." She turned to look at her dark headed friend.
		"That girl has worked her rear off trying to impress you while you healed and now
		you're just gonna dump her like a sack of mealy flour?" </p>

		<p>"Belle," she sighed. "Just how safe do you think
		it would be for a young innocent girl like that to be following me all over the place? All
		it'll mean to her is an early death...or worse." She took the reins and led the horse
		out of the stall. She had already packed their supplies on the smaller horse, and she
		gathered up her lead rope as well as she walked from the stable. She turned back to Belle
		and said, "Don't say anything to her." Belle nodded. She knew Josie would do
		what she thought was best, regardless of anything she might say or do. </p>

		<p>"Ready?", Rebecca asked expectantly as she watched the
		outlaw exit the stable, Belle close behind her. Josie mounted and held her hand out,
		pulling the young woman up effortlessly behind her. </p>

		<p>"Hang on," she said before nudging Phoenix into a trot,
		giving a short wave to the sharpshooter as they pulled out of sight. Rebecca turned her
		head and caught a sad look on Belle's face. As she waved, the prairie girl swore she saw
		the sharpshooter's lips form the words 'take care of her'. </p>
