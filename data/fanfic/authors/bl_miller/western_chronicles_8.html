<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 8: Mason's Gulch -->

<p>"Get up." Josie roughly nudged the sleeping woman with
		her silver-tipped boot.</p>

		<p>"Hrrummphhh." The sleeping form snuggled deeper under
		the covers.</p>

		<p>"Get up now or I leave you behind." Josie snarled.
		Rebecca quickly sat up and tried to bring herself to wakefulness. "You've got one
		minute to make a trip to the woods, then I'm leaving."</p>

		<p>"No breakfast?" She whined as she stood up and
		stretched. Josie looked at her and frowned.</p>

		<p>"You can't travel around dressed like that." Josie said
		as she looked at the long peasant dress and soft soled shoes.</p>

		<p>"What am I supposed to wear?" She called as she headed
		into the woods. Josie walked into one of the tents and selected two shirts and two pairs
		of britches.</p>

		<p>Tossing them in a pile on top of Rebecca's blanket, the outlaw
		set out to find the small man that had been the previous owner of the clothes.</p>

		<p>"Put these on." Josie pointed at the clothes pile,
		which now included a pair of pointed toed boots and a beige Stetson. Rebecca picked up the
		clothes and looked at her, then at the tent, then back to her. "I'm not waiting all
		day." Josie said as she crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow at the young woman.</p>

		<p>"Sorry." Rebecca murmured. She reached up to undo the
		first button, then looked at the outlaw. Josie scowled and muttered a curse before turning
		around to double check the cinch of Phoenix's saddle. Rebecca quickly undressed and
		slipped into the britches. They were a little loose and slightly too long for the small
		woman.</p>

		<p>"What about the corset?" She asked as she reached
		behind her for the laces.</p>

		<p>"You'll be more comfortable without it", was the reply.
		Rebecca quickly removed the corset and slipped on the loose fitting shirt. "I'll
		saddle up one of these horses for you," Josie offered. Rebecca was tugging the new
		boots on when Josie started toward the string of horses and the young woman hopped after
		her, pulling on the last boot. </p>

		<p>"I can't...ride alone," she protested even as the
		gunslinger tightened the girth on the smallest of the horses. "I'm scared of horses.
		One kicked me when I was a little girl, and since then I can't bear to be on a horse by
		myself. Please, can't I just ride with you? I feel safe when you're up there with
		me." Josie looked into the innocent green eyes of the young blonde, and saw that she
		was most sincere about her fear of horses. Even so, it was not practical for them to ride
		double over a prolonged period of time; it would be hard on the horse, not to mention
		uncomfortable for Josie. Only in bed did she like to be close to a woman. When the loving
		was over, she wanted her space. With a shrug, Josie draped the usable supplies the dead
		men no longer needed on the back of the horse she had saddled, and untied the rest. She
		had planned on keeping two of the men's horses, but if Rebecca would not ride, there was
		no point. She led the little horse to where Phoenix stood waiting for her, and
		effortlessly vaulted into the saddle. She looked down at the younger woman whose expectant
		face was turned toward her.</p>

		<p>"You'll have to walk," she said emotionlessly. "I
		can't put the extra weight on Phoenix in this heat." She made a clicking sound with
		her tongue, and the big golden mare started moving, the smaller horse following obediently
		behind. With a sigh, the blonde fell in with the parade.</p>

		<p>As the morning wore on Rebecca fell further and further behind.
		Her feet hurt too much from the previous days walking to keep up with the well-rested
		mare. Her stomach grumbled from lack of food, and her normally sunny disposition was
		turning noticeably cloudy. "Josie," she called to the woman far ahead.
		"Josie, please wait!" The young woman watched as the horse stopped. When it was
		obvious that Josie wasn't going to come back to see what she wanted, Rebecca broke into a
		trot to catch up to the outlaw before she changed her mind and decided to ride on. She
		drew alongside the horse and rider, and gasped as she fought to catch her breath.</p>

		<p>"I can hardly walk anymore," she said petulantly.
		"My feet are killing me, and I'm starving. Don't outlaws eat?" The tone in
		Rebecca's voice, and the little girl pout on her face almost made Josie laugh out loud.
		She turned away, and managed to put a serious scowl on her face.</p>

		<p>"Yes. We eat little blonde farm-girls for breakfast. How
		nice for me there's one so handy."</p>

		<p>Rebecca raised her hand to slap the gunslinger on the thigh, but
		the look in the ice blue eyes made her think twice. She dropped her hand and grumbled,
		"I'm serious. Please, can't we stop and eat?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, all right." Josie slid from the back of the horse,
		and looking around for a shady spot, she saw a small grove of trees over a small rise.
		"Can you walk that far?" she asked, pointing to the oasis in the distance.
		Rebecca nodded, and eagerly began trekking up the hill. Josie watched as the blonde walked
		away, and a smile came to her face. She gave her head a little shake wondering not for the
		first time what had possessed her to allow this slip of a girl to talk her way along for
		the ride.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca threw herself down in the shade of a large oak tree, and
		pulled the boots from her aching feet. Blisters had formed and many had broken already,
		leaving her feet oozing and raw. Having her feet bare so she could feel a cooling breeze
		on them felt wonderful. Josie tethered the horses a few feet away but still in the shade,
		and rummaged in her saddlebag for some jerky. She unwound the strap of the canteen from
		the saddle horn and walked to where the younger woman was lying in the grass. Her eyes
		widened as she saw the condition of Rebecca's feet, and she mentally kicked herself for
		insisting that the poor woman walk. She dropped down beside the little blonde and thrust
		the canteen into one of her hands, and a hunk of jerky into the other. Rebecca had been
		almost dozing with her eyes closed, but when she felt the canteen against her hand, she
		opened her eyes and smiled at the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Thanks," she said gratefully, tipping the canteen to
		her dry lips and taking a large swallow. She coughed as a bit of the liquid went down the
		wrong pipe.</p>

		<p>"Easy does it," Josie admonished her. "Won't do
		you much good if you choke yourself to death." From where she sat, Josie could see
		the dark smudges that marred the pretty face of the innocent girl. Beneath the purple
		bruises was evidence of earlier beatings. Josie put her finger under Rebecca's chin, and
		turned her head up to get a better look. "Who did this?" Josie asked softly.
		Rebecca's eyes began to glisten with tears as she watched the outlaw's examination of her
		discolored cheek. She lowered her head when Josie finally let go.</p>

		<p>"My father."</p>

		<p>"Somebody should give him a taste of his own medicine."
		Josie whispered through clenched teeth. She silently promised herself that if she should
		ever encounter the man she would gladly do just that.</p>

		<p>Rebecca shook her head, and the tears that were pooled in her
		eyes slipped down her cheeks. "He's not a bad man, really," she protested.
		"He was a good father; very strict with us children, but usually fair. When my
		brother was killed in the war, he sort of...snapped. Then he started drinking, and when he
		drinks...."</p>

		<p>"You don't have to tell me. I've been around plenty of that
		type of man. But you shouldn't excuse him. What happened to your brother had nothing to do
		with you." </p>

		<p>"I know, but..."</p>

		<p>"No," Josie said sternly. She thought of her own
		father, the kindest most gentle man she had ever known and wished that the innocent girl
		beside her could have grown up in such a safe and caring environment. "A father
		should never hurt his children, no matter what." Feeling emotions so close to the
		surface was awkward for Josie, and she stood up and let her eyes roam around the
		surrounding countryside as if she was looking for something. "I'll be right
		back," she said abruptly. She walked toward a clump of bushes in the distance, and
		within a few minutes was out of Rebecca's sight.</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched the tall black clad woman walk away. She couldn't
		imagine what had caused her to leave so suddenly unless she was looking for a place to
		relieve herself. With a sigh, Rebecca started to chew on the dry jerky. Her appetite
		seemed to have deserted her and she thought about tossing the jerky away, but realized she
		would undoubtedly want it later. She slid the piece of dried meat into her pocket and lay
		down in the cool grass to wait for the gunslinger to return.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie stood gazing down at the still form under the tree.
		Rebecca's face was relaxed in sleep, her lips slightly parted. How child-like she seemed
		to the toughened older woman. Yet she was not a child. Josie reckoned she must be about
		eighteen, which was considerably older than she herself had been when she found herself on
		her own. She found herself wanting to protect her from any further abuse. "Hey, wake
		up lazy bones," she said softly. Rebecca still breathed with sleep, so the gunslinger
		knelt down beside her and said a little louder, "I brought dessert." The green
		eyes flew open and focused on Josie who held her vest in her hands with a large bulge
		hanging down.</p>

		<p>"Dessert?" Rebecca yawned and stretched. Josie laid the
		vest on the ground to reveal a mound of plump ripe blackberries. A huge grin spread across
		Rebecca's face. Her appetite returned with a vengeance at the sight of those juicy
		berries. She grabbed one and popped it in her mouth, pushing her tongue against the roof
		of her mouth to squeeze the juice throughout her mouth. "Ohhh, that's heaven,"
		she breathed as she reached for another. Josie watched as one after another the berries
		disappeared into the ravenous girl. Suddenly it occurred to Rebecca that she had eaten all
		the fruit and Josie had none.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eat them all. I'll go pick
		you some more." She started to rise, but Josie put her hand on her shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Not necessary. I ate a bunch while I was picking them. Sit
		back and let me have a look at your feet." She sat on the ground and brought
		Rebecca's feet to her lap. They looked too tender to attempt to put footwear on without
		allowing the blisters some healing time. "I'm afraid you won't be able to wear those
		boots again any time soon." </p>

		<p>"Oh, tarnation. I was just beginning to like them," she
		said sarcastically. </p>

		<p>"Stay here," Josie said, rising and crossing to her
		saddlebags where she found a roll of gauze. She returned to where Rebecca sat and once
		again took her feet in her hands. Gently she wrapped the gauze around each foot in turn
		and then tied it loosely around Rebecca's ankles. </p>

		<p>"Not very fashionable, but it should keep the dirt out of
		those blisters until they heal a bit." Josie stood up and held out her hand to the
		young woman, who grasped it in both of hers. Josie tugged her to her feet and then swept
		her into her arms. She walked to Phoenix and stood Rebecca on her feet briefly so she
		could grasp her waist. She lifted her up and boosted her onto the horse's rump.</p>

		<p>"Looks like you get your wish after all," she said as
		she swung up into the saddle. "Put your arms around my waist and hold on." Josie
		said as she urged Phoenix into a trot. Both women were left to their own thoughts as they
		rode west. Rebecca held on tight as she bounced up and down with each step of the massive
		horse's hooves, her thoughts on the painful past she was leaving behind.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Whoa." Josie pulled Phoenix to a stop just before the
		edge of town. "Get down." She watched as Rebecca slid down off the horse.</p>

		<p>"What's wrong?" The runaway asked as she watched the
		outlaw reach into the saddlebags and pull out her dress.</p>

		<p>"Put this on." Josie said as she handed her the
		garment. "You don't want to be seen with me. It'll be easier for you if you're in
		your own clothes. You'll be safe there."</p>

		<p>"Wait. Aren't you coming?" Rebecca reached up and
		touched the outlaw's thigh as Josie climbed back into the saddle.</p>

		<p>"No. It's not safe for me to go there. There's a price on my
		head, you know." She looked down at the hand and arched an eyebrow. Rebecca gulped
		and moved her hand.</p>

		<p>"Sorry. Just a habit, I guess. I like to touch people while
		I'm talking to them." A momentary silence fell between them. "Do you want me to
		get anything for you? I mean, I can go and bring it back."</p>

		<p>"You expect me to trust you with my money?" Josie asked
		incredulously.</p>

		<p>"I haven't lied to you yet. I didn't have to offer, you
		know." Rebecca was hurt by her distrust. Josie's blue eyes bore down on her, trying
		to search for signs of deceit. The young woman's face showed pure innocence and honesty.
		Although cautious, Josie decided to take a chance. There were too many things she needed
		that couldn't be found on the prairie.</p>

		<p>"All right. I'll trust you." Josie said as she
		dismounted. Quicker than Rebecca could react, the outlaws hands were on her upper arms,
		squeezing painfully. "But if you cross me, I'll send you to your maker without a
		thought." Her words were firm and full of threat.</p>

		<p>"Y-yes. Please, you're hurting me." She looked at the
		hands gripping her arms as tears started to blur her eyes. Josie let go and turned to open
		the saddlebag.</p>

		<p>"Do you know how to read?"</p>

		<p>"Of course I know how to read. I can write too. Actually I'm
		a very good writer, if I do say so myself. I do mostly poems and children's tales, but I'd
		really like to become a pulp writer, you know, writing stories about famous people and
		places and...."</p>

		<p>"I only asked you if you could read," Josie said,
		annoyed. She pulled out the ink, pen, and paper, then wrote out a short list of necessary
		supplies. The total was less than six bits. She could afford to lose that if it was a
		trick. Handing Rebecca the note, she said "Don't tell anyone who this is for, and
		don't mention my name to anyone. When you have everything, come back here."</p>

		<p>"Okay." Rebecca maintained a straight face, but inside
		she was jumping for joy at the chance to do something to help the woman who had saved her
		life, twice.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Mason's Gulch was a typical western town. Several small buildings
		formed the only street. A large stable occupied the far end of town. The standard
		businesses were there; a telegraph office, jail, saloon, smithy, bank, hotel, general
		store, and doctor's office. Rebecca quickly set out to find the items on the short list.</p>

		<p>She was in the general store, picking up the last item on Josie's
		list, a spool of fine thread for stitching. As she approached the counter, she heard the
		owner and another man talking. She stopped at the end of the isle and listened. Judging
		from the star on the other man's vest, he had to be the sheriff.</p>

		<p>"...I'm telling ya, there ain't no way we're gonna be able
		to hang on to our skins and our belongings both. I say we hand over what they demand and
		ask them to spare our lives."</p>

		<p>"Mike, what makes you think they gonna just take the money
		and git? If'n we give up, they gonna just kill us all anyway. I say we fight 'em,"
		the sheriff replied. "If we can get enough men up on the roofs we can ambush 'em. We
		can't just sit here and wait for 'em to slaughter us like cattle."</p>

		<p>Rebecca moved forward and placed the purchases on the counter.
		The sheriff put his fingers to the brim of his hat and tipped it slightly in
		acknowledgment of the young lady. Mike smiled as he wrapped up her order. "Two bits,
		miss."</p>

		<p>"Who are you talking about?" She asked as she handed
		him the coins. "You're not from 'round here, are ya?" Mike asked.</p>

		<p>"No, I'm just passing through."</p>

		<p>"Well, I hope your husband is well armed. The Caram gang is
		heading this way." The name was well known to Rebecca. This gang of thieves was
		famous for their brutality, and their skill at eluding capture. As far as she knew none of
		them had ever been apprehended, and their numbers increased constantly. </p>

		<p>"Are you going to fight them?"</p>

		<p>"There'r too many of 'em. We're mostly farmers. We don't got
		the skills or the know how to fight 'em." He looked at the storeowner, then back at
		her. "I suggest you head back 't where you come from 'n warn 'em. A farmer from just
		over the ridge said he saw their camp yesterday, about a days ride from here. I reckon
		they'll be riding through here at first light t'morrow."</p>

		<p>As Rebecca headed back to the edge of town, she noticed the
		multitude of women and small children. She had heard the stories about the Caram gang.
		Even children were not safe from those murdering cutthroats. She quickened her pace, and
		her feet protested the abuse. Her shoes were better than the boots, but still pained her
		quite a bit.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie came out from behind some trees after making certain that
		Rebecca was alone. "Did you get everything?" She asked as she approached.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Josie, have you heard of the Caram gang?"</p>

		<p>"Not a decent one in the lot from what I hear," she
		said as she took the goods out of Rebecca's hands and began to stash it in her saddlebags.</p>

		<p>"They're going to ride into Mason's Gulch tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"Then I think we'd better put some distance between us and
		Mason's Gulch before the sun goes down," the gunslinger said as she tightened the
		strap on the saddlebag. Rebecca stared at her thunderstruck, unable to believe any woman
		could be so callous about the lives of innocent people. Josie stared back until the
		younger woman at last looked away. Rebecca turned on her heel, and marched off toward
		town.</p>

		<p>"Where are you going?" the outlaw asked.</p>

		<p>Without turning back Rebecca replied, "I'm going to do what
		I can to help those people." </p>

		<p>"You'll just get yourself killed, and that's no help to
		anyone," Josie said sharply.</p>

		<p>Rebecca paused and said over her shoulder, "Maybe so. But at
		least I will have tried." She started up again and had gone several yards down the
		road when Josie called after her. </p>

		<p>"What are their defenses?" Josie couldn't see the smile
		that lit up Rebecca's face because she looked very serious by the time she turned around
		and came back to where the gunslinger stood.</p>

		<p>"I heard the sheriff say that they don't think they can
		stand up to the gang. Josie, there's children in that town. Those killers won't
		care."</p>

		<p>"What makes you think I do?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know." Rebecca stared into the blue eyes of
		the outlaw. This time it was Josie who broke the eye contact; it was too unnerving.
		"I guess I just don't think you would let small children die."</p>

		<p>"If I go into that town, they'll hang me from a rope before
		sundown."</p>

		<p>"No they won't. Josie, you're their only hope. Come into
		town with me. We'll meet with the townsfolk. I'm sure they'll want your help."</p>

		<p>"I can't go into town, Rebecca. It's too dangerous. Do you
		know what they'll do to you if they find out you're with me?"</p>

		<p>"If the Caram gang destroys this town, Chancetown is next.
		They have to listen to me. I have an idea. Stay here." Rebecca turned and ran back to
		town, ignoring the still burning ache in her overused leg muscles and the sting of her
		blistered feet.</p>

		<p>"This had better be good," Josie muttered to herself as
		she went back into the cover of the trees. A thin smile crept to her lips as she realized
		that her clever companion had once again bamboozled her.</p>

		<p>If there was one thing that the outlaw hated, it was waiting.
		Almost an hour passed before she heard the sound of jingling harness and crept out of the
		cover of the trees to see who it was. Rebecca was directing the driver of the buckboard
		toward the clump of trees where Josie waited, and a second man rode in the bed of the
		wagon. Josie remained in the bushes, although her senses told her that the trio was more
		likely to be in fear of her than to pose any threat to her. Neither man was armed; the one
		with the badge pinned to his chest wore a holster, but it was empty. The older man did not
		look as if he had ever handled a gun in his life.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" Rebecca called as she peered at the thick
		brush, looking for the dark clad woman. Several nervous seconds passed before the
		gunslinger stepped out into the open, her hands resting on the handles of her guns.
		"Good, I knew you'd wait. This is Mayor McGregor," she motioned toward the
		portly man on her left. He nodded nervously. "And this is Tom Glance, the sheriff of
		Mason's Gulch."</p>

		<p>"Ma'am," Tom acknowledged her with a tip of his hat.
		Josie nodded at each of the men. The sheriff had taken a great chance coming out here
		unarmed to meet a known killer, and to top it off was also polite and respectful.
		"Sheriff. I understand that you require assistance in keeping the Caram gang out of
		your town. I'm willing to do what I can to help, but I need certain assurances before I
		do."</p>

		<p>"Anything. We ain't rich or nothin', but we kin give ya
		whatever we got."</p>

		<p>"All I need is oats for my horse and some salt pork."</p>

		<p>"That's all?" Tom looked at her incredulously. It made
		no sense to him that this outlaw didn't mention money. Of course he wasn't about to bring
		it up. Josie realized what he was thinking and gave a feral grin.</p>

		<p>"Little man, if what I wanted was your town's money there'd
		be nothing left for that band of killers tomorrow." She fingered the butt of her gun.
		Satisfied that they had reached an understanding of sorts, Josie whistled for Phoenix.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Despite grumbling from some of the townsfolk about "that
		damned fool woman's hare brained plan," Josie was able to get them into position
		before daybreak. At both ends of the main street leading into and out of town men waited
		with wagons positioned ready to move them to prevent the gang's escape. On the rooftops
		over looking the street the younger men and women who didn't know how to use guns were
		stationed with bottles filled with coal oil and sulfur matches. If Josie and the other
		armed people could not stop them, the plan was to toss the flaming bottles into their
		midst. Josie hoped it didn't come to that, since the flames could just as easily consume
		the buildings that were dry as tinder. Once the preparations were in order, all they could
		do was wait. Josie remained perched on top of a building, her eyes constantly scanning
		both the street below and the vast expanse of land beyond the edge of town. Rebecca
		willingly agreed to stay back in the jailhouse and wait for her. Josie didn't trust the
		town's only saloon to be a safe place for the young prairie girl.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Two hours after sunup a small cloud of dust on the horizon
		heralded the approach of the Caram gang. Josie gave the hand signal for the others to be
		ready. As she expected the gang moved casually, expecting easy pickings from the small,
		isolated town.</p>

		<p>All the townsfolk remained hidden as the twenty men rode into the
		town. Josie kept the leader within the sight of her Winchester. Once the last outlaw was
		past the wagons, Josie let out a piercing Cherokee war cry. The sound had the desired
		effect. The Caram gang was momentarily confused as they looked for the source of the
		sound. At the same time, the townsfolk moved the wagons, blocking the exits. Rifle barrels
		protruded from the windows of every shop in town, effectively surrounding the gang. John
		Caram, the leader of the group, glared at Josie as he realized the trap.</p>

		<p>"Woman! You've made a mistake. You think we're going to let
		a handful of farmers and a squaw stop us?" He reached for his sidearm; Josie fired
		once, striking him cleanly in the right shoulder. His gun flew from his hand as he howled
		in rage and pain.</p>

		<p>"Anyone else want some lead plums?" she taunted as she
		took aim again, this time at Caram's head. "I suggest you have your men lower their
		weapons unless you all want to shake hands with Saint Peter before nightfall."</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched the entire proceedings from the safety of the
		sheriff's office. She had been standing in the doorway until the sound of the rifle fire
		sent her scurrying under the desk. She only came out when she heard the joyous cheers of
		the townspeople. Stepping out of the building, she was startled by a strong hand clamping
		around her mouth and pulling her into the alley. Rebecca struggled briefly before she
		realized that it was Josie who had grabbed her.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I need you to get the supplies promised me and
		bring them to the glen about a mile west of here," Josie said as she released the
		girl from her grasp. </p>

		<p>"But...."</p>

		<p>"You think that sheriff is going to really let me go?
		There's a one thousand dollar price on my head."</p>

		<p>"But you helped to save the town..." she protested.</p>

		<p>"They don't care about that now. I served a purpose for
		them, now they'll think of the money. I have to get out of here. If you don't want to get
		it for me, that's fine." She turned to walk away. Rebecca reached up and grabbed her
		arm.</p>

		<p>"Josie, I'll be there. Leave me the horse we got from those
		men to carry it with and I'll get the things you were promised." Rebecca watched the
		stoic face looking for any kind of acknowledgment that her words had been heard. The
		outlaw walked away, not certain whether she would ever see the runaway again.</p>
