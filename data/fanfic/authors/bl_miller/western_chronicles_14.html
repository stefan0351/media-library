<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 14: Girl Talk -->

<p>They rode in silence for five hours before Josie decided to take
		a break. Finding a shady area, she pulled Phoenix to a stop and helped Rebecca down before
		dismounting herself. Removing the saddlebag that held the stash of food that Belle packed
		for them, Josie walked over and sat down with her back supported by a large tree.
		"She packed enough food for an army," she quipped as Rebecca sat across from her
		and took the offered piece of jerky. She looked at the eagerness with which the young
		woman was eating the dried strip of meat. Rebecca looked up and saw a twinkle in the light
		blue eyes and a slight smile tugging at the gunslinger's lips. She rolled her eyes and
		Josie chuckled, dissipating the tension that always seemed to be present around them.
		Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad having her around, the gunslinger thought as she passed the
		canteen of water to her. A momentary pang of lost innocence tugged at her and Josie let
		the thought pass from her mind. Once they got to Tombstone, Rebecca would just have to
		find someone else to take care of her, that was all there was to it, she thought.
		Oblivious to the outlaw's internal struggle, Rebecca chattered away while she ate.
		"You know," she said as she shoved a piece of bread in her mouth, "you
		could always become a bounty hunter." </p>

		<p>"A bounty hunter?" Josie spat contemptuously.
		"They're the lowest form of life on the earth. Nothing but money hungry murderers
		who'd kill ya as soon as look at ya." She pulled a hunk of bread off of the loaf and
		put it in her mouth. </p>

		<p>"It's a perfectly 'legal' profession," Rebecca urged,
		pulling her head back slightly when she saw Josie's eyes narrow at her inflection of
		'legal'. "I mean, uh, that you could make money that way, and you'd probably be able
		to get pardons if you catch someone big enough." </p>

		<p>Too fast for Rebecca to react, Josie moved forward, closing the
		distance between them until all that the young woman could see was the deepness of her
		blue eyes, which were flaring. "You want me to hunt down people that I used to ride
		with? To help the law when all they want to do is see me hanging from a noose?"
		</p>

		<p>"And why would they want to do that to you, Josie?" She
		took a deep breath in fear of going too far for the temperamental outlaw. "Perhaps if
		you tried to help make the world a little better, like you did in Mason's Gulch, maybe
		they wouldn't be so quick to wrap a rope around your neck." </p>

		<p>A long silence passed between them before Josie leaned back
		against the tree. "It's easier to rob trains," she said casually, not realizing
		that she had fallen into the trap set by the young woman. </p>

		<p>"Uh huh, but think about this...people don't usually shoot
		at you when you bring another criminal into town. They look at you as a hero, not a
		villain. Besides, think of how much fun it would be to put some of your enemies behind
		bars." The faraway look in the outlaw's eyes told her that she had found an opening.
		"All those who betrayed you, who hurt women and children and are still running
		around; wouldn't you like to see them get what they deserve?" </p>

		<p>Just when Rebecca thought she had Josie right where she wanted
		her, the outlaw looked at her and spoke calmly. "I don't care. As long as they stay
		out of my way, I'll stay out of theirs." She shrugged her shoulders and continued to
		eat. Josie's features hid her amusement at the scowl on the younger woman's face. Rebecca
		decided that the rest of the meal would be a silent affair while she thought up a new
		plan. No matter how hard the outlaw tried to be rough and mean, the young woman knew deep
		down inside she was a kind and gentle person who could and would do the right thing if
		given the chance. As the day wore on and they were once again on their way, Rebecca's mind
		filled with questions that she wanted to ask but didn't dare. What caused Josie to become
		a criminal in the first place? Did she have a family? Time passed quickly as both women
		remained lost in their own thoughts. Josie concentrated on the words exchanged during
		dinner. </p>

		<p>When darkness settled across the land, Josie pulled off the dirt
		trail and found a suitable area for bunking down for the night. The gunslinger
		concentrated on cleaning her weapons and sharpening her knives while Rebecca tried out her
		sewing skills by mending a tear in her blanket while reciting more of her story about
		Benedict Arnold before moving on to Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys. Josie
		half-listened, nodding occasionally but doing nothing to discourage the conversation. When
		it came time for sleep, the women laid their blankets out on the ground on opposite sides
		of the fire. "Good night, Josie," she said before letting out a long yawn. She
		closed her eyes, not expecting an answer. </p>

		<p>"Good night, Rebecca," the outlaw answered softly.
