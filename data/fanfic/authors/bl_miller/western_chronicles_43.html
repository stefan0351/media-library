<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 43: Abduction -->

<p>Caleb watched as the sheriff walked down the street and into the
		little diner. He had seen Rebecca go into the office some twenty minutes earlier and a
		short time later had seen the two Indians come out. He was reasonably certain there was
		nobody left inside but his daughter and the half-breed, and she was behind lock and key.
		He figured he didn?t have much time before the sheriff returned, so if he was going
		to act, it had to be now. He wouldn?t be able to get Rebecca out of town until the
		late afternoon train, but he had already found an abandoned house right on the edge of
		town where he could hide her until departure time. A grin spread over his face as he
		walked quickly across the street and stepped through the door behind which his reward was
		waiting.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Sound?s like John?s back," Josie said when
		she heard the sound of the outer door.</p>

		<p>"He hasn?t had time to get your breakfast. I wonder if
		something?s wrong? I?d better go check." She had been sitting on a stool
		right outside Josie?s cell, and she rose and walked to the door. Josie listened to
		the sounds of the footfalls in the other room and furrowed her brow. It didn?t sound
		like John?s tread.</p>

		<p>"Wait a minute, Rebecca. Don?t go out there?"
		she began, but Rebecca had already stepped through the door. Josie heard a muffled yelp
		and the sound of the tin can with Rebecca?s coffee hitting the floor.
		"Rebecca!" Her heart clutched in her chest as she listened to the sound of a
		scuffle. She grabbed the bars and screamed again at the top of her lungs,
		"Rebecca!" But the footfalls had already receded toward the back door of the
		jail. She heard that door open and slam and then all was silent.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>When John came back fifteen minutes later he was greeted by the
		sound of Josie banging on the bars of her cell with the tin cup that had held her coffee.</p>

		<p>"Keep your shirt on! I?ve got your breakfast," he
		called with a smile on his face. Then he saw the other cup lying on the floor in a puddle
		of coffee, and he dumped the plate of food on his desk, drew his gun, and ran to the
		cells. Other than the drunk in the cell next to Josie?s who hadn?t stirred once
		all morning despite the din, there was only Josie back there.</p>

		<p>"John! He?s taken Rebecca!"</p>

		<p>"Who has?" He asked, putting his gun back in his
		holster.</p>

		<p>"I don?t know; I didn?t see him. But there was
		only one person?s footsteps out there."</p>

		<p>"It?s almost certainly her father."</p>

		<p>"Of course," she said bitterly striking her fist
		against the wall. "With everything going on I had almost forgotten about him. John,
		you?ve got to let me go after him."</p>

		<p>"You know I can?t do that, Miss Josie. I?ll go
		after him." She shook her head vigorously.</p>

		<p>"You said you had to get the schoolhouse ready before court
		could begin, John. Let me go. I can track him and get her and come to the schoolhouse by
		nine. Please ? I swear I won?t try to run away; I just have to make sure
		she?s safe before I go into that court room."</p>

		<p>"I shouldn?t be doing this," John muttered as he
		pulled the key ring off of his belt and walked toward her cell. "I?ll lose my
		job ? or worse ? if you don?t show up in court by nine, Miss Josie."
		He unlocked the door and she sprang out like a cat freed from a cage.</p>

		<p>She paused long enough to grasp his hand and pump it a few times.
		"You have my word, John. I?ll be there by nine; I?ll wait outside while
		Rebecca comes in to get you, and we?ll act as if you just brought me over from the
		jail."</p>

		<p>"Promise me you won?t kill him."</p>

		<p>"I won?t kill him," she said over her shoulder as
		she stepped out the back door. Under her breath she muttered, "but he?ll wish to
		hell he was dead when I?m through with him."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>A child would have had no difficulty following the tracks of the
		two people from the jail to a tumble down cabin on the outskirts of town. Clearly she had
		resisted him the entire way, and as often as not beside the odd indentation left by his
		unevenly worn boot were the drag marks from Rebecca?s heels. Josie?s anger grew
		with every step she took, and she was glad she did not have a gun or it would be very
		difficult to keep her promise to John.</p>

		<p>There were no windows in the little one room cabin, but one
		opening in the wall was covered with oilcloth, so even though she couldn?t see she
		could hear every sound from within. She crouched silently outside trying to determine from
		which part of the room the voices were coming so that she could decide whether to go
		through the door or the empty window frame.</p>

		<p>"?knew you were hatchin? up some scheme with that
		damned Injun sheriff, and I ain?t gonna run the risk of you doin? something to
		free that bitch. I don?t give a damn what you do after she?s safely back in the
		states and I?ve got my money. Now you stop wigglin? and keep your hands behind
		your back so I can tie them."</p>

		<p>"Pa, please don?t do this. If it?s money you want
		I can raise enough to equal the reward, or even more if you?ll just leave us alone.
		They?ll kill her if they get her back there, and she doesn?t deserve?"</p>

		<p>"She deserves every damned punishment they want to heap on
		her, and more! She?s a murderin? thief and a defiler of innocent young women.
		And you," his voice was full of venom as he spoke, and Josie had to force herself to
		stay where she was, she wanted so badly to rush in there and choke the life out of him.
		She could almost see the hatred in his eyes as he continued to berate his daughter.
		"You?re a disgrace to your family and an abomination in the eyes of the lord.
		You probably egged her on like you done them poor fools she killed back there to home. Oh,
		yeah, they found the bodies. Figure your girlfriend did them in for their horses and the
		silver in their pockets."</p>

		<p>"They were trying to rape me." Rebecca?s voice was
		a hiss. Clearly she no longer believed she had a chance of reasoning with the man and she
		held nothing back. "You?d rather a gang of men rape me than one woman love me,
		wouldn?t you? What kind of father?"</p>

		<p>"I?m not your father!" He said sharply cutting her
		off in mid sentence. "Your Ma had a roll in the hay with that music teacher right
		before he up and left town. I may not be the smartest man in the world, but I know how to
		count to nine, and I sure as hell wasn?t there when she got pregnant with you. She
		finally admitted it to me when you were a little girl, after we?. Well, it don?t
		matter, I ain?t your Pa. And since we ain?t blood relations it wouldn?t be
		a sin if I was to get a little taste of what you been handing out to that Injun, now would
		it?"</p>

		<p>That was as much as Josie could take. She quickly walked several
		paces away from the building and then turned and ran toward the oilcloth, diving through
		with her arms straight out in front of her as if she were plunging into water. The
		oilcloth tore free of the window frame and landed on Caleb who was just beginning to
		wonder what the commotion was all about. A moment later Josie landed on top of him as
		well, propelling him to the far wall, which he hit with a loud thump. The air was knocked
		out of him and he slowly crumpled to the floor still not knowing what hit him. She gave
		him a solid kick to the crotch just to keep him down, and he screamed like a pig being
		slaughtered. She lifted up the oilcloth covering his head just enough to see if he was
		truly out, and satisfied that he was not going anywhere for a while she turned to Rebecca
		who was tied to a chair.</p>

		<p>"Josie, thank God! How did you?"</p>

		<p>"No time to explain now. We have to get your fath -I mean
		him," she said with a sneer, "tied up and gagged before he comes around.
		I?d just as soon he didn?t know it was me that took him out." Her hands
		worked at the knots around Rebecca?s ankles as she spoke, and as soon as she was free
		she began trussing up Caleb?s feet. "Tie his bandanna around his mouth for a gag
		and help me tie his hands and feet together."</p>

		<p>Rebecca did as she asked and within minutes he was lying on his
		side with his hands and feet bound together behind his back. He would not be able to do
		much more than turn over onto his stomach. Josie covered him with the oilcloth so that
		someone casually glancing through the open window frame would not see anything but a heap
		of fabric in the corner. That should do until the sheriff could come and free him. She
		took Rebecca?s hand and pulled her in for a quick kiss.</p>

		<p>"Follow me," Josie said taking Rebecca?s hand once
		again and leading her out of the cabin. She skirted behind the buildings when they arrived
		in town until she was behind the church, which was the closest building to the
		schoolhouse. She crouched behind a large bush and whispered to Rebecca, "Go tell John
		where I am. He should be in there waiting for you. Hurry. It?s almost nine."</p>

		<p>"Josie, why are you doing this? You?re free; you could
		run. I could meet up with you somewhere?"</p>

		<p>"No. I?m not running any more. I made a promise to
		John, and I?m going to keep it. Go now? please. I?ll see you again inside.
		I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you, too." She leaned down and kissed the top
		of Josie?s head and then walked away without looking back.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca threaded her way through the people on the steps of the
		schoolhouse, some of whom looked at her as if to question why she thought she should be
		allowed in the building, but she carefully avoided looking into any of their faces and
		simply pressed on. Every seat in the schoolhouse was taken, and people stood against the
		walls and in the cloakroom. Those who weren?t lucky enough to find a space on the
		wall sat on the steps of the small building or stood talking in small groups on the school
		grounds.</p>

		<p>John was just inside the door, watching intently for Rebecca to
		appear. When he last looked at his watch he saw that it was ten minutes until nine, and
		with every minute that passed his anxiety level rose until he felt certain he was going to
		collapse from sheer worry. The sight of the little blonde making her way up the steps made
		him almost want to cheer, and he stepped outside to intercept her.</p>

		<p>"There?s a seat for you up front; some friends of yours
		are saving it for you. I?m going to go get the prisoner now." He deliberately
		spoke loud enough for those in the vicinity to hear.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Sheriff. Lord knows we need a friend right about
		now." She emphasized the words "lord" and "friend", and cut her
		eyes in the direction of the church. John nodded imperceptibly to show that he got the
		message, and he hurried off in the direction of the jail. He passed by the church on the
		way, and as soon as he was out of sight of the school, he doubled back and went down the
		side yard between two buildings and came up behind the church.</p>

		<p>At first he thought he must have misunderstood after all, as he
		saw no sign of the outlaw, but he softly said, "Miss Josie, are you here?" There
		was a rustling in the bushes and the black clad woman emerged. Relieved, he walked to
		where she stood brushing off leaves and dirt and a smile lit up his face.
		"You?ll never know how happy I am to see you," he said sincerely.</p>

		<p>"Been kicking yourself ever since you unlocked that cell,
		have you?" Her tone was light, but the slight flush that appeared on his face told
		her she was on the mark. She laughed softly. "You?ve been good to us, John.
		There?s no way I?d put your livelihood on the line, even if I thought I could
		have made a break for it. The running ends here. One way or another."</p>

		<p>He held up a pair of handcuffs and she extended her hands.
		"Sorry to have to do this, Miss Josie." The teeth on the cuffs clicked into
		place, but he stopped when they were still comfortable. "Let?s go in the back
		door of the jail and come out the front," he said. "Try to keep out of sight in
		the meantime."</p>

		<p>"No problem. Let?s go."</p>
