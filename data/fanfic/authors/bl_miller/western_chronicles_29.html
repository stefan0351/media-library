<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 29: The Gift -->

<p>Josie left the bank with her small pile of bills. She met Elaine
		at the trading post and spent most of the money getting the vast amount of supplies they
		would need to keep nine women going for the length of the journey. The gunslinger insisted
		on staying away from the smaller towns along the way, as the large group of women would
		most surely be noticed. Even with the two horses, the load in the wagon made for slow
		going. On impulse, Josie went to the Express office and wired money and a telegram on to
		Cheyenne.</p>

		<p>"Ready?" Elaine asked as the gunslinger returned from
		the Express office and climbed up on the wagon. She nodded and took the reins, sending the
		horses into motion. She came to a sudden stop in front of the doctor's office.</p>

		<p>"Stay here, I'll be right back," Josie said as she
		hopped down and entered the small building. She returned a few minutes later with a large,
		heavy, dusty book which she put on the seat between her and Elaine. "Rebecca likes to
		read," was her reply to the curious look she received from the black headed harlot.
		As they rode back to the camp, Elaine noticed that the gunslinger used her new bandanna to
		wipe away the years of built up dust on the large book. By the time they reached the
		others, no one would have known the book had resided on a bottom shelf in a back closet of
		the doctor's office for the last ten years.</p>

		<p>They pulled up and were quickly surrounded by the women,
		excitedly asking about the bounty or looking at the fresh load of supplies. Rebecca
		spotted the small jar of pickles. She was working on the latch that held the Mason jar
		closed when Victoria came over to see what she was up to. They each took a pickle and
		munched happily. Josie came up behind Rebecca and tapped her on the shoulder. "I want
		to show you something."</p>

		<p>They walked over to their wagon. "I bought you
		something," Josie said a bit nervously as she leaned over the edge of the buckboard
		and hefted out the medical text.</p>

		<p>"Oh...oh my," Rebecca exclaimed as she took the book
		from the gunslinger. Even though she knew it was heavy, she wasn't quite prepared for the
		weight and Josie had to make a lightening move to keep it from dropping on the young
		woman's toes. Rebecca opened the book, supporting the spine on the edge of the wagon, and
		flipped through the pages reverently, her fingers running over the lines of text and
		drawings.</p>

		<p>"It's a beginner's medical text," Josie said, stating
		the obvious to the overjoyed blonde. Rebecca set the book back in the wagon and gave the
		gunslinger a huge hug.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much," she gushed as she continued to
		squeeze against Josie. The appreciation was so genuine and the affection so honest that
		the normally stoic bounty hunter smiled and gave Rebecca's shoulders a gentle squeeze.
		When she pulled back, Josie frowned as she saw the tears spilling out from her green eyes.
		She fought the urge to wipe them from the blonde's cheeks. 'I won't get attached to you,
		Rebecca,' she thought to herself, but couldn't stop asking,</p>

		<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

		<p>"It's just that...well no one ever bought me something
		so...so wonderful before," she said as she wiped the tears from her face. "I
		don't know what to say." She looked up at the gunslinger with a smile that could warm
		the coldest of hearts. Josie smiled, but clearly looked uncomfortable. Rebecca realized
		this and gave the gunslinger a gentle squeeze on the forearm. "Thank you,
		Josie."</p>

		<p>"Sure. Glad you like it. I'd better go help get the gear
		unloaded."</p>

		<p>"Uh, yeah, right. Good idea," Rebecca said, the smile
		never leaving her face. As soon as the gunslinger left, she pulled the book out and sat on
		the ground. She didn't move until dinnertime except to turn the page. Had someone paid
		close attention to Josie, they would have noticed her smile every time she looked over at
		the voracious reader.</p>

		<p>Dinner of salt pork and beans was eaten in shifts, as they had
		only the few plates they had taken from the men whose final stupid plan had involved an
		attempted rape of Rebecca. Only a few utensils were purchased since the money was best
		used on meats and supplies. The funds that Josie spent on Rebecca's book kept her from
		getting a keg of ale she'd been looking forward to, but the gunslinger had no regrets.
		Rebecca was still sitting against the wagon with the book in her lap. She was eating and
		reading at the same time, trying to absorb as much as possible before the sun set for the
		evening. Victoria tried to talk to her a couple of times, but the blonde smiled
		apologetically and pointed at the book. Only when the light became so dim that it hurt her
		eyes to read did Rebecca set the book back gingerly in the wagon and join the others.
		Josie sat apart from the rest, leaning against a tree cleaning her guns. She frowned at
		the multitude of fingerprints that littered her Winchester. 'What'd they do, all take
		turns touching it?' she wondered as she ran the oily cloth up and down the barrel.</p>

		<p>For the next several days, the routine stayed the same. Up at
		dawn, ride until noon, rest for a while, ride until almost sunset, and then camp for the
		night. The bumpy ride made it impossible for Rebecca to read so she spent most of her time
		in the back of the wagon with Victoria. The supplies were split between the two wagons
		since the women were now riding the horses taken from the dead men. Josie drove her wagon
		with Phoenix tethered behind while Stacey's wagon brought up the rear with the extra
		horses nestled safely between them. While the gunslinger appreciated the respite from the
		blonde's usual chatter, she found herself listening every so often to the two young women
		talking behind her, smiling when she heard Rebecca tell something funny. Even though the
		blonde became close to the women - Victoria in particular - Josie kept her distance from
		the group whenever possible. Every so often she would exchange a knowing glance at Elaine,
		but never did she approach her. Both understood the reasons why. Repeat performances
		create complications.</p>

		<p>The late summer sun gave way to an unseasonably cold night. The
		fire gave off some heat, but there was no way for all nine women to sleep around it.
		Several of the women coupled off to share body heat and blankets; only Stacey remained
		alone, taking up the fourth side of the fire. Rebecca set hers and Josie's blankets down
		next to the wagon in a heap. "Josie, aren't we sleeping by the fire?" she asked
		as she watched the gunslinger remove the items from the ground and setting them neatly
		back in the wagon.</p>

		<p>"No, there's not enough room. And it'll be warmer up here in
		the back of the wagon than on the ground." She pulled the sheepskin from the seat and
		laid it out in the back and covered it with one of her blankets. Rebecca walked to the
		other side of the wagon and helped to straighten out the covers as they made their
		makeshift bed. Without thinking, she pulled Josie's rolled up duster out of the pile of
		belongings and set it at the head of the blankets. The gunslinger arched an eyebrow and
		looked at her for an explanation.</p>

		<p>"Oh, this? Well, I uh...kinda borrowed it," Rebecca
		said sheepishly. Josie reached out and moved the duster from the blonde's side of the
		wagon to her side.</p>

		<p>"If it's going to be used as a pillow, at least I should be
		the one to use it."</p>

		<p>There was enough room between them for a third person to have fit
		comfortably, yet Josie still felt the young woman shiver. She mentally berated herself for
		not making space for Rebecca at the fire. The gunslinger hadn't counted on the temperature
		dropping quite so much. She moved closer and pressed her body up against the young woman's
		back. "I didn't think it would be this cold," she said apologetically.</p>

		<p>"I didn't say anything," Rebecca said softly, yet her
		body instinctively moved closer to Josie's, craving the body heat.</p>

		<p>"I know. Lift your head," she said, placing part of the
		rolled up duster under Rebecca's head. Their bodies shifted and moved as they adjusted to
		each other. Josie wasn't totally certain she could sleep so close to another person. Even
		during the night with Elaine, she slept on her side of the bed, making certain there was
		space between them. She laid awake for a few moments as one thought continued to race
		through her mind. "Why?"</p>

		<p>"Hmm?", the half-awake blonde responded.</p>

		<p>"Why, Rebecca?" she propped herself up on one elbow and
		looked down at her. "Why didn't you tell me you were so cold?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca rolled onto her back and looked up, the gunslinger's blue
		eyes demanding the truth. "I...I didn't want you to think I couldn't handle one night
		in the cold," she said in a small voice, unsure of what Josie's reaction would be.
		The gunslinger understood the implication behind the words.</p>

		<p>"Roll over." She settled back down and wrapped one long
		arm around the blonde woman's waist. "Don't do that again. And I don't think
		that," she added softly. She felt Rebecca relax against her, soon falling into a deep
		sleep. The gunslinger laid awake a while longer, watching the steady rise and fall of the
		young woman's chest and wondering just what it was about the little sprite that made her
		care so much about her. Years of running and depending on no one but herself had built a
		wall of armor around her heart that no one could penetrate. Josie cared for no one and no
		one cared for her. That was just how it was and she always felt comfortable with that
		fact. Then came Rebecca; in a mere three months she had managed to make the gunslinger
		care for her, enough to give up her own personal pleasures for the sake of a smile.
		"My friend," she whispered to the sleeping form in front of her. Josie allowed
		herself to relax and be lulled to sleep by the blonde's gentle snoring.</p>

		<p>Unlike the previous nights, there were no nightmares to disturb
		the gunslinger's sleep. She had been grateful that Elaine slept deeply and wasn't wakened
		by her tossing about the night before. It was a well-rested and refreshed Josie that faced
		the morning.</p>
