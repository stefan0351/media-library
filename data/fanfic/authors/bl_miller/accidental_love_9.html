<!-- Accidental Love \ Part 9 -->

<p>"Good morning, Maria." Rose wheeled her way into the kitchen, following the
			scent of fresh baked cinnamon rolls.</p>
		<p>"And a good morning to you too, Rose. Would you like some coffee?"</p>
		<p>"I'd love a cup, thank you."</p>
		<p>"I'll bring it over to the table." The housekeeper reached into the cupboard
			and removed a mug without looking at it. By the time she realized which one she had
			grabbed, she'd already added the cream and sugar. "Well, I guess Ronnie will have to
			use another mug."</p>
		<p>"You gave me her favorite again, didn't you?" Rose asked with a smile. It was
			another one of Ronnie's little quirks. Her morning coffee was always served in a black mug
			with the words "The Boss" across it.</p>
		<p>"I'm afraid I did. I'll dump it out and give you another one."</p>
		<p>"No, don't bother. Ronnie can live without her Boss mug for one day." It
			actually amused Rose that with the dozens of mugs that filled the cupboard, her friend was
			so attached to that particular one.</p>
		<p>"Now you know she likes her coffee in that cup," Maria admonished.</p>
		<p>"It's good for her to change her routine from time to time," came the playful
			reply as she took the mug from the older woman.</p>
		<p>"And what are you two up to?" Ronnie asked as she entered the room. She
			picked the newspaper up and glanced at the headline before she noticed. "Stealing my
			favorite mug?" She crossed behind the young woman and sat down in the chair next to
			her.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry, I know who is really the boss around here," Rose replied as she
			took a sip.</p>
		<p>"Sometimes I wonder," Ronnie joked back. "Think you'll try to send me an
			email today?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, you wrote down what to do, didn't you?"</p>
		<p>"It's next to the computer." She looked up to see Maria coming over with her
			coffee. She looked at the mug quizzically. "Where'd this one come from?" It was
			a Far Side cartoon mug with two deer on it. One had a bright red bulls-eye on its chest.
			The caption underneath said 'Hell of a birthmark, Hal.' Ronnie chuckled and drank from it.</p>
		<p>"See, change is good," Rose said over the lip of her mug. Maria brought their
			breakfast over along with a carafe of coffee.</p>
		<p>"If you ladies will excuse me, I'm going to get started on the laundry."</p>
		<p>"Okay, thanks Maria."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, thanks."</p>
		<p>Now alone, both women began to eat their breakfast. Ronnie had the fork in one hand and
			the newspaper in the other. Although she scanned the business section, the paper also had
			the added benefit of allowing her to peek over and study Rose unnoticed. The broken legs
			were hidden under the round table. With the soft blonde hair tucked behind her ears,
			Ronnie had an unobstructed view of the soft curve of Rose's cheek, the slight upturn at
			the end of her nose, the rust colored eyebrows that rested above far too green eyes.
			Suddenly those eyes turned and caught her. Ruffling the pages and looking down at the
			paper, Ronnie hoped that the blush she felt wasn't too visible. "Um?I'm thinking
			about easing some of the workload off of Laura. I have some letters that need to be
			updated. It's not that hard to do but it is time consuming. You said you learned how to
			use the mail merge, didn't you?" Her eyes never left the newsprint, although she had
			no idea what the words on the paper were.</p>
		<p>"Um hmm." Rose swallowed and set the cup down. "It was difficult at
			first but once I got the hang of it it's really pretty easy." Inside she was excited.
			<i>Ronnie is giving me real work to do, not just examples and tests in the computer
				programs. Real work that needs to be done and she's trusting me with it.</i> "I'll
			make sure it's done right away and I promise there will be no mistakes."
		</p>
		<p>Behind the paper, the executive smiled at the enthusiastic tone. "I'll email the
			files to you as soon as I get to work. I'm sure you'll have no problems with it." She
			set the business section of the paper down and poured herself another cup of coffee.
			"Well, let's see who the police picked up last night," Ronnie said as she picked
			up the local section. She flipped through the pages until she found the police blotter
			report listing all the people who were arrested or appeared in court. She spotted the name
			of an old high school friend arrested for prostitution. "What?" She pulled the
			paper closer, knocking her coffee cup over in the process. "Damn." She stood up.
			The creamy yellow blouse was now covered down the front with the wet beige of coffee. She
			undid the first few buttons, confirming that it had seeped onto her half slip as well.
			"Maria!" She turned to see the housekeeper come out of the laundry room.
			"Coffee."</p>
		<p>"On silk," Maria tsked. "Veronica Louise, I go through more Woolite with
			you." She shook her head, causing Rose to smirk while sopping up the coffee on the
			table. "Well, get out of those wet things." Ronnie turned to head out of the
			room. "There is no need to be modest right now. You're not going to run upstairs with
			coffee dripping off your blouse. There's enough of a mess to clean right here."</p>
		<p>"Fine." In one quick move the blouse came off followed by the half slip.
			"It got the skirt too." A tug of the zipper and the garment followed the other
			wet clothes into Maria's hands.</p>
		<p>With Ronnie's back to her, Rose let her eyes travel up and down the tall body clad in
			only pantyhose and a lacy creme colored bra. She concentrated but didn't feel the arousal
			that she had experienced the prior evening. What she did feel was guilty for staring at
			her friend's body.
			<i>This is silly. It's just Ronnie. </i>She averted her eyes when the
			half-clothed body turned around, looking up only when she heard the dark-haired woman
			address her. "I'm going upstairs to change."
		</p>
		<p>"Oh, you know what would look really nice on you? Those gray wool slacks and that
			pale blue blouse." Rose thought about the last time she had seen Ronnie wear that
			outfit and about how it highlighted her eyes. "It looks really nice on you."</p>
		<p>"The gray slacks, hmm?" Ronnie remembered how much Rose liked that particular
			combination. Goosebumps raised on her thighs. "I'd better go get changed before I
			freeze to death standing here."</p>
		<p>She returned a few minutes later, admitting to herself that the wool pants were a much
			better idea than the skirt on such a cold morning. "Okay, what do you think?"
			She asked, twirling around with the blazer folded over her arm.</p>
		<p>"Looks great," Rose said. The slacks hugged in all the right places and the
			top outlined her soft curves nicely. "You look?nice."</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Ronnie looked down into sparkling green eyes and smiled.
			"I'll email you those files once I get there." She fought the urge to give the
			young woman a peck on the cheek and settled instead for a squeeze of the shoulder.
			"I'd better get going before the traffic gets too bad."</p>
		<p>"Oh, okay. I'll make sure to have that program up so I can get started as soon as
			it arrives."</p>
		<p>"You don't have to rush, Rose. Whenever you get to them is fine." Privately
			it pleased her to no end to hear the eagerness in her friend's voice. Ronnie had no doubts
			when it came to Rose's work ethic. "I'll try and be home early." At that moment,
			the housekeeper exited the laundry room with the mop and bucket in hand. "I'd better
			get going before Maria finds a new use for that mop."</p>
		<p>"Sometimes," Maria said as she shook her head.</p>
		<p>Ronnie turned her attention to Rose. "I'll call you later."</p>
		<p>"Okay."</p>
		<p>Rose wheeled herself out of the way as the housekeeper began to clean up the mess. The
			bright blue Jeep disappeared from the driveway, leaving the two of them alone.
			<i>It's
				time to get some answers</i>, Rose thought to herself.
		</p>
		<p>"Maria, was it easy for you to learn to use email?"</p>
		<p>"Lords no, child. When Ronnie first gave me that computer I was afraid to turn it
			on. I didn't know what it would do."</p>
		<p>"But now you like it?"</p>
		<p>"I talk to my son in Arizona every night." She pushed the dry mop over the
			last drops of the spill. "You should have seen my phone bills before that."</p>
		<p>"I bet when Ronnie was away at college the phone bills were something."
			<i>Great
				segue, Einstein. Why not just come right out and say let's talk about Stanford, </i>she
			mentally berated herself. "I mean, she's just so close to her family and all."
		</p>
		<p>"When the children were in college it certainly was a trying time around
			here." Maria picked up the breakfast dishes and headed for the dishwasher. "One
			of them was always calling for something or another." She picked up the carafe and
			poured some of the steaming liquid into a cup for herself. "I swear I was down at the
			post office almost every day mailing something to one of them."</p>
		<p>"Let's sit and talk for a while," Rose said, pointing at the empty seat.
			"There's not much that has to be done today and I have to wait for her to send me
			those files."</p>
		<p>"Just for a little while. I do have vacuuming to do. Tabitha sheds more hair than
			any cat I've ever seen," She refilled the young woman's cup. She sat down in the
			offered chair and took a sip of her own coffee. "They certainly were quite a handful
			then."</p>
		<p>"I guess the independence that comes with being away from home must have been too
			much, huh?" She tucked a stray lock of blonde hair behind her ear. "Ronnie sure
			had a rough time of it." She saw the flicker in the older woman's eyes and knew she
			had to tread carefully. "She told me about Chris."</p>
		<p>"That was a very sad thing and not something I care to talk about." Maria
			said, looking down at the table. She drank several swallows of coffee. "Some people
			are just trash, Rose. Plain and simple."</p>
		<p>"Maria, may I ask you a question?" At the reluctant nod, she took a deep
			breath and continued. "Do you think I'm using Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"It doesn't matter what I think. What matters is what
			<i>she</i>
			<b> </b>thinks."
			She drained her mug and gave Rose a serious look. "I would hate to see her get hurt
			like that again."
		</p>
		<p>"I don't know how anyone can know Ronnie for any length of time and want to use
			her," Rose said softly, her gaze flickering from Maria to the table and back again.
			"She has the kindest heart of anyone I know and I don't mean just being generous. It
			must have been devastating for her to trust someone and have that trust shattered."
			She had no idea that the housekeeper's thoughts immediately went to the fully repaired
			Porsche tucked away in the garage. "To be at that age, to have something so private
			exposed to her parents?" Rose shook her head. "I just can't imagine why
			anyone would be so cruel to her. Did you ever meet Chris?"</p>
		<p>"No, the gold digger never showed up here," Maria said. "I only spoke
			with her on the phone."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bingo. </i>The big question was answered.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Delores Bickering drove her rusted out station wagon into the public parking garage and
			pulled into the first empty spot, not caring that it was reserved for the handicapped. If
			she received a ticket, it would end up in the glove box with the rest of the ones she had
			received. Tickets and insurance were not things she chose to spend on her money on. The
			empty cigarette pack hit the ground as she lit the last one and walked away from her car.
			If things went the way she planned, she would have plenty of money for cigarettes before
			the day was over.</p>
		<p>The Cartwrights had always liked things big. When the Wellington Hotel was erected in
			the late 1920's, it towered over the smaller Cartwright building next door. Ronnie's great
			grandfather took it as a challenge and the result was the construction of one of Albany's
			largest buildings, more than thirty stories high. Delores stood in front of it and sneered
			at the large logo carved into the reddish-brown granite above the doors. She pushed her
			way through the revolving door and into the spacious lobby. On the wall was a brass plaque
			welcoming her to the Cartwright Corporate Offices. Below it was a directory of departments
			along with the floors on which they were located.</p>
		<p>Ronnie was just finishing off a fruit cup when the buzzer sounded. "Yes,
			Laura?"</p>
		<p>"Um?there's someone here to see you," the hesitant voice said.</p>
		<p>"Who?" A quick glance at her calendar showed no appointments scheduled for
			that afternoon. She heard her secretary ask the visitor's name and clenched her jaw as
			soon as she recognized the voice. "Keep her out there for a minute." She hung up
			the phone and tapped the mechanical pencil against the desk.
			<i>Damn, what's that bitch
				doing here?</i>
		</p>
		<p>The answer came to her instantly. Her first instinct was to throw Delores out but as
			she opened her mouth to speak, Ronnie noticed something that changed her mind. Swiveling
			around in her seat, she reached for the mouse and clicked on the security icon. Her
			password and a few clicks later, a small red light lit up on the security camera tucked
			discreetly in the upper corner of her office. It was time to expose Delores Bickering for
			what she really was. "Send her in."</p>
		<p>"Nice office," the large woman nodded approvingly as she looked around.
			"You hiring?"</p>
		<p>"No." Ronnie could not believe she had the nerve to even ask such a question.
			"You're not here to ask me about a job."</p>
		<p>"I came to talk to you about Rose." She unzipped her dirty yellow jacket and
			pulled her knit cap off, sending flakes of wet snow onto the thick burgundy rug. "You
			know I'm the closest thing to a mother she's ever had."</p>
		<p>"So you say."
			<i>Oops, wouldn't want Rose to see me being hostile to the
				bitch. </i>Forcing a polite smile to her face, she said in her most solicitous voice,
			"So what is it you wished to see me about? Please, have a seat."
		</p>
		<p>Delores flopped down on the couch and tossed her coat on the far cushion. "I would
			have thought someone like you would have coffee for your visitors." She looked
			pointedly at the empty coffeepot on the side table. "Especially those who are
			relatives to your friends."</p>
		<p>Ronnie's eyes narrowed but she kept her tongue. "You said you wanted to talk to me
			about Rose?"</p>
		<p>"I've found a way to help her out."</p>
		<p>"Help her out?" </p>
		<p>"Yeah." The large woman sat up. "I've found her a job in Cobleskill. She
			can start on Monday. It pays six dollars an hour."</p>
		<p>"Why would she want to work in Cobleskill? That's an hour away. Besides, didn't
			you notice that she has two broken legs? She's in no condition to work."</p>
		<p>"It's in a telemarketing office. She won't have to stand up, just talk on the
			phone. Of course that means she'll have to move back with me."</p>
		<p>"She already told you she wants to live with me. Why would she change her mind
			now?"
			<i>What stunt are you trying to pull? Make Rose choose between us? I'll be
				damned if I'll let you take her away from me.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Delores shook her head. "You don't understand. Rose and I have a deal. She owes me
			for taking care of her and promised to help out in any way she could."</p>
		<p>"Let me get this straight. You want her to move back with you and work at this
			telemarketing job so she can give you money?"</p>
		<p>"I think that's only fair. She lived under my roof and ate my food for years
			without paying anything and now it's time for her to pay me back." Delores crossed
			her arms and leaned back.</p>
		<p>"So she owes you for everything you did for her when she lived with you?" It
			sounded ridiculous but no one was laughing.
			<i>I can't believe you. Rose deserves so much
				better in her life than a piece of trash like you.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"You could look at it that way. I look at it this way. I could have rented her
			room to someone who would have paid me. She owes me the money I lost by not being able to
			rent it. When she left I had to start paying for a babysitter on bingo and bowling nights.
			My generosity can only go so far. I'm not rich, you know. I can't afford to be as
			charitable as you."</p>
		<p>
			<i>As?</i> Ronnie gripped the edge of her desk.
			<i>You bitch.</i> She now had no
			doubt about Delores' reason for coming to her office.
		</p>
		<p>"You decided that Rose owes you money because she lived with you when she was a
			teenager, is that right?"</p>
		<p>"Exactly."</p>
		<p>"And since she owes you all this money you feel she should move in with you and
			work at this job so she can pay off what she owes you, right?"</p>
		<p>"Right."</p>
		<p>Ronnie's lips pulled back into a smile much like a cobra just before it strikes.</p>
		<p>"But since I'm her friend you thought you'd come and see if there was something I
			could do, right?"</p>
		<p>"Well, we're not talking about much to someone like you. If you're really her
			friend I'd think you'd want to help her out." Delores said indignantly.</p>
		<p>"And I could help Rose out by paying off her debt to you, is that the idea?"
			Ronnie was tired of the game and the dirty looking woman who was trying to use Rose.
			<i>Time
				to get to the point.</i> "How much?"
		</p>
		<p>"Well, you have to take into account how long she lived with me and
			then?"</p>
		<p>"I said how much?" Ronnie did her best to keep the hostility out of her tone.
			"Come on, I'm sure you had a figure in mind when you walked in here. How much do you
			think Rose owes you for taking care of her?" She pulled the checkbook out of the
			drawer and opened it up.</p>
		<p>"Five?no, ten thousand."</p>
		<p>"Ten thousand dollars and you'll walk away and leave Rose alone?"</p>
		<p>Dollar signs danced in front of Delores' eyes and greed sang in her heart. She almost
			agreed, then she realized that the rich woman was giving in much too easily.
			"Wait." She stood up and walked over to the desk, leaning her chubby hands on
			the polished wood. "What if I said I wanted fifteen thousand or even twenty?"</p>
		<p>"Is that what it would take?"</p>
		<p>"You're really willing to give me twenty thousand dollars?" Suspicion set in.
			"Why?"</p>
		<p>"I have my reasons." She picked up the pen to write the check and stopped
			herself. She had no intention of using the pen that Rose got her. Reaching into the drawer
			she pulled out another one and began writing.</p>
		<p>"It's B-i-c-k-"</p>
		<p>"I know how to spell it."</p>
		<p>"You know," Delores laughed nervously. "I always knew she'd find someone
			to take her in." Her eyes widened as the zeros were added to the amount box. Feeling
			victory within her grasp, she relaxed and rested her hip against the desk, much to
			Ronnie's annoyance. "Twenty thousand dollars. Humph. May not seem like much to you
			but I can get a new trailer for that."</p>
		<p>Ronnie stood up and tore the check out of the book. "And for the cost of a trailer
			you are willing to get out of Rose's life and leave her alone forever, right?"
			Delores reached for the check but she held it up in the air. "That's the deal. For
			twenty thousand dollars you stay away, never call or stop by. You'll forget that she
			exists."</p>
		<p>"Give me that check and I'll forget all about her," Delores promised, her
			forefinger and thumb grasping at the corner of the paper.</p>
		<p>"Don't you even want to say goodbye to her?" The executive held the check
			tightly, refusing to give it up without an answer. She did not expect the one she got.</p>
		<p>"Why? Is it worth more money if I do?" Delores looked at her expectantly.</p>
		<p>Ronnie forgot about the videotape in the shock of hearing the cold words. With an angry
			tug she jerked the check back and stood up, her six-foot frame towering over the shorter
			woman. "You bitch." Blue eyes blazed with fury. "You never cared about her
			at all, did you?" Her hands balled into fists, crumpling the check. "You took
			her in just for the check each month and to have a built-in babysitter!" Knuckles
			turned white under the pressure and the check suffered more damage.</p>
		<p>"The check?" Delores pointed out. "We have a deal."</p>
		<p>Ronnie lowered her head, the long black hair hiding her face. "The money. That's
			all you worry about, isn't it?" Her voice was quiet, low?the calm before the
			storm. "You used Rose for money. You used her as a child to get money from the State
			and when she was struggling to survive you took money from her." Jerking her head up,
			Ronnie locked eyes with the woman she hated. "Now she's lying there with two broken
			legs and instead of worrying about her you're trying to get money from me."</p>
		<p>"You want to get rid of me? Give me the check and I'm gone." The large woman
			held her hand out.</p>
		<p>"You want the check?" Ronnie flattened the rumpled check out, then held it
			out in front of her. She tore it neatly in two, then put the pieces together and tore it
			again. "I'm sure the State of New York paid you far more than you ever spent on
			Rose." Another tear. "There were weeks when she spent next to nothing on food
			for herself yet sent you a check because you managed to convince her that she owes you
			somehow." She threw the pile of confetti on the desk. Delores could only stand there
			and watch as her plan fell apart. "You have used Rose for the last time. Get out of
			my office before I have Security throw you out."</p>
		<p>"You can't?"</p>
		<p>"I can't what? Throw some lazy bum out of my own building?" Ronnie pressed
			her knuckles against the desk to keep from reaching across and striking the loathsome
			woman. The muscles in her forearms bunched and clenched in readiness. "You hurt Rose
			and I won't allow you to do it again. You don't deserve to know someone as kind and gentle
			as she is. Come within sight of my home and I'll have you arrested. One phone call, one
			letter, any attempt to contact her and I'll make your life a living hell."</p>
		<p>With all prospects of money gone, Delores had nothing left to lose. "You think
			you're so smart with all your fucking money. You don't know NOTHING!" She stormed
			over to the couch and snatched her cap and jacket. "You think Rose was the only
			foster kid I had?" The door opened and two beefy security officers entered, no doubt
			summoned by Laura after hearing the loud voices.</p>
		<p>"Is there a problem, Miss Cartwright?"</p>
		<p>"Escort this?" Bitch came to mind but a sense of decorum had to be
			maintained at the office. "?trespasser outside and make sure she never comes in
			again."</p>
		<p>"You keep your hands off me," Delores grabbed her bag and stormed out in
			front of the uniformed men. "You make sure Rose knows you're the one that made me
			stop talking to her. It's all your fault." The outer office door closed, leaving a
			confused Laura and a furious Ronnie standing there.</p>
		<p>"Laura, take the rest of the day off. I'm going home early." She shut the
			door and walked over to her desk. The bits of check were tossed into the trashcan and her
			prized pen was put back in her desk drawer.</p>
		<p>There was a quick knock before her door opened. "Ronnie?" Susan poked her
			head in. "What happened? I heard they called Security to your office."</p>
		<p>"Nothing important, just some business I had to take care of." She waved her
			hand dismissively. "Don't worry about it."</p>
		<p>"You know I'm going to find out anyway. You may as well tell me." The redhead
			entered and shut the door.</p>
		<p>"I am entitled to something of a private life." She sank into her chair, a
			bone deep sigh escaping her lips. "Let this one go, Sis."</p>
		<p>"Does it have to do with Rose?" The quick jerk of the head answered Susan's
			question. An awkward silence fell between them for several seconds before she spoke again.
			"Um?" The younger Cartwright looked down at her nails. "If
			um?well, I know you don't really have anyone close to you except Rose and well, I
			guess, me. If?if you need someone to talk to?well, I'm here." She
			straightened up and took a step back. "The boys keep asking when they can come over
			again." Clearing her throat, Susan continued, her gaze falling upon her older sister.
			"When I explained to John that Rose lives with you, he asked me if that made her his
			aunt too."</p>
		<p>"I told you?" Ronnie began only to be stopped by an upraised hand.</p>
		<p>"I know. I told him that she wasn't, but if it was okay with her, he could call
			her that."</p>
		<p>Looking down at her desk, the executive smiled, understanding the unspoken gesture
			behind the words. She stood up and although never very affectionate to her sibling, Ronnie
			reached over and wrapped her arm around her sister's shoulders. "How about tomorrow
			night? I'm sure Rose can't wait to have her wrestling guy trampled again." She
			released the casual embrace. "But how about right now I take us out to lunch?
			Somewhere nice, how about Maurice's or Giovanni's?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, that sounds nice, but how about trying that new Chinese place up on Western
			Avenue? I heard they have excellent food."</p>
		<p>A small icon on the screen caught the corner of Ronnie's eye. With a start she
			remembered the videotape. "Uh?yeah, that sounds good." She turned to the
			computer and shut off the camera. "Why don't you go get your coat and meet me down in
			the lobby? I have a couple of things here I need to finish up."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie took the video home and hid it in her bedroom, seeing no reason to show it to
			Rose right away. She knew the tape would hurt her precious friend and that was the last
			thing she wanted to do again. Instead that evening and the ones that followed were spent
			lying next to each other on the adjustable bed watching television or on the couch
			watching movies. Sometimes they would forgo the electronic entertainment and just spend
			the time braiding each others hair or doing their nails. It was a comfortable routine that
			she enjoyed tremendously. No mention was made about the continued sleeping arrangements
			and Ronnie was fine with that. If she had her way they would always sleep together. She
			loved the way Rose's body fit against hers. They never talked about the increased hugs and
			affectionate touches but Ronnie noted they were instigated by both equally.</p>
		<p>With Karen no longer needed, Rose filled her days working on projects for Ronnie. In
			addition to improving her skills, it also gave her an intense education in the way her
			friend's business was run. It gave them something else to talk about in the evenings other
			than themselves or what was on television. The late January thaw continued into February,
			promising an early spring. Already more grass was showing in the back yard than snow and
			the sun coming through the windows was enough to heat up the room without turning up the
			thermostat. Of course at night there was the added body heat of Ronnie to keep her warm.
			It was during those late night hours that Rose thought about her relationship with her
			dark-haired friend. With the exception of work, Ronnie was by her side constantly, not
			that Rose would ever complain. She relished the time they spent together. Often, while
			watching television, her head would rest against Ronnie's shoulder or even in the older
			woman's lap. She enjoyed those times the best. Ronnie would absently stroke her hair or
			let a warm hand rest upon her shoulder. They were much more relaxed around each other now.
			Initial embraces in bed were no longer stiff, hesitant affairs. Now, when it came time for
			sleep, Ronnie's arm would wrap around her waist and warm breath would tickle her neck as
			they molded their bodies together.</p>
		<p>Rose thought often about the growing affection between them. Hugs were a common
			occurrence and she encouraged them as much as Ronnie did. It seemed they could sense each
			other's needs, at least she was certain Ronnie could sense hers. When the pain in her legs
			flared up, the strong arms would comfort and console her. When a tear-jerker romance movie
			brought the need to be cuddled, there was no discussion or roundabout request, they just
			snuggled up against each other. But while she enjoyed the attention and affection, Rose
			wasn't sure she was ready for anything more or if Ronnie was even interested. There had
			been no kiss since they were under the mistletoe on Christmas and their conversations
			stayed far away from matters of the heart or sex. Whether it was deliberate on Ronnie's
			part or not, Rose was not sure. She only knew she was avoiding it, her feelings far too
			confusing to even think about giving them voice.</p>
		<p>Like right now. They were lying in bed watching Dateline and Ronnie's head was resting
			against her shoulder. Rose looked down at silky black hair mixing with her own. Her
			companion seemed so relaxed, so peaceful. Having her arm trapped between their bodies was
			no longer an acceptable position. "Lift your head up for a sec."</p>
		<p>"Hmm? Sorry, am I hurting you?" The lazy drawl told Rose just how relaxed the
			executive was.</p>
		<p>"Not at all. I just want to move my arm." She did so and quickly wrapped it
			around Ronnie's shoulder before the older woman could move away. "Now come back
			here." She tugged gently and was rewarded with her companion's head resting just
			above her right breast. "Comfy?"</p>
		<p>"Mmm, very."</p>
		<p>"Good." The commercial ended and Ronnie's attention went back to the
			television. Rose's did not. Her fingers began plucking at the long dark tresses. "You
			have very soft hair."</p>
		<p>"So you tell me. I think yours is softer, though. Mine's just thicker."</p>
		<p>Rose's fingers sank into Ronnie's hair and began massaging her scalp. "Hmm, you
			might be right about that," she conceded.
			<i>But I like touching yours more. </i>Slowly
			the small circles she was making with her fingers moved lower until they were stroking the
			smooth skin of Ronnie's neck. The television was completely forgotten by both women as the
			massage continued.
			<i>How far will you let me go? </i>A lone pinky ventured under the soft
			cotton shirt for a second then pulled back. Again. "Did Chris ever rub your neck like
			this?"
		</p>
		<p>Ronnie jerked upright, her eyes looking very much like those of a deer blinded by
			headlights. "Um, n-no?" She swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. "Why
			do you ask?"</p>
		<p>"I just wondered." Rose now hesitated, the question not seeming like such a
			good idea anymore. "It's just?well, you like it so much. I would hope someone
			did this for you before."</p>
		<p>"Chris and I?" Ronnie searched for the right words. "We
			weren't?" It was a tossup between which was drier, her lips or her throat.
			"We weren't physically close. There wasn't much cuddling." She sat up completely
			and shifted until she was facing Rose. "I thought it was true love then." A
			scornful laugh revealed the old pain. "Now I know better." She lowered her head
			and looked at her hands. Rose remained silent, sensing Ronnie struggling with some inner
			demon. Finally the tall woman chose the easy way out. "At least the sex was
			good."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Jokes aren't going to work with me. I know you too well, Veronica Cartwright. </i>"You
			know I hate Chris for hurting you like that." She reached out and put her fingers
			under the strong chin, forcing the blue eyes to meet hers. "And I don't hate many
			people in this world."
		</p>
		<p>Ronnie took the hand away from her chin and held it within her own. "Funny."
			She looked down at their hands, her thumb idly brushing across the smaller woman's
			knuckles. "I feel the same way about people that hurt you." She paused for a
			moment, fear threatening to keep the words trapped inside. "You are very special to
			me, Rose." Her head raised and for several long seconds they stared at each other.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh, my god, are you going to kiss me? </i>Rose wasn't sure if she was excited or
			afraid as her heart began beating double-time. Her lips parted slightly in subconscious
			invitation. She was just about to move forward when she saw the radiant blue eyes flicker
			and look away.
		</p>
		<p>"I think that's enough serious talk for tonight," Ronnie said, reluctantly
			releasing the hold on the young woman's hand. The magical spell was broken and both felt a
			keen sense of disappointment. Another lost opportunity?another chance not taken.</p>
		<p>Rose was still thinking about that moment long after they had settled down for the
			night. She turned her face to look at the sleeping woman beside her.
			<i>I wanted you to
				kiss me. Did you want it too? </i>Careful not to disturb her companion, she propped
			herself on her right elbow and tucked her hair behind her ear. Hesitantly she lowered her
			lips to Ronnie's cheek, planting the softest of kisses there. Her eyes adjusted to the
			dark, Rose saw as much as felt the small smile come to the sleeping face. "I love
			you," she whispered before lying back on her pillows. Intertwining her fingers with
			those resting on her belly, the young woman closed her eyes.
		</p>
		<p>"Love you too," Ronnie mumbled sleepily, unconsciously snuggling closer. The
			voice startled Rose for a minute before she realized her friend was still sleeping. She
			turned her cheek to rest against the dark head and soon fell asleep herself.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie opened the TV Guide and began to read off the options. "'A Walk in the
			Clouds' is on. We saw that one already. 'Sabrina', that's boring." She turned the
			page. "Let's see what's on pay per view." A gentle tug on her wrist forced her
			to shift the guide so Rose could look on with her.</p>
		<p>"There's that new Jim Carrey movie," the young woman offered.</p>
		<p>"I hate Jim Carrey. Look, Bruce Willis blows up another building."</p>
		<p>"I hate action movies. Let's watch a romantic one."</p>
		<p>"Why a romance and not a comedy?"</p>
		<p>"Well, it is Valentine's Day, silly."</p>
		<p>"If two people are really in love they don't need a day to celebrate it."</p>
		<p>"Veronica Cartwright, you are such a cynic. Give me that." Rose took the TV
			Guide and began thumbing through the pages. "You know we could play a game or
			something if you would rather. I see you're two levels higher than me on 'Rescuer of the
			Maiden'." She laughed at the sheepish grin on the older woman's face. "What do
			you do, play when I'm asleep?"</p>
		<p>"It's addictive. Come on, find something for us to watch."</p>
		<p>Fifteen minutes later the television still offered no suitable programs to watch.
			"There are what, a hundred, hundred and fifty channels on this and we can't find a
			thing to watch?"</p>
		<p>"That's because you don't want to watch any love stories and I don't want to watch
			any of those shoot-em-up blow-em-up movies," Rose replied.</p>
		<p>"So much for television." Ronnie pressed the off button and tossed the remote
			onto the coffee table. "This is a thrilling Valentine's Day."</p>
		<p>"If you're bored then let's do something different."</p>
		<p>"Like what?"</p>
		<p>"We could play a game or do each others nails or something." Rose was also at
			a loss for what to do. Although she had never believed it could happen, she was actually
			quite bored at the moment. In two months time they had managed to watch every movie Ronnie
			owned and played every game in the house several times. There really was not much else to
			do except? "Talk."</p>
		<p>"Hmm?"</p>
		<p>"Let's make some hot chocolate, sit back, and talk. You know, one of our infamous
			girl chats." Rose's eyes held a twinkle of mischief.</p>
		<p>"And what exactly would be the topic of conversation tonight? I am not doing
			'relive your most embarrassing moments' again."</p>
		<p>"Oh come on, you learned some pretty embarrassing things about me too," the
			young woman chided.</p>
		<p>"Well, that's true," Ronnie conceded. "And you do turn the cutest shade
			of red. Okay, I'm game but let's go out in the kitchen and make dinner while we're
			talking."</p>
		<p>Fifteen minutes later Rose was sitting at the kitchen table cutting onions while Ronnie
			was standing at the island slicing mushrooms. "Answer me something," the young
			woman queried while wiping at the endless stream of tears, "Why am I the one who
			always ends up cutting up the onion?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, I can't stand them, makes me cry," the older woman said cheekily.</p>
		<p>"You're lucky you're not within my reach, Miss Cartwright," she playfully
			warned. Ronnie poured the steaming hot chocolate into two mugs, then added
			mini-marshmallows. She brought one to the table and set it down within the young woman's
			reach.</p>
		<p>"I'm within your reach now, what are you going to do about it?" The
			intelligent executive realized her mistake a second later when small fingers slipped
			around her waist and began to tickle unmercifully. "Oh, hey now, heh heh, come on
			now, Rose, I was only joking." She backed away out of reach of the playful hands.
			"You just wait?" she said between breaths. "When you're out of this
			chair?I'll get even with you."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, you and what army?" Rose was beaming at her, obviously quite proud of
			herself. "It seems to me I only need my two hands to defeat you, oh mighty warrior of
			the corporate world."</p>
		<p>"That's because you know my weaknesses," Ronnie replied.
			<i>And I'm helpless
				when it comes to resisting you. </i>She walked behind the chair and put her hands on the
			smaller woman's shoulders. "And one weakness right now is that I'm starving. You want
			your steak broiled or sautéed?"
		</p>
		<p>"Surprise me."</p>
		<p>"Sautéed you said? Coming right up." She gave a gentle squeeze and went over
			to the refrigerator. "Oh, there are eclairs for dessert."</p>
		<p>"Sounds great. Maria always picks out the best food," Rose said. "You
			were practically drooling over the chicken last night."</p>
		<p>"Another one of my weaknesses," she said while retrieving the steaks and
			butter.</p>
		<p>"I'll have to tell your prospective suitors that the way to your heart is through
			your stomach."</p>
		<p>
			<i>And I would have to tell them my heart is already taken,</i> Ronnie thought to
			herself. "And what about you? What secret things should I know to tell your
			prospective suitors?" She watched as Rose's attention turned to anything but her.
			"What's that? I didn't understand you."
			<i>No one can understand that mumble.
				Come on, Rose, let me in.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Um?" Her fingers traced the delicate pattern of her doily. "I
			dunno," she finally answered with a shrug. "I guess I never really thought about
			what I would want in a lover."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Ah, now we're getting to something interesting. </i>"Okay, so think about it
			now. Let's start with the basics: tall, dark and handsome. Now what else?" She put
			the steaks on to cook, grabbed her mug, and headed for the table.
		</p>
		<p>"Well, I guess I'd want someone who was intelligent, thoughtful, had a sense of
			humor but was not a practical joker, no problems with gambling or drugs or anything like
			that."</p>
		<p>
			<i>So far I'm batting a thousand. </i>"Would be attentive to your needs and
			wants?"
		</p>
		<p>"But not at the expense of their own," Rose interjected.</p>
		<p>"Right," she agreed.
			<i>Their own? </i>Her eyebrow rose slightly. "Okay,
			what else?"
		</p>
		<p>"Hmm." The young woman tapped her finger on the tip of her chin. "Oh,
			well there's honesty and trust. I'd have to know they would never lie to me. There has to
			be that trust."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Whoops, no good on that one. Hey, they'd never lie? What's with the gender
				neutrality, Rose? </i>"Don't forget that he'd have to be able to fulfill your every
			desire."
		</p>
		<p>Rose seemed to mull a thought over in her head for a moment before speaking. "I
			don't know how our parents did it. Waiting until they were married to have sex."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Whoa, where'd that come from? </i>"Um, I hate to clue you my friend, but I
			don't think they waited. I mean, would you buy a car without first taking it for a test
			drive?"
		</p>
		<p>"Yeah, maybe that's why so many trade theirs in after a few years."</p>
		<p>"I think they're just looking for a newer model."</p>
		<p>"Maybe what they're really looking for isn't a car at all," Rose offered
			nervously.</p>
		<p>"Perhaps." Ronnie took a deep breath and plunged ahead into dangerous
			territory. "Not everyone is interested in cars."
			<i>Are you asking if I am?</i>
		</p>
		<p>"And that's fine," the young woman blurted quickly. "If someone would
			rather have a truck than a car, more power to them."</p>
		<p>"Whatever makes them happy, I guess."
			<i>You know I am and you're telling me
				it's okay, aren't you? </i>Another thought occurred to the dark-haired woman.
			<i>Or</i> a
			<i>re
				you trying to tell me that you are? </i>"There are even those that like both."
			<i>There,
				cover all the angles, just in case.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Some people aren't sure what they like." Rose looked up for a split-second
			then back down at the table. "Maybe they thought they liked cars but now they think
			they want a truck."</p>
		<p>Ronnie let out a deep breath.
			<i>Oh boy, how am I supposed to respond to that? </i>"Um,
			well?t-that's okay too. But I think they should take their time and not rush into
			anything because of what they think someone else might like." She noted the nervous
			fingers tapping the ceramic handle. "Especially if they're not sure."
			<i>Let's
				see if I've got this right. </i>"Maybe they've only driven cars and now they have a
			friend who likes trucks. They may think they want a truck too but they really don't."
		</p>
		<p>"So you're saying they shouldn't rush into anything, even if they really feel that
			they want a truck?" came the soft voice as green eyes raised up to meet Ronnie's.</p>
		<p>"Have they ever wanted a truck before?" As much as the metaphors were driving
			her nuts, the older woman did not want to do anything that might spook the obviously
			nervous Rose.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"I think the best thing is for the person to just spend some time riding around
			with their friend to see if they really like trucks."
			<i>That's it, just leave
				everything the way it is, nice and safe. </i>The smell of sizzling meat gave her the
			perfect excuse. "Damn, I forgot about the steaks." Ronnie hopped up and went to
			the island. "Good, they're still fine. Now you see why Maria doesn't like me
			cooking."
		</p>
		<p>"Oh, I thought it was because you used every pot and pan in the house."</p>
		<p>"I see you two talk about me when I'm not around." Ronnie smiled inwardly at
			the thought. "I hope it's good things."</p>
		<p>"Mostly good things," Rose teased. An uncomfortable silence followed, broken
			only by the sizzling of the steaks as each woman withdrew into her own thoughts. For
			Ronnie, the conversation revealed far more than she had hoped for. She looked over at
			Rose.
			<i>So you do feel something. I'm not imagining the increased touches and hugs. </i>With
			that thought however, came fear.
			<i>I don't believe you would ever use me like Christine
				did but I can't put everything on the line again. I can't take that chance. </i>At that
			moment Tabitha came bouncing out into the kitchen and Rose moved her chair to allow the
			cat to jump up on her lap.
			<i>Then of course, there's the minor detail of me being the one
				who hit you. I'm sure if that little piece of information got out you wouldn't even want
				to be my friend much less anything else. </i>Deep down Ronnie knew she was right to keep
			things the way they were, no matter what her heart said. She had hurt Rose enough.
		</p>
		<p>At the table, Rose was going through her own mental turmoil. She hugged the purring
			feline and blinked back emotions flowing too close to the surface.
			<i>So now you know I
				know. </i>She watched as Ronnie reached into the cupboard for the plates.
			<i>You know and
				you don't want me. </i>Rose wasn't sure if she should be relieved or disappointed. Her
			heart insisted on the latter.
		</p>
		<p>Ronnie put the two plates on the table. "You need anything more to drink before I
			sit down?"</p>
		<p>"No, this is fine, thank you." The young woman never looked up from her
			plate, yet she knew those stunning blue eyes were staring at her. "It smells
			wonderful." She picked up her knife and fork and went through the motions of cutting
			up her meat. Ronnie headed for the opposite side of the small round table, then stopped
			herself and sat down next to Rose.</p>
		<p>"There's more vegetables if you want them."</p>
		<p>"No, this is good." The young woman continued to push her meat around her
			plate.</p>
		<p>Ronnie could only sit by helplessly and watch as Rose withdrew into herself. She hated
			the tension hanging in the air but was not quite certain what to do or say to break it.
			"Um, if you have any questions about trucks, uh, maybe I can answer them for
			you."
			<i>Oh, that's brilliant,</i> she chastised herself. "I mean?"
			she stopped for a second when the blonde head lifted to meet her gaze. "I mean?I
			hate this awkwardness." They shared a small smile before Rose lowered her head again.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm not especially thrilled with it myself."</p>
		<p>"So talk."
			<i>Easier said than done.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"I don't know what to say," the young woman said in a quiet voice. Ronnie's
			heart ached for the pain she heard there. Without a thought she reached over and laid her
			hand on top of Rose's. The gently returned squeeze let her know the touch was welcome.</p>
		<p>"Just say what's on your mind."</p>
		<p>Several bites of steak disappeared before Rose spoke. "Have you had a lot of
			trucks?"</p>
		<p>"Um?" It was not the question Ronnie was expecting. "No, Christine
			was the only one."
			<i>There, I said her name. Let's get past this stupid car/truck
				thing.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Oh." Rose withdrew her hand and began to cut up more meat.</p>
		<p>"You can't look at me and talk about this, can you?"</p>
		<p>"No." A slow blush crept up her neck. "I never was any good talking
			about that kind of stuff."</p>
		<p>"More into action than words, eh?" Ronnie's joke did exactly what she hoped
			it would. Rose smiled at her and gave a playful swat.</p>
		<p>"Actually, when it comes to that, I'm not really very good in either
			category." She relaxed slightly, maintaining the eye contact for several seconds
			before looking down again. "I haven?t had the experience."</p>
		<p>"You mean?."
			<i>You're twenty-six years old. You can't be. </i>"B-but
			when you got caught in the driveway?" She watched the cute blush return to Rose's
			face.
		</p>
		<p>"We weren't doing 'that'. We were working our way up to it when we got
			caught." She pushed her plate away, giving up the pretense of eating. Ronnie did the
			same. "After that, well?it just never happened."</p>
		<p>Ronnie fought to keep the smirk off her face. "So you've um?never?"
			The smirk refused to be hidden and she had to look away. "?um, been taken for a
			test drive?"</p>
		<p>"Stop laughing." Rose feigned anger but the sparkle in her eyes gave her
			away. "No. No one's taken me for a test drive." She shot a devilish look at the
			dark-haired woman. "That's not to say that no one's looked under the hood."</p>
		<p>"We can't start this again." Ronnie drained her mug and stood up. "Since
			dinner obviously is over, let's go into the living room and relax on the couch."
			<i>I
				have a feeling this conversation is going to continue and I'd rather talk under the soft
				light instead of these harsh fluorescent tubes. </i>"I'll bring the eclairs."
		</p>
		<p>"Don't bother for me." Rose watched her friend reach into the refrigerator
			and remove a beer. "Can I have one of those?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie looked at her quizzically. "What about your Percocet? I thought you weren't
			supposed to drink with that."</p>
		<p>"I haven't had any today and I won't take any tonight." Rose was by no means
			a drinker but at that moment her mouth was so dry she was certain she could drain a six
			pack with no problem.</p>
		<p>"All right," the older woman replied hesitantly.
			<i>Maybe I shouldn't drink.
				I need my wits about me when I'm with you, Rose. </i>She plucked two glasses from the rack
			and followed her friend into the living room.
		</p>
		<p>She set the beers and glasses on the coffee table just as Rose was getting ready to
			transfer herself from the wheelchair to the couch. "Here, let me help."</p>
		<p>"I can do it."</p>
		<p>"It's easier if I help." She stepped forward and lowered her head. It had
			been too long since Rose let her help and she missed the feeling of holding the young
			woman in her arms. One arm slipped behind the back and she felt smaller arms wrapping
			around her neck.
			<i>Yes, that's right, hold me. </i>As she put her other arm under Rose's
			legs and lifted she nudged the wheelchair out of the way with her knee. Instead of putting
			her precious bundle down right away, Ronnie held Rose safely in her arms and gazed down at
			the face she loved.
			<i>If only things were different,</i> she thought as her eyes fell
			upon the soft pink lips so close to her own. In the back of her mind she knew that a kiss
			would not be protested. As fate sometimes found the need to be cruel, Rose had to shift,
			causing the hard plaster of her cast to rub against Ronnie's forearm. It was an instant
			reminder to the executive of all the reasons not to act on her feelings. She set her
			friend down quickly but gently, turning away before she changed her mind. She walked
			around to the other side of the couch and sat sideways on the far cushion. A quick twist
			of her wrist and the beer was open. Ronnie didn't bother with the glass, taking several
			deep swallows straight from the bottle. "Do you want some background music?"
			<i>Oh,
				that's bright. It's Valentine's Day. All the stations will be playing love songs.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Sure." To Rose, anything was better than the deafening silence. Ronnie
			fiddled with the different remotes until she found the right one. She adjusted the volume
			to a point where they could barely hear it, then set the remote on the table. She opened
			the other beer and poured it into a glass without comment, then passed it to Rose.
			"Thanks."</p>
		<p>"You're welcome." Ronnie settled back against the arm of the couch and took
			another tug on her beer. They looked at each other, silently hoping the other would begin.
			A song started and ended without a sound from either woman. "Well, this is
			productive," the executive finally said.</p>
		<p>"Maybe we should just drop it for tonight," Rose said.</p>
		<p>"No. We need to get this out in the open." She gave a deep sigh and reached
			for her beer. To her surprise it was already empty. "Wow. I haven't downed one like
			that in a long time."
			<i>Why am I so nervous? I know what I have to do. </i>"Rose,
			you mean a great deal to me, you know that." She forced herself to meet the young
			woman's gaze, hoping her words did not sound as fake to Rose as they did to her own ears.
			"But I made a decision long ago that the business comes first."
			<i>Even over my
				own heart. </i>"I can't go back on that."
		</p>
		<p>"Chris hurt you that badly?"</p>
		<p>"Yes she did." Ronnie had been looking down at her lap and picked her head up
			in surprise at the gentle touch on her outstretched ankle. "It's more complicated
			than that, but?"</p>
		<p>"Your truck is parked in the garage and it isn't going anywhere," Rose
			offered. Her words earning her a heart-warming smile.</p>
		<p>"Something like that. I need another beer. How about you?"</p>
		<p>"I'm doing fine with this one." She took another sip and watched Ronnie leave
			the room.</p>
		<p>Now alone, Rose felt the nervousness she was trying to hold in check burst forth. Her
			sips became swallows and her glass was nearly empty by the time Ronnie returned. She
			watched the tall, lean body fold up onto the cushion and look expectantly at her.
			<i>I
				guess it's my turn now, huh? </i>She took another swallow, the alcohol bolstering her
			courage. She looked up at gentle blue eyes. "I don't know what I want," she
			whispered. " I've never felt this way about anyone else, Ronnie." She looked
			away and finished her glass, her heart pounding painfully within her chest. Rose had no
			idea how they had started on this conversation but she knew they could not turn back from
			it now.
		</p>
		<p>"So where do we go from here?" Ronnie's voice wavered, betraying the strong
			emotions fighting inside her. "I don't want to lose what we have."
			<i>I don't
				want to lose you.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"I don't know." She looked longingly at her friend's beer. Ronnie smiled and
			handed it over. "Thanks." Rose took several sips from the bottle before
			returning it. "I guess things can just stay the same. I mean, we're still friends,
			right?"</p>
		<p>"Best friends," Ronnie corrected, passing the beer.</p>
		<p>"Best friends." The blonde woman smiled. "And best friends can sleep
			next to each other and it doesn't have to mean anything."</p>
		<p>"Right, and best friends can still hug."</p>
		<p>"Absolutely." Rose was encouraged by the direction of the conversation.
			"And sometimes?" The pink blush began to rise on her cheeks. "?if
			it's a special occasion?they might even kiss." Her ears burned bright red and
			she didn't dare look up. If she had she would have seen the arched eyebrow and smirk
			directed at her.</p>
		<p>"Yes, if there's a special occasion I see no reason why best friends can't
			kiss." Ronnie's mind went back to the blissful kiss under the mistletoe. She cursed
			herself for taking it down after the holidays.</p>
		<p>"I'll tell you a secret," Rose still could not look at her. "Earlier,
			when you picked me up? I um?I thought?I mean I hoped?.you would kiss
			me." She said the last words so low Ronnie almost missed them. She upended the beer
			and handed the empty bottle back. "Sorry, I didn't realize I was that thirsty."</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about it. There's plenty of beer. You want another one?"</p>
		<p>"No?yes. Please."</p>
		<p>Ronnie rose from the couch and knelt down next to Rose. With one hand she reached out
			and turned the young woman's face to her. "I'll be right back." Her thumb
			brushed against a far too soft lip. " I wanted to kiss you too." She stood up
			and pressed her lips to the crown of golden hair. "You want that eclair now?"</p>
		<p>With her fear dissipating, Rose found that her hunger had returned. She nodded and
			watched Ronnie leave the room.
			<i>You wanted to kiss me too? </i>She reached up and
			touched the spot where her friend's lips had touched her hair. When Ronnie returned, Rose
			rewarded her with a beaming smile and fingers trailing over each other as the bottle was
			exchanged. "Thank you."
		</p>
		<p>"You're welcome," she said while returning to her seat. She knew she was
			treading a dangerous line but she could not stop herself. "Happy Valentine's Day,
			Rose." She held her bottle out, noting that the young woman had poured hers into the
			glass.</p>
		<p>"Happy Valentine's Day to you too, Ronnie." The glass clinked together and
			they both took a healthy drink. "You remember in grade school when we used to give
			out valentines to everyone in class?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"Well, back then we'd ask our friends to be our valentines, right?"</p>
		<p>"Right, I remember that." Ronnie smiled. "Rose Grayson, are you asking
			me to be your valentine?" She received a shy smile in reply. "I'll be your
			valentine on one condition." She set the beer down and moved closer. "You have
			to be mine, too." She was kneeling on the cushion next to Rose, their faces less than
			a foot apart.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Mmm?" Her focus was solely on the young woman's lips.</p>
		<p>"Would Valentine's Day?be considered?a special occasion?" Caution
			deadened by the beer, Rose reached up and curled her left hand around the back of Ronnie's
			neck, the long dark strands sliding through her fingers. There was no answer, only a smile
			and the lowering of lips to hers.</p>
		<p>Ronnie's memory of the Christmas kiss paled in comparison to reality. The soft, gentle
			brushing of lips together made her hungry for more and she returned, nipping Rose's lower
			lip with her own several times before slipping her tongue out to taste the softness. She
			pulled back and received a soft whimper of protest.
			<i>Oh yes, I could easily lose myself
				in you, Rose Grayson. Very easily. </i>"Happy Valentine's Day." Ronnie moved
			back to a 'friendly' distance and retrieved her beer. To her immense pleasure, it was
			another second before green eyes fluttered open and focused.
		</p>
		<p>To Rose, all the stories about fireworks and bells going off were true. She felt
			absolutely dizzy and could not figure out if it was from Ronnie's kisses or the amount of
			alcohol she had consumed. The tingling sensation on her lips screamed its choice and her
			heart pounded in agreement. "H-happy Valentine's Day to you too." She looked
			over and saw the Cheshire-cat grin on Ronnie's face. "What?"</p>
		<p>"I've never had my kisses leave someone breathless before." She reached out
			and took the younger woman's hand in her own.
			<i>Look at the way you look at me. If you
				knew the truth? </i>Ronnie glanced at the clock, noting it was far too early to feign
			being tired. "You want to watch a movie?" Without waiting for an answer, she
			reached for the remotes. A second later the music had stopped, replaced by Chevy Chase
			bumbling through a Vacation movie. "There we go."
		</p>
		<p>Rose glanced at the television then back at the woman who had just kissed her
			senseless. Ronnie refused to look her way.
			<i>You're not fooling me. That movie just isn't
				that interesting. What are you afraid of? I would never hurt you like Chris did, I swear. </i>She
			understood that her friend needed some space and Rose was willing to give it. The evening
			had answered many questions. She now knew that her feelings were reciprocated, at least
			partially. The kiss had been the proof. Her fear of going further had been assuaged by
			Ronnie's declaration that she did not want to take their relationship to that stage, but
			right now Rose needed?something. "Ronnie? Can I lie down on your lap?"
		</p>
		<p>"I'd like that." They settled into the familiar position, Rose's head on her
			lap and her hand lightly stroking the golden hair beneath it. The touch carried with it a
			new meaning now, in light of the recent revelations. The gentleness was still there, but
			wrapped in a layer of love that moved from one to the other. Ronnie's fingers strayed to
			trace the outline of the small ear hidden by Rose's hair. The hand resting on her knee
			began to move as well, tracing lazy circles through the thick cotton of her sweats, making
			Ronnie wish she had worn shorts so she could feel those fingers moving across her skin.
			<i>Oh
				God, how am I going to do this? </i>She looked down at Rose.
			<i>If you only knew how much
				I want to make love to you right now. I don't know if I can do this, being so close to you
				and not being able to touch you the way I want to. </i>Her index finger traveled the
			jawline down to the pointed chin.
			<i>I love you so much, Rose.</i>
		</p>
		<p>At the end of the evening, it was time for another test. The house was locked up and
			the lights were all turned off for the night save the small lamp next to the bed. Rose was
			getting ready to get into bed when she felt Ronnie's strong arms wrap around her and lift
			her up. "I figured I'd help again."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh," she noted the tall woman made no effort to release her, not that
			she was complaining. "I suppose I owe you some sort of reward for helping me?" A
			smile tugged at the corner of Ronnie's mouth.</p>
		<p>"Well, you don't 'owe' me one but if you'd like to give me a reward, I certainly
			wouldn?t mind." She lowered them to the bed, her mouth scant inches away from
			Rose's. Both women were fully aware of the way their upper bodies were pressing together.</p>
		<p>"I don't mind." She smiled as their lips met, amazed at how perfect it felt.
			When Ronnie pulled back, she pushed forward, prolonging the contact for another second.
			Too soon for her comfort, the weight above her moved, replaced by the warm blanket.</p>
		<p>"Good night, Rose." Ronnie settled in next to her, the long arm wrapping
			around her waist as usual. She smiled in the darkness. As nerve-wracking as it was, the
			day had turned out far better than Rose had thought it would be. In their own way they
			spoke of their fears and feelings and now they were lying together like they did every
			night. Although she knew that some things had changed between them, there was so much more
			that had stayed the same. She brought her hand down to intertwine her fingers with the
			larger ones. "Night," Ronnie's sleepy voice murmured as she squeezed their
			fingers together.</p>
		<p>"Night."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>In the month that followed, both women adjusted to the new facet of their relationship
			and all it entailed. The revelation and acknowledgement of their feelings allowed them
			more freedom when it came to showing affection for each other. There was far more touching
			and both were quite creative when it came to defining the term 'affectionate friends'. For
			Ronnie, there was nothing more enjoyable than an evening spent exchanging soft touches and
			gentle kisses with Rose curled up in her arms. She continued to tell herself that she was
			not breaking her promise to her father since she and her golden haired goddess were not
			lovers, Yet with every look, every touch, Ronnie knew that she was lying to herself. She
			was bewitched by the young woman with the gentle smile and soft laugh and there was
			nothing that could change that.</p>
		<p>"Penny."</p>
		<p>"Hmm?" She looked down to see smiling green eyes looking up at her. They were
			in her favorite position sitting on the couch with Rose curled up in her lap. It had been
			almost a week and a half since the right cast was removed and the left one shortened down
			to just below the knee. The weight difference was a blessing on Ronnie's thighs and the
			softness of her companion's body was also quite welcome.</p>
		<p>"A penny for your thoughts. You seemed to go away there, for awhile."</p>
		<p>Ronnie brought her hand up to cup the younger woman's cheek. "Nothing, just
			thinking."</p>
		<p>"About? Or should I guess?"</p>
		<p>"You," she said simply, drawing a beaming smile from Rose. "I care about
			you very much. You?" Her thumb traced over the razor-thin scar on her
			companion's cheek, a grim reminder of the hidden truth. "I am so glad you stayed with
			me. I'm very lucky."</p>
		<p>Rose smiled and nuzzled her cheek against the large hand. "I'm the one who is
			lucky." Locking blue eyes with her own, she continued. "I'll never understand
			why you took me in, a complete stranger, and did everything you could to help me."
			She snuggled closer, resting her head on Ronnie's chest. "but I'll always be grateful
			to you for that. And this." She waved her hand to indicate their intimate position.
			"You don't push me or make me feel uncomfortable."</p>
		<p>"Never," the dark-haired woman said vehemently. "I never want to do
			anything to make you feel that way."</p>
		<p>"And you wouldn't. I know that." Rose's face turned serious and she sat back
			slightly. "I bet you wish I'd hurry up and make up my mind about whether I liked
			trucks or not." It was a thought that played itself constantly in the back of her
			mind, especially after some rather heated kissing exchanges.</p>
		<p>"Hey," Ronnie whispered, "That's something only you can decide."
			<i>Screw
				the euphemisms. </i>"I know we don't talk about it much but?" She
			hesitated, not at all certain she wanted to broach the subject with the object of her
			desires sitting on her lap. "It's more than just caring about another woman."
			She held up a finger to silence Rose's protest. "Put your feelings about me aside for
			a minute. Think about what it means to be a?lesbian." After so many years of
			being shamed for who she was, Ronnie found it hard to actually speak the word out loud.
		</p>
		<p>"It is more accepted these days," Rose said softly.</p>
		<p>"Not in my world." She said the words more harshly than she had intended,
			bitterness coloring her tone. In a lower voice she added, "Not in my family."
			Her mind flashed back to that fateful day in her father's study when she was forced to
			accept her lifelong punishment. Looking down at her beloved, Ronnie decided that if that
			were the only thing holding her back, she would walk away for a chance to be with her
			Rose. The thin white scar and the remaining plaster turned the deadbolt on that door.</p>
		<p>"Nothing has to change," the gentle voice said quietly. "We're both
			happy and no one is being hurt." Ronnie felt soft arms wrap around her and squeeze
			gently. She happily returned the embrace. "Come on," Rose said. "Your
			sister is going to be here soon and I'm sure you don't want her to see us like this."
			She tried to move off but found herself held in place by Ronnie's strong hands.</p>
		<p>"I don't want to let you go." The words held far more meaning than just that
			moment and Rose knew it. She leaned forward and kissed the dark-haired woman.</p>
		<p>"I am not going anywhere." Their lips brushed together again and fear was
			lost in the face of love. As it always liked to do, the grandfather clock chimed the hour
			and broke the moment. With Ronnie's help Rose stood up on her right leg and slipped the
			crutches under her arms. "Where did you put the markers? You know the boys are going
			to want to decorate the new cast."</p>
		<p>"I think they're in a drawer out in the kitchen. Speaking of which, we should
			probably make some cookies for the boys."</p>
		<p>"And for the girls?" Rose leaned her armpit against the top of the crutch and
			used her free hand to pat Ronnie's belly.</p>
		<p>"Well," the executive ducked her head and gave a sheepish grin. "I think
			there's another roll of chocolate chip ones in the fridge." They started toward the
			kitchen.</p>
		<p>"Don't count on it unless Maria bought groceries yesterday," Rose said. They
			entered the kitchen just as Susan's minivan pulled into the driveway.</p>
		<p>Ronnie opened the sliding glass door and waved them in. "Outta my way, me
			first," twelve-year old Ricky said as he stormed past with the PlayStation in hand.
			Ten-year old Timmy and six-year old John quickly followed both making the same amount of
			pre-teen boy noise. Rose quickly backed herself up against the island to avoid being run
			over by the trio. "No running in my house," Ronnie called out uselessly.</p>
		<p>"I don't know about them. They never listen," Susan said as she stepped
			inside, followed by Jack. She spotted Rose and smiled. "Rose dear, Ronnie said you
			were up on crutches." She walked over and held her hand out. The young woman balanced
			herself on her right foot and returned the gesture. "So you're doing better?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, everything is going well according to Doctor Barnes. Just waiting for my
			ankle to heal fully."</p>
		<p>"Well good, I'm glad you are doing better. You shouldn't stand up for so long
			though." She shot her older sister a look and pulled out a chair. "You just sit
			down right there. If you want anything, I'm sure Ronnie will get it for you." Rose
			started to protest but decided it was easier to give in. To her surprise, Susan sat down
			in the adjoining chair. "Jack, go see what the boys are up to. I don't want to
			replace any of Sis' things." Once he left the room, the redhead motioned at the empty
			chair. "Come sit down, I don't want the boys to overhear this." Rose and Ronnie
			exchanged confused looks as the dark-haired woman sat down.</p>
		<p>"What's going on? Everything all right with you and Jack?"</p>
		<p>"Of course everything's fine with us. We've been happily married for thirteen
			years," Susan replied.</p>
		<p>"So what's the problem?" Ronnie decided it was best not to mention the
			affairs she knew about, including the current one.</p>
		<p>"You know that diamond broach that Daddy gave Mother on their twenty-fifth
			anniversary?" The oldest Cartwright nodded. Her father had spent an extravagant
			amount, even for a family as rich as they were. It was one of Beatrice's most prized
			possessions. Susan looked down at the lace tablecloth. "It's gone."</p>
		<p>"Gone? What do you mean gone?" Ronnie's eyes were wide with disbelief.
			"She keeps it in her safe when she's not wearing it, doesn't she?"</p>
		<p>"She said she put it in there. Only four people know the combination. Mother, you,
			me?" The sisters looked at each other, then slowly nodded in agreement.</p>
		<p>"Tommy." Ronnie's hands bunched into fists. Rose had never heard a name said
			with so much loathing, as if it were a curse. Without thinking, she reached over and
			placed her hand over the larger one. She realized her mistake immediately when she felt
			the flinch and withdrew. They exchanged looks before Ronnie spoke again. "When did
			she discover this?"</p>
		<p>"Yesterday. You won't like this," Susan began. "She said she had gone to
			her friend's house for bridge Tuesday night and when she got back she noticed the picture
			frame was not flush against the wall but she didn't think anything of it."</p>
		<p>"Is the safe behind the picture?" Rose asked.</p>
		<p>"When was the last time Tommy was there?" Ronnie asked, nodding at the same
			time to reply to her beloved's question.</p>
		<p>"Saturday night." The redhead sighed. "I think he took it and I told
			Mother that too."</p>
		<p>"You told her?" The eldest Cartwright did not bother hiding her surprise.
			"You told her that her precious Tommy might have stolen from her? What did she
			say?"</p>
		<p>"Just what you would think she'd say," Susan replied. "She accused me of
			teaming up with you against him. She said that we didn't understand how difficult things
			were for him. But I think she believes me." She turned to Rose. "Our mother
			doesn't always see things as clearly as she should."</p>
		<p>"That's one way to look at it," Ronnie said, secretly pleased that her sister
			had invited Rose in on what was obviously a family discussion. "More accurately, she
			sees only what she wants to see and anything that disturbs her vision is wrong." She
			sighed and scratched her head in frustration. "Nothing we can do about what she
			thinks. What about the broach?"</p>
		<p>"We'll pay on the claim, of course. That's not the problem."</p>
		<p>"No, the problem is a boy who thinks that drugs make him a man. Why didn't you
			call me about this?"</p>
		<p>"I only found out about it yesterday and I didn't want to disturb your
			weekend." She looked at Rose pointedly. "Besides, I knew I'd see you
			today."</p>
		<p>Ronnie ignored her sister's blatant implication. "So what are we going to do about
			him? Now he's stealing from his own mother."</p>
		<p>"I had the locksmith come by and change the combination on her safe. Cartwright
			Insurance will pay the claim. There really isn't anything else we can do."</p>
		<p>"Is that all he took, just her broach?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," Susan nodded. "All the other jewelry was still there. But only we
			would know that the broach was the most expensive piece in there. She's got that necklace
			that looks like it's worth more than it is and it was untouched."</p>
		<p>"Tommy knows what everything is worth. Mother only takes it out on special
			occasions. He probably figured she wouldn't notice right away." Ronnie looked over at
			Rose, silently wishing they were alone. A deep anger welled within her and only the young
			woman's embrace could ease it.
			<i>The hell with it, you already think we're lovers. </i>She
			took a deep breath, reached out, and wrapped her hand around Rose's smaller one. Susan
			gave what was clearly an uncomfortable smile.
			<i>You started it. </i>Ronnie squeezed her
			friend's hand once, then withdrew. She glanced sideways to see Rose's surprised and
			questioning look. She smiled and hoped the blonde woman would understand.
			<i>Sometimes I
				just need to touch you.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"So?um?let's talk about other things." Susan said. "Did you
			get the recipe from Maria for the stuffed chicken?"</p>
		<p>"I did, but I'm not in the mood to fuss around with that tonight. You'll have to
			come over during the week and have her make it."</p>
		<p>"Do you mean that one with the broccoli and that sauce?" Rose asked.
			"That's delicious. Maria said you always liked that."</p>
		<p>"Well, Ronnie liked it too." The young woman's disarming smile caused Susan
			to return one in kind. "Maria makes absolutely the best stuffing."</p>
		<p>"Yes she does," the eldest Cartwright agreed. Rose smiled to herself
			remembering the red box that said 'Stove Top' sitting on the counter one evening. She
			decided to keep the housekeeper's secret. Besides, she had tried making Stove Top before,
			when she lived alone, and it never turned out as well as Maria's. </p>
		<p>With the subject off the physical gesture and on to a more familiar topic, Susan
			visibly relaxed. "That's why Ronnie got to keep Maria. She cooks so well, if she
			worked for me I'd be as big as a house."</p>
		<p>"Sometimes I feel that way too," Rose said, patting her stomach. Just then
			John came scampering out into the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"Mommy, I want some soda."</p>
		<p>"You need to say please and you have to ask your Aunt Ronnie," his mother
			said. He looked over at his tall aunt and repeated his question properly.</p>
		<p>"Of course."</p>
		<p>"Aunt Rose, can I sit on your lap?" Startled eyes met his innocent question.
			"Please?" he added, thinking that was the problem.</p>
		<p>"Um well?"</p>
		<p>"If Aunt Rose wants to let you sit on her lap, that's up to her," Susan said.
			She looked at Ronnie and nodded.</p>
		<p>"Sure, if you want to, that's fine." Rose pushed her chair back a bit to give
			him some room. He quickly climbed up and pulled her arm around his middle to keep from
			sliding off. "Are your brothers letting you play with them?" she asked in his
			ear.</p>
		<p>"No, they're no fun to play with," John pouted.</p>
		<p>"Jack's no better," Susan said. "I swear the instant that controller
			gets in his hand his age drops thirty years." The sounds of boys arguing drew their
			attention. "I'd better go see what they're up to before one of them kills the
			other." She stood up and held her hand out to her youngest son. "Come on,
			John."</p>
		<p>"We'll be there in a minute," Ronnie said, standing close to Rose's chair.
			Once they were alone, she leaned down for a kiss. "I think Susan's warming up to
			you."</p>
		<p>"I don't know. When you touched me, she looked like she swallowed a bug."</p>
		<p>"But even after that she let John sit on your lap and call you Aunt Rose."</p>
		<p>"Mmm, that's true." She allowed Ronnie one more kiss before reaching for her
			crutches. "Did you call for the pizzas yet?"</p>
		<p>"Damn, I knew I forgot something. What did everyone want?"</p>
		<p>"Two large mushroom, two supreme, and you wanted your pepperoni and
			mushroom," Rose said. Susan's shrill voice came from the living room. Apparently
			there was a battle of wills going on between her and her twelve-year-old son, Ricky.</p>
		<p>Ronnie shook her head. "I had better get out there Can you call it in for me? It's
			three on the speed dial."</p>
		<p>"Sure." Rose picked up the phone and pressed the button while Ronnie went to
			prevent World War Three. She got through on the first try and placed the order. She hung
			up and had just positioned her crutches under her arms when the phone rang. Thinking it
			was the pizza place calling back, Rose picked it up. "Hello?"</p>
		<p>"R-Ronnie?" She did not recognize the voice but she certainly understood the
			tone. The woman on the other end of the phone was crying.</p>
		<p>"No, this is Rose."</p>
		<p>"Would you please tell Ronnie that her mother is on the phone? I-it's very
			important," Beatrice sniffed.</p>
		<p>"Hold on just a second." Realizing she couldn't hold the phone in one hand
			and use her crutches, Rose set it down on the counter and worked her way into the living
			room.</p>
