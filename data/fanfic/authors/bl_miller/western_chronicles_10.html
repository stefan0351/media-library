<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 10: The Wrong Place At The Wrong Time -->

<p>After a breakfast of salt pork and coffee they set out Southwest,
		away from their pasts and toward an uncertain future. Josie rode upon Phoenix while
		Rebecca walked alongside leading the little mare and telling tales of life on the plains.
		The outlaw listened half-heartedly, her senses trained to listen and look for signs of
		trouble. Her intuition had never failed her before and the sudden prickling of the hairs
		on her neck made her pull the horse to a stop and motion for the prairie girl to be
		silent. Her ice blue eyes scanned the horizon, catching the almost imperceptible sight of
		a rifle barrel poking out from behind a rock. Josie extracted her Winchester from its
		scabbard and dismounted in one fluid motion.</p>

		<p>"Behind that rock. Now!" she ordered, keeping her rifle
		focused on the sniper. Rebecca had just made it behind the rock when a single shot rang
		out. She kept her head down out of fear.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" she called again, this time louder.</p>

		<p>"I'm here. Stay where you are," she hollered back. She
		looked down at her injured leg. The bullet had entered at mid thigh and there was no sign
		of an exit wound. Using her elbow and her uninjured leg Josie scrabbled around the rock
		and collapsed at Rebecca's side.</p>

		<p>"You're hurt!" The young woman exclaimed. Without
		warning, Josie twisted and brought the rifle up, aiming slightly above the head of the
		distant gunman, causing the small pile of rocks above him to shake violently. The hammer
		clicked on an empty chamber, and Josie ducked back down behind the rock, pulling shells
		out of her gunbelt as she did. </p>

		<p>"We have to get out of here," Rebecca said </p>

		<p>"If we move now, we'll be dead before we can reach
		Phoenix." She looked down at the blood that had soaked her pant leg and begun to pool
		on the ground. "But you're right, we can't stay here much longer." She opened
		the chamber of the rifle and filled it with bullets. A flip of the lever and the rifle was
		ready to go. Josie spared a quick look at her new friend. "If anything happens, I
		want you to take the horses and get out of here."</p>

		<p>"Josie, nothin-"</p>

		<p>"If anything does, take the horses and go." The tone in
		her voice made it clear that this was not open for discussion. Rebecca nodded mutely. The
		outlaw gave her one last look before pivoting and firing at the potential rockslide. Her
		left index finger worked the trigger as her right hand pulled the lever again and again.
		The quick succession of bullets freed the rocks, sending them tumbling. The man let out a
		bloodcurdling scream as the granite rained down on him, and then all was silence. </p>

		<p>"Get the gauze from the saddlebag," Josie said to the
		girl, and Rebecca ran to do her bidding. The outlaw untied the bandanna around her neck,
		and when Rebecca returned she handed it to her. "Tie this around my leg above the
		wound. It'll slow the flow of blood." Rebecca did as she asked, but the sight of so
		much blood made her feel queasy. "Now put the gauze over the wound..." she broke
		off at the look on Rebecca's face. It looked as if the girl was about to faint. </p>

		<p>"Josie, we have to get you to a doctor!" Rebecca said
		frantically as she tried to help the outlaw to her feet. Using the smaller woman for
		leverage, she climbed on top of the boulder that moments before had been their hiding
		place, and whistled for Phoenix. The mare trotted to her side, and using her powerful
		arms, Josie pulled herself into the saddle. </p>

		<p>"Climb up on that rock and then get up behind me,"
		Josie said to Rebecca, whose face was still unnaturally white. Rebecca did as she was
		told, and a moment later was settled behind the wounded gunslinger. "Hold tight to my
		waist. If it seems like I'm about to pass out, give me a good squeeze so I don't fall out
		of the saddle."</p>

		<p>"But I'm not strong enough to keep you..."</p>

		<p>"Don't worry; you won't have to keep me up here. I'm just
		afraid I might forget where I am or let go, and you can keep me focussed." Rebecca
		tightened her grip so much she thought her arms would fall off from the pressure, but it
		was enough to keep the gunslinger fairly upright in the saddle.</p>

		<p>They rode the rest of the day and night stopping only long enough
		to give the horses a much-needed drink and a few minutes of rest. They arrived just before
		daybreak at a small ranch. Smoke already curled from the chimney so Josie didn't need to
		rouse the house. Sure enough, before they had even come to a stop, a small woman with dark
		hair came out of the house holding a rather menacing rifle. The scowl on her face
		dissolved into a huge grin when she recognized her visitor. "Josie!" she boomed.</p>

		<p>"Hello, Belle. It's been a long time," the outlaw said
		as she nudged Phoenix to a stop just beyond the porch rail. Without waiting for an
		introduction, Rebecca slid off the horse as if she had been doing it all her life and said
		to the woman with the rifle, "She's wounded. Help me get her down from there."
		In her excitement at seeing her old friend Belle had not even noticed the pallor of her
		cheeks, or that Josie's left pant leg was completely soaked with blood as was Phoenix's
		left flank. Rebecca's words galvanized her into action, and she jumped off the porch and
		ran to Josie's side.</p>

		<p>"Put your arms around my neck," she instructed the
		gunslinger. "And you, blondie, carefully lift her leg over the saddle, and then take
		hold of both her legs." Josie leaned down as instructed and wrapped her arms around
		the stout woman's neck. Rebecca was almost afraid to touch Josie's wounded leg, but she
		did not want to rile the feisty Belle so she did as she was told. In a few moments they
		had Josie on the ground between them, her arms draped over their shoulders. They hobbled
		into the house and with a nod Belle said, "Bring her to that room over there."</p>

		<p>Unwilling to let go of the injured woman to grasp the doorknob,
		Belle simply gave the door a kick. It opened to reveal a plain bedroom with a bureau, a
		wash basin, and a pitcher. The two women maneuvered Josie to the side of the bed and laid
		her down as gently as they could. Josie's teeth were clenched against the pain, and tears
		welled up in her eyes as Belle worked the boot off her foot. Belle glanced up at the young
		blonde who stood frozen at the head of the bed. "There's whiskey in a jug in the
		kitchen. Fetch that and a glass." With a nod, Rebecca made her way across the room.
		Before she was out of earshot, Belle added, "Oh, and some cloth. Enough to clean her
		up and to use for a bandage. It's in a chest in the kitchen. And when you're through with
		that, draw some water from the well and put it on to boil." She took a pair of
		scissors from a sewing box on top of the bureau and proceeded to cut the ruined trousers
		off the wounded gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Those are my best drawers," Josie complained.</p>

		<p>Belle guffawed. "Not any more, they ain't." Rebecca
		came into the room with her arms full of white cloth, a whiskey jug and glass in her
		hands. She was just in time to see Belle peel back the fabric she had cut from around the
		wound, which had begun to bleed afresh.</p>

		<p>"Oh!" Rebecca gasped and turned away from the sight of
		the blood. When she and Josie were on the way to Belle's she was able to deal with the
		gore because she had to, but now that someone else was there to take care of her friend,
		Rebecca seemed to lose her nerve. Her face paled, and she thought for a moment she would
		be sick. "I can't...I don't think...I'm sorry, I think I'm going to be sick."</p>

		<p>"Well then take it out of here, girl," Belle said, a
		bit more gruffly than she had intended. "Just leave the things, and go do something
		useful." She poured a healthy dollop of whiskey in the glass and handed it to Josie,
		who swigged half of it in one gulp.</p>

		<p>"Take care of the horses," Josie said to Rebecca's
		retreating back. "And don't worry; this old harridan will take good care of me."</p>

		<p>"I know. But I wish I could help..." She hazarded a
		glance at Josie, making sure to look only at her face and not at the bloody mess of her
		leg. Josie gave her a wan smile and tipped her glass toward the little blonde before
		finishing off her whiskey. </p>

		<p>"Bring me that water when it's hot and leave it outside the
		door," Belle asked. </p>

		<p>By the time Rebecca finished brushing down and settling the
		horses, Belle had managed to dig out the bullet and dress the wound. She dressed Josie in
		a long shirt, and the outlaw was finally resting comfortably. Before attempting to remove
		the slug, Belle had given her enough liquor to ensure that she would rest for quite a
		while. She came out of the bedroom to find the young blonde in the kitchen feeding wood to
		the stove.</p>

		<p>"Fire was dying," she said by way of explanation. She
		should not have presumed it was all right to work in someone else's kitchen without asking
		first, but she could not bring herself to go back into the room Josie occupied. </p>

		<p>Belle simply nodded. "What's your name, child?" she
		asked as she closed the door to Josie's room.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca. Is she going to be okay?" Her intense concern
		and fear were evident on her young face. The older woman placed a strong hand on her
		shoulder.</p>

		<p>"She'll be fine in a few weeks. She lost quite a bit of
		blood and the muscles need some time to heal. Come on; let's rustle up something for you
		to eat. Then you can tell me what happened."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, I never caught your name."</p>

		<p>The older woman smiled warmly. "Belle," she said as she
		held out her hand. "Belle Shirley." Her firm grip surprised Rebecca. The woman
		appeared to be the same general age as Josie, but significantly shorter. "This is my
		home."</p>

		<p>She showed Rebecca around the small but neat ranch house. There
		were three rooms, all made up for sleeping. One was obviously Belle's; the other two
		appeared to have no occupants. There was nothing of a personal nature in either room. It
		was one of those rooms that now housed the injured outlaw. A small eating area doubled as
		the main room. "Excuse me for asking, but if you live here alone, why so many
		sleeping rooms?"</p>

		<p>Belle let out a deep belly laugh that shook her whole body.
		"It's not because I enjoy company, girl. Many persons who have...shall we say...run
		afoul of the law have found a need to hide out here for a while." She looked over at
		the door to Josie's room. "Many have come here for the same reason as her. We can't
		always trust a local doctor to tend to our wounds properly, especially once he finds out
		that we're wanted. Many of them would just as soon poison us as heal us. We've had to
		learn how to take care of our own injuries."</p>

		<p>"And you keep this place so they have a place to go."</p>

		<p>"Yes. So far the law hasn't found us out." She went
		into the small kitchen and heated up some stewed beef in an enameled tin pot. "Only a
		few of us know this place. Josie must really trust you to bring you along here." She
		looked at the young woman again, appraising her from head to toe. "What do you do for
		her, girl? You don't look like a gunfighter and you're too innocent to be something
		else."</p>

		<p>"Well, we've only been traveling together a few days. So far
		I haven't done anything for her except get her into trouble." </p>

		<p>Belle smiled warmly and put her arm around the younger woman.
		"It's been many a year since this place has had any laughter. Tell me a funny story
		while I make us some fresh buttermilk biscuits to go with this stew."</p>

		<p>"Mmm!" she licked her lips unconsciously. "For
		fresh biscuits I'll tell you every story I know." She sat down on a high stool and
		proceeded to rattle off several fanciful tales of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys,
		Paul Revere, and other heroes of the Revolutionary War. Belle listened intently, learning
		more than she ever knew about that period of American history. Rebecca's voice was
		animated, every word full of emotion. Her hands moved in tune with her mouth, illustrating
		different points within her stories.</p>

		<p>"You tell your stories very well, child," Belle said as
		she served up a bowl of stew for each of them.</p>

		<p>"Oh, if you don't mind, I'd like to feed Josie first, then
		eat."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, she's not going to know if you eat first."</p>

		<p>"But I'll know," she said quietly. Belle looked at her
		inquisitively for a moment before turning back to the pot and ladling out another bowl of
		stew.</p>
