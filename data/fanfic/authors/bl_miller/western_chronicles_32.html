<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 32: Just Desserts -->

<p>Typical of most mornings in the saloon, the women were all
		gathered around the tables, enjoying breakfast and each other's company before the patrons
		arrived. Rebecca sat with Victoria at a small table near the stairs, drinking coffee and
		listening to the brown headed woman talk about her new room and the differences between
		this whorehouse and the one she left behind in Rosewood. Josie sat with Sandy, quietly
		drinking coffee and catching up with her old friend. A tall thin man walked in, his
		walking stick tapping on the floor in cadence to his steps. The room suddenly quieted and
		Sandy exchanged a worried look with Josie before rising to meet him halfway.</p>

		<p>"Miss Sandy," he said none too politely as he surveyed
		the room, taking in the sight of the new women. He stroked his handlebar mustache
		thoughtfully.</p>

		<p>"Look, Sam, I've done already paid you for this week."
		She tried to sound forceful, but her genuine fear prevailed. Sam smiled wickedly.</p>

		<p>"Ah, but you didn't pay me enough. Why, I see you have some
		new ones. I do believe that makes the price higher, don't you?" He reached forward
		and pulled a small roll of bills out from between the madam's ample breasts. The sound of
		a chair scraping against the floor was heard as Josie rose to her feet quickly, her right
		hand hovering just over her shooting irons. Sam shoved the whore out of his way and stood
		directly in front of the woman in black. "You don't look like the type to be
		spreading your legs, so you best just get back to your own business," he spoke
		threateningly, yet his eyes remained fixed on Josie's weapons. The gunslinger desperately
		wanted to introduce her fist to his teeth but the madam stepped between them.</p>

		<p>"Look, there's no need for this kind of talk," Sandy
		said, trying to diffuse the situation. "You got what you came for, so git out and
		leave us alone."</p>

		<p>Sam looked around, paying close attention to the women's faces,
		noting which ones were scared of him and which weren't. "Nice merchandise, Miss
		Sandy. Perhaps I might just have me a sample or two, hmm?" he said lecherously, his
		mind filling with thoughts of one of the women lying helpless beneath him. A thin sneer
		formed on his lips. "I'll be back," he said before turning and leaving, the
		tapping of his walking stick echoing off into the distance. Josie waited until the sound
		was completely gone before sitting back down. Sandy joined her and sat quietly for a
		moment, letting the tension ease a bit before speaking. The other women resumed their
		conversations, although several still cast nervous glances at the doorway. Sandy motioned
		for the bartender and within seconds a full bottle of whiskey and two glasses were placed
		on her table. She filled them both before speaking.</p>

		<p>"He's Sam Hutchins. Owns the bank, the brewery, just about
		anything in town that has a profit to it," she said solemnly, wishing that the cactus
		juice could take away her feeling of dread.</p>

		<p>"What's his business with you?" Josie asked as she
		looked around the room again, making brief eye contact with Rebecca and smiling before
		turning her attention back to the blonde madam.</p>

		<p>"He holds the note to the saloon."</p>

		<p>"So he thinks that he owns everything..." Josie lowered
		her voice in disgust. "...and everyone in it."</p>

		<p>"That'd be about right," Sandy replied, reaching down
		to pick up Bobo. "We pay the mortgage but he still demands more, a part of the profit
		each week."</p>

		<p>"Is he dangerous?"</p>

		<p>"No, just greedier than a prospector. Thinks he's entitled
		to whatever he wants."</p>

		<p>Josie finished her drink and looked at her friend. "Do you
		want my help?" The blonde madam immediately stiffened and shook her head.</p>

		<p>"No, Josie. There's no need. I can handle him," she
		said firmly. She would live to regret those words.</p>

		<p>It was late afternoon when the men came pouring in from their day
		of labor. Everyone was known by name and greeted with hearty handshakes and smiles when
		they entered. Josie had long ago traded her cactus juice for ale, drinking slowly to keep
		her senses alert. There had been no sign of Hutchins since he left five hours ago, but the
		gunslinger still felt uneasy and insisted on staying. Rebecca passed the time chatting
		with Victoria until the customers started coming in. Josie decided that her young friend
		didn't need to see her friends working and took her back to the boarding house. In the
		hour after they left, the saloon became so busy that no one noticed Sam Hutchins enter and
		go up the stairs.</p>

		<p>He hid in a small vestibule and watched a door open and two
		people exit. The man tipped his hat and headed down the stairs. The brown-headed woman
		leaned over the railing and caught the attention of Sandy, indicating with her gestures
		that she was taking a break. The blonde madam nodded and went back to her duties. The
		young woman returned to her room. Locking the door behind her, she sat down in front of
		her small dresser and began to brush her hair, not paying attention to the image in the
		mirror until it was too late. Sam lunged forward, wrapping one arm around her throat and
		pulling her from the chair. With all the sounds of lust and passion coming from the rooms,
		no one heard the small yelp before she was gagged.</p>

		<p>Sandy knocked on the door. "Victoria?" When there was
		no answer she knocked again. "Victoria, unlock the door."</p>

		<p>"What's going on?" Elaine asked as she came out of her
		room. Her last customer of the night had left a short time ago and she was getting ready
		for bed when she heard the blonde woman's poundings on the door across the hall.</p>

		<p>"Victoria must have fallen asleep or something. The door's
		locked and no one's seen her in a few hours," she said as she reached in her pocket
		for the set of skeleton keys she kept there. Elaine became concerned and pounded hard on
		the door, shaking it on the hinges and drawing the other women from their rooms. They were
		asking each other if they knew what was going on as they all crowded around Victoria's
		door. Sandy turned the key and opened the door. Elaine rushed over to the bed, pulling the
		battered woman into her arms and removing the gag from her mouth. The curtain flapped
		against the frame of the open window.</p>

		<p>"I'll get the doc," Stacey said, heading for the
		stairs. Sandy ran out of the room and caught the redhead at the landing.</p>

		<p>"Doc Brooks met Saint Peter last week. Cheating at cards, I
		think. He never cared none for doctoring us anyway," the blonde woman said. Elaine
		came out of the room and shut the door behind her. Everyone quieted down and looked at
		her, waiting for news.</p>

		<p>"She says it's the man with the curly mustache."</p>

		<p>"Sam!" Sandy said in disgust. She turned to the
		redhead. "Get Josie."</p>

		<p>Josie reached over and took the large book out from under the
		blonde's nose and closed it. She'd been watching Rebecca reading the same paragraph for
		the better part of an hour. "I think it's time to visit the sandman, sprite. Let's
		go," she put her hand around the smaller woman's upper arm and helped her stand up.
		Rebecca stretched and groaned as her body moved for the first time in hours.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I think...(yawn)...you're right." She had been
		reading about the skeletal structure of the human body and found it too fascinating to put
		down, even when her eyes had trouble staying focused. She looked at the inviting pillow
		and aimed for it with her tired body only to be stopped by the gunslinger's strong arms.</p>

		<p>"Hold your horses there. You're not going to sleep in your
		boots. My shins wouldn't survive the way you toss about," Josie said as she turned
		Rebecca around and sat her down on the edge of the bed. She debated about helping the
		young woman when the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps made the decision for her. The
		gunslinger moved to the side of the door and readied her Colt, holding it up in position
		to press against the head of the intruder. She unlocked the door and turned the handle
		slowly.</p>

		<p>Stacey reached out to pound on the door when it suddenly flew
		open before her and she was roughly pulled inside and looking down the barrel of Josie's
		gun. A split second later the gun was withdrawn and back in its holster. "What's
		wrong?" the gunslinger barked while ushering her back out the door. The look on the
		redhead's face told her without a doubt that something had happened at the saloon.</p>

		<p>"Victoria's hurt. That damn banker came back and...."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, grab the saddlebag!" Josie interrupted. The
		young woman did as ordered and within seconds they were heading down the stairs, Rebecca
		now very wide awake.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca almost cried out when she saw the battered face of her
		friend.</p>

		<p>Victoria's right eye was swollen shut, a crimson line of blood
		trailed from her nose. Her disheveled brown hair only added to the appearance of being run
		over by a wagon train. The blonde was relieved and a bit confused to see Victoria still
		clothed. She looked at Elaine expectantly. The black headed woman shook her head, causing
		Rebecca to let out a sigh of relief. Josie was about to reach for the saddlebag when the
		young blonde moved to the edge of the bed and set it down beside her, opening the flap and
		rummaging through it looking for the strips of cloth they used for bandages. Without
		saying a word, the gunslinger motioned for everyone else to move away from the bed. Sandy
		followed that up with gestures for the women to leave the room. Only Josie, Sandy, and
		Stacey remained behind to watch the young woman care for her friend.</p>

		<p>Her hands trembled slightly from nervousness as she wet the strip
		of cloth. As delicately as she could, Rebecca gently wiped the blood that had run from
		Victoria's nose down to her chin. "You're gonna be just fine," she said softly.
		The brown-headed woman nodded and let a dry, cracked sound come from her lips.
		"Shh...don't try to talk," her soothing tone and gentle touch calmed the
		battered woman. Rebecca reached over and poured some water from the pitcher into a tin
		cup. Using her left arm to support Victoria's head, she lifted her up and placed the cup
		to her lips. It was then that Rebecca noticed the split lip, previously hidden by the
		bloody nose. "Stitches," she said quietly. Rebecca swallowed nervously as she
		realized that all the hours of sewing practice were about to be tested for the first time
		on a person. She forced her hands not to tremble as she reached into the side pouch and
		pulled out the needle and thread kept for that purpose. She narrowed her concentration,
		blocking out the other women in the room and focusing on the task at hand. Belle's voice
		echoed in her head, reminding her to make small, neat stitches. She took Victoria's hand
		and pressed it against the cloth on her lip. "Hold this."</p>

		<p>With ease born of practice, Rebecca threaded the needle, making a
		small knot in the end of the thread. She placed her hand reassuringly on the prostitute's
		shoulder. "Everything will be fine, Victoria, but your lip is cut pretty bad."
		She held up the needle and thread so the battered woman could see them. The young woman
		waited until her friend nodded in understanding. "This may hurt," Rebecca said
		apologetically as she pulled the cloth away and studied the uneven gash. In her mind's
		eye, she saw exactly where each stitch had to go to properly seal up the wound. Still, the
		idea of actually putting the needle and thread through a person's skin caused her stomach
		to churn. She closed her eyes for a moment and waited for the queasy feeling to pass.
		After a moment she opened them, the cloud of doubt and hesitation now gone. Victoria lay
		very still as she watched her friend bring the needle slowly to her lip. Although she
		trusted Rebecca, she still flinched and turned her head when she felt the pressure of the
		point against her skin. The young woman stopped and pulled back a bit, placing the cloth
		back over the bleeding wound. The direct approach was not going to work. "Victoria,
		do you know the story about Jim Bowie and the Alamo?" she asked, leaning over and
		dabbing at the wound with the cloth in one hand while bringing the needle closer. The
		brown-headed woman shook her head slightly. "Well, lucky for you I do." Rebecca
		spoke in a tone that made the upcoming story sound interesting. She began her tale,
		continuing to press down with the cloth as if cleaning the area. She had Victoria's
		complete attention on her story when she finally pushed the point of the needle through
		the broken skin.</p>

		<p>The battered woman didn't realize what she had done until she saw
		Rebecca's hand come up, drawing the thread tight. The touch was so gentle, the tones
		filling her ears so soft that she had no choice but to fall under the spell her friend was
		weaving. Victoria felt very little discomfort as the needle was passed through again and
		the thread drawn tight with small, gentle tugs. Rebecca smiled at her. "There, that
		wasn't so bad, now was it?" she said, continuing to press against the cut with the
		bloody cloth, maintaining activity in the area. "Now, where was I? Oh yes, he met up
		with Daniel Boone...."</p>

		<p>Josie watched with rapt fascination as Rebecca continued to
		stitch up the wound. When she had first closed her eyes, the gunslinger had taken a step
		forward, prepared to take over. But when the green eyes opened with a flash of confidence,
		Josie decided to stay where she was and watch what happened. She didn't move when Victoria
		flinched, and was quite impressed by the way Rebecca handled it. The gunslinger realized
		that her friend had a special talent, not just for healing with her hands, but for
		soothing with her voice. Josie noted that Victoria no longer had the fearful look in her
		eyes, but was calmly looking at her friend as she finished suturing the wound. Rebecca
		continued to tell her story while she looked for more signs of injury. Gone was the look
		of hesitation and nervousness, replaced by a new-found confidence in her abilities. The
		bounty hunter understood that a great change had happened to her friend. Rebecca was no
		longer the frightened young caterpillar she had rescued such a short time ago. The woman
		she looked at now was undergoing the transformation and Josie knew that it was only a
		matter of time before a beautiful butterfly emerged to cast her gentle glow over all she
		touched.</p>

		<p>Rebecca listened carefully as Victoria whispered to her the
		places that hurt. Even that little bit of talking hurt her. The inside of her mouth was
		cut up from his fist punching her cheek against her teeth time and time again, not to
		mention the puffy and split lip. There was little more that Rebecca could do for her
		friend. Most of the remaining injuries were bruises, her face, neck, and upper arms taking
		the brunt of it. Victoria touched her fingertips to her swollen lip, wincing at the pain.
		"Guess he done got me good...ow." "Yeah...he did," Rebecca said
		softly, her green eyes misting up.</p>

		<p>"Shh...twer..." she motioned for the water and took a
		sip, mindful of her lip, before continuing. "...'twernt the first time I got
		beat." Victoria looked away from her friend unable to face the look of innocence, the
		innocence she lost so long ago. "Prob'ly won't be the last." Her voice was
		tinged with the anger she felt welling up inside her. Rebecca placed a gentle hand on her
		forearm.</p>

		<p>"Victoria, it doesn't have to be that way. You can leave
		this all behind you. Make a new start. We'll help you, if you let us. Everyone deserves a
		second chance." She spoke in her most convincing tone of voice, yet the brown headed
		woman maintained the defeated look on her face.</p>

		<p>"Whores don't usually git second chances."</p>

		<p>"No?" Rebecca reached over, opened the pouch, and
		pulled out the small bible she had found when she first started following Josie around.
		She opened it to the New Testament and flipped through until she found the page she was
		looking for. She took a sip of water and began to read, "Now the scribes and the
		Pharisees brought a woman caught at adultery, and, after standing her in their midst, they
		said to him 'Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery. In the
		Law of Moses prescribed for us to stone such sort of women. What, really, do you
		say?'" She looked up from the book to catch Victoria's eyes with her own. "And
		do you know what he said? He said 'Let he who is without sin be the first to cast a stone
		at her.' Victoria, no one threw a stone because no one is above sin. We all make mistakes,
		and we all deserve a second chance."</p>

		<p>Josie motioned for the others to follow her out of the room,
		confident that her young friend had things well in hand and in fact was probably doing a
		better job than she would have been able to do. For just a moment she caught the green
		eyes with her own. The depth of compassion and caring that Josie saw there was too much
		for her. Suddenly uncomfortable, the gunslinger simply followed the others out, closing
		the door behind her. She had no doubt that this would be a very long night for both of
		them. "Sandy, put coffee on," she called out to the blonde woman at the bottom
		of the stairs.</p>

		<p>A short time later, the three women were sitting about one of the
		small round tables. Not wanting to draw attention to the saloon at such a late hour, they
		chose to light only one small lamp, setting it on a nearby table. Josie picked up her cup
		of coffee and leaned back in her chair, resting her booted foot on the table in a most
		unladylike manner. "Why does he do that?"</p>

		<p>Sandy looked down at the half empty cup of coffee. "It's how
		he gets it done. Can't do it no other way," she let a small smirk cross her face.
		"You know how he needs that there stick o' his to walk with? Well..." she leaned
		forward as she shared the secret. "Damn fool was twirling his gun around and shot
		himself. Ain't got hardly nothing left now." They all had a good laugh at his expense
		before she continued. "But he still feels, I guess. 'Tain't the first time this
		happened. Beat three girls so bad they can't work no more, and another...well, she ain't
		right in the head no more. He up and punched her stupid."</p>

		<p>"So what do we do now?" Stacey asked.</p>

		<p>"Nothin' we can do," Sandy replied. "I do what I
		can to keep him away from the girls, but sometimes he still gets through. You know the law
		ain't gonna touch him just on our say so. We're good enough to go round the mountain with
		but not good enough to believe over that no good excuse for a man," she said
		bitterly. "I just hope somebody puts him in a wooden overcoat soon."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps sooner than you think," Josie said softly,
		putting her finger on her lips. Soon they also heard the unmistakable sound of Sam's
		walking stick tapping the ground as he approached. Stacey reached over and pulled the gun
		from Josie's left holster. The gunslinger had no time to react as the creak of rusty
		hinges announced his arrival. She quickly pulled her right gun out and readied it for
		action. The redhead would have hell to pay later, the gunslinger thought to herself.</p>

		<p>"Ladies, why are you sitting in the dark? Surely you won't
		attract customers that way," he said smugly as he moved over to the bar and lit
		another lamp, turning the wick up to cast a dark orange light. Sandy rose, followed
		quickly by Stacey, and walked crossed the floor to meet him halfway. Josie remained in her
		seat with her gun aimed directly at him from under the table. She knew without looking
		exactly where her weapon was pointing. With his attention directed at the approaching
		woman, it was easy for her to reach over and turn the wick down on the lamp near her,
		leaving it still burning, but too low to cast light on her.</p>

		<p>"Get out of here!" Sandy hissed. The redhead stood
		behind her, the revolver sandwiched between their bodies. "You may not have nothin'
		else but you sure got balls coming back here after what you done."</p>

		<p>"Done?" he said, feigning innocence. "I haven't
		been here since earlier today. I was in my office all evening." Hutchins stroked the
		curl of his mustache. "Of course no one saw me," he said with a sly grin.</p>

		<p>"You bastard!" Sandy lunged at him, her anger at all
		the women hurt at his hands flooding through her. Her sudden movement put her between the
		banker and Josie, blocking any shot she may have had. The gunslinger leapt to her feet,
		ready to join the fray and protect her friends.</p>

		<p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Sam swung his cane,
		striking Sandy just below the left temple. As the women fell, he raised his arm for
		another blow. Both Josie and Stacey leveled their weapons. It was the redhead that fired
		first, striking him in the center of his forehead. The force kicked his head back, causing
		the gunslinger's bullet to fly harmlessly into the wood behind the bar. His eyes rolled up
		into his head as a thin stream of blood poured down the front of his face and he pitched
		backward. His lifeless body landed across the blonde madam's legs. Stacey's hand started
		shaking violently with the realization of what happened. Josie reached her quickly and
		wrenched the gun out of her hands, putting it back in its holster. She pulled out a chair
		and forced the redhead to sit down before she fell down.</p>

		<p>The gunshot brought all the women out of their rooms. Rebecca
		flew down the stairs, her focus solely on Josie and not on the possible danger. The
		gunslinger rolled Hutchins off Sandy and helped her to her feet just as the young woman
		reached the bottom of the stairs. The other women looked down from the upstairs railing.
		Josie's eyes narrowed as she stormed over and grabbed the young woman by the upper arm,
		pulling her over to a far corner before releasing her. Unmindful of the gunslinger's
		anger, Rebecca wrapped her arms around the taller woman and hugged her tightly. "When
		I heard..." she inhaled sharply and shook her head against Josie's chest, unable to
		voice her fears.</p>

		<p>The bounty hunter looked down at her, understanding the mixture
		of emotions running through Rebecca. The anger she had with her for running headlong into
		an unknown danger dissipated as she tentatively wrapped her arms around the young woman's
		shoulders, resting her chin on the top of the blonde head. "We'll talk later,"
		she said gently. Rebecca nodded, knowing that she made a mistake and that most likely the
		gunslinger was angry with her about it. A soft smile came to her lips. Although angry,
		Josie still allowed her this comforting embrace. She gave one more squeeze before stepping
		back.</p>

		<p>The women looked expectantly at Josie. If anyone knew how to hide
		a killing, it was the tall gunslinger. She walked over to Sandy. "Want him
		found?" she said seriously, her mind already working on where to deposit the body for
		the buzzards to pick clean.</p>

		<p>"I think that's best. If he don't show back up, they'll be
		looking for him," the blonde madam replied, much to the gunslinger's dismay. It would
		have been much easier to make him disappear.</p>

		<p>"And if anyone saw him here...." Josie left the thought
		unfinished as she looked around the room. Her eyes gazed upon the large chandelier full of
		dangling diamond shaped pieces of lead glass. She turned to Rebecca. "I want you to
		take Stacey upstairs, okay? Tell everyone to meet us in Victoria's room."</p>

		<p>"What are you...?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, go," Josie asked more than said.</p>

		<p>"Uh...yeah," she said, understanding the unspoken
		message in the blue eyes. The gunslinger didn't want her to see what she was going to do.
		"I'll wait for you upstairs." She turned and went to get Stacey, leaving the
		gunslinger to her task.</p>

		<p>Josie waited until everyone was out of sight except for Sandy,
		who was keeping an eye out for any signs of life on the street. Apparently no one heard
		the gunshot, as there were no signs of activity. The blonde could only hope that no one
		would be wakened by the next sound to come from the saloon. Josie walked to the corner and
		looked at the rope. One end was tied to a rung in the wall. The other ran up through a
		pulley to the top of the chandelier. She smiled. This was the part she loved; the
		execution of a brilliant plan. Pulling off the impossible. That's what made her such a
		good train robber; what kept her alive. The ability to think quickly on her feet was a
		skill she hoped never failed her, or Rebecca. After a quick glance upstairs, Josie focused
		her attention on the knot holding the rope to the anchor on the wall.</p>

		<p>The women from Rosewood were gathered in Victoria's room, the
		others waiting in the hall outside the doorway due to the lack of space. Rebecca sat on
		the bed next to the upright Victoria, quietly explaining what she knew. Elaine and the
		others were comforting Stacey, who was in a complete state of shock over taking a human
		life. The sound of the large chandelier crashing to the floor caused all of them to jump.
		Bobo, who had been sleeping quietly under the dresser, tore off like shot across the room
		and dived under the bed. Josie came bounding up the stairs, her long legs avoiding every
		other step. Everyone poured out into the hallway to hear what happened. Josie waited until
		she saw</p>

		<p>Rebecca come out of the room, the battered Victoria in tow.
		"Get the saddlebag," she said, and watched as the blonde disappeared back into
		the room to return with their gear. The gunslinger turned her attention to the whores, all
		looking at her for an explanation.</p>

		<p>"Sandy has gone for the sheriff," the gunslinger raised
		her voice slightly to make sure everyone heard her. "Act confused. You have no idea
		why he was here or what he was doing. You don't know anything and hadn't seen him since
		early afternoon." Her words were met with a chorus of nods. "All you heard was a
		loud crash downstairs. That's all." Her tone warned them that the previous sound of a
		gun was not to be mentioned. Josie reached for Rebecca's arm. "We need to
		go...now."</p>

		<p>Josie didn't say a word as they walked back to the boarding house
		and her body language made it clear that Rebecca wasn't to speak either. They took the
		route through the alleyways, carefully avoiding the main street and the possibility of
		being seen. Once inside the privacy of their room, the gunslinger sat down on the edge of
		the bed and motioned for Rebecca to sit next to her. In the darkness, all they could see
		of each other were dim silhouettes. Josie sat quietly, waiting for the inevitable
		questions.</p>

		<p>"Why did you do that? Drop the chandelier on him, I mean.
		Won't they see the bullet hole?" she asked, not entirely sure she wanted to hear the
		answer.</p>

		<p>"With all the cuts, looking for a small hole like that would
		be like looking for a needle in a haystack," Josie said assuredly, although she
		secretly worried that someone might have heard the gunshot. It would only take one person
		commenting on a previous sound before the crashing glass to cause a closer look to be
		taken at the dead body.</p>

		<p>"What did Sandy tell the sheriff?"</p>

		<p>"That Hutchins insisted on lighting the chandelier and when
		she went to lower it, the rope slipped out of her hands. A tragic accident."</p>

		<p>"Do you think the sheriff will believe her?" Rebecca
		asked.</p>

		<p>Josie pondered the question for a brief moment.</p>

		<p>"If Sandy put her mind to it, she could convince an assayer
		to buy fools gold. She's a fast thinker, that one. Nope, unless he sees something wrong,
		the sheriff will buy her story."</p>

		<p>"Good," the young woman said as she let out a sigh of
		relief. An awkward silence fell between them.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...." she said, trying to break the deafening
		silence.</p>

		<p>"You did a good job taking care of Victoria." Josie
		turned and pulled one leg up on the bed so she could face the young woman. "From what
		I saw, her lip will heal up just fine."</p>

		<p>"I tried to concentrate on what Belle taught me about
		stitching," she said modestly, but in the darkness of the night, she was beaming ear
		to ear from the compliment.</p>

		<p>"No, you did more than that. You comforted her while you
		tended to her. That's a special talent, Rebecca. Not everyone can do both." Josie
		took a deep breath and paused for a moment. The blonde swallowed, understanding that the
		topic was about to change and knowing what was coming. "When you heard the gunshot,
		your first instinct should have been to get to safety, not to run headlong into
		danger." As she spoke, Josie was careful not to let her fear for Rebecca's safety
		express itself as anger in her voice. "Next time, act; don't react," she said as
		she reached out and placed a hand on the young woman's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Josie...I didn't mean to scare you." The sudden
		tension in the hand on her shoulder told Rebecca that she had accurately guessed the
		gunslinger's feelings. She patted her hand gently. "I worry about you, you know. I
		care."</p>

		<p>"You still have to be careful; not take chances," Josie
		said firmly, not thinking about the words until after they had left her mouth.</p>

		<p>"Said the desert to the grain of sand," she shot back.
		"I worry about you because you give me reason to worry, Josie. One of these days
		someone is going to call you out and...." Rebecca stopped when she realized her
		mistake. The gunslinger's shoulders slumped and she let her hand fall to rest on the young
		woman's knee.</p>

		<p>"You're still upset about yesterday." It was a
		statement, but also a question. Rebecca nodded.</p>

		<p>"Hey," she said, smiling in the darkness and putting
		her hand on top of the gunslingers. "I'll make a deal with you. I won't take
		unnecessary chances if you won't."</p>

		<p>"It's a deal," Josie said as she tried to stifle a
		yawn. "Now let's get some sleep." She rose and quickly stripped down to her
		drawers. Rebecca took longer to get down to her slip. They curled up together as they had
		the previous night, the gunslinger's arm wrapped protectively around the young woman's
		waist, their bodies so close that only one pillow was needed. A couple of minor
		adjustments and both settled into a comfortable position. Lying in the warm embrace, the
		outside world melted away for Rebecca. The vision of her friend beaten, the stress of
		putting the needle through skin, all the actions of the day slipped from her mind. There
		was no dead man, no danger, only the safety that came from the strong arms wrapped around
