<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 40: Moving On -->

<p>Josie was wakened by the sunlight streaming through the window.
		Rebecca?s head was on Josie?s shoulder, her arm was tossed over her chest and
		her leg draped over her thigh, just like most mornings of late. The thing that made this
		morning different was that they were both naked. Josie cupped her hand around the soft
		globe of Rebecca?s behind and pulled her even closer. Her skin tingled where
		Rebecca?s naked flesh pressed against her own, and she shuddered involuntarily as she
		remembered the passion they had shared the previous night. She softly kissed the top of
		Rebecca?s head, marveling at the depth of feeling the little blonde awakened in her.
		She might have lain there longer but she heard the sounds of activity in the house and
		wanted to make sure she caught the brothers before they were out and about. The roof was
		finished and before she and Rebecca could move on they would need some help to get the
		axle put on their wagon.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca. Wake up, sprite. We need to get moving," she
		whispered, and received a mumbled response from the sleeping woman. " Hey,
		sleepyhead. Rise and shine," she said a bit louder, and was rewarded by a glimpse of
		sleepy green eyes.</p>

		<p>"I?m up, I?m up," Rebecca said sourly,
		nuzzling her face into Josie?s soft breast.</p>

		<p>"Uh uh, none of that or we?ll never get out of
		bed," Josie said as she reluctantly pulled herself away from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Five minutes," Rebecca pleaded, clinging to the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, baby. I hate to get up too, but we really do need to
		move on. Don?t make it any harder on me?please." Josie extricated herself
		from Rebecca and slid off the edge of the bed before the blonde could grab hold of her
		again. She rummaged through her clothes and began pulling them on as Rebecca watched
		avidly.</p>

		<p>"I sure hate to see you cover up all that beautiful
		skin," Rebecca said with a sigh.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "Only one night and you?re a sex maniac
		already," she said jokingly.</p>

		<p>"You don?t want me to be? A sex maniac, I mean? Because
		it?s your fault if I am, you know. I was an innocent little girl when I met
		you."</p>

		<p>"I want you to be exactly what you are. If that means
		you?re a sex maniac, then I am truly blessed. You?re my beautiful, sexy sprite,
		and if you don?t get out of that bed and put some clothes on, I am going
		to?" she paused and let Rebecca anticipate her words, and then surprised her
		with, "tickle you."</p>

		<p>"No. Not that, please." Josie had tickled her once or
		twice in their time together, and she knew it made Rebecca laugh until she would cry.
		Rebecca threw the covers off and vaulted out of bed. Now it was Josie who admired the form
		before her, but not for long. "Brrr, it?s cold in here," Rebecca
		complained, and she pulled her clothes on so fast her dress was wrong side out and she had
		to take it off and put it on again.</p>

		<p>"C?mere, you. I?ll warm you up," Josie said
		with a grin. Not needing to hear it twice, Rebecca scooted across the room and into
		Josie?s arms. The outlaw rubbed briskly up and down the smaller woman?s back
		several times before pulling her into a bear hug. "Ready to face those old men?"
		She asked playfully.</p>

		<p>"If you won?t come back to bed with me, I might as
		well," Rebecca pouted.</p>

		<p>"Hold that thought until we get out on the prairie where
		nobody will be around to hear you scream when you come," Josie said huskily as she
		nibbled Rebecca?s neck.</p>

		<p>"Josie?you?re terrible! You make me get out of bed
		and then you tease me with?" She broke off as she realized what Josie had said.
		"Scream? Did I scream? I didn?t?realize."</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, you screamed all right. Just hearing it was enough
		to make me come with you." Rebecca?s cheeks flushed, and she lowered her eyes in
		embarrassment. She wished she were half as worldly as the woman whom she loved so she
		didn?t find herself behaving like a school girl all the time. Ah well, all in good
		time, she told herself. She also found herself hoping that the old men had been playing
		their music nice and loud when she screamed. "Come on," Josie said dragging her
		out of her reverie, "they?ll be sending out a posse for us pretty soon."
		She took Rebecca?s hand and kissed it, and then led her out of the bedroom.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie pushed back from the table and groaned. She had eaten more
		in the past couple of days since Horace had been cooking than she had in the two weeks
		before that. Rebecca?s cooking was far and away better than her own, but not near as
		good as Horace?s. She would miss the old men and the quiet peaceful life out on the
		farm. Watching as Rebecca washed up the dishes from supper, she pictured her in a kitchen
		of their own on a nice little farm somewhere out west. With Rebecca by her side this was a
		life style she could easily grow accustomed to. But with a price on her head, she feared
		she would always be on the move. Now more than ever she did not want to find herself
		staring down the barrel of some sheriff?s gun. She had Rebecca to take care of, and
		there was no way to do that if she were in jail, or worse. Her reputation as a fast gun
		could also earn her a bullet in the back from a cowardly bounty hunter more interested in
		the reward than concerned with whether he took her out in a fair fight. She shook her head
		to dispel such gloomy thoughts and stood up.</p>

		<p>"Well boys I hate to leave such fine company, but we need to
		be moving on. I promised Rebecca I?d take her to learn from the medicine elders and
		I?d like to get there before the weather turns much colder." Rebecca draped the
		towel over the edge of the dishpan and came to stand beside her lover. She would also miss
		the idyllic life they had been leading, but she knew that as long as she and Josie were
		together it didn?t matter where they were, they would be home.</p>

		<p>"We?re gonna miss you gals," Charles said
		sincerely. "Havin? you here was like?well, almost like havin? Ruth and
		Lillian around. Made me want to take a bath on a Saturday night and get spruced up, and I
		ain?t done that for a lotta years."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Charles, we?re going to miss you too. Both of
		you." She gave first Charles and then Horace a big hug, and then turned and went to
		the bedroom to get their gear so the old men wouldn?t see the tears in her eyes. She
		couldn?t help but think that if her own father had been half the man these gentle
		brothers were, she never would have left home. Never would have followed Josie and learned
		the true depth of love. As miserable as her youth may have been, she would not change a
		day of it if it meant she would not have met Josie. When she returned to the kitchen,
		Josie was shaking hands with Charles and promising that they would stop by again if ever
		they were anywhere close. She turned to see Rebecca coming toward her with their bags.</p>

		<p>"Got everything?" She asked in a gravelly voice that
		almost betrayed her emotions.</p>

		<p>"Yes." Josie took some of the bags from Rebecca and
		started for the door, determined not to cry. She and Horace had hauled the axle up to
		where her wagon had broken down and fixed it early that morning, and she had packed up all
		but their clothes and harnessed the horse right before supper. Now there was nothing to do
		but to get on the road. Josie stowed her bag beneath the canvas tarp after removing her
		gunbelt and strapping it on. She had not worn a gun for almost two weeks, and the weight
		of it almost felt foreign to her. Rebecca came out side with the two brothers on her heels
		and Josie could hear her making the same promise to visit that she had made. She also knew
		that both of them would very much like to keep that promise.</p>

		<p>Josie climbed into the seat and held out her hand to the little
		blonde. Rebecca placed her hand in Josie?s and allowed herself to be drawn into the
		wagon. With a slap of the reins on Flossy?s flanks and a sharp "gee up" the
		women pulled away.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The wagon moved slowly across the trail, the light clip-clop of
		Flossy's hooves against the hardened earth creating a hypnotic rhythm that threatened to
		put Rebecca to sleep. Josie looked over at her lover, shaded from the sun by her soft
		beige hat, the edges dog-eared from age and wear. She watched the way the soft blonde hair
		cascaded out from under the hat to flow gracefully across her shoulders, the warm wind
		sending several strands whipping in the air. Her gaze fell on the soft earlobe, the soft
		sensitive earlobe, she corrected herself. There was a moment the night before when the
		gunslinger swore she was going to send Rebecca over the mountain just by suckling that
		soft piece of flesh. Gone were the road, the fields, and the sky. All that was focused in
		Josie's eyes was the vision of her sprite. Her ears filled with the memories of their
		lovemaking, the moans, the sighs, the whimpers, and the gunslinger's favorite sound, the
		soft cry that Rebecca made just before her world exploded. It was a sound Josie knew she
		would never tire of and would always long to hear. Her visual inspection moved to
		Rebecca?s lips. Those oh so soft lips that begged to be kissed. Those lips that
		parted ever so slightly when Rebecca was sailing under her touch. Those lips that sought
		to return the pleasure as often as possible. Those lips that covered her warm, inviting
		mouth. There was a place Josie never wished to leave, or have leave her. In a short time,
		Rebecca had mastered the art of lovemaking with her mouth. She'd used her lips, tongue,
		and teeth in perfect harmony with each other to bring the gunslinger to a quivering mass
		of bones and flesh.</p>

		<p>The wagon hit a small bump and Rebecca shifted position slightly,
		leaning back against the seat and drawing her hat down over her eyes to keep the sun off.
		Her arms were folded across her body below her breasts, which now had the gunslinger's
		complete attention. Josie licked her lips subconsciously as she undressed the blonde with
		her eyes. Her breasts, those full, soft, sensitive, and oh so responsive breasts. Those
		nipples that hardened with just a look, that sent palpable shockwaves through the young
		woman when they were licked, that never seemed to tire of being played with, much to the
		gunslinger's great joy. Josie felt the familiar stirring deep inside as her desire for
		Rebecca once again welled to the surface, threatening to take control. The gunslinger
		turned her attention reluctantly to the road, searching carefully for any sign of other
		people. The long, flat land stretched out for miles in all directions, satisfying her that
		they were completely alone.</p>

		<p>Josie knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had to have
		Rebecca right then and right there, and she would. She tucked the reins under her leg,
		keeping them nearby just in case. Flossy was well mannered enough or lazy enough to follow
		the trail made by so many previous travelers. That task completed, Josie leaned over and,
		without warning, scooped her half-asleep lover up in her arms and deposited her on her
		lap. Before the startled woman could say a word, her mouth was claimed in a fierce kiss
		that spoke of the gunslinger's need and desire. "I love you, sprite. I love you and I
		have to have you."</p>

		<p>"Mmm," the blonde replied as Josie thoroughly kissed
		her again. Sitting across the gunslinger's lap, Rebecca was completely helpless to her
		wandering hands, a fact that Josie exploited to her full benefit. Her left arm was
		supporting Rebecca?s back while her right arm was roaming up and down Rebecca?s
		body, squeezing firm thighs and buttocks, softly cupping her full breasts. Josie knew
		exactly where the blonde?s nipples were and deliberately avoided them in her
		exploration, knowing that it would drive Rebecca even higher with desire.
		"Josie?" Although surprised by the sudden move onto the gunslinger's lap,
		Rebecca nonetheless willingly surrendered herself to whatever her love wanted. She moaned
		softly as a demanding tongue possessed her mouth, driving away all rational thought. Such
		was what the tall woman did to her. Her touch, the strength of her desire, the absolute
		wholeness of her love overpowered the younger woman?s senses, leaving her weak-kneed
		and helpless, burning with an ache that only Josie could satisfy.</p>

		<p>Tongues danced and dueled within the confines of the young
		woman's mouth while strong, nimble fingers deftly began to unbutton the top of
		Rebecca?s dress. Small fingers dug deep into raven hair in a vain attempt to bring
		them closer. Josie's fingertip drew a slow, sensual line from just below Rebecca?s
		ear to her navel, leaving a trail of goosebumps and excited nerves in its wake. Rebecca
		groaned in protest when the kiss ended, but gasped in pure pleasure when she felt those
		warm lips close around her earlobe. "J-Josie ?mmm?don't you think we
		should?ooh?stop?for a while? Oh..." Every flicker of the gunslinger's
		tongue against her sensitive lobe sent jolts of pleasure through her body to pool between
		her legs.</p>

		<p>"No," Josie replied as she pulled her lips away for a
		moment to whisper into Rebecca?s ear, smiling when she saw and felt the younger woman
		shudder at the huskiness of her voice. "I don't want to stop?anything."
		Josie licked her ear to prove her point. "You really don't want me to stop, do
		you?" She said, grinning at the vigorous shake of the blonde head. "Hmm, I
		didn't think so." She rewarded Rebecca?s answer by continuing to unbutton the
		bodice of her dress and reaching inside to cup the left breast, her thumb lazily rubbing
		back and forth against the hardened nipple. "Very nice, sprite?I love the way
		your body responds to my touch." She had no doubt that her young love was dripping
		with passion and the thought only served to increase the trickle between her own legs.</p>

		<p>"Unngh?I love?your touch," Rebecca moaned as
		her hips started to rock.</p>

		<p>"Hmm?so it would seem," Josie said before bringing
		her mouth down to taste the sweetness of Rebecca?s lips again. The kiss turned from
		gentle to passionate to searing to completely out of control as the gunslinger's fingers
		squeezed and fondled Rebecca?s painfully erect nipple. They came up for air and Josie
		leaned back in her seat, pulling the young woman's head against her chest as both fought
		to regain the senses that the kiss had completely decimated.</p>

		<p>"Stand up," Josie said softly, stilling the movement of
		her hand on the younger woman's back.</p>

		<p>"You've got to be kidding," Rebecca murmured, bringing
		her own hand from around the gunslinger's neck and cupping her right breast through the
		black shirt. "You don't really expect me to be able to move, do you?"</p>

		<p>Josie let her play for a few moments, enjoying the feeling before
		her own desires for the young woman finally won out. "Up." She helped Rebecca to
		her feet, keeping her hands around the small waist for balance. The gunslinger turned her
		and pulled her back down, this time so that the smaller woman?s legs were straddling
		her. Josie reached down and grabbed the backs of Rebecca?s thighs, pulling her knees
		up onto the sheepskin covered seat, which in turn, brought the young woman closer until
		the crotch of her underwear was pressed up against the gunslinger's belly. "Much
		better," Josie said as she reached up and finished unbuttoning Rebecca?s dress.
		She then pulled the top of the dress down off Rebecca?s shoulders, baring her
		succulent breasts. The motion also caused the young woman's arms to be pinned by the
		sleeves, a situation that Josie did not want. She loved the feel of those arms around her,
		the fingers clasping and unclasping her hair as she drove Rebecca wild with passion. No,
		this just would not do. She reached back and helped free the young woman's arms, in the
		process claiming a soft breast for her mouth.</p>

		<p>Rebecca cried out and did exactly what Josie wanted, burying her
		hands deep into the raven hair and pressing her body close. The constant jostling of the
		wagon made the familiar flicks of the gunslinger's tongue more pronounced, the sensations
		more intense. Josie kept both of her hands behind Rebecca?s back, supporting her and
		keeping her close as she moved her mouth to give equal attention to the other breast. The
		rocking of the blonde's hips became more pronounced as her need grew. The gunslinger
		smiled and nipped the tender nipple with her lips, groaning herself when she heard
		Rebecca?s moan. Josie reached down and cupped the firm buttocks with her hands,
		squeezing firmly before allowing one hand to reach even further between the young woman's
		legs and press against her swollen sex. Rebecca cried out and pressed hard against the
		strong fingers, cursing the material that stood between her and the fingers she so
		desperately needed to feel.</p>

		<p>"So ready," Josie murmured, pressing harder with her
		hand, the dampness of the cotton foretelling the flood that awaited her. She couldn't wait
		to remove Rebecca?s underwear, the need to please as great as the young woman's need
		to be pleased. The gunslinger released her hold on Rebecca?s breast and used the hand
		on Rebecca?s rear to push the young woman against her, raising her slightly. The
		movement caused a certain amount of slack in the material, just as Josie had hoped for.
		Rebecca?s head was buried in the crook of the gunslinger's neck, a position that the
		young woman quickly took advantage of, suckling and nibbling every piece of skin she could
		reach.</p>

		<p>Josie closed her eyes at the delicious sensation of her love
		devouring her neck. The movements of her fingers between Rebecca?s legs increased in
		pressure and speed in reaction to the young woman's movements against them. "Yes
		sprite," she murmured as a series of small cries escaped her lover's throat in rhythm
		to the firm strokes. The rough feel of her undergarments rubbing back and forth against
		her was enough to start the overheated blonde's body trembling. "Oh Rebecca?so
		nice?so very nice?." She murmured to her beloved as she continued the
		exquisite torture. The soft cries of passion mixed with deep, husky groans from Rebecca
		gave music to the motions of the gunslinger's fingers. Josie's own clit throbbed in rhythm
		to the activities taking place scant inches away. She spread her fingers out and pressed,
		trapping cloth and Rebecca?s most sensitive spot between them. Josie captured the
		little woman's sensitive earlobe in her mouth and began sucking in synch with the
		squeezing together of her fingers.</p>

		<p>"Josie?oh Josie ?unngh?oh?" Each
		word came out at a slightly higher pitch than the previous one. The gunslinger's arm
		pressed Rebecca hard against her, breasts crushing against each other as she released the
		lobe and placed her lips softly against the blonde's ear. The young woman heard every
		passion filled breath caress her ear, matching the tempo between her legs.</p>

		<p>"Oh sprite, I love you so much," Josie whispered
		softly, her own eyes shut tight as she lost herself to the feelings. "I love doing
		this, you know." The husky voice was having the desired effect on the treasure in her
		arms. Rebecca was doing more gulping than breathing as her thigh muscles clenched hard
		against the gunslinger's hips, unmindful of the gun strapped there. Josie pressed two
		fingers together and placed them squarely over the wet cotton that covered Rebecca?s
		swollen clit and rubbed hard and quick. "Yes sprite?now."</p>

		<p>The soft words spoken into her ear carried her over the edge.
		Rebecca?s fingers clawed helplessly at the gunslinger's shoulders as she cried out,
		her whole body shaking with the force of her orgasm. Josie's hand stilled, enjoying the
		flood of wetness that seeped through the cotton. She shifted the limp woman until she was
		lying across her lap, holding her close. "I love you, Rebecca," she murmured as
		she placed gentle kisses on her lover?s lips. "So beautiful."</p>

		<p>Green eyes opened to slowly focus on deep blue ones so full of
		love for her. Beneath her ear, Rebecca felt the steady thumping of the gunslinger's heart.
		She raised her hand to stroke the bronzed cheek. "I just look at you and I
		melt," she murmured, slowly feeling her energy return along with her passion. She
		slid off Josie's lap, holding on to her arms for support and changed positions, mindful of
		the leather reins lying tucked under the gunslinger's strong leg. Rebecca pressed with her
		knee, forcing Josie's legs apart. She pressed her knee firmly against the older woman's
		sex while pressing her own down against the bounty hunter's strong thigh. Both women
		groaned into each other's mouths at the contact. Rebecca kept her knee still as the
		raven-haired woman adjusted to just the right position. The blonde's hand gently fondled
		Josie's breast through the shirt as they started to rock against each other.</p>

		<p>The road beneath became just a bit rougher at that point, adding
		a few extra jolts to their rocking. The constant pulsing between Josie's legs grew in
		intensity until she finally felt the release she so desperately needed - a small, sweet,
		gentle orgasm to take the edge off, to sate the need momentarily. She let out a long, deep
		groan and held Rebecca close, knowing that the younger woman could feel her sex still
		pulsing through the layers of cloth. Both knew they weren't finished. Within seconds,
		Josie's hands were beginning to wander again and her mouth moved down to capture
		Rebecca?s breast. "Josie ?yessss," she hissed, arching her back and
		burying one hand into the raven hair while the other held on to the gunslinger?s
		shoulder for support. She thought she'd go over the edge right then when she felt Josie's
		warm tongue flicking back and forth on the sensitive flesh. The gunslinger reached down
		and tried to separate Rebecca from her clothes while remaining affixed to her breast, and
		growled with frustration when the task proved to be impossible. They separated long enough
		for Rebecca to sit down on the seat next to her and try to remove her boot. Josie's desire
		overrode her patience as she reached down and yanked the boot off easily.
		"Thanks," the smaller woman said, leaning in for a kiss.</p>

		<p>"Mmm, you are most welcome," she replied, deepening the
		kiss as her hand returned to one of its favorite places, namely her lover?s breast.
		She leaned forward, pressing Rebecca back down against the sheepskin. The leather reins
		fell loosely to the ground, causing Flossy to stop, not that either woman noticed, nor did
		they notice when the mare spotted a nearby patch of grass that looked quite tasty and she
		and Phoenix left the trail and began to graze. All the women noticed was the exquisite
		passion and desire that flowed between them. As much as Josie needed to feel the velvet
		liquid of Rebecca, she needed to make love to her breasts and mouth at the same time and
		couldn't pull herself away. Rebecca meanwhile was completely under the gunslinger's spell
		and unable to do anything more than softly moan and gently caress the raven head lying on
		her breast. Neither woman was particularly comfortable, but they were reluctant to move
		and end the moment. Only when Josie's back screamed at her and Rebecca?s leg
		threatened to cramp up did they finally separate. Josie looked at the fabric of
		Rebecca?s dress pooled around her waist with the flowing skirt still covering the
		treasure she longed to possess. Her fingers moved to the belt that held the garment up and
		Rebecca noticed that, quite surprisingly, the normally strong and sure hands were
		trembling as she worked to loosen the buckle.</p>

		<p>Josie knelt down in front of Rebecca, precariously balanced on
		the narrow floorboard. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Josie dimly noted that they were
		no longer moving, but filed it away such as one might the knowledge that apples were on
		sale at the trading post. Slower than she thought possible, her hands drew Rebecca?s
		dress down over her hips, taking the underdrawers with it. Josie swallowed and her eyes
		became hooded as her nostrils filled with the scent of her lover and soft blonde curls
		came into view, glistening with desire. "Oh my little sprite," she murmured,
		bringing her lips in to nuzzle against the soaked hairs. She shoved the underdrawers down
		below Rebecca?s knees and reluctantly pulled her mouth back, but not before snaking
		her tongue out to coat it with the sweetest of honey. Rebecca pulled one foot free of the
		confining underwear and then kicked them off with the other foot.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger stood and quickly dropped her pants and drawers
		down to her ankles, the gunbelt hitting the floorboard with a thud. She twisted and sat
		back down, holding her arms out for her willing lover to join her. Rebecca quickly
		straddled her leg; her soaked thighs rested just above equally wet ones. She put her hands
		on Josie's chest to stop her advances. "Wait," rocking gently against her, the
		blonde unbuttoned the gunslinger's shirt, pushing it aside to reveal the full mounds,
		erect with need. Rebecca spread her knees apart, sliding down to cover Josie's nipple with
		her mouth. Instantly a firm hand grasped the back of her head, keeping her in place.</p>

		<p>"Yes?" Josie hissed, throwing her head back, the
		raven hair falling loosely around her shoulders. Her eyes fluttered shut as Rebecca began
		to nibble and nip in addition to her suckling and licking. She pressed the young woman's
		mouth against her harder, not completely worried if she could breath or not, the need so
		overpowering. "Please?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew the meaning behind the timbre of Josie's voice. She
		raked her teeth across the engorged nipple and moved to the other side, the gunslinger's
		hand still firmly planted against the back of her head. Her fingers quickly took up
		residence at the abandoned nipple, pinching and rolling it between them while her lips,
		teeth, and tongue mercilessly attacked the other. Rebecca?s soft moans of delight
		blended with the groans of the gunslinger as they remained lost in time to the rest of the
		world.</p>

		<p>Josie's hands began a lazy descent down Rebecca?s back until
		she couldn't resist the urge any longer. She reached down and slipped her index finger
		between the folds, groaning both at the amount of sweet nectar that awaited her and at the
		increased sucking on her breast, no doubt a direct result of her actions between
		Rebecca?s legs. The gunslinger pulled her closer, causing the young woman to lose her
		hold on the bounty hunter's nipple. She quickly found Josie's mouth an acceptable
		substitute, driving her tongue in just as she felt the firm finger stroke against her
		clit. Rebecca wrapped her arms tightly around the gunslinger's neck and rocked hard
		against her hand. Josie slipped another finger in to join the first in her quest to take
		Rebecca. Once both were soaked to her satisfaction, she pulled them back and slowly
		circled her young love's entrance. "Oh god, please Josie ?please," Rebecca
		cried as she tried unsuccessfully to drive herself onto the strong fingers. She growled in
		frustration and dove against the gunslinger's neck, determined to convince her tall lover
		to give her what she needed.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?" Josie said with a moan, leaning her
		head back to allow better access, her fingers lightly brushing against the smaller woman's
		sensitive nub. Without warning, Josie entered her with one long deep stroke. Rebecca cried
		out, slamming her hips down hard, trying to drive the gunslinger in deeper. Josie added a
		third finger, filling her lover while her other hand slid around to the front and joined
		the pleasure. She rubbed and circled Rebecca?s sensitive clit in rhythm to her stokes
		in and out, both of which were picking up speed as the blonde's hips moved faster than
		they would ever have been able to do under any other circumstances. Her groans and cries
		grew louder and she reached for Josie's nipples, wanting her to share in the moment.
		"Yes?yes my sprite?so good?"</p>

		<p>"It's?because?oh?of you?." Both
		women?s voices were strained and panting from exertion.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?" Josie stopped the movements of her
		hands and waited until the young woman opened her eyes and looked at her.
		"Watch," Josie said softly as she moved her hand from the front of her love to
		reach between her own folds, letting out a deep groan as she touched the long denied
		nerve. She stroked Rebecca firmly, raising her off her lap with each upward stroke. The
		young woman's hands continued to fondle Josie's ample bosom while the gunslinger used her
		hands to pleasure them both. Rebecca looked down and watched as Josie's fingers moved back
		and forth rapidly against her own sex. She looked back up to watch the blue eyes flutter
		shut and the gunslinger's back arch. Josie's hand became a blur against herself as her
		other hand stilled within her lover. She threw her head back and gritted her teeth as she
		felt Rebecca?s warm mouth claim her left breast, her right one being kneaded and
		pinched by knowing fingers. With a howl that barely resembled her lover's name, Josie's
		hips lurched off the seat and her legs slammed shut, trapping her left hand between them.
		Rebecca had the presence of mind to use her hands to grab on to the gunslinger's shoulders
		for balance. The bounty hunter remained motionless for a moment as the shocks pulsed
		through her body. Josie slowly lowered herself back on the damp seat with Rebecca tucked
		against her chest. With infinite slowness, she began to stroke her lover again, long, deep
		strokes that earned the gunslinger a hedonistic groan from the young woman. Within
		seconds, Josie felt the rush of renewed passion flowing from within Rebecca and she picked
		up the pace, bringing her left hand back through the golden curls to stroke the blonde's
		aching bundle of nerves.</p>

		<p>"Josie?oh?yes, please?Josie?"
		Rebecca gave up on rational thought, digging her fingers into the gunslinger's upper arms.
		Her hips rocked back and forth wantonly as she forced her lover's strong fingers into her
		again and again. Her body quivered, then stilled, frozen in ecstasy. Josie expended her
		remaining energy, ignoring the ache in her forearm as she tried to draw out Rebecca?s
		orgasm as long as possible. The gunslinger's name was torn from the young woman's lips as
		she reached the pinnacle of pleasure and collapsed against Josie's chest.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger immediately withdrew her hands, pulling
		Rebecca?s center up to press against her lower belly in an attempt to maintain
		contact with the still quivering area. She wrapped her arms around the healer and murmured
		soft words of endearment to her. "Shh?I've got you. I love you?I'm right
		here, sprite." Josie didn't know if Rebecca heard the words or not but she knew she
		understood the meaning and the tone as she felt the young woman relax against her. She
		felt the strong heartbeat slowing down to a more normal pace as she stroked the blonde
		hair and held her tight until she felt Rebecca try to move.</p>

		<p>"You?" The young woman said, reaching up to stroke
		her finger down the length of the gunslinger's cheek, "?are wonderful."</p>

		<p>"Mmm?" Josie took the wayward finger and kissed it
		before pulling Rebecca closer to her. "So are you, sprite?so are you."</p>

		<p>They sat together like that for several moments until a soft
