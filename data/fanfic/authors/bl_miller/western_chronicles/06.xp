	<chapter title="37: Whittling Away the Time">
		<p>Josie woke to find one arm and leg draped casually over her and
		Rebecca&#146;s head resting on her shoulder. She didn't want to disturb the comfortably
		sleeping woman, but her bladder was protesting too much. As gently as she could, the
		gunslinger slipped out from under her and got out of bed. The early morning chill raised
		gooseflesh on her skin and the rough and tumble gunslinger really wished they had a
		chamber pot as she reached for her longjohns. After making certain that Rebecca was
		covered with the blankets, she picked up her boots and one gunbelt and quietly left the
		room.</p>

		<p>Josie was already up on the roof pulling away shingles when
		Charles left the house, rifle in hand, and headed through the clump of cottonwoods.
		Rebecca came out a few minutes later with a cup of coffee in her hand. She stood on the
		ground and looked up at the woman in black, already sweating from the heat of the morning
		sun. "Hi," She called up.</p>

		<p>"Hi yourself."</p>

		<p>"Brought you some coffee. Sorry I forgot to set the pot up
		for you last night." She walked over to the ladder and waited for Josie to come down.
		"Thanks for letting me sleep," she said when she handed the mug over to the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"It's all right. Did Charles say where he was going?"</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca replied. "I'm sure he'll be fine,
		though. He was in a good mood when he left."</p>

		<p>Josie downed the rest of the coffee and handed the cup back to
		her. "I need you to take Flossy and go get the rest of our things from the wagon
		before someone happens upon it. Should only take you three or four trips if you load the
		horse up right." Since the wagon was less than a mile from the house, and thus within
		earshot, Josie didn't make her take a gun along. The gunslinger did, however, still insist
		on Rebecca taking one of the bowie knives, just in case.</p>

		<p>It was late afternoon when Rebecca finished getting the rest of
		their things. She had just finished brushing down Flossy and putting her back in her stall
		when a shot rang out from beyond the trees. She ran out of the barn in time to see Josie
		race down the ladder and pull her gun from the holster. "Get inside and don't come
		out I until tell you to," Josie yelled as she ran into the cottonwoods and
		disappeared from sight. Rebecca stood frozen to the spot, unable to move. Several minutes
		later another shot rang out. There was no sign of either Charles or Josie. Rebecca headed
		for the woods, forgetting all about her friend's instructions in her worry. She almost
		reached the trees when the gunslinger appeared.</p>

		<p>"I thought I told you to go inside and wait," she said,
		concerned about the look on the young woman's face. "What's wrong?"</p>

		<p>"I was worried." Rebecca replied. "Where's
		Charles?"</p>

		<p>"He's back with the deer. Fresh meat for dinner tonight.
		Hope you know how to cook venison."</p>

		<p>"That's what those shots were? Heck, Josie, I thought
		someone was attacking you two." The gunslinger caught the tone of worry in the young
		woman's voice and immediately felt bad for scaring her so. Without saying a word, she held
		her arms out slightly and invited Rebecca in for a brief hug.</p>

		<p>"I was trying to keep you safe, not scare you," she
		said to the top of the blonde head.</p>

		<p>"Well, I was," she admitted. "Don't do that to me
		again." She pulled back from the hug and smiled. "So, venison for dinner, huh?
		I'll cook it, but you're gonna have to skin it."</p>

		<p>"Deal," the gunslinger replied. "Just came back to
		get some rope. It's a small buck, but he sure is heavy. Gonna have to drag him."</p>

		<p>"You just make sure that you wash up before coming in to
		eat," Rebecca said, wagging her finger. "And I mean it, with soap and
		everything."</p>

		<p>"Yes mother," the gunslinger said mockingly, receiving
		a playful backhand to the belly.</p>

		<p>"Keep it up and you can go sleep with Phoenix."</p>

		<p>"At least Phoenix doesn't snore," Josie teased back.</p>

		<p>"You're right, she doesn't; but then again, Phoenix doesn't
		give backrubs."</p>

		<p>Josie held up her hands in defeat. "I'll wash, I'll wash.
		I'm not giving up those backrubs for anything." She watched as the broadest grin came
		over the young woman's face and realized with a slight smile that she&#146;d be lucky if
		she ever won an argument with Rebecca again.</p>

		<p>After a filling meal of venison steaks, Josie took the rest of
		the meat to the smokehouse while Rebecca cleaned up after dinner and Charles worked on
		getting a fire going in the fireplace. Once again in possession of her medical text, the
		young woman sat down in the chair, turned the wick up on the lamp, and resumed her
		reading.</p>

		<p>"That's a mighty big book you got there," he commented.
		"What's it for?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, it's about medicine and healing. Josie got it for
		me," she added proudly.</p>

		<p>"Wanna be a doctor, do ya?" he said as he lit a
		cigarette.</p>

		<p>"Oh no, I could never be a doctor, too much schooling. I
		would like to help people though."</p>

		<p>"My Lillian wanted to be a nurse once. Girl's too darn smart
		for schooling, though. Ever seen one like that? Too smart to be taught, that's what she
		was. Ruth tried. She bought her books and even took her to the library at Harvard a lot
		when they were living with my kin in Boston. For almost four years she took her there
		every week. Lillian spent hours there, just reading everything. When I came home, I
		couldn't believe how much she knew. Like a sponge, that one was." His eyes took on a
		lost glaze, remembering a happy time so long ago. Rebecca reached out and squeezed his
		hand, receiving a smile in return. "Well," he sniffed, "I guess that's
		enough talk about things long past." He reached out with his free hand and patted
		hers. "We should do something fun."</p>

		<p>"Like what?" she said, putting her book down gently on
		the floor.</p>

		<p>"Now I know I have some cards around here somewhere,"
		he said as he stood up. He walked into the kitchen and opened and closed several drawers
		before he found what he was looking. "I knew I had some." He returned to the
		parlor holding a worn deck of playing cards in his hand. "What would you like to
		play?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'm afraid I don't know how to play cards," she
		said apologetically. Charles smiled a warm, grandfatherly smile and began to shuffle the
		deck.</p>

		<p>"Well then now is a good time to learn. What would you like
		to learn? Ruth used to play cards all the time. You see that piece of wood over
		there?" he pointed to a thin board two feet by three feet leaning against the wall.
		"She'd put that across her lap right in that chair and play solitaire for hours. I
		couldn't tell you how many decks of cards she went through. Horace used to bring a new
		deck each time he'd visit." He stopped shuffling and waited for her answer. She
		thought about what kind of card game would be good to learn.</p>

		<p>"Can you teach me how to play poker? I know Josie knows how
		to play that game." She thought it might be nice to play a game with her friend.
		"Oh, but I don't have any money to play with."</p>

		<p>Charles chuckled. "Not to worry, we'll use what Horace and I
		use when we play." He got up, went back out into the kitchen, and removed two small
		sacks from the drawer. "It'll be easier to play at the table." He suggested,
		setting the sacks on the table. Rebecca joined him and took the offered bag.</p>

		<p>"Beans?"</p>

		<p>"Yup, Horace and I never play for money." He dealt out
		the cards, smiling when he saw the look of total concentration on the young face. Oh yes,
		this was going to be much more fun than playing with his brother, who insisted on playing
		cutthroat poker. "Do you like wild cards, honey?"</p>

		<p>"What are wild cards?" she asked innocently.</p>

		<p>"Wonderful," he said with a smile.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Once all the meat was cut up and hung around the inside of the
		smokehouse, Josie went to the barn to get some kindling. She picked up the ax and ran her
		thumb along the end, checking it for sharpness. Not at all pleased with it, she went over
		the workbench to get the whetstone. Sitting next to the stone was a knife with a short
		blade and a long handle, perfect for whittling. Setting the ax down, Josie walked back
		over to the woodpile and picked up a piece of split wood. She sat down on a stool and
		turned the wood over in her hands, studying the grain and inspecting it for knots. She
		treated six more pieces to the same scrutiny before selecting one and setting it on the
		workbench next to the knife. She pulled the handmade wheelbarrow over to the pile of wood
		and loaded it for the smokehouse.</p>

		<p>"So when is Horace coming?" Rebecca asked laying two
		cards face down on the table. Charles handed her two new ones before taking three for
		himself.</p>

		<p>"Hmm, should be in about ten days or so. He'll stay
		overnight, then move on. I'll see him about a week after that on his return trip." He
		pushed two dry beans into the pile on the center of the table.</p>

		<p>"Do you think Josie will be done with the roof by
		then?" She met his two beans and raised him two.</p>

		<p>"I don't think so, Rebecca. There's a lot of work to be done
		up there. I know she's a strong woman, but even a strapping young man wouldn't be able to
		get it done in ten days." He matched her two beans. "What'cha got?"</p>

		<p>"Three nines. Well, I guess that means we'll be here for my
		birthday. Its in eleven days," she said, setting her cards down to show him.</p>

		<p>"Your birthday? How old will you be? Three tens." He
		took the pot, leaving one bean behind for the ante.</p>

		<p>"Twenty," she answered while he dealt another hand.</p>

		<p>"Well then, we'll have to have a little celebration for
		you," he said as he discarded one card.</p>

		<p>"Oh please don't think about it. All it means is that I'm
		another year older. It's no great shakes. Three cards please."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>After making sure the fire was going nicely, Josie left the
		smokehouse and returned to the barn. She picked up the piece of wood and the whittling
		knife and headed for the porch swing. The late evening sun cast its orange light upon the
		sky while the dark headed woman put the blade to the wood. Thin curly slivers began to
		multiply on the porch floor. Josie continued to shave off pieces of the wood, not giving
		any thought as to what she was making. The foot long quartered log found its edges rounded
		under her blade. Far away a coyote cried out to the approaching moon. She tucked one leg
		up underneath her and used her other foot to set the swing into a gentle rocking motion.
		By the time darkness made it impossible for her to go on, the entire floor and seat around
		her was covered with the slivers of wood. She stood up, set the wood and knife on the
		swing, and brushed the slivers off her britches before going in.</p>

		<p>She found Rebecca and Charles seated at the table, the younger
		with a huge pile of beans in front of her and cards in her hand. "Charles, what are
		you teaching her?"</p>

		<p>"Full house, right?" Rebecca said as she laid her hand
		down and smiled.</p>

		<p>"That's exactly what it is, child. You win again," he
		said, passing the deck to her. Josie walked over and looked at the cards on the table.</p>

		<p>"She doesn't have a full house, she's got two fives, two
		sixes, and a two."</p>

		<p>"Twos are wild," Rebecca said, pulling the cards
		together and shuffling. She did it slowly, worried about sending them all over the table
		and floor again like she did when she first tried to follow the kindly old man's
		instructions.</p>

		<p>"Wild cards are for old ladies and children," the
		gunslinger muttered under her breath.</p>

		<p>"You wanna play, Josie?" she said, looking expectantly
		at the older woman. "You can have some of my beans." Her eyes took on the
		expression of a puppy dog and her lips formed a slight pout. The bounty hunter pulled the
		chair from the parlor to the end of the table, tucking her feet under herself to make up
		some of the difference in height from the chair to the table. Rebecca pushed a pile of
		beans over to her and started to pass out the cards.</p>

		<p>"Threes are wild."</p>

		<p>"Wonderful," Josie said, trying hard not to groan at
		how silly it was to play like that. She picked her cards up one at a time. Three, ten,
		three, nine, queen. A straight with no effort. She counted out ten beans and pushed them
		forward only to be stopped by a smaller hand.</p>

		<p>"The most you can bet is three beans."</p>

		<p>"You're kidding."</p>

		<p>"Nope. Three's the limit. Want any cards?"</p>

		<p>"No. I'm fine," she said sourly as she slouched back in
		her seat. Charles took two and Rebecca took three, her face lighting up as she put the new
		cards into her hand.</p>

		<p>"Nice poker face," the gunslinger drawled. "If you
		have a good hand, try not to show any expression. Otherwise everyone will fold and you
		won't win any money."</p>

		<p>"Oh, okay," she said, trying to make her face as
		expressionless as possible. Charles folded. "Your bet, Josie."</p>

		<p>"Two." She pushed two beans into the pot and the
		younger woman matched it. "Straight to the king," she said with a smirk. Rebecca
		broke into a broad grin.</p>

		<p>"Flush." She laid down a hand full of hearts.</p>

		<p>"Beginner's luck," Josie growled. "Deal."</p>

		<p>"That's one thing she has," Charles said with a wry
		smile. "At the rate she's going, I'll be broke within an hour," he said waving
		his hand toward his dwindling supply of dry beans.</p>

		<p>"Don't worry Charles, I'll be happy to loan you some, just
		like</p>

		<p>Josie."</p>

		<p>"Loan me? You mean I owe you these beans?"</p>

		<p>"Of course," Rebecca said with a mischievous smile.
		"So you'd better hurry up and win a hand so you can start paying me back."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'll pay you back all right," Josie playfully
		threatened as she picked up the new hand of cards. Charles chuckled and tossed his bean in
		the pot.</p>

		<p>The winnings passed back and forth amongst the three of them for
		hours. Rebecca won more than the others, but continued to feed her pile of beans across
		and down the table to keep the others in the game, not wanting it to end. When Josie saw
		her fighting to stay awake, the gunslinger tossed her cards down on the table. "I
		think it's time for the sandman." She rose to her feet and put the chair back where
		it belonged. Rebecca collected all the cards into one neat pile and left them on the table
		along with the beans.</p>

		<p>"Yeah...I am pretty tired," she said. "Goodnight
		Charles."</p>

		<p>"Goodnight Rebecca."</p>

		<p>Within minutes they were under the covers, the gunslinger in her
		longjohns and Rebecca in her nightgown. "Thanks for playing tonight," the young
		woman said softly.</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it. Just don't go getting any ideas in
		your head about walking into a saloon and sitting down at a table," Josie warned
		gently. "They don't play with wild cards."</p>

		<p>"Oh I won't, I promise. I'll leave that kind of stuff up to
		you," she said as she snuggled deeper into the older woman's embrace. Both well fed
		and comfortable, it was only a matter of moments before they were both sound asleep.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="38: Preparations">
		<p>The routine they had established varied little as the days went
		by. Each morning it was harder for Josie to pull herself away from the sleeping form next
		to her. Instead of separating herself from Rebecca, she found her arms snaking around her
		to draw her even closer. And even in her sleep, Rebecca returned the embrace, snugging her
		own arm around Josie&#146;s middle and draping her leg over Josie&#146;s thigh. Josie had
		never felt such contentment. She would wait until she heard Charles puttering around in
		the house and finally with a soft kiss to Rebecca&#146;s lips she would drag herself out
		of bed.</p>

		<p>Before Josie climbed up on the roof, both she and Charles trooped
		to the flower garden to pick a handful of flowers. With a wave, Charles would then make
		his way to the cottonwoods to visit with his wife, and Josie would put the fresh flowers
		in the vase for Rebecca.</p>

		<p>On the fifth morning before he walked away, Charles called out to
		Josie who stopped and turned around. "Been meaning to ask you, you know
		Rebecca&#146;s birthday is coming up in a few days&#133;" he began, but stopped when
		the look on her face made it clear she had not known.</p>

		<p>"No, she didn&#146;t tell me," she said. She was hurt
		that Rebecca had told Charles about her birthday, but did not share it with her. She
		squared her shoulders and tried to act like it didn&#146;t matter. "What day is
		it?"</p>

		<p>"The twenty-first. I want to do something special for her,
		but I don&#146;t know her well enough to know what she&#146;d like. Maybe you could give
		me some ideas?"</p>

		<p>Josie thought about it for a few moments and then said,
		"Well, she loves to read. A book would be nice. Or some fabric and embroidery
		thread," she added, remembering how much Rebecca had enjoyed embroidery once she
		finally caught on.</p>

		<p>Charles&#146; face lit up; he had the perfect gift for her.</p>

		<p>"Thanks, Josie. Oh, and not a word to Rebecca, all
		right?"</p>

		<p>"Count on it," she said as she watched him walk off
		with lightness in his step she had not seen before. She only wished she had an idea of
		what she could give her. And then it came to her. The piece of wood she had been
		half-heartedly whittling on for several days had gradually resolved itself into a fairly
		decent looking totem. If she could finish it in time she was certain Rebecca would like
		it, fascinated as she was with all things Cherokee. It would mean stopping work on the
		roof earlier in the day so she would have more daylight hours to work on it. Rebecca had
		been occupied with her own tasks and didn&#146;t seem to notice what the gunslinger was up
		to, so she figured she could accomplish it without her being any the wiser. Josie hummed
		as she went about her work on the roof, and thought of things she could do to make
		Rebecca&#146;s birthday a very special day.</p>

		<p>Horace arrived two days before Rebecca&#146;s birthday. From her
		vantage point on the roof Josie could see the dust of his wagon even before the wagon
		itself was visible. She was fairly certain it must be Charles&#146; brother coming down
		the road, but to be on the safe side she climbed down from the roof and strapped on a gun.
		When he pulled into the door yard with a jangling of harness and was met by a tall woman
		dressed in black with her hand lightly resting on the handle of her gun, he pulled up
		short with a look of confusion on his face that changed to fear. "Has something
		happened to my brother?" He asked, his voice tinged with hysteria. Josie removed her
		hand from her gun and held both hands in front of her as a sign of peace.</p>

		<p>"No, he&#146;s fine," she said quickly to relieve his
		anxiety. "He&#146;s out in the grove yonder," she said gesturing toward the
		cottonwoods, and Horace nodded in understanding. He often found his brother out there when
		he came to visit. "My friend and I have been helping him around the place in exchange
		for an axle for our wagon."</p>

		<p>Horace visibly relaxed when he realized his brother was in no
		danger. He looked around then and it was obvious that a lot of work had been done to the
		place since the last time he was there. The roof was almost completely replaced and the
		yard was neatly trimmed and the rubbish that had accumulated over the years was gone. Even
		the flowerbeds, which had been overrun with weeds when last he noticed, were neat looking
		and colorful. It did not look like the same place at all, but instead looked as it had
		when Ruth was alive. He shook his head, incredulous. "I wouldn&#146;t a recognized
		the place," he said, smiling and stepping forward with his hand outstretched.
		"I&#146;m Horace, Charles&#146; younger brother," he said as he pumped her hand
		vigorously.</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;" She nearly blurted out her last name, but
		realized that Horace was more a man of the world than his brother, and might be inclined
		to turn her in for the reward if he knew who she was.</p>

		<p>"Purely pleased to make your acquaintance," he said
		brightly. "You have surely done wonders here. My brother is lucky to have found
		you."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I only did the roof. Charles and my friend Rebecca have
		been working on the rest of the place. And speaking of Rebecca, I have a favor to ask of
		you&#133;" she added conspiratorially.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>When Rebecca walked through the door that evening with a bucket
		of wild blackberries she had picked down by the creek, Josie and Charles abruptly fell
		silent. It seemed that every time she came upon them unawares these days they were in the
		middle of a heated discussion that ended the moment she appeared. Since she had never in
		her life had anything special done for her birthday, it did not occur to her that they
		were planning something pleasant. Rather she feared that Josie might be softening her up
		with flowers and kindness every day because she was conspiring with Charles to leave her
		there when she departed. Certainly Josie was not acting like she wanted to leave her, and
		in fact, the opposite seemed to be true. And Josie had promised never to leave her behind
		as long as she wanted to stay with her, so Rebecca was truly confused about what was going
		on.</p>

		<p>The one thing she was not confused about was the way she felt
		every time Josie brushed her finger over her lips, or whispered into her ear, or twined
		her fingers together with her own. Josie&#146;s smile made her weak in the knees, and when
		she spooned her body around Rebecca&#146;s in bed at night, Rebecca could feel the wetness
		bloom between her legs. She had never realized that it was possible for two women to love
		each other as a man and a woman did, but when Josie told her about Genie, it was obvious
		from the pain in her voice that Josie had been in love with Genie. Dare she hope that
		Josie&#146;s actions were those of a woman in love? It seemed so, but Rebecca&#146;s lack
		of experience made her uncertain. She promised herself that she would pluck up her courage
		and ask the beautiful outlaw outright.</p>

		<p>But she didn&#146;t. Josie excused herself right after supper and
		went out to the barn to "work on something." Rebecca cleaned up the kitchen as
		fast as she could, and was putting a shawl around her shoulders to go out and speak to
		Josie when Charles practically pounced on her.</p>

		<p>"Where you off to?" He asked innocently enough, but it
		appeared to Rebecca that he was more than simply curious.</p>

		<p>"Thought I&#146;d go see if I could help Josie with whatever
		she&#146;s working on," she replied. She continued toward the door, and Charles
		bounded in front of her and hooked his arm through hers.</p>

		<p>"Aw, I kinda hoped you might want to play some card games
		with me. Josie&#146;s about finished with that roof and you folks&#146;ll be movin&#146;
		on. There&#146;s still lots of games I need to teach you before you go."</p>

		<p>He sounded almost desperate to the girl, and she realized that
		when they did leave &#150; and she was determined Josie would not leave her behind &#150;
		Charles would be even lonelier than he was before they came, having become used to the
		presence of other people. With a sigh she took off her shawl and draped it back on the peg
		by the door, and smiling at the old man, she took a seat at the table. "OK, Charles,
		what can I beat you out of today?" She said with a grin. She would talk to Josie
		later.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Gin," Rebecca said triumphantly, lying her cards out
		on the table with a flourish. Charles groaned and threw his cards down on the table and
		scowled playfully at his young protégé.</p>

		<p>"Upon my soul girl, if I hadn&#146;t dealt those cards
		myself, I&#146;d have to wonder if you weren&#146;t pulling a fast one on old
		Charlie."</p>

		<p>"Beginners luck. Again," she said with a laugh as she
		gathered up the cards. When she had finished putting the cards together, she stood up and
		stretched. They had been playing for at least an hour or more, and the hard wooden chairs
		were less than comfortable. She stifled a yawn. "Excuse me. I&#146;m about done
		in," she said apologetically. "Think I&#146;ll just go see if&#133;"</p>

		<p>"You can&#146;t quit without letting me have a chance to get
		even," Charles said quickly. "How about best three out of five? You already have
		two to my one, so it shouldn&#146;t take long." He started shuffling the cards, and
		dealt out the hands without waiting for a response from the little blonde. She shook her
		head as if to say there was no winning an argument with this stubborn old man, gave
		another stretch and started to sit down. At that moment the door opened and Josie stepped
		through, surprised to see Rebecca still up. The young woman normally went to bed shortly
		after finishing her chores in the kitchen. There was a silent conversation between
		Josie&#146;s eyes and Charles&#146;, and the gunslinger realized that he had been keeping
		the little blonde from going out to see what Josie was up to. She mouthed "thank
		you" at him as she walked into the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water.</p>

		<p>"Your little friend whupped my tail at gin all night,"
		Charles grumbled lightly as he gathered up the cards. Turning to Rebecca he smiled and
		said, "Think you got the right idea, punkin&#146;. I&#146;m plumb wore out my self.
		Suppose we have us a grudge match tomorrow, what do you say?"</p>

		<p>"Sounds good to me," Rebecca agreed quickly, glad he
		had abandoned the notion of playing another game. "I&#146;m just going to make a
		little trip to the uh&#133;" she nodded in the general direction of the back of the
		house where the outhouse was located then continued, "and then I&#146;m going to bed.
		How about you, Josie?"</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "I think I&#146;ll let you go to the
		"uh" by yourself, and I&#146;ll be along to bed directly." Rebecca gave her
		a big smile as she threw her shawl around her shoulders once again and, picking up a
		lantern, she headed out into the night. Taking advantage of her absence, Josie filled
		Charles in on the errand she had sent Horace on for the next day, which relieved his mind.
		His brother was seldom late, and he had been concerned when Horace had not shown up that
		day as he said he would.</p>

		<p>Her hands were red-brown from the stain she used on the totem. As
		she wiped at them with a rag dabbed in coal oil, they were talking animatedly about how
		surprised Rebecca was going to be the next day, when the object of their conversation
		walked back through the door, and they fell silent. Josie smiled at her warmly, and
		Charles gave her a wink. He rose and took the lamp from Rebecca&#146;s hand and darted out
		the door to relieve his bladder, which had begun to pain him after sitting for so long. He
		had been afraid to excuse himself while they were playing their game for fear she would go
		in search of Josie.</p>

		<p>Pumping water into the sink, Josie washed her hands several times
		until she was satisfied that the smell of the coal oil was gone. She turned from the sink
		to find Rebecca standing virtually right behind her, a look of concern on her face. Josie
		blinked a few times in surprise to find that her self defense mechanism had allowed the
		young girl to get so close without her even realizing she was there.</p>

		<p>"What is it, Rebecca? What&#146;s wrong?" Josie reached
		out and brushed a strand of hair from Rebecca&#146;s forehead, then she lightly caressed
		her cheek. Running her hand down the adored face, she lightly touched Rebecca&#146;s lips
		with her fingertips. Rebecca trembled at the touch, and her eyes fluttered shut. Josie put
		her arms around Rebecca&#146;s waist, and the smaller woman allowed herself to be pulled
		into those strong arms. She laid her head on Josie&#146;s chest, listening to the sound of
		Josie&#146;s heart thundering like an avalanche down a mountain.</p>

		<p>Rebecca&#146;s plan to calmly talk to Josie dissolved as she
		blurted out, "Don&#146;t leave me here. Please take me with you; I c-couldn&#146;t
		s-stand it if you left me&#133;" She burrowed into Josie&#146;s chest, her head
		resting just below the taller woman&#146;s chin.</p>

		<p>"Whoa, whoa," Josie said, pulling back so she could see
		Rebecca&#146;s face. "What makes you think I&#146;m going to leave you? I said you
		could stay with me as long as you wanted to, and I meant it. Of course you&#146;ll come
		with me." She tilted Rebecca&#146;s chin up so she could look into her eyes.
		"Rebecca, I&#146;d be lost without you. Now come on, let me see a smile." Josie
		put her finger by the corner of Rebecca&#146;s mouth and gently pushed up, creating a
		lop-sided smile. "Kinda crooked but better than nothing," she said softly, which
		made Rebecca smile genuinely.</p>

		<p>"OK, if you&#146;re not planning to leave me here, then what
		is it that you and Charles are cooking up that you both shut up every time I come into the
		room? I thought at first it was my imagination, but when it continued for days, I
		couldn&#146;t pretend it wasn&#146;t happening any more. I was scared, Josie."</p>

		<p>"Oh sprite, it&#146;s&#133;nothing to be scared about,"
		she said quickly. She almost blurted out their plans for her birthday and bit the words
		back just in time. "In fact, I think you&#146;ll be pleased when you find out what it
		is." Rebecca still had a look of confusion on her face, but Josie shook her head and
		smiled. "I&#146;ve said too much already. You&#146;ll find out everything soon
		enough. Be patient, and trust me, will you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes of course, but&#133;"</p>

		<p>"No buts. It&#146;s time for bed. Come on." She grasped
		Rebecca&#146;s hand and led her toward the little bedroom they shared. Rebecca twined her
		fingers together with Josie&#146;s and followed willingly, still curious but no longer
		worried. She trusted Josie completely.</p>

		<p>Josie cupped her hand behind the flame of the candle and leaned
		forward to blow it out so that Rebecca could get undressed in the dark, as was her habit.
		The gunslinger hoped that one day soon her precious young friend would no longer feel the
		shame and embarrassment she had carried for so long because of her abusive father, and
		would allow Josie to see all of her.</p>

		<p>"Wait," Rebecca said from behind her, and she turned to
		once again find the little blonde close enough to kill her, if that had been her plan.
		Josie&#146;s razor sharp instincts had been dulled by the safe life she had been living
		lately. Once they left this haven behind, she would need to hone them again for her own
		safety, as well as for Rebecca&#146;s. "I&#133;want to talk a while, and I want to
		see your face," Rebecca said softly.</p>

		<p>"Fine with me," Josie said with a grin. "Do you
		mind if I get undressed while we talk?"</p>

		<p>"Not at all," Rebecca replied softly, sinking down to
		the edge of the bed and watching as the gunslinger&#146;s fingers methodically unfastened
		the buttons of her black shirt. When she peeled it off to reveal her shoulders and her
		creamy breasts, Rebecca was unable to take her eyes away from the beautiful spectacle.
		Josie&#146;s breasts fairly glowed in the dancing candle flame, and Rebecca ached to reach
		out and touch them. Transfixed by the tantalizing beauty in front of her, Rebecca suddenly
		found herself tongue-tied and blushing. She couldn&#146;t even think of what it was she
		wanted to say, and she simply sat like a schoolgirl admiring her first real crush.</p>

		<p>Josie couldn&#146;t help but notice where Rebecca&#146;s eyes
		were fastened, and she smiled at the mix of emotions revealed in that simple look. If she
		had ever wondered whether there was a chance the little blonde was attracted to her, she
		wondered no more. Blatant desire was written on Rebecca&#146;s young face, but there was
		uncertainty as well. Josie knew she must be patient with Rebecca and give her all the time
		she needed to sort out her feelings without her influence. Much as she wanted to take the
		smaller woman in her arms and smother her with kisses, she knew that Rebecca was not ready
		for that. She would allow Rebecca to set the pace, taking her cues from her.</p>

		<p>Rebecca suddenly realized that she was staring at Josie&#146;s
		breasts, and she had no concept of how much time had passed while she did so. She blushed
		as she wondered what Josie must be thinking. Reluctantly she dragged her eyes off
		Josie&#146;s glorious body and brought them to her beautiful face. Josie was watching her,
		a smile tipping up the corners of her mouth. Casually Josie turned away, pouring water
		from the pitcher on the wash stand into the wash basin. She figured Rebecca would have
		time to compose herself while she washed up a little. She soaked a cloth in the cool water
		and scrubbed it over her face, gooseflesh rising on her skin at the contact with the
		water. She wished she had thought to warm up some water before retiring to the bedroom,
		but it was a bit late for that now.</p>

		<p>The smooth planes of Josie&#146;s back were appealing to Rebecca,
		but were not the magnet for her eyes that her chest had been. Rebecca was able to remember
		what it was she wanted to talk to Josie about, and she cleared her throat and began.
		"Josie&#133;I wanted to ask you about&#133;I mean, I&#146;ve been wondering
		if&#133;that is, if you&#133;did you love Genie? I mean, romantically love her. Like a man
		and a woman do?" She could feel her cheeks flaming, but once she started speaking, it
		suddenly became very important that she got her question out before she lost her nerve
		completely. Josie&#146;s back stiffened at the question, and she laid down her washcloth
		and turned around again to face the furiously blushing girl.</p>

		<p>"Are you asking me if I was in love with Genie?" She
		asked, and Rebecca nodded mutely. "Yes. Yes, I was. But like a man and a woman?"
		She shook her head and seemed to contemplate her answer. "It was very different. More
		intense, more&#133;I don&#146;t know, fulfilling. I couldn&#146;t imagine having those
		kinds of feelings for a man. We didn&#146;t&#133;make love. Perhaps we would have if she
		had lived&#133;I don&#146;t know, but&#133;we didn&#146;t even discuss it. I thought we
		had all the time in the world&#133;." Her voice trailed off as she choked back a sob.
		This was not what she wanted to be doing; grieving for her lost love in front of the woman
		with whom she was now very much in love. She gulped a couple of times and took a deep
		breath to regain her composure.</p>

		<p>"Have you ever made love with other women since then?"
		Rebecca asked breathlessly. Josie took a few moments to frame her answer, and Rebecca
		wished she could bite out her tongue for having even asked. In her mind she kicked herself
		for starting this train of thought, but she had to see it through. She needed to know if
		Josie was still attracted to women, or if that was simply the crush of a teenaged girl.</p>

		<p>"You ask hard questions," Josie said sincerely. She sat
		on the edge of the bed and began to pull her boots off while considering how to reply.</p>

		<p>"Let me help," Rebecca said, dropping to the floor in
		front of the gunslinger. Lifting each foot in turn she pulled off her boots followed by
		the socks. She sat cross-legged on the floor and, drawing Josie&#146;s right foot into her
		lap she began to massage it. Josie&#146;s eyes drifted shut and she gave a little sigh.
		"What&#146;s the answer?" Rebecca persisted.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ve had sex with a few," Josie replied, and
		Rebecca looked at her questioningly with her eyebrow raised. "All right, more than a
		few," she amended with a wry smile. "But in my heart I never made love with any
		of them. It was just a pleasant way to relieve tension. Meant nothing to
		me&#133;emotionally." Rebecca&#146;s thumbs pressed convulsively on the bridge of
		Josie&#146;s foot as she took in the meaning of her words.</p>

		<p>"Easy love," Josie said with a chuckle. "I have to
		walk on those feet, and that won&#146;t be easy if you crush my instep."</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry," Rebecca said, hastily letting go of
		Josie&#146;s foot.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed lightly. "Feast or famine with you, isn&#146;t
		it sprite? I didn&#146;t say you had to stop; just don&#146;t break my foot." Rebecca
		blushed again and averted her eyes, but she did pick up Josie&#146;s foot and begin
		massaging it again. "OK, now it&#146;s my turn to ask a question. Why all the
		questions about making love with women?"</p>

		<p>Once again Rebecca&#146;s gift with words deserted her, and she
		found herself unable to speak in coherent sentences. "It&#146;s the way you&#146;ve
		been acting for the last few days, more attentive than usual&#133;not that you&#146;re not
		attentive other times," she stammered. "I&#146;m not saying this right&#133;what
		I mean is, I thought you were just being nice to me because you were going to ditch me,
		but now I know you weren&#146;t, and I&#133;it seemed like you were courting me.
		Like&#133;well, like a man would. And I never thought about&#133;that with a woman before,
		and I wasn&#146;t sure if I was right. Were you? Courting me, I mean?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. But that wasn&#146;t fair; it was my turn to ask the
		questions. Now don&#146;t think about these questions, just answer from your heart. Do you
		love me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," she answered without hesitation.</p>

		<p>"Are you in love with me?"</p>

		<p>"I don&#146;t know&#133;yes, I think so. How can I know? I
		was never in love before."</p>

		<p>"Do you find yourself attracted to me, sexually?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca took a deep breath and then let it out in a shudder.
		"Oh God, yes. But Josie I&#146;m afraid&#133; I don&#146;t know what you want from
		me. What if I can&#146;t&#133;what if I&#146;m not&#133;enough for you?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, Rebecca&#133;whatever you are, whatever you want to be,
		is enough for me. I want you to be happy. I would love nothing better than to make love
		with you for the rest of my life, but if all you want is to travel with me and be my
		friend, I can live with that. If anything happens between us, it will be because you say
		you want it to. I will never push you or try to make you do something you don&#146;t want
		to." She reached down and clasped Rebecca by her wrists and pulled her up to where
		she could place a kiss on her forehead. Then she whirled her around and sat her down on
		the edge of the bed facing the other side of the room, and at the same time she rose and
		unbuckled her belt and dropped her pants to the floor. "Don&#146;t turn around.
		I&#146;m naked," she said as she grabbed her longjohns from the back of a chair and
		quickly stepped into them. By the time Rebecca did turn around, Josie was slipping her
		arms into the sleeves and all but covered up. "I&#146;m going to blow out this candle
		now so you can get undressed. Unless you want to tease me by getting naked in front of
		me," Josie said with a raised eyebrow and a sly smile.</p>

		<p>"Blow it out," Rebecca said shyly. She really had
		wanted to see Josie stripped, and the thought of taking off her clothes in front of the
		gunslinger excited her more than she could say. But it was too soon. Her mind was whirling
		like a cyclone, and what she wanted kept getting hopelessly tangled with what she thought
		she should do. "Can we sleep on this tonight and talk about it again tomorrow?"
		She asked hopefully.</p>

		<p>Josie puffed out the candle, and returned to the bed. "Of
		course we can. Tomorrow will be a perfect day to talk about it," she said, knowing
		what surprises the next day would bring to the pretty little blonde. She vowed to stay on
		her side of the bed as much as possible, and to keep her hands to herself. When the time
		was right, she knew Rebecca would let her know.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="39: A Birthday to Remember">
		<p>Rebecca dreamed that she was a prisoner in the turret of a castle
		in a foreign land. She could not speak the language of the natives, and had no idea why
		she was being held, but she sensed that days had passed since she had been captured. She
		watched from the parapet as the people came and went in the courtyard below, but was too
		far away for her voice to be heard if she cried out. Her strength was ebbing from lack of
		food and water; it seemed she had been forgotten in her lonely tower. When she thought she
		could not hold on any longer, she saw a knight dressed in black ride into the courtyard on
		a golden steed. Her heart leapt with joy at the sight, as she knew this was her knight
		come to rescue her. With what little strength she had left, she called "Sir
		Knight!" and dropped her handkerchief over the parapet. The knight looked up as if he
		had heard her voice, and saw the handkerchief fluttering in the wind. He vaulted from the
		back of his horse and drawing his sword he fought his way through the castle guard. She
		could no longer see him, but she knew he was making his way toward her and that rescue was
		at hand. Even as that thought flitted through her mind, she heard the sound of swords
		clashing outside her door, and then silence. The bolt was thrown back, and the door was
		opened. The black knight stood outside the door as if awaiting her invitation to enter.
		She made a gesture to indicate he should enter, certain that he would not understand her
		language, and immediately he strode into the room. His chain mail was red with the blood
		of her captors but he was unhurt. She watched as he crossed the room to where she stood,
		but before he got there, her legs gave out and she started to crumple. In an instant the
		knight was there, his strong arms around her, gathering her up and holding her against his
		chest. Rebecca reached up and grasped the helmet that covered his head and tugged it off.
		Long black hair tumbled free, and Josie&#146;s piercing blue eyes were fixed on her own.
		The knight bent to press her lips gently against Rebecca&#146;s. "Oh,
		Josie&#133;" Rebecca murmured when Josie broke off the kiss, and her heart started to
		pound&#133;.</p>

		<p>"Yes sprite, I&#146;m here," Josie&#146;s voice said
		softly, but the dream knight&#146;s lips had not moved. Rebecca&#146;s dream self was
		still trying to figure out how the knight had accomplished that feat when Josie continued,
		"Wake up, Mary Sunshine. It&#146;s your birthday."</p>

		<p>Rebecca tried to pull the voice into the dream, but the smell of
		something cooking contributed to the allure of the waking reality. She opened her eyes to
		see the gunslinger sitting on the side of the bed holding a tray laden down with food.
		There was a mountain of crisp bacon, fried eggs, biscuits, a cup of coffee and a glass of
		orange juice. A vase full of bright flowers stood on a corner of the tray. Rebecca&#146;s
		mouth dropped open in surprise and she simply stared. She thought of pinching herself to
		see if she had just moved from one dream into another, when a very real Josie leaned over
		and kissed her forehead.</p>

		<p>"Breakfast in bed for the birthday girl," she said
		brightly. "Now sit up higher so I can fit this tray over your lap." Rebecca did
		as she asked and Josie put the sumptuous breakfast in front of her. Rebecca just continued
		to stare first at the food and then at Josie, and the gunslinger laughed. The facial
		expressions alone made Josie determined to surprise the pretty blonde more often.</p>

		<p>When Rebecca finally found her voice she asked incredulously,
		"You didn&#146;t make this, did you?"</p>

		<p>"God no. You don&#146;t think I&#146;d do that to you on
		your birthday, do you? Charles and Horace made it."</p>

		<p>"Horace?" Rebecca asked around a mouthful of food.</p>

		<p>"Charles&#146; brother. He got here this morning bright and
		early. We got tired of waiting for you to grace us with your presence, and I figured the
		smell of food would do the trick. Worked, too. Oh, by the way, what were you dreaming
		about when I came in? You called out my name and I thought for a moment you had seen me,
		but you were still sound asleep."</p>

		<p>Rebecca&#146;s cheeks flushed a bright red as she remembered her
		dream about the dashing knight. "I don&#146;t remember," she lied softly, and
		Josie raised her eyebrow and looked at her questioningly. "All right, well&#133;I was
		locked up in a castle and you were dressed as a knight and came to rescue me. Happy
		now?"</p>

		<p>"Not as happy as that knight was, I think," she answered, causing Rebecca&#146;s
		checks to color again. "Mmm, that must have been some dream," Josie said with a
		wicked grin.</p>

		<p>Rebecca slapped Josie playfully on the arm. "Stop it,"
		she said.</p>

		<p>"As you wish, m&#146;lady," Josie said bowing from the
		waist. "Sorry," she said in response to the glare she got from Rebecca, who was
		too busy eating to take time for a verbal retort. Josie got up from the bed and pulled the
		curtains to allow the morning sun to stream into the room. It was then that Rebecca
		noticed the bathtub in the corner. Josie followed her eyes and said, "I know how much
		you enjoy soaking in a hot tub. I&#146;ve already got water heating, and you can stay in
		there until you turn into a human pickle. After that&#133;well, we have plenty of
		surprises for you after that."</p>

		<p>"But I have chores to do&#133;" Rebecca started, and
		Josie cut her off.</p>

		<p>"Not today, you don&#146;t. It&#146;s your birthday, and the
		only thing you have to do today is enjoy yourself." Tears brimmed in Rebecca&#146;s
		eyes, and her lip trembled. Josie rushed to the side of the bed and took her hand.
		"Didn&#146;t anyone ever do anything special for you on your birthday?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca shook her head. "Pa didn&#146;t believe in such
		foolishness, and Mother would never do anything against his wishes."</p>

		<p>"Your father is one hard-hearted son-of-a-bitch," Josie
		hissed. She promised herself again that if she ever met up with the man she would make
		sure he got to experience a taste of the agony his daughter had suffered at his hands. But
		she smiled to lighten the mood and added, "Well, we&#146;ll just have to make it even
		more special to make up for it. How many birthdays will it be we&#146;re making up
		for?"</p>

		<p>"Twenty."</p>

		<p>Josie&#146;s eyes widened in surprise. "Really? I would have
		said you were maybe seventeen, eighteen. Why, you&#146;re practically an old maid,"
		she said with a light laugh.</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunter, if this is the way you make me feel special I
		have to say it needs work," Rebecca grumbled, but she was barely hiding a smile.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, sprite. I&#146;ll try harder. Now finish up your
		breakfast so we can get a start on the celebration." Rebecca sopped up the last of
		her egg-yolk with a bit of biscuit and popped it in her mouth. She gulped the coffee,
		which thankfully was not so hot any longer that it would burn her mouth. She chased that
		down with the rest of the orange juice, and then gave a satisfied burp.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me," she said, covering her mouth with her
		hand. "Guess that was about the best breakfast I ever had in my life."</p>

		<p>"You ain&#146;t seen nothin&#146; yet. I&#146;m going to go
		get the hot water; be right back." Rebecca nodded, and climbing out of bed she began
		to unfasten the buttons of her nightgown.</p>

		<p>Josie was back and forth several times with buckets full of
		steaming water until it seemed to Rebecca that the tub was full enough. Josie then pulled
		a vial out of her pocket and she poured the contents into the water and swirled it around
		with her hand. A light lavender scent filled the air, and bubbles blossomed on top of the
		water. She inhaled the heady aroma and for a moment wished that it was she who would be
		climbing in the tub. But then she imagined the way Rebecca&#146;s skin would feel, warm
		from the bath and lavender scented, and she was glad it was the other way around.
		"Your bath awaits you, m&#146;lady."</p>

		<p>Rebecca had removed her nightgown, and stood with it demurely
		held in front of her body. "Turn around," she said softly, and Josie did. A
		light splash told the gunslinger that Rebecca was in the bath, and she turned back to see
		just her head and shoulders above the water. "Perfect," Rebecca said with a
		sigh. "Oh Josie, thank you. This feels marvelous."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m glad you&#146;re enjoying it. I&#146;ve got a few
		more things I need to take care of, so you just sing out when you need some more hot
		water, or if you want me to wash your back." Reluctantly she pulled her eyes away
		from the vision floating in the water and started for the door. She would have loved to
		stay and just watch her bathe, but she knew it would embarrass Rebecca.</p>

		<p>Josie was helping the two brothers drape colorful ribbon on the
		walls just beneath the ceiling when she heard Rebecca call out for her. "Be back
		shortly, boys," she said with a smile. Since neither of them could reach as high as
		she could, she suggested they go pick some more flowers until she was able to continue
		with the ribbon. They happily agreed, and the two men darted out the door like schoolboys
		when recess is called.</p>

		<p>Josie knocked lightly on the bedroom door, and Rebecca said
		"Enter." When she walked in Rebecca opened her eyes and looked up at her; she
		had been nearly dozing in the warm water. "Could you bring me more hot water, please?
		It&#146;s starting to cool off."</p>

		<p>"Your wish is my command," she replied with a smile.
		"But I&#146;ll need to bail out some of this water first so there will be room."
		She picked up a bucket and dipped it in the tub and then did the same with the second
		bucket. The water level had dropped so that it was not quite covering Rebecca&#146;s
		breasts, and Josie&#146;s eyes were drawn to the creamy orbs. Josie&#146;s sharp intake of
		breath made Rebecca notice what she was looking at, and she almost responded by covering
		her chest with her washcloth. But sometime between their conversation the previous night
		and that morning when she stepped in the tub something had finally fallen into place in
		her mind. And she realized that she wanted Josie to look at her and to desire her, in the
		same way that she desired Josie. Starting now, she thought to herself, no more covering
		up, no more undressing in the dark.</p>

		<p>"And when you come back with the water, I&#146;d love it if
		you&#146;d wash my back," she said blushing just a little in spite of her new resolve
		to stop hiding herself from Josie. A lifetime of modesty was not easily overcome.</p>

		<p>"Water&#146;s on the stove. I&#146;ll be back in a few
		minutes." Josie retreated with the buckets and true to her word was back within five
		minutes with two steaming buckets of water. She carefully spread each bucket full evenly
		in the water to avoid burning Rebecca, and then took the washcloth from her hands and
		knelt behind the tub. "Lean forward a little," she said softly, and Rebecca
		complied, wrapping her arms around her knees. Josie soaped the cloth with the sweet
		smelling French soap she had Horace buy for her in town along with the bubble bath and a
		few other surprises Rebecca had not yet seen. She rubbed the cloth gently over the planes
		of Rebecca&#146;s back and shoulders, resisting the impulse to reach around and caress her
		breasts.</p>

		<p>"You can scrub harder than that," Rebecca said, turning
		so that Josie could see her profile, "I&#146;m not made of glass." Josie
		chuckled. She really was treating Rebecca as if she were a priceless porcelain figurine,
		but now she bore down a bit harder with the cloth. "Ohhhh, that feels so good,"
		Rebecca said with a sigh. "I could stay here all day."</p>

		<p>"Ah, but then you&#146;d miss all the other surprises we
		have for your birthday."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie, this is too much already&#133;I feel like a
		pampered princess."</p>

		<p>"There&#146;s no such thing as too much; not on your
		birthday. Now, why don&#146;t you get up on your knees so I can reach the lower part of
		your back?" Rebecca hesitated only a moment before shifting around in the tub to get
		her knees under her and rising up. Her hips were completely out of the water, as well as
		the rounded globes of her behind. Josie&#146;s breath caught in her throat and she
		swallowed hard several times before she reached out to continue washing her beautiful
		friend. She ran the cloth over her hips and down both sides, and then over the soft
		mounds. Rebecca gasped slightly when the cloth parted the smooth cheeks. "Is this all
		right? Should I stop?" Josie asked in a husky voice.</p>

		<p>"It&#146;s&#133;fine. No, please don&#146;t stop."
		Josie didn&#146;t fail to notice the expectant quiver in Rebecca&#146;s voice. She resumed
		her ministrations, paying special attention to the fleshy mounds. When it seemed that she
		must go further or go mad she finally stopped and took a step back from the tub.</p>

		<p>"Would you like me to wash your hair for you?"</p>

		<p>"I&#133;uh&#133;yes," Rebecca answered, sinking back
		into the concealing bubbles. She tilted her head back as far as she could without totally
		immersing herself and then sat up. Josie remembered Rebecca&#146;s fear of putting her
		head underwater and determined to be especially careful this time. She worked the French
		soap into a lather with her hands and then applied it to the golden tresses. She kneaded
		her scalp with her strong fingers, and watched as Rebecca&#146;s eyes fluttered shut.
		Josie wanted to kiss her eyelids, her nose, her lips. Never in her life had she so desired
		anything as much as she desired this woman. The love she felt for Genie seemed almost
		sisterly by comparison, and she would never have believed that was possible.</p>

		<p>"We need to rinse you off now," Josie said, and Rebecca
		nodded without opening her eyes. "I&#146;m going to tip your head back and rinse off
		most of it in the tub. Then I&#146;ll get some fresh water to finish with. Ready?"
		Rebecca nodded again, and Josie lowered her head until just her face was out of the water.
		She rinsed as best she could and then sat her up in the tub. "OK, relax a minute.
		I&#146;ll be right back." Rebecca watched the tall woman walk out of the room, and
		the moment the door was closed she expelled the breath she did not realize she had been
		holding.</p>

		<p>"Oh, God," she said through clenched teeth.
		"Josie, what you do to me&#133;" she murmured just as Josie came back in the
		room.</p>

		<p>"What was that? Did you want something?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. No. Yes&#133;but later." Josie smiled and raised
		her eyebrow in a way that Rebecca found completely disarming. The little blonde blushed,
		and Josie found herself thinking she would never get through this day without making love
		with her.</p>

		<p>"Stand up now so I can pour this water over you."
		Rebecca did as she asked, fighting her natural impulse to shield her private parts from
		view. She could tell by the look on Josie&#146;s face that the tall woman was thoroughly
		enjoying the display of flesh before her. She stood for several moments until her wet skin
		began to shiver in the morning chill.</p>

		<p>"Uh, Josie. I&#146;m freezing," she said through
		chattering teeth.</p>

		<p>"Oh, baby I&#146;m sorry," Josie said as she snapped
		out of her reverie. "Shut your eyes," she ordered, and as soon as Rebecca did,
		she poured one bucket of warm water over her. "One more&#133;don&#146;t move,"
		she added as she upended the second bucket over her head, making sure all the soap was
		gone from her hair. "OK, I&#146;m getting the towel now. You can open your
		eyes." Josie fetched the towel from the washstand and wrapped it around the slender
		body, rubbing against the towel to help dry her. "Let me help you out of the
		tub," she said, putting one hand behind her shoulders and the other against the back
		of her thighs and effortlessly scooping her out of the tub. She stood for a moment with
		Rebecca in her arms, just breathing in the exotic scent of her, then reluctantly she set
		her on her feet. "I almost forgot&#133;I brought another towel for your hair."
		She fetched the second towel and wrapped it around the golden hair, twisting it up on top
		of Rebecca&#146;s head. The smaller woman was completely amazed; the extravagance of two
		towels for one bath was something she had never heard of.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Josie. You&#146;re just&#133;the sweetest person
		I&#146;ve ever known."</p>

		<p>"And so are you," Josie said sincerely. "I&#146;m
		going to go help Charles and Horace finish up out there and let you get dressed.
		There&#146;s something in the dresser for you to put on. Come on out when you&#146;re
		ready." She kissed Rebecca lightly on the lips and turned and strode from the room.</p>

		<p>When Josie had gone, Rebecca crossed to the dresser and opened
		the door. Hanging inside was a gingham dress the color of the summer sky with white
		tatting around the collar and sleeves. The buttons looked like pearls, and a blue silk
		scarf peeked out of a pocket above the left breast. White shoes that looked like they were
		made of soft kidskin sat in the bottom of the closet. Rebecca&#146;s mouth dropped open as
		she looked at these beautiful items, and tears began to course down her cheeks. "Oh
		Josie&#133;" she murmured as she gulped down her tears.</p>

		<p>Josie inspected the room again just to make sure everything met
		with her approval. The walls were gaily draped in multi-colored ribbons and every
		available surface space had a vase or bowl full of flowers. In the center of the dining
		table was a cake, slightly off center from the trip from town, but Josie had put it back
		together so that it looked almost as good as new. It was covered with white butter
		frosting and decorated with pink flowers and green vines. "Happy Birthday
		Rebecca" was written in pink frosting across it. Horace had come through like a
		champ; he had fetched everything she had asked for, and a little extra besides. It had not
		occurred to her to serve Rebecca breakfast in bed until Horace produced a rasher of fresh
		bacon and told her he could whip up a mean biscuit.</p>

		<p>"Calm down, gal," Charles admonished her.
		"You&#146;re gonna wear a hole in my floor with all your pacin&#146;. She&#146;ll be
		out directly."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I know, I just&#133;."</p>

		<p>"Sit," he said sharply, cutting her off in mid
		sentence. So shocked was she to be given an order from him that she simply sat. "Deal
		her in," he said to his brother who was shuffling the cards for a new hand of poker.
		She picked up the cards and arranged them without truly seeing what they were, and almost
		threw away a natural straight.</p>

		<p>"How many do you want," Horace asked.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll play these." At that moment the bedroom door
		opened, and Rebecca emerged, her eyes taking in the transformation the room had undergone
		and growing wider by the second. She was a vision in the blue dress and all three people
		at the table gaped at her, none more than Josie. Embarrassed to be the object of so much
		attention, she shyly glanced toward the floor.</p>

		<p>Josie tossed in her hand of cards and rose to greet her. Both men
		stood up also, as gentlemen should when a lady enters a room. Josie walked to her and took
		both of her hands in her own, and leaning forward she placed a kiss on each cheek. She
		paused for a moment before she straightened up and whispered in her ear, "You are
		breathtakingly beautiful, Rebecca. I hope you won&#146;t mind if I stare at you all
		day."</p>

		<p>"Josie I&#133;I don&#146;t know what to say&#133;."</p>

		<p>"Say that you love me," Josie whispered so softly that
		only Rebecca could hear.</p>

		<p>"I love you," she whispered back. Josie smiled from ear
		to ear and took Rebecca&#146;s hand to present her to Horace.</p>

		<p>"Horace, this is my dearest friend, Rebecca&#133;"</p>

		<p>Horace took Rebecca&#146;s hand in his and lightly kissed it.
		"Purely pleasured to meetcha, little gal. To hear these two talk, I was expecting to
		see wings and a halo on you. But you look plumb pretty even without &#145;em. Oh, and
		happy birthday," he added almost as an afterthought.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Horace," she said dropping a little curtsy.
		"I heard so much about you from Charles, I felt like I knew you already."</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t be hoggin&#146; the pretty gal&#146;s all to
		yourself, you old fool," Charles said jokingly as he elbowed past Horace to take
		Rebecca&#146;s hand and kiss it as well. Rebecca laughed as the two old men took
		good-natured pot shots at each other. She also noticed that Charles was wearing his
		Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes, and had his hair neatly combed instead of flying off in all
		directions as usual.</p>

		<p>"You&#146;re pretty spruced up yourself, Charles. You could
		sure turn a girl&#146;s head."</p>

		<p>"Ain&#146;t I just? Your big tall friend over there
		wouldn&#146;t have it but that we all had to get dressed up like the President hisself was
		coming to call." He winked at Josie, and Rebecca knew that it was at least as much
		his idea as hers. Clearly both brothers were enjoying having a woman to fuss over again.
		They pulled out a chair for her and had her sit at the table. It was then that she noticed
		the cake with her name on it, and her eyes widened in surprise and her mouth opened in a
		big "O."</p>

		<p>"Hurry up and give her your&#133;you know," Josie said
		with a nod in the direction of the kitchen where Charles and Horace had stashed their
		gifts for her. "I want to see her open them, and I need to get cleaned up
		myself."</p>

		<p>"Keep your drawers on," Charles muttered, but he did
		walk briskly to the kitchen and return a few moments later with two bundles wrapped in
		brown paper. "Sorry I didn&#146;t have no fancy wrappin&#146; paper, but I guess
		it&#146;s what&#146;s inside that counts." He laid the two bundles in front of the
		astounded woman, who simply sat and stared at them. "Well, open &#145;em up,
		f&#146;gosh sakes. They ain&#146;t gonna open themselves. This one first; it&#146;s from
		me."</p>

		<p>Rebecca carefully peeled back the layer of brown paper on the
		first package, and gasped in surprise when she saw "Little Women", by Louisa May
		Alcott. "Oh, Charles! I love it! I&#146;ve wanted to read this book ever since I saw
		it in the mercantile in Chancetown!" She threw her arms around his neck and hugged
		him until his face turned bright red from embarrassment.</p>

		<p>"Open the other one," Horace said brightly. Rebecca
		could scarcely believe what was happening to her that morning, and all because it was the
		anniversary of her birth. She untied the string holding the paper on the other package to
		reveal a small wooden box with an intricate design carved in the top. Imbedded between the
		designs were brightly colored pieces of mother-of-pearl. She lifted the lid on the box,
		and within she saw gears and springs. Even as she looked, the gears started to turn and
		she heard the strains of "Beautiful Dreamer" coming from the box.</p>

		<p>"Horace, I&#133;this is so beautiful. How can I thank you?
		I&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Oh, don&#146;t thank me. All I did was fetch it. Josie is
		the one that asked me to pick it up. This is from me." Horace reached into his pocket
		and pulled out a flat parcel and placed it in her hand. Rebecca unwrapped it without
		taking her eyes off Josie. It contained a handkerchief with an "R" daintily
		embroidered in one corner. The edges were scalloped with the same tatting that decorated
		the dress; clearly both items came from the same seamstress.</p>

		<p>Rebecca hugged Horace and kissed him on the cheek. "This is
		beautiful also. You have excellent taste in handkerchiefs as well as music boxes."
		Horace beamed at her and puffed out his chest like a little banty rooster. Rebecca tucked
		the handkerchief in her pocket and stood up. She walked to where Josie leaned against the
		bedroom doorjamb her arms crossed over her chest, and came to a stop in front of her. A
		sheen of moisture glistened in Rebecca&#146;s eyes as she stood on tiptoe and placed a
		kiss on Josie&#146;s lips. The gunslinger&#146;s breath caught in her throat, and she felt
		a jolt that reached to the very core of her. "How did you&#133;" Rebecca began,
		but Josie stopped her with a finger to her lips.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll tell you everything later. Right now, just enjoy.
		Read your new book, or play games with the old codgers&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Hey, I heard that! Old codgers, indeed," Horace
		grumbled.</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, and remember, Horace&#146;s hearing is much better
		than Charles&#146;." She smiled at Charles, who stuck out his tongue at her.
		"I&#146;m going to go clean up a bit myself. Be back soon. And no work &#150;
		don&#146;t you lift a finger today, you understand me? We&#146;ll take care of
		everything."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma&#146;am," Rebecca said, giving her a little
		salute. She walked back to the table with a huge grin on her face. "Get out the beans
		and deal the cards, boys. We&#146;re playing poker!"</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Almost an hour later the door to the bedroom opened and Josie
		emerged. The trio at the table heard her splashing and even singing snatches from songs
		now and then, but they were so wrapped up in their playing they failed to notice how much
		time had passed. Rebecca looked up when the door opened, and did a double take when she
		saw the beautiful woman standing there. Her cards and the other people in the room
		forgotten, Rebecca stared openly at Josie. This was the first time she had seen her in
		anything but her longjohns or her customary black shirt and pants. She wore a blue satin
		looking shirt with the top several snaps unfastened to reveal more cleavage than would be
		considered proper. Instead of her bandanna, she had a white silk scarf tied around her
		neck. Her pants were blue denim, tucked into her cleaned and polished boots. She wore her
		hair in a long braid down her back with a thong of leather braided into it. A hawk feather
		was attached to the leather thong and hung beside her right ear. Rebecca had never seen
		anyone more stunning. Her heart was hammering in her chest, and she found that she was
		holding her breath. She let it out in a rush.</p>

		<p>"You clean up real good for a roofer," Charles said
		appreciatively. Horace nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "Thanks, old man. You sure know how to
		disguise a complement. And you&#146;re awfully quiet there, Rebecca. What do you think?
		The duds suit me?"</p>

		<p>"I-I&#133;oh," she swallowed and took a deep breath and
		started again. "My God Josie, you-you take my breath away."</p>

		<p>"Well, Horace I&#146;d say you did pretty damned well with
		what little I gave you to work with." She grasped his hand and shook it vigorously,
		and then pulled him into her arms and gave him a solid hug. "Thank you&#133;both of
		you, for making Rebecca&#146;s birthday so special. We&#146;ll never forget this
		day."</p>

		<p>"Never," Rebecca agreed.</p>

		<p>"Now if you boys can do without this pretty little gal for a
		while, I&#146;d like to take her for a walk. Would you do me the honor, Rebecca?" She
		bowed and held out her hand, and Rebecca placed hers in it and allowed Josie to pull her
		to her feet.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;d be delighted," she said sincerely.</p>

		<p>"Be back by noon time, ladies. Horace has a real special
		meal planned."</p>

		<p>"We wouldn&#146;t miss it," Josie said breezily as they
		sailed out the door. It was a beautiful fall morning, the colors on the trees a hundred
		shades of red and orange and gold. Soon they would be dropping, but at that moment they
		were surrounded by a riot of fall colors. Hand in hand they walked past the flower garden,
		now nearly bare both from the shortening days and from the regular picking that had been
		going on for the past week. Josie led Rebecca into the work shed where she had been
		toiling on the totem, and sat her down on a stool. "Close your eyes," she said,
		and Rebecca did ask she asked. "Now hold out your hands." When she did, Josie
		placed an object in her hands she could not identify by touch. "Open your eyes."</p>

		<p>The object she held was a totem, but it was unlike any she had
		seen in books. Just over a foot long and about two inches around, at the base stood a
		bear, and on its shoulders was a wolf. On the back of the wolf stood two women. They were
		entwined so that you could not readily see where one began and the other left off. One was
		considerably taller, her long hair flowing over her shoulders. The smaller one nestled
		against the tall one, but she did not appear to be diminutive despite her smaller size.
		Atop the totem was a phoenix, its wings spread to enclose the two women, keeping them
		safe. The piece was stained a rich red-brown, and was sanded as smooth as glass. Rebecca
		did not realize she was crying until a tear splashed on the totem and brought her back to
		the moment. She put her arms around Josie&#146;s neck still clutching the totem tightly in
		her hand, and for several moments she stayed that way, unable to speak, tears coursing
		down her cheeks.</p>

		<p>"I love you," Josie whispered as she lowered her head
		and buried her face in the warm fragrance of Rebecca&#146;s hair.</p>

		<p>"And I love you&#133;with all of my being." She pulled
		away from Josie so that she could look into her face, cradling the totem against her
		chest. "And this is the most beautiful thing anybody has ever done for me. I will
		cherish it for as long as I live." She raised up on her tiptoes and touched her lips
		lightly to Josie&#146;s, and felt an unmistakable quiver in the lips that returned her
		soft kiss.</p>

		<p>"Do you? I was afraid to hope&#133;"</p>

		<p>"So was I. If only we had talked like this long ago."</p>

		<p>Josie shrugged. "Things happen when they&#146;re meant to.
		We might have said the wrong things and ruined whatever chance we had." She wrapped
		her arms around Rebecca&#146;s waist and pulled the smaller woman close to her, their
		bodies tingling at each point of contact. "I want to make love with you," Josie
		said huskily. "I want to touch and taste you, to memorize every inch of you with my
		eyes."</p>

		<p>Rebecca&#146;s breath caught in her throat and an intense stab of
		desire that pierced her center and radiated outward rocked her, causing her knees to
		threaten to buckle. She pressed her body even closer to Josie&#146;s and allowed the
		taller woman to hold her up, delighting in the feel of her warm flesh even through the
		layers of clothes that separated them. "I hope I don&#146;t&#133;disappoint
		you," she said softly, her lips only a breath removed from the tantalizing V of
		Josie&#146;s shirt. When Josie inhaled Rebecca felt the softness of her breast touch her
		lips and cheek, and she kissed the smooth flesh. She knew she had never felt anything more
		soft and at the same time exciting.</p>

		<p>"Ohhh," Josie sighed, burying her fingers in the golden
		tresses and tilting Rebecca&#146;s head back until she was looking into her eyes.
		"You couldn&#146;t possibly disappoint me. The mere touch of your lips is enough to
		make me lightheaded. Anything more than that will be pure heaven."</p>

		<p>Emboldened by those words, Rebecca put her hand on the back of
		Josie&#146;s head and brought Josie&#146;s lips down to where she could reach without
		standing on her toes. She kissed the gunslinger more passionately than she had the first
		time, and felt Josie&#146;s lips parting slightly. Rebecca had never participated in such
		a kiss and was uncertain what to do next. The gunslinger, sensing her hesitation, took the
		lead and played her tongue along Rebecca&#146;s lips until they parted, which Josie took
		as an invitation to explore. Rebecca&#146;s tongue met her own, shyly at first and then
		more forcefully. Josie clasped the smaller woman&#146;s body tightly to her own, and felt
		Rebecca&#146;s moan as a tremble against her lips.</p>

		<p>Josie wanted nothing more than to tear the clothes from
		Rebecca&#146;s body and make love to her then and there, but common sense told her they
		were in a dirty work shed in the middle of a day of celebration. Not only did she not want
		their first time to be in such surroundings, but also there was the possibility that the
		brothers would come looking for them if they were gone too long, and she did not want to
		be interrupted. When they made love for the first time it had to be perfect&#133;or as
		close to perfect as Josie had the power to make it. She broke off the kiss and pulled back
		slightly, reluctant to completely release the warm, soft body in her arms. "We have
		to stop&#133;" Rebecca&#146;s look of disappointment pierced her and she paused
		momentarily, then continued, "Oh, please don&#146;t look at me like that. You must
		know that I am dying inside from wanting you. It&#146;s just&#133;this isn&#146;t the time
		or the place. Later tonight in our room I promise we&#146;ll make up for lost time."
		She kissed her again lightly on the lips and whispered into her ear, "It&#146;ll be
		worth waiting for&#133;I guarantee it."</p>

		<p>The sound of Josie&#146;s honeyed voice and the promise it
		carried made Rebecca weak. Never had she felt such emotional highs and physical
		stimulation. Her mind was on overload trying to sort all the new feelings. She knew only
		one thing with certainty; she had never wanted anything in her life as badly as she wanted
		Josie. Before reluctantly pulling her body away from Josie&#146;s, Rebecca kissed her
		back, and briefly darted her tongue inside the outlaw&#146;s mouth, and then quickly
		backed away. Josie groaned when Rebecca said softly, "That&#146;s so you don&#146;t
		forget your promise." Hand in hand they emerged into the bright sunlight and returned
		to the house where their friends waited.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca sat in Charles&#146; most comfortable chair. Her feet
		rested on a pillow that was placed on a stool. She was not allowed to do any work at all,
		but was told to sit and relax and read her book. The three other inhabitants of the house
		revolved around her as if she were the sun, her slightest fancy answered by one of the
		three without hesitation. Horace cooked and Josie and Charles cleaned up, and any offer to
		help from Rebecca was stifled with a menacing look. When they sat down to supper, the two
		women barely picked at the generous spread of food in front of them, so preoccupied were
		they with thoughts of what the end of the day would hold. Every time their eyes would meet
		across the table, they would quickly lower their gaze, certain that the men would be able
		to tell what was in their minds from the looks on their faces.</p>

		<p>When the meal was finally finished and the dishes washed and put
		away, the last of Rebecca&#146;s surprises was presented to her. Charles and Horace
		rummaged in a closet and brought out a fiddle and an accordion, and with Rebecca once
		again deposited in Charles&#146; favorite chair, the two men began to play. Josie sat on
		the arm of the chair, her thigh touching Rebecca&#146;s arm, the graceful curve of her hip
		pressed against Rebecca&#146;s shoulder. Rebecca was thrilled by the touch and delighted
		by the music, unable to decide what gave her greater pleasure. The old men played a lot of
		old songs that neither of the women knew by heart, but when a familiar melody started they
		both sang along at the top of their lungs. Rebecca had never heard Josie sing before, and
		her rich alto voice was like warm honey pouring over Rebecca, causing her to tingle all
		over.</p>

		<p>"This here&#146;s dancin&#146; music," Charles said as
		they began to play a lively tune. "You gals get on up and dance; shame to waste the
		music just because there ain&#146;t no fellers around."</p>

		<p>Josie glanced down at Rebecca, who shook her head and shrugged.
		"I&#133;never learned to dance," she admitted ruefully.</p>

		<p>"Doesn&#146;t matter. I&#146;ll teach you," Josie said
		standing up and holding out her hand for Rebecca. The younger woman shook her head again,
		but when Josie gave her an imploring look, she put her hand in Josie&#146;s and allowed
		herself to be pulled to her feet. Josie took Rebecca&#146;s left hand in hers and placed
		her left hand in the small of Rebecca&#146;s back. "Put your other hand on my
		shoulder," she instructed, and Rebecca did as she asked. "Now when I press on
		your back like this," she demonstrated, "It means I&#146;m going to turn you,
		like so." She executed a neat half turn, and Rebecca managed to stay with her.
		"Good. Now when I do this," and she pressed a different way on Rebecca&#146;s
		back, "It means I am going to lead off with my right foot, so you go back or forward
		with your left foot depending on which way I&#146;m turning you. Got that?"</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca said with a laugh. "But I&#146;ll
		try to keep up."</p>

		<p>"OK, here we go. One, two, three." The next thing
		Rebecca knew, they were whirling around the room, and to her utter amazement, she was able
		to follow the subtle motions Josie made with a minimum of toe stomping. By the end of the
		song she was following almost flawlessly, and Josie began to throw in a few new moves such
		as dipping Rebecca almost to the floor and then pulling her back into her arms. They were
		both breathless when the song ended, not entirely due to the exertion of the dance.
		Charles and Horace launched into a song with a similar beat, and without even catching
		their breath the women were whirling around the floor again, smiles wreathing their faces.</p>

		<p>When that song ended, Josie gave Charles a little nod, and
		Charles tapped Horace with his bow. They began playing a slow ballad that Rebecca was not
		familiar with, and as Josie pulled her closer to her body she whispered in her ear,
		"I hope you like this song. I heard it somewhere along the line, and it makes me
		think of you." And as she slowly moved Rebecca around the room in time to the music
		she began to sing.</p>

		<p>Believe me if all those endearing young charms</p>

		<p>Which I gaze on so fondly today</p>

		<p>Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms</p>

		<p>Like fairy gifts fading away</p>

		<p>Thou would still be adored</p>

		<p>As this moment thou art</p>

		<p>Let thy loveliness fade as it will</p>

		<p>And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart</p>

		<p>Will entwine itself verdantly still.</p>

		<p>It is not while beauty and youth are thine own</p>

		<p>And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear</p>

		<p>That the fervor and faith of a soul shall be known</p>

		<p>To which time has but made thee more dear</p>

		<p>For the heart that has truly loved never forgets</p>

		<p>But as truly loves on to the close</p>

		<p>As the sunflower turns on her God when He sets</p>

		<p>The same look that she gave when He rose.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>As the music came to an end and Josie&#146;s voice grew silent,
		the two women came to a stop in the middle of the room. Josie&#146;s arms still held
		Rebecca tightly, for which the smaller woman was grateful, as she was not certain she
		could trust her legs to hold her up without assistance. She looked up at Josie and the
		sheen of tears that sparkled in her eyes tugged at the gunslinger&#146;s heart. Not
		trusting herself to speak, nor wishing to be overheard by the brothers, Rebecca mouthed
		the words "I love you," and then lightly touched her lips to Josie&#146;s cheek.</p>

		<p>"And I love you," Josie whispered back, and then added
		conspiratorially, "Why don&#146;t we excuse ourselves from this party?" She
		didn&#146;t need to add that the unfinished business of that afternoon had been on her
		mind so much that day that she was not certain how she was able to get through the hours
		without dragging the little blonde away and ravishing her. That message was conveyed quite
		clearly in the ardent glow in her eyes. Rebecca nodded shyly and lowered her gaze; her
		cheeks suffused with a bright pink that left no misunderstanding as to her own desires.</p>

		<p>Charles and Horace had already launched themselves into another
		spirited song, and hadn&#146;t even noticed that the women did not start to dance. Josie
		waved to catch Charles&#146; eye and he lifted his bow from the old fiddle and once again
		tapped his brother to get his attention. Josie smiled as she walked to where they sat, and
		then she thought perhaps a yawn might be in order so she stretched and yawned as she said,
		"We&#146;re pretty tuckered out after all the excitement today. Think we&#146;re
		going to turn in early."</p>

		<p>"Shucks. We was just gettin&#146; warmed up. Sure you
		can&#146;t do a few more jigs?"</p>

		<p>Taking her cue from the gunslinger, Rebecca scrubbed at her eyes
		with her knuckles and tried her best to yawn. "You boys wore us out with all that
		dancing. I can hardly keep my eyes open."</p>

		<p>"Well&#133;we&#146;d sure like to keep playing, unless you
		ladies think the noise will keep you awake," Horace said.</p>

		<p>"We could go out on the porch and play," Charles added.
		"Shouldn&#146;t be too loud from out there."</p>

		<p>"Oh, there&#146;s no need to&#133;" Rebecca began, and
		Josie cut her off quickly.</p>

		<p>"Out on the porch. That&#146;d be good," she said
		emphatically. Rebecca looked at her quizzically, and Josie tried her best to convey that
		Rebecca should simply trust her, she knew what she was doing.</p>

		<p>"Maybe that would be best. Josie hates to miss her
		sleep."</p>

		<p>"Right, then," Charles said rising from his chair and
		tapping his brother on the shoulder. "Come on, old fool. Let&#146;s us leave these
		beautiful ladies to their selves." The old men shuffled out, closing the door quietly
		behind them. A moment later the strains of "Tenting on the Old Camp Ground"
		wafted through the window. Satisfied that they would be out there for some time and that
		the music would mask any unusual sounds that might come from their room, Josie took
		Rebecca by the elbow and together they walked toward their future.</p>
		<hr/>

		<p>Josie struck a match and lit the wicks on the candles on the
		bedside table and wash stand. She turned around to find Rebecca standing by the bureau,
		her hands exploring the smooth contours of the totem she had placed there earlier in the
		day. The gunslinger walked up behind her and with a gentle nudge of her hands turned
		Rebecca around to face her, their bodies scant inches apart. With a slowness that was
		agonizing to both of them, she pulled the young woman's hips to her, the contact shocking
		each of them with its intensity. No words were spoken as the gunslinger lowered her mouth
		closer and closer to Rebecca's lips. They played a dance with each other over and over,
		lips moving forward, then pulling back in hesitancy.</p>

		<p>"I love you so much," the gunslinger whispered with a
		tremble in her voice. "God, I&#146;m shaking like a leaf." The blood of desire
		rose within them,</p>

		<p>pushing their fears back bit by bit until at last there was no
		more doubt. They kissed again; their bodies pressed so closely together that each could
		feel the others heartbeat. Josie's tongue demanded entry to Rebecca&#146;s mouth as her
		grip around the young woman tightened. Rebecca gave up trying to focus and closed her eyes
		as the kiss deepened to a level never before experienced by the young woman. Only the
		outlaw's grip on her waist kept her up on her shaky legs. Each felt a pounding deep in her
		loins when they finally separated to catch their breath. Blue eyes locked with green as
		unspoken words were exchanged.</p>

		<p>Rebecca placed her hands on top of the stronger ones and pulled
		them</p>

		<p>gently away from her waist. Maintaining eye contact, she knelt in
		front of</p>

		<p>Josie. She let go of the outlaw's hands and with courage she
		didn&#146;t even know she possessed, she ran her hands up and down the length of the
		gunslinger's legs, following the cut of her britches. Josie groaned and placed her hands
		on Rebecca's shoulders when she felt the shy hands graze the inside of her thighs. Leaning
		in, the young woman nuzzled against Josie's right thigh while her hands were busy
		unbuckling Josie&#146;s leather belt. Rebecca leaned back and looked up at the outlaw in
		anticipation. A seductive smile played across Josie's lips as her hands moved to her belt.
		</p>

		<p>"Is this what you want?" The gunslinger teased gently
		as she fingered the</p>

		<p>buckle, slowly pushing the leather through. Rebecca swallowed and
		nodded mutely, her mouth suddenly dry. Both women were completely focused on Josie's hands
		as they slowly removed the belt, letting it drop to the floor. There would be no rushing
		tonight, no sudden moves. This would be a night of softness and slowness, the taking and
		giving of one's soul to another and receiving one in return. Josie reached for the button
		of her britches only to have smaller hands grasp her own.</p>

		<p>"I'll do it." Rebecca's voice was barely a whisper as
		her hands moved in</p>

		<p>and took over the task. Her hands followed the path of the
		britches as they made their way down the gunslinger's legs. Desire feeding strength into
		her legs, she rose to capture Josie's mouth with her own. Tongues danced and explored as
		they exchanged soft sighs of pleasure at the long awaited act. Josie's hands grasped at
		the young woman's dress, popping several buttons in her quest to pull her closer.</p>

		<p>The outlaw blazed a trail of kisses up Rebecca's jaw line before
		stopping</p>

		<p>just below the earlobe. "Rebecca..." Her warm breath
		tickled and excited as her hands moved between them to undo the remaining buttons on the
		dress. Josie's mouth moved down to capture her soft throat, marking it as her own. Rebecca
		helplessly groaned and leaned into her, unable to focus on anything except Josie&#146;s
		mouth on her throat, exciting her in a way she had never dreamed possible.</p>

		<p>Josie's mouth explored the newly revealed flesh as she lowered
		herself,</p>

		<p>undoing one button after another until the dress was open,
		loosely covering</p>

		<p>the young woman's breasts. Unable to take the anticipation,
		Rebecca removed her dress and camisole, exposing herself to the gunslinger's hungry gaze.
		Josie's mouth watered as her blue eyes drank in the delicious sight. The cool autumn night
		and the blonde's own passions caused her nipples to contract and point in a most inviting
		way. The gunslinger pressed her lips against Rebecca&#146;s firm abdomen, feeling her love
		quivering against her.</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;please." The sound of womanly desire burst
		forth for the first time</p>

		<p>from her lips. She buried her fingers into the raven hair and
		guided her up for a kiss that left them both breathless and weak-kneed. Josie reached
		behind and cupped Rebecca's firm rear while the young woman was busy trying to separate
		the gunslinger from her shirt and vest.</p>

		<p>Josie lifted her into her arms and carried her over to the bed,
		her left</p>

		<p>nipple hardening at the feel of the young woman's skin against
		it. She laid Rebecca down and placed herself half over, half next to her, their breasts
		touching. She pulled the small shoes off the young woman, letting them fall to the floor
		with the rest of the clothes. Pulling Rebecca back into her arms, Josie rolled until she
		was on her back, the pleasurable weight of her blonde lover on top. They kissed deeply,
		their tongues urging each other on as both women struggled to remove Rebecca's under
		drawers without breaking lip contact. As she moved her hips and Josie pushed down on the
		material, inch by inch of Rebecca's creamy flesh was revealed. Only when the outlaw
		couldn't reach down any further did they finally break their kiss, allowing her to finish
		pulling off the last of Rebecca's clothes. The orange candlelight reflected off the
		glistening moisture of her soft blonde curls as Josie rolled her onto her back. A few
		quick movements and both women were completely naked against each other.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;" The gunslinger's lips were inches away.
		"I want you." She gave</p>

		<p>her slow gentle kisses that made the young woman melt. A low moan
		escaped the blonde as she responded to the dizzying kisses. Josie pressed against her,
		sliding her right leg between Rebecca's. She made no attempt to go further, seeming
		content with the kisses. After what seemed an eternity of searching and exploring the
		younger woman's mouth, she lifted her head. "Rebecca&#133;" She brought her
		trembling hand up to stroke her cheek. Rebecca reached out and caught Josie's hand.
		Slowly, she brought it down to her left breast. The gunslinger moaned softly and caressed
		the soft mound, deliberately avoiding the nipple.</p>

		<p>Josie's voice was ragged as she brought her fingertips up to
		explore the</p>

		<p>softness of Rebecca's lips. "For so long...I've wanted this
		for so long." The words were lost in a sea of kisses. Josie's hand went to the breast
		it had touched earlier, this time with more authority. She squeezed gently, rubbing her
		thumb across the pebbly flesh. She felt Rebecca's nipple hardening beneath her touch. Her
		kisses became more urgent, demanding. She broke the kiss and gazed down at the breasts
		exposed to her. The hungry look in her eyes opened a flood between Rebecca's legs. With
		great gentleness, the gunslinger lay on top of her, using her elbows to help support her
		weight. Like a hungry kitten, Josie licked and sucked, causing Rebecca to moan and murmur
		in pleasure. Instinctually, the young woman put her fingers in the raven hair and pressed
		Josie's head down. The gunslinger responded by nibbling and biting her sensitive tit,
		causing Rebecca to cry out and grind her pelvis against Josie's leg.
		"Oh&#133;Josie&#133;" Rebecca knew this was what she wanted, what she had waited
		so</p>

		<p>long for. She needed this, needed Josie to make her a total
		woman. The activity on her nipple became more forceful in response to her increasing
		moans.</p>

		<p>Josie could feel the passion building. She turned her attention
		to the</p>

		<p>right breast for a few moments, lavishing it with the same
		treatment the other received, planting several soft kisses on it before continuing
		downward. She ran her tongue lightly over Rebecca's stomach, drawing more moans from the
		writhing blonde before returning to the creamy mounds of flesh.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;" Josie's voice was rough. "Tell
		me&#133;tell me what you want." She</p>

		<p>suckled the other breast while her thigh continued to rub against
		damp curls. Josie felt the hot moisture and knew that this was what her young love needed.
		She pressed firmly against Rebecca's mound, and was rewarded with another moan from the
		younger woman. Josie blazed a trail down Rebecca's body with her tongue, stopping to run
		the tip around an incredibly sensitive bellybutton before reaching the curly hair that
		covered the young woman's sex. Josie nuzzled the soft curls, relishing the feeling. The
		musky scent of her filled the gunslinger's nostrils as she slipped her tongue between the
		folds and licked up the juices that had formed. The sweet, salty taste made her hunger for
		more, but Josie didn't want to rush this. She wanted Rebecca, she wanted her bad, and
		tonight she would have her. Tonight Josie wanted to take this adored woman to new heights.
		She continued to lick the juices with her tongue, careful not to</p>

		<p>touch the swollen bundle of nerves. Rebecca's squirming
		increased.</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;please&#133;I want you&#133;I want to feel
		you&#133;oh God please..." Rebecca said</p>

		<p>desperately as she again arched her hips toward Josie. The young
		woman was in ecstasy. She had never felt this sensation before, never wanted to give
		herself completely to anyone. But, oh how she wanted this woman. She wanted everything her
		raven-haired lover could give. "I need to feel you&#133;inside me," she finally
		said, her green eyes locking with the blue of her friend, her mentor, and her lover. Josie
		stopped her oral assault and moved up until her lips were near Rebecca's ear. With
		exquisite slowness, Josie brought two fingers to rest just outside the coral opening.
		"I love you." The words whispered into the young woman's ear could have been
		screamed for their intensity and force. With that,</p>

		<p>Josie's fingers found their mark, quickly entering her young
		lover. Rebecca gasped at the slight pain, then moaned at the feeling of having her lover
		inside her body. Her hips moved slowly at first, keeping pace with Josie's gentle
		stroking. It wasn't long before her body took over, increasing the tempo, demanding longer
		and deeper with each thrust. Her cries of passion flowed over Josie, intoxicating her with
		the power she held. There was no doubt in her mind that Rebecca wanted&#133; no
		needed&#133; more.</p>

		<p>"Yes&#133;oh&#133;Josie&#133;" Rebecca's head was
		moving from side to side. She was</p>

		<p>completely lost in the throes of passion and didn't know how to
		ask for what she needed. "More&#133;" She was rewarded with a third finger
		sliding in and filling her up beyond words and feelings. She knew she couldn't last much
		longer. Josie felt it too. She slid her long body down and slipped her tongue between
		Rebecca's wet folds. She sucked, licked, and nibbled on the young woman's clit until she
		felt the rising crescendo approaching. She shoved her fingers hard into Rebecca, causing
		the younger woman to moan in her pleasure. Her focus was on what the gunslinger was doing
		between her legs, the soft tongue caressing her, the firm fingers thrusting in and out.
		Both women knew that she wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;come for me." Josie's hand was a blur as
		it entered and exited</p>

		<p>Rebecca's womb. She felt the spasms start around her fingers.</p>

		<p>"Come on&#133;give your Josie what she wants&#133;come
		on&#133;give it to me&#133;" Rebecca arched her back, forcing herself onto Josie's
		hand. Her hot tunnel gripped and</p>

		<p>released the fingers it held as she felt herself floating away on
		waves of</p>

		<p>ecstasy. "Oh God, Josie...Josie...OHHHHH!"</p>

		<p>"Shh, it's okay, I've got you." The gunslinger gently
		withdrew her</p>

		<p>fingers and pulled the young woman into a gentle embrace. "I
		love you, Sprite. I've got you and I'm never letting go." Still overcome by the force
		of her orgasm, Rebecca found herself completely overwhelmed by the gentle words and tender
		touches. She clung to Josie, who patiently continued to murmur endearments of love and
		devotion.</p>

		<p>Eventually Rebecca's pulse slowed back to a normal level and she
		focused on the warm, lean body pressed against her. Her left hand slowly moved down
		Josie's side, curving over the womanly flair of the gunslinger's hip and back up again.
		She felt the deep breath expelled and smiled in the darkness. Her touch did have an effect
		on the older woman.</p>

		<p>"You like that."</p>

		<p>"Mmm," Josie replied, resisting the urge to guide the
		roaming hand to</p>

		<p>where she wanted it most. Rebecca repeated the motion, increasing
		her exploration until her fingers brushed against wiry curls soaked with desire. The touch
		was too much for the gunslinger to ignore. With a loud groan she pulled the young woman on
		top of her and brought their mouths together.</p>

		<p>Rebecca slipped her tongue in and tasted herself in Josie's
		mouth. Passion fed boldness and she reached up between them to cup the gunslinger's left
		breast.</p>

		<p>"Ohh&#133;you're so soft," she murmured. Although
		Rebecca wasn't experienced, she knew enough to know that what she liked her lover would
		enjoy as well. She brought her other hand in and had both of Josie's breasts under her</p>

		<p>control. "Am I too much for you?" she asked, knowing
		that all of her weight was on Josie. The gunslinger shook her head vigorously and wrapped
		her arms around Rebecca's back, holding her in place. The young woman rewarded her with
		another kiss as she rolled the nipples between her fingers, drawing growls of pleasure
		from the gunslinger's lips. They stayed like that for several minutes, throwing oil on the
		already out of control fire raging between them. Rebecca's leg slipped between Josie's
		thighs and the dark haired woman immediately tried to grind her sex against it.</p>

		<p>"God, Rebecca, please..." Josie's eyes closed when she
		felt one of</p>

		<p>Rebecca's hands move down between her legs and press against the
		dark triangle of fur. She responded by pressing hard against it, soaking the young woman's
		hand with her desire.</p>

		<p>"Yesss&#133;" the gunslinger moaned huskily. "Oh,
		Rebecca, that's nice."</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;I want to pleasure you," the young woman
		said in a raspy voice. Her finger slipped between the folds and felt exquisite wetness. A
		smile crept</p>

		<p>to her lips. "Hmm, I do believe you are quite excited."
		She moved her finger slowly in and out, unsure of how fast or hard to press. Her shy
		movements made Josie's knees weaken as she fought not to swim away with the feelings that
		were coursing through her.</p>

		<p>"Yes&#133;I am&#133;rather&#133;excited." The words
		came out in staccato bursts.</p>

		<p>"So am I." With that, they interlocked their legs,
		rubbing against each</p>

		<p>other. Their hands moved over each other, searching, learning.
		"Josie&#133;" Her voice was barely audible. She had never felt a passion like
		this. Rebecca continued her exploration, placing another finger inside the warmth of her
		lover. The gunslinger's back arched, giving Rebecca more access. Slowly she moved the
		fingers in and out, watching Josie's face as the excitement was building. The dark haired
		woman raised her hips, meeting each thrust.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;Oh&#133;ahh&#133;yes&#133;yes&#133;oh."
		Josie's words became incoherent as the passion consumed her. Rebecca placed her thumb on
		the swollen clit and rubbed</p>

		<p>hard, imitating what felt good to her. Her other hand was busy
		exploring the soft swell of Josie's breasts. The gunslinger's moans became louder as she
		lost control. Rebecca felt Josie&#146;s hot tunnel tightening around her fingers. She
		pinched the nipples and increased her pumping as the outlaw's moans gave way to screams of
		pleasure. Josie's body stiffened as a powerful orgasm ripped through her and wave after
		wave of juice poured from the older woman. Rebecca stopped pumping and held her fingers
		still, waiting for Josie to return from ecstasy. Slowly, the body beneath her relaxed and
		she removed her fingers. They lay together for a time, not speaking. Josie's fingers drew
		lazy circles against Rebecca's back as their breathing slowed and reality once again
		intruded into their lives in the form of the music still drifting in from the porch.
		Rebecca&#146;s hand rested on Josie&#146;s breast and her head was snug on the tall
		woman&#146;s shoulder. Her mind still reeled from everything that had happened that day,
		and she sighed.</p>

		<p>"This has been the most glorious day of my life,"
		Rebecca said softly. "I</p>

		<p>wish it would never end."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll do my best to make the rest of your days as
		glorious as this one,"</p>

		<p>Josie replied. Rebecca mumbled something unintelligible against
		Josie&#146;s breast, cuddled against her side and went to sleep.</p>
