	<chapter title="32: Just Desserts">
		<p>Typical of most mornings in the saloon, the women were all
		gathered around the tables, enjoying breakfast and each other's company before the patrons
		arrived. Rebecca sat with Victoria at a small table near the stairs, drinking coffee and
		listening to the brown headed woman talk about her new room and the differences between
		this whorehouse and the one she left behind in Rosewood. Josie sat with Sandy, quietly
		drinking coffee and catching up with her old friend. A tall thin man walked in, his
		walking stick tapping on the floor in cadence to his steps. The room suddenly quieted and
		Sandy exchanged a worried look with Josie before rising to meet him halfway.</p>

		<p>"Miss Sandy," he said none too politely as he surveyed
		the room, taking in the sight of the new women. He stroked his handlebar mustache
		thoughtfully.</p>

		<p>"Look, Sam, I've done already paid you for this week."
		She tried to sound forceful, but her genuine fear prevailed. Sam smiled wickedly.</p>

		<p>"Ah, but you didn't pay me enough. Why, I see you have some
		new ones. I do believe that makes the price higher, don't you?" He reached forward
		and pulled a small roll of bills out from between the madam's ample breasts. The sound of
		a chair scraping against the floor was heard as Josie rose to her feet quickly, her right
		hand hovering just over her shooting irons. Sam shoved the whore out of his way and stood
		directly in front of the woman in black. "You don't look like the type to be
		spreading your legs, so you best just get back to your own business," he spoke
		threateningly, yet his eyes remained fixed on Josie's weapons. The gunslinger desperately
		wanted to introduce her fist to his teeth but the madam stepped between them.</p>

		<p>"Look, there's no need for this kind of talk," Sandy
		said, trying to diffuse the situation. "You got what you came for, so git out and
		leave us alone."</p>

		<p>Sam looked around, paying close attention to the women's faces,
		noting which ones were scared of him and which weren't. "Nice merchandise, Miss
		Sandy. Perhaps I might just have me a sample or two, hmm?" he said lecherously, his
		mind filling with thoughts of one of the women lying helpless beneath him. A thin sneer
		formed on his lips. "I'll be back," he said before turning and leaving, the
		tapping of his walking stick echoing off into the distance. Josie waited until the sound
		was completely gone before sitting back down. Sandy joined her and sat quietly for a
		moment, letting the tension ease a bit before speaking. The other women resumed their
		conversations, although several still cast nervous glances at the doorway. Sandy motioned
		for the bartender and within seconds a full bottle of whiskey and two glasses were placed
		on her table. She filled them both before speaking.</p>

		<p>"He's Sam Hutchins. Owns the bank, the brewery, just about
		anything in town that has a profit to it," she said solemnly, wishing that the cactus
		juice could take away her feeling of dread.</p>

		<p>"What's his business with you?" Josie asked as she
		looked around the room again, making brief eye contact with Rebecca and smiling before
		turning her attention back to the blonde madam.</p>

		<p>"He holds the note to the saloon."</p>

		<p>"So he thinks that he owns everything..." Josie lowered
		her voice in disgust. "...and everyone in it."</p>

		<p>"That'd be about right," Sandy replied, reaching down
		to pick up Bobo. "We pay the mortgage but he still demands more, a part of the profit
		each week."</p>

		<p>"Is he dangerous?"</p>

		<p>"No, just greedier than a prospector. Thinks he's entitled
		to whatever he wants."</p>

		<p>Josie finished her drink and looked at her friend. "Do you
		want my help?" The blonde madam immediately stiffened and shook her head.</p>

		<p>"No, Josie. There's no need. I can handle him," she
		said firmly. She would live to regret those words.</p>

		<p>It was late afternoon when the men came pouring in from their day
		of labor. Everyone was known by name and greeted with hearty handshakes and smiles when
		they entered. Josie had long ago traded her cactus juice for ale, drinking slowly to keep
		her senses alert. There had been no sign of Hutchins since he left five hours ago, but the
		gunslinger still felt uneasy and insisted on staying. Rebecca passed the time chatting
		with Victoria until the customers started coming in. Josie decided that her young friend
		didn't need to see her friends working and took her back to the boarding house. In the
		hour after they left, the saloon became so busy that no one noticed Sam Hutchins enter and
		go up the stairs.</p>

		<p>He hid in a small vestibule and watched a door open and two
		people exit. The man tipped his hat and headed down the stairs. The brown-headed woman
		leaned over the railing and caught the attention of Sandy, indicating with her gestures
		that she was taking a break. The blonde madam nodded and went back to her duties. The
		young woman returned to her room. Locking the door behind her, she sat down in front of
		her small dresser and began to brush her hair, not paying attention to the image in the
		mirror until it was too late. Sam lunged forward, wrapping one arm around her throat and
		pulling her from the chair. With all the sounds of lust and passion coming from the rooms,
		no one heard the small yelp before she was gagged.</p>

		<p>Sandy knocked on the door. "Victoria?" When there was
		no answer she knocked again. "Victoria, unlock the door."</p>

		<p>"What's going on?" Elaine asked as she came out of her
		room. Her last customer of the night had left a short time ago and she was getting ready
		for bed when she heard the blonde woman's poundings on the door across the hall.</p>

		<p>"Victoria must have fallen asleep or something. The door's
		locked and no one's seen her in a few hours," she said as she reached in her pocket
		for the set of skeleton keys she kept there. Elaine became concerned and pounded hard on
		the door, shaking it on the hinges and drawing the other women from their rooms. They were
		asking each other if they knew what was going on as they all crowded around Victoria's
		door. Sandy turned the key and opened the door. Elaine rushed over to the bed, pulling the
		battered woman into her arms and removing the gag from her mouth. The curtain flapped
		against the frame of the open window.</p>

		<p>"I'll get the doc," Stacey said, heading for the
		stairs. Sandy ran out of the room and caught the redhead at the landing.</p>

		<p>"Doc Brooks met Saint Peter last week. Cheating at cards, I
		think. He never cared none for doctoring us anyway," the blonde woman said. Elaine
		came out of the room and shut the door behind her. Everyone quieted down and looked at
		her, waiting for news.</p>

		<p>"She says it's the man with the curly mustache."</p>

		<p>"Sam!" Sandy said in disgust. She turned to the
		redhead. "Get Josie."</p>

		<p>Josie reached over and took the large book out from under the
		blonde's nose and closed it. She'd been watching Rebecca reading the same paragraph for
		the better part of an hour. "I think it's time to visit the sandman, sprite. Let's
		go," she put her hand around the smaller woman's upper arm and helped her stand up.
		Rebecca stretched and groaned as her body moved for the first time in hours.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I think...(yawn)...you're right." She had been
		reading about the skeletal structure of the human body and found it too fascinating to put
		down, even when her eyes had trouble staying focused. She looked at the inviting pillow
		and aimed for it with her tired body only to be stopped by the gunslinger's strong arms.</p>

		<p>"Hold your horses there. You're not going to sleep in your
		boots. My shins wouldn't survive the way you toss about," Josie said as she turned
		Rebecca around and sat her down on the edge of the bed. She debated about helping the
		young woman when the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps made the decision for her. The
		gunslinger moved to the side of the door and readied her Colt, holding it up in position
		to press against the head of the intruder. She unlocked the door and turned the handle
		slowly.</p>

		<p>Stacey reached out to pound on the door when it suddenly flew
		open before her and she was roughly pulled inside and looking down the barrel of Josie's
		gun. A split second later the gun was withdrawn and back in its holster. "What's
		wrong?" the gunslinger barked while ushering her back out the door. The look on the
		redhead's face told her without a doubt that something had happened at the saloon.</p>

		<p>"Victoria's hurt. That damn banker came back and...."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, grab the saddlebag!" Josie interrupted. The
		young woman did as ordered and within seconds they were heading down the stairs, Rebecca
		now very wide awake.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca almost cried out when she saw the battered face of her
		friend.</p>

		<p>Victoria's right eye was swollen shut, a crimson line of blood
		trailed from her nose. Her disheveled brown hair only added to the appearance of being run
		over by a wagon train. The blonde was relieved and a bit confused to see Victoria still
		clothed. She looked at Elaine expectantly. The black headed woman shook her head, causing
		Rebecca to let out a sigh of relief. Josie was about to reach for the saddlebag when the
		young blonde moved to the edge of the bed and set it down beside her, opening the flap and
		rummaging through it looking for the strips of cloth they used for bandages. Without
		saying a word, the gunslinger motioned for everyone else to move away from the bed. Sandy
		followed that up with gestures for the women to leave the room. Only Josie, Sandy, and
		Stacey remained behind to watch the young woman care for her friend.</p>

		<p>Her hands trembled slightly from nervousness as she wet the strip
		of cloth. As delicately as she could, Rebecca gently wiped the blood that had run from
		Victoria's nose down to her chin. "You're gonna be just fine," she said softly.
		The brown-headed woman nodded and let a dry, cracked sound come from her lips.
		"Shh...don't try to talk," her soothing tone and gentle touch calmed the
		battered woman. Rebecca reached over and poured some water from the pitcher into a tin
		cup. Using her left arm to support Victoria's head, she lifted her up and placed the cup
		to her lips. It was then that Rebecca noticed the split lip, previously hidden by the
		bloody nose. "Stitches," she said quietly. Rebecca swallowed nervously as she
		realized that all the hours of sewing practice were about to be tested for the first time
		on a person. She forced her hands not to tremble as she reached into the side pouch and
		pulled out the needle and thread kept for that purpose. She narrowed her concentration,
		blocking out the other women in the room and focusing on the task at hand. Belle's voice
		echoed in her head, reminding her to make small, neat stitches. She took Victoria's hand
		and pressed it against the cloth on her lip. "Hold this."</p>

		<p>With ease born of practice, Rebecca threaded the needle, making a
		small knot in the end of the thread. She placed her hand reassuringly on the prostitute's
		shoulder. "Everything will be fine, Victoria, but your lip is cut pretty bad."
		She held up the needle and thread so the battered woman could see them. The young woman
		waited until her friend nodded in understanding. "This may hurt," Rebecca said
		apologetically as she pulled the cloth away and studied the uneven gash. In her mind's
		eye, she saw exactly where each stitch had to go to properly seal up the wound. Still, the
		idea of actually putting the needle and thread through a person's skin caused her stomach
		to churn. She closed her eyes for a moment and waited for the queasy feeling to pass.
		After a moment she opened them, the cloud of doubt and hesitation now gone. Victoria lay
		very still as she watched her friend bring the needle slowly to her lip. Although she
		trusted Rebecca, she still flinched and turned her head when she felt the pressure of the
		point against her skin. The young woman stopped and pulled back a bit, placing the cloth
		back over the bleeding wound. The direct approach was not going to work. "Victoria,
		do you know the story about Jim Bowie and the Alamo?" she asked, leaning over and
		dabbing at the wound with the cloth in one hand while bringing the needle closer. The
		brown-headed woman shook her head slightly. "Well, lucky for you I do." Rebecca
		spoke in a tone that made the upcoming story sound interesting. She began her tale,
		continuing to press down with the cloth as if cleaning the area. She had Victoria's
		complete attention on her story when she finally pushed the point of the needle through
		the broken skin.</p>

		<p>The battered woman didn't realize what she had done until she saw
		Rebecca's hand come up, drawing the thread tight. The touch was so gentle, the tones
		filling her ears so soft that she had no choice but to fall under the spell her friend was
		weaving. Victoria felt very little discomfort as the needle was passed through again and
		the thread drawn tight with small, gentle tugs. Rebecca smiled at her. "There, that
		wasn't so bad, now was it?" she said, continuing to press against the cut with the
		bloody cloth, maintaining activity in the area. "Now, where was I? Oh yes, he met up
		with Daniel Boone...."</p>

		<p>Josie watched with rapt fascination as Rebecca continued to
		stitch up the wound. When she had first closed her eyes, the gunslinger had taken a step
		forward, prepared to take over. But when the green eyes opened with a flash of confidence,
		Josie decided to stay where she was and watch what happened. She didn't move when Victoria
		flinched, and was quite impressed by the way Rebecca handled it. The gunslinger realized
		that her friend had a special talent, not just for healing with her hands, but for
		soothing with her voice. Josie noted that Victoria no longer had the fearful look in her
		eyes, but was calmly looking at her friend as she finished suturing the wound. Rebecca
		continued to tell her story while she looked for more signs of injury. Gone was the look
		of hesitation and nervousness, replaced by a new-found confidence in her abilities. The
		bounty hunter understood that a great change had happened to her friend. Rebecca was no
		longer the frightened young caterpillar she had rescued such a short time ago. The woman
		she looked at now was undergoing the transformation and Josie knew that it was only a
		matter of time before a beautiful butterfly emerged to cast her gentle glow over all she
		touched.</p>

		<p>Rebecca listened carefully as Victoria whispered to her the
		places that hurt. Even that little bit of talking hurt her. The inside of her mouth was
		cut up from his fist punching her cheek against her teeth time and time again, not to
		mention the puffy and split lip. There was little more that Rebecca could do for her
		friend. Most of the remaining injuries were bruises, her face, neck, and upper arms taking
		the brunt of it. Victoria touched her fingertips to her swollen lip, wincing at the pain.
		"Guess he done got me good...ow." "Yeah...he did," Rebecca said
		softly, her green eyes misting up.</p>

		<p>"Shh...twer..." she motioned for the water and took a
		sip, mindful of her lip, before continuing. "...'twernt the first time I got
		beat." Victoria looked away from her friend unable to face the look of innocence, the
		innocence she lost so long ago. "Prob'ly won't be the last." Her voice was
		tinged with the anger she felt welling up inside her. Rebecca placed a gentle hand on her
		forearm.</p>

		<p>"Victoria, it doesn't have to be that way. You can leave
		this all behind you. Make a new start. We'll help you, if you let us. Everyone deserves a
		second chance." She spoke in her most convincing tone of voice, yet the brown headed
		woman maintained the defeated look on her face.</p>

		<p>"Whores don't usually git second chances."</p>

		<p>"No?" Rebecca reached over, opened the pouch, and
		pulled out the small bible she had found when she first started following Josie around.
		She opened it to the New Testament and flipped through until she found the page she was
		looking for. She took a sip of water and began to read, "Now the scribes and the
		Pharisees brought a woman caught at adultery, and, after standing her in their midst, they
		said to him 'Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery. In the
		Law of Moses prescribed for us to stone such sort of women. What, really, do you
		say?'" She looked up from the book to catch Victoria's eyes with her own. "And
		do you know what he said? He said 'Let he who is without sin be the first to cast a stone
		at her.' Victoria, no one threw a stone because no one is above sin. We all make mistakes,
		and we all deserve a second chance."</p>

		<p>Josie motioned for the others to follow her out of the room,
		confident that her young friend had things well in hand and in fact was probably doing a
		better job than she would have been able to do. For just a moment she caught the green
		eyes with her own. The depth of compassion and caring that Josie saw there was too much
		for her. Suddenly uncomfortable, the gunslinger simply followed the others out, closing
		the door behind her. She had no doubt that this would be a very long night for both of
		them. "Sandy, put coffee on," she called out to the blonde woman at the bottom
		of the stairs.</p>

		<p>A short time later, the three women were sitting about one of the
		small round tables. Not wanting to draw attention to the saloon at such a late hour, they
		chose to light only one small lamp, setting it on a nearby table. Josie picked up her cup
		of coffee and leaned back in her chair, resting her booted foot on the table in a most
		unladylike manner. "Why does he do that?"</p>

		<p>Sandy looked down at the half empty cup of coffee. "It's how
		he gets it done. Can't do it no other way," she let a small smirk cross her face.
		"You know how he needs that there stick o' his to walk with? Well..." she leaned
		forward as she shared the secret. "Damn fool was twirling his gun around and shot
		himself. Ain't got hardly nothing left now." They all had a good laugh at his expense
		before she continued. "But he still feels, I guess. 'Tain't the first time this
		happened. Beat three girls so bad they can't work no more, and another...well, she ain't
		right in the head no more. He up and punched her stupid."</p>

		<p>"So what do we do now?" Stacey asked.</p>

		<p>"Nothin' we can do," Sandy replied. "I do what I
		can to keep him away from the girls, but sometimes he still gets through. You know the law
		ain't gonna touch him just on our say so. We're good enough to go round the mountain with
		but not good enough to believe over that no good excuse for a man," she said
		bitterly. "I just hope somebody puts him in a wooden overcoat soon."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps sooner than you think," Josie said softly,
		putting her finger on her lips. Soon they also heard the unmistakable sound of Sam's
		walking stick tapping the ground as he approached. Stacey reached over and pulled the gun
		from Josie's left holster. The gunslinger had no time to react as the creak of rusty
		hinges announced his arrival. She quickly pulled her right gun out and readied it for
		action. The redhead would have hell to pay later, the gunslinger thought to herself.</p>

		<p>"Ladies, why are you sitting in the dark? Surely you won't
		attract customers that way," he said smugly as he moved over to the bar and lit
		another lamp, turning the wick up to cast a dark orange light. Sandy rose, followed
		quickly by Stacey, and walked crossed the floor to meet him halfway. Josie remained in her
		seat with her gun aimed directly at him from under the table. She knew without looking
		exactly where her weapon was pointing. With his attention directed at the approaching
		woman, it was easy for her to reach over and turn the wick down on the lamp near her,
		leaving it still burning, but too low to cast light on her.</p>

		<p>"Get out of here!" Sandy hissed. The redhead stood
		behind her, the revolver sandwiched between their bodies. "You may not have nothin'
		else but you sure got balls coming back here after what you done."</p>

		<p>"Done?" he said, feigning innocence. "I haven't
		been here since earlier today. I was in my office all evening." Hutchins stroked the
		curl of his mustache. "Of course no one saw me," he said with a sly grin.</p>

		<p>"You bastard!" Sandy lunged at him, her anger at all
		the women hurt at his hands flooding through her. Her sudden movement put her between the
		banker and Josie, blocking any shot she may have had. The gunslinger leapt to her feet,
		ready to join the fray and protect her friends.</p>

		<p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Sam swung his cane,
		striking Sandy just below the left temple. As the women fell, he raised his arm for
		another blow. Both Josie and Stacey leveled their weapons. It was the redhead that fired
		first, striking him in the center of his forehead. The force kicked his head back, causing
		the gunslinger's bullet to fly harmlessly into the wood behind the bar. His eyes rolled up
		into his head as a thin stream of blood poured down the front of his face and he pitched
		backward. His lifeless body landed across the blonde madam's legs. Stacey's hand started
		shaking violently with the realization of what happened. Josie reached her quickly and
		wrenched the gun out of her hands, putting it back in its holster. She pulled out a chair
		and forced the redhead to sit down before she fell down.</p>

		<p>The gunshot brought all the women out of their rooms. Rebecca
		flew down the stairs, her focus solely on Josie and not on the possible danger. The
		gunslinger rolled Hutchins off Sandy and helped her to her feet just as the young woman
		reached the bottom of the stairs. The other women looked down from the upstairs railing.
		Josie's eyes narrowed as she stormed over and grabbed the young woman by the upper arm,
		pulling her over to a far corner before releasing her. Unmindful of the gunslinger's
		anger, Rebecca wrapped her arms around the taller woman and hugged her tightly. "When
		I heard..." she inhaled sharply and shook her head against Josie's chest, unable to
		voice her fears.</p>

		<p>The bounty hunter looked down at her, understanding the mixture
		of emotions running through Rebecca. The anger she had with her for running headlong into
		an unknown danger dissipated as she tentatively wrapped her arms around the young woman's
		shoulders, resting her chin on the top of the blonde head. "We'll talk later,"
		she said gently. Rebecca nodded, knowing that she made a mistake and that most likely the
		gunslinger was angry with her about it. A soft smile came to her lips. Although angry,
		Josie still allowed her this comforting embrace. She gave one more squeeze before stepping
		back.</p>

		<p>The women looked expectantly at Josie. If anyone knew how to hide
		a killing, it was the tall gunslinger. She walked over to Sandy. "Want him
		found?" she said seriously, her mind already working on where to deposit the body for
		the buzzards to pick clean.</p>

		<p>"I think that's best. If he don't show back up, they'll be
		looking for him," the blonde madam replied, much to the gunslinger's dismay. It would
		have been much easier to make him disappear.</p>

		<p>"And if anyone saw him here...." Josie left the thought
		unfinished as she looked around the room. Her eyes gazed upon the large chandelier full of
		dangling diamond shaped pieces of lead glass. She turned to Rebecca. "I want you to
		take Stacey upstairs, okay? Tell everyone to meet us in Victoria's room."</p>

		<p>"What are you...?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, go," Josie asked more than said.</p>

		<p>"Uh...yeah," she said, understanding the unspoken
		message in the blue eyes. The gunslinger didn't want her to see what she was going to do.
		"I'll wait for you upstairs." She turned and went to get Stacey, leaving the
		gunslinger to her task.</p>

		<p>Josie waited until everyone was out of sight except for Sandy,
		who was keeping an eye out for any signs of life on the street. Apparently no one heard
		the gunshot, as there were no signs of activity. The blonde could only hope that no one
		would be wakened by the next sound to come from the saloon. Josie walked to the corner and
		looked at the rope. One end was tied to a rung in the wall. The other ran up through a
		pulley to the top of the chandelier. She smiled. This was the part she loved; the
		execution of a brilliant plan. Pulling off the impossible. That's what made her such a
		good train robber; what kept her alive. The ability to think quickly on her feet was a
		skill she hoped never failed her, or Rebecca. After a quick glance upstairs, Josie focused
		her attention on the knot holding the rope to the anchor on the wall.</p>

		<p>The women from Rosewood were gathered in Victoria's room, the
		others waiting in the hall outside the doorway due to the lack of space. Rebecca sat on
		the bed next to the upright Victoria, quietly explaining what she knew. Elaine and the
		others were comforting Stacey, who was in a complete state of shock over taking a human
		life. The sound of the large chandelier crashing to the floor caused all of them to jump.
		Bobo, who had been sleeping quietly under the dresser, tore off like shot across the room
		and dived under the bed. Josie came bounding up the stairs, her long legs avoiding every
		other step. Everyone poured out into the hallway to hear what happened. Josie waited until
		she saw</p>

		<p>Rebecca come out of the room, the battered Victoria in tow.
		"Get the saddlebag," she said, and watched as the blonde disappeared back into
		the room to return with their gear. The gunslinger turned her attention to the whores, all
		looking at her for an explanation.</p>

		<p>"Sandy has gone for the sheriff," the gunslinger raised
		her voice slightly to make sure everyone heard her. "Act confused. You have no idea
		why he was here or what he was doing. You don't know anything and hadn't seen him since
		early afternoon." Her words were met with a chorus of nods. "All you heard was a
		loud crash downstairs. That's all." Her tone warned them that the previous sound of a
		gun was not to be mentioned. Josie reached for Rebecca's arm. "We need to
		go...now."</p>

		<p>Josie didn't say a word as they walked back to the boarding house
		and her body language made it clear that Rebecca wasn't to speak either. They took the
		route through the alleyways, carefully avoiding the main street and the possibility of
		being seen. Once inside the privacy of their room, the gunslinger sat down on the edge of
		the bed and motioned for Rebecca to sit next to her. In the darkness, all they could see
		of each other were dim silhouettes. Josie sat quietly, waiting for the inevitable
		questions.</p>

		<p>"Why did you do that? Drop the chandelier on him, I mean.
		Won't they see the bullet hole?" she asked, not entirely sure she wanted to hear the
		answer.</p>

		<p>"With all the cuts, looking for a small hole like that would
		be like looking for a needle in a haystack," Josie said assuredly, although she
		secretly worried that someone might have heard the gunshot. It would only take one person
		commenting on a previous sound before the crashing glass to cause a closer look to be
		taken at the dead body.</p>

		<p>"What did Sandy tell the sheriff?"</p>

		<p>"That Hutchins insisted on lighting the chandelier and when
		she went to lower it, the rope slipped out of her hands. A tragic accident."</p>

		<p>"Do you think the sheriff will believe her?" Rebecca
		asked.</p>

		<p>Josie pondered the question for a brief moment.</p>

		<p>"If Sandy put her mind to it, she could convince an assayer
		to buy fools gold. She's a fast thinker, that one. Nope, unless he sees something wrong,
		the sheriff will buy her story."</p>

		<p>"Good," the young woman said as she let out a sigh of
		relief. An awkward silence fell between them.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...." she said, trying to break the deafening
		silence.</p>

		<p>"You did a good job taking care of Victoria." Josie
		turned and pulled one leg up on the bed so she could face the young woman. "From what
		I saw, her lip will heal up just fine."</p>

		<p>"I tried to concentrate on what Belle taught me about
		stitching," she said modestly, but in the darkness of the night, she was beaming ear
		to ear from the compliment.</p>

		<p>"No, you did more than that. You comforted her while you
		tended to her. That's a special talent, Rebecca. Not everyone can do both." Josie
		took a deep breath and paused for a moment. The blonde swallowed, understanding that the
		topic was about to change and knowing what was coming. "When you heard the gunshot,
		your first instinct should have been to get to safety, not to run headlong into
		danger." As she spoke, Josie was careful not to let her fear for Rebecca's safety
		express itself as anger in her voice. "Next time, act; don't react," she said as
		she reached out and placed a hand on the young woman's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Josie...I didn't mean to scare you." The sudden
		tension in the hand on her shoulder told Rebecca that she had accurately guessed the
		gunslinger's feelings. She patted her hand gently. "I worry about you, you know. I
		care."</p>

		<p>"You still have to be careful; not take chances," Josie
		said firmly, not thinking about the words until after they had left her mouth.</p>

		<p>"Said the desert to the grain of sand," she shot back.
		"I worry about you because you give me reason to worry, Josie. One of these days
		someone is going to call you out and...." Rebecca stopped when she realized her
		mistake. The gunslinger's shoulders slumped and she let her hand fall to rest on the young
		woman's knee.</p>

		<p>"You're still upset about yesterday." It was a
		statement, but also a question. Rebecca nodded.</p>

		<p>"Hey," she said, smiling in the darkness and putting
		her hand on top of the gunslingers. "I'll make a deal with you. I won't take
		unnecessary chances if you won't."</p>

		<p>"It's a deal," Josie said as she tried to stifle a
		yawn. "Now let's get some sleep." She rose and quickly stripped down to her
		drawers. Rebecca took longer to get down to her slip. They curled up together as they had
		the previous night, the gunslinger's arm wrapped protectively around the young woman's
		waist, their bodies so close that only one pillow was needed. A couple of minor
		adjustments and both settled into a comfortable position. Lying in the warm embrace, the
		outside world melted away for Rebecca. The vision of her friend beaten, the stress of
		putting the needle through skin, all the actions of the day slipped from her mind. There
		was no dead man, no danger, only the safety that came from the strong arms wrapped around
		her. Just as Rebecca crossed the line to sleep, the rich voice behind her ear whispered
		"Good night, sprite," as the strong arm around her belly squeezed gently.</p>

		<p>The sandman wasn't as quick to visit the gunslinger. Her mind
		raced with thoughts of the possible activities going on up the street. She lay there until
		she heard the steady breathing that indicated her companion was asleep. Being careful not
		to disturb Rebecca, Josie slipped out of bed and went to the window to keep an eye on the
		goings on up the street.</p>

	<chapter title="33: Lance in the Pants">
		<p>Rebecca woke to see the tall gunslinger staring out the window,
		mug in hand. "'Morning," she said with a yawn.</p>

		<p>"'Morning," Josie replied, her gaze never leaving the
		bustle of activity at the saloon. She recognized the long, flat wagon of an undertaker
		sitting outside. Rebecca trudged over to the small table and picked up the tin mug.</p>

		<p>"Josie, where's my coffee?" she asked as she looked at
		the empty cup. She received a sheepish grin as the gunslinger held out the mug she was
		holding. The young woman took the half-empty cup and frowned. She downed it in a few
		swallows and set it on the table. "You know, Josie, if I got up before you and drank
		your coffee, you'd have my head on a stick."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but you'll never wake up before I do," the
		gunslinger said confidently, turning her attention from the activities outside and looking
		at the young woman. Josie looked back out the window, but not before seeing the blonde
		stick her tongue out at her. She watched as the canvas wrapped body was placed in the back
		of the wagon and the sheriff exchanged words with the undertaker. The man with the badge
		looked at the corpse in the wagon and shook his head. The undertaker shook hands with him
		and both men went on their way. Sandy left the saloon and headed up the street towards the
		boarding house. "We've got company, Rebecca."</p>

		<p>The young woman was dressed and ready by the time Sandy knocked
		on the door to their room. "How'd it go?", Josie asked as the blonde madam
		entered the room.</p>

		<p>"Just like you said it would. Old man Henry is taking him to
		the dirt pile now," she said. The gunslinger gave a grim smile of satisfaction. With
		no doctor in town, it was up to the undertaker to decide if an autopsy was called for and
		apparently the old man wasn't interested in trying to keep the body until one could be
		called from another town.</p>

		<p>"Good," Josie said as she flopped down on the bed,
		guns, boots and all. It had been a long night and the news that it was over finally gave
		her a chance to relax. She closed her eyes, hoping that today would be a lazy day and she
		could catch up on her sleep.</p>

		<p>"How's Stacey?" Rebecca asked as she motioned for Sandy
		to sit at the table with her. The young woman had no doubt that Josie had stayed up the
		remaining hours until dawn. She deliberately kept her voice low, hoping that the
		gunslinger would get some much-needed rest. Sandy understood and kept her voice at the
		same low level.</p>

		<p>"She's doing better. Elaine managed to keep her quiet and
		hidden when the sheriff was around. Poor thing's pretty shook up, though."</p>

		<p>As they spoke quietly about the previous night's events, Rebecca
		glanced over at the bed frequently, checking on her friend. It wasn't long before Josie
		was in a deep and apparently peaceful sleep. "Sandy..." she whispered, and
		pointed at the sleeping gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Come on, Rebecca. I'll buy you breakfast," the madam
		whispered back.</p>

		<p>As quietly as possible, they left. The sound of the door closing
		woke Josie, but after a second of deliberation, she decided that they'd be fine and rolled
		over and went back to sleep.</p>

		<p>Sandy took Rebecca to the small restaurant. The same waitress was
		there, but this time she was much more pleasant and gave them a table near the pot-bellied
		stove. The young woman was quite happy at that, since the coffeepot was kept warming
		there. She quickly helped herself to a cup while waiting.</p>

		<p>"I guess they let anyone in here," a woman said to her
		husband as they passed their table. Sandy gave her a withering glare. The pompous woman
		let go of her husband's arm and turned to face them with her hands on her hips. "I
		heard that Sam Hutchins died there last night. No doubt fitting punishment for visiting a
		whore." She turned her attention to Rebecca. "And what's this?</p>

		<p>A new one? How old are you, child? Seventeen? Eighteen? You
		should be home, learning cookin 'n sewin and worrying about finding yourself a
		husband." She paused for a moment to study the face before her. "You're pretty
		enough; shouldn't have no problem finding yourself a man."</p>

		<p>"Now you look here, you high and mighty bitch!" Sandy
		said rising to her feet. Rebecca rose as well, hoping to avoid a conflict in the middle of
		the restaurant.</p>

		<p>"Ladies!" she said, putting her hands up to silence
		them. "Please." She looked at the indignant woman and her cowed husband.
		"Ma'am, we just want to get something to eat. You were leaving, weren't you?"</p>

		<p>"It's bad enough you have that brothel of sin and booze. You
		should keep yourselves there and not come out to sully a fine respectable place like
		this." She looked at Rebecca and went on, "I won't stand by and watch a new one
		like this come in and corrupt our fine men." Her face twisted with self-righteous
		anger and hate as her body tensed, ready to strike.</p>

		<p>"Sweetheart?" Everyone turned to see the brown headed
		young man approach.</p>

		<p>Rebecca breathed a sigh of relief as she recognized Lance. The
		woman relaxed her body, clearly confused. Lance stepped close and kissed the blonde on the
		cheek. "So you did decide to have breakfast with your aunt. I wish you would have
		told me, darling. I was worried."</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked at him blankly for a moment before she caught on.
		"Uh...yeah." She forced a smile to her face, not that it was too hard seeing as
		how he just swept in and rescued her from trouble. "I should have told you." She
		turned to her companion and continued, "Aunt Sandy, this is Lance." Sandy
		quickly put a happy smile on her face and she held her arms out.</p>

		<p>"Lance darling, so nice to finally meet you. Rebecca has
		told me so much about you." They embraced as though truly glad to see each other.</p>

		<p>Thoroughly embarrassed, the woman said gruffly to her husband,
		"Come on, Harold," as she headed for the exit. Rebecca barely suppressed a
		giggle as she watched them leave. She smiled and held her hand out, pointed at an empty
		chair.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much. Please join us."</p>

		<p>Lance smiled at his good fortune and quickly helped both women
		with their chairs before taking his own seat. Rebecca smiled at him and he smiled back,
		neither one of them speaking. Sandy watched the interaction and smiled to herself. Ah,
		young love. So pure and sweet in its innocence. Rebecca briefly explained to her that they
		had met before as she continued to smile at Lance.</p>

		<p>The waitress brought their food and set it down gently on the
		table in front of them, frowning slightly when she saw the young man. "You have to
		eat something to stay here," she said firmly.</p>

		<p>"Oh, dear me," Sandy said rising once again to her
		feet. "I have to get back. Lance, would you be a dear and escort Rebecca back to the
		saloon after she finishes? You're welcome to mine," she said as she pushed the plate
		in front of him. She opened her purse to pull out money, but the young man held his hand
		up.</p>

		<p>"Please, let me. It would be my sincere pleasure." He
		turned back to Rebecca. "Would you like some more coffee?" He was already moving
		out of his chair and reaching for the potholder hanging on a hook next to the stove. Sandy
		looked at her, silently asking if she'd be all right. Rebecca smiled and nodded slightly.
		Lance leaned over and filled her cup, smiling at her the entire time and almost spilling
		the coffee. Sandy smiled and gracefully left them alone.</p>

		<p>"So, Rebecca ...are you new to Cheyenne?" he asked as
		he buttered her bread for her.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," she said accepting the bread from him with
		a smile, "We're just passing through, actually." She took a small bite of her
		bread and returned the coffee mug to her lips, looking over it at the handsome young man.
		Rebecca was acutely aware that the toes of their boots were touching. "And you?"</p>

		<p>"We moved here about six months ago, from Tucson. We have a
		small cattle ranch a few miles out of town," he said, completely mesmerized by the
		green eyes looking at him from beneath soft lashes. "You are very beautiful," he
		murmured, smiling when her cheeks flushed pink and she looked down at her plate.</p>

		<p>He reached out and took her hand in his own. "I mean it,
		Rebecca. You truly are a work of art, worthy of being in one of those museums in New York
		City."</p>

		<p>"Stop," she said, embarrassed. "You don't know me,
		Lance." She gently pulled her hand back to her lap, noting that it was the first time
		a man had touched her so gently.</p>

		<p>"I'd like the opportunity to get to know you better,
		Rebecca," he said sincerely. "And I hope the feeling is mutual."</p>

		<p>Rebecca's heart picked up its pace slightly. This well mannered,
		handsome, charming gentleman was trying to court her. She put her hands on the table and
		found them instantly encased within his warm and gentle ones.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The sun was high in the sky when Josie woke. She looked around
		for a moment before remembering that Rebecca had gone to eat with Sandy. She got out of
		bed and stretched before reaching down and scratching the area under her breasts while
		yawning, looking every bit like a bear coming out of hibernation. She looked out the
		window. Horses, wagons, and people all filled the street as they went about their
		business. Her eyes narrowed when she saw the familiar blonde head walking arm-in-arm with
		a man. She looked closer and realized that it was the boy from the theater. Her jaw
		clenched unconsciously when she saw him put his arm around Rebecca's waist. It took less
		than four strides of her long legs to reach the door.</p>

		<p>Sandy stared at the clock nervously. Josie would kill her if she
		knew she had let Rebecca out of her sight, the madam was sure of it. Her quiet friend
		didn't speak of why she was traveling with the young woman, but Sandy knew from watching
		the gunslinger that Rebecca was special to her. They hadn't gone 'round the mountain yet,
		Sandy was certain of that, especially after talking with Elaine. She knew the blonde was
		no relation of the half-Cherokee, but she couldn't think of any other reason for them to
		be traveling together. If not for love or money, then why? And what of Rebecca's reason
		for being with Josie? Sandy found it most interesting that the gunslinger made no mention
		of any recent robberies and in fact the madam realized that she hadn't heard anything
		about the raven headed woman since the news article quite a while back about the robbery
		in the mid-west, which reported the death of the outlaw. Perhaps the young blonde had
		something to do with that. Certainly Josie seemed more at ease around people since the
		last time she'd seen her, and the way she had held Rebecca after the shooting was most
		surprising to the madam. She had no idea Josie could be so gentle and caring.</p>

		<p>The madam breathed a sigh of relief when she saw Rebecca and
		Lance enter the saloon, only to see Josie come in just seconds behind them. She took a
		quick note of their position and headed straight for Sandy. "I thought you were going
		to keep an eye on her," she said in a disapproving tone, then stepped back a bit when
		she realized just how much like a mother hen she sounded. The madam decided that a change
		in subject was the best course of action. "Josie, how about you and me go in the back
		room and play some pool?" she suggested. She moved closer and lowered her voice.
		"I'll even throw in a jug of cactus juice I've got hidden back there." She
		followed the gunslinger's line of sight back to the couple sitting opposite each other at
		a small table in the back.</p>

		<p>"Come on, Josie, let those kids have some fun. It looks like
		he's quite taken with her."</p>

		<p>"Yeah...well, he'd better not get too taken with her. He
		won't be a happy person if he does." Her tone was serious enough to make the madam
		gulp nervously. She'd seen Josie in action and knew just how swiftly she could cut a man
		down. Sandy looked at the couple again. They were just quietly talking, each with a
		sarsaparilla in front of them. She hoped for Lance's sake that he was as much of a
		gentleman as he seemed.</p>

		<p>Josie realized that she was feeling more anger toward the young
		man than she should have. He had done nothing out of the ordinary and Rebecca seemed happy
		enough. 'Get a grip Josie,' she chided herself. 'If she wants to spend time with him, well
		that's just fine with me. We don't have to spend all of our time together.' With that in
		mind, the gunslinger turned and headed to the back room, followed closely by Sandy.</p>

		<p>Rebecca turned her head slightly to watch them go into the back
		room.</p>

		<p>Lance's back was to the door and thus he didn't see the glare
		given him by the gunslinger. She wondered briefly why Josie didn't come over to talk to
		her, but was drawn back to Lance by a polite cough. "Oh, I'm sorry. What?"</p>

		<p>"I asked if you would do me the honor of accompanying me
		tonight? My father is having a barbecue to celebrate his forty-fifth birthday. Nothing
		fancy, just a bunch of the ranch hands and some friends of the family," he said
		quickly, his nervousness showing through. He flashed her a hopeful smile.</p>

		<p>"You can even bring your mother along if you want to,"
		he said, receiving a guffaw from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Lance, she isn't my mother. She's just a friend."</p>

		<p>"Oh," he said, embarrassed.</p>

		<p>"It's all right," she said, still grinning. "We
		get a lot of funny looks." She decided not to tell him that most of the looks were of
		fear of the tall, intimidating gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Well, if you want, you can bring her along, I guess. I'm
		sure my mother will keep her company," he offered, willing to do anything to get the
		beautiful blonde to accept his offer.</p>

		<p>"No. I don't think your mother and Josie would have much in
		common to talk about," she smirked as she thought about the possible conversations
		between the two women. Lance's mother trying to talk about the recent harvest and the
		gunslinger talking about why Colt Peacemakers are the best shooting irons around. She gave
		a small giggle at the thought. Lance smiled, although he didn't get the joke.</p>

		<p>"So will you? Go with me, I mean?"</p>

		<p>"Um..." she flashed him a shy smile. "...yes, I'd
		like that," she said. He relaxed visibly and let out a deep breath as he ran his hand
		through his hair.</p>

		<p>"That's great! Um...I'll pick you up at six...uh, I don't
		know where you live," he said apologetically.</p>

		<p>"I'm staying at the boarding house."</p>

		<p>"Fine. I'll pick you up there at six."</p>

		<p>"That'd be nice," she replied, wondering why her heart
		was racing again.</p>

		<p>Then she realized that this was the first time she was going on
		an actual date.</p>

		<p>"Well, I'd better get back to the ranch before pop has a
		fit," he said as he stood up, taking her hand into his and kissing it. "I'll see
		you tonight, fair lady."</p>

		<p>"Oh..." She rose to her feet and nervously pulled her
		hand back. "Tonight then," she said as she watched him leave. When he was no
		longer in sight she turned to go find Josie and instead she saw Victoria leaning against
		the upstairs rail. With a wave and a smile she went to go visit with her for a little
		while.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie checked and double-checked the angle and position of the
		balls before taking her shot. With a crack, the cue ball struck the nine ball, just off
		from where she had intended it to, sending the white ball into the side pocket. "I
		thought you were good at pool, Josie," Sandy said as she refilled the gunslinger's
		glass again.</p>

		<p>"I would be if the cues weren't warped," she
		complained, turning the stick in her hands to study it. "And if you would stop trying
		to get me drunk," she added half-jokingly as she pulled the cue ball out of the
		pocket and handed it to the blonde madam. Sandy smirked and handed Josie the full glass.</p>

		<p>"I have to do something to have an even chance, don't
		I?" she said as she took aim, sending the nine ball into the corner pocket easily.
		"After a while, you get used to the curves of the cues. Don't even notice
		anymore." She set the cue against the wall and sat down on the couch. "I do
		believe it's your turn to rack them."</p>

		<p>It was after three when Rebecca came down and knocked on the
		door. She poked her head inside and looked at Josie. "Can I talk to you?"</p>

		<p>"Come on in, Rebecca," Sandy said as she tossed her
		stick on the table.</p>

		<p>"I've got to get ready for tonight anyway."</p>

		<p>"Josie," she began hesitantly after the madam left.
		"Lance has asked me to his ranch for a party tonight."</p>

		<p>"Have fun," she replied with no sign of emotion.</p>

		<p>"Well..." Rebecca turned, but not before Josie saw the
		look of hurt on her face. "I guess I'd better get back and get ready."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, wait," she said as she walked over and closed
		the door. "Sit down." They each took a seat on the couch, Josie mentally
		chastising herself for not realizing how much the young woman was looking for her approval
		and encouragement. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound like I didn't care. I do
		care."</p>

		<p>"You think I'm just a child, Josie. I'm not." She was
		upset enough to let her hurt and anger through. "I wasn't asking your permission,
		Josie. I was trying to share something important to me with you."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I don't think you're a child."</p>

		<p>"Really, Josie? What was that look when you saw Lance and me
		together? You didn't look happy."</p>

		<p>"I..." She scrambled to explain what she felt when she
		saw them together. "I was just surprised to see you with someone other than Sandy,
		that's all.</p>

		<p>Call it my protective nature." She forced a toothy smile,
		hoping to lighten the mood. Rebecca relented, unwilling to remain angry with her best
		friend.</p>

		<p>"Okay, but I really do need to get going." She looked
		down at her dress, trying to smooth out the wrinkles, then down at her boots. Josie caught
		the look on her face and frowned in understanding. A quick mental count told her she
		didn't have enough money to get Rebecca both a nice pair of shoes and a new dress. There
		was a flicker in her blue eyes as she thought of a solution to the problem.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, go on to the house and get washed up. I'll be
		there in a little while," Josie said handing her the money to pay for the bath. When
		their hands touched to exchange the bill, Josie gripped it for a moment. "In the
		bottom of the saddlebag on my side is a small bottle of Katec toilet water. It's strong,
		so don't drown yourself with it." The smile she received was worth far more than the
		two bits the perfume cost. After Rebecca left, the gunslinger smiled to herself and headed
		upstairs.</p>

		<p>The bathtub was located in a back room downstairs. The lock was
		nothing more than a piece of wood nailed to the door that turned to block it from being
		pulled open. Looking at it as she turned it into position, Rebecca decided that even she
		could pull the door open, the nail hole worn enough to allow the wood to swivel easily.
		One good tug and it was certain to fall to the floor. She silently wished that she had
		known so she could have had Josie stand outside the door. Too late now, she mused as she
		removed her clothes, setting them in a small pile on the floor, save the dress, which she
		draped on a nail sticking out of the wall for just such a purpose. She placed her clean
		underdrawers and slip on the small shelf and carefully stepped into the clawfoot tub.</p>

		<p>She had been soaking for some time when she heard the firm but
		non-threatening knock on the door. "Rebecca?"</p>

		<p>"Hang on, Josie," she said, climbing from the tub and
		wrapping a towel around her. She turned the lock and opened the door enough to poke her
		head out.</p>

		<p>"Let me in." The look on the gunslinger's face reminded
		Rebecca of her sister's face when she was giving someone a present. She stepped back and
		let Josie in, closing and securing the door behind her. She was holding a light green and
		white lace dress as well as a pair of white button down boots. "I thought you might
		like to wear this to the party," she said as she set the boots down and hung the
		dress up, tossing Rebecca's old one on the floor with the rest of the dirty clothes.
		"I couldn't afford both, but Sandy found the dress in one of the closets. I think
		it'll fit you just right," she said, not bothering to mention that it took her the
		better part of an hour to find and purchase the boots. She was not expecting quite the
		reaction she got. Rebecca's eyes filled up and she gave Josie the best imitation of a bear
		hug she could, before softening it and laying her head on the older woman's chest.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Josie," she murmured, her hand splaying out
		and rubbing up and down the gunslinger's back slowly. The movement of her upper arm caused
		her towel to fall open exposing her whole back as it hung loosely, trapped between their
		bodies. Josie was returning the embrace when she felt the smooth skin beneath her fingers
		instead of the towel. Rebecca made no effort to move when she felt the strong arms wrap
		around her bare skin and squeeze gently. After a moment, a feeling of awkwardness set in
		for the gunslinger and she reached down and gathered the ends of the towel, securing it
		back around her friend's body.</p>

		<p>"I guess I'd better let you get ready." She turned and
		reached for the door handle. "Is this their idea of a lock?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah," Rebecca replied, still staring in awe at the
		new dress and boots.</p>

		<p>"I'll be outside when you're done," Josie said
		authoritatively. She took a quick look to make sure the blonde was still covered before
		she opened the door and stepped out. Another boarder was in the adjoining parlor and
		glanced in her direction. One quick glare from her and his attention went back into the
		week old newspaper in his hand.</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked in the small mirror, trying to see as much of
		herself as she could. As Josie had predicted, the dress fit perfectly, although it was a
		bit snug in the chest, she thought as she looked down to see exactly how much cleavage was
		showing through the white lace that started barely above her nipples. To her relief, the
		lace was intricate enough to cover everything, although it still clearly defined her
		pushed up bosom, making her appear larger than she was used to, and causing her to feel a
		bit self conscious. She looked down at the delicate boots and smiled again. They were
		completely impractical for traveling and were clearly an indulgence on Josie's part. The
		boots had to have taken up most of the money not set aside for supplies. Rebecca ran her
		fingertips across the pearly buttons. "Oh Josie..." she whispered as a teary
		smile came to her face. She picked up the boots in one hand and her dirty clothes and
		traveling boots in the other, pressing the garments against her body to keep them from
		falling, and opened the door.</p>

		<p>Josie immediately moved from her position leaning against the
		wall to help Rebecca with her clothes. "Give me those. You don't want that clean
		dress to smell like your dirty clothes, do you? Come on." As they went upstairs,
		Josie's boots struck the wood in sharp contrast to the young woman's bare feet. Once
		inside the room, the gunslinger put the boots in the corner and the clothes in the growing
		pile of laundry in the other corner. Rebecca sat down on the bed and pulled her leg up
		over her knee to put on her boot. She slipped the leather and cloth over her foot,
		frowning when she realized that the buttons were on the outside. "Why do they do
		that?" she grumbled as she tried to reach around and fasten the buttons. Josie
		chuckled and knelt down in front of her.</p>

		<p>"Let me," she said as she pulled Rebecca's ankle off
		her knee. "They button on the outside because they expect all 'ladies' to have
		someone helping them get dressed." Her nimble fingers worked quickly, securing all
		the small buttons up the calf.</p>

		<p>"Well, it seems a little silly, doesn't it?" Rebecca
		replied, surprised at the gentle manner in which Josie put her foot into her boot. She
		held the calf with one hand and gently slipped the shoe part of the boot onto the young
		woman's foot, then rested the foot back on the ground before methodically buttoning it.</p>

		<p>"That's why I don't wear them. Just like corsets,"
		Josie replied as she stood up. "Okay, let's get a look at you."</p>

		<p>Rebecca stood and self-consciously turned around in place. She
		stopped and watched the gunslinger's gaze go up and down her body slowly, as if memorizing
		her. "Josie? How do I look?"</p>

		<p>"Beautiful," she replied, suddenly realizing that her
		mouth was quite dry. She swallowed and looked into the blonde's eyes, unnerved by how deep
		the green seemed to be in them, almost an emerald color. 'You are no child, Rebecca,' she
		thought to herself as her eyes drank in the vision before her. 'No child at all.'
		"You'll be the prettiest one there," she said with a teasing glint in her eyes.
		"Now just try not to get sauce all over the front of your dress. I know how you
		eat." She followed her words up with hand gestures depicting a most unladylike manner
		of eating.</p>

		<p>"Oh, you...." Rebecca huffed playfully. "This from
		the woman who makes noises with her armpits."</p>

		<p>"Hey, I told you I have many skills."</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, and that's one that'll be sure to land you a
		husband." She didn't understand the knowing smirk that came to the gunslinger's lips.
		Rebecca was about to comment on the look when the church bell chimed off in the distance,
		drawing her attention to the time.</p>

		<p>"Oh no, he's going to be here any second," she gasped
		as she raced around in search of the brush. "Oh Josie, my hair is a mess and-"</p>

		<p>"Relax, Rebecca. Here." She pulled the brush out from
		the saddlebag and walked over to the window. "Stand here and watch for him. I'll take
		care of your hair."</p>

		<p>As promised, Josie gently brushed Rebecca's hair while the blonde
		watched the street below. The green eyes were half-closed in enjoyment of the unexpected
		luxury of having someone else do her hair. Long fingers aided the brush through the soft
		blonde hair. The strokes were far gentler than she had ever done for herself and Rebecca
		made a mental note to ask her to do it again sometime, perhaps in exchange for a backrub.
		Josie always did like backrubs. The young woman smiled at the thought. She enjoyed giving
		massages to the gunslinger, to run her fingers over the strong muscles, to hear the soft
		murmur of relaxation that came from her mouth. She wished Josie would ask for one more
		often, not just when she was in pain.</p>

		<p>The sound of a wagon approaching drew her focus away from the
		spot on the wall it had strayed to during the brushing and back down to the street below.
		"He's here," she whispered nervously, pulling the gunslinger from her musings as
		well.</p>

		<p>"Oh," Josie replied, setting the brush down on the
		table. She put her hands on Rebecca's shoulders and turned the smaller woman to face her.
		"Listen to me. Have fun, enjoy yourself, but be careful." She didn't even
		realize that her voice was in 'mother' mode. "I know you're a grown woman and what
		you do is your business, but remember that you don't have to do anything that you don't
		want to do."</p>

		<p>"Yes, mother.", Rebecca said with a smile as she tried
		to cover up her nervousness. It didn't work.</p>

		<p>"You'll be fine; stop worrying," Josie said
		reassuringly. "You'd better go before he thinks you've stood him up."</p>

		<p>"Oh...bye," she said as she headed out the door, only
		to turn around and give her friend a quick hug. "I'll be back early...I
		promise." Then in a rustle of skirts, she was gone .</p>

		<p>Josie stood at the window, watching as Lance put a soapbox on the
		ground for Rebecca to use as a step to get into the wagon. Despite her upbringing, Rebecca
		acted every bit the proper lady, holding her hand out to be assisted up the step, sitting
		with her hands crossed over each other in her lap. The only thing missing was a hat.
		'Damn, forgot about the hat', Josie thought to herself. 'How could I forget that? Oh,
		Rebecca, I hope no one mentions it.' She watched the wagon until it was no longer in sight
		before turning away from the window. Josie lay down on the bed with her fingers interlaced
		behind her head, staring at nothing. What had happened at the saloon? Why did she get so
		angry whenever she saw them together? She blew stray strands of hair out of her eyes as
		she let out an exasperated sigh. She should be happy that Rebecca had found a nice young
		man to give her attention. From what the gunslinger could gather about the young woman's
		past, something not spoken of any more than her own, she wasn't used to receiving such
		positive attention. Josie rubbed her eyes. Sitting here staring at the ceiling wasn't
		going to help her understand. She rose to her feet and set out for the saloon.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The wagon moved slowly out of town, the pale gray of evening
		settling around them like a dark blanket. "You look very beautiful," Lance said
		as he admired the vision sitting next to him.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Rebecca replied softly, finding herself
		unexpectedly shy. "Lance, you don't sound like you come from these parts. Where are
		you from originally?"</p>

		<p>"Well, our family is from back east, near Albany. We moved
		out here about two years ago. Pop was a banker; came out here to settle down and raise
		cattle," he looked out at the setting sun. "Don't think he expected it to be so
		hard, though." He smiled and took her hands in his hand, the reins tangling between
		them. "But I guess it's worth it to see such a pretty girl as yourself. But how'd you
		know we weren't from around here?"</p>

		<p>"Your accent," she replied. "You have one, even if
		you don't realize it.</p>

		<p>Like coffee. You pronounce it caw-fee."</p>

		<p>"I do not have an accent," he said indignantly.
		"Only people from the south and from New England have accents."</p>

		<p>"You do. Listen...coffee...walk...you say them," she
		said. He repeated the words. "See? Caw-fee and wok. You have an accent.", she
		said triumphantly. Lance nodded in defeat.</p>

		<p>"I didn't know. You're very intelligent as well as
		beautiful, Rebecca.", he pulled her hand up for a kiss. She smiled, thinking how nice
		the attention was, then discreetly pulled her hand away, thinking that a refined lady
		would do the same. Lance smiled and untangled the reins, shifting in his seat and leaning
		forward to watch the road in the dimming light. For several minutes there was no sound
		save the steady rhythm of the horses hooves against the ground and the creak of the wagon.
		"Rebecca, if she's not your mother, then why do you travel with her?" he sat up
		in his seat and looked at her. "You have to admit she's not like most women."</p>

		<p>Rebecca grinned. "No, she's not. But that's part of what
		makes her so special. She is different. Maybe she doesn't fit into the mold of a perfect
		lady, but generally, I think proper ladies are boring. Josie's fun; you never know what to
		expect next from her. It's exciting." She didn't even realize how big her smile was
		when she spoke of her friend, but he noticed.</p>

		<p>"She looks like the kind that likes trouble. Seems to me
		you'd be better off settling down somewhere."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'll settle down eventually. I just haven't seen enough
		of the world to decide what I want to be yet."</p>

		<p>"Want to be? What do you mean, want to be? Don't you want to
		be a wife and mother like all women?"</p>

		<p>"Well, of course I do, Lance," she said huffily, not at
		all happy about having to defend herself. "It's just that I want more than that.
		Lance, I want to learn about medicine; how to help the sick and injured. I want to do more
		than cook and clean and raise babies," she quieted down as they passed through the
		gates to the ranch.</p>

		<p>"Seems to me that's all any woman would want," he said,
		keeping his eyes straight ahead as his perfect vision was shattered.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"You didn't remind me about a hat," Josie growled to
		Sandy as she entered the saloon and bellied up to the bar. "What if someone says
		something to her?"</p>

		<p>"Josie..." Sandy motioned behind the gunslingers back
		at the barkeep to bring the bottle along with the glass he was holding. "I didn't
		think about the hat. She'll be fine. Rebecca certainly is pretty enough to go without a
		hat." She poured a glass of whiskey and pushed it in front of the raven-headed woman.</p>

		<p>"Did you find the boots you were looking for?"</p>

		<p>"Yes." The blue eyes lit up with rare excitement.
		"They fit her perfectly. You should see them, Sandy; nice white leather with
		shimmering white buttons like pearls. She looked so nice in them and in the dress too. You
		had her size right." Josie stopped when she realized just how much she had said and
		how she had said it. She quickly drained her glass and refilled it.</p>

		<p>"I wish I had remembered the damned hat," she mumbled
		into the glass.</p>

		<p>"Next time you'll remember the hat, Josie. In the meantime,
		the girl is out having fun, why don't you? There's fresh cigars in my desk and the pool
		table is free," she suggested, trying hard to keep the smirk off of her face. The
		tall gunslinger was acting like a typical mother worrying about her child's first date.
		'That girl's got something on you Josie, I can feel it,' the madam thought to herself.
		'You've changed and I'd swear on a stack of bibles held by Saint Peter himself that it's
		all because of that girl.'</p>

		<p>"Fine...beats sitting around here looking at all these
		codgers," Josie grumbled, breaking Sandy out of her reverie. The gunslinger grabbed
		the nearly full bottle and they headed for the back room.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Rebecca, this is my mother and father, Mister and Mrs. Jon
		Van Doren."</p>

		<p>Lance turned to face his parents. "Mother, Father, this is
		Rebecca."</p>

		<p>Mr. Van Doren kissed the back of Rebecca's hand, and Mrs. Van
		Doren smiled and said, "Nice to meet you, Rebecca...?"</p>

		<p>"Cameron, Rebecca Cameron. Pleasure to meet you as
		well," she replied, leaning down to accept the offered kiss on the cheek.</p>

		<p>"Ah, well now Rebecca, we've met before, haven't we?"
		Lance's father asked. Like his son, he never forgot a pretty face.</p>

		<p>"Yes, at the theater," she replied, instantly
		regretting it when she saw the look on the older woman's face, that of a cat about to
		pounce on an unsuspecting mouse.</p>

		<p>"Ah yes, the theater. Lovely establishment, wouldn't you
		say? Not nearly as grand as say, the Palace, but still rather nice for such a rustic
		area." She turned to see if there was anyone around who was more important she could
		talk with, and finding none, she returned her attention to the young woman.</p>

		<p>"What were we talking about? Oh yes, the theater. You were
		there with your mother, weren't you?" Lance opened his mouth to correct her, but shut
		it when he felt the gentle poke in his side.</p>

		<p>"The actors were very funny, didn't you think?" Rebecca
		asked, trying desperately to change the subject.</p>

		<p>"The actors? Oh, I suppose so." She dismissed the topic
		with a wave of her hand as if it was not even worth discussing, and then went on.
		"But tell me dear, why does your mother wear your father's clothes? And in
		public?" she said in a disapproving tone. Rebecca's mind raced quickly as she tried
		to come up with an acceptable explanation.</p>

		<p>"Oh, well, you see...that's for my benefit. You see, if
		people see her like that with me, well, they just assume that she's a man and they don't
		bother me. Mother's just trying to protect my virtue." She smiled, trying to look as
		innocent and ladylike as possible.</p>

		<p>"Ah, I knew there had to be some explanation." Her
		curiosity satisfied she turned to her husband. "Come along now, Jon. We have others
		to attend to." Mrs. Van Doren gave Rebecca a smile that looked as if it were made of
		paste, and hooking her arm through her husbands, she propelled him off in the direction of
		a small crowd of people who had just arrived.</p>

		<p>"Sorry about that," Lance said once his parents were
		out of earshot.</p>

		<p>"Mother can be a bit...nosy at times."</p>

		<p>"It's all right," Rebecca replied. The smell of fresh
		ribs cooking assailed her nose. "Mmm, smells wonderful," she said sincerely.</p>

		<p>"Oh, you haven't lived until you taste Pedro's cooking. His
		ribs melt in your mouth," he chuckled. "Of course, you'd better make sure you
		have a tall glass of water next to you. It's a bit spicy."</p>

		<p>"I can handle spicy, Lance. One time, my father came home
		from the trading post with a small little pepper and gosh was it hot."</p>

		<p>"Well, I guess you can handle Pedro's sauce then. Come on,
		let's see if we can get some before the ranch hands take it all."</p>

		<p>"You think she's having a nice time?" Josie asked
		absentmindedly for the fifth time in the last hour.</p>

		<p>"Josie, she's fine. She'll be back anytime now, I'm sure of
		it. Just relax," Sandy said with a sigh pulling two thin cigars out of a humidor on
		the desk. "Now I think I've seen his family around here before. Don't get out much,
		ya know. They look like real nice people. I'm sure she's just fine," she said as she
		handed the cue ball to the gunslinger. "I do believe it's your shot."</p>

		<p>"Yeah," Josie replied noncommittally. To herself she
		wondered, 'are you safe, sprite? Are you all right? Please be careful.'</p>

		<p>"Did you enjoy yourself, Rebecca?" he asked as they
		walked near the stable.</p>

		<p>"Yes I did, thank you. The food was wonderful, and the
		company was nice too," she said shyly, turning her head away slightly.</p>

		<p>"Yes it was," he said, his voice slightly deeper than
		before. They were standing just outside the stable. Lance moved, positioning her between
		him and the wall of the building. "Rebecca..." he said as he moved closer,
		causing her to back up against the whitewashed wood. "You are very pretty." He
		had noticed the way she smiled earlier that night whenever he said that and he tried to
		use it to his advantage now. "Your lips, they were made for kissing." He ran his
		thumb across her lower lip, causing her heart to pick up its beat slightly. Rebecca looked
		at him uncertainly not knowing what to do or say, afraid she was about to be kissed and
		afraid that she wasn't.</p>

		<p>"Oh?" was all she could think of to say. Lance smiled.</p>

		<p>"Yeah." He bent down and pressed his lips to hers,
		pushing her harder against the wall. His arms came out to rest against the wood on either
		side of her head. "Rebecca..." he whispered as he came up for air before
		planting another firm kiss against her mouth. She felt his tongue slip past his lips,
		demanding entry.</p>

		<p>"No," she said as she pressed her hands against his
		chest, trying to back him away from her. Lance didn't back up, but he made no effort to
		continue.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca ...all girls kiss," he said as if stating the
		obvious.</p>

		<p>"I did kiss you...but I don't want to do...that," she
		said, wishing that Josie was there at that moment. "Lance, a real gentleman wouldn't
		try to push a lady further than she wanted to go."</p>

		<p>He ran his fingers through his brown hair as he tried to maintain
		control. This small blonde woman was so tempting. He longed to taste her mouth, to take
		her to his bed. She would be a good mother, he thought as he looked at the womanly flare
		of her hips. His mother always said to look at their hips; the larger they were, the
		better for bearing children. Rebecca's hips weren't that wide, but certainly looked nice
		enough to keep the flames going for quite some time. Lance smiled at her and placed his
		hand beside her head again, leaning in ever so slightly. "I'm not trying to push you,
		sweet Rebecca. I am, after all, nothing if not a gentleman." He made no effort to
		change his position just as she made no effort to remove her hands from his chest, lest he
		move forward to kiss her again. "But you need to understand that when a man kisses
		you, you have to let him kiss you the way he wants to. Have you ever been kissed like that
		before?"</p>

		<p>"N-no. Lance, I think I'd better get back now," she
		tried to duck under his arms but he was too fast for her. He quickly wrapped his arms
		around her and held her close.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...I'm not trying to rape you, I just want a
		kiss." He brought his mouth to hers again, this time with more authority. He forced
		her mouth open with his tongue, yelping and letting go of her when he felt the bite of her
		teeth on his lower lip. "Ow...you bitch," he spat, his hand going to his tender
		lip.</p>

		<p>"I said no," she said nervously, visions of the women
		of Rosewood and the things that Lefty's men did to them filling her mind, making panic
		rise in her throat.</p>

		<p>"Well...I guess you did, didn't you?" he said in a
		defeated tone. "If that's how you want to be...." Rebecca understood the
		implication. He wasn't interested in her anymore. He looked over at the crowd of ranch
		hands milling about. "Hey Matt!" he called. One of the men separated himself
		from the crowd and began walking their way. "Matt will take you home," he said,
		effectively dismissing her as he walked to meet with the ranch hand. He said a few words
		to the man, gesturing in her direction, and without a backward glance he rejoined the
		celebration up at the main house. Matt looked apologetic as he escorted her to the wagons
		and helped her into the one the ranch hands used for hauling hay about the fields.</p>

		<p>"Sorry ma'am. This here's the only one that Mr. Van Doren
		lets us use. Seat's pretty clean, though," he pulled out his handkerchief and wiped
		the wooden seat before she sat down anyway. "I'll have you home in no time." He
		sat down and snapped the reins, sending the horse into motion. Rebecca remained quiet on
		the way back, wishing only to be back with Josie, to have her tell her that she'd done
		nothing wrong, and that everything would be all right, but mostly just to be with her.</p>

		<p>Josie paced back and forth from the window to the door of the
		back room.</p>

		<p>Sandy looked at the clock nervously. It was after ten and there
		was no sign of Rebecca. A half dozen whores sat around playing cards. The menacing look of
		the gunslinger had driven away most of the evening's business since she had come out of
		the back room shortly after eight and began her relentless pacing. "Josie, please
		come sit down...you're making me dizzy."</p>

		<p>"How much longer can she possibly be? She said she'd be back
		early," the gunslinger growled. The creak of a wagon in the distance drew her back to
		the window. "She's back," Josie said with relief evident in her voice, and she
		headed for the door.</p>

		<p>"Good night," Sandy said to the retreating form.</p>

		<p>Josie made it back to the boarding house a minute or two before
		Rebecca. She had the lamp turned up and was sitting in the chair, waiting for the young
		woman to come upstairs and tell her about her evening. She listened to the rhythm of the
		young woman's steps in the hall. They stopped at the door, but Rebecca didn't enter
		immediately. Seconds passed as Josie waited for the blonde to open the door. A grave fear
		set in as the gunslinger leapt from her chair and opened the door. Instantly Rebecca was
		in her arms, sobbing shamelessly. Josie's body softened immediately as she enveloped the
		young woman in her arms and closed the door. She led them to the bed and sat down, keeping
		her arms around Rebecca. Anger, fear, concern, and a twinge of guilt for not being there
		all filled the gunslinger as she waited for the tears and ragged breathing to cease and
		her friend to be able to speak again.</p>

		<p>It was several minutes before Rebecca calmed down enough to
		speak. Josie had spent the time holding her, doing her best to keep her anger in check and
		promising herself that Lance would suffer if he hurt her friend in any way. Slowly the
		tears and haggard breathing eased to a point where Josie felt comfortable letting go.
		"What happened?", the gunslinger asked tentatively, not fully certain she wanted
		to know the answer. Her eyes inspected Rebecca, noting no tears in the dress, nor bruising
		anywhere, except perhaps her lips. The young woman took a shaky breath before speaking,
		her eyes fixed upon a spot on the floor.</p>

		<p>"He kissed me," she said softly. "I wanted him to,
		but..." her voice trailed off. Josie placed her fingers on the young woman's chin and
		forced her to meet her gaze.</p>

		<p>"But what, Rebecca? What did he do?" She fought to keep
		her anger in check and not let it show in her voice. "Tell me," she said softly.</p>

		<p>"He tried..." she paused but didn't turn away. Josie
		swore she could see the young woman gathering the strength to speak. "He tried to
		kiss me more than I wanted...and when I said no, he...he got mad and had one of the men
		drive me home."</p>

		<p>"He wasn't man enough to escort you home?" This time
		Josie made no effort to hide her anger, only the intensity of it.</p>

		<p>"But he had Matt bring me...he's a nice fellow." She
		saw no change in the gunslinger's expression. "Josie, he didn't try anything. Matt
		was a perfect gentleman."</p>

		<p>"Shame Lance wasn't," she growled, rising and going to
		the window. It was taking great effort to stay in the room and not go knock some sense
		into the young man, or just knock him around. A very unpleasant thought came to her.
		"Rebecca ...is there anything else? I mean did he try to touch you?" It was an
		effort to get the words out.</p>

		<p>"No," was the soft reply. Josie visibly relaxed and
		returned to the bed. Without thought, she put her arm around Rebecca's shoulders and
		pulled her in for another hug.</p>

		<p>"It's all right now, sprite. You're safe here," she
		whispered into the younger woman's ear. "I wish it had gone better."</p>

		<p>"I had a nice time otherwise," Rebecca offered, trying
		to lighten the mood. "They have a cook, Pedro. He makes the best barbecue ribs...
		they were so good."</p>

		<p>"How many racks did you eat, my little eating
		machine?", the gunslinger teased good-naturedly, also trying to eradicate the somber
		mood. The young woman smiled and wiped her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I only had a few pieces. Had to act like a lady, after all.
		</p>

		<p>Oh, they had a small band there, too..." She went on for
		several minutes describing the rest of the party, deliberately leaving out her
		conversation with Lance's mother. She let out a long yawn in the middle of describing the
		ranch itself.</p>

		<p>"I think it's time for bed," Josie said as she rose to
		her feet.</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded and reached down to unbutton her boots. Without a
		word, the gunslinger dropped to the floor and made quick work of the buttons.</p>

		<p>"Thanks." She picked one of the boots up and stared at
		it thoughtfully. "You know, Josie, someday I'm going to give you something. Something
		that only I can give you. Something irreplaceable." She gingerly ran her fingers over
		the leather of the boot. "Something that makes you feel as special as I do tonight.
		You didn't have to get me these beautiful boots, you didn't have to find me the
		dress." Before Josie could react, Rebecca put her arms around her and gave her a
		loving embrace. "Someday...."</p>

		<p>Josie looked down at the blonde head resting under her chin. She
		thought back over the last few months, trying to pinpoint exactly when the young woman in
		her arms slipped past her defenses and became such an important part of her life, not just
		an unexpected burden. She tightened her grip slightly, smiling to herself when she felt it
		returned. "Come on, sprite. You've had a long day. Let's get you to bed."</p>

		<p>Long after Rebecca had fallen under the sandman's spell, Josie
		laid awake trying to quell the anger that burned inside her. Despite the young woman's
		protests that he did nothing other than try to kiss her more than she wanted to, the
		gunslinger still felt an almost uncontrollable rage towards him. How dare he try to force
		his way on Rebecca. Only when she looked at the angelic face sleeping beside her did Josie
		feel any sense of calm. Moving gently as so not to disturb her, the gunslinger curled her
		body around Rebecca's and soon joined her in sleep.</p>

		<p>After breakfast, they went to the saloon to return the dress and
		to visit with their friends. Sandy adamantly refused to accept the garment, citing that it
		had been collecting dust in the closet for months after its original owner left. She gave
		Rebecca a small carpetbag to keep the dress in while they traveled. Josie sat at a table
		with three other women, intent on playing a few hands of poker while the young blonde went
		upstairs to visit with Stacey and Victoria, both of whom had remained in their rooms.</p>

		<p>"Full house," Elaine said triumphantly as she lay her
		cards down and reached for the pot. Despite having a flush in her hand, Josie tossed her
		cards down. Something else had captured her interest.</p>

		<p>"I'll be back," she said firmly as she rose from her
		chair and stormed out the door. Elaine and the others looked at each other for just a
		brief moment before the black headed woman went in search of Sandy. She had no idea who or
		what the tall woman had seen, but whatever it was, the gunslinger was most definitely
		angry when she left.</p>

		<p>Lance stepped down from the wooden walk in front of the
		mercantile, totally oblivious to his surroundings. The next thing he knew, he was being
		thrown hard against the side of the building, an extremely angry woman in black glaring at
		him, her hands clenching the front of his shirt. There was a fire in the ice blue eyes, a
		fire that was reserved for him and he knew it. Never in his young life had he felt so much
		fear as he did at that very moment. "I-I-I...." he stammered helplessly.</p>

		<p>"You are a very lucky man, you know that?" Josie
		growled, pushing him against the wall again for emphasis. "I don't like men who try
		to take advantage of young women, especially...my...friend." She accentuated the last
		three words with little shoves into his chest, each shove slamming him hard against the
		wood.</p>

		<p>"I-I...all I did was kiss her," he cried, his eyes
		darting around in a vain attempt to find someone to help him. "I swear I didn't try
		anything else, I swear!"</p>

		<p>"If you had tried something else..." Josie moved close,
		her face scant inches away from his. "...the only 'lance' you would have left is the
		one in your signature." She looked down at his crotch, then back up at his face, and
		arched an eyebrow. "Got it?"</p>

		<p>He swallowed nervously as beads of nervous perspiration rolled
		off his brow. Josie pulled him forward slightly and shoved him against the wall again,
		slightly harder than before. She knew he would end up with little more than a few bruises
		on his shoulder blades and perhaps a ruined pair of britches, but in her eyes, that was a
		small price to pay for making Rebecca's first date an unpleasant experience. "Rebecca
		is a very forgiving person, but I'm not. Be thankful that you get to walk away with all
		your body parts intact." She gave him one more shove and then let go of his shirt.
		"Hurt her again and I swear you won't live to regret it."</p>

		<p>Lance slumped down on the ground next to the wall, grateful to be
		alive. Josie gave him one more menacing stare before turning to head back to the saloon.
		She stopped short when she saw Rebecca standing at the mouth of the alleyway staring at
		her. Neither paid any attention as the scared young man quickly took his leave, smartly
		heading in the opposite direction. Josie approached her, trying to keep her face as
		expressionless as possible despite the gnawing fear that the young woman would think her
		little more than an animal for attacking him. By the time the gunslinger was within
		touching distance of Rebecca, she was certain that the young woman would walk away from
		her, never to return.</p>

		<p>"How much did you see?" Josie asked, managing to avoid
		eye contact, certain of the disappointment she would find there. She was startled to feel
		a gentle touch on her forearm as Rebecca reached out to her.</p>

		<p>"Enough," she said softly. "Did you hurt
		him?"</p>

		<p>"Not nearly as much as I wanted to," the gunslinger
		admitted. "I held back."</p>

		<p>"Why? Hey..." she put her fingers on Josie's cheek.
		"...look at me...that's better. Why did you hold back? Because of me?" she asked
		gently. The blue eyes flickered for the briefest of moments, giving Rebecca her answer.
		The unspoken admission was enough to make Josie visibly uncomfortable. The young woman
		pulled her hand back and smiled warmly, as she understood the unspoken fear. She also
		understood that her tall companion wasn't ready to voice that fear or have it voiced for
		her. This wasn't a case of the gunslinger protecting someone from harm. Rebecca realized
		that it went much deeper than that. What happened in the alleyway was revenge, pure and
		simple. Josie wanted to punish Lance for hurting her. As much as the thought of physical
		violence bothered her, Rebecca nevertheless felt a warm, comfortable feeling at the
		knowledge that the gunslinger cared enough about her to do such a thing. She captured the
		blue eyes with her own. "I'm glad you didn't beat the stuffing out of him, even if he
		did deserve it."</p>

		<p>The words eased the tightness that Josie was feeling in her
		chest, as she understood that Rebecca wasn't upset with her. "I wanted to, you know.
		I wanted to push his little head right through the wall." Her muscled forearms tensed
		as she remembered the feeling of slamming him against the wooden side of the building.</p>

		<p>"I know you did, Josie. But don't you see? You didn't. You
		didn't hurt him; well not badly anyway, and you didn't lose control," she said
		reassuringly, frowning when she noticed that the gunslinger's jaw was still clenched as
		tightly as her fists. "Josie, you're not the monster people think you are or even you
		think you are. What you did today wasn't done out of anger or hatred, it was done out of
		care and concern for another human being." She touched the gunslinger's arm again and
		maintained the contact, wrapping her small fingers around the powerful wrist. "For
		me," Rebecca said softly, almost in awe that her sadness could affect Josie so.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger cleared her throat and politely pulled her arm
		back, the emotions becoming too much for her once again. "I don't think you have to
		worry about old lance in the pants again."</p>

		<p>"Josie!" Rebecca said, shocked at her friend's comment.
		"I don't believe you said that. How awful." A huge grin broke out on her face as
		she thought about the comment some more. The grin turned into a smile, which in turn
		became a giggle. She swatted her tall friend's arm playfully. "You are bad."</p>

		<p>"Stick around me and you'll learn just how bad I can
		be," Josie said wickedly. "Come on, I'll buy you a drink. If you're a good girl
		I'll even teach you how to play pool."</p>

		<p>"Really?" Rebecca said excitedly. "You would,
		really? Teach me, I mean."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled at the childish look of excitement in her friend's
		face. "Rebecca, I'll teach you how to play pool and anything else you want. I warn
		you though, I'm a hard taskmaster; worse than Belle."</p>

		<p>"If you're my teacher, I don't think I'll mind. I'm a fast
		learner, you'll see," she said enthusiastically. "I won't let you down."</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you won't," Josie agreed as they entered the
		saloon.</p>

	<chapter title="34: Endings and Beginnings">
		<p>"They want to leave?", Josie asked as she took her
		shot, sinking</p>

		<p>the four ball cleanly in the corner pocket.</p>

		<p>"Yup. Both of them. I can understand Stacey, what with the
		shooting and all," Sandy replied as she watched the seven ball fall into the side
		pocket. "And Victoria, well, I think your Rebecca had something to do with that. She
		said she wasn't doing no more whoring."</p>

		<p>"What is she going to do?" She passed the cue back to
		the blonde madam and ignored the 'your Rebecca' remark. "From what I understand, she
		doesn't have any skills."</p>

		<p>"I don't know, Josie. She's still young. Maybe she can find
		herself a man and have a family." She bent over and took aim. "Of course she
		can't do that around here; someone might pass through town and recognize her from
		Rosewood." Sandy pulled her arm back and let loose, sending two balls into the
		pocket. Unfortunately, one of them was the cue ball. Josie held her hand out for the
		stick, her face an unreadable mask.</p>

		<p>"Think she'd make it if she wasn't around here?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know. Even without an education, she's a smart
		girl. I imagine if she gets somewhere where she can make a new start she'd be okay,"
		the madam said. "Don't know her too well, though. You'd be better off asking Elaine
		or even Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Hmm." Josie let the conversation drop as she took her
		shot, letting out a low growl, as the eight ball bounced off the green felt bumper. She
		set the cue stick down on the pool table. "Sandy, I have to go somewhere. Keep an eye
		on Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Well, that should be no problem. She's probably with
		Victoria anyway. Where are you going?" Sandy asked.</p>

		<p>"Express office."</p>

		<p>Despite Rebecca's best efforts at dinner to get the gunslinger to
		tell her why she had to go to the express office, Josie adamantly refused. It was half
		past eight and they were settled in for the night in their room, the bounty hunter
		cleaning and polishing her guns and the young woman studying her medical text. The blonde
		head poked up from behind the large book. "Did you send a telegram somewhere?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." she warned gently.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Josie. If you'd just tell me what you were up to
		then I wouldn't bother you about it," she coaxed, anxious to quench her curiosity.
		The gunslinger merely smirked and continued to rub the cloth over the steel.</p>

		<p>"Nope.", she said smugly, watching Rebecca get more and
		more frustrated.</p>

		<p>"Josie...come on, tell me."</p>

		<p>"Nope."</p>

		<p>"Please? I'll give you a backrub."</p>

		<p>"Nope," she said, even though the offer was tempting.
		Not being on the road, there had really been no physical activity to strain her back. The
		scuffle with Lance was nothing. Josie missed those moments when she could relax and let
		her friend rub the tension out of her. But she wasn't going to give in on this one, no
		matter what Rebecca tried.</p>

		<p>"Josie...you know I'm just going to keep asking until you
		tell me, so you might as well just tell me now and get it over with," she grinned
		mischievously.</p>

		<p>"Nope."</p>

		<p>"Please?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Come on, please?" Each time she asked only served to
		make her more aggravated, much to the gunslinger's amusement. She could just imagine what
		Rebecca was like on Christmas.</p>

		<p>"I'm going downstairs to take a bath," Josie said,
		rising. The young woman was about to beg again when the words registered. Rebecca lifted
		her arm slightly and lowered it quickly. The hot afternoon had done nothing to help her
		aroma.</p>

		<p>"Um, Josie?" she asked with all seriousness, the change
		in tone drawing the gunslinger's attention to her and away from the door handle that her
		fingers were about to close on. "If you don't mind, I'll watch the door for you if
		you watch the door for me? I'd um...feel safer with you there," she said, fairly
		certain that Josie would agree, especially after the way the gunslinger reacted to seeing
		the flimsy lock yesterday. What Rebecca didn't expect was the momentary look of affection
		on her face. Josie picked up the second towel and held it out to her.</p>

		<p>"Come on," she said with a gentle smile, understanding
		what the offer truly was. 'Never fear, Rebecca; I'll always protect you,' she thought as
		she watched the young blonde grab her nightgown from the edge of the bed.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Josie, I know you sent a telegram. Come on, where'd you
		send it?" she asked through the closed door. The raven-headed woman lifted her leg
		straight up in the air.</p>

		<p>"Give up, Rebecca ...and stop yelling through the
		door," she called. "If you want to talk to me then come in here." She
		washed and lowered her leg back into the warm water. Josie watched the latch slowly lift
		and the door open. She didn't bother to twist the useless piece of wood when she entered,
		knowing full well that even without her weapons, she could handle anything that happened.
		The clawfoot tub was not really deep enough for the tall woman, causing the water to lap
		gently against the underside of her breasts. Rebecca entered and trying not to look at the
		naked woman, she crossed the room to sit on the floor with her back against the porcelain
		and steel fixture. Josie laughed lightly. "You don't have to sit on the floor,
		Rebecca. There's a perfectly good stool over there, just scootch it over."</p>

		<p>"Uh...no, I can't. I'm fine here, really," she said,
		her embarrassment showing. Josie smiled softly, although the little blonde couldn't see
		it.</p>

		<p>"You've seen me naked before, Rebecca." She did her
		best to keep her tone gentle and understanding, not wanting to do anything to further
		embarrass her young friend.</p>

		<p>"Well, yeah, but only for a few seconds while you're
		changing.</p>

		<p>We've never talked with you...like that." She kept her eyes
		focused on a knot in the door panel.</p>

		<p>"I sleep topless against you every night," Josie tried
		again.</p>

		<p>"I know...and I know I'm being silly," Rebecca said,
		turning her head toward the gunslinger, but not far enough to see anything. A long wet arm
		slipped out of the tub and lightly patted the blonde head.</p>

		<p>"It's all right, Rebecca. If you're more comfortable there,
		that's fine. I'll tell you what, why don't you tell me a story," Josie said, hoping
		to make her more comfortable. It really was annoying to have to turn around every time the
		young woman got dressed or undressed.</p>

		<p>"Which one do you want to hear?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know...tell me something I haven't heard
		before," the gunslinger replied as she lathered up the cloth until it was covered
		with a bubbly white foam. She twisted her arm up behind her and tried to wash her back,
		grunting as she stretched her fingertips to try and reach that one area that was always
		impossible to get to.</p>

		<p>"What are you doing?" Rebecca asked, getting to her
		knees as she twisted to see Josie.</p>

		<p>"Trying to wash my back, what does it look like I'm
		doing?" she replied testily.</p>

		<p>"Well, if you'd ask for help," the young woman replied
		as she rose to her feet and walked over to the corner. She picked up the stool and set it
		down at the head of the tub. "Lean forward please," Rebecca said as she took the
		soapy cloth from the long fingers and started to wash her friend's broad shoulder. Josie
		reached back and gathered the long black tresses in her hand, pulling it to one side and
		out of the way so the young woman could continue her task.</p>

		<p>Rebecca hummed a tune as she continued to run the washcloth over
		the gunslinger's back, gently rubbing the well-defined muscles as she passed over them.
		Josie closed her eyes and let her head fall forward, her hair spilling forward, the black
		tips sinking into the soapy water. "How's that feel?"</p>

		<p>"Mmm, good," the gunslinger murmured, lulled into
		relaxation by the gentle hands sliding over her skin, aided by the soap. Rebecca dipped
		the washcloth back into the water before raising it and squeezing the water out over
		Josie's shoulder. She repeated the procedure until she was certain that every last trace
		of soap was off. Only then did she drape the cloth over the edge of the tub and sit back
		on the stool. She was disappointed slightly that it was over. Rebecca didn't know what it
		was, but there was just something so enjoyable about giving the stronger woman a massage.
		To feel those strong muscles loosen under her touch, to see the small smile that formed on
		Josie's face, to know that there was something that she could do, no matter how small,
		that made the older woman feel comfortable and relaxed. Twice that she was sure of Rebecca
		had made the gunslinger fall asleep. She wished that Josie would ask for backrubs more
		often.</p>

		<p>The raven-headed woman took the now cool cloth from the side of
		the tub. "Thanks, Rebecca," Josie said as she quickly finished up, the water now
		cooled down to an uncomfortable level. "Could you hand me the towel please?"</p>

		<p>"Oh...um, yeah." Rebecca stood up and retrieved Josie's
		towel from the shelf. She held it out and waited for the gunslinger to rise and exit the
		tub.</p>

		<p>"Thanks," Josie said as she took the towel and began
		drying off.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I forgot!" Rebecca exclaimed. "I put water on
		to heat.</p>

		<p>It's probably all boiled away by now." She couldn't keep the
		disappointment from showing on her face. She had been looking forward to soaking away all
		the sweat and dust. "I'd better go see."</p>

		<p>Josie watched the door close behind the young woman. She rolled
		her shoulders, enjoying the lack of tension within them. She picked up the clean pair of
		drawers and stepped into them, pulling them up just as she heard a soft knock on the door.
		"Josie? Can you get the door? My hands are full." The gunslinger pushed her arms
		through the sleeves of her shirt, letting it hang loosely on her body as she headed toward
		the door.</p>

		<p>The stronger woman opened the door and took the two heavy pails
		from Rebecca, careful not to pinch the blonde's fingers during the exchange. Within
		seconds, both pails were emptied into the tub, causing wisps of steam to rise. "Guess
		you didn't boil it away," she said as she set the empty containers on the floor.</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca said in a relieved tone. "I guess
		the stove wasn't that hot." She stood there for a moment and then asked hesitantly,
		"Josie...aren't you going to leave?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, I'll wait outside," she said, buttoning up her
		shirt as she headed for the door. The gunslinger had thought that the young woman had
		wanted her to stay and wash her back. 'Sprite, you really need to get over this modesty,'
		Josie thought to herself as she closed the door behind her and flopped down on the nearby
		stool. She leaned her head against the wall behind her and closed her eyes, planning on
		taking a short catnap while Rebecca soaked.</p>

		<p>Josie heard in one instant the splash of water, the startled cry,
		and the thud. She leapt to her feet and flung open the door in time to see Rebecca lying
		on the floor, one foot still on the side of the tub. "Are you all right?" the
		gunslinger asked as she knelt down next to her and helped the young woman get her leg down
		and sit up. "Did you get hurt?" she asked. Rebecca shook her head, waving her
		hand to say that she was fine.</p>

		<p>"Just my pride, I guess." A slight tinge of
		embarrassment colored her cheeks. She drew her knees up and rested her arms on her knees,
		her back against the tub. "I'm fine, Josie." She looked at the door expectantly.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." she said sternly. "If you think I'm
		going to take a chance of you falling again, you're sadly mistaken. You're lucky you
		didn't crack your head on the side of the tub." The gunslinger felt her heartbeat
		slowly return to normal. Once she had slipped in a tub and been knocked out; only her long
		frame kept her from slipping under the water and drowning. Josie stood up and held her
		hand out.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine. Go on, I'll be all right now," Rebecca said,
		not moving from her position against the tub. The gunslinger noted that the young woman's
		position did nothing to hide her personal areas from view. She knew that Rebecca had to be
		a bit shook up from the fall, but it still didn't make sense that she made no attempt to
		cover herself yet still insisted on being left alone.</p>

		<p>"Stand up and let me help you into the tub," she said
		firmly, regretting her tone the instant she saw the sad look in the green eyes. For a long
		moment, neither moved from her respective position. Rebecca reached out tentatively and
		took Josie's hand, allowing the taller woman to help her to her feet. She faced the
		gunslinger, green eyes locking with blue as she lifted one leg up and into the slippery
		tub. She felt the strong hand grip hers tighter as she lifted the other leg and stepped
		in. Rebecca twisted and sat down in the tub careful not to move so fast as to make the
		water splash out. She leaned her back against the slight slant of the end and looked up at
		Josie. "I'm in now," she said, stating the obvious.</p>

		<p>"I see that," the gunslinger said as she moved to the
		head of the tub and sat down on the stool. "Since I'm here I might as well wash your
		back, seeing as how you washed mine."</p>

		<p>"Josie?" came the small voice, "I-I don't want you
		to, okay?"</p>

		<p>Instantly the raven headed woman moved to the side of the tub and
		knelt down until she was eye level with the now visibly upset woman. Josie folded her arms
		and leaned against the cool porcelain, her face showing her concern. "What's got you
		so scared, sprite? What are you afraid of me finding out?" she asked gently, silently
		willing her friend to confide in her, to trust her with whatever was wrong. A thought
		occurred to her. "Rebecca, are you afraid of me?"</p>

		<p>"No!" she sat up and caught the blue eyes with her own.
		"It's not you, Josie, honest," the blonde lowered her head, staring at her hands
		underwater. It took only seconds for Rebecca to lose the battle to control her emotions.
		Her heart told her to take the chance and a small voice in her mind screamed at her not to
		tell. The green eyes closed yet the tears still came unbidden, leaking out to leave wet
		trails down her cheeks.</p>

		<p>Rebecca found herself instantly enfolded in strong,
		flannel-covered arms. Her tears gave way to outright sobs and she wrapped her arms around
		Josie's neck, squeezing tightly. The gunslinger held her, unmindful of the hard tub
		pressing against her ribs. Nothing mattered except trying to get her friend calmed down.
		Josie pulled her closer, the shift causing her to look over the blonde's shoulder and
		there she saw what had gotten her so upset.</p>

		<p>There was no need for words; the faded scars told the tale all
		too clearly. Josie swallowed and took a deep breath to quell her rising anger and outrage
		at the sight. She felt the small woman stiffen in her arms and she held tight. "No,
		it's okay, sprite. It's okay. I know." She repeated the words over and over like a
		mantra into the young woman's ear, rocking her gently in the process. Josie was dimly
		aware of a growing pain in her ribs from the tub, but chose to ignore it. Her friend was
		more important at the moment.</p>

		<p>In the darkness of the older woman's comforting shoulder, Rebecca
		cried. She cried for the pain of a young girl who only wanted to be loved. She cried for
		the loss of happiness and joy within herself at the hands of those who were supposed to
		protect and care for her. She cried until no more tears were left; only the feeling of a
		great weight removed from her. Rebecca took several deep haggard breaths before pulling
		back from Josie's embrace. They sat there silently, both needing time to compose
		themselves. The bounty hunter's hand went to her own ribs, touching lightly and wincing at
		the pain. She didn't realize how hard she had been pressing against the tub. "You
		okay?" Rebecca asked softly, her voice a bit raspy.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine. What about you?" Josie asked as she moved
		back to the stool, her back protesting from being kept in that position for so long.</p>

		<p>The young woman nodded slightly, both knowing that it wasn't the
		complete truth. "This water's getting cold."</p>

		<p>"Well then let's get you washed up quickly, shall we?"
		Josie replied, grabbing the soapy washcloth. With the gentleness of a washerwoman cleaning
		the floor, she scrubbed the smaller woman's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Hey!"</p>

		<p>"Sorry," she replied, leaning forward and giving
		Rebecca a lopsided grin. "I guess I'm not used to washing other people. I'll go
		easier."</p>

		<p>Josie wrapped the cloth around two of her fingers and gently
		rubbed the young woman's other shoulder, using small circular motions. Her lips set in a
		tight line when her hand passed over the most prominent streak of white against Rebecca's
		skin. 'I guess you're not such an innocent after all, are you sprite?' she thought. 'You
		should have been protected from him, from his rage. How could anyone raise his hand to
		someone as gentle and caring as you?' "Never again," she said, realizing that
		she had spoken aloud.</p>

		<p>"What?" Rebecca asked as she turned in the tub to face
		her. Josie handed her the washcloth and forced a smile.</p>

		<p>"I said I'm done. Finish up," the gunslinger lied. She
		waited until the young woman was done and helped her out of the tub before leaving her to
		dry off and get dressed.</p>

		<p>Leaning against the wall outside the washroom, Josie's mind raced
		while she waited for Rebecca to finish. She tried to think of all the reasons why having
		the young woman stay with her was no good. It was too dangerous. She could get hurt. A
		dozen reasons later, Josie rubbed her face with her hands vigorously and sighed. The
		decision was made.</p>

		<p>Once in their room, Josie turned the lamp down and joined Rebecca
		in bed. As had quickly become the habit, the gunslinger wrapped her arm around the smaller
		woman's waist and curled up against her back. Both lay there, wide-awake and deep in
		thought. "Can't sleep?" the blonde inquired. Josie propped herself up on one
		elbow and looked down at Rebecca, who rolled onto her back to look at her companion.</p>

		<p>"Do you..." the gunslinger began. "Do you want to
		stay with me?</p>

		<p>Traveling from place to place with no roots and no home? Is that
		what you want?"</p>

		<p>"Josie...I had a home and a family and I was
		miserable." She lowered her eyes. "I want to stay with you, if you'll let
		me." Rebecca wanted to plead, to beg, to offer anything just to continue being with
		her friend, her protector. But she held back, still not daring to hope that Josie wanted
		the same thing.</p>

		<p>"You know it's dangerous...you can get hurt, or worse."</p>

		<p>"I could get hurt or worse anywhere."</p>

		<p>"Don't you want to settle down? Raise a family?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca raised herself up on one elbow, her face inches away from
		the gunslingers. "Josie, I'm not ready to settle down yet. There's too much to see,
		too much to do. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. Neither one of us has to
		be alone again." She lowered her head, her voice quavering as she continued. "I
		don't want to go back, Josie. If you don't want me to stay with you then leave me here,
		but I won't go back to Chancetown...I-I can't."</p>

		<p>"No. I won't let them hurt you again, Rebecca. Never
		again." Josie said firmly, her own outrage and anger at her friend's pain showing
		through. "I can't promise that it'll always be easy."</p>

		<p>"Are you saying that I can stay with you?" she asked
		hopefully.</p>

		<p>"Yes," was all the gunslinger could get out before she
		was knocked onto her back by the smaller woman's fierce hug. Rebecca held on tight, her
		emotions a mixture of relief and joy. Josie smiled in the darkness, feeling her own sense
		of joy at the young woman's reaction. She wrapped her own arms around Rebecca. "Yes,
		sprite, you can stay with me. I won't make you leave, I swear."</p>

		<p>Long after the young woman had fallen asleep in her arms, Josie
		lay awake, her own emotions still churning about. Her head and heart warred with each
		other over her decision, her mind telling her that someone as gentle and caring as Rebecca
		could only get hurt being around her and her heart quietly saying that she had no other
		choice. She looked down at the sleeping blonde, noting the soft smile that graced her lips
		and the gentle, even breathing of a most peaceful rest. "Neither one of us will be
		alone again. I'll die to protect you," Josie whispered before placing a soft kiss on
		the young woman's forehead and settling down to let sleep claim her.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca woke to find herself alone, a cool cup of coffee waiting
		for her on the table. She stretched and yawned, wondering where the gunslinger went at
		such an early hour. "Damn," she swore when she realized. She peeled off her
		nightgown, not bothering to notice where it landed, and quickly dressed.</p>

		<p>Josie exited the express office, telegram and draft note in hand.
		</p>

		<p>"You gonna tell me now?" She turned to see Rebecca
		sitting on the small bench next to the doorway. The young woman hopped up and stood beside
		the gunslinger, trying her hardest to steal a peek at the note.</p>

		<p>"Nope," Josie said as she folded up the papers and
		tucked them into her vest pocket. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught the frustrated
		and furious look on her young friend's face and smirked.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." She followed the gunslinger up the street,
		walking quickly to keep up with the taller woman's longer stride. "Josie...you know
		you can trust me with anything...Josie are you listening to me? What is it? Friends share
		things, you know...come on, Josie..." All she heard was a deep, throaty chuckle from
		the woman in black.</p>

		<p>Sandy watched the tall woman enter with a bemused expression on
		her face, followed closely by Rebecca, who was pestering her about something. "Why
		won't you tell me? Come on, Josie, I'm no good at surprises."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, go get Stacey and Victoria and have them meet us
		in the back room," Josie said just as Sandy reached them. "I swear I'll tell you
		what's in the note then."</p>

		<p>"Oh, okay," the young woman replied, a bit
		disappointed. "You wait, Josie," she said as she reached the stairs.
		"Someday I'm gonna have a secret and you just see if you can get it out of me,"
		she said smugly, although deep down inside she knew that she'd probably have a hard time
		keeping anything from Josie if she really wanted to know.</p>

		<p>Sandy and the gunslinger entered the back room and waited for the
		others to arrive. Josie leaned against the pool table, one leg bent and resting on the
		green felt. The madam frowned but said nothing, choosing instead to take a seat on the
		couch. Stacey, Victoria, and Rebecca entered, the two prostitutes choosing to stand at the
		end of the billiard table while the young blonde stood next to Josie. The tall woman
		looked at the two women at the end of the table. "I understand you both want to
		leave, to go somewhere and make a fresh start." Both women nodded in agreement. A
		rare public smile formed on Josie's face as she pulled the notes out of her pocket and
		unfolded them. She passed the telegram to Stacey. "There are jobs waiting for both of
		you as well as a place to stay," the gunslinger said. The redhead read the note aloud
		for Victoria.</p>

		<p>"J MOST PLEASED TO HEAR FROM YOU STOP ARRANGEMENTS MADE STOP</p>

		<p>REPORT TO MRS STANTON 128 W 140TH STOP DRAFT ATTACHED STOP SBA
		STOP", she set the telegram down and looked at Josie. "I don't...."</p>

		<p>"You both need work and somewhere to live. Mrs. Stanton
		needs two maids," the gunslinger explained. To Victoria's surprised look, she
		replied. "Mrs. Stanton is a friend of the family. I've known her since before I was
		Rebecca's age."</p>

		<p>"But I don't know nothing about being a maid," the
		young brown-headed woman protested. Josie held up her hand to forestall any more argument.</p>

		<p>"Elizabeth is a good woman, very well educated and part of
		the suffrage movement. She'll take care of you and help you find something you're suitable
		for. Most likely she'd even teach you how to read and write if you wanted."</p>

		<p>Victoria looked squarely at Rebecca. "Is this the second
		chance you were talking about?"</p>

		<p>"Yes." She moved closer and took the brown-headed
		woman's hands in her own. "I don't know this Mrs. Stanton but I do know Josie. If she
		says it's the right thing, then I believe her. Victoria, think of it; New York City. A
		place to live and an honorable job," Rebecca cast quick glances at the others.
		"No offense."</p>

		<p>"None taken, child. We know you didn't mean nothing by
		it," Sandy said. Stacey stared down at the note again.</p>

		<p>"I know that working for someone who treats women as people
		and not objects is a far cry better than this," the redhead said to Victoria. She
		turned her attention to Josie. "She said there was a draft attached?"</p>

		<p>The gunslinger smiled a self-satisfied smile and nodded.
		"Plenty for both of you to take a stage to Saint Louis and then a train the rest of
		the way," she said handing Stacey the draft note. "The stage will be here in
		just over four hours. You have enough time to get to the bank and the mercantile to get
		the things you need for traveling. There's enough money for that too."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Josie?" They were lying in bed, darkness long since
		fallen.</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Do you think Victoria will be all right? I mean, what if
		she gets there and that woman doesn't like her?"</p>

		<p>"You worry too much, Rebecca. Go to sleep." She
		tightened her hold around the younger woman's waist. "She'll be fine. Elizabeth will
		make sure of it. It's not the first time she's taken people in and helped them."</p>

		<p>"You said her and the one that you sent the telegram to are
		friends of yours?" Rebecca had trouble believing that anyone who had the money and
		position to hire maids at will would be a friend to a known outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Well, Susan and her are friends of my mother's mostly. I
		know them through her," Josie explained. "They used to hold meetings with other
		suffragists at my mother's home. Victoria will be fine. Besides, Stacey's with her. Can we
		go to sleep now?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah. What time are we leaving tomorrow?" She heard
		the exasperated and rather tired sigh behind her.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, once we're up and ready to go, then we'll
		leave."</p>

		<p>"Okay."</p>

		<p>It was silent for several moments before Josie spoke. "You
		can buy all the supplies from now on."</p>

		<p>"W-what?" Rebecca said as she turned in the older
		woman's arms and faced her, the blonde's left arm trapped between their bellies. "You
		mean it?"</p>

		<p>"Of course. You get better prices than I do. I never would
		have been able to get all the supplies for the price that you did. You're good at that
		haggling stuff. Now roll over and go to sleep," Josie said, pushing gently on the
		young woman's side in an attempt to get her to move.</p>

		<p>Rebecca rolled over happily and grinned in the darkness.</p>

		<p>"I do get better prices, don't I?" she said smugly.
		"Hmm, wonder what else I do better than you."</p>

		<p>"Talk...and talk and talk," the gunslinger teased. She
		felt the light swat on her forearm and chuckled before becoming serious. "You have
		your own skills and talents, Rebecca. You just have to discover them." She snuggled
		deeper into her pillow. "Now go to sleep."</p>

		<p>"Before you shoot me?" the teasing blonde inquired.
		Both bodies shook together as they remembered the old threat and realized how funny it
		seemed to think of it now. It wasn't long before sleep claimed both the gunslinger and the
		young woman curled up in her powerful arms.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Late morning found them at the stable, readying the horses and
		wagon for departure. Despite Josie's best attempts, the good-byes from Rebecca to all the
		other women dragged on far longer than planned. It seemed that the young woman had a
		speech prepared for each one of them, the ones from Rosewood as well as the women from
		Cheyenne, whom Rebecca knew very little about. All were treated to parting wishes of the
		best for them and several offered and received hugs from the bubbling young woman. Of
		course the most they received from the gunslinger was a polite nod and a mumbled 'you're
		welcome' to the women from Rosewood's repeated thanks. Josie and Elaine exchanged a
		knowing nod and Sandy received a handshake, but no one else dared get that close to the
		well-armed woman. When all of their good-byes were said, Rebecca told Josie that she had
		an errand to run before she was ready to go, and sent her on ahead to get their gear
		stowed in the wagon and the horses ready to do.</p>

		<p>"Ready?" Josie said as she climbed up into the
		sheepskin covered seat and took the reins from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Yeah," she said as she put her hat on and adjusted the
		brim to keep the sun out of her eyes. "Josie, how long do you think it'll take to get
		there?"</p>

		<p>"Shouldn't be more than a week, but it's not going to be an
		easy ride," the gunslinger said as she double checked the position of the Winchester
		leaning against the seat between them. "The Cimarron Cutoff is a dry and dangerous
		route, but it cuts at least five days off our journey." She turned in her seat and
		looked at Rebecca, wondering not for the first time if she shouldn't take a much longer
		yet safer route.</p>

		<p>"Is that why you bought the extra barrel for water?"
		the young woman asked, reaching back and laying her hand against the large, heavy wooden
		container. Josie nodded, not mentioning that it was also why she bought extra boxes of
		shells for the Winchester as well as for the Colts. The Cimarron cutoff was known as a
		route where ambushes were common from both bandits and renegade Indians. Josie took one
		more look at the contents of the wagon, making certain that she hadn't forgotten anything
		before they left town. Not that she would ever forget something she considered necessary
		for traveling, but there was also Rebecca to consider. Thus there was a small box of rock
		candy hidden underneath Josie's saddlebag as well as a dime novel called 'Tom Sawyer' that
		she had seen the young woman pick up and look at while they were at the mercantile. There
		were also two more blankets in preparation of the upcoming cold nights. With a flick of
		her wrist, Josie set Flossy in motion, and the wagon made its way slowly out of town with
		Phoenix tethered behind.</p>
