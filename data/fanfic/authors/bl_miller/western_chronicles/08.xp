	<chapter title="43: Abduction">
		<p>Caleb watched as the sheriff walked down the street and into the
		little diner. He had seen Rebecca go into the office some twenty minutes earlier and a
		short time later had seen the two Indians come out. He was reasonably certain there was
		nobody left inside but his daughter and the half-breed, and she was behind lock and key.
		He figured he didn&#146;t have much time before the sheriff returned, so if he was going
		to act, it had to be now. He wouldn&#146;t be able to get Rebecca out of town until the
		late afternoon train, but he had already found an abandoned house right on the edge of
		town where he could hide her until departure time. A grin spread over his face as he
		walked quickly across the street and stepped through the door behind which his reward was
		waiting.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Sound&#146;s like John&#146;s back," Josie said when
		she heard the sound of the outer door.</p>

		<p>"He hasn&#146;t had time to get your breakfast. I wonder if
		something&#146;s wrong? I&#146;d better go check." She had been sitting on a stool
		right outside Josie&#146;s cell, and she rose and walked to the door. Josie listened to
		the sounds of the footfalls in the other room and furrowed her brow. It didn&#146;t sound
		like John&#146;s tread.</p>

		<p>"Wait a minute, Rebecca. Don&#146;t go out there&#133;"
		she began, but Rebecca had already stepped through the door. Josie heard a muffled yelp
		and the sound of the tin can with Rebecca&#146;s coffee hitting the floor.
		"Rebecca!" Her heart clutched in her chest as she listened to the sound of a
		scuffle. She grabbed the bars and screamed again at the top of her lungs,
		"Rebecca!" But the footfalls had already receded toward the back door of the
		jail. She heard that door open and slam and then all was silent.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>When John came back fifteen minutes later he was greeted by the
		sound of Josie banging on the bars of her cell with the tin cup that had held her coffee.</p>

		<p>"Keep your shirt on! I&#146;ve got your breakfast," he
		called with a smile on his face. Then he saw the other cup lying on the floor in a puddle
		of coffee, and he dumped the plate of food on his desk, drew his gun, and ran to the
		cells. Other than the drunk in the cell next to Josie&#146;s who hadn&#146;t stirred once
		all morning despite the din, there was only Josie back there.</p>

		<p>"John! He&#146;s taken Rebecca!"</p>

		<p>"Who has?" He asked, putting his gun back in his
		holster.</p>

		<p>"I don&#146;t know; I didn&#146;t see him. But there was
		only one person&#146;s footsteps out there."</p>

		<p>"It&#146;s almost certainly her father."</p>

		<p>"Of course," she said bitterly striking her fist
		against the wall. "With everything going on I had almost forgotten about him. John,
		you&#146;ve got to let me go after him."</p>

		<p>"You know I can&#146;t do that, Miss Josie. I&#146;ll go
		after him." She shook her head vigorously.</p>

		<p>"You said you had to get the schoolhouse ready before court
		could begin, John. Let me go. I can track him and get her and come to the schoolhouse by
		nine. Please &#150; I swear I won&#146;t try to run away; I just have to make sure
		she&#146;s safe before I go into that court room."</p>

		<p>"I shouldn&#146;t be doing this," John muttered as he
		pulled the key ring off of his belt and walked toward her cell. "I&#146;ll lose my
		job &#150; or worse &#150; if you don&#146;t show up in court by nine, Miss Josie."
		He unlocked the door and she sprang out like a cat freed from a cage.</p>

		<p>She paused long enough to grasp his hand and pump it a few times.
		"You have my word, John. I&#146;ll be there by nine; I&#146;ll wait outside while
		Rebecca comes in to get you, and we&#146;ll act as if you just brought me over from the
		jail."</p>

		<p>"Promise me you won&#146;t kill him."</p>

		<p>"I won&#146;t kill him," she said over her shoulder as
		she stepped out the back door. Under her breath she muttered, "but he&#146;ll wish to
		hell he was dead when I&#146;m through with him."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>A child would have had no difficulty following the tracks of the
		two people from the jail to a tumble down cabin on the outskirts of town. Clearly she had
		resisted him the entire way, and as often as not beside the odd indentation left by his
		unevenly worn boot were the drag marks from Rebecca&#146;s heels. Josie&#146;s anger grew
		with every step she took, and she was glad she did not have a gun or it would be very
		difficult to keep her promise to John.</p>

		<p>There were no windows in the little one room cabin, but one
		opening in the wall was covered with oilcloth, so even though she couldn&#146;t see she
		could hear every sound from within. She crouched silently outside trying to determine from
		which part of the room the voices were coming so that she could decide whether to go
		through the door or the empty window frame.</p>

		<p>"&#133;knew you were hatchin&#146; up some scheme with that
		damned Injun sheriff, and I ain&#146;t gonna run the risk of you doin&#146; something to
		free that bitch. I don&#146;t give a damn what you do after she&#146;s safely back in the
		states and I&#146;ve got my money. Now you stop wigglin&#146; and keep your hands behind
		your back so I can tie them."</p>

		<p>"Pa, please don&#146;t do this. If it&#146;s money you want
		I can raise enough to equal the reward, or even more if you&#146;ll just leave us alone.
		They&#146;ll kill her if they get her back there, and she doesn&#146;t deserve&#133;"</p>

		<p>"She deserves every damned punishment they want to heap on
		her, and more! She&#146;s a murderin&#146; thief and a defiler of innocent young women.
		And you," his voice was full of venom as he spoke, and Josie had to force herself to
		stay where she was, she wanted so badly to rush in there and choke the life out of him.
		She could almost see the hatred in his eyes as he continued to berate his daughter.
		"You&#146;re a disgrace to your family and an abomination in the eyes of the lord.
		You probably egged her on like you done them poor fools she killed back there to home. Oh,
		yeah, they found the bodies. Figure your girlfriend did them in for their horses and the
		silver in their pockets."</p>

		<p>"They were trying to rape me." Rebecca&#146;s voice was
		a hiss. Clearly she no longer believed she had a chance of reasoning with the man and she
		held nothing back. "You&#146;d rather a gang of men rape me than one woman love me,
		wouldn&#146;t you? What kind of father&#133;"</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m not your father!" He said sharply cutting her
		off in mid sentence. "Your Ma had a roll in the hay with that music teacher right
		before he up and left town. I may not be the smartest man in the world, but I know how to
		count to nine, and I sure as hell wasn&#146;t there when she got pregnant with you. She
		finally admitted it to me when you were a little girl, after we&#133;. Well, it don&#146;t
		matter, I ain&#146;t your Pa. And since we ain&#146;t blood relations it wouldn&#146;t be
		a sin if I was to get a little taste of what you been handing out to that Injun, now would
		it?"</p>

		<p>That was as much as Josie could take. She quickly walked several
		paces away from the building and then turned and ran toward the oilcloth, diving through
		with her arms straight out in front of her as if she were plunging into water. The
		oilcloth tore free of the window frame and landed on Caleb who was just beginning to
		wonder what the commotion was all about. A moment later Josie landed on top of him as
		well, propelling him to the far wall, which he hit with a loud thump. The air was knocked
		out of him and he slowly crumpled to the floor still not knowing what hit him. She gave
		him a solid kick to the crotch just to keep him down, and he screamed like a pig being
		slaughtered. She lifted up the oilcloth covering his head just enough to see if he was
		truly out, and satisfied that he was not going anywhere for a while she turned to Rebecca
		who was tied to a chair.</p>

		<p>"Josie, thank God! How did you&#133;"</p>

		<p>"No time to explain now. We have to get your fath -I mean
		him," she said with a sneer, "tied up and gagged before he comes around.
		I&#146;d just as soon he didn&#146;t know it was me that took him out." Her hands
		worked at the knots around Rebecca&#146;s ankles as she spoke, and as soon as she was free
		she began trussing up Caleb&#146;s feet. "Tie his bandanna around his mouth for a gag
		and help me tie his hands and feet together."</p>

		<p>Rebecca did as she asked and within minutes he was lying on his
		side with his hands and feet bound together behind his back. He would not be able to do
		much more than turn over onto his stomach. Josie covered him with the oilcloth so that
		someone casually glancing through the open window frame would not see anything but a heap
		of fabric in the corner. That should do until the sheriff could come and free him. She
		took Rebecca&#146;s hand and pulled her in for a quick kiss.</p>

		<p>"Follow me," Josie said taking Rebecca&#146;s hand once
		again and leading her out of the cabin. She skirted behind the buildings when they arrived
		in town until she was behind the church, which was the closest building to the
		schoolhouse. She crouched behind a large bush and whispered to Rebecca, "Go tell John
		where I am. He should be in there waiting for you. Hurry. It&#146;s almost nine."</p>

		<p>"Josie, why are you doing this? You&#146;re free; you could
		run. I could meet up with you somewhere&#133;"</p>

		<p>"No. I&#146;m not running any more. I made a promise to
		John, and I&#146;m going to keep it. Go now&#133; please. I&#146;ll see you again inside.
		I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you, too." She leaned down and kissed the top
		of Josie&#146;s head and then walked away without looking back.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca threaded her way through the people on the steps of the
		schoolhouse, some of whom looked at her as if to question why she thought she should be
		allowed in the building, but she carefully avoided looking into any of their faces and
		simply pressed on. Every seat in the schoolhouse was taken, and people stood against the
		walls and in the cloakroom. Those who weren&#146;t lucky enough to find a space on the
		wall sat on the steps of the small building or stood talking in small groups on the school
		grounds.</p>

		<p>John was just inside the door, watching intently for Rebecca to
		appear. When he last looked at his watch he saw that it was ten minutes until nine, and
		with every minute that passed his anxiety level rose until he felt certain he was going to
		collapse from sheer worry. The sight of the little blonde making her way up the steps made
		him almost want to cheer, and he stepped outside to intercept her.</p>

		<p>"There&#146;s a seat for you up front; some friends of yours
		are saving it for you. I&#146;m going to go get the prisoner now." He deliberately
		spoke loud enough for those in the vicinity to hear.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Sheriff. Lord knows we need a friend right about
		now." She emphasized the words "lord" and "friend", and cut her
		eyes in the direction of the church. John nodded imperceptibly to show that he got the
		message, and he hurried off in the direction of the jail. He passed by the church on the
		way, and as soon as he was out of sight of the school, he doubled back and went down the
		side yard between two buildings and came up behind the church.</p>

		<p>At first he thought he must have misunderstood after all, as he
		saw no sign of the outlaw, but he softly said, "Miss Josie, are you here?" There
		was a rustling in the bushes and the black clad woman emerged. Relieved, he walked to
		where she stood brushing off leaves and dirt and a smile lit up his face.
		"You&#146;ll never know how happy I am to see you," he said sincerely.</p>

		<p>"Been kicking yourself ever since you unlocked that cell,
		have you?" Her tone was light, but the slight flush that appeared on his face told
		her she was on the mark. She laughed softly. "You&#146;ve been good to us, John.
		There&#146;s no way I&#146;d put your livelihood on the line, even if I thought I could
		have made a break for it. The running ends here. One way or another."</p>

		<p>He held up a pair of handcuffs and she extended her hands.
		"Sorry to have to do this, Miss Josie." The teeth on the cuffs clicked into
		place, but he stopped when they were still comfortable. "Let&#146;s go in the back
		door of the jail and come out the front," he said. "Try to keep out of sight in
		the meantime."</p>

		<p>"No problem. Let&#146;s go."</p>

	<chapter title="44: Judgement Day">
		<p>As Rebecca walked down the center aisle of the schoolhouse she
		could feel every eye in the place follow her steps. She kept her eyes on the floor,
		uncertain what reception she would get from the local populace.</p>

		<p>"That&#146;s her friend," a voice whispered from a seat
		as she passed. "Come to town with the outlaw, she did."</p>

		<p>"More than friends is what I heard," a male voice
		hissed.</p>

		<p>"What of it?" A woman spoke loudly, and something
		familiar in the voice made Rebecca turn toward her. Victoria, Stacey and Elaine sat
		together, and it was Victoria&#146;s voice that Rebecca had recognized.</p>

		<p>"Victoria! Oh, God it&#146;s good to see you!" The
		women were on their feet, each one hugging Rebecca in turn.</p>

		<p>"Couldn&#146;t let you face this alone, could we?"
		Victoria said with a grin. "You&#146;d best go sit down. Almost time to start this
		circus. We&#146;ll talk later."</p>

		<p>As she finished the short walk down the aisle she scanned the
		crowd wondering if any of the other people she had sent telegrams to had shown up. She
		caught the eye of Martha Jane who winked and gave her a thumbs up. A few seats away the
		mayor of Mason&#146;s Gulch sat talking with Belle Shirley. And in the front row, Horace
		and Charles sat on either side of Genie. When she reached them, the trio moved apart to
		make room for the little blonde. She gave Horace and Charles each a quick hug and then sat
		down. She opened her mouth to speak to her friends but before she could utter a word the
		room erupted in whispers once again as the outlaw was ushered in.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie ignored the stares and whispers and walked proudly across
		the room with her head high. The shackles on her wrists did nothing to diminish her almost
		regal bearing. Rebecca&#146;s heart swelled with love and pride as she watched her
		beautiful lover pass her by and take a seat at a small table in front of the teachers desk
		that would serve as the judges bench. John sat on one side of her and a short man in a
		suit and tie sat on the other side. He leaned over and whispered something to Josie, and
		she nodded. This must be the lawyer Belle said she would contact. She swore that if anyone
		could get Josie out of this mess, it would be Ira Greenspan. Josie twisted slightly in her
		seat until she was able to see Rebecca, and she gave her a reassuring smile. Rebecca
		mouthed the words "I love you," and Josie nodded to show she understood.</p>

		<p>"All rise! This session of the Circuit Court of the
		Territory of Oklahoma is now in session. The honorable Judge Lucas Fellowes
		presiding." Chairs scraped the floor as the people got to their feet, and the Judge
		made his way to the front of the room with his clerk trailing behind. The Judge was a tall
		imposing man with a thick head of steel gray hair. He took his place behind the desk and
		sat, and the clerk turned toward the assemblage and said, "Be seated." While
		waiting for the hubbub to die down, Josie studied the clerk and noticed that his
		mannerisms were effeminate, as was the sound of his voice. She would be surprised if he
		was not a kindred spirit, and she smiled at him. His face registered shock to have a
		defendant act friendly toward him, but he recovered his composure and handed a stack of
		papers to the Judge.</p>

		<p>"The first matter before this court is the extradition to
		the United States of Josephine Hunter, known as the outlaw Josie Hunter," the clerk
		intoned. "Will the defendant please rise?" Josie and her lawyer stood up. The
		Judge glared openly at the outlaw making no effort to disguise his dislike of her.</p>

		<p>"Sit down," the Judge growled. "This isn&#146;t a
		trial and there is no reason for the defendant to enter a plea." Resuming their
		seats, Josie continued to maintain eye contact with the Judge who was finally forced to
		look away. "I will listen to qualified petitioners with reasonable arguments as to
		why this person should not be returned to the States to stand trial for her crimes there,
		and at the conclusion of these proceedings I will make my ruling. Because this is not a
		trial, there is no prosecuting attorney. I will ask questions on behalf of the people. Is
		that clear?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, your Honor," Mr. Greenspan replied.</p>

		<p>"Very well. You may proceed with your argument, Mr.
		Greenspan. But I caution you; I have no tolerance for theatrics in my courtroom. If your
		client or any of your witnesses try to turn this into a sideshow I promise it will not
		help your case any. Do you get my point?"</p>

		<p>"Yes I do, your Honor. There will be no theatrics."</p>

		<p>"All right. Get on with it."</p>

		<p>"Thank you. May I stand, your Honor?" The Judge simply
		nodded, and Mr. Greenspan rose and turned toward the townsfolk and visitors. "Ladies
		and gentlemen, I&#146;m sure there is not a one of you who hasn&#146;t heard
		of&#133;"</p>

		<p>"There is no jury here, Mr. Greenspan. You will address your
		comments to me and me alone."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m sorry, your Honor." Ira looked down at his
		notes on the table before him, cleared his throat and looked up at the Judge. "Your
		Honor, my client is not wanted for any crimes whatsoever in the Oklahoma Territory.
		Furthermore, she has selflessly assisted many people present in this room today &#150;
		placed her own life at grave risk &#150; in order to preserve the life and liberty of
		those and other people. The money that she obtained as a result of her career as a train
		robber was all given to the people displaced by the railroads. She kept none of it for
		herself. She is not a ruthless cold-hearted killer as the dime novels portray her, but a
		friend to the less fortunate and defender of the weak. Her actions over the past months
		show that she is trying to atone for the wrongs she has done, and she should be allowed to
		continue on the road to salvage her soul."</p>

		<p>He paused and the Judge inserted into the silence, "That
		didn&#146;t make Robin Hood an upstanding citizen any more than it does your client, Mr.
		Greenspan. I doubt she could redeem her soul if she were allowed to live for a hundred
		years. If you have no more compelling arguments than that, this hearing is a waste of my
		time and the taxpayer&#146;s money. I suggest you produce your witnesses so we can bring
		this farce to a close."</p>

		<p>The lawyer had expected the Judge to be unsympathetic to his
		client based on his discussion with the sheriff, but he had not anticipated this complete
		unwillingness to be fair-minded. He had hoped that the stories of his witnesses might be
		able to produce a spark of humanity in the Judge, but it seemed his human kindness was
		reserved for the fair of skin. "I call Martha Jane Canary."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"&#133;managed to bring in enough medicine to save most of
		the people who would surely have died without it. She worked day and night to save them
		too, with nary a thought to herself. Deadwood would have been a ghost town if it
		warn&#146;t for Josie Hunter." She smiled at Josie as she finished her testimony, and
		the outlaw mouthed &#145;thank you&#146; in return.</p>

		<p>"And where did she get the medicine?" The Judge asked.</p>

		<p>"Why, she got it from a snake oil peddler or some such.
		I&#146;m not rightly sure."</p>

		<p>"And was the snake oil peddler outside the quarantine area
		when she got the medicine from him?"</p>

		<p>"I believe he was, but&#133;"</p>

		<p>"So she disregarded the quarantine and put an innocent
		person at risk for smallpox. Thank you, Miss Canary. That will be all. Next witness."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Well, actually it was the other one&#133;uh, Miss Cameron
		over there, who volunteered Miss Hunter&#146;s services," Mayor McGregor from
		Mason&#146;s Gulch explained. "We didn&#146;t see Josie&#133;that is, Miss Hunter,
		until after I agreed to give her immunity in return for her help in stopping the Caram
		gang from looting our town."</p>

		<p>"If not for your promise of immunity she would have ridden
		on by and left your town for the vultures, is that it?" The Judge asked with a sneer.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I don&#146;t think so. Miss Cameron was quite sure she
		could get Miss Hunter to help even without the immunity."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m sure Miss Cameron can be very persuasive,"
		the Judge said with a hint of sarcasm. "You can step down, Mr. McGregor. I think I
		know what was behind Miss Hunter&#146;s heroic behavior in Mason&#146;s Gulch."</p>

		<p>"But your Honor, I&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Step down, sir. I&#146;ll find you in contempt if I have to
		ask you again."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>One after another the witnesses came forward to tell of the
		selfless acts and heroic deeds Josie had done, and one after another the Judge found
		reason to belittle the witnesses and downplay the good things she had done. The Judge
		refused to allow Rebecca to testify on the grounds that she was not an impartial witness.
		The lawyer had no choice but to pull his ace from the hole. "I call Mrs. William
		Howe, wife of the Governor of the Territory of Oklahoma." The Judge&#146;s eyebrows
		pulled together in a frown as he watched the finely dressed woman make her way to the
		witness&#146; chair. He had never met the Governor or his wife, and he would not have
		recognized her. The daguerreotypes in the paper did not do her justice. He was not pleased
		to know she was prepared to speak on behalf of the half-breed. It was one thing to know
		the Governor wanted to hear the case to rule on a request for asylum. It was another thing
		entirely to have his wife speak up for the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"I fail to see how Mrs. Howe can provide a character
		reference for Miss Hunter since she has not personally witnessed any of the so-called
		heroic acts this parade of witnesses have described."</p>

		<p>"On the contrary, your Honor. Mrs. Howe has known the
		defendant since she was a youth. And she has a very moving tale to tell of how Miss Hunter
		tried to help her catch some rustlers."</p>

		<p>"And I&#146;m certain it&#146;s a real tear-jerker, Mr.
		Greenspan. Unfortunately, it has no bearing on this case since it happened before Miss
		Hunter decided to switch sides of the law. Take your seat, Mrs. Howe."</p>

		<p>"With all due respect, your Honor, the events Mrs. Howe
		wishes to relate to this court were a turning point in the life of this young woman. She
		was falsely accused of rustling and was hanged for it&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Are you hard of hearing Mr. Greenspan? Mrs. Howe&#146;s
		testimony is irrelevant. Don&#146;t try my patience any further or I will find you in
		contempt." The icy glint in the Judge&#146;s eye made it clear that he would do
		exactly that.</p>

		<p>Ira was stumped. He shuffled through his notes again, and studied
		the people in the room to see if there was any tactic or witness he had over looked that
		might help to delay what was now clearly inevitable. As his eyes passed over Josie he
		noticed that though she appeared to be calm and stoic, the muscles of her jaw clenched and
		unclenched in silent rage as she stared at the Judge whose prejudice threatened to end her
		life. His only hope was that she still had an ace up her sleeve he could use. "Your
		honor, I request a recess to confer with my client."</p>

		<p>The Judge pulled his watch from his pocket and glanced at it
		before answering the lawyer&#146;s request. It was nearly noon, and since it did not seem
		likely that they would be able to finish before lunch, he decided to grant the request. He
		rapped his gavel on the desk before him and said, "This court will stand in recess
		until two o&#146;clock. Sheriff, remove the prisoner to her cell until then."</p>

		<p>"All rise," the clerk lisped. As the spectators
		shuffled to their feet and began to leave, the sheriff removed the handcuffs from his belt
		and showed them to Josie with an apologetic look on his face. Wordlessly she held out her
		hands and he snapped them in place. With the lawyer on one side and the sheriff on the
		other Josie was escorted to the jail, a procession of concerned friends with Rebecca in
		the lead following in their wake.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Despite the seriousness of the circumstances, the mood in the
		jailhouse was almost festive. John removed the handcuffs as soon as they were inside the
		building, and he did not bother to put Josie in a cell. The friends who had come to
		support her were clustered around her, hugging her and slapping her on the back. Jane and
		Belle exchanged a glance as they watched their usually untouchable friend not only allow
		herself to be touched, but actually seem to enjoy it. Belle shrugged and Jane smiled as
		they both got in line to collect their share of hugs from the enigmatic outlaw.</p>

		<p>Josie had no idea she had so many friends until they were all
		assembled in one room. She glanced down at the little blonde who never left her side, and
		realized that if it were not for her most of the people would not be there. Rebecca had
		peeled away the layers of armor that had shielded Josie from harm, but had kept love away
		in the bargain.</p>

		<p>"Thank you. All of you&#133;for coming here to help
		me," Josie said. The quiver in her voice betrayed her emotions as she continued,
		"If I don&#146;t get out of this mess it won&#146;t be because you didn&#146;t try.
		And I love you for it." Her arm was around Rebecca&#146;s waist and she gave her a
		squeeze to show that she loved her more than all the rest. The gesture was not lost on
		Genie, who felt a stab of jealousy to see such closeness between the two women. If not for
		her father, she knew that it could have been she who earned such adoring looks from the
		tall gunslinger. She was not unhappy with her life, and in fact loved her husband dearly,
		but she could not help but wonder how her life might have been if not for that fateful
		night in the barn. She sighed and then smiled as Josie&#146;s gaze caught her eye. Josie
		held out her hand to Genie, and she placed her own hand in it. Josie gently pulled Genie
		until she was against her other side, and put that arm around her waist. Flanked by the
		two diminutive women, Josie looked like a book between two bookends.</p>

		<p>"I hate to take you away from your friends, but I think we
		need to discuss our strategy," Ira said. "I suggest you folks go get some lunch
		before court resumes this afternoon, and give us a chance to talk." One by one the
		people filed to the door after giving Josie words of encouragement. When Genie and Rebecca
		made a move to separate themselves from Josie, the outlaw pulled them back to her sides.</p>

		<p>"These women are my family. They stay with me."</p>

		<p>"Suit yourself," the lawyer said with a shrug. He
		motioned for the women to take a seat on the bench that flanked the sheriff&#146;s desk,
		and he sat in a chair facing them. "I don&#146;t have to tell you this is not looking
		good," he said solemnly. Josie raised one eyebrow and regarded him silently. He
		swallowed hard at the cold glint in the gunslinger&#146;s eyes and averted his gaze, then
		went on, "Truthfully, I did not expect him to completely ignore the telegram from the
		governor. The man is committing political suicide, and doesn&#146;t even seem to care. He
		must have a huge axe to grind with you, Miss Hunter."</p>

		<p>"Not with me in particular. I just seem to be the only
		Indian handy for him to take out his revenge on. A man with such hate in his heart for an
		entire people should not be allowed to hold a position that wields authority over those
		people." Her voice was tinged with bitterness as she turned to Genie and continued,
		"I hope you make sure your husband disbars that bastard, no matter how this turns
		out."</p>

		<p>"Count on it. But we can&#146;t give up hope. I already
		wired William and told him he had to be here by tomorrow. I haven&#146;t heard back from
		him yet, but I know he will be here on the afternoon train. We just have to keep the Judge
		from taking you out on the morning train."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie shifted nervously in her seat in the schoolhouse as the
		lawyer checked his watch for the 3<sup>rd</sup> time since they had been seated. She
		raised her eyebrows and he mouthed the words "two-thirty." Knowing the
		Judge&#146;s eagerness to have this hearing at an end and Josie on her way to the gallows,
		the outlaw could not help but feel that his lateness did not bode well for her life
		expectancy. A murmur from the back of the room announced the arrival of someone, and Josie
		turned in her seat to see the Judge making his way down the center aisle, followed by his
		clerk&#133;and Caleb Cameron. As the trio made their way past her she could have sworn she
		was in a brewery, so strong was the smell emanating from their pores. Josie glared openly
		at the man who had pretended to be Rebecca&#146;s father, and made a tiny motion across
		her neck with her hand that only he could see, and which left no doubt in the man&#146;s
		mind that he would be dead if he allowed himself to be caught once again by the outlaw. He
		gave her a wide berth and sat down in a chair on the far side of the room toward the
		front.</p>

		<p>"All rise," the clerk announced. "This court is
		now in session, his Honor&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Never mind. They know all that," the Judge growled.
		His speech was somewhat slurred, and his eyes were red rimmed. The clerk opened his mouth
		to say something then thought better of it and sat down. The rest of the people took that
		as their cue and resumed their seats. The Judge continued with a baleful glare at the
		defense table, "Do you have anything more to say before I render my decision?"</p>

		<p>"I do, your Honor."</p>

		<p>"Be quick about it then."</p>

		<p>"Your Honor, I wish to say for the record that this hearing
		is premature in view of the injunction from the Governor to delay until his arrival. Even
		if you will not allow Mrs. Howe to testify in regard to Miss Hunter&#146;s past, I request
		that she be allowed to testify to the validity of the telegram from her husband. And I
		further&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Enough! Madam, were you with your husband at the moment
		that he supposedly sent the telegram to which defense counsel refers?"</p>

		<p>Genie was caught off guard, and her reply was a stammered,
		"No, I was not actually with him&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Then you cannot swear with absolute certainty that he did
		in fact send a telegram. It could just as easily have been sent by Miss Cameron,
		isn&#146;t that true?"</p>

		<p>"Your Honor, he told me he sent the telegram. We discussed
		it at length before he did, and I knew exactly what he was going to say."
		Genie&#146;s cheeks flushed with anger at the effrontery of this pompous ass. She opened
		her mouth to tell him just what she thought of him when he cut her off.</p>

		<p>"Hearsay; inadmissible. Mr. Greenspan, unless you have some
		new evidence to present, this court would very much like to begin the conclusion of this
		hearing."</p>

		<p>"Your Honor I protest this mockery of a hearing, and believe
		that you should disqualify yourself from this case owing to your prejudice toward Indians.
		If Miss Hunter were not a half-breed we would not be sitting here today." The look
		the Judge bestowed on Ira left little doubt that he held Jews in much the same esteem as
		he did Indians.</p>

		<p>"Your protest is noted." The Judge leaned on his desk
		and glared first at Josie then at Ira. Josie did not flinch, but the lawyer shrunk down in
		his seat under the unrelenting hatred coming from the man. With a feral grin, the Judge
		continued, "And now it&#146;s my turn. I think these good people should hear what
		Josie Hunter is really like, from Caleb Cameron, the man who was her most recent
		victim." He turned to Caleb who had alternated between the desire to flee from the
		room, lest Josie somehow managed to get free, and his wish to see the look on Josie&#146;s
		face when the Judge told her she had a one way ticket to hell. Since it seemed the Judge
		had things well in hand and Josie did not appear to be going anywhere, he had stayed. He
		looked at the outlaw with utter contempt as the Judge motioned him forward.</p>

		<p>"Mr. Cameron, will you tell the people how you came to be
		acquainted with Josie Hunter?"</p>

		<p>Caleb cleared his throat several times before he could speak
		loudly enough to be heard past the first few rows of people. "Uh, she ambushed some
		poor cowpokes that was trying to court my daughter, and shot &#145;em dead. Then she
		kidnapped my daughter and drug her to hell and gone all over the country. And when I tried
		to get my little girl back to take her home to her Ma, that Injun beat me to within an
		inch of my life."</p>

		<p>He made sure to turn his head to both sides of the room so that
		everyone could clearly see the black eye and the cut on his cheek, both courtesy of the
		outlaw. Josie was certain that the little weasel had not seen her, but she could not be
		sure he had not heard her voice before falling into unconsciousness. Josie shot a glance
		at John to try to convey to him that she would not allow him to be implicated for her
		release if the Judge delved into that. The look he gave her in return showed that he was
		not as confident as she appeared to be. But then he shrugged; he had known when he let her
		out of the cell that this could happen, and had been willing to take the risk. Both of
		them turned their attention to the front of the room once more, where Caleb had finished
		showing off his wounds to the audience and had continued to speak.</p>

		<p>"But the worst of it is that this&#133;this&#133;sick and
		twisted pervert has taken my innocent little girl and turned her into an abomination in
		the eyes of the lord, just like herself." Josie grit her teeth to avoid saying
		something that would not serve any purpose but to worsen her case. She thought if she had
		to listen to that sanctimonious hypocrite use the phrase "abomination in the eyes of
		the lord" one more time, she would rip his tongue from his mouth and shove it up the
		flap of his longjohns. Caleb&#146;s eyes skirted over Josie&#146;s as he spouted his well
		practiced venomous diatribe, and quickly moved away as the look in her eyes made his heart
		clunk in his chest like the last hard apple in the bottom of the barrel. His voice was not
		quite so strong as he continued, "Won&#146;t be no decent, God fearing man want to
		have nothin&#146; to do with the likes of Rebecca now that she&#146;s been tainted by that
		outlaw. She should pay for what she done to my family. And I aim to see that I get the
		reward that is due me for havin&#146; to take care of this worthless girl for the rest of
		her unnatural life."</p>

		<p>The Judge scowled at Caleb for the embellishments he had added to
		the rehearsed script they had discussed in the saloon while sharing a drink&#133;or four.
		Nevertheless, he felt that the exposure of the outlaw for her crimes against nature itself
		should help to sway public opinion away from her and prevent the Indian-lovers in the
		community from doing anything to prevent him from carrying out his plan. He could tell
		that morning as he looked over the crowd that the prevailing opinion was that she had
		redeemed herself and should not be forced to go back and stand trial for her crimes. He
		hoped they were not so quick to overlook her unnatural behavior as they were her crimes.
		To get Caleb back on track, he asked, "And when did Miss Hunter inflict these
		injuries on you, Mr. Cameron?"</p>

		<p>"Why, today. This mornin&#146;..."</p>

		<p>Ira shot to his feet and spoke without waiting to be recognized
		by the Judge. "That&#146;s absurd, your Honor. Miss Hunter has been behind bars for
		five days. She could not possibly have done what this man claims she did." In truth,
		he believed Josie capable of nearly anything, including getting in and out of jail without
		anyone knowing it, but he kept that opinion to himself.</p>

		<p>Before the Judge could reprimand Ira for his outburst, Rebecca
		had also leapt to her feet. Turning toward the crowd instead of the Judge she said
		quickly, "It wasn&#146;t Josie that hit him; it was a man from town, a stranger to
		me. The man heard me screaming for help when he," she pointed at Caleb accusingly and
		then continued, "was trying to rape me&#133;" The lie came effortlessly to
		Rebecca's lips, even though lying was as foreign to her as breathing water would be. She
		knew then what Josie meant when she said the Judge would assume Rebecca would lie to
		protect her. But the man whom she had called Pa for all her life knew Rebecca for an
		honest person, and the look on his face clearly showed that he had not seen Josie, but had
		merely assumed that it had been she who had come to Rebecca's rescue. That look was not
		lost on the Judge either, as he watched the credibility of his only witness crumble into
		the chalk dust on the floor.</p>

		<p>"You&#146;re out of order!" The Judge bellowed, but
		Rebecca went on.</p>

		<p>"I left with Josie because she was kind to me. She protected
		me. That man never had a kind word for me, and beat me for every imagined
		wrong&#133;"</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll cite you for contempt if you don&#146;t sit down
		and be quiet, Miss Cameron."</p>

		<p>"These people deserve to know the truth! You can cite me,
		but you can&#146;t make me stop talking!" Once again she turned her face to the
		people who stared at her, hanging on her every word. "Don&#146;t let their hatred and
		bigotry cause the death of&#133;my best friend." She gestured with her hand to
		include both Caleb and the Judge, who at that point seemed to be the only people present
		in favor of extraditing the outlaw. Even the court clerk had tears pooling in the bottom
		of his eyes as he listened to Rebecca&#146;s impassioned plea.</p>

		<p>All of Josie&#146;s friends present began rising to their feet,
		and one of them started to chant "Free Josie." Within moments, the voices had
		swelled to include the townspeople as well, and the Judge banged his gavel repeatedly on
		the desk but was unable to get the crowd to quiet down. Caleb scuttled around behind the
		Judge as if seeking his protection. The Judge was beginning to wish that he had someone to
		hide behind, but then he realized that the people were only chanting. They were doing
		nothing to show that they intended to do violence. The Judge reached into his boot and
		took out a derringer that he kept hidden there for emergencies, and he fired the gun into
		the ceiling, causing a shower of wood splinters to rain down on the spectators. It had the
		desired effect, as the chanting lost volume and then stopped altogether, and the Judge
		bellowed into the near silence.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll clear this room if you don&#146;t all shut up and
		take your seats NOW!" His face was so red with anger that it looked as if he might
		have a stroke at any moment. "You," he aimed his gavel at Rebecca as if it were
		a gun, "are in contempt of court. I sentence you to a night in jail. And you,"
		his gaze swiveled to Josie who met his eyes unflinchingly, "are to be transported by
		train to Missouri tomorrow where you will stand trial for your crimes against the United
		States. Sheriff, take both of these women into custody. Have Josie Hunter ready to travel
		at ten o&#146;clock tomorrow morning, at which time you will hand her over to Caleb
		Cameron who I am deputizing to transport the prisoner. This court is adjourned!" He
		rapped his gavel sharply and got to his feet.</p>

		<p>John had no choice but to do as the Judge ordered. He slipped one
		of the bracelets of the handcuffs on each woman, and motioned for them to precede him from
		the room. Once again a procession of people followed the women from the schoolhouse to the
		jail, only now it was a much larger crowd.</p>

		<p>As the last of the spectators trickled out the Judge sent the
		clerk ahead, and grabbed Caleb by the sleeve when he started to leave as well. The farmer
		would just as soon take their conversation to the saloon, but the Judge did not look to be
		in a very convivial mood. Caleb wasn't sure just what he had done to make the Judge so
		angry but it wasn't long before he found out.</p>

		<p>"Why in hell did you tell me that damned Indian was the one
		that knocked you around, you worthless sot? Now this entire herd of yokels thinks you're a
		liar and I'm an idiot. Not to mention they're ready to nominate that bitch for
		sainthood."</p>

		<p>"I-I thought it was her," Caleb whined. "Who else
		would come flying through a window like the hounds of hell were after them?"</p>

		<p>"Who? How about any good Samaritan that heard your daughter
		screaming for help." Caleb lowered his eyes and scuffed his toe in the drifts of
		chalk dust on the floor. He was not used to being the one on the receiving end of a tongue
		lashing, and he did not much like it. Not for the first time he began to wonder whether
		the reward for the outlaw was worth the abuse he had been forced to take. And the
		gunslinger was still a far cry from the states.</p>

		<p>"Why did you say I would take her back to the states?",
		he asked in an effort to shift the conversation off of the fiasco with Rebecca. "That
		woman scares me...she'd kill me as soon as look at me."</p>

		<p>"She'd probably have to stand in a rather long line for that
		privilege," the Judge said under his breath.</p>

		<p>"What did you say?"</p>

		<p>"Just don't worry about it. She'll be handcuffed, and you'll
		have the gun. You shouldn't have any problems taking care of a woman who can't fight
		back...what with all your experience." The sneer in his voice told Caleb that while
		he had no use for Indians and Jews, he nevertheless took a dim view of men who were
		heavy-handed with women. "And you can hand her over to the Federal Marshals in Kansas
		City, so you'll only have her for less than a day on the train."</p>

		<p>"Well I don't like it. Why can't the Sheriff take her?"</p>

		<p>"You really are a dunce. The two of them are thick as
		thieves! The Sheriff is a half-breed also; we may as well set her free as put her in his
		custody for the trip. He knows better than to let her go while I'm here, but there would
		be nothing to stop him once he got her on the train. No, if you want that reward, you're
		going to have to earn it."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="45: A Night to Last Forever">
		<p>The sound of the tumblers turning in the lock of their cell rang
		with the finality of a nail being pounded into a coffin. John had allowed their friends to
		stay until he absolutely had to lock down the prisoners for the night. He apologized
		repeatedly for having to imprison these women whom he had come to think of as friends
		himself, but they both reassured him that they bore no ill will toward him for doing the
		job he had been hired to do. Intuiting that they would prefer to share the same cell, he
		had moved the bunk from the empty cell into the one Josie had called home for the past
		several days.</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched as John walked through the door at the end of the
		hall, pulling it shut behind him with a click. Once again the sound of a key in a lock
		reminded her that this time she was not free to exit the cell if she chose to; she was as
		much a prisoner as Josie. The outlaw stepped up behind Rebecca where she stood looking out
		through the iron bars, and placing her hands on Rebecca&#146;s shoulders she gently turned
		the smaller woman around to face her. Rebecca&#146;s face was pale and drawn as if she had
		already spent years in confinement. The indomitable spirit that Josie had grown to love
		and depend on seemed to have fled; leaving the hollow ghost of itself behind in the
		fragile woman who stood before her.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m so sorry, sprite," she said softly, drawing
		Rebecca to her and wrapping her arms around her tiny waist. She could feel her heart
		fluttering in her chest like the wings of a bird as it always did at the nearness of this
		woman. A caged bird, she thought wryly. Josie would gladly have sold her soul to the devil
		to spare this gentle creature from the pain and indignity she was going through. But she
		had made such a bargain years ago in return for a pair of six guns, and had nothing left
		to barter with.</p>

		<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for, Josie. This is my fault!
		It&#146;s all my fault!" Rebecca&#146;s chin was trembling and her eyes welled with
		tears.</p>

		<p>"No it isn&#146;t, Rebecca, you&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Yes it is!" Rebecca wailed, unable to check the tears
		that poured down her face. "I handed you over to my fa&#133;to Caleb just as surely
		as Judas gave Jesus to the soldiers. And he won&#146;t be satisfied until he knows
		you&#146;re d-dead!" She buried her face in Josie&#146;s chest and sobbed
		uncontrollably while the outlaw stroked her hair and gently crooned into her ear.</p>

		<p>"Shhh, baby, don&#146;t cry. I&#146;m not dead yet.
		They&#146;ll give me a fair trial in the states, not like this kangaroo court. Don&#146;t
		give up, please. I need your strength." Her own voice quavered when she realized the
		truth of that statement. Rebecca was her anchor, her foundation. More than any other
		thing, Rebecca was the reason she wanted to live. To protect her, and to love her. If
		Rebecca stopped believing, Josie would be without hope.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie. I love you so much. I can&#146;t&#133;bear the
		thought of&#133;going on without you&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Then don&#146;t think about it. There&#146;s still some
		time before that train leaves. Who knows what might happen? We can&#146;t give up on
		William. I need you to help me be strong, Rebecca. Please&#133;"</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked up into cerulean eyes that begged for her to be
		the one to pull them both out of this predicament. She took a deep breath and gently
		touched her lips to Josie&#146;s, and when she pulled away she smiled up at the outlaw and
		said softly, "You&#146;re right. There is time before that train comes. And we
		can&#146;t allow ourselves to waste it by wallowing in tears."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled back. "And how would you like to spend all that
		time, sprite?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, I can think of something I&#146;d much rather wallow in
		than tears," she answered huskily, her fingers moving to the buttons of Josie&#146;s
		shirt. Slowly she unfastened each button, her fingers brushing against the gradually
		exposed flesh of Josie&#146;s breasts. Josie gasped and inhaled sharply as Rebecca pulled
		the tails of her shirt free and in the process inserted her fingers down the front of her
		pants to touch the crisp hair on the top of her mound. Rebecca put her hands under the
		fabric of the shirt and rolled if off Josie&#146;s shoulders, her eyes feasting on the
		flesh she loved so well as it was slowly revealed. The hungry look in her eyes was enough
		in itself to make Josie&#146;s nipples stiffen with anticipation.</p>

		<p>Rebecca leaned forward and touched her lips lightly to the valley
		between Josie&#146;s breasts, her nose delighting in the musky scent of her lover.
		"You are the most beautiful woman on earth," she whispered as she tilted her
		head back to look into Josie&#146;s face. With gentle pressure of her hand on the back of
		Josie&#146;s head she brought their lips to within a breath of each other and then said
		softly, "I want you more than I have ever wanted anything in my life, Josie
		Hunter." Her lips met Josie&#146;s and her tongue gently begged entrance to her
		mouth. With a groan Josie parted her lips to allow the caress, and met the inquisitive
		tongue with her own. She pulled the smaller woman closer and deepened the kiss, causing
		Rebecca to moan softly deep in her throat.</p>

		<p>When at last they separated Josie replied, "And I want
		nothing more than to spend the rest of my life loving you, Rebecca Cameron." Neither
		woman would allow herself to dwell on how brief that might be. "I&#146;ve missed
		having you beside me these past nights. I can&#146;t tell you how many times I reached out
		to touch you and found only empty space. I want to see you&#133;touch you&#133;feel
		you&#133;taste you." Her fingers began to work the buttons of Rebecca&#146;s dress,
		and while she was careful to avoid pulling them off, she did not take her time to remove
		the garment, so eager was she to behold what she had craved all those lonely nights.</p>

		<p>Josie slid the shirt waist dress down Rebecca&#146;s arms and
		released the garment to settle on the floor at her feet. Reaching down she grasped the hem
		of her slip and in one quick movement she pulled it over her head, leaving Rebecca wearing
		only her panties and shoes. Josie dropped to her knees in front of Rebecca to untie the
		cord that held her panties in place, and that garment joined the rest on the floor. The
		sight of the red-gold curls and the warm scent so near to her made her want to bury
		herself between Rebecca&#146;s legs that moment. But she was determined to take as much
		time as she could to tease and excite the younger woman before she finally brought her
		hands and mouth to the spot that so captured her attention. She ran her hand down
		Rebecca&#146;s calf and put slight pressure on her ankle to indicate she should lift her
		foot, and when Rebecca complied she removed the shoe. She performed the same move on the
		other foot, and then stood up to take in the sight of all of Rebecca. For a moment she
		couldn&#146;t breathe. Nothing she had beheld in her life gave her as much pleasure as the
		sight of this woman.</p>

		<p>"My turn," Rebecca growled. Her hands found the buttons
		that clasped the familiar black pants over Josie&#146;s sensuous hips and pulled them
		apart. Josie trembled as Rebecca&#146;s fingers once again brushed over her abdomen. The
		mere suggestion of a touch from this beloved woman was enough to make her heart race and
		her knees grow watery. Rebecca peeled the pants off Josie&#146;s hips, taking her
		underwear with them. The clothes pooled at her calves, held up by her boots. "Sit
		down," Rebecca ordered, arching her brow. Without hesitation Josie dropped to the
		edge of the cot and Rebecca knelt in front of her. The little blonde grasped the heel and
		toe of first one boot and then the other, pulling them off quickly and tossing them aside.
		She ran her fingers over Josie&#146;s well-muscled calves and shivered in anticipation of
		feeling those legs wrapped around her body. She drew the pants and underwear off, and they
		joined the growing pile of clothes occupying a large part of their small space.
		Fortunately they did not need much space, as they planned to be as close together as if
		they were one.</p>

		<p>Rebecca trailed her fingers up the inside of Josie&#146;s thighs
		and delighted in watching the eruption of gooseflesh trailing her fingers. She avoided
		touching the soft curls that covered Josie&#146;s mound, as she wanted to make the tall
		woman frantic with desire before giving her what she craved.</p>

		<p>"Something you want?" She asked in response to the soft
		moan Josie could not suppress. Rebecca&#146;s lips covered the same trail her hand had
		blazed moments before, her chin just grazing the curls as she brought her lips to
		Josie&#146;s belly.</p>

		<p>Josie was half reclining, supported by her hands which were out
		to her sides. She sat up when Rebecca began to run her tongue around her navel, and
		putting her hand under the younger woman&#146;s chin she lifted her face so she could see
		her sparkling green eyes. "Ahhhh, yesss, there is. But first&#133;" She put her
		hands on Rebecca&#146;s waist and picked her up as if she weighed nothing. "Put your
		legs around me," she said in a commanding voice, and Rebecca obligingly parted her
		legs as the outlaw lifted her onto her lap. Josie had parted her own legs so that
		Rebecca&#146;s mound was pressing against her own damp curls. Rebecca molded her body
		against the tall gunslinger, her breasts just reaching Josie&#146;s ribcage. The feel of
		Josie&#146;s breasts on top of her own and the warmth of her moist center commingling with
		that of her lover made Rebecca writhe and moan.</p>

		<p>Josie bent down to capture Rebecca&#146;s lips. Her kiss was soft
		and slow at first, but soon both women were frantic in their need to feel and taste even
		more of each other. They broke apart, gasping, hearts racing at the same tempo.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I have to taste you&#133;now."</p>

		<p>"Oh, but I&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Please&#133;let me&#133;" Her voice was a husky growl,
		and it made Rebecca shiver to hear the need in it.</p>

		<p>"Yes, yes&#133;you may, but I want to taste you too. Both of
		us; together."</p>

		<p>"Yesss." Josie lay on her back, and cupping the soft
		globes of Rebecca&#146;s behind, she urged the younger woman to move up her body. As she
		did, the moist trail left by her lips made Josie even more frantic to run her tongue over
		those folds. Rebecca paused in her ascent and lowered her body onto Josie&#146;s breast,
		effectively coating the tip with her juices. She could feel the nipple hardening against
		her nether lips, and she whimpered softly.</p>

		<p>"God, you excite me, Josie!" she said through clenched
		teeth as she continued to rub against Josie&#146;s breast. Rebecca&#146;s words and the
		warm wetness of her sliding over Josie&#146;s body caused the outlaw to gasp.</p>

		<p>"You make me crazy, Rebecca&#133; Please, give yourself to
		me."</p>

		<p>Rebecca moved further up until her mound was scant inches from
		Josie&#146;s face. Josie wrapped her arms around Rebecca&#146;s thighs and gently pulled
		downward until her knees spread far enough on either side of Josie&#146;s head for her to
		reach the treasure she sought so desperately. The first touch of her tongue on the outer
		folds struck like lightning to the core of the smaller woman.</p>

		<p>"Oh, oh&#133;" Rebecca groaned, nearly forgetting her
		resolve to taste Josie at the same time. She let Josie get enough of a taste to whet her
		appetite for more, and then abruptly rose up on her knees and shifted around so that she
		was facing toward Josie&#146;s feet.</p>

		<p>The move was so quick it caught Josie off guard, something only
		Rebecca could do. By the time she realized Rebecca had withdrawn she was already back, her
		velvety folds once again tickling Josie&#146;s lips and nose. Rebecca was lowering herself
		slowly onto the outlaw&#146;s body, hungry for the taste of her center, but not wanting to
		miss any of the delights along the way. She tongued the underside of Josie&#146;s breasts,
		which was all she could reach from that angle, but she vowed to come back and suckle them
		as soon as the raging desire to sip from her nectar had been quenched. She trailed her
		tongue over Josie&#146;s abdomen and then dipped it into her navel. Josie&#146;s stomach
		muscles tensed and Rebecca caressed the flesh there with one hand while holding herself up
		with the other. Her fingers slipped into the crease between Josie&#146;s thigh and her
		mound, the warm scent intoxicating and pulling her further down. Lying full out on top of
		the outlaw Rebecca could only just touch the top of Josie&#146;s mound of curls. Never
		having made love to her in this fashion, she did not realize that her shorter stature
		would not allow her to reach her intended goal without some assistance from Josie. She
		cupped her hands around Josie&#146;s bottom and tried to lift, but the result only brought
		her a bit closer to where she wanted to be.</p>

		<p>"I can&#146;t reach," she said petulantly, her
		frustration obvious in her voice. Josie chuckled, the sound muffled by the warm folds
		where her mouth was buried.</p>

		<p>She let Rebecca try reaching a few more times before she finally
		said, "I can fix that." Grasping Rebecca around her buttocks, Josie lifted them
		both up and then she maneuvered them on the narrow cot until they were side by side. One
		more shift put Rebecca on her back beneath the taller woman, whose mouth had never ceased
		it&#146;s exploration the entire time they were moving.</p>

		<p>"Ohhhh," Rebecca moaned as the object of her desire was
		now tantalizingly in reach. She kissed the flesh of Josie&#146;s inner thighs before
		running her tongue over each one in turn. Her tongue got closer and closer to her goal
		each time she moved from one leg to the other until finally she allowed herself to touch
		the rose colored lips lightly with her mouth. Josie shuddered at the contact and burrowed
		her face even deeper into Rebecca&#146;s center.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was determined not to rush; she wanted to take her time
		and tease her lover until she begged for release. But even as she thought &#145;take it
		slow&#146;, her mouth was taking its tempo from the woman above her, and Josie was
		building up speed. Rebecca pulled her mouth away from Josie&#146;s lips for just a few
		moments, and when she touched her again with her tongue she consciously slowed her
		movements. It was enough to send a message to the outlaw.</p>

		<p>Josie had not realized what a pace she was setting until Rebecca
		subtly reminded her. She too had vowed to make this nights lovemaking last until both of
		them were taut as piano wire, but her resolve melted away with a touch of Rebecca&#146;s
		tongue. Never in her life had she been so touched by another human being, and she nearly
		wept with joy that she had been given the last several months with this beautiful woman.
		Whatever the outcome of the trial in the states, she would not have traded one moment of
		the time they had spent together. Josie slowly and carefully parted Rebecca&#146;s lips
		with her tongue, and then she ran it up one side and down the other, occasionally dipping
		inside to pull out some of the accumulating moisture there. She brushed over the knob that
		she knew would send Rebecca hurtling over the edge but was careful not to apply too much
		pressure too soon. She could not resist lightly grazing her teeth over the nub before she
		moved away and she could feel it harden with the tip of her tongue.</p>

		<p>Rebecca wanted to grind herself against Josie but fought the
		impulse knowing the signal that would send would put an end to this exquisite exchange.
		Instead she brought one arm from behind Josie&#146;s thighs and placed her fingers against
		the folds of skin. She separated the folds to give her tongue greater access, and even as
		she lovingly caressed the soft lips she slid two fingers inside the moist cavern. Her
		other hand roamed over the soft contours of Josie&#146;s buttock, delighting in the way
		Josie responded to her touch.</p>

		<p>Now it was Josie who wanted to thrust against Rebecca, and
		involuntarily she began to pick up the pace to match what her inner core wanted to receive
		from the little blonde. Rebecca picked up the tempo, ready to feel the explosion that was
		building inside her, and to pull the same from the woman she loved. She also sucked the
		hardening nub of flesh into her mouth as she built up momentum with her fingers, and she
		was rewarded by a gasp from Josie as the gunslinger stiffened her body and began to rise
		up off Rebecca&#146;s body. The smaller woman clung to her to hold her within reach to
		prolong the delicious sensations.</p>

		<p>Josie could not have delayed her climax any longer if she had
		wanted to. Her one goal was to bring Rebecca to the edge at the same time so that they
		could plunge together. She tongued the bud that had risen from its hiding place and begged
		for attention. Faster she moved until she heard Rebecca cry out with the beginning of her
		orgasm. They both rose so high it seemed they must be hovering just under the ceiling,
		each sucking every bit of moisture from the other until they finally collapsed back on to
		the cot. Their breath came in labored gasps, and neither could move from where she lay,
		faces pillowed on each other&#146;s thighs.</p>

		<p>When at last their hearts had slowed and they felt they could
		once again command their muscles to obey them they rearranged themselves so that Rebecca
		was lying full length on top of the gunslinger, her mouth inches away from a tantalizing
		nipple. She cupped the soft breast in her hand pulling it toward her mouth as she
		stretched out to meet it. She circled the brown ring with her tongue and felt it contract,
		the nipple hardening once again into a bullet. She tasted the essence of herself on
		Josie&#146;s breast.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Hmmm?" The breast in her mouth muffled her response.</p>

		<p>"We need to&#133;make a decision about what you should do
		while I&#146;m gone, in case William does not show up in time." She tried to make it
		sound as if her being gone was only a temporary thing instead of the final chapter of her
		life. "I still think you should take the horses and wagon and go stay with Charles
		and Horace. They love you like a daughter, and god knows that place needs a woman&#146;s
		touch."</p>

		<p>Rebecca raised her head to look into Josie&#146;s eyes before she
		answered. "We&#146;ve been over this. I already asked Charles to take the horses and
		wagon and he said he would, unless you try to prevent me from going with you on the train,
		in which case I will need the wagon to follow you. I am going with you. One way or
		another. You can&#146;t shut me out of your life now, Josie. I&#146;m your strength,
		remember?" A sheen of tears made her eyes sparkle like diamonds as she lightly traced
		the shape of Josie&#146;s face with her fingers. She wanted to memorize every part of the
		woman she loved&#133;with her eyes, her body, and her hands. If this were to be their last
		night, she would be able to recall every detail of it for the rest of her life.</p>

		<p>Josie could not help but see the tears glistening in
		Rebecca&#146;s eyes. She pulled the smaller woman close to her breast and stroked her
		hair. Tears traced their way down the slope of her breast as they lay there for several
		minutes in silence. Finally Josie took a deep breath and said, her voice ragged with
		emotion, "Rebecca, there is nothing more I want than to have you with me. Always. If
		I could marry you, I would. I have dreamed of you and me together in our old age, the days
		quietly passing as we rocked on the porch and watched the sunset. That kind of life never
		appealed to me before I knew you. And now&#133;" her voice broke and the words were
		almost inaudible when at last she continued, "I can&#146;t bear the idea of your
		being there watching me hang. Please, stay with Charles."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m not going to let them hang you," Rebecca said
		with grim determination. "And I am not going to let them separate us. Where you go, I
		go. I don&#146;t want to argue about it any more." She put her head back down on
		Josie&#146;s breast, cupping its softness in her hand. Josie lay there in silence for
		several minutes listening to Rebecca cry softly. She knew there was no point in arguing.
		She hoped that once again the little blonde would be right. If determination alone could
		stop the hanging, Rebecca would find a way to pull it off.</p>

	<chapter title="46: Another Rescue">
		<p>A flash of lightning lit up the window followed almost
		immediately by a clap of thunder that rattled the pane and shot Josie into instant
		wakefulness. Rebecca still lay with her head on the gunslinger&#146;s chest, but she had
		slid down and was now curled up against her side. Josie had pulled the blanket off the cot
		they had not needed during the night and spread it over them to keep off the chill. She
		was glad she had because the temperature had dropped considerably during the night, and
		Rebecca was shivering slightly even with the blanket.</p>

		<p>A hard rain began to pound the building with a force that shook
		the window yet again. Josie was not certain she heard the knock on the outer door until
		she heard John&#146;s voice call out, "Miss Josie, Miss Rebecca. I&#146;m going to go
		fetch you some breakfast. I should be back in fifteen minutes or so."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled to think how kind this man had been to her and
		Rebecca. He could easily have locked them in separate cells for their last night, and
		undoubtedly would be in trouble if it were to get out that he had not. "Thanks,
		John," she called back in acknowledgement. She wrapped her arms around the sleeping
		blonde and hugged her tightly. It was inconceivable that this could be the last time she
		would hold Rebecca, feel her precious body against her own. She kissed Rebecca&#146;s
		forehead and whispered into her hair, "Sprite&#133;wake up. We have to get
		dressed."</p>

		<p>"In a minute," Rebecca mumbled, nuzzling her face into
		Josie&#146;s soft breast. Josie settled back and pulled Rebecca close; a minute was about
		all they had, and it was little enough to give to the woman she loved. Without warning,
		she felt wetness sliding down the side of her breast, and realized Rebecca was crying.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Rebecca, please don&#146;t cry. It kills me to see you
		so unhappy." Poor choice of words; the little blonde began to cry aloud. "Shhh,
		baby. Where is that strength you promised me? We aren&#146;t giving up, remember?"</p>

		<p>"I can&#146;t do it, Josie," she sobbed.
		"I&#146;ll kill them before I let them take you!"</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t even joke about that. You&#146;d be in the same
		boat I am."</p>

		<p>"That&#146;s where I want to be."</p>

		<p>"No you don&#146;t. Listen to me." She put her hand
		under Rebecca&#146;s chin and lifted her head. The soft green eyes were red and swollen,
		her cheeks splotchy and red. "If you did something like that, you would be arrested
		and tried here. It would not prevent them from sending me back; it would just end your
		life early. If I felt I was responsible for that I would spend eternity in hell."</p>

		<p>Rebecca edged her way to the side of the cot and sat up. She took
		a few deep breaths and then turned back to face Josie. "I know that. It&#146;s the
		only reason I would not kill them. But I don&#146;t know how I can bear this&#133;"</p>

		<p>"It&#146;s not over till it&#146;s over." She put on a
		brave face and shifted to sit beside Rebecca on the edge of the cot. "We have to get
		dressed. John will be back soon."</p>

		<p>"Yes," Rebecca replied dully. She began to stand up to
		gather the clothes that had been scattered the night before, but at the last moment she
		turned and threw herself into Josie&#146;s arms. "I love you so much, Josie. I pray
		we still have our whole lives ahead of us, but if this is all we are allowed to have, you
		should know that being with you has been the best thing that ever happened to me."</p>

		<p>Josie swallowed hard to try to keep the tears from forming in her
		eyes as she softly replied, "You must be reading my mind. I was just&#133;"
		Knocking on the outer door interrupted her thought and she called out, "Just a few
		minutes, please John." Kissing Rebecca lightly on the forehead, she rose and began to
		pull her clothes on. Rebecca did the same, the two of them managing to dress within a few
		feet of each other without getting in the way, their motions practiced many a night when
		they could not bear to be so far away from each other that they could not touch.</p>

		<p>"All right, we&#146;re decent," Josie said loudly
		enough for John to hear. Despite that, he took his time opening the door and coming down
		the hall, allowing the women a few more moments alone.</p>

		<p>None of them did more than pick at the breakfast John had laid
		out on the desk in the outer office. When the rain finally began to slow down, the sound
		of utensils scraping plates was the only one to be heard...until the far off wail of a
		train whistle pierced the silence.</p>

		<p>"It&#146;s time," John said softly. He reached to his
		belt to pull off the handcuffs that hung there, and Josie held her hands out in front of
		her without a word. She rose from her chair and walked to where her hat hung on a rack by
		the door.</p>

		<p>"May I have my hat."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll get it," Rebecca said, shouldering her way
		past John who was already reaching for the hat. She removed the black Stetson from the
		rack and placed it lovingly on Josie&#146;s head after brushing back the dark tresses as
		Josie always did.</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Josie said, putting every bit of love she
		felt into those two words. Rebecca smiled at her, but didn&#146;t trust herself to speak
		without crying.</p>

		<p>John shuffled for a moment as if uncertain what to do, and then
		he cleared his throat. "I took the liberty of getting your bags from the boarding
		house," he said, thinking to himself, the boarding house they never had the chance to
		use. He picked up the bags from where they lay behind his desk, and handing the lightest
		one to Rebecca he shouldered the heavier one himself. "If you&#146;ll open the door
		and go first, Miss Rebecca, then you Miss Josie&#133;"</p>

		<p>As the little procession made it&#146;s way toward the train
		station, the townspeople came out to watch. The rain had stopped completely shortly before
		they began their walk, but the bruised looking clouds in the distance told of more rain to
		come. As they walked they gathered people as a snowball down a mountain picks up snow.
		Genie fell in beside Rebecca and Jane took up a place on the other side of Josie. The rest
		of their friends flanked John who walked behind Josie.</p>

		<p>A small knot of people waited on the platform for the train to
		arrive, among them the Judge and his clerk, as well as Caleb Cameron. Caleb wore a gun,
		which looked as out of place on his hip as a sunbonnet would have looked on his head. He
		nervously fingered the grip as he watched the approaching crowd. He had not bargained on
		being the one to haul the outlaw back, and he was not certain he would be able to handle
		things if she decided she did not want to go. For now she seemed to have accepted her
		fate; he hoped she would not change her mind. The Judge wore a smile, which did nothing to
		cover up the hate that radiated from his eyes and danced around his body like ball
		lightning. It made Josie shudder to see such unbridled evil aimed at her and her step
		faltered as she realized that she might once have been accused of putting out such a
		vicious aura. Suddenly she realized that the Judge was simply a man who had lost something
		precious in his life, allowing the pain of his loss to turn him into a bitter and lonely
		person. Unfortunately the power of his position allowed him to use that bitterness to
		exact his revenge. Josie straightened her shoulders and with her head high she climbed the
		steps onto the platform, most of her entourage remaining on the ground, only Rebecca and
		Genie remaining by her side.</p>

		<p>It started to rain again, and in an effort to keep them dry, John
		suggested they take a seat on the train even though departure was still twenty minutes
		away. He needed to handcuff Josie to a seat anyway so that he could go get tickets for the
		two women to Kansas City. There was no way he was going to leave her in Caleb&#146;s
		charge for any longer than he absolutely had to. He asked the conductor to show them to
		the car with the least number of people in it, and the man pointed to a car at the middle
		of the platform.</p>

		<p>John placed Josie&#146;s bag in a rack at one end of the car, and
		when Rebecca started to put her bag beside it, he stopped her with his hand. "Keep it
		with you. You might need it." She couldn&#146;t imagine what use her spare clothes
		and a few books would be on the train, but she did not think it worth arguing with him.
		She nodded and picked the bag up again. John addressed the few people who were sitting at
		one end of the car and asked them to move to the other end. He had to show his badge to
		one surly older matron, and finally with a loud &#145;hrumph&#146; to show her annoyance,
		she rose from her seat and flounced to the other end of the car.</p>

		<p>"Sit here please, Miss Josie," he asked, indicating a
		seat by the window facing forward in the car. When she did, he unlocked the handcuffs and
		passed one bracelet between the armrests on the seat, pulling it up and re-fastening it
		around her wrist. There was very little room for her to move her arms, and she had to turn
		her torso sideways to get comfortable. John&#146;s expression told her how sorry he was
		that he had to leave her like that, and she smiled at him.</p>

		<p>"I don&#146;t blame you for any of this, John. Please
		don&#146;t look so guilty; this was my own doing."</p>

		<p>"I know that, Miss Josie. I just hate to hand you over to
		those two, even for a little while." The two in question had stepped into the car,
		and the Judge overheard the comment and chuckled to himself. Not only did he have the
		murdering Indian where he wanted her, but also he had outwitted the Sheriff and all of his
		delaying tactics. By that evening Josie would be in a jail in Kansas City, and he hoped to
		use his influence to make sure she got a speedy trial. He wanted to see her dead before he
		himself succumbed to the cancer that was ravaging his body. He actually looked forward to
		seeing his wife and children in the hereafter, but if he was going, he wanted to take one
		more redskin with him. Josie Hunter was probably his last chance.</p>

		<p>"Give that handcuff key to Caleb," the Judge ordered.
		With a sigh, John did just that, moving out of the way so that Rebecca could take a seat
		beside Josie. As she was sitting, Rebecca dropped her bag on the floor beside her seat,
		and the catch popped open. When she reached down to close it, her eye was caught by the
		polished gleam of the barrel of one of Josie&#146;s Colt Peacemakers. Quickly glancing up
		to make sure neither Caleb nor the Judge had seen it, she fastened the catch on the bag
		and lifted it up to hold in her lap. She knew the gun was not in there when she left the
		bag at the boarding house, intending to come back and sleep there. Clearly John had put
		the gun, which he had confiscated from Josie when she was arrested, in there for a reason.
		It made no sense that John would have given it to her thinking she would use it to try to
		help Josie escape; he was too honest a lawman to contemplate such an act. As Caleb took a
		seat opposite Josie, with the gun John had reluctantly issued to him resting awkwardly in
		his lap, Rebecca began to suspect that the purpose of the gun was not to free Josie, but
		rather to protect herself from the man she could no longer even remember thinking of as
		father. The Judge settled into the seat opposite Rebecca, his eyes flicking over her
		quickly and dismissing her as unimportant. He turned his gaze to Josie and gave a twisted
		smile.</p>

		<p>"Enjoy the ride," he said venomously. "With any
		luck, your next trip you&#146;ll be lying flat out in a pine box."</p>

		<p>Josie said nothing for a few moments, merely contemplated him
		with her face an unreadable mask. The look on his face reminded her of what she had seen
		reflected back at herself from the mirror during the years she allowed her hatred for the
		railroads and her desire for vengeance to poison every part of her life. Until Rebecca
		showed her that it was possible to love and to forgive&#133;herself as well as
		others&#133;she realized that she was just the same as the man who sat across from her. At
		last she said, "I feel sorry for you, Judge. Your wife would hate that you have
		wasted so much of your life nursing a hatred for an entire people because of a few bad
		ones. I hope you can sort it all out with your God before&#133;" The Judges hand
		lashed out to slap her across the face, but Rebecca was faster. She seized his wrist and
		held it tightly in her hand.</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t you touch her," she hissed through clenched
		teeth. The Judge turned toward this little woman whom he had so easily dismissed and took
		a harder look. She had strength and a fierce determination to keep the outlaw from harm.
		The Judge decided to pick his moments, and it was too early in the day to provoke a
		conflict with either woman. Once the train was out of the half-breed Sheriff&#146;s
		jurisdiction he could do as he liked, with no one to tell him other wise. Without comment,
		he withdrew his hand and placed it in his lap. Rebecca rested her hand on top of the bag
		in her lap, feeling her heart rate decelerate, and hoping her shaking was not visible to
		the man across from her. She would shoot him before she would let him hurt Josie, and she
		wanted her hand close to the bag just in case.</p>

		<p>John came back into the car and saw the silent tableau in the end
		seats. He stopped beside Rebecca and held out two tickets to her. She glanced at them;
		they read one way to Tahleguah&#133;from Tahlequah. She furrowed her brow as she looked at
		them, but John shook his head imperceptibly as if to say, this is right, don&#146;t worry
		about it.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, John. I appreciate everything you&#146;ve done
		for us. We&#146;ll come back through here when all this is over."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll look forward to that, Miss Rebecca." He
		cocked his head at the sound of the conductor calling "all abooard," and then
		turned to Josie. "Good luck to you, Miss Josie. The Cherokee will not be forgetting
		you any time soon." Josie just nodded and smiled, unable to trust her voice. The
		train whistle sounded, and John made his way to the door, jumping out just before the
		train began to move. On the platform Genie, Charles, Horace, Jane, and Belle stood
		silently watching as the cars pulled through, looking through the windows until they saw
		Rebecca and Josie. Genie had told Josie as they walked to the station that she would wait
		for her husband and follow as soon as they could. She still believed that he could do
		something to free Josie even if she were already in the states. Josie was once again
		grateful for the two women who were determined to stand by her through this ordeal.</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded to Josie to turn her head toward the window, and
		when she did she was able to see her little group of supporters one last time before the
		train left the station. Dimly she noted that the rain had stopped once again, and was glad
		that she would not have to make this trip in a downpour. Rain depressed her, and she
		wanted to at least try to put on a brave front for Rebecca. She turned back to Rebecca and
		looked into her sparkling green eyes. Oddly enough, Rebecca seemed very calm compared to
		the way she was when they first boarded the train. Perhaps her success in thwarting the
		Judges attempt to strike her had given her confidence a boost. Whatever it was, it lifted
		Josie&#146;s heart to see her lover relaxed, as she had not been since they first woke up
		that morning.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The train had only been gone from the station for a few minutes
		and had not yet reached full speed when it was obvious that it was beginning to slow down
		again. The whistle shrieked several times as if the engineer were trying to warn someone
		away from the tracks, but despite the warning the speed still decreased until finally it
		came to a complete stop. The conductor made his way down the aisle reassuring the
		passengers that it was probably just a minor problem and they would soon be under way. The
		Judge was not mollified by that explanation and insisted that he make his way to the front
		of the train and find out what the problem was. After trying in vain to convince him, the
		man finally gave up and left the car, promising to return within a few minutes.</p>

		<p>Josie&#146;s gaze drifted to the window and she blinked several
		times as her eyes tried to make sense of what she thought she saw. At first it appeared to
		be a river stretching out in front of the train, with morning mist rolling on top of the
		water. But upon looking closer, she saw that it was not water but people, and the mist was
		steam rising off of them as the rain evaporated from their clothes. As far as the eye
		could see, the track was covered with people; women, children, men, all ages and
		sizes&#133;and all Cherokee. They were on the move, flowing around the train to surround
		it on all sides, and yet it did not seem as if any of them had moved off the tracks. The
		Judge had yet to look out the window and thus had no idea what was causing the delay, but
		Rebecca saw the crowd begin to gather three and four deep outside the window and she could
		not keep the smile from her face. Upon seeing that, the Judge swiveled in his seat to look
		past Caleb and his face whitened at the sight of this sea of Indians.</p>

		<p>"Nooooo," he bellowed in rage as he realized the intent
		of those savages. They made no move to board the train, but they formed a solid wall of
		humanity that would be impossible to move through either with the train or on foot, should
		he decide to take his prisoner off the train and strike out by horseback. He turned to his
		clerk who was sitting on the opposite side of the aisle from him and shrieked at him,
		"Go to the front of the train and tell the engineer to plow through those people!
		They&#146;ll have no choice but to move if he starts up the train!" When the clerk
		made no move to get up, the Judge stood up himself and grabbed the smaller man by his
		lapels and pulled him to his feet. "I said go tell him to move this goddamned
		train!" The Judges face was almost purple with anger, but even though he trembled at
		each word that fell from the Judge&#146;s mouth, the clerk shook his head no.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m not going to do it," the younger man finally
		squeaked out. "If you want him to do that, you have to tell him yourself. I
		quit." The Judge released the man as if the very thought of touching him was
		repugnant. He stumbled away from the Judge and sat with the other passengers at the
		opposite end of the train, but not before giving Rebecca a small thumbs up sign.</p>

		<p>Irate, the Judge turned Caleb, who was the only person he had
		left on his side and said, "Keep that gun on her. If she moves, shoot her. I&#146;m
		going to get this train moving again." Caleb fumbled with the weapon and trained it
		on the outlaw across from him. The Judge made his way up the aisle and disappeared into
		the next car.</p>

		<p>Knowing that a man with Caleb&#146;s limited experience with a
		gun was as likely to shoot by mistake as on purpose, Rebecca wanted to talk him into
		lowering the gun. "Pa, you don&#146;t have to point the gun at her. She isn&#146;t
		doing anything. She can&#146;t hurt you. Please, lower that gun before you hurt
		someone."</p>

		<p>Caleb wanted a drink. He wanted to be doing
		something&#133;anything&#133;besides sitting here in the middle of nowhere surrounded by
		Indians with a vicious murderer. The fact that he was the one with the gun was a very
		small consolation. He needed a drink.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll lower the gun if you&#146;ll get me a
		bottle," he finally managed to say around his parched lips. Rebecca turned to Josie
		with a question on her face, and the outlaw gave a small nod. It would buy them some time
		if he were to have a few drinks, not to mention it would slow down his responses and make
		him less likely to pull the trigger. She hoped. At least it would take the gun away for as
		long as it took him to finish a bottle, and that might be enough.</p>

		<p>"Sure. Okay, I will, but please lower the gun now. I&#146;ll
		be right back." Caleb lowered the gun, but kept it on his thigh with the muzzle still
		pointing at Josie&#146;s mid section. His finger was no longer on the trigger however, so
		Josie relaxed somewhat. Rebecca got to her feet and went to where the small group of
		passengers was huddled together, fearing that there could be gunfire at any moment.
		"It&#146;s going to be all right," she told them softly. "Just stay back
		here and you&#146;ll be fine. Do any of you have a bottle of alcohol you can let me have?
		I need to distract the man with the gun." One by one they shook their heads no until
		she looked at the matron who had refused to budge from her seat earlier.</p>

		<p>The woman nodded to indicate she did indeed have a bottle.
		"It&#146;s a fine French wine for my son who just got married," she said
		haughtily. "I would hate to see it wasted on a lout like that." She jerked her
		head in Caleb&#146;s direction with scorn.</p>

		<p>"Please. I&#146;ll pay you for it. I&#146;ll pay twice what
		you paid for it, but I need that bottle now." The woman looked into Rebecca&#146;s
		desperate face, and it reminded her of her own daughter. How could she say no? With a
		grumble Rebecca could not quite hear, the woman reached into a satchel on the seat beside
		her and pulled out a green bottle wrapped in shiny paper.</p>

		<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you so much." Rebecca gave the
		woman a brief hug before returning to her seat and handing the bottle to Caleb.</p>

		<p>Caleb could not unwrap the bottle and keep his hand on the gun,
		so he stuck the weapon in the waistband of his pants. When the paper was removed he saw
		that the bottle cork was flush with the top of the bottle, and he scowled.
		"How&#146;m I supposed to open this damned thing?" he grumbled. The words were
		scarcely out of his mouth before the matron was standing beside Rebecca holding out a
		corkscrew. Wordlessly she took it from her, and handed the tool to Caleb. His hands shook
		quite a bit as he tried to removed the cork, and in the end it was broken to pieces. He
		finally pushed the remaining bits into the bottle figuring he could strain them out with
		his teeth. In fact, he didn&#146;t much care if he drank the whole damned cork&#133;he
		just needed a drink. Tipping the bottle to his lips he took several long swallows until at
		last his hand seemed to steady itself and he began to feel in control of himself. He sat
		back in his seat and smiled at Rebecca, and for a moment she was reminded of the father
		she once had. After only a few moments however, his gaze traveled from Rebecca&#146;s face
		to the front of her dress and he leered. She knew that she would never make the mistake of
		thinking of him as a father again.</p>

		<p>Caleb seemed to retreat into himself a few minutes later, the
		bottle the only reality he knew. Rebecca leaned toward Josie and was about to tell her
		about the gun in her bag when the Judge&#146;s voice once again filled the train car.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"I told you to keep that gun on her!" He bellowed.
		Caleb blinked a few times, tipped up the bottle and took another swallow before pulling
		the gun from his waistband.</p>

		<p>"She ain&#146;t goin&#146; nowhere," he mumbled.
		Nevertheless he pointed the gun at her with one hand while clutching the bottle with the
		other. His finger was loosely on the trigger but it wouldn&#146;t take more than a nudge
		to send a bullet hurtling into Josie. From that distance there was no way he could miss.</p>

		<p>The Judge paced up and down the aisle of the train; his anger
		building with every moment that passed. The engineer had flatly refused to attempt to move
		the train with all those people on the tracks. He had tried to talk them into moving and
		was met with nothing but silence. Turning to the Judge he simply shrugged as if to say
		they were there until something changed. And the something that would undoubtedly change
		would be the afternoon train bearing the Governors car arriving right on schedule in just
		a few hours. If he had a deputy he could trust, the Judge might have tried to shoot his
		way out with the outlaw and take her by stagecoach or horseback. But the drunken sot with
		the bottle to his lips was less than worthless and he knew they would not get a foot away
		from the train before those savages separated him from his prisoner. It had become
		personal for him now. To begin with, she was just another redskin to be taught a lesson,
		but now she was a thorn in his side, and worse; she may just be allowed to wiggle out of
		this if he could not come up with something.</p>

		<p>The Judge stopped his pacing and walked back to stand over Caleb.
		"Looks as if that reward is going to slip through your fingers," he said in a
		sympathetic tone. Caleb dropped the now empty bottle to the floor and turned his bleary
		gaze to the Judge.</p>

		<p>"Huh? Whyizzat? I got her, ain&#146;t I?"</p>

		<p>"You&#146;ve got her, but not for long if these savages have
		anything to do with it." Caleb turned toward the window and scowled at the people
		there. The muzzle of the gun followed his eyes, and Josie&#146;s heart lurched at the
		thought of him opening fire on the unarmed people outside the window. "They&#146;ll
		never let us take her out of here alive," the Judge continued, drawing Caleb&#146;s
		attention back to him and away from the window. Josie visibly relaxed as the gun was once
		again lowered to rest on Caleb&#146;s thigh. The Judge leaned down closer so that his
		words would not be audible to the people at the other end of the car. "Kill her. Her
		dead body is worth nothing to them, but the reward is good, dead or alive. You can say she
		got loose and tried to take the gun from you. You struggled over it, and it went
		off."</p>

		<p>Caleb blinked again as if trying to digest this suggestion. Josie
		and Rebecca had only caught a word or two of what the Judge whispered to Caleb, but it was
		enough to know that the man did not intend to let her live to tell her story to the
		Governor. As Caleb&#146;s mind registered what he had to do, he slowly began to raise the
		gun, stopping when it was pointed squarely at Josie&#146;s heart.</p>

		<p>"Pa, don&#146;t!" Rebecca said loudly to draw his
		attention away from Josie. In that same instant, Josie scooted down in her seat as far as
		she could, kicking up and connecting with the hand that held the gun and sending it flying
		to the far end of the car. Even as that was happening, Rebecca was pulling the gun from
		her bag and before the Judge had even registered what had happened, Rebecca had the gun
		trained on him. "You do anything to hurt her in any way and I&#146;ll kill you,"
		she said evenly. The tone of her voice left no doubt that she meant exactly what she said.</p>

		<p>"Ow," Caleb said, shaking his wrist and rubbing it with
		his hand. It looked as if he had already forgotten that a moment before he had held a gun
		ready to take a woman&#146;s life. Now he simply wondered why his hand hurt.</p>

		<p>"Give me the key to the handcuffs," Rebecca said to
		Caleb. He looked at her blankly for a moment, and she said again, "The key. In your
		watch pocket." She took her eyes off the Judge while she was talking to Caleb, but
		out of the corner of one eye she could see that he was edging down the aisle. As soon as
		Caleb figured out which of his pockets was the watch pocket and handed the key to Rebecca,
		she turned back to the Judge. "Stop where you are and sit down. Now!" The click
		of the hammer pulling back on the gun was like a cannon volley in the quiet car. He
		dropped into an empty seat and glared at her silently while Rebecca unlocked the
		handcuffs. Josie&#146;s wrists were red and chafed in spots and she rubbed them to bring
		back the circulation. Rebecca held the gun out to Josie while keeping the barrel pointed
		at the Judge, but Josie pushed her hand away.</p>

		<p>"I can&#146;t take that," she said seriously. "I
		haven&#146;t broken any laws here, and I&#146;m not starting now. I think possessing a gun
		while in custody would not look very good to the Governor. Besides, you&#146;re doing fine
		without me." She grinned at Rebecca who smiled back broadly. Josie looked to the
		front of the car where the small group of people was finally beginning to relax and said,
		"Will one of you pick up that gun please, and help my friend here keep any eye on
		him?" She jerked her head in the direction of the Judge. Without hesitation, his
		former clerk got up from his seat and fished the weapon out from under the seat where it
		had landed. He walked back up the aisle and sat far enough away so that the Judge could
		not reach him with his foot, and pointed the gun at him.</p>

		<p>"You&#146;ll never work in another court of law, you
		pathetic little worm," the Judge said venomously.</p>

		<p>"That&#146;s certainly true of one of us," the younger
		man replied calmly. The Judge merely sank back into his seat and glared at each of them in
		turn, as if unable to believe that the tables had been so completely turned. He was
		already planning how he would contact a friend who was a General in the army and make sure
		that all these savages paid for what they had done to assist in Josie&#146;s release.</p>

		<p>Josie turned to the window and held up her free hands with the
		handcuffs clutched in her fingers to show the crowd that she was no longer a captive. The
		cheer that rose from the people made tears spring to her eyes, and she quickly turned
		away.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Listen," Rebecca said excitedly. "Did you hear
		that?" It was now late afternoon and she was beginning to wonder if the
		Governor&#146;s train would indeed be arriving.</p>

		<p>"No, what did you&#133;" the far off wail of the train
		whistle cut her off, and she grinned as she took Rebecca&#146;s hand in hers. Now the only
		thing to worry about was whether he was able to connect with that train, but that concern
		would be resolved on way or another very soon.</p>

		<p>Even before the train itself was visible, Josie could see the
		Cherokees begin to shift to the back of the train so that if the incoming train did not
		stop in town, it would be forced to slow down.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>There was no need for that precaution; with a final blast of the
		steam horn, the incoming train came to a stop at the platform. Genie craned her neck to
		see if her husband&#146;s car was hooked up in the back, and when she saw the crest of the
		Governor&#146;s office on the side, she let out a very unladylike whoop and began to run
		to his car. The Sheriff had told her that the train with Josie aboard had been stopped a
		couple of miles out of town and that it would be held there until the Governor arrived.
		She prayed that the Judge had not taken matters into his own hands, having figured out
		that he could no longer hope to succeed in getting Josie extradited.</p>

		<p>The Governor&#146;s footman opened the door of his car and
		extended the step so that the Governor could step down. When he did, he was nearly bowled
		over by Genie as she launched herself into his arms.</p>

		<p>"William, thank God you&#146;re here! He took her already.
		But the Cherokees have stopped the train and they&#146;re waiting for you to come. You
		have to hurry&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Wait a minute, slow down. Let me get my land legs under
		me." His tone was light, but as he looked at her he realized how very worried she
		was. "Where is she? How do I get there?"</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll take you to her," John stepped forward and
		extended his hand which the Governor grasped. "I&#146;m John Kenwood, Sheriff of
		Tahlequah."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca spoke highly of you," William said by way of
		acknowledgement that he knew that the Sheriff was an ally of Josie&#146;s.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m afraid the train she&#146;s on was stopped a few
		miles down the track by some of her supporters who believed &#150; as I do &#150; that it
		was not right to extradite her without a fair hearing. Judge Fellowes was anything but
		fair; he refused to listen to her witnesses. And he made sure to get her out of here
		before you could get here."</p>

		<p>"Well, let&#146;s go hear her side of things, shall
		we?"</p>

		<p>"I have a horse saddled and ready to go. Your wife and some
		of Josie&#146;s friends will follow in wagons, if that&#146;s all right with you. I think
		they want to see for themselves that Miss Josie is all right."</p>

		<p>"I have very little luck in keeping my wife from doing
		exactly what she wants to do, Sheriff. If she&#146;s determined to go, I sure don&#146;t
		want to try and stop her. Let&#146;s go." Indeed, Genie and the rest of Josie&#146;s
		friends were already piling into two wagons that were tied up outside the station house.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"What in the world?" The Governor&#146;s mouth dropped
		open at the sight of so many people surrounding the stilled train. The sea began to part
		as he and the Sheriff rode up, making a path that led to the car that housed the outlaw
		and her lover.</p>

		<p>"She has a lot of supporters," the Sheriff said, as if
		that explained how so many people had known to be on the tracks at the time the train was
		due to leave.</p>

		<p>"I see," the Governor said, leveling his gaze not at
		the assembled multitude but at John. The Sheriff shrugged; he counted himself among her
		staunchest supporters, and he did not care if the Governor knew it. The two men
		dismounted, and hands materialized out of the crowd to take the reins of their horses.
		When they reached the door of the car, a man stepped out of the crowd with a wooden box,
		which he placed in front of the door for a step. He climbed up on the box and wrenched the
		door open, then jumped down and stood aside for the Governor to enter. The people were
		eerily quiet; even the children stood silently watching as he mounted the step and entered
		the car.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The occupants of the car were aware that something was happening
		even before the door opened. The Judge had made a move to rise from his seat, but his
		former clerk pulled back the hammer on the gun that was pointed unswervingly at his head,
		and he fell back into his seat without a word. Rebecca had put Josie&#146;s gun back in
		her bag. There was no need to keep Caleb covered; he had passed out shortly after
		finishing the bottle of wine. And the clerk had the Judge well in hand.</p>

		<p>Rebecca turned when the door was flung open, and when she saw
		William step into the car, followed by John she was on her feet and moving toward them.
		She threw her arms around William&#146;s neck and kissed his cheek. "Am I ever glad
		to see you," she enthused. Then she stepped to where John stood and hugged and kissed
		him as well. The blush that suffused his cheeks was clear to anyone who looked.
		"John&#133;I don&#146;t even know what to say. She owes her life to you. How can we
		ever repay you?"</p>

		<p>"Just&#133;live a long and happy life. That&#146;s all I
		want."</p>

		<p>"Thank you. We will."</p>

		<p>The conductor tapped John on the shoulder, and the Sheriff turned
		to see a very angry looking man.</p>

		<p>"You the one responsible for keeping my train here?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Then I&#146;ll thank you to take your business elsewhere
		and let us get underway."</p>

		<p>"Yes, of course. I&#146;m sorry. Give me a few minutes to
		get the people off the tracks and we&#146;ll let you go on your way." John stepped
		outside to talk to the Cherokee&#146;s, and before he even returned the tracks were free
		of people. The sound of the steam engine firing up brought a cheer from the passengers who
		had been sitting for the better part of the day. But Josie knew they would all have a
		story to tell about Josie Hunter and the Cherokees who stopped the train when they reached
		their destination. It was probably the most excitement many of them had seen in their
		lives.</p>

		<p>Rebecca led the Governor to where Josie still sat, and she
		introduced them. "Funny. You don&#146;t look like a cold blooded killer," he
		said lightly as he shook her hand.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "And you don&#146;t look much like a Greek
		God, but you must be because that&#146;s what Genie said she married." William threw
		back his head and laughed.</p>

		<p>"You should hear what she said about you," he quipped.</p>

		<p>"Will you please get these people off my train!" The
		conductor snapped at John, who in turn tapped the Governor on the shoulder.</p>

		<p>"We need to get off the train, sir. I&#146;ll take Miss
		Josie&#146;s bag if you will get Miss Rebecca&#146;s."</p>

		<p>"All right. There&#146;s just one thing I have to do
		first." He walked to where the Judge sat glowering and fuming. John had filled him in
		completely on the way to the train, and there was no doubt in his mind that this man had
		completely lost his objectivity &#150; if indeed he had ever had any &#150; and had no
		business sitting in judgement of his fellow man. "Mr. Fellowes, you are disbarred.
		Your license to practice law in the Territory of Oklahoma is revoked. And I suggest that
		if you hope to continue in the legal field at all that you do so as far away from here as
		you can get, as I plan to make sure that our neighboring states get an earful about you.
		Is that perfectly clear?"</p>

		<p>The Judge said nothing; he knew he was hopelessly outnumbered.
		The Governor turned back to Josie and offered her his arm. "Miss Hunter, I believe we
		need to vacate these premises before Attila the Hun over there tosses us out on our
		ears." The conductor scowled as Josie stood and took William&#146;s arm.</p>

		<p>"That&#146;s the best invitation I&#146;ve had all
		day," she quipped. William collected Rebecca&#146;s bag and the three of them made
		their way from the train. John paused to get the gun from the clerk and was on his way
		back when Rebecca poked her head in the door.</p>

		<p>"Can you arrest Caleb for something and bring him with you,
		John? I need time to contact my sister and get her out of that house before he gets back
		there."</p>

		<p>"Well, he&#146;s drunk in a public place. I suppose I can
		hold him for a day or so on that." He pushed Caleb forward in his seat and put his
		arms under the sleeping man&#146;s arms and around his chest. With a heave he pulled him
		up and dragged him to the door. Caleb never stirred even as he was handed out to several
		of the Cherokee&#146;s who were still milling around beside the train. John grabbed
		Josie&#146;s bag from the rack and jumped out of the car just as the whistle blew and the
		wheels began to move.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The parlor in the boarding house was completely packed with
		friends and well-wishers who came out to say good-bye to Josie and Rebecca. It had taken
		no time at all for the Governor to decide against extradition for Josie, and the
		celebration had begun shortly after the decision was announced. Rebecca sent a telegram to
		Katy telling her to come to Oklahoma where Genie had said she could stay indefinitely
		until Josie and Rebecca settled out west, at which time Katy would join them.</p>

		<p>Charles and Horace were playing song after song, and everyone was
		either singing along or dancing. Josie and Rebecca were both constantly being whisked away
		to dance with someone besides each other, but knowing that this may be the last time they
		may see these friends, they whirled and danced with everyone who asked. No one seemed to
		notice that most of the dancers were women, or if they noticed, they did not care.</p>

		<p>Josie turned to a tap on the shoulder to find Genie standing
		behind her, her hands outstretched. "I think it&#146;s about my turn," Genie
		said with a smile. Josie nodded and pulled the smaller woman into her arms. They were
		playing a slow tune, and Genie&#146;s head naturally rested on Josie&#146;s shoulder, her
		body moving in perfect rhythm with the tall gunslinger. Josie felt a soft inhalation and a
		sigh before Genie pulled herself a bit farther away so she could look into the blue pools
		that were Josie&#146;s eyes. "Sometimes," Genie said softly, "I wish we
		had&#133;taken that next step in our relationship. I knew you wanted to; I could tell by
		the way that you looked at me. I wanted it to, but I was afraid. Can you forgive me for
		being such a coward?"</p>

		<p>"There&#146;s nothing to forgive. I knew you loved me too. I
		always thought that if we had not been so tragically separated we would have become
		lovers. But that&#146;s so long ago now. You have William and I have Rebecca, and
		we&#146;re both happy. But you&#146;ll always be the first woman that I loved, and the
		place you own in my heart no one can ever share." As the music ended, she kissed
		Genie on the forehead before allowing herself to be turned by yet another hand on her
		shoulder. This one belonged to Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"I heard that," the little blonde said softly.
		"And I know there is a part of you that will always belong to her." Josie opened
		her mouth to speak, but Rebecca touched her lips with her fingers to silence her.
		"No, it&#146;s all right. I accept it. I could never ask you to let go of something
		so precious to you. All I ask is that you remember who loves you now, and tell me if there
		is ever anything I should be worried about. Promise me?"</p>

		<p>"You have nothing to worry about&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Promise?"</p>

		<p>"I promise." The soft notes of "Beautiful
		Dreamer" began to play, and Josie held out her hand to Rebecca. "May I have this
		dance?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. And all the dances of my life." She stepped into
		her arms and they whirled into their future.</p>
