	<chapter title="15: Tombstone">
		<p>Josie left Phoenix at the OK Corral and the pair walked over to
		the saloon. Rebecca had wisely changed into her dress. Despite it's battered appearance,
		it would certainly raise fewer questions than her britches would. Josie of course remained
		in her dark outfit, looking every bit the outlaw. She grabbed the younger woman's upper
		arm and pulled her close to speak before entering the saloon. "Listen to me
		carefully. Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone, and never leave my side." The
		look in her blue eyes and the tone in her voice made it clear that this wasn't any kind of
		request. Rebecca nodded, noting somewhere in the back of her mind that at least the outlaw
		was bringing her in instead of leaving her somewhere else to wait for her. </p>

		<p>Pushing the swinging half doors apart Josie strode in and took an
		all-encompassing look around. A long bar took up the wall on the left, while stairs and a
		piano took the wall at the far end. The right side of the saloon consisted of several
		small green felt covered round tables surrounded by chairs, some of which looked ready to
		fall apart. Josie kept Rebecca between her and the door as they walked over to the bar.
		"Whiskey," she ordered, and as an afterthought she added, "and
		sarsaparilla." </p>

		<p>There was no question as to which drink belonged to whom. The
		portly barkeep placed the shot glass and bottle in front of the tall woman and handed the
		smaller woman the non-alcoholic drink. "Two bits for the whiskey and twenty cents for
		the soda." </p>

		<p>Josie tossed the coins on the bar and turned to watch the goings
		on. Her eyes fell on a table of three men playing poker. With one gulp, she drained her
		drink and set the glass on the bar. "Stay here," she said before walking over to
		the trio. </p>

		<p>"Hello boys." They looked up from their battered cards
		to see the imposing woman towering over them. "You seem to be short. Is my money any
		good at this table?" </p>

		<p>The biggest of the men, a large, burly fellow with a scraggly
		beard and a long jagged scar across his face looked at the meager pot in front of him. The
		potential benefit from letting this woman into the game was appealing. Despite the six
		guns slung low on her hips, she was still a woman, and he had no doubt that he could
		handle himself well enough with any woman alive. He grinned to reveal uneven rows of brown
		teeth and tipped his hat to the gunslinger. "Why, shore, there's always room for a
		pretty gal at our table, right boys?" The others were not as certain as their large
		friend of their ability to handle themselves with someone as formidable as this woman
		appeared to be. But they silently agreed that there was safety in numbers, and did nothing
		to dissuade her from sitting down. She pulled a chair out and dropped into it. </p>

		<p>"Deal," she said with a smile that did not do anything
		to remove the icy glint from her eyes. </p>

		<p>Two hours later, the burly man threw his cards down in disgust
		and slowly rose, making sure to keep his hands away from his sidearm. "You've broken
		me, Miss. I'm done." Josie nodded with satisfaction as she pulled the last pot
		closer. No sooner had she gotten the notes and coins into her pocket than the skinny man
		sitting across from her narrowed his gaze and lowered his hand below the table. He'd be
		damned if a woman was going to walk away with his money. Before he could get his hand on
		his gun, the table suddenly flipped upwards at him, blocking his vision before slamming
		into him with enough force to send him backward, his chair splintering upon contact with
		the wooden floor. The third man in the group had similar thoughts and made a move for his
		gun. A roundhouse kick sent her heel into the side of his face and the fight was on. None
		of the patrons seemed to care what the fight was about as they began scrapping with each
		other. Rebecca worked her way closer and closer to the swinging doors, ducking once as
		part of a chair came flying at her. She tried to locate Josie in the mass pandemonium of
		flying bodies and smashing bottles. She found her only when two men tossed the dark clad
		woman down the length of the bar. With a gleeful yelp, Josie stood up on the bar and
		looked for the best place to jump back into the fray. She somersaulted off the bar and
		landed with her feet against the chest of a very surprised patron. After a couple of
		minutes the barkeep sighed, threw his towel down on the bar, and buried his face in his
		hands while shaking his head in disbelief. A few minutes later Josie appeared at Rebecca's
		side apparently no worse for wear, although her shirtsleeve was almost completely torn
		off. "Having fun?" she asked breathlessly before grabbing two men and knocking
		their heads together. </p>

		<p>"Not as much as you seem to be having," Rebecca quipped
		as she jumped back to avoid another flying body. </p>

		<p>"Nothing like a good fight to get my juices flowing,"
		Josie replied with a feral smile still on her face as she looked around at the rolling
		battle. The sound of a shotgun being fired several times into the ceiling brought the
		bedlam to a standstill as everyone turned to see the source of the shots. The barkeep was
		standing there, gun in hand, covered with dust from the ceiling that he had shot. He
		looked up at the holes and sighed again. </p>

		<p>"Every time a woman comes in, there's trouble," he
		muttered, his gaze leveled at the pair near the doorway. Josie reached in her pocket and
		pulled out several bills then put them on the bar before turning and leaving. The barkeep
		looked at the retreating form in surprise as he picked up the notes from the counter.
		</p>

		<p>"What happened in there?" Rebecca asked as they headed
		up the street to the boarding house. </p>

		<p>"The pip-squeak across from me didn't like losing to a
		woman," she said casually as she inspected the torn shirt. "Looks like you'll be
		doing some sewing tonight." </p>

		<p>"I don't mind." Rebecca answered as she looked at the
		jagged tear. The shirt wasn't much to begin with; the elbows were worn almost through, the
		collar was frayed, and two buttons hung loosely by their threads. "Although the best
		thing to do would be to get you a new shirt." The look she received told her that was
		out of the question. "Or I could sew this one up," she said with a tone of
		defeat in her voice. </p>

		<p>"Ten dollars?" The muscles in Josie's jaw tensed
		noticeably. "No way in tarnation am I going to pay that much!" She turned and
		stomped over to the door assuming that Rebecca would follow. The young woman had other
		ideas, however. </p>

		<p>"Look, you have to admit that ten dollars is a lot to ask
		for such a..." she paused and looked around the parlor as if to pick just the right
		word. "...quaint little place. After all, the flophouse near the corral only charges
		four dollars a week for both of us." </p>

		<p>"I include one meal a day with my price," the boarding
		house owner protested. "Eight dollars." </p>

		<p>"Six and you throw in a bath for tonight," the young
		woman countered. Josie watched the debate carefully. Clearly Rebecca had the knowledge of
		words and the wit to haggle efficiently. </p>

		<p>"Seven and the bath." </p>

		<p>She started to say 'six', but the look on the proprietress face
		told her she would not go any lower. Rebecca knew that seven was more than fair for two
		people. She decided to quit before she talked them into sleeping in the corral with the
		horses. "All right, seven, but that had better include the bath." </p>

		<p>"I said it did, didn't I," the woman said irritably.
		"Take the room at the end of the hall. Outhouse is in back." </p>

		<p>Rebecca turned to Josie, a bit fearful that the outlaw would be
		mad at her for stepping in. Instead, the tall woman nodded and handed over the required
		funds. While it wasn't a smile or words of praise, the young woman still somehow
		understood the silent message that was conveyed. </p>

		<p>Rebecca stood nervously at the side of the bed, looking at it as
		if there were sharp razors waiting for her. "What's the problem?" Josie said as
		she removed her clothes. "Haven't you ever slept with another woman before?"
		</p>

		<p>"No! Why..." she stopped when she realized what the
		outlaw meant. Blushing hotly, she continued. "I mean, well, with my sister and
		occasionally a cousin, but...." She turned away from the now naked woman. "I
		guess I'm just a bit shy." </p>

		<p>"So it would seem," Josie replied as she pulled a
		nightshirt over her head and down her body. Although designed for a full-grown man, it
		only came to mid thigh on her tall frame. "Are you going to sleep in your
		dress?" </p>

		<p>"What? Oh no, of course not." She turned and walked
		behind the privacy screen, not seeing the way Josie rolled her eyes and smiled. </p>

		<p>They each lay on an edge of the bed trying to stay as far apart
		as possible to leave room for the other. Always a deep sleeper, Rebecca was out quickly.
		Josie, however, was easily awakened by the slightest noise and found the young woman's
		light snoring to be distracting. Several times she adjusted her pillow to try to muffle
		the sounds, but with no success; her keen hearing wouldn't allow it. She lay awake as hour
		after hour passed. In the darkness of the night, the loner reflected back on her life. She
		saw visions of the crimes she had committed over the years, the looks of abject terror on
		the faces of her victims. Years of running, robbing, and hard drinking had blocked all
		those sights from her mind. As dawn settled across the land, she thought about how she had
		helped the town of Mason's Gulch and the sense of accomplishment she felt when she had
		stopped the band of thieves. It was time for her to make a decision, one that would
		forever alter her life one way or another. She had never consciously made a choice to be a
		criminal; it had happened by accident. For the first time in years she believed she
		actually had a choice between being good or evil. The full sun was visible before she
		gathered the courage to make the only choice that she could live with. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="16: Careers">
		<p>After a quick breakfast consisting of the remains of their
		rations, Josie wrote a note telling Rebecca to stay put and then left the boarding house.
		With purposeful strides she crossed the street and entered the jail. </p>

		<p>"What can I do for you today, young fella?" the sheriff
		asked without looking up from his solitaire hand. </p>

		<p>"I want to look at the wanted list," she said in a
		commanding tone. His head popped up at the unexpected gender. </p>

		<p>"Uh...yes, of course." He reached over and retrieved a
		stack of wanted posters piled haphazardly on the corner of his desk. As he passed the pile
		to her, he realized that he was using his gun hand and was defenseless should this tall
		woman in black choose to send him to Saint Peter. To his relief, she simply took the pile
		of papers and sat down in a nearby chair, apparently uninterested in him.
		"Uh...somethin' you're looking for...uh...Miss?" </p>

		<p>Josie smiled inwardly at the sheriff's fear of her. "Just
		seeing who's worth what," she replied, her eyes pouring over the wanted posters. She
		studied every name, what they were wanted for and where. She studied each likeness and
		tried to commit each characteristic to memory. She also removed the poster with her own
		likeness on it and slid it off the stack and into her pocket. Wouldn't do to have the
		sheriff spot her picture so soon after seeing her in the flesh. After several minutes she
		stood up and put the pile back on the corner of his desk. "I suggest you double check
		the locks on your cells. I have a feeling you'll be filling up soon," she said as she
		walked out the door, leaving a confused and nervous sheriff behind. </p>

		<p>She reviewed the list of wanted men in her mind, discarding some
		as not being worth the bother and making mental notes on others. Horse thieves weren't on
		her list of those to turn in for justice. Although she had bought and paid for Phoenix,
		she herself had stolen a number of horses in her day. Deciding that no man should die for
		stealing an animal, she moved on in her mental list to concentrate on those she would look
		for. Men who raped or murdered women and children were highest on her list. Her eyes
		narrowed when she saw the familiar blonde woman exiting the doctor's office. Her long legs
		quickly ate up the distance between them. </p>

		<p>"What are you doing here? Are you sick?" She began a
		visual inspection of Rebecca. </p>

		<p>"No, I thought I could learn something about healing while
		you were off doing whatever it is that you were doing." It was then that Josie
		noticed the two small jars that were in the young woman's hands. "Oh, one is for
		cleaning a wound and the other is to help with pain." </p>

		<p>"How much did those cost?" Josie asked warily, her mind
		already trying to calculate the amount. </p>

		<p>"Nothing. He gave me these small bottles for helping
		him." </p>

		<p>"Helping him?" </p>

		<p>"A young boy came in with a broken arm. I told him a story
		while the doctor put a splint on. You should have seen him, Josie. His name is Timothy and
		he didn't cry, not one bit. He just sat there and listened to my story." The smile on
		her face and tone of pride in her voice were infectious and Josie reluctantly allowed a
		small smile. They walked back to the boarding house together, Rebecca recounting all that
		she had learned in the short time she was with the doctor and spoke of going back later to
		learn more. Josie didn't miss the hopeful 'see I'm trying to learn something so I can
		help' tone in the young woman's voice, although her face remained impassive. </p>

		<p>After a quick supper that was barely edible, the pair retired to
		their room. The gunslinger sat on the floor, bracing her back against a wall while the
		young woman sat on the bed, using the headboard as a backrest. Josie went through her
		usual routine of cleaning and inspecting her weapons while Rebecca read by lamplight. Doc
		Jackson had loaned her a beginner's medical text and she was voraciously reading it,
		absorbing as many details as she could about different emergency treatments for wounds and
		illness. She skipped over rare or unusual injuries, concentrating mostly on things she
		perceived could happen on the road; snake bites, bullet wounds, scorpion stings, and more.
		Josie watched out of the corner of her eye as page after page was turned in Rebecca's
		quest for knowledge. 'I'll give you one thing, sprite; you have determination,' Josie
		thought to herself as she turned her attention back to the task at hand, that being the
		polishing of her guns. </p>

		<p>When Rebecca rubbed her eyes for the third time in an hour, Josie
		set her rifle down and stood. "I think that's enough reading for one night."
		Taking the book from the reluctant girl, she set it down on the table and prepared for
		bed. Exhaustion got the best of the outlaw and she fell asleep soon after hitting the
		pillow. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="17: Nightmares and Understandings">
		<p>It was after two when Rebecca woke to her bedmate thrashing about
		in the throes of another vicious nightmare. Josie's arms flailed about, barely missing her
		face. Once again Rebecca took the outlaw in her arms and softly began to sing. Between
		verses she whispered that it was all a dream and that everything was all right. In the
		darkness of the night, she heard the older woman whimper softly before falling into a more
		dreamless state. She continued to sing and stroke Josie's hair gently until she was
		certain that she was past the nightmare. She would be wakened twice more during the night
		by the outlaw's demons and both times she would calm the woman back to restful sleep.
		Rebecca allowed herself to feel the mixed emotions of wishing that the nightmares didn't
		happen and the pleasure in being able to soothe Josie's troubled sleep as she finally
		succumbed again to the sandman. </p>

		<p>Rebecca awoke to find herself alone in the room, the sun shining
		brightly. With a groan, she buried her head under the pillow to block out the light and
		tried for a few more minutes of sleep. The sound of the door opening caused her to poke
		her head up from under the pillow, look at the bright eyed and wide awake gunslinger,
		groan and put her head back down. "Five more minutes," she mumbled. </p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's after nine already. I've been up for at least
		three hours. Let's go." She set the two mugs of coffee down on the table. "I
		mean it." </p>

		<p>"I'm up, I'm up," she grumbled before sitting up and
		stretching. She plodded over to the table and flopped down in the chair, muttering a thank
		you as she took her mug. </p>

		<p>"You're not a morning person, are you?" Josie asked
		before taking a gulp of her coffee and grimacing. "Damn, this is strong. Miss
		Patricia must be trying to kill us so she can rent this room out to someone else."
		</p>

		<p>Rebecca chuckled and took a sip from hers. "Ugh, I think
		you're right," she said as she forced the bitter brew down her throat. In the moment
		of silence, she decided to broach the subject of the nightmares. "Josie, do you
		remember the nightmares you had last night?" She watched the gunslinger stiffen
		noticeably. "It's okay if you don't want to talk about it, but I know that it helps
		sometimes to talk about them." </p>

		<p>"There's nothing to talk about, Rebecca. I don't remember
		it," she lied. Even in the light of day, her mind replayed the visions that tormented
		her during the night. </p>

		<p>"Well, if you wanted to talk about it, I just wanted you to
		know that you could...with me, I mean," she said before drinking the rest of her
		coffee and standing up. Josie nodded noncommittally. Rebecca stepped behind the privy
		screen and started to get dressed. "So where did you go?" </p>

		<p>"I had to get some information. You know what you said about
		being a bounty hunter does make sense." </p>

		<p>"Well yeah, you can get into places where regular bounty
		hunters couldn't. You know how these men think, how they act." She tried to tighten
		the laces on her corset, but this particular one tied in the back. "Josie, can you
		help me with this?" Seconds later she felt strong fingers pulling the laces into
		place and tying them off. "Thanks," she said as she turned around and looked up
		at the tall woman. "You know, I really do hate corsets." </p>

		<p>"Me too, that's why I don't wear them," Josie said,
		allowing a small smile to come to her lips. "Now, I have a list of names of men that
		would bring in a fair amount of money with little effort." They went back to the
		table and sat down. Rebecca busied herself with brushing her shoulder length hair. Josie
		took another gulp of coffee and continued. "Cletus Wilson is a no good bully with a
		bounty of a hundred dollars on his head here in Tombstone. I went to the watering hole
		this morning and found out where he's hiding." </p>

		<p>"How did...?" Rebecca smiled and shook her head.
		"After seeing you in action yesterday, I'm sure I don't want to know." </p>

		<p>Josie flashed a smile full of teeth, quite proud of her
		intimidation tactics. "You probably don't, sprite. Now I want you to stay here or at
		the Doc's place until I return." </p>

		<p>"Okay.", she nodded. "But promise you'll be
		careful?" </p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." </p>

		<p>"Sorry, but I do worry about you," she protested.
		"Someone has to." </p>

		<p>"Well, I think you worry enough about me for the both of us.
		Now don't go anywhere until I return." </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="18: First Bounty">
		<p>Josie crouched down in the bushes, concealing herself from the
		man hiding in the bunkhouse. Wilson wasn't worth that much, but it would be enough for her
		to leave with Rebecca and move on. He was wanted for armed robbery and was known to drink
		far too much in the evenings. All she had to do was wait for him to pass out and then she
		could tie him up and bring him back to town. Her eyes fell on a buckboard nearby. It would
		be perfect to transport him with. She stole over to the barn and found one strapping
		horse, albeit a bit smaller than Phoenix, who was still safely tucked away at the OK
		Corral. Still, he would do the job. Josie settled back in the bushes and waited for
		nightfall to come.</p>

		<p>Rebecca returned the book to Doc Jackson and looked around at the
		stores that littered the sides of the main street. Her eyes fell upon the saloon and her
		mouth watered for something tastier than stale water and bad coffee. She couldn't imagine
		any reason why she shouldn't go in and have a sarsaparilla or two or even a beer. Slipping
		two of the dollars Josie gave her into her bodice, Rebecca headed up the street and
		entered the watering hole.</p>

		<p>Signs of yesterday's activities were still apparent throughout
		the room. A pile of wood that used to be tables and chairs was piled in the corner, and a
		fair amount of broken glass was swept into a pile in the middle of the floor. Rebecca
		noted that two of the large mirrors on the wall showed cracks that she hadn't noticed
		there before. The barkeep looked up from polishing the bar and spotted her. He frowned and
		looked around for her trouble-making friend before walking up to her. "I don't want
		another fight in here today, Miss. Now you look like a nice child, you shouldn't be
		hangin' out in a place like this."</p>

		<p>"I'd like a sarsaparilla, please.", she said firmly,
		trying to sound every bit like her taller companion. The barkeep shook his head in defeat
		and handed her the bottle of soda. No sooner did she place her hand around the glass then
		his eyes widened and she heard footsteps behind her.</p>

		<p>"Well, now lookie what we have here? If it ain't the purty
		little thing that was with that bitch in black yesterday," the lanky man who sat
		across from Josie during the card game said as he put his grimy hand on Rebecca's
		shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Uh oh," she said softly, instantly regretting
		disobeying Josie's instructions.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>It was nearly daybreak when Josie pulled into town on the
		buckboard with her captive securely tied up in the back. She left the sheriff's office a
		few minutes later with a note for the bank to retrieve her money. The distrusting teller
		tested her patience as he stalled turning over the money to the well-armed woman. It took
		her returning with the sheriff in tow to retrieve her cash. After a long day of waiting,
		all she wanted to do was crawl into bed and sleep.</p>

		<p>The two mugs from yesterday's coffee were still sitting on the
		table when Josie entered their room. Frowning, she checked around to make sure that all
		their belongings were still there. She went downstairs and found the round woman who ran
		the boarding house.</p>

		<p>"Where's Rebecca?" The look she received from Miss
		Patricia chilled her to the bone.</p>

		<p>"I thought she was with you. I haven't seen her since
		yesterday. She left shortly after you did." There was fear in her eyes, but no sign
		of deceit. Josie turned on her heels and headed to the doctor's office.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Two hours later, Josie was leaning on a hitching post, looking
		around and trying to figure out where Rebecca could have gone. Lifting her hat and wiping
		her brow, her eyes fell upon the slatted doors of the saloon. Well, it wouldn't hurt to
		wet her whistle, she thought.</p>

		<p>The barkeep gave her a terrified look that went beyond the
		activities of two days past. "Whiskey," she barked as she leaned against the
		bar. She noted that his hands were shaking as he set the small glass in front of her.
		"I'm looking for my friend, the one that was with me the other day. You seen
		her?" Her tone made it clear that a lie wouldn't be tolerated. Sweat began to form on
		his brow as he backed up slowly. Quick as a cat, Josie reached over the bar and grabbed
		his shirt at the throat. She jerked him forward, slamming his gut against the wooden bar
		and stared menacingly at him, her face mere inches away from his. "Now you listen
		here, little man. Where is she?"</p>

		<p>"Ah...she...well..." She jerked him one more time,
		making sure that bruises would be left behind. "Ugh...he took her."</p>

		<p>"Who?" Her anger was at a frightening level as she
		cocked a gun and placed it against his nose. "I want answers and I want
		them...now," she nudged the cool steel against his face to punctuate her point.</p>

		<p>"Smith. Tom Smith...he took her." At her questioning
		look he added, "He's the one from the poker game."</p>

		<p>"Where?", she growled.</p>

		<p>"Ah..." Beads of sweat were rolling down his face,
		which was turning red from her grip on his collar. "Small ranch 'bout two hours north
		of here. The Double S."</p>

		<p>Without another word, she shoved him back and left the bar. It
		only took a few minutes to saddle Phoenix and tear off in search of her young friend.
		'Hurt her and I'll kill you,' she vowed. She also decided that Tombstone was too dangerous
		a place for Rebecca to stay without her.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca pounded on the door again. "Please let me out. It
		stinks in here," she bellowed, knowing that no one could hear her. The outhouse was
		too far away from the main house. She shoved at the door again. The ropes used to hold the
		door closed showed no signs of budging. "Of all the places to stick me," she
		muttered before resuming her pounding.</p>

		<p>Josie looked down from her perch on the hillside at the lone
		ranch. The area was too wide open and flat for her to attempt anything during the day. If
		she made a run at the ranch, Rebecca would be dead before she could reach her. Being out
		of earshot, she was unable to hear the young woman's calls for help from the small
		building set so far behind the main house. The gunslinger forced herself not to think
		about the possibilities of what could happen to her young friend while she waited. It was
		hard enough not to go blazing in there with guns drawn without having to think of
		Rebecca's innocence being threatened. She impatiently waited for darkness to fall.</p>

		<p>Two lamps burned brightly inside the ranch as Josie crept up
		alongside the small building. She needed to know how many men she was dealing with and
		exactly where Rebecca was before she could make a move. Looking through the small window
		partially obscured by a dirty piece of cloth being used as a makeshift curtain she could
		only make out some of the room, noting that there were two rooms off of the main room that
		she couldn't see into. She watched as the lanky man she fought with at the saloon rose and
		headed to the door. She quietly slipped around the side as he came outside. She watched as
		he pulled down his britches, squatted, and relieved himself. Her brow furrowed. Why was he
		doing that there instead of the outhouse? He went back inside and she headed behind the
		house. She grinned when she saw the ropes wrapped around the small wooden structure.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca," she whispered.</p>

		<p>"Josie? Oh Josie, please let me out of here."</p>

		<p>"Shh." There was silence for a moment before Rebecca
		heard the sound of the ropes being cut and the door opening. She stepped out and fell to
		her knees, gulping in draughts of fresh air. Josie grabbed her and pulled her behind the
		side of the outhouse. "Are you all right?" In the dim moonlight, she tried to
		visually inspect Rebecca for any signs that would confirm her fears.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine, I'm just glad you're here."</p>

		<p>"Come on, I want to be long gone before he realizes that
		you're missing."</p>

		<p>It was at that time that Smith decided to go check on his
		captive. He was really disappointed that the tall bitch in black hadn't decided to pay him
		a visit. He was looking forward to getting her back for his black eye. He chuckled to
		himself as he thought of other things he could be looking forward to. It didn't make a
		difference to him if that girl lived or died; she was only good as bait for the bitch.
		Perhaps a little fun with her was called for, a payback to her friend for besting him in
		cards. He froze when he saw the partially open door to the outhouse. He never heard her
		come up behind him. One sharp contact with the butt of her gun on his skull was all it
		took to send him bonelessly to the ground.</p>

		<p>"What are you going to do with him?" Rebecca asked as
		she watched Josie tie his hands and feet together.</p>

		<p>"Take him back to town to answer for his crime." She
		double-checked her knots before stepping away from him. "He's lucky I didn't just
		kill him."</p>

		<p>"Josie, I wasn't hurt. Just shaken up a bit."</p>

		<p>"But you could have been," Josie snapped, taking a step
		closer to her. "What in tarnation did you think you were doing going into a saloon
		alone? You could have been killed." She grabbed the smaller woman's chin and forced
		her gaze upward to look at her. "Or worse, Rebecca. When I tell you to stay
		somewhere, stay there."</p>

		<p>"I-I'm sorry," she stammered. Josie released her grip
		and took a step back.</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, Rebecca. Just improve. I'm tired of
		rescuing you." There was anger in her voice, but something else as well, a touch of
		concern. She turned to pick up her quarry and place him across the back of his horse.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for saving me...again," Rebecca said softly.
		She was certain that Josie heard her, but chose to ignore her.</p>

		<p>Josie looked at Rebecca's dirty dress, then at the horse, then
		back to her. "How did he get you here?"</p>

		<p>"He uh kinda threw me over the saddle. That horn really
		hurts when it's pressed against your ribs, you know."</p>

		<p>"No, Rebecca, I've never had that pleasure," she
		sighed. "You'll just have to ride side saddle. We can't keep cutting your dresses
		every time you need to ride."</p>

		<p>The ride back to town took longer than it should have because
		Josie had to make certain that Smith didn't fall off the horse, although she was tempted
		to shove him off a few times just to see him fall to the ground. Once he woke up and tried
		to wiggle off the saddle only to have Josie knock him back into dreamland.</p>

		<p>After depositing him with the sheriff, Josie dropped Rebecca off
		at the boarding house and took the horses to the corral. Despite wanting a hot bath, Josie
		opted for the cool sheets and soft pillow upon returning to the room. She was so tired
		that she didn't even bother to remove her boots or holsters. It took some effort but
		Rebecca finally managed to get the two holsters off. She gave up on the idea of pulling
		the black leather boots off and decided to wear her own to bed to protect her feet from
		the hard heels. Crawling into bed next to her protector, she whispered a quiet thank you
		before settling down on her side and going to sleep.</p>

	<chapter title="19: Moving On">
		<p>After a quick breakfast and cup of coffee, the pair headed over
		to the corral to retrieve the horses and put Tombstone behind them. Since they were going
		to be on the road again, Rebecca had changed from her worn dress to her britches and
		shirt. Once at the corral, Josie went to pay the owner while Rebecca went in to feed the
		horses a few apples. They weren't ripe enough for humans, but the animals didn't seem to
		mind. Rebecca was still intimidated by the palomino's sheer size, but was bound and
		determined to make friends with the horse. The gray mare in the next stall whinnied and
		nudged her with her nose every time Rebecca turned her attention to the big palomino. Even
		though the little horse had been with them for some time, it was the first time Rebecca
		had ever really looked at her. The little horse had a gentle, sweet expression; Rebecca
		could almost swear she was smiling. "Now stop pushing me," she squealed as she
		backed up out of reach. "Oh, you're a cute one," she said, stepping in front of
		the gray horse's stall. She held out one apple, which the horse took eagerly. Rebecca took
		advantage of the busy mouth and stroked the mare's nose. "Oh, you like that, don't
		you?", she cooed. Phoenix nickered in protest and she complied with another apple.
		"Now don't be jealous Phoenix." She went back to scratching the gray horse.
		"I don't remember you being so friendly before," she said as she started to use
		both hands to scratch and rub the smaller horse, who snorted with enjoyment. She didn't
		hear Josie enter the stable and lean up against one of the supports.</p>

		<p>"Do you like her?" Her voice caused Rebecca to jump
		slightly. </p>

		<p>"Well, as far as horses go, she's fine." She almost
		added a comment about the mare being friendlier than Phoenix but decided against it. </p>

		<p>"She's yours," Josie said. Rebecca turned around and
		looked at her with a look of confusion.</p>

		<p>"I...I guess I have been thinking of her as mine ever
		since...."</p>

		<p>Josie laughed and shook her head. "Rebecca, this isn't the
		horse we picked up...back there." She pointed to a stall on the opposite end of the
		stable. "That's the horse we've had with us all along." Rebecca looked from one
		horse to the other, and could not imagine how she had mistaken this sweet little mare for
		that one. </p>

		<p>"Really? Oh Josie," she moved over and wrapped her arms
		around the taller woman's waist as she gave her a hug.</p>

		<p>"Really," she answered as she extricated the younger
		woman's arms from around her body. "Rebecca, I don't like to be hugged."</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry," she said, but the twinkle never left her
		green eyes. "How did you come by this horse?"</p>

		<p>Josie shrugged as if it was no big deal. "She was with the
		man I brought in for the bounty. Her and the buckboard. Since her disposition seemed
		more...suitable for you, I decided to sell the other horse and keep this one for
		you."</p>

		<p>"Buckboard? You mean I won't have to walk everywhere or ride
		behind you?" She gave a look up at Phoenix, her eyes showing her dislike of riding
		upon the massive steed.</p>

		<p>"It would seem that way." With the look of happiness in
		Rebecca's eyes, Josie didn't have the heart to mention that it was still a short-term
		arrangement. "Let's get them ready."</p>

		<p>An hour later they were on the road again. They rode on the flat
		wagon, Josie handling the reins for the mare while Phoenix walked behind, tethered to the
		back of the buckboard. Rebecca sat next to the gunslinger, holding the Winchester in case
		Josie needed it. Time passed while she related the different things she had learned from
		Doc Jackson's medical book and tales of American history. At some point, she decided that
		since the mare was her horse she had to give her a name. "Flossy," she said.</p>

		<p>"Flossy?" Josie gave her a look. "You've got to be
		kidding."</p>

		<p>"Nope. I like it. Do you like it, Flossy?" To Josie's
		dismay, the mare whinnied in agreement with the new name from the honey-voiced woman.
		"Flossy it is then."</p>

		<p>"Flossy," Josie said as she rolled her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Hey, be nice. I could have named her Petunia."</p>

		<p>"Flossy is fine."</p>

		<p>"I thought you'd see it my way," Rebecca said smugly,
		proud to have won the argument. Josie smirked.</p>

		<p>"Just remember that you are responsible for 'Flossy'. You
		have to feed and brush her and take care of her gear."</p>

		<p>"Oh sure, Josie. I'll do a good job too, you just
		watch."</p>

		<p>"Uh huh," the gunslinger said in a knowing tone. There
		was no doubt in her mind that Rebecca would do everything in her power to please her or
		prove that she should stay with her. What Josie didn't want to admit to herself was that
		it was working. After taking care of Smith, there really wasn't a reason that Rebecca
		couldn't have stayed in Tombstone, except that Josie wouldn't be able to keep an eye on
		her then.</p>

		<p>They traveled northeast, hoping to reach Wilcox by nightfall. It
		was an insignificant small town and wouldn't have been worth stopping in at all except
		that it was the last place they could get supplies before reaching the Oxbow Route. Josie
		drove the wagon with Phoenix tethered behind while Rebecca sat next to her. The Winchester
		leaned on the seat between them, within easy reach should the gunslinger need it. The hot
		summer sun beat down on them unmercifully, making Josie regret her choice in clothing. The
		black long sleeved shirt and britches only served to absorb the heat, not to mention her
		Stetson, which quickly found its way into the back of the wagon. It wasn't long before the
		top three buttons on her shirt were open in a futile attempt to cool off.</p>

		<p>"Damn it's hot," she muttered as she wiped her brow
		again. The gray bandanna usually wrapped around her neck was now soaked with sweat and
		grime as she used it to keep the perspiration from running down her face. The dust from
		the road stuck to her skin, only serving to add to her discomfort. Her legs felt like they
		were on fire as the dark britches continued to soak in the heat. There was no sign of
		trees or shade anywhere. Rebecca wordlessly handed her the canteen of water. Josie tipped
		it up and took a large swallow before making a face and handing it back. "Ugh, that
		water's hot enough to make coffee," she grumbled.</p>

		<p>"Sorry," Rebecca said before pulling out two pieces of
		jerky and handing one to the gunslinger. Josie shook her head.</p>

		<p>"If I eat that, I'll have to drink more of that rancid
		water. No thanks."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca was never happier to see the sun setting before in her
		life. By mid-afternoon, Josie's mood was decidedly foul from being overheated and the
		young woman was afraid to say a word for fear of getting her head bitten off. They passed
		a small ranch and both let out a sigh of relief. Wilcox couldn't be much further ahead.
		"We'll rest in town for the night," Josie said, keeping her eyes straight ahead.
		"The horses need to rest and I need a bath."</p>

		<p>"Yes you do," she agreed, wrinkling her nose. Josie
		turned and looked at her.</p>

		<p>"Hey..." she said, feigning hurt. "You don't smell
		so good yourself."</p>

		<p>Rebecca thought the gunslinger was being serious until she saw a
		twinkle in the blue eyes and a small grin appeared. She smiled and let out a soft laugh.
		Josie turned her attention back to the dusty road. "We'll get cleaned up and let
		someone else cook dinner," she said. Now that the sun was setting and she was
		beginning to cool off, Josie felt bad about the way that she had snapped at the young
		woman she was beginning to consider a friend. Her brow furrowed. When was the last time
		she cared about anyone else's feelings? It only took a few seconds for her to decide that
		it had been far too long. "Maybe we can even pick up a new dress for you while we're
		there," she said, noting the smile that came across Rebecca's face.</p>

		<p>Since they were only staying the one night, Josie decided to
		splurge and get two rooms at the hotel instead of the flophouse. After bathing, they went
		downstairs to the combination saloon/restaurant and had a hearty meal of stew and
		cornbread. Josie had several mugs of beer while Rebecca sipped on her sarsaparilla. The
		heat from the day and their full bellies dictated an early evening and both retired
		immediately after dinner.</p>

		<p>Josie awoke in the middle of the night, her dreams too much to
		bear. Again and again she saw the face of the young girl looking up at her, her chest
		completely covered with blood. She got out of bed and splashed some water on her face from
		the basin. Knowing that sleep would now be impossible, she settled into a chair and waited
		for the sun to rise.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was sleeping soundly when Josie entered her room with two
		cups of coffee. "Time to get up, Rebecca," she said as she set the cups on the
		small table. Seeing no movement from the young woman, she kicked the bed with her booted
		foot, but not with much force.</p>

		<p>"Grmphf."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, let's go. I want to get our supplies and get on
		the road early." She waited another moment, then jerked the blanket off of the
		sleeping girl. She never expected what happened next.</p>

		<p>The young woman yelped and curled up into a ball, pressing
		herself against the wall. Her arms covered her head and her whole body shook in fear.
		Josie took a step back. "Rebecca?" she said softly. Slowly the young woman moved
		her arms and looked up at her.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled. "Guess you just
		surprised me." She crawled off the bed and headed for the chamber pot in the corner.
		Josie kept her back to her until she heard the scraping of the chair against the floor
		then turned around and took her seat. There was an awkward silence as each woman remained
		deep in her own thoughts. Josie watched Rebecca out of the corner of her eye. Rebecca's
		face and body betrayed every emotion as she fought to regain some kind of composure. She
		drained half of her coffee before speaking. When she did, her voice still carried a bit of
		shakiness to it. "Please don't wake me up like that again." Memories of her
		father coming in to wake her up, angry and sometimes violent flooded her mind. There were
		too many times that the blanket being pulled back wasn't enough to wake her after sitting
		up half the night reading books that he didn't know she had and she'd find herself being
		woken up by him pulling her out of bed roughly. She involuntarily shuddered at the memory.</p>

		<p>"I won't," Josie said. She wanted to ask what it was
		that had frightened her so, but comforting and personal conversations were foreign to her
		now and she wasn't sure she could handle all the emotions that went with caring that much
		about someone else. She finished her coffee and stood up. "I'll meet you
		outside."</p>

		<p>Rebecca changed into her dress, frowning at the way it looked. At
		dinner last night she was embarrassed to wear such a tattered thing in such a nice place,
		but unlike Josie, she couldn't walk around town in britches. No one dared question someone
		as tall and well armed as the gunslinger about her clothes, but a small thing like herself
		would only bring about trouble wandering around like that.</p>

		<p>Josie was leaning against a post when Rebecca finally exited the
		hotel. The gunslinger looked at the faded and slightly tattered dress and grimaced.
		"The first thing we're doing is moseying over to the dressmaker's and getting you a
		new dress."</p>

		<p>Rebecca thought about offering to make a dress herself, but
		something inside told her that the gunslinger wanted to buy this dress for her. She nodded
		and allowed herself to be led to the dressmaker.</p>

		<p>The dressmaker was a large woman, easily twice the weight of
		Josie and three times the girth. The top of her dress barely held her more than ample
		bosom as she walked over to talk to them. "I'm Rita, owner and seamstress. And just
		what'll ye be looking for today, missies?"</p>

		<p>"She needs a new dress," Josie said. "Something
		simple and easy to care for." She looked quickly at the wide expanse of skin showing
		from the front of the seamstress's dress. "And not revealing."</p>

		<p>Rita wondered if she should have been insulted, but answered.
		"Aye, a simple traveling dress, perhaps? Something in a calico?" she said as she
		moved over to a rack containing several simple dresses of varying colors and sizes. She
		removed a dress from the rack and held it up so both women could see it. It was a light
		green checkered pattern with long sleeves and a high lace neck that Rebecca was sure would
		choke her. She was just about to voice her opposition to it when Josie nodded.</p>

		<p>"That'll be fine." She turned to Rebecca and said.
		"You stay here and wait for the dress, and I'll go get the supplies." She strode
		to the door and grasped the knob, then turned back. "And Rebecca..."</p>

		<p>"Yes?"</p>

		<p>"Don't leave." There was something about the tone in
		Josie's voice that made the young blonde swear it was less of a statement and more of a
		question.</p>

		<p>"I won't."</p>

		<p>Josie nodded then left in search of the rest of their supplies.
		Rebecca resigned herself to her fate and let the large woman fit her for the dress. As she
		was being turned and pinned she swore to herself that the instant they were out of town
		she was changing back into to her britches. She smiled as she imagined what it would be
		like to see her tall companion wearing a dress.</p>

		<p>Josie returned almost two hours later with the wagon loaded down
		with a variety of supplies and staples. A small washboard was securely tied to the side of
		the wagon, while the back area contained as many supplies as Josie could afford. She
		wasn't the least bit happy with the cost. The largest sack contained oats for both horses.
		Unwilling to ask for assistance, Josie hefted the sack herself, pulling a muscle in her
		lower back in the process. She was glad when Rebecca bounded out of the shop, new dress in
		hand, and climbed up into the wagon without assistance. The gunslinger waited until the
		young woman placed her new garment carefully in the small trunk under the seat then
		clicked Flossy into motion. The forward jerk reverberated through her sore muscle, causing
		Josie to take a sharp breath.</p>

		<p>"Josie? Are you okay?" Rebecca looked at her carefully,
		searching for any sign of injury, wondering if the outlaw had been in another saloon
		fight.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine," she replied, her eyes never leaving the
		road ahead as they pulled out of town.</p>

		<p>"You sure?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca...." She said in an annoyed tone.</p>

		<p>"Sorry," the young woman said. Several minutes passed
		before she spoke again. "Josie, have I told you the story about Daniel Boone? No?
		Well..." she burst into her tale, knowing full well that the gunslinger was only
		half-listening, but preferring to hear her own voice over the howls of the coyotes in the
		distance. Several hours and tales later, Josie pulled the wagon off the trail and chose a
		spot to set up camp for the night.</p>

		<p>Pulling the horse to a stop, Josie waited for Rebecca to get down
		before slowly getting down herself. The sore muscle aggravated by hours of sitting on the
		wooden bench made itself known as soon as she tried to straighten out and stretch. Rebecca
		had just walked around to that side of the wagon and saw the unmasked look of pain on her
		face. "Josie, you're hurt!"</p>

		<p>"No," she said softly. "Just a sore back, that's
		all."</p>

		<p>"I could rub it for you. I mean, I still have some liniment
		and I got pretty good at rubbing my own muscles when they were sore."</p>

		<p>Josie looked at her for a moment before making her decision. She
		reached behind her back and tried to reach the protesting muscle herself. She nodded and
		watched the smile break out on Rebecca's face. "Great. I'll move this stuff out of
		the wagon and you can..."</p>

		<p>"No. That sack..." she said pointing to the oats,
		"...is what gave me this. We'll have to sleep on the ground tonight. You should be
		used to it by now."</p>

		<p>"Sure, no problem." She turned and started to remove
		the items they would need to camp on the ground. "No problem..." she whispered
		to herself. "I should be used to sleeping on the hard ground, uh huh, sure. Much more
		comfortable than, oh, say a padded wagon back, yup."</p>

		<p>"Quit bellyaching or I will make you empty out the wagon,
		including the sack of oats," Josie said, but her tone made it clear that she wasn't
		being serious. Both chuckled at the thought of her trying to lift the large, heavy sack.</p>

		<p>Josie lay down on the blanket and let Rebecca deal with setting
		up the small camp and getting the fire started. They ate a hearty stew, washed down by
		Josie with a mug of ale from the small keg on the wagon while her companion settled for
		tepid water from the larger keg. Only when all the dishes were wiped and put away and the
		shotgun was placed within easy reach of her hands did the gunslinger finally remove her
		shirt and settle on her stomach while Rebecca knelt down next to her and opened the bottle
		of liniment. "Where exactly?" the young woman asked as she placed her fingers
		down lightly near Josie's spine.</p>

		<p>"Lower...okay, over to the left...ow, right there...."</p>

		<p>"Like this?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah...just like that...." Josie closed her eyes and
		rested her cheek against her forearms as she relaxed under the gentle ministrations.</p>

		<p>"I'll tell you a story...." Rebecca spoke gently as her
		hands continued to gently massage the muscles in the bounty hunter's lower back.
		Everywhere her hands moved she felt the tightness and tension and she worked slowly to
		loosen and relax every muscle she found.</p>

		<p>"That reminds me of a story my mother used to tell me when I
		was a little girl," Josie murmured when the story was finished. She made no effort to
		stop Rebecca from massaging up her back. "You do that good, you know?"</p>

		<p>"Thank you," she replied. "Would you like me to
		tell another story?" Her fingers kneaded and rolled over Josie's back, washing away
		months of tension. Getting no answer, Rebecca began another story, and another, and
		another as time rolled by. Several times she felt the gunslinger jerk, but she could tell
		that it was from the pain, not her touch. Her arms began to ache by the time she finally
		sat back. "How was that?"</p>

		<p>Josie turned her head and looked at her young companion before
		sitting up and stretching. She rolled her head and twisted her back, allowing a small
		smile to come to her lips. "It feels better," she said before reaching over and
		grabbing her sleeping shirt. Rebecca tried not to let her disappointment at not getting a
		better compliment show.</p>

		<p>"Good. Well, I guess I'll go to bed. Goodnight." She
		rose and headed to the other side of the fire.</p>

		<p>"'Night," Josie replied as she watched the young woman
		settle into her blankets. She arched her back one more time, relishing the limberness.
		"Thank you, Rebecca," she said just loud enough for Rebecca to hear before
		turning over and facing away from her, but not before seeing the smile on the young
		woman's face. Josie made a mental note to compliment her more often.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="20: Bite">
		<p>Two days later they felt no closer to their destination. The
		dusty ruts in the ground led endlessly into the distance, slicing the landscape in two.
		Only the occasional brush or collection of rocks gave them any indication of progress. The
		excessive heat had not dissipated, forcing both the women and the horses to use more water
		than they had planned. Josie took pains to take only minimal amounts for herself, knowing
		that they were still a distance away from the nearest watering hole. Rebecca was aware of
		the bounty hunter's reluctance to take any water for herself and decided to limit her own
		use, an action that was not lost on Josie.</p>

		<p>The reds and oranges of sunset filled the horizon. Josie led the
		wagon off the trail and to a small outcropping of brush and rocks. They fed and cared for
		the horses, the younger woman mimicking every move the bounty hunter made. Once Flossy and
		Phoenix were settled, they set about getting their camp set up. Although several pounds of
		oats had been used, the idea of hefting the sack out of the wagon every night and back in
		the morning was unappealing to Josie. So as they had been doing, they set their bedrolls
		on opposite sides of the fire. The gunslinger set about getting the fire going while
		Rebecca gathered the items from the wagon that they would need for the night. As the deep
		red ball of fire disappeared over the horizon and the dark gray of twilight settled in,
		all the gear was set up for the evening. A small pot of coffee was warming in the fire;
		the only luxury Josie allowed herself. "I'm going to go look around," Rebecca
		said as she stood up. "I won't go far."</p>

		<p>Josie nodded and went back to cleaning her gun. As the young
		blonde left her sight, she said softly, "Be careful," before returning to her
		task.</p>

		<p>Rebecca wove her way through the pillars of stone, mentally
		making note of the twists and turns so she could find her way back. The moon was not yet
		high enough in the sky to cast any illumination to the area. As her thigh grazed the thin
		branches of a small brush, she heard the unmistakable rattle. Fear gripped her now racing
		heart and all thoughts of direction left her mind. She took a small step backward and
		heard it again, this time even closer than before. In the very dim light her eyes were
		unable to pinpoint the location of the deadly snakes. Whether it was her eyes playing
		tricks on her or a real snake moving closer, she never knew. Rebecca let out a loud shriek
		and turned to run away. Frightened and disoriented, she tripped over the same brush that
		she had scraped against before and landed too close for the rattler's comfort. It struck
		with blinding speed, sinking it's curved fangs deep into the back of her left calf before
		slithering back and coiling up in a defensive posture.</p>

		<p>Before the scream had died, Josie was racing toward her, shotgun
		in hand. "Rebecca!" she called as she made her way through the darkness, bumping
		into the stone pillars of granite in her haste.</p>

		<p>"Josie? Josie!" Rebecca cried, her eyes wide as she
		tried to see any more snakes. Paralyzed by fear, she was unable to move.
		"Josie!" she cried again, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca!" She stopped just short of stepping on the
		young blonde as her keen eyes made out her form on the ground.</p>

		<p>"S-ssnakes." Tears rolled freely down Rebecca's face as
		she felt the burning pain in her leg. Her protector's presence gave her the strength she
		needed to move. She turned and wrapped her arms tight around the gunslinger's leg. Josie
		picked out three snakes coiled up in the darkness. All seemed to be a safe enough distance
		away. She set the Winchester down on the ground and turned her attention to the terrified
		Rebecca.</p>

		<p>With a firm grip, she extricated the frightened woman from her
		leg. "Were you bit?"</p>

		<p>"Y-yesss," she bawled as she reached for her lower leg.
		Josie released her grip long enough to remove her bandanna and tear it in half. She
		quickly tied one piece just below Rebecca's knee and the other right above the ankle. The
		gunslinger scooped her up and raced back to camp.</p>

		<p>Josie knew that time was of the essence as she set her wounded
		charge down on the blanket and pulled a knife out of her boot. She rolled Rebecca onto her
		stomach and cut the pant leg open, exposing two angry looking puncture marks against the
		creamy white skin. "This will hurt," she said, unsure if the young woman heard
		her over her sobbing. Already the affected area was puffing up. After a quick check to
		make sure the restricting bands of cloth weren't so tight that they cut off circulation,
		she placed the blade against Rebecca's skin and made quick incisions across both wounds.
		The young woman's cries and screams were enough to wake the dead as she tried to pull her
		leg away. Josie's powerful arms held her down forcefully. "Rebecca, we don't have
		time for you to be fighting with me. You need to calm down." She contemplated cold
		cocking the young woman, but the hysterical sobs gave way to sniffles. "Concentrate
		on your breathing. Take deep, slow breaths." Her long fingers worked to squeeze out
		as much blood and venom as possible. Rebecca buried her face in her hands and let out a
		series of ragged sobs. Josie stretched her body out along the ground, bringing her mouth
		closer to the bloodied leg. "I have to suck the poison out."</p>

		<p>"No!" the young woman wailed, but she was powerless to
		stop her. A burning sensation was moving up her leg to her thigh and more panic set in.
		She felt the pressure of Josie's mouth against her calf, then a strong sucking feeling.
		The gunslinger drew as much of the fluid into her mouth as she could, lifted and turned
		her head, then spit it out before repeating the process. The vile taste made her stomach
		turn but she refused to let it impede her progress. Already the fluid was changing from a
		watery substance mixed with blood to mostly blood, but she knew that the first fifteen
		minutes were all there was to remove the venom. After that, they would just have to wait
		for the remainder to run its course. Josie sucked as hard as she could, her ears tuning
		out the wails and cries of her companion. When all she could taste was the blood, the
		gunslinger stopped sucking and reached for the saddlebag. Rebecca was still crying but had
		stopped the hysterical sobs. Josie removed a small roll of cloth from the saddlebag and
		wrapped the wound securely.</p>

		<p>"Roll over," she said as she rose and headed for the
		wagon. She pulled out Phoenix's saddle and returned to Rebecca's side. "I'm going to
		put this under your leg. It's important to keep it elevated." The dim firelight
		allowed the bounty hunter to see her nod in understanding. Josie placed the saddle under
		her leg then covered her with the blanket, tucking it in around the young woman to keep
		her warm and to hopefully stave off shock.</p>

		<p>The bounty hunter kept vigil all night over her, changing the
		bandage frequently. She grimly noted that the soaked bandage still showed traces of
		yellow, indicating that she hadn't gotten all of the venom out. The fangs had penetrated
		deeper than she had thought. There was nothing Josie could do now but wait and let the
		snake bite run its course. She knew that no matter how deep the wound, it was not life
		threatening. It would be painful, however, and most likely would swell up for a time
		before it got better. Rebecca stirred several times, but slept through the night.</p>

		<p>She woke up to the smells of coffee brewing and meat sizzling on
		the fire. Josie was sitting next to her, mug in hand. "Morning, sprite. How's the leg
		feel?" the gunslinger said as she took a sip of coffee, trying hard not to grimace.</p>

		<p>"It burns and my skin feels...tight."</p>

		<p>"It's swelling. You'll have to keep it up until the swelling
		goes down." She poured Rebecca a cup of the strong liquid and handed it to her. The
		young woman propped herself up on one elbow and gratefully accepted the coffee. She took a
		sip, crinkled her face, and looked at Josie.</p>

		<p>"How much coffee did you use? This stuff is really
		strong."</p>

		<p>"It is, isn't it?" the gunslinger responded as she
		looked down at the blackness in her mug. "Well, since you do it so well, you can be
		in charge of making the coffee from now on." She set her mug down on the ground and
		stood up. "I'll be back in a minute. Stay here."</p>

		<p>Rebecca forced herself to drink the vile coffee while she waited
		for the bounty hunter to return. Three shots rang out, breaking the silence of the
		morning. Josie returned moments later with her shotgun and three lifeless snakes in her
		hand. The sight of the rattlers, even dead, was enough to start the young woman's heart
		racing. Josie saw the panicked expression and tossed the snakes on the far side of the
		fire. "Dinner," she said simply. Rebecca nodded, her eyes never leaving the pile
		of serpents. With a sense of pride, the bounty hunter pulled out her knife and began to
		skin and clean the snakes. She didn't know which one had bitten her friend, but it didn't
		matter now. All three would make a fine stew. "We won't be moving on until your leg
		looks a little better."</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded, grateful for the chance to rest. The rock
		formations helped to provide some shade from the burning sun and she settled back to rest
		for a while longer, daydreaming of a valiant knight slaying dragons to protect a princess.
		Josie piled the chunks of meat into the cooking pot and leaned against the wagon, using a
		wheel to support her back while she started to clean her guns, a chore all but forgotten
		in last night's excitement.</p>

		<p>By nightfall, the swelling had diminished enough for Rebecca to
		move about and make supper. Although the gunslinger seemed to enjoy the stew, the young
		woman found herself unable to eat it; the memory of being bitten was just too strong. She
		contented herself with some warmed over jerky washed down with ale. Despite her dislike
		for the taste, she worried about the effect the extra day would have on their still
		dwindling water supply.</p>

		<p>After dinner, Josie changed the bandage on Rebecca's leg and saw
		that the wound was no longer oozing anything but blood. The long night of watching over
		the young woman caught up with her and the bounty hunter settled into bed early, leaving
		Rebecca alone with her thoughts. She noted that not one unkind word had been said about
		her getting bitten, even though she knew that if she had just remained calm, it never
		would have happened. She vowed to make the effort to get over her fear of snakes.</p>

	<chapter title="21: Night Demons">
		<p>Rebecca woke in the middle of the night to answer nature's call.
		When she finished her business and returned to the camp, she noticed Josie thrashing about
		in the midst of an obvious nightmare.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p><em>Genie moved up next to her, gun drawn. "Do you think
		they'll come?" she asked quietly. Josie didn't offer a glance in her direction,
		preferring to keep her eyes on the door.</em></p>

		<p><em>"If they do, we'll be ready for them," she replied.
		Her hands gripped her peacemakers nervously. Ten horses had been stolen from the ranch in
		the past two weeks and they were certain that the Double Bar was responsible. Genie's
		father refused to stand up to the bullies, knowing full well that the McCann's controlled
		not only the local sheriff, but the district judge as well. Genie and Josie figured that
		the only way to stop the horse thievery was to stand watch over the herd.</em></p>

		<p><em>The telltale creak of the barn door being opened drew their
		attention. Three men entered quietly, taking careful looks at the main house to see if
		they had been detected. They didn't notice the two teenagers hiding in the loft, guns
		drawn and aimed at them. Genie's youthful voice filled the air. "Don't move!"</em>
		</p>

		<p><em>John McCann, the youngest son of the Double Bar's owner,
		panicked immediately and started firing his gun in the direction of the loft. Reacting
		quickly, Josie began firing both guns in return. Within seconds it was over. Smoke from
		the guns hung in the air as both sides inspected the damage. John lay on the ground,
		bleeding profusely from a mortal wound. She felt the warm stickiness against her arm and
		turned to see Genie's lifeless eyes looking back at her.</em></p>

		<p><em>"Well if that don't beat all," the stocky man said
		as he raised his gun in her direction. "Looks like we done caught ourselves a little
		gal horse thief. Ah bet old man Sanders will be real pleased to see we done protected his
		horses from a stinkin' half-breed." He moved closer, knowing full well that her guns
		were empty. He looked up at the still body next to her. "Done gone and kilt his
		daughter too. Tsk tsk. Shame she couldn't tell 'em what really happened." He glanced
		over at the other man, who was busy removing anything of value from McCann's body.
		"Ain't that right, Bill?"</em></p>

		<p><em>Josie recognized Bill as one of the Sander's ranch hands.
		"Ayup, that'd be right, Tom. I saw it all with my own eyes, I did. That damn injun
		done come in here and tried to take off with the horses. Poor Genie come in to stop her
		and got a wooden overcoat for her trouble. Done killed Johnny too, damn horse thief."</em>
		</p>

		<p><em>Tom raised his gun again. "You gonna hang,
		half-breed."</em></p>

		<p><em>With speed born out of desperation, Josie jerked the gun from
		Genie's still hand and fired, catching Tom in the chest. Her second shot struck Bill in
		the cheek, sending him backward against a wooden post and knocking him out cold. The
		sounds of approaching ranchers and the elder Sander filled the air. She knew Genie's
		father hated her for her parentage and had forbade his daughter to see her. It came down
		to her word against Bill's, and she knew who would be believed. She got up and ran to the
		far side of the loft, kicked open the doors, and jumped to the ground below. She heard the
		shouts of the men as she was spotted. There was no choice for her now. Josie ran for the
		woods, never looking back. The men fired blindly, missing with every shot. "It's that
		half-breed friend of Genie's," she heard one of them say. She heard the crack of the
		rifle just as a burning pain seared through her upper arm.</em></p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Josie? Josie, wake up," Rebecca said as she shook her
		gently. The blue eyes popped open as the gunslinger bolted to a sitting position
		momentarily disoriented. Her hand reached instinctively to her left biceps, fully
		expecting it to be bleeding. Rebecca put her hand on Josie's right shoulder. "Hey,
		are you all right?"</p>

		<p>The bounty hunter took in her surroundings and let out a loud
		sigh. She pulled herself into a cross-legged position and rested her arms on her knees.
		Rebecca moved and fetched the canteen. It was only then that Josie realized that the young
		woman had been touching her. When she returned, Rebecca made no move to resume her
		position, merely handing the gunslinger the canteen and leaning back on her heels.
		"Another nightmare?", she asked softly. Josie took a deep swallow of water and
		nodded slightly, her gaze settling on the red embers of the fire. "Do you want to
		talk about it?" Rebecca ventured. "Sometimes it helps. I mean I know it does for
		me."</p>

		<p>There was a long silence while the gunslinger internally debated
		the question. "Make coffee.", she twisted sideways and grabbed a branch to stir
		the fire with. She knew that sleep would elude her for the rest of the night. Rebecca set
		the pot in the fire to heat up, then settled down an arm's length away from Josie.</p>

		<p>"When I was seventeen, I had a best friend...Genie."
		She said it so softly that Rebecca had to lean forward to hear. "When I first went
		back to live with my mother, she was the only person who didn't see me as being different
		just because my father was Cherokee. We became the best of friends; we were inseparable.
		Genie's father owned a small horse ranch and he found out that a neighboring ranch was
		stealing the horses, but he was too scared of them to do anything about it." She
		leaned forward and stirred the fire some more as she collected her thoughts. "Genie
		and I, we were young, we thought if we just caught them in the act that justice would be
		done." She snorted lightly. "Instead, Genie was killed, and I became
		wanted."</p>

		<p>"What happened?" Rebecca prodded gently as she poured
		coffee for Josie and herself. The gunslinger took the mug and stared at the wisps of steam
		that rose from the black abyss. "One of the men worked for Genie's father. He was
		helping them steal the horses. It would have been his word against mine." Her voice
		rang with bitterness. "I had no choice but to run."</p>

		<p>Rebecca started to ask a question, but the gunslinger's look made
		her think twice. They sat there quietly, staring at the fire as time passed. Rebecca's
		head bobbed as she tried to fight off sleep. "Go to bed, Rebecca." Josie's voice
		startled the young woman after so lengthy a silence. "Go on, get some sleep."
		</p>

		<p>Josie sat there long after Rebecca was asleep, remembering her
		brief friendship with Genie and the end of her innocence.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="22: Bad Day">
		<p>The morning sun shone down brightly on the small camp. Josie had
		already packed their belongings back into the wagon and had breakfast done at which time
		she felt she had waited long enough for Rebecca to wake up on her own. The gunslinger felt
		a bit guilty for having woken her up with the nightmare last night. She had hoped that the
		smell of coffee and sizzling meat would have done it, but the young woman continued to
		snore softly, her head buried under her blanket in an unconscious attempt to keep the sun
		out. Josie reached over with the butt of her shotgun and gently poked at the sleeping
		form. "Rebecca... Rebecca, get up."</p>

		<p>A low groan came from under the blanket. Josie poked again, this
		time getting the result she wanted. Rebecca slowly pulled the blanket off her face and
		squinted at the brightness. She groggily took the tin cup from the bounty hunter and took
		a sip, immediately grimacing. She looked over at Josie quickly, afraid that she would be
		angered, but the gunslinger arched an eyebrow and her face took on a crooked grin.
		"Coffin varnish?"</p>

		<p>"Ugh, coffin varnish is right," Rebecca replied as she
		drank some more down. "Try using a little less coffee," she said with a friendly
		smile. "This stuff will put hair on your chest." She swallowed the last of the
		drink in her mug and rose to her feet. "I have to make a trip; I'll be right
		back."</p>

		<p>"Try not to run into another nest of snakes," Josie
		warned half-jokingly. Rebecca smiled, but heeded the warning and looked around carefully
		before choosing her spot. The last thing she wanted to do was to squat near a rattler.
		</p>

		<p>Rebecca returned to the camp and rummaged around in the saddlebag
		until she found the rags she was looking for. Although Josie said nothing, the young woman
		blushed furiously as she headed back to the privacy of the bush. She didn't see the
		gunslinger's small smile of understanding. Of all the things she hated, the monthly menace
		was the worst. Rebecca knew it would only be a matter of hours before she started getting
		the painful cramps that accompanied it. Already she felt the start of a dull ache behind
		her eyes that signaled the beginning of a throbbing headache.</p>

		<p>They were on the road less than three hours when the cramps
		started. As nonchalantly as possible, Rebecca folded her arms against her abdomen and
		pressed down, trying to ease the discomfort. Josie noticed out of the corner of her eye,
		but said nothing. The constant jostling from the ride did nothing to help and several
		times she clenched her eyes tight against the pain. "Want some laudanum?" Josie
		asked without taking her eyes off the road. Rebecca opened her eyes and looked at the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"I don't know," she replied. In a smaller voice she
		added, "I've never taken anything for it before."</p>

		<p>"Why?", Josie asked evenly as the muscles in her jaw
		tightened. "Didn't your family know you were in pain?", the touch of anger and
		indignation in her voice was almost imperceptible, but Rebecca noticed it and instead of
		flinching, felt a sense of comfort that she didn't understand.</p>

		<p>"I started getting these really painful cramps and the
		headaches when I was fourteen. I told my mother, but...." she turned away, unable to
		look at her raven headed companion. Josie jerked the reins and pulled the wagon to a stop.
		She reached over and cupped the younger woman's chin, turning her face to meet her gaze.
		Ice blue eyes pierced into green.</p>

		<p>"But what, Rebecca?" her tone softened slightly, but
		inside the gunslinger's anger was churning into a steady boil. "But what?"
		</p>

		<p>"Medicine costs money...money we didn't have." Her
		voice was barely above a whisper, but Josie heard the lie all the same.</p>

		<p>"Didn't have, Rebecca? Or were you afraid to tell your
		father?" The visible flinching gave the bounty hunter her answer. She released her
		hold on the young woman and reached over the seat for the saddlebag that contained their
		bottle of laudanum. "Take some," Josie said as she handed Rebecca the nearly
		full container.</p>

		<p>"Thank you." She put the bottle to her lips and took a
		small swallow. Another cramp hit, forcing her to bend slightly while pressing against her
		midriff with her free arm. She took a bigger swallow. Satisfied that Rebecca had drank
		enough to ease the pain, Josie put the stopper in the bottle and put it back in the
		saddlebags. Without another word, she clucked her tongue and sent Flossy into motion.
		</p>

		<p>They passed the time in an amiable silence until breaking for
		lunch and a rest for the horses, then continued on for several hours. The deep ruts in the
		road made the ride even more bumpy than usual and Josie began to notice a slight change in
		the feel of the ride. She was about to pull Flossy to a stop when the right front wheel
		passed over a small rock. The force of the landing was enough to snap the rusty pin that
		held the spoke wheel to the axle. With lightening reflexes, Josie reached out and grabbed
		Rebecca before she could topple off of the bench. The added weight of the young woman
		caused the gunslinger to slide on the bench, imbedding several splinters into her rear on
		her way down.</p>

		<p>"Damn," Josie swore as she climbed out of the wagon and
		unbuttoned her britches. Her gun belts dropped loosely to the ground. Rebecca stood up and
		inspected the damage to the buckboard. The wheel was lying on its side on the ground,
		firmly wedged under the corner of the wagon. Their belongings were scattered about and
		both the barrel of coal oil and the box of soap had opened, mixing and spilling their
		contents all over the bedding materials and clothes. Josie's britches were down around her
		ankles along with her drawers while she tried unsuccessfully to remove the offending
		pieces of wood. She turned to look at the wagon and scowled. "Of all the..."
		Josie shuffled closer to the wagon.</p>

		<p>"Josie, why are you like that?"</p>

		<p>"Because I have a baker's dozen worth of splinters up my
		ass, Rebecca!" she growled. She tried again in vain to remove one of them. She bent
		down and moved her britches out of the way to reach the cuff of her boot. Josie pulled out
		the bowie knife and handed it to her companion before standing up and turning around.
		Rebecca suppressed the urge to giggle at the gunslinger's fate.</p>

		<p>A continuous stream of ouches and curses filled the air as she
		diligently removed every splinter. The none-too-happy Josie <img src="splinters.jpg" alt="Splinters by Angelique" border="0" align="left" width="306" height="304"/>refastened her clothing and guns
		while Rebecca started to remove the gear from the wagon, separating the clothes and
		bedding from the other stuff. The gunslinger knelt down next to the axle. "The damn
		pin broke." The smell of coal oil and soap mixed together penetrated her senses,
		furthering her aggravation. Without thinking, Josie rose and kicked the axle with all her
		anger.</p>

		<p>Rebecca spun around at the groan of pain in time to see the
		intimidating bounty hunter grab her foot and hop around in a circle before falling to the
		ground, cursing the entire time. "Josie? What happened?" she asked as she rushed
		to her side.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I kicked the stupid damned axle," Josie said
		through gritted teeth as she held her booted foot with both hands. She let loose a deep
		breath and closed her eyes. "I think I broke my foot."</p>

		<p>Despite Rebecca's best efforts to make the boot removal as gentle
		as possible, Josie's foot was still bumped and jarred, causing her to clench her jaw and
		take deep breaths to avoid yelping at the pain. Her suspicions were confirmed when her
		toes finally came free of the leather. The big toe was already a deep purple, the bruising
		extending all the way to the foot. Rebecca tsk tsked at the broken toe and looked around.
		"I guess we're making camp early tonight."</p>

		<p>"Guess so," Josie said dejectedly.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="23: Wagons">
		<p>"Are you sure you'll be okay?" Rebecca asked. Josie
		looked down at her from atop Phoenix. Her toe throbbed within the black leather boot.
		Sleeping the night without blankets to protect from the desert chill didn't help.</p>

		<p>"I'll be fine, Rebecca. The river should only be a few hours
		away, and a town not much further than that." She handed over one of her colts.
		"Just in case. Don't hurt yourself with it."</p>

		<p>Rebecca took the steel weapon. Her fingertips rolled over the
		pearl handle. "How long do you think you'll be gone?" she asked quietly, trying
		not to let her fear show.</p>

		<p>"No more than two days. I'll get the pins for the wagon and
		then I'll be back." She adjusted the fit of her Winchester in its sheath before
		realizing that she was stalling. "Be careful," Josie said gruffly before kicking
		Phoenix into a gallop, taking her away from her young friend. Rebecca watched her ride
		away in a billowing cloud of dust.</p>

		<p>"You too, Josie," she said softly. She thought about
		what the bounty hunter had said about the river being only a few hours away. Surely Josie
		wouldn't mind if she went and washed their clothes and blankets? Smiling to herself at the
		idea, Rebecca looked for something with which to hold the remainder of the soap.</p>

		<p>As expected, the edge of the river appeared within three hours.
		Josie gratefully dumped out the remainder of the stale water from her canteen and filled
		it with the cool water from the Rio Grande. After a refreshing soak of her head, the
		gunslinger ate some jerky and then mounted up and continued on her way. She wanted to get
		the pin and get back as soon as possible. The constant bumping against the saddle
		continued to remind Josie of her trip sideways on the wagon bench.</p>

		<p>It was a sweat-soaked Rebecca that reached the same spot on the
		river that Josie had visited hours earlier. With no saddle, the young woman was forced to
		lay all the clothes across the back of the horse and carry the sack that contained the
		soap and the washboard in one hand and the reins in the other. Flossy went right to the
		edge of the water and nickered contentedly as she drew the cool liquid into her mouth.
		Rebecca removed her boots and stepped into the water, letting the cool mud slip between
		her toes as the water soothed her aching and hot feet. She let out a sigh of relief and
		flopped down into the water, giggling slightly. Only after a refreshing swim did she begin
		her chore. It was late afternoon before Rebecca returned to where the wagon and the rest
		of their goods were. The length of time required for accomplishing the task had just as
		much to do with her constant swim breaks as with the stubbornness of the coal oil within
		the clothes. Once back at camp she draped the clothing and blankets over the sides of the
		wagon and nearby bushes figuring it would be dry by nightfall.</p>

		<p>As night settled on the land, two women laid awake staring at the
		stars above. Rebecca snuggled under her now clean blanket using the gunslinger's blanket
		as a pillow. Josie rested her head against her saddle with Phoenix's saddle blanket
		covering her. The last waking thoughts that both women had were of each other, both
		silently hoping the other was safe and well.</p>

		<p>The sun was high the next day when Josie found a small ranch. The
		clinking and clanging of metal against metal filled her ears as she headed to a large
		barn. All the doors were open in a feeble attempt to disperse the heat from the roaring
		fire. A large, burly man swung a hammer again and again, striking a horseshoe braced
		against the anvil. His face was covered with sweat and soot, matching his black leather
		apron. "You a cartwright?" she asked as she stepped into the doorway.</p>

		<p>He never looked up from his work, apparently unaffected by a
		strange woman showing up at his ranch. "Cartwright, smith, whatever needs being done,
		I guess," he said in a deep voice that matched his build. Josie guessed that he could
		easily lift a small horse.</p>

		<p>"I need cotter pins," she said as she stepped closer,
		stopping a couple of feet from him. She did her best not to limp and was grateful that he
		didn't look up. He stopped pounding the shoe and looked up at her. "Over there,"
		he said, pointing to a small box sitting on a nearby bench. "Find the ones ya need;
		the damn wagons are all different."</p>

		<p>It took several minutes for Josie to find four cotter pins that
		would fit the axles on the wagon. She'd be damned if she was going to buy one, go back,
		and discover that another one was rusted. A quick mental check of her funds allowed her to
		grab a few more, just in case. "Six bits," he said when she showed him the pins.
		Josie put the coins on the bench and headed for the door, again trying not to allow the
		pain in her toe to affect her gait. She stopped and turned around, her eyes catching a
		large expanse of sheepskin hanging on the wall. Her thoughts immediately went from the
		pain in her foot to a pain somewhere else.</p>

		<p>Rebecca drank the last of her coffee and stared up at the night
		sky. She was proud of how clean she had gotten the clothes and blankets. She used several
		rags to try and clean up the soapy, flammable mixture from the rest of the items and was
		pleased with the amount of progress she had made. Almost all the rest of the belongings
		were clean and only the sacks of sugar, salt, and flour had to be discarded. Thankfully,
		the jerky and the rest of their staples had been spared from damage. The fire burned low,
		the night warm enough not to require much more. She settled in under her blanket and
		stared at the stars. Like the night before, she worried about her friend and prayed for
		her safety and quick return. As also done the night before, Josie was several miles off,
		tucked under the sheepskin and wishing for the same thing.</p>

		<p>It was mid-afternoon when Josie returned to the damaged wagon and
		her friend. Rebecca let out a yelp of joy and ran over to her, stopping just short and
		regaining her composure. "How are you?" she said simply, her hand covering her
		eye to block out the sun as she looked up at the tall gunslinger sitting atop the equally
		tall steed.</p>

		<p>"Fine," Josie answered as she dismounted, making sure
		her right foot hit the ground first to minimize the jolt to her injured left one. She
		smiled slightly, happy to see that Rebecca was fine. Her eyes settled on the neat pile of
		folded clothes and neatly packed piles of supplies. "Rebecca... you cleaned up
		everything?"</p>

		<p>"Well, most everything. I couldn't clean the sugar, salt, or
		flour, but most all the rest I was able to save."</p>

		<p>"Where did you get the water?" Josie asked. Her eyes
		narrowed when the answer came to her. "Rebecca, did you go all the way to the
		river?"</p>

		<p>She took a step back before answering the gunslinger.
		"Well...yeah. I took Flossy with me," she decided not to mention that she had
		left the gun with the wagon. Josie walked slowly over to the pile of clothes and blankets.
		Her hand glided over the material as a smile came to her lips. She held her spare shirt to
		her nose and inhaled with only the scent of lye touching her nose. "You did a good
		job, Rebecca," she said. The smile that came to the young woman's face reminded Josie
		of a child getting exactly what they wanted for their birthday. She walked over and tended
		to Phoenix, tossing the sheepskin on the bench of the wagon as she passed.</p>

		<p>"What's that for? Oh," she chuckled. "What's the
		matter, Josie? Don't like the way the bench bites?" She was rewarded with an arched
		eyebrow before Josie rolled her eyes and shook her head. The pair shared a pleasant
		evening and slept peacefully knowing the other was just on the other side of the fire.
		</p>

		<p>Josie uttered yet another curse as the board slid off of the
		stone when she tried to use it as a lever to lift the wagon. "We need
		something...wider," she said, looking around for something to fit the need.</p>

		<p>"Josie, this is the widest stone we could find out here in
		the middle of nowhere," Rebecca muttered as she wiped the sweat off her brow.
		"Are you sure there's no other way to do this?"</p>

		<p>"What do you want me to do, Rebecca? Climb under the wagon
		and lift it with my back?" she growled. Three hours of no progress had brought her
		foul mood out. Every time she got enough weight down to move the wagon upward the board
		would shift off of the curved stone. None of their supplies could take the strain of
		holding the weight. She looked down at the wheel stuck under the wagon again and cursed.
		"You know all these ranches with the wagon wheels out front? Well, they didn't settle
		because they liked the area. That's where their damned wagon broke down!" Josie
		growled and smacked her hand against the side of the wagon as she walked around looking
		once again at their belongings.</p>

		<p>"Want a broken hand to go with the toe?" Rebecca
		mumbled as she repositioned the stone and board. Josie appeared next to her and knelt
		down, holding the cracked barrel that once held the coal oil.</p>

		<p>"I heard that, Rebecca," she said as she placed the
		barrel under the board. "Let's try this again."</p>

		<p>With much grunting and straining, Josie managed to force the
		corner of the wagon up enough for Rebecca to pull the wheel out from under it. It wasn't
		high enough for her to fit it to the axle, however. Without thinking, the young woman
		ducked her shoulder under the corner and pushed up with her legs, helping lift it the
		final inch or so that was needed to place the wheel on. Josie pressed down on the board
		with all her might to try and ease the weight on Rebecca's shoulder as she moved the wheel
		into place. She slipped out from under the wagon and pushed the pin in as far as she could
		by hand. "Okay!"</p>

		<p>Josie eased the wagon back down, cautiously watching the wheel
		for signs of it coming back off. Once lowered, she moved over and used the butt of her
		revolver to pound the pin in the rest of the way before twisting it into place.
		"Whew," she wiped the sweat off of her face with the remains of her torn
		bandanna. She had hoped that fixing the wagon would be a quick process and they could be
		on their way early, but now decided that a leisurely break was in order before loading up
		the wagon. It was nightfall before they reached the river and decided to call it a night.

	<chapter title="24: An Old Friend">
		<p>The next month on the road was rather uneventful, no more
		accidents and Josie managed to apprehend two more men on her list.</p>

		<p>"How much longer before we reach Deadwood?" Rebecca
		asked as she kicked up dust with her boots.</p>

		<p>"At least four more hours. Think of the nice hot bath you
		can have once we get there." She wiped the sweat from her brow with her already
		soaked bandanna.</p>

		<p>"Are you sure it's safe there? What if someone recognizes
		you?" She let the concern show plainly in her green eyes. Josie's lip twitched into a
		small grin.</p>

		<p>"Trust me, Rebecca. The codgers that live in Deadwood aren't
		worried about me." Her blue eyes stared off into the distance as her mind relived
		memories of her last trip to the mining town. She was so lost in thought that she didn't
		hear Rebecca's next question. "Huh?"</p>

		<p>"I said..." her voice conveyed her annoyance at her
		words being ignored...again. "If they're not worried about you, then who are they
		worried about?"</p>

		<p>"You'll see," Josie answered with a knowing smirk.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The outlaw's eyes scanned from one side of the street to the
		other, noting every building and possible ambush point. "That isn't right."
		</p>

		<p>"What?" Rebecca asked. Josie's gaze settled on one
		building.</p>

		<p>"The assayer's office is closed," she said as she
		climbed down from the buckboard.</p>

		<p>"So? Maybe he drank too much laudanum."</p>

		<p>"No. This is a mining town, Rebecca. Even if the regular
		assayer were sick, there would be someone else to take his place. Look around...do you see
		anyone? It's the middle of the day...where is everyone?" Josie's hand lowered to her
		side, her thumb resting on the hammer of her Colt. She put her hand on Rebecca's shoulder.
		"Listen to me. I want you to be quiet and stay right behind me. If I start shooting,
		I want you to get on Phoenix and get out of here as fast as you can." She shook
		Rebecca's shoulder for emphasis. "Do you understand me?" She waited until the
		smaller woman nodded. "Good. Let's go."</p>

		<p>They entered the dim saloon and headed for the bar. "Whiskey
		and a sarsaparilla", Josie said as her eyes moved about the room.</p>

		<p>"Four bits," the gruff looking man behind the bar said
		as he sized up the well-armed woman. The outlaw gave him a dirty look as she fished out
		two quarters.</p>

		<p>"Where is everyone?"</p>

		<p>"Dead, mostly. Those that ain't will prob'ly be there
		soon."</p>

		<p>"What happened?" Rebecca asked, drawing a look from
		Josie. The barkeep set the drinks down, placing the whiskey in front of the more dangerous
		looking of the two.</p>

		<p>"Mostly 'cause a them damn injuns. Savages always attacking
		us." He took an involuntary step back when he saw the tall woman's eyes narrow at
		him. Rebecca gave him a similar look, though not as effective, before placing her small
		hand on the outlaw's forearm. The touch was enough to break through and keep Josie's anger
		in check.</p>

		<p>"Just tell me where I can find Jane," Josie said
		through gritted teeth. Every part of her body wanted to reach over the bar and grab him by
		the throat. She dimly realized that it was only because Rebecca was standing next to her
		that she didn't act on her impulses.</p>

		<p>"Sure, sure," he said as he put his hands up in a
		placating gesture. "She's at the boarding house. Only place big enough to hold all of
		'em."</p>

		<p>Josie allowed herself one more withering gaze at him before
		turning. "Let's go." She didn't look to see if the young woman followed her.
		Once outside, she jumped onto the seat of the buckboard and slapped the reins against the
		horse's rump even before Rebecca was seated, nearly pitching her from the wagon.</p>

		<p>"Josie, are you all right?" She didn't miss the
		whiteness of the outlaw's knuckles as she held the reins in a death grip.</p>

		<p>"The boarding house must be that big one at the end of the
		street," Josie said, refusing to meet Rebecca's gaze. She wasn't ready to let go of
		her anger.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." Rebecca said as she covered Josie's hand
		with her own. "He's just ignorant. Come on, let's go find your friend." The
		outlaw nodded slightly as she released a deep breath.</p>

		<p>They entered the boarding house and were both shocked at what
		they saw. The parlor held no furniture, the floor covered with sick and injured people.
		Several men still had arrows sticking out of their bodies. Josie reached behind her back
		and retrieved the small knife from its secret place in her belt. The blue eyes quickly
		assessed the situation. She looked around for someone healthy enough to help her move some
		of the patients. Josie spotted a young man, close to Rebecca's age, kneeling next to one
		of the sick women. "You, come here and help." He looked up at her but made no
		effort to move. She glared at him and spoke in a tone that brooked no argument. "We
		need to separate the sick from the injured and start treating them. You don't look like
		you're sick or injured..." she lowered her tone to a growl, "...so get to
		it."</p>

		<p>"B-but my mother...what would she think if I left her alone
		at a time like this?"</p>

		<p>"What do you think your mother would say if you sat there
		and made no effort to help others?" Rebecca asked in a tone that filled him with
		guilt. He bent down and gave his mother a kiss on her sweaty forehead.</p>

		<p>"I'll be back soon, mother."</p>

		<p>He rose and moved over toward them. "My name is Michael.
		What can I do to help?"</p>

		<p>Josie moved over and knelt next to a man with an arrow sticking
		out of his upper chest. She carefully removed his shirt while giving instructions.
		"Rebecca, get as many clean rags as you can. Tear some into long strips. Get water
		and throw a poker in the fire. Michael, I need you to hold him still while I push the
		arrow through." The young man swallowed and grimaced as he grabbed hold of the
		injured man's shoulder. "Okay, now I'm going to rotate him onto his side." As
		she did, she thought how grateful she was that the man was unconscious. She hoped he was
		out enough not to feel the pain. She wasn't that lucky. He woke and let out a
		bloodcurdling scream when she pushed the arrow through and broke off the point. Rebecca
		ran over and knelt at his head.</p>

		<p>"What's your name?" she asked as she stroked his
		temples.</p>

		<p>"W-William." His voice was hoarse from screaming.
		</p>

		<p>"My name is Rebecca. That's my friend Josie and that's
		Michael. We're here to help you, okay? Now, I want you to lie back and let me tell you a
		story."</p>

		<p>"It hurts," he gasped. Josie rose to check on the
		poker.</p>

		<p>"Shh, it's okay. I know it hurts," Rebecca spoke in
		soothing tones, encouraging William to relax. "There once was a beautiful young
		woman....", she continued to weave her tale, completely hypnotizing both him and
		Michael. Josie reached down and, in one fluid motion, grabbed the shaft and pulled it from
		the man's body. Rebecca had been watching the outlaw and had her hands on William's
		shoulders just as Josie reached down. William screamed and continued to scream as Josie
		cauterized the entry and exit wounds before he mercifully passed out from the pain.
		</p>

		<p>"Now just what in tarnation is going on down here?" The
		voice was female, albeit a bit deep, but Rebecca would have sworn she was looking at a
		man. Short dark hair framed a slightly rounded face, weathered from years of hard living
		and harder drinking. The woman focused on Josie. "You! Damn, I thought you was dead,
		killed back there with your gang."</p>

		<p>"Henry and Jonah aren't dead, Jane, neither am I."
		Josie rose and gestured at the young blonde woman. "This is my friend Rebecca.
		Rebecca, this is Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca and Michael struggled to move the sick people upstairs
		while Josie and Jane tended to the injured people downstairs.</p>

		<p>"Are you the only one caring for all these people?"
		Josie asked as she continued to stitch up a nasty gash in her patient's abdomen. Jane
		removed a small flask from her belt and took a long pull. "I do what I can. It seems
		like there's more sick and injured every day. I can't keep up with 'em all.", she
		held out the flask. Seeing the shake of the outlaw's head, she said, "Suit yerself.
		You go help someone else, I've got this one."</p>

		<p>Josie nodded and moved off to tend to another man felled by
		arrows. This time the wound was mortal and she knew it. The outlaw found she couldn't meet
		the young man's eyes as she passed by him in search of someone she could help.</p>

		<p>Rebecca and Michael worked together trying to cool down the
		feverish patients or warm up the ones suffering from chills. "Michael, do you know
		what these hard red lumps are?" she asked, pointing to a rash of rapidly forming
		lumps on the victim's arm.</p>

		<p>"No," he said as he shook his head. "I've never
		seen anything like that before." He rubbed his temples. "Ah, I wish there was
		some laudanum. I swear it feels like there's a herd of cattle stampeding in my head."
		His hands moved to completely cover his temples as he fell to his knees.</p>

		<p>"Michael!" Rebecca exclaimed as she knelt by his side.
		</p>

		<p>"It hurts, oh it hurts," he cried as tears started to
		leak out from his tightly shut lids. Rebecca moved his hands out of the way and started to
		gently massage his temples. She moved her thumbs down to massage his upper neck, relieving
		the tension as she hummed a gentle melody.</p>

		<p>"Just relax and think of a time when you were happy. Close
		your eyes and think of that time. Tell me about that time."</p>

		<p>"I was ten, back when we stilled lived in Virginia. Papa had
		just bought me a horse of my very own," he smiled and leaned back against Rebecca's
		chest. She continued to massage his temples. "I was a small boy. I couldn't get up in
		the saddle."</p>

		<p>"I know that feeling," she said with a laugh in her
		voice. "I'm sorry, go on."</p>

		<p>"You have a beautiful voice, Rebecca. It goes well with your
		beautiful face." They exchanged soft smiles of nervousness. "What was I...oh,
		the horse. I couldn't get up on my own. I remember papa coming over and lifting me up in
		his arms to put me on the saddle. I never felt more safe, or more loved."</p>

		<p>"That's a very sweet story," Rebecca said looking down
		at him. Michael's head was now resting in her lap. She noticed beads of perspiration on
		his forehead. "You're warm," she said with concern in her voice. "I mean
		really warm. I'll get Josie."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I'm fine." He forced himself into a sitting
		position, facing her. "Why don't you go see if Josie needs anything and I'll get back
		to looking after these people."</p>

		<p>Josie put her to work cleaning soiled rags and blood-soaked
		knives. Rebecca estimated there must be at least twenty men with wounds from fighting and
		thirty men and women who were sick. She had seen at least a dozen of them upstairs while
		she was looking for rags. Many of them had the hard red lumps on their arms and legs. Some
		complained to her of pain, and she shared what laudanum they had with the ones who seemed
		to be in the most pain until there was none left. After that all she could do was provide
		them with a gentle touch and a soft voice for a few moments of peace. The young woman was
		so exhausted by the time Josie found a place for them to lay down that she fell asleep
		immediately, not even taking the time to ask the outlaw about the skin rashes.</p>

		<p>Josie removed her gun belts and lay down next to the sleeping
		form. It wasn't long before she too was asleep. For the first time in almost a month, she
		was blessed with no nightmares. The gunslinger's dreams were filled with peaceful visions
		of her life when she was young, just before the war between the states broke out. Swirling
		images of her mother and her friends sitting in the parlor, speaking of great changes
		coming, and of laughter and warmth, of love and safety. Josie smiled in her sleep and
		remained that way all night long.</p>

		<p>The next three days were spent in much the same fashion. Soldiers
		from the nearby fort started to pour in with various arrow and hatchet wounds from their
		raids on the Indians. Rebecca and Michael continued to care for the rapidly worsening sick
		people while Josie tended to the wounded. Jane alternated between the two floors, doing
		her best to calm and comfort as many as she could. She realized that the young girl and
		man didn't know that the people they were treating were suffering from smallpox. The
		sharpshooter deliberately kept the information from Josie as well. She needed all the help
		she could get and it was too late to protect them from the contagious disease now. Either
		they got it or they didn't. With all the wounded soldiers coming in, it was easy to keep
		the outlaw busy downstairs. At night, both Josie and Rebecca were too tired to sit up and
		talk. They merely curled up in their corner of the room and slept. Neither woman had
		really spoken to the other since they first arrived. Rebecca spent most of her time
		upstairs with the sick while the outlaw still hadn't made it up there yet.</p>

		<p>Carrying two cups of coffee, Rebecca made her way over to where
		Michael was standing, staring out the window. She placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.
		"Michael? Are you all right?"</p>

		<p>He turned his tear-streaked face to see her. "Oh Rebecca.
		It's Mother...she, she..." He broke into sobs as he pressed his face against her and
		wrapped his arms around her in a fierce embrace. Rebecca set the mugs down on the nearby
		windowsill and guided him to the floor. She rocked him in her arms as he desperately
		sought comfort from the pain in his heart. She noted that his forehead still felt like it
		was on fire. Rebecca took one of his hands in hers and took a good look at it. Multitudes
		of the bright red lumps were forming on his wrist and lower arm.</p>

		<p>Rebecca went downstairs and found Josie changing a soldier's
		bandages. "Josie, I need to talk to you." She waited until the bandages were
		changed and led the outlaw outside.</p>

		<p>"What's going on?" Josie didn't like the concerned look
		on her young friend's face. Rebecca looked downward, feeling guilty for not telling her
		sooner.</p>

		<p>"Josie, the sick people upstairs...they've got something
		contagious."</p>

		<p>The outlaw bounded up the stairs two at a time, glad that Rebecca
		was behind her and unable to see the stricken look on her face. Her worst fears were
		confirmed when she saw Michael crying over the dead body of his mother. His bare arms
		clearly showed the signs of the pox. She put her arm out to stop Rebecca from entering the
		room. "No."</p>

		<p>"Josie, I have to check on Michael," she said as she
		tried to move past the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's too dangerous," Josie said as she
		grabbed both of the young woman's upper arms. "Don't you understand? It's smallpox,
		Rebecca." Her grip relaxed when she saw the shocked expression on her friend's face.
		</p>

		<p>"No.&#133;" She looked up at Josie with disbelief.
		"But Michael, he's so young."</p>

		<p>"Smallpox doesn't care how old you are, Rebecca." She
		allowed a brief flash of concern to cross her normally stoic face as she pressed her hand
		against the young woman's face. "How do you feel?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca smiled at the gesture. "I'm fine, Josie. Look, if I
		was going to get it, I would have it already," she said, feigning a confidence she
		didn't feel. They looked at each other seriously, their eyes conveying the unspoken fear.
		</p>

		<p>Josie, Rebecca, and Jane sat around a small kitchen table.
		"Why didn't you say anything, Jane?" the outlaw asked with a tone that expressed
		her disapproval.</p>

		<p>"By the time I realized you were here, you both had already
		been exposed to it. T'wernt nothing I could've done 'bout it," she said, settling
		back and rolling herself a cigarette. "You see what I'm up against. Half those men
		would've been dead if you hadn't stayed to help. And that little girl of yours was a big
		comfort to them as well. She's a real huckleberry above a persimmon," Rebecca smiled
		at the compliment from the sharpshooter. Jane noted to herself that it seemed so odd that
		an angel like that was riding around with her old partner in crime. Josie was not one to
		ride with people whenever possible, and certainly not with such a fresh-faced young woman.
		</p>

		<p>"Rebecca has a way with words." Her blue eyes turned to
		capture the young woman's gaze. "She has a...calming effect on people. It's a rare
		quality." She turned back to her old friend. "You should have told me,
		Jane."</p>

		<p>"There's nothing we can do about it now, Josie,"
		Rebecca said as she rose from the table. "I'm going to go check on Michael," she
		said, holding up a hand to block the outlaw's protest. "Josie, he's all alone and he
		needs me. I'll be fine."</p>

		<p>"Josie, I'm sorry," Jane said as she poured them both
		another cup of coffee. "She's a beautiful girl. I'm sure she'll be fine."
		</p>

		<p>"I hope so. Ugh, Jane, stop trying to kill me with your
		coffin varnish," she said as she took a swallow of the overcooked coffee.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie went upstairs two hours later to fetch Rebecca for bed.
		With the influx of sick and injured, they could both use the extra rest. Opening the door
		to the large room, she was surprised to see how many people were there. She had assumed
		that there had been only a dozen or so people up there. A quick mental count of the dead
		that had been brought down made her think that there were only a few remaining. She now
		realized that there were close to a dozen still there. Pulling her bandanna up over her
		nose and mouth, she entered.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was kneeling next to Michael's bed holding his hand
		within hers. Josie stood back and leaned against a post, close enough to hear but not
		close enough to be noticed.</p>

		<p>"...and the rabbit slipped into the hole and escaped from
		the hungry wolf," she finished her story and ran a wet cloth across his burning
		forehead. "How was that?"</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Rebecca," he said as he reached up and
		touched her cheek with his fingertips. "You're a very beautiful creature. I'm
		sorry."</p>

		<p>"Shh, you need to rest now." She moved a lock of his
		dark hair away from his eyes. "Everything will be fine, just have faith."
		</p>

		<p>"No..." he gasped. "I know, Rebecca. I know what's
		wrong with me."</p>

		<p>"Then you also know that you need to rest. You can survive
		this, you know." She maintained her low, soft tones as she tried to lull him back
		into sleep. He brought his free hand up and grabbed her wrist.</p>

		<p>"Don't leave me, Rebecca. Please...stay and tell me another
		story."</p>

		<p>Josie closed the door behind her quietly. She swallowed and
		closed her eyes as she thought about how hard his death was going to be on her young
		friend. A small voice in the back of her mind asked her if she could handle losing
		Rebecca. Josie pushed the thought out of her head and purposefully headed down the stairs
		to their sleeping area. Knowing that thoughts of a peaceful sleep were hopeless, she
		turned and went to check on the patients.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca never left his side as the high fever gave way to
		delusional ranting and the night chills left him a helpless shell of the once vibrant
		young man. She stayed there telling her stories or quietly holding his hand. The red pox
		marks now covered his entire body, signaling just how close the end really was.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I...I can't see...everything's black," he
		cried, his voice hoarse and low. The strength he used to move patients was now all gone,
		taken by the vicious disease. Tears streamed down the sides of his face; she brushed them
		away with her fingers.</p>

		<p>"It's okay, Michael. Just rest now. It's going to be
		okay." Her voice cracked as she choked on the truth that she could no longer ignore.
		</p>

		<p>"I know, Rebecca," he said as he reached up with a
		shaky hand to touch her face. "So beautiful. I'm so sorry, Rebecca...so sorry."
		His hand fell onto his now still chest.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Through blinding tears, Rebecca ran downstairs and into Josie's
		arms. The young woman sobbed hysterically against the outlaw's chest. "Why?" she
		cried over and over, as her tears soaked the cotton shirt. Unsure of what to say, Josie
		remained quiet, tentatively stroking the blonde hair in a comforting motion. Jane walked
		over to them with a cup of tea for Rebecca to drink.</p>

		<p>"It'll calm her down," the sharpshooter said as she
		handed the mug to Josie. It took some convincing to get the upset girl to drink the strong
		liquid. It wasn't long before her tears abated and she started yawning.</p>

		<p>"What was in that?" Josie asked later, after they had
		gotten Rebecca to sleep and removed Michael's body. Jane handed her a mug of coffee before
		taking a swig from her flask.</p>

		<p>"'Nuff laudanum to make her sleep through the night, is
		all," she said as she scratched herself. "What's a purty young thing like that
		hanging 'round with you fer, anyway?"</p>

		<p>"What are you doing playing nursemaid to a bunch of
		miners?" Josie returned, ignoring the question.</p>

		<p>"Someone has to," she quipped. "'Sides, you've
		knew I was always purty good at caring for people." Jane leaned back and put her
		booted foot upon the table. "What I don't git is why you ain't robbin' 'n lootin' no
		more."</p>

		<p>"She depends on me," Josie said, nodding toward
		Rebecca.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"There's no going back, ya know. Once you git a price on yer
		head, it'll always be there. Taint nothin' gonna change that," she said before taking
		another long pull on her flask. "Them bounty hunters don't care none that you
		changed, they just care 'bout <img src="calamity1.gif" alt="Calamity Jane" align="right" width="226" height="384"/>the money they been promised." Josie was just about to tell Jane that
		she had joined the ranks of the bounty hunters herself, when their conversation was
		interrupted by a low moan that was unmistakably Rebecca's. Josie leapt from her seat and
		headed over to her. The sweaty, flushed complexion struck fear into the outlaw's heart.
		Pushing the sweat soaked hair off of the young woman's forehead Josie felt the burning
		heat of fever. "Jane...Jane!" she yelled.</p>

		<p>The next three days were a blur to Josie. Every moment was spent
		at Rebecca's bedside, placing cool cloths across her body in a feeble attempt to break the
		raging fever.</p>

		<p>"We have to get the chickens into the coop before the
		coyotes get them," Rebecca mumbled. Josie removed the cloth from the young woman's
		forehead and dipped it in the bowl of now tepid water. It was the second time in an hour
		that Rebecca's fever had completely dried out the cloth.</p>

		<p>"I already took care of the chickens, Rebecca. You just rest
		now," she said as she placed the cloth back on the young woman's forehead. The
		incoherent ramblings had started that morning and only served to heighten Josie's sense of
		dread. She knew that the fever was just as likely to kill her friend as the infection from
		the blistering lumps that were now beginning to appear on her extremities.</p>

		<p>"Josie, you can't do nothin' for her, ya know. Either it
		kills her or it don't, ain't nothin' you can do 'bout it," Jane said
		as she placed another bucket of water next to her.</p>

		<p>"We'll see about that," the outlaw said as she soaked
		several cloths in the fresh water, only slightly cooler than the previous bucket. Jane
		shook her head and walked away, never seeing the stricken look on Josie's face as she
		reapplied the wet cloths.</p>

		<p>"Hang in there, Rebecca. Just hang in there."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca's temperature rose steadily during the night until it
		reached a dangerous level. Her lips moved, but all that came out was non-sensible mumbles.
		The reddish lumps were spreading from her arms and legs to the rest of her body. Many of
		the wounded were moved out of the boarding house as soon as they were able, leaving only a
		dozen people for Jane to nurse. Josie left Rebecca's side only to use the outhouse. She
		even slept on the floor next to the stricken girl's bed, refusing to leave her alone for
		longer than necessary.</p>

		<p>Josie's paramount concern was trying to find a way to break
		Rebecca's fever before it was too late. The wet cloths made almost no difference except
		perhaps to make the outlaw feel like she was doing something. Rebecca was too incoherent
		to be aware of her surroundings. Dawn was just breaking over the horizon when Josie rose
		to look out the window. The rest of the boarding house was still asleep, but her concern
		for her young friend kept her up all night. Rebecca's temperature hadn't gone up for
		hours, but it hadn't gone down either. Leaning her forehead against the cool glass, Josie
		closed her eyes and tried to think of a way to get her friend's temperature down.</p>

		<p>"Jane! Jane, wake up!" she said as she shook the
		sharpshooter.</p>

		<p>Instantly Calamity brought her fist up and was caught by Josie's
		quick reflexes.</p>

		<p>"What in the hell do you think yer doin'?" the groggy
		woman cursed as she sat up and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I need a large wagon and some strong mules."</p>

		<p>"Wagon? Mules? Now just hold on a minute, what are you
		talkin' about?"</p>

		<p>"Ice. We need ice to bring Rebecca's fever down. The wagon
		can't come into town because of the quarantine so I have to go get the ice." She
		grabbed Jane's arm and pulled her from the bed. It was only Calamity's understanding of
		Josie's desperation to save her friend that kept her from reaching for her guns. 'When
		this is over, one way or another, we're gonna talk about waking Martha Jane Canary up from
		a sound sleep,' she told herself as she jerked her arm away and reached for her britches.
		</p>

		<p>"Josie, how're you gonna get past the army? 'Taint no way
		you're gonna get through with a wagon and mule."</p>

		<p>"I'll just have to find a way," she said firmly.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>It was easier said than done, she realized when she finally got a
		look at the sentries placed a safe distance from the town. Josie knew they had orders to
		kill anyone who tried to leave before the quarantine was lifted. She knew she could slip
		in and out without being detected, but there was no way she could get a wagon through. She
		rubbed her biceps unconsciously before disappearing into a nearby thicket.</p>

		<p>Once she moved past the sentries, it was no problem to follow the
		road up hill to the icehouse. Her mental clock and the position of the sun told her that
		it had taken just over six hours for her to walk up the steep mountainside road to notice
		a cooling in temperature. Josie knew she couldn't be far. Her legs ached from the long
		journey and she groaned inwardly at the thought of going back with an extra fifty pounds
		of ice on her back.</p>

		<p>Being careful not to be noticed, Josie slipped into a storage
		shed and removed a large set of ice thongs and two saddle blankets. She folded one into
		thirds and tucked part of it up under her collar, letting the rest lay against her back.
		After folding the other blanket into thirds and then rolling it up, she grabbed the thongs
		and headed for the icehouse. Worried about how much ice would melt on the way down the
		mountain, Josie grabbed the biggest block she felt she could heft onto her back. After
		covering it with the second blanket, she jabbed the ice thongs into it. Bending down and
		turning around, she leaned the block of ice against the blanket on her back and pushed up
		with her legs. It took a moment for her to get her balance and then only by bending over
		slightly. Making certain that she wasn't spotted, Josie left the icehouse and started back
		down the mountain.</p>

		<p>She had been right in assuming that the cool air and the blankets
		would help maintain the life of the ice block, but she hadn't been right about one blanket
		being enough protection for her back from the cold. At least twice an hour Josie had to
		stop and not only rest her aching arms, but also to let her back warm up again. Several
		times she contemplated breaking the block down to a smaller size. The vision of her best
		friend, her only true friend, burning up with an uncontrollable fever filled her with a
		sense of guilt over her selfishness. Rebecca would need every piece of ice she could get
		in order to hopefully break her fever. With a grunt, Josie hefted the block onto her back
		again and continued her slow walk.</p>

		<p>Halfway down her burning legs, aching back, and screaming arms
		demanded a longer rest than a few minutes. Knowing that if she pushed herself too far she
		would never make it, Josie set the block down and leaned up against a tree. Looking at
		nothing in particular, the blue eyes came to rest upon the moonbeam bouncing off a willow
		tree. Leaning her head back and closing her eyes, Josie tried to remember what the old
		medicine woman had told her about willow trees. She looked again at the tree. It was a
		white willow, the bark of which when ground into a tea was a natural fever reducer.
		Forcing herself to her feet, the outlaw walked over to the tree. Pulling a knife out of
		her boot, Josie gouged out several long strips of bark and placed them in various pockets.
		With renewed hope, she jerked the block onto her back and set out again.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The sound of a boot kicking repeatedly at the door woke Jane up
		from her sound sleep. Cursing loudly, she cocked her Colt and opened the door. "Put
		her in the tub," Josie said as she took two steps inside and let the heavy block fall
		to the ground. Her fingers remained curled up from being held in such a tight grip for so
		long. With painful slowness she forced them to straighten. She didn't even try to hide the
		look of anguish on her face when she straightened up and tried to move her fingers. The
		first thing she did when she finally felt the feeling return was to reach into her pocket
		and pull out a piece of the bark. "I need to grind this down and make a tea out of
		it. It'll help bring her fever down." She pulled more pieces out of her pockets, and
		the sharpshooter reached out and took them from her.</p>

		<p>"I'll take care of this. You go sit down before you fall
		down," Jane said as she guided Josie to a nearby chair. "It's gonna take me a
		few minutes to git her into the tub and git the ice in there. You sit there for now."
		Josie had no choice but to flop down in the chair. Her legs felt like oak trees and she
		knew she had no strength left. Exhausted by the trek as well as the lack of sleep, it took
		only seconds for her eyes to close and slumber to take her.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie woke less than an hour later, the ache in her back cutting
		through her sleep. It took a moment for her completely exhausted senses to remember what
		was going on. With slow movements and a deep groan, she trudged off to check on Rebecca.
		</p>

		<p>"Yup. This should bring that fever down in no time,"
		the sharpshooter said as she added a few more pieces of ice into the water. "Just got
		her in there. Took a while to get the water and then haul that block in here. Had ta drag
		it. Tarnation woman, that block would break a mule's back. You daffy?"</p>

		<p>"We needed as much ice as we could get," Josie said as
		she knelt down next to the tub. "How ya doin?" she said softly as she dropped
		the pieces of ice that Jane was breaking off and giving her into the water. Rebecca's
		eyelids fluttered, but never opened. She seemed to be too weak to perform even that simple
		task. Once there was enough ice in the water to start it cooling down, Josie lowered
		Rebecca's head back until just her nose and mouth were above water. She placed towels
		under the young woman's head to keep it at that level while she moved the water about with
		her hand, forcing it to circulate around Rebecca's overheated body. Jane handed Josie the
		tall mug of tea made from the ground up bark.</p>

		<p>Josie nodded and took the mug. She dipped part of a clean cloth
		into the tea before bringing the fabric to Rebecca's lips. Parting them with her fingers,
		Josie squeezed the cloth, allowing a few drops at a time to fall into the young woman's
		mouth. As hoped, her body unconsciously swallowed. Ignoring the ache in her back and
		fingers, Josie continued to drip the tea into Rebecca's mouth until it was all gone.
		</p>

		<p>As the minutes ticked by, Josie continued her quiet vigil,
		removing water and adding ice when necessary, and constantly keeping the water flowing
		around in a clockwise motion. Her fingers were completely pruned from the lengthy
		immersion. The lack of sleep was catching up with Josie as she fought to keep her eyes
		open. The repetitive motion of churning the water didn't help; nor did her refusal to look
		at anything other than Rebecca's face, desperately hoping that it would look anything
		except so flushed.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Jane checked in on them an hour later to find the outlaw sleeping
		on the floor next to the tub. She noted that at some point extra towels had been placed in
		the tub to support and brace the young woman's head. It was as if Josie knew she would
		fall asleep and still tried to take care of Rebecca. Jane checked the water temperature,
		then placed her hand on the young woman's forehead. Turning her hand over, she checked
		both of the blonde woman's cheeks before checking her forehead again. "Cooler,"
		she said softly as she broke into a rare smile. "You did it, Josie," she said to
		the sleeping woman on the floor. "You broke her fever. The ice worked." She
		reached into the tub and lifted the small woman out. "I don't know how you did it,
		child, but if you only knew how much that woman went through for you. You just made a
		person who's killed more people 'n me go through hell 'n back to save you."</p>

		<p>Josie woke to find herself lying next to Rebecca in Jane's large
		bed. She quickly looked around for her gun, disoriented. "Relax, Josie," Jane's
		voice called out from the darkened shadows of dusk. The oil lamp was burning low on the
		table next to the bed, but it cast enough light for the sharpshooter to see Josie reach
		over to check on Rebecca. "She's fine...at least the fever broke anyway." Jane
		watched as the outlaw ran the backs of her fingers over the young woman's cheeks.
		"She woke up earlier fer a few minutes. Saw you there and fell back asleep."
		Jane quieted down when she realized that Josie was paying no attention to her.</p>

		<p>"You did it, didn't you?" she whispered as she gave
		Rebecca a soft kiss on the forehead. "You fought it and you beat it." Josie
		pulled her into her aching arms and held her close. "It's going to be fine now,
		everything will be fine."</p>

		<p>Jane quietly extinguished the lamp and closed the door behind
		her, leaving the sleeping women to their dreams.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Morning found Rebecca awake and alert and itching like crazy. The
		fever had given way to the second phase of smallpox, the burning, painful blisters that
		spread from the extremities to the rest of the body. Their extreme itchiness often made
		victims scratch themselves to the point of bleeding, increasing their chances for severe
		infections, which just as often killed the victims as the fever. By the time Josie entered
		with breakfast and tea, the young woman had scratched her left forearm raw and was
		starting on the right one. "What are you doing?" She growled as she set the tray
		down and grabbed Rebecca's wrists to stop her. "Rebecca, you know better than
		that," Josie said as she looked down at the red, irritated skin. Some spots were
		starting to bleed from the intense clawing. Josie sighed. "Look, I know it itches,
		but you have to keep from scratching. It'll only get worse." With that admonition she
		released Rebecca's wrists.</p>

		<p>"I know..." she said in a small voice. "But it
		itches so much." Her green eyes held Josie with a look of pain and discomfort.
		Rebecca started to rub the underside of her left wrist against her knee, covertly trying
		to scratch without being caught.</p>

		<p>"No!" Josie said, reaching out and grabbing the young
		woman's wrists again. Inside, Josie's heart was overflowing with compassion for her young
		friend's pain and irritation, but she knew the chance of scarring and infection were
		significantly decreased if Rebecca didn't scratch the blisters open.</p>

		<p>"They itch and they hurt," she cried as she tried to
		pull her arms away from the much stronger woman. "Josie, please, I can't take
		it..." Her words broke into sobs as she tried again to wrench her wrists out of the
		outlaw's grasp. The desperation in her green eyes to scratch equaled the determination in
		Josie's blue ones not to let her.</p>

		<p>"I know it's hard, but you have to fight it," she said
		in a gentle voice.</p>

		<p>"I can't." Rebecca cried as the tears streamed down her
		face. Not knowing what else to do, Josie pulled the young woman into her arms and held
		her. Within seconds, she felt Rebecca's arms moving against her back and quickly realized
		what she was up to. She again grabbed the young woman's wrists.</p>

		<p>"Jane!" She called out and waited for the sharpshooter
		to enter the room. "I need two wide strips of cloth, try and find the softest
		material you can." Josie watched as Rebecca's eyes grew wide at the realization of
		what was about to happen.</p>

		<p>"Josie...no...please." The stream of tears increased
		along with her struggle to free herself. "You can't do this, you just can't."
		</p>

		<p>The gunslinger's heart lurched at the impassioned plea, filling
		her with guilt for causing the hysterical tears. Jane returned with two wide strips of
		cloth that appeared to come from an old sheet. Together they held the struggling Rebecca
		down and tied her wrists securely to the bed frame. A tantrum ensued as the young woman
		flailed her legs wildly in a feeble attempt to escape her confinement. One bare foot
		connected with the side of Calamity's face, the nail causing a slight scratch on her
		cheek. Josie held her breath and slowly moved her hand down to her sidearm, well aware of
		the sharpshooter's quick temper. To her surprise and relief, Jane merely wiped the small
		trickle of blood from her face and stepped out of range of the kicking legs. "Scrappy
		thing, ain't she?" she quipped, cutting through the momentary tension.</p>

		<p>"That she is," Josie replied, careful to avoid the
		green eyes that were blazing with anger and frustration.</p>

		<p>"Let...me...GO!" She continued her kicking, which did
		nothing more than fuel her frustration. "You can't do this to me, Josie." She
		pounded the bed with her feet. "You're nothing but an overgrown bully," she said
		kicking again. Jane took the opportunity to exit quietly, leaving the outlaw with her
		charge.</p>

		<p>"You're just going to wear yourself out with all that
		kicking," Josie said calmly, yet still keeping her distance from the flailing legs.
		</p>

		<p>"I don't care! You let me out of this..." She jerked
		her wrists against the restraints. "Josie, you know this isn't fair. I wouldn't make
		you suffer like this." She knew her words were hurting her friend, her best friend.
		But at the moment, all thoughts of kindness and compassion were gone, replaced with the
		burning desire to ease the painful prickling feeling in her arms and legs. The muscles in
		Josie's jaw tightened as she fought to remind herself that Rebecca was only lashing out
		because of the pain.</p>

		<p>"I'm going to find something to help with the itching. Until
		then you'll have to stay tied up."</p>

		<p>"Josie, please..." She stopped kicking and turned her
		green eyes to lock with the gunslinger's. Rebecca moved her right foot and used a toenail
		to scratch an itch on the back of her left leg. The movement was not unnoticed by Josie,
		who turned and left the room for a moment, only to return with two more strips of cloth.
		</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Rebecca. You give me no choice," she said
		as she approached the now frantically kicking woman. In her thrashing about, Rebecca never
		saw the misting in Josie's eyes as she tied the knots that would prevent her best friend
		from hurting herself more.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie stared at the reflection in the mirror. The large purpling
		spot on her jaw was still tender to the touch even hours after Rebecca's heel had
		connected with it. Using a clean cloth, she carefully tended to the scratches that dotted
		her face and arms from her young friend's frantic attempt to keep her legs free. 'You're
		loosing your touch, old girl," she muttered. She always prided herself on her
		alertness and her ability to stay out of harms way. With Rebecca she never saw the blow
		coming, a rare thing indeed for the experienced gunslinger. With a quiet sigh, she set the
		cloth down on the edge of the sink and left the boarding house, needing a few minutes
		alone to sort out her thoughts.</p>

		<p>Once outside, Josie sought the shelter of a small grove of trees
		on the edge of town. Her still recovering muscles groaned at her thought of climbing up
		into the branches and she relented, deciding instead to sit on the ground and lean her
		back up against the trunk of a tall deadwood tree. She closed her eyes, letting her mind
		go through the litany of ways to ease Rebecca's suffering. The most common treatment for
		the blisters was a paste made of sulfa drugs. Of course the apothecary's store had long
		ago run out of such drugs. Soaproot would help, but her searches of the riverbanks turned
		up no sign of the plant. Damn quarantine, she thought to herself. There wasn't enough time
		for her to slip out of town, go to Rapid City for the medicine, and still make it back to
		Deadwood in time to save Rebecca. Josie brought her strong fingers up to firmly rub her
		temples in a vain attempt to ward off the impending headache.</p>

		<p>Her keen hearing picked up the sound of a wagon approaching in
		the distance. Of course, with the amount of noise the wagon was making, anyone would have
		heard it. Josie listened carefully, picking out the various sounds. It was obviously a
		wooden wagon, based on sound of metal clanging against metal and wood. That sound was most
		likely pots and pans banging against the sides. The hoof beats indicated at least two
		large horses carrying a heavy load. Whatever it was it was worth investigating, she
		decided as she rose to her feet and took off in the direction of the sound. It took her
		only a few minutes to reach the road that ran past the town, now guarded by soldiers from
		the nearby fort.</p>

		<p>"This town is under quarantine. No one in or out. Turn
		around and head back to Rapid City," the soldier said as he approached the wagon, his
		attention on the portly man at the reins. Josie watched quietly from her vantage behind a
		nearby bush.</p>

		<p>"Ooh, a captive audience, how delightful," the driver
		said, his voice slightly higher than one would expect from a man with his girth. His face
		sported a short beard, the same dark color that his hair once was, now graying with age.
		"Look, I can help whatever is wrong with them. I have medicines and elixirs
		and...."</p>

		<p>"I said no one enters, by order of Governor Mellette,"
		the soldier said, bringing his rifle up against his body to make sure the man understood
		the meaning.</p>

		<p>"Oh...I see what you're saying. No one enters." He
		forced a laugh to cover his intensely growing fear. "Well then, I guess I'll just be
		off."</p>

		<p>A sound in the bushes caused both men to turn around. What they
		saw was Josie somersaulting through the air at them. Before the soldier could raise his
		rifle into firing position, her boots landed squarely against his chest. A quick blow to
		his temple from the butt of her gun sent him into blackness. She turned her attention back
		to the man on the wagon, who looked like he was either going to cry or faint with his
		fear.</p>

		<p>"Now, I don't have much here, miss...ah...I mean..."
		</p>

		<p>"Shut up," she snarled as she headed to the side of the
		wagon. This was obviously a patent medicine man, she thought to herself. It was a
		traveling show wagon, with doors on the side and back, with a fold up stage for
		performing. Most likely he had a dancer or juggler inside the wagon who would come out and
		perform in towns to draw the crowds before he made his appearance, hawking elixirs that
		were little more than alcohol and syrup. Removing one Colt from her holster, she aimed at
		the door. "Come on out," she said in her most intimidating voice. Without
		turning around, Josie pulled her other Colt out and shot the hand of the soldier, forcing
		him to drop the rifle that was trained on her. A young man and woman exited the wagon. The
		man looked to be in his early twenties, thin and gangly with extremely thinning blonde
		hair. His face bore more acne scars than Josie had ever seen before. The young woman, on
		the other hand, was quite the pleasant sight to look at. Her flaming red hair was tied up
		in a swirling bun on her head, her worn dress hugging her bosom, forcing it up to
		tantalize and distract. Josie was certain that this woman was little more than a traveling
		whore doubling as an assistant to the flimflam man.</p>

		<p>"P-please allow me to introduce myself," the bearded
		man said nervously as he stepped down from the wagon. "My name is Salvatore, but most
		people call me Sal. Do you perhaps have an ailment that requires my attention?" he
		asked in a hopeful tone.</p>

		<p>"Sulfa drugs, all you have."</p>

		<p>Sal laughed nervously and wrung his hands together. "I
		ah...I mean sulfa drugs are extremely costly, if you know what I mean...urumph!" He
		found himself being held by the throat, his body off the ground and pressed against the
		side of the wooden wagon with enough force to rattle the warped door.</p>

		<p>"Where?" she growled menacingly. She extended her arm
		and stepped back a bit, worried that the extremely terrified man would lose control of his
		bladder. Her biceps screamed at the strain, but her concern for Rebecca overrode the pain.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>It took only a few minutes for Josie to look through the
		different elixirs and creams Sal had stored away in his wagon. She found four crates of
		soaproot and two jars of salve made from sulfa drugs along with several bottles of
		laudanum. The majority of the remaining bottles contained mixtures that were mostly syrup
		and alcohol - good for making someone forget what ails them, but not much else. It was
		obvious that he had just restocked his supplies recently. The gunslinger smiled at her
		good fortune. There was enough medicine here to care for all the victims still suffering
		at the boardinghouse.</p>

		<p>"But you can't just take all my medicine..." Sal
		protested as Josie climbed up and took the reins. He scrambled up next to her, terrified
		of her but just as terrified of One-Eyed Henry back in Rapid City, the man who loaned him
		the money to pay for the supplies. Death from this madwoman would be a comfort compared to
		what Henry would do to him if he didn't show up in three days with the money plus
		substantial interest.</p>

		<p>"If you and your friends haven't been exposed to smallpox
		before it would be a good idea to stay here."</p>

		<p>"Smallpox? Did you say smallpox? Well, why didn't you say
		so? Just wait a second." He climbed down and spoke quickly to his assistants before
		pulling a small tent and other camping supplies off of their various positions on the
		wagon and placing them on the ground. "My town suffered through the pox back in the
		fifties," Sal said as he climbed back into the seat. "Why do you think I wear a
		beard in the middle of July?" He pointed to several small pitted scars that were
		mostly hidden by his facial hair. "Here, Buttercup and Raven are a bit skittish with
		unfamiliar people," he said, taking the reins from the gunslinger. With a cluck of
		his tongue, they were off toward town. "They're just kids," he said once they
		were on the road into town, referring to his two companions.</p>

		<p>"They'll be fine out here for a few days. Billy's a bit of a
		Jonathan, what with his family coming from Delaware and all, but he knows enough to keep
		them alive for a few days." He noted the faraway look in Josie's eyes and asked, with
		genuine concern in his voice, "Someone you love got the pox?" He hoped he
		wouldn't end up with a bullet for his question.</p>

		<p>"There are a dozen people suffering from it right now. Most
		of the others have died," she said, her blue eyes never leaving the road before them,
		her senses working to pick up any sign of trouble. The key to saving Rebecca was in this
		wagon and she was going to defend it with her life if necessary. Sal figured out the
		unspoken answer and gave the rein a flick, sending the horses into a trot.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The now unusual sound of a wagon pulling up outside brought
		Calamity Jane to the door. Her heart leapt with joy at the sign of the patent medicine
		man's wagon. "We've got soaproot and some sulfa paste," Josie said as she swung
		her long legs and jumped down from the seat. Sal used the handles and carefully stepped
		down. Together, the three of them brought all the usable medicine inside. Sal left to tend
		to his horses.</p>

		<p>Using mortars and pestles, the women ground the soaproot into a
		fine powder. Although not as effective as the sulfa paste, the tuber would be enough to
		ease the painful itching and help to draw out some of the blisters. Jane went to tend the
		others while Josie took up residence next to Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Howdy," she said groggily. Jane had given the young
		woman several doses of laudanum in an attempt, quite simply, to make her too drunk and
		doped to fight the restraints.</p>

		<p>"Howdy yourself," Josie answered softly as she examined
		the rash, which now had moved up the arms and legs to cover most of Rebecca's body. Her
		face was mottled with several small red marks. "I have some medicine to help
		you."</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew better than to ask Josie to untie her again. The
		pasty mix of soaproot and sulfa drugs was cool against her overheated skin. She closed her
		eyes and relaxed under the older woman's gentle treatment. Josie worked slowly, making
		sure to carefully cover every inch of Rebecca's body with the healing salve. "Josie,
		aren't you afraid of catching it?"</p>

		<p>Josie paused for a moment, remembering a time long ago. Her blue
		eyes took on a faraway look. "There was an outbreak of smallpox on the reservation.
		The disease was new to the Cherokee; they had no natural defense to it." Like
		alcohol, she thought ruefully. "Smallpox wiped out most of the people in my tribe. I
		was around it the whole time and never got sick. I guess I'm just immune to it." A
		momentary flash of pain crossed her face as she remembered all the sick and dying and her
		helplessness to do anything about it.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." the little blonde said, trying to bring her
		friend back to the present. "I'm sorry about earlier..." her gaze fell on the
		purple bruise on the gunslinger's cheek.</p>

		<p>"Don't worry about it, Rebecca," she smiled, trying to
		lighten the mood. "Just don't get the idea that you'll ever get away with it
		again." Josie held up a mock fist in jest. Both shared the rare playful mood for a
		few more moments while she finished applying the salve.</p>

		<p>Sal returned a short time later his arms burdened down with a
		crate full of items he felt would be helpful to the suffering people. Without hesitation,
		he followed Jane's directions and started to help out. He chatted amiably with the people,
		holding some hands and generally lifting the mood with his infectious smile and chatter.
		</p>

		<p>"Who is that?" Rebecca asked. "He looks like a
		used wagon salesman."</p>

		<p>"Actually, he's one of those traveling medicine men. He was
		kind enough to supply us with all this medicine," she allowed a tone of gratitude to
		filter into her voice. "I found him on the road."</p>

		<p>"How did you convince him to come into a town with
		smallpox?" she asked. Thinking better of it she added, "Never mind. I'm sure I
		don't want to know."</p>

		<p>Josie chuckled. "No, you probably don't. Why don't you try
		to rest for a while?" She adjusted the pillow and turned down the lamp next to the
		bed.</p>

		<p>"Josie, you need to rest too."</p>

		<p>"I will, Rebecca. I just need to check on the others first.
		I'll be back in a little bit."</p>

		<p>Having Rebecca tied to the four corners of the bed made it
		impossible for Josie to sleep next to her. She contemplated undoing the straps for the
		night, but realized that the general movements of sleep could rub the salve off the young
		woman's skin. With a sigh, Josie pulled the comforter off of the end of the bed and laid
		it out on the floor.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Although Josie used most of the sulfa paste to blend with the
		soaproot, she kept a small amount aside, using the concentrated form on Rebecca's face,
		determined to do her best to prevent her pretty young friend from being scarred severely
		from the pox. Her efforts paid off handsomely as the days wore on. The itching stopped and
		Rebecca was finally untied, much to everyone's relief. Despite her normally gentle nature,
		the words and phrases that she came up with were enough to make a harlot blush. Although
		Josie abhorred physical discipline, she was sorely tempted to throw her young friend over
		her knee several times for her sharp retorts and biting words. There was no doubt that
		Rebecca could match words with the best of them. The blisters scabbed over, but were
		showing little, if any, signs of scarring.</p>

		<p>Before Sal arrived with the medicine, less than one out of ten
		had survived the pox. Ten of the twelve remaining victims survived and thanks to the sulfa
		and soaproot, most came out of it with only a few mild scars. The only sign of scarring on
		Rebecca's face was a small spot below her jawbone, unnoticeable unless pointed out. Within
		two weeks, the quarantine was lifted and the boardinghouse was returned to its normal use.
		</p>

		<p>Rebecca and Josie escorted Sal to the stables. "I have to go
		see if Billy and Mary are still waiting for me," he forced a small laugh.
		"They've probably gone back to Rapid City."</p>

		<p>"They're waiting for you in Rapid City, Sal," Josie
		said as she stepped forward. "Go to the Horses Mouth Inn. It's been paid for, and so
