	<chapter title="25: Sinners?">
		<p>When Rebecca had recovered her strength sufficiently to travel,
		the pair set out for Wyoming Territory in search of an outlaw Josie had read about in the
		wanted posters, who was reported to have been last seen in Cheyenne. The man was known to
		have murdered a woman and her child because they got in his way as he was fleeing from a
		bank robbery. The cold-blooded murder of such innocence put him high on her list of
		fugitives to find, and she was itching to get on the road as soon as Rebecca was able.
		</p>

		<p>The long hot days of summer were shortening with the coming of
		fall, but the weather was still unusually hot and dry. The two women drew to a stop on a
		hill over looking a good-sized town spread out on the plain below them. It was close
		enough to Cheyenne to use as a starting point for tracking down the killer, but hopefully
		far enough away that he would not get wind of her nosing around. They decided that Rebecca
		should try to blend with the local population to see what she could pick up, and thought
		it would be better if they went into town separately. They watched as the overland
		stagecoach left town, and decided to send Rebecca in on foot. They found an abandoned
		corral that looked as if it was once used by the pony express before the trains came
		through, and left the wagon and Flossy there with an ample supply of water and access to
		grass. Rebecca changed into her new dress and entered town first, going to the boarding
		house and securing a room for the night. Josie rode in on horseback a short while later,
		noting the sign over the entrance to the main street proclaiming the town to be Rosewood.
		</p>

		<p>She took Phoenix to the stable and secured her lodgings before
		heading for the boardinghouse. An older woman whose brown hair was liberally salted with
		gray met her at the door. Rebecca was seated in the parlor with a glass of lemonade; Josie
		could see her over the woman's shoulder. "I am Miss Emily and this is my place."
		She looked at the tall gunslinger, brown eyes meeting blue. "I run a clean,
		respectable place here, uh...miss. I don't want any trouble," she said as her gaze
		fell on the guns on Josie's hips. Rebecca walked over and placed her hand on the old
		woman's forearm.</p>

		<p>"She's the friend I told you about. I assure you there will
		be no trouble. We're tired and really just want a place to sleep and eat." She took
		the pouch containing the money from Josie's belt and counted out six dollars for the
		lodging. Emily's eyes moved from the gunslinger to the pile of money in her hand, greed
		outweighing concern.</p>

		<p>"I don't provide meals other than morning coffee...one cup
		each," she said firmly. "Git your grub over at the Red Diamond. At least you'd
		fit in there," her last comment was directed at the woman in black. Looking down the
		street to the west of the boardinghouse was the saloon, a two-story structure with a porch
		and balcony. Several scantily clad women fanned themselves and watched the street from
		their vantage on the balcony. Red curtains adorned all the windows and several men were
		entering the saloon downstairs through the swinging doors. The hairs on the back of
		Josie's neck prickled with a warning that something was amiss. As Emily led them upstairs
		to their room, the gunslinger's eyes kept darting around, trying to pinpoint the source of
		her senses being on alert.</p>

		<p>Rebecca flopped back on the straw-filled mattress and let out a
		sigh. Josie's back was to her so the young woman was unable to see the smile that crossed
		her face before she resumed her normal stoic look. Their room was in the front, giving
		them an unobstructed view of the street below. No matter which direction she looked all
		Josie saw was the normal activities of a small town. People walking and riding about,
		storekeepers helping people load their purchases into their wagons, ladies with parasols
		walking arm in arm with well-dressed men. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Her brow
		furrowed as she tried to figure out the answer to the puzzle. "Guess we'll go get
		something to eat."</p>

		<p>"Eat? Sounds good." Rebecca smiled as she rose from the
		bed and headed for the door, reaching the handle before the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Never saw you move so fast, Rebecca," Josie teased.
		The young woman's green eyes twinkled.</p>

		<p>"Food has that effect on me," she replied. "Come
		on, you could use a good meal too."</p>

		<p>As Josie had expected, the Red Diamond was the local hangout for
		all the lower forms of life in town. Several round tables were filled with men playing
		poker while the women she had seen on the balcony earlier were either lining the bar and
		stairs or were trying to talk the men into giving up some of their money in the name of
		carnal pleasure. Josie allowed the corners of her lips to rise slightly. This is more like
		it, she thought to herself.</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked around the brightly-lit room, but most of her
		attention was on the common ladies of the evening that milled about. She also noted the
		looks from some of the men as they passed through the door. Most saw the tall gunslinger
		first and their faces registered the immediate fear. Those that managed to see past the
		woman in black and spotted her wore looks of undisguised lust. She felt like a sheep
		surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves and moved deliberately close to Josie, silently
		indicating that she had protection.</p>

		<p>"Whiskey," Josie said brusquely as she sat down on a
		stool at the bar, indicating with her eyes that her companion should sit next to her. The
		barkeep quickly produced a shot glass and the bottle. He looked to Rebecca for her order.
		</p>

		<p>"Sarsaparilla," she said quietly, not wanting the
		others in the place to hear. The barkeep snorted and went to look for the bottle of soda
		that he was certain was around somewhere, all the while thinking that the tall woman and
		short blonde made an odd couple</p>

		<p>Josie drained her shot of liquor and refilled her glass. A burly
		man who reeked of unwashed skin and clothes that hadn't seen soap in far too long came up
		behind them. Both women smelled him before he made his presence known by slapping his
		grimy hand on Rebecca's shoulder. "And just how much would ye be costin' me, little
		one?" His rancid breath made her forget about food.</p>

		<p>"Just a broken arm," Josie snarled as she moved with
		lightning speed off her seat and grabbed his arm, twisting it off her companion's shoulder
		and up behind his back. "Apologize," she hissed in his ear, pressing his arm
		upward sharply, driving home her point. "I said apologize to the lady."</p>

		<p>"S-sorry," he grumbled, his eyes tight from the pain
		shooting through his shoulder. "Now please...let me go."</p>

		<p>Josie took a long look around the saloon, making eye contact with
		all that were paying attention with a silent warning. She released her grip and stepped
		back, waiting to see if the man was stupid enough to fight her. Fortunately for him, the
		idea of slipping back into an alcoholic haze was more enticing then going up against the
		taller and better-armed woman. He muttered something unintelligible and moved on back to
		his table. Josie resumed her seat next to Rebecca, whose eyes never left the gunslinger.
		"Thank you," she said. Josie nodded and downed another drink.</p>

		<p>Josie ordered two dinners and looked around for the table she
		wanted. With Rebecca and the bottle in tow, she walked through the crowd and glared at the
		four men until they decided to take their card game somewhere else. She took the seat
		against the wall, affording her a clear view of the whole room, but not the stairs, which
		ran up the wall behind her. Rebecca reached for the chair opposite Josie, but the
		gunslinger indicated with her hand to take the chair next to her. At first the young woman
		thought it was because she wanted to talk to her, but she quickly realized that the bounty
		hunter didn't want her view of the doorway blocked. She downed two more drinks before
		dinner finally arrived. Both women were certain that they didn't want to know the origin
		of the meat in the lukewarm stew.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was halfway through the greasy stew when she noticed the
		gunslinger staring intently at a man sitting by himself in the far corner. His hat was
		pulled down over his eyes, obscuring most of his face. She reached over and lightly placed
		her fingertips on Josie's forearm to get her attention. "You know him?" she
		whispered. The bounty hunter's eyes never left her quarry.</p>

		<p>"He's wanted. I saw him in the group of wanted posters I
		looked at before."</p>

		<p>"Wanted for what?"</p>

		<p>"Rape and murder. That's Lefty Brown." Her eyes
		narrowed slightly. A commotion in the street drew everyone's attention to the door.
		"Stay here," Josie said firmly as she rose from her chair, her hands never far
		from her pistols.</p>

		<p>Outside the crowd had begun to gather, listening earnestly to the
		preacher standing atop a barrel. "Well, if it ain't ol' Reverend Righteous
		himself," one of the men behind Josie snorted.</p>

		<p>"Citizens of Rosewood, hear me. These sinners must be
		stopped. They bring nothing but disease and degradation to our fair town." His deep
		voice boomed over the crowd, drawing yells of approval. John Righteous, as he was called,
		stroked his short black beard as he thought of his next statement. "These
		harlots...these whores bring disease to our men, engaging in the vilest of acts," he
		said, the venom clear in his voice. Several of the women in question looked down from the
		balcony. The crowd outside the saloon grew as people poured out of every building to join
		the fray. Righteous smiled. All was going according to plan. "These whores must be
		stopped before they ruin all of us, so sayeth the lord," he shouted the last words.
		</p>

		<p>"So sayeth the lord!" the crowd responded. Josie now
		knew what made her so concerned earlier. She moved away from the door, not caring who she
		shoved out of her way, to reach Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Go out the back door and get back to the boarding
		house."</p>

		<p>"Josie..."</p>

		<p>"Now!" she growled, grabbing Rebecca firmly by the
		upper arm and hauling her out of her seat. "Rebecca, please just do what I say and
		ask questions later."</p>

		<p>The young woman nodded, but the fear still remained on her face.
		Josie led her over to the black oak door and slid the bolt. "Go, I'll get there when
		I can. Pack up our stuff, just in case." She waited until Rebecca was out the door,
		then bolted up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p>

		<p>Josie used her brute strength to bust down the first door she
		reached and entered the room. It held only a small table, lamp, and bed. The window was
		open, leading to the balcony. She pulled the curtains down to get them out of her way,
		opened the window, and leaned out. "Over here!" she called, catching the
		attention of the now frightened harlots. The crowd was now whipped up to a frenzied level,
		totally entranced by the reverend and his poisonous words. From her position at the
		window, Josie heard the calls for lynching from the mob.</p>

		<p>"No, my friends, hanging them will not end the
		scourge!" Reverend Righteous shouted, quieting the crowd done. "No....More will
		come to replace them....We need to cleanse this bastion of evil. From the ashes shall grow
		a new place free from sin."</p>

		<p>Josie's eyes widened, as she understood the reverend's
		intentions. "Move!" she yelled, breaking the whore's attention from the crowd.
		"Let's go; this place is going to burn!" she barked. One by one, she helped the
		women through the window. Most headed down the stairs and out the back door, but some ran
		to their rooms and grabbed whatever personal belongings they could carry in their arms
		before escaping.</p>

		<p>"Is that it?" Josie asked the young woman as she
		crawled through the window, stumbling when the gunslinger reached out with one hand and
		jerked her in the rest of the way. Already she could see the torches being lit. Her gun
		was raised in her left hand as she took a quick look out to make sure no women were still
		out there. In all, seven whores were waiting for her by the time she made it out the back
		door. The first torch sailed through the front window, smashing it to pieces.</p>

		<p>Josie looked around at the seven women. They looked at her
		expectantly, waiting for her to tell them what to do next. In her concern to get them out
		of the building, she never gave much thought about what to do with them afterwards. She
		ran her fingers through her raven hair while she took a moment to think.</p>

		<p>"Do any of you have horses?" the shaking of heads
		caused her hopes for a quick escape to sink. One woman stepped forward, her flaming red
		hair billowing in the warm breeze.</p>

		<p>"I've got two horses and a wagon at the corral. Be big
		enough to get us out of town," she said.</p>

		<p>"Good, we'll get it after dark," Josie replied. She
		looked around. Apparently the mob was too focused on their task to notice that they were
		missing. "Let's go," she said, hoping in her mind that Rebecca's powers of
		persuasion would work.</p>

		<p>"Absolutely not, I won't hear of it," Emily said firmly
		as she shook her head. "It's bad enough that I let this...this..." she tried to
		find just the right word to describe the tall woman in black without insulting her.
		"...person be here, but there is no way on god's green earth that I'm going to allow
		my home to be used as a hideout for those sinners."</p>

		<p>"Look at them," Rebecca said, trying to get the old
		woman to at least cast a glance at the whores. "Do you think they wanted to be doing
		this? Do you think they want to sell their bodies for money to drunken men?" She
		avoided looking at the whores herself, afraid that they would take her words the wrong
		way. "Don't you think their lives would have been different if they had been given a
		chance?"</p>

		<p>"They're sinners!" Emily shot back.</p>

		<p>"And you're not? You've never committed a sin? What about
		the men who pay for their services? Aren't they sinners too? Yet you let them stay here.
		Why are they any different?" Rebecca watched as the hard lines on the woman's face
		softened a bit at the logic of her words. She pressed on, knowing that the advantage was
		hers. "Most of these women never had the chance that you had. What would you do to
		feed yourself if you didn't have this boarding house?" She paused for effect.
		"Give them this one chance; let them stay until tonight. Then I promise that we'll
		get them out of here."</p>

		<p>Before Emily could answer, another loud commotion ensued outside.
		The angry mob, in their haste to burn down the saloon, forgot that there were buildings on
		either side of it. Both the assayer's and the telegraph office were now on fire. The
		bucket brigade had been started, with young boys running back and forth from the rain
		barrels with pails and buckets, handing them over to the grown men that were desperately
		trying to save that side of the street. Josie looked out the window, her eyes carefully
		scanning the street. She turned around and addressed the group of women.</p>

		<p>"Now is the perfect time to get out of here."</p>

		<p>Even though she felt she hadn't been spotted rescuing the whores,
		Josie nevertheless felt it safest for Rebecca if they left town as well before the mob
		realized what had happened. The only obstacle for them was Phoenix, who was stabled at the
		opposite end of town from the corral where Stacey's wagon and horses were kept. With as
		much stealth as was possible for seven brightly colored ladies in billowing dresses, they
		slipped around the back of the buildings and made their way up to the corral. Josie led
		the group with Rebecca never more than an arm's length away from her. One gun was drawn in
		the unlikely event that they were seen.</p>

		<p align="left">No one noticed the wagon pull out of the corral and
		leave town, nor did they notice the tall woman in black climbing from rooftop to rooftop
		as she made her way down the street to the stable. It took no time at all for Josie to
		saddle her steed and make her escape unnoticed. She rode Phoenix hard, forcing her into a
		full out gallop as soon as they cleared the burning town. The fire had spread rapidly
		traveling along the rooftops until the entire side of the street was burning. The banker
		was screaming frantically at the sheriff, who was busy trying to calm down the assayer,
		who was screaming about chemicals. The town was almost out of her sight when the
		explosions started. Josie guided Phoenix in a wide arc around the outskirts until she was
		finally heading in the same direction as the wagon. There was no doubt in the gunslinger's
		mind that the men of the town would be far too busy trying to save it to bother trying to
		round up a posse. She slowed the horse down to a less punishing gait and followed the twin
		rows of tracks laid down by the wagon. The hoof prints indicated that Stacey had slowed
		her horses down, so there was no need for the gunslinger to push her beloved mare. Within
		two miles, she caught up to the women. Rebecca was sitting in the back of the open wagon,
		chatting animatedly with several of the younger ladies of ill repute. Josie moved Phoenix
		in front of the wagon and led them off the trail for several miles before finding what she
		considered to be a safe place to stop. A small stream nearby would provide water and the
		gunslinger was certain she could round up some kind of meat for them to eat.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="26: The Ladies Of The Evening">
		<p>The horses were groomed and fed with the remainder of the oats in
		Phoenix's saddlebag while Rebecca and the other women washed up at the brook. Only Stacey
		and Josie remained behind. The prostitute tied her red hair up into a bun and pinned it
		into place to keep it off her neck in the heat of the late day sun. Josie leaned back
		against the wagon wheel her black hat pulled down far enough to block Stacey's view of her
		ice blue eyes. For the longest time, not one word had passed between them as the
		gunslinger methodically cleaned her weapons while the prostitute watched. It was Josie who
		finally broke the silence. "Something you find interesting about me?" she asked,
		her eyes never leaving her task.</p>

		<p>"Actually there is."</p>

		<p>"Yeah?" she asked with no sound of interest in her
		voice.</p>

		<p>"Why would someone like you try to help someone like
		us?" the redhead asked, her tone indicating her fear as well as her feelings about
		the woman with all the guns that she assumed to be a common murderer.</p>

		<p>Josie looked up, her blue eyes locking with the green across from
		her. "You mean a thieving, murdering pile of dung like me?" she said in mock
		distaste. The green eyes dropped immediately, guilty that her feelings were so obvious.
		Josie looked back down at her gun, spinning the barrel before snapping it shut and looking
		down the sight. She returned it to her holster and removed the other one before
		continuing. "I don't like to see women punished by the very men that put them in that
		position." In a lower voice she asked, "How many of the men in that crowd were
		regular customers?"</p>

		<p>"More than I'd care to admit," Stacey replied. Her gaze
		drifted off to the clouds as her mind traveled back to a simpler time. "After my
		husband died, I didn't..."</p>

		<p>"You don't owe me an explanation," Josie interrupted as
		she rose in one fluid motion. "I'd better go check on the others." She pulled
		the gun out of her left holster and held it out, butt first, toward the whore. "You
		know how?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," the redhead replied, rising to her feet and
		taking the offered weapon. The gunslinger nodded and walked off in search of the rest of
		the group.</p>

		<p>Two women were sunning themselves on the flat of a large rock.
		Their clothes were scattered nearby. Even in the distance, Josie was able to pick out the
		telltale criss-cross marks of repeated whippings on the back of one of the women. The
		black hair wasn't long enough to cover the red lines of a recent beating. Unable to look
		any longer, the gunslinger turned her attention to finding Rebecca. It took only a moment
		to spot the familiar blonde hair bobbing around, laughing and splashing with two of the
		younger women. The others were milling about in the water, enjoying the freedom of being
		naked without being pawed at. Josie called out, getting her attention. The women started
		getting out of the water, all naked save for Rebecca, who retained her thin cotton slip.
		The gunslinger smiled slightly at the young woman's modesty as she watched her gather her
		clothes and move behind the large rock to change. The others simply stood in the open and
		helped each other get dressed. Josie leaned back against a nearby tree and waited. She
		kept one eye on the rock that Rebecca was behind and the other on the naked bodies
		prancing about in front of her.</p>

		<p>Josie discovered that Elaine, the woman with the whip marks, was
		an excellent shot and the two of them set out to catch enough meat for dinner. In less
		than two hours, they had caught plenty of jackrabbits to feed the group. Neither spoke a
		single word during the hunt, but both learned much about the other. Elaine remained
		focused on her task, refusing to allow herself to be distracted by the distant sounds of
		the coyotes or fooled by the wind rustling the leaves of the brush. Josie understood this
		woman's determination to succeed in securing dinner for her friends. Elaine was clearly
		the one they turned to for guidance and protection.</p>

		<p>They were walking back toward the camp, each carrying three
		skinned and cleaned rabbits. The evening sun had set, the orange now only a slit on the
		horizon, the sky a dark gray, providing just enough light to see the camp clearly in the
		distance. "I could have caught enough for us by myself," Elaine said, her hazel
		eyes staring forward. "I didn't ask you to help."</p>

		<p>"Didn't matter; I had to catch food for us anyway,"
		Josie shrugged, not bothering to look at her.</p>

		<p>"That Rebecca is quite the child."</p>

		<p>"Meaning?" The gunslinger felt herself tense up, unsure
		of what the whore meant.</p>

		<p>"Just that she is naive. She knows nothing of the world
		around her, yet she rides with you, a woman with a price on her head." Elaine held
		her hands up in a defensive position when the gunslinger stopped suddenly and turned to
		face her. "Don't take much to figure out you're wanted for something. Innocent people
		don't run around with that many guns."</p>

		<p>Josie started walking again and the black headed woman fell into
		step. The bounty hunter's eyes stared straight ahead. "What I can't figure out is why
		you let that girl ride around with you. All you're going to do is get her an early meeting
		with Saint Peter."</p>

		<p>"Would you rather she became a whore like you?" the
		gunslinger said with a sneer.</p>

		<p>Elaine stopped and faced Josie. Her fingers dug into the
		carcasses as she fought to control her anger. "I guess that'd be a far sight better
		than being a murderer."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps," Josie replied, her voice betraying none of
		her feelings. "But be either long enough and it makes no difference." She turned
		and started walking again, not waiting for a response.</p>

		<p>The sun was low in the sky when they returned to camp. Josie
		deposited the dead animals near the fire and pulled Rebecca aside. "I have to go get
		the wagon."</p>

		<p>"Now?" she asked, looking at the sky. "Josie, it's
		almost dark. Can't we go get it in the morning?"</p>

		<p>"No. Stay here with them. I'll leave you the shotgun for
		protection."</p>

		<p>"How long will you be gone?" she asked. The gunslinger
		caught the tinge of fear in her young friend's voice.</p>

		<p>"I should be back by midnight." At her surprised look,
		Josie added, "I have to take the long way around the town coming back with the
		wagon."</p>

		<p>"Josie?" Rebecca's``` green eyes locked with those of
		the gunslinger. "Promise you'll be careful?" she asked, concerned. The bounty
		hunter looked at her for a moment before answering.</p>

		<p>"I promise, Rebecca. You try to stay out of trouble."</p>

		<p>"Me?" she asked, feigning innocence. Josie arched an
		eyebrow before grinning with her friend. The mirth ended a moment later when the
		gunslinger whistled for Phoenix. She mounted the steed and with one backward glance, she
		took off to retrieve their belongings. Rebecca stood there and watched until Josie was no
		longer in sight before turning around and joining the rest of the women.</p>

		<p>The aroma of roasting jackrabbit filled the air as the women
		circled around the fire and settled in for the evening. Victoria, the brown headed woman
		who was the last one rescued from the saloon, reached under the seat of the wagon and
		pulled out several bottles of whiskey and rum.</p>

		<p>"Victoria!" Stacey exclaimed as she rose and took one
		of the bottles out of the younger woman's hands. "When did you hide these in
		there?"</p>

		<p>"I been hidin' 'em there for a few months now. I take one
		every week or so. Nobody seemed to notice." Victoria looked over at Rebecca and
		added, "I got a few bottles of sarsaparilla too, if ya want."</p>

		<p>Rebecca hopped up and moved over to the opposite side of the
		fire, joining Victoria next to the wagon. They were born only months apart, and the
		proximity in age helped to make them fast friends. Within minutes, bottles were passed
		around along with pieces of cooked meat, skewered on sticks. Elaine and Stacey dumped part
		of a bottle of sarsaparilla out and replaced it with rum before passing it to Rebecca. The
		young woman gratefully accepted the bottle and drank deeply. The sarsaparilla tasted a bit
		odd to her, but Rebecca was determined to be polite and took another sip and smiled.</p>

		<p>As the evening wore on, Rebecca found that she liked the taste of
		the soda more and more. Victoria giggled slightly when she turned her head and saw Stacey
		pouring out over half of the remaining bottle of sarsaparilla and refilling it with the
		rum. One look at her new friend's green eyes in the firelight told her just how drunk she
		was.</p>

		<p>"Give it a try, Rebecca," Victoria urged, nudging the
		blonde woman with the half-empty bottle of rum. While they all had a turn with the bottle,
		the majority of the missing liquor was used to spike Rebecca's drinks.</p>

		<p>"Oookay, but only a slip," she replied, seemingly
		unaware that her speech was slurred slightly. All she knew was that she was feeling good
		and everything seemed funny to her. The others realized this as well and began to pepper
		her with jokes that no respectable woman would dare repeat, sending the young woman into
		fits of giggles. The soft laughter reached Josie's ears as she returned to camp with
		Flossy and the wagon. She looked up and saw Rebecca surrounded by the women she'd rescued,
		all laughing and giggling. Although she couldn't see her friend, Josie did see the almost
		empty bottle being passed around. She had no doubt that Rebecca was drunk. The gunslinger
		took a deep breath before walking over to them.</p>

		<p>"Where ya going?" Stacey asked the slightly swaying
		Victoria, who had a firm grip on Rebecca's shoulder to keep herself from falling.</p>

		<p>"I gotta pee," she said, her eyes closing for a moment
		as she fought to keep her balance.</p>

		<p>"Ooh, me too," Rebecca said as she got to her feet a
		little too quickly and lost her balance. She unceremoniously flopped back down to the
		ground, taking Victoria woman with her, a feat that she found incredibly funny. The crowd
		of drunken prostitutes around her parted as the imposing gunslinger made her way through.
		Rebecca looked up, her head feeling twice as heavy as normal, to a not-so-happy pair of
		piercing blue eyes. "Uh...hi Josie," she said before breaking out into another
		giggle fit. Nervous looks were exchanged between the other women as they realized just who
		it was that had rescued them from the saloon, but their sense of fear was eased when they
		saw her squat in front of the drunken blonde and scoop her up gently into her arms.</p>

		<p>"You're drunk," Josie said as she carried her friend
		off to a private area in the nearby brush.</p>

		<p>"Am I?" Rebecca asked in all seriousness. She looked
		around and realized for the first time that she was being carried. "Oh...guess I
		am," she said softly before breaking into giggles again. Her sides hurt from the
		constant laughter. Josie smiled softly.</p>

		<p>"You are. Here we go. I'm going to stand you up now; don't
		fall," she said as she set Rebecca's feet down on the ground. The drunken woman
		wavered for a moment before gripping the gunslinger's upper arm for support. The laughter
		ceased as a new feeling washed over her.</p>

		<p>"Josie, I don't feel good."</p>

		<p>The gunslinger watched the sudden change and recognized it for
		what it was. Without wasting time, she got Rebecca down on her knees and held her hair out
		of her face as the contents of her stomach churned out onto the ground. Josie was aware of
		the small crowd forming behind her. "How much did you give her?" she demanded.</p>

		<p>"Enough," Elaine said.</p>

		<p>"Too much," Stacey corrected with a touch of regret,
		noting the continued nausea that gripped the blonde woman. Josie shook her head in
		annoyance at their reckless actions as she continued to care for Rebecca. She leaned in
		closer and softened the tone of her voice. "You feel better, sprite?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca nodded, but a moment later lurched forward for another
		round. The other women discretely left Josie to care for her friend.</p>

		<p>Rebecca woke in the middle of the night to find a cool cloth on
		her forehead and a concerned Josie sitting next to her. "How ya feeling?"</p>

		<p>"Awful."</p>

		<p>"You should. From what I gather, you drank quite a bit
		tonight." She sighed at the thought of the hangover that would visit her young friend
		in the morning. The green eyes closed once more and Josie allowed herself to relax and lay
		down on her blanket, keeping herself a mere arm's length away from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>Elaine watched the scene from her side of the fire. Although she
		couldn't hear the words exchanged, she knew how long the tall woman had been awake,
		watching over her friend. She remembered the conversation she had with the reclusive
		gunslinger earlier in the day. She never would have suspected the woman in black to be so
		understanding and compassionate toward someone who was simply drunk. Elaine fully expected
		Josie to have yelled at them or worse for getting her friend in such a condition. Yet she
		said not a word to them when she returned to the camp. All she did was help Rebecca into
		her blankets and sit next to her. No one dared to disturb them. There wasn't one of them
		that hadn't heard tales of Josie the train robber. They said she killed at will, sometimes
		just for target practice. Elaine looked over at the couple again. She had no doubts that
		Rebecca would be up during the night, nor did she doubt that the gunslinger would be right
		there to lend assistance if needed.</p>

	<chapter title="27: It's Only Natural">
		<p>Rebecca covered her eyes with her forearm as the bright morning
		sun beat down on her. Her head was pounding so hard she was sure everyone could hear it.
		Her stomach ached, her throat was sore, and she was certain she'd never rid her mouth of
		the foul taste. She felt the soft leather of the canteen press against her elbow.</p>

		<p>"Here," Josie said softly, although to the young woman
		it sounded much louder. Rebecca rolled onto her side, away from the offending sun and
		toward the woman who cared for her the previous night. She propped herself up on one elbow
		and took the offered water. With her eyes still shut tightly, Rebecca rinsed her mouth
		out, then took several long draughts before handing it back to the tall woman in black.</p>

		<p>"I feel awful," she moaned as she rolled onto her back,
		one hand reaching down to cover her aching belly.</p>

		<p>"You should," Josie said. "You were blind
		drunk." Her tone was not condescending, but it wasn't especially pleasant, either.</p>

		<p>"Sorry," Rebecca mumbled as she slowly opened her eyes.
		The gunslinger held out her hand and brusquely helped the young woman to her feet.</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, Rebecca. Just improve."</p>

		<p>The young woman let out an exasperated sigh. "Fine,"
		she said as she turned and headed for the brush. Josie's blue eyes flashed a hint of anger
		as she followed with deliberate steps. The instant they were out of earshot of the rest of
		the group, the gunslinger reached out and grabbed Rebecca by the upper arm, jerking her
		around to face her.</p>

		<p>"You listen to me, Rebecca. I'm not upset that you got
		drunk. It happens." From the look on the young blonde's face she realized the
		strength which she held her and eased up the pressure.</p>

		<p>"Then what?"</p>

		<p>"There's a time and a place for it. In the open with the
		possibility of a posse after us isn't it. What would you have done if something happened?
		By the skies above, girl, you can't even defend yourself," Josie said. She released
		her hold and ran her fingers through her raven hair, waiting for a retort from the young
		woman. Rebecca lowered her eyes for a moment as if lost in thought, then raised her head
		to face the gunslinger. Unsure what to say, the blonde nodded and stepped behind the
		brush. Josie turned and walked back to camp, but her ears still heard the ragged breathing
		that usually preceded sobbing.</p>

		<p>Rebecca returned a short time later, her eyes a bit puffier than
		usual. Without looking at the gunslinger, she headed for the coffeepot and poured a mug
		for both of them. She walked over to Josie and held out the cup as if holding a peace
		offering. The gunslinger took it and nodded her thanks before indicating that the young
		woman should sit down next to her. Stacey and Elaine approached.</p>

		<p>"Josie, we wanted to thank you for rescuing us and to
		apologize for getting Rebecca so drunk last night," Stacey said, her tone conveying
		her remorse. Elaine nodded. The gunslinger waved the apology off.</p>

		<p>"We'll escort you to Truth or Consequences. If we follow the
		river, we'll be there in less than a week," Josie said as she stood up and headed to
		her own wagon. Rebecca tossed the remainder of their coffee into the dying fire and
		quickly followed. Within a half-hour, the two wagons started their trek westward along the
		Rio Grande. Elaine and Victoria rode with Rebecca while Stacey and the others rode in the
		larger wagon. Josie rode further ahead on Phoenix, her eyes constantly searching the area
		for any sign of trouble. Elaine held Flossy's reins while Rebecca and Victoria rode in the
		back, using the short sides of the wagon as a backrest.</p>

		<p>"...so I moved to Rosewood," Victoria said, finishing
		her tale. She took the offered canteen from Rebecca and took a deep swallow. "So how
		about you? How'd you end up like this? Away from yer family and all." </p>

		<p>"I ran away," she replied, her gaze fixed on a knot in
		the wood on the other side of the wagon. There was a long pause before the blonde woman
		spoke again. "How did you...?"</p>

		<p>"Become a whore?" Victoria offered. Rebecca smiled, a
		bit embarrassed that she was even asking the question, and nodded. The brown headed woman
		took another sip of water and leaned her head back against the top of the wooden side of
		the wagon. "Well, I told ya that me daddy died. I had to feed myself someway."</p>

		<p>"What will you do now?"</p>

		<p>She shrugged as if to say there really wasn't much choice.
		"Prob'ly find me another whorehouse to work in."</p>

		<p>"But you have another chance!" Rebecca exclaimed.
		"You can do something else."</p>

		<p>"The only thing I'm good at is spreading my legs for men,
		Rebecca. I got no other skills." Victoria looked at her new friend and went on,
		"You're the lucky one. You got that big one to watch out for you. You'll be all
		right."</p>

		<p>Rebecca didn't know what to say. She knew she was lucky to be
		able to read and write and that she'd be dead by now without Josie. But she was still
		afraid that the gunslinger would grow tired of her being around and just leave her
		someplace. Shaking her head as if to clear the negative thoughts, she decided it was time
		to change the subject. An impish grin came to her face as she turned and whispered to
		Victoria, not wanting Elaine to overhear. Of course the older prostitute wasn't paying a
		bit of attention to the two young women in the back of the wagon. "What's it
		like?"</p>

		<p>"What?" Victoria replied. Rebecca turned a light shade
		of pink.</p>

		<p>"You know..." she looked down at her boots, totally
		embarrassed to ask. "...sex."</p>

		<p>The laughter that boomed from Victoria caused Elaine to turn
		around to see what was going on. From the wagon following, Stacey shook her head as if to
		say 'I don't know.' Elaine smiled and shook her head before turning around and paying
		attention to where she was going. Up in the distance, Josie kept Phoenix at a steady pace,
		never allowing herself to get too far ahead of the wagons.</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew without anyone telling her that her ears were bright
		red from embarrassment. "Shh," she hissed, poking the prostitute in the ribs.
		Victoria snorted and fought to bring herself under control again.</p>

		<p>"Heh heh, sorry, Rebecca," she said. "It's just
		that I ain't used to people not knowing about it."</p>

		<p>"I know what it is, Victoria," she hissed. "I just
		don't know what it's...like." Her cheeks became flushed again as her friend let loose
		another round of laughter.</p>

		<p>"I knew you was pure-like."</p>

		<p>"Will you stop?" Rebecca asked through gritted teeth as
		she looked around to make sure the others hadn't heard. If Elaine heard, she made no
		indication of it and Stacey's wagon was too far away, the noise of the wagons moving along
		making it impossible for her to hear what was making the young blonde so red.</p>

		<p>"Well..." Victoria said after she calmed down and took
		a swig of water. "...it depends."</p>

		<p>"Depends on what?"</p>

		<p>"Depends on who you do it with. Most men don't care about
		ya, so it's mostly boring. If ya want it done right, ya gotta count on rosy palm and her
		five friends," Victoria said as she held her hand out in front of her as if
		inspecting her fingernails.</p>

		<p>"Who are they?" Rebecca asked innocently, sending her
		friend into a bout of laughter and mirth so bad that tears were streaming down her cheeks
		before she could stop. Elaine turned to look at them. Victoria was holding her sides from
		laughing so hard and the poor blonde was scowling. "What is so damn funny?" she
		said, annoyed. "All I did was ask who Rosy Palm and her friends were." With the
		wagons stopped, all the women heard what was said and Rebecca found herself surrounded by
		hysterical women.</p>

		<p>"Ask Josie," Stacey called to the wagon in front.
		"I'm sure she knows exactly who they are."</p>

		<p>Josie looked back at the stopped wagons. There was no obvious
		sign of danger and no one exited either wagon so it couldn't have been a relief stop. She
		moved Phoenix closer and heard the peals of laughter. 'Great,' she thought as she rolled
		her eyes. The gunslinger let the horse nibble on the sparse grass for a few moments while
		she waited for the wagons to start moving again. Just as she started to head for them,
		Elaine snapped the reins and Flossy started moving again, most of the women having
		regained their composure. Rebecca quickly changed the subject to something she knew about
		while Stacey took pity on her and held her wagon back a bit, putting some distance between
		the blonde and the women who were still playfully ribbing her about asking the tall
		gunslinger who rosy and her friends were.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>When they stopped for a break, Josie took the opportunity to
		scout ahead, resting Phoenix further along the trail while waiting for them to catch up.
		Rebecca entertained the women with a story while they ate and soon everyone forgot about
		the question the blonde woman had for the gunslinger. The routine repeated itself at every
		break with Josie remaining far away until they finally stopped for the night. The sun was
		a bright orange in the lower western sky when the wagons were unpacked and camp was set up
		while Josie and two other women went to the river to catch some fish. The gunslinger used
		her knives, throwing them with deadly accuracy as she pinned one fish after another to the
		sandy riverbed before scooping them up and tossing them on the bank for the others to
		clean. One of the girls found some wild scallions growing on the edge of the river and
		quickly harvested them for the evening meal.</p>

		<p>Rebecca decided to wait and ask Josie after dinner. The
		gunslinger always seemed more relaxed after a good meal. Night had fallen and only the
		warm glow of the fire gave them any light. Josie tossed another log on the fire and
		settled back against the wagon wheel, mug of coffee in hand. Rebecca poured herself some
		and sat down next to her. "Josie, can I ask you a question?"</p>

		<p>"You just did," she replied as she brought the cup to
		her mouth.</p>

		<p>"Do you know who Rosy Palm and her five friends are?"</p>

		<p>Coffee sprayed from Josie's mouth, dribbling down her chin to
		soak her neck and shirt with the hot liquid as she looked at Rebecca in astonishment at
		the question. Howls of laughter were heard around the camp as the other women realized
		what had happened. The gunslinger leveled a stern gaze at them that although diminished by
		the lack of light, still managed to quiet the group down. She grabbed Rebecca by the wrist
		and pulled her to her feet, forcing her to follow her until they were out of earshot.</p>

		<p>Once Josie was certain they wouldn't be overheard, she stopped
		and released her grip on her friend's wrist. She kept her back to Rebecca. "What did
		they say to you?"</p>

		<p>"Well...I asked Victoria...um...about sex." She was
		beginning to seriously regret having asked the woman about the subject. "And she said
		that only those people knew how to do it right." There was a long pause before
		Rebecca spoke again. "Josie, do you know who they are?" She watched as the
		gunslinger scratched her head while obviously trying to find the right words to explain.
		She turned around and grabbed the blonde woman's wrist, turning the hand around.</p>

		<p>"You see this?" she asked, describing a wide circle
		with her finger in the middle of Rebecca's hand. "This is rosy palm, and
		these...." Josie pointed to her fingers and let her voice trail off as a look of
		almost comprehension came into the younger woman's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Oh," Rebecca said quietly, still not quite
		understanding. She wiggled her fingers and thought about what Victoria had said. It
		finally came to her just what they were suggesting Rosy's "friends" do, and
		Rebecca's eyes grew wide. "Oh!" she exclaimed.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's a natural thing. Everyone does it," she
		said, although she found herself unable to meet the eyes of her friend. "We just
		don't talk about it," she added.</p>

		<p>"Well...um...I see...okay, thanks for explaining that."
		She turned and started to walk briskly back to camp. It took only a few strides of the
		gunslingers longer, more powerful legs to catch up to her.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca," she said softly, turning her around to face
		her. "You don't have to be embarrassed about this."</p>

		<p>"W-we didn't talk about things like...like that."</p>

		<p>Josie put her hands on the younger woman's shoulders and gently
		squeezed. "Rebecca, listen to me. Nothing that feels that good can be that bad."
		She let go and took a step back, her face betraying no emotions. "We need to get back
		to camp," she said firmly, ending the discussion.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger was settled quite nicely into her blankets when
		Rebecca scooted up next to her and whispered in her ear. "Do you?"</p>

		<p>"Do I what?" the half-awake woman mumbled before
		realizing what she meant. "Oh, sometimes," she said matter-of-factly. "Go
		to sleep, Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Sorry, good night."</p>

		<p>"'Night."</p>

		<p>"Sorry."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." The gunslinger whispered in a low warning
		tone. The blonde quietly moved away and the only sound to be heard was the crackling of
		the banked fire and the soft snickers of the eavesdroppers to the conversation.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="28: Making Friends">
		<p>All the next morning Rebecca had a six-foot shadow. Once the
		gunslinger realized that all the laughter the previous day was at her friend's expense,
		she refused to leave her alone with the more worldly women. Despite her lack of education,
		Victoria understood the tall woman's actions and the reason why. Josie tossed the metal
		coffee mug into the back of their wagon and reached for Phoenix's saddle. "Let's try
		not to wake up the dead with all the noise today," she said firmly. The gunslinger
		made eye contact with each one of them, silently conveying a different message, one that
		was easily understood - no picking on her young friend.</p>

		<p>The next three days passed quickly. The small caravan continued
		its trek westward until the river took a turn north. The breaks were less frequent as the
		women adjusted to the long ride and required fewer stops to rest. Rebecca and Victoria
		continued to ride in the back of the first wagon, although the conversation never went
		anywhere near the subject that embarrassed the blonde so much. Only Josie noticed the
		recent horse tracks that indicated another rider had passed this way recently. She
		shortened the distance between her and the wagons. Their route took them through a small
		canyon full of blind turns and twists, all of which served to heighten the gunslinger's
		anxiety. She quietly removed her remaining gun from its holster, wishing now that she had
		not given the other to Stacey and the shotgun to Elaine to protect the wagons.</p>

		<p>The short hairs on the back of Josie's neck prickled, but it was
		too late. Three riders appeared in the path ahead, all fully armed and aiming straight at
		them. Her blue eyes narrowed when she realized that the leader was none other than Lefty
		Brown, the man she wanted to capture back in Rosewood. She pulled Phoenix to a stop, her
		mind calculating whether she could get all three of them before they managed to get a shot
		off. A commotion behind her caused the gunslinger to turn in the saddle. Two more men
		appeared from behind them, their shotguns pointed at the women in the rear wagon. Lefty
		laughed, showing a mouth of crooked yellow teeth. "Well, well...lookie what we found,
		boys." His brown eyes locked on the gun in Josie's hand. He moved his horse forward
		and disarmed the tall woman who offered no resistance. From the clothing, he assumed her
		to be the leader of the group and thus, the most dangerous. With a vicious laugh, he
		landed the butt of his gun against her temple, sending the gunslinger pitching forward
		into blackness.</p>

		<p>The small adobe structure served as the gang's hideout. There was
		no roof to block the sun and draperies hung on ropes strung about served to separate the
		area into two rooms. The nine women were against one wall, pieces of rope keeping their
		hands behind their backs. The unconscious Josie was in the corner, her temple purple from
		the force of the blow. Lefty turned the bowie knife he had taken from the gunslinger's
		boot over and over in his hand, admiring the quality for a moment before turning his
		attention to something else he admired. "Hey Johnny, you picked one out yet?" he
		called to the short, squat man kneeling in front of the women.</p>

		<p>"Oh hell, Lefty, you know they're all the same at the
		bottom," he replied, reaching out with a grimy paw to squeeze the redhead's breast.
		Stacey closed her eyes, knowing there was no way to avoid the inevitable as Johnny pulled
		her roughly to her feet. As they headed to the other side of the curtain, she put her mind
		into a working mode, pretending that this was just another paying customer instead of a
		man intent on raping her. One by one the other men stepped forward and chose their
		pleasures. The women went without protest, knowing from experience that it was of no use.
		As Elaine was being led away, she swore that they would all pay if any of her girls got
		hurt.</p>

		<p>Victoria and Rebecca were sitting next to each other, the
		remaining two women several feet away. The gunslinger still had not stirred, heightening
		Rebecca's fear as Lefty moved forward and squatted in front of the two young women. It
		took all of her control not to cry or whimper when he reached forward and slowly ran the
		point of the blade across her right breast, not deep enough to cut, but firm enough to
		make his intentions clear. Victoria found her voice. "Sassy, did you get rid of that
		itch yet?"</p>

		<p>It took only a second for Rebecca to understand what her friend
		was doing. "Uh...no. Doc says I need a cream or something," she replied,
		squirming slightly as if trying to ease the imaginary discomfort between her legs. The
		blade retreated as Lefty backed away from her. He didn't know if the bitches were lying or
		not but he had no intention of finding out. The little blonde wasn't worth it.</p>

		<p>"Looks like yer it, sweet thing," he said as he turned
		his attentions to the Victoria.</p>

		<p>Josie listened to the exchange with her eyes still closed to
		feign unconsciousness as her fingers worked to slip under her belt, finding the small slit
		that hid the secret compartment. With dexterity born out of practice, she released the
		small knife from its hiding place and sliced through the ropes soundlessly. The ropes fell
		loosely to the ground behind her as she gripped the tip of the blade between her right
		thumb and forefinger. The blue eyes opened and focused as she brought her arm around. With
		a flick of the wrist, she sent the small blade through the air with blinding speed and
		force, imbedding it deep into Lefty's neck, severing his jugular as well as his windpipe.
		In an instant she was upon him, taking the bowie knife from his hand and imbedding it deep
		into his chest. She took just a second to look at Rebecca before removing the weapon from
		his lifeless body. Josie cut the bonds that held the young women and retrieved her
		revolvers. Without a sound, she slipped between the curtains. Four shots rang out; the
		proximity hurt Rebecca's ears.</p>

		<p>Elaine looked down at the man lying dead at her feet. Looking
		around, she saw Josie helping Stacey roll the dead man off her while the other two women
		ran from the room. The gunslinger didn't see the man slowly rising to his feet blood
		covering the front of his filthy shirt, as he brought his gun up, his dying energy spent
		trying to aim. Elaine reached down and grabbed the gun from the holster of the dead man at
		her feet and fired. Josie's head snapped around to see and her blue eyes locked with the
		hazel eyes of the prostitute. Both nodded slightly in silent appreciation of the other.</p>

		<p>The women assembled in the larger room. Victoria had taken the
		knife from Lefty's throat and used it to free the other two women. Rebecca never moved
		from her position except to draw her knees up and bury her head in her arms as her body
		shook. Josie knelt down next to her, uncertain of what to say. The young woman sensed her
		presence and flung herself against the gunslinger with enough force to knock the older
		woman back on her rear. The events and emotions caught up with Rebecca as she wrapped her
		arms around Josie's neck and sobbed. Part of the tears were for her, for how close she had
		come to being raped, but the other part was for her new friends, and how they were.
		Prostitutes or not, they were still women taken against their will and Rebecca couldn't
		stop herself from crying.</p>

		<p>Josie was clearly uncomfortable with the outpouring of emotions,
		but made no effort to extricate herself from her friend, instead placing a stiff arm
		against Rebecca's back and squeezing slightly. She waited a couple of minutes for the
		young woman's breathing to calm down before she moved her arm and stiffened her back,
		silently indicating the end of the embrace. Rebecca sniffled and sat back, wiping her eyes
		with the sleeves of her shirt. Josie looked over at Elaine, silently pleading for help.
		The black headed woman understood and whispered something in Victoria's ear. The young
		woman went over and sat cross-legged next to Rebecca and put her hand on her shoulder.
		Elaine followed and stood behind them, facing the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Can you help me get the bodies on the wagon?"</p>

		<p>"I guess we'd better," Josie said and rose a little too
		enthusiastically, grateful for the excuse to get away. Victoria spoke quietly with Rebecca
		for several minutes before she was assured that everything was fine.</p>

		<p>The dead men were piled into the back of the whore's wagon while
		the women sat either in the back of the lead wagon or rode the men's horses. They used a
		piece of canvas found at the hideout to cover the bodies to keep the sun from rotting them
		any quicker than necessary as well as to keep the buzzards away. The gunslinger pushed the
		group hard, wanting to get to town as soon as possible. It was close to nightfall when
		they saw the first signs of Laramie. A collective sigh of relief was heard when Josie
		pulled the group to a stop a mile outside of town. She pulled Phoenix alongside the lead
		wagon. "We need to bring the bodies to the marshal. Elaine, you come with me. The
		others stay here," she leveled her gaze at Rebecca to make certain she was
		understood. Seeing her nod in assent, Josie looked over the rest of the group. "You
		might as well set up camp; I don't think we'll be back before morning."</p>

		<p>Josie stopped the wagon in front of the jail and handed the reins
		to Elaine before getting out. She entered the building and returned a few minutes later
		with a stack of wanted posters and the marshal. He held a lantern up near the faces of the
		dead men. "Well, looks like Lefty, all right," he said, double checking his
		information on the wanted poster. "Them others look familiar too. Lemme see." He
		took the pile of posters from Josie and shuffled through them, pulling out the ones that
		seemed to be possibilities. Within an hour, they had identified three of the men as being
		wanted with the total sum running just over one hundred dollars. The gunslinger was a bit
		disappointed in the bounty, but said nothing as she followed the marshal and the wagon to
		the undertaker's place on the edge of town. Once their business was done, Josie made
		arrangements with the marshal to meet her at the bank in the morning while Elaine took the
		horses and wagon to the stable.</p>

		<p>Josie had just enough money to get a small room in the flophouse
		after paying for the stable and a few drinks in the saloon. The room was lit with one
		small lantern, casting a dim orange glow throughout the room. "What are you going to
		do now?", Elaine asked as she sat on the edge of the bed. The gunslinger reached down
		and untied the leather straps that held her holsters to her thighs.</p>

		<p>"We'll get the money in the morning and replenish the
		supplies. It'll take a couple of days to get to Cheyenne, and I have a friend there that
		can help." She removed her gun belts and set them on the floor next to the bed before
		sitting down and pulling her boots off.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." Elaine began, not looking at the tall woman
		seated next to her. "I wanted to thank you...for everything." She turned to
		study the gunslinger's profile. As the bounty hunter tucked her boots under the bed,
		Elaine rose and removed her dress to stand before Josie clad only in the thinnest and most
		revealing of slips. "I really want to thank you," she said seductively as she
		moved closer and straddled the gunslinger's hips.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The women finished off the last of their liquor supply while
		Rebecca entertained them with one of her endless supply of stories, occasionally
		pretending to take a sip as the bottle was passed back and forth, but in fact carefully
		avoiding allowing the liquid to run into her mouth. The events of the day faded away as
		several women began to tell raunchy stories and jokes. While the conversation was slightly
		embarrassing to Rebecca, it wasn't as bad as when they first started and she had became
		comfortable enough to laugh with them at some of the jokes. They all settled in early,
		most because of the booze. Rebecca laid her blanket down next to the wagon wheel, apart
		from the others. She had a second blanket that she usually used as a cushion between her
		and the hard earth, but realized that the others didn't have true blankets. They used
		saddle blankets taken from the horses at the end of the day and some had no blankets at
		all. She took her spare blanket and both of Josie's and passed them out for the others to
		use.</p>

		<p>She rolled up Josie's duster and used it for a pillow as she
		settled down onto the firm earth. Time drifted as her thoughts swirled aimlessly before
		settling on one thought. Rebecca opened one eye and looked about. The others were in
		various stages of sleeping and paid no attention to her. She nervously brought her hand
		under the blanket and unbuttoned most of her shirt. Slowly, her hand crept beneath the
		cotton material and her fingertips fluttered across her nipple, making the coral skin
		harden and contract to a point. Her fingers splayed out as she rubbed her palm across the
		tip before squeezing the whole mound firmly. She brought her other hand under the cover,
		giving both breasts equal attention. In her mind, she saw the knight ravishing the
		princess, with him still in his suit of armor, his face hidden. Her thumb and forefingers
		captured her hard nipples, rolling and pinching them as she arched into her own touch. Her
		breathing quickened as she continued to pleasure her breasts and the heat increased
		between her legs.</p>

		<p>Oh so slowly she lowered her right hand down and unbuttoned her
		britches, her left hand never easing up on its assault of her nipple. She reached in
		beneath her under-drawers and let her fingers comb through her soft blonde curls. She let
		out a soft sigh as her fingertips touched the soaking ringlets. The tight britches denied
		her access to her most private area. Reluctantly, she brought her left hand down to help
		and pushed the clothes off of her hips and down until she could spread her knees apart.
		Rebecca lifted one knee up and braced her leg against the wagon wheel as her hand made its
		way between her thighs. She was surprised to find how wet and slick her thighs were until
		she touched her swollen outer folds and felt the flood soak her fingers. She pressed
		against herself, the palm rubbing back and forth against her aching sex. Her middle finger
		slipped between the folds and pressed near her opening. Rebecca began a slow exploration
		of herself, her fingertips tracing every fold, discovering what felt nice and what didn't.
		She focused on the image of the knight and princess as her middle and index fingers found
		themselves on either side of her most sensitive spot and squeezed rhythmically. Her breath
		started coming in short gasps and her hips moved of their own volition. She instinctively
		moved her fingers, pressing against the small hood of skin above the hard nub. Her blood
		pounded in her ears as she planted her feet and lifted her hips off the ground, her
		fingers never losing their position or pace as they swirled about. She gritted her teeth
		as time and space blended away and a wave of indescribable pleasure gushed through her
		body. She let out a small cry before falling limply back to the now damp ground.</p>

		<p>Two of the women had been wakened by the sound, but seeing
		nothing amiss, rolled over and went back to sleep. Rebecca lay there, wide-awake, reveling
		in the new sensation. It was a long time before she found the strength to reach down and
		fix her clothing and even that movement caused a small shudder to pass through her. She
		finally got into a sleeping position, a lazy smile never leaving her face. Josie was
		right, she thought. Nothing that feels this good could possibly be bad.</p>

	<chapter title="29: The Gift">
		<p>Josie left the bank with her small pile of bills. She met Elaine
		at the trading post and spent most of the money getting the vast amount of supplies they
		would need to keep nine women going for the length of the journey. The gunslinger insisted
		on staying away from the smaller towns along the way, as the large group of women would
		most surely be noticed. Even with the two horses, the load in the wagon made for slow
		going. On impulse, Josie went to the Express office and wired money and a telegram on to
		Cheyenne.</p>

		<p>"Ready?" Elaine asked as the gunslinger returned from
		the Express office and climbed up on the wagon. She nodded and took the reins, sending the
		horses into motion. She came to a sudden stop in front of the doctor's office.</p>

		<p>"Stay here, I'll be right back," Josie said as she
		hopped down and entered the small building. She returned a few minutes later with a large,
		heavy, dusty book which she put on the seat between her and Elaine. "Rebecca likes to
		read," was her reply to the curious look she received from the black headed harlot.
		As they rode back to the camp, Elaine noticed that the gunslinger used her new bandanna to
		wipe away the years of built up dust on the large book. By the time they reached the
		others, no one would have known the book had resided on a bottom shelf in a back closet of
		the doctor's office for the last ten years.</p>

		<p>They pulled up and were quickly surrounded by the women,
		excitedly asking about the bounty or looking at the fresh load of supplies. Rebecca
		spotted the small jar of pickles. She was working on the latch that held the Mason jar
		closed when Victoria came over to see what she was up to. They each took a pickle and
		munched happily. Josie came up behind Rebecca and tapped her on the shoulder. "I want
		to show you something."</p>

		<p>They walked over to their wagon. "I bought you
		something," Josie said a bit nervously as she leaned over the edge of the buckboard
		and hefted out the medical text.</p>

		<p>"Oh...oh my," Rebecca exclaimed as she took the book
		from the gunslinger. Even though she knew it was heavy, she wasn't quite prepared for the
		weight and Josie had to make a lightening move to keep it from dropping on the young
		woman's toes. Rebecca opened the book, supporting the spine on the edge of the wagon, and
		flipped through the pages reverently, her fingers running over the lines of text and
		drawings.</p>

		<p>"It's a beginner's medical text," Josie said, stating
		the obvious to the overjoyed blonde. Rebecca set the book back in the wagon and gave the
		gunslinger a huge hug.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much," she gushed as she continued to
		squeeze against Josie. The appreciation was so genuine and the affection so honest that
		the normally stoic bounty hunter smiled and gave Rebecca's shoulders a gentle squeeze.
		When she pulled back, Josie frowned as she saw the tears spilling out from her green eyes.
		She fought the urge to wipe them from the blonde's cheeks. 'I won't get attached to you,
		Rebecca,' she thought to herself, but couldn't stop asking,</p>

		<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

		<p>"It's just that...well no one ever bought me something
		so...so wonderful before," she said as she wiped the tears from her face. "I
		don't know what to say." She looked up at the gunslinger with a smile that could warm
		the coldest of hearts. Josie smiled, but clearly looked uncomfortable. Rebecca realized
		this and gave the gunslinger a gentle squeeze on the forearm. "Thank you,
		Josie."</p>

		<p>"Sure. Glad you like it. I'd better go help get the gear
		unloaded."</p>

		<p>"Uh, yeah, right. Good idea," Rebecca said, the smile
		never leaving her face. As soon as the gunslinger left, she pulled the book out and sat on
		the ground. She didn't move until dinnertime except to turn the page. Had someone paid
		close attention to Josie, they would have noticed her smile every time she looked over at
		the voracious reader.</p>

		<p>Dinner of salt pork and beans was eaten in shifts, as they had
		only the few plates they had taken from the men whose final stupid plan had involved an
		attempted rape of Rebecca. Only a few utensils were purchased since the money was best
		used on meats and supplies. The funds that Josie spent on Rebecca's book kept her from
		getting a keg of ale she'd been looking forward to, but the gunslinger had no regrets.
		Rebecca was still sitting against the wagon with the book in her lap. She was eating and
		reading at the same time, trying to absorb as much as possible before the sun set for the
		evening. Victoria tried to talk to her a couple of times, but the blonde smiled
		apologetically and pointed at the book. Only when the light became so dim that it hurt her
		eyes to read did Rebecca set the book back gingerly in the wagon and join the others.
		Josie sat apart from the rest, leaning against a tree cleaning her guns. She frowned at
		the multitude of fingerprints that littered her Winchester. 'What'd they do, all take
		turns touching it?' she wondered as she ran the oily cloth up and down the barrel.</p>

		<p>For the next several days, the routine stayed the same. Up at
		dawn, ride until noon, rest for a while, ride until almost sunset, and then camp for the
		night. The bumpy ride made it impossible for Rebecca to read so she spent most of her time
		in the back of the wagon with Victoria. The supplies were split between the two wagons
		since the women were now riding the horses taken from the dead men. Josie drove her wagon
		with Phoenix tethered behind while Stacey's wagon brought up the rear with the extra
		horses nestled safely between them. While the gunslinger appreciated the respite from the
		blonde's usual chatter, she found herself listening every so often to the two young women
		talking behind her, smiling when she heard Rebecca tell something funny. Even though the
		blonde became close to the women - Victoria in particular - Josie kept her distance from
		the group whenever possible. Every so often she would exchange a knowing glance at Elaine,
		but never did she approach her. Both understood the reasons why. Repeat performances
		create complications.</p>

		<p>The late summer sun gave way to an unseasonably cold night. The
		fire gave off some heat, but there was no way for all nine women to sleep around it.
		Several of the women coupled off to share body heat and blankets; only Stacey remained
		alone, taking up the fourth side of the fire. Rebecca set hers and Josie's blankets down
		next to the wagon in a heap. "Josie, aren't we sleeping by the fire?" she asked
		as she watched the gunslinger remove the items from the ground and setting them neatly
		back in the wagon.</p>

		<p>"No, there's not enough room. And it'll be warmer up here in
		the back of the wagon than on the ground." She pulled the sheepskin from the seat and
		laid it out in the back and covered it with one of her blankets. Rebecca walked to the
		other side of the wagon and helped to straighten out the covers as they made their
		makeshift bed. Without thinking, she pulled Josie's rolled up duster out of the pile of
		belongings and set it at the head of the blankets. The gunslinger arched an eyebrow and
		looked at her for an explanation.</p>

		<p>"Oh, this? Well, I uh...kinda borrowed it," Rebecca
		said sheepishly. Josie reached out and moved the duster from the blonde's side of the
		wagon to her side.</p>

		<p>"If it's going to be used as a pillow, at least I should be
		the one to use it."</p>

		<p>There was enough room between them for a third person to have fit
		comfortably, yet Josie still felt the young woman shiver. She mentally berated herself for
		not making space for Rebecca at the fire. The gunslinger hadn't counted on the temperature
		dropping quite so much. She moved closer and pressed her body up against the young woman's
		back. "I didn't think it would be this cold," she said apologetically.</p>

		<p>"I didn't say anything," Rebecca said softly, yet her
		body instinctively moved closer to Josie's, craving the body heat.</p>

		<p>"I know. Lift your head," she said, placing part of the
		rolled up duster under Rebecca's head. Their bodies shifted and moved as they adjusted to
		each other. Josie wasn't totally certain she could sleep so close to another person. Even
		during the night with Elaine, she slept on her side of the bed, making certain there was
		space between them. She laid awake for a few moments as one thought continued to race
		through her mind. "Why?"</p>

		<p>"Hmm?", the half-awake blonde responded.</p>

		<p>"Why, Rebecca?" she propped herself up on one elbow and
		looked down at her. "Why didn't you tell me you were so cold?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca rolled onto her back and looked up, the gunslinger's blue
		eyes demanding the truth. "I...I didn't want you to think I couldn't handle one night
		in the cold," she said in a small voice, unsure of what Josie's reaction would be.
		The gunslinger understood the implication behind the words.</p>

		<p>"Roll over." She settled back down and wrapped one long
		arm around the blonde woman's waist. "Don't do that again. And I don't think
		that," she added softly. She felt Rebecca relax against her, soon falling into a deep
		sleep. The gunslinger laid awake a while longer, watching the steady rise and fall of the
		young woman's chest and wondering just what it was about the little sprite that made her
		care so much about her. Years of running and depending on no one but herself had built a
		wall of armor around her heart that no one could penetrate. Josie cared for no one and no
		one cared for her. That was just how it was and she always felt comfortable with that
		fact. Then came Rebecca; in a mere three months she had managed to make the gunslinger
		care for her, enough to give up her own personal pleasures for the sake of a smile.
		"My friend," she whispered to the sleeping form in front of her. Josie allowed
		herself to relax and be lulled to sleep by the blonde's gentle snoring.</p>

		<p>Unlike the previous nights, there were no nightmares to disturb
		the gunslinger's sleep. She had been grateful that Elaine slept deeply and wasn't wakened
		by her tossing about the night before. It was a well-rested and refreshed Josie that faced
		the morning.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="30: Called Out">
		<p>Several miles from Cheyenne the group came upon a covered wagon
		all but blocking the road and preventing them from passing. A large blonde woman with deep
		green eyes sat patiently on the seat. A small scar faced man sat next to her, holding the
		reins. On the ground next to the wagon a cat lay curled up. She was white except for dark
		gray feet, face, and ears. Nervous looks were exchanged between the women as Josie pulled
		the wagon to a stop. "Stay here," she said firmly to Rebecca as she hopped out
		and walked over to the covered wagon.</p>

		<p>The young woman watched the gunslinger, noting the way Josie's
		hands never strayed far from her talking irons as she approached the strangers. Rebecca
		noted that even in the non-confrontational times, Josie felt the need to be on her guard.
		The blonde in the covered wagon climbed down, aided by the gunslinger's strong arms.</p>

		<p>"It's so good to see ya," she said as she wrapped her
		arms around the woman in black.</p>

		<p>"It's good to see you too, Sandy," Josie replied,
		taking a step back from the embrace. She looked up at the small man. "Earl," she
		said with a nod, receiving the same in response.</p>

		<p>"Your wire said that you needed help," Sandy said as
		she walked with Josie back to the caravan.</p>

		<p>"I don't; these women do," the gunslinger replied,
		waving with her arm to indicate the others. Sandy looked from one woman to the next,
		mentally assessing them. Elaine dismounted and walked over to her. The others took that as
		their cue to dismount. Many of them were rubbing their aching thighs and rears from the
		long ride. Rebecca climbed down and stood just behind Josie, close enough to hear the
		conversations without being in the way.</p>

		<p>After brief introductions, they settled down to business. "I
		have room for five women, but if necessary, I can probably find positions for the others
		at one of the other houses," Sandy said. Her eyes locked on the small blonde standing
		behind the gunslinger. "I don't know about this one, Josie. She looks a little too
		innocent. Reminds men of their daughters. A serving girl, perhaps."</p>

		<p>Rebecca's eyes flashed indignantly, but she held her tongue.
		Josie smirked at her friend before turning to face Sandy. "She's with me."</p>

		<p>"Didn't think you went for the young ones, Josie,"
		Sandy quipped, drawing a confused look from Rebecca and a warning glare from the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Can we get going?" Josie asked, but it was more of a
		statement.</p>

		<p>"Yes, of course." Sandy turned her attention to the
		prostitutes. "I don't want to be seen bringing all of you into town. You'll have to
		hide in the back of my wagon."</p>

		<p>One by one the women were put in the safety of the covered wagon.
		Only Josie, Rebecca, Stacey, and Elaine remained behind to deal with the horses and
		wagons. Sandy scooped up the purring feline and climbed back up into the seat on her
		wagon. The short man snapped the reins and set the horses into motion, turning in a wide
		arc to head back into town. Josie waited a few minutes before indicating that everyone
		should mount up.</p>

		<p>"What's going on?" Rebecca asked once they were settled
		back on the sheepskin covered seat. Josie slapped the reins on her flanks to get Flossy
		going before answering.</p>

		<p>"Sandy operates the largest whorehouse in Cheyenne. She'll
		take care of them, give them jobs."</p>

		<p>"But why hide them in the back of the wagon?"</p>

		<p>"Can you imagine what would happen if people see a half
		dozen whores suddenly show up in town? Sandy will slip them in through a back entrance. In
		time no one will realize that they weren't there before," although it seemed
		perfectly clear to her, Josie didn't seem to mind explaining everything to her young
		friend. "We'll enter separately and get a room at the boarding house."</p>

		<p>Seeing that Rebecca was satisfied with her explanation, Josie
		concentrated on guiding Flossy to the livery stable with Elaine following on her horse,
		leading one of the riderless mares. Stacey brought up the rear as usual, the remaining
		horses tethered to the back of her wagon. A heated discussion occurred at the livery
		between the gunslinger and the stable owner over the price. Rebecca was certain that Josie
		was at the point of handling the situation with her irons when she stepped in, smiling
		pleasantly.</p>

		<p>"Sir, you see these fine pieces of horseflesh?" she
		indicated the small string of horses. "What are they worth to you?" He rubbed
		the stubble on his chin as his mind worked feverishly to come up with a price.</p>

		<p>"Best I can do is one hundred dollars for the whole lot,
		including the wagons."</p>

		<p>"What!" Josie said loudly, pushing Rebecca gently out
		of the way so she could tower over the man.</p>

		<p>"Uh...er...I mean...."</p>

		<p>"You mean that two hundred for the horses alone is a fair
		price. That also includes stabling the others and storing the wagons." Her deep blue
		eyes dared him to argue.</p>

		<p>"Uh...yeah," he said, defeated.</p>

		<p>"I could have gotten a better price for the horses, you
		know," Rebecca said as they walked to the saloon. Stacey and Elaine walked behind
		them, exchanging amused glances as the young woman made the statement for the third time
		in as many minutes. As before, Josie chose to simply ignore the comment. Rebecca let out
		an exasperated huff and scowled. "If you would have just been patient."</p>

		<p>"I didn't feel like waiting an hour for the two of you to
		haggle," Josie replied matter-of-factly as they reached the saloon. The scowl was
		replaced with a look of hurt, reaching straight into the gunslinger's heart and filling
		her with guilt. She looked back at the others. "You two go on ahead. Sandy will be
		waiting for you. We'll be along."</p>

		<p>Stacey and Elaine nodded, understanding the two women's need to
		have a moment of privacy. Josie pulled Rebecca away from the swinging doors and out of
		sight of the other women. "Rebecca, I'm sorry I didn't want to wait. I have no doubt
		that you could have talked him up on the price. Next time I'll be more patient." She
		managed to get the words out without choking on them. Apologizing was something that the
		gunslinger just didn't do. But looking at the hurt in Rebecca's eyes and knowing that she
		was the cause was more than she could bear. She would have said anything to see a smile on
		that sweet young face. </p>

		<p>"Come on, you can make it up to me with dinner in that nice
		restaurant I saw as we entered town," Rebecca said, forcing a smile to her face to
		show the gunslinger she wasn't upset at her anymore. The comment Josie made about the next
		time made the young woman's heart fill with hope. It was the first time the bounty hunter
		had spoken to her as though they would be together in the future.</p>

		<p>"Deal," Josie said, showing a smile full of teeth.
		"I need a drink. Let's go."</p>

		<p>The saloon was typical of a large city. The long bar covered the
		left wall while the right wall contained a small stage and piano. Straight-ahead was the
		white staircase that led to the pleasures upstairs. Scattered about were several round
		tables, mostly empty as the men were still working in the mines or fields. A large
		chandelier hung auspiciously in the center of the room, the intricate design clearly out
		of place in the dusty tavern. The light from the multitude of candles reflected through
		the teardrop shaped pieces of lead glass, casting a soft glow on the room. Josie looked
		around and noted that the women were all upstairs. The parched feeling in her throat
		helped her make her decision. "We're going to have a drink first, then we'll go check
		on everyone," she said, knowing that Rebecca would want to see how Victoria was
		doing.</p>

		<p>"Okay," Rebecca agreed. Her mouth was as hot and dry as
		the gunslingers. They moseyed up to the bar and sat down on adjacent stools. As the
		bartender approached, Rebecca felt Josie press a dollar bill into her hand under the edge
		of the bar. The gunslinger kept her eyes on the bartender and acted as if nothing had
		happened.</p>

		<p>"Whiskey," Josie said firmly. "And an ale."</p>

		<p>"Sarsaparilla," Rebecca added. The gunslinger watched
		out of the corner of her eye as the young woman paid for the drinks with the bill she had
		been given. Although Josie's face showed no signs as to her thoughts, inside she was
		smiling at the look of pride on Rebecca's face.</p>

		<p>They were on their second round of drinks when a large boar of a
		man entered, flanked by two smaller but equally evil looking men. Josie watched them
		through the mirror behind the bar as they looked around the saloon. The bartender
		nonchalantly pulled on a rope that extended through the ceiling to a bell upstairs. The
		men took up residence two stools down from the bounty hunter. Within minutes, Sandy came
		down the stairs with Bobo bounding down after her. She fixed the largest of the newcomers
		with a glare and hissed at him.</p>

		<p>"Felix! I told you to stay out of here," she said as
		she approached the corner of the bar, making sure she was out of arm's reach.</p>

		<p>"Now Miss Sandy, you know what happened was an
		accident," he said as if it were true, sending the men with him into laughter.
		"I was just havin a bit 'o fun."</p>

		<p>"Your bit of fun cost me one of my best girls," she
		snarled. "Now you get out of here. None of the girls want anything to do with
		you."</p>

		<p>Felix moved off of his stool slowly, the look on his face
		menacing as he took a step closer to the madam. "She said for you to leave,"
		Josie said firmly, her attention seeming to never leave the glass in front of her. Felix
		stopped his advance and turned to look at the woman in black.</p>

		<p>"You got somethin' to say, woman?" he said, the last
		word spoken more as an insult. "Try usin' yer talking irons."</p>

		<p>"You calling me out?" she replied as she downed the
		last of her ale. Rebecca's eyes grew wide as she followed the route of the conversation.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." she hissed, pulling on the gunslinger's
		forearm to get her attention. "What are you doing?" Josie slid off the stool
		gracefully, her imposing frame towering over the smaller woman.</p>

		<p>"Go with Sandy...now," she said in a tone that brooked
		no arguments. Josie walked to the door, deliberately keeping her gaze away from the young
		woman's face. Sandy walked past the men and put her arm around Rebecca's shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Come on, child. This is no place for you right now,"
		she said as the men followed the gunslinger outside, joking and slapping Felix on the back
		in anticipation of his victory.</p>

		<p>"No!" Rebecca yelped, wrenching herself from the older
		woman's grasp. Sandy quickly recovered and wrapped both arms around the smaller woman's
		waist, pinning her arms. Jon, the bartender, frantically pulled on the rope, getting the
		attention of the women upstairs. Elaine was the first to arrive, skipping half the steps
		in her haste.</p>

		<p>"Child, please, Josie doesn't want you out there,"
		Sandy said, trying to get the squirming woman to understand. Elaine assessed the situation
		quickly and went to the doorway. In the middle of the street, Josie and Felix stood paces
		apart, paying no attention to the rapidly growing crowd of spectators. An enterprising man
		with a short black goatee was taking bets on the outcome, favoring the man with the
		bandoleers over the tall woman. Rebecca worked her way free by relaxing her leg muscles,
		sinking out of the madam's grasp. Elaine grabbed her at the doorway.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, don't you understand? Whatever happened, she can't
		back down now," Elaine said and then watched as a flicker of understanding appeared
		in the green eyes. She lowered her tone. "If you go out there, you'll only distract
		her. You don't want that, do you?"</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca said softly. It was obvious that the
		young woman was terrified for the gunslinger and very near the point of tears.</p>

		<p>"You don't need to watch this," the black headed woman
		offered. Rebecca sniffled and cleared her throat, straightening her back and raising her
		chin.</p>

		<p>"Yes I do," she said firmly. Elaine nodded and stepped
		to the side to make room for her to see out the doorway. Victoria came up behind them and
		put her hand on Rebecca's shoulder, squeezing softly.</p>

		<p>Josie's fingers twitched, flexing and relaxing in anticipation.
		She watched his movements carefully. He seemed relaxed and assured, as if no one could
		draw faster than him, let alone a woman. He reached for his gun, his fingers closing
		around the familiar piece of steel. He only got as far as pulling it out of his holster
		when his chest took the impact of Josie's bullet. It was over in the blink of an eye. The
		gunslinger stood there, smoking gun drawn, looking at the mortally wounded man slumping
		forward. His face registered his profound surprise as he pitched forward, dead before he
		hit the ground. For a moment no one moved except for the man with the goatee, who decided
		that sticking around wasn't such a good idea. Josie holstered her weapon as Felix's
		friends dragged his body off the street. The marshal waited for her at the doors to the
		saloon.</p>

		<p>"Nice shooting," he commented as she passed. Her face
		was an unreadable mask.</p>

		<p>"I did what I had to do. He called me out." She pushed
		her way through the doors and was quickly hugged by an emotional Rebecca. Josie stiffened
		and pulled back, giving the young woman a quick squeeze on her upper arms. In a tone that
		only Rebecca could hear, she said. "I'm okay, sprite."</p>

		<p>The barkeep set the bottle of whiskey and a fresh glass of ale on
		the counter in front of Josie. Sandy moved over and spoke quietly with the marshal.
		Rebecca felt the last of her reserves waning and raced out of the saloon, Victoria at her
		heels. Josie looked at the retreating form, debating about whether to follow her or not.</p>

		<p>"Let her go," Elaine said from just behind the
		gunslinger. Josie turned to look at her. "She was pretty upset. Hasn't she seen you
		kill before?", she asked as she led the bounty hunter back to the bar. Josie downed
		the shot of whiskey and drained half of her glass of ale before answering.</p>

		<p>"Not like that. She's never seen me called out before."
		Josie stared into the amber liquid, suddenly feeling very empty. Elaine recognized the
		look; she'd seen it on the faces of countless men over the years.</p>

		<p>"Josie...." she said softly, running a fingernail up
		the length of the powerful forearm. For a brief moment the thought of drowning herself in
		the throes of carnal pleasure appealed to the gunslinger, but only for a brief moment. She
		stood up.</p>

		<p>"I'd better go find Rebecca," she said, politely
		refusing the offer. Elaine gave a little smile of understanding.</p>

		<p>"I'll be here if you need me, Josie. You're
		welcome...anytime," the last word said in an unmistakable tone of invitation. The
		black headed woman turned and went up the stairs, giving a most flirtatious smile to the
		barkeep as she passed. It never hurt to get in good with the bartender. It always made for
		the best chance of getting the better clients.</p>

		<p>Rebecca sat on the ground with her back pressed up against the
		back of the building. The alleyway was empty except for her and Victoria. "Why did
		she do it?" she said between tears. "Doesn't she realize how easily she could
		have been killed?"</p>

		<p>"Dunno," Victoria replied. "Suppose she must. Bet
		she'd done it before."</p>

		<p>"Then why? Why take such a chance?" Rebecca said as she
		picked up a small stone and flung it as hard as she could against the building on the
		other side of the alleyway.</p>

		<p>"She's not like you, Rebecca. She a killer, that's fer sure.
		In her blood, ah think. She said he called her out. A killer can't not go then. Looks
		bad," Victoria said, hoping that her words would help, but noticed that the
		expression of anger and fear didn't leave her friend's face. "If she didn't, he'd
		have killed her right there in the saloon."</p>

		<p>"There has to be another way," Rebecca said adamantly.
		"She shouldn't keep putting herself in danger like that. She was out there, right in
		the open. If she wanted to, she could have talked her way out of it."</p>

		<p>"She ain't you, Rebecca. She talks with her guns, not her
		mouth. If you don't accept it, you'd best git away from her 'fore ya git
		yer heart broke."</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched as Victoria stood and headed back to the saloon.
		She remained there for a few minutes more, letting the waves of emotions run their course.
		Josie watched silently from the edge of the alleyway, not moving until she saw the young
		woman wipe the tears from her face and stand up. The gunslinger crossed the remaining
		distance between them. There was a long silence as blue eyes met green, Rebecca's
		unguarded face betraying all of her emotions. Finally she broke the silence.</p>

		<p>"I know why you did it, Josie, but I don't have to like
		it," she said firmly.</p>

		<p>"No, I suppose you don't," the gunslinger agreed.
		"But you also can't get in my way or we could both be killed."</p>

		<p>"Josie, am I your friend?" she asked softly, her eyes
		begging for a response. Josie took a step forward and put her hands on the young woman's
		shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Being my friend will only put you in danger, Rebecca, but
		yes...you are my friend," the gunslinger said firmly, admitting it to both of them.
		For a moment, she allowed herself to feel the tenderness of the moment, the feeling of
		knowing that she wasn't alone anymore, that they were no longer two people traveling
		together, but now something more, something much deeper. Friends. The word echoing through
		her head brought a rare smile to her face. "Come on, friend. Let's mosey over to the
		restaurant and get something for dinner."</p>

		<p>The mention of food paled in significance to 'friend', but
		Rebecca readily agreed to the offer of a warm meal, happy just to be with Josie. As they
		passed the theater, the young woman's eyes lit up at the sign announcing a performance
		later that evening. Then she saw the admission price of four bits per person and the smile
		left her face. The gunslinger noted and smiled to herself, knowing exactly where they
		would be going after dinner.</p>

	<chapter title="31: An Evening Together">
		<p>At Rebecca's insistence, they stopped at the boarding house to
		relieve the gunslinger of some of her weapons. Josie had started to protest, but the young
		woman explained that it was bad enough that her clothes would make people nervous, but a
		pair of deadly revolvers might make the other patrons too scared to eat. While the bounty
		hunter reluctantly acknowledged this fact, she still made a point of carrying her knives
		in their various locations. There was no way she was going to be completely unarmed.</p>

		<p>Josie received a curious, and mostly disgusted look from the
		waitress, but stubbornly waited to be seated. She was not surprised when the short, round
		woman led them to a table in the far corner, near the kitchen and most likely the least
		enjoyable spot in the place. As they made their way, Josie kept her hand resting lightly
		on the small of Rebecca's back, guiding her through the maze of chairs and potted cactus
		that littered the area. A stout man at a nearby table rose and held the chair out for
		Rebecca as they arrived. Josie was pleased by the respectable gesture, as unusual as it
		was in that part of the country, but nonetheless kept her eye on him for any sign of
		trouble. He smiled and returned to his wife and son at his table.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, sir," Rebecca said sweetly as he pushed her
		chair in. He moved over to get Josie's chair but the gunslinger waved him off and pulled
		it out herself. They waited ten minutes for the waitress to pass by and drop off the
		menus. Rebecca thought that Josie was fuming inside as the minutes passed, and then she
		was certain of it from the slight tenseness in the gunslinger's jaw and the almost
		imperceptible narrowing of her eyes. Yet Josie said nothing, merely studying the patterns
		on the utensils or glancing about the room. Rebecca had tried to make small talk, but the
		bounty hunter's attention kept shifting to the other patrons and the young woman gave up.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, what was that?"</p>

		<p>"I said the beef looks good," Rebecca replied, hoping
		to draw Josie's attention back to her and away from the rest of the room. The gunslinger
		gave a quick lopsided grin and looked at the menu for the first time.</p>

		<p>"I have a hankering for the elk. Where is that woman
		anyway?"</p>

		<p>Josie said, looking around the room. As if she could feel the
		blue eyes boring into her back, the waitress turned around from chatting with a patron and
		saw that the two women were ready. The glare she received from the tall one in black
		guaranteed that she would return immediately with their drinks.</p>

		<p>While waiting for their dinner to arrive, Rebecca chatted about
		the new things she had learned from the medical book that the gunslinger had purchased.
		Josie smiled and paid attention, noting that the young woman didn't mention any diseases
		or give any detailed descriptions that might have affected the enjoyment of dinner.
		"You know, Josie, it says that some of the best medicines are known only to the
		Indians." </p>

		<p>"That's true," the gunslinger replied, letting a bit of
		pride show through. "The medicine elders - you call them medicine men - know far more
		about herbs and roots than the white man does."</p>

		<p>"I'll bet I could learn a lot from one of them,"
		Rebecca mused softly. The words did not escape Josie's ears as an idea formed in her mind.
		Perhaps she could take her to the Cherokees, to her people, and let her learn the
		medicines of old. The gunslinger was well aware of the need for good healers.</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you could, Rebecca. Would you like that? To meet a
		real medicine elder and learn from her?" In her mind, the gunslinger was calculating
		just how far they were from the Cherokees, less than three weeks by wagon over the
		Cimarron Crossing. It was more dangerous than the Cheyenne Trail, but was also more
		direct. The trail would take them at least another week to ten days, adding considerably
		to the cost of their supplies.</p>

		<p>"Oh Josie, I'd love to. I could learn so much more than the
		book can teach me," she said enthusiastically. The waitress arrived with the platter
		containing their dinners. Both women were silent while the not-so-nice-smelling woman
		plopped their plates down in front of them.</p>

		<p>"Anything else?" she asked, moving quickly away without
		waiting for an answer. Rebecca reached out and placed her hand on top of the gunslinger's
		fist.</p>

		<p>"Josie...."</p>

		<p>"I'm fine. Just don't care for the likes of her," she
		replied as she relaxed her hand and pulled it out from under the blonde's grasp. She
		sampled a piece of the elk before speaking. "I can take you there." </p>

		<p>"Take me where?" she replied around a mouth full of
		food. </p>

		<p>"To meet a medicine elder. To learn healing." She
		stabbed another piece of meat with her fork. "I can take you to the Cherokees,"
		she said as she popped the morsel in her mouth and began to chew.</p>

		<p>Rebecca's fork stopped halfway to her mouth as she looked across
		the table dumbfounded. Josie smirked and took another bite of food. "Of course if you
		don't want to go..." she said idly, twirling her fork in the air.</p>

		<p>"Yes! Yes, I want to go," the blonde said
		enthusiastically as soon as her voice returned. "Oh Josie, that would be so
		wonderful!" </p>

		<p>"Now hear me out," the gunslinger replied, setting her
		fork down and leaning in to give her most serious expression. "It won't be easy.
		We'll be going through dangerous territory."</p>

		<p>"I don't mind," Rebecca interrupted. Josie gave a quick
		frown.</p>

		<p>"The first thing you have to remember is not to interrupt
		me. </p>

		<p>Next is to pay attention; don't make me tell you something
		twice." She waited until Rebecca nodded solemnly. The gunslinger leaned back in her
		chair and stared at her half-eaten dinner. "Of course, that's only if you're going to
		keep riding with me. Any time we find a town that you think you'd be happy in...."</p>

		<p>She didn't get to finish her thought as Rebecca bolted from her
		chair and gave the seated woman a hug. Josie stiffened noticeably but still managed to put
		a smile on her face for the blonde's sake. "Rebecca, not in public," she hissed
		quietly but gently. The young woman gave one last squeeze before returning to her seat,
		smiling with a glow that melted just a little bit more of the ice surrounding the bounty
		hunter's heart.</p>

		<p>The pair strolled down the street, the warm meal and dessert
		still settling in their bellies. Despite the waitress's surliness, they still managed to
		get two large pieces of pie for dessert, of which Rebecca ate hers and half of the
		gunslingers. Josie deliberately shortened her normally long gait so the shorter woman
		wouldn't have to walk fast to keep up. Truth be told, the bounty hunter was actually
		enjoying the evening. The night air was the perfect temperature; the lights from the
		buildings along with the half moon cast enough light to see easily. There was a gaiety
		about the night as families and couples headed for the theater, all chattering away happily. Men stopped
		to shake hands with each other while the wives exchanged pleasantries and, judging from
		the conspiratorial giggles in some cases, the latest gossip. As they reached their
		destination, Josie noted that the stout, balding man that held Rebecca's chair at the
		restaurant was standing outside the entrance to the theater with what she could only
		assume was his wife and son. The father touched his fingers to the brim of his bowler and
		nodded as the women passed. Rebecca smiled and wished him a good evening, although her
		attention was drawn more to his son, a dapper young man who was most likely only a year or
		two older than her.</p>

		<p>Rebecca went up and down the aisle, pointing out possible seats
		for them but the gunslinger shook her head at each one. None of the available adjoining
		seats were in the aisle. Josie spotted what she decided to be the perfect location, not
		caring that it was already occupied, and headed for it. Her long strides took her there
		quickly and by the time Rebecca caught up, the young men who had been sitting in the
		desired seats were already heading up the aisle, suddenly deciding that the view would be
		much better somewhere else.</p>

		<p>"What did you say to them?" Rebecca asked as she took
		the inside seat. Josie flopped back casually into hers, a knowing smirk on her face. She
		crossed her long legs, placing her booted foot up on her knee with the toes pressed
		against the seat in front of them. </p>

		<p>"I suggested that they be gentlemen-like and offer their
		seats to a couple of women," the gunslinger said with feigned innocence.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh, that's why they hightailed it to the back,
		huh?" the young women replied with a grin. "I can just imagine what you said to
		intimidate them." She leaned over and spoke in hushed tones, as if she wasn't stating
		the obvious. "You are intimidating, you know."</p>

		<p>"Can't be too bad; haven't been able to get rid of you
		yet," Josie quipped without thinking. Rebecca lost her smile and straightened up,
		fixing her gaze on the stage.</p>

		<p>"Do you want to, Josie?" she asked fearfully, not
		daring to look at the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>Her mind raced; the skills and techniques she had used over the
		years to avoid any kind of commitment or responsibility snapped into place as the answer
		came to her. "How can I get rid of you, Rebecca? Even if I tried, you'd probably just
		follow me anyway," she said as she gave the young woman a playful shove on the
		shoulder. Rebecca reacted well, grinning at the tease and settling back in her chair, but
		inside she noted that Josie deliberately avoided answering the question. She thought about
		pursuing the matter, but decided against the possibility of putting a damper on the
		otherwise enjoyable evening. Josie was glad that Rebecca turned her interest to the men
		scurrying about the stage, getting it ready for the performance, rather than in continuing
		the conversation.</p>

		<p>A polite cough drew their attention to the aisle. The man with
		the bowler and his family stood patiently and waited for the gunslinger to sit up and pull
		her long legs in so they could pass. As the young man did so, his leg brushed up against
		Rebecca's knee. He apologized immediately, taking the seat next to her as he did so.</p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry, Miss," he said, his accent clearly that
		of a yankee. "Oh, how rude of me." He wiped his hand on his britches before
		reaching out to grasp Rebecca's hand and placing his lips briefly on the back of her hand.
		"Lance," he said by way of introduction, and looked at her inquiringly.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca," she replied. He kissed the back of her hand
		once more before releasing it.</p>

		<p>"I'm most pleased to make your acquaintance, Miss
		Rebecca."</p>

		<p>Despite his dapper appearance and impeccable manners, he still
		managed to earn a warning glare from the gunslinger. She learned long ago to trust no one,
		especially those who appear to be the trustworthiest. It was nothing compared to his
		mother's look as she reached down and grabbed him by the earlobe. "Lance, I'm sure
		the young lady didn't come to the theater to listen to you all night, talking that sweet
		molasses talk of yours. Now you move over and leave her and her mother alone."</p>

		<p>It was all Rebecca could do not to burst into a fit of laughter.
		Lance was unceremoniously led by his ear to a seat further down while the gunslinger
		glared at his mother's back. The young woman leaned over and whispered in the still fuming
		Josie's ear. "I guess we do make an odd pair of cards, huh?"</p>

		<p>"I do not look old enough to be your mother," Josie
		hissed back, fully insulted. Rebecca chuckled silently and gently tapped the gunslinger's
		leg reassuringly.</p>

		<p>"I know, Josie," she said, trying to sound convincing,
		but her smile remained. The lights were extinguished moments later, leaving only the stage
		visible to the audience. A man stepped on stage to the roar of clapping. Rebecca leaned
		over, her smirk now absolutely mischievous. </p>

		<p>"Are you going to read me a bedtime story, mother?"</p>

		<p>Without taking her eyes off the stage, Josie leaned over until
		her lips were just a hair from the young woman's ear. "Keep it up and you'll be
		sleeping with Flossy, darling daughter," she teased back.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The play was a slapstick comedy about bumbling robbers trying to
		hold up a stagecoach. Josie rolled her eyes when she saw the two robbers prance out on
		stage riding stick horses and wearing lace scarves over their mouths. "It's supposed
		to be funny Josie," Rebecca whispered at the frowning gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh," she said sarcastically as they watched the
		two robbers run into each other and fall down. The rest of the audience laughed
		uproariously. The gunslinger slumped in her seat, doing her best not to look too bored.
		Rebecca was smiling and apparently enjoying the antics on-stage. The stagecoach prop was
		brought on-stage, complete with the 'helpless damsel in distress' riding inside. The
		robbers circled the wagon on their stick horses, yelling at the woman to toss her
		valuables out. Josie straightened up in her seat slightly. "That's not how you rob a
		stage."</p>

		<p>"Oh, that's right. You're the expert," Rebecca teased,
		drawing a smile from the gunslinger as she realized how silly she was being. "That's
		better. Now sit back and enjoy the show."</p>

		<p>"Shh!" Lance's mother hissed at the chatty young woman,
		despite the fact that most of the theater was laughing at the activities on stage. The
		damsel in distress was now out of the stagecoach and running around after the robbers, who
		had given up their stick horses, beating them repeatedly with her bag. At this Josie gave
		a chuckle and relaxed visibly. Within minutes the bounty hunter was laughing along with
		Rebecca, both thoroughly enjoying the show.</p>

		<p>When the show finished, everyone got up at once to leave.
		Unfortunately, the people in the doorway seemed intent on talking to each other and not on
		getting outside. Grumbling and complaints were heard from the men and women waiting to
		leave. Josie leaned over and whispered in Rebecca's ear. "Stay right behind me."
		She put on her most intimidating face and tapped the shoulder of the man in front of her.
		"Move, now."</p>

		<p>"Miss, 'taint no way you gonna get out. That's Charlie up
		there jabbering. He don't never shut up," the man said.</p>

		<p>"You want to get out of here?" Josie said loudly, her
		voice carrying above the din to reach the ears of the frustrated patrons. Several shook
		their heads in the affirmative or yelled "yes" back at her. "Let me
		through. I'll make them move."</p>

		<p>"You? A woman?" a large and rather dangerous looking
		man sneered. Several of his buddies started to laugh until they watched her grab his meaty
		arm and twist it up behind his back, sending him up on his tiptoes.</p>

		<p>"Still think I can't make them move?" she asked
		rhetorically as she released his arm. The patrons moved back to let her through, with
		Rebecca following closely behind. The crowd realized that the tall woman would, in fact,
		get Mouthy Charlie out of the way and started to close up the space behind her, all trying
		to be the first ones out in case a good fight got going. Rebecca reached out and hooked
		her fingers around the top of the gunslinger's belt. Josie turned her head slightly,
		making sure it was her friend that was attached to her before continuing to make her way
		through the crowd.</p>

		<p>"So how's Bertha?"</p>

		<p>"She's doin' fine, yep. Her little doggie be due to birth
		them pups near about anytime now..." Charlie said as he felt a very firm tapping on
		his shoulder. "Go 'round. There's room," he said without looking around. The tap
		changed to a firm poke. "Tarnation, what in blue blazes..." he turned and faced
		the bluest eyes he'd ever seen just as the firm hand that was poking him now took hold of
		a fair amount of his hair.</p>

		<p>"Didn't your mother ever tell you it was rude to block other
		people's way?" she said as she bodily escorted him out of the doorway and into a
		nearby trough. She was rewarded with a chorus of cheers from the crowd as people finally
		made their way out of the theater.</p>

		<p>Rebecca caught up with Josie just as she felt a soft touch on her
		shoulder. The young woman turned to find the dapper young man standing there nervously
		twisting his hat in his hands. "I uh...just wanted to say that it was nice meeting
		you, Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"It was nice meeting you too, Lance," she replied
		shyly, feeling her cheeks warming.</p>

		<p>"Lance! Get over here and stop pestering that young
		girl," his mother called. He quickly grabbed Rebecca's hand and kissed the back of
		it.</p>

		<p>"'Bye,", he said grinning foolishly, and returned to
		his mothers side before she decided to yell again. Rebecca sensed the gunslinger standing
		just behind her.</p>

		<p>"He's nice," she said a little dreamily. Lance turned
		around and waved, smiling even more when she returned the gesture.</p>

		<p>"You ready?" Josie said a bit more harshly than she
		meant to. Her blue eyes stayed on the young man as the family walked further down the
		street. The gunslinger couldn't put her finger on it, but something about him annoyed her.
		He was almost out of sight when Rebecca turned to look at her.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, did you say something?"</p>

		<p>"It's getting late," Josie replied, slightly annoyed at
		being ignored.</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry, Josie. I just..." she gazed at the darkened
		street where moments ago Lance had waved at her. The dreamy look settled on her face
		again. "He's nice," she said softly, apparently unable to describe him any other
		way.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh, let's go." This time the gunslinger started
		walking, her long strides forcing Rebecca to jog to catch up. Only then did she slow down
		to a more reasonable gait.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" the tentative tone made the gunslinger stop
		and turn to look at her. Rebecca looked down at her boots. "Um...are you mad at me
		for something?" she asked softly. The wave of guilt passed over the bounty hunter as
		she realized that she was taking her feelings for the boy out on the blonde. Instantly her
		features softened and she put her hand on Rebecca's shoulder gently.</p>

		<p>"No, I guess I'm still mad at that codger that was blocking
		the door," she moved closer and put her arm lazily around the smaller woman's
		shoulders. "Look up there, Rebecca," she said pointing at the stars that
		twinkled brightly in the clear night. "It's like you can almost reach out and touch
		them."</p>

		<p>"Yes," the young woman replied softly. "They're so
		pretty; the way they sparkle, it's just like little diamonds in the sky." She started
		humming the children's melody to herself and was completely surprised when Josie joined
		in. Rebecca smiled and put her arm around the taller woman's waist, giving her a squeeze.
		The gunslinger returned the gesture of affection before pulling away.</p>

		<p>"Come on, sprite. Let's get back," she said, giving
		Rebecca a friendly smile as they started walking again.</p>

		<p>The cool night breeze fluttered in through the window as both
		women got ready for bed. The moon cast enough light for them to see the bed and barely
		make out each other, so there had been no need to use the lantern. Josie sat down next to
		her on the bed and pulled off her boots, quickly putting them as far away from the bed as
		possible. Rebecca untied the thin bow at the neck of her dress and stood, wiggling her
		arms out of it while turning her back to the gunslinger. She reached down and pushed the
		dress past her hips, letting it slide down to the floor. Josie placed her guns in a
		convenient location near the bed, making a mental note to clean them in the morning. She
		stripped down to her drawers and pulled the covers back on the bed. Rebecca straightened
		out the sleeves on her flannel nightgown and crawled into bed, scooting up against the
		wall to make room for her friend.</p>

		<p>Josie loosely wrapped an arm around Rebecca's waist. "Is
		this all right? There's not much room on the bed..." she said, knowing full well that
		there was plenty of room on the straw filled mattress. Somehow it just felt right to hold
		the little sprite in her arms. Rebecca reached down and patted the strong hand resting on
		her belly.</p>

		<p>"It's fine," she replied, smiling in the darkness. She
		felt so safe and protected in Josie's arms, as if just being in her presence was enough to
		make all her worries disappear. She sighed contentedly and nuzzled her head deeper into
		the pillow.</p>

		<p>"Good," the gunslinger whispered, moving just a
		fraction of an inch closer. She was so close that they ended up sharing the same pillow. A
		thin smile crossed Josie's lips as she drifted off to a sleep undisturbed by nightmares.</p>

		<p>The knight fought valiantly, slaying one dragon after another in
		the quest to rescue the princess. At last the hero was victorious and knelt before the
		fair maiden. Try as she might, the sleeping women couldn't make out the knight's face when
		the helmet was removed. All she could see was a dark head bending down to kiss the
		princess. Slowly the lips moved closer until only one thin beam of light passed between
		them. The light became less and less until total darkness ended her dream.</p>
