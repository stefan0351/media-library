	<chapter title="1: Alone">
		<p>The late afternoon sun set across the wind-ravaged canyon,
		turning the rock into a brilliant tapestry of orange and brown. The lone rider sat atop
		her golden mare, her raven hair flowing loose over her shoulders. The wide brim of her
		black Stetson kept the orange ball of flame from blinding her as she looked around for a
		safe place to sleep. She spotted a cave off in the distance, and leaned down to whisper
		into the horse's ear. "Come on, Phoenix. Just a little bit longer and we'll
		rest." Josie urged the horse forward up a narrow slope, her eyes watching the
		surrounding area the entire time. It had only been six weeks since her gang had been
		ambushed while trying to rob a train in Missouri. It was only her quick thinking and fast
		gun that kept her alive. She hoped that Henry and Jonah had also escaped; she'd seen them
		take off in separate directions to draw the posse away from her. She also knew that the
		ambush had been orchestrated by one of her men in an attempt to kill her, presumably to
		collect the bounty that was on her head. To be sold out for one thousand dollars by one of
		the men she had been riding with for two years still stuck in her craw. When they had set
		out on what was to be their last train robbery she could not have foreseen that before the
		day was out, she would be riding for her life with a fully armed posse on her heels, not
		knowing the fate of her two trusted comrades. </p>

		<p>When she reached the cave entrance, Josie dismounted and removed
		the saddle and saddlebags from Phoenix' back. She tethered the mare to the base of a
		nearby tree, where she began to crop grass in the dappled shade. </p>

		<p>Josie carried her few belongings into the cool interior of the
		cave. Not that there was much in the saddlebags; most of her supplies were left at the
		main camp when she left for her ill-fated trip to the railway siding. Once settled into
		the cave with a small fire to keep her warm, Josie took stock of her inventory, starting
		with her clothes. She had her black boots, complete with silver tips and spurs. Filthy
		black cotton trousers covered her legs, and a thin black long sleeved shirt and brown
		leather vest covered her upper torso. She wore a black leather belt that was more than
		just for keeping her pants up and a hidden pocket sewn into the inside concealed a small
		knife. If her hands were tied behind her back, the pocket was within easy reach. That
		little secret saved her life more than once. The vest also had a secret compartment. A
		dingy gray kerchief was wrapped around her neck. Her black Stetson was resting nearby.
		These were the only clothes she owned now.</p>

		<p>Her weapons were the only other things she still had. Two Colt
		Peacemakers were strapped to her legs by bullet-rimmed gun belts that crossed each other
		over her slender hips.</p>

		<p>A Winchester 73 in a brown leather scabbard was strapped to the
		saddle. Josie had less than six cartridges for it, since the rest had been expended while
		escaping from the posse. Each boot contained one bowie knife, and she still had her whip,
		albeit a bit shorter than when it was new.</p>

		<p>Rummaging through the saddlebags again, she found no money, no
		dried meat, nothing she could use. Only a small bottle of ink and a broken pen resided in
		one pouch, while a fork and spoon took up another. Josie had no pots or pans, nothing in
		which to cook a meal. Removing the leather cover to her canteen and heating the metal
		container in the fire made hot water. She wished she had more than one canteen; the days
		were too hot to ride without draining the flask at least twice. Josie tried to follow the
		river, knowing that a town would eventually appear.</p>

		<p>With no bedroll with which to cover herself, Josie laid her head
		on the saddle, using the scratchy saddle-blanket as a pillow, and settled in for a light
		sleep.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="2: The Rescue">
		<p>Josie urged Phoenix along, following the sounds of a woman's
		screams. Soundlessly she slid from the horses back, and with the grace of a cat she crept
		to the edge of a clearing from which the sounds emanated. She saw two scruffy men holding
		a young woman while a third was pawing at her body.</p>

		<p>"Why don't you pick on someone your own size, boys?"
		Her voice startled the pawing man, who turned and began to reach for his gun. Josie's
		hands were quicker; she fired two shots into him before his gun was even half out of his
		holster. The other two let go of the girl and reached for their weapons. The
		sharp-shooting woman took them down with only one bullet each. If the truth were told, she
		could have killed the first man with only one bullet, but she felt that he deserved two
		for trying to rape the frightened woman.</p>

		<p>The blonde woman sunk to the ground and huddled herself into a
		small ball. Josie couldn't see the girl's face as it was buried in her arms, but the
		rescuer could tell she was crying. With a shrug, the gunslinger turned away from the girl
		and walked to where the men lay in pools of their own blood. She stripped the gun belts
		from their bodies, and searched their pockets for coins or anything else that might be
		usable. The one who had been trying to tear the clothes off the young girl had a pocket
		full of Confederate currency, and even more stuffed into the band inside his gray uniform
		cap. With a shake of her head, Josie dropped the bills on top of his prostrate form.
		"The south won't rise again...and neither will you, Johnny." She straightened up
		and gave a sharp whistle, and Phoenix stopped munching grass on the edge of the clearing
		and trotted obediently to her mistress' side. Josie draped the three gun belts around the
		saddle horn, and stuffed the coins and two knives she had taken off of the dead men into
		the saddlebags. After securing the leather straps on the saddlebags, she put her foot in
		the stirrup and smoothly vaulted into the saddle. She made a clicking noise with her
		tongue, and the horse broke into a trot. The sound of the hoof beats penetrated through
		the girl's stupor. </p>

		<p>"Wait!" The girl cried as she struggled to her feet.
		"You can't leave me here." She looked around at the blood soaked dead men, and
		the look in her eyes was that of a frightened child. "Please." She added
		quietly. </p>

		<p>Josie's keen hearing picked up on the absolute fear and
		helplessness in the girl's voice. Cursing under her breath, she reined in her horse, and
		urged her closer to the girl. "What's your name, girl?" She spoke in her most
		intimidating voice.</p>

		<p>"Re-Rebecca." She stammered. She looked up at the woman
		who had saved her. Dressed all in black save for the vest and scarf, the tall woman looked
		like death itself to the inexperienced farm girl. The only humanity she could see in the
		finely chiseled face was the piercing blue eyes.</p>

		<p>"Do you have a home around here?" The gunslinger asked.</p>

		<p>"N-No. I live in Chancetown." Josie groaned inwardly.
		Chancetown was several hours ride in the opposite direction. Looking around, the outlaw
		saw no signs of horses.</p>

		<p>"Where are their horses?" She demanded.</p>

		<p>"Uh..." Rebecca shook her head. "They had a
		wagon...I don't..."</p>

		<p>"I'm going to go have a look for it. Stay here!" Josie
		barked as she urged Phoenix out of the clearing.</p>

		<p>Two hours passed before Josie returned. Rebecca was sitting, once
		again curled up in a ball, as far away from the dead men as she could get, and still be in
		sight when the gunslinger returned. As she approached the clearing, Josie noticed the
		vultures starting to circle overhead. She stopped the horse in front of the girl. Rebecca
		looked up at her but said nothing.</p>

		<p>"I found the wagon. It had gone over the edge of a cliff. I
		had to shoot the horses." She had only been able to salvage a few of the drifter's
		goods, as most of them had been smashed beyond use in the fall down the hill, but she saw
		no need to share this information with the young woman.</p>

		<p>"How do I get back home?" Rebecca asked softly, her
		voice on the verge of breaking. She had never been away from home before and now she was
		with a woman who had just killed three men.</p>

		<p>Josie pointed in the direction of the town. "Go that way. On
		foot, it'll take you no more than a day." The girl nodded and slowly rose to walk
		away. Josie debated and argued with herself for a few moments before nudging Phoenix
		forward to catch the girl. Rebecca stopped as the woman in black dismounted.</p>

		<p>"Get up there. I'll drop you off outside of town."
		Rebecca looked up at the tall horse.</p>

		<p>"He's awfully big."</p>

		<p>"SHE'S a horse! They're supposed to be big." Josie
		snarled. Rebecca quickly moved to put her foot in the stirrup. Her long dress and endless
		petticoats made it impossible for her to mount the tall beast. Josie grabbed her and threw
		her on the ground. "Spread your legs." Rebecca looked at her, horrified. Josie
		grabbed one ankle and yanked her legs apart. Before the young woman could protest, she
		pulled a bowie knife out of her boot and stabbed through the material, halfway between the
		girl's hips and knees. After putting the knife back, Josie grabbed the torn material with
		both hands and ripped it the rest of the way down to the hem. "Stand up." Josie
		made no effort to help the frightened girl up. Rebecca climbed to her feet, still quite
		fearful of the woman with the guns. Josie boosted the terrified blonde up into the saddle
		and then mounted up behind her.</p>

		<p>The torn ends of the blonde woman's dress flapped in the wind as
		they made their way to Chancetown. Rebecca gripped the saddle horn with both hands as the
		large horse's hooves ate up the ground beneath them. Josie's hands rested on her own
		thighs, the left hand holding the reins. She was never comfortable with physical contact,
		unless she was fighting. This frightened child needed comforting, but that ability was not
		something that the outlaw was willing to do. All she wanted was to get the blonde safely
		home so she could get back to her own business.</p>

		<p>"Um...can I ask you something?" Rebecca said timidly.</p>

		<p>"You just did." She answered wryly.</p>

		<p>"Oh, well, I guess I did. I-I was just wondering what your
		name was. So I could thank you properly for saving my life."</p>

		<p>"You sure you want to know, little girl?" Josie
		taunted. The woman sitting in front of her nodded. "The name is Josie Hunter."</p>

		<p>Rebecca stiffened and gripped the horn even tighter. "Josie
		Hunter, the outlaw? Terror of the Train rails?" She stopped when she realized that
		the names might not go over so well with the heavily armed woman behind her.</p>

		<p>"The same." Josie replied. "Any more
		questions?"</p>

		<p>"What? Oh, no Jo-I mean..."</p>

		<p>"You mean to keep quiet and not bother me or I'll kill you
		without a thought." Josie said firmly. Rebecca pressed her lips together tightly and
		vowed to do just that.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="3: Chancetown">
		<p>Rebecca's knuckles were white from holding on to the saddle horn.
		Josie pulled up the reins the instant she saw the first signs of civilization. Wordlessly,
		she dismounted and waited for the young woman to get off her horse so she could be on her
		way. It took a moment for Rebecca to disengage her fingers from the horn and dismount.
		Josie climbed back into the saddle.</p>

		<p>"Wait, you're not going to leave me here all alone, are
		you?"</p>

		<p>"Chancetown is right over there." Josie nudged Phoenix
		and took off, leaving the blonde woman standing there. Rebecca turned and headed home; not
		as excited as she should have been, although not really knowing why.</p>

		<p>As Rebecca walked through the main street in town, she could not
		help but notice that several people stopped and blatantly gawked at her. The wife of the
		man who ran the feed and grain store recognized the girl, and draping a horse blanket over
		her shoulders, she escorted the shaken young woman to the doctor's office. The doctor sent
		his son to tell Rebecca's family that she was in town. While waiting for the doctor to
		examine her, she got a look at herself in a mirror, and she understood why everyone was so
		worried. She was a mess. Her dress was completely ruined from the outlaw's knife, and
		stained by the men's blood. Her hair was loosely scattered about her head, with bits of
		grass and dirt tangled up in it. It took vigorous protesting by Rebecca to convince the
		doctor that she wasn't in need of a personal examination. The sheriff arrived at the same
		time as her parents. Her mother took one look at the torn dress and burst into tears. Her
		father scowled at her.</p>

		<p>"How could you let something like this happen to you!"
		He roared as he stepped closer to her, his hand upraised. Sheriff Wellman stepped between
		them.</p>

		<p>"Now, just hold on there, Caleb. We don't know what happened
		yet. No sense beating the girl for something she ain't done yet." The beefy sheriff
		waited until the angry man lowered his hand before turning to look at Rebecca, who was
		being held in a death-lock hug by her mother. "Girl, what happened?" He asked.</p>

		<p>It took a moment for Rebecca to get Sarah to release her. "I
		was out in the fields when three men in a wagon stopped and asked if I could tell them how
		to get to Chancetown. While I was telling one of them, the other two came up from behind
		and grabbed me. They threw me into the wagon and took off. I..." She was cut off by
		her father's angry voice.</p>

		<p>"And you let them?" He growled as he took a step
		forward. The sheriff turned his head and gave Caleb a warning glare.</p>

		<p>"I didn't let them!" Rebecca cried. "I tried to
		get away from them but there were three of them, and..."</p>

		<p>"Did they hurt you, child?" Sarah asked her daughter,
		with genuine concern in her voice.</p>

		<p>"No. They were going to but I was rescued."</p>

		<p>"Rescued?" Her father asked incredulously. "And
		just who'd be the one that rescued you?"</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunt..." She started to say the outlaw's full
		name, but stopped herself out of fear for what the gunslinger would do to her if she were
		caught because she told the sheriff she was in the area. Quickly she added, "I-I
		think that's what she said her name was. I was so upset I might have mis-heard."</p>

		<p>"You trying to say Josie Hunter saved you?" Caleb said
		angrily. "Drag me out of the fields for this nonsense!" He glared at his wife.
		"This is all your fault for letting her daydream all the time and read those books.
		Nothin' good ever came from reading no books. She should be learning how to be some man's
		wife 'stead of all the time havin' her nose buried in some damn book."</p>

		<p>"But Daddy, I-" A strong slap across the face silenced
		her. Sarah cried out, but made no effort to stop him.</p>

		<p>"You always did talk too much fer yer own good, girl. Look
		at you!" He looked at her disheveled hair and clothes. "Why, you ain't much
		better than them bitches and whores over to the saloon." He grabbed Rebecca by the
		upper arm, squeezing it painfully. "You git yourself out to the wagon right now,
		girl! You hear me?"</p>

		<p>"Y-yes, you're hurting me." She cried as his fingers
		tightened. Sarah knew better than to interfere. She stepped back a few feet and silently
		prayed that he wouldn't beat her in front of the sheriff.</p>

		<p>"You ain't seen hurt like yer gonna see it when I git you
		back home", he hissed under his breath so only Rebecca could hear him. Visions of her
		father's ideas of punishment flashed through her mind. She started to shake her head back
		and forth.</p>

		<p>"No, daddy, please. I didn't do anything wrong."</p>

		<p>"You're lying, girl! Makin' up stories 'bout that outlaw
		rescuing you. Why, even I know that murderin' bitch died a while back with her gang.
		'Sides, she's purely evil; ain't no way she'd risk her own neck to go and save your
		worthless hide." He smacked her once more before dragging her out to their wagon and
		roughly pushing her into the back. He didn't bother to help Sarah up. Sheriff Wellman came
		over and silently assisted her. Caleb climbed up on his side and grabbed the reins,
		unmindful of his daughter's tears.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Wellman watched them drive away. His eyes locked on the
		sad green eyes in the back of the wagon. Doctor Thompson stood next to him.</p>

		<p>"Think she's tellin' the truth?" The sheriff asked.</p>

		<p>"Hard to say. But if she is, she'd be better off with the
		outlaw than her father right now." Dr. Thompson decided not to mention the numerous
		faded bruises he saw when he examined her.</p>

		<p>"You may very well be right about that, Doc." The
		Sheriff knew all too well just how violent Caleb's temper was. He'd pulled the man out of
		enough barroom brawls over the years to know just how badly alcohol affected the farmer.
		It was obvious now that Caleb had already started his daily drinking binge.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca lay awake, tears streaming down her face. She was in too
		much pain to sleep anyway. Upon arriving at the farm, her father had dragged her into the
		barn and beat her severely with a leather strap until in desperation she made up a story
		that he believed. She told him that she had met up with a young man from town, who tried
		to have his way with her. When she refused, the boy slapped her around and left her miles
		from home. She said she tore her dress on barbed wire while crawling under a fence. He
		smiled and accepted that story, giving her a fresh beating for lying about the outlaw and
		the men, and another series of lashes for running away in the first place. Only when his
		massive arm ached from raising the strap did he finally drop the leather and leave the
		barn. Rebecca slumped to the earthen floor, the last sound she heard was him cursing her
		as he headed to the house. Only when she was certain that he'd drunk himself into a stupor
		did she dare leave the barn and enter the house. Her sister Kate and her mother helped her
		get cleaned up and put ointment on the multitude of lashes and cuts on her back and legs.
		Her thin dress and corset did nothing to ease the severity of the blows from the strap.
		Her mother had long ago run out of words to comfort her oldest daughter. For some reason,
		Caleb visited his wrath on Rebecca more than on any of his other women. Sarah suspected it
		was because no matter how much he beat her, he could not break Rebecca's spirit.</p>

		<p>Now lying in bed, her body in agony, Rebecca wondered just why
		she had bothered to return. She tried to roll over and winced in pain as her thin
		nightshirt rubbed against her tender skin. A loud crash downstairs told her that her
		father was now awake from his drunken slumber. Fear of another beating gripped her. This
		was no way to live, she thought. As he lumbered up the stairs, Rebecca heard him mumbling
		about his troublesome daughter and how he could only hope that "this damn
		foolishness" did not ruin her chances of finding a husband.</p>

		<p>Rebecca waited until she heard the snores coming from her
		parent's room before climbing out of her bed. She walked carefully around the floorboards
		that she knew creaked to avoid waking Kate, who was sleeping soundly on the other side of
		the room. Pulling one peasant dress from the pile of dirty clothes and grabbing her shoes,
		she quietly left their room and headed downstairs. After dressing quickly, she found a pen
		and ink and wrote a short note telling her mother and sister that she loved them and would
		send word soon.</p>

		<p>Once away from the farm, Rebecca realized that she had no idea
		which direction to take. Other than the farm, Chancetown was really the only place she
		knew. Without consciously thinking of where she was going, she found herself walking down
		the main street of town. Sheriff Wellman stepped out of the saloon at the same moment she
		walked by.</p>

		<p>"Hold up, girl. Where you goin'?" Rebecca looked at him
		fearfully. Her eyes reminded the lawman of a frightened deer.</p>

		<p>"I-I..." She wasn't sure what to say to him.
		"Please don't say anything." She finally asked fearfully.</p>

		<p>"Come here." He gently grabbed her arm, mentally
		cursing himself as he watched her flinch. Letting go he motioned for her to follow him
		over to the jail.</p>

		<p>"No, please...I can't go back...please." She begged.</p>

		<p>"Quiet down, child." He said softly as he opened the
		door to the jailhouse. Lighting a lantern, he motioned for her to sit down in a nearby
		chair as he walked behind a desk and sat down. "Do you have any money?"</p>

		<p>"No." He reached into a drawer and pulled out a small
		strongbox. Opening it, he pulled out two dollars and handed them to her. "I know it's
		only sixteen bits, but you can't go out there with nothing."</p>

		<p>She took the money and stuffed it in her boot. "I don't know
		how to thank you." Rebecca began. The Sheriff cut her off with a wave of his hand.</p>

		<p>"Don't thank me, child. I know your father. I should have
		stopped him a long time ago. You better get going before the sun comes up and he discovers
		you missing." Rebecca stood up to leave. "Where you goin' anyway?"</p>

		<p>"West." She said as she opened the door.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="4: Snakes">
		<p>Rebecca tried to follow the tracks of the outlaw, but the half
		moon wasn't cooperative. Several times she strayed off course, ending up almost a mile off
		by the time daylight started to help her. Fear of her father put life into her steps as
		she finally picked up the trail and started to follow it.</p>

		<p>Her peasant dress was stuck to her skin by the time evening
		mercifully set in. Rebecca's stomach was growling and her throat was parched. Her legs
		felt like iron weights as she trudged along, no longer sure if the hoof prints belonged to
		the gold colored horse or not. A vulture flew overhead, screeching his arrival. The tired
		woman quickened her pace to somewhere between a crawl and a walk. The burning orange of
		the setting sun was in her eyes, blinding her to the danger so close by. Only the telltale
		rattle gave her any warning.</p>

		<p>Rebecca came to a total stop, her eyes wide in terror. It wasn't
		just one rattlesnake; she had inadvertently stepped into a nest of the deadly creatures.
		One on the left side started to move in no particular direction, merely uncoiling and
		recoiling. Her heart was pounding in her chest so hard she was certain it was going to
		break through her ribs. She willed her legs to move, but they were frozen in place by her
		fear. The rattler slithered along the ground, its forked tongue slipping in and out of its
		mouth. Out of the corner of her eye, Rebecca saw several other snakes also starting to
		uncoil. A bloodcurdling scream pierced the evening air as her legs found life and started
		to run back away from the venomous snakes. Relocating the trail, Rebecca ran as fast as
		she could, her lungs burning with the effort. In the far distance, she swore she heard the
		sound of a horse running hard, or was it just the blood pounding in her ears? Stumbling
		over a large stone, she fell face first onto the dusty ground. With the twilight, the
		large horse almost didn't see her lying there. Only at the last second did Phoenix rear
		her head and move to the right to avoid trampling the girl. "Whoa."</p>

		<p>Josie looked around for signs of other people. Seeing none, she
		dismounted and looked at the grime covered face with the green eyes. She almost laughed at
		the sight. In her sternest voice she asked, "Are you the one who let out that horrid
		scream?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. There were these snakes, lots of them, and..."</p>

		<p>"You screamed like that for a few snakes?" Josie asked
		incredulously. "I heard you from miles away."</p>

		<p>"I was scared. There were so many of them." Rebecca
		slowly rose to her feet, her whole body protesting the use of the muscles.</p>

		<p>"You shouldn't be out here." Josie took another look at
		the girl. "I left you in that town."</p>

		<p>"I couldn't stay there anymore." Without a word, Josie
		vaulted effortlessly onto Phoenix.</p>

		<p>"Don't follow me, girl!" The outlaw warned before
		urging the horse into a gallop back to her campsite. Josie mentally cursed herself. Dinner
		was certain to be ruined now. She had left it on the spit when she heard the scream
		echoing through the canyon. The hungry outlaw swore that if she ever saw that annoying
		little brat again, she would shoot her.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="5: Dinner">
		<p>In her anger at the blackened lump that was supposed to be her
		dinner, Josie kicked the spit, sending the burnt food and wood flying. Grabbing her knife
		from her boot, she set off to catch another rabbit. Darkness had already settled, making
		it more difficult for her to find more meat.</p>

		<p>Two hours later, a large jackrabbit was skewered on a new spit
		and set to cook. Josie settled down against a large rock and started to disassemble and
		clean one of her guns. For safety's sake, she always had one fully loaded at all times.
		The firelight bounced off the gleaming metal as she slowly and methodically polished the
		weapon. After both guns were perfectly cleaned and polished, she reached for her
		Winchester.</p>

		<p>Josie had just opened the breech of the rifle when she heard the
		clear sounds of someone moving closer to her. Whoever it was was making too much noise to
		be of any danger, but the outlaw put her hand on her Peacemaker just in case. A branch
		must have hit the girl because Josie heard the quickly becoming familiar voice yelp. She
		released her grip on the handle of her gun. "You'd better come out here before I
		start shooting." She yelled.</p>

		<p>Rebecca stumbled through the brush and into the small clearing.
		The flames illuminated the frown on the outlaw's face. "I told you not to follow
		me." Josie scowled, turning her attention back to the cooking food.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry. It's just that I'm cold and hungry and I smelled
		your food, and well I guess I just followed my nose." Rebecca started to ramble on,
		then thought better of it when the outlaw glared at her. Josie said nothing, turning her
		attention back to the food. Unsure of what to do, Rebecca backed up a few steps and sat
		down, her face barely visible in the campfire. She sat quietly and watched as the outlaw
		slowly cleaned her rifle, seemingly oblivious to the burning food. "You're going to
		ruin it." She said clearly, although inside she was nervous. Josie glared at her.
		"I mean the rabbit. It's burning."</p>

		<p>Cursing loudly, Josie reached over and turned the spit. One side
		of the skinned animal was burned slightly, but most of the meat was still good. Without
		saying a word, she sat back and returned to the task of cleaning her weapon. This time,
		however, she kept one eye on her dinner.</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched as Josie cut the meat off of the carcass and laid
		it on a flat piece of bark. The outlaw deftly sliced the hunks of meat into smaller
		pieces. Stabbing the pieces with her knife, Josie ate half the meat while the hungry woman
		watched. The outlaw looked over at her. "Here." She held out the piece of bark
		holding the meat. "Come on, I know you're hungry. Your stomach makes almost as much
		noise as your mouth." Josie didn't bother to admit that it was only the girl's
		interruption that kept the rabbit from being burnt to a crisp.</p>

		<p>Rebecca timidly walked over to take the makeshift plate from the
		outlaw. Once the plate was in her hand, however, the smell of the cooked meat overwhelmed
		her fear. She sat right down, only a few feet from Josie, and proceeded to greedily eat
		the rabbit. "Mmm, oh this is so good, mmm, I haven't eaten since... oh thank you, by
		the way. I didn't know if you were going to, mm, give me any, even though you should have,
		since... I saved your dinner." Josie's eyebrow arched prominently as the rest of her
		face remained stoic and unreadable. Rebecca decided that perhaps she had said too much.
		She ate another bite in silence as her eyes settled on the canteen.</p>

		<p>"Here." Josie said in an exasperated tone as she handed
		her the water. "Try not to drink it all." Rebecca heard the words and took only
		a few small swallows before handing it back. Her thirst was barely touched but she dared
		not take any more. Josie knew by the weight of the flask that the girl had taken very
		little. The green eyes still stared at the container. Cursing herself inwardly, Josie
		passed the canteen back. Rebecca smiled and drained the flask.</p>

		<p>Rebecca set the now empty piece of bark down and stared at the
		ground. "Did you want something else?" Josie growled, keeping her focus on the
		rifle.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, it's just that it's warmer by the fire." She
		looked around. "And there are no snakes."</p>

		<p>"Make your own damned fire." The outlaw muttered in a
		voice clear enough for the young woman to hear. Rebecca nodded and slowly rose to her
		feet. She faced away from the outlaw, her head hung low.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for the food and water." She said as she
		slowly walked away, hoping that the outlaw would offer to let her stay. No such words
		came.</p>

		<p>Rebecca walked until she could just make out the campsite through
		the brush. She sat down on the ground and leaned her back against a tree; her focus fixed
		on the woman near the fire. She fell asleep to the sight of Josie stoking the fire with
		logs, banking it for the night.</p>

		<p>Josie silently crept over to where she knew the girl was
		sleeping. The pale moonlight pierced through the leaves and shone upon the sleeping face.
		She now saw bruises that weren't there the day before. 'No wonder you're running away.'
		Josie thought to herself. 'But I'm not going to be your caretaker.'</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="6: The Shadow">
		<p>Rebecca woke to a bright sun beating down on her. She quickly
		scrambled to her feet, wincing at the soreness. The outlaw was gone. She moved into the
		campsite and placed her hand over the now dead fire. It was cold. Ignoring the pain in her
		legs and feet, Rebecca set out to follow Josie. As she walked, she wondered if the outlaw
		knew she was sleeping only a few feet away. She tried to remember the stories she had
		heard about Josie.</p>

		<p>The details were sketchy to her, but the general information was
		clear. Josie was wanted in more than half the states for one thing or another. She led
		gangs on raids of wagons and stagecoaches. Rebecca thought that she had read that train
		robberies were the dark clothed woman's specialty. Rumor was that the 'Terror of the Train
		Rails' was responsible for no less than one hundred deaths and even more shootings and
		robberies. Rebecca tried to merge the image of the outlaw that she had read about with the
		image that she had seen. Josie Hunter was featured in several of the dime novels Rebecca
		had read in bits and pieces sitting on a barrel in the back of the mercantile while her
		mother shopped. But the woman described in those stories bore no resemblance - other than
		in name - to the exotic creature who grudgingly shared a meal with her last night. Her
		father had said that Josie was pure evil, but that wasn't what she saw. Why would someone
		who was purely evil bother to rescue her from bandits, or give her food to eat? Surely she
		would have just let her go to her fate, perhaps even killed her herself. No, the tall
		woman in black wasn't purely evil. There was some good in that heart, of that Rebecca was
		sure. She wondered what had happened to make the blue-eyed woman become one of the most
		feared criminals in the West.</p>

		<p>She followed the trail all day, resting only for a few minutes at
		a small creek to wash her face and drink as much water as she could without choking. She
		didn't know how much of a head start Josie had on her, and she didn't want to add to the
		distance. Her feet protested every step, and her legs screamed with every stride. Rebecca
		didn't know why she felt so compelled to follow the outlaw, she just knew that she had to.</p>

		<p>Cresting a small rise, Josie noted the signs of a small camp. A
		quick look at the horses and tents told her that there were at least five men. At the
		moment, three were engaged in a card game. She didn't see any others. Urging Phoenix to go
		back down the rise, Josie thought about the blonde girl. The outlaw was certain that the
		young woman was following her. Josie dismounted and hid herself and Phoenix within the
		cover of nearby trees. Sure enough, within an hour, the blonde woman appeared in the
		distance.</p>

		<p>Josie wasn't the only one to notice the girl in a dirty dress
		walking. One of the men from the camp had climbed up the rise to relieve himself and
		whistled. "Hey boys! Guess what's headin' our way." Five other men climbed up
		the rise and looked to see what all the fuss was about. Josie cursed silently and took a
		small step backward to hide herself more. "Thomas..." The first man said
		quietly, although Josie's keen hearing picked up every word. "You and John head over
		that way." He turned to face the other men. "Mike and Sam, you two go over
		there. Rich and I will stay here. We'll surround her." The men laughed lecherously.</p>

		<p>If there was one thing that Josie hated, it was a bunch of men
		trying to pick on a small girl. Putting her hands on her guns, she stepped out from the
		cover of the trees. "Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Or are little girls
		all you can handle?" Two men reached for their side arms. Josie's bullets flew,
		cutting them both down. "Anyone else?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca heard the gunshots and panicked; she dove under the
		nearest bush and prayed no part of her clothing was showing. There were several more
		exchanges of gunfire before there was a long period of silence.</p>

		<p>"You can come out now, girl." Josie said in an annoyed
		tone. Rebecca slowly climbed out from the bushes and looked at the outlaw. Josie
		gracefully slid from her saddle. In three long strides she was within arms reach of
		Rebecca. "You don't listen very well. I had to kill six men to keep them from raping
		you. That makes a total of nine men's deaths on my hands because of you." Rebecca
		didn't know what to say. She felt bad for the men dying.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry." She said meekly. In an instant, Josie's
		gun was against her nose. She heard the unmistakable sound of the hammer cocking.</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, just improve. Figure out a way to save your
		own hide; I'm sick of doing it for you." She looked at the blonde thoughtfully.
		"I should kill you now to make sure you don't bother me anymore." Rebecca said
		nothing as she looked down at the cool steel pressed against her nose. Deciding that her
		point was made, Josie pulled her gun back, releasing the hammer gently before sliding it
		into her holster. She mounted Phoenix and turned back to the men's camp.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="7: Divvying up the booty">
		<p>Josie rode back to the campsite and took inventory of the
		supplies. The men were well stocked, with full compliments of weapons and supplies. The
		guns were useless to her, being of inferior quality to her own. She stuffed some bullets
		into a pouch and tied it to her saddle horn. Never can have too many bullets, she mused.
		She was about to search the tents for the best bedroll when she heard the sound of Rebecca
		vomiting off in the bushes. Cursing herself mentally, Josie went to check on the young
		woman.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was just wiping her mouth when Josie walked up to her.
		"I told you not to follow. What part of that don't you understand?" The outlaw
		said angrily, although she was slightly concerned about the pallor of the girl's face. The
		paleness only served to accent the bruises more.</p>

		<p>"I understood you perfectly." Rebecca replied angrily.
		She was embarrassed to be seen in such a state; after all, the dead men were bandits. But
		the sight of their dead bodies still made the innocent girl sad for the loss of life.
		"You can't take all their stuff, so I see no reason why I can't pick through it too.
		After all, I could use some of these things as well."</p>

		<p>"Suit yourself, little girl." Josie said evenly.</p>

		<p>"My name is Rebecca!" She retorted. "And I'm not a
		little girl."</p>

		<p>"Makes no difference to me." Josie replied as she
		headed back to rummage through the men's belongings.</p>

		<p>Exiting a tent with her new bedroll in hand, Josie noticed the
		scent of fresh meat cooking. Looking at the fire, she saw that Rebecca had thrown more
		logs on and was cooking up some of the food that the dead men had left behind. The
		outlaw's stomach growled as the pleasant odor conjured up memories of long ago meals. One
		thing that Josie had no skill at was cooking.</p>

		<p>"There's plenty for both of us." Rebecca said as she
		continued to turn over the cooking beef. She kept her eyes on the food, fearful of the
		possible angry look that might be coming from the outlaw. "I mean, there's no sense
		wasting it. The meat won't travel well and if we don't eat it, then the vultures
		will." Josie conceded the point, making her stomach grumble again with joy at the
		thought of decent food. Without saying a word, Josie continued to search the camp for
		useful items. She came up with a small folding shovel, several pieces of flint, a few
		dollars and coins, two more canteens, and spare clothes. Her saddlebags were full of the
		much-needed supplies by the time Rebecca announced that the food was ready to eat.</p>

		<p>Rebecca waited a few minutes for the outlaw to come over and pick
		up the plate of beef and beans before making a plate of her own. Without a sound, Josie
		sat down on the other side of the fire and started to eat her food. Rebecca quietly passed
		her the canteen of water. Josie made no effort to take it, concentrating solely on eating
		the tasty food. Setting the water flask on the ground between them, Rebecca turned her
		attention back to her dinner. She was spooning some more beans on her plate when she saw
		Josie reach out toward her, plate in hand. Rebecca suppressed a smile as she scooped the
		food onto the outlaw's plate.</p>

		<p>After wiping her plate with the last of the bread from the men's
		camp, Josie set the dirty dish and utensils down on the ground. Without so much as a thank
		you, she rose to her feet and wandered off. Rebecca sat quietly by the dying fire, afraid
		to leave and afraid to stay. The big horse was munching on some grass nearby, so she knew
		that the outlaw would be back. Deciding between the unknown and the murderer who had
		already threatened to kill her, Rebecca maintained her position by the fire.</p>

		<p>Rebecca had used up most of the loose kindling while trying to
		keep the fire going. It was now twilight and she was beginning to wonder if Josie really
		was going to come back, despite the evidence of Phoenix standing nearby.</p>

		<p>"You still here?" Rebecca jumped at the sound of the
		outlaw's voice just behind her. Josie continued to walk past her until she reached the
		opposite side of the fire. She dropped an armful of wood onto the ground. Reaching for a
		nearby hatchet, Josie cut the branches into usable lengths, throwing several directly into
		the fire.</p>

		<p>"I-I didn't know if I should leave or not. I mean, I
		wouldn't want you to have to kill anyone else or anything." Rebecca said nervously.
		Josie said nothing as she continued to chop the wood. Uncertain of what else to do, the
		young woman got up and started to walk around the camp, heading for the still-tethered
		horses of the dead men. Rifling through the saddlebags, she found a pen and a small bottle
		of ink. She didn't find any paper or parchment. A more thorough search revealed only small
		scraps of paper and a pocket-sized bible. There was a blank page preceding the beginning
		of the familiar book, but Rebecca didn't dare use it. She had once bent the corner of a
		page in her father's bible and received a sound whipping for it. Putting the bible back in
		the saddlebag, the young woman returned to the fireside.</p>

		<p>Josie was finished cutting the wood and was now intently cleaning
		one of her guns. Positioning herself so she could watch the outlaw but not be too close,
		Rebecca sat down. The long fingers moved gracefully across the smooth steel, polishing it
		with an old, stained piece of cloth. Rebecca heard the soft click as Josie opened the
		barrel to clean it. Hours seemed to fly by as the outlaw cleaned all of her weapons and
		the young woman watched.</p>

		<p>The warm fire, the filling meal, and the hypnotic rhythm of
		Josie's hand rubbing the polishing cloth across the steel all served to lull Rebecca to
		sleep. The outlaw watched her for a few moments before covering her with one of the
		blankets. Hours later, Josie still sat there, wondering why this young girl seemed so
		intent on following her.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="8: Mason's Gulch">
		<p>"Get up." Josie roughly nudged the sleeping woman with
		her silver-tipped boot.</p>

		<p>"Hrrummphhh." The sleeping form snuggled deeper under
		the covers.</p>

		<p>"Get up now or I leave you behind." Josie snarled.
		Rebecca quickly sat up and tried to bring herself to wakefulness. "You've got one
		minute to make a trip to the woods, then I'm leaving."</p>

		<p>"No breakfast?" She whined as she stood up and
		stretched. Josie looked at her and frowned.</p>

		<p>"You can't travel around dressed like that." Josie said
		as she looked at the long peasant dress and soft soled shoes.</p>

		<p>"What am I supposed to wear?" She called as she headed
		into the woods. Josie walked into one of the tents and selected two shirts and two pairs
		of britches.</p>

		<p>Tossing them in a pile on top of Rebecca's blanket, the outlaw
		set out to find the small man that had been the previous owner of the clothes.</p>

		<p>"Put these on." Josie pointed at the clothes pile,
		which now included a pair of pointed toed boots and a beige Stetson. Rebecca picked up the
		clothes and looked at her, then at the tent, then back to her. "I'm not waiting all
		day." Josie said as she crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow at the young woman.</p>

		<p>"Sorry." Rebecca murmured. She reached up to undo the
		first button, then looked at the outlaw. Josie scowled and muttered a curse before turning
		around to double check the cinch of Phoenix's saddle. Rebecca quickly undressed and
		slipped into the britches. They were a little loose and slightly too long for the small
		woman.</p>

		<p>"What about the corset?" She asked as she reached
		behind her for the laces.</p>

		<p>"You'll be more comfortable without it", was the reply.
		Rebecca quickly removed the corset and slipped on the loose fitting shirt. "I'll
		saddle up one of these horses for you," Josie offered. Rebecca was tugging the new
		boots on when Josie started toward the string of horses and the young woman hopped after
		her, pulling on the last boot. </p>

		<p>"I can't...ride alone," she protested even as the
		gunslinger tightened the girth on the smallest of the horses. "I'm scared of horses.
		One kicked me when I was a little girl, and since then I can't bear to be on a horse by
		myself. Please, can't I just ride with you? I feel safe when you're up there with
		me." Josie looked into the innocent green eyes of the young blonde, and saw that she
		was most sincere about her fear of horses. Even so, it was not practical for them to ride
		double over a prolonged period of time; it would be hard on the horse, not to mention
		uncomfortable for Josie. Only in bed did she like to be close to a woman. When the loving
		was over, she wanted her space. With a shrug, Josie draped the usable supplies the dead
		men no longer needed on the back of the horse she had saddled, and untied the rest. She
		had planned on keeping two of the men's horses, but if Rebecca would not ride, there was
		no point. She led the little horse to where Phoenix stood waiting for her, and
		effortlessly vaulted into the saddle. She looked down at the younger woman whose expectant
		face was turned toward her.</p>

		<p>"You'll have to walk," she said emotionlessly. "I
		can't put the extra weight on Phoenix in this heat." She made a clicking sound with
		her tongue, and the big golden mare started moving, the smaller horse following obediently
		behind. With a sigh, the blonde fell in with the parade.</p>

		<p>As the morning wore on Rebecca fell further and further behind.
		Her feet hurt too much from the previous days walking to keep up with the well-rested
		mare. Her stomach grumbled from lack of food, and her normally sunny disposition was
		turning noticeably cloudy. "Josie," she called to the woman far ahead.
		"Josie, please wait!" The young woman watched as the horse stopped. When it was
		obvious that Josie wasn't going to come back to see what she wanted, Rebecca broke into a
		trot to catch up to the outlaw before she changed her mind and decided to ride on. She
		drew alongside the horse and rider, and gasped as she fought to catch her breath.</p>

		<p>"I can hardly walk anymore," she said petulantly.
		"My feet are killing me, and I'm starving. Don't outlaws eat?" The tone in
		Rebecca's voice, and the little girl pout on her face almost made Josie laugh out loud.
		She turned away, and managed to put a serious scowl on her face.</p>

		<p>"Yes. We eat little blonde farm-girls for breakfast. How
		nice for me there's one so handy."</p>

		<p>Rebecca raised her hand to slap the gunslinger on the thigh, but
		the look in the ice blue eyes made her think twice. She dropped her hand and grumbled,
		"I'm serious. Please, can't we stop and eat?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, all right." Josie slid from the back of the horse,
		and looking around for a shady spot, she saw a small grove of trees over a small rise.
		"Can you walk that far?" she asked, pointing to the oasis in the distance.
		Rebecca nodded, and eagerly began trekking up the hill. Josie watched as the blonde walked
		away, and a smile came to her face. She gave her head a little shake wondering not for the
		first time what had possessed her to allow this slip of a girl to talk her way along for
		the ride.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca threw herself down in the shade of a large oak tree, and
		pulled the boots from her aching feet. Blisters had formed and many had broken already,
		leaving her feet oozing and raw. Having her feet bare so she could feel a cooling breeze
		on them felt wonderful. Josie tethered the horses a few feet away but still in the shade,
		and rummaged in her saddlebag for some jerky. She unwound the strap of the canteen from
		the saddle horn and walked to where the younger woman was lying in the grass. Her eyes
		widened as she saw the condition of Rebecca's feet, and she mentally kicked herself for
		insisting that the poor woman walk. She dropped down beside the little blonde and thrust
		the canteen into one of her hands, and a hunk of jerky into the other. Rebecca had been
		almost dozing with her eyes closed, but when she felt the canteen against her hand, she
		opened her eyes and smiled at the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Thanks," she said gratefully, tipping the canteen to
		her dry lips and taking a large swallow. She coughed as a bit of the liquid went down the
		wrong pipe.</p>

		<p>"Easy does it," Josie admonished her. "Won't do
		you much good if you choke yourself to death." From where she sat, Josie could see
		the dark smudges that marred the pretty face of the innocent girl. Beneath the purple
		bruises was evidence of earlier beatings. Josie put her finger under Rebecca's chin, and
		turned her head up to get a better look. "Who did this?" Josie asked softly.
		Rebecca's eyes began to glisten with tears as she watched the outlaw's examination of her
		discolored cheek. She lowered her head when Josie finally let go.</p>

		<p>"My father."</p>

		<p>"Somebody should give him a taste of his own medicine."
		Josie whispered through clenched teeth. She silently promised herself that if she should
		ever encounter the man she would gladly do just that.</p>

		<p>Rebecca shook her head, and the tears that were pooled in her
		eyes slipped down her cheeks. "He's not a bad man, really," she protested.
		"He was a good father; very strict with us children, but usually fair. When my
		brother was killed in the war, he sort of...snapped. Then he started drinking, and when he
		drinks...."</p>

		<p>"You don't have to tell me. I've been around plenty of that
		type of man. But you shouldn't excuse him. What happened to your brother had nothing to do
		with you." </p>

		<p>"I know, but..."</p>

		<p>"No," Josie said sternly. She thought of her own
		father, the kindest most gentle man she had ever known and wished that the innocent girl
		beside her could have grown up in such a safe and caring environment. "A father
		should never hurt his children, no matter what." Feeling emotions so close to the
		surface was awkward for Josie, and she stood up and let her eyes roam around the
		surrounding countryside as if she was looking for something. "I'll be right
		back," she said abruptly. She walked toward a clump of bushes in the distance, and
		within a few minutes was out of Rebecca's sight.</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched the tall black clad woman walk away. She couldn't
		imagine what had caused her to leave so suddenly unless she was looking for a place to
		relieve herself. With a sigh, Rebecca started to chew on the dry jerky. Her appetite
		seemed to have deserted her and she thought about tossing the jerky away, but realized she
		would undoubtedly want it later. She slid the piece of dried meat into her pocket and lay
		down in the cool grass to wait for the gunslinger to return.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie stood gazing down at the still form under the tree.
		Rebecca's face was relaxed in sleep, her lips slightly parted. How child-like she seemed
		to the toughened older woman. Yet she was not a child. Josie reckoned she must be about
		eighteen, which was considerably older than she herself had been when she found herself on
		her own. She found herself wanting to protect her from any further abuse. "Hey, wake
		up lazy bones," she said softly. Rebecca still breathed with sleep, so the gunslinger
		knelt down beside her and said a little louder, "I brought dessert." The green
		eyes flew open and focused on Josie who held her vest in her hands with a large bulge
		hanging down.</p>

		<p>"Dessert?" Rebecca yawned and stretched. Josie laid the
		vest on the ground to reveal a mound of plump ripe blackberries. A huge grin spread across
		Rebecca's face. Her appetite returned with a vengeance at the sight of those juicy
		berries. She grabbed one and popped it in her mouth, pushing her tongue against the roof
		of her mouth to squeeze the juice throughout her mouth. "Ohhh, that's heaven,"
		she breathed as she reached for another. Josie watched as one after another the berries
		disappeared into the ravenous girl. Suddenly it occurred to Rebecca that she had eaten all
		the fruit and Josie had none.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eat them all. I'll go pick
		you some more." She started to rise, but Josie put her hand on her shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Not necessary. I ate a bunch while I was picking them. Sit
		back and let me have a look at your feet." She sat on the ground and brought
		Rebecca's feet to her lap. They looked too tender to attempt to put footwear on without
		allowing the blisters some healing time. "I'm afraid you won't be able to wear those
		boots again any time soon." </p>

		<p>"Oh, tarnation. I was just beginning to like them," she
		said sarcastically. </p>

		<p>"Stay here," Josie said, rising and crossing to her
		saddlebags where she found a roll of gauze. She returned to where Rebecca sat and once
		again took her feet in her hands. Gently she wrapped the gauze around each foot in turn
		and then tied it loosely around Rebecca's ankles. </p>

		<p>"Not very fashionable, but it should keep the dirt out of
		those blisters until they heal a bit." Josie stood up and held out her hand to the
		young woman, who grasped it in both of hers. Josie tugged her to her feet and then swept
		her into her arms. She walked to Phoenix and stood Rebecca on her feet briefly so she
		could grasp her waist. She lifted her up and boosted her onto the horse's rump.</p>

		<p>"Looks like you get your wish after all," she said as
		she swung up into the saddle. "Put your arms around my waist and hold on." Josie
		said as she urged Phoenix into a trot. Both women were left to their own thoughts as they
		rode west. Rebecca held on tight as she bounced up and down with each step of the massive
		horse's hooves, her thoughts on the painful past she was leaving behind.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Whoa." Josie pulled Phoenix to a stop just before the
		edge of town. "Get down." She watched as Rebecca slid down off the horse.</p>

		<p>"What's wrong?" The runaway asked as she watched the
		outlaw reach into the saddlebags and pull out her dress.</p>

		<p>"Put this on." Josie said as she handed her the
		garment. "You don't want to be seen with me. It'll be easier for you if you're in
		your own clothes. You'll be safe there."</p>

		<p>"Wait. Aren't you coming?" Rebecca reached up and
		touched the outlaw's thigh as Josie climbed back into the saddle.</p>

		<p>"No. It's not safe for me to go there. There's a price on my
		head, you know." She looked down at the hand and arched an eyebrow. Rebecca gulped
		and moved her hand.</p>

		<p>"Sorry. Just a habit, I guess. I like to touch people while
		I'm talking to them." A momentary silence fell between them. "Do you want me to
		get anything for you? I mean, I can go and bring it back."</p>

		<p>"You expect me to trust you with my money?" Josie asked
		incredulously.</p>

		<p>"I haven't lied to you yet. I didn't have to offer, you
		know." Rebecca was hurt by her distrust. Josie's blue eyes bore down on her, trying
		to search for signs of deceit. The young woman's face showed pure innocence and honesty.
		Although cautious, Josie decided to take a chance. There were too many things she needed
		that couldn't be found on the prairie.</p>

		<p>"All right. I'll trust you." Josie said as she
		dismounted. Quicker than Rebecca could react, the outlaws hands were on her upper arms,
		squeezing painfully. "But if you cross me, I'll send you to your maker without a
		thought." Her words were firm and full of threat.</p>

		<p>"Y-yes. Please, you're hurting me." She looked at the
		hands gripping her arms as tears started to blur her eyes. Josie let go and turned to open
		the saddlebag.</p>

		<p>"Do you know how to read?"</p>

		<p>"Of course I know how to read. I can write too. Actually I'm
		a very good writer, if I do say so myself. I do mostly poems and children's tales, but I'd
		really like to become a pulp writer, you know, writing stories about famous people and
		places and...."</p>

		<p>"I only asked you if you could read," Josie said,
		annoyed. She pulled out the ink, pen, and paper, then wrote out a short list of necessary
		supplies. The total was less than six bits. She could afford to lose that if it was a
		trick. Handing Rebecca the note, she said "Don't tell anyone who this is for, and
		don't mention my name to anyone. When you have everything, come back here."</p>

		<p>"Okay." Rebecca maintained a straight face, but inside
		she was jumping for joy at the chance to do something to help the woman who had saved her
		life, twice.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Mason's Gulch was a typical western town. Several small buildings
		formed the only street. A large stable occupied the far end of town. The standard
		businesses were there; a telegraph office, jail, saloon, smithy, bank, hotel, general
		store, and doctor's office. Rebecca quickly set out to find the items on the short list.</p>

		<p>She was in the general store, picking up the last item on Josie's
		list, a spool of fine thread for stitching. As she approached the counter, she heard the
		owner and another man talking. She stopped at the end of the isle and listened. Judging
		from the star on the other man's vest, he had to be the sheriff.</p>

		<p>"...I'm telling ya, there ain't no way we're gonna be able
		to hang on to our skins and our belongings both. I say we hand over what they demand and
		ask them to spare our lives."</p>

		<p>"Mike, what makes you think they gonna just take the money
		and git? If'n we give up, they gonna just kill us all anyway. I say we fight 'em,"
		the sheriff replied. "If we can get enough men up on the roofs we can ambush 'em. We
		can't just sit here and wait for 'em to slaughter us like cattle."</p>

		<p>Rebecca moved forward and placed the purchases on the counter.
		The sheriff put his fingers to the brim of his hat and tipped it slightly in
		acknowledgment of the young lady. Mike smiled as he wrapped up her order. "Two bits,
		miss."</p>

		<p>"Who are you talking about?" She asked as she handed
		him the coins. "You're not from 'round here, are ya?" Mike asked.</p>

		<p>"No, I'm just passing through."</p>

		<p>"Well, I hope your husband is well armed. The Caram gang is
		heading this way." The name was well known to Rebecca. This gang of thieves was
		famous for their brutality, and their skill at eluding capture. As far as she knew none of
		them had ever been apprehended, and their numbers increased constantly. </p>

		<p>"Are you going to fight them?"</p>

		<p>"There'r too many of 'em. We're mostly farmers. We don't got
		the skills or the know how to fight 'em." He looked at the storeowner, then back at
		her. "I suggest you head back 't where you come from 'n warn 'em. A farmer from just
		over the ridge said he saw their camp yesterday, about a days ride from here. I reckon
		they'll be riding through here at first light t'morrow."</p>

		<p>As Rebecca headed back to the edge of town, she noticed the
		multitude of women and small children. She had heard the stories about the Caram gang.
		Even children were not safe from those murdering cutthroats. She quickened her pace, and
		her feet protested the abuse. Her shoes were better than the boots, but still pained her
		quite a bit.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie came out from behind some trees after making certain that
		Rebecca was alone. "Did you get everything?" She asked as she approached.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Josie, have you heard of the Caram gang?"</p>

		<p>"Not a decent one in the lot from what I hear," she
		said as she took the goods out of Rebecca's hands and began to stash it in her saddlebags.</p>

		<p>"They're going to ride into Mason's Gulch tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"Then I think we'd better put some distance between us and
		Mason's Gulch before the sun goes down," the gunslinger said as she tightened the
		strap on the saddlebag. Rebecca stared at her thunderstruck, unable to believe any woman
		could be so callous about the lives of innocent people. Josie stared back until the
		younger woman at last looked away. Rebecca turned on her heel, and marched off toward
		town.</p>

		<p>"Where are you going?" the outlaw asked.</p>

		<p>Without turning back Rebecca replied, "I'm going to do what
		I can to help those people." </p>

		<p>"You'll just get yourself killed, and that's no help to
		anyone," Josie said sharply.</p>

		<p>Rebecca paused and said over her shoulder, "Maybe so. But at
		least I will have tried." She started up again and had gone several yards down the
		road when Josie called after her. </p>

		<p>"What are their defenses?" Josie couldn't see the smile
		that lit up Rebecca's face because she looked very serious by the time she turned around
		and came back to where the gunslinger stood.</p>

		<p>"I heard the sheriff say that they don't think they can
		stand up to the gang. Josie, there's children in that town. Those killers won't
		care."</p>

		<p>"What makes you think I do?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know." Rebecca stared into the blue eyes of
		the outlaw. This time it was Josie who broke the eye contact; it was too unnerving.
		"I guess I just don't think you would let small children die."</p>

		<p>"If I go into that town, they'll hang me from a rope before
		sundown."</p>

		<p>"No they won't. Josie, you're their only hope. Come into
		town with me. We'll meet with the townsfolk. I'm sure they'll want your help."</p>

		<p>"I can't go into town, Rebecca. It's too dangerous. Do you
		know what they'll do to you if they find out you're with me?"</p>

		<p>"If the Caram gang destroys this town, Chancetown is next.
		They have to listen to me. I have an idea. Stay here." Rebecca turned and ran back to
		town, ignoring the still burning ache in her overused leg muscles and the sting of her
		blistered feet.</p>

		<p>"This had better be good," Josie muttered to herself as
		she went back into the cover of the trees. A thin smile crept to her lips as she realized
		that her clever companion had once again bamboozled her.</p>

		<p>If there was one thing that the outlaw hated, it was waiting.
		Almost an hour passed before she heard the sound of jingling harness and crept out of the
		cover of the trees to see who it was. Rebecca was directing the driver of the buckboard
		toward the clump of trees where Josie waited, and a second man rode in the bed of the
		wagon. Josie remained in the bushes, although her senses told her that the trio was more
		likely to be in fear of her than to pose any threat to her. Neither man was armed; the one
		with the badge pinned to his chest wore a holster, but it was empty. The older man did not
		look as if he had ever handled a gun in his life.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" Rebecca called as she peered at the thick
		brush, looking for the dark clad woman. Several nervous seconds passed before the
		gunslinger stepped out into the open, her hands resting on the handles of her guns.
		"Good, I knew you'd wait. This is Mayor McGregor," she motioned toward the
		portly man on her left. He nodded nervously. "And this is Tom Glance, the sheriff of
		Mason's Gulch."</p>

		<p>"Ma'am," Tom acknowledged her with a tip of his hat.
		Josie nodded at each of the men. The sheriff had taken a great chance coming out here
		unarmed to meet a known killer, and to top it off was also polite and respectful.
		"Sheriff. I understand that you require assistance in keeping the Caram gang out of
		your town. I'm willing to do what I can to help, but I need certain assurances before I
		do."</p>

		<p>"Anything. We ain't rich or nothin', but we kin give ya
		whatever we got."</p>

		<p>"All I need is oats for my horse and some salt pork."</p>

		<p>"That's all?" Tom looked at her incredulously. It made
		no sense to him that this outlaw didn't mention money. Of course he wasn't about to bring
		it up. Josie realized what he was thinking and gave a feral grin.</p>

		<p>"Little man, if what I wanted was your town's money there'd
		be nothing left for that band of killers tomorrow." She fingered the butt of her gun.
		Satisfied that they had reached an understanding of sorts, Josie whistled for Phoenix.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Despite grumbling from some of the townsfolk about "that
		damned fool woman's hare brained plan," Josie was able to get them into position
		before daybreak. At both ends of the main street leading into and out of town men waited
		with wagons positioned ready to move them to prevent the gang's escape. On the rooftops
		over looking the street the younger men and women who didn't know how to use guns were
		stationed with bottles filled with coal oil and sulfur matches. If Josie and the other
		armed people could not stop them, the plan was to toss the flaming bottles into their
		midst. Josie hoped it didn't come to that, since the flames could just as easily consume
		the buildings that were dry as tinder. Once the preparations were in order, all they could
		do was wait. Josie remained perched on top of a building, her eyes constantly scanning
		both the street below and the vast expanse of land beyond the edge of town. Rebecca
		willingly agreed to stay back in the jailhouse and wait for her. Josie didn't trust the
		town's only saloon to be a safe place for the young prairie girl.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Two hours after sunup a small cloud of dust on the horizon
		heralded the approach of the Caram gang. Josie gave the hand signal for the others to be
		ready. As she expected the gang moved casually, expecting easy pickings from the small,
		isolated town.</p>

		<p>All the townsfolk remained hidden as the twenty men rode into the
		town. Josie kept the leader within the sight of her Winchester. Once the last outlaw was
		past the wagons, Josie let out a piercing Cherokee war cry. The sound had the desired
		effect. The Caram gang was momentarily confused as they looked for the source of the
		sound. At the same time, the townsfolk moved the wagons, blocking the exits. Rifle barrels
		protruded from the windows of every shop in town, effectively surrounding the gang. John
		Caram, the leader of the group, glared at Josie as he realized the trap.</p>

		<p>"Woman! You've made a mistake. You think we're going to let
		a handful of farmers and a squaw stop us?" He reached for his sidearm; Josie fired
		once, striking him cleanly in the right shoulder. His gun flew from his hand as he howled
		in rage and pain.</p>

		<p>"Anyone else want some lead plums?" she taunted as she
		took aim again, this time at Caram's head. "I suggest you have your men lower their
		weapons unless you all want to shake hands with Saint Peter before nightfall."</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched the entire proceedings from the safety of the
		sheriff's office. She had been standing in the doorway until the sound of the rifle fire
		sent her scurrying under the desk. She only came out when she heard the joyous cheers of
		the townspeople. Stepping out of the building, she was startled by a strong hand clamping
		around her mouth and pulling her into the alley. Rebecca struggled briefly before she
		realized that it was Josie who had grabbed her.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I need you to get the supplies promised me and
		bring them to the glen about a mile west of here," Josie said as she released the
		girl from her grasp. </p>

		<p>"But...."</p>

		<p>"You think that sheriff is going to really let me go?
		There's a one thousand dollar price on my head."</p>

		<p>"But you helped to save the town..." she protested.</p>

		<p>"They don't care about that now. I served a purpose for
		them, now they'll think of the money. I have to get out of here. If you don't want to get
		it for me, that's fine." She turned to walk away. Rebecca reached up and grabbed her
		arm.</p>

		<p>"Josie, I'll be there. Leave me the horse we got from those
		men to carry it with and I'll get the things you were promised." Rebecca watched the
		stoic face looking for any kind of acknowledgment that her words had been heard. The
		outlaw walked away, not certain whether she would ever see the runaway again.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="9: A Good Deed Rewarded">
		<p>Josie heard her approaching. Moving from her cover in the trees,
		she reached the young woman and took the reins of the heavily laden horse from her hand.
		She counted the sacks of grain and salt pork, and realized that there was quite a bit more
		than she had expected. </p>

		<p>"Where did you get all this? This is twice what I asked
		for." </p>

		<p>"They wanted you to have it as their way of saying
		thanks."</p>

		<p>"You're lying." The blue eyes narrowed as her hand
		reached for her sidearm. Rebecca's eyes went wide with fear.</p>

		<p>"N-no, I swear. They wanted me to take some money and other
		supplies, but I thought you would be mad, so I refused. I told them that all you wanted
		was the oats and pork, so they insisted on giving more than the original agreement,"
		Rebecca said as she silently prayed that the outlaw would believe her.</p>

		<p>Josie searched the face in the pale moonlight. As always, there
		was no hint of deception or betrayal. "Did anyone follow you?"</p>

		<p>"No. I left town heading east, then doubled back."</p>

		<p>"Good." Josie removed the supplies from the back of the
		horse and opened one of the sacks of grain. She filled a feed bag for her mare, and put a
		heap on the ground for the little horse who worked so hard to carry it. With her back
		turned, the outlaw couldn't see the beaming smile on the young woman's face.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" Rebecca asked as she settled into her bedroll.</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you didn't get hurt today. That was a very brave
		thing you did."</p>

		<p>"All I did was shoot a man who deserved it," Josie said
		dismissing it.</p>

		<p>"No." Rebecca sat up and looked across the fire at the
		tall woman. "Today you did the right thing. You stood up with people that you didn't
		know and protected them from a gang of outlaws bent on destroying their town. Josie, if
		you hadn't left, they would have told you themselves how thankful they were."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's not that simple."</p>

		<p>"Yes...it is just that simple, Josie. Today you did the
		right thing. How long has it been since you've done that? Each day it will get a little
		easier."</p>

		<p>"Go to sleep...before I shoot you." Josie growled as
		she rolled away from the fire.</p>

		<p>"Good night Josie," she said softly before laying back
		down. She refused to take the gruff threat as anything more than her newfound friend being
		grouchy.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="10: The Wrong Place At The Wrong Time">
		<p>After a breakfast of salt pork and coffee they set out Southwest,
		away from their pasts and toward an uncertain future. Josie rode upon Phoenix while
		Rebecca walked alongside leading the little mare and telling tales of life on the plains.
		The outlaw listened half-heartedly, her senses trained to listen and look for signs of
		trouble. Her intuition had never failed her before and the sudden prickling of the hairs
		on her neck made her pull the horse to a stop and motion for the prairie girl to be
		silent. Her ice blue eyes scanned the horizon, catching the almost imperceptible sight of
		a rifle barrel poking out from behind a rock. Josie extracted her Winchester from its
		scabbard and dismounted in one fluid motion.</p>

		<p>"Behind that rock. Now!" she ordered, keeping her rifle
		focused on the sniper. Rebecca had just made it behind the rock when a single shot rang
		out. She kept her head down out of fear.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" she called again, this time louder.</p>

		<p>"I'm here. Stay where you are," she hollered back. She
		looked down at her injured leg. The bullet had entered at mid thigh and there was no sign
		of an exit wound. Using her elbow and her uninjured leg Josie scrabbled around the rock
		and collapsed at Rebecca's side.</p>

		<p>"You're hurt!" The young woman exclaimed. Without
		warning, Josie twisted and brought the rifle up, aiming slightly above the head of the
		distant gunman, causing the small pile of rocks above him to shake violently. The hammer
		clicked on an empty chamber, and Josie ducked back down behind the rock, pulling shells
		out of her gunbelt as she did. </p>

		<p>"We have to get out of here," Rebecca said </p>

		<p>"If we move now, we'll be dead before we can reach
		Phoenix." She looked down at the blood that had soaked her pant leg and begun to pool
		on the ground. "But you're right, we can't stay here much longer." She opened
		the chamber of the rifle and filled it with bullets. A flip of the lever and the rifle was
		ready to go. Josie spared a quick look at her new friend. "If anything happens, I
		want you to take the horses and get out of here."</p>

		<p>"Josie, nothin-"</p>

		<p>"If anything does, take the horses and go." The tone in
		her voice made it clear that this was not open for discussion. Rebecca nodded mutely. The
		outlaw gave her one last look before pivoting and firing at the potential rockslide. Her
		left index finger worked the trigger as her right hand pulled the lever again and again.
		The quick succession of bullets freed the rocks, sending them tumbling. The man let out a
		bloodcurdling scream as the granite rained down on him, and then all was silence. </p>

		<p>"Get the gauze from the saddlebag," Josie said to the
		girl, and Rebecca ran to do her bidding. The outlaw untied the bandanna around her neck,
		and when Rebecca returned she handed it to her. "Tie this around my leg above the
		wound. It'll slow the flow of blood." Rebecca did as she asked, but the sight of so
		much blood made her feel queasy. "Now put the gauze over the wound..." she broke
		off at the look on Rebecca's face. It looked as if the girl was about to faint. </p>

		<p>"Josie, we have to get you to a doctor!" Rebecca said
		frantically as she tried to help the outlaw to her feet. Using the smaller woman for
		leverage, she climbed on top of the boulder that moments before had been their hiding
		place, and whistled for Phoenix. The mare trotted to her side, and using her powerful
		arms, Josie pulled herself into the saddle. </p>

		<p>"Climb up on that rock and then get up behind me,"
		Josie said to Rebecca, whose face was still unnaturally white. Rebecca did as she was
		told, and a moment later was settled behind the wounded gunslinger. "Hold tight to my
		waist. If it seems like I'm about to pass out, give me a good squeeze so I don't fall out
		of the saddle."</p>

		<p>"But I'm not strong enough to keep you..."</p>

		<p>"Don't worry; you won't have to keep me up here. I'm just
		afraid I might forget where I am or let go, and you can keep me focussed." Rebecca
		tightened her grip so much she thought her arms would fall off from the pressure, but it
		was enough to keep the gunslinger fairly upright in the saddle.</p>

		<p>They rode the rest of the day and night stopping only long enough
		to give the horses a much-needed drink and a few minutes of rest. They arrived just before
		daybreak at a small ranch. Smoke already curled from the chimney so Josie didn't need to
		rouse the house. Sure enough, before they had even come to a stop, a small woman with dark
		hair came out of the house holding a rather menacing rifle. The scowl on her face
		dissolved into a huge grin when she recognized her visitor. "Josie!" she boomed.</p>

		<p>"Hello, Belle. It's been a long time," the outlaw said
		as she nudged Phoenix to a stop just beyond the porch rail. Without waiting for an
		introduction, Rebecca slid off the horse as if she had been doing it all her life and said
		to the woman with the rifle, "She's wounded. Help me get her down from there."
		In her excitement at seeing her old friend Belle had not even noticed the pallor of her
		cheeks, or that Josie's left pant leg was completely soaked with blood as was Phoenix's
		left flank. Rebecca's words galvanized her into action, and she jumped off the porch and
		ran to Josie's side.</p>

		<p>"Put your arms around my neck," she instructed the
		gunslinger. "And you, blondie, carefully lift her leg over the saddle, and then take
		hold of both her legs." Josie leaned down as instructed and wrapped her arms around
		the stout woman's neck. Rebecca was almost afraid to touch Josie's wounded leg, but she
		did not want to rile the feisty Belle so she did as she was told. In a few moments they
		had Josie on the ground between them, her arms draped over their shoulders. They hobbled
		into the house and with a nod Belle said, "Bring her to that room over there."</p>

		<p>Unwilling to let go of the injured woman to grasp the doorknob,
		Belle simply gave the door a kick. It opened to reveal a plain bedroom with a bureau, a
		wash basin, and a pitcher. The two women maneuvered Josie to the side of the bed and laid
		her down as gently as they could. Josie's teeth were clenched against the pain, and tears
		welled up in her eyes as Belle worked the boot off her foot. Belle glanced up at the young
		blonde who stood frozen at the head of the bed. "There's whiskey in a jug in the
		kitchen. Fetch that and a glass." With a nod, Rebecca made her way across the room.
		Before she was out of earshot, Belle added, "Oh, and some cloth. Enough to clean her
		up and to use for a bandage. It's in a chest in the kitchen. And when you're through with
		that, draw some water from the well and put it on to boil." She took a pair of
		scissors from a sewing box on top of the bureau and proceeded to cut the ruined trousers
		off the wounded gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Those are my best drawers," Josie complained.</p>

		<p>Belle guffawed. "Not any more, they ain't." Rebecca
		came into the room with her arms full of white cloth, a whiskey jug and glass in her
		hands. She was just in time to see Belle peel back the fabric she had cut from around the
		wound, which had begun to bleed afresh.</p>

		<p>"Oh!" Rebecca gasped and turned away from the sight of
		the blood. When she and Josie were on the way to Belle's she was able to deal with the
		gore because she had to, but now that someone else was there to take care of her friend,
		Rebecca seemed to lose her nerve. Her face paled, and she thought for a moment she would
		be sick. "I can't...I don't think...I'm sorry, I think I'm going to be sick."</p>

		<p>"Well then take it out of here, girl," Belle said, a
		bit more gruffly than she had intended. "Just leave the things, and go do something
		useful." She poured a healthy dollop of whiskey in the glass and handed it to Josie,
		who swigged half of it in one gulp.</p>

		<p>"Take care of the horses," Josie said to Rebecca's
		retreating back. "And don't worry; this old harridan will take good care of me."</p>

		<p>"I know. But I wish I could help..." She hazarded a
		glance at Josie, making sure to look only at her face and not at the bloody mess of her
		leg. Josie gave her a wan smile and tipped her glass toward the little blonde before
		finishing off her whiskey. </p>

		<p>"Bring me that water when it's hot and leave it outside the
		door," Belle asked. </p>

		<p>By the time Rebecca finished brushing down and settling the
		horses, Belle had managed to dig out the bullet and dress the wound. She dressed Josie in
		a long shirt, and the outlaw was finally resting comfortably. Before attempting to remove
		the slug, Belle had given her enough liquor to ensure that she would rest for quite a
		while. She came out of the bedroom to find the young blonde in the kitchen feeding wood to
		the stove.</p>

		<p>"Fire was dying," she said by way of explanation. She
		should not have presumed it was all right to work in someone else's kitchen without asking
		first, but she could not bring herself to go back into the room Josie occupied. </p>

		<p>Belle simply nodded. "What's your name, child?" she
		asked as she closed the door to Josie's room.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca. Is she going to be okay?" Her intense concern
		and fear were evident on her young face. The older woman placed a strong hand on her
		shoulder.</p>

		<p>"She'll be fine in a few weeks. She lost quite a bit of
		blood and the muscles need some time to heal. Come on; let's rustle up something for you
		to eat. Then you can tell me what happened."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, I never caught your name."</p>

		<p>The older woman smiled warmly. "Belle," she said as she
		held out her hand. "Belle Shirley." Her firm grip surprised Rebecca. The woman
		appeared to be the same general age as Josie, but significantly shorter. "This is my
		home."</p>

		<p>She showed Rebecca around the small but neat ranch house. There
		were three rooms, all made up for sleeping. One was obviously Belle's; the other two
		appeared to have no occupants. There was nothing of a personal nature in either room. It
		was one of those rooms that now housed the injured outlaw. A small eating area doubled as
		the main room. "Excuse me for asking, but if you live here alone, why so many
		sleeping rooms?"</p>

		<p>Belle let out a deep belly laugh that shook her whole body.
		"It's not because I enjoy company, girl. Many persons who have...shall we say...run
		afoul of the law have found a need to hide out here for a while." She looked over at
		the door to Josie's room. "Many have come here for the same reason as her. We can't
		always trust a local doctor to tend to our wounds properly, especially once he finds out
		that we're wanted. Many of them would just as soon poison us as heal us. We've had to
		learn how to take care of our own injuries."</p>

		<p>"And you keep this place so they have a place to go."</p>

		<p>"Yes. So far the law hasn't found us out." She went
		into the small kitchen and heated up some stewed beef in an enameled tin pot. "Only a
		few of us know this place. Josie must really trust you to bring you along here." She
		looked at the young woman again, appraising her from head to toe. "What do you do for
		her, girl? You don't look like a gunfighter and you're too innocent to be something
		else."</p>

		<p>"Well, we've only been traveling together a few days. So far
		I haven't done anything for her except get her into trouble." </p>

		<p>Belle smiled warmly and put her arm around the younger woman.
		"It's been many a year since this place has had any laughter. Tell me a funny story
		while I make us some fresh buttermilk biscuits to go with this stew."</p>

		<p>"Mmm!" she licked her lips unconsciously. "For
		fresh biscuits I'll tell you every story I know." She sat down on a high stool and
		proceeded to rattle off several fanciful tales of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys,
		Paul Revere, and other heroes of the Revolutionary War. Belle listened intently, learning
		more than she ever knew about that period of American history. Rebecca's voice was
		animated, every word full of emotion. Her hands moved in tune with her mouth, illustrating
		different points within her stories.</p>

		<p>"You tell your stories very well, child," Belle said as
		she served up a bowl of stew for each of them.</p>

		<p>"Oh, if you don't mind, I'd like to feed Josie first, then
		eat."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, she's not going to know if you eat first."</p>

		<p>"But I'll know," she said quietly. Belle looked at her
		inquisitively for a moment before turning back to the pot and ladling out another bowl of
		stew.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="11: The Calm Port">
		<p>Rebecca helped Josie sit up and eat, filling the air with a
		constant chatter the whole time. She discovered quickly that the outlaw was quite
		interested in history and proceeded to tell the story of the Boston Tea Party. When she
		noticed the blue eyes fighting to stay awake, she moved closer and spoke in lower tones.
		The soft voice had the desired effect. Within minutes, Josie was sound asleep. Rebecca
		lingered a while longer, enjoying the opportunity to see the outlaw unguarded and
		vulnerable. She <img src="starr1.gif" alt="Belle Starr" align="right" width="166" height="299"/>brushed a stray
		lock of black hair away from the older woman's face. </p>

		<p>"She'd break your hand if she saw that." Rebecca jumped
		out of her seat and turned to see Belle standing in the doorway. </p>

		<p>"I didn't...I mean I...." </p>

		<p>"Relax, child. Just giving you a warning. I've known Josie
		for many years now, and touching just isn't something she's good at." </p>

		<p>"What do you know about her? I mean, it's not like she's
		much for girl talk or anything," they both chuckled quietly. </p>

		<p>"I think whatever Josie wants you to know about her, she'll
		tell. I make it a point not to talk about other people, especially when they can shoot as
		well as her." She waited until Rebecca nodded in understanding. "Now, she ain't
		gonna be able to help out around here for a while, so you're going to help out for her.
		Right now I think we should get some rest. Tomorrow will be a busy day." </p>

		<p>And tomorrow was a busy day, as were the days after that. Belle
		put the young woman to work mending fences and tending to the horses. In the evening,
		Rebecca would pull buckets of water from the well to use for cooking and cleaning. At
		night, she would eat dinner with Josie and tell her more stories about the war of
		independence. </p>

		<p>"...and then General Arnold moved his troops north..."
		</p>

		<p>"Why did you stay?" Josie interrupted. Rebecca looked
		at her for a moment, as if not understanding the question. </p>

		<p>"I stayed because you're my friend. Friends do that for one
		another, you know." </p>

		<p>There was a long silence as Josie turned her head to stare at a
		knot on the wall. Rebecca sat there silently, unsure of what to say or if she should leave
		or not. "Thank you," the outlaw finally said quietly. Her face was an unreadable
		mask. </p>

		<p>"Well, um..." Rebecca stood up and rubbed her hands on
		the front of her dress as she tried not to let her happiness at the thanks show.
		"Guess it's time to turn in. Tomorrow's gonna be a busy day," she unconsciously
		rubbed her aching forearms. </p>

		<p>"If you rub liniment into it, it won't hurt as much,"
		Josie said. She received a warm smile for her efforts. </p>

		<p>"Thanks." Without thinking about it, Rebecca leaned
		forward and gave the outlaw a quick hug. "Good night." She felt Josie stiffen
		and make no effort to return the embrace. "Sorry." </p>

		<p>"It's all right, Rebecca. I'm just not a touchy-feely kind
		of person, that's all." She fixed her blue eyes on a knot on the wall for a moment.
		"Don't forget to rub liniment on those muscles," she added softly. </p>

		<p>"I won't forget. Good night." As she left the room
		Rebecca smiled from ear to ear. They had actually spoken kind words to one another. She
		had called Josie a friend and the outlaw had looked for a moment as if she were going to
		respond in kind. The young woman took it as a very good sign indeed. </p>

	<chapter title="12: Lessons">
		<p>"If you're gonna ride with Josie, you need to learn some
		things. You do want to be helpful, don't you?", Belle said as she handed the young
		woman a mug of coffee. </p>

		<p>"Anything, name it. I'll learn anything," Rebecca said
		enthusiastically. </p>

		<p>"How are you at sewing?" She almost laughed at the
		stricken look on the blonde girl's face. </p>

		<p>"I can't sew to save my soul." </p>

		<p>"Well, you're gonna learn, my dear. Wounds need to be
		stitched, not to mention clothing. A neat row of small, tight stitches helps to prevent
		infection and disease. Now you wouldn't want Josie to go through life with a jagged scar
		'cause you didn't stitch it right, now would you?", Belle said as she rose and pulled
		out a small sewing basket from under the counter. </p>

		<p>"No, of course not." She looked at the materials being
		laid out in front of her with trepidation. "But you mean I'd have to actually do
		that...put a needle...into her skin?", she paled at the thought. </p>

		<p>"Just think of it as soft leather." She placed a needle
		in Rebecca's hand. "Now let's get started." </p>

		<p>An hour later, Rebecca held up a two small pieces of leather sewn
		together. Belle took it from her and held it up to the light. She shook her head.
		"Does that seam look straight to you?" Before Rebecca could even reply she
		pulled a small knife from her belt and cut the threads apart. "Try again, and this
		time pay attention to the seam, not just the stitches." </p>

		<p>Hours later an extremely frustrated Rebecca handed Belle her
		latest effort, fully expecting it to be pulled apart again. The older woman went through
		her usual routine to inspect it. "Not bad. Quite an improvement over when we began,
		now wouldn't you say?" she added as she handed it back to the young woman. Rebecca
		turned it over in her hands, noting that it did indeed look better than her first
		attempts. Belle collected the loose materials and put them back in the basket.
		"Starting tomorrow, you practice your stitching for one hour each morning and one
		hour each night. Work on straight seams and jagged ones. Mend your clothing to fit you
		properly. If I see one seam out of line, I'll tear the whole thing apart and make you
		start over." </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>After a week Josie was up on her feet and starting to feel a bit
		anxious to leave. With the aid of a cane she walked over to her window and looked out.
		Rebecca was sitting under a tree, taking advantage of the afternoon shade. The outlaw's
		keen eyes picked out that the young woman was sewing, all of her attention on her task. A
		soft knock on the door interrupted her. "Come in, Belle." Belle was pleased to
		see Josie on her feet. She could not help but notice that the gunslinger's eyes were
		riveted on the attractive young blonde out in the yard. </p>

		<p>"She's pretty spunky, that one," Belle said with a
		chuckle. "Been practicing her stitching all the time." She walked up behind the
		outlaw and joined her in watching the young woman. "She's trying to impress
		you." </p>

		<p>"She's afraid I'm going to leave her behind somewhere."
		</p>

		<p>"Are you?" Hearing no answer, Belle continued.
		"How long has she been traveling with you?" </p>

		<p>"Not long. This isn't a permanent arrangement." </p>

		<p>"Well, it don't hurt none for her to know how to stitch
		people up." </p>

		<p>Josie moved from the window back to the bed. "Nope, I don't
		suppose it does." </p>

		<p>Even though Belle offered her the use of the other unoccupied
		bedroom, Rebecca preferred to sleep on a pallet on the floor in Josie's room, explaining
		that she wanted to be close in case Josie needed something. She was awakened one night by
		the sounds of the tall woman thrashing about in her bed. When Josie cried out as if in
		pain, Rebecca leapt to her feet and groped her way to the bed in the darkness. </p>

		<p>"Nooo," Josie moaned as she violently shook her head
		from side to side. Without hesitation, Rebecca climbed up onto the bed with the outlaw.
		She slid her arm under her shoulder and pulled Josie's head to her chest. Gently she ran
		her hand over Josie's sweat drenched forehead and hair, and softly she began to sing.
		</p>

		<p>Belle was also wakened by the sounds of the gunslinger, but she
		immediately recognized it for the nightmare it was. Josie had always been plagued by
		nightmares, often times calling out in remembered pain long into the night. Belle
		considered going to see if there was something she could do, when she heard the sweet
		strains of 'Beautiful Dreamer' in a clear and beautiful voice. The sounds of Josie's
		nightmare were no longer audible; with a smile Belle relaxed back onto her own bed,
		listening to the young girl sing. </p>

		<p>When Josie's breathing was once again deep and even and her brow
		no longer furrowed, Rebecca eased herself out from under the sleeping woman. She actually
		hated to leave the comforting warmth of Josie's body, but she was afraid she would fall
		asleep herself, and the thought of what Josie would do if she found her there was enough
		to send her back to her pallet on the floor. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>After healing from her gunshot wound, Josie helped Belle mend the
		roof and do other repairs around the small ranch. Every so often Rebecca would come into
		view, usually caring for one of the horses or hauling buckets of water. The outlaw noted
		that not once had she heard her young companion complain of all the hard labor. </p>

		<p>Rebecca worked as hard as she could, trying to prove to both
		women that she was capable of pulling her own weight. Belle was more forthcoming with the
		compliments, but it was the rare look of approval in Josie's face that encouraged her to
		continue on when her limbs ached and her muscles screamed. The liberal amounts of liniment
		helped, but only slightly. </p>

		<p>The extra time devoted to practicing her stitches showed in
		Rebecca's newly tailored clothes. Knowing that she would be expected to wear pants if she
		wanted to ride double with Josie, she determined to make the clothes that they had taken
		from the dead man fit her as well as Josie's fit her. She succeeded more than she would
		have imagined. She no longer had to push her sleeves up just to see her hands. Her
		britches were now the right length and no longer required a belt to stay up. There was no
		mistaking the pride in her face when she showed off her outfit for the first time. </p>

		<p>"Wonderful, Rebecca," Belle said as she inspected the
		seams. "When you first picked up the needle you couldn't stitch a straight line. Now
		look what you've done. Child, you can do anything you set your mind to if you only
		try." </p>

		<p>Rebecca looked over to Josie. "Better," was all the
		outlaw said, but the small smile on her face spoke much more. The smile that swept across
		the young blonde woman's face remained there for the rest of the day as she went about her
		chores. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="13: Parting">
		<p>"Where are you headed?", Belle asked as she watched
		Josie saddle Phoenix. The early morning heat hung in the air, promising a scorcher of a
		day ahead. The gunslinger wiped her brow with her bandanna. </p>

		<p>"Tombstone; you know that little mining town not far from
		here." Belle nodded. Josie looked around to make sure Rebecca wasn't nearby then
		leaned in close and spoke quietly. "She'll be safe enough there." </p>

		<p>"She's been getting stronger, ya know. Working so hard here
		and all. She's a good talker, unlike someone we know," her eyes twinkled at the scowl
		from Josie. "That little sprite's got a strong heart." </p>

		<p>"I'm not changing my mind, Belle." </p>

		<p>Josie turned her attention back to tightening straps and checking
		the fit of the bridle. Belle looked out and caught sight of the young blonde heading their
		way. "She's coming, Josie." She turned to look at her dark headed friend.
		"That girl has worked her rear off trying to impress you while you healed and now
		you're just gonna dump her like a sack of mealy flour?" </p>

		<p>"Belle," she sighed. "Just how safe do you think
		it would be for a young innocent girl like that to be following me all over the place? All
		it'll mean to her is an early death...or worse." She took the reins and led the horse
		out of the stall. She had already packed their supplies on the smaller horse, and she
		gathered up her lead rope as well as she walked from the stable. She turned back to Belle
		and said, "Don't say anything to her." Belle nodded. She knew Josie would do
		what she thought was best, regardless of anything she might say or do. </p>

		<p>"Ready?", Rebecca asked expectantly as she watched the
		outlaw exit the stable, Belle close behind her. Josie mounted and held her hand out,
		pulling the young woman up effortlessly behind her. </p>

		<p>"Hang on," she said before nudging Phoenix into a trot,
		giving a short wave to the sharpshooter as they pulled out of sight. Rebecca turned her
		head and caught a sad look on Belle's face. As she waved, the prairie girl swore she saw
		the sharpshooter's lips form the words 'take care of her'. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="14: Girl Talk">
		<p>They rode in silence for five hours before Josie decided to take
		a break. Finding a shady area, she pulled Phoenix to a stop and helped Rebecca down before
		dismounting herself. Removing the saddlebag that held the stash of food that Belle packed
		for them, Josie walked over and sat down with her back supported by a large tree.
		"She packed enough food for an army," she quipped as Rebecca sat across from her
		and took the offered piece of jerky. She looked at the eagerness with which the young
		woman was eating the dried strip of meat. Rebecca looked up and saw a twinkle in the light
		blue eyes and a slight smile tugging at the gunslinger's lips. She rolled her eyes and
		Josie chuckled, dissipating the tension that always seemed to be present around them.
		Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad having her around, the gunslinger thought as she passed the
		canteen of water to her. A momentary pang of lost innocence tugged at her and Josie let
		the thought pass from her mind. Once they got to Tombstone, Rebecca would just have to
		find someone else to take care of her, that was all there was to it, she thought.
		Oblivious to the outlaw's internal struggle, Rebecca chattered away while she ate.
		"You know," she said as she shoved a piece of bread in her mouth, "you
		could always become a bounty hunter." </p>

		<p>"A bounty hunter?" Josie spat contemptuously.
		"They're the lowest form of life on the earth. Nothing but money hungry murderers
		who'd kill ya as soon as look at ya." She pulled a hunk of bread off of the loaf and
		put it in her mouth. </p>

		<p>"It's a perfectly 'legal' profession," Rebecca urged,
		pulling her head back slightly when she saw Josie's eyes narrow at her inflection of
		'legal'. "I mean, uh, that you could make money that way, and you'd probably be able
		to get pardons if you catch someone big enough." </p>

		<p>Too fast for Rebecca to react, Josie moved forward, closing the
		distance between them until all that the young woman could see was the deepness of her
		blue eyes, which were flaring. "You want me to hunt down people that I used to ride
		with? To help the law when all they want to do is see me hanging from a noose?"
		</p>

		<p>"And why would they want to do that to you, Josie?" She
		took a deep breath in fear of going too far for the temperamental outlaw. "Perhaps if
		you tried to help make the world a little better, like you did in Mason's Gulch, maybe
		they wouldn't be so quick to wrap a rope around your neck." </p>

		<p>A long silence passed between them before Josie leaned back
		against the tree. "It's easier to rob trains," she said casually, not realizing
		that she had fallen into the trap set by the young woman. </p>

		<p>"Uh huh, but think about this...people don't usually shoot
		at you when you bring another criminal into town. They look at you as a hero, not a
		villain. Besides, think of how much fun it would be to put some of your enemies behind
		bars." The faraway look in the outlaw's eyes told her that she had found an opening.
		"All those who betrayed you, who hurt women and children and are still running
		around; wouldn't you like to see them get what they deserve?" </p>

		<p>Just when Rebecca thought she had Josie right where she wanted
		her, the outlaw looked at her and spoke calmly. "I don't care. As long as they stay
		out of my way, I'll stay out of theirs." She shrugged her shoulders and continued to
		eat. Josie's features hid her amusement at the scowl on the younger woman's face. Rebecca
		decided that the rest of the meal would be a silent affair while she thought up a new
		plan. No matter how hard the outlaw tried to be rough and mean, the young woman knew deep
		down inside she was a kind and gentle person who could and would do the right thing if
		given the chance. As the day wore on and they were once again on their way, Rebecca's mind
		filled with questions that she wanted to ask but didn't dare. What caused Josie to become
		a criminal in the first place? Did she have a family? Time passed quickly as both women
		remained lost in their own thoughts. Josie concentrated on the words exchanged during
		dinner. </p>

		<p>When darkness settled across the land, Josie pulled off the dirt
		trail and found a suitable area for bunking down for the night. The gunslinger
		concentrated on cleaning her weapons and sharpening her knives while Rebecca tried out her
		sewing skills by mending a tear in her blanket while reciting more of her story about
		Benedict Arnold before moving on to Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys. Josie
		half-listened, nodding occasionally but doing nothing to discourage the conversation. When
		it came time for sleep, the women laid their blankets out on the ground on opposite sides
		of the fire. "Good night, Josie," she said before letting out a long yawn. She
		closed her eyes, not expecting an answer. </p>

		<p>"Good night, Rebecca," the outlaw answered softly.
