	<chapter title="40: Moving On">
		<p>Josie was wakened by the sunlight streaming through the window.
		Rebecca&#146;s head was on Josie&#146;s shoulder, her arm was tossed over her chest and
		her leg draped over her thigh, just like most mornings of late. The thing that made this
		morning different was that they were both naked. Josie cupped her hand around the soft
		globe of Rebecca&#146;s behind and pulled her even closer. Her skin tingled where
		Rebecca&#146;s naked flesh pressed against her own, and she shuddered involuntarily as she
		remembered the passion they had shared the previous night. She softly kissed the top of
		Rebecca&#146;s head, marveling at the depth of feeling the little blonde awakened in her.
		She might have lain there longer but she heard the sounds of activity in the house and
		wanted to make sure she caught the brothers before they were out and about. The roof was
		finished and before she and Rebecca could move on they would need some help to get the
		axle put on their wagon.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca. Wake up, sprite. We need to get moving," she
		whispered, and received a mumbled response from the sleeping woman. " Hey,
		sleepyhead. Rise and shine," she said a bit louder, and was rewarded by a glimpse of
		sleepy green eyes.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m up, I&#146;m up," Rebecca said sourly,
		nuzzling her face into Josie&#146;s soft breast.</p>

		<p>"Uh uh, none of that or we&#146;ll never get out of
		bed," Josie said as she reluctantly pulled herself away from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Five minutes," Rebecca pleaded, clinging to the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, baby. I hate to get up too, but we really do need to
		move on. Don&#146;t make it any harder on me&#133;please." Josie extricated herself
		from Rebecca and slid off the edge of the bed before the blonde could grab hold of her
		again. She rummaged through her clothes and began pulling them on as Rebecca watched
		avidly.</p>

		<p>"I sure hate to see you cover up all that beautiful
		skin," Rebecca said with a sigh.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "Only one night and you&#146;re a sex maniac
		already," she said jokingly.</p>

		<p>"You don&#146;t want me to be? A sex maniac, I mean? Because
		it&#146;s your fault if I am, you know. I was an innocent little girl when I met
		you."</p>

		<p>"I want you to be exactly what you are. If that means
		you&#146;re a sex maniac, then I am truly blessed. You&#146;re my beautiful, sexy sprite,
		and if you don&#146;t get out of that bed and put some clothes on, I am going
		to&#133;" she paused and let Rebecca anticipate her words, and then surprised her
		with, "tickle you."</p>

		<p>"No. Not that, please." Josie had tickled her once or
		twice in their time together, and she knew it made Rebecca laugh until she would cry.
		Rebecca threw the covers off and vaulted out of bed. Now it was Josie who admired the form
		before her, but not for long. "Brrr, it&#146;s cold in here," Rebecca
		complained, and she pulled her clothes on so fast her dress was wrong side out and she had
		to take it off and put it on again.</p>

		<p>"C&#146;mere, you. I&#146;ll warm you up," Josie said
		with a grin. Not needing to hear it twice, Rebecca scooted across the room and into
		Josie&#146;s arms. The outlaw rubbed briskly up and down the smaller woman&#146;s back
		several times before pulling her into a bear hug. "Ready to face those old men?"
		She asked playfully.</p>

		<p>"If you won&#146;t come back to bed with me, I might as
		well," Rebecca pouted.</p>

		<p>"Hold that thought until we get out on the prairie where
		nobody will be around to hear you scream when you come," Josie said huskily as she
		nibbled Rebecca&#146;s neck.</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;you&#146;re terrible! You make me get out of bed
		and then you tease me with&#133;" She broke off as she realized what Josie had said.
		"Scream? Did I scream? I didn&#146;t&#133;realize."</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, you screamed all right. Just hearing it was enough
		to make me come with you." Rebecca&#146;s cheeks flushed, and she lowered her eyes in
		embarrassment. She wished she were half as worldly as the woman whom she loved so she
		didn&#146;t find herself behaving like a school girl all the time. Ah well, all in good
		time, she told herself. She also found herself hoping that the old men had been playing
		their music nice and loud when she screamed. "Come on," Josie said dragging her
		out of her reverie, "they&#146;ll be sending out a posse for us pretty soon."
		She took Rebecca&#146;s hand and kissed it, and then led her out of the bedroom.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie pushed back from the table and groaned. She had eaten more
		in the past couple of days since Horace had been cooking than she had in the two weeks
		before that. Rebecca&#146;s cooking was far and away better than her own, but not near as
		good as Horace&#146;s. She would miss the old men and the quiet peaceful life out on the
		farm. Watching as Rebecca washed up the dishes from supper, she pictured her in a kitchen
		of their own on a nice little farm somewhere out west. With Rebecca by her side this was a
		life style she could easily grow accustomed to. But with a price on her head, she feared
		she would always be on the move. Now more than ever she did not want to find herself
		staring down the barrel of some sheriff&#146;s gun. She had Rebecca to take care of, and
		there was no way to do that if she were in jail, or worse. Her reputation as a fast gun
		could also earn her a bullet in the back from a cowardly bounty hunter more interested in
		the reward than concerned with whether he took her out in a fair fight. She shook her head
		to dispel such gloomy thoughts and stood up.</p>

		<p>"Well boys I hate to leave such fine company, but we need to
		be moving on. I promised Rebecca I&#146;d take her to learn from the medicine elders and
		I&#146;d like to get there before the weather turns much colder." Rebecca draped the
		towel over the edge of the dishpan and came to stand beside her lover. She would also miss
		the idyllic life they had been leading, but she knew that as long as she and Josie were
		together it didn&#146;t matter where they were, they would be home.</p>

		<p>"We&#146;re gonna miss you gals," Charles said
		sincerely. "Havin&#146; you here was like&#133;well, almost like havin&#146; Ruth and
		Lillian around. Made me want to take a bath on a Saturday night and get spruced up, and I
		ain&#146;t done that for a lotta years."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Charles, we&#146;re going to miss you too. Both of
		you." She gave first Charles and then Horace a big hug, and then turned and went to
		the bedroom to get their gear so the old men wouldn&#146;t see the tears in her eyes. She
		couldn&#146;t help but think that if her own father had been half the man these gentle
		brothers were, she never would have left home. Never would have followed Josie and learned
		the true depth of love. As miserable as her youth may have been, she would not change a
		day of it if it meant she would not have met Josie. When she returned to the kitchen,
		Josie was shaking hands with Charles and promising that they would stop by again if ever
		they were anywhere close. She turned to see Rebecca coming toward her with their bags.</p>

		<p>"Got everything?" She asked in a gravelly voice that
		almost betrayed her emotions.</p>

		<p>"Yes." Josie took some of the bags from Rebecca and
		started for the door, determined not to cry. She and Horace had hauled the axle up to
		where her wagon had broken down and fixed it early that morning, and she had packed up all
		but their clothes and harnessed the horse right before supper. Now there was nothing to do
		but to get on the road. Josie stowed her bag beneath the canvas tarp after removing her
		gunbelt and strapping it on. She had not worn a gun for almost two weeks, and the weight
		of it almost felt foreign to her. Rebecca came out side with the two brothers on her heels
		and Josie could hear her making the same promise to visit that she had made. She also knew
		that both of them would very much like to keep that promise.</p>

		<p>Josie climbed into the seat and held out her hand to the little
		blonde. Rebecca placed her hand in Josie&#146;s and allowed herself to be drawn into the
		wagon. With a slap of the reins on Flossy&#146;s flanks and a sharp "gee up" the
		women pulled away.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The wagon moved slowly across the trail, the light clip-clop of
		Flossy's hooves against the hardened earth creating a hypnotic rhythm that threatened to
		put Rebecca to sleep. Josie looked over at her lover, shaded from the sun by her soft
		beige hat, the edges dog-eared from age and wear. She watched the way the soft blonde hair
		cascaded out from under the hat to flow gracefully across her shoulders, the warm wind
		sending several strands whipping in the air. Her gaze fell on the soft earlobe, the soft
		sensitive earlobe, she corrected herself. There was a moment the night before when the
		gunslinger swore she was going to send Rebecca over the mountain just by suckling that
		soft piece of flesh. Gone were the road, the fields, and the sky. All that was focused in
		Josie's eyes was the vision of her sprite. Her ears filled with the memories of their
		lovemaking, the moans, the sighs, the whimpers, and the gunslinger's favorite sound, the
		soft cry that Rebecca made just before her world exploded. It was a sound Josie knew she
		would never tire of and would always long to hear. Her visual inspection moved to
		Rebecca&#146;s lips. Those oh so soft lips that begged to be kissed. Those lips that
		parted ever so slightly when Rebecca was sailing under her touch. Those lips that sought
		to return the pleasure as often as possible. Those lips that covered her warm, inviting
		mouth. There was a place Josie never wished to leave, or have leave her. In a short time,
		Rebecca had mastered the art of lovemaking with her mouth. She'd used her lips, tongue,
		and teeth in perfect harmony with each other to bring the gunslinger to a quivering mass
		of bones and flesh.</p>

		<p>The wagon hit a small bump and Rebecca shifted position slightly,
		leaning back against the seat and drawing her hat down over her eyes to keep the sun off.
		Her arms were folded across her body below her breasts, which now had the gunslinger's
		complete attention. Josie licked her lips subconsciously as she undressed the blonde with
		her eyes. Her breasts, those full, soft, sensitive, and oh so responsive breasts. Those
		nipples that hardened with just a look, that sent palpable shockwaves through the young
		woman when they were licked, that never seemed to tire of being played with, much to the
		gunslinger's great joy. Josie felt the familiar stirring deep inside as her desire for
		Rebecca once again welled to the surface, threatening to take control. The gunslinger
		turned her attention reluctantly to the road, searching carefully for any sign of other
		people. The long, flat land stretched out for miles in all directions, satisfying her that
		they were completely alone.</p>

		<p>Josie knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had to have
		Rebecca right then and right there, and she would. She tucked the reins under her leg,
		keeping them nearby just in case. Flossy was well mannered enough or lazy enough to follow
		the trail made by so many previous travelers. That task completed, Josie leaned over and,
		without warning, scooped her half-asleep lover up in her arms and deposited her on her
		lap. Before the startled woman could say a word, her mouth was claimed in a fierce kiss
		that spoke of the gunslinger's need and desire. "I love you, sprite. I love you and I
		have to have you."</p>

		<p>"Mmm," the blonde replied as Josie thoroughly kissed
		her again. Sitting across the gunslinger's lap, Rebecca was completely helpless to her
		wandering hands, a fact that Josie exploited to her full benefit. Her left arm was
		supporting Rebecca&#146;s back while her right arm was roaming up and down Rebecca&#146;s
		body, squeezing firm thighs and buttocks, softly cupping her full breasts. Josie knew
		exactly where the blonde&#146;s nipples were and deliberately avoided them in her
		exploration, knowing that it would drive Rebecca even higher with desire.
		"Josie&#133;" Although surprised by the sudden move onto the gunslinger's lap,
		Rebecca nonetheless willingly surrendered herself to whatever her love wanted. She moaned
		softly as a demanding tongue possessed her mouth, driving away all rational thought. Such
		was what the tall woman did to her. Her touch, the strength of her desire, the absolute
		wholeness of her love overpowered the younger woman&#146;s senses, leaving her weak-kneed
		and helpless, burning with an ache that only Josie could satisfy.</p>

		<p>Tongues danced and dueled within the confines of the young
		woman's mouth while strong, nimble fingers deftly began to unbutton the top of
		Rebecca&#146;s dress. Small fingers dug deep into raven hair in a vain attempt to bring
		them closer. Josie's fingertip drew a slow, sensual line from just below Rebecca&#146;s
		ear to her navel, leaving a trail of goosebumps and excited nerves in its wake. Rebecca
		groaned in protest when the kiss ended, but gasped in pure pleasure when she felt those
		warm lips close around her earlobe. "J-Josie &#133;mmm&#133;don't you think we
		should&#133;ooh&#133;stop&#133;for a while? Oh..." Every flicker of the gunslinger's
		tongue against her sensitive lobe sent jolts of pleasure through her body to pool between
		her legs.</p>

		<p>"No," Josie replied as she pulled her lips away for a
		moment to whisper into Rebecca&#146;s ear, smiling when she saw and felt the younger woman
		shudder at the huskiness of her voice. "I don't want to stop&#133;anything."
		Josie licked her ear to prove her point. "You really don't want me to stop, do
		you?" She said, grinning at the vigorous shake of the blonde head. "Hmm, I
		didn't think so." She rewarded Rebecca&#146;s answer by continuing to unbutton the
		bodice of her dress and reaching inside to cup the left breast, her thumb lazily rubbing
		back and forth against the hardened nipple. "Very nice, sprite&#133;I love the way
		your body responds to my touch." She had no doubt that her young love was dripping
		with passion and the thought only served to increase the trickle between her own legs.</p>

		<p>"Unngh&#133;I love&#133;your touch," Rebecca moaned as
		her hips started to rock.</p>

		<p>"Hmm&#133;so it would seem," Josie said before bringing
		her mouth down to taste the sweetness of Rebecca&#146;s lips again. The kiss turned from
		gentle to passionate to searing to completely out of control as the gunslinger's fingers
		squeezed and fondled Rebecca&#146;s painfully erect nipple. They came up for air and Josie
		leaned back in her seat, pulling the young woman's head against her chest as both fought
		to regain the senses that the kiss had completely decimated.</p>

		<p>"Stand up," Josie said softly, stilling the movement of
		her hand on the younger woman's back.</p>

		<p>"You've got to be kidding," Rebecca murmured, bringing
		her own hand from around the gunslinger's neck and cupping her right breast through the
		black shirt. "You don't really expect me to be able to move, do you?"</p>

		<p>Josie let her play for a few moments, enjoying the feeling before
		her own desires for the young woman finally won out. "Up." She helped Rebecca to
		her feet, keeping her hands around the small waist for balance. The gunslinger turned her
		and pulled her back down, this time so that the smaller woman&#146;s legs were straddling
		her. Josie reached down and grabbed the backs of Rebecca&#146;s thighs, pulling her knees
		up onto the sheepskin covered seat, which in turn, brought the young woman closer until
		the crotch of her underwear was pressed up against the gunslinger's belly. "Much
		better," Josie said as she reached up and finished unbuttoning Rebecca&#146;s dress.
		She then pulled the top of the dress down off Rebecca&#146;s shoulders, baring her
		succulent breasts. The motion also caused the young woman's arms to be pinned by the
		sleeves, a situation that Josie did not want. She loved the feel of those arms around her,
		the fingers clasping and unclasping her hair as she drove Rebecca wild with passion. No,
		this just would not do. She reached back and helped free the young woman's arms, in the
		process claiming a soft breast for her mouth.</p>

		<p>Rebecca cried out and did exactly what Josie wanted, burying her
		hands deep into the raven hair and pressing her body close. The constant jostling of the
		wagon made the familiar flicks of the gunslinger's tongue more pronounced, the sensations
		more intense. Josie kept both of her hands behind Rebecca&#146;s back, supporting her and
		keeping her close as she moved her mouth to give equal attention to the other breast. The
		rocking of the blonde's hips became more pronounced as her need grew. The gunslinger
		smiled and nipped the tender nipple with her lips, groaning herself when she heard
		Rebecca&#146;s moan. Josie reached down and cupped the firm buttocks with her hands,
		squeezing firmly before allowing one hand to reach even further between the young woman's
		legs and press against her swollen sex. Rebecca cried out and pressed hard against the
		strong fingers, cursing the material that stood between her and the fingers she so
		desperately needed to feel.</p>

		<p>"So ready," Josie murmured, pressing harder with her
		hand, the dampness of the cotton foretelling the flood that awaited her. She couldn't wait
		to remove Rebecca&#146;s underwear, the need to please as great as the young woman's need
		to be pleased. The gunslinger released her hold on Rebecca&#146;s breast and used the hand
		on Rebecca&#146;s rear to push the young woman against her, raising her slightly. The
		movement caused a certain amount of slack in the material, just as Josie had hoped for.
		Rebecca&#146;s head was buried in the crook of the gunslinger's neck, a position that the
		young woman quickly took advantage of, suckling and nibbling every piece of skin she could
		reach.</p>

		<p>Josie closed her eyes at the delicious sensation of her love
		devouring her neck. The movements of her fingers between Rebecca&#146;s legs increased in
		pressure and speed in reaction to the young woman's movements against them. "Yes
		sprite," she murmured as a series of small cries escaped her lover's throat in rhythm
		to the firm strokes. The rough feel of her undergarments rubbing back and forth against
		her was enough to start the overheated blonde's body trembling. "Oh Rebecca&#133;so
		nice&#133;so very nice&#133;." She murmured to her beloved as she continued the
		exquisite torture. The soft cries of passion mixed with deep, husky groans from Rebecca
		gave music to the motions of the gunslinger's fingers. Josie's own clit throbbed in rhythm
		to the activities taking place scant inches away. She spread her fingers out and pressed,
		trapping cloth and Rebecca&#146;s most sensitive spot between them. Josie captured the
		little woman's sensitive earlobe in her mouth and began sucking in synch with the
		squeezing together of her fingers.</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;oh Josie &#133;unngh&#133;oh&#133;" Each
		word came out at a slightly higher pitch than the previous one. The gunslinger's arm
		pressed Rebecca hard against her, breasts crushing against each other as she released the
		lobe and placed her lips softly against the blonde's ear. The young woman heard every
		passion filled breath caress her ear, matching the tempo between her legs.</p>

		<p>"Oh sprite, I love you so much," Josie whispered
		softly, her own eyes shut tight as she lost herself to the feelings. "I love doing
		this, you know." The husky voice was having the desired effect on the treasure in her
		arms. Rebecca was doing more gulping than breathing as her thigh muscles clenched hard
		against the gunslinger's hips, unmindful of the gun strapped there. Josie pressed two
		fingers together and placed them squarely over the wet cotton that covered Rebecca&#146;s
		swollen clit and rubbed hard and quick. "Yes sprite&#133;now."</p>

		<p>The soft words spoken into her ear carried her over the edge.
		Rebecca&#146;s fingers clawed helplessly at the gunslinger's shoulders as she cried out,
		her whole body shaking with the force of her orgasm. Josie's hand stilled, enjoying the
		flood of wetness that seeped through the cotton. She shifted the limp woman until she was
		lying across her lap, holding her close. "I love you, Rebecca," she murmured as
		she placed gentle kisses on her lover&#146;s lips. "So beautiful."</p>

		<p>Green eyes opened to slowly focus on deep blue ones so full of
		love for her. Beneath her ear, Rebecca felt the steady thumping of the gunslinger's heart.
		She raised her hand to stroke the bronzed cheek. "I just look at you and I
		melt," she murmured, slowly feeling her energy return along with her passion. She
		slid off Josie's lap, holding on to her arms for support and changed positions, mindful of
		the leather reins lying tucked under the gunslinger's strong leg. Rebecca pressed with her
		knee, forcing Josie's legs apart. She pressed her knee firmly against the older woman's
		sex while pressing her own down against the bounty hunter's strong thigh. Both women
		groaned into each other's mouths at the contact. Rebecca kept her knee still as the
		raven-haired woman adjusted to just the right position. The blonde's hand gently fondled
		Josie's breast through the shirt as they started to rock against each other.</p>

		<p>The road beneath became just a bit rougher at that point, adding
		a few extra jolts to their rocking. The constant pulsing between Josie's legs grew in
		intensity until she finally felt the release she so desperately needed - a small, sweet,
		gentle orgasm to take the edge off, to sate the need momentarily. She let out a long, deep
		groan and held Rebecca close, knowing that the younger woman could feel her sex still
		pulsing through the layers of cloth. Both knew they weren't finished. Within seconds,
		Josie's hands were beginning to wander again and her mouth moved down to capture
		Rebecca&#146;s breast. "Josie &#133;yessss," she hissed, arching her back and
		burying one hand into the raven hair while the other held on to the gunslinger&#146;s
		shoulder for support. She thought she'd go over the edge right then when she felt Josie's
		warm tongue flicking back and forth on the sensitive flesh. The gunslinger reached down
		and tried to separate Rebecca from her clothes while remaining affixed to her breast, and
		growled with frustration when the task proved to be impossible. They separated long enough
		for Rebecca to sit down on the seat next to her and try to remove her boot. Josie's desire
		overrode her patience as she reached down and yanked the boot off easily.
		"Thanks," the smaller woman said, leaning in for a kiss.</p>

		<p>"Mmm, you are most welcome," she replied, deepening the
		kiss as her hand returned to one of its favorite places, namely her lover&#146;s breast.
		She leaned forward, pressing Rebecca back down against the sheepskin. The leather reins
		fell loosely to the ground, causing Flossy to stop, not that either woman noticed, nor did
		they notice when the mare spotted a nearby patch of grass that looked quite tasty and she
		and Phoenix left the trail and began to graze. All the women noticed was the exquisite
		passion and desire that flowed between them. As much as Josie needed to feel the velvet
		liquid of Rebecca, she needed to make love to her breasts and mouth at the same time and
		couldn't pull herself away. Rebecca meanwhile was completely under the gunslinger's spell
		and unable to do anything more than softly moan and gently caress the raven head lying on
		her breast. Neither woman was particularly comfortable, but they were reluctant to move
		and end the moment. Only when Josie's back screamed at her and Rebecca&#146;s leg
		threatened to cramp up did they finally separate. Josie looked at the fabric of
		Rebecca&#146;s dress pooled around her waist with the flowing skirt still covering the
		treasure she longed to possess. Her fingers moved to the belt that held the garment up and
		Rebecca noticed that, quite surprisingly, the normally strong and sure hands were
		trembling as she worked to loosen the buckle.</p>

		<p>Josie knelt down in front of Rebecca, precariously balanced on
		the narrow floorboard. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Josie dimly noted that they were
		no longer moving, but filed it away such as one might the knowledge that apples were on
		sale at the trading post. Slower than she thought possible, her hands drew Rebecca&#146;s
		dress down over her hips, taking the underdrawers with it. Josie swallowed and her eyes
		became hooded as her nostrils filled with the scent of her lover and soft blonde curls
		came into view, glistening with desire. "Oh my little sprite," she murmured,
		bringing her lips in to nuzzle against the soaked hairs. She shoved the underdrawers down
		below Rebecca&#146;s knees and reluctantly pulled her mouth back, but not before snaking
		her tongue out to coat it with the sweetest of honey. Rebecca pulled one foot free of the
		confining underwear and then kicked them off with the other foot.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger stood and quickly dropped her pants and drawers
		down to her ankles, the gunbelt hitting the floorboard with a thud. She twisted and sat
		back down, holding her arms out for her willing lover to join her. Rebecca quickly
		straddled her leg; her soaked thighs rested just above equally wet ones. She put her hands
		on Josie's chest to stop her advances. "Wait," rocking gently against her, the
		blonde unbuttoned the gunslinger's shirt, pushing it aside to reveal the full mounds,
		erect with need. Rebecca spread her knees apart, sliding down to cover Josie's nipple with
		her mouth. Instantly a firm hand grasped the back of her head, keeping her in place.</p>

		<p>"Yes&#133;" Josie hissed, throwing her head back, the
		raven hair falling loosely around her shoulders. Her eyes fluttered shut as Rebecca began
		to nibble and nip in addition to her suckling and licking. She pressed the young woman's
		mouth against her harder, not completely worried if she could breath or not, the need so
		overpowering. "Please&#133;"</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew the meaning behind the timbre of Josie's voice. She
		raked her teeth across the engorged nipple and moved to the other side, the gunslinger's
		hand still firmly planted against the back of her head. Her fingers quickly took up
		residence at the abandoned nipple, pinching and rolling it between them while her lips,
		teeth, and tongue mercilessly attacked the other. Rebecca&#146;s soft moans of delight
		blended with the groans of the gunslinger as they remained lost in time to the rest of the
		world.</p>

		<p>Josie's hands began a lazy descent down Rebecca&#146;s back until
		she couldn't resist the urge any longer. She reached down and slipped her index finger
		between the folds, groaning both at the amount of sweet nectar that awaited her and at the
		increased sucking on her breast, no doubt a direct result of her actions between
		Rebecca&#146;s legs. The gunslinger pulled her closer, causing the young woman to lose her
		hold on the bounty hunter's nipple. She quickly found Josie's mouth an acceptable
		substitute, driving her tongue in just as she felt the firm finger stroke against her
		clit. Rebecca wrapped her arms tightly around the gunslinger's neck and rocked hard
		against her hand. Josie slipped another finger in to join the first in her quest to take
		Rebecca. Once both were soaked to her satisfaction, she pulled them back and slowly
		circled her young love's entrance. "Oh god, please Josie &#133;please," Rebecca
		cried as she tried unsuccessfully to drive herself onto the strong fingers. She growled in
		frustration and dove against the gunslinger's neck, determined to convince her tall lover
		to give her what she needed.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;" Josie said with a moan, leaning her
		head back to allow better access, her fingers lightly brushing against the smaller woman's
		sensitive nub. Without warning, Josie entered her with one long deep stroke. Rebecca cried
		out, slamming her hips down hard, trying to drive the gunslinger in deeper. Josie added a
		third finger, filling her lover while her other hand slid around to the front and joined
		the pleasure. She rubbed and circled Rebecca&#146;s sensitive clit in rhythm to her stokes
		in and out, both of which were picking up speed as the blonde's hips moved faster than
		they would ever have been able to do under any other circumstances. Her groans and cries
		grew louder and she reached for Josie's nipples, wanting her to share in the moment.
		"Yes&#133;yes my sprite&#133;so good&#133;"</p>

		<p>"It's&#133;because&#133;oh&#133;of you&#133;." Both
		women&#146;s voices were strained and panting from exertion.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca&#133;" Josie stopped the movements of her
		hands and waited until the young woman opened her eyes and looked at her.
		"Watch," Josie said softly as she moved her hand from the front of her love to
		reach between her own folds, letting out a deep groan as she touched the long denied
		nerve. She stroked Rebecca firmly, raising her off her lap with each upward stroke. The
		young woman's hands continued to fondle Josie's ample bosom while the gunslinger used her
		hands to pleasure them both. Rebecca looked down and watched as Josie's fingers moved back
		and forth rapidly against her own sex. She looked back up to watch the blue eyes flutter
		shut and the gunslinger's back arch. Josie's hand became a blur against herself as her
		other hand stilled within her lover. She threw her head back and gritted her teeth as she
		felt Rebecca&#146;s warm mouth claim her left breast, her right one being kneaded and
		pinched by knowing fingers. With a howl that barely resembled her lover's name, Josie's
		hips lurched off the seat and her legs slammed shut, trapping her left hand between them.
		Rebecca had the presence of mind to use her hands to grab on to the gunslinger's shoulders
		for balance. The bounty hunter remained motionless for a moment as the shocks pulsed
		through her body. Josie slowly lowered herself back on the damp seat with Rebecca tucked
		against her chest. With infinite slowness, she began to stroke her lover again, long, deep
		strokes that earned the gunslinger a hedonistic groan from the young woman. Within
		seconds, Josie felt the rush of renewed passion flowing from within Rebecca and she picked
		up the pace, bringing her left hand back through the golden curls to stroke the blonde's
		aching bundle of nerves.</p>

		<p>"Josie&#133;oh&#133;yes, please&#133;Josie&#133;"
		Rebecca gave up on rational thought, digging her fingers into the gunslinger's upper arms.
		Her hips rocked back and forth wantonly as she forced her lover's strong fingers into her
		again and again. Her body quivered, then stilled, frozen in ecstasy. Josie expended her
		remaining energy, ignoring the ache in her forearm as she tried to draw out Rebecca&#146;s
		orgasm as long as possible. The gunslinger's name was torn from the young woman's lips as
		she reached the pinnacle of pleasure and collapsed against Josie's chest.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger immediately withdrew her hands, pulling
		Rebecca&#146;s center up to press against her lower belly in an attempt to maintain
		contact with the still quivering area. She wrapped her arms around the healer and murmured
		soft words of endearment to her. "Shh&#133;I've got you. I love you&#133;I'm right
		here, sprite." Josie didn't know if Rebecca heard the words or not but she knew she
		understood the meaning and the tone as she felt the young woman relax against her. She
		felt the strong heartbeat slowing down to a more normal pace as she stroked the blonde
		hair and held her tight until she felt Rebecca try to move.</p>

		<p>"You&#133;" The young woman said, reaching up to stroke
		her finger down the length of the gunslinger's cheek, "&#133;are wonderful."</p>

		<p>"Mmm&#133;" Josie took the wayward finger and kissed it
		before pulling Rebecca closer to her. "So are you, sprite&#133;so are you."</p>

		<p>They sat together like that for several moments until a soft
		nicker from Phoenix reminded them of where they were. Rebecca picked her head up and
		looked around. "Seems like a good place to camp for the night."</p>

		<p>"We still have at least three more hours of traveling to do
		before nightfall," Josie protested half-heartedly. The little woman looked at her
		thoughtfully for a moment before pulling herself up to whisper into the gunslinger's ear.</p>

		<p>"Well&#133;if we make camp now&#133;" She flicked out
		her tongue to lightly touch Josie's ear, "Perhaps I can arrange for a little
		something for both of us to eat, hmm?" Her husky voiced whisper left little doubt as
		to what she had in mind for them to consume.</p>

		<p>"An early camp, sure. What&#146;s a few hours one way or the
		other?" The gunslinger quickly agreed, pulling her lover in for a passionate kiss
		guaranteed to leave them both breathless.</p>

	<chapter title="41: Betrayal">
		<p>Rebecca&#146;s father sat at a table in the saloon by a window
		that commanded a view of the Mercantile that also served as the post office for Tahlequah,
		Oklahoma. One hand tightly grasped the bottle of bourbon that had been his constant
		companion since his arrival in town three days ago, and the other methodically creased a
		piece of paper until it threatened to fall apart. It didn&#146;t matter; he knew every
		word on that paper by heart. It was a letter that read:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:2cm">Dear Katie</p>

		<p style="margin-left:2cm">I wanted to write and let you know that I am well. I am traveling
		with Josie Hunter &#150; yes, the outlaw we used to read books about. But believe me, she
		is nothing like those books make her out to be. She can be very kind and caring, and I
		have seen her risk her life many times to help others, including me. I can&#146;t tell you
		how many times she has saved my life, and I refuse to believe that such a person is guilty
		of all the crimes she has been accused of. One day I hope to help her clear her name; it
		is the least I can do for all she has done for me.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2cm">She is taking me to Tahlequah Oklahoma to meet a real Medicine
		elder. I want to learn the healing arts, and the Cherokee&#146;s, who are her
		father&#146;s people, are very skilled in that area. We hope to be there in another two
		weeks or so, and I would love it if you would write to let me know how you are doing - you
		know what I mean. I will check the general delivery when we arrive in town, and as often
		as possible after that until I hear from you. Please don&#146;t mention this letter to Ma,
		as I am afraid she will say something to Pa, and I don&#146;t want him to know I am with
		Josie. He would not understand, and I am afraid he might try to do something to get me
		back. And much as I love you and Ma, Katie, I can never live under a roof with him again.
		I just pray that he does not hurt you like he hurt me, and hope you find yourself a nice
		fellow that will treat you with the kindness and gentleness you deserve; like Josie treats
		me, even though she is a woman.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2cm">I love you, little sis. Be well</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2cm">Rebecca</p>

		<p>Caleb gritted his teeth and poured another slug of whiskey into
		his glass. He could just picture how that bitch was treating Rebecca with "kindness
		and gentleness", and the image made his blood boil. He had heard about women who kept
		after other women, and they were an abomination in the eyes of the lord. He planned to
		drag Rebecca back to Chancetown &#150; bound and gagged, if need be, but not before he
		collected the reward on the head of Josie Hunter. He smiled at the good fortune that
		caused him to go into town to collect the letter that was intended for his daughter.
		Normally the girl would run errands in town while he sat in the bar drinking up what
		little profits he was able to eke out of running the farm. But both Katie and Sarah were
		down with the flu when Caleb ran out of liquor, which was about the only thing he went to
		town for these days. At Sarah&#146;s request he stopped in the mercantile to pick up a few
		items, and the proprietor had handed him the letter for Katie, knowing he was her father.
		From the moment he read it, he knew what he had to do. Within a couple of days he was on
		his way to Oklahoma, already planning how he would spend the thousand-dollar reward.</p>

		<p>"Wait, wait, stop!" Rebecca called as their wagon
		rumbled almost past the mercantile. Josie reined in the horse thinking that Rebecca had
		seen something in the road that she was about to run over.</p>

		<p>"What is it?" She asked, her eyes scouring the area in
		front of the wagon for the source of Rebecca&#146;s excitement.</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry&#133;I didn&#146;t mean to make you think
		something was wrong. I just need to stop into the mercantile for something. Can you wait a
		minute?"</p>

		<p>"Actually I need to pick up some grain at the feed store.
		You go ahead and shop and I&#146;ll come back for you in a little while."</p>

		<p>"Okay," Rebecca said brightly, jumping down from the
		wagon and hurrying into the store. Josie gave the reins a jingle and Flossy trudged down
		the road.</p>

		<p>Caleb almost didn&#146;t recognize Rebecca; she seemed taller,
		healthier, and more robust than the girl he remembered. Living on the road seemed to suit
		her; or perhaps it was the attentions of the outlaw that caused her to look so content.
		His nostrils flared as he visualized the two women together, and in spite of his firm
		belief that what they were doing was a mortal sin, he could feel himself growing aroused
		at the mental image. He got unsteadily to his feet; he had been drinking almost steadily
		for several days, and even he had a limit. Holding his hat in front of the erection he
		could not quite will away, he lurched out the door and across the street, praying that the
		outlaw would not show up too soon and spoil his plans.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m looking for a letter addressed to Rebecca Cameron
		care of general delivery," she was saying to the gray-headed woman behind the
		counter. The woman smiled and turned toward a stack of mail behind her in a wooden box.</p>

		<p>"I sure don&#146;t recall anything with that name on
		it," the woman said over her shoulder, "and I usually remember when I get
		something for a name that&#146;s not familiar."</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t waste your time," Caleb growled from behind
		Rebecca, causing the young woman to jump and turn toward him. Involuntarily she brought
		her hands up to shield her face before she realized he was not going to strike her. Not at
		that moment, anyway. "There ain&#146;t gonna be no mail there for little Rebecca,
		&#145;cause little Katie never got her letter." He wagged the grimy creased paper in
		front of Rebecca&#146;s face.</p>

		<p>"P-Pa," she stammered, "What are you
		doing&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Never mind," he said, cutting her off in mid sentence.
		He grasped her arm with a grip like a steel band, and began to propel her across the floor
		toward the door. The hapless clerk behind the counter looked on, uncertain what to do.
		Clearly this was a domestic quarrel of some kind and she would do well to keep her nose
		out of it, her husband would say. "There&#146;s gonna be a tall half-breed iron
		totin&#146; woman coming in here looking for this little gal. When she does, tell her that
		Rebecca will meet her down to the sheriff&#146;s office. And don&#146;t mention that you
		seen anyone with her, or I&#146;ll make you right sorry you did."</p>

		<p>"I&#133;I&#133;" The woman began, but before she could
		form a sentence, the pair were out the door.</p>

		<p>Josie could not imagine what possible errand had taken Rebecca to
		the sheriff&#146;s office. The woman in the mercantile said only that she was to meet her
		there. She opened the door to the office and spotted Rebecca sitting in a chair with an
		older man beside her. His hands were placed possessively on Rebecca&#146;s shoulders, and
		Josie instinctively began to grab for her gun. At that same moment, Rebecca called out
		"Josie, don&#146;t&#133;" And a gun butt caught her at the base of her skull,
		causing her to sink lifelessly to the floor.</p>

		<p>When she regained consciousness she was lying in a cell on a cot
		that reeked of urine and god knew what else. Her head pounded, and her exploring fingers
		found a substantial goose egg on her head. The fingers came away sticky with blood, but at
		least the bleeding had stopped. Gingerly she sat up and tried to focus on what was going
		on in the outer office. She could not see anyone, but she could hear voices, one of them
		Rebecca&#146;s.</p>

		<p>"&#133;go of me! If you&#146;ve hurt her, I
		swear&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Simmer down," said a male voice with a youthful tone
		to it, probably belonging to the sheriff. "I just knocked her out to keep her from
		killing your father. She&#146;ll be all right." Definitely the sheriff then; the man
		standing with Rebecca had not been wearing a star&#133; Suddenly it registered on Josie
		that the sheriff had said the older man was Rebecca&#146;s father. The man who had beaten
		his daughter so bad she felt running away with a known outlaw was preferable to staying in
		his home. The man she had once vowed to kill if she ever found herself in the same place
		as him. Her face flushed with anger as she listened to the words that spewed forth from
		the abusive drunk.</p>

		<p>"Shoulda killed her, sheriff. Reward&#146;s good dead or
		alive, and dead is a lot safer with that one. Mean as a snake, she is. And corrupted my
		daughter to boot. She ain&#146;t hardly fitten for marriage no more. I&#146;ll end up
		havin&#146; to support the lazy&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Take your hands off me!" Rebecca&#146;s voice broke
		into her father&#146;s venomous diatribe. Josie&#146;s frustration at not being able to
		see what was taking place in the office and intervene doubled with each moment. She paced
		in her tiny cell, her eyes searching for a chink in the stone so she could dig her way
		out, or a loose bar that she could pry free and use to&#133;what, she thought bitterly.
		Bludgeon that snake to death? Not likely he would get within arms reach of her, and
		certainly the sheriff would do more than hit her on the head if she did what she truly
		wanted to do. Killing for the sake of killing was not her way. She had killed countless
		men, but only those who would have killed her if she had not. Or those who threatened to
		do harm to someone she cared about. She knew she could kill Rebecca&#146;s father in a
		heartbeat and feel no remorse whatsoever. She was surprised to feel tears running down her
		face, tears that sprung from her fear of what would become of the woman she loved when
		they hung her. And she had no doubt at all that they would hang her, and this time there
		would be no bumbling lynch mob walking away without first making sure she was dead. Her
		thoughts were interrupted once again by the voices outside her range of vision.</p>

		<p>"Mr. Cameron, I&#146;ve got another empty cell right next to
		Josie I can put you in if you don&#146;t leave this young woman alone."</p>

		<p>"She&#146;s my daughter. I have the right&#133;"</p>

		<p>"You have no rights!" Rebecca&#146;s voice rose in
		anger. "Whatever rights you had you gave away when you beat me. A father should never
		hurt his children. A father&#133;" Her voice trailed off, and Josie&#146;s heart
		broke as she heard Rebecca begin to sob. &#145;Oh, sprite, don&#146;t let him hurt you
		anymore,&#146; she prayed.</p>

		<p>"All right, that&#146;s it Mr. Cameron. You take yourself on
		out of here and sober up. If I catch you bothering your daughter again I promise I will
		lock you up. Those cells are pretty small and close together and I can&#146;t be watching
		Josie every minute, if you get my meaning." Josie found herself admiring this man who
		had clubbed her on the head. In other circumstances she was sure they could have been
		friends. But at least she did not need to worry quite so much about Rebecca while she was
		in Tahlequah, as the sheriff would protect her.</p>

		<p>"But my reward," Caleb whined, but the sheriff cut him
		off.</p>

		<p>"You&#146;ll get your reward when they ship her back to the
		states," the sheriff replied. "I looked into it when you told me a few days ago
		she was coming to town, and Miss Hunter is not wanted for any crimes in Oklahoma
		Territory. Circuit judge will be here next week and will decide whether to send her back
		to the states or not, and you can whine at him about your reward. I&#146;m sick of
		listening to you. Now move on." Josie could hear some mumbling which she assumed was
		Rebecca&#146;s father protesting, but a moment later she heard the door slam and it was
		quiet in the office. Josie heaved a sigh and sat back down on the sagging bunk.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, sheriff. I&#146;m grateful for your help,"
		Rebecca said sincerely. "Can I see Josie now?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, Miss Cameron. Follow me." A few moments later
		the sheriff rounded the corner leading into the area where the cells were located with
		Rebecca a few paces behind him. Josie stood and walked to the front of the cell and
		extended her hands through the bars. Rebecca elbowed past the sheriff and ran to the cell,
		grasping both of Josie&#146;s hands and kissing her quickly on the cheek.</p>

		<p>The sheriff turned to walk out of the room. "Sheriff,
		wait," Josie called to him and he turned around. "Thanks. For taking care of
		Rebecca." Now that she could see him, she understood why she had felt an affinity for
		the man. He had the look of a Cherokee. Unless she missed her guess he was a half-breed
		like herself. And the Cherokee&#146;s took care of their own.</p>

		<p>"No problem," he said with a grin. "I&#146;m just
		sorry I had to club you on the head when I did, but I was afraid you were going to shoot
		him. The man&#146;s an ass, but I couldn&#146;t let that happen. And you can believe that
		no harm will come to Miss Cameron while she&#146;s in my town."</p>

		<p>"I believe you. And I&#146;m sorry you had to club me, too.
		My head hurts like hell." He shrugged as if to say, "what could I do?", and
		she couldn&#146;t help but smile at him. "Do you suppose we could have some privacy
		here?" She asked, and he nodded.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll be in the office if you need anything," he
		said, then he turned and left the room.</p>

		<p>Both women stood there for several moments after he left, not
		speaking, their fingers twined together through the bars. Then both of them began to speak
		at the same instant.</p>

		<p>"Let me see&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, how&#133;"</p>

		<p>"&#133;your head. Turn around and let me see." Josie
		did as she asked, and Rebecca gasped at the size of the bump on her head.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll be all right," Josie said turning back
		around to see the look of horror on Rebecca&#146;s face. "It&#146;s stopped bleeding
		already. Don&#146;t worry. Rebecca, how did he find us?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca&#146;s lip trembled and she looked as if she might burst
		into tears. Josie reached out through the bars and caressed her cheek, crooning softly as
		she did. "Shhh, baby, it&#146;s all right. Don&#146;t cry." Rather than
		comforting her, Josie&#146;s words seemed to push Rebecca over the edge. Tears began to
		course down her face, and when she tried to speak her voice came out in ragged gasps.</p>

		<p>"I-I&#133;wrote&#133;to my s-sister," she sobbed.
		"I told her where we were g-going. I just wanted to know&#133;she was all right, and
		to let her know I was happy. Oh, Josie, I never thought he would pick up the mail. He
		never does. I&#146;m so sorry, Josie&#133;"</p>

		<p>It had never occurred to Josie that Rebecca had betrayed her,
		however innocent her motives had been, and for a moment she was shocked into silence. The
		look of agony on Rebecca&#146;s face pierced straight into the outlaw&#146;s heart and
		pulled her from her silent contemplation. Once again she reached out to comfort the woman
		she loved, and Rebecca seized her hand. Josie smiled and kissed the back of Rebecca&#146;s
		hand.</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t blame yourself," Josie said softly.
		"You meant no harm."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie, what are we going to do? If they send you back
		to the states, they&#146;ll hang you. I couldn&#146;t live with myself if that happened. I
		don&#146;t want to live without you&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t talk like that," Josie said more harshly
		than she had intended, and Rebecca fell silent and simply stared at her. "If
		something&#133;if they do send me back, I want you to promise you&#146;ll go to
		Charles&#146; place. You&#146;ll be safe there, and he and Horace love you."</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m not leaving you," Rebecca said firmly.
		"If they send you back, I&#146;m going to be right beside you. You can&#146;t bully
		me, Josie Hunter. I&#146;m in this till the end."</p>

		<p>Josie could tell from the set of her jaw that there would be no
		arguing with the younger woman. Her one hope for getting out of this mess without a pine
		box for a bed would be if they could convince the judge not to extradite her. And
		Rebecca&#146;s gift with words might just be the thing that would do the trick.
		"You&#146;re a stubborn woman, Rebecca Cameron. And by God, that might be just what
		we need." She reached through the bars and put her hand behind Rebecca&#146;s head,
		pulling her in for a kiss.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>It was several hours later when Rebecca emerged from the
		cellblock. Josie&#146;s headache had worsened while they were talking and she thought if
		she could get some sleep it might help. Almost as soon as she laid her head down she was
		asleep. Rebecca watched her sleep for several minutes before she tore herself away,
		knowing that there were many things to do before the judge arrived and nobody to do it but
		herself.</p>

		<p>The sheriff was not in the office when she came out and instead a
		deputy sat behind the desk. He barely glanced at her as he was busy cleaning guns. It
		reminded her of the evenings she and Josie spent while the outlaw did that same thing, and
		she felt a gripping in her chest like a vice around her heart.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me," she said to the deputy, who finally looked
		up from his labors and blinked a couple of times to find a beautiful young woman standing
		before him. "I wonder if you can tell me where the sheriff has gone?"</p>

		<p>"Uh, yes ma&#146;am," he said, tipping his hat in
		respect. "He&#146;s gone off to get himself a bite to eat. Should be back directly,
		or you can find him over to Miss Lucy&#146;s diner. He&#146;ll be bringing something back
		for your&#133;for the prisoner to eat."</p>

		<p>"Thanks," she said with a smile. "I better go help
		him with his food choices for Josie. She&#146;s&#133;particular."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma&#146;am," he said with a nod, and resumed
		cleaning the weapons.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The sheriff saw her walk through the door, and from the way her
		eyes were searching the crowd, he figured she was looking for him. He stood up and waved
		to catch her eye, and she smiled and walked toward him. He remained standing as she
		approached, pulling out the chair opposite his. "I&#146;d be honored if you would
		join me," he said sincerely. Rebecca had been so concerned over Josie that she had
		not even realized how long it had been since she had eaten. She was indeed quite hungry,
		and her stomach growled loudly as he finished speaking.</p>

		<p>"I&#133;thank you again, sheriff. You are very kind. I
		believe I will." She allowed him to scoot her chair under the table and then he went
		to fetch the waitress before resuming his seat.</p>

		<p>"She&#146;ll be right here, Miss Cameron."</p>

		<p>"Call me Rebecca, please. Just now I&#146;m not so crazy
		about the name Cameron."</p>

		<p>"All right, Miss&#133;Rebecca," he said catching
		himself and smiling sheepishly. "I&#146;m John Kenwood. I&#146;d be pleased if
		you&#146;d call me John." The waitress appeared by Rebecca&#146;s side and ran down
		the list of specials available, adding that the roast beef was some of the best in the
		entire territory.</p>

		<p>"That sounds good," Rebecca said with enthusiasm.</p>

		<p>"And put together a plate of that for us to take with
		us," John added, then quickly turned to Rebecca and asked, "That is if you think
		that will meet with Josie&#146;s approval."</p>

		<p>"Oh it&#146;ll meet with her approval all right. We&#146;re
		used to eating what we can catch on the road, and beef is a rare treat." The waitress
		withdrew to give the orders to the cook, and for the first time Rebecca noticed that
		John&#146;s own plate of food was sitting, cooling, on the table in front of him.
		"Please, John, eat your food while it&#146;s still hot."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I don&#146;t mind eating my food cold. Tell you the
		truth, I probably prefer it. I&#146;ll just wait until she brings your food. Maybe you can
		tell me a bit about how you came to be traveling with the notorious outlaw Josie Hunter
		while we wait."</p>

		<p>Rebecca had sensed from her first meeting with the gentle sheriff
		that he was a man she could trust. She folded her hands on the table in front of her and
		began her story. "It all started when I was grabbed by three thugs intent on raping
		me. But they didn&#146;t reckon on Josie Hunter being within hearing range of my
		screams&#133;"</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca pushed her plate away and politely declined the
		waitress&#146; offer of another cup of coffee. She felt as if she would burst if she took
		in another morsel. While they ate, she had summed up the high points of her life with
		Josie, highlighting the number of times the outlaw had saved her life. The only detail she
		left out was the fact that she and Josie had become lovers. She did not think that such a
		personal detail had any bearing on their current problem, which was how to avoid letting
		Josie be extradited for trial in the states.</p>

		<p>When Rebecca was through with her story, John sat there for a few
		moments deep in thought. Taking a deep breath, he said, "I sure wish it was up to me
		whether Josie were to stand trial or not. She&#146;d be sitting here with us right now,
		laughing and drinking coffee." Rebecca glanced toward the empty chair on her right,
		and felt a stab of pain that what the sheriff had just described was not the reality of
		the moment. "Josie is something of a&#133;local legend, you might say," John
		continued. "The Cherokee will tell you that she is responsible for saving more lives
		than any other person they can name. The money she stole from the railroads she used to
		buy food and supplies for the Cherokee. According to legend, she never kept any of it for
		herself. She also helped the Chinamen and coloreds the railroads worked half to death for
		slave wages. To the white man she&#146;s a murdering thief, but to anyone with skin other
		than white she is something of a hero. To tell the truth, I was surprised to see her
		traveling with a white woman."</p>

		<p>"I think you should wire the sheriff in Mason&#146;s Gulch
		and see if you can get him to send you a statement about how Josie saved that town from
		being sacked. That was an entire town full of white people Josie saved, and all she asked
		for in return was food for her horse and some salt pork."</p>

		<p>"Hm. Good idea. We&#146;re going to need all the help we can
		get with the judge that&#146;s coming through next week. His family was killed during an
		Indian raid, and he doesn&#146;t look too kindly on anyone with red skin, or even half red
		skin like Josie&#146;s."</p>

		<p>"Can&#146;t we request another judge?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head and said, "I&#146;m afraid not. We only
		have two judges in the area, and the other one is laid up with a broken leg."</p>

		<p>Rebecca lowered her voice and looked intently into the
		sheriff&#146;s face. "I don&#146;t suppose you might&#133;accidentally leave her cell
		unlocked one night."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Miss Rebecca, I&#146;d like nothing more than to see
		her free. But I&#146;m sworn to uphold the law, and that means we have to find a way to
		get her out of there legally." He fell silent when the waitress materialized with a
		basket containing the food for Josie. Handing her several coins, he rose from his chair
		and picked up the basket.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m sorry, John. Please forget I asked that. I&#146;m
		just&#133;desperate to get her out of there. But we&#146;ll do it your way&#133;according
		to the law. Maybe we can go over the judge&#146;s head and find someone a little more
		sympathetic. Or at least willing to listen to reason."</p>

		<p>The sheriff&#146;s face brightened, and he nodded vigorously.
		"You&#146;re right. That&#146;s exactly what we need to do, and I think I know just
		the man." Holding out his hand to assist Rebecca from her chair, he propelled her
		toward the door, all the while laying out his idea for the next steps to take.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Josie." Rebecca&#146;s soft voice reached into the
		darkness that had enveloped the gunslinger and was pulling her toward the light. The pain
		in her head had lessened, but she still squinted her eyes against the glare of the lantern
		outside the cell. "We brought you some food. And we have a plan." The enthusiasm
		in her voice made Josie open her eyes wider, and she was surprised to see that Rebecca was
		in the cell with her, kneeling on the floor by the cot. The sheriff was nowhere in
		evidence, but she noticed that the cell door was shut behind Rebecca, and presumably
		locked. Her plan probably did not include making a break for it.</p>

		<p>Josie sat up on the edge of the cot and peeked into the basket on
		the floor from which the enticing aroma emanated. "Ah, I see. We&#146;re going to
		blast our way out with&#133;roast beef? Smells heavenly."</p>

		<p>"We are not going to blast our way out. We are going to talk
		our way out, just as you suggested. At least that&#146;s what I am going to try to do. And
		if that fails, we&#146;re going to blast our way out."</p>

		<p>"With roast beef," Josie finished for her. The
		light-hearted tone in Rebecca&#146;s voice was contagious, and Josie found herself
		thinking that perhaps the determined little woman could actually pull it off, whatever her
		clever plan was. "Who is it you&#146;re planning on charming on my behalf?"
		Josie removed the plate from the basket and began to eat as Rebecca told her about the
		judge and his hatred of Indians. As she listened, Josie&#146;s spirits dropped along with
		her appetite, and she set her food aside. "Doesn&#146;t sound like even you could
		charm a man with that much hatred in his heart," Josie said with a hint of bitterness
		in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Oh, but it&#146;s not him I&#146;m going after. John says
		the governor is very sympathetic to the cause of the Indians, and he can override anything
		the judge says as long as we can get him here before you&#146;re sent away. He&#146;s
		supposed to be a fair and honest man, and John thinks that if we tell him how you gave the
		money you stole to the people who should have had it in the first place that&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Wait, wait," she interrupted the little blonde,
		placing her hand on her lips to still her. "What&#146;s this I&#146;m supposed to
		have done with the money, and who is this John who claims to know?"</p>

		<p>"The sheriff&#146;s name is John. Didn&#146;t I tell you
		that? And he said it&#146;s common knowledge that you gave your cut of the robberies to
		the Indians. Why didn&#146;t you tell me? I always kind of wondered why you never seemed
		to have any money since you had stolen so much, but I never would have dreamed
		you&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Common knowledge, is it," Josie said with a wry smile.
		"And I took great pains to try to make sure it was kept secret."</p>

		<p>"Why? Why would you want to hide such a kind and generous
		act?"</p>

		<p>"Think about it. Would you accept a gift from someone
		knowing that what they were giving you was bought with stolen money? Not to mention that
		the more people who knew, the more likely it was the railroads would find out what had
		become of their money. At the very least they would take it back, and possibly even come
		in with guns blazing. I wouldn&#146;t want to be responsible for the death of any of my
		father&#146;s people. Besides, it suited me to have people think that I was no more than a
		ruthless outlaw. Most people pretty much leave me alone when they find out who I am, and
		all evidence to the contrary, I really don&#146;t enjoy being called out and having to
		kill people." She smiled a little sadly and shook her head before continuing,
		"It&#146;s almost funny. I&#146;ve been given credit for so many robberies over the
		years that I would have to have been ten people to do them all. Some of them were in
		places I have never been. I never tried very hard to convince anyone that it wasn&#146;t
		me because it served my purposes. Now they&#146;ll use those crimes against me as well.
		Rebecca, even if you can get to the governor, there is nothing you will be able to tell
		him that will make a difference with that much evidence stacked up against me."</p>

		<p>"I refuse to believe that," Rebecca said stubbornly.
		"I&#146;ll tell him about Mason&#146;s Gulch and Deadwood and all the people you
		saved there."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, a blind person could see that you love me. How
		much weight do you think your testimony is going to carry? They would figure you&#146;d
		lie through your teeth to save me."</p>

		<p>"Yes, I&#146;d lie," Rebecca said through tight lips.
		"I&#146;d do anything I had to if it meant you would go free. But Josie, it&#146;s
		the truth I&#146;ll be telling, and there are plenty of other people who know it too. We
		just have to get hold of them. Tomorrow we&#146;re sending out telegrams to everyone
		you&#146;ve helped and asking them to send in a testimonial for you if they can&#146;t
		come here themselves by next week. Then I&#146;m going to New Hope where the governor will
		be dedicating the new City Hall on Thursday, and I&#146;m going to talk to him. And if I
		can&#146;t convince him, I&#146;ll go higher. As high as I have to. Josie, I won&#146;t
		let them take you&#133;I can&#146;t."</p>

		<p>"The governor is as high as you can get out here in the
		Territories. And I know you will do as much as it&#146;s humanly possible to do. But
		please," she grasped Rebecca&#146;s hand and pulled her into an embrace,
		"don&#146;t get your hopes up too high. And promise me you&#146;ll do what I
		said&#133;about going back to Charles&#146; farm." Rebecca opened her mouth to say
		something but her reply was cut off by the sound of approaching footsteps. By the time
		John appeared in front of the cell they were sitting on opposite ends of the cot, both
		women looking grim but determined.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m sorry, Miss Rebecca, but I need to lock down the
		prisoner for the night. I&#146;ll have to ask you to leave now." Faced with the
		prospect of separating from Josie, Rebecca&#146;s face looked stricken. Her feet seemed
		weighted down with lead as she rose and crossed the tiny cell.</p>

		<p>Suddenly her eyes lit on the empty cell next to the one Josie
		occupied, and she said to the sheriff, "John, can I stay in the cell next to hers? I
		promise I won&#146;t be a bother."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Rebecca, you don&#146;t want to spend the night in a
		cell," Josie protested. "It&#146;s damp and cold and&#133;"</p>

		<p>"If it&#146;s good enough for you, it&#146;s good enough for
		me," Rebecca said defiantly. She turned to the sheriff and added, "Besides, my
		father is still out there, and I&#146;m afraid he might try to hurt me. I&#146;d feel
		safer if I were in here."</p>

		<p>"Miss Rebecca it&#146;s really not&#133;" The
		sheriff&#146;s refusal was dissipated like mist in the wind by the pleading look in the
		young woman&#146;s face. "All right," he said grudgingly, "but if I should
		have to lock somebody up I&#146;d have to ask you to leave."</p>

		<p>"I understand," she said. "Would it be all right
		if I get my things from the wagon? I&#146;ll only be a minute." Josie&#146;s face
		suddenly looked stricken.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I forgot all about the horses! Flossy has been
		standing in harness for hours, and neither of them have had food or water since this
		morning. I expected to be coming right back to the wagon."</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t worry. I&#146;ll see that they&#146;re stabled
		and fed," Rebecca said reassuringly. John unlocked the cell and Rebecca hurried out.
		The sooner she attended to the horses the sooner she could be back with Josie. She turned
		and smiled at Josie before she rounded the corner into the outer office, blew the outlaw a
		quick kiss, and was out of sight. The brave smile Josie had been wearing to try to keep
		Rebecca&#146;s spirits up melted from her face, and she sank down onto the cot. With her
		foot she pushed the plate of barely touched food toward the cell door.</p>

		<p>"Might as well take this away. I don&#146;t seem to have
		much of an appetite." John nodded and opened the door, his hand on his gun in case
		Josie should try something while he picked up the plate. She gave a bitter little laugh.
		"Don&#146;t worry, John. I&#146;m not going to do anything. Just promise me
		you&#146;ll keep that sick bastard who calls himself her father away from her, or
		I&#146;ll get out of here &#150; whatever it takes &#150; and kill him."</p>

	<chapter title="42: New Hope">
		<p>Rebecca stepped down from the stagecoach and groaned as her
		cramped muscles protested the long hours of inactivity that had brought her to New Hope,
		Oklahoma. She had taken a train from Tahlequah to Tulsa where she spent the night in the
		train depot. Early the following morning she caught the stagecoach, which, after a few
		other stops, would have her in New Hope by late that afternoon. At least for the last
		couple of hours she had had the coach to herself and was able to stretch out and take a
		bit of a nap. But even so, her eyes felt gritty and she knew she must look a fright. As
		soon as the driver handed her bag down from the top of the coach she made her way to the
		saloon. A sign in the window boasted rooms to rent, bath included. A bath might make her
		feel human again. The dedication of the new city hall, whose clock tower was visible from
		where she stood, was to take place the following day. She didn&#146;t know if the governor
		was in town already and would not be able to recognize him even if he were, so she planned
		to approach him immediately after the dedication. There was nothing for her to do until
		then, so she decided a bath and a good nights sleep would be the best thing in the world
		next to freeing Josie.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>There was a festival attitude in the air the next morning when
		Rebecca made her way toward the new City Hall. Flags and streamers of colorful paper
		garlanded every building on Main Street leading up to the impressive new building. It was
		still several hours until the official dedication, and she decided to stop and get
		something to eat to stop the rumbling in her stomach. The smells from the caf drew her
		across the street a block away from the City Hall. There was not an empty table to be had,
		but as she searched the room she saw a table for two with a lone occupant. It was a
		well-dressed woman perhaps 10 years older than she was, and she was engrossed in reading a
		newspaper. Rebecca wound through the tables until she was standing near the woman&#146;s
		shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me, I wonder if you would mind letting me share your
		table? There doesn&#146;t seem to be another empty seat in the place." The woman
		looked up and smiled, and Rebecca found herself smiling back. The woman&#146;s eyes were
		as green as springtime grass with laugh lines creasing the corners. She had dimples that
		crinkled when she smiled and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks.</p>

		<p>"Please do. My husband has eaten and gone off to get ready
		for the ceremony, and I&#146;d be glad for the company."</p>

		<p>"Thank you," Rebecca said, dropping her bag on the
		floor and sliding it under the table. She held out her hand to shake the other
		woman&#146;s hand as she sat down. "I&#146;m Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Eugenia," the other woman said. She looked around
		until she spotted the waitress, and motioned for her to come over. "Would you clear
		away these plates please and bring a menu for Rebecca. Oh, and a little more coffee for
		me, please."</p>

		<p>"Oh, me too. Coffee. Please." The waitress smiled and
		returned a moment later with a menu, a cup and a pot of coffee. Rebecca wrapped her hands
		around the steaming mug to warm them up and regarded her companion in silence for a
		moment. Something about her struck a familiar chord, yet she was almost certain they had
		never met. "This place is certainly doing a brisk business for this hour of the day.
		Is it always like this?"</p>

		<p>"I wouldn&#146;t know. I&#146;ve never been here before;
		we&#146;re in town for the dedication. Is that what brought you here?" Eugenia poured
		some milk into her coffee and stirred in a spoonful of sugar then sipped the steaming
		brew.</p>

		<p>"No. Well, yes sort of. Actually I came to talk to the
		governor, but since he is here for the dedication I guess you could say that&#146;s why
		I&#146;m here too. I don&#146;t suppose you know what he looks like? I&#146;d like to talk
		to him before the ceremony, if I can."</p>

		<p>Eugenia laughed and the sound reminded Rebecca of the ringing of
		a bright clear bell. "I guess I know what he looks like. He&#146;s my husband."
		Rebecca nearly spilled her coffee as she banged her cup on the table.</p>

		<p>"You&#146;re joking."</p>

		<p>"There have been times when I thought our marriage was a
		joke, but&#133;" Her voice trailed off, and after a moment she smiled again at
		Rebecca and asked, "What business do you have with my husband, if you don&#146;t mind
		my asking?" Rebecca decided to tell the entire story to Eugenia and see if she could
		get her to speak to her husband for her. What incredible luck to find herself with just
		the person she needed to arrange an introduction to the governor!</p>

		<p>"My&#133;" She stopped a second to contemplate how to
		refer to Josie. Friend just didn&#146;t cover it any more. "My partner is in jail.
		She&#146;s supposed to go before the circuit judge next week, and he&#146;s going to
		decide whether to send her back to the states to stand trial for train robbery, among
		other things. But she didn&#146;t do all those crimes, and she never killed anybody that
		didn&#146;t need killing. And she gave the money back to the Cherokee&#146;s,
		and&#133;" Eugenia&#146;s face drained of color and her eyes widened as she listened
		to the young woman plead for her partner. The moment she heard the word
		"Cherokee&#146;s" the face across from her at the table faded away, and she was
		back in a barn beside her best friend as bullets flew through the air around them.</p>

		<p>"Eugenia, are you all right?" Rebecca&#146;s voice
		pierced through her trance and brought her back to the moment. The young woman was holding
		her hand and lightly rubbing her wrist. "You looked like you might faint there for a
		moment."</p>

		<p>"No, I&#146;m all right. Rebecca, your&#133;partner,
		what&#146;s her name?"</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunter." Eugenia leaned back in her chair and
		closed her eyes. She gasped in a few shallow breaths and then expelled them before she
		opened her eyes to once again regard her young companion.</p>

		<p>"You know her." It wasn&#146;t a question. Eugenia
		nodded.</p>

		<p>Josie had never mentioned a Eugenia from her past, but then she
		was pretty closed mouthed about the life she led before they met. Suddenly she knew what
		was familiar about this woman &#150; Josie had described her so perfectly. She was the one
		with the dancing green eyes and the infectious smile that had captured the heart of a
		teen-aged Josie. Even as the thought was forming in Rebecca&#146;s head she realized the
		impossibility of it, but the words tumbled out of her mouth. "You&#146;re
		Genie," she said simply.</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>She stared at Genie, her thoughts miles ahead of her ability to
		put words together rationally. Finally she managed to stammer, "But how&#133;they
		told her you were dead."</p>

		<p>A small sob escaped from Genie&#146;s mouth before she could stop
		herself, and a tear coursed down her cheek. "They told me she was dead, too, but not
		until months after I had recovered from the gun shot wound. So that&#146;s why she&#133;I
		never understood why she didn&#146;t make an effort to contact me." She scrubbed the
		tear off her face with the napkin she was holding and her fingers continued to twist the
		fabric until it was in a tight knot in her hand. She seemed not to notice even as her
		hands turned white from the effort, and it was not until Rebecca reached across and
		lightly touched her hand that she realized what she was doing. She smiled at Rebecca and
		continued. "I told my father what had really happened that night, and he told me she
		had run away. I think he was afraid I would have a relapse if he told me the truth then,
		and later&#133;well later he just didn&#146;t want me to know what a coward he was, I
		think. Anyway, I made sure her name was cleared, and they arrested the men who were
		actually responsible for the thefts. I was sure she would read about it in the papers and
		come back. One of the ranch hands finally told me that they - my father &#150; had hung
		Josie."</p>

		<p>Tears ran down her face again as she relieved the horror of the
		night she learned the truth. She had been so blinded by anger that she had taken a gun
		from her fathers collection, stormed into the barn where he was working, pointed it at his
		head and pulled the trigger. There was a hollow click as the hammer fell on an empty
		chamber. Before she could try to fire again the gun was wrenched from her hand by one of
		the men working with her father. Without a word of explanation she had turned and run from
		the barn, going straight to her room to pack up her clothes. She refused to speak to her
		father when he pounded on her door. He pled with her to tell him what was wrong, but she
		said nothing until she had her suitcases in hand and was ready to leave. She opened the
		door to see his shocked face as his eyes took in her obvious preparation for leaving.</p>

		<p>"I know what you did," she hissed through clenched
		teeth.</p>

		<p>"Genie, I&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t bother to try to deny it! You had to know she
		was trying to help me catch the rustlers. She was my best friend in the world&#133;she
		would never have done anything to hurt me. And she was not a thief! You killed her because
		she was an Indian. She was the most decent person I ever knew. I have half a mind to tell
		the sheriff&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Now don&#146;t be hasty, honey, let me ex&#133;" She
		cut him off and shouldered past him.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m leaving. I&#146;m going to stay with Aunt Stell
		until fall and then you are going to pay for me to go to school back east. And if I never
		see you again that&#146;ll be far too soon for me."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Genie took another sip of her now cold coffee. She pushed the cup
		aside and took a deep breath and continued. "I met William while I was at Vassar. He
		was a bright young man with a lot of ambition and I knew he was going to be a success.
		There was never any&#133;great romance between us but he loved me and was at least willing
		to marry me without a dowry, which I refused to ask my father for. It was after we married
		that I read about Josie being arrested for robbing a train. I told William I was going to
		visit a sick cousin in Pennsylvania but I actually went to try to see Josie in jail. By
		the time I got there she had escaped, and I was never able to track her down. I always
		thought&#133;if I could find her and tell her she wasn&#146;t wanted for the rustling at
		my father&#146;s ranch that I might be able to turn her away from the path she had chosen.
		I blamed myself for her turning to a life of crime. If I hadn&#146;t talked her into
		trying to fight a bunch of murdering outlaws&#133;"</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t blame yourself, Genie. She went after the
		railroads because of what they did to her father and her father&#146;s people, not because
		of what happened to you. There would have been nothing you could do about it."</p>

		<p>"I could have talked her out of it. She listened to me; she
		believed in me."</p>

		<p>"She loved you." Rebecca&#146;s heart lurched in her
		chest as she spoke those words. For the first time it truly sunk in that the woman across
		from her was Josie&#146;s first true love. The jealousy she had successfully conquered
		when she believed Genie to be dead reappeared and caught her off guard. She had to force
		herself not to bite off her next words. "She never stopped loving you."</p>

		<p>Genie&#146;s expression changed from one of sorrow for the past
		she could no longer effect to determination for the future, which she could. She
		didn&#146;t notice the bitterness in Rebecca&#146;s voice, or if she did she gave no sign
		of it. "She&#146;s still the best friend I&#146;ve ever had," Genie said
		sincerely, "and I promise I will help you convince my husband not to let them send
		her back to the states." The clock in the new City Hall pealed the hour of eleven
		o&#146;clock. The ceremony was due to start at noon exactly. "We have an hour for you
		to fill me in on the current situation, and as soon as William is finished with his speech
		I&#146;ll introduce you to him." She reached over and patted Rebecca on the hand and
		smiled. "Don&#146;t worry, Rebecca. I won&#146;t let her down this time."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca and Genie separated a half-hour later so that Genie could
		freshen up before taking her seat on the platform with her husband. Rebecca went to the
		telegraph office to send a wire to John and let him know she had succeeded in her mission.
		The fact that she had not yet spoken to the governor himself did not worry her. She had no
		doubt that Genie could talk him into pardoning Josie if she had him wrapped half as
		tightly around her finger as she once had Josie.</p>

		<p>She waited in the telegraph office for a reply to her telegram,
		which read:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <blockquote>
			<p>JOHN: FOUND THE GOVERNOR STOP TELL JOSIE NOT TO WORRY STOP BACK
			IN THREE DAYS STOP ANY PROBLEMS? STOP WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY STOP SIGNED: REBECCA CAMERON</p>
		  </blockquote>
		</blockquote>

		<p>The clock had struck twelve and Rebecca was about to walk out the
		door when the machine began to clatter and the clerk called out to her to stop. Excited,
		she rushed back to the desk while the rest of the message was received, and the clerk
		handed her a piece of paper.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <blockquote>
			<p>REBECCA: JUDGE IS EARLY STOP THREE DAYS MAY BE TOO LATE STOP HAVE
			GOVERNOR SEND WIRE TO JUDGE STOP URGENT STOP SIGNED: JOHN KENWOOD</p>
		  </blockquote>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Rebecca had to read the message twice before the meaning truly
		sunk in. The paper fluttered from her fingers as she raced out the door and toward her now
		more important than ever meeting with the governor.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The morning sun streaming through the bars of her cell wakened
		Josie. As she swung her legs over the edge of the bed her eyes lit on the scraps of paper
		she had thrown on the floor the night before. One was a wire addressed to the Sheriff from
		Judge Fellowes saying that his schedule had changed and that he would be stopping in
		Tahlequah possibly as early as the next day. The other was from Rebecca saying that she
		had found the governor and Josie was not to worry. John had promised he would do what he
		could to delay the proceedings long enough for Rebecca to return with something written in
		the governor&#146;s own hand saying that Josie was not to be extradited. Or even better,
		if the governor himself would come. She paused in her ruminations and chided herself.
		According to John, Judge Fellowes was known to be one of the most mule-headed men he knew,
		and it was not likely he would accept anything less than the governor face to face before
		he would admit that his authority could be over-ridden. And that he would swiftly decide
		in favor of her return to the states and make arrangements for her transportation was a
		foregone conclusion in John&#146;s opinion.</p>

		<p>The sound of the door leading to the cells opening and slamming
		shut resounded through the small area in which she was confined, and was followed by
		footsteps coming down the hall. She had to smile; the Sheriff invariably made a good deal
		of noise before entering the room to allow his prisoner time to "get decent" in
		case she was using the chamber pot.</p>

		<p>"You awake, Miss Josie?" He called before he actually
		came into view.</p>

		<p>"Yes," she grumbled. "Me and everybody within a
		mile of this place, with all the noise you&#146;re making."</p>

		<p>"Sorry," he mumbled, "but I figured you&#146;d
		want to see this." He stood in front of her door with another wire held in his hand.
		By the look on his face she could tell the news was not good. She took the paper from his
		hand and glanced at it, then dropped it to the floor with the rest. The judge was arriving
		that afternoon, and wanted to get the hearing under way immediately.</p>

		<p>"Nothing from Rebecca or the governor?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "No, but I did find out that the school
		is staging a pageant this afternoon. Since we use the schoolhouse as a courthouse it
		won&#146;t be possible to have a hearing there. That buys us one more day anyway."</p>

		<p>"It&#146;s just postponing the inevitable, John.
		Tomorrow&#146;s Saturday, which means no school, and no conflict with the hearing. Rebecca
		won&#146;t be here before Sunday, and by then I&#146;ll be on a train heading east."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Rebecca gazed out the window of the stagecoach where a dust devil
		gathered a collection of leaves and pieces of tumbleweeds only to scatter them again and
		move on. Since Josie had been jailed, she felt as scattered as those tumbleweeds. She
		lowered the flap once again and settled back on her seat. Across from her Genie sat with
		her head resting against the side of the coach, her eyes closed. Up until a short while
		before she had been knitting while the two women sat in silence but the rocking motion of
		the coach had apparently lulled her to sleep. Rebecca took the opportunity to study Genie
		as she slept. It was easy to see why Josie had fallen for her. If anything, she was
		prettier than Josie had described. Rebecca&#146;s emotions warred within her. She knew
		that Josie would be pleased beyond words to find that her friend had survived, and she
		would not begrudge her that happiness. But at the same time she could not help fearing
		that Josie might prefer this mature sophisticated woman who once meant everything to her.
		She felt like a country bumpkin compared to Genie, and she wanted to hate her. But when
		the coach hit a rough patch of road and Genie woke up and flashed those dimples at her,
		she couldn&#146;t help but like her. She smiled back.</p>

		<p>"Penny for your thoughts," Genie said as she resumed
		her knitting. So skilled was she that her eyes never left Rebecca&#146;s face, yet her
		fingers flew as she worked, never dropping a stitch. Genie could tell that something was
		bothering the younger woman more than Josie&#146;s current plight, and from the occasional
		looks she saw on her face, she surmised that it had something to do with herself. She
		wished there was something she could say or do that would allay her fears, but she did not
		want to assume anything until Rebecca confirmed her suspicions.</p>

		<p>"Wouldn&#146;t be money very well spent, I&#146;m afraid. My
		thoughts are kind of&#133;muddled right now."</p>

		<p>"Can I help?" The look of concern on her face and the
		sincerity in her voice brought tears to Rebecca&#146;s eyes. Genie set aside her knitting
		and moved from her side of the coach to sit beside Rebecca, grateful that her husband had
		been able to arrange for a private coach to transport them to the train depot. She put her
		arm around Rebecca&#146;s shoulders and gently pulled the young woman&#146;s head down to
		rest on her shoulder. The act of kindness only seemed to make Rebecca cry harder, and she
		began to sob outright. Genie stroked her cheek with her free hand and lightly kissed her
		hair as she murmured softly, "Shhh, its going to be all right. Everything will be
		fine. We&#146;ll get there in time; don&#146;t worry." She continued to stroke
		Rebecca&#146;s face and hold her until the sobbing stopped and Rebecca pulled away.</p>

		<p>"I-I don&#146;t know what I&#146;d do if I&#133;lost
		her."</p>

		<p>"She&#146;s not going anywhere Rebecca. William will be
		there as soon as he finishes his business, and he promised he wouldn&#146;t let them
		extradite her before he has a chance to hear her case himself."</p>

		<p>"That&#146;s not&#133;the only way to lose her,"
		Rebecca said so softly Genie almost didn&#146;t hear her.</p>

		<p>"You love her very much, don&#146;t you?" Rebecca
		nodded, unable to trust herself to speak without bursting into tears again. Genie took
		Rebecca&#146;s hand in both of hers lightly caressing it as she spoke. "I love her
		too, Rebecca. She was the first person to ever make me believe that I could be and do
		anything I wanted to be. Remembering her strength was what allowed me to pack up and leave
		my father; I knew Josie would have wanted me to stand up for myself, and I did. Any time I
		found myself in a tough spot in my life I asked myself, what would Josie do in this
		situation? And I think I made some very good choices. Marrying William was one choice I
		was not so certain about when I did it. In my heart I was grieving for Josie, and I almost
		felt I was being unfaithful without even truly recognizing the feeling for what it was.
		But as the years went by I grew to love him, even more so after our children were born.
		He&#146;s such a kind and gentle father. The girls adore him, and so do I. I am where I
		belong, Rebecca. I will always love Josie, but not the way you do. And if she loves you
		half as much as I can tell you love her, I&#146;d say the two of you are where you belong
		also."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Genie&#133;you&#133;. I don&#146;t know what to say.
		Thank you. I feel like such a baby, but I couldn&#146;t...stop thinking about how she
		looked when she told me about you. She loved you more than anything else in the world. I
		got jealous just listening to her, and I didn&#146;t even know you were alive. Then I meet
		you and find that you&#146;re the perfect woman&#133;"</p>

		<p>Genie threw back her head and laughed. She laughed so hard tears
		came to her eyes. "Perfect woman? Oh darlin&#146; I am so far from perfect I
		can&#146;t even see it from here. But thanks for the complement. And the laugh. Thought I
		was going to bust a gut." Genie&#146;s laughter was infectious and Rebecca found
		herself joining in. Soon they both had tears of laughter streaming down their faces, and a
		bond of friendship had been welded that would last through their lifetimes.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Josie formed a mental picture of the judge as she listened to him
		sputter and argue with the sheriff in the outer office. She pegged him for one of those
		balding banty roosters with a beer belly and drooping mustaches. He was the type who would
		cross the street to avoid passing too close to an Indian, and when forced to deal with
		them as human beings he would look down his long pointy nose with an attitude of
		superiority. She had known dozens just like that in her lifetime; Genie&#146;s father was
		a prime example of the breed. The shame of it was that these little petty tyrants
		frequently rose to positions of authority and power where they could impose their will
		over people whose only crime was that their skin was not white.</p>

		<p>"And I don&#146;t know why you didn&#146;t tell the teacher
		to cancel that damned recital when you knew I had to be out of town by Sunday," the
		judge thundered.</p>

		<p>"It&#146;s not a recital. It&#146;s the Autumn Festival, and
		the children have been looking forward to it since school started. Besides, the wire from
		the governor says we are not supposed to&#133;"</p>

		<p>"To hell with that wire, man! For all I know it was sent by
		that half-breed&#146;s friend." The wire from the governor had shown up no more than
		15 minutes before the judge himself. It said that no action was to be taken in the case of
		Josie Hunter, and that he would review it upon his arrival Sunday or Monday. The judge had
		planned to be on his way to his next appointment by Sunday, and the thought of being held
		up by that Indian loving pantywaist just stuck in his craw. He truly believed that the
		wire had indeed come from William Howe as the sheriff claimed, but he was not about to
		admit it. And since he had taken the wire from the sheriff, it was his word against that
		half-breed that there even was such a wire. With luck he could be gone before the governor
		arrived, after making sure that Josie Hunter was on board the same eastbound train.
		"You just have the schoolhouse ready for me by 9AM tomorrow, and the first case
		I&#146;ll be hearing will be Josie Hunter."</p>

		<p>Josie heard the sound of the street door slamming followed by
		John&#146;s footsteps approaching her cell. He didn&#146;t even bother to make the noise
		he usually did to warn her of his approach; she couldn&#146;t have missed the loud
		exchange between himself and the judge unless she was deaf as a post. He knew she would be
		expecting him. Sure enough she stood leaning against the bars, her face an unreadable
		mask.</p>

		<p>"You heard?" She nodded. "He&#146;s a real prince
		of a fellow, no doubt about it."</p>

		<p>"I can tell. John, it doesn&#146;t look much like the
		cavalry is going to come riding over the hill at the last moment, so I think we need to
		come up with some alternate plans." She paused and looked into his eyes for a moment
		and continued, "That is if you still want to keep me from getting my neck
		stretched."</p>

		<p>"As long as it&#146;s within the law, I am up for
		anything," he responded emphatically.</p>

		<p>"Well then, let&#146;s put our heads together and see if we
		can come up with something."</p>

		<p>In her dream she was standing in the pouring rain watching as a
		group of men constructed a gallows with which to hang her. She was not bound or restrained
		in any way, yet she knew that running would be pointless. On the top of the platform a
		stout balding man pulled a lever to release a trap door, and a large sack of grain dropped
		through the opening and swung from the end of the rope, creaking as it moved in the
		buffeting wind. The bald man turned and looked at her with a malevolent gleam in his eye
		and said, "We&#146;re almost ready for you, half-breed." She hadn&#146;t seen
		him in years, but there was no question as to who he was - Genie&#146;s father.</p>

		<p>"I was only trying to help," she protested, knowing
		that he would not listen. He had never listened.</p>

		<p>The man took his eyes off her and glanced toward someone she
		could not make out in the heavy rain, and he beckoned to the person to come to the
		platform. "She&#146;s going to swing for what she did to you," he said to the
		distant figure. "Come and watch." As the figure drew closer she could tell that
		it was a woman, but she wore a heavy cloak with a hood and her face was completely in
		shadow. Instead of approaching the platform, the woman turned and walked toward Josie, and
		the closer she got the more familiar she seemed. When she was almost within Josie&#146;s
		reach she stopped and took the hood off her head. Light brown curls tumbled out from under
		the hood, and green eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled at the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Josie," the woman said softly as she reached out her
		hand.</p>

		<p>"Genie," she answered tremulously, reaching out her own
		hand, only to see the landscape and the beautiful vision within it dissolve into the dirty
		stone walls of her jail cell. The sound of rain persisted even as the dream faded and she
		realized that she had incorporated the actual rain into her dream, even as she had
		conjured Genie from her past. But the voice had seemed so real, and she couldn&#146;t
		shake the feeling that if she had been able to hold on to the dream for a few seconds more
		she would have been able to touch her&#133;</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m here, Josie."</p>

		<p>Josie twisted frantically around on her cot and saw the woman
		standing outside the bars of her cell. She wore a hooded cape much as the vision from her
		dream had worn and her face was obscured, but there was no mistaking that lilting voice.
		But of course that was impossible. Certainly she must still be asleep, even though she
		could swear she was wide awake. She swung her legs off the cot and stood up, taking the
		few steps required to bring her close to the bars and the specter that waited for her on
		the other side of them. She was in no hurry to wake up from this dream.</p>

		<p>"I didn&#146;t have any dinner, so you couldn&#146;t
		possibly be a bit of undigested beef."</p>

		<p>Genie laughed and pulled the hood from her head. " &#145;A
		Christmas Carol&#146;, she said as she removed the cape and draped it over her arm.
		"We took turns reading aloud from that book, remember? Your English accent was
		terrible."</p>

		<p>"And yours was&#133;" Josie&#146;s voice trailed off
		and her eyes widened. She studied the face of the woman before her, and it was Genie as
		she would have looked today if she had lived. "You&#133;you&#146;re&#133;I&#146;m not
		dreaming, am I?"</p>

		<p>"No," she said with a shake of her head, her face
		wreathed in a smile.</p>

		<p>"Genie!" Josie cried, reaching through the bars to
		grasp Genie&#146;s shoulders. She pulled her as close as she could with the iron in the
		way, and when she realized she was probably crushing her she let go of her shoulders and
		placed her hands on either side of her face. Without even thinking she brought her lips to
		Genie&#146;s and kissed her softly. "Oh, Genie I missed you so much." Tears
		welled up in her eyes and ran unchecked down her cheeks. Genie produced a handkerchief
		from her pocketbook and gently wiped the tears away.</p>

		<p>"I wanted to die when they told me you were dead. I almost
		gave up the struggle when I was dangling from that rope, but I knew you would want me to
		live, so I fought to free myself. I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re really here. And
		now&#133; how did you&#133;find me?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched the reunion of the two friends from the doorway
		leading into the cell area. She wanted to give them some time alone, even though she ached
		to take Josie in her arms and make her forget that there was anyone else in the world but
		themselves. Watching Josie kiss Genie was one of the hardest things she had ever done, but
		she reminded herself of what Genie had said and forced a smile to her face as she walked
		into the room.</p>

		<p>"I found her. Josie, meet Mrs. William Howe, wife of the
		governor of the Territory of Oklahoma."</p>

		<p>Josie turned toward the source of the voice she knew so well and
		her smile left no doubt in Rebecca&#146;s mind that even though she may love Genie, her
		heart was committed only to herself. Josie reached through the bars and said in a husky
		voice, "Come here."</p>

		<p>Rebecca grasped Josie&#146;s fingers and the outlaw pulled her
		toward the bars. When her face was within reach, Josie put her hand behind Rebecca&#146;s
		head and pulled her in for a kiss. The kiss she gave Rebecca made the one she gave Genie
		seem like the kind one might give to a visiting elderly aunt. After several moments, Genie
		cleared her throat and the lovers reluctantly separated.</p>

		<p>"I hate to&#133;interrupt, but 9 o&#146;clock isn&#146;t
		that far away, and I think we need to discuss our strategy."</p>

		<p>"The hell with that," Josie replied. "I want to
		hear all about you." She raised her voice and called to the outer office, "John,
		how about some chairs for my guests? We should get comfortable, ladies. It&#146;s going to
		be a long night."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The judge was working on his third whiskey and was just about to
		call it a night when the farmer approached his table. The man looked to have had more than
		his share of liquor, and the judge was about to brush him off as a drunken bar fly when
		the man spoke.</p>

		<p>"S&#146;cuse me, sir. Th&#146; bartender tole me you&#146;re
		the judge that&#146;s gonna be decidin&#146; whether to send Josie Hunter back to the
		states. Izzat true?"</p>

		<p>"True enough," the judge allowed. No point in
		mentioning that the governor had effectively taken the decision out of his hands. If he
		could get that half-breed out of town before the governor arrived he would deal with the
		consequences of his actions later. "What&#146;s your interest in the matter?"</p>

		<p>Without waiting for an invitation, Caleb pulled out a chair and
		sat down across from the judge. "Well, sir, my daughter has fallen under the spell of
		that she-devil, and I reckon the only way to get her away from her is to make sure that
		bitch is locked up good and tight. Until they hang her, that is. And I&#146;m the one told
		the sheriff she was coming to town and got him to arrest her, so I reckon the reward is
		mine." He held out his hand, which the judge grasped reluctantly; the man didn&#146;t
		look as if he had bathed in months. "Name&#146;s Caleb Cameron."</p>

		<p>"Sounds as if you and I have a common goal, Mr. Cameron. I
		have no use for Indians, even the so-called "peaceful" ones. And this one is
		anything but peaceful." The judge twisted the strands of his long moustache as he
		contemplated how he might use this man to his advantage. "Suppose your daughter is
		the one Josie sent off to find the governor and try to get him to over-ride my decision.
		If she shows up in town before I get a chance to rule, I think we need to get her out of
		the picture."</p>

		<p>"No problem. As long as I know I don&#146;t have to stick
		around here to get my reward, I&#146;ll just grab the girl and head on home."</p>

		<p>"You do that, Mr. Cameron. Leave Josie Hunter to me."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>When Rebecca woke to find her body spooned around a soft female
		form she instinctively cuddled closer, wrapping her arm tightly around her partners waist
		and pulling her toward her. Her nose was buried in the fragrant curls of her hair&#133;and
		her eyes flew open when she realized the smell was not Josie, but Genie. When they had
		left the jail in the wee hours of the morning there was only one room available in the
		tavern, so they had to share. Hoping that the other woman still slept, she gently eased
		her body to the side of the bed and dropped her feet to the floor. She dressed as
		noiselessly as possible and after leaving a note to let Genie know she had left for the
		jail already, she let herself out of the room.</p>

		<p>John was speaking to two men in a language Rebecca could not
		understand when she walked into his office. By the look of their clothes and the language,
		Rebecca assumed they were Cherokee. She smiled in greeting to them and then sat to wait
		for John to finish so he could unlock the door to the cells.</p>

		<p>"Help yourself to coffee, Miss Rebecca," John said with
		a nod toward the pot on top of the iron stove. "I&#146;ll only be a few
		minutes." Gratefully Rebecca poured herself a cup, which she held in her hands to
		keep the morning chill away. The rain had finally let up some time during the night, but
		the temperature was unseasonably cold. She stood by the stove and reveled in its warmth.
		John had to have been here since before dawn to get the stove going and warm up the room
		as much as he had. Perhaps he had not even gone home after seeing the women safely to the
		tavern, but had returned to the jail. She was grateful once again for the kindness of this
		gentle man, without whom she would not have had a prayer of getting Josie out of this
		mess.</p>

		<p>After the men had left, John came to join her beside the stove
		and refill his own coffee mug.</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t worry Miss Rebecca," he said confidently.
		"I have a feeling things will work out all right."</p>

		<p>Rebecca put her hand on his forearm and gave a gentle squeeze.
		"Thank you for everything, John. I don&#146;t know what we would have done without
		your help. If there&#146;s anything Josie or I can do for you I hope you&#146;ll let us
		know."</p>

		<p>He looked slightly embarrassed when she leaned in and kissed him
		on the cheek, and his eyes seemed to be glued to a spot on the floor. Rebecca poured a
		second cup of coffee to take in to Josie and began to walk toward the cells when
		John&#146;s voice stopped her.</p>

		<p>"Miss Rebecca, I wonder if you&#146;d consider&#133;that is,
		when this is all over, would you allow me to&#133;call on you?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca couldn&#146;t believe she hadn&#146;t seen this coming.
		Her preoccupation with Josie&#146;s problems had blinded her to the look on his face that
		was so obvious now. John was such a sweet and kind man and Rebecca could not bear the
		thought of hurting him.</p>

		<p>"Oh, John, that&#146;s very sweet, and I&#146;m honored that
		you would want to court me. But I&#146;m not&#133;free to see other people. My heart is
		committed to another."</p>

		<p>He had been so taken with the lovely young women and felt so
		badly for her when her father made the remark about being stuck with her because she was
		tainted by the company she kept. He had assumed there was no man in her life &#150;
		mistakenly, it would seem.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m sorry, I didn&#146;t realize. I&#133;you never
		mentioned having a beau, so&#133;"</p>

		<p>"That&#146;s because I don&#146;t." She looked at him
		and said pointedly, "But I do have a lover."</p>

		<p>His brow furrowed for a moment as he considered her words, and
		then comprehension showed on his face. "Oh, of course. I should have realized.
		I&#146;m not the brightest candle on the tree, I reckon."</p>

		<p>"Don&#146;t sell yourself short. If I were in the market for
		a man, you are exactly the type I would be interested in. And I&#146;m sure there are
		plenty of women out there who would be proud to walk on your arm."</p>

		<p>He simply nodded and walked to the door leading into the cells
		and unlocked it. He swung the door open for her and stood aside to let her pass.</p>

		<p>"I&#146;ll be going to get some breakfast now for Miss
		Josie. Can I fetch you something as well?"</p>

		<p>"I&#146;m not really hungry," she said, surprised to
		note that it was true. It was rare that she was so keyed up she couldn&#146;t think about
		eating, but the upcoming court appearance had her stomach tied up in knots.</p>

		<p>"Deputy won&#146;t be on duty for another hour or so.
		I&#146;d be obliged if you would come fetch me over at Rudy&#146;s if something comes up
		while I&#146;m gone."</p>

		<p>"Of course I will. Thanks again, John."</p>
