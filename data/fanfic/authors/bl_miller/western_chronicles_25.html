<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 25: Sinners? -->

<p>When Rebecca had recovered her strength sufficiently to travel,
		the pair set out for Wyoming Territory in search of an outlaw Josie had read about in the
		wanted posters, who was reported to have been last seen in Cheyenne. The man was known to
		have murdered a woman and her child because they got in his way as he was fleeing from a
		bank robbery. The cold-blooded murder of such innocence put him high on her list of
		fugitives to find, and she was itching to get on the road as soon as Rebecca was able.
		</p>

		<p>The long hot days of summer were shortening with the coming of
		fall, but the weather was still unusually hot and dry. The two women drew to a stop on a
		hill over looking a good-sized town spread out on the plain below them. It was close
		enough to Cheyenne to use as a starting point for tracking down the killer, but hopefully
		far enough away that he would not get wind of her nosing around. They decided that Rebecca
		should try to blend with the local population to see what she could pick up, and thought
		it would be better if they went into town separately. They watched as the overland
		stagecoach left town, and decided to send Rebecca in on foot. They found an abandoned
		corral that looked as if it was once used by the pony express before the trains came
		through, and left the wagon and Flossy there with an ample supply of water and access to
		grass. Rebecca changed into her new dress and entered town first, going to the boarding
		house and securing a room for the night. Josie rode in on horseback a short while later,
		noting the sign over the entrance to the main street proclaiming the town to be Rosewood.
		</p>

		<p>She took Phoenix to the stable and secured her lodgings before
		heading for the boardinghouse. An older woman whose brown hair was liberally salted with
		gray met her at the door. Rebecca was seated in the parlor with a glass of lemonade; Josie
		could see her over the woman's shoulder. "I am Miss Emily and this is my place."
		She looked at the tall gunslinger, brown eyes meeting blue. "I run a clean,
		respectable place here, uh...miss. I don't want any trouble," she said as her gaze
		fell on the guns on Josie's hips. Rebecca walked over and placed her hand on the old
		woman's forearm.</p>

		<p>"She's the friend I told you about. I assure you there will
		be no trouble. We're tired and really just want a place to sleep and eat." She took
		the pouch containing the money from Josie's belt and counted out six dollars for the
		lodging. Emily's eyes moved from the gunslinger to the pile of money in her hand, greed
		outweighing concern.</p>

		<p>"I don't provide meals other than morning coffee...one cup
		each," she said firmly. "Git your grub over at the Red Diamond. At least you'd
		fit in there," her last comment was directed at the woman in black. Looking down the
		street to the west of the boardinghouse was the saloon, a two-story structure with a porch
		and balcony. Several scantily clad women fanned themselves and watched the street from
		their vantage on the balcony. Red curtains adorned all the windows and several men were
		entering the saloon downstairs through the swinging doors. The hairs on the back of
		Josie's neck prickled with a warning that something was amiss. As Emily led them upstairs
		to their room, the gunslinger's eyes kept darting around, trying to pinpoint the source of
		her senses being on alert.</p>

		<p>Rebecca flopped back on the straw-filled mattress and let out a
		sigh. Josie's back was to her so the young woman was unable to see the smile that crossed
		her face before she resumed her normal stoic look. Their room was in the front, giving
		them an unobstructed view of the street below. No matter which direction she looked all
		Josie saw was the normal activities of a small town. People walking and riding about,
		storekeepers helping people load their purchases into their wagons, ladies with parasols
		walking arm in arm with well-dressed men. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Her brow
		furrowed as she tried to figure out the answer to the puzzle. "Guess we'll go get
		something to eat."</p>

		<p>"Eat? Sounds good." Rebecca smiled as she rose from the
		bed and headed for the door, reaching the handle before the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Never saw you move so fast, Rebecca," Josie teased.
		The young woman's green eyes twinkled.</p>

		<p>"Food has that effect on me," she replied. "Come
		on, you could use a good meal too."</p>

		<p>As Josie had expected, the Red Diamond was the local hangout for
		all the lower forms of life in town. Several round tables were filled with men playing
		poker while the women she had seen on the balcony earlier were either lining the bar and
		stairs or were trying to talk the men into giving up some of their money in the name of
		carnal pleasure. Josie allowed the corners of her lips to rise slightly. This is more like
		it, she thought to herself.</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked around the brightly-lit room, but most of her
		attention was on the common ladies of the evening that milled about. She also noted the
		looks from some of the men as they passed through the door. Most saw the tall gunslinger
		first and their faces registered the immediate fear. Those that managed to see past the
		woman in black and spotted her wore looks of undisguised lust. She felt like a sheep
		surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves and moved deliberately close to Josie, silently
		indicating that she had protection.</p>

		<p>"Whiskey," Josie said brusquely as she sat down on a
		stool at the bar, indicating with her eyes that her companion should sit next to her. The
		barkeep quickly produced a shot glass and the bottle. He looked to Rebecca for her order.
		</p>

		<p>"Sarsaparilla," she said quietly, not wanting the
		others in the place to hear. The barkeep snorted and went to look for the bottle of soda
		that he was certain was around somewhere, all the while thinking that the tall woman and
		short blonde made an odd couple</p>

		<p>Josie drained her shot of liquor and refilled her glass. A burly
		man who reeked of unwashed skin and clothes that hadn't seen soap in far too long came up
		behind them. Both women smelled him before he made his presence known by slapping his
		grimy hand on Rebecca's shoulder. "And just how much would ye be costin' me, little
		one?" His rancid breath made her forget about food.</p>

		<p>"Just a broken arm," Josie snarled as she moved with
		lightning speed off her seat and grabbed his arm, twisting it off her companion's shoulder
		and up behind his back. "Apologize," she hissed in his ear, pressing his arm
		upward sharply, driving home her point. "I said apologize to the lady."</p>

		<p>"S-sorry," he grumbled, his eyes tight from the pain
		shooting through his shoulder. "Now please...let me go."</p>

		<p>Josie took a long look around the saloon, making eye contact with
		all that were paying attention with a silent warning. She released her grip and stepped
		back, waiting to see if the man was stupid enough to fight her. Fortunately for him, the
		idea of slipping back into an alcoholic haze was more enticing then going up against the
		taller and better-armed woman. He muttered something unintelligible and moved on back to
		his table. Josie resumed her seat next to Rebecca, whose eyes never left the gunslinger.
		"Thank you," she said. Josie nodded and downed another drink.</p>

		<p>Josie ordered two dinners and looked around for the table she
		wanted. With Rebecca and the bottle in tow, she walked through the crowd and glared at the
		four men until they decided to take their card game somewhere else. She took the seat
		against the wall, affording her a clear view of the whole room, but not the stairs, which
		ran up the wall behind her. Rebecca reached for the chair opposite Josie, but the
		gunslinger indicated with her hand to take the chair next to her. At first the young woman
		thought it was because she wanted to talk to her, but she quickly realized that the bounty
		hunter didn't want her view of the doorway blocked. She downed two more drinks before
		dinner finally arrived. Both women were certain that they didn't want to know the origin
		of the meat in the lukewarm stew.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was halfway through the greasy stew when she noticed the
		gunslinger staring intently at a man sitting by himself in the far corner. His hat was
		pulled down over his eyes, obscuring most of his face. She reached over and lightly placed
		her fingertips on Josie's forearm to get her attention. "You know him?" she
		whispered. The bounty hunter's eyes never left her quarry.</p>

		<p>"He's wanted. I saw him in the group of wanted posters I
		looked at before."</p>

		<p>"Wanted for what?"</p>

		<p>"Rape and murder. That's Lefty Brown." Her eyes
		narrowed slightly. A commotion in the street drew everyone's attention to the door.
		"Stay here," Josie said firmly as she rose from her chair, her hands never far
		from her pistols.</p>

		<p>Outside the crowd had begun to gather, listening earnestly to the
		preacher standing atop a barrel. "Well, if it ain't ol' Reverend Righteous
		himself," one of the men behind Josie snorted.</p>

		<p>"Citizens of Rosewood, hear me. These sinners must be
		stopped. They bring nothing but disease and degradation to our fair town." His deep
		voice boomed over the crowd, drawing yells of approval. John Righteous, as he was called,
		stroked his short black beard as he thought of his next statement. "These
		harlots...these whores bring disease to our men, engaging in the vilest of acts," he
		said, the venom clear in his voice. Several of the women in question looked down from the
		balcony. The crowd outside the saloon grew as people poured out of every building to join
		the fray. Righteous smiled. All was going according to plan. "These whores must be
		stopped before they ruin all of us, so sayeth the lord," he shouted the last words.
		</p>

		<p>"So sayeth the lord!" the crowd responded. Josie now
		knew what made her so concerned earlier. She moved away from the door, not caring who she
		shoved out of her way, to reach Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Go out the back door and get back to the boarding
		house."</p>

		<p>"Josie..."</p>

		<p>"Now!" she growled, grabbing Rebecca firmly by the
		upper arm and hauling her out of her seat. "Rebecca, please just do what I say and
		ask questions later."</p>

		<p>The young woman nodded, but the fear still remained on her face.
		Josie led her over to the black oak door and slid the bolt. "Go, I'll get there when
		I can. Pack up our stuff, just in case." She waited until Rebecca was out the door,
		then bolted up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p>

		<p>Josie used her brute strength to bust down the first door she
		reached and entered the room. It held only a small table, lamp, and bed. The window was
		open, leading to the balcony. She pulled the curtains down to get them out of her way,
		opened the window, and leaned out. "Over here!" she called, catching the
		attention of the now frightened harlots. The crowd was now whipped up to a frenzied level,
		totally entranced by the reverend and his poisonous words. From her position at the
		window, Josie heard the calls for lynching from the mob.</p>

		<p>"No, my friends, hanging them will not end the
		scourge!" Reverend Righteous shouted, quieting the crowd done. "No....More will
		come to replace them....We need to cleanse this bastion of evil. From the ashes shall grow
		a new place free from sin."</p>

		<p>Josie's eyes widened, as she understood the reverend's
		intentions. "Move!" she yelled, breaking the whore's attention from the crowd.
		"Let's go; this place is going to burn!" she barked. One by one, she helped the
		women through the window. Most headed down the stairs and out the back door, but some ran
		to their rooms and grabbed whatever personal belongings they could carry in their arms
		before escaping.</p>

		<p>"Is that it?" Josie asked the young woman as she
		crawled through the window, stumbling when the gunslinger reached out with one hand and
		jerked her in the rest of the way. Already she could see the torches being lit. Her gun
		was raised in her left hand as she took a quick look out to make sure no women were still
		out there. In all, seven whores were waiting for her by the time she made it out the back
		door. The first torch sailed through the front window, smashing it to pieces.</p>

		<p>Josie looked around at the seven women. They looked at her
		expectantly, waiting for her to tell them what to do next. In her concern to get them out
		of the building, she never gave much thought about what to do with them afterwards. She
		ran her fingers through her raven hair while she took a moment to think.</p>

		<p>"Do any of you have horses?" the shaking of heads
		caused her hopes for a quick escape to sink. One woman stepped forward, her flaming red
		hair billowing in the warm breeze.</p>

		<p>"I've got two horses and a wagon at the corral. Be big
		enough to get us out of town," she said.</p>

		<p>"Good, we'll get it after dark," Josie replied. She
		looked around. Apparently the mob was too focused on their task to notice that they were
		missing. "Let's go," she said, hoping in her mind that Rebecca's powers of
		persuasion would work.</p>

		<p>"Absolutely not, I won't hear of it," Emily said firmly
		as she shook her head. "It's bad enough that I let this...this..." she tried to
		find just the right word to describe the tall woman in black without insulting her.
		"...person be here, but there is no way on god's green earth that I'm going to allow
		my home to be used as a hideout for those sinners."</p>

		<p>"Look at them," Rebecca said, trying to get the old
		woman to at least cast a glance at the whores. "Do you think they wanted to be doing
		this? Do you think they want to sell their bodies for money to drunken men?" She
		avoided looking at the whores herself, afraid that they would take her words the wrong
		way. "Don't you think their lives would have been different if they had been given a
		chance?"</p>

		<p>"They're sinners!" Emily shot back.</p>

		<p>"And you're not? You've never committed a sin? What about
		the men who pay for their services? Aren't they sinners too? Yet you let them stay here.
		Why are they any different?" Rebecca watched as the hard lines on the woman's face
		softened a bit at the logic of her words. She pressed on, knowing that the advantage was
		hers. "Most of these women never had the chance that you had. What would you do to
		feed yourself if you didn't have this boarding house?" She paused for effect.
		"Give them this one chance; let them stay until tonight. Then I promise that we'll
		get them out of here."</p>

		<p>Before Emily could answer, another loud commotion ensued outside.
		The angry mob, in their haste to burn down the saloon, forgot that there were buildings on
		either side of it. Both the assayer's and the telegraph office were now on fire. The
		bucket brigade had been started, with young boys running back and forth from the rain
		barrels with pails and buckets, handing them over to the grown men that were desperately
		trying to save that side of the street. Josie looked out the window, her eyes carefully
		scanning the street. She turned around and addressed the group of women.</p>

		<p>"Now is the perfect time to get out of here."</p>

		<p>Even though she felt she hadn't been spotted rescuing the whores,
		Josie nevertheless felt it safest for Rebecca if they left town as well before the mob
		realized what had happened. The only obstacle for them was Phoenix, who was stabled at the
		opposite end of town from the corral where Stacey's wagon and horses were kept. With as
		much stealth as was possible for seven brightly colored ladies in billowing dresses, they
		slipped around the back of the buildings and made their way up to the corral. Josie led
		the group with Rebecca never more than an arm's length away from her. One gun was drawn in
		the unlikely event that they were seen.</p>

		<p align="left">No one noticed the wagon pull out of the corral and
		leave town, nor did they notice the tall woman in black climbing from rooftop to rooftop
		as she made her way down the street to the stable. It took no time at all for Josie to
		saddle her steed and make her escape unnoticed. She rode Phoenix hard, forcing her into a
		full out gallop as soon as they cleared the burning town. The fire had spread rapidly
		traveling along the rooftops until the entire side of the street was burning. The banker
		was screaming frantically at the sheriff, who was busy trying to calm down the assayer,
		who was screaming about chemicals. The town was almost out of her sight when the
		explosions started. Josie guided Phoenix in a wide arc around the outskirts until she was
		finally heading in the same direction as the wagon. There was no doubt in the gunslinger's
		mind that the men of the town would be far too busy trying to save it to bother trying to
		round up a posse. She slowed the horse down to a less punishing gait and followed the twin
		rows of tracks laid down by the wagon. The hoof prints indicated that Stacey had slowed
		her horses down, so there was no need for the gunslinger to push her beloved mare. Within
		two miles, she caught up to the women. Rebecca was sitting in the back of the open wagon,
		chatting animatedly with several of the younger ladies of ill repute. Josie moved Phoenix
		in front of the wagon and led them off the trail for several miles before finding what she
		considered to be a safe place to stop. A small stream nearby would provide water and the
		gunslinger was certain she could round up some kind of meat for them to eat.</p>
