<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 17: Nightmares and Understandings -->

<p>It was after two when Rebecca woke to her bedmate thrashing about
		in the throes of another vicious nightmare. Josie's arms flailed about, barely missing her
		face. Once again Rebecca took the outlaw in her arms and softly began to sing. Between
		verses she whispered that it was all a dream and that everything was all right. In the
		darkness of the night, she heard the older woman whimper softly before falling into a more
		dreamless state. She continued to sing and stroke Josie's hair gently until she was
		certain that she was past the nightmare. She would be wakened twice more during the night
		by the outlaw's demons and both times she would calm the woman back to restful sleep.
		Rebecca allowed herself to feel the mixed emotions of wishing that the nightmares didn't
		happen and the pleasure in being able to soothe Josie's troubled sleep as she finally
		succumbed again to the sandman. </p>

		<p>Rebecca awoke to find herself alone in the room, the sun shining
		brightly. With a groan, she buried her head under the pillow to block out the light and
		tried for a few more minutes of sleep. The sound of the door opening caused her to poke
		her head up from under the pillow, look at the bright eyed and wide awake gunslinger,
		groan and put her head back down. "Five more minutes," she mumbled. </p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's after nine already. I've been up for at least
		three hours. Let's go." She set the two mugs of coffee down on the table. "I
		mean it." </p>

		<p>"I'm up, I'm up," she grumbled before sitting up and
		stretching. She plodded over to the table and flopped down in the chair, muttering a thank
		you as she took her mug. </p>

		<p>"You're not a morning person, are you?" Josie asked
		before taking a gulp of her coffee and grimacing. "Damn, this is strong. Miss
		Patricia must be trying to kill us so she can rent this room out to someone else."
		</p>

		<p>Rebecca chuckled and took a sip from hers. "Ugh, I think
		you're right," she said as she forced the bitter brew down her throat. In the moment
		of silence, she decided to broach the subject of the nightmares. "Josie, do you
		remember the nightmares you had last night?" She watched the gunslinger stiffen
		noticeably. "It's okay if you don't want to talk about it, but I know that it helps
		sometimes to talk about them." </p>

		<p>"There's nothing to talk about, Rebecca. I don't remember
		it," she lied. Even in the light of day, her mind replayed the visions that tormented
		her during the night. </p>

		<p>"Well, if you wanted to talk about it, I just wanted you to
		know that you could...with me, I mean," she said before drinking the rest of her
		coffee and standing up. Josie nodded noncommittally. Rebecca stepped behind the privy
		screen and started to get dressed. "So where did you go?" </p>

		<p>"I had to get some information. You know what you said about
		being a bounty hunter does make sense." </p>

		<p>"Well yeah, you can get into places where regular bounty
		hunters couldn't. You know how these men think, how they act." She tried to tighten
		the laces on her corset, but this particular one tied in the back. "Josie, can you
		help me with this?" Seconds later she felt strong fingers pulling the laces into
		place and tying them off. "Thanks," she said as she turned around and looked up
		at the tall woman. "You know, I really do hate corsets." </p>

		<p>"Me too, that's why I don't wear them," Josie said,
		allowing a small smile to come to her lips. "Now, I have a list of names of men that
		would bring in a fair amount of money with little effort." They went back to the
		table and sat down. Rebecca busied herself with brushing her shoulder length hair. Josie
		took another gulp of coffee and continued. "Cletus Wilson is a no good bully with a
		bounty of a hundred dollars on his head here in Tombstone. I went to the watering hole
		this morning and found out where he's hiding." </p>

		<p>"How did...?" Rebecca smiled and shook her head.
		"After seeing you in action yesterday, I'm sure I don't want to know." </p>

		<p>Josie flashed a smile full of teeth, quite proud of her
		intimidation tactics. "You probably don't, sprite. Now I want you to stay here or at
		the Doc's place until I return." </p>

		<p>"Okay.", she nodded. "But promise you'll be
		careful?" </p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." </p>

		<p>"Sorry, but I do worry about you," she protested.
		"Someone has to." </p>

		<p>"Well, I think you worry enough about me for the both of us.
		Now don't go anywhere until I return." </p>
