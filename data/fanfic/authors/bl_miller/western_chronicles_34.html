<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 34: Endings and Beginnings -->

<p>"They want to leave?", Josie asked as she took her
		shot, sinking</p>

		<p>the four ball cleanly in the corner pocket.</p>

		<p>"Yup. Both of them. I can understand Stacey, what with the
		shooting and all," Sandy replied as she watched the seven ball fall into the side
		pocket. "And Victoria, well, I think your Rebecca had something to do with that. She
		said she wasn't doing no more whoring."</p>

		<p>"What is she going to do?" She passed the cue back to
		the blonde madam and ignored the 'your Rebecca' remark. "From what I understand, she
		doesn't have any skills."</p>

		<p>"I don't know, Josie. She's still young. Maybe she can find
		herself a man and have a family." She bent over and took aim. "Of course she
		can't do that around here; someone might pass through town and recognize her from
		Rosewood." Sandy pulled her arm back and let loose, sending two balls into the
		pocket. Unfortunately, one of them was the cue ball. Josie held her hand out for the
		stick, her face an unreadable mask.</p>

		<p>"Think she'd make it if she wasn't around here?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know. Even without an education, she's a smart
		girl. I imagine if she gets somewhere where she can make a new start she'd be okay,"
		the madam said. "Don't know her too well, though. You'd be better off asking Elaine
		or even Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Hmm." Josie let the conversation drop as she took her
		shot, letting out a low growl, as the eight ball bounced off the green felt bumper. She
		set the cue stick down on the pool table. "Sandy, I have to go somewhere. Keep an eye
		on Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"Well, that should be no problem. She's probably with
		Victoria anyway. Where are you going?" Sandy asked.</p>

		<p>"Express office."</p>

		<p>Despite Rebecca's best efforts at dinner to get the gunslinger to
		tell her why she had to go to the express office, Josie adamantly refused. It was half
		past eight and they were settled in for the night in their room, the bounty hunter
		cleaning and polishing her guns and the young woman studying her medical text. The blonde
		head poked up from behind the large book. "Did you send a telegram somewhere?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." she warned gently.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Josie. If you'd just tell me what you were up to
		then I wouldn't bother you about it," she coaxed, anxious to quench her curiosity.
		The gunslinger merely smirked and continued to rub the cloth over the steel.</p>

		<p>"Nope.", she said smugly, watching Rebecca get more and
		more frustrated.</p>

		<p>"Josie...come on, tell me."</p>

		<p>"Nope."</p>

		<p>"Please? I'll give you a backrub."</p>

		<p>"Nope," she said, even though the offer was tempting.
		Not being on the road, there had really been no physical activity to strain her back. The
		scuffle with Lance was nothing. Josie missed those moments when she could relax and let
		her friend rub the tension out of her. But she wasn't going to give in on this one, no
		matter what Rebecca tried.</p>

		<p>"Josie...you know I'm just going to keep asking until you
		tell me, so you might as well just tell me now and get it over with," she grinned
		mischievously.</p>

		<p>"Nope."</p>

		<p>"Please?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Come on, please?" Each time she asked only served to
		make her more aggravated, much to the gunslinger's amusement. She could just imagine what
		Rebecca was like on Christmas.</p>

		<p>"I'm going downstairs to take a bath," Josie said,
		rising. The young woman was about to beg again when the words registered. Rebecca lifted
		her arm slightly and lowered it quickly. The hot afternoon had done nothing to help her
		aroma.</p>

		<p>"Um, Josie?" she asked with all seriousness, the change
		in tone drawing the gunslinger's attention to her and away from the door handle that her
		fingers were about to close on. "If you don't mind, I'll watch the door for you if
		you watch the door for me? I'd um...feel safer with you there," she said, fairly
		certain that Josie would agree, especially after the way the gunslinger reacted to seeing
		the flimsy lock yesterday. What Rebecca didn't expect was the momentary look of affection
		on her face. Josie picked up the second towel and held it out to her.</p>

		<p>"Come on," she said with a gentle smile, understanding
		what the offer truly was. 'Never fear, Rebecca; I'll always protect you,' she thought as
		she watched the young blonde grab her nightgown from the edge of the bed.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Josie, I know you sent a telegram. Come on, where'd you
		send it?" she asked through the closed door. The raven-headed woman lifted her leg
		straight up in the air.</p>

		<p>"Give up, Rebecca ...and stop yelling through the
		door," she called. "If you want to talk to me then come in here." She
		washed and lowered her leg back into the warm water. Josie watched the latch slowly lift
		and the door open. She didn't bother to twist the useless piece of wood when she entered,
		knowing full well that even without her weapons, she could handle anything that happened.
		The clawfoot tub was not really deep enough for the tall woman, causing the water to lap
		gently against the underside of her breasts. Rebecca entered and trying not to look at the
		naked woman, she crossed the room to sit on the floor with her back against the porcelain
		and steel fixture. Josie laughed lightly. "You don't have to sit on the floor,
		Rebecca. There's a perfectly good stool over there, just scootch it over."</p>

		<p>"Uh...no, I can't. I'm fine here, really," she said,
		her embarrassment showing. Josie smiled softly, although the little blonde couldn't see
		it.</p>

		<p>"You've seen me naked before, Rebecca." She did her
		best to keep her tone gentle and understanding, not wanting to do anything to further
		embarrass her young friend.</p>

		<p>"Well, yeah, but only for a few seconds while you're
		changing.</p>

		<p>We've never talked with you...like that." She kept her eyes
		focused on a knot in the door panel.</p>

		<p>"I sleep topless against you every night," Josie tried
		again.</p>

		<p>"I know...and I know I'm being silly," Rebecca said,
		turning her head toward the gunslinger, but not far enough to see anything. A long wet arm
		slipped out of the tub and lightly patted the blonde head.</p>

		<p>"It's all right, Rebecca. If you're more comfortable there,
		that's fine. I'll tell you what, why don't you tell me a story," Josie said, hoping
		to make her more comfortable. It really was annoying to have to turn around every time the
		young woman got dressed or undressed.</p>

		<p>"Which one do you want to hear?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know...tell me something I haven't heard
		before," the gunslinger replied as she lathered up the cloth until it was covered
		with a bubbly white foam. She twisted her arm up behind her and tried to wash her back,
		grunting as she stretched her fingertips to try and reach that one area that was always
		impossible to get to.</p>

		<p>"What are you doing?" Rebecca asked, getting to her
		knees as she twisted to see Josie.</p>

		<p>"Trying to wash my back, what does it look like I'm
		doing?" she replied testily.</p>

		<p>"Well, if you'd ask for help," the young woman replied
		as she rose to her feet and walked over to the corner. She picked up the stool and set it
		down at the head of the tub. "Lean forward please," Rebecca said as she took the
		soapy cloth from the long fingers and started to wash her friend's broad shoulder. Josie
		reached back and gathered the long black tresses in her hand, pulling it to one side and
		out of the way so the young woman could continue her task.</p>

		<p>Rebecca hummed a tune as she continued to run the washcloth over
		the gunslinger's back, gently rubbing the well-defined muscles as she passed over them.
		Josie closed her eyes and let her head fall forward, her hair spilling forward, the black
		tips sinking into the soapy water. "How's that feel?"</p>

		<p>"Mmm, good," the gunslinger murmured, lulled into
		relaxation by the gentle hands sliding over her skin, aided by the soap. Rebecca dipped
		the washcloth back into the water before raising it and squeezing the water out over
		Josie's shoulder. She repeated the procedure until she was certain that every last trace
		of soap was off. Only then did she drape the cloth over the edge of the tub and sit back
		on the stool. She was disappointed slightly that it was over. Rebecca didn't know what it
		was, but there was just something so enjoyable about giving the stronger woman a massage.
		To feel those strong muscles loosen under her touch, to see the small smile that formed on
		Josie's face, to know that there was something that she could do, no matter how small,
		that made the older woman feel comfortable and relaxed. Twice that she was sure of Rebecca
		had made the gunslinger fall asleep. She wished that Josie would ask for backrubs more
		often.</p>

		<p>The raven-headed woman took the now cool cloth from the side of
		the tub. "Thanks, Rebecca," Josie said as she quickly finished up, the water now
		cooled down to an uncomfortable level. "Could you hand me the towel please?"</p>

		<p>"Oh...um, yeah." Rebecca stood up and retrieved Josie's
		towel from the shelf. She held it out and waited for the gunslinger to rise and exit the
		tub.</p>

		<p>"Thanks," Josie said as she took the towel and began
		drying off.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I forgot!" Rebecca exclaimed. "I put water on
		to heat.</p>

		<p>It's probably all boiled away by now." She couldn't keep the
		disappointment from showing on her face. She had been looking forward to soaking away all
		the sweat and dust. "I'd better go see."</p>

		<p>Josie watched the door close behind the young woman. She rolled
		her shoulders, enjoying the lack of tension within them. She picked up the clean pair of
		drawers and stepped into them, pulling them up just as she heard a soft knock on the door.
		"Josie? Can you get the door? My hands are full." The gunslinger pushed her arms
		through the sleeves of her shirt, letting it hang loosely on her body as she headed toward
		the door.</p>

		<p>The stronger woman opened the door and took the two heavy pails
		from Rebecca, careful not to pinch the blonde's fingers during the exchange. Within
		seconds, both pails were emptied into the tub, causing wisps of steam to rise. "Guess
		you didn't boil it away," she said as she set the empty containers on the floor.</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca said in a relieved tone. "I guess
		the stove wasn't that hot." She stood there for a moment and then asked hesitantly,
		"Josie...aren't you going to leave?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, I'll wait outside," she said, buttoning up her
		shirt as she headed for the door. The gunslinger had thought that the young woman had
		wanted her to stay and wash her back. 'Sprite, you really need to get over this modesty,'
		Josie thought to herself as she closed the door behind her and flopped down on the nearby
		stool. She leaned her head against the wall behind her and closed her eyes, planning on
		taking a short catnap while Rebecca soaked.</p>

		<p>Josie heard in one instant the splash of water, the startled cry,
		and the thud. She leapt to her feet and flung open the door in time to see Rebecca lying
		on the floor, one foot still on the side of the tub. "Are you all right?" the
		gunslinger asked as she knelt down next to her and helped the young woman get her leg down
		and sit up. "Did you get hurt?" she asked. Rebecca shook her head, waving her
		hand to say that she was fine.</p>

		<p>"Just my pride, I guess." A slight tinge of
		embarrassment colored her cheeks. She drew her knees up and rested her arms on her knees,
		her back against the tub. "I'm fine, Josie." She looked at the door expectantly.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca..." she said sternly. "If you think I'm
		going to take a chance of you falling again, you're sadly mistaken. You're lucky you
		didn't crack your head on the side of the tub." The gunslinger felt her heartbeat
		slowly return to normal. Once she had slipped in a tub and been knocked out; only her long
		frame kept her from slipping under the water and drowning. Josie stood up and held her
		hand out.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine. Go on, I'll be all right now," Rebecca said,
		not moving from her position against the tub. The gunslinger noted that the young woman's
		position did nothing to hide her personal areas from view. She knew that Rebecca had to be
		a bit shook up from the fall, but it still didn't make sense that she made no attempt to
		cover herself yet still insisted on being left alone.</p>

		<p>"Stand up and let me help you into the tub," she said
		firmly, regretting her tone the instant she saw the sad look in the green eyes. For a long
		moment, neither moved from her respective position. Rebecca reached out tentatively and
		took Josie's hand, allowing the taller woman to help her to her feet. She faced the
		gunslinger, green eyes locking with blue as she lifted one leg up and into the slippery
		tub. She felt the strong hand grip hers tighter as she lifted the other leg and stepped
		in. Rebecca twisted and sat down in the tub careful not to move so fast as to make the
		water splash out. She leaned her back against the slight slant of the end and looked up at
		Josie. "I'm in now," she said, stating the obvious.</p>

		<p>"I see that," the gunslinger said as she moved to the
		head of the tub and sat down on the stool. "Since I'm here I might as well wash your
		back, seeing as how you washed mine."</p>

		<p>"Josie?" came the small voice, "I-I don't want you
		to, okay?"</p>

		<p>Instantly the raven headed woman moved to the side of the tub and
		knelt down until she was eye level with the now visibly upset woman. Josie folded her arms
		and leaned against the cool porcelain, her face showing her concern. "What's got you
		so scared, sprite? What are you afraid of me finding out?" she asked gently, silently
		willing her friend to confide in her, to trust her with whatever was wrong. A thought
		occurred to her. "Rebecca, are you afraid of me?"</p>

		<p>"No!" she sat up and caught the blue eyes with her own.
		"It's not you, Josie, honest," the blonde lowered her head, staring at her hands
		underwater. It took only seconds for Rebecca to lose the battle to control her emotions.
		Her heart told her to take the chance and a small voice in her mind screamed at her not to
		tell. The green eyes closed yet the tears still came unbidden, leaking out to leave wet
		trails down her cheeks.</p>

		<p>Rebecca found herself instantly enfolded in strong,
		flannel-covered arms. Her tears gave way to outright sobs and she wrapped her arms around
		Josie's neck, squeezing tightly. The gunslinger held her, unmindful of the hard tub
		pressing against her ribs. Nothing mattered except trying to get her friend calmed down.
		Josie pulled her closer, the shift causing her to look over the blonde's shoulder and
		there she saw what had gotten her so upset.</p>

		<p>There was no need for words; the faded scars told the tale all
		too clearly. Josie swallowed and took a deep breath to quell her rising anger and outrage
		at the sight. She felt the small woman stiffen in her arms and she held tight. "No,
		it's okay, sprite. It's okay. I know." She repeated the words over and over like a
		mantra into the young woman's ear, rocking her gently in the process. Josie was dimly
		aware of a growing pain in her ribs from the tub, but chose to ignore it. Her friend was
		more important at the moment.</p>

		<p>In the darkness of the older woman's comforting shoulder, Rebecca
		cried. She cried for the pain of a young girl who only wanted to be loved. She cried for
		the loss of happiness and joy within herself at the hands of those who were supposed to
		protect and care for her. She cried until no more tears were left; only the feeling of a
		great weight removed from her. Rebecca took several deep haggard breaths before pulling
		back from Josie's embrace. They sat there silently, both needing time to compose
		themselves. The bounty hunter's hand went to her own ribs, touching lightly and wincing at
		the pain. She didn't realize how hard she had been pressing against the tub. "You
		okay?" Rebecca asked softly, her voice a bit raspy.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine. What about you?" Josie asked as she moved
		back to the stool, her back protesting from being kept in that position for so long.</p>

		<p>The young woman nodded slightly, both knowing that it wasn't the
		complete truth. "This water's getting cold."</p>

		<p>"Well then let's get you washed up quickly, shall we?"
		Josie replied, grabbing the soapy washcloth. With the gentleness of a washerwoman cleaning
		the floor, she scrubbed the smaller woman's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Hey!"</p>

		<p>"Sorry," she replied, leaning forward and giving
		Rebecca a lopsided grin. "I guess I'm not used to washing other people. I'll go
		easier."</p>

		<p>Josie wrapped the cloth around two of her fingers and gently
		rubbed the young woman's other shoulder, using small circular motions. Her lips set in a
		tight line when her hand passed over the most prominent streak of white against Rebecca's
		skin. 'I guess you're not such an innocent after all, are you sprite?' she thought. 'You
		should have been protected from him, from his rage. How could anyone raise his hand to
		someone as gentle and caring as you?' "Never again," she said, realizing that
		she had spoken aloud.</p>

		<p>"What?" Rebecca asked as she turned in the tub to face
		her. Josie handed her the washcloth and forced a smile.</p>

		<p>"I said I'm done. Finish up," the gunslinger lied. She
		waited until the young woman was done and helped her out of the tub before leaving her to
		dry off and get dressed.</p>

		<p>Leaning against the wall outside the washroom, Josie's mind raced
		while she waited for Rebecca to finish. She tried to think of all the reasons why having
		the young woman stay with her was no good. It was too dangerous. She could get hurt. A
		dozen reasons later, Josie rubbed her face with her hands vigorously and sighed. The
		decision was made.</p>

		<p>Once in their room, Josie turned the lamp down and joined Rebecca
		in bed. As had quickly become the habit, the gunslinger wrapped her arm around the smaller
		woman's waist and curled up against her back. Both lay there, wide-awake and deep in
		thought. "Can't sleep?" the blonde inquired. Josie propped herself up on one
		elbow and looked down at Rebecca, who rolled onto her back to look at her companion.</p>

		<p>"Do you..." the gunslinger began. "Do you want to
		stay with me?</p>

		<p>Traveling from place to place with no roots and no home? Is that
		what you want?"</p>

		<p>"Josie...I had a home and a family and I was
		miserable." She lowered her eyes. "I want to stay with you, if you'll let
		me." Rebecca wanted to plead, to beg, to offer anything just to continue being with
		her friend, her protector. But she held back, still not daring to hope that Josie wanted
		the same thing.</p>

		<p>"You know it's dangerous...you can get hurt, or worse."</p>

		<p>"I could get hurt or worse anywhere."</p>

		<p>"Don't you want to settle down? Raise a family?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca raised herself up on one elbow, her face inches away from
		the gunslingers. "Josie, I'm not ready to settle down yet. There's too much to see,
		too much to do. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. Neither one of us has to
		be alone again." She lowered her head, her voice quavering as she continued. "I
		don't want to go back, Josie. If you don't want me to stay with you then leave me here,
		but I won't go back to Chancetown...I-I can't."</p>

		<p>"No. I won't let them hurt you again, Rebecca. Never
		again." Josie said firmly, her own outrage and anger at her friend's pain showing
		through. "I can't promise that it'll always be easy."</p>

		<p>"Are you saying that I can stay with you?" she asked
		hopefully.</p>

		<p>"Yes," was all the gunslinger could get out before she
		was knocked onto her back by the smaller woman's fierce hug. Rebecca held on tight, her
		emotions a mixture of relief and joy. Josie smiled in the darkness, feeling her own sense
		of joy at the young woman's reaction. She wrapped her own arms around Rebecca. "Yes,
		sprite, you can stay with me. I won't make you leave, I swear."</p>

		<p>Long after the young woman had fallen asleep in her arms, Josie
		lay awake, her own emotions still churning about. Her head and heart warred with each
		other over her decision, her mind telling her that someone as gentle and caring as Rebecca
		could only get hurt being around her and her heart quietly saying that she had no other
		choice. She looked down at the sleeping blonde, noting the soft smile that graced her lips
		and the gentle, even breathing of a most peaceful rest. "Neither one of us will be
		alone again. I'll die to protect you," Josie whispered before placing a soft kiss on
		the young woman's forehead and settling down to let sleep claim her.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca woke to find herself alone, a cool cup of coffee waiting
		for her on the table. She stretched and yawned, wondering where the gunslinger went at
		such an early hour. "Damn," she swore when she realized. She peeled off her
		nightgown, not bothering to notice where it landed, and quickly dressed.</p>

		<p>Josie exited the express office, telegram and draft note in hand.
		</p>

		<p>"You gonna tell me now?" She turned to see Rebecca
		sitting on the small bench next to the doorway. The young woman hopped up and stood beside
		the gunslinger, trying her hardest to steal a peek at the note.</p>

		<p>"Nope," Josie said as she folded up the papers and
		tucked them into her vest pocket. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught the frustrated
		and furious look on her young friend's face and smirked.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." She followed the gunslinger up the street,
		walking quickly to keep up with the taller woman's longer stride. "Josie...you know
		you can trust me with anything...Josie are you listening to me? What is it? Friends share
		things, you know...come on, Josie..." All she heard was a deep, throaty chuckle from
		the woman in black.</p>

		<p>Sandy watched the tall woman enter with a bemused expression on
		her face, followed closely by Rebecca, who was pestering her about something. "Why
		won't you tell me? Come on, Josie, I'm no good at surprises."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, go get Stacey and Victoria and have them meet us
		in the back room," Josie said just as Sandy reached them. "I swear I'll tell you
		what's in the note then."</p>

		<p>"Oh, okay," the young woman replied, a bit
		disappointed. "You wait, Josie," she said as she reached the stairs.
		"Someday I'm gonna have a secret and you just see if you can get it out of me,"
		she said smugly, although deep down inside she knew that she'd probably have a hard time
		keeping anything from Josie if she really wanted to know.</p>

		<p>Sandy and the gunslinger entered the back room and waited for the
		others to arrive. Josie leaned against the pool table, one leg bent and resting on the
		green felt. The madam frowned but said nothing, choosing instead to take a seat on the
		couch. Stacey, Victoria, and Rebecca entered, the two prostitutes choosing to stand at the
		end of the billiard table while the young blonde stood next to Josie. The tall woman
		looked at the two women at the end of the table. "I understand you both want to
		leave, to go somewhere and make a fresh start." Both women nodded in agreement. A
		rare public smile formed on Josie's face as she pulled the notes out of her pocket and
		unfolded them. She passed the telegram to Stacey. "There are jobs waiting for both of
		you as well as a place to stay," the gunslinger said. The redhead read the note aloud
		for Victoria.</p>

		<p>"J MOST PLEASED TO HEAR FROM YOU STOP ARRANGEMENTS MADE STOP</p>

		<p>REPORT TO MRS STANTON 128 W 140TH STOP DRAFT ATTACHED STOP SBA
		STOP", she set the telegram down and looked at Josie. "I don't...."</p>

		<p>"You both need work and somewhere to live. Mrs. Stanton
		needs two maids," the gunslinger explained. To Victoria's surprised look, she
		replied. "Mrs. Stanton is a friend of the family. I've known her since before I was
		Rebecca's age."</p>

		<p>"But I don't know nothing about being a maid," the
		young brown-headed woman protested. Josie held up her hand to forestall any more argument.</p>

		<p>"Elizabeth is a good woman, very well educated and part of
		the suffrage movement. She'll take care of you and help you find something you're suitable
		for. Most likely she'd even teach you how to read and write if you wanted."</p>

		<p>Victoria looked squarely at Rebecca. "Is this the second
		chance you were talking about?"</p>

		<p>"Yes." She moved closer and took the brown-headed
		woman's hands in her own. "I don't know this Mrs. Stanton but I do know Josie. If she
		says it's the right thing, then I believe her. Victoria, think of it; New York City. A
		place to live and an honorable job," Rebecca cast quick glances at the others.
		"No offense."</p>

		<p>"None taken, child. We know you didn't mean nothing by
		it," Sandy said. Stacey stared down at the note again.</p>

		<p>"I know that working for someone who treats women as people
		and not objects is a far cry better than this," the redhead said to Victoria. She
		turned her attention to Josie. "She said there was a draft attached?"</p>

		<p>The gunslinger smiled a self-satisfied smile and nodded.
		"Plenty for both of you to take a stage to Saint Louis and then a train the rest of
		the way," she said handing Stacey the draft note. "The stage will be here in
		just over four hours. You have enough time to get to the bank and the mercantile to get
		the things you need for traveling. There's enough money for that too."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Josie?" They were lying in bed, darkness long since
		fallen.</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Do you think Victoria will be all right? I mean, what if
		she gets there and that woman doesn't like her?"</p>

		<p>"You worry too much, Rebecca. Go to sleep." She
		tightened her hold around the younger woman's waist. "She'll be fine. Elizabeth will
		make sure of it. It's not the first time she's taken people in and helped them."</p>

		<p>"You said her and the one that you sent the telegram to are
		friends of yours?" Rebecca had trouble believing that anyone who had the money and
		position to hire maids at will would be a friend to a known outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Well, Susan and her are friends of my mother's mostly. I
		know them through her," Josie explained. "They used to hold meetings with other
		suffragists at my mother's home. Victoria will be fine. Besides, Stacey's with her. Can we
		go to sleep now?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah. What time are we leaving tomorrow?" She heard
		the exasperated and rather tired sigh behind her.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, once we're up and ready to go, then we'll
		leave."</p>

		<p>"Okay."</p>

		<p>It was silent for several moments before Josie spoke. "You
		can buy all the supplies from now on."</p>

		<p>"W-what?" Rebecca said as she turned in the older
		woman's arms and faced her, the blonde's left arm trapped between their bellies. "You
		mean it?"</p>

		<p>"Of course. You get better prices than I do. I never would
		have been able to get all the supplies for the price that you did. You're good at that
		haggling stuff. Now roll over and go to sleep," Josie said, pushing gently on the
		young woman's side in an attempt to get her to move.</p>

		<p>Rebecca rolled over happily and grinned in the darkness.</p>

		<p>"I do get better prices, don't I?" she said smugly.
		"Hmm, wonder what else I do better than you."</p>

		<p>"Talk...and talk and talk," the gunslinger teased. She
		felt the light swat on her forearm and chuckled before becoming serious. "You have
		your own skills and talents, Rebecca. You just have to discover them." She snuggled
		deeper into her pillow. "Now go to sleep."</p>

		<p>"Before you shoot me?" the teasing blonde inquired.
		Both bodies shook together as they remembered the old threat and realized how funny it
		seemed to think of it now. It wasn't long before sleep claimed both the gunslinger and the
		young woman curled up in her powerful arms.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Late morning found them at the stable, readying the horses and
		wagon for departure. Despite Josie's best attempts, the good-byes from Rebecca to all the
		other women dragged on far longer than planned. It seemed that the young woman had a
		speech prepared for each one of them, the ones from Rosewood as well as the women from
		Cheyenne, whom Rebecca knew very little about. All were treated to parting wishes of the
		best for them and several offered and received hugs from the bubbling young woman. Of
		course the most they received from the gunslinger was a polite nod and a mumbled 'you're
		welcome' to the women from Rosewood's repeated thanks. Josie and Elaine exchanged a
		knowing nod and Sandy received a handshake, but no one else dared get that close to the
		well-armed woman. When all of their good-byes were said, Rebecca told Josie that she had
		an errand to run before she was ready to go, and sent her on ahead to get their gear
		stowed in the wagon and the horses ready to do.</p>

		<p>"Ready?" Josie said as she climbed up into the
		sheepskin covered seat and took the reins from Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Yeah," she said as she put her hat on and adjusted the
		brim to keep the sun out of her eyes. "Josie, how long do you think it'll take to get
		there?"</p>

		<p>"Shouldn't be more than a week, but it's not going to be an
		easy ride," the gunslinger said as she double checked the position of the Winchester
		leaning against the seat between them. "The Cimarron Cutoff is a dry and dangerous
		route, but it cuts at least five days off our journey." She turned in her seat and
		looked at Rebecca, wondering not for the first time if she shouldn't take a much longer
		yet safer route.</p>

		<p>"Is that why you bought the extra barrel for water?"
		the young woman asked, reaching back and laying her hand against the large, heavy wooden
		container. Josie nodded, not mentioning that it was also why she bought extra boxes of
		shells for the Winchester as well as for the Colts. The Cimarron cutoff was known as a
		route where ambushes were common from both bandits and renegade Indians. Josie took one
		more look at the contents of the wagon, making certain that she hadn't forgotten anything
		before they left town. Not that she would ever forget something she considered necessary
		for traveling, but there was also Rebecca to consider. Thus there was a small box of rock
		candy hidden underneath Josie's saddlebag as well as a dime novel called 'Tom Sawyer' that
		she had seen the young woman pick up and look at while they were at the mercantile. There
		were also two more blankets in preparation of the upcoming cold nights. With a flick of
		her wrist, Josie set Flossy in motion, and the wagon made its way slowly out of town with
		Phoenix tethered behind.</p>
