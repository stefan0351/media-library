<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 37: Whittling Away the Time -->

<p>Josie woke to find one arm and leg draped casually over her and
		Rebecca?s head resting on her shoulder. She didn't want to disturb the comfortably
		sleeping woman, but her bladder was protesting too much. As gently as she could, the
		gunslinger slipped out from under her and got out of bed. The early morning chill raised
		gooseflesh on her skin and the rough and tumble gunslinger really wished they had a
		chamber pot as she reached for her longjohns. After making certain that Rebecca was
		covered with the blankets, she picked up her boots and one gunbelt and quietly left the
		room.</p>

		<p>Josie was already up on the roof pulling away shingles when
		Charles left the house, rifle in hand, and headed through the clump of cottonwoods.
		Rebecca came out a few minutes later with a cup of coffee in her hand. She stood on the
		ground and looked up at the woman in black, already sweating from the heat of the morning
		sun. "Hi," She called up.</p>

		<p>"Hi yourself."</p>

		<p>"Brought you some coffee. Sorry I forgot to set the pot up
		for you last night." She walked over to the ladder and waited for Josie to come down.
		"Thanks for letting me sleep," she said when she handed the mug over to the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"It's all right. Did Charles say where he was going?"</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca replied. "I'm sure he'll be fine,
		though. He was in a good mood when he left."</p>

		<p>Josie downed the rest of the coffee and handed the cup back to
		her. "I need you to take Flossy and go get the rest of our things from the wagon
		before someone happens upon it. Should only take you three or four trips if you load the
		horse up right." Since the wagon was less than a mile from the house, and thus within
		earshot, Josie didn't make her take a gun along. The gunslinger did, however, still insist
		on Rebecca taking one of the bowie knives, just in case.</p>

		<p>It was late afternoon when Rebecca finished getting the rest of
		their things. She had just finished brushing down Flossy and putting her back in her stall
		when a shot rang out from beyond the trees. She ran out of the barn in time to see Josie
		race down the ladder and pull her gun from the holster. "Get inside and don't come
		out I until tell you to," Josie yelled as she ran into the cottonwoods and
		disappeared from sight. Rebecca stood frozen to the spot, unable to move. Several minutes
		later another shot rang out. There was no sign of either Charles or Josie. Rebecca headed
		for the woods, forgetting all about her friend's instructions in her worry. She almost
		reached the trees when the gunslinger appeared.</p>

		<p>"I thought I told you to go inside and wait," she said,
		concerned about the look on the young woman's face. "What's wrong?"</p>

		<p>"I was worried." Rebecca replied. "Where's
		Charles?"</p>

		<p>"He's back with the deer. Fresh meat for dinner tonight.
		Hope you know how to cook venison."</p>

		<p>"That's what those shots were? Heck, Josie, I thought
		someone was attacking you two." The gunslinger caught the tone of worry in the young
		woman's voice and immediately felt bad for scaring her so. Without saying a word, she held
		her arms out slightly and invited Rebecca in for a brief hug.</p>

		<p>"I was trying to keep you safe, not scare you," she
		said to the top of the blonde head.</p>

		<p>"Well, I was," she admitted. "Don't do that to me
		again." She pulled back from the hug and smiled. "So, venison for dinner, huh?
		I'll cook it, but you're gonna have to skin it."</p>

		<p>"Deal," the gunslinger replied. "Just came back to
		get some rope. It's a small buck, but he sure is heavy. Gonna have to drag him."</p>

		<p>"You just make sure that you wash up before coming in to
		eat," Rebecca said, wagging her finger. "And I mean it, with soap and
		everything."</p>

		<p>"Yes mother," the gunslinger said mockingly, receiving
		a playful backhand to the belly.</p>

		<p>"Keep it up and you can go sleep with Phoenix."</p>

		<p>"At least Phoenix doesn't snore," Josie teased back.</p>

		<p>"You're right, she doesn't; but then again, Phoenix doesn't
		give backrubs."</p>

		<p>Josie held up her hands in defeat. "I'll wash, I'll wash.
		I'm not giving up those backrubs for anything." She watched as the broadest grin came
		over the young woman's face and realized with a slight smile that she?d be lucky if
		she ever won an argument with Rebecca again.</p>

		<p>After a filling meal of venison steaks, Josie took the rest of
		the meat to the smokehouse while Rebecca cleaned up after dinner and Charles worked on
		getting a fire going in the fireplace. Once again in possession of her medical text, the
		young woman sat down in the chair, turned the wick up on the lamp, and resumed her
		reading.</p>

		<p>"That's a mighty big book you got there," he commented.
		"What's it for?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, it's about medicine and healing. Josie got it for
		me," she added proudly.</p>

		<p>"Wanna be a doctor, do ya?" he said as he lit a
		cigarette.</p>

		<p>"Oh no, I could never be a doctor, too much schooling. I
		would like to help people though."</p>

		<p>"My Lillian wanted to be a nurse once. Girl's too darn smart
		for schooling, though. Ever seen one like that? Too smart to be taught, that's what she
		was. Ruth tried. She bought her books and even took her to the library at Harvard a lot
		when they were living with my kin in Boston. For almost four years she took her there
		every week. Lillian spent hours there, just reading everything. When I came home, I
		couldn't believe how much she knew. Like a sponge, that one was." His eyes took on a
		lost glaze, remembering a happy time so long ago. Rebecca reached out and squeezed his
		hand, receiving a smile in return. "Well," he sniffed, "I guess that's
		enough talk about things long past." He reached out with his free hand and patted
		hers. "We should do something fun."</p>

		<p>"Like what?" she said, putting her book down gently on
		the floor.</p>

		<p>"Now I know I have some cards around here somewhere,"
		he said as he stood up. He walked into the kitchen and opened and closed several drawers
		before he found what he was looking. "I knew I had some." He returned to the
		parlor holding a worn deck of playing cards in his hand. "What would you like to
		play?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'm afraid I don't know how to play cards," she
		said apologetically. Charles smiled a warm, grandfatherly smile and began to shuffle the
		deck.</p>

		<p>"Well then now is a good time to learn. What would you like
		to learn? Ruth used to play cards all the time. You see that piece of wood over
		there?" he pointed to a thin board two feet by three feet leaning against the wall.
		"She'd put that across her lap right in that chair and play solitaire for hours. I
		couldn't tell you how many decks of cards she went through. Horace used to bring a new
		deck each time he'd visit." He stopped shuffling and waited for her answer. She
		thought about what kind of card game would be good to learn.</p>

		<p>"Can you teach me how to play poker? I know Josie knows how
		to play that game." She thought it might be nice to play a game with her friend.
		"Oh, but I don't have any money to play with."</p>

		<p>Charles chuckled. "Not to worry, we'll use what Horace and I
		use when we play." He got up, went back out into the kitchen, and removed two small
		sacks from the drawer. "It'll be easier to play at the table." He suggested,
		setting the sacks on the table. Rebecca joined him and took the offered bag.</p>

		<p>"Beans?"</p>

		<p>"Yup, Horace and I never play for money." He dealt out
		the cards, smiling when he saw the look of total concentration on the young face. Oh yes,
		this was going to be much more fun than playing with his brother, who insisted on playing
		cutthroat poker. "Do you like wild cards, honey?"</p>

		<p>"What are wild cards?" she asked innocently.</p>

		<p>"Wonderful," he said with a smile.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Once all the meat was cut up and hung around the inside of the
		smokehouse, Josie went to the barn to get some kindling. She picked up the ax and ran her
		thumb along the end, checking it for sharpness. Not at all pleased with it, she went over
		the workbench to get the whetstone. Sitting next to the stone was a knife with a short
		blade and a long handle, perfect for whittling. Setting the ax down, Josie walked back
		over to the woodpile and picked up a piece of split wood. She sat down on a stool and
		turned the wood over in her hands, studying the grain and inspecting it for knots. She
		treated six more pieces to the same scrutiny before selecting one and setting it on the
		workbench next to the knife. She pulled the handmade wheelbarrow over to the pile of wood
		and loaded it for the smokehouse.</p>

		<p>"So when is Horace coming?" Rebecca asked laying two
		cards face down on the table. Charles handed her two new ones before taking three for
		himself.</p>

		<p>"Hmm, should be in about ten days or so. He'll stay
		overnight, then move on. I'll see him about a week after that on his return trip." He
		pushed two dry beans into the pile on the center of the table.</p>

		<p>"Do you think Josie will be done with the roof by
		then?" She met his two beans and raised him two.</p>

		<p>"I don't think so, Rebecca. There's a lot of work to be done
		up there. I know she's a strong woman, but even a strapping young man wouldn't be able to
		get it done in ten days." He matched her two beans. "What'cha got?"</p>

		<p>"Three nines. Well, I guess that means we'll be here for my
		birthday. Its in eleven days," she said, setting her cards down to show him.</p>

		<p>"Your birthday? How old will you be? Three tens." He
		took the pot, leaving one bean behind for the ante.</p>

		<p>"Twenty," she answered while he dealt another hand.</p>

		<p>"Well then, we'll have to have a little celebration for
		you," he said as he discarded one card.</p>

		<p>"Oh please don't think about it. All it means is that I'm
		another year older. It's no great shakes. Three cards please."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>After making sure the fire was going nicely, Josie left the
		smokehouse and returned to the barn. She picked up the piece of wood and the whittling
		knife and headed for the porch swing. The late evening sun cast its orange light upon the
		sky while the dark headed woman put the blade to the wood. Thin curly slivers began to
		multiply on the porch floor. Josie continued to shave off pieces of the wood, not giving
		any thought as to what she was making. The foot long quartered log found its edges rounded
		under her blade. Far away a coyote cried out to the approaching moon. She tucked one leg
		up underneath her and used her other foot to set the swing into a gentle rocking motion.
		By the time darkness made it impossible for her to go on, the entire floor and seat around
		her was covered with the slivers of wood. She stood up, set the wood and knife on the
		swing, and brushed the slivers off her britches before going in.</p>

		<p>She found Rebecca and Charles seated at the table, the younger
		with a huge pile of beans in front of her and cards in her hand. "Charles, what are
		you teaching her?"</p>

		<p>"Full house, right?" Rebecca said as she laid her hand
		down and smiled.</p>

		<p>"That's exactly what it is, child. You win again," he
		said, passing the deck to her. Josie walked over and looked at the cards on the table.</p>

		<p>"She doesn't have a full house, she's got two fives, two
		sixes, and a two."</p>

		<p>"Twos are wild," Rebecca said, pulling the cards
		together and shuffling. She did it slowly, worried about sending them all over the table
		and floor again like she did when she first tried to follow the kindly old man's
		instructions.</p>

		<p>"Wild cards are for old ladies and children," the
		gunslinger muttered under her breath.</p>

		<p>"You wanna play, Josie?" she said, looking expectantly
		at the older woman. "You can have some of my beans." Her eyes took on the
		expression of a puppy dog and her lips formed a slight pout. The bounty hunter pulled the
		chair from the parlor to the end of the table, tucking her feet under herself to make up
		some of the difference in height from the chair to the table. Rebecca pushed a pile of
		beans over to her and started to pass out the cards.</p>

		<p>"Threes are wild."</p>

		<p>"Wonderful," Josie said, trying hard not to groan at
		how silly it was to play like that. She picked her cards up one at a time. Three, ten,
		three, nine, queen. A straight with no effort. She counted out ten beans and pushed them
		forward only to be stopped by a smaller hand.</p>

		<p>"The most you can bet is three beans."</p>

		<p>"You're kidding."</p>

		<p>"Nope. Three's the limit. Want any cards?"</p>

		<p>"No. I'm fine," she said sourly as she slouched back in
		her seat. Charles took two and Rebecca took three, her face lighting up as she put the new
		cards into her hand.</p>

		<p>"Nice poker face," the gunslinger drawled. "If you
		have a good hand, try not to show any expression. Otherwise everyone will fold and you
		won't win any money."</p>

		<p>"Oh, okay," she said, trying to make her face as
		expressionless as possible. Charles folded. "Your bet, Josie."</p>

		<p>"Two." She pushed two beans into the pot and the
		younger woman matched it. "Straight to the king," she said with a smirk. Rebecca
		broke into a broad grin.</p>

		<p>"Flush." She laid down a hand full of hearts.</p>

		<p>"Beginner's luck," Josie growled. "Deal."</p>

		<p>"That's one thing she has," Charles said with a wry
		smile. "At the rate she's going, I'll be broke within an hour," he said waving
		his hand toward his dwindling supply of dry beans.</p>

		<p>"Don't worry Charles, I'll be happy to loan you some, just
		like</p>

		<p>Josie."</p>

		<p>"Loan me? You mean I owe you these beans?"</p>

		<p>"Of course," Rebecca said with a mischievous smile.
		"So you'd better hurry up and win a hand so you can start paying me back."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I'll pay you back all right," Josie playfully
		threatened as she picked up the new hand of cards. Charles chuckled and tossed his bean in
		the pot.</p>

		<p>The winnings passed back and forth amongst the three of them for
		hours. Rebecca won more than the others, but continued to feed her pile of beans across
		and down the table to keep the others in the game, not wanting it to end. When Josie saw
		her fighting to stay awake, the gunslinger tossed her cards down on the table. "I
		think it's time for the sandman." She rose to her feet and put the chair back where
		it belonged. Rebecca collected all the cards into one neat pile and left them on the table
		along with the beans.</p>

		<p>"Yeah...I am pretty tired," she said. "Goodnight
		Charles."</p>

		<p>"Goodnight Rebecca."</p>

		<p>Within minutes they were under the covers, the gunslinger in her
		longjohns and Rebecca in her nightgown. "Thanks for playing tonight," the young
		woman said softly.</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it. Just don't go getting any ideas in
		your head about walking into a saloon and sitting down at a table," Josie warned
		gently. "They don't play with wild cards."</p>

		<p>"Oh I won't, I promise. I'll leave that kind of stuff up to
		you," she said as she snuggled deeper into the older woman's embrace. Both well fed
		and comfortable, it was only a matter of moments before they were both sound asleep.</p>
