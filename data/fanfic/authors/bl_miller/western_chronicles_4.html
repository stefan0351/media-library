<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 4: Snakes -->

<p>Rebecca tried to follow the tracks of the outlaw, but the half
		moon wasn't cooperative. Several times she strayed off course, ending up almost a mile off
		by the time daylight started to help her. Fear of her father put life into her steps as
		she finally picked up the trail and started to follow it.</p>

		<p>Her peasant dress was stuck to her skin by the time evening
		mercifully set in. Rebecca's stomach was growling and her throat was parched. Her legs
		felt like iron weights as she trudged along, no longer sure if the hoof prints belonged to
		the gold colored horse or not. A vulture flew overhead, screeching his arrival. The tired
		woman quickened her pace to somewhere between a crawl and a walk. The burning orange of
		the setting sun was in her eyes, blinding her to the danger so close by. Only the telltale
		rattle gave her any warning.</p>

		<p>Rebecca came to a total stop, her eyes wide in terror. It wasn't
		just one rattlesnake; she had inadvertently stepped into a nest of the deadly creatures.
		One on the left side started to move in no particular direction, merely uncoiling and
		recoiling. Her heart was pounding in her chest so hard she was certain it was going to
		break through her ribs. She willed her legs to move, but they were frozen in place by her
		fear. The rattler slithered along the ground, its forked tongue slipping in and out of its
		mouth. Out of the corner of her eye, Rebecca saw several other snakes also starting to
		uncoil. A bloodcurdling scream pierced the evening air as her legs found life and started
		to run back away from the venomous snakes. Relocating the trail, Rebecca ran as fast as
		she could, her lungs burning with the effort. In the far distance, she swore she heard the
		sound of a horse running hard, or was it just the blood pounding in her ears? Stumbling
		over a large stone, she fell face first onto the dusty ground. With the twilight, the
		large horse almost didn't see her lying there. Only at the last second did Phoenix rear
		her head and move to the right to avoid trampling the girl. "Whoa."</p>

		<p>Josie looked around for signs of other people. Seeing none, she
		dismounted and looked at the grime covered face with the green eyes. She almost laughed at
		the sight. In her sternest voice she asked, "Are you the one who let out that horrid
		scream?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. There were these snakes, lots of them, and..."</p>

		<p>"You screamed like that for a few snakes?" Josie asked
		incredulously. "I heard you from miles away."</p>

		<p>"I was scared. There were so many of them." Rebecca
		slowly rose to her feet, her whole body protesting the use of the muscles.</p>

		<p>"You shouldn't be out here." Josie took another look at
		the girl. "I left you in that town."</p>

		<p>"I couldn't stay there anymore." Without a word, Josie
		vaulted effortlessly onto Phoenix.</p>

		<p>"Don't follow me, girl!" The outlaw warned before
		urging the horse into a gallop back to her campsite. Josie mentally cursed herself. Dinner
		was certain to be ruined now. She had left it on the spit when she heard the scream
		echoing through the canyon. The hungry outlaw swore that if she ever saw that annoying
		little brat again, she would shoot her.</p>
