<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 44: Judgement Day -->

<p>As Rebecca walked down the center aisle of the schoolhouse she
		could feel every eye in the place follow her steps. She kept her eyes on the floor,
		uncertain what reception she would get from the local populace.</p>

		<p>"That?s her friend," a voice whispered from a seat
		as she passed. "Come to town with the outlaw, she did."</p>

		<p>"More than friends is what I heard," a male voice
		hissed.</p>

		<p>"What of it?" A woman spoke loudly, and something
		familiar in the voice made Rebecca turn toward her. Victoria, Stacey and Elaine sat
		together, and it was Victoria?s voice that Rebecca had recognized.</p>

		<p>"Victoria! Oh, God it?s good to see you!" The
		women were on their feet, each one hugging Rebecca in turn.</p>

		<p>"Couldn?t let you face this alone, could we?"
		Victoria said with a grin. "You?d best go sit down. Almost time to start this
		circus. We?ll talk later."</p>

		<p>As she finished the short walk down the aisle she scanned the
		crowd wondering if any of the other people she had sent telegrams to had shown up. She
		caught the eye of Martha Jane who winked and gave her a thumbs up. A few seats away the
		mayor of Mason?s Gulch sat talking with Belle Shirley. And in the front row, Horace
		and Charles sat on either side of Genie. When she reached them, the trio moved apart to
		make room for the little blonde. She gave Horace and Charles each a quick hug and then sat
		down. She opened her mouth to speak to her friends but before she could utter a word the
		room erupted in whispers once again as the outlaw was ushered in.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie ignored the stares and whispers and walked proudly across
		the room with her head high. The shackles on her wrists did nothing to diminish her almost
		regal bearing. Rebecca?s heart swelled with love and pride as she watched her
		beautiful lover pass her by and take a seat at a small table in front of the teachers desk
		that would serve as the judges bench. John sat on one side of her and a short man in a
		suit and tie sat on the other side. He leaned over and whispered something to Josie, and
		she nodded. This must be the lawyer Belle said she would contact. She swore that if anyone
		could get Josie out of this mess, it would be Ira Greenspan. Josie twisted slightly in her
		seat until she was able to see Rebecca, and she gave her a reassuring smile. Rebecca
		mouthed the words "I love you," and Josie nodded to show she understood.</p>

		<p>"All rise! This session of the Circuit Court of the
		Territory of Oklahoma is now in session. The honorable Judge Lucas Fellowes
		presiding." Chairs scraped the floor as the people got to their feet, and the Judge
		made his way to the front of the room with his clerk trailing behind. The Judge was a tall
		imposing man with a thick head of steel gray hair. He took his place behind the desk and
		sat, and the clerk turned toward the assemblage and said, "Be seated." While
		waiting for the hubbub to die down, Josie studied the clerk and noticed that his
		mannerisms were effeminate, as was the sound of his voice. She would be surprised if he
		was not a kindred spirit, and she smiled at him. His face registered shock to have a
		defendant act friendly toward him, but he recovered his composure and handed a stack of
		papers to the Judge.</p>

		<p>"The first matter before this court is the extradition to
		the United States of Josephine Hunter, known as the outlaw Josie Hunter," the clerk
		intoned. "Will the defendant please rise?" Josie and her lawyer stood up. The
		Judge glared openly at the outlaw making no effort to disguise his dislike of her.</p>

		<p>"Sit down," the Judge growled. "This isn?t a
		trial and there is no reason for the defendant to enter a plea." Resuming their
		seats, Josie continued to maintain eye contact with the Judge who was finally forced to
		look away. "I will listen to qualified petitioners with reasonable arguments as to
		why this person should not be returned to the States to stand trial for her crimes there,
		and at the conclusion of these proceedings I will make my ruling. Because this is not a
		trial, there is no prosecuting attorney. I will ask questions on behalf of the people. Is
		that clear?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, your Honor," Mr. Greenspan replied.</p>

		<p>"Very well. You may proceed with your argument, Mr.
		Greenspan. But I caution you; I have no tolerance for theatrics in my courtroom. If your
		client or any of your witnesses try to turn this into a sideshow I promise it will not
		help your case any. Do you get my point?"</p>

		<p>"Yes I do, your Honor. There will be no theatrics."</p>

		<p>"All right. Get on with it."</p>

		<p>"Thank you. May I stand, your Honor?" The Judge simply
		nodded, and Mr. Greenspan rose and turned toward the townsfolk and visitors. "Ladies
		and gentlemen, I?m sure there is not a one of you who hasn?t heard
		of?"</p>

		<p>"There is no jury here, Mr. Greenspan. You will address your
		comments to me and me alone."</p>

		<p>"I?m sorry, your Honor." Ira looked down at his
		notes on the table before him, cleared his throat and looked up at the Judge. "Your
		Honor, my client is not wanted for any crimes whatsoever in the Oklahoma Territory.
		Furthermore, she has selflessly assisted many people present in this room today ?
		placed her own life at grave risk ? in order to preserve the life and liberty of
		those and other people. The money that she obtained as a result of her career as a train
		robber was all given to the people displaced by the railroads. She kept none of it for
		herself. She is not a ruthless cold-hearted killer as the dime novels portray her, but a
		friend to the less fortunate and defender of the weak. Her actions over the past months
		show that she is trying to atone for the wrongs she has done, and she should be allowed to
		continue on the road to salvage her soul."</p>

		<p>He paused and the Judge inserted into the silence, "That
		didn?t make Robin Hood an upstanding citizen any more than it does your client, Mr.
		Greenspan. I doubt she could redeem her soul if she were allowed to live for a hundred
		years. If you have no more compelling arguments than that, this hearing is a waste of my
		time and the taxpayer?s money. I suggest you produce your witnesses so we can bring
		this farce to a close."</p>

		<p>The lawyer had expected the Judge to be unsympathetic to his
		client based on his discussion with the sheriff, but he had not anticipated this complete
		unwillingness to be fair-minded. He had hoped that the stories of his witnesses might be
		able to produce a spark of humanity in the Judge, but it seemed his human kindness was
		reserved for the fair of skin. "I call Martha Jane Canary."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"?managed to bring in enough medicine to save most of
		the people who would surely have died without it. She worked day and night to save them
		too, with nary a thought to herself. Deadwood would have been a ghost town if it
		warn?t for Josie Hunter." She smiled at Josie as she finished her testimony, and
		the outlaw mouthed ?thank you? in return.</p>

		<p>"And where did she get the medicine?" The Judge asked.</p>

		<p>"Why, she got it from a snake oil peddler or some such.
		I?m not rightly sure."</p>

		<p>"And was the snake oil peddler outside the quarantine area
		when she got the medicine from him?"</p>

		<p>"I believe he was, but?"</p>

		<p>"So she disregarded the quarantine and put an innocent
		person at risk for smallpox. Thank you, Miss Canary. That will be all. Next witness."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Well, actually it was the other one?uh, Miss Cameron
		over there, who volunteered Miss Hunter?s services," Mayor McGregor from
		Mason?s Gulch explained. "We didn?t see Josie?that is, Miss Hunter,
		until after I agreed to give her immunity in return for her help in stopping the Caram
		gang from looting our town."</p>

		<p>"If not for your promise of immunity she would have ridden
		on by and left your town for the vultures, is that it?" The Judge asked with a sneer.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I don?t think so. Miss Cameron was quite sure she
		could get Miss Hunter to help even without the immunity."</p>

		<p>"I?m sure Miss Cameron can be very persuasive,"
		the Judge said with a hint of sarcasm. "You can step down, Mr. McGregor. I think I
		know what was behind Miss Hunter?s heroic behavior in Mason?s Gulch."</p>

		<p>"But your Honor, I?"</p>

		<p>"Step down, sir. I?ll find you in contempt if I have to
		ask you again."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>One after another the witnesses came forward to tell of the
		selfless acts and heroic deeds Josie had done, and one after another the Judge found
		reason to belittle the witnesses and downplay the good things she had done. The Judge
		refused to allow Rebecca to testify on the grounds that she was not an impartial witness.
		The lawyer had no choice but to pull his ace from the hole. "I call Mrs. William
		Howe, wife of the Governor of the Territory of Oklahoma." The Judge?s eyebrows
		pulled together in a frown as he watched the finely dressed woman make her way to the
		witness? chair. He had never met the Governor or his wife, and he would not have
		recognized her. The daguerreotypes in the paper did not do her justice. He was not pleased
		to know she was prepared to speak on behalf of the half-breed. It was one thing to know
		the Governor wanted to hear the case to rule on a request for asylum. It was another thing
		entirely to have his wife speak up for the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"I fail to see how Mrs. Howe can provide a character
		reference for Miss Hunter since she has not personally witnessed any of the so-called
		heroic acts this parade of witnesses have described."</p>

		<p>"On the contrary, your Honor. Mrs. Howe has known the
		defendant since she was a youth. And she has a very moving tale to tell of how Miss Hunter
		tried to help her catch some rustlers."</p>

		<p>"And I?m certain it?s a real tear-jerker, Mr.
		Greenspan. Unfortunately, it has no bearing on this case since it happened before Miss
		Hunter decided to switch sides of the law. Take your seat, Mrs. Howe."</p>

		<p>"With all due respect, your Honor, the events Mrs. Howe
		wishes to relate to this court were a turning point in the life of this young woman. She
		was falsely accused of rustling and was hanged for it?"</p>

		<p>"Are you hard of hearing Mr. Greenspan? Mrs. Howe?s
		testimony is irrelevant. Don?t try my patience any further or I will find you in
		contempt." The icy glint in the Judge?s eye made it clear that he would do
		exactly that.</p>

		<p>Ira was stumped. He shuffled through his notes again, and studied
		the people in the room to see if there was any tactic or witness he had over looked that
		might help to delay what was now clearly inevitable. As his eyes passed over Josie he
		noticed that though she appeared to be calm and stoic, the muscles of her jaw clenched and
		unclenched in silent rage as she stared at the Judge whose prejudice threatened to end her
		life. His only hope was that she still had an ace up her sleeve he could use. "Your
		honor, I request a recess to confer with my client."</p>

		<p>The Judge pulled his watch from his pocket and glanced at it
		before answering the lawyer?s request. It was nearly noon, and since it did not seem
		likely that they would be able to finish before lunch, he decided to grant the request. He
		rapped his gavel on the desk before him and said, "This court will stand in recess
		until two o?clock. Sheriff, remove the prisoner to her cell until then."</p>

		<p>"All rise," the clerk lisped. As the spectators
		shuffled to their feet and began to leave, the sheriff removed the handcuffs from his belt
		and showed them to Josie with an apologetic look on his face. Wordlessly she held out her
		hands and he snapped them in place. With the lawyer on one side and the sheriff on the
		other Josie was escorted to the jail, a procession of concerned friends with Rebecca in
		the lead following in their wake.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Despite the seriousness of the circumstances, the mood in the
		jailhouse was almost festive. John removed the handcuffs as soon as they were inside the
		building, and he did not bother to put Josie in a cell. The friends who had come to
		support her were clustered around her, hugging her and slapping her on the back. Jane and
		Belle exchanged a glance as they watched their usually untouchable friend not only allow
		herself to be touched, but actually seem to enjoy it. Belle shrugged and Jane smiled as
		they both got in line to collect their share of hugs from the enigmatic outlaw.</p>

		<p>Josie had no idea she had so many friends until they were all
		assembled in one room. She glanced down at the little blonde who never left her side, and
		realized that if it were not for her most of the people would not be there. Rebecca had
		peeled away the layers of armor that had shielded Josie from harm, but had kept love away
		in the bargain.</p>

		<p>"Thank you. All of you?for coming here to help
		me," Josie said. The quiver in her voice betrayed her emotions as she continued,
		"If I don?t get out of this mess it won?t be because you didn?t try.
		And I love you for it." Her arm was around Rebecca?s waist and she gave her a
		squeeze to show that she loved her more than all the rest. The gesture was not lost on
		Genie, who felt a stab of jealousy to see such closeness between the two women. If not for
		her father, she knew that it could have been she who earned such adoring looks from the
		tall gunslinger. She was not unhappy with her life, and in fact loved her husband dearly,
		but she could not help but wonder how her life might have been if not for that fateful
		night in the barn. She sighed and then smiled as Josie?s gaze caught her eye. Josie
		held out her hand to Genie, and she placed her own hand in it. Josie gently pulled Genie
		until she was against her other side, and put that arm around her waist. Flanked by the
		two diminutive women, Josie looked like a book between two bookends.</p>

		<p>"I hate to take you away from your friends, but I think we
		need to discuss our strategy," Ira said. "I suggest you folks go get some lunch
		before court resumes this afternoon, and give us a chance to talk." One by one the
		people filed to the door after giving Josie words of encouragement. When Genie and Rebecca
		made a move to separate themselves from Josie, the outlaw pulled them back to her sides.</p>

		<p>"These women are my family. They stay with me."</p>

		<p>"Suit yourself," the lawyer said with a shrug. He
		motioned for the women to take a seat on the bench that flanked the sheriff?s desk,
		and he sat in a chair facing them. "I don?t have to tell you this is not looking
		good," he said solemnly. Josie raised one eyebrow and regarded him silently. He
		swallowed hard at the cold glint in the gunslinger?s eyes and averted his gaze, then
		went on, "Truthfully, I did not expect him to completely ignore the telegram from the
		governor. The man is committing political suicide, and doesn?t even seem to care. He
		must have a huge axe to grind with you, Miss Hunter."</p>

		<p>"Not with me in particular. I just seem to be the only
		Indian handy for him to take out his revenge on. A man with such hate in his heart for an
		entire people should not be allowed to hold a position that wields authority over those
		people." Her voice was tinged with bitterness as she turned to Genie and continued,
		"I hope you make sure your husband disbars that bastard, no matter how this turns
		out."</p>

		<p>"Count on it. But we can?t give up hope. I already
		wired William and told him he had to be here by tomorrow. I haven?t heard back from
		him yet, but I know he will be here on the afternoon train. We just have to keep the Judge
		from taking you out on the morning train."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie shifted nervously in her seat in the schoolhouse as the
		lawyer checked his watch for the 3<sup>rd</sup> time since they had been seated. She
		raised her eyebrows and he mouthed the words "two-thirty." Knowing the
		Judge?s eagerness to have this hearing at an end and Josie on her way to the gallows,
		the outlaw could not help but feel that his lateness did not bode well for her life
		expectancy. A murmur from the back of the room announced the arrival of someone, and Josie
		turned in her seat to see the Judge making his way down the center aisle, followed by his
		clerk?and Caleb Cameron. As the trio made their way past her she could have sworn she
		was in a brewery, so strong was the smell emanating from their pores. Josie glared openly
		at the man who had pretended to be Rebecca?s father, and made a tiny motion across
		her neck with her hand that only he could see, and which left no doubt in the man?s
		mind that he would be dead if he allowed himself to be caught once again by the outlaw. He
		gave her a wide berth and sat down in a chair on the far side of the room toward the
		front.</p>

		<p>"All rise," the clerk announced. "This court is
		now in session, his Honor?"</p>

		<p>"Never mind. They know all that," the Judge growled.
		His speech was somewhat slurred, and his eyes were red rimmed. The clerk opened his mouth
		to say something then thought better of it and sat down. The rest of the people took that
		as their cue and resumed their seats. The Judge continued with a baleful glare at the
		defense table, "Do you have anything more to say before I render my decision?"</p>

		<p>"I do, your Honor."</p>

		<p>"Be quick about it then."</p>

		<p>"Your Honor, I wish to say for the record that this hearing
		is premature in view of the injunction from the Governor to delay until his arrival. Even
		if you will not allow Mrs. Howe to testify in regard to Miss Hunter?s past, I request
		that she be allowed to testify to the validity of the telegram from her husband. And I
		further?"</p>

		<p>"Enough! Madam, were you with your husband at the moment
		that he supposedly sent the telegram to which defense counsel refers?"</p>

		<p>Genie was caught off guard, and her reply was a stammered,
		"No, I was not actually with him?"</p>

		<p>"Then you cannot swear with absolute certainty that he did
		in fact send a telegram. It could just as easily have been sent by Miss Cameron,
		isn?t that true?"</p>

		<p>"Your Honor, he told me he sent the telegram. We discussed
		it at length before he did, and I knew exactly what he was going to say."
		Genie?s cheeks flushed with anger at the effrontery of this pompous ass. She opened
		her mouth to tell him just what she thought of him when he cut her off.</p>

		<p>"Hearsay; inadmissible. Mr. Greenspan, unless you have some
		new evidence to present, this court would very much like to begin the conclusion of this
		hearing."</p>

		<p>"Your Honor I protest this mockery of a hearing, and believe
		that you should disqualify yourself from this case owing to your prejudice toward Indians.
		If Miss Hunter were not a half-breed we would not be sitting here today." The look
		the Judge bestowed on Ira left little doubt that he held Jews in much the same esteem as
		he did Indians.</p>

		<p>"Your protest is noted." The Judge leaned on his desk
		and glared first at Josie then at Ira. Josie did not flinch, but the lawyer shrunk down in
		his seat under the unrelenting hatred coming from the man. With a feral grin, the Judge
		continued, "And now it?s my turn. I think these good people should hear what
		Josie Hunter is really like, from Caleb Cameron, the man who was her most recent
		victim." He turned to Caleb who had alternated between the desire to flee from the
		room, lest Josie somehow managed to get free, and his wish to see the look on Josie?s
		face when the Judge told her she had a one way ticket to hell. Since it seemed the Judge
		had things well in hand and Josie did not appear to be going anywhere, he had stayed. He
		looked at the outlaw with utter contempt as the Judge motioned him forward.</p>

		<p>"Mr. Cameron, will you tell the people how you came to be
		acquainted with Josie Hunter?"</p>

		<p>Caleb cleared his throat several times before he could speak
		loudly enough to be heard past the first few rows of people. "Uh, she ambushed some
		poor cowpokes that was trying to court my daughter, and shot ?em dead. Then she
		kidnapped my daughter and drug her to hell and gone all over the country. And when I tried
		to get my little girl back to take her home to her Ma, that Injun beat me to within an
		inch of my life."</p>

		<p>He made sure to turn his head to both sides of the room so that
		everyone could clearly see the black eye and the cut on his cheek, both courtesy of the
		outlaw. Josie was certain that the little weasel had not seen her, but she could not be
		sure he had not heard her voice before falling into unconsciousness. Josie shot a glance
		at John to try to convey to him that she would not allow him to be implicated for her
		release if the Judge delved into that. The look he gave her in return showed that he was
		not as confident as she appeared to be. But then he shrugged; he had known when he let her
		out of the cell that this could happen, and had been willing to take the risk. Both of
		them turned their attention to the front of the room once more, where Caleb had finished
		showing off his wounds to the audience and had continued to speak.</p>

		<p>"But the worst of it is that this?this?sick and
		twisted pervert has taken my innocent little girl and turned her into an abomination in
		the eyes of the lord, just like herself." Josie grit her teeth to avoid saying
		something that would not serve any purpose but to worsen her case. She thought if she had
		to listen to that sanctimonious hypocrite use the phrase "abomination in the eyes of
		the lord" one more time, she would rip his tongue from his mouth and shove it up the
		flap of his longjohns. Caleb?s eyes skirted over Josie?s as he spouted his well
		practiced venomous diatribe, and quickly moved away as the look in her eyes made his heart
		clunk in his chest like the last hard apple in the bottom of the barrel. His voice was not
		quite so strong as he continued, "Won?t be no decent, God fearing man want to
		have nothin? to do with the likes of Rebecca now that she?s been tainted by that
		outlaw. She should pay for what she done to my family. And I aim to see that I get the
		reward that is due me for havin? to take care of this worthless girl for the rest of
		her unnatural life."</p>

		<p>The Judge scowled at Caleb for the embellishments he had added to
		the rehearsed script they had discussed in the saloon while sharing a drink?or four.
		Nevertheless, he felt that the exposure of the outlaw for her crimes against nature itself
		should help to sway public opinion away from her and prevent the Indian-lovers in the
		community from doing anything to prevent him from carrying out his plan. He could tell
		that morning as he looked over the crowd that the prevailing opinion was that she had
		redeemed herself and should not be forced to go back and stand trial for her crimes. He
		hoped they were not so quick to overlook her unnatural behavior as they were her crimes.
		To get Caleb back on track, he asked, "And when did Miss Hunter inflict these
		injuries on you, Mr. Cameron?"</p>

		<p>"Why, today. This mornin?..."</p>

		<p>Ira shot to his feet and spoke without waiting to be recognized
		by the Judge. "That?s absurd, your Honor. Miss Hunter has been behind bars for
		five days. She could not possibly have done what this man claims she did." In truth,
		he believed Josie capable of nearly anything, including getting in and out of jail without
		anyone knowing it, but he kept that opinion to himself.</p>

		<p>Before the Judge could reprimand Ira for his outburst, Rebecca
		had also leapt to her feet. Turning toward the crowd instead of the Judge she said
		quickly, "It wasn?t Josie that hit him; it was a man from town, a stranger to
		me. The man heard me screaming for help when he," she pointed at Caleb accusingly and
		then continued, "was trying to rape me?" The lie came effortlessly to
		Rebecca's lips, even though lying was as foreign to her as breathing water would be. She
		knew then what Josie meant when she said the Judge would assume Rebecca would lie to
		protect her. But the man whom she had called Pa for all her life knew Rebecca for an
		honest person, and the look on his face clearly showed that he had not seen Josie, but had
		merely assumed that it had been she who had come to Rebecca's rescue. That look was not
		lost on the Judge either, as he watched the credibility of his only witness crumble into
		the chalk dust on the floor.</p>

		<p>"You?re out of order!" The Judge bellowed, but
		Rebecca went on.</p>

		<p>"I left with Josie because she was kind to me. She protected
		me. That man never had a kind word for me, and beat me for every imagined
		wrong?"</p>

		<p>"I?ll cite you for contempt if you don?t sit down
		and be quiet, Miss Cameron."</p>

		<p>"These people deserve to know the truth! You can cite me,
		but you can?t make me stop talking!" Once again she turned her face to the
		people who stared at her, hanging on her every word. "Don?t let their hatred and
		bigotry cause the death of?my best friend." She gestured with her hand to
		include both Caleb and the Judge, who at that point seemed to be the only people present
		in favor of extraditing the outlaw. Even the court clerk had tears pooling in the bottom
		of his eyes as he listened to Rebecca?s impassioned plea.</p>

		<p>All of Josie?s friends present began rising to their feet,
		and one of them started to chant "Free Josie." Within moments, the voices had
		swelled to include the townspeople as well, and the Judge banged his gavel repeatedly on
		the desk but was unable to get the crowd to quiet down. Caleb scuttled around behind the
		Judge as if seeking his protection. The Judge was beginning to wish that he had someone to
		hide behind, but then he realized that the people were only chanting. They were doing
		nothing to show that they intended to do violence. The Judge reached into his boot and
		took out a derringer that he kept hidden there for emergencies, and he fired the gun into
		the ceiling, causing a shower of wood splinters to rain down on the spectators. It had the
		desired effect, as the chanting lost volume and then stopped altogether, and the Judge
		bellowed into the near silence.</p>

		<p>"I?ll clear this room if you don?t all shut up and
		take your seats NOW!" His face was so red with anger that it looked as if he might
		have a stroke at any moment. "You," he aimed his gavel at Rebecca as if it were
		a gun, "are in contempt of court. I sentence you to a night in jail. And you,"
		his gaze swiveled to Josie who met his eyes unflinchingly, "are to be transported by
		train to Missouri tomorrow where you will stand trial for your crimes against the United
		States. Sheriff, take both of these women into custody. Have Josie Hunter ready to travel
		at ten o?clock tomorrow morning, at which time you will hand her over to Caleb
		Cameron who I am deputizing to transport the prisoner. This court is adjourned!" He
		rapped his gavel sharply and got to his feet.</p>

		<p>John had no choice but to do as the Judge ordered. He slipped one
		of the bracelets of the handcuffs on each woman, and motioned for them to precede him from
		the room. Once again a procession of people followed the women from the schoolhouse to the
		jail, only now it was a much larger crowd.</p>

		<p>As the last of the spectators trickled out the Judge sent the
		clerk ahead, and grabbed Caleb by the sleeve when he started to leave as well. The farmer
		would just as soon take their conversation to the saloon, but the Judge did not look to be
		in a very convivial mood. Caleb wasn't sure just what he had done to make the Judge so
		angry but it wasn't long before he found out.</p>

		<p>"Why in hell did you tell me that damned Indian was the one
		that knocked you around, you worthless sot? Now this entire herd of yokels thinks you're a
		liar and I'm an idiot. Not to mention they're ready to nominate that bitch for
		sainthood."</p>

		<p>"I-I thought it was her," Caleb whined. "Who else
		would come flying through a window like the hounds of hell were after them?"</p>

		<p>"Who? How about any good Samaritan that heard your daughter
		screaming for help." Caleb lowered his eyes and scuffed his toe in the drifts of
		chalk dust on the floor. He was not used to being the one on the receiving end of a tongue
		lashing, and he did not much like it. Not for the first time he began to wonder whether
		the reward for the outlaw was worth the abuse he had been forced to take. And the
		gunslinger was still a far cry from the states.</p>

		<p>"Why did you say I would take her back to the states?",
		he asked in an effort to shift the conversation off of the fiasco with Rebecca. "That
		woman scares me...she'd kill me as soon as look at me."</p>

		<p>"She'd probably have to stand in a rather long line for that
		privilege," the Judge said under his breath.</p>

		<p>"What did you say?"</p>

		<p>"Just don't worry about it. She'll be handcuffed, and you'll
		have the gun. You shouldn't have any problems taking care of a woman who can't fight
		back...what with all your experience." The sneer in his voice told Caleb that while
		he had no use for Indians and Jews, he nevertheless took a dim view of men who were
		heavy-handed with women. "And you can hand her over to the Federal Marshals in Kansas
		City, so you'll only have her for less than a day on the train."</p>

		<p>"Well I don't like it. Why can't the Sheriff take her?"</p>

		<p>"You really are a dunce. The two of them are thick as
		thieves! The Sheriff is a half-breed also; we may as well set her free as put her in his
		custody for the trip. He knows better than to let her go while I'm here, but there would
		be nothing to stop him once he got her on the train. No, if you want that reward, you're
		going to have to earn it."</p>
