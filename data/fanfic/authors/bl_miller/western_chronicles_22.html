<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 22: Bad Day -->

<p>The morning sun shone down brightly on the small camp. Josie had
		already packed their belongings back into the wagon and had breakfast done at which time
		she felt she had waited long enough for Rebecca to wake up on her own. The gunslinger felt
		a bit guilty for having woken her up with the nightmare last night. She had hoped that the
		smell of coffee and sizzling meat would have done it, but the young woman continued to
		snore softly, her head buried under her blanket in an unconscious attempt to keep the sun
		out. Josie reached over with the butt of her shotgun and gently poked at the sleeping
		form. "Rebecca... Rebecca, get up."</p>

		<p>A low groan came from under the blanket. Josie poked again, this
		time getting the result she wanted. Rebecca slowly pulled the blanket off her face and
		squinted at the brightness. She groggily took the tin cup from the bounty hunter and took
		a sip, immediately grimacing. She looked over at Josie quickly, afraid that she would be
		angered, but the gunslinger arched an eyebrow and her face took on a crooked grin.
		"Coffin varnish?"</p>

		<p>"Ugh, coffin varnish is right," Rebecca replied as she
		drank some more down. "Try using a little less coffee," she said with a friendly
		smile. "This stuff will put hair on your chest." She swallowed the last of the
		drink in her mug and rose to her feet. "I have to make a trip; I'll be right
		back."</p>

		<p>"Try not to run into another nest of snakes," Josie
		warned half-jokingly. Rebecca smiled, but heeded the warning and looked around carefully
		before choosing her spot. The last thing she wanted to do was to squat near a rattler.
		</p>

		<p>Rebecca returned to the camp and rummaged around in the saddlebag
		until she found the rags she was looking for. Although Josie said nothing, the young woman
		blushed furiously as she headed back to the privacy of the bush. She didn't see the
		gunslinger's small smile of understanding. Of all the things she hated, the monthly menace
		was the worst. Rebecca knew it would only be a matter of hours before she started getting
		the painful cramps that accompanied it. Already she felt the start of a dull ache behind
		her eyes that signaled the beginning of a throbbing headache.</p>

		<p>They were on the road less than three hours when the cramps
		started. As nonchalantly as possible, Rebecca folded her arms against her abdomen and
		pressed down, trying to ease the discomfort. Josie noticed out of the corner of her eye,
		but said nothing. The constant jostling from the ride did nothing to help and several
		times she clenched her eyes tight against the pain. "Want some laudanum?" Josie
		asked without taking her eyes off the road. Rebecca opened her eyes and looked at the
		gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"I don't know," she replied. In a smaller voice she
		added, "I've never taken anything for it before."</p>

		<p>"Why?", Josie asked evenly as the muscles in her jaw
		tightened. "Didn't your family know you were in pain?", the touch of anger and
		indignation in her voice was almost imperceptible, but Rebecca noticed it and instead of
		flinching, felt a sense of comfort that she didn't understand.</p>

		<p>"I started getting these really painful cramps and the
		headaches when I was fourteen. I told my mother, but...." she turned away, unable to
		look at her raven headed companion. Josie jerked the reins and pulled the wagon to a stop.
		She reached over and cupped the younger woman's chin, turning her face to meet her gaze.
		Ice blue eyes pierced into green.</p>

		<p>"But what, Rebecca?" her tone softened slightly, but
		inside the gunslinger's anger was churning into a steady boil. "But what?"
		</p>

		<p>"Medicine costs money...money we didn't have." Her
		voice was barely above a whisper, but Josie heard the lie all the same.</p>

		<p>"Didn't have, Rebecca? Or were you afraid to tell your
		father?" The visible flinching gave the bounty hunter her answer. She released her
		hold on the young woman and reached over the seat for the saddlebag that contained their
		bottle of laudanum. "Take some," Josie said as she handed Rebecca the nearly
		full container.</p>

		<p>"Thank you." She put the bottle to her lips and took a
		small swallow. Another cramp hit, forcing her to bend slightly while pressing against her
		midriff with her free arm. She took a bigger swallow. Satisfied that Rebecca had drank
		enough to ease the pain, Josie put the stopper in the bottle and put it back in the
		saddlebags. Without another word, she clucked her tongue and sent Flossy into motion.
		</p>

		<p>They passed the time in an amiable silence until breaking for
		lunch and a rest for the horses, then continued on for several hours. The deep ruts in the
		road made the ride even more bumpy than usual and Josie began to notice a slight change in
		the feel of the ride. She was about to pull Flossy to a stop when the right front wheel
		passed over a small rock. The force of the landing was enough to snap the rusty pin that
		held the spoke wheel to the axle. With lightening reflexes, Josie reached out and grabbed
		Rebecca before she could topple off of the bench. The added weight of the young woman
		caused the gunslinger to slide on the bench, imbedding several splinters into her rear on
		her way down.</p>

		<p>"Damn," Josie swore as she climbed out of the wagon and
		unbuttoned her britches. Her gun belts dropped loosely to the ground. Rebecca stood up and
		inspected the damage to the buckboard. The wheel was lying on its side on the ground,
		firmly wedged under the corner of the wagon. Their belongings were scattered about and
		both the barrel of coal oil and the box of soap had opened, mixing and spilling their
		contents all over the bedding materials and clothes. Josie's britches were down around her
		ankles along with her drawers while she tried unsuccessfully to remove the offending
		pieces of wood. She turned to look at the wagon and scowled. "Of all the..."
		Josie shuffled closer to the wagon.</p>

		<p>"Josie, why are you like that?"</p>

		<p>"Because I have a baker's dozen worth of splinters up my
		ass, Rebecca!" she growled. She tried again in vain to remove one of them. She bent
		down and moved her britches out of the way to reach the cuff of her boot. Josie pulled out
		the bowie knife and handed it to her companion before standing up and turning around.
		Rebecca suppressed the urge to giggle at the gunslinger's fate.</p>

		<p>A continuous stream of ouches and curses filled the air as she
		diligently removed every splinter. The none-too-happy Josie <img src="res/fanfic/authors/bl_miller/western_chronicles/splinters.jpg" alt="Splinters by Angelique" border="0" align="left" width="306" height="304"/>refastened her clothing and guns
		while Rebecca started to remove the gear from the wagon, separating the clothes and
		bedding from the other stuff. The gunslinger knelt down next to the axle. "The damn
		pin broke." The smell of coal oil and soap mixed together penetrated her senses,
		furthering her aggravation. Without thinking, Josie rose and kicked the axle with all her
		anger.</p>

		<p>Rebecca spun around at the groan of pain in time to see the
		intimidating bounty hunter grab her foot and hop around in a circle before falling to the
		ground, cursing the entire time. "Josie? What happened?" she asked as she rushed
		to her side.</p>

		<p>"Oh, I kicked the stupid damned axle," Josie said
		through gritted teeth as she held her booted foot with both hands. She let loose a deep
		breath and closed her eyes. "I think I broke my foot."</p>

		<p>Despite Rebecca's best efforts to make the boot removal as gentle
		as possible, Josie's foot was still bumped and jarred, causing her to clench her jaw and
		take deep breaths to avoid yelping at the pain. Her suspicions were confirmed when her
		toes finally came free of the leather. The big toe was already a deep purple, the bruising
		extending all the way to the foot. Rebecca tsk tsked at the broken toe and looked around.
		"I guess we're making camp early tonight."</p>

		<p>"Guess so," Josie said dejectedly.</p>
