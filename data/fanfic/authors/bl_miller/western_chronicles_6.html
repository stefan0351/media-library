<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 6: The Shadow -->

<p>Rebecca woke to a bright sun beating down on her. She quickly
		scrambled to her feet, wincing at the soreness. The outlaw was gone. She moved into the
		campsite and placed her hand over the now dead fire. It was cold. Ignoring the pain in her
		legs and feet, Rebecca set out to follow Josie. As she walked, she wondered if the outlaw
		knew she was sleeping only a few feet away. She tried to remember the stories she had
		heard about Josie.</p>

		<p>The details were sketchy to her, but the general information was
		clear. Josie was wanted in more than half the states for one thing or another. She led
		gangs on raids of wagons and stagecoaches. Rebecca thought that she had read that train
		robberies were the dark clothed woman's specialty. Rumor was that the 'Terror of the Train
		Rails' was responsible for no less than one hundred deaths and even more shootings and
		robberies. Rebecca tried to merge the image of the outlaw that she had read about with the
		image that she had seen. Josie Hunter was featured in several of the dime novels Rebecca
		had read in bits and pieces sitting on a barrel in the back of the mercantile while her
		mother shopped. But the woman described in those stories bore no resemblance - other than
		in name - to the exotic creature who grudgingly shared a meal with her last night. Her
		father had said that Josie was pure evil, but that wasn't what she saw. Why would someone
		who was purely evil bother to rescue her from bandits, or give her food to eat? Surely she
		would have just let her go to her fate, perhaps even killed her herself. No, the tall
		woman in black wasn't purely evil. There was some good in that heart, of that Rebecca was
		sure. She wondered what had happened to make the blue-eyed woman become one of the most
		feared criminals in the West.</p>

		<p>She followed the trail all day, resting only for a few minutes at
		a small creek to wash her face and drink as much water as she could without choking. She
		didn't know how much of a head start Josie had on her, and she didn't want to add to the
		distance. Her feet protested every step, and her legs screamed with every stride. Rebecca
		didn't know why she felt so compelled to follow the outlaw, she just knew that she had to.</p>

		<p>Cresting a small rise, Josie noted the signs of a small camp. A
		quick look at the horses and tents told her that there were at least five men. At the
		moment, three were engaged in a card game. She didn't see any others. Urging Phoenix to go
		back down the rise, Josie thought about the blonde girl. The outlaw was certain that the
		young woman was following her. Josie dismounted and hid herself and Phoenix within the
		cover of nearby trees. Sure enough, within an hour, the blonde woman appeared in the
		distance.</p>

		<p>Josie wasn't the only one to notice the girl in a dirty dress
		walking. One of the men from the camp had climbed up the rise to relieve himself and
		whistled. "Hey boys! Guess what's headin' our way." Five other men climbed up
		the rise and looked to see what all the fuss was about. Josie cursed silently and took a
		small step backward to hide herself more. "Thomas..." The first man said
		quietly, although Josie's keen hearing picked up every word. "You and John head over
		that way." He turned to face the other men. "Mike and Sam, you two go over
		there. Rich and I will stay here. We'll surround her." The men laughed lecherously.</p>

		<p>If there was one thing that Josie hated, it was a bunch of men
		trying to pick on a small girl. Putting her hands on her guns, she stepped out from the
		cover of the trees. "Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Or are little girls
		all you can handle?" Two men reached for their side arms. Josie's bullets flew,
		cutting them both down. "Anyone else?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca heard the gunshots and panicked; she dove under the
		nearest bush and prayed no part of her clothing was showing. There were several more
		exchanges of gunfire before there was a long period of silence.</p>

		<p>"You can come out now, girl." Josie said in an annoyed
		tone. Rebecca slowly climbed out from the bushes and looked at the outlaw. Josie
		gracefully slid from her saddle. In three long strides she was within arms reach of
		Rebecca. "You don't listen very well. I had to kill six men to keep them from raping
		you. That makes a total of nine men's deaths on my hands because of you." Rebecca
		didn't know what to say. She felt bad for the men dying.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry." She said meekly. In an instant, Josie's
		gun was against her nose. She heard the unmistakable sound of the hammer cocking.</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, just improve. Figure out a way to save your
		own hide; I'm sick of doing it for you." She looked at the blonde thoughtfully.
		"I should kill you now to make sure you don't bother me anymore." Rebecca said
		nothing as she looked down at the cool steel pressed against her nose. Deciding that her
		point was made, Josie pulled her gun back, releasing the hammer gently before sliding it
		into her holster. She mounted Phoenix and turned back to the men's camp.</p>
