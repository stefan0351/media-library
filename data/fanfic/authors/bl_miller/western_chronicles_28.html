<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 28: Making Friends -->

<p>All the next morning Rebecca had a six-foot shadow. Once the
		gunslinger realized that all the laughter the previous day was at her friend's expense,
		she refused to leave her alone with the more worldly women. Despite her lack of education,
		Victoria understood the tall woman's actions and the reason why. Josie tossed the metal
		coffee mug into the back of their wagon and reached for Phoenix's saddle. "Let's try
		not to wake up the dead with all the noise today," she said firmly. The gunslinger
		made eye contact with each one of them, silently conveying a different message, one that
		was easily understood - no picking on her young friend.</p>

		<p>The next three days passed quickly. The small caravan continued
		its trek westward until the river took a turn north. The breaks were less frequent as the
		women adjusted to the long ride and required fewer stops to rest. Rebecca and Victoria
		continued to ride in the back of the first wagon, although the conversation never went
		anywhere near the subject that embarrassed the blonde so much. Only Josie noticed the
		recent horse tracks that indicated another rider had passed this way recently. She
		shortened the distance between her and the wagons. Their route took them through a small
		canyon full of blind turns and twists, all of which served to heighten the gunslinger's
		anxiety. She quietly removed her remaining gun from its holster, wishing now that she had
		not given the other to Stacey and the shotgun to Elaine to protect the wagons.</p>

		<p>The short hairs on the back of Josie's neck prickled, but it was
		too late. Three riders appeared in the path ahead, all fully armed and aiming straight at
		them. Her blue eyes narrowed when she realized that the leader was none other than Lefty
		Brown, the man she wanted to capture back in Rosewood. She pulled Phoenix to a stop, her
		mind calculating whether she could get all three of them before they managed to get a shot
		off. A commotion behind her caused the gunslinger to turn in the saddle. Two more men
		appeared from behind them, their shotguns pointed at the women in the rear wagon. Lefty
		laughed, showing a mouth of crooked yellow teeth. "Well, well...lookie what we found,
		boys." His brown eyes locked on the gun in Josie's hand. He moved his horse forward
		and disarmed the tall woman who offered no resistance. From the clothing, he assumed her
		to be the leader of the group and thus, the most dangerous. With a vicious laugh, he
		landed the butt of his gun against her temple, sending the gunslinger pitching forward
		into blackness.</p>

		<p>The small adobe structure served as the gang's hideout. There was
		no roof to block the sun and draperies hung on ropes strung about served to separate the
		area into two rooms. The nine women were against one wall, pieces of rope keeping their
		hands behind their backs. The unconscious Josie was in the corner, her temple purple from
		the force of the blow. Lefty turned the bowie knife he had taken from the gunslinger's
		boot over and over in his hand, admiring the quality for a moment before turning his
		attention to something else he admired. "Hey Johnny, you picked one out yet?" he
		called to the short, squat man kneeling in front of the women.</p>

		<p>"Oh hell, Lefty, you know they're all the same at the
		bottom," he replied, reaching out with a grimy paw to squeeze the redhead's breast.
		Stacey closed her eyes, knowing there was no way to avoid the inevitable as Johnny pulled
		her roughly to her feet. As they headed to the other side of the curtain, she put her mind
		into a working mode, pretending that this was just another paying customer instead of a
		man intent on raping her. One by one the other men stepped forward and chose their
		pleasures. The women went without protest, knowing from experience that it was of no use.
		As Elaine was being led away, she swore that they would all pay if any of her girls got
		hurt.</p>

		<p>Victoria and Rebecca were sitting next to each other, the
		remaining two women several feet away. The gunslinger still had not stirred, heightening
		Rebecca's fear as Lefty moved forward and squatted in front of the two young women. It
		took all of her control not to cry or whimper when he reached forward and slowly ran the
		point of the blade across her right breast, not deep enough to cut, but firm enough to
		make his intentions clear. Victoria found her voice. "Sassy, did you get rid of that
		itch yet?"</p>

		<p>It took only a second for Rebecca to understand what her friend
		was doing. "Uh...no. Doc says I need a cream or something," she replied,
		squirming slightly as if trying to ease the imaginary discomfort between her legs. The
		blade retreated as Lefty backed away from her. He didn't know if the bitches were lying or
		not but he had no intention of finding out. The little blonde wasn't worth it.</p>

		<p>"Looks like yer it, sweet thing," he said as he turned
		his attentions to the Victoria.</p>

		<p>Josie listened to the exchange with her eyes still closed to
		feign unconsciousness as her fingers worked to slip under her belt, finding the small slit
		that hid the secret compartment. With dexterity born out of practice, she released the
		small knife from its hiding place and sliced through the ropes soundlessly. The ropes fell
		loosely to the ground behind her as she gripped the tip of the blade between her right
		thumb and forefinger. The blue eyes opened and focused as she brought her arm around. With
		a flick of the wrist, she sent the small blade through the air with blinding speed and
		force, imbedding it deep into Lefty's neck, severing his jugular as well as his windpipe.
		In an instant she was upon him, taking the bowie knife from his hand and imbedding it deep
		into his chest. She took just a second to look at Rebecca before removing the weapon from
		his lifeless body. Josie cut the bonds that held the young women and retrieved her
		revolvers. Without a sound, she slipped between the curtains. Four shots rang out; the
		proximity hurt Rebecca's ears.</p>

		<p>Elaine looked down at the man lying dead at her feet. Looking
		around, she saw Josie helping Stacey roll the dead man off her while the other two women
		ran from the room. The gunslinger didn't see the man slowly rising to his feet blood
		covering the front of his filthy shirt, as he brought his gun up, his dying energy spent
		trying to aim. Elaine reached down and grabbed the gun from the holster of the dead man at
		her feet and fired. Josie's head snapped around to see and her blue eyes locked with the
		hazel eyes of the prostitute. Both nodded slightly in silent appreciation of the other.</p>

		<p>The women assembled in the larger room. Victoria had taken the
		knife from Lefty's throat and used it to free the other two women. Rebecca never moved
		from her position except to draw her knees up and bury her head in her arms as her body
		shook. Josie knelt down next to her, uncertain of what to say. The young woman sensed her
		presence and flung herself against the gunslinger with enough force to knock the older
		woman back on her rear. The events and emotions caught up with Rebecca as she wrapped her
		arms around Josie's neck and sobbed. Part of the tears were for her, for how close she had
		come to being raped, but the other part was for her new friends, and how they were.
		Prostitutes or not, they were still women taken against their will and Rebecca couldn't
		stop herself from crying.</p>

		<p>Josie was clearly uncomfortable with the outpouring of emotions,
		but made no effort to extricate herself from her friend, instead placing a stiff arm
		against Rebecca's back and squeezing slightly. She waited a couple of minutes for the
		young woman's breathing to calm down before she moved her arm and stiffened her back,
		silently indicating the end of the embrace. Rebecca sniffled and sat back, wiping her eyes
		with the sleeves of her shirt. Josie looked over at Elaine, silently pleading for help.
		The black headed woman understood and whispered something in Victoria's ear. The young
		woman went over and sat cross-legged next to Rebecca and put her hand on her shoulder.
		Elaine followed and stood behind them, facing the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Can you help me get the bodies on the wagon?"</p>

		<p>"I guess we'd better," Josie said and rose a little too
		enthusiastically, grateful for the excuse to get away. Victoria spoke quietly with Rebecca
		for several minutes before she was assured that everything was fine.</p>

		<p>The dead men were piled into the back of the whore's wagon while
		the women sat either in the back of the lead wagon or rode the men's horses. They used a
		piece of canvas found at the hideout to cover the bodies to keep the sun from rotting them
		any quicker than necessary as well as to keep the buzzards away. The gunslinger pushed the
		group hard, wanting to get to town as soon as possible. It was close to nightfall when
		they saw the first signs of Laramie. A collective sigh of relief was heard when Josie
		pulled the group to a stop a mile outside of town. She pulled Phoenix alongside the lead
		wagon. "We need to bring the bodies to the marshal. Elaine, you come with me. The
		others stay here," she leveled her gaze at Rebecca to make certain she was
		understood. Seeing her nod in assent, Josie looked over the rest of the group. "You
		might as well set up camp; I don't think we'll be back before morning."</p>

		<p>Josie stopped the wagon in front of the jail and handed the reins
		to Elaine before getting out. She entered the building and returned a few minutes later
		with a stack of wanted posters and the marshal. He held a lantern up near the faces of the
		dead men. "Well, looks like Lefty, all right," he said, double checking his
		information on the wanted poster. "Them others look familiar too. Lemme see." He
		took the pile of posters from Josie and shuffled through them, pulling out the ones that
		seemed to be possibilities. Within an hour, they had identified three of the men as being
		wanted with the total sum running just over one hundred dollars. The gunslinger was a bit
		disappointed in the bounty, but said nothing as she followed the marshal and the wagon to
		the undertaker's place on the edge of town. Once their business was done, Josie made
		arrangements with the marshal to meet her at the bank in the morning while Elaine took the
		horses and wagon to the stable.</p>

		<p>Josie had just enough money to get a small room in the flophouse
		after paying for the stable and a few drinks in the saloon. The room was lit with one
		small lantern, casting a dim orange glow throughout the room. "What are you going to
		do now?", Elaine asked as she sat on the edge of the bed. The gunslinger reached down
		and untied the leather straps that held her holsters to her thighs.</p>

		<p>"We'll get the money in the morning and replenish the
		supplies. It'll take a couple of days to get to Cheyenne, and I have a friend there that
		can help." She removed her gun belts and set them on the floor next to the bed before
		sitting down and pulling her boots off.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." Elaine began, not looking at the tall woman
		seated next to her. "I wanted to thank you...for everything." She turned to
		study the gunslinger's profile. As the bounty hunter tucked her boots under the bed,
		Elaine rose and removed her dress to stand before Josie clad only in the thinnest and most
		revealing of slips. "I really want to thank you," she said seductively as she
		moved closer and straddled the gunslinger's hips.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The women finished off the last of their liquor supply while
		Rebecca entertained them with one of her endless supply of stories, occasionally
		pretending to take a sip as the bottle was passed back and forth, but in fact carefully
		avoiding allowing the liquid to run into her mouth. The events of the day faded away as
		several women began to tell raunchy stories and jokes. While the conversation was slightly
		embarrassing to Rebecca, it wasn't as bad as when they first started and she had became
		comfortable enough to laugh with them at some of the jokes. They all settled in early,
		most because of the booze. Rebecca laid her blanket down next to the wagon wheel, apart
		from the others. She had a second blanket that she usually used as a cushion between her
		and the hard earth, but realized that the others didn't have true blankets. They used
		saddle blankets taken from the horses at the end of the day and some had no blankets at
		all. She took her spare blanket and both of Josie's and passed them out for the others to
		use.</p>

		<p>She rolled up Josie's duster and used it for a pillow as she
		settled down onto the firm earth. Time drifted as her thoughts swirled aimlessly before
		settling on one thought. Rebecca opened one eye and looked about. The others were in
		various stages of sleeping and paid no attention to her. She nervously brought her hand
		under the blanket and unbuttoned most of her shirt. Slowly, her hand crept beneath the
		cotton material and her fingertips fluttered across her nipple, making the coral skin
		harden and contract to a point. Her fingers splayed out as she rubbed her palm across the
		tip before squeezing the whole mound firmly. She brought her other hand under the cover,
		giving both breasts equal attention. In her mind, she saw the knight ravishing the
		princess, with him still in his suit of armor, his face hidden. Her thumb and forefingers
		captured her hard nipples, rolling and pinching them as she arched into her own touch. Her
		breathing quickened as she continued to pleasure her breasts and the heat increased
		between her legs.</p>

		<p>Oh so slowly she lowered her right hand down and unbuttoned her
		britches, her left hand never easing up on its assault of her nipple. She reached in
		beneath her under-drawers and let her fingers comb through her soft blonde curls. She let
		out a soft sigh as her fingertips touched the soaking ringlets. The tight britches denied
		her access to her most private area. Reluctantly, she brought her left hand down to help
		and pushed the clothes off of her hips and down until she could spread her knees apart.
		Rebecca lifted one knee up and braced her leg against the wagon wheel as her hand made its
		way between her thighs. She was surprised to find how wet and slick her thighs were until
		she touched her swollen outer folds and felt the flood soak her fingers. She pressed
		against herself, the palm rubbing back and forth against her aching sex. Her middle finger
		slipped between the folds and pressed near her opening. Rebecca began a slow exploration
		of herself, her fingertips tracing every fold, discovering what felt nice and what didn't.
		She focused on the image of the knight and princess as her middle and index fingers found
		themselves on either side of her most sensitive spot and squeezed rhythmically. Her breath
		started coming in short gasps and her hips moved of their own volition. She instinctively
		moved her fingers, pressing against the small hood of skin above the hard nub. Her blood
		pounded in her ears as she planted her feet and lifted her hips off the ground, her
		fingers never losing their position or pace as they swirled about. She gritted her teeth
		as time and space blended away and a wave of indescribable pleasure gushed through her
		body. She let out a small cry before falling limply back to the now damp ground.</p>

		<p>Two of the women had been wakened by the sound, but seeing
		nothing amiss, rolled over and went back to sleep. Rebecca lay there, wide-awake, reveling
		in the new sensation. It was a long time before she found the strength to reach down and
		fix her clothing and even that movement caused a small shudder to pass through her. She
		finally got into a sleeping position, a lazy smile never leaving her face. Josie was
		right, she thought. Nothing that feels this good could possibly be bad.</p>
