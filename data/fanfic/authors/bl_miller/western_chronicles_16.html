<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 16: Careers -->

<p>After a quick breakfast consisting of the remains of their
		rations, Josie wrote a note telling Rebecca to stay put and then left the boarding house.
		With purposeful strides she crossed the street and entered the jail. </p>

		<p>"What can I do for you today, young fella?" the sheriff
		asked without looking up from his solitaire hand. </p>

		<p>"I want to look at the wanted list," she said in a
		commanding tone. His head popped up at the unexpected gender. </p>

		<p>"Uh...yes, of course." He reached over and retrieved a
		stack of wanted posters piled haphazardly on the corner of his desk. As he passed the pile
		to her, he realized that he was using his gun hand and was defenseless should this tall
		woman in black choose to send him to Saint Peter. To his relief, she simply took the pile
		of papers and sat down in a nearby chair, apparently uninterested in him.
		"Uh...somethin' you're looking for...uh...Miss?" </p>

		<p>Josie smiled inwardly at the sheriff's fear of her. "Just
		seeing who's worth what," she replied, her eyes pouring over the wanted posters. She
		studied every name, what they were wanted for and where. She studied each likeness and
		tried to commit each characteristic to memory. She also removed the poster with her own
		likeness on it and slid it off the stack and into her pocket. Wouldn't do to have the
		sheriff spot her picture so soon after seeing her in the flesh. After several minutes she
		stood up and put the pile back on the corner of his desk. "I suggest you double check
		the locks on your cells. I have a feeling you'll be filling up soon," she said as she
		walked out the door, leaving a confused and nervous sheriff behind. </p>

		<p>She reviewed the list of wanted men in her mind, discarding some
		as not being worth the bother and making mental notes on others. Horse thieves weren't on
		her list of those to turn in for justice. Although she had bought and paid for Phoenix,
		she herself had stolen a number of horses in her day. Deciding that no man should die for
		stealing an animal, she moved on in her mental list to concentrate on those she would look
		for. Men who raped or murdered women and children were highest on her list. Her eyes
		narrowed when she saw the familiar blonde woman exiting the doctor's office. Her long legs
		quickly ate up the distance between them. </p>

		<p>"What are you doing here? Are you sick?" She began a
		visual inspection of Rebecca. </p>

		<p>"No, I thought I could learn something about healing while
		you were off doing whatever it is that you were doing." It was then that Josie
		noticed the two small jars that were in the young woman's hands. "Oh, one is for
		cleaning a wound and the other is to help with pain." </p>

		<p>"How much did those cost?" Josie asked warily, her mind
		already trying to calculate the amount. </p>

		<p>"Nothing. He gave me these small bottles for helping
		him." </p>

		<p>"Helping him?" </p>

		<p>"A young boy came in with a broken arm. I told him a story
		while the doctor put a splint on. You should have seen him, Josie. His name is Timothy and
		he didn't cry, not one bit. He just sat there and listened to my story." The smile on
		her face and tone of pride in her voice were infectious and Josie reluctantly allowed a
		small smile. They walked back to the boarding house together, Rebecca recounting all that
		she had learned in the short time she was with the doctor and spoke of going back later to
		learn more. Josie didn't miss the hopeful 'see I'm trying to learn something so I can
		help' tone in the young woman's voice, although her face remained impassive. </p>

		<p>After a quick supper that was barely edible, the pair retired to
		their room. The gunslinger sat on the floor, bracing her back against a wall while the
		young woman sat on the bed, using the headboard as a backrest. Josie went through her
		usual routine of cleaning and inspecting her weapons while Rebecca read by lamplight. Doc
		Jackson had loaned her a beginner's medical text and she was voraciously reading it,
		absorbing as many details as she could about different emergency treatments for wounds and
		illness. She skipped over rare or unusual injuries, concentrating mostly on things she
		perceived could happen on the road; snake bites, bullet wounds, scorpion stings, and more.
		Josie watched out of the corner of her eye as page after page was turned in Rebecca's
		quest for knowledge. 'I'll give you one thing, sprite; you have determination,' Josie
		thought to herself as she turned her attention back to the task at hand, that being the
		polishing of her guns. </p>

		<p>When Rebecca rubbed her eyes for the third time in an hour, Josie
		set her rifle down and stood. "I think that's enough reading for one night."
		Taking the book from the reluctant girl, she set it down on the table and prepared for
		bed. Exhaustion got the best of the outlaw and she fell asleep soon after hitting the
		pillow. </p>
