	<chapter title="Always 1">
		<p>As the horse topped the rise, it's tall, black-haired rider could see the narrow, yet dense, fringe of forest. It separated the river's flood plain from the foothills, as well as the road which horse and rider were following that led into its depths.</p>
		<p>The sharp, crystal blue eyes spotted a tower of black smoke billowing up from the far side of the thick mass of green. She was instantly on guard, her senses reaching out in search of anything out of place, some sight or sound that might warn of impending danger. The breeze coming off the river reached her, even here, ruffling her long midnight tresses.</p>
		<p>Xena had come this way before and recalled the large, quickly growing river city of Ciros that was situated on the banks of the river just beyond the narrow band of forest. This was where she was supposed to join her beloved bard and mate, Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Some villagers had asked for the warrior's help with some marauding bandits who had been raiding their small village. Since the villagers were poor farmers, they had no way of conceiving any kind of defense and were in desperate need of assistance.</p>
		<p>They heard that Xena had turned to the side of good, and that she was in the area, so they sent a small group of representatives to ask for her help.</p>
		<p>The reformed warlord and Gabrielle were on their way to Amazon lands for Gabrielle to meet with the council of elders over some minor dispute that their laws allowed only their Queen to resolve.</p>
		<p>The regent's judgment wouldn't do since she was indirectly involved in the dispute. Xena had to smile as she thought of her small companion and how determined she was to do her duties as queen, even though she wasn't there full time. Yet another reason she loved her bard so much.</p>
		<p>In fact, they were seldom in Amazon lands any more, an oversight the warrior wanted to correct for her bard as soon as they were together again.</p>
		<p>When the villagers showed up at their camp with their request, Xena was going to decline. She was accompanying her bard to her destination and loathed leaving her side.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle, being Gabrielle, had insisted Xena go to the aid of the villagers while she and the four Amazon scouts who brought the summons went on to the Amazon nation.</p>
		<p>The warrior princess was not too thrilled with the plan, but Gabrielle would not relent. So she agreed and they planned to meet at Ciros when they'd finished their separate missions.</p>
		<p>"All right, I don't like leaving you for this long," Xena had said sulkily when they parted ways. "We will meet at the Hag's Head Inn just outside the western gate into Ciros in two weeks, three at the outside, no later."</p>
		<p>"I promise my love, and I'll miss you too, my fierce warrior." Gabrielle spoke softly in her partner's ear as she kissed her cheek. "I'll wait for you forever if I must. I promise you a hello you'll never forget when we're together again."</p>
		<p>A wry smirk crossed her lips as she recalled how she had blushed when she heard the Amazons giggling, realizing they'd heard the little blonde's promise.</p>
		<p>"You did that on purpose," she growled softly into her lover's perfect pink shell-like ear.</p>
		<p>"Of course I did," Gabrielle teased. "I just love the way only I can make my big tough warrior blush, and you are so fetching when you blush."</p>
		<p>This made Xena blush even more, and the self-satisfied smirk on the bard's face was just too much. The powerful woman reached down and wrapped her strong arms around her Amazon Queen's waist and pulled her close, holding the tight, compact, perfectly proportioned, body against her own.</p>
		<p>She loved the feel of the smaller woman's muscular frame sculpted by hours of staff practice with her warrior. Xena lifted Gabrielle to her until their lips met in a soul-searing kiss. Gabrielle's lips parted automatically allowing entrance to her passionate lover's probing, swirling tongue.</p>
		<p>Xena deepened the kiss until the world around them ceased to exist for the now highly aroused bard. Her head began to spin from lust and lack of oxygen.</p>
		<p>The bard moaned her passion into her warrior's mouth as she felt Xena growling from deep in her chest.</p>
		<p>Finally, when Gabrielle was sure she was about to melt, Xena released her, patting her on the top of her head. Without speaking, the tall beautiful woman turned and leapt to Argo's saddle.</p>
		<p>"That should help you remember your promise till we meet again." Xena laughed as Gabrielle's lust glazed emerald eyes refocused then went wide in disbelief as she realized her lover's intention. "Two weeks, my love, and I'll be there to collect my *hello*."</p>
		<p>With that, she'd galloped off down the road, the villagers trying desperately to keep up with her unexpected departure. Gabrielle was left sputtering with shock and frustration as she watched the very center of her world gallop quickly out of sight.</p>
		<p>The bard waited on top of that hill, watching until Xena was out of sight, before she signaled her companions and headed for Amazon lands.</p>
		<p>Xena knew because she kept looking back until she could no long see her bard and her party and every time she looked back she saw her beautiful lover watching and waving.</p>
		<p>She had hated leaving her companion and lover and the whole time she was helping the villagers she was like a trapped panther. Constantly pacing and snarling at anyone unfortunate enough to come within striking distance.</p>
		<p>Xena could hardly sit still long enough to eat and sleep was impossible. If she wasn't working on the villagers defenses, she would go off somewhere private and do her sword drills and anything else she could think of, trying to take her mind off the empty feeling in her heart from the absence of her bard.</p>
		<p>The Warrior Princess became so surly, the villagers were almost more afraid of her than the bandits. Dark circles appeared under her nearly colorless eyes and her cheekbones were becoming prominent beneath her pale skin, as sleep and appetite eluded her.</p>
		<p>Finally, Xena became tired of waiting for the outlaws to attack and went out in search of their camp to put an end to their threat once and for all.</p>
		<p>Patience wasn't one of Xena's many skills, but tracking was. It wasn't long before the warrior princess located the main camp of the so-called bandits.</p>
		<p>They were a rag tag group of deserters and rejects that the fates had thrown together on a whim. The group had no discipline or real leadership. If the village had been larger, the bandits would have been cut down with their first raid.</p>
		<p>In fact, they would have presented no threat to any organized defense. Which explained why they had gone after the smaller villages instead of moving on to more lucrative areas.</p>
		<p>Having located their camp and assessed their strengths and numbers, Xena was tempted to go after them by herself, but remembering her promise to her little bard she returned to the village.</p>
		<p>The warrior selected a party of ten of the best fighters and five of the most promising archers. The anxious warrior led them in a surprise attack on the outlaw camp as dawn broke the next morning.</p>
		<p>The attack was a total success and the few who survived the devastating strike by Xena and her recently formed "army", scattered to the mountains, far beyond the boundaries of the little group of villages. Not only were they no longer a threat, but also the survivors spreading the tale of the villager's retaliation, made it less likely that another group of bandits wound take their place. Anyone would at least think twice before launching an assault on the isolated farming villages.</p>
		<p>Having made sure the village was safe from any immediate threat, Xena gracefully accepted their thanks, refused their offers of reward, and hurriedly packed her belongings. She quickly but quietly left the still celebrating villagers for her rendezvous with her beloved Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Anxious to once again be in the arms of her emerald-eyed companion, Xena urged her loyal war-horse, Argo, toward the river port of Ciros.</p>
		<p>Two days out from her destination, Xena woke just before dawn with a tightness in her chest and a knot in her stomach. Confused at first, the warrior closed her eyes and tied to get in touch of whatever the inner alarm was trying to tell her.</p>
		<p>As she concentrated, sifting through the millions of thought fragments, only one word screamed out to her. It was the one word that was the very core of Xena's being, the one word that was sure to get her undivided attention. The only word that could launch her up to break camp, throw her gear onto the saddle, that she too was quickly settling into.</p>
		<p>The one word that would cause her to push herself and her beloved Argo to the very limits of their endurance. The one word... Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>For some reason, unknown to Xena, she had the overwhelming feeling that her bard was in deep trouble and was in dire need of her warrior.</p>
		<p>Xena rode hard all that day and late into the night, the feeling that her Gabrielle was in serious trouble getting stronger with each passing moment.</p>
		<p>It was well into the night and she realized how hard she was pushing Argo when the powerful horse stumbled on the dark trail. She came to the realization that if she were going to reach her bard at all, she would have to stop and rest her horse before it killed itself trying to please her.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry old girl." Xena apologized to the tired animal as she rubbed her down with burlap bags she carried just for that purpose. "I got carried away worrying about Brie. I just can't shake this feeling that she's in trouble and needs us. Know what I mean?"</p>
		<p>At the question, the long-time traveling companion snorted and shook her head, seeming to agree with her rider. The big horse pawed the ground as if to express her concern over the short blonde that saved carrots and apples as treats for the golden Arabian mare.</p>
		<p>"I know big girl, I miss her too," the warrior whispered to her horse that shared her heart with the absent bard. "We'll rest for a while and get an early start in the morning."</p>
		<p>The horse blew out a long impatient snort and began munching on the long sweet grass available near the campsite, while her mistress sat on a log next to a small campfire chewing on smoked venison and a hard tack biscuit.</p>
		<p>It wasn't long before Xena lay in her bedroll trying to get some much-needed sleep. It was a battle to get her eyes to close so that she could fall into a light restless nightmare-plagued sleep.</p>
		<p>Her mind was filled with visions of her lover in dire need, and calling to the warrior for help, but she always remained just out of reach. Giving up just before dawn, Xena broke camp, saddled Argo, and they were on the road again just as the horizon was lightening in anticipation of sunrise.</p>
		<p>The sun was well up when Xena topped the final ridge. Before she entered the narrow band of forest that separated the highlands from the wide slow flowing river and the tower of smoke, the warrior silently prayed to Artemis to protect her chosen.</p>
		<p>That in itself was an indication of how worried she was about the small golden haired bard who had so completely captured her heart.</p>
		<p>The smell of battle on the light breeze that blew in from the river did little to ease the warrior's worry. She knew it was less than a half days ride to Ciros and her waiting bard. What she was seeing now made Xena fervently hope that the usually punctual Amazon Queen would be late for their meeting.</p>
		<p>Xena spurred her mount toward the trail that led through the forest wanting to get to the source of the smoke as quickly as she could, but all the time knowing deep down in the darkest region of her soul that she was not going to like what she found.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 2">
		<p>As she neared the end of the forest trail, Xena began to see signs of a large force of well-trained soldiers passing in the same direction that she was heading.</p>
		<p>She had first noticed their signs as she reached the midway point of the band of forest, and could tell they had traveled there in small groups to avoid detection.</p>
		<p>The signs showed the groups had come together at a predetermined point to regroup for attack. This was not the first time Xena had seen this tactic. In fact, she'd used it herself in her early days as a warlord.</p>
		<p>The fact that this force was using it did little to ease her apprehension for the safety of her blonde lover. It was a little after mid-afternoon when Xena came to the place where the unknown army had regrouped and formed their battle lines for their assault on the target. By all the signs she had seen, Xena knew their final objective was the city of Ciros.</p>
		<p>As quickly and stealthily as she could, Xena followed the obvious trail till she reached the point where the trees thinned out at the wide floodplain of the river.</p>
		<p>The smells of battle were thick in the air now, the scent of fear, blood, and death filled the nostrils of the warrior princess. They were scents she knew well; war's perfume she'd once called it. The smell turned her stomach now.</p>
		<p>She cautiously rode out of the trees then stopped in horror at the sight that greeted her as she neared the city. Flanking the road into the once thriving town were tall poles on both sides. Hanging from each pole was the mutilated body of what appeared to have been a soldier.</p>
		<p>She couldn't tell exactly how many there were, but Xena estimated that there were more than fifty or sixty. The cries of the carrion birds filled the air and the smell of burning and decaying flesh blocked all other odors. Even the smoke of the burning city couldn't overpower that stench. As she neared the gate, Xena pulled her sword from it's scabbard and loosened her chakram just in case. She couldn't shake the feeling of being watched from somewhere in the slowly dying city in front of her.</p>
		<p>She rode through the now broken, iron bound, oak gates her eyes moving over the carnage alert to any possible dangers that may be hiding there. It was as she neared the other side of the city just a few yards from the guard shack nearest the Hags Head Inn that Xena found the first Amazon body.</p>
		<p>She nearly missed the small young woman's remains buried under a smoldering collapsed wall of a small shed-like building. The sight of a muscular leg sticking out in the open sent a chill up Xena's spine as a heartbeat of panic made her believe that the lifeless limb, wearing an Amazon boot, was her bard.</p>
		<p>She leapt from Argo's back and began digging franticly at the debris until she'd uncovered the nearly shredded body that Xena could barely recognize as Kala.</p>
		<p>The youngster was one of the women that had been Gabrielle's escort along with three other young Amazons that had been eager to impress their queen as responsible warriors. Xena knew there was no way this youngster would be here alone.</p>
		<p>It heightened her worry that the body was here alone and unattended. She did her best to arrange the young warrior's remains, then marked the spot so that it would be easily found by her sisters that were sure to come looking when the Amazon scouts that had accompanied their queen failed to return.</p>
		<p>Xena's nerves were stretched to their limit when she resumed her search for her partner. As she drew close to the Southern city gate, Xena noticed that the signs of the battle that filled the streets were fresher, indicating that it was close to the sight of some kind of last stand.</p>
		<p>One thing that didn't seem right--Xena had yet to see any signs of the marauders that had brought such carnage to this normally peaceful river town. If her mind hadn't been so focused on her missing bard, her suspicions would have been aroused by the conspicuous absence of enemy dead.</p>
		<p>She had once again resumed her course towards the inn when off to one side, along an inner wall, she caught the sight of a slight movement underneath a haphazard pile of bodies.</p>
		<p>On closer examination her sharp clear blue eyes spotted an arm that barely moved, like someone was trying to crawl out from under the pile of dead flesh.</p>
		<p>Catching a flash of an Amazon armband, the frantic warrior was once again digging at the pile of debris and flesh. She was spurred even faster when she heard a quiet pain-filled moan come from the pile.</p>
		<p>Within minutes, Xena reached the still breathing, but severely wounded young woman.</p>
		<p>She gently lifted the limp form, carrying her to a nearby still-standing shed wall that appeared to be stable. The warrior hurried to her saddle bags and returned with her medical supplies and a water skin.</p>
		<p>She gave the now semi-conscious woman a small drink, not wanting her to get sick from too much at once. She treated the Amazons wounds well enough to keep her temporarily safe, so Xena could finish her search for her beloved Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>It didn't take her long to figure out what had occurred here and since she didn't find any other wounded she knew that the only reason she'd found Tauria alive was because she'd been hidden under the other already dead.</p>
		<p>If Xena hadn't come along when she did, the young Amazon would have joined her sister Kala on the other side.</p>
		<p>Just as she was finishing her search, she came across a small party of the invaders that were left behind. The group picking through the debris collecting their dead and wounded, throwing them on a communal pyre. That explained the absence of enemy dead.</p>
		<p>The ensuing fight was short and vicious. By the time a very angry, very frustrated, very worried, Xena was finished with them, all but one of the enemy were dead. They were all nearly torn to pieces by the almost berserker rage that gripped the warrior.</p>
		<p>Only her indomitable love for Gabrielle kept her from killing the last remaining soldier. Before she was finished "questioning" him however, death would have been merciful.</p>
		<p>She kept him alive though, even after she had all the information she could wring from his pain induced memory. He didn't understand why the gore-covered apparition let him live, until she took him to where Tauria was laying recovering her strength.</p>
		<p>Xena gave the prisoner to the wounded woman after she learned that Tauria was bonded to Kala. It was her sign of respect for the Amazon tradition of justice, especially when she knew the woman's small wife had given her life to defend her queen. A debt Xena knew she could never repay.</p>
		<p>After questioning her prisoner, Xena knew the fate of her bard, and the rest of her escort, along with everybody else that had survived the attack that wasn't a soldier.</p>
		<p>The raiding party was under the command of a newly risen warlord named Karcax, that had recently entered the area from the North. They had looted the town and had taken everyone that survived to be sold as slaves to help finance his quest for conquests.</p>
		<p>Knowing what she had to do, Xena took the time to treat Tauria's wounds properly, then made the young grieving warrior take some broth she'd made with the smoked venison and several herbs, to aid the healing process and lessen the woman's physical pain.</p>
		<p>Xena was only sorry she could do nothing for the more devastating pain in the woman's soul. She knew how she would feel if anything happened to her beloved bard.</p>
		<p>"Hold on, Brie," Xena prayed quietly as she began to methodically sharpen her sword "I'm coming for you. Just stay alive for me, my love, that's all I ask--stay alive."</p>
		<p>Xena heard the prisoner whimper softly when she looked over at him. He saw the look in those hard ice blue eyes and trembled in fear. He knew the true nature of terror, he would have welcomed all the tortures of Tarterus than to have to look into those eyes again. He could feel his very soul shrivel up as the hard crystal blue eyes bore holes into him.</p>
		<p>Xena knew what she must look like the dirt and dust from the road was combined with chunks of flesh bone and viscera along with dried, clotted blood covered her from head to toe.</p>
		<p>She knew but she didn't care. Her every thought, every action was focused on finding and freeing her bard, after that, she'd worry about bathing.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about me, pig," Xena laughed coldly at his fears. "Your problems begin when her sister Amazons get here. You belong to them and they aren't very merciful to men that murder their sisters and take their queen as slave."</p>
		<p>The man's eyes grew wide as he realized what awaited him. Every rumor he'd ever heard about the Amazon Nation and their treatment of prisoners ran through his mind.</p>
		<p>It was fully dark and the moon had set when Xena sensed their presence, and a cold smile crossed her lips.</p>
		<p>"Your captors are here. I hope you've made peace with yourself for your past," Xena stated to the terrified man. "Come on in ladies, I have been expecting you. I must leave soon so lets get this over with."</p>
		<p>Several Amazon scouts in full war dress appeared out of the surrounding darkness as silent as phantoms. Only the warrior princess' finely-honed senses could have detected them.</p>
		<p>An older Amazon stepped out ahead of the group and squatted across the small campfire from Xena, saluting her as an equal.</p>
		<p>"I am Aentia commander of this troop. Our scouts reported the smoke of battle," the troops commander explained. "We knew that our queen and her escort were headed here and when they failed to return, I sent word to the regent, then we came to investigate. What has happened here, Champion?"</p>
		<p>Xena winced a little at the thinly veiled accusation in that title. In her usual clear and concise manner, she told the Amazon everything she seen and learned since her arrival that afternoon. The troop leader nodded her understanding, and shuddered a little when Xena made mention of using her legendary interrogation skills on the prisoner.</p>
		<p>That she'd given the prisoner to Tauria as her survivor's right pleased the commander's Amazon sensibilities. She expressed her gratitude to the queen's champion for showing the widowed woman and her mate such respect.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well, if anything has happened to your Queen nothing, not even the nation itself, will stop me from my "rights". This one and her mate gave their all for my love. Their queen or not, it's a debt I can't repay," Xena growled causing even the battle-hardened veteran shudder. "I'll be leaving soon I only waited because I knew you'd be here and she needs care beyond that I gave her."</p>
		<p>"I thank you, Champion," the leader said. "And if you will allow, I will send Tauria and the prisoner back home with a small escort, it's only a day's journey to our borders. If you will also permit, I and the rest of my troop would join you in your pursuit of our Queen to lend you any aid you may require."</p>
		<p>"If you wish," Xena shrugged, knowing the women would not be argued out of it. "Just remember, your Queen is my mate and don't get in my way."</p>
		<p>It was a flat statement not a threat and though the commander started to bristle, she thought better of it knowing the warrior princess, champion, and mate of her queen was fully capable of going on without them. She gave in to her request as a professional courtesy, not need or even want.</p>
		<p>"It will be as you wish, Champion," the leader answered. "We will only be there to assist, the right of vengeance is of course yours, as mate and champion. "</p>
		<p>They shook hands and then Aentia assigned a party of four to take their wounded sister and the body of her mate back to the nation where they would be cared for like the heroes they were.</p>
		<p>There were a few disappointed faces as their commander assigned the youngest of her troop to take them home, but both their leader and the queen's champion explained the honor of escorting the wounded sister and her dead mate home. That by seeing them safely to the regent, and seeing that they were honored as the true heroes they were, the four youngsters were up-holding the highest of Amazon traditions. It seemed to deflect much of the disappointment of not accompanying the legendary Warrior Princess on her honor quest.</p>
		<p>Without any more delay, Xena saddled Argo and with an escort of fifteen Amazons that seemed to melt into the shadows, the worried and anxious Warrior set out to find and win back her beloved and treasured Gabrielle.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 3">
		<p>Gabrielle walked along, the collar chaffing the tender skin of her neck, the rope joining her to the woman in front of her and the one behind her. She felt herself lucky, at least the women she was attached to were Amazons and they had far more stamina than most of the other prisoners.</p>
		<p>She also knew they were lucky that Karcax's men were more interested in the sale value of their female captives than what other benefits they might derive from the large collection of female flesh. Gabrielle had heard all the horror stories about how women were treated at the hands of warriors such as these.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, their warlord had made sure their escort understood the consequences of damaging any of the women. They were more afraid of Karcax and his brutal idea of justice than their need to satisfy their libidos.</p>
		<p>She kept her head down and concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other as the heat of the day beat down on her. Her mind wandered back to her beloved Xena and she speculated on her warrior's reaction when she reached Ciros, and saw the carnage these men had left behind. She cursed the misfortune that had her here and a captive instead of at her lover's side.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle's thoughts went back to the chain of events that had led her to be here, marching in a line of soon to be sold slaves.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>As soon as Xena was out of sight, Gabrielle had turned toward the border of the Amazon Nation and set out--her escort of four scouts setting a faster than normal pace. She hoped that by the time they stopped for the night, she would be too exhausted to dwell on thoughts of her absent warrior.</p>
		<p>Her plan was partially successful. When they did stop for the night, the little bard barely had the strength to eat before she crawled into her bed roll and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
		<p>The only trouble was her sleep was plagued with disturbing visions of all the things that could happen to her or her lover that would keep them from their rendezvous at Ciros.</p>
		<p>Her subconscious tried to wake her up, but because she was so tired, Gabrielle's mind couldn't awaken her until after she had watched Xena die for the fourth time. She woke up quietly weeping, trying desperately not to wake her traveling companions.</p>
		<p>Unable to fall back to sleep, Gabrielle wrapped a blanket around her shoulders and stared deep into the dying flames of their campfire.</p>
		<p>"Please, Artemis, watch over my Xena while we're apart," she prayed quietly. "I know you two don't think much of each other, but she means well and I love her."</p>
		<p>A gentle breeze washed over Gabrielle's face feeling like the warm touch of her lover caressing her cheek. She smiled, knowing in her heart that her patron goddess had given her the promise she wished. Her mind was eased enough for Gabrielle to fall into a light but restful sleep, full of dreams of her warrior and the passion they shared--she could feel Aphrodite's subtle hand in that one.</p>
		<p>The third night, the small party made camp on the Amazon side of the border. Gabrielle sent a runner from the border guards that intercepted them, to announce her impending arrival and that she had safely entered Amazon lands.</p>
		<p>She reached her destination just before sunset the next day and was welcomed by the regent and two of the council members who wanted to begin her briefing right away.</p>
		<p>Pleading exhaustion, Gabrielle managed to get them to agree to hold off on the briefing until the next day. The regent led her queen to her hut then followed her inside, curious why Xena wasn't with her.</p>
		<p>"Alright, Gabrielle, spill it," the regent demanded her queen and long time friend. "Where's the long, tall, and gorgeous warrior babe?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle smiled at her friend, Nikippa, and had been glad when the council had agreed to make her regent at Gabrielle's request after the tragic death of Ephiny and Eponin's disappearance. She knew if she didn't tell her where Xena was, the always curious woman wouldn't give her a moments peace.</p>
		<p>They waited while a young Amazon finished pouring two large mugs of tea, then Gabrielle sat down at the small table with her friend prepared to tell her everything she wanted to know.</p>
		<p>"So come on talk woman, you now you will sooner or later," Nikippa said with a mock glare and failing miserably. "Stop wasting time and dish."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Niki, geez you'd think it was some big catastrophe," the queen began. "I mean Xena doesn't go everywhere with me. We do have time apart once in a while you know."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, yeah so you aren't joined at the hip," the tall thin brunette grumbled, the unquenched flames of her curiosity burning in her light brown, almost golden, eyes. "I know that better than anyone. Sooo, where is my fantasy in leather?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle laughed out loud at her friend's description of her mate. There had been a time when Nikippa's good natured flirting would have made her nervous but she knew now that her friend lusted after her wife only to tease her. Now the only time Gabrielle was worried was when Nikippa didn't mention Xena at least once in a conversation.</p>
		<p>"It's really very simple, Niki," Gabrielle began, smiling at her friends rapt attention. "My wife had something she had to do, and the message from the council said that it was urgent that I get here, so we split up and we are going to meet up again at Ciros, in a week or two."</p>
		<p>"Oh well, I guess I understand," the regent said, a mischievous spark lit up her eyes. "I guess this means I'll have to wait a little longer before I can chase down tall, dark, and scrumptious and make her mine."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle let out a surprised laugh and spewed the mouth full of tea she'd just taken in all over her friend.</p>
		<p>"Great goddess, Gabrielle," the wet Amazon cried out. " I was just kidding, you don't have to spit at me."</p>
		<p>Her friend's reaction caused the small blonde to laugh even harder. She didn't stop until tears were streaming from her sparkling emerald eyes and her sides ached from the exertion.</p>
		<p>"You, my friend, are priceless," Gabrielle gasped as she wiped the tears still leaking from her eyes. "No matter how much I hate being here without my warrior, you know just what to say to make me laugh."</p>
		<p>"I can but try. my Queen." The regent bowed her head slightly toward her friend.</p>
		<p>"Cut that out,Niki. There's nobody here so calling me by name won't violate any ancient protocol. So knock off the "Queen" stuff and let's get down to the serious gossip that's going around."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle knew, like any other leader, that sometimes camp gossip could tell her more things about her people than all the official reports combined.</p>
		<p>She listened to the regent as she caught Gabrielle up on the latest rumors going around. The talk between the two friends went on until the wee hours, when both women were yawning uncontrollably.</p>
		<p>"I'm afraid I must call it a night, Niki," the small woman stretched, much to the delight of her friend as she let her eyes roam appreciatively up and down the queen's compactly muscular, but extremely feminine, body. "It was a long hard trip to get here and my body cries out for rest."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Gabrielle," the regent agreed as she rose from her chair. "I'll let you get to bed and see you tomorrow."</p>
		<p>"Okay, good night, Niki," Gabrielle returned as she too rose from her seat to go to bed. "I'll see you in the morning and oh by the way Niki..."</p>
		<p>"Yes?" she stopped at the door and looked back at her queen expecting to be dismissed.</p>
		<p>"You were right, my beautiful warrior is scrumptious," the queen said with a dreamlike quality in her voice and a sexy smile on her lips.</p>
		<p>"I *knew* it-Damn!" Niki laughed half-heartedly. Knowing how alone her queen felt, she felt a pang of sympathy for the small bard. "I'll see you in the morning and until then, sweet dreams of your beloved, my Queen."</p>
		<p>The regent ducked quickly through the door before Gabrielle could scold her for using the "Q" word. As the regent made her way across the village to he own lonely hut, she found herself looking up at the stars.</p>
		<p>[[Great Artemis,]] the regent prayed silently [[Please let me find a love like the one shared by Gabrielle and her warrior Xena. It is the one thing I would wish for. If it is out there for me, great and merciful Goddess, please show me where to look]]</p>
		<p>A gentle breeze brushed across the lonely regent's cheek and slightly ruffled her long dark hair. She smiled, satisfied with her prayer, and continued on to her heart.</p>
		<p>Unknown to the regent or anyone else this side of Olympus, events had already been set into motion that would answer a lonely woman's prayer and strengthen Xena's ties to the Amazons through her devotion to a certain short, feisty bard and queen.</p>

	<chapter title="Always 4">
		<p>It took nearly a week for Gabrielle to take care of her duties as Queen. One of them being a dispute over territory between an older Amazon couple and a distant cousin of Nikippa's.</p>
		<p>After carefully studying all the facts and other evidence provided by both sides, Gabrielle was forced to rule against the regent's cousin, but she diplomatically lessened the disappointment by locating a similar piece of property that wasn't claimed by anyone and deeding it over to the cousin.</p>
		<p>Nikippa was once again impressed by the bard queen's ability to make everyone, if not happy, at least not as angry. No other ruler she knew of could have handled such a volatile situation in the same manner and would have had to deal with a powerful enemy.</p>
		<p>Instead, Gabrielle had settled the matter so that both parties felt that justice was done and by placing the cousin on that empty piece of land, she had provided her village with a buffer between themselves and the outer territories in the East.</p>
		<p>Once that was done, Niki and the council talked their wandering Queen into sitting in judgment on some other possibly explosive disputes. As with the other cases, the young queen listened attentively to both sides of the dispute and took all the evidence into consideration before rendering her decision.</p>
		<p>Usually, Gabrielle was able to find some kind of reasonable compromise that was agreeable to both sides, but even the ones she couldn't find a mutual agreement on, both parties seemed to feel always that justice had been done and that the Queen's decision had been as fair as the facts allowed.</p>
		<p>After a few days, Gabrielle told her friends that it was time for her to go. No one hated to have her leave more than the regent and she made sure that her queen knew how she felt.</p>
		<p>"Listen, Gabrielle," Niki said when they were alone in the Queen's hut. "You and Xena should really reconsider all this wandering around and come home to us. The people need their queen."</p>
		<p>"Niki, we have discussed this," the bard said firmly, trying to stop the conversation from becoming a heated argument. "Xena is my love and my mate. She is the other half of my soul. Where she goes I go. Besides, the Amazons have you and not only are you a great Amazon, you are also a fine regent. Not once have I heard anyone say a word against you as a warrior or as regent. I know that every time I leave here, I'm leaving my people in the best possible hands."</p>
		<p>"I'm flattered at your confidence in my dubious abilities," Niki began, holding up her hand to forestall the protest her queen was about to launch. "No, let me finish. I'm not speaking as regent now but as a friend and a fellow Amazon, and you, my beloved Queen, are needed here at home. These last few days have proven it. Oh sure, I could have handled those disputes, but not like you. There is no way, this side of Hades, that I would have been able to find the perfect solutions to each case the way you did."</p>
		<p>Niki looked deep into Gabrielle's eyes letting the little blonde see the sincerity of what she was saying. She wanted her queen and friend to know that every word that she spoke was from the heart and not some trivial wish to get out of her own responsibilities.</p>
		<p>"Great Goddess, Gabrielle, can't you see what you accomplished out there?" Niki said, indicating the village and beyond. "Anytime you have to have an outsider settle a dispute there is always someone that feels cheated, someone that feels that they were treated unfairly, but not now.</p>
		<p>Every case you sat in judgment on was not only settled according to law, but for the first time I've ever seen, everybody involved is pleased and satisfied that fairness reigned and justice won out. Some of those cases were heading for some kind of violence, some even as far as clan war or even all out war between villages. But before you were done, not only did the problem get solved peacefully, but you even got long-time enemies together and very possibly averted bloodshed between my clan and some very old and dear friend of mine. Damn woman, you even forged a couple alliances out there that will protect our Nation"</p>
		<p>"Oh really, Niki," Gabrielle humbled by the woman's praise "anyone could have settle those..."</p>
		<p>"No again, my Queen," the regent interrupted, another privilege of friendship. "Only you could see past the rhetoric and the tribal politics to the real matter being discussed, and what it meant to the people involved.</p>
		<p>Your people need that kind of leadership. By the goddess, Gabrielle, the entire Amazon Nation needs that kind of compassionate, caring leadership. And you can believe me that word of your manner of handling your people's needs and cares has already begun spreading all over the nation. We Amazons are an observant people, Gabrielle, and we all recognize greatness when we see. Come back to us soon, Gabrielle. Your people need and deserve their true Queen and not a pale imitation like me."</p>
		<p>Spent by her emotional out burst, and a little embarrassed by her uncharacteristic open display of her own inner thoughts, Nikippa stood and swiftly left the Queen's hut before the stunned bard could say a word.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle watched wide-eyed and slack-jawed as her friend disappeared through the door. In a way she was glad Niki left because the great bard wasn't sure she'd be able to find the words to answer her friend's declaration and she really needed time alone to try to assimilate what her friend had just told her.</p>
		<p>The only person that had ever spoke to her like this was Xena; it was one of the things that Gabrielle loved about her stoic warrior princess. She always told the bard that she was better than she gave herself credit for, and said it like she was talking to an equal. Xena never talked down to her or treated her like she was a kid. Well, not any more anyway.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle smiled as she pictured her tall dark formidable lover and how she'd often told Gabrielle almost the exact same thing only a few weeks ago after spending a night at an inn where Gabrielle had paid for their room by telling stories in the public room.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle also remembered that Xena had been talking about maybe settling down and making themselves a home where they would be able to come back from their various travels and safely rest and recuperate. Her tall mysterious lover had even mentioned making their home among the Amazons, because as she put it living there wouldn't be as bad as one of their home villages. At least among the Amazons, she would be free to kiss her lover in public and their marriage would be recognized.</p>
		<p>"At least no Amazon's going to tell me I need a man in my life to make me complete," Gabrielle snorted to herself. She moved reluctantly around the hut gathering her belongings as she got ready to leave at first light to meet her soulmate and lover at a river town called Ciros.</p>
		<p>"Maybe I'll talk to Xena about this. I mean I never looked at the way Niki put it. I'll be curious to see what she has to say."</p>
		<p>Her things packed and ready to go, Gabrielle went to her bed and as she blew out the last candle, her mind was whirling with thoughts of her and her mate making their home with her people interspersed with visions of her reunion with her passionate warrior. A happy smirk curled the ends of the bards lips as she surrendered herself to the arms of Morpheus and dreams of passion and deep undying love.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The next morning found an anxious Gabrielle nervously pacing, waiting to leave. She'd have already left, but Nikippa insisted on her having an escort. Gabrielle had tried to talk her friend out of it, but the regent wouldn't be swayed.</p>
		<p>So, here she was. Waiting while Niki sorted through the volunteers to find the prefect escort to take the Queen to Ciros and wait until her mate joined them. At which time the Amazons would return home and leave their beloved queen in the care of her champion.</p>
		<p>At first Niki wanted to assign an entire company of Amazons to escort her to the port town, but she had finally compromised with Gabrielle and instead of a full company she would be escorted as far as the border by a troupe of scouts (a kind of Amazon special forces), then from the border to Ciros by four of the least belligerent of the younger scouts.</p>
		<p>Niki convinced Gabrielle to take the younger scouts on to Ciros with her, to give them some experience with getting along in an outsiders town. This way they had Gabrielle to watch over them, and save them from making any major mistakes.</p>
		<p>Like killing a man for looking at their legs or whatever part of the anatomy they found appealing.</p>
		<p>So under the supervision of a battle-scarred veteran of many border wars named Aentia and her troop of scouts, Gabrielle began her short journey to the border. After that, it was a three day ride to Ciros.</p>
		<p>One of the gifts the Amazons had insisted their Queen take was a horse. After much looking, and many test rides, Gabrielle chose her mount.</p>
		<p>Much to the dismay of Niki, the council, and the Amazon stable master, Gabrielle picked out a scruffy looking chestnut mountain pony with black mane and tail.</p>
		<p>For some reason, the two of them clicked at first sight and while the others tried to steer her toward the tall proud Arabians or similar breeds, Gabrielle kept feeling herself drawn to the shaggy little horse.</p>
		<p>She named her new friend Ate, this made the stable master laugh, Ate was the Goddess of delusion and the master of horses thought that anyone that would choose the hard headed little horse had to be delusional.</p>
		<p>"You know, Niki, it's just like we were meant to find each other," Gabrielle said, trying to explain her choice to her friend while sneaking the little horse an apple. "I mean, those proud prancing beautiful animals you guys tried to get me to choose would be fine for Xena or you or one of the other warriors, but not me. I don't know if it's just because we're both short and underestimated or if it's that I always go for the underdog but she's perfect for me and I think Ata's a lot more horse than any of you give her credit for. Besides that, if I fall off this one I won't get hurt as bad."</p>
		<p>Both women laughed heartily at the bard's self-depreciating humor at her lack of riding skills; even the little horse snorted.</p>
		<p>"That will be enough from you, young lady," she scolded. "Keep it up and I won't bring you any more apples."</p>
		<p>As if she understood the threat and wanted to make it up to her new mistress, the horse began nuzzling Gabrielle, receiving a big hug and an ear scratch that was straight from the Elysian fields for her gestures.</p>
		<p>The trip to the border was uneventful and to the delight of her escort and their commander, Gabrielle kept them entertained by telling them stories every night. Every one of the normally serious scouts were like little kids, crowding around the campfire each night to hear their bard Queen regale them with her tales of the adventures of Xena the Warrior Princess and her ever-faithful companion, Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>To Gabrielle, the look of wonder and excitement on the faces of her audience was like water to a man dying of thirst. It fed and sustained her heart and soul almost as much as her warrior did.</p>
		<p>It was a melancholy good-bye when the party reached the border and the two groups went their separate ways. Even the battle-hardened Aentia got a lump in her throat as she bid her queen a good journey.</p>
		<p>"I won't say good-bye, my Queen," the older woman said as she placed her fist over her heart and bowed slightly. "I only say fare thee well until we meet again."</p>
		<p>"I hope it's soon, Aentia." Gabrielle said and sniffed, fighting the tears that threatened to fall any second. "I have a feeling I will see you and your troop again, sooner than either of us think."</p>
		<p>Both women shivered a little at this prophetic comment, then they turned and joined their different traveling parties.</p>
		<p>With a final wave, the groups separated. Aentia continuing her assigned patrol, and Gabrielle and her four escorts toward the raucous, wide open, trading town of Ciros.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 5">
		<p>The short ride to Ciros was made even easier by the lighthearted and excited banter between the bard and her escort.</p>
		<p>Two of the young women had only been joined for two moons, and spent most of their time holding hands and whispering lover's secrets to each other.</p>
		<p>The couple, Kala and Tauria, made Gabrielle smile, reminding her of the first days after she and her warrior had finally confessed their love for each other.</p>
		<p>The unbridled passion of those days brought a slight blush to the queen's face and gave rise to memories of how gentle and loving Xena was when she first took her young, inexperienced, lover to her bed.</p>
		<p>Then she remembered how brazen and insatiable she had been once she'd been shown the joys of the new physical relationship with her warrior.</p>
		<p>In a way, she envied the two youngsters for the newness of their love, and how they'd grown up in a society that accepted their love as natural and normal.</p>
		<p>The other two scouts were so different that Gabrielle thought of them as day and night.</p>
		<p>Mallika was a tall muscular blonde woman. She was boisterous and friendly with a lyrical laugh that seemed to fill the air, and a mischievous sparkle in her hazel eyes. Life was never boring around Mallika (or Mal to her friends). She was the master of the practical joke and would laugh as hard at a joke pulled on her as on one pulled on someone else.</p>
		<p>Her companion was Rapa, a thin brown-haired, willowy-figured woman. She was always serious and introspective. Her hard, cold, dark brown, almost black, eyes showed all that she'd tolerate no interference.</p>
		<p>The one person was able to even get her to get an amused smirk on her thin lips was her only friend Mallika.</p>
		<p>No one, not even the two women themselves, could explain why the two even tolerated each others presence, much less why they were close, inseparable friends and constant companions-but they were.</p>
		<p>The small group made short work of the journey to Ciros, and by noon of the second day they were entering the main gates of the bustling town. After asking one of the city guards for directions, the four travelers headed for the Hag's Head Inn.</p>
		<p>It wasn't the most inviting place Gabrielle had ever stayed in, but the beds were soft and the bedding was clean. Finding the inn keeper, a rotund little bald man named Abro, the bard managed to secure two rooms for her and her companions. After seeing to their horses and taking their belongings to their rooms, the four younger Amazons were anxious to see what the town had to offer.</p>
		<p>It took some convincing but they finally got their queen to accompany them on a short tour of the city, focusing on the market in the square in the center of town.</p>
		<p>Although all four women had seen combat as scouts, they had never been out of Amazon territory, and had never seen an "outsider" settlement. They were anxious and more than a little frightened to be mingling with so many different people, especially so many men.</p>
		<p>Before their little excursion was called off and Gabrielle had gotten them back to their rooms, the news that there were Amazons in town was well circulated. Mostly because Gabrielle had been forced to step in and stop the women from killing someone twice in less than one candlemark.</p>
		<p>The first time, Tauria thought some merchant was paying to much attention to her Kala's well displayed anatomy, and was about to slit the hapless man's throat when her queen stepped into the shop and commanded her to stop.</p>
		<p>"What did you think you were doing Kala?" Gabrielle scolded the young warrior once they were outside. "Do you have any idea what would have happened if you had killed that man?"</p>
		<p>"But, your Highness, he was insulting my wife!" Kala pleaded. "He was ogling her...her body if that had been an Amazon..."</p>
		<p>"That's just it, " Gabrielle responded. "He isn't an Amazon and he couldn't help but stare at her. By the gods girl, she's beautiful, don't you see that? These people don't know or understand Amazon customs. To them it's alright to ogle each other's wives. It's even considered a compliment by some..."</p>
		<p>The queen's lecture on outsider customs was interrupted by someone yelling for help and the sound of clashing steel.</p>
		<p>"Oh please tell me it's not one of mine," she moaned as she ran toward the sounds of a fight. "What's going on?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle tried to push her way through the crowd that had gathered around the combatants.</p>
		<p>"Can you believe that idiot?" A man said to his neighbor. "That woman's obviously a warrior. Why would Derka be so stupid and challenge her, she'll kill him before anyone can even lay a bet on the fight?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle heard the entire conversation and she knew that once she was through the crowd it would either be Rapa or Mallika, probably killing someone.</p>
		<p>Sure enough when she pushed past the last person and could see, a groan escaped her throat at the sight that greeted her.</p>
		<p>In the center of the roughly formed circle was a frightened young man in light armor, holding a short sword (not very well), facing a confidently smiling Rapa, who was holding a long razor sharp dagger in each hand. She was slowly circling the young man the feral smirk on her lips that made even Gabrielle shiver. Stalking her prey, looking for the final opening that would end the fight and leave the young man dead in the dusty city street.</p>
		<p>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;She's enjoying this too much&amp;lt;&amp;gt; Gabrielle thought to herself &amp;lt;&amp;gt;How do I keep her from cutting this arrogant young fool to pieces&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p>
		<p>The bard did the only thing she could think of and counting on Rapa's ingrained training and obedience to Amazon law, Gabrielle stepped in between the man and his attacker. Gabrielle couldn't help but notice that he was sporting several deep cuts over his body.</p>
		<p>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;Oh Goddess, she has been just playing with him like a cat with a mouse&amp;lt;&amp;gt;she thought, hoping her plan would work &amp;lt;&amp;gt;I hope she recognizes me before she hacks me to pieces with him&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p>
		<p>"RAPA!!" Gabrielle commanded in her loudest voice short of yelling. "Stop this nonsense right now."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Recognizing her queen and hearing the command, Rapa instantly sheathed her daggers and dropped to one knee in front of Gabrielle, with her fist over her heart in salute.</p>
		<p>"By your command, Highness," the dark Amazon said meekly, knowing she was in deep trouble.</p>
		<p>According to Amazon law she had committed treason by disobeying a royal command and could be summarily executed if her queen wished.</p>
		<p>"I had expected more from you, Rapa." The bard sighed. "What is the meaning of this?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle knew that by acting disappointed in this warrior, she was punishing her far worse than anyone would know.</p>
		<p>"The man questioned my right to bear a warrior's arms," Rapa began her, voice nearly breaking, as was her heart, believing she'd disappointed the small blonde before her. "True honor forbade me from turning aside his challenge."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle was stunned, she found it hard to believe that in this day and age someone could be that small minded and stupid. Surely no one in their right mind would challenge an Amazon's right to carry weapons--it was unthinkable.</p>
		<p>"Is what she says true?" Gabrielle asked, turning to the wounded man, flinching a little at the sight of the several deep cuts Rapa had given him. "Did you question her honor?"</p>
		<p>When the man didn't answer she turned her compelling emerald eyes on the crowd around the combatants.</p>
		<p>"Aye, he sure did," said a voice from the crowd.</p>
		<p>When she looked toward the voice Gabrielle saw a short, thin, weather-beaten old man. He gave her a wide, nearly toothless grin.</p>
		<p>"The lady weren't doin' nothin' but havin' an ale," the old man continued. "That young fool, Derka, kept runnin' off at the mouth sayin' as how no woman could be a warrior, an that they shouldn't ought ta be allowed ta carry a warrior's weapons.</p>
		<p>Yer girl there tried ta get away but the idgit kept at her. She done the right thing and if ya' be who I think ya' are don't be punishin' the youngun too hard. Seems ta me she done you and the Nation proud with her skills and restraint. I'da kilt the dumb pup."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, sir for your honesty," Gabrielle said to the old man and extended her hand to him. "And for defending my young hothead here. I suppose I'll have to let her off the hook."</p>
		<p>She gave the man a 1000 watt smile and held out her hand in greeting. Rapa looked up at him with gratitude and curiosity. She couldn't understand why an outsider would come to her defense, especially a man. This was a question she would ask he queen later.</p>
		<p>"Tis an honor an a privilege, yer highness," the man said, bowing low and kissing the knuckle respectfully then released it instantly. "But it weren't nothin', twas only lookin' out for what's fair, and sides I couldn't stand ta see a pretty young thing like her getin' trouble she didn't deserve."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle looked down at Rapa and was barely able to stifle a laugh when she saw the young warrior blushing bright red at the old man's comment.</p>
		<p>"Well then, kind sir," Gabrielle continued, being her charming self. "Would you then please join my friends and myself for dinner tonight at the Hag's Head Inn? We would be most grateful to have such a fine, and honorable gentleman as our guest. Please, I insist."</p>
		<p>"Ah a good meal and such pretty company," he said, Gabrielle could see the ghost of the proud, and fine young man he'd been and the ageless good-natured twinkle in his blue eyes. "A man would be a fool ta turn down such an offer. You bet, your highness. I'll be there round supper time."</p>
		<p>Later that night, all five were enjoying the old man's company, as he regaled the women with stories, and jokes from his many years as a boatman, plying his trade up and down the many rivers and coastal towns.</p>
		<p>The man told them his name, Braxsis, and that he'd come to this town to retire, and open up a small shop catering to the river trade. According to him, he was doing quite well because of his many connections still on the waters.</p>
		<p>Braxsis had the five women blushing and laughing the entire visit and Gabrielle decided she liked this man very much, but there was something about him that she just couldn't shake off, and when he revealed his name alarms went off in her brain, but she couldn't think of why.</p>
		<p>Aside from being personable, and truly charming in a rough, backwoods kind of way, he had a way of speaking that made you feel as if you were the only person in the room, and it was clear to Gabrielle that all of her Amazons were quite taken with him.</p>
		<p>As much as she was enjoying the company, Gabrielle was beginning to feel the day she'd spent on the trail, and to be honest she wanted to get away from this man so she could wrack her brains to recall what it was that bothered her when she'd learned his name.</p>
		<p>"Oh my," Gabrielle said as she yawned and stretched causing two vertebra to pop loudly back into line. "I'm afraid I'm getting too old for these late night festivities. I think it's time to turn in."</p>
		<p>She could read the disappointment clearly on the faces of her young companions, and she felt bad for ending their fun but she also knew that something wasn't right here, and until she knew exactly what was bothering her, she wanted both herself and her young friends well rested, and ready for anything.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry Braxis, but it is well past time for my party and I to retire." The queen stood and offered her hand to their guest that rose with the others. "I'm sure we will be able to get together again before we take our leave of the city. I'm anxious to see your shop and browse. I'm always looking for anything that could prove useful."</p>
		<p>She couldn't help but notice the strange look that crossed the man's face for a heartbeat then his congenial riverman's mask was firmly back in place.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, my lady," Braxis said as he kissed her offered hand "but I'll be headin' out come sunup. I've got business to attend inland, but feel free ta visit my shop. I'll tell my helper ta give ya' the royal treatment but you might wait and go tour the countryside tomorrow there be some intrerestin' sights there."</p>
		<p>"Why thank you," the suspicious bard answered, curious as to his business inland might be and what he meant by his strange suggestion. "Then I will say until we meet again."</p>
		<p>With a wave, the man walked off. Gabrielle watched him leave with narrowed eyes. Spending so much time in the company of her warrior had taught her to be aware of her surroundings, and observant of others, and it struck her that the man didn't walk like a retired boatman.</p>
		<p>No, the last time she'd seen a walk like that was an older warlord friend of Xena's. He'd received a horrible wound to his spine and while he fully healed he was left with a slight limp, and in almost constant pain.</p>
		<p>Then the light went on in her head. When she'd seen the old warlord he hadn't seen her, in fact, she had only seen him once.</p>
		<p>She was sick, and Xena had insisted she stay in bed, while she met her friend in the courtyard of the inn they were at that was situated just below the window of her room. Gabrielle remembered how jealous she'd felt listening to the two of them laugh and joke just below her open window, and when she heard their good-byes how she rushed to the window to get a look at him, but all she saw was the old friend of her wife walking out the gate.</p>
		<p>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;What was his name?&amp;lt;&amp;gt; she pondered a little confused as to why he seemed so important to her here and now &amp;lt;&amp;gt;Abraxis, that was his name.&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p>
		<p>"That's it!" The bard exclaimed getting curious looks from her companions. "That's who he is or was!"</p>
		<p>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;I think he knows who I am&amp;lt;&amp;gt; she reflected, remembering that Xena told her she'd told Abraxis all about their relationship &amp;lt;&amp;gt;I wonder why he didn't rec...&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p>
		<p>"He did recognize me," Gabrielle whispered to herself, as she and the four Amazons went up the stairs that led to their rooms. "He was trying to be subtle, and I'm just too dense. He was trying to warn me to get out of here tomorrow!"</p>
		<p>Gone suddenly was Gabrielle, bard and friend and in her place was Gabrielle, Queen and commander.</p>
		<p>"Kala, Tauria, I want you to get your things and join us in our room for tonight," their queen commanded. "I want everything packed and ready to leave in the morning. I want to be gone before the sun has risen far above the horizon."</p>
		<p>"Yes, my queen," was all the four Amazons said, and hurried to follow their queen's orders, never once asking why.</p>
		<p>Before she lay down on the pallet she'd made (as queen Gabrielle felt it unfair to expect her subjects to sleep on the floor, while she was in a nice comfortable bed), Gabrielle made sure the four warriors had set up a watch and had put a chair under the doorknob.</p>
		<p>She also made sure that she would be wakened as soon as the eastern sky was light enough to see by.</p>
		<p>Having taken her precautions, the tired bard pulled up her covers, and attempted to sleep.</p>
		<p>It took her awhile for the worried bard to fall asleep, her mind was going over the preparations she'd made for their departure over and over again looking for any flaw or error she might have made that could possibly come back and get them later when they least expected it.</p>
		<p>Finally exhaustion conquered worry and Gabrielle surrendered to the sweet temptation of sleep. She rested knowing that she had done everything possible to assure their quick and quiet withdrawal from the city. Every problem she could think of was covered, save one.</p>
		<p>They were running out of time faster than anyone knew...it was already too late.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 6">
		<p>Gabrielle's eyes fluttered open, she lay there on her pallet getting her bearings, and trying to figure out what had woke her up. She could see Rapa looking out the window towards the forest in the dim predawn light.</p>
		<p>"Rapa," the still sleepy bard whispered. "What's wrong? What do you see?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not sure your Highness," the dark thin warrior answered, "it looks like a large group of soldiers has just come out of the tree line, and they're heading this way, but they're coming in very quietly, and I can't see why. They have no banners, or anything to announce who they are."</p>
		<p>"Oh no," the now wide awake queen groaned. "We're too late, this is what Braxis was saying last night, but when he said in the morning, I thought we had more time."</p>
		<p>She quickly swallowed back the panic she felt rising from her stomach, looking up at the lookout, trying to formulate her next course of action, when that decision was taken out of her hands.</p>
		<p>"My Queen!" The scout at the window hissed loudly, "that army has cut us off from the Forest, and it looks like a huge fire over at the docks."</p>
		<p>"Wake your sisters, NOW!" Gabrielle ordered as she leapt from her bedding, began dressing, and hunting for her weapons. "Move it Amazons, we're under attack, and we need to reach the city gates before they close us out here."</p>
		<p>The other Amazons were up, dressed, and were soon following their queen down the back stairs of the inn.</p>
		<p>"Mallika, you take Tauria and Kala and release the horses, no sense making it easy for them." The three warriors followed her orders without comment as she continued, "Rapa, you and I must go back and at least try to warn the other guests and the innkeeper before we leave."</p>
		<p>"My Queen" the tall thin Amazon called out as she followed her queen into the still unaware inn. "You should hurry and get behind the walls, we will follow as soon as we have carried out your orders. Please, your Highness, the regent would expect us to insist."</p>
		<p>"Rapa," Gabrielle said over her shoulder without stopping. "what kind of queen would I be if every time there was danger I ran and hid, while my people stayed and fought. No, we'll do this together, and then we will all make a run for the city walls."</p>
		<p>With a look of total adoration, the dark woman followed her Queen into the inn, knowing in her heart, she would gladly follow the short blonde in to Tartarus itself, without question. Before this only her friend Mallika had that distinction, now there was another she would gladly lay down her life for.</p>
		<p>The two of them ran into the main room yelling at the top of their lungs.</p>
		<p>"Everybody up!" they yelled in unison "there is an attack!" After the third yell the innkeeper came running out of the kitchen, his face and clothing covered in flour.</p>
		<p>"What's all this noise woman!" the stocky man demanded of the two obviously demented women "Why are you trying to do? Ruin me by waking up all my other guests!"</p>
		<p>"We're trying to save their lives." Gabrielle yelled into the man's face "There's an unknown, unannounced army sneaking up on the city from the forest, and there's smoke coming from the docks, you figure it out! Come on, Rapa, let's get the others and get into the city. Maybe those people would appreciate our help."</p>
		<p>"As you wish, my Queen," her escort returned with a bow, and an amused smirk at her feisty Queen's wit.</p>
		<p>"What in Hades name does she mean "Queen?" the innkeeper asked in surprise.</p>
		<p>But the woman in question was already out the door. Then it hit him, unannounced army, docks on fire, Queen!</p>
		<p>"Everybody up!" the man began yelling as he ran through his inn pounding on the doors and walls "we're under attack!"</p>
		<p>A sly smile crept across Rapa's lips when she heard the man's calls of alarm as she and her queen returned to the courtyard for the other three in their party.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle cocked her head and listened for a moment.</p>
		<p>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;Where's the alarm?&amp;lt;&amp;gt; she wondered &amp;lt;&amp;gt;I can already hear them, why isn't there an alarm?&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p>
		<p>"I don't like this," Gabrielle muttered then turned to her companions "Get into the city and look for the city guard or the alarm bell. Something's not right here and our best defense is inside those city walls. Now, move it ladies we're no longer just travelers now, we're Amazon warriors, so act like it, my scouts!"</p>
		<p>When the five women entered, they split up. Kala, ran directly to where she had seen a guard post and alarm bell the day before. When she got there the question of no alarm was answered, both guards were dead, their throats slit.</p>
		<p>There was blood everywhere and for a second Kala froze, she had seen dead before on the field of battle, but she'd never seen anyone murdered before and it bothered her.</p>
		<p>She stared at the bodies for a few minutes, then remembered her Queen's instructions. The young warrior knew she must ruin the surprise of the attack, so as her Queen wanted, Kala found the rope leading to the large alarm bell and pulled it with everything she had.</p>
		<p>All Tartarus broke loose as the huge bell rang out the warning in a loud clear voice. The young scout stayed at her post until the sounds of battle grew close, then she hurried out to join the fight and find her Queen.</p>
		<p>She took off at a run to where she'd last seen Gabrielle, and her mate. When she turned a corner she found herself in the middle of about fifteen men; all armed, and not the city guard. Knowing from the smoke stained skin and clothes and the smell of burning wood that surrounded them, that this was part of the enemy force that had set fire to the docks.</p>
		<p>Kala pulled her sword and dagger and fell back into a defensive stance. It was obvious that she was facing insurmountable odds, but determined to take as many of the enemy with her as she could, the young Amazon scout whispered a prayer to Artemis for strength, and to watch over her beloved, then charged the men that had her surrounded.</p>
		<p>The young woman's ferocious attack took the men by surprise and before they could react, three of their number were on the dusty street dead or dying.</p>
		<p>The well-trained warrior was a whirlwind of kicks, razor sharp steel, and death, as she continued to assault the soldiers. She was eventually forced by fatigue and several serious wounds to stop for a moment.</p>
		<p>It was then that a huge man, his skin blackened by smoke, with streaks of blood, that ran from several minor, but painful, wounds inflicted by the small, fierce woman, stepped up. Using his superior bulk and strength to batter down the exhausted woman's defenses. The two warriors looked at each other for a heartbeat, connecting on a level that only truly respected opponents knew, acknowledging their roles as victor and defeated.</p>
		<p>The huge warrior looked deep into the Amazon's clear brown eyes and saw no fear there, he raised his sword slightly in a salute to a fellow warrior, then ran his massive broadsword all the way through her small body.</p>
		<p>The wound was mortal but death was not immediate, and as the rest of the jackals that dared to call themselves warriors closed to take her down like a wounded animal, Kala heard a familiar voice screaming, "NO!"</p>
		<p>She turned toward the sound and the last thing the young Amazon scout saw as she went down for the last time was the face of her lover frozen in horror.</p>
		<p>With her last breath she called out to her mate.</p>
		<p>"Good-bye love," the dying woman gasped. "I will wait for you on the other side."</p>
		<p>With that, Kala fell to the ground. What happened to her now no longer mattered...Kala was gone.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 7">
		<p>Once Gabrielle heard Kala ringing the alarm, she decided that the next order of business was to gather the non-combatants and get them to some place relatively safe.</p>
		<p>Mallika located a storage shed in an out of the way alley and after seeing there was plenty of room and it was fairly secure (three of the four walls were stone), she and Rapa began gathering all the children and other non-combatants and sending them to the temporary shelter.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle sent a worried Tauria to look for her mate, Kala and stayed to help people into the shed and set up a way to protect it.</p>
		<p>Soon after Tauria had left her Queen, the alarm bell stopped. Fearing for her friend and lover, the young Amazon drew her sword and long dagger, and began running in the direction she'd seen Kala disappear earlier. She was turning down a narrow street when she heard the sounds of clashing steel and ran toward the sound, knowing her mate was in trouble.</p>
		<p>Tauria reached the scene of the battle just in time to see a huge warrior run the light of her life through the middle with a big broadsword. He jerked the five feet of cold steel out of Tauria's lover and stepped away.</p>
		<p>Kala turned her head and saw her mate standing behind her attackers. Kala smiled, oblivious to the blood streaming from her mouth and stomach and locked eyes with Tauria.</p>
		<p>The last thing Tauria saw was her lover telling her good-bye, then the small, courageous Amazon scout went down under several attackers.</p>
		<p>At the sight of her lover and mate going down, Tauria decided to join her beloved in death, but only after taking her revenge on the ones responsible for Kala's death. The young enraged scout let out a shrill eardrum-shattering war cry and leapt to fight the group of soldiers that had just killed her mate.</p>
		<p>The large warrior that ran Kala through saw his companions attacking the brave young Amazon that he'd already defeated, and was appalled at their lack of respect for the game little female. He felt disgust and loathing both at himself for taking such a noble soul, and at his comrades for their unnecessary mutilation of the pretty woman. When he saw the other young female and witnessed the grief and anguish in her eyes at the fall of the little one, he almost instantly recognized the look in her eyes.</p>
		<p>The warrior known as Kurkan, had been a mercenary since his mis-spent youth and had lost his idealistic innocence early. Many times he had sold his sword to some rather unscrupulous leaders. He'd never before questioned his calling or the actions he'd used in the service of his employers. After witnessing the actions of the others in Karcax's army, Kurkan knew it was time for a change.</p>
		<p>The aging mercenary locked eyes with the grief stricken mate of the little warrior and raised his massive sword in salute and walked away from the scene shoulders slumped in shame. He heard the woman's war cry and turned his back on the group of men and didn't look back. As he heard the clash of steel and the cries of the men dying under her raging grief, Kurkan shook his head sadly and walked out of the city leaving his former comrades to fend for themselves, never to return.</p>
		<p>As the last of her mate's attackers fell from the end of her sword, Tauria looked up in time to see another larger group of the marauders come around the far corner.</p>
		<p>Holding her weapons ready, and crouched in a defensive position, the young scout began backing toward the way she'd come.</p>
		<p>Knowing her Queen and comrades would need her, Tauria put aside her death wish and with a silent promise to her love to return her to Amazon lands, the young scout began a running battle with the new group of attackers. She knew that she must return to her Queen's side, but she was determined that a lot fewer of the enemy would be following when she got there. The young scout did her teachers proud that day and several of the marauders went to meet Hades but there were just too many.</p>
		<p>Suffering from several deep cuts and slashes along with becoming steadily weaker from blood loss, Tauria did her best to slow down her opponents. As she came into sight of her Queen and the two remaining Amazon scouts, the last three of the attackers came at her at once, and even though she killed all three of them the momentum of their charge carried the men on into her and they all crashed to the hard ground.</p>
		<p>Tauria's head struck a rock so hard she saw stars and then everything went black. She woke once and could here the sounds of heavy fighting all around her and felt the overwhelming weight of the dead men laying on top of her.</p>
		<p>Tauria tried to move, but as soon as she did she felt nauseous and her head spun then she passed out again. The next time she woke she could hear Gabrielle surrender, but as before the young Amazon became dizzy as soon as she tried to move and the black velvet cacoon of unconsciousness enveloped her.</p>
		<p>When she finally came to Tauria was being tended to by the Queen's champion, and the battle was over.</p>
		<p>It was easy to gather from her surroundings and the champions questions that the Queen and her two friends were missing. The only thing she was able to do was tell the champion everything she could remember and answer all the questions as best as her addled mind allowed.</p>
		<p>Tauria wept silent tears as she told of her beloved Kala's brave final stand and how she died with honor (small comfort to her widow at the moment). Xena praised the young scout for her courage and promised to avenge her mate's death. She kept her stoic warrior's mask in place not wanting the injured girl to see how worried she truly was.</p>
		<p>"You rest yourself young warrior," Xena told her patient softly. "You have fought well and lost much, you have done the nation proud and I will make it my duty to see that the tales of your mate's last battle and your brave fight are told around camp fires for generations."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Champion," was all the severely injured woman could say barely above a whisper, as she more passed out than fell asleep.</p>
		<p>"Sleep well, little one," Xena whispered to the unconscious warrior. "Your battle is finished...mine has just begun."</p>
		<p>With that, the dark warrior rose and lost herself in the smoking ruins of the city. Her rage almost a living thing coming to life inside her and demanding payment for the damages done her lover and her friends.</p>
		<p>Most importantly, she had to find her Queen and mate before she suffered too much at the hands of her captors.</p>
		<p>"If they've harmed her," the ex-warlord growled, "I swear by all the gods I will hunt down and destroy everyone that was here all the way up to that bastard Karcax himself."</p>
		<p>The enraged warrior stalked off into the city determined to find some hint of where the enemy had taken her beloved Gabrielle, even if she had to kill every living thing from here to the sea.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 8">
		<p>Gabrielle heard the sounds of a battle approaching and saw the worst of her fears come to life. One of her Amazons was fighting bravely against impossible odds, she could see the many wounds covering the young warrior and the blood flowing freely from the woman's injuries.</p>
		<p>It was obvious to Gabrielle that the woman was in bad shape and about to go down, but when she started to go to the young woman's aid Gabrielle, felt a hand grab her upper arm holding her fast. She turned and looked into the almost black eyes of Rapa.</p>
		<p>"Let me go help her," Gabrielle hissed, angry at being held back.</p>
		<p>"Would you belittle a warrior's sacrifice my Queen?" The dark scout asked calmly. "She and her mate have given their all in service of their Queen, don't make their deaths meaningless, please."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle stopped and realized what she was being told, it sank in that not only was Tauria about to die defending her, but her mate, little Kala, was probably dead already.</p>
		<p>Tears began falling from the Queen's dark green eyes, but she held her ground even when she saw the brave woman taken down by three large men and fail to rise.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle felt grief tear at her heart but refused to belittle the efforts of her loyal subjects. She vowed silently that if she got through this alive, she'd make sure that everyone, especially her fellow Amazons, would hear of the bravery and sacrifice of the two Amazon scouts.</p>
		<p>The fighting in the city slowly worked it's way through the city streets heading in the direction of the three self appointed guardians of the city's non-combatants.</p>
		<p>Several times, the three women held off groups of marauders that were trying to get to the innocents hiding in the shed. Still, the three fought on, defending the people who the day before had treated them as freaks of nature.</p>
		<p>Eventually, the rest of the city fell to the invaders leaving only Gabrielle and her two Amazon escorts standing against an army. Sensing inevitable defeat, Gabrielle began taking precautions to save her two loyal scouts and herself unnecessary problem.</p>
		<p>"Alright, I need you two to listen to me and do as I say," Gabrielle hissed, hoping the two proud women wouldn't put up too much of an argument. "I want you to remove everything on you that shows that you are Amazon."</p>
		<p>"But, your Highness," Rapa began, "that would be dishonorable."</p>
		<p>"Is it more honorable to die and leave your sister Amazons in danger?" Gabrielle whispered, her eyes drilling into the over-sensitive scout. "I am your Queen and I say we must hide our Amazon identity in order to live long enough to help these weaker women and children."</p>
		<p>Neither woman could argue with the bard's logic and reluctantly removed all the items they had that would proclaim them to be Amazon. Gabrielle had them put everything in a leather pouch and, along with her intricately carved staff, she hid them in a hastily hollowed out section of the shed wall, then replaced the large rock that fit over the hole.</p>
		<p>Then she put a mark on the stone that her warrior would recognise just in case Gabrielle wasn't able to retrieve the items herself.</p>
		<p>That done, the three warriors turned to face their attackers, it wasn't long before they were so completely out numbered, that it was obvious to everyone that defeat was impossible to avoid.</p>
		<p>When all three women were forced back against the shed wall, the enemy stopped advancing. The men parted and made room for a tall, well-built man wearing brightly polished bronze armor and riding a huge coal black war-horse to ride through.</p>
		<p>He looked down at the three exhausted women and pointed his gleaming sword at them. looking at them like he would a small rabbit that had suddenly stood up and fought not to be his dinner.</p>
		<p>"You are brave, ladies, but it is hopeless," the man's booming voice filled the air. "Lay down your weapons and you and those you protect will be taken alive. I swear it in the name of Karcax"</p>
		<p>"And if we don't?" Gabrielle asked with far more defiance than she felt.</p>
		<p>"Then you and all the others die," he said calmly. "It's nothing to me, your choice."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle looked at her two companions and saw how exhausted they were, then she thought of the women and children she was defending. She knew they counted on her to keep them alive, and without another word she threw down her sais at the warlord's horse's feet. Her two comrades followed their Queen's example and their weapons joined hers on the ground.</p>
		<p>The warlord's men rushed forward and quickly bound their hands behind their backs.</p>
		<p>The three women were chained and their collars linked separately from the other prisoners to keep them from encouraging the others to escape or create some other problems for their captors. Within less than a day, the warlord was ready to move on and the group of new slaves were herded from the city to their fates elsewhere.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>A tear fell from Gabrielle's eye as she remembered the last two days and the humiliating things she'd endured in order to save the lives of the small children. As with other men as cruel as slavers these were ready to murder every child under 6. To them it was a simple business decision, to Gabrielle it was an abomination.</p>
		<p>In order to save the children she had offered the greatest sacrifice, herself. Some of the men had taken her up on her offer and had begun to closely examine their prize over the outraged cries by Rapa and Mallika. A senior officer came to check out what was causing the commotion, and put an immediate halt to Gabrielle's violation.</p>
		<p>When he learned the reason his men were disobeying orders he ordered her flogged for tempting his men,but he also ordered the children spared.</p>
		<p>She had won her quest but the bard was under no illusion that her situation wasn't going to get a lot worse if help didn't arrive soon. She breathed a silent prayer to Artemis that her note would be found where the trails split and help was coming.</p>
		<p>As night fell, the rest of the prisoners were herded into a hastily erected rope corral and left. Gabrielle and her two Amazons were taken to a supply wagon and chained to the wheels.</p>
		<p>The leers of their captors had been getting bolder since the groups had split up the day before. The main body of the army had turned inland and the group that had the future slaves continued on, following the river toward a port where the soldiers would be able to sell their captives with little worry about the law.</p>
		<p>It was fully dark when their captors brought Gabrielle and her two companions each a bowl of a thick gruel. All three women ate the foul tasting stuff knowing they needed to keep their strength up in order to take advantage of any opportunity to escape. Gabrielle finished choking down her "meal" and lay her head back and let the horrors of the last few days wash over her.</p>
		<p>It had been four days since they had been forced to surrender, and three of those days on the road moving further from her beloved warrior. With every day the small party was farther away from Ciros and farther away from any hope for rescue.</p>
		<p>The Queen wept silently trying not to let her companions know how hopeless their predicament truly was. She was afraid that if the weren't found soon, all hope would be gone.</p>
		<p>She was also afraid of Xena's reaction when she found out about the sacrifice the compassionate bard had made to save the little ones from a horrible death, their brains bashed out on the rocks (the vision that invoked made her shudder violently). Would her fiercely proud lover be able to forgive her and understand why she'd let them touch her like that?</p>
		<p>The bard found herself praying to any god that would listen to help Xena find her and take her away from this waking nightmare.</p>
		<p>&amp;lt;&amp;gt;Please Xena, my heart, hurry&amp;lt;&amp;gt; the bard thought desperately&amp;lt;&amp;gt;I don't know if I can take it much longer without you. I need you my love.&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</p>
		<p>The tears continued to fall from Gabrielle's eyes even after she fell into an exhausted sleep. Her two companions took turns watching over their Queen as she slept, each knowing the self-imposed burden the small woman carried.</p>
		<p>They knew she was not only worried about her own fate but she also felt responsible for the fates of the two Amazons as well. They'd seen her flinch when the slavers had whipped them for not following orders as if she was receiving each stroke herself.</p>
		<p>They tried to interfere with Gabrielle's punishment for defending the weaker ones among the other prisoners.</p>
		<p>Both of them had seen their Queen not move or make a sound as she accepted her own flogging, but they'd also heard her cry out and beg for mercy for them as the commander had given them ten strokes each. Her bravery and compassion were an inspiration to the two scouts.</p>
		<p>After their Queen was asleep, both Mallika and Rapa quietly made a blood oath to avenge their Queen's indignity at the first opportunity.</p>
		<p>Later that night as the rest of the camp slept, Mallika heard the call of a night bird that made her heart race. She silently woke her partner and bade her to listen and confirm that this was a very special and welcome night bird.</p>
		<p>They woke their Queen and the trio waited for the first opportunity to answer that plaintive call that meant freedom.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Always 9">
		<p>As the chariot of Apollo began it's journey in the morning sky, he found Xena and her new Amazon contingent well on their way into the third day of following the trail of Gabrielle and her captors.</p>
		<p>While there was always a concern when the women and civilians of any town or peoples was taken, as Gabrielle and her remaining escort had been, some would think it was easy, since Xena had gained a reputation for freeing captured slaves.</p>
		<p>This time it was different. This time it was her bard that had been taken. Ever since they had begun traveling together, this had always been one of the warrior's greatest fears.</p>
		<p>She knew that if her captors found out who Gabrielle was and what she meant to Xena, it would go a lot harder on the little green-eyed blonde from Poteidaia.</p>
		<p>Another concern was all three of the captives' status as Amazons. For some perverse reason, they were highly prized among those who kept slaves, to be used either as gladiators or as tortured and broken sex slaves, in some of the more exclusive brothels.</p>
		<p>Xena knew too, that there were always those among mercenary bands like Karcax's, that had been outcast by most of the regular armies because of their violent ways with women, but for some reason that kind was welcome amongst the ranks of a force, like the one that now held Gabrielle and her two fellow Amazons. In her own warlord days, Xena had a standing order against rape, and the punishment for breaking that order, was death.</p>
		<p>If somehow one of these types found out either of Gabrielle's alternate identities, she would be fair game for whatever they could imagine as entertainment.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, if she could convince some of them that she was a simple bard with her apprentices, then they may even be spared some of the degradations the others may face. Bards were considered valuable and usually left unmolested, even by the most barbaric of slavers.</p>
		<p>These thoughts spurred Xena on, and through her, Aentia and her small troupe of scouts.</p>
		<p>Shortly before noon, one of the scouts that been sent on ahead returned to report that the group they were pursuing, had split up. They wanted the Queen's champion to come see if she could shed any light on which group to follow.</p>
		<p>Driven by fear for her lover's well being, Xena spurred her tired mount on to the turning point.</p>
		<p>Getting off the skittish war horse, the warrior hurried to where the Amazon scouts knelt beside the road where the trails split, one heading inland toward some of the smaller independent city states. The other led toward some of the larger, less scrupulously patrolled, port cities that welcomed, even catered, to the purveyors of human cargo.</p>
		<p>It was the latter trail that Xena paid closest attention to, on the hunch that if she was able, her ever inventive bard would leave her some clue to their direction, knowing that the warrior would be hot on the trail of her captors.</p>
		<p>Sure enough, Xena's searching azure eyes spotted a small leather strap tied around a rock holding a torn piece of parchment. Xena pulled the tiny folded paper, and unfolded it to read it's contents.</p>
		<p>As she read, a small smile of pride and satisfaction lifted the corners of the sullen warrior's lips and tears of pride formed at the corners of her eyes. She handed the note to Aentia who read it and chuckled at the bravery and audacity of her Queen.</p>
		<p>"She is truly something, huh, Aentia?" Xena said, the pride evident in her husky, emotion-choked voice. "Is it any wonder such a woman would hold my soul?"</p>
		<p>"Yes she is, Champion," the Amazon commander agreed, her own respect for the little queen raising a notch. "Truly a worthy queen and a true Amazon warrior as well as a worthy guardian of a warrior's soul."</p>
		<p>Seeing the curious looks from the other Amazons, Aentia looked for, and received, approval from Xena to show the others the parchment. They all smiled. The note said.</p>
		<p>I'm waiting my love.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:10cm">G</p>
		<p>Anxious to catch up with the slave caravan, now that she was sure that Gabrielle was still reasonably well, Xena sprang to Argo's back. The faithful animal started down the trail toward her rider's waiting lover.</p>
		<p>Aentia waited long enough to send one of her scouts to find an Amazon border patrol to relay a warning about the new marauding warlord, and his army. Then she and her remaining scouts took to the nearby trees in an effort to keep up with the impatient champion.</p>
		<p>The pursuers continued on after the slow moving caravan until by night fall, they were nearly caught up to them. The scout on point brought word that she had spotted the caravan's rear guard, and the main group holding the slaves wasn't far ahead.</p>
		<p>Xena was all for riding into the camp and taking her beloved Gabrielle right then. Only Aentia's logical warning about endangering the Queen if they accidentally ran up on their camp in the dark kept an enraged Xena from charging on after the slavers.</p>
		<p>Aentia could just barely see the stoic, yet friendly Queen's Champion in the Xena she was seeing now. This was a cold, calculating, tempestuous force of nature, bent on the total destruction of any and all that came between her and her objective.</p>
		<p>This, Aentia decided, must be what she must have been like when Xena was called the Destroyer of Nations, before she met her savior and soulmate.</p>
		<p>It was obvious to Aentia that without the peaceful, loving influence of Gabrielle, the world would be a very different place. All Greece would be living in fear of this tall, dark, powerful warrior instead of hanging their hopes on her.</p>
		<p>With a cold shiver running up her spine, she once again looked into those two crystal-blue ice chips the tall, dark woman had for eyes awaiting her orders. The veteran warrior was suddenly grateful she had never faced the Warrior Princess across the battlefield, the ruthless merciless vision of the warlord was clear for all to see.</p>
		<p>With Aentia's cooperation, Xena took full command of the mission. She sent one of the scouts out into the night to locate their prey.</p>
		<p>"Just find their camp," Xena emphasized. "Don't get too close. Remember, no matter what you think, these guys just got done taking, and destroying a well fortified city complete with its own garrison, so they're tougher than they look."</p>
		<p>She looked deep into the liquid brown eyes of the scout and liked the serious intensity she saw there, but added more for her own piece of mind.</p>
		<p>"If you do something *stupid* that gets my Gabrielle hurt, there will be nowhere you can hide," the Warrior Princess warned. "She is everything to me and anyone causes her harm, I will personally see to it they die for days."</p>
		<p>Every one of the Amazons nodded their understanding including Aentia, if even half the stories of the Destroyer were true, Xena would have no second thoughts about following through with her promise. They were sure it was a promise not just a threat.</p>
		<p>During the search, Xena's single-minded pursuit of her bard's captors had made her feelings for their Queen clear to them all. On one hand, Aentia hoped she would find herself lucky enough to have that kind of all consuming love someday. On the other hand, she found herself fearing it more than death itself.</p>
		<p>It was also clear to the Amazons that if anything happened to Gabrielle, the only thing the powerful ex-warlord would live for would be, to hunt down, and destroy whoever was responsible. It was also left unsaid, but well known, that once that was done, the warrior would never be heard from again.</p>
		<p>Their Queen was the Warrior Princess' life, without Gabrielle there was no Xena, and the warrior so feared her own darkness that she would rather die than risk turning back into the conqueror she once was. In her heart, Xena knew that to do that would be to dishonor the woman that had sacrificed so much to redeem her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The small party made a cold camp that night, not wanting to alert their prey to their presence. After setting up guard shifts, Aentia and the rest of the Amazons found comfortable places to sleep a short distance from the road.</p>
		<p>Xena sat on a convenient log, and as was her nightly habit, began sharpening her weapons. The steady whoosh of the sharpening stone on steel and the feral look on the warrior's face made her companions nervous, but none of them felt the necessity to bring it up to the one time warlord.</p>
		<p>The warrior hadn't even taken the time to clean the viscera and blood from the skirmish in the burned city. She was a sight that easily struck fear into any that saw her coming. Xena was not known for her patience, and considering the situation, Aentia thought it wiser to worry about the champion in silence rather than risk talking to her about it.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Xena stopped sharpening in mid-stroke and began muttering something to herself.</p>
		<p>"It's not right," she said under her breath. "This is too easy. No way he wouldn't be expecting some kind of pursuit. What is that Hades cursed bastard up to?"</p>
		<p>Xena suddenly slammed her sword back into it's scabbard and stood abruptly. Thinking better when she moved, Xena began pacing around the quiet camp. As she prowled past each still form laying around the campsite, the warrior princess unconsciously noticed who was asleep and who was laying watching her.</p>
		<p>Like a lightening bolt the thought struck her.</p>
		<p>"A trap it's got to be," Xena hissed. "No warlord worth his armor could be this stupid. Aentia!"</p>
		<p>"Here, Champion!" The troupe leader answered leeping from the ground. "What is it?"</p>
		<p>"I want you to choose your two best and fastest scouts," Xena began back in her own element, a commander of armies, "ones you can rely on. Send one back along our back trail, as far as the turn off and to keep her eyes and ears open."</p>
		<p>"Apia," the veteran commanded and a young but hard-looking scout appeared from the surrounding darkness, "you heard the Champion, do it."</p>
		<p>With a quick salute, the scout turned and disappeared back into the darkness. Aentia turned back to the warrior for her next order.</p>
		<p>"Good, now I need your fastest," Xena continued nodding her head at the leader's acceptance of her command. "But be sure she's cautious enough not to be caught-- we'll be depending on her for our very lives."</p>
		<p>Aentia thought for a second then a grim smile crossed her lips, not touching her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Tessa," the woman hissed, determined to be as quiet as possible.</p>
		<p>A small, wiry, dark-skinned scout with an angry red scar down the left side of her face appeared from the shadows and knelt down next to them, her attention focused on her new commander.</p>
		<p>"You need to go by the most direct route back to the nation," Xena explained urgently, hoping the woman would understand the importance of her mission. "I'm sure by now the regent has sent a company of Amazon warriors to join us.</p>
		<p>You must find them and bring them to us as quickly as you can. Tell them that we've stumbled into a trap and if they don't make it here, the lives of your queen and this troop may well be forfeit.</p>
		<p>GO!"</p>

		<p>"What's happened Xena?" Aentia asked. The comment about a trap had her worried.</p>
		<p>"I don't know where my brain is," Xena growled, angered by her lapse in judgment. "I'm sorry Aentia, I'm afraid I've been so focused on Gabrielle I wasn't thinking clearly."</p>
		<p>She studied the older Amazon's face but saw no condemnation, only understanding.</p>
		<p>"I should have picked it up from the beginning when the trails were so easy to follow," Xena continued. "I fell for the oldest trick in the warlord's instruction scrolls and walked right into the trap he set for pursuers."</p>
