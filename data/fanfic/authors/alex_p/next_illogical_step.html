<p>Willow turned away from her computer screen to
give her eyes a much deserved rest, she looked over at the couch to check on her best
friend and lover, Buffy. The Slayer had fallen asleep on Giles couch again. Willow felt a
slight twinge of guilt knowing that she was the reason Buffy was sprawled here on the
couch instead of in her own warm comfortable bed next door in their townhouse. </p>

<p>She'd tried many times before to get her to go on
home to bed, but Buffy always mumbled something about not wanting to be alone any more and
refused to leave until Willow did. Willow noticed a slightly mischievous smile on the
sleeping girl's lips. </p>

<p>&lt;I wonder what's going on inside that pretty
head.&gt; Willow thought &lt;Something wickedly fun no doubt.&gt; </p>

<p>In the time since they had returned from Teach Tu
Dannan, both found that they simply couldn't get enough of each other. Even now, as tired
as she was, watching Buffy sleep Willow practically ached to take her blonde haired lover
in her arms and make love right there on Giles couch. &lt;Bad Willow, bad, bad Willow&gt;
she scolded herself. You must let the poor girl rest sometime or you'll wear her out and
then what would you do?&gt; </p>

<p>Willow sighed not wanting to ever think of life
without Buffy. She couldn't resist one more look at her before returning to work.
&lt;Goddess, she is so beautiful.&gt; Willow thought as the longing returned, &lt;I can't
believe she's mine at last.&gt; </p>

<p>Willow knew the other reason Buffy was so tired.
She'd found out that last night was one of Willow's sabats, Litha, the summer solstice,
and she had insisted on joining Willow in the ritual that had lasted until shortly before
dawn. As always after a celebrating a ritual Willow was energized, but poor Buffy was
completely worn out. As she turned back to her computer, Willow heard Giles mumbling
something to himself in his study. He too was deeply immersed in his own research. </p>

<p>Ever since they had shown up on his door step with
their gifts from Brigit, Morrigan, and Lugh, Giles had been like a kid in a candy store.
First he went to work translating the runes, and writings on the weapons and Willow's
staff. After finishing that he gathered the staff, the wooden dagger, and the rings and
took them all to a jeweler he knew to have the stones identified and appraised. </p>

<p>All four of the large green stones turned out to
be very rare very valuable emeralds and the four smaller red stones in the hilt of the
dagger were nearly flawless blood rubies. The man had tried everything to get Giles to
sell them but he'd steadfastly refused. Once he had finished with all he could find
on those artifacts, he turned to the one task he knew he'd love, the book. He became
obsessed with it he was unable to stop himself, if it hadn't been for Buffy and Willow he
would have starved to death studying that book. </p>

<p>Try as she might Willow was unable to fault him
for his obsession, it had saved Buffy's life more than once. Willow had to smile when she
thought of the look on his face when he came charging out of the study, to share his findings the first time. </p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&quot;I can not believe this it's just so
bloody marvelous, Giles kept saying pacing too excited to sit. &quot;After god knows how
long, I am the first watcher to ever see this and since we have broken off contact with
the council I can't even tell them about it.&quot; </p>

<p>He translated some more then began muttering. </p>

<p>&quot;This is just fantastic.&quot; he said to
himself then turned to the two girls that were staring at him like he was insane. &quot;Do
you have any idea what this is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we knew that then why would we need
you.&quot; Buffy said sarcastically, she'd had a bad day in class. </p>

<p>Some times she wondered if 'coming out' was worth
all the trouble but, one look at Willow always answered that question. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy!&quot; Willow scolded &quot;Be nice,
Giles isn't the one you're mad at.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right, sorry Giles, my bad.&quot; Buffy
apologized </p>

<p>Giles looked at Buffy surprised, now he knew
Willow was good for her, she had never apologized before. </p>

<p>&quot;Translating these kinds of things is your
specialty Giles,&quot; Willow continued, &quot;Buffy and I wouldn't have the slightest
idea where to even begin. You are the one that figured out that my staff was made
specifically for me, to focus and amplify my powers, you learned that the dirks were once
called the 'Spurs of Erin' and that the wooden dagger was a Pictish artifact known as
'Demon Claw', all very helpful information in finding out their uses and now you have
found out something about the origins of the book. I'm not surprised Brigit said you were
the one to turn to. We trust you completely.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh..well...yes..I appreciate your
trust.&quot; Giles stumbled, embarrassed by the young witch's praise, he cleared his
throat then continued &quot;Getting back to the book, I haven't gotten much past the title
and a few lines here and there, but from what I gather, what you girls brought home is the
'Book of Souls'.&quot; He paused expecting a reaction when none was forth coming he
explained further. </p>

<p>&quot;Well I suppose that would mean nothing to
you, but believe me this is a major find.&quot; He lectured, &quot;It was the repository
for much of the Druid lore, their grimoire so to speak. It is even said that it holds the
secrets of creation and making thus also their opposites.&quot; </p>

<p>There was a hiss as Willow drew in a sharp breath
through clenched teeth. </p>

<p>&quot;Exactly so.&quot; Giles said looking at the
young witch over the top of his glasses. &quot;The power these people have entrusted into
your hands is unfathomable. Their confidence and trust in you is unbelievably strong. The
last time anyone heard of this book being seen was before the time of King Arthur and the
Christian incursion into Ireland. It was said to have been returned to the gods and most
scholars believed it was either destroyed or that it never existed in the first place. I
guess now we know the truth.&quot;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Giles was in watcher heaven. With the help of
Willow's expertise the two of them came up with a program to help him translate the
various languages used in the book. Every day he found some new medicine spell or piece of
nformation that had him running around all excited. </p>

<p>Soon between Willow being 'Research Girl' on her
computer and Giles progress with the 'Book of Souls' they'd pretty much learned just about
everything they wanted to know about the gifts and their uses, all that is except the
rings. This soon became Willow's obsession, stopping only to eat or patrol with Buffy,
Willow spent nearly every waking moment searching any historical data base she could find,
but still no luck. </p>

<p>She finally got so bad that Buffy had suggested
that she go to the goddess either for help or at least some perspective on the subject.
Seeing no other available option Willow had done just that last night. Yet here she was
again, with her nose buried in her computer, searching. &lt;I guess sometimes the answer
is no.&gt; she thought discouraged. </p>

<p>At that moment an accidental missed keystroke
placed her in a section of the Vatican library she'd never been in before. It was the
forbidden books section, Willow had picked up rumors about this area but had never been
able to find it, until now. As she read through the thousands of files, Willow came across
the mention of a an ancient sect of Celtic female warriors called 'Sisters of the Soul.
Excited and thanking the goddess Willow began searching and cross referencing her way into
several deeply encrypted files that the Church considered so heathen and so blasphemous
that only the most dedicated priests were allowed to see them. </p>

<p>Delving deep into these files Willow finally found
an eyewitness account over one thousand years old telling of the sect and many of the
ceremonies and rites they practiced. It was here that Willow learned the purpose of the
rings and where to look in the 'Book of Souls' to find the details. It was also here she
learned the truth behind the disappearance of the sect. Because the ceremony called upon
ancient gods and was the mating of two people of the same sex, the Church declared it
blasphemous and an obscenity in the eyes of their god. So they began a systematic campaign
to wipe out all knowledge of the sect, including hiring assassins to murder the women. </p>

<p>Tears were in Willow's eyes as she realized this
was a record of hypocrisy and deceit as old as time but the idea of someone supposedly on
the side of the Light committing the atrocities she was reading about was unforgivable.
Especially when it was women of the same caliber as their friends Brigit and Morrigan.
&lt;Those Bastards!!&gt; Willow said to herself &lt;I hope they're burning in their own
private hell!&gt;</p>

<p>The more Willow read the angrier she became until,
after she copied all the information, Willow fed a virus she'd created into the system
that would not only cover her tracks but it would also destroy everything in the files
she'd been reading if not that entire section of their library including the hard drive.
That done Willow gathered the print outs and went to show Giles. </p>

</table>

<p>&quot;You did what?&quot; Giles asked angrily when
Willow told him what she had done to the Vatican's library files. &quot;Why would you do
that? How could you take that kind of chance? What if they trace your virus back here? I
just wish you had put a little more thought into it or at least informed me before you
acted so rashly. Honestly Willow I don't know what to think, this is completely out of
character for you. &quot; </p>

<p>Willow sat calmly and let the over protective
ex-watcher rant until he was finished and glaring at her waiting for her answer. She knew
he was really mad, she could see the vein throbbing on his right temple and that was
usually reserved for the Slayer. </p>

<p>&quot;Calm down Giles before you hurt
yourself.&quot; she said quietly yet firmly </p>

<p>&lt;She's treating me like a petulant child.&gt;
Giles thought. </p>

<p>He sat down behind the desk with a huff. She
smiled at him sweetly. </p>

<p>&quot;That's much better.&quot; Willow said
patiently I don't know what your problem is. It's not like I'm some rank amateur at this,
I took precautions. First I went through so many different connections Ma Bell and all her
little baby Bells couldn't trace me. Second the virus destroys all evidence of my
incursion along with the files including the hard drive, they'll never be able to retrieve
that information again, and third I did it for all those women the Church had murdered
just because they had different beliefs and had the good fortune to find someone they
loved, and stayed with them no matter what.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then they bragged about it Giles read it,
that's all those records are is some old bigot of a priest bragging about how many
blameless women he personally had murdered. Hell, their lucky I didn't bring the whole
place down on them. Besides you know how the Vatican works they'd probably come after
Buffy and me if they thought they'd get away with it.&quot; </p>

<p>Faced with her logic and determination Giles had
no alternative but to calm himself and read the information she'd brought him. &quot;This
is ghastly&quot; he muttered as he read the account. &quot;How could they possibly justify
this?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You see my point.&quot; Willow said softly
&quot;Those bastards had dozens of innocent women slaughtered in the name of
religious purity and the Church not only condoned it, the priests responsible were given
rewards and promotions for their 'good works'. I know what I did was a little rash but, I
just couldn't let those men be remembered by history as heroes of the
faith, so I've done my best to see that history
doesn't remember them at all.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright Willow, while I can't condone your
methods,&quot; Giles said holding up his hand to stop the protest forming on her lips
&quot;I do have to agree it was at least a logical response. My only comment is that this
is not the last time you will run into this kind of thing and the next time you feel the
urge to take action please consult me before you do anything and we might come up with a
more appropriate response. One that wont deprive the world of valuable historical
records.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay I can live with that.&quot; Willow
agreed &quot;Now let's get to work on the section of the book that's mentioned here, and
see what's next on my schedule so I can clear my calendar,&quot; </p>

<p>She was joking but as she read it suddenly became
unfunny. Giles finished the section shortly after she did and took off his glasses and
began rubbing the bridge of his nose. </p>

<p>&quot;Well that was certainly interesting.&quot;
he said a little sarcastically, &quot;I will be looking forward to seeing how you handle
this.&quot; </p>

<p>&lt;Now he shows a sense of humor&gt; Willow
thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; Willow shot back.
&quot;You mean no words of wisdom from the all mighty, all knowing watcher?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, I am afraid you are on your own for this
one.&quot; Giles answered with a slight smile &quot;This is one Slayer/Willow situation
that falls far outside my duties and way beyond my experience.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh great, nothing quite so useless as a
useless watcher.&quot; Willow grumbled &quot;Can I at least count on your
cooperation?&quot; </p>

<p>Giles nodded his head trying to keep from laughing
at Willow's newest dilemma. </p>

<p>&quot;Good&quot; Willow said thoughtfully then she
knew just the right person to talk to. &quot;Alright Mr. laugh at the confused witch guy,
then not a word to anyone and I mean anyone.&quot; </p>

<p>He agreed quickly and satisfied Willow hurried out
to find Buffy's mother. Once Willow tracked down Joyce Summers and explained everything to
her she suggested that they get Willow's mother on board for this situation. </p>

<p>Willow's mother wasn't as comfortable with her
daughter's alternative lifestyle as her husband and Joyce, but this problem was something
she could understand, in theory at least. She jumped in with both feet and was a veritable
fountain of information. Arrangements were coming along nicely when Willow decided it was
time to 'talk' to Buffy. </p>

<p>At Willow's insistence Buffy took a night off from
patrol and wearing her best dress went to meet Willow at their favorite Italian
restaurant. The owner of the restaurant had taken a liking to the couple and as soon as he
saw Buffy come through the front door he hurried over and gave her a major bear type hug
nearly crushing the breath out of her. </p>

<p>&quot;Please Mr. Lipari, can't breath,&quot; Buffy
gasped. </p>

<p>&quot;Your little Willow is waiting for you.&quot;
the man said setting her down and releasing her &quot;If you'll just follow me I'll take you to her.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sure thing Mr. Lipari.&quot; She said
mystified and noticing the huge grin plastered on his face. &quot;Say, just between you
and me, any idea what's going on?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh no Buffy.&quot; he answered &quot;I've
been sworn to absolute secrecy. Willow would skin me alive if I told you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay we wouldn't want that.&quot; she
chuckled &quot;Who'd make my canolli if something happened to you. I couldn't' eat anyone
elses after tasting yours.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You are too kind&quot; he said truly
flattered then the grin reappeared, &quot;But I'm still not telling you. Now come along
Ms. Willow is waiting.&quot; </p>

<p>The friendly man led her through the main dinning
area but instead of going to their favorite table he led her to the door of one of the
private dinning rooms. When she entered it took her breath away, the only illumination in
the room were dozens of flickering candles and standing next to the only table was Willow.
She was a vision in an emerald green silk dress it was obvious that she'd been to the
salon, looking at her Buffy could feel that familiar ache of longing deep in her soul.
 </p>

<p>Willow motioned to Buffy to come to the table and
held her chair while she sat down. Unable to resist Willow leaned down and lightly brushed
her lips against the soft skin of Buffy's neck. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh god Wills.&quot; Buffy moaned trying to
urge her to continue but Willow straightened up and went to her own chair directly across
from Buffy. </p>

<p>There was a single white rose next to Buffy's
plate, she held it to her nose and slowly inhaled it's fragrance. She looked over the top
of the rose and smiled at the way Willow was watching her every move. </p>

<p>Mr Lipari himself served their meal that they ate
in complete silence, their eyes speaking volumes across the table in a language only they
understood. Finally as they were finishing their desert (Mr Lipari's famous canolli,
Buffy's favorite) Buffy's curiosity got the better of her. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright my little witchy girl,&quot; Buffy
began,as she ran the tip of one fingernail gently over the back of Willow's hand,
&quot;What's going on here?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why Slayer what ever do you mean?&quot;
Willow said with mock innocence, &quot;I'm just out to dinner with my bestest gal.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right, &quot; Buffy said only semi playfully
&quot;I'll tell you what, I'll go on home now and when your ready to let me in on the
secret that's where I'll be.&quot; She started to rise but Willow grabbed her
wrist to stop her, Buffy looked into those
pleading eyes and sat back down knowing she was lost. </p>

<p>&quot;Please don't leave Buffy.&quot; Willow's
voice was strained &quot;I promise you'll understand real soon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Buffy said softly
&quot;It's just I'm not a patient person, life's too short, especially a Slayer's
life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't&quot; Willow said closing her eyes
trying to stop the tears. &quot;Please don't say that.&quot; </p>

<p>Seeing the hurt she'd inadvertently caused Willow,
Buffy went around the table and cradled the weeping girl's head. </p>

<p>&lt;Geez Summers way to go&gt; Buffy thought,
mentally kicking herself &lt;Some day I just gotta learn to shut up.&gt; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't cry Wills &quot; Buffy said in a
frightened almost little girl voice. &quot;It was a mean thing to say, I'm sorry I didn't
say it to hurt you.&quot; </p>

<p>Willow looked into Buffy's clear blue eyes and
felt herself drawn into their depths. </p>

<p>&quot;It's alright honey, really&quot; Willow
reassured her. &quot;It's just that I don't want to think about that tonight. Tonight is
for better, more optimistic things. Now please go back and sit down.&quot; </p>

<p>Buffy did as Willow requested and Willow reached
over and took Buffy's hand. They gazed into each other's eyes and for a moment time ceased
to exist. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; when Willow said her name like
that it almost sounded like she was praying &quot;I guess it's time to tell you why I
wanted to meet you here tonight.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well to be honest, I'm getting a little
curious.&quot; Buffy answered her I mean aside from the good food and the pleasant company
not to mention a welcome night off, I figured there had to be some thing going on.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It's just that well I found something that
day after Litha, while you were asleep and it's got me thinking.&quot; Willow started
holding on to Buffy's hand tightly &quot;I know we've just got done telling everyone about
us and after all we've been through with that and I know that logic and common sense would
dictate tat we 'lay low' and not do any thing to call attention to ourselves at least
until tings settle down.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay that's kinda the way I figured.&quot;
Buffy interrupted but Willow held up her hand to stop her. </p>

<p>&quot;Like I was saying, I've come across some
disturbing information that has made me rethink that idea.&quot; Willow continued
&quot;What I've found has made me think about how short life can be and how easy it is for
some outside force to make that life even shorter. </p>

<p>My greatest fear has always been to leave this
life with too many regrets. Like everyone I have many things that I regret that it's too
late to do anything about but I've decided that we...you and I..we...our relationship is
not going to be one of those regrets.&quot; </p>

<p>&lt;Oh god she's leaving me!&gt; Buffy thought,
she felt an icy dagger of fear pierce her heart. &lt;I've done something wrong, I've been
to clingy.&gt; </p>

<p>Willow saw the stricken look cross Buffy's face
and hurried to reassure her. &quot;I don't mean I want out.&quot; Willow clarified quickly
&quot;It's just that what I want to do doesn't make any sense. I mean we're in a pretty
good place right now and most people would be happy to sit back and relax, but we're not
most people.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ain't it the truth.&quot; Buffy snorted
despite the seriousness of the moment. </p>

<p>&quot;I guess the best way to explain this is to
tell you what I've found.&quot; Willow told Buffy everything she'd found about the Sisters
of the Soul and how they were persecuted and murdered by minions of the church until there
were only two left and the legend that said the last two were rescued by the gods and
taken still living to paradise to become gods themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;I think you can figure out who those last
two sisters were.&quot; Willow added </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah I can.&quot; Buffy said tears flowing
unchecked from her eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;Like I said I've found out a lot.&quot;
Willow said kissing Buffy's hand &quot;One of the things I've learned is that when two
sisters are united they go through certain ceremonies. One is like a wedding with
family and friends so that everyone can celebrate the joining of souls. The second is a
ritual of joining with only their closest friends attending. Ever since I've found out
about I've been running around trying to set this up and I've gotten to the point where I
can't go any farther without you.&quot; </p>

<p>Willow stopped and looked deep into Buffy's eyes.
Then she got up, came around the table and dropped to her knees beside Buffy and looked up
at the angelic face she loved so much. &quot;I guess the best way to say what I'm trying
to say is,&quot; Willow said her voice trembling with pent up emotion &quot;I love you
Buffy Summers, will you marry me?&quot; </p>

<p>Buffy was speechless, she'd never figured on this.
Her mind was completely out of control her thoughts swirling and jumbled, she couldn't put
a single coherent thought together. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh..I...ah..you.. we...&quot; No matter how
hard she tried Buffy couldn't say a complete sentence. She knew she loved Willow more than
life itself and she knew that she would do whatever it took to make the red haired girl
with the bright green eyes happy. She also knew that nothing in this world would make her
happier than to tell the world that she loved Willow Rosenberg. </p>

<p>So her answer was short easy and to the
point. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes yes yes yes !&quot; was Buffy's final
word on the subject. </p>
