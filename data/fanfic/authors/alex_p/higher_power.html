<p>Willow was sitting on the Slayer's bed hugging Mr. Gordo to
her chest, her legs drawn up as she gently rocked staring intently at the door waiting
impatiently for it to open. More worried than usual, the hollow feeling in her chest and
the lump in her throat was telling her that something was definitely wrong with her Buffy.
However the actual nature of the trouble eluded her. Buffy had been getting back from her
patrols later each night. Each night she was exhausted to the point of collapse and though
she denied it, Willow could tell that she wasn't bouncing back like she used to.</p>

<p>It was breaking Willow's heart to see the person she cared
about even more than life itself go out every night to face what ever danger the Hellmouth
might throw at her when they both knew Buffy was not in any condition to fight them. Now
she was more than 2 hours over due and even though she had promised not to go out alone
after sunset, especially not to look for Buffy on patrol, Willow was considering facing
her friends anger and going out to find Buffy anyway. She just couldn't get over the
feeling that the Slayer was in serious trouble.</p>

<p>&lt;I can't loose her, I couldn't go on without her&gt; she
thought to herself and a sob escaped her throat. &lt;Don't do that !!&gt; she yelled at
herself &lt;No negative thoughts! Buffy is fine...Buffy is safe...Buffy
is....GORGEOUS!!&gt; A mischievous smile played over her lips as she thought of her
friends near perfect athletic body. &lt;Stop that!! Bad Willow, bad, bad Willow&gt; Her
chest tightened as she recalled the warmth of Buffy's body pressing against her whenever
they hugged. &lt;Friendly hugs only&gt; she reminded herself.</p>

<p>Willow knew that she really truly, deeply, loved her with
every part of her body and soul but she hadn&#146;t done anything about it and everything
she could to deny the reality of those feelings, ending with her disastrous relationship
with Oz, but that was so over now and she'd been forced to face the truth. Eventually she
learned to settle for the platonic friendship Buffy offered and simply learn to live with
the constant frustration of unrequited love. She just knew that it would all work out as
long as Buffy never found out, not ever.</p>

<p>Willow's thoughts were interrupted when the door to their
room flew open, slamming loudly against the wall, revealing a figure leaning on the
doorframe to hold themselves up. Willow gasped when she realized it was her best friend
and roommate (not to mention her entire world). Worry overcame control, &#147;Buffy.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy was barely recognizable under all the dirt and blood
her whole body heaving under her effort to breath. Willow jumped off the bed and ran to
the Slayer's side. Buffy raised her head and looked into the deep, dark green eyes of her
closest and dearest friend and smiled weakly.</p>

<p>&#147;Hey Wills!&#148; Buffy whispered breathlessly
&#147;Rough slayage tonight.&#148;</p>

<p>The Slayer tried to chuckle but was too weak.</p>

<p>Willow pulled Buffy's arm over her shoulders and wrapped her
other arm around Buffy's waist and helped her across the room to her bed.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&#147;What happened?&#148; Willow asked as she carefully
helped Buffy sit down on the bed. &#147;Is it some new master vampire or maybe an arch
demon from the Hellmouth determined to destroy the world You just tell me and I'll get
everyone together and foil their evil plans cause that's what we do the Slayer and her
possie guarding the Hellmouth and defending mankind from those evil nasties
that........&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Please Willow&#148; Buffy groaned and held up her hand
stop the girl's nervous babbling. &#147;It's nothing like that.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Then what happened?&#148; Willow asked suddenly serious
&#147;Who did this to you?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Easy Wills, don't blow a brain cell.&#148; Buffy said
with more strength than she really had. &#147;I'm not really sure what happened, it was
just your everyday regular vamps, three of them, I was kickin' ass when all of a sudden I
was so tired, It was like I couldn't even hold my arms up let alone fight. &#147;I got
lucky and&nbsp; introduced two of them to Mr. Pointy and the last one ran away.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Good thing too cause as soon as he was out of sight I
fell right there in the blood and vamp dust and was too tired to get up..so I just laid
there. I could feel every scrape cut and bruise they gave me and some I had before I met
them.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Finally I got up enough strength to get home to my
Wills, cause I know she'll take care of me and make all my big bad Slayer boo-boos all
better.&#148;</p>

<p>Hearing that Willow realized she was just sitting there
holding Buffy in her arms rocking her gently completely engrossed in the warm wonderful
feel of the woman she loved gently pressing against her. The beautiful blonde head resting
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Reminded of her friend's condition Willow gently lay Buffy
down on the bed and went to her closet. She rummaged around until she found the first aide
box and returned to Buffy's side. Willow began laying out the supplies she needed to treat
her friend's wounds but before she could start tending those wounds Buffy raised herself
up a low groan escaping from deep in her throat.</p>

<p>&#147;Hold on Wills,&#148; she said softly, &#147;I've got to
take a shower. I mean whoa, major stink.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy wrinkled her nose to demonstrate her point causing
Willow to giggle despite of her concern for her friend.</p>

<p>&#147;Buffy! you can't be serious!&#148; Willow exclaimed
stunned by her best friend's intention. &#147;You can barely sit up let alone make it to
the showers.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh please Wills, stop acting like my mother.&#148;
Buffy wished she hadn't said it the second the last word left her mouth. &#147;Oh god I'm
sorry Wills...I didn't really mean that. I know you're only trying to help. I'm just tired
and grumpy nothing a hot shower won't cure.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;B-But you can't....&#148; Willow began but Buffy cut
her off.</p>

<p>&#147;Did you forget?&#148; Buffy said with false bravado and
pointing at her own chest, &#147;You're dealing with the big bad Slayer, the all powerful
Chosen One, you can knock me down but I spring right back up. Nothing keeps me down.&#148;</p>

<p>With that Buffy sat up and began removing her disgustingly
dirty and torn clothes with some difficulty because of her injuries.</p>

<p>&#147;A little help here please,&#148; she groaned the pain
showing in her voice. &#147;Oh....sure...no probs&#148; Willow mumbled distracted, she
began helping the injured Slayer to remove her clothes.</p>

<p>&#147;Just throw them in the trash Wills,&#148; Buffy told
her friend &#147;They're shot, DOA, deceased.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yeah..s-sure&#148; Willow stammered slightly afraid to
trust her voice &#147;in the trash.&#148;</p>

<p>The red haired woman swallowed hard and tried to stop her
hands from trembling as she helped reveal Buffy's warm soft skin Willow could barely
contain her urge to lean down and kiss that inviting soft white skin just to find out what
it tasted like.</p>

<p>Buffy was watching her out of the corner of her eye. She
could see the emotions plainly showing on her roommates face. She sympathized but she
couldn't allow that to happen. When all Buffy had left was her underwear she stood up
slowly and broke the contact between herself and Willow.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't stop her eyes from wandering over Buffy's
body drinking in the intoxicating beauty before her.</p>

<p>&lt;Bad Willow, bad, bad Willow&gt; she scolded herself.
&lt;Mustn't lust after your best friend no matter how incredibly beautiful and sexy you
think she is!&gt;</p>

<p>She took an inventory of every cut scrape bruise and scar on
the Slayer's body and recalled in flashes of memory the story behind the worst of them it
was easy she'd been there for most of them.</p>

<p>&#147;Hello earth to Willow&#148; Buffy called to her
distracted friend, &#147;Could you give me a hand with my robe?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Huh, yeah sure.&#148; Willow said coming back to
reality. &#147;Here you go. Give me a second and I'll come help you.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No...I'll be alright.&#148; Buffy said as she put on
her soft terrycloth robe &#147;The Slayer should at least be able to clean herself. I
won't be long.&#148;</p>

<p>She picked up her shower bag and walked out of their
room, making sure to hold her &quot;strong&quot; pose until she was sure that there was no
way Willow could see her. Once she heard the door close Buffy slumped against the wall and
using it as a brace she limped slowly down the hall to the showers, pain and exhaustion
showing clearly on her face now that her best friend couldn't see.</p>

<p>Buffy had long ago figured out how Willow felt about her. It
was easy, she felt the same way about beautiful red haired friend. However she also knew
she could never tell Willow how she felt.&nbsp; If Buffy had learned only one thing after
spending all these years as a Slayer on a Hellmouth it was that if she showed any kind of
real love for anyone that person became the target of every nasty slimy evil thing that
crawled out of the place. Her proof was when Angelus figured out how she felt about the
shy, compassionate girl, he had made her his main target because he knew that hurting
Willow would kill Buffy.</p>

<p>There was no way she was going to put her beloved little red
haired, green eyed witch girl in that kind of danger ever again. It was bad enough that
she ran around playing research girl for the gang and the danger that entailed, to expose
her to any more was unthinkable. She knew that if she'd allowed Willow to come to the
showers with her there was no way she could have controlled herself. To avoid that she
took a chance that Willow's feelings might be hurt in order to keep her safe and refused
to let her best friend help even though her need was obvious. The pain in those incredible
green eyes had torn Buffy's heart out but it had to be done.</p>

<p>The badly injured Slayer eventually made it to the showers,
thankfully they were empty probably due to the late hour. She stepped into the nearest
stall and carefully shrugged out of her robe and hung it on a hook. It took several
minutes for her to get her underwear off ,the effort left her out of breath and more than
a little dizzy.</p>

<p>&lt;Good thing Wills can't see me like this.&gt; Buffy
thought to herself&nbsp; &lt;I'd never get a minute of peace. The girl just worries too
much.&gt;</p>

<p>She turned on the water adjusting the temperature to just
below scalding, Buffy leaned against the wall and let the hot water spray over battered
body. As she stood under the spray she noticed her vision blurring around the edges then
her stomach did a slow forward roll and she felt light headed.</p>

<p>&lt;Oh gods no&gt; she thought realizing she was in serious
trouble. &lt;Willow, HELP ME!!&gt;</p>

<p>That was the last coherent thought that went through Buffy's
mind before everything faded to black and she collapsed in a heap on the shower stall
floor.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Willow sat on the edge of her bed
eyeing the door anxiously waiting for Buffy's return. She chewed on her bottom lip
nervously and her mind wandered back to the alluring vision of Buffy standing there in her
under wear looking so battered and hurt yet acting so tough and Slayery Willow wanted to
take Buffy into her arms and hold her close and kiss her until all the bad stuff went
away. She wanted it so bad it hurt.</p>

<p>&lt;Stop it Willow!&gt; she yelled at herself. &lt;Keep
talking like that and you'll lose her forever and you know you couldn't live with
that.&gt; After several minutes she began wondering what was taking Buffy so long. Usually
she was back long before now.</p>

<p>&lt;Oh well she did have a rough night I'll be....&gt;</p>

<p>Suddenly a blinding white pain burst into Willow's mind
blocking out all other
thoughts.</p>

<p>&lt;Willow help me!!&gt; slammed into her consciousness like
a
sledgehammer.</p>

<p>She knew instinctively that Buffy was in trouble. Without the
slightest hesitation she launched her self off the bed and out the door. Slamming through
the shower room door Willow began searching the room for her friend, while calling her
name.</p>

<p>Panic began rising in her when Buffy failed to answer. Then
she heard the water running. Hurrying toward the sound she called to her missing friend
getting no answer Willow pushed open the stall door and froze. A horrified gasp escaped
her throat when she saw Buffy lying motionless on the floor.</p>

<p>Willow jumped into the stall, after shutting off the water
she knelt down next to the Slayer. After trying to rouse her by calling her name and
shaking her unsuccessfully, Willow decided to move Buffy out of the confined area. Somehow
she was able to get Buffy's unconscious body out to one of the long benches and began to
gently dry Buffy off and get her robe wrapped around her.</p>

<p>She still couldn't wake Buffy and she knew there was no way
she was going to be able to get beloved roommate to their room without help. She ran down
the hall and got their old friend Larry and had him carry Buffy to their
room.</p>

<p>&#147;You want me to call 9-1-1?&#148; he asked as he
carefully laid Buffy on her bed.</p>

<p>&#147;No Larry I'll handle it from here.&#148; Willow said
sounding a lot more confident than she truly felt. &quot;Thanks for your
help&quot;</p>

<p>&#147;Hey no big Will&#148; Larry said glancing worriedly at
Buffy's unnaturally still form &#147;If you need me for anything at all call me you have
my phone and pager numbers.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Sure Larry don't worry we'll be alright.&#148; Willow
said giving him a hug.</p>

<p>Without another word she turned around and began fussing over
her friend, Larry quietly slipped out of the room.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>After a brief struggle Willow finally managed to get Buffy
into a nightshirt and underwear. While she was dressing the unconscious girl she noticed a
long partially healed gash on the inside of Buffy's upper arm. She also noticed that the
flesh around the gash was swollen and a dark angry red.</p>

<p>After getting Buffy settled into bed Willow called Giles and
filled him on the situation. He assured her that she had done the right thing and he would
be there as soon he picked up some things he felt were necessary to take care of the
Slayer. Hanging up the phone Willow drug a chair over to Buffy's bed and sat down to wait
and watch over her best friend.</p>

<p>&lt;Cause that's what friends do&gt; she rationalized. But
she knew deep down the real reason was she loved this person too much to trust her care to
someone else&#146;s hands. &lt;Because that's what lovers do, they cared for their loved
one when they were too sick to care for themselves&gt;.</p>

<p>Willow let out a sigh and took Buffy's limp hand and held it
between hers. &lt;This way she'll feel me here and know she's not alone&gt; Willow closed
her eyes and said a silent prayer to the Goddess on behalf of her beloved.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Buffy's eyes fluttered open her first sight was an angelic
vision of her best friend.</p>

<p>Willow was looking down at her the light shone from behind
her reflecting off her red hair causing a kind of halo effect that made Buffy's heart skip
a beat. Her brow was furrowed with worry and her incredible green eyes were filled with
concern and compassion. In all it was the most beautiful sight Buffy had ever seen.</p>

<p>&#147;Hey you.&#148; Willow said softly &#147;You just rest,
Giles is on his way. And I AM taking care of you,&#148; Willow paused, as if expecting
Buffy to protest, when none came, &#147;so don't worry.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No worries Wills.&#148; Buffy said weakly as a slight
smile played across her lips. &#147;See, I knew if I could get home my Wills would take
care of me.&#148;</p>

<p>Before Willow could respond Giles came rushing through the
door followed closely by a tall dark man she had never seen before. Giles went straight to
Buffy's bed and sat down on the edge across from Willow. He immediately began asking
questions of his surrogate daughters trying to asses the extent of Buffy's illness.
&#147;How long have you had this?&#148; Giles asked sternly after Willow called his
attention to the wound on Buffy's arm.</p>

<p>&#147;Oh I don't know ...about a week&#148; she replied
barely able to speak. &#147;I got it the night I fought that slime demon the vamps called
up.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yes well you know you really must keep me informed when
this kind of thing happens.&#148; Giles scolded her quietly. &#147;How am I supposed to
know what you need if you don't keep me apprised.&#148;</p>



<p>&#147;Giles,&#148; Willow growled menacingly &#147;Not
now.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yes...well&#133;ah&#133;quite right.&#148; Giles
stammered cleaning his glasses surprised at the normally shy quiet girls intensity and
more than a little embarrassed by his insensitive lecture.</p>

<p>The forgotten stranger clearing his throat and calling to
Giles interrupted the awkward moment.</p>

<p>&#147;Ah, who is he?&#148; Willow asked defensively,
&#147;and why have you brought him here?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yes, where are my manners?&#148; Giles began &#147;This
is Dr. Jeffery Fallon I've known him for several years. He is a fully qualified physician,
but he has made caring for supernatural beings his specialty. I am sure Buffy and her less
than normal injury fall well into that category.&#148;</p>

<p>The doctor bowed to Willow in recognition of her relationship
to the Slayer and set his bag down on the bed next to Buffy. When Willow refused to move
out of the doctor&#146;s way he looked at Giles for
help.</p>

<p>Willow shot Giles a threatening look, normally she trusted
Giles completely but this was Buffy and that changed all the rules. She tightened her grip
on Buffy&#146;s hand, silently challenging the two men.</p>

<p>&#147;It's alright Wills.&#148; Buffy said softly knowing how
Willow felt, since she felt the same way about the Witch. &#147;You know Giles would never
hurt us.&#148; She finished, the weakness in the Slayer's voice causing it to fade out.</p>

<p>&#147;Quite so.&#148; Giles said
firmly.</p>

<p>&lt;She's like some jungle cat protecting its&#146; mate&gt;
he imagined he could almost hear her growling a warning.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Willow released Buffy's hand and moved back but
only as far as her bed. She sat tensely on the edge watching the doctor's every move,
muscles coiled and ready to jump to Buffy's defense at the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>The doctor examined Buffy thoroughly, most of the things he
did and the equipment he used Willow recognized as normal medical procedure but some of it
looked like it was straight out of one those cheesy sci-fi movies Xander was always
watching.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity to Willow the doctor
straightened up and put his equipment away, as soon as he moved Willow was back sitting
beside her and holding her hand.</p>

<p>The doctor and Giles walked over to the other side of the
small room and began quietly consulting. They were making Willow nervous by the way that
every few minutes one or the other would look over at the two young women. The young Witch
did her best to ignore the two men by concentrating on Buffy.&nbsp; The little Slayer
seemed to be fading in and out of awareness-unable to stay completely conscious for more
than a few seconds at a time.</p>

<p>&#147;Thank you Jeffery.&#148; Giles said shaking hands with
the doctor. &#147;Be sure to give my regards to the Abbot.&#148;</p>

<p>The man held up his hand then turned to the two young women
bowed turned and went out the door closing it quietly behind him.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Giles returned to Buffy's bedside carrying a small package
the doctor had given him. He opened the package and pulled put it's contents. It was an
antique looking glass syringe with a long thin needle and a vial of green fluid that
glowed eerily in the dimly lit room. Giles filled the syringe with the thick liquid and
began swabbing Buffy's arm with alcohol preparing to inject her when he heard a low growl.</p>

<p>He looked up to see Willow glaring threateningly at him, her
green eyes drilling into his soul causing him to shiver slightly. He shivered slightly as
he felt a twinge of guilt knowing the girl was recalling his part in the Slayers test.
Plus, for the first time since he had known the shy young Witch he also felt real fear-the
person before him was not the Willow he knew-the person before him would do anything to
protect her.... Friend.</p>

<p>&#147;It is&nbsp; a compound.&#148; He began to explain
sheepishly, &#147;it is to enhance her Slayer healing abilities.&#148; The green eyes
continued to bore into him, &#147;I would kill myself before I would ever hurt her again!
Willow, you simply must believe me&#148; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&#147;Yeah? Whatever.&#148; Willow snapped. Giles taking that
as permission carefully slipped the needle into his daughter's arm and gave her the
injection. Shuttering at the memory of doing this same thing to her at the councils
orders-what a fool he had been.</p>

<p>&lt;What is wrong with me?&gt; Willow berated herself &lt;I
know nobody cares more about Buffy than Giles. But, he was tricked by the Council last
time.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Well he won't survive being tricked again&gt; a dark
steely voice said from the deepest darkest recesses of her mind. &lt;No one is going to
hurt MY Buffy again!&gt;</p>

<p>Willow shocked herself with those possessive and violent
thoughts.</p>

<p>But, her attention was immediately drawn back to her love
when Buffy sighed deeply, Willow could tell the Slayer was falling into a soft peaceful
rest.</p>

<p>Both the Watcher and the Witch kept a loving eye on her until
they were sure she was safely asleep.</p>

<p>&#147;She should rest now&#148; Giles explained. &#147;The
doctor said that it appears to be some sort of demonic infection. She shows all the
symptoms of a high fever and an elevated white cell count but physically she has neither.
It apparently attacks through her metaphysical
abilities.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;What can we do?&#148; Willow implored the ex-watcher,
&#147;There must be something I can do instead of just sitting here holding her
hand.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Actually that is exactly what she needs,&#148; Giles
informed her. &#147;I tried to contact her mother but Joyce is on some business trip for
the gallery and will out of communication for a week or more.&#148;</p>

<p>So sitting here letting her know she is not alone is as
important as any other thing you can do. You know she would rather have you here than
anyone else she knows.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;If you say so Giles.&#148; Willow said softly, &#147;I
will stay here and take care of her. Will you please inform my professors that I'll not be
in class until further notice and that I'll send in any required work via e-mail?&#148;</p>



<p>&#147;If you wish Willow,&#148; Giles said realizing that any
argument would be futile. &#147;I will come by or have Xander come by later to give you a
break.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No&#148; Willow said flatly. &#147;Just bring me my
class work and food. I'm taking care of Buffy; I don&#146;t trust anyone else. Don't let
anyone come,&nbsp; besides Giles. I won&#146;t have the time or patience to deal with
Xander and his inane babble.&#148;</p>

<p>Giles looked deep into those green eyes and saw the love in
them. Willow&#146;s feelings were pure primal instinct and he knew better than to doubt
what she said.</p>

<p>&#147;As you say, Willow.&#148; Giles said softly and handed
her a small black box with a red button &#147;This is an emergency pager, if you need me
for any reason press that button. I will be here as fast as I can, I will even sleep with
it.&#148;</p>



<p>&#147;Alright Giles,&#148; Willow said then grabbed his wrist
with a surprisingly strong grip and looked into his eyes. &#147;Please find a way to make
her better. I can't lose her, I can't live without her.&#148;
</p>

<p>&#147;I will I promise&#148; Giles whispered reverently.</p>

<p>Normally he would have scorned such theatrics but he knew
Willow well enough that he believed every word she said. He quietly left the room. As he
closed the door he took one last look and saw Willow lean forward and gently kiss Buffy's
forehead then settle back into the chair still holding Buffy's hand.</p>

<p>&#147;I will find a cure Willow&#148; Giles said under his
breath inspired by the beautiful young woman's devotion to her friend. &#147;Even if it
kills me I will find it. I will not be the cause of you losing your love.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Giles slammed the ancient book shut and in anger and
frustration threw it across the room. It had been nearly a week and still Buffy was no
better in fact despite of the injections she was getting progressively worse. His
inability to help her enraged him and the look of agony and
fear in Willow's eyes every time he failed to report a cure
was killing his soul.</p>

<p>&#147;Damn it!&#148; he raged, &#147;All that great Watcher
training was worthless. All these fabulous resources and they can not even tell me how to
cure a simple bloody bug.&#148; He glared at the stack of books he had already gone with
disgust, for a moment he considered setting fire to the entire lot.</p>

<p>&lt;Get a hold on yourself old man&gt; he berated himself.
&lt;They&#146;re your only chance at finding the cure you promised Willow. And you&#146;d
better find it fast&#133;if you don't you&#146;ll lose them both. &gt; Giles took off his
glasses and began cleaning them then with a sigh of resignation he turned back to a stack
of books he hadn't checked yet, chose one and returned to work.</p>

<p>He had to succeed, there was no alternative.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Willow wept quietly as she watched over the frail body of the
person she loved most in the world. Buffy was lying on the bed wasting away. So far no one
was able to help her. The sun had long set and soon the full moon of the equinox would
rise.</p>

<p>The young Witch wiped at her tears, stood and walked over to
the window. The sun had long since set and soon the full moon and the Vernal Equinox
occurred simultaneously. At the fringes of her mind she seemed to recall an ancient Celtic
legend involving this occurrence and a sect of Druid warrior-priests that were also
powerful wizards. She tried to recall the story if for no other reason than to occupy
herself.</p>

<p>All other thoughts were erased from her mind when she heard
Buffy begin to moan and thrash weakly.</p>

<p>&#147;It's alright Buffy&#148; Willow said softly.
&#147;I&#146;m right here.&#148;</p>

<p>Soon Buffy seemed to fall back to sleep so Willow was able to
relax enough to go back to the window and observe the strange weather. The sky was crystal
clear with the stars shining brightly.&nbsp; The full moon was rising in the black velvet
sky, its mystical light turning the dark night almost into day.</p>

<p>But, what drew Willow's attention were the flashes of
blue-white lightening that streaked the across the brightening sky.&nbsp; Witch felt a
faint tingle of some indefinable, though familiar, energy teasing her senses.</p>

<p>A sudden and shocking clap of thunder shook the
dorm--rattling the windows.</p>

<p>The distraught slayer sat-up screaming, her eyes searching
the room for Willow.</p>

<p>&#147;Willow !&#148; she cried in an anguished voice.</p>

<p>&#147;I'm right here Buffy,&#148; Willow said. She reached
out her hand to touch the Slayer on her shoulder, trying to reassure her friend.
&#147;Your Wills isn't going anywhere&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No! Wills they know&#148; the delirious Slayer said
panic rising in her voice, &#147;they found out and now they're coming.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Who Buffy? Who found out?&#148; she asked patiently &#147;and
what did they find out.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh Wills,&#148; Buffy cried &#147;I tried so hard to
hide it from them but now they know and they're on their way here now!&#148;</p>

<p>Lightening was striking faster and closer and the moon neared
it's zenith illuminating the room with it's soft light.</p>

<p>&#147;I've got to stop them.&#148; Buffy cried, desperation
and panic causing her voice up an octave</p>

<p>&#147;Who is it Buffy?&#148; Willow asked in a soft soothing
voice. &#147;Tell me who's coming.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;All of them.&#148; Buffy said tears beginning to flow
from her eyes &#147;The Master, Angelus, Spike, the demons, all of them.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;But Buffy their they're all dead or gone&#148; Willow
tried to convince her friend, &#147;Why would they come back?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh Wills, they've come back because they know how to
hurt me.&#148; Buffy sobbed, fear and panic pushing her tears. &#147;They know I love you
and they're coming after you. They're going to get you because they know I can't live
without you. I've got to stop them!&#148;</p>

<p>Willow was stunned unable to speak or react. After all this
time trying to hide her feelings for fear of rejection and possibly driving Buffy away and
now when Buffy was so sick that she was delirious, now she finds out that Buffy felt the
same way all along.</p>

<p>&#147;It's alright Buffy I l-love you too.&#148; Willow said
softly her voice quivering.</p>

<p>&#147;I know that Wills, I've known for a long time&#148;
Buffy stated. &#147;I couldn't tell anyone, not even you because if anyone knew about my
feelings you would've been in more danger! Oh God, I can&#146;t lose you.&#148;</p>



<p>Willow was so stunned she didn&#146;t know how to
react, all this time her friend had not only felt the same urges and desires as Willow,
but she had known all along how Willow would have returned her feelings. She didn't know
whether to be angry or sad.</p>

<p>Even though it angered her that Buffy had known all along and
had denied her the love she'd ached for--she also knew that meant the Slayer had also been
forced to deny herself the same love. Tears filled her eyes as she thought of how many
times Buffy must have yearned to seek comfort in Willow's embrace only to force down her
feelings to protect her friend.</p>

<p>&#147;Willow you've got to hide!&#148; Buffy implored, still
deep in her delirium. &#147;They're coming. I don't know how they found out. Angelus knew,
he must have told them.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow tried to push her seriously ill friend back down in
the bed. For a few moments Willow forgot that a sick Buffy was still a very powerful
Slayer. Without warning Buffy exploded out of the bed unintentionally knocking Willow
across the room. Before Willow could react Buffy was swaying in the middle of the room,
searching the corners for demons.</p>

<p>&#147;Got to stop them before they can hurt my Wills!&#148;
Buffy cried, &#147;I can&#146;t see them. Where are they?&#148; She then ran out of the
room before Willow could react.</p>

<p>&#147;Buffy no!&#148; Willow yelled as her friend disappeared
out the door either not hearing or ignoring her all together. Willow leapt up from the
floor and pressed the button on Giles emergency pager then ran after her friend as fast as she could. As she
ran down the stairs Willow heard the exit door slam shut &#147;Oh goddess protect
her,&#148; Willow prayed as she sprinted down the stairs and as she went out the door the young witch began chanting a
tracking spell.</p>

<p>A flash of white let Willow know that Buffy had run into the
woods toward the center of the Hellmouth. A faint blue glowing line showed her Buffy's
trail as the result of her spell. Lightening flashed wildly across the crystal clear sky
and Willow noticed a thick unnatural fog
rising from the ground. As Willow followed the trail that was
leading her to Buffy she wondered how Buffy could run so fast through these thick woods
without hurting herself.</p>

<p>&lt;Must be a Slayer thing&gt; she thought to herself.</p>

<p>Soon Willow could hear the unmistakable sounds of fighting
close ahead. She burst out of the trees into a clearing that was brightly illuminated by
the huge full moon. She gasped in horror when saw what was happening. In the middle of the
clearing was Buffy fighting three vampires and she wasn't doing so well. She was doing her
best but the Slayer was simply too weak from her prolonged illness. It was a credit to her
skills and training Buffy was able to 'dust' two of her supernatural opponents, but the
third one struck her from behind sending her sprawling across the clearing hitting the
ground hard forcing the air out of her lungs. Seeing that the Slayer was unable to get
back up the vampire let out a roar of victory and launched itself at its unmoving prey.</p>

<p>&#147;No!!!&#148; Willow screamed and nearly flew across the
grassy field to help her injured friend.</p>

<p>Willow moved faster than she'd ever had before and reached
Buffy a few steps ahead of the charging vampire without thinking she threw up her hand.</p>

<p>&#147;STOP!&#148; she commanded and the vampire stopped as if
he'd hit a wall.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of her eye Willow noticed the clearing was
enclosed in wall of thick white unnatural fog.</p>

<p>Buffy moaned softly and tried to get up but she only
succeeded in distracting Willow causing her to lose the barrier that held back the
vampire. The night creature sensed the absence of magic and started to spring on its&#146;
vulnerable victims.</p>

<p>&#147;Hold demon!&#148; a deep commanding voice boomed across
the clearing. A blinding bolt of bluish white light streaked through the air that struck
and enveloped the vampire who screamed in agony then burst into a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Willow was temporarily blinded by the bright explosion of
light, then as her vision cleared she saw three figures standing in front of her. They
were wearing gray robes with vests of heavy black leather and cowled hoods. Each carried
an ash staff covered in Celtic runes and long daggers hung from their braided cord belts. They were
surrounded by brightly glowing lights that flashed blue-green then red.</p>

<p>When they reached the two friends they pulled back the hoods
revealing their faces. Two were beautiful women that Willow guessed were about 25 or 30,
the third figure caught and held her attention. The third was a man, he wasn't tall or
particularly handsome but Willow found him irresistible and there was an ageless quality
about him, he had long, brown hair and a full beard both streaked with gray and a slight
smile that seemed permanent. But his most arresting feature were his kind hazel eyes that
seemed to glow with a light of their own.</p>

<p>&#147;Who are you?&#148; Willow asked finally her voice
squeaking from a mixture of curiousity and fear.</p>

<p>&#147;Relax little Wyccan,&#148; the man said, his deep
resonant voice wrapping around Willow like a warm comforting blanket. &#147;Our people
have been caring for your kind since the age of Chaos.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow didn't know why but she felt safe and secure. Her
eyelids became heavy and Willow felt herself drifting off.</p>

<p>&#147;What about the wizard?&#148; Willow heard one of the
women ask as she fell asleep.</p>

<p>&#147;He still denies his true nature,&#148; the man's voice
answered. &#147;We will have to return for him at another time. They need us more than he
does.&#148;</p>

<p>That was all Willow heard.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Giles had fallen into an exhausted sleep at his desk; it was
the first time he'd closed his eyes in nearly a week. It had been at least 4 days since
he'd showered or shaved. The only time he'd left his research was when he went to
Buffy&#146;s condition and give the Slayer her injection.</p>

<p>His concern for Buffy was balanced only by his admiration of
Willow. This crisis had certainly brought her out of her shell and revealed a strength of
personality and her iron will that Giles hadn&#146;t known had existed in the hacker.</p>

<p>She'd always been caring and compassionate but now she was
also strong and fiercely protective of her seriously ill best friend. The down side was
she was also suspicious and unforgiving of anyone that had ever hurt Buffy.</p>

<p>Giles knew she basically trusted him on one level but on
another more instinctual level he fell into the second category. He could see it in her
eyes every time he gave the Slayer her injection; he had made one mistake he'd followed
the Council's orders. And that would condemn him to live forever without the Witch's
trust. The Ripper side of him wanted to scream and rage at Willow that he would never hurt
Buffy again-but the other side, the ashamed side of him, felt he deserved her fury.</p>

<p>He was suddenly jolted out of his sleep by a loud obnoxious
beeping. Growling with irritation he sat up pulled off his glasses and rubbed his aching
eyes. Then he remembered the beeping and realized it was his emergency pager.</p>

<p>&#147;Oh my god&#148; he groaned. &#147;How long has this
been going off?&#148; He grabbed the pager and shut it off then hurriedly phoned the girls
room. Panic started to rise in him when no one answered. He snatched up his keys and
grabbed a well-worn leather jacket putting it on as he dashed from his apartment.</p>



<p>He reached the dorms in record time, slammed the car into
park and launched himself out of the door almost before the car stopped rolling. Giles
burst through the doors of the dorm ran up the steps taking them two at a time. When he
reached the girl's floor he ran down the hall and came to a sliding stop in front of their
door.</p>

<p>He knocked on the door pushing it open further,
&#147;Willow... Buffy is every thing alright?&#148; Giles asked as he opened the door and
stepped into the room. &#147;Oh god no.&#148; He froze for a second when he saw the empty
room, that in itself was bad enough, but as he surveyed the room he saw evidence of a
violent struggle.</p>

<p>&#147;Where are they?&#148; he asked himself out loud the
answer came to him instantly. &#147;The Hellmouth!&#148; In an adrenaline rush Giles
charged out the door and ran down the hall to the stairs. He barely touched the stairs as
he ran down them and out the back door unknowingly following the same path the girls had
taken.</p>

<p>When he got outside his naturally magic sensitive eyes picked
up the pale blue glow of Willow's tracking spell. Recognizing it for what it was he
immediately began following it. &#147;Bless her Wyccan skills.&#148; Giles muttered as he
entered the woods knowing he was following the right path thanks to his favorite redheaded
witch.</p>

<p>When he reached the clearing the smell of death and ozone
nearly over powered him. He could tell his girls had been there and fought some kind of
battle. Giles searched the clearing frantically some evidence of their whereabouts. He
found evidence of a fight and the three mounds of dust that used to be vampires, but no
other sign of his daughters.</p>

<p>Willow's spell obviously ended here and he could tell
that no one had left the clearing by any conventional means. So where were they? Giles
fell to his knees in pain and horror realizing they had simply disappeared from this spot
and it took something a lot more powerful than a vampire or demon to do that.</p>

<p>&#147;Oh god please&#148; Giles moaned in total
despair. &#147;I have failed them again.&#148;</p>

<p>He fell the rest of the way to the ground, his mind numbed
with guilt and self-loathing. Giles lay in the grassy field for hours berating himself for
his lack of talent and his inability to properly care for the two young women fate had
placed in his charge.</p>

<p>Just before sunrise Giles felt a gentle warm breeze
brush his face and his nose picked up the sweet spicy smell of the Slayer's perfume
combined with the subtle earthy herbal scent that Willow wore.</p>

<p>&lt;Fear not Watcher, &gt; a deep resonant voice said in his
mind, A voice he more felt than heard. &lt;The Chosen One and the Wyccan are safe and will
return to you in time. &gt;</p>

<p>For some reason Giles knew he could trust the voice
completely and his spirits rose with the sun.&nbsp; He got to his feet went home and after
a long needed shower and shave he collapsed into his bed and fell into a deep dreamless
sleep</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Willow's eyes opened slowly, her mind was a complete blank,
she yawned and stretched feeling rested and completely relaxed for the first time since
Buffy got sick.</p>

<p>&#147;Oh no Buffy!&#148; Willow gasped and bolted up
remembering her best friend's serious condition and the shape she was in when Willow saw
her last.</p>

<p>&#147;Be calmed little one,&#148; a soothing female voice
told her, a warm soft hand touched her shoulder. &#147;Your beloved is resting quietly in
another room. The sister of my soul watches over her.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow felt a warm comforting feeling spread throughout her
body from the hand. She looked over and was mesmerized by what she saw. Seated next to the
bed was the most serenely beautiful woman Willow had ever seen. She was wearing white gown
with an emerald green cloak held by a pair of silver swan clasps at her throat. Her long
softly shining blonde hair hung to her waist. She had flawless soft white skin and wore a
compassionate caring smile on her full sensuous red lips, but her eyes were the feature
that held Willow's attention.</p>

<p>They were a pale grayish blue like crystal clear bottomless
pools that seemed to glow with their own soft light. Willow felt drawn into them letting
them wash away all her cares and sorrows. The woman had an air of grace and elegance about
her that made even the simple rocking chair she was sitting in seem like a throne.</p>

<p>&#147;What?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; How?&#148; Willow stammered
confused.</p>

<p>&#147;All fine questions&#148; The woman said with an amused
smile. &#147;And they will be answered soon, but first rise and refresh yourself. We have
replaced your soiled apparel and when you are ready I will take you to see your
beloved.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Ah...okay&#148; Willow said stunned and more than a
little confused. Willow slid out the bed followed as the woman showed her where the bath
was.</p>

<p>&#147;Pull the bell cord when you are ready and I will return
to take you to the one you wish to see&#148; the woman said as she left.</p>

<p>Willow heard the door close and looked around the large
bathroom amazed by what she saw. Everything was exactly the way Willow had it at home only
on a larger scale. The bath water was hot and scented with the perfect combination of oils
and herbs for her. Even the soaps and perfumes were all Willow's favorites. It was kind of
spooky but not in a bad way.</p>

<p>When Willow was finished she reentered the bedroom and found
a new set of clothes laid out for her on the bed. As she put them on Willow was impressed
by the quality and intricate workmanship of each article. There were of course the normal
undergarments but the rest were anything but normal at least for Willow's century.</p>

<p>There was a long dark green velvet gown that nearly reached
the floor, a pair of soft leather slippers, and a long green cloak like the woman had been
wearing but with pentagram clasps instead of swans. To her further surprise everything fit
perfectly.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't help it she just had to look in the mirror.
She almost didn't recognize her own reflection; she looked like a picture out of one of
Giles' medieval books. She stopped staring at herself and forced herself back to the
matters at hand. She pulled the bell cord she'd been shown and almost instantly there was
a knock on her door.</p>

<p>&#147;Come in&#148; Willow called out.</p>

<p>The door opened and the woman stepped in. &#147;Is everything
to your liking?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p>&#147;It's perfect.&#148; Willow replied then added,
&#147;except for one thing.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;What is that?&#148; the woman asked with genuine
concern.</p>

<p>&#147;What do I call you?&#148; Willow asked &#147;I mean
'Hey you' just doesn't seem right and after all you've done for us and 'ma'am' seems a
little too impersonal.&#148;</p>

<p>A smile lit up the woman's face and her lyrical laugh seemed
to fill the air.</p>

<p>&#147;I suppose we have not been properly introduced, but in
truth we have done little for you&#148; she began, then paused as if considering the best
way to phrase her answer. &#147;However to answer your question at the time of my calling
I was known as Brigit though I have not heard that name for quite some time but it will do
for now.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Okay Brigit&#148; Willow said. &#147;You did say
something about going to see Buffy.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;As you wish.&#148; Brigit said then warned,
&#147;Before we go you should know we are unable to cure the Chosen One. We have halted
the progress of the ailment and she is sleeping peacefully without pain, but she is no
better and her infirmity is apparent so do not be shocked by her appearance.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Ah...okay so can I go see her now.&#148; Willow
persisted.</p>

<p>&#147;Certainly little one.&#148; Brigit said calmly
&#147;Come with me.&#148;</p>

<p>She led Willow through the door and down a long marble
hallway. After passing several large iron bound doors Brigit came to a stop at huge door
with an intricate silver hexmark on it. She knocked and ushered Willow through the
somewhat intimidating doorway announcing their arrival. Willow looked around the room
amazed at its size.</p>

<p>Her gaze stopped when it reached the over sized bed in the
center of the room,</p>

<p>Lying in the middle of the bed propped up on pillows was the
center of Willow's universe. Buffy was covered with a large fluffy looking bright red and
silver comforter. A heart-wrenching sob escaped Willow's lips when she saw how small and
frail her normally strong and healthy friend looked in the huge bed.</p>

<p>Her skin was pale and drawn making her bones protrude and her
cheeks hollow, the circles under her eyes were so dark it looked as if someone had beaten
her. Willow ran to the bed. &#147;Oh Buffy what have I done?&#148; Willow sobbed,
&#147;Why can't I heal you?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Perhaps that is something we should discuss,&#148; a
man's deep voice said from behind her. &#147;Among other things.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow turned and came face to face with the man from the
night before in the clearing. He was still wearing the long gray robes and was still as
impressive as before.</p>

<p>Those shining hazel eyes seemed to look straight into her
soul and saw her every secret.</p>

<p>&#147;Who are you?&#148; Willow demanded, amazed at her own
audacity.</p>

<p>He smiled at her. &#147;All will be answered soon my
child,&#148; he said his warm soft voice filling her mind. &#147;Come with me and we will
explore your questions and possibly find the answers you seek.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>Willow tore her eyes away from the man's hypnotic gaze and
looked back at her unconscious friend.</p>

<p>&#147;No&#148; she said adamantly, &#147;I won't leave my
Buffy.&#148; It was a statement, not an argument or request.</p>

<p>&#147;I will care for your other half,&#148; replied a husky
female voice.</p>

<p>Willow looked toward this new voice and saw a shockingly
beautiful and exotic looking woman stepped out of a shadowed alcove. The first thing
Willow noticed about this new comer was her fiery red hair that fell in a wild cascade of
waves and curls to just past her shoulders. She was wearing a black leather tunic trimmed
with silver Celtic knot work over a dark blue knee length dress and knee high leather
boots. Hanging from her belt were two long silver dirks their handles looked worn with
constant use.</p>

<p>Her smoky green eyes seemed to take in everything without
ever breaking their contact with Willow That combined with the cat like grace of her
movements and her strong white teeth that flashed when she smiled gave her a feral
predatory look the exact opposite of Brigit.</p>

<p>&#147;We must talk,&#148; the man said. &#147;We won't go far
I promise. Nothing will happen to her with Morrigan watching over her.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow looked from Morrigan to Brigit to the man and back
again, she was confused and very worried about Buffy.</p>

<p>&#147;I give you my oath; nothing will happen to your other
half while she is under my protection,&#148; Morrigan said quietly, with a steel edge
voice.</p>

<p>The young girl's mind suddenly flashed on an image of warrior
standing tall on a battlefield-but instead of Morrigan's face the warrior had Buffy's.</p>

<p>&#147;I guess that's okay.&#148; Willow said unsure but
something in the back of her mind was telling her to trust these unusual people and that
little voice had never been wrong.</p>

<p>&#147;Good, please come with me.&#148; he said, &#147;we will
be just outside.&#148;</p>

<p>He led her outside into a large tree filled courtyard in the
center of which was a small fountain surrounded by stone tables with benches. He chose one
on the sunny side of the fountain. Willow sat down opposite him and looked around in
wonder.</p>

<p>There were trees and flowers of all kinds all around. There
were birds and other wildlife some that Willow saw she knew to be extinct. When the man
sat down a huge raven flew down and landed on his shoulder.</p>

<p>They sat quietly for a few moments drinking in the peaceful
beauty of their surroundings storing the memory for later more turbulent times. Something
was tugging at the fringes of Willow's mind, something about these people and this place.
Just as she was about to confront the man Brigit came out caring a large silver tray
filled with fresh fruit three glasses and a pitcher.</p>

<p>&#147;Eat child,&#148; the man said. &#147;Enjoy the Earth
mother's gifts.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;The meade too little one.&#148; Brigit added &#147;It
will strengthen you for what lies ahead.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Thank you&#148; Willow said taking a sip of the potent
liquid &#147;This is really good.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow savored the sweet honey aftertaste as the warmth of
the meade flowed through her body. Brigit smiled at her and she felt the warm spring
sunshine in that smile.</p>

<p>Brigit sat down at the end of the bench and Willow gasped
when a huge, shaggy gray wolf padded over sat down next to the woman and began nuzzling
her hand demanding attention.</p>

<p>&#147;Now is the time little one.&#148; Brigit said
absent-mindedly scratching the wolf's ears. &#147;Ask Lugh your questions.&#148;</p>

<p>At the mention of the mention of the man's name Willow's mind
clicked and she remembered where she'd heard the names before.</p>

<p>&#147;Lugh!&#148; Willow choked out her eyes wide with
surprise and disbelief &#147;That means...you are...this is...you can't...&#148;</p>

<p>The man she now knew as Lugh smiled at her surprise and
confusion, he held up a hand to stop her verbal melt down.</p>

<p>&#147;You are remarkably well informed child.&#148; Lugh
began &#147;You apparently have heard of us.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Heard of you...yes&#148; Willow blurted out. &#147;Your
legends...gods even!&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No child not gods.&#148; Lugh assured her. &#147;We are
as human as you and your friend in there. We are merely well educated and trained in the
ways of our kind.&#148;</p>



<p>&#147;What is your kind?&#148; Willow asked a little calmer,
&#147;Are you immortals? I've heard of them.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No, not immortals&quot; Lugh said smiling at her amused
at the girl's undeniable curiosity.</p>

<p>&#147;It is this place. Long ago our people saw the need for
our people to have a sanctuary away from your world so using ancient and powerful magiks
and combining our talents this place was created. It does not exist on your plane it is
adjacent to your world but only we know how to part the veil that separates our planes
allowing us to go back and forth as necessary.&#148; Lugh stopped long enough to take a
drink.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since he had talked this much and his
throat was parched.</p>

<p>&#147;Others created many legends and folk lore about us, I
have heard most of them. The truth however is much more mundane,&#148; he continued.
&#147;It seems that when we created this place there was a side effect no one had
anticipated.&#148;</p>



<p>Lugh stopped again to get a drink from the tall glass goblet
that Brigit kept filled.</p>

<p>Willow could hear the strain in his voice.</p>

<p>&#147;You see time as you know it does not exist here&#148;
Lugh resumed. &#147;We have done many tests some with dire consequences to learn the laws
that rule this plane. Here we do not age. So when the time comes for those of us with the
calling must enter your world we have not changed. People misunderstood and thought we
were more than we truly are. Eventually superstition being what it is people came to think
of us as gods, a title we neither seek nor want.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Okay so this place must be....&#148; Willow began
knowing but not believing.</p>

<p>&#147;Yes child we have brought you and your friend to Teach
Tu Danann&#148; Lugh told her.</p>

<p>Willow speechless, she had read some obscure legends of this
place, never much because of the lack of written history about the Druids and their
beliefs.</p>



<p>&#147;I never had any idea this place could possibly
exist.&#148; Willow said once her brain began to grasp what she'd just been told.
&quot;Everything, all the writings were so vague.&quot;</p>

<p>&#147;That was not an accident my child.&#148; We did not
want to give the outside world too many clues and it worked.&#148; Lugh sighed softly,
&#147;but now we have been forced to once again to come into direct contact with your
world because of you and the Chosen One.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Why? What can you do to cure her?&#148; Willow demanded
hopefully &#147;Is that why we're here?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;All in it's time child..&#148; Lugh said cryptically.</p>

<p>&#147;Lugh! Really were you never young?&#148; Brigit scolded
him softly then explained to Willow &#147;No, little we can not cure her. We can only halt
the progress of the affliction the demon caused. We have saved her life but we cannot cure
it and what you must know is that it has progressed much further than we knew. If a cure
is not given soon her soul will be released and with that the fate of your world will be
sealed.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Quite true&#148; Lugh interrupted. &#147;Let me explain
a little history and maybe you will better understand our dilemma.&#148;</p>

<p>Alright I'm listening.&quot; Willow said with far more
confidence than she felt.</p>

<p>They all three took a deep drink of the potent meade, then
Lugh looked deep into Willow's eyes capturing and holding them with his eerily glowing
hazel orbs.</p>

<p>&#147;Since the way to spin a tale is from the beginning that
is where I shall begin.&#148; Lugh said, his deep voice, and lyrical accent reassured
Willow, and helped her relax and absorb what he was saying. &#147;Let us begin with the
dawn of creation.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Lugh's voice filled Willow's mind with pictures of times long
past as he continued the history lesson.</p>

<p>&#147;From the beginning there have been two forces ruling
the natural universe,&#148; the Druid began. &#147;One is Light, representing order and
conformity. The other is Darkness, representing chaos and change. They fought each other
for control. The Old Ones kept them at bay until the younger gods of man came and exiled
the Old Ones to another plane. Since they understand nothing about balance man and their
gods aligned themselves with either the Light or the Darkness. The people who could walk in the day began to
fear the dark of the night instead of knowing it was just a time of rest. They ascribed
all sorts of dangers to the night. Finally, the balance was completely lost and a war
began with each side trying to subdue the other. Some of us however remembered the
teachings of the Old Ones and knew that a total victory for either side would mean the end
of the world.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;You see if the Light wins there is complete and total
order and the world would stagnate and die and if the Darkness wins the resulting total
chaos and destruction would send the world reeling into oblivion. Our kind has sworn to
maintain the proper balance between them. It's a simple equation actually, in order to
have peace and civilization you must have order, however you must also have a certain
amount of chaos so man will progress and evolve in to his next level.&#148;</p>

<p>Lugh stopped to take a drink, he had not talked this much in
a very long time and it was exhausting. He only hoped it was worth the trouble and the
young witch would understand what he was trying to tell her. He was beginning to become
fond of her. She reminded him of young Brigit with her soft gentle ways, the intelligent
light in her eyes, and her brave and noble spirit. He chuckled as he remembered the way
she had rushed to her friend's aid without regard for her own safety.</p>

<p>&#147;Okay, I understand so far,&#148; Willow said filling
the silence. &#147;But what does any of this got to do with us?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Fair enough.&#148; Lugh began again, Willow could hear
the strain in his voice &#147;I will skip over several thousand years of Druid history and
as you put it and get to the point. In order to limit the destruction caused by their
eternal conflict, the Old Ones laid a geas on the Light and the Darkness so that they can
not confront each other directly so they must use champions.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Right, so Buffy is the Chosen One the champion of the
Light. I already knew that now how do we fix her?&#148; Willow demanded.</p>

<p>&#147;Patience child&#148; Lugh said deflecting Willow's
impatience. &#147;You see the two powers are allowed to endow their champions with
incredible powers both physical and spiritual. The problem is that all that power forced
into one lesser being warped and twisted the soul until the being either released their
soul or became a babbling lunatic of no use to anyone. Darkness&#146; answer was to dole
out a certain amount of power to many warriors.</p>

<p>Light on the other hand decided to give a few of its
followers half the power either they got great physical prowess or tremendous spiritual
gifts. The physical half are always female, the others can be either gender.&#148; Lugh
could see the light of comprehension in Willow's eyes. &#147;That is correct my dear you
are the Slayer's other half.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;That is the truth little one&#148; Brigit added.
&#147;Just like Morrigan and myself. The ancient name for it was &#145;sisters of the
soul&#146; &#148;.</p>

<p>&#147;B-but how?&#148; Willow stammered surprised.</p>

<p>&#147;Most of it is fate, that is what brought the two of you
together and your intertwining destinies&#148; Lugh explained. &#147;However the taboos
placed upon you by your rather cold and narrow minded society and the forces of Darkness
have combined to keep you from acknowledging each other and bonding as was meant to
be.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;We would have waited for nature to take its course, as
is our way&#148; Brigit interjected, &#147;but when your other became ill almost to death
we knew we must, in order to preserve the balance, take direct action. So we came to get
you, although we were nearly too late.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I'm grateful for the rescue and I don't mean to sound
disrespectful.&#148; Willow interrupted desperate to understand, &#147;What does that have
to do with curing Buffy?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Think little one.&#148; Brigit instructed. &#147;She
has a demonic infection, that is an affliction of the soul. She needs her spiritual half
to cure it.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;But I've been there all along! I&#146;ve loved her all
this time&#148; Willow sobbed, afraid they were wrong, it couldn&#146;t be that easy.
&#147;Why didn't she get any better? Why did she get sick in the first place?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I can explain that better than Lugh can,&#148; Brigit
said taking Willow's hand onto her own soft warm ones. &#147;She did not get any better
because you have both denied your true feelings about each other for so long
&nbsp;you&#146;ve become blocked. You must confess your feelings for each other and
embrace your fates, together. Only then will you be able to cure her and restore her
strength, only then will you both be able to protect each other and the rest of
mankind.&#148;</p>

<p>Morrigan came up behind Brigit and wrapped her arms around
her, Brigit leaned back into the embrace and tilted her head back to meet her wild red
haired lover's lips. They shared a deep kiss then looked into each other's eyes. Willow
envied their closeness and the ease with which they openly displayed their affections she
found herself wishing that she and Buffy could be like them.</p>

<p>&#147;The sister of your soul is awake and asking for
you.&#148; Brigit said without breaking her eye contact with Morrigan. &#147;You know how
to cure her Willow, it is up to your love now.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p><![endif]>When Willow heard that Buffy was awake she leapt from the
bench and out of the room to go see her. Only to stop outside the door of Buffy's room, as
Brigit's last words rang in her ears. She took a deep breath trying to calm down before
Buffy saw her and knew something was up.</p>



<p>Taking another deep breath Willow walked quietly into Buffy's
room her entire body trembling with nervous fear at the ramifications of her new found
knowledge.</p>

<p>She approached the bed silently, almost hoping that Buffy had
fallen back to sleep so she'd have time to process the information she had just learned in
the garden.&nbsp; She needed time to map out a plan for the conversation she knew they
were about have.</p>

<p>&lt;Oh god-I need more time! &gt; Willow cried in her mind
when she found Buffy awake. She saw her friend's sunken blue eyes brighten when she saw
the Witch. &lt; That's a good sign. &gt; Willow tried to keep her babbling confined in her
mind, not let it leak out to her mouth.</p>

<p>&#147;Hey&#148; Buffy said softly, her voice too weak to
speak much above a whisper.</p>

<p>&#147;Hey yourself&#148; Willow answered forcing herself to
smile.</p>

<p>Buffy patted the mattress next to her.</p>

<p>&#147;Come on over Wills&#148; she said as brightly as she
could. Her voice was so weak it broke Willow's heart to see her strong proud friend so
fragile she couldn't speak above a whisper.</p>

<p>&#147;Sure&#148; Willow squeaked nervously.</p>

<p>&lt;Oh gods I can't do this. &gt; Willow thought as she
climbed into her friend's bed. &lt;But I have to for Buffy's sake&gt;</p>

<p>Willow started to settle on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>&#147;Please Wills over here next to me.&#148; Buffy pleaded,
&#147;I really need to feel you next to me right now.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow's breath caught when she heard the almost prophetic
statement Buffy had just made.</p>

<p>&#147;What's the matter Wills?&#148; Buffy asked at her
friends hesitation, a look of horror crossed her face. &#147;Oh my god! Did I do something
while I was out of it? I didn't hurt you did I Wills? Please tell me I didn't hurt you! Oh
God I couldn&#146;t live with that.&#148; The Slayer cried, hot tears beginning to run
down her pale face.</p>

<p>Willow jumped to Buffy's side and wrapped her arms around her
frail friend, hugging her tightly.</p>

<p>&#147;Hush now Buffy, of course you didn't hurt me.&#148;
Willow said reassuring Buffy and began rocking her gently and stroking her sobbing
friend's soft blonde hair. &#147;My Buffy would never hurt me but you very nearly got
yourself killed trying to protect me. Scared me half to death out running around slaying
when you were so sick. I was afraid I was going to lose you.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Don't you ever do that to me again. If anything
happened to you how would I be able to live without you. I love you Buffy and I have for a
long time.&#148;</p>

<p>It was such a release to finally tell Buffy, to say the words
out loud that Willow could feel all the anger and frustration rising to the surface
screaming to be let out.&nbsp; All those lonely hours of pacing the floor of their dorm
room waiting for her Slayer to come home from patrol-wondering if tonight was gong to be the night she wasn't going to make
it--combined with the stress of Buffy's prolonged illness pushed her past the breaking
point.</p>

<p>&#147;But Wills...&#148; Buffy sobbed.</p>

<p>&#147;NO! No! Don't even go there!&#148; Willow barked
realizing she was shouting. &#147;I will not be put off anymore. You thought you were
protecting me by refusing our love? You weren't!&#148; Willow continued unable to stop,
&#147;you were just being selfish and cruel. That is over as of now, I love you and you
love me and that's all that counts, and before you say it--the evil nasties, well we'll just have to face them together.&#148; Willow hugged
Buffy so tightly she thought her heard bones popping, &#147;together Buffy, you understand
me? Together!&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Don't yell at me Wills&#148; Buffy sobbed like a little
girl. &#147;I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.&#148;</p>

<p>Hearing Buffy's whispered apology Willow realized what she
had just said and how she had said it. Her face turned bright red embarrassed by her own
outburst. But then Buffy looked up into her face and started to giggle.</p>

<p>&#147;What?&#148; Willow asked. She couldn't help but smiling
along with her Buffy, all her embarrassment forgotten as soon as she saw the tiny blonde's
smile.</p>

<p>&#147;I like the assertive Willow.&#148; Buffy said softly,
talking was really becoming an effort. &#147;But you are still my shy little Wills and how
could I not love you for that?&#148;</p>

<p>Willow had to chuckle at her lover's words. She felt Buffy
take a huge breath and suddenly, something black and gross flew out of her mouth. When,
whatever it was left, her lover just seemed to melt back into her arms bonelessly.&nbsp;
Although the Witch could tell her Slayer was on the edge of loosing consciousness again,
she also knew Buffy would now recover.</p>

<p>&#147;I'm gettin&#146; really kinda tired.&#148; Buffy
sniffed, then yawned.</p>

<p>Willow started to move her so she could lay her down on the
pillows but stilled with her words. &#147;No please Wills stay with me. I don't want to be
alone and I really need to fall asleep in your arms so I know I didn&#146;t dream
it.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I love you, Buffy, and you didn't dream it.&#148;
Willow said smiling at her newly declared love. &#147;But you need to be under the covers
and I want to get out of these clothes can you hold on a few minutes longer?&#148; She
asked.</p>

<p>Buffy's eye's sparkled like a child's causing Willow to start
giggling with joy. All the tears were forgotten as she slipped out from under her lover
and got out of the bed. She hurriedly pulled off her dress and slippers then clad only in
her underwear she carefully got back into bed pulling the exhausted Slayer back into her
arms.</p>

<p>The two young lovers faced each other and waves of complete
love mixed with absolute devotion swept over them. Willow gently tilted Buffy's chin up
and their lips met for the first time as lovers.</p>

<p>Willow heard Buffy's soft moan as their lips brushed lightly
at first then slowly deepened becoming hungrier, more passionate until they were forced to
separate so they could breath.</p>

<p>&#147;Wow&#148; Buffy gasped breathlessly &#147;that
was...&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;intense.&#148; Willow said finishing the
sentence&nbsp;&#147;Exactly.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy snuggled closer to Willow burying her face in Willow's
neck.</p>

<p>&#147;I do love you Wills.&#148; Buffy sighed as Willow
hugged her tighter to her.</p>

<p>&#147;I know Buffy&#148; Willow whispered, &#147;I love you
too. Sleep. You need your rest.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Promise you&#146;ll be here when I wakeup.&#148; Buffy
mumbled as she fell asleep</p>

<p>&#147;Always, I'll be here always!&#148; Willow whispered.
&#147;We'll be together always.&#148;</p>

<p>Then when she was sure Buffy had drifted off she added, just
to appease the fates. &#147;As long as we live.&#148;</p>

<p>Then she followed her lover into repose and the universe
shifted back to its proper place as another prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Brigit and Morrigan came into the room later that night and
stood watching the two much younger women sleeping peacefully, their limbs tangled around
each other. Brigit smiled and nodded as she could feel the health and vitality returning
to the Slayer.</p>

<p>Willow whimpered in her sleep and Brigit used her hand to
sooth the girl's furrowed brow.</p>

<p>&#147;Their minds have touched.&#148; Morrigan whispered,
&#147;She is seeing the cost of slaying, the killing for the first time.&#148; She paused
for a moment, &#147;Perhaps we should have warned her.&#148;</p>

<p>Brigit nodded knowing she was right.</p>

<p>&#147;To what purpose?&#148; Brigit said a tear fell as she
recalled her own first experience with her beloved. &#147;There is no way possible way to
adequately prepare anyone for that kind of pain.&#148; Her gaze moved once again to the
two in the bed then back to her companion.</p>

<p>Brigit looked at her lover and sighed, &quot;besides we both
know it's not the killing she's crying over-it's the ones she couldn't save.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Remember when we were that young and love was
new?&#148; Brigit sighed wistfully, she took the other woman in her arms.</p>

<p>&#147;Every precious second.&#148; Morrigan moaned as she
leaned over and nipped at her beloved's neck. The two lovers left the room so they
wouldn't disturb the sleeping young ones.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Later that night Buffy was awakened by the sound of someone
weeping and knew almost instantly that it was Willow. Getting up she wrapped herself in a
blanket and went in search of her best friend and new lover.</p>

<p>She found her sitting in a window seat hugging her knees to
her chest tears flowing down her cheeks as she wept and by the looks of her bloodshot
green eyes she'd been here for quite a while. Buffy crawled into the window seat behind
her soul mate and carefully wrapped her arms and legs around Willow enfolding her in the
blanket.</p>

<p>&#147;What's the matter Wills?&#148; Buffy asked wanting to
help her overcome whatever was bothering her. &#147;I'm feelin' better now. Come on tell
your Buffy all about it, you know I love you.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I-I know.&#148; Willow sobbed softly unable to stop
crying as if her soul was injured. &#147;Something happened I saw...Oh Buffy I never knew,
how do you stand it? How do you do it?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;How I do what Wills?&#148; Buffy whispered softly
&#147;Please tell me.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I-I don't know how, I didn't mean to, but some
how.&#148; Willow was so sad and confused she didn't know how to start. &#147;I-I
t-touched your mind and I s-saw.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Saw what baby?&#148; Buffy whispered in the girl's ear,
her hot breath sending chills down Willow's spine in spite of the overwhelming sadness she
felt. &quot;Tell me what's wrong what did you see?&quot;</p>

<p>&#147;I-I s-saw it all, everything you sacrificed, everything
you missed, all the guilt you feel when you fail; I saw the cost Buffy, I saw it
all.&#148; Willow whispered still weeping uncontrollably. &#147;I saw what it meant to be
a Slayer!&#148; The young girl finished collapsing back into Buffy's embrace.</p>

<p>Buffy stiffened a little as she enclosed the Witch in a tight
hug&#151;she had hoped no one would ever know what a high price she'd paid to follow her
destiny. &#147;You weren't supposed to know.&#148; Buffy whispered. &#147;No one was, not
even Giles.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh gods Buffy, how could you live alone with
that?&#148; Willow wept harder knowing her courage. &#147;I saw the scars &#145;your
destiny&#146; has placed on your soul! I never knew, oh God Buffy, I never knew, what all the death and destruction had stolen from you!&#148;
Buffy felt Willow pause, breathing deeply trying to get her sobbing under control-the
young Slayer was horrified that her soulmate had been subjected to all that pain-her pain.
Her Willow had too much to deal with by herself; she didn't need Buffy's baggage
overwhelming her.</p>

<p>&#147;I saw how badly it hurt when your first watcher died,
how your calling destroyed your whole life.&#148; Willow continued and Buffy knew all she
could do was hold the little hacker until she ran out of steam. &#147;I saw so much pain
and all because of this, this, &#145;destiny&#146; you're forced to follow!&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Shh, Willow, shh,&#148; The Slayer cooed to her love.
&#147;It's over I've accepted my calling.&#148; She suddenly had the urge to see her
lover's face so the Slayer picked the Witch up turning her to cradle her love in her arms.</p>

<p>&#147;I know, I saw the test and Giles' betrayal.&#148;
Willow said simply, calmer-only to break down again as she cried, &#147;I felt your pain,
your guilt, your heartbreak over Angel--Angelus-it wasn't your fault! You didn't know, how
could you know? You loved him, oh God, you loved him so much Buffy!&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy sat holding Willow close to her heart as this fresh
spasm of sobs wracked her small frame.</p>

<p>&#147;Please Willow, I'm sorry you saw it, I'm so
sorry....&#148; She said stoking her lover's hot tear streaked face.</p>

<p>&#147;And I felt it, I felt how you loved me and how much it
hurt to deny it.&#148; Willow picked up where she left off just a few moments ago. &#147;I
also know that it was me...I was the cause of a lot of that pain. Mooning over you, never
leaving you alone, constantly reminding you of how alone you truly were. I'm so sorry
Buffy I didn't know. I really didn't know what I was doing. I don't understand how you
could still want me after what I did to you.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Hush now! Wills it's okay,&#148; Buffy whispered.
&#147;Its over, it's all over, thanks to you.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy buried her face in the soft silkiness that was Willow's
hair. She inhaled deeply enjoying the subtle combination of oils, herbs, mixed with
Willow's own chemistry creating a scent that was pure sweet Willow; it was intoxicating.</p>

<p>&#147;That's all over now baby&#148; Buffy said softly into
Willow's hair, &#147;You didn't know anything and you never would have if I could have
stopped it. Remember all that happened over time, over years-not all at once like you
experienced it. It's a wonder you didn't run off into the night screaming. Lord knows I
wanted to often enough.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;But Buffy I saw more than you realize,&#148; Willow
whispered. She sat so long staring out the window that Buffy began to wonder if she had
gone to sleep. Buffy looked up into her lover's eyes-they were so dark they appeared
bruised. Then with what seemed like one last hiccuped sob Willow said softly, &#147;I saw
the things you blame yourself for that weren't your fault. I saw the reason you sometimes wake up screaming in the middle of the
night.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Really Wills, that's all over now.&#148; Buffy said as
she dropped her face back into Willow's hair to hide her own tears.&nbsp; But once there
she smelled Willow's scent again and a delicious feeling washed over her-she couldn't stop
herself from nuzzling and nipping at Willow's neck and ear lobe.</p>

<p>&#147;We've got each other now and no one can ever hurt us
like that again I promise. You are my other half you complete me. Surely with everything
else you saw and felt tonight you must have seen that, too?&#148; Buffy whispered,
&#147;If you hadn't been there, helping me, holding me when I needed you too, then there
would be no Slayer, I would have given up. But now, with you, I can be Buffy again.&#148; She sighed, still not used to
confessing her deepest held secrets, &#147;with you by me, as my love, I swear I think I
can face anything.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy didn't know where all that came from or how she knew a
lot of the stuff she just said but it was enough that she knew it and said it to Willow.</p>

<p>Willow could feel the truth of Buffy's words in her heart and
felt as if she'd known it all along.</p>

<p>All this time Buffy had been kissing licking and nibbling her
way down Willow's neck and shoulders and was starting back up again.</p>

<p>Surrendering to the feeling Willow moaned softly and leaned
back into Buffy.</p>

<p>They both settled into the serenity of their nearness and sat
there enjoying the shared warmth of their bodies under the blanket.</p>

<p>Willow lay back humming softly and they stayed there until
Buffy could tell by the rhythm of her breathing that Willow had finally fallen back to
sleep. She carefully untangled herself from around her love and gently picked her up,
amazed at how fast her Slayer strength was returning.</p>

<p>Willow moaned softly in her sleep and nuzzled Buffy's neck.
Buffy carried the sleeping girl back to their shared bed, gently laid her down on the soft
mattress and crawled carefully into bed with her.</p>

<p>She pulled the covers over them then gently took Willow's
sleeping body in her arms and drew the red head close to her, taking care not to wake her.</p>

<p>She lay there for a while watching Willow sleep carefully
cataloging her every move and sound until she too drifted off into a deep dreamless sleep.
For the first time since she'd become the Slayer there were no murderous nightmares.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>They woke late the next morning. With Willow's help Buffy
found everything she needed and after they had both bathed they found new clothes laid out
for them.</p>

<p>Willow got another green dress of a fine hand woven cloth,
and this time trimmed in gold. For Buffy there was a leather tunic, soft leather pants,
and a pair of knee high boots, all black.</p>

<p>After dressing Willow led Buffy out into the garden anxious
to show her everything in the strange world they were visiting. Plus, Willow wanted to
make sure she thanked the Druids for saving her love's life. All Buffy remembered was
going to take a shower in the dorm and then waking up to Morrigan's unfocused face.</p>

<p>&#147;Wow, Wills this place is truly amazing&#148; Buffy said
awed by her surroundings</p>

<p>&#147;Wait till you see the fountain.&#148; Willow said
tugging at Buffy's sleeve like an anxious child.</p>

<p>&#147;Okay okay, Wills&#148; Buffy said smiling at her
friend's newfound exuberance, &#147;Don't blow a vein I'm coming.&#148; They came to the
fountain and found Brigit and Morrigan sitting at one of the tables.</p>

<p>&#147;Good morrow little ones.&#148; Brigit said smiling at
Willow's obvious joy, &#147;I see your beloved is well and recuperating.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow giggled like a shy child at Brigit's comment. Buffy
looked at the serenely beautiful blonde then to the wildly exotic red head then finally at
Willow.</p>

<p>&#147;Who&#146;re your friends Wills?&#148; Buffy asked
feeling a slight twinge of jealousy at their familiarity.</p>

<p>&#147;Buffy, this is Brigit.&#148; Willow said indicating the
regal looking blonde.</p>

<p>&#147;Pleased to meet you.&#148; Buffy said holding out her
hand, &#147;Wills tells me that I my life to you.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy gasped when Brigit took her hand. It was as if a
combination of high voltage electricity and the gentle warmth of spring spread through her
body from that hand.</p>

<p>&#147;No, not at all.&nbsp; I didn't save your life, your
beloved did. But, I am glad to see you are healing Elizabeth.&#148; Brigit said softly.</p>

<p>&#147;Ah&#133;yes...well I guess...ah&#148; Buffy began
awkwardly, overwhelmed by her contact with Brigit. &#147;Hey wait a minute. How did you
know about Elizabeth?&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy gave Willow a withering look, but Willow shrugged and
shook her head denying any involvement.</p>

<p>&#147;Do not blame Willow.&#148; Brigit said her soft voice
overcoming Buffy's anger. &#147;We know much about both of you Elizabeth or would you
prefer Chosen One or perhaps Slayer.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;How about just Buffy?&#148; she replied. &#147;Everyone
does.&#148;</p>

<p>The woman released her hand and the one with the wild red
hair and bright green eyes stepped up.</p>

<p>&#147;I am called Morrigan,&#148; she said in her normal
husky voice. &#147;You may remember me from last night. No? It does not matter.&#148;</p>

<p>She shook Buffy's hand vigorously. Buffy was impressed by the
strength of the woman's grip.</p>

<p>&#147;You say Buffy, then Buffy it shall be.&#148; Morrigan
continued. &#147;Leather suits you Slayer.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yeah&#133;ah&#133;thanks.&#148; Buffy said a little
stunned by the woman's presence, she was a force of nature.</p>

<p>It was like some deadly jungle predator suddenly stood up and
shook your hand.</p>

<p>&#147;Come, sit&#148; Brigit said. &#147;We have brought this
to share with you. There is fresh fruits, cheese, bread, fresh milk, and if you prefer,
meade of course.&#148;</p>

<p>The two girls sat down at the empty places at the table.</p>

<p>&#147;And for the Slayer, I have brought meat.&#148; Morrigan
announced and put a huge slab of venison on Buffy's plate.</p>

<p>Never having had venison and not wanting to be rude Buffy cut
off a small piece and gingerly put it in her mouth, it was marvelous, cooked just right.
It was marvelous! The meat was cooked just how she liked her meat and the spices made it a
truly wonderful.</p>

<p>&#147;This is great,&#148; Buffy said between bites as she
wolfed down every morsel that was put on her plate.</p>

<p>Finally, after two more helpings of meat, she was full. Buffy
stretched like a pampered cat. She already felt relaxed enough around these two women that
she leaned over and kissed Willow lightly and caressed her cheek.</p>

<p>Buffy rested her head on Willow's shoulder and half listened,
half dozed while Willow and Brigit talked about healing herbs and medicines.</p>

<p>After a while, when her love and their new friend started
talking about spells and all that Witchy stuff Willow loved so much Buffy became restless.
She sat up, kissed Willow's cheek and decided to look around. As she started for the trees
she felt a hand on her shoulder and turned to find</p>

<p>Morrigan standing quietly behind her.</p>

<p>&lt;Damn she's good!&gt; Buffy thought. &lt;I didn't even
know she was there. &gt;</p>

<p>&#147;I see you have tired of their talk of magiks and the
like.&#148; Morrigan said taking a loving glance at Brigit.</p>

<p>&#147;I guess so.&#148; Buffy shrugged &#147;The magic and
witchy stuff is Willow's thing. I'm more like action girl, you know fight now, magic
later.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;As it is with me.&#148; Morrigan said smiling at the
young Slayer, &#147;If you are up to it come with me. We too have things in common.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Go slowly with the girl, Morrigan.&#148; Brigit called
out as she saw the two of them leaving, &#147;She does not have your skills and she is
still not at full strength.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;As you wish.&#148; Morrigan answered and disappeared
with Buffy.</p>

<p>Brigit saw the worry in Willow's eyes as she watched the
other two leave. &#147;Worry not little one.&#148; Brigit reassured her, &#147;There is
much she can learn from my Morrigan, as there is much I can teach you.&#148;</p>

<p>For the next several days when they weren't together
exploring their newly formed relationship, Willow was with Brigit expanding her powers,
and Buffy was with Morrigan learning new fighting techniques.</p>

<p>&#147;I could stay here forever,&#148; Buffy sighed one night
as they lay in bed simply enjoying being together &#147;I feel better than I've felt since
becoming the Slayer.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I know what you mean.&#148; Willow said snuggling up
closer to her lover. &#147;Brigit is great I've never known anyone like her.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yeah, I feel the same way about Morrigan.&#148; Buffy
said thoughtfully. &#147;She's kinda hard to get to know at first but once you get past
that hardcore warrior stuff she's alright and she's the best sparing partner I've ever
had.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Watch it Slayer!&#148; Willow giggled and began poking
Buffy in the ribs, &#147;Only one soulmate to a customer.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh yeah,&#148; Buffy laughed and made a grab for her
teasing lover. &#147;You'd better watch yourself my little witch.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Or what?&#148; the redhead taunted.</p>

<p>The two wrestled playfully until Buffy pinned Willow to the
mattress, straddling her abdomen on her knees. She gazed into Willow's shining green eyes
nearly loosing herself in their depths.</p>

<p>&#147;Or this,&#148; Buffy said her voice thick with passion.</p>

<p>She lowered herself until her lips were on Willow's. Starting
with a soft brushing of their lips they were soon lost in a fierce all consuming kiss.
Mouths open tongues probing, their hands seemed to move of their own volition lightly
brushing searching for every sensitive area.</p>

<p>&#147;God I love you.&#148; Buffy moaned into Willow's mouth.</p>

<p>Willow could only moan, her body responding to Buffy's every
touch. Buffy slowly moved down Willow's trembling body leaving molten hot trails with her
tongue.&nbsp; It was as if their bodies melded together becoming one responding to the
call more primal than even Slaying, the need to love and be loved. Their entire beings
touched flesh to flesh, mind to mind, soul to soul.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>One morning when the four women were sitting by the fountain
having breakfast as was their habit, Lugh appeared from out of the trees.</p>

<p>&#147;You appear to have made a complete recovery,
Slayer&#148; he said smiling at her.</p>

<p>&#147;Yeah, I'm better than ever.&#148; Buffy answered
without thinking, she could feel the power the man exuded naturally &#147;Ah...you must be
Lugh? Wills told me about you. Glad to meet you.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy held out her hand to the man. He took her forearm and
held it, greeting her in the manner accorded to Celtic warriors. Morrigan had explained it
to her and the respect it conveyed to those it was given. It was an honor to be greeted by
this man in that manner and to Buffy's embarrassment she blushed with pleasure. By the end
of the greeting her body was nearly vibrating from the power came from Lugh.</p>

<p>&#147;I am glad you have recovered so well.&#148; Lugh said
as he released her arm, then became serious. &#147;I am sorry to say that your visit here
is very nearly at an end.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Is there something wrong?&#148; Willow asked fearing
the answer.</p>

<p>&#147;No child, nothing like that,&#148; he reassured her,
&#147;but as it is with all things the time has come to return you to your own destiny.
The powers are aligned so that you will be returned within two days of your leaving. To
keep you here any longer would interfere with the natural balance, and that we have all
sworn not to do.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy looked at each other each seeing the sadness
and determination in the other's eyes. Neither wanted to ever leave the peace of this
place or the two women they had both grown so fond of, but they had also learned to accept
the responsibilities of their combined destinies and to honor their new friends by doing
their best to preserve the natural balance.</p>

<p>&#147;When do we leave?&#148; Willow asked grimly. &#147;Is
there time to get ready?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Before sunrise.&#148; Lugh told her, his sorrow clear
in his deep voice. &#147;Your presence here will sorely missed. It has affected even those
you never met.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;We'd really like to stay, but Brigit and Morrigan have
explained why we can't.&#148; Buffy said feeling the sting of the tears welling up in her
eyes &#147;Destiny sucks!&#148;</p>

<p>Willow silently nodded her head in agreement unable to speak.</p>

<p>&#147;Well said Slayer&#148; Morrigan said for herself and
Brigit, proud of the young woman she had grown to like and respect.</p>

<p>&#147;I will leave you now so that you may prepare for your
return.&#148; Lugh said. He turned and disappeared back into the trees.</p>

<p>The four women watched him leave then turned back to the
table, none of them were hungry anymore.</p>

<p>They tried to follow their usual routine, but they were just
going through the motions and by sunset they had exhausted their supply of small talk.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the two pairs of lovers stood arm in
arm facing each other in awkward silence each one hoping one of the others would speak.</p>



<p>Finally the stalemate was broken when Morrigan pulled away
from Brigit and went to face Buffy. She put her hands on the younger woman's shoulders and
looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#147;Good hunting Slayer.&#148; Morrigan's normally clear
husky voice sounded strained. &#147;Listen to your soul mate, she sees things in a way you
can not.&#148; She handed Buffy a package. &#147;Open it when you are at your
destination.&#148; Morrigan said, &#147;It is something to aid you in seeking your
destiny.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;T-thanks&#148; Buffy said fighting her tears,
&#147;I-I'll m-miss you.&#148; Unable to control herself any longer and not wanting to
embarrass her friend, Buffy turned and ran into her room.</p>

<p>&#147;I&#133;ah...I&#148; Morrigan stumbled her throat tight
with unaccustomed emotion, &#147;We will miss you both.&#148;</p>

<p>She spun and stalked into the trees her shoulders hunched and
her hands clinched in tight fists at her sides. Brigit and Willow shared a tearful hug
then Brigit pulled out a small package from the pouch on her belt.</p>

<p>&#147;As Morrigan said, open this when you reach
the&nbsp;other side of the veil.&#148; she said softly, &#147;I will miss you little one,
you have made my days brighter.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;There's no way we can ever thank you for all you've
done for us.&#148; Willow told her sadly, then looked over to where Morrigan had
disappeared into the trees. &#147;Will she be alright?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Worry not for her little one. She is just unaccustomed
to expressing emotion to any one but me.&#148; Brigit said with a sad smile as she gazed
lovingly after her wild lover. &#147;It is a hard life for them little one. We are easy
for others to know and like, they are relaxed around us, but our others are too
intimidating for others to be comfortable with. It is not their fault it is the nature of
their calling. The life path they travel is dangerous and lonely, all they have is us.
Care for her well little one. In many ways her life is harder then even Morrigan's.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I will I swear it.&#148; Willow said touched again by
the woman&#146;s compassion</p>

<p>She turned and followed Buffy into the room leaving Brigit to
seek out her lover, she knew how badly Morrigan would need her tonight.</p>

<p>Willow entered their room and looked for Buffy, she
found her standing by the window seat staring out at the trees tears flowing from her
eyes, but not making a sound, Willow stepped up behind her best friend and lover, leaned
against her back and wrapped her arms around Buffy's waist.</p>

<p>&#147;I don't want to go back there.&#148; Buffy sobbed
quietly as she leaned back into her red-haired pillar of strength. &#147;They like us
here, they understand us here, it's not like back home. We don't have anyone there. Back
there they treat us like freaks and outcasts. Oh Wills, I'm so confused. I know about the
Slayer thing and about saving the world and all the destiny stuff, but why us. Even the
ones that know don't really care about us. We are the only ones that care about us.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Not so,&#148; Willow whispered her hot breath caressing
Buffy's ear. &#147;There's your mom and Xander and Giles, don't forget Giles. He was so
worried when you got sick, I don't think he slept a wink and I know he didn't take a
shower.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy turned around in Willow's arms so that she was looking
into Willow's eyes. Buffy felt a tightness in her chest as he gazed into the dark green
eyes of her universe.</p>

<p>&lt;This is the only reason to save the world&gt; Buffy
thought, &lt;because she's in it. &gt; &#147;You know you've always been able to do
that.&#148; Buffy said kissing Willow's forehead.</p>

<p>&#147;What's that?&#148; Willow asked beginning to nuzzle
Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>&#147;You've always been able to make me laugh.&#148; Buffy
moaned as Willow closed her teeth lightly on her neck. No matter how depressed I am or how
bad the situation, my Wills knows just what to say.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;M-m-m we aim to please.&#148; Willow groaned pulling
back a little. &#147;Kiss me.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;See what I mean.&#148; Buffy said softly just before
their lips met.</p>

<p>It was much later that night before the two exhausted lovers
fell into bed and drifted off into a deep dreamless sleep.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>A gentle warm breeze caressed Willow's face and the rising
sun warmed her body. She slowly opened her eyes and tried to figure out where she
was.&nbsp; After a few moments disorientation she realized she was laying in the same
grassy clearing where Buffy had fought the vampires and nearly lost.</p>

<p>The same one where Lugh, Brigit, and Morrigan had come for
them.</p>

<p>&#147;Wow!&#148; Willow said out loud &#147;Did I dream all
that?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;If you did then we both had the same dream.&#148;
Buffy's voice answered her.</p>

<p>Willow sat up and looked around.</p>

<p>&#147;If it was a dream we're still having it.&#148; Buffy
continued, &quot;Geez Wills, you're drop dead gorgeous in that dress.&#148;</p>

<p>She looked at what she was wearing, it was the dark green
velvet dress Brigit had given her on their first day. Willow turned to say something to
Buffy but froze when she saw Buffy's outfit.</p>



<p>The Slayer was wearing the same black leather tunic, blue
dress and boots that Morrigan was wearing the first time Willow had met her.</p>

<p>&#147;Your not so bad yourself my dear.&#148; Willow said
lecherously.</p>

<p>Willow's hand brushed up against something lying in the grass
next to her. Upon investigation she found a white ash staff like Lugh carried, complete
with runes and symbols but she could tell he'd made this one for her by the Willow Knot
woven in an intricate pattern around the head of the staff. Next to the staff was a large
thick obviously ancient book with a note sticking out of it. Willow pulled the note out
and read it.</p>

<p>&#145;This volume should be useful to you and your other,
along with the other things we have given you. I know that when the time comes their
meanings and uses will be made known to you.</p>

<p>Love and care for each other, maybe fate will allow our paths
to cross again in the future.&#146;</p>

<p>With affection</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brigit</p>

<p>Underneath the signature was a silver swan.</p>

<p>&#147;Wills look at this.&#148; Buffy exclaimed showing her
friend a neatly folded pair of soft black leather pants and a pair of long gleaming dirks
with beautifully decorated scabbards. She too had found a note, her's was much shorter and
in Morrigan's strong, bold hand.</p>

<p>'Slayer,</p>

<p>Good Hunting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morrigan</p>

<p>&#147;Even when we're not there looking out for us,&#148;
Buffy said a tear in her eye. &#147;Man I miss them already.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Me too&#148; Willow muttered her throat choked with
emotion knowing how difficult it must have been for Morrigan to express even that small
amount of feeling.</p>

<p>Then Buffy remembered the package she had been given. She
found it laying next to the other things. Buffy carefully unwrapped it, taking care not to
tear the paper. Inside was a beautifully carved and finished wooden dagger. Its handle was
covered with graceful swirling designs and ended with a jeweled pommel stone and hilt. The
three-edged blade tapered to a needle sharp point.</p>

<p>Willow opened her package and found two silver rings, each
set with a large emerald shaped like a heart.</p>

<p>&#147;My god, those are beautiful.&#148; Buffy exclaimed when
she saw the rings. &#147;I wonder why they gave those to us.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Don't know.&#148; Willow answered shrugging her
shoulders, &#147;but Brigit said it all has something to do with our destiny and when the
time was right we would know.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Well she hasn't been wrong so far.&#148; Buffy agreed.
&#147;Say I wonder how long we've been gone.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Don't know, but Lugh said two days&#148; Willow
answered. &#147;You think we'd better check in with somebody?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh geez, I forgot all about Giles.&#148; Buffy cried
out. &#147;We'd best get this stuff together and get our butts over to his place. He's
gonna have a stroke when he sees what we brought back.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Not to mention where we've been.&#148; Willow added.</p>

<p>&#147;I can't wait to see his face.&#148; Buffy chuckled and
gave Willow a quick kiss.</p>

<p>They bundled their gifts in their cloaks, then with Buffy
carrying that and Willow carrying her staff they headed off for the ex-watcher's home.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Giles was beside himself with worry. This was the second day
since Buffy and Willow had disappeared and still no one had heard or seen any sign of
them.</p>

<p>He clearly remembered that reassuring voice in his head but
for the life of him he could not figure out why he had trusted that voice.</p>

<p>In an effort to redeem himself, Giles had sent Xander out to
see what he could find around campus, knowing the other kids would talk to him easier than
the would Giles. Giles was in the basement armory when he heard someone come in upstairs.
Thinking it might be Xander back with some news he stopped what he was doing and hurried
up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#147;Really Xander,&#148; Giles began as he entered the
living room, &#147;if your going to be this long you should call....&#148; Giles froze in
his tracks, his mouth hanging wide open, standing in his living room were the objects of
all his concern and worry.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow were standing there smiling at him.</p>

<p>&#147;Buffy, Willow you're here, Where have you?...how did
you&#133;?!&#148; Giles stammered in surprise and confusion not to mention relief and joy.
&#147;Are you alright?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I'm fine Giles.&#148; Buffy reassured him, &#147;As for
the rest well it'll have to wait. We just walked all the way over here and we're tired and
thirsty.&#148;</p>

<p>The two girls flopped down on the couch next to each other.</p>

<p>&#147;Ah..well..yes I just..&#148; Giles began then stopped
himself took a deep breath and forcibly regained his normal calm composure. &#147;Alright
then, you two get comfortable and I will get us some refreshments.&#148;</p>

<p>His voice may have been calm but his face clearly showed his
anxious confusion. He went into the kitchen and began making tea using the time to get
himself completely under control. He was pouring the tea and composing his thoughts so
that he could properly debrief the girls when his train of thought was interrupted by the
front door slamming open then shut.</p>

<p>&#147;Hey G-man,&#148; came a call from the entry way,
&#147;No word yet. You got anything to eat I'm starved....HEY!, Buffster, Will where the
hell have you been?&#148;</p>

<p>Xander ran over then dove over the couch and landed across
the two girls' laps. He looked up at them and gave them a wide grin. &#147;Good to see
ya,&#148; he announced. &#147;Whas-up?&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow looked at the boy in their lap and then at
each other, speechless, overwhelmed by his exuberance.</p>

<p>Xander got up and looked hard at his two best friends looking
them over carefully. &#147;Wow where'd ya get the outfits, is Renaissance Fair back in
town.&#148; His close friendship with them gave him rights no one else had. Before they
could answer he stopped and looked first into Buffy's eyes then into Willow's.</p>

<p>&#147;Alright it's about time,&#148; he nearly cheered.</p>

<p>&#147;What is about time?&#148; Giles asked coming out of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>He looked over at the three young people, Xander was grinning
like a lottery winner, and both girls were smiling shyly and blushing.</p>

<p>&#147;Buffster got lucky.&#148; Xander laughed and grabbed
the two girls up into a bear hug.</p>

<p>&#147;Ugh....Xander please, I can't breathe!&#148; Willow
protested.</p>

<p>&#147;Turn down the cheer boy.&#148; Buffy said trying to
sound tough and failing miserably.</p>

<p>&quot;Really Xander.&quot; Giles said setting down the tray
of drinks, &quot;Put them down right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Xander released them and the girls sat back down on he couch.</p>

<p>&#147;Much as I hate to admit it, I agree with Xander&#148;
Giles said, once Xander sat down. &#147;Where have you two been?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;That's kind of a long story.&#148; Buffy began taking
Willow's hand. &#147;Wills is gonna have to start it, cause the last thing I remember is
