<p>Willow sat staring out the window at the huge black raven perched in the big
old oak tree behind their townhouse.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Yes, she said yes! &lt;&gt; Willow remembered the look on Buffy's face as her
love and soulmate had joyfully agreed to the Joining Ceremony.  If Willow
lived to be a hundred she would always remember the joy etched on her
Slayer's face.</p>

<p>She marveled at how much a simple three-letter word could affect her life.
Just one syllable and her entire life up to now had been validated.  The
raven stared Willow in the eye and nodded in agreement, then flew off as if
on important business.</p>

<p>Willow stood and did a happy little jig around the empty room.  It was
strange how that simple little word wiped away all the heartache and pain of
the past few years.</p>

<p>She stopped her little dance to better remember the moment again: the way
Buffy had slid off her chair and onto her knees so she was face to face with
Willow. The tears of joy streaking down the blonde's face as she repeated
yes over and over again punctuating each word with a kiss.</p>

<p>Willow had no idea how long they'd remained on the floor of the private
dining room in each other's arms as Buffy's playful kisses changed in
nature.  As relief, joy, and comfort were replaced by the craving to become
one with each other.</p>

<p>In fact she didn't remember leaving the restaurant at all.  She knew Mr.
Lipase had found them cuddled together and had called them a cab.  But,
after that it was a blur until they finally reached their bed.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't help the smug smile as she thought of Buffy's first
release-the blonde was always so careful never to lose control for fear that
she would hurt her lover-that first time: she'd lost control.  The young
Witch thought of how wild and free the slayer looked as the climax claimed
her-though, Willow thought blushing, her own release was just as intense.</p>

<p>After that initial wild time they had settled down and made an almost
lethargic kind of love.  The kind that only two lovers with the promise of
tomorrow could make-a slow burn that afterwards left them both peacefully
asleep.</p>

<p>No, Willow couldn't remember much of the night-but what did that matter?</p>

<p> &lt;&gt;Buffy said YES! &lt;&gt;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>In a drab, unimpressive little office deep in the bowels of the Vatican
library a very agitated Priest was frantically punching keys on the computer
facing him.</p>

<p>He was trying to call up the files he'd been in charge of for over five
years.</p>

<p>Panic gripped him when every code he put in failed to produce the
information he requested. The strong grip of fear continued to squeeze him
in a tighter and tighter hold, because he was the one who had claimed that
all the old fragile records needed to be scanned into computer files for
their safety.</p>

<p>He had graduated from MIT with honors after answering God's calling at just
twelve years old, taking his vows at 15; the church had sponsored his
education. The Vatican needed a computer expert and he was it.  Years of
rising in status only as successive computer advancements had increased his
value to the church, struggling to learn the complex politics that governed
life in the Vatican, and now his career was over.</p>

<p>As a last resort he put in his private code that gave him &#34;backdoor&#34; access
to the library's main frame but even accessing the hard drive failed to
produce results.</p>

<p>He just sat in his chair staring at a picture of an intricate Celtic knot
with two interlocking rings superimposed on his computer screen.</p>

<p>The Black Files were missing, no, not missing: gone.  The only copies known
to exist in the world!  The original files were destroyed during the process
of scanning them and because of their content there were just two
computer-generated copies made. One was placed in the mainframe and one on
tape backup-the back-up copy had triggered the virus, which wiped everything
out. Under other circumstances he would have loved to meet the hacker that
had thought up the program and compare notes.  Even in his panicked state of
mind he had to admire the skill and cunning of the faceless hacker.</p>

<p>Frustrated, he finally had to admit failure and shut down his computer
before the virus could damage things further.  It would be weeks before he
would be able to write a &#34;seek and destroy program&#34; to eliminate the virus.</p>

<p>He took an official memo pad out of his desk and wrote his first and
possibly his last note to the Arch-Bishop, &lt;&gt; I'll probably be exiled to
some small parish in the wilds of North Carolina, &lt;&gt; he thought.</p>

<p>It was short note but it carried far-reaching consequences, all it said was:</p>

<p>The Black Files are gone.
Q</p>

<p></p>

<p>With a resigned sigh, and wondering just how hot it got in the American
South, he put the memo into a plastic carrier and put that into the old
fashioned pneumatic tube that went directly to the Arch-Bishop's private
quarters.</p>

<p>&#34;This does not bode well.&#34; he muttered to himself and got up to go pack.</p>

<p>After he left, a tiny light, no bigger than a fly, detached from the wall
and slipped out door to take this news to his master.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>It was late on a moonless night when the private Lear jet landed at the
small airstrip deep inside an undeveloped country in a Central American rain
forest.</p>

<p>A black four-wheel drive vehicle, with dark tinted windows, met the heavily
cloaked passenger.  The cloaked passenger watched the dark countryside
seemingly lost in his own thoughts. The vehicle pulled up in front of
well-maintained but long forgotten stone mansion.</p>

<p>The dark stranger stepped out of the car and went quickly into the house
without waiting for an invitation. The human house servant didn't speak just
signaled that he follow him.</p>

<p>The servant led him too directly to the dimly lit study.</p>

<p>Sitting behind an expansive ironwood desk in a large leather chair was a
huge black skinned demon with glowing red eyes and sharp white teeth.</p>

<p>&#34;It has been a long time my brother,&#34; the demon said in a raspy nails on a
chalk board voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, fortunately. I was told you have a job for me?&#34; the dark figure
answered.  His voice deep and menacing clearly showing his impatience. &#34;I do
not have the time for polite amenities.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Remember your place, Count Kresis!&#34; The demon snapped. &#34;I come directly
from our master and as his messenger I have the power to have you
destroyed.&#34; The demon gloated.</p>

<p>The dark figure threw off his black leather duster revealing the tall dark
haired dark skinned man-like creature.  It was the first time in two days
that he dared remove his coat.</p>

<p>Count Kresis could have passed as human if not for his glowing red eyes,
razor sharp teeth with long needle like fangs, and long extra jointed
fingers that ended in talons.</p>

<p>&#34;Do not threaten me!&#34; he roared grabbing the edge of the desk his talons
sinking into the hardwood. &#34;I am still a Count of the first circle even if I
am exiled in this backward land.&#34;</p>

<p>The black skinned demon cringed back from the count's outburst fear clearly
written on his features. Seeing that he had gotten his point across Kresis
calmed himself.</p>

<p>&#34;Now what does our master wish me to do?&#34; he asked impatiently. &#34; Or more
importantly what's in it for me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The rewards will be quite substantial,&#34; the demon said relieved to be back
on familiar ground. &#34;That plus the master's support in the council on your
petition to return.&#34; He slid a document across the desk.</p>

<p>&#34;Impressive,&#34; Kresis quipped as he read the sheep skin scroll. &#34;Now, for all
this 'generosity' what is expected of me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The Slayer and the Sorceress have become aware of their special bond.&#34; The
demon said. &#34;If they complete the joining they will be able to close the
Hellmouth thus thwarting the master's plans to assimilate this world into
his Kingdom.  That  will also strand us all on this dreadful world.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Where are they?&#34; He asked, &#34;and what is required of me? Do I just kill
them?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, you must stop them before the Joining,&#34; the demon said.  Then with an
evil grin he added, &#34;they reside directly over the portal or what the
human's call the Hellmouth.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This is ridiculous you know I am not allowed enter the area of the
'Hellmouth.'&#34; The count protested, &#34;I'll have to use troops and without me
there in the battle with them it will be difficult.  At least give me some
of the Royal Guard!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, the Royal Guard is busy putting down the uprising on Tarsus.  You will
only have the regular troop.  I will not bother the Master again over this
matter.&#34; The demon answered, firmly and finally.</p>

<p>Resigned the count collapsed into an overstuffed easy chair, his heavily
muscled
Seven-foot frame sprawled out casually.</p>

<p>&#34;A troop of second rate demons and vampires against the Chosen One and her
Sorceress who also just happen to Sisters of the Soul.&#34; He sighed, &#34;I hope
our master realizes the impossible task he has set for me. I will do my best
but to be honest I can only work with what I'm given.&#34;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>He rose and put on his leather duster then bowed slightly to the demon
behind the desk.</p>

<p>&#34;I will strive to follow the commands of our master.&#34; Count Kresis said then
spun and stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; said a disembodied female voice from the shadows. &#34;Will
he succeed?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I truly do not know your grace,&#34; the demon said to the provocatively
dressed darkly beautiful female disengaging herself from the shadows. &#34;There
is much aligned against him, he was once considered the greatest general in
the Master's army.  But, without being able to directly lead his troop into
battle-well lets just say fortune favors the brave.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So, in other words he will mount a brilliant campaign and fail.&#34; She
laughed, &#34;I guess the only question is will he live? Oh, well, it won't take
much effort to open another portal and our dear count Kresis is expendable.
Come my pet I hear the inhabitants of this world are quite a delicacy, lets
try some.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;In a moment my dear.  What do you have going on in that pretty little head
of yours?&#34; The demon asked, smiling.</p>

<p>The beautiful demoness laughed again, &#34;oh, nothing really, except wouldn't
it just be delicious if the Slayer and her Witch were persuaded to see
things from our point of view?&#34;</p>

<p>The demon opened his mouth to speak, only nothing would come-the nerve of
her to think she could enslave the Chosen One and the Great Sorceress!</p>

<p>&#34;Darling, close your mouth.&#34; The demoness stated. &#34;They might be The Sisters
of the Soul, but they are still human-I have found that after a millennia of
living in this Hell that all humans have weaknesses.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So, ss-so, what do you plan, my darling?&#34;</p>

<p>The demoness walked over the desk and peered down, &#34;I don't know yet.  Rest
assured though, I will conquer their will and present them as a gift to our
Master.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;As you wish your grace,&#34; the demon said standing. Smiling wickedly knowing
he would be allowed to feed well tonight, and if his Mistress succeeded in
her plans she would take him back to the Master's court with her.</p>

<p>She stepped to his side and let her taloned finger traced the line of his
jaw over his dry scaly skin.</p>

<p>&#34;Lets go find a human female to play with,&#34; she purred and smiled revealing
two rows of razor sharp teeth and fangs, &#34;before we use her for a late
snack.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Gods I love my job!&#34; The demon sighed, his long forked tongue flicked out
then back.</p>

<p>She laughed maniacally in reply as she led the way out followed closely by
her pet.  She was pleased with her pet he had performed his part well,
Kresis hadn't suspected a thing,</p>

</table>

<p>Willow woke to the familiar darkness of their bedroom.  Being the slayer
meant that Buffy's eyesight was so sensitive to light that she liked to have
the room as dark as possible at night. Willow didn't mind the darkness if it
helped her slayer get a good night's rest.</p>

<p>The Witch wondered what had woken her up?  Was it a sound from outside the
window?  Or was it something else?  She tried to think but she was wrapped
around the warm body of her lover and Buffy's breathing began to lull her
back into sleep.</p>

<p>Willow had almost drifted off again when she felt the pace of her love's
breathing change-her Slayer's breath was beginning to come in gasps. Under
Willow's hand she felt Buffy's heart rate pick-up and she knew that the
blonde was in the grip of another nightmare.</p>

<p>The redhead knew better than to try and shake the slayer awake.  She instead
started to project soothing thoughts and emotions while slowly tracing small
circles where her hand lay on Buffy's stomach.</p>

<p>It had been nearly a month since Buffy's last nightmare-the longest the
slayer could remember going without having her sleep disturbed.  Ever since
becoming lovers, Willow had helped her soulmate through the terrors being a
slayer brought to her sleep.</p>

<p>Willow slipped easily into Buffy's sleeping mind to see what monsters were
haunting her tonight.  A tiny strand of seeking green light winding its way
from the young Witch into her love's heart.  If the room hadn't been so dark
the light would have been nearly invisible.</p>

<p>After that first night, when Willow saw all of Buffy's pain, and had been
driven to edge of insanity by it, she had put up shields.  Since then she
had never accidentally &#34;spied&#34; on her lover's dreams-instead opting for the
&#34;legal way&#34; by asking Buffy for her permission to view only her nightmares,
so she could help ease her slayer's internal demons.</p>

<p>Remembering that first night, Buffy had been resistant to the idea until
Willow quietly explained that having a slayer dreaming dark and violent
images next to a person wasn't particularly safe for that person.  And since
there was no way Willow was going to let Buffy sleep alone she really had no
choice in the matter-so her slayer gave her permission-and from then on
Buffy's nightmares had slowly gotten better.</p>

<p>The redhead watched as a familiar dreamscape unfolded before her.  It was
funny how she felt she was a spectator in the dream but not a part of it.
Buffy was fighting Angelus, again.  One part of Willow's mind detached and
she was thinking on two levels: the dream level-waiting for the fight to end
because dream or not she did not want to get between those two welding
swords. And on the level that she remembered the argument that Giles and
Buffy had that day about asking Angel to try and translate something from
the Book of Souls.</p>

<p>The dream fight was coming to an end but before Buffy could plunge the sword
through Angel, Willow stepped in front of him.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, you are having a nightmare.  Angel is safe in LA.&#34;  The dream slayer
at first looked confused, then hopeful, then the dreamscape dissolved and
Willow was physically pulled into a huge hug as Buffy woke.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The tiny light floated just outside of the Slayer and Witches' home unable
to enter.  The wards and protections surrounding the dwelling were too
strong and advanced for him to go through undetected.  He had been testing
for a weakness when the Witch woke and nearly caught him.  He fluttered
around outside the window; he could just see the Slayer and her mate through
a tiny crack in the drapes.</p>

<p>It was a really heart-warming scene how the Witch was holding her friend
while she sobbed.  Human's and their emotions-he would never be able to
understand them-emotion seemed like such a weakness to him.  Just as dawn
was breaking on the horizon the two girls finally settled back into sleep.</p>

<p>He knew he would just have to wait and watch for an opportunity to be
carried into the house through the protections.  He was a mundane creature,
with little or no magical qualities, so once inside he could go unnoticed.
No, he wasn't magical in and of himself, but small magic's could be
transmitted through him.  Thus, his people were the perfect spies for the
Master or in his case, his Countess.</p>

<p>He flew off in search of a place to watch the house from during the day.
The Oak Tree would have been the perfect place, with a view inside the main
rooms of both the Witches and the Watcher's houses-except for that stupid
Raven.  The dumb bird had taken up residence in the old oak and the little
entity had no delusions that it wouldn't think of him as lunch.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, well, the things I put up with for my Mistress.&#34; It sighed as it flew
away.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Kresis sat sprawled comfortably in the custom made seat of his private jet
as it flew steadily northward.</p>

<p>He was contemplating the latest twist in his ill-fated existence.</p>

<p>Somehow his name had been brought up to the Darklord and Master of his kind
and he did not know why. The only thing he was certain of was that somehow
Hela was behind it. She had once been his mate and had hated him ever since
the council had exiled him instead of having him destroyed.  He was a loose
end and she hated loose ends.</p>

<p>At one time she'd been his coconspirator in a bid for power but politics on
Tarsus were competitive and often deadly.  In the finest tradition of the
first circle Hela had betrayed him and turned him over to his rivals on the
council.</p>

<p>She had counted on them destroying him but instead they had exiled him to
this backward world.  He thought, darkly, that he would have preferred the
execution squad.</p>

<p>Now he was on his way back to a gods forsaken place he hadn't seen since his
first unpleasant day on this world.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I've come full circle, &lt;&gt; he thought, &lt;&gt;and still I'm not in control of my
own life. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>His plane streaked through the black velvet night sky carrying him to his
ultimate fate, he sat cursing his mortal enemy, Hela, and trying to figure
out where she fit in the Darklord's plans.</p>

<p>Kresis had sent one of the spies to gather first hand information on the
Witch and the Slayer but she had disappeared-no doubt Hela's work.  His
request for another one had gone unanswered.  He imagined the insurrection
on Tarsus must be worse than originally reported to the outlying worlds.</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the voice of his human pilot coming over
the intercom.</p>

<p>&#34;We are getting ready to land Lord Kresis,&#34; the voice said.  &#34;Are there any
further instructions?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Just land this blasted thing,&#34; Kresis said irritably. &#34;We should be
expected, those fools on the ground are to be ready.&#34;</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;These humans have no imagination, they're only good for servants or food,
&lt;&gt; he thought disgustedly. &lt;&gt;One way or another it ends here! &lt;&gt;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow was beside herself with frustration, her mother was slowly turning a
supposedly simple wedding into a major social event. Every time she turned
around her mother was there making changes of some kind or another to the
wedding or the reception afterwards.</p>

<p>Oh, and Buffy's mother was of little or no help when came to dealing with
&#34;Mom Rosenberg.&#34;  It was Giles' theory that both women were trying to make
up for whatever past mistakes they'd made by overcompensating with the
wedding arrangements.</p>

<p>One of their first major skirmishes had been over Willow and Buffy's choices
for their wedding party. Willow's mother had wanted them to have Willow's
cousins as bridesmaids.  But, on this one thing they able to stand firm
mostly because neither Willow nor Buffy knew the cousins all that well.
Willow was going to have Xander as her best man (or man of honor, or
whatever.) and Buffy was going to ask Cordelia to be her maid of honor.
Giles, of course, would give the 'bride' away.</p>

<p>They decided that since Willow had 'popped the question' Buffy was the one
to be given away.</p>

<p>Joyce had tried for several days to reach Buffy's father and when she
finally did reach him; he refused to even attend the ceremony.  As he put it
&#34;he didn't want to participate in another of his daughter's mistakes.&#34;</p>

<p>It tore her mother's heart out to tell her daughter, but Buffy had already
figured out what his reaction would be after the way he'd taken the news of
her 'coming out.' Giles had been more like a father to her over the years
since she'd moved to Sunnydale.  She felt it was about time that her mother
acknowledges the place Giles held in her life-he was her father in every
sense of the word-except for biology.  But, Willow knew that Joyce still
silently cursed her former husband for his insensitivity.</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy invited Xander and Cordelia over for dinner to ask them to
join the wedding party.</p>

<p>Xander had been easy; he just stared for a minute then sputtered out a &#34;yes
of course.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia's reaction had them puzzled however.</p>

<p>When Buffy asked her to be her maid of honor, Cordelia had burst into tears
and collapsed to the living room floor.</p>

<p>Willow sat down on the floor next to her while Buffy forcefully ushered a
confused Xander out of the front door.</p>

<p>&#34;What's wrong Cordy?&#34; Willow asked softly, putting her arm around the
weeping girl's shoulders. &#34;Was it something we did? Or Xander? What?&#34;</p>

<p>Cordy couldn't seem to stop crying but she held her hand up and shook her
head. Buffy returned carrying three glasses and two bottles of wine.</p>

<p>&#34;I gave Xander a tray full of cocktail wieners and a cold six pack and told
him to go bother Giles for a few hours.&#34; Buffy said as she sat down on the
other side of Cordelia &#34;I told him we had some girl type issues to work out,
he couldn't get out of here fast enough. Is it me or does Xander seem to be
getting smarter every day?&#34;</p>

<p>They all laughed and that seemed to calm Cordelia's tears for a moment.</p>

<p>&#34;Now,&#34; Buffy said, focusing her attention on the girl between them. &#34;What's
the matter with Queen C.?&#34;</p>

<p>With Buffy's question Cordelia burst out with a fresh bout of tears.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't know,&#34; Willow replied with a shrug. &#34;All she's done is cry.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy poured three glasses of red wine and handed Willow one holding the
other one until Cordy had calmed down again.</p>

<p>Cordelia took a sip and after a second began to explain her reaction</p>

<p>&#34;I-I'm s-sorry,&#34; she began. &#34;It's just...well...I know you guys didn't
really like me before, even when I was dating Xander in high school.&#34; She
paused to take another sip of wine.  Willow thought she could the Cordelia
mentally bracing herself.</p>

<p>&#34;I knew you only accepted me because of him. So when I left for LA with all
my big plans and then came back a failure I was sure you'd treat me like I
treated you.&#34;  Cordy looked out the French doors into the darkness beyond.
&#34;I knew I deserved it, especially from you, Willow.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia stood up and walked over the doors hugging herself tightly.  The
young Witch thought she looked exactly like Buffy did when she facing down
her own demons.</p>

<p>&#34;Then Xander took me back, and he never talks about LA or asks me what
happened.  He just sits there and listens when I need to talk and after he
just says he's glad I'm back and that he feels lucky I still wanted him.&#34;
She spoke still facing the doors or Willow thought the night beyond the
doors.  Angel would never tell them why Cordy quit and moved back to
Sunnydale-only that she would need to have friends-friends she could count
on.</p>

<p>&#34;Then you guys have been so nice,&#34; Cordelia continued turning and looking
Willow in the eyes for the first time since she broke down.  &#34;You've been so
nice about everything; even when I run my stupid mouth without thinking....&#34;
Another pause and far off look, &#34;now you want me to be a part of the most
important day of your lives and I'm just so overwhelmed!&#34;</p>

<p>She walked back over to the two girls on the floor and pulled them up into a
hug.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know how to thank you.&#34;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The three girls stayed in each other's arms for a long time as Cordy
overcame what ever was haunting her.  When she started to pull away Buffy
felt it was time to offer more wine to break some of the tension.  She was
slightly uncomfortable at the turn the night's events had taken--she had
never known the depths of emotions the former beauty queen was feeling.</p>

<p>As Willow led Cordy over the couch Buffy picked up the wine and poured them
another glass, then after handing Cordy hers and placing Willow's on the
coffee table she sat down in the over stuffed chair.</p>

<p>&#34;If you want to thank me, okay.  But first hear what we want you to do.&#34;
Buffy told Cordy with a small smile.</p>

<p>Cordelia finished off the glass of wine in one gulp and looked up at Buffy
with the beginnings of that old Cordelia spark that had been missing for the
past few months.</p>

<p>&#34;No, let me guess?&#34; Cordy smiled back at Buffy.  &#34;You want me to step in and
do my famous Cordy party planner--maid of honor from hell thing.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nearly choked on the wine she was sipping and Willow laughed at
Cordy's bluntness.  As the slayer refilled Cordy's and her glass for the
fourth time she tried to explain her what was happening.</p>

<p>&#34;We love our mothers but they are driving us nuts! So, yes, we need you to
get between us and our moms.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Look Cordy,&#34; Willow picked up where Buffy left off. &#34;I want you to
understand, we love you and we know how hard you've worked to create the new
user friendly Cordelia.&#34; She smiled at Cordy to reassure her.  &#34;And we
really don't want you to change if you don't want to....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But what you guys need right now is the good old take charge Queen C. like
in high school.&#34;  The Slayer noticed that very familiar glint return to
Cordelia's eyes in full force.</p>

<p>&#34;To be 'The Bitch.'&#34; Cordelia finished sitting up straighter on the couch
and smiling her beauty Queen smile.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other and then drained their glasses each
hoping they weren't recreating the monster.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah Cordy, you know,&#34; Buffy took over again. &#34;We want you to use your
powers for good and not for evil.&#34;</p>

<p>They spent the rest evening finishing off the wine, or at least Buffy and
Cordy finished off the wine and making plans not only for the wedding but
for the future as well. By the time Giles had had enough of Xander and sent
him back to Willow and Buffy's, the slayer and &#34;Queen C&#34; were more than a
little tipsy.</p>

<p>Cordelia and Xander ended up spending the night in the girl's spare bedroom
and in the morning the dreaded and widely feared Queen C. appeared and took
over control of the wedding plans.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The black skinned demon entered his mistress' private quarters and found her
still sleeping. Next to her on the bed was the nude form of what was once
very pretty young girl. The girl's flawless skin was now covered with cuts
and bite marks.  Her eyes were open and starring blankly at the ceiling, as
line of drool seeped from the corner of her swollen battered and bleeding
lips.</p>

<p>The demon tore his eyes away from his Mistress' victim and watched the scene
that the spy was showing.  It was a small magic for the spy to project what
it was viewing to the Mistress.  But, he wondered what his owner found so
interesting about a pair of non-descript apartment buildings.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt; It is not my place to think, &lt;&gt; the demon reminded himself.  He reached
down to stroke the Countesses face to wake her.</p>

<p>&#34;It is time to leave your grace,&#34; the demon whispered. &#34;The vehicle is here
to take us to the plane.&#34;</p>

<p>He watched as her beautiful eyes opened and she stretched in a cat like
fashion.  His beautiful master smiled at him and he was so happy he thought
he would die.</p>

<p>He helped her sit-up-she was always tired after playing as hard as she did
last night.  He couldn't help the hunger that shown in his face as he
followed her gaze down to the catatonic girl next to her. The Countess had
let him watch most of the events, and at one point, let him briefly join the
fun.</p>

<p>He licked his lips as she ran her fingers down the girl's abused and
tortured body her razor sharp talons leaving thin trails of blood to mark
their passage.</p>

<p>&#34;So, so, pretty, but oh, so fragile.&#34; She mused wishfully.  &#34;I wonder if the
Slayer will have more stamina?&#34;</p>

<p>She then looked up to make sure she had her audience and plunged her hand
into the girl's chest pulling out holding her still beating heart.</p>

<p>The demon didn't stop the drool that leaked out of his mouth as his Goddess
took a large bite of the warm quivering organ.</p>

<p>&#34;This one was delicious though,&#34; she laughed as she chewed slowly as if
relishing the flavor of the organ. She pointed to the body with her free
hand; &#34;the rest is yours.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You are too kind your grace,&#34; he proclaimed bowing and then pulling the
rapidly cooling corpse from the bed.  He knelt and began tearing the flesh
from the girl's body, and loudly enjoying his feast as only his kind could.
All the while staying aware of what was happening in the room around.</p>

<p>Being one of the slaves to Countess Hela of the Inner Circle meant being
alert at all times.  He watched his Master as she slowly walked over to view
what the spy was projecting.  It reminded him of one of this world's
televisions sets, except for it floated in mid-air and was bordered by the
red tinge of magic.</p>

<p>&#34;So, he still hasn't been able to gain entrance into the they're home.&#34; The
Countess stated and then at the wave of her bloody hand the view dissolved.</p>

<p>She pulled a bell cord and licked the blood from her fingers while she
waited for one of the human servants.</p>

<p>A huge muscular Latino man, who the Black demon hated, entered the room. And
he was pleased to see the human pale visibly at the sight of him tearing and
consuming what was left of the girl.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes Countess Hela,&#34; the man asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;We are leaving, Max,&#34; she answered. &#34;Close the house and join us in
Sunnydale.&#34;</p>

<p>She reached out and ran a bloody talon down his cheek looking deep into his
big brown eyes with her glowing red ones, causing him to shiver in terror.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't take so long that I have to come back here and fetch you, I promise
that wouldn't be pleasant.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;As you wish Countess.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hurry up pet,&#34; she called over her shoulder after the human left. &#34;I'm sure
none of us will go hungry in Sunnydale.&#34;</p>

<p>The sickening sounds of the demon feasting served as a counter balance to
the Countess Hela's shrill maniacal laughter.</p>

<p>It was a cold damp night, with a light mist falling as the two girls made
thier way out of Restfield Cemetery.</p>

<p>&#34;And next week after Spike's and my love baby....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What!&#34; The Witch demanded as the unusual conversation finally registered in
her preoccupied mind.  And Willow was lost when she looked into her lover's
laughing face.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you've hardly said two words to me all patrol,&#34; Buffy explained with
a mischievous smile forming.  &#34;So I thought you needed a little teasing.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow blushed; Buffy was right, she was so caught up in what Angel had said
about the Book of Souls she couldn't think about anything else.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sorry, it's just that....&#34; Willow started.</p>

<p>&#34;That Angel came up with something concerning the Book?&#34; Buffy finished her
smile disappearing. All the earlier amusement gone from her face as the calm
mask she wore when trying to hide her pain slammed down across her
expressive features.</p>

<p>Willow could feel the slayer pulling into herself-&#34;Stop that Buffy, right
now!&#34; The witch told her.  &#34;Don't even try to hide what you are feeling to
me!&#34;</p>

<p>The slayer blinked.</p>

<p>&#34;You know I can feel you when we're this close, so don't pull that 'I'm so
tough nothing bothers me' routine.&#34; Willow answered the Slayer's unspoken
question.</p>

<p>Buffy touched and then took Willow's hand stopping and turning to face the
young witch.</p>

<p>Willow plowed on, &#34;you know, Buffy, sometimes talking things out helps put
them into the proper perspective.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's not that Will, &#34; she started. &#34;It's just my feelings are still so
jumbled over the argument I had with Angel, and now's not the time or place
to sort them out.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow had to admit that Buffy was right, but not to be defeated so easily
she bargained:  &#34;Okay, I see your point, standing in the middle of the
street, at night during patrol is not the place for a heart to heart.&#34;  The
red head smiled, &#34;how about we swing by the Bronze and then pack it in?&#34;</p>

<p>She knew she had won when Buffy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>They resumed walking towards the Bronze each seemingly lost in their own
thoughts.  After a few blocks of silence the slayer glanced at the red head
as if she wanted to ask something....</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow gently questioned.</p>

<p>Buffy looked down and then away.  &#34;Well, ah, was Angel any help?  I mean
with the Book?  I know you have been awfully involved with it.&#34;</p>

<p>The witch sighed, &#34;Yes and no.&#34; She was at a loss to explain why he was a
help and yet he wasn't.  Or even why she was so incredibly obsessed with one
indecipherable passage when there were so many parts she could translate.</p>

<p>&#34;Um, could you vague that up a little?&#34; Buffy's joked, breaking into
Willow's frustrated thoughts.  &#34;You know sometimes talking things out helps
put them into the proper perspective.&#34;  The slayer added with a tiny
chuckle.</p>

<p>The witch groaned.  &#34;Yes, and those wise words are very true.&#34;</p>

<p>They walked a few more steps as Willow formed the ideas into words-&#34;he was
able to confirm that the passage was written in ancient High Gaelic.&#34; She
paused, and realized that she had instinctively reached out for Buffy's
hand.  Pulling it up to kiss it, finding comfort in the blonde's touch.</p>

<p>She traced the delicate bones of Buffy's hand--marveling at the power that
lay dormant within.  Power that used and directed in one way could in less
than a moment crush bones and take lives. Yet, used in another way could
create unimaginable pleasure for the person the Slayer loved. Somehow, when
Willow discovered that small passage buried within the Book, she knew it
held the same power.</p>

<p>&#34;The power to create or destroy.&#34; Willow mumbled.</p>

<p>&#34;How so Wills?&#34; Buffy asked clearly confused by the witch's sudden
withdrawal.</p>

<p>&#34;He said that he thinks it is either from the same time period or might even
pre-date Arthur of Thirteen Battles.&#34;  Willow said shaking her head to clear
it.</p>

<p>She felt a slight tingle of confusion from her lover so she explained
further.  &#34;King Arthur, you know the knight's of the round table and all
that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, yeah, Camelot?&#34; The slayer questioned as they began to walk again.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, sort of, except most of the legend has gone pretty much
Hollywood....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No!&#34; The blonde sighed, dramatically.  &#34;You mean all those movies were
wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>The young red head couldn't stop the laugh that her lover's playful joking
invoked.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, yes, every one of those plays and movies were the Gods honest
truth-from Bernard Shaw to Excaliber--they were completely based on fact!&#34;
Willow said, trying to keep a serious face, pretending along with
Buffy-breaking the tension she felt building between them since the mention
of Angel.</p>

<p>They were quiet for another block or two; both lost again in they're own
thoughts, only this time they still held each other's hands maintaining
contact.</p>

<p>&#34;So, did he help?&#34; Buffy repeated her earlier question-no need to say who
'he&#34; was.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I think so.  'He' was able to at least spell the passage phonically.&#34;
Willow answered.  &#34;But, he had no clue what the words meant.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So it could have been King Arthur's grocery list for all we know?&#34;  Buffy
stated.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, no, it has power, Buffy, it....&#34; Suddenly the slayer stopped and
tensed.  Willow knew that something was had alerted the blonde to danger.</p>

<p>Willow released the slayer's hand and watched her do a slow pivot, her head
canting to one side as if listening for something that only she could hear.</p>

<p>After a second to get her bearings the blonde took off in the direction of
the Bronze expecting her lover to follow her-which Willow did as fast as she
could.</p>

<p>When they turned the corner into an alley near the Bronze they found a
vampire with his back turned to the street holding a young teenage girl.  He
appeared as if he was getting ready to sink his fangs into her neck.</p>

<p>&#34;Shouldn't snack this close to bed time?&#34; the slayer quipped, as she skidded
to a stop in the middle of the alley.  &#34;Didn't your sire teach you
anything?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow watched in horror as the vampire turned to face them-he didn't have
his &#34;game face&#34; on so that could only mean one thing....</p>

<p>&#34;My, my, Slayer,&#34; came a hissing demonic voice from behind them. &#34;I was
beginning to think that you and your little red headed bitch were going to
miss our little party.&#34;</p>

<p>It was a trap; Willow belatedly finished her thought.</p>

<p>The girls turned as one and found they were facing a group of six vampires
and three minor demons who were rapidly spreading out in a lose circle
around them.</p>

<p>Sensing a magical threat Willow faced the demon that was obviously the
leader of the merry band.  The Witch felt Buffy take up the position
directly behind her, placing them back to back.</p>

<p>&#34;Let her go,&#34; Buffy said twirling a stake in one hand and one of the dirks
in the other. &#34;It's us you want or don't you think you've brought enough
help.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm hurt Slayer,&#34; the demon hissed. &#34;Here our Lord went to such lengths to
provide you with the proper entertainment to make sure we kept your
interest, and you worry about the expendable extras.  Tsk, tsk.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;They always gotta talk,&#34; the slayer said and without warning threw her
stake in the heart of the closest vampire. As if that was the invisible
signal the battle was on-the demon in front of Willow attacking her
magically while the remaining vampires and demons attacked Buffy physically.</p>

<p>The red head knew that their position was not the best in the world.
Buffy's natural fighting style used her speed as a weapon-protecting
Willow's back meant that she had to stand and pound it out-rather than hit
and evade.  While the young Witch was holding her own against the lead
demon's magic, she couldn't break away from his attack to give the slayer
aid.  Plus, these minions from hell seemed to have some kind of
training-every time Buffy tried to maneuver them into a more defensible
position they were cut off.</p>

<p>Then all other thoughts flew from Willow's mind as some kind of strong dark
magic began reinforcing the lead demon's own magic taking nearly all her
strength to hold him back.</p>

<p>Finally, the lead demon made a mistake that gave Willow an opening-without
consciously thinking about it she threw a huge ball of explosive blue flame
that blew the lead demon back into the street.  She kept an eye on him
making sure he didn't get up as she turned around to help Buffy.</p>

<p>The slayer was winning but just barely: the air was filled with the dust of
destroyed vampires. One of the lessor demons tried to attack the witch and
she managed to completely expel it.</p>

<p>After that the two remaining vampires grabbed their leader and ran off.</p>

<p>Seeing the vampires flee Buffy collapsed to one knee and for the first time
since the battle began Willow was able to look at her lover and the sight
horrified her.  Her beloved had dual gashes down the entire length of her
forearm from the claws of the demon she'd killed and something had laid open
her cheek to the bone.</p>

<p>The blonde's blood was flowing from those and several smaller wounds soaking
her coat and dripping onto the wet pavement. By the way Buffy was panting
Willow could tell that the blonde was very nearly at the end of her
reserves.</p>

<p>The Witch had forgotten about the lone remaining vampire until he spoke.</p>

<p>&#34;A little something to help you remember me,&#34; he hissed angrily and sank his
fangs into the forgotten the girl's neck at the pulse point and began
feeding as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up with dazed and glassy eyes and saw what was happening. It
still took a few seconds for what the vampire was doing to register but when
it did she was a blur of action.</p>

<p>&#34;NO!&#34; she screamed and dove at the feeding beast ramming the stake through
it's heart, only before it burst into a cloud of dust it bit down hard on
the young's neck severing her jugular.</p>

<p>With all the speed given to her by her slayer genetics Buffy was able to
catch the girl's limp body before it hit the ground but she was too late.
The beautiful young girl's life pumped out of her body, as the slayer
helplessly watched her blood mixing with Buffy's as her life faded away.</p>

<p>The girl's last words were &#34;I didn't know.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow watched her lover hug the girl's limp body to her chest and began to
gently rock her with growing dread.</p>

<p>&#34;This is going to be bad,&#34; she mumbled to herself as she began setting up
wards and barriers to protect them from further attack.  Thanking the Gods
for the first time tonight for the light mist because it would help wash
away the smell of Buffy's blood.</p>

<p>She turned back to her lover to find the blonde holding and rocking the girl
moaning softly--tears flowing unchecked down her face.</p>

<p>Guilt was eating at Willow's resolve--because she too, had forgotten about
the girl during the heat of the fight-maybe she could have done something,
anything that could have saved her.  What good were all her powers if
through negligence she still let a life slip between her fingers?</p>

<p>Another soft moan pulled the red head's attention away from the dead girl
and to her lover.  She could tell that Buffy was fading fast and they needed
to get out of there and home as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>She knelt down by the slayer and gently stroked the side of her face that
wasn't cut.  The slayer's skin felt hot and dry to Willow, which meant that
she had a high fever.</p>

<p>&#34;Love, Buffy, honey, we have to leave, now.&#34; She said to the unresponsive
girl.  Buffy didn't seem to realize Willow was there, next to her, touching
her.</p>

<p>&#34;Please Buffy, we have to get home, please....&#34; Willow pleaded and at last
the slayer came back to herself.  She blinked, then quietly placed the girl
on the wet pavement.</p>

<p>The witch helped the blonde stand and supported her as they slowly made
their way home.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Once home, Willow helped her lover to their couch and put Buffy into a deep
healing sleep and then washed out the worst of her wounds.  But the blonde
had a raging fever-Willow thought from some kind of venom the demon used on
his claws.  When the witch used her 'sight' though, she saw that the
slayer's natural defenses were defeating the poison, it just meant she had
to wait before treating the gashes.</p>

<p>By that time the little witch was almost asleep on her feet and not wanting
to wake her lover, Willow laid down next to her on the couch.  As they slept
Willow's subconscious put up wards around them and reached out to her
soulmate's mind.  When Willow felt the new indelible darkness the night's
events had placed on Buffy's soul she began weeping in her sleep.  Somehow
knowing that her lover would go through the rest of her life carrying the
memory of the innocent girl's death and blaming herself for it.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The tiny entity watched the Slayer's friend get out of the car in front of
the Townhouse.  He had witnessed the bloody battle the night before and had
tried, unsuccessfully, to attach to some of the slayer's clothing.  Thinking
that since she was barely conscious she wouldn't notice him--but the
protections the Witch had placed around the pair, once again, kept him at a
distance.</p>

<p>The Raven was at its post in the oak tree so it would be tricky to get to
the friend before it saw him-though with the Mistress' growing impatience
death from the bird eating him would be a mercy-if he were to fail.</p>

<p>Luck was shining on him because just as the Raven's sweeping gaze turned
away from his hiding place--the tall brunette paused apparently seeing
something of interest on the sidewalk-it was his chance and he took it. He
landed on the hem of her dress and quickly crawled up under it out of sight.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Cordelia was walking up to the door of the townhouse shared by Buffy and
Willow, determined to get the two love birds out of the nest and downtown to
the seamstress.  The two had been too busy lately, saving the world or some
such trivia, to schedule their final fitting.  And unless they wanted to
attend their wedding naked this was going to be one of their last chances.</p>

<p>She'd finally won the battle with Giles and Xander and had gotten them to
the tailors for their tuxedo fittings yesterday.  Willow had gone into her
own funds and bought the two men their tuxes saying that it was only fair,
after all the brides maids always got their outfits paid for so why not the
guys?  Besides, she confided in Cordy, this way she knew Xander wouldn't
show up in some powder blue monstrosity.</p>

<p>Cordelia reached the door and paused before knocking--putting on her &#34;wrath
of Cordelia&#34; face so there would be no augments. After a few minutes with no
answer she tried again, after the third time Cordelia noticed a trail of
dried blood leading up the sidewalk to the door.</p>

<p>Worried about her friends she got out the keys they'd given her and let
herself in. She slowly opened the door calling out their names as she
entered the townhouse.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy...Willow?&#34; She called out. &#34;Is anybody home?  Come on guys it's me
Cordy.&#34;</p>

<p>She saw an eerie green glow emanating from the oversized couch.
Investigating-- Cordelia found them--lying on the couch Willow curled up
next to Buffy her head resting on lover's stomach.</p>

<p>Cordelia could see the source of the blood trail-Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Must've been a rough night of slaying.&#34; She mumbled quietly.</p>

<p>When she walked around to the front of the couch she noticed both girls were
crying in their sleep.</p>

<p>&#34;Must've been a really rough night,&#34; she amended.</p>

<p>She reached down to try and wake up Willow--but when her hand came in
contact with the green glow an electric like jolt ran up her arm forcing her
to step back.</p>

<p>Immediately the glow disappeared and Willows eyes flew open as she launched
herself off the couch.  The little red head landed in a defensive stance,
with a ball of intense blue flame forming in her hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Geese Willow!&#34; Cordelia shouted, taking another step back.  &#34;Paranoid
much?&#34; She asked throwing up her hands in a defense gesture.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah...Cordy?&#34;  Willow asked trying to blink her vision clear.  Then she
plopped down on the coffee table next to the couch.  Cordelia could see the
lines of exhaustion and worry plainly in her friend's face.  She watched as
Willow seemed shocked to find the flaming sphere still formed in her hand.</p>

<p>Saw her friend flush in embarrassment as she apologized, &#34;Sorry bout that.&#34;
And willed the flames to dissipate.</p>

<p>She followed Willow's gaze as the red head looked down at her still sleeping
lover and gently ran a finger over the partially healed wounds.</p>

<p>&#34;It's okay, Will.&#34;  Cordy hesitated just for a second and then placed a
comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Willow took a deep breath and slowly let it out never taking her eyes off of
her soulmate's tear streaked face.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, yes, it will be,&#34; the young witch said with her resolve face slipping
into place.  &#34;What time is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's around three,&#34; Cordelia answered.  &#34;It's okay Willow.&#34; Cordelia told
Willow for a second time patting her shoulder to reassure her that someone
else cared about them.</p>

<p>&#34;Tell you what, you go take a shower and I'll call and reschedule the
fittings then fix you guys some breakfast? How does that sound?&#34; She asked
as she walked over to Buffy, examining the long gashes on her arms.  &#34;Then
I'll help you take care of her.  From taking care of Angel all those times I
became pretty good with a needle and thread.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure Cordy,&#34; Willow agreed, still groggy and stunned by her friend's cool
efficiency and obvious concern.</p>

<p>&#34;What did you use to knock her out?&#34; Cordy asked, she needed to know how
much longer the slayer would be asleep.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, um...&#34; Willow stammered still not firing on all cylinders.  &#34;I used
magic-she should be out for a little while longer, why?&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia straightened and headed towards the kitchen hoping Mrs. Summers had
done some grocery shopping for those two.  Sometimes they were just so
helpless when it came to the every day things of life.</p>

<p>&#34;Because,&#34; the brunette started as she turned back to the confused Witch,
&#34;we can get some food in her, then get her clean and in bed before you zap
her again so we can stitch up those cuts.&#34;</p>

<p>If Cordelia hadn't been so busy the silent &#34;oh&#34; that formed on Willow's
mouth would have been comical.</p>

<p>&#34;Then, I'll...ah...go shower.&#34; And the Witch staggered up the stairs talking
quietly to herself, &#34;Boy when you put Cordy in charge she really takes
charge. Thank the goddess.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia couldn't help the smile as the last of her friend's words drifted
down to her.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The entity detached itself from the girl's skirt and flew over to the
nearest picture hanging on the wall.  It would be able to watch the entire
room from this spot and, at the same time, with just a few steps it could
hide behind it.</p>

<p>It was still shaking off the effects of the stupid girl touching the witch's
protections.  No wonder humans were doomed to become slaves-they needed
someone to take care of them all the time. They didn't have enough
intelligence to put in the head of a pin--when they did things like sneaking
up on powerful witches-they shouldn't expect to live.</p>

<p>He sat there watching with the smug knowledge that his Mistress was far
stronger than the little witch was-she would have fried the stupid
brunette-instead of taking orders from her.</p>

<p>Kresis sat on his high-backed makeshift throne; his leg casually draped over
the arm of the chair. He was trying to mask the seething frustration that
these...wanna warriors were invoking in him. A hundred vampires and demons
and not a one had the potential to even be an arms-bearer in the Royal
Guard. How in the five worlds of Taurus was he supposed eliminate the most
powerful slayer in the history of this world, not to mention her mate, the
Great sorceress with such as these?</p>

<p>Count Kresis couldn't stop the impatient tapping of his talons on the table
next to him, the only outward sign of his boiling emotions. He drank his
favorite thick red mixture of twenty-year-old single malt scotch and AB
negative.</p>

<p>As per the duties expect from one of his rank he was listening to the badly
wounded demon snivel about how the Slayer and Witch had defeated his
carefully planned ambush. He kept the fact that he expected his forces to
lose to himself.</p>

<p>Oh, he had done the best he could by his soldiers-as he did by all his
forces. But, his plan was to wear the Slayer and Witch down by getting them
to fight a series of ambushes on his terms. The General had watched the
training drills weeding out the slackers and identifying the ones who
exhibited the most talent. Then he had separated the strongest to give them
extra training-extra food-he treated them the best and encouraged teamwork.
They were the best of this ragged sorry group-they were his only real hope
of success.</p>

<p>Growing tired of the sycophant's simpering he rose from his throne and
slowly stepped down to stand next to the pathetic excuse for a commander.
He put a reassuring hand on the demon's shoulder; he wanted this to be swift
and painless for the fool.</p>

<p>He didn't like wasting a resource, but he had to somehow keep order within
his ranks. Kresis knew that as the body count rose, discipline would fail,
so he needed to maintain total control of what he laughing refereed to as
his troops.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't worry my friend, you will never again fail me.&#34; Kresis said
sarcastically and without warning he tore the demon's head off with a single
smooth motion. &#34;No one fails me twice.&#34;</p>

<p>He threw the head down next to its still quivering body and walked to the
door.</p>

<p>&#34;Clean that up!&#34; He ordered the surviving members of the dead demon's squad
as he walked out of the room. He was satisfied that within the hour all of
his commanders and their troops would know the price of failure and
discipline would never become a problem.</p>

<p>He cursed at the shortsighted idiots on the council. They had been so afraid
that he would return to wreak havoc on them they had laid this ludicrous
curse on him that kept him away from the Hellmouth.</p>

<p>He knew that if he could just get at those two bitches then one way or
another all this would be over. The Count wasn't a fool, he wasn't desperate
enough to attempt getting closer to the Hellmouth yet, but time was getting
short. If things didn't start to work out soon-then he might have no
alternative.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow came down the stairs after her shower surprisingly refreshed. It was
hard to imagine that less than twelve hours ago she had been taxed to her
magical limits. Under normal circumstances she should have been totally
wiped out for at least two or three days-not bursting with renewed energy as
she was now.</p>

<p>Something had been slowly changing inside her ever since her little jaunt to
Brigit's world. It almost as if they were becoming stronger in their
abilities. Buffy should not have able to stand there and just pound it out
with six vampires and two demons the way she had last night, or as Willow
corrected herself, this morning.</p>

<p>With the thought of Buffy came the memory of their abject failure with the
innocent girl, those bastards, had used as bait. The young witch felt
terrible about the girl-but it was Buffy who was suffering from the soul
poisoning guilt. For the second time in less than twelve hours Willow felt
impotent--what good was all this power she was developing if she couldn't
ease the other half of her soul's pain?</p>

<p>She found Buffy awake when she reached the bottom of the stairs. If awake
is what you would call it, she thought to herself. The young girl was
sitting on the couch staring down at the carpeting, her normally bright hair
nearly brown from the dried blood still matted in it. Willow tried hard not
to gasp as the slayer faced her with dead and defeated eyes. While the
physical damage to the blonde was impressive, it was the utter despair that
radiated from her lover in waves, which truly frightened Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, Buffy...&#34; The Witch whispered as she sat down on the couch next to her
soulmate. She reached out to take the slayer in her arms and then pulled
back because there was literally no safe place to touch her. Besides the
gashes on her arms the witch saw cuts and livid busies all over Buffy's
body, even through the ragged, bloodstained clothes she still wore.</p>

<p>&#34;I got her to drink some soup and a little bit of Gatorade.&#34; Cordelia said
quietly as she walked into the living area with a mug of soup for Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; Willow took the mug and began to sip the hot chicken broth. She
noticed as the slayer dropped her eyes back to the carpet.</p>

<p>&#34;You guys are in serious need of a grocery run.&#34; Cordy announced. &#34;I made a
list of the basics, if you could finish it with what you want I'll go, after
we take care of her.&#34; The brunette finished with a pointed look at
Buffy-Willow could tell that she was trying to provoke the slayer-Buffy
hated to be spoken of as if she wasn't present.'</p>

<p>But all her lover did was clutched her injured arm tighter against her chest
and sigh as the slow trickle of tears began again.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, honey, please let's talk about what happened.&#34; Willow begged her
soulmate.</p>

<p>The slayer didn't answer; she just shook her head emphatically, no.</p>

<p>The helplessness Willow felt was threatening to overwhelm her. She just
couldn't stand to sit by and watch the person she loved more than life
itself be in such pain. Yet, she just didn't know what she could do to ease
it.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay then,&#34; she said with a resigned sigh. &#34;Let's get you cleaned up and
into bed.&#34;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Hela, Countess of the first circle matriarch of the house of Red Swords of
Tarsus sat in her throne room smiling slightly. She was overjoyed as she
watched the couple in a glowing red sphere. Her devious and complicated plan
was coming together perfectly.</p>

<p>That idiot Kresis had been stupid enough to attack those two head on, once
again underestimating his opponents. The Slayer and her little Witch-Kit had
thrown everything right back at him weakening him even further.</p>

<p>Her own mystical attack will be more subtle.</p>

<p>If everything worked according to plan then, the slayer would be under her
control before the Witch knew anything was wrong.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, Max,&#34; the beautiful demon called to her human servant. &#34;You don't want
to miss this, I'm about to start the Slayer's training.&#34;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Weeping softly Buffy cradled the young girl's lifeless body. She looked down
at the innocent face as the dull death-clouded eyes turned toward her.</p>

<p>&#34;Why did you forget me? It was your fault, you let me die?&#34; The girl's
hollow voice echoed in her ears. &#34;Why? You could have stopped him?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I-I-I t-tried.&#34; Buffy stammered, stunned by the accusation. Some part of
the slayer's mind knew this was a dream, that it had already happened and
that there was nothing she could do to change it.</p>

<p>Even as she watched, a red glow covered the young victim's face and it
changed-to Willow's. Instead of cradling the teenage girl in her arms she
held the lifeless corpse of her lover. The witch's blood pumped out through
the wound in her neck spraying Buffy with crimson.</p>

<p>&#34;Will you forget me, too?&#34; The dead Willow asked spitting blood out of her
mouth with every word.</p>

<p>After a shocked instant the tiny slayer felt as if a pit had opened up under
her feet and she was falling. She tried to hide the truth of her failure in
denial, but the lifeless green eyes of her soulmate continued to accusingly
stare up at her.</p>

<p>The dream Buffy let out a horrific scream, dropping her soulmate's body and
curling on herself. She prayed for insanity to come and release her from
the agony of failing the one person she couldn't live without. She lost all
sense of her dream, of who she was, as a red haze filled her mind and she
knew that without Willow, there would be no escaping the pain this time.
She would be lost in this eternal hell of reliving her failures.</p>

<p>She felt the musical voice more then she heard it. It started as a soft
jingling on the very edge of her conscious awareness and grew as she tried
to focus on its beauty. Once she acknowledged it, that she could hear it,
it seemed to reach right into her and run through her nerves to her core.</p>

<p>Buffy found that if she concentrated--the notes almost became words-and the
words began to wash some of the emotional distress away. She forced herself
to uncurl and stand just so she could better hear the song.</p>

<p>As she stood, she understood the words for the first time and a peace
engulfed her.</p>

<p>&#34;Listen,&#34; they beckoned. &#34;Listen, little slayer, believe in me. Surrender to
me and you will never hurt again.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy didn't want to question the music; she was frightened it would leave
her, leave her utterly alone, still she was the slayer and she had to know.</p>

<p>&#34;How?&#34; She whispered.</p>

<p>Silence. The beautiful music stopped. Buffy was left straining to try and
hear it. But, all she could make out was her own harsh breathing-panic
seized her as the emotional agony threatened her sanity once again.</p>

<p>&#34;You need to be punished.&#34; A voice said softly behind her and the slayer
whirled dropping into a fighting crouch, only to find the dead teenager
looking at her calmly.</p>

<p>&#34;Once you accept your punishment, everything will be all right.... See?&#34; The
dead girl finished. She lifted her hand, placing it over Buffy's heart.</p>

<p>The slayer looked back up at the girl's face just as an intense wave of red
light crashed down the dead girl's arm and slammed into her chest. Wave
after wave of mind numbing pain tore through the slayer until it hit the
core of her being.</p>

<p>She knew she deserved the punishment and she accepted it for her failures.</p>

<p>&#34;That's right,&#34; the dead teen encouraged. &#34;Surrender to it and its
pleasure.&#34;</p>

<p>Then the nature of the pain changed and Buffy lost all control as the red
light centered in her sex....</p>

<p>And she woke.</p>

<p>And she was blinded by the bright morning sunlight pouring into through the
windows.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles, she's awake, again.&#34; Cordy's voice shouted.</p>

<p>&#34;Thank god, I was beginning to get very concerned.&#34; The ex-watcher said
entering the room.</p>

<p>The slayer tried to blink her vision clear but couldn't; all she could make
out were two big people-shaped blurs.</p>

<p>She was terribly confused by the sudden shift from her dream to being
awake....</p>

<p>&lt;&gt; Still, there was a dream, wasn't there? &lt;&gt; She thought to herself, as the
images faded.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy? How do you feel?&#34; Giles asked, tentatively sitting down on the bed
next to her.</p>

<p>She blinked again, trying to make him come into focus.</p>

<p>&#34;Damn, she must be still out of it.&#34; Cordy's voice stated when the slayer
didn't respond.</p>

<p>&#34;No, no, I'm fine.&#34; Buffy was able to force the words out. &lt;&gt; I'm sure I had
a dream. It was important. I needed to remember it. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, it's about time! &#34; Buffy looked at the blur that had to be the tall
brunette. &#34;Do you know how worried we've been?&#34; Despite the irritation in
Cordelia's voice Buffy could plainly hear the fear her friend felt for her.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh and poor Willow; she has been beside herself-she feels guilty for
leaving you to go to the magic shop so she could get some stinky herbs to do
a healing ritual-how was I to know you were going to spike a fever in the
twenty minutes she was gone. That was just so unthoughtful of you....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Cordelia would you please shut-up!&#34; Giles snapped at the babbling brunette.</p>

<p>At the mention of Willow's name Buffy got a flash of a memory-it was more
like a sense memory--that her lover was in extreme danger.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow, where is she? Is she okay?&#34; The slayer asked trying to sit up so
she could find her soulmate.</p>

<p>&#34;She's fine Buffy, she's sleeping in the guest room.&#34; Giles said. But, when
he touched her on her chest with the intention of making her lie back down
she got another flash of something or someone touching her in the same spot.</p>

<p>&#34;I need to see Willow, now!&#34; The slayer cried as she got yet another flash,
only this time it was of dead green eyes staring up at her. She tried again
to stand up but her body betrayed her and she fell back down, a sick
dizziness forming in her in her head. Her thoughts were growing even more
confused....</p>

<p>&#34;Giles, I'll carry her in there.&#34; Another people shaped blur said from the
doorway. &#34;Keeping them apart will only make her sick again.&#34; Xander spoke
walking over to the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;It is against my better judgment, Xander. Willow was up for forty-eight
straight hours and she needs her rest.&#34; Giles stated as he stood and faced
the young man.</p>

<p>&#34;I know, Giles, but Buffy won't wake her up. If anything having her there
will help them both rest.&#34; The slayer heard as the blankets were lifted off
of her and strong arms picked her.</p>

<p>&#34;I gotta say, I agree with Xander.&#34; Cordy piped in following the procession
down the hallway.</p>

<p>Xander gently placed her on the bed next to her soulmate and all Buffy could
think about doing was curling up around her and falling asleep despite the
audience.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Hela sat on her throne as she listened to the report from one of her vampire
spies in Kresis' camp. She knew it would not be long before her ex-mate
would be amiable to her offer of assistance and that would be his downfall.</p>

<p>It had now been a week since her success with her first intrusion into the
slayer's mind.</p>

<p>Like the majority of males, Kresis had made the mistake of underestimating
his opposition because they were female. He had tried to spring two more
ambushes on the Slayer and her mate-both had met with complete failure.</p>

<p>Hela herself had observed last night's ambush and she had to laugh at the
incompetence of Kresis and his troops.</p>

<p>The only thing he had accomplished was killing off a significant potion of
his forces and giving the little slayer vivid nightmares about the people he
had used as bait.</p>

<p>He'd obviously underestimated the Slayer and her lovely little witch and now
she was certain that he would underestimate her ambition, too. HE could
never understand her capacity for hatred and soon he'd be at her mercy.</p>

<p>For centuries she had chafed at the thought of her ex-partner still alive
and able to enjoy life's pleasures after she'd done her best to destroy him.</p>

<p>Exile would never be adequate revenge for her after what he had done! Once
she had total control of the Slayer, and her soulmate, then the council and
the Darklord would fear her!</p>

<p>Maybe she should raise her goals.... Mistress Darklord didn't sound so bad
to her! Either way once the slayer and the little Witch-Kit were under her
control and fully trained no one would dare act on her decision to rid
herself of that arrogant bastard Kresis.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Soon it will be time, &lt;&gt; she thought. &lt;&gt;Soon there will be no way that
fool will be able to refuse my terms and then it will be only a matter of
time until he is dead. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>She chuckled at her own cleverness.</p>

</table>

<p>&#34;Goddess, Cordy,&#34; Buffy whined sleepily.</p>

<p>It felt like she and Willow had only just fallen asleep when Cordy came
bouncing into the bedroom.  She was there to demand that Buffy come with her
to the seamstress for the final fitting.  Buffy had missed one of the
fittings because she had still been recovering from her illness.  Even now,
her mind shied away from memories of that ambush.</p>

<p>&#34;But, at least we were able to save the ones last night,&#34; she mumbled under
her breath.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>&#34;I said, you've made me go to that dungeon three times already, isn't that
enough torture, or do your especially hate me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, no, Miss Almighty Slayer,&#34; the beautiful brunette scolded. &#34;You know
for someone that's supposed to be so tough you sure are a baby about the
little things.&#34;  Cordy put on her best Queen C face. &#34;Now get your cute
little butt out of that damn bed and get dressed! If you are lucky to get
someone as great as Willow to marry you than you should be happy to do this
for her.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, do you really think I've got a cute little butt, Cordy?&#34; Buffy asked,
with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.  Buffy knew that there was no way
she should do what she was about to do-but she just felt too good to pass up
the chance to get one up on Cordy.</p>

<p>So, she pulled back the covers revealing her nude body to her painfully
straight friend. &#34;And here I was afraid it was getting too big, what do you
think?&#34;</p>

<p>The look on Cordelia's face was priceless!  &lt;&gt; She shoots and scores. &lt;&gt;
Buffy thought.</p>

<p>&#34;I...ah...well...oh...it's...I don't....&#34; Cordy stammered confused and
embarrassed by all the exposed Slayer flesh. &#34;You...really...&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was enjoying her friend's dilemma far too much to let her off the
hook.  It wasn't everyday that Cordelia Chase turned as red as an apple! So
in order to fluster the girl even further Buffy yawned and stretched like a
pampered cat, all the time watching Cordy fidget.</p>

<p>&#34;BUFFY!&#34; a familiar voice screamed at her as Willow appeared in the doorway
to their bedroom. &#34;Will you please leave poor Cordelia alone and get out of
that bed this minute.&#34;  Buffy looked up as the Witch stalked into the room
with both hands on her hips.  She closely resembled her mother at that very
moment.</p>

<p>&#34;Really, I can't leave you alone for a second without you pulling something
like this.&#34; Her incredible lover continued to scold her. &#34;What am I going to
do with you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ooooh, something wickedly nasty, I hope.&#34; Buffy purred sexily not quite
ready to let Cordy off the hook yet.  The exhibitionist slayer rose to a
sitting position and to Cordy's further frustration stretched again this
time for real.</p>

<p>&#34;Besides she started it.&#34; She said as she winked at her lover to join in the
fun.  &#34;Cordelia told me 'I had a cute little butt.'&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She what!&#34; Willow exclaimed incredulously, trying hard to maintain an
indignant pose. &#34;Cordelia Chase are you in here flirting with my fiancee?
You just stay away from her she's taken.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordy opened to her mouth to say something-but nothing came out.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, that's a first,&#34; the tiny slayer laughed from the bed.  &#34;Cordelia
Chase speechless!&#34;  Unable to keep her serious look any longer the witch
broke out laughing and was soon followed by a now covered Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I never...&#34; Cordy began unable to keep from smiling herself.</p>

<p>&#34;We know you never, not with us anyway.  I think that's why she teases you
so much.&#34; Willow explained to her friend. &#34;That and you're her match.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, hey, in the room, here!&#34; The blonde spoke from the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Oops, sorry honey,&#34; Willow apologize.</p>

<p>&#34;S'kay, you can make it up to me later.&#34; She winked again at her lover, this
time full of promises for later.</p>

<p>Then all three girls laughed as the reason for why Cordy was running so
later herself flashed across her face.  Buffy didn't think it was possible
for someone's face to be so red.</p>

<p>&#34;C'mon Cordy, I'll feed you breakfast while the flasher over there gets
dressed.&#34; Willow took the now fully embarrassed Cordy downstairs.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Knowing that Buffy and Cordelia would be busy at the fitting for most of the
day
Willow's mother decided to take advantage of their absence to ambush her
daughter.</p>

<p>Sheila Rosenberg had never been quite comfortable with her daughter's
lifestyle choices and now she had fallen in love with that Bunny person.
She thought not.  Willow may have fooled Ira, but she was no one's fool.  If
her daughter insisted on having this fiasco then the least they could do was
have a normal wedding! Or at least a semi-normal wedding, since it was with
another a girl.  And by normal Sheila meant the wedding She had always
wanted.</p>

<p>Then that Bunny person had foiled her plans by having her awful friend, that
Chase girl do the planing, and doing it all wrong to boot!  If she did say
so herself, which she did.</p>

<p>Sheila had fought Cordelia tooth and nail over every decision from the
napkins, (what was wrong with paper, didn't that Chase girl know how much a
cleaning bill for linen would be?)  To the actual wedding party, of course
the Blums from Nebraska had to be invited, their Great Grandfather had been
on the boat with great cousin Josh, once removed!</p>

<p>But the absolutely final straw was when she saw what her daughter was
wearing for the ceremony. Why, oh, why did Willow insist on that Bunny being
the bride?  Why? Because they wanted to put her, Sheila Rosenberg who had
suffered through 14 grueling hours of labor to bring Willow into the world,
into an early grave, that's why.</p>

<p>And on this one point Sheila Louise Rosenberg, Ph.D., was not going to give
in-her lovely, wonderful, daughter was going to be the bride!  Or else!
Besides, she had read about women couples and roles, and she knew that Bunny
was the &#34;man&#34; of the house.</p>

<p>So she waited until that awful Chase woman carted off Bunny to the final
fitting just so she could get her daughter alone.  If she had to she would
pull out the heavy duty guns-her father's bad heart.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>When Cordelia stopped her car in front of the townhouse Buffy let out a loud
sigh of relief, she was so glad to be finally home. This had been as close
to a day from the darkest pit of Hades, as she'd had in a while.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Cordelia asked getting out of her car.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; the slayer answered, following her, as she noticed a familiar car
parked in front of them.  &#34;Say, isn't that Mrs. Rosenberg's car?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, it can't be....&#34; Cordelia answered her.</p>

<p>Then Buffy's Slayer ears heard arguing coming from her house, and having an
idea what was going on the Slayer growled and stomped off toward the front
door with Cordelia following close behind her.</p>

<p>As they approached the front door the voices could be clearly heard. Buffy
and Cordelia looked at each other and groaned both knowing exactly what was
happening on the other side of the door.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow's head was pounding like there was a jackhammer in there trying to
get out. Her mother had been there for over 2 hours alternating between
yelling, whining, and browbeating.  All her arguments were also seasoned
liberally with a large dose of guilt.</p>

<p>Her mother was totally off the deep end about everything concerning the
wedding. All the details were up for grabs from her choice of clothing to
her role as the groom.</p>

<p>What had begun as a minor irritating throbbing at the back of Willow's skull
had grown into a full-fledged-sight-blurring-nausea causing, knee buckling
migraine.</p>

<p>Finally, the small Wyccan had taken just about all she could stand from her
&#34;loving&#34; mother.</p>

<p>&#34;Really Willow are you trying to embarrass your entire family with this
behavior!&#34; Sheila Rosenberg continued to screech.  She was seemingly enraged
by her own daughter's obstinacy.</p>

<p>&#34;I just don't know what has gotten into you. After all I've done for you,
this is how you repay me?&#34;</p>

<p>At that point Willow lost it.</p>

<p>&#34;What's that mother?&#34; the red head snapped. &#34;All you've done for me, mother.
What have you done for me mother?&#34;  Willow said quietly, least her head
would split wide open on the spot.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, lets see?  You were never there for me when I was lost and alone in
school.&#34;  The witch's said as her headache suddenly started getting better.
&#34;Oh, what else, do you know the humiliation of going to the school nurse to
learn about my menstrual cycle? Well?  What did you do for me then?&#34;</p>

<p>Now that she had started to pour out all her pent up emotions she couldn't
stop. &#34;The only person I ever had growing up was Xander and you treated him
like dirt.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, he was dirt, from the wrong side of town!&#34; Sheila retaliated.</p>

<p>&#34;Crap, mother he was my only friend until I got to high school!&#34; Willow
stood and walked over to the window remembering the day she met Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Then I met Giles and Buffy and Oz who treated me like a valuable person,
Mother, part of a team!&#34; The Witch turned back to her mother and saw the
hurt and anger on her face.  But, it only served to enrage the young woman
more, &#34;I was in love with Oz or at least thought I was....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;See this is what I mean,&#34; Sheila pounced.  &#34;You thought you were in love
with that dreadful musician-and now you 'think' you are in love with that
girl!  I just want to keep you from making the same awful mistake again!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow stalked over to mother, fury blazing in her eyes. &#34;That is just so
much stuff, mother.  I found a real true love in Buffy and then I almost
lost her because I was afraid it would embarrass you and Daddy!&#34;</p>

<p>Thinking about her Slayer made all the hurt and anger drain away from
Willow.</p>

<p>She added, speaking softly, &#34;I have a chance to be happy with someone that
loves me more than life itself.  But you wouldn't know about that, would
you?  If you did you would be happy for us instead of sitting here
screaming.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow could see that her mother was beyond livid.  The witch would place a
bet that none of her students had ever spoken to her like that before.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow Rosenberg, how dare you speak to me like that?&#34; Mrs. Rosenberg
yelled, outraged by what the young redhead was sure she felt was her
daughter's disrespectful outburst.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know who has led you to believe that you can just run over my
feelings this way, but I have an idea. I just know it was that Bunny that
put you up to this!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;One more time my name is Buffy that's B-U-F-F-Y, Buffy.&#34; Willow's lover and
protector said calmly from the doorway. The two Rosenberg women turned and
looked at the petite blonde that was leaning casually on the doorframe. From
the power radiating off her Willow could tell that her Slayer was in a mood.</p>

<p>&#34;Now would someone tell me where you get off coming here and treating my
fiancee this way?&#34; The Blonde asked.</p>

<p>One set of green eyes looked at the slayer with complete love, adoration,
and gratitude for her timely entrance.  Another, identical set of green eyes
narrowed in anger at the interruption.</p>

<p>&#34;I have every right to be here this is my daughter's home after all.&#34; Sheila
Rosenberg huffed haughtily.</p>

<p>&#34;True, very true,&#34; Buffy agreed as she walked slowly over to her Wills and
took the witch in her arms. &#34;But you see it's my home too and when you barge
in here and try to force the woman I love to bow down to your
selfishness--then my only recourse is to tell you to get out.&#34; She finished
calmly.</p>

<p>It was all Willow could take, so the girl turned to face the Slayer and
buried her face in the blonde's chest and started crying.</p>

<p>Her mother began to say something rude, but Buffy guessed the woman's
intention and cut her off.</p>

<p>&#34;I said leave Mrs. Rosenberg!&#34; Buffy growled angrily. &#34;You've done quite
enough already.&#34;</p>

<p>Seeing that she had lost this battle over the wedding and quite possibly
more, Willow's mother wisely shut her mouth and left without another word.</p>

<p>&#34;How much of that did you hear?&#34; Willow asked after the door slammed shut.
Hoping her slayer hadn't heard much of her infuriated speech.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh lover,&#34; Buffy started, lifting Willow's head so they were looking into
each other's eyes. &#34;I heard everything and I must say I am so proud to call
you my soulmate and lover!&#34;</p>

<p>Willow kissed her beloved slayer lightly then was pulled into another far
more passionate kiss by her soon to be wife.</p>

<p>The kiss lasted until Cordelia cleared her throat.</p>

<p>&#34;Geese you two give it a rest already.&#34; She said grumbly, &#34;I've had to deal
with that woman ever since you two put me in charge and nobody's rewarded me
like that!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What's the matter Cordy? Jealous?&#34; Willow quipped to tease their friend.</p>

<p>Cordelia scoffed at her accusation.</p>

<p>&#34;I told you, she thinks I got a cute butt,&#34; Buffy stated joining her lover
in the fun.</p>

<p>&#34;I...you...we...I mean I thought we covered that this morning.&#34; Cordelia
cried demurely showing off her acting skills. &#34;I mean I wouldn't dare covet
you, Buffy, imagine what Will would do to me? Besides if I was after anyone,
it would be Will, her's is cuter.&#34;</p>

<p>Both girls stared slack jawed at the grinning brunette.</p>

<p>&#34;I still got it!&#34; Queen C announced.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent going over details for the wedding and going
back and correcting the things they found that Willow's mother had secretly
changed.</p>

<p>Once again Cordy was an invaluable asset when it came to figuring out where
the overbearing woman had messed with their plans.</p>

<p>All three agreed that while they looked forward to the public event, they
would be glad to get it over with.</p>

<p>&#34;At least those Wyccan friends of yours from San Francisco knew some members
of a local Grove to help them set up the joining.&#34; Buffy sighed, &#34;We aren't
allowed to have anything to do with that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah I guess so,&#34; Willow said wistfully. &#34;It would have been easy
considering it's all written down so there's no guess work, like with this
little monster we've created here.&#34;</p>

<p>The three friends laughed then returned to finalizing the details of the
public wedding and the required reception that followed it.  Buffy and
Willow were very late for patrol that night.</p>
