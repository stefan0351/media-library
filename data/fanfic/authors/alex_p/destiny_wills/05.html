<p>The long shiny black limousine pulled smoothly into the parking lot
followed closely by two shorter chauffeured vehicles. All of them came
to a stop at the front of the big brick building that had been rented
for the reception. </p>

<p>Xander, Cordelia, Giles, and Joyce Summers exited the second car and
went directly into the building followed by Ira and Sheila Rosenberg. </p>

<p>After several minutes a frustrated Sheila Rosenberg came storming out of
the building and began pounding on the door of the limo that still
contained the newly weds. </p>

<p>"Willow!" the angry woman shouted. "Will you and your little friend get
out here right now?"
When she received no answer, Mrs. Rosenberg pounded so hard it hurt her
hand which made her even madder at the two young women in the car. </p>

<p>"Willow Rosenberg!" she yelled at the top of her lungs, her face beet
red with anger. "Get out here this instant. The guests will be arriving
any minute now and we need to set up the receiving line. This 'marriage'
is bad enough without the added embarrassment of being rude." </p>

<p>That worked better than she wanted. The door flew open and an extremely
enraged and dishevelled Willow Rosenberg-Summers jumped out of the limo
and into her mother's face. </p>

<p>"I've had just about enough of your attitude mother." Willow growled,
her entire body trembling with rage and hurt. "If you don't like the
idea of my wife and I letting the world know of our love, then there is
no reason for you to be here and Believe me, after the way you've acted
the last few weeks neither of us would miss you in the least. I will
personally see to it that you are escorted home and we'll make sure that
daddy gets home after the reception. So what is it mother, are you
staying or leaving?" </p>

<p>"Honey, please don't do this." Buffy whispered in her wife's ear. She
had followed Willow out of the limo and had stood calmly behind her
during the red-head's outburst at her overbearing mother. "You know how
your mother is and it isn't fair to expect her to become a different
person over night. This is our day don't let her ruin it." </p>

<p>Hearing her lover's plea on behalf of her own aggravating mother touched
the witch on so many levels that it took all her will not to release the
flood of tears that threatened to flow in rivers from her eyes.
It was hard to believe that after everything her mother had done to
them, her new bride still came to her defence. Even if they both thought
that. The guilt of throwing her mother out of the reception would have
wrecked the entire day for Willow, and Buffy was really thinking of her
lover when she spoke. </p>

<p>Sheila looked at the petite blonde slack jawed with surprise at her
words. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry love." Willow said. embarrassed when she calmed enough to
realise they were standing outside and that people were beginning to
arrive. "If you plan on staying mother, you'd better come in with us.
Just remember one more comment about my wife or our relationship and you
are out of here, not to mention out of our lives. Do you understand me?" </p>

<p>"Yes I understand." Mrs. Rosenberg said in defeat, realizing that she'd
over stepped herself and how lucky she was that her daughter's friend
had spoken up for her. "I'm sorry dear, I shouldn't have said that."
Silently accepting her mother's apology, Willow turned and wrapped her
arm around Buffy's waist kissing her lightly. </p>

<p>"You are truly amazing, you know that?" the red head told her bride.
"Every time I think I know how you'll react to something, you turn
around and do something like this. I so love you." </p>

<p>"Of course you do." Buffy said, smiling with complete adoration at her
love. "Don't you remember? I'm irresistible." </p>

<p>Both of the newly weds broke into peals of laughter as they led the way
to the doors.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The rest of the reception went fairly smoothly, thanks to Cordelia's
taking the time to research what was expected at both the usual
reception and what was done at a typical Jewish reception. </p>

<p>In order to keep the peace with Willow's family, she had been sure to
have a band to handle the traditional dances and activities so that the
Rosenberg's relatives were satisfied. </p>

<p>Once that part of the party was over and most of the older crowd had
left, Cordelia had arranged for the DJ from the Bronze to take over the
musical entertainment. </p>

<p>Having prepared for the change in atmosphere the girls had Xander go out
to their cars in the parking lot and bring in their bags that had a
change of clothes. </p>

<p>Once they were dressed in more casual clothing and the Rosenbergs had
gone on home the two lovers felt free to relax and enjoy themselves. </p>

<p>Surrounded by their friends they knew they had no reason to worry about
offending anyone, and were free to express their intense feelings for
each other. </p>

<p>They danced, drank, laughed, and had fun with their guests, not to
mention many PDAs. Finally they reached the point where they were
getting tired and Buffy began talking about retiring to the posh hotel
that their friends had all chipped in and got them for their wedding
night. </p>

<p>"I know you're tired honey." Willow whispered in the Slayer's ear. "But
if you'll just give me one more dance we'll ditch this place and head
for the sheets, okay?"
"Anything for you sweetie." Buffy answered, while nibbling at her
lover's ear, causing the witch to groan. "But don't take too long. I
need to have you now. And if you don't want to live one of Xander's
fantasies, you'll be getting me out of here soon." </p>

<p>"No probs, babe." Willow said, gulping hard. "Just a little patience. I
promise it'll be worth it. I hope." </p>

<p>Willow went over and said something to the DJ who smiled and nodded to
her, then reached out and shook the girl's hand. Willow turned and
strolled back to her curious lover, smiling brightly. </p>

<p>"What are you up to?" the blonde asked suspiciously, as she melted into
her beloved's arms. </p>

<p>"It's just...well..I kinda...this is..." Willow tried to explain, tongue
tied with emotion. "Ever since this song came out it's made me think of
you and how I felt about you. I'd be willing to bet I wore out 10 or 20
of these CDs just listening to it over and over. And I figured I'd share
it with you and hope it meant as much to you as it does to me." </p>

<p>"I'm sure it will, my love." Buffy answered, her voice thick with the
deep feelings she felt at her lover's admission. </p>

<p>Willow gathered Buffy into her arms tightly, as the DJ began the CD and
the music came flooding from the sound system. The Slayer felt as much
as heard her partner singing softly into her ear.</p>

<p>{{"And I'd give up forever to touch you | Cause I know that you feel me somehow | Your the closest to heaven that I'll ever be | And I don't wanna go home right now"}}</p>

<p>Buffy was oblivious to every thing around her. Her entire being was
focused on the beautiful alto voice of her universe singing in her ear
and the words being written on her soul.</p>

<p>{{"And all I can taste is this moment | And all I can breath is your life | And sooner or later it's over | I just don't wanna miss you tonight"}}</p>

<p>Willow could feel her heart pouring out of her and into the woman she
loved with each word. She was trying to convey all the soul searing
emotions that her heart felt for this tiny woman that she was holding in
her arms. Hoping all the while that her reason for being was
experiencing the same thing.</p>

<p>{{"And I don't want the world to see me | Cause I think that they'd understand | When everything's made to be broken | I just want you to know who I am"}}</p>

<p>Both young were entranced with each other and didn't even notice when
everyone else cleared the dance floor to watch the tender moment
occurring between the newlyweds.</p>

<p>{{"And you can't fight the tears that ain't comin | Or the moment of truth in your lies | When everything feels like the movies | And you bleed just to know you're alive"}}</p>

<p>Willow was overcome by her emotions and her throat was too tight to
finish to sing the final chorus. All she could do was hold her Buffy
tightly in her arms and let her feelings flow in mute rivers into the
ocean of her lover's soul. </p>

<p>Knowing the deep need to express herself that her new bride was trying
to deal with, Buffy remained silent and held on to the trembling
red-head letting the waves of emotion wash over her. </p>

<p>When the music stopped they continued to hold on to each other in the
middle of the dance floor. In order to minimise an awkward moment,
Cordelia signalled the DJ to play something else and, pulling Xander
onto the dance floor, began to dance. </p>

<p>Thus drawing attention away from the two entranced lovers, who were
totally absorbed in each other, oblivious to those around them. </p>

<p>Finally remembering that they weren't alone the newlyweds went to the
bar to have one last drink before sneaking out.
Raising their glasses to Cordelia in thanks for all her hard work, they
finished the drinks in one gulp. </p>

<p>They were setting down their drinks in preparation to leave when one of
their friends came up to them and handed Buffy a note. </p>

<p>"I don't know what it is." the young man explained. "This guy I've never
seen before, that was dressed like Rambo or something, gave it to me and
asked me to bring it to you. To be honest he was kinda scary so I did
what he said, I hope that's okay." </p>

<p>"No problem Jerry." Willow told the obviously still frightened young man
while her partner read the note. "It's probably a good idea that you
did. Cause if it's from who I think it is, you're right, he is scary." </p>

<p>Mumbling his thanks the young man rejoined the rest of the party and
went back to enjoying the festivities. Willow turned and looked at her
lover as the blonde read the note. </p>

<p>"What is it, Buffy?" Willow asked, worried that their one night
honeymoon was about to be called off. "Is everything alright?" </p>

<p>"I guess it's okay." the Slayer mumbled as she finished the missive and
handed it to the witch. "Check it out for yourself and see what you make
of it." </p>

<p>Willow took the note from her partner and the first thing she noticed
was the heavy bond paper that it was written on. Next she saw that it
was written with a neat flowing hand that while written with an ancient
form of lettering but the note was easy to read and was obviously
written by a well educated and in an aristocratic style by someone with
lots of practice at writing reports and messages. </p>

<p>The most surprising and somewhat frightening thing was who it was from
and what they wanted. She read it over several times to be sure that she
hadn't misunderstood it's meaning.</p>

<p><i>To The Slayer and The Sorceress </i></p>

<p><i>Ladies,<br>
I would greatly appreciate it if you would both meet myself and my
personal guard in the parking lot. </i></p>

<p><i>We mean you no harm and wish to relay information that I am sure you
will find both necessary and at least partially welcome. </i></p>

<p><i>Please come as it would be inconvenient for all concerned if I was
compelled to enter the building to deliver my message.</i></p>

<p><i>With Respect</i></p>

<p><i>Kresis<br>
Count of the First Circle<br>
Lord of the House of Red Swords </i></p>

<p>Willow looked at her wife and waited for her to indicate what course of
action they would take. </p>

<p>"Well it looks like he's given us no choice." The Slayer said, shrugging
her shoulders. "I thought about having you stay here, but he asked for
both of us and besides that you wouldn't stay anyway." </p>

<p>"You're darn skippy on that." Willow announced fiercely . "That's the
deal now. Where you go, I go, no discussion no, compromises. You got
that almighty Slayer?" </p>

<p>"Yes my loving wife and Sorceress." Buffy said, beaming at the red
head's resolve and devotion. "All or nothing from now on." </p>

<p>"You got it." the witch agreed, and linked arms with her lover. "Let's
go sweetie. We got a Count to see." </p>

<p>The two women walked out of the building and stepped into the well lit
parking lot. They strolled casually over to Willow's car and leaned on
it to await their visitor.
They didn't have to wait long. </p>

<p>Two dark figures separated from the shadows surrounding the parking area
and slowly approached them keeping their hands in sight to make the
point that they were unarmed and came in peace. Willow took the time to
study the two entities the were coming toward them. </p>

<p>One was the soldier she'd seen after the fight with Hela, she could tell
by the way he moved and the black patch over his right eye. </p>

<p>The other was the tall regal 'man' that had confronted the demoness and
although he had failed to destroy or capture her, he had caused her to
run away. He was walking with a slight limp and Willow saw that he was
missing his right arm. </p>

<p>When they were within a couple of feet Buffy stopped them. </p>

<p>"I think that's close enough gentlemen." the Slayer said holding out a
hand "I believe you said you had some news for us. So what is it? We
have friends to get back to." </p>

<p>"Ah right to the point Slayer, I can respect that." the one armed 'man'
remarked with a slightly quirky smile. "Especially on ones wedding
night." </p>

<p>He gripped the Slayer's forearm in the traditional warrior's greeting,
followed by the second figure. The Count then turned and lifting
Willow's offered hand let his lips brush across the back of her hand. </p>

<p>Willow blushed at this courtesy and a low defensive growl came from her
lover. In respect for the Slayer's feelings the Count released the hand
and stepped back. His companion simply bowed respectfully to the witch
then rejoined his commander. </p>

<p>"First I suppose I should introduce my companion and myself." Kresis
said, looking at the two warriors that had fought him and Hela to a
stand still, his respect for them rising as he realized how young they
were. "As I said in my note, I am Count Kresis and this is my aide,
general, and friend Caladin, and first I would like to convey or
congratulations and best wishes on this momentous occasion." </p>

<p>"Thank you." Willow answered quickly, before her lover could come up
with an insult for these unexpected allies. "But I'm sure you didn't go
through all the trouble to get us out here just to wish us well." </p>

<p>"Quite so, Sorceress." the Count answered. "I can see you are perceptive
as well as powerful and beautiful. No we didn't come here to wish you
well, I am here to give you some good news and a warning.
First of all we have searched thoroughly and all indications are that
our mutual opponent has left not only this town but this country all
together.
We will continue to hunt the bitch until we have delivered her to
justice in our home realm.
However I must warn you that Hela is a spiteful and vindictive being and
as long as she is free to roam your realm neither of you is completely
secure.
She hates to lose and she despises loose ends, and the two of you are
both.
Do not doubt for a second that she will be trying to come up with a way
to get back at you both in the most painful way she can conceive." </p>

<p>"We thank you for the warning Count." Buffy said thoughtfully. "Believe
me, we will take it to heart. I also wish you luck in your hunt, for
obvious reasons and to thank you, Caladin and your warriors, for your
best wishes and concern for our well being.
I only hope that we are not forced to face each other as enemies at some
future time." </p>

<p>"I wish the same Chosen One." came Caladin's gruff voice in reply. "But
if that should come to pass, you will be an enemy I will face with honor
and respect. Be Well." </p>

<p>The two figures bowed and turned, quickly disappearing into the night,
leaving the two young women looking at each in wonder at the old battle
scared veteran's parting words. </p>

<p>Willow looked over at her wife and didn't need to know her thoughts to
know what was going through her mind. </p>

<p>"Well that was semi-good news." Willow said lightly, trying to relieve
some of the tension their visitors had caused. "At least we can get
through the rest of the joining without having to worry about that not
so nice female trying to take you away from
me." </p>

<p>She gave the Slayer one of her best don't-worry-about-me smiles and took
the lovely blonde into a tight embrace. Willow could feel the tense
muscles relax as Buffy melted into the warm loving pressure of the
witch's embrace. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before all thoughts of Kresis, Hela, or any future
problems with either of them were driven from the Slayer's mind by her
lover's persistent attentions. </p>

<p>"What do you say we go inside, say our goodbyes and get this honeymoon
thing on the road?" Willow whispered into Buffy's ear. The warm air of
the red head's breath washed over Buffy's ear causing the Slayer to
shiver with excitement. </p>

<p>"Oh yeah." the blonde said, her voice horse with anticipation. "That's
the best idea I've heard since we got here."</p>

<p>Holding hands the two newlyweds ran into the building and bid their
remaining friends a fond farewell and told everyone to stay as long as
they liked. They were soon in Willow's car and headed toward the most
exclusive hotel in Sunnydale. </p>

<p>Willow parked her car in the covered lot and, after checking in at the
front desk, the two excited young women went to their room on the top
most floor. </p>

<p>When they entered the room they were both stunned by the opulence of the
room (suite really) that their friends had gotten them. </p>

<p>The entire suite was the very definition of understated elegance. While
under normal circumstances, they would have spent hours exploring every
inch of the rooms thoroughly. But on this night, after a cursory
examination, they were only interested in each other. </p>

<p>They fell into each other's arms and began kissing each other
passionately, tongues swirling around each other, trying to inspect
every centimeter of the other's oral cavity, while anxious hands tore
off clothing desperate to feel and taste bare skin. </p>

<p>Both were breathing heavily, interspersed with pleading whimpers for
more intimate contact. </p>

<p>Finally, after their clothing was scattered all over the area and their
knees were ready to buckle with unrequited lust, Buffy scooped her
red-haired bride into her arms and without breaking the kiss, carried
her willing captive into the adjoining bedroom and gently laid her on
the soft comfortable oversized mattress. </p>

<p>Buffy looked deeply into the eyes of her existence and saw only
overwhelming love and all consuming passion there. </p>

<p>Then with a growl of pure lust the Slayer took the body that held the
other half of her soul and the two lovers spent the rest of the night
satisfying the call of their needs and most primal urges, their names
being called out to the gods until they both collapsed in total and
sated exhaustion still holding each other as they drifted off into a
contented dreamless sleep. </p>

<p>The next morning, just as the sun made it's daily appearance on the
Eastern horizon and shafts of red, orange, and golden light lanced
through the cloudless sky driving away the last vestiges of night, the
two still very tired women were wakened by a persistent knocking at the
heavy oak door of their suite. </p>

<p>A grumpy half asleep red head untangled herself from her blonde lover
and, pulling on a robe, she went to answer the door. </p>

<p>As Willow suspected, when she opened the door she was greeted by two
gray robed Druids. Their hoods were up and it was impossible to see
their faces. </p>

<p>They were accompanied by four women that Willow recognised as members of
the coven that was assisting with their formal joining ceremony. </p>

<p>The six came in and one of the priests faced Willow ad placed his hands
gently on her shoulders. </p>

<p>"It is time for you to prepare, Sorceress." the man informed her in a
deep resonate voice that reminded the witch of their friend Lugh. "You
and your beloved, the sister of your soul, must now accompany us to the
place set aside for the preliminaries required by tradition for the
completion of your becoming as one." </p>

<p>"I understand." Willow answered solemnly. "I will awaken my other half
and we will follow your instructions." </p>

<p>With a nod from the priest, Willow and the four attendants went into the
bedroom and, with a fair amount of trouble, finally managed to wake a
reluctant Buffy. With the assistance of their attendants, both were
dressed only in two intricately embroidered black and silver velvet
robes.
Once they were ready the group joined the two priests that were
patiently waiting for them in the other room. Each priest approached one
of the two women and simultaneously explained the procedures to be
followed for the day. </p>

<p>"From now until tonight's ceremony, the two of you will be separated."
the priests droned. "We will be with you through out the day to assist
you in the various necessary rituals that must be performed. This is the
way it has been done for countless generations and has been handed down
by our forebears. Now if you will accompany us after bidding your
beloved a temporary farewell, the rituals shall begin." </p>

<p>With a quick kiss and whispered words of encouragement, the two young
lovers left each with one priest and two of the females. Neither knowing
for sure what they would face that day and each knowing that no matter
what was asked of them they would do it because that was what was
necessary for them to be together completely and forever. </p>

<p>If nothing else Willow was sure this would be an adventure. </p>

</table>

<p>Wearing only the intricately designed ceremonial robes given them by
their attendants, Buffy and Willow followed the priests down the back
stairway to the covered parking area where two identical unmarked panel
vans were waiting for them, complete with drivers. The doors were opened
revealing an enclosed area with four comfortable looking 'captains'
chairs. </p>

<p>"From here we go our separate ways." the first priest told them.
"Slayer, if you will accompany my brother and join him in that vehicle,
he will see that all your questions are answered to your satisfaction.
You will be taken to a sacred place to complete your preparations for
tonight's ceremony." </p>

<p>With a nervous glance at the enclosed van, Buffy turned an imploring
look to her lover. Willow gave her a reassuring smile and, with a show
of total confidence, the witch climbed into the van assigned to her. </p>

<p>The first priest and two of the women followed the red head into the van
closing the doors behind them. Seeing that her partner put her trust in
these people, Buffy followed her example and quickly climbed into the
van and with some difficulty eventually made herself comfortable in the
reclining seat provided for the trip. </p>

<p>Once everyone was in their respective places and getting a signal from
their passengers, the drivers started the vans and with profession skill
eased them into traffic, pointing them east toward the heavily wooded
hills that over looked Sunnydale. </p>

<p>Unable to see the outside, Willow relaxed into her seat and reached out
to her partner with her mind. Feeling her lover's confusion and near
panic at being separated from the other half of her soul, Willow sent
the Slayer reassuring and comforting thoughts hoping to calm her lover
and allay her fears for Willow's well being. </p>

<p>Finally sensing the Slayer's uneasy acceptance of her companion's
thoughts, the young witch could feel her lover reluctantly surrendering
to the circumstance, temporarily at least. </p>

<p>That accomplished, the red head allowed herself to relax into the
oversized reclining seat for the remainder of the ride. </p>

<p>After a little over an hours ride into the hilly wilderness overlooking
Sunnydale, the van turned down a side road that, judging by the sounds
coming from the tires, was gravel instead of the asphalt they'd been on. </p>

<p>Shortly the van slowed to a smooth stop, and without any undue ceremony
the doors of the van opened flooding the compartment with sunlight,
fresh air and the sounds of a beautiful summers day.
Willow followed the others out of the van. She looked around and was
pleasantly surprised. </p>

<p>"This is very nice." Willow commented, enchanted by her surroundings. "I
only hope it's not as rustic as it appears." </p>

<p>"Don't worry Sorceress." the young brunette attendant named Kati said
softly, not wanting to disturb the peace of the moment. "It may be
isolated here, but the areas have all the modern convinces, including
telephones." </p>

<p>"Thank the Goddess." Willow sighed wistfully, then looked around for the
other van. "Where's Buffy?" </p>

<p>"Your Slayer is at an almost identical facility about a half mile from
here." the priest reassured her. "She is going through the same
preparations as you." </p>

<p>"Okay. but I wish your friends luck if Buffy doesn't want to be
prepared." Willow chuckled softly, and not without sympathy.
"That's true, Sorceress." the second blonde haired attendant named
Timmra quipped knowingly. "However I believe both of you will find the
process of preparation quite enjoyable." </p>

<p>The two women giggled and Willow noticed a conspiratorial glance between
the two women that made her wonder just what she was in for over the
next several hours. </p>

<p>The priest gave a blessing over the grounds and the three women and with
a bow excused himself, promising to return later in time to escort them
to the circle for the ceremony. </p>

<p>Once he was gone the two women led a leery red headed witch to a small
dome topped building. They opened the entrance and Willow could smell
the pleasant aroma of cedar mixed with herbs and spices. </p>

<p>They led her into the small cedar lined room and helped their charge out
of her robe leaving her naked and bade her sit on a long towel covered
bench build into the back wall of the room. </p>

<p>As they left Kati flipped a switch and turned a dial that started the
system that produced steam by intermittently spraying water on heated
rocks. Then they left her there alone to relax, and meditate while they
attended to other details. </p>

<p>Willow sat back and let out a sigh of contentment, telling herself to
remember to thank the Goddess for whoever it was that thought of this
part of the preparations, they were true geniuses. </p>

<p>She was feeling almost too good especially after a day like yesterday. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;And a night like last night.&lt;&gt; she thought to herself, a grin of pure
animal pleasure on her face. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before Willow's mind was feeling waves of pleasure from
some where other than her own body. </p>

<p>A slow sexy smile came over her face as her lover's feelings joined her
own. Their two kindred spirits communed on an etherial plain far more
harmonious than their own, as time became a thing of no consequence. All
that mattered was the feeling of true peace and contentment that washed
over them. </p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity squeezed into a minute, Willow felt
herself being drawn back to the confines of her corporeal self. She
frowned as she recognised the disturbance as someone calling her name. </p>

<p>Willow looked up to put a face to the soft yet insistent voice that
interrupted her visions and frowned slightly as the blonde's name evaded
her memory momentarily. </p>

<p>"Pardon me for disturbing you, friend Willow." the older woman
apologised misinterpreting the frown. "But the time has come for you to
move forward with your preparations." </p>

<p>"Oh...I..uh...I mean sure, Timmra." the witch almost shouted, as the
attendant's popped into her mind. "Don't apologise. I was just thinking
is all and I didn't hear you until just now." </p>

<p>"That's alright, dear." Timmra assured her. "This is a big day for you
and your Slayer and you're allowed to suffer from a little nervous
tension. I mean I'm nervous, and I'm only here to assist." </p>

<p>Both women laughed the tension broken. Timmra handed the red-head a
large fluffy towel to wrap around herself and led her to a shower in the
main cabin, so the sweaty young woman could rinse off. </p>

<p>Once Willow was rinsed off, she was instructed to wrap the towel around
herself again and follow Timmra to another room, where Kati was waiting
for them standing next to a long narrow padded leather table.
The two attendants helped the now curious red head up onto the table
and, after removing the towel, had Willow lay on her stomach. </p>

<p>As shy as she had always been, Willow was more than a little unsure
about being disrobed in front of these two fairly unknown women. </p>

<p>Fortunately they had been chosen for this duty for their ability to be
reassuring to others no matter the situation no matter how little they
knew them. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before the red-head was laughing and chatting happily
with her new found friends as if she'd known them all her life and
wasn't totally naked while they were wearing hardly anything themselves. </p>

<p>Once Willow was relaxed, Kati retrieved two bottles of scented massage
oil that had been warming in a pan of hot water. </p>

<p>She and Timmra poured a liberal amount of the fragrant oil in their
hands and began gently rubbing it into the soft skin of their charges
neck and back. </p>

<p>Taking their time the two women used their talented strong hands to work
out every kink and knot in every muscle in Willow's body, from her neck
all the way down to the soles of her feet. </p>

<p>When they finished massaging her feet the red head was so relaxed she
couldn't move. At least she didn't think so until Kati helped her roll
over and the two women began to repeat the process on the front side of
the now very red witch. </p>

<p>The normally demure young woman would have nearly fainted from
embarrassment, but her life with Buffy and the bond they shared had done
wonders for her self esteem and confidence, but even her new-found
strength met it's match when the two talented (and quite attractive, she
was forced to admit to herself) women began working their wonders on the
muscles of the front side of her fully exposed front. </p>

<p>The erotic possibilities of their particular talent was not lost on
their charge and she feared that any reaction she might have to their
admittedly enjoyable ministrations would be misconstrued and create an
undesired complication for all concerned. </p>

<p>Despite her fears the two women ceased their attentions long before
their charge felt anything but relaxed. They left Willow to rest while
the next phase of the process was being prepared. </p>

<p>Once again Willow's thoughts floated to that etherial plane where she
enjoyed complete freedom of spirit. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;This has got to be what Heaven is like.&lt;&gt; Willow thought to herself
.&lt;&gt;I
hope Buffy is feeling this good.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>A smile crossed her lips as she reached and felt her lovers own feelings
of pure pleasure. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I'll have to remember to get some pointers from Kati and Timmra before
we leave.&lt;&gt; the smiling red-head decided. &lt;&gt;I bet even the Chosen One
couldn't resist this, especially with a couple of extra moves added.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>After allowing the young bride to enjoy this rare opportunity to
completely relax for a while, Kati returned for her and led the still
groggy witch to another room that contained a huge sunken tub filled
with hot scented water. </p>

<p>The two women helped Willow into the tub, then gently bathed her. The
red head was nearly unaware of what her two companion were doing until
they were nearly finished. She was amazed a how secure and safe these
two, up till now, strangers had made her feel. </p>

<p>They left her up to her chin in the tub, her back resting against the
side of the fiberglass nirvana, her head laid back over the edge, her
eyes closed in total serenity.
Willow was completely oblivious to the concept of time and was totally
unaware of the hour when her attendants returned for her. </p>

<p>"The hour of your joining draws near, friend Willow." Timmra said, her
clear soft voice gently interrupting the young woman's thoughts. "It is
time to finish your preparations." </p>

<p>"Ah okay if you say so." the redhead agreed. "But you have no idea how
hard this is to leave." </p>

<p>With a quiet chuckle the older woman helped Willow from the tub and with
Kati's assistance, used large soft towels to dry the slight red-head's
body. </p>

<p>They led her to another room where they helped her, brushing out the
scarlet shoulder length locks until they shone with a luster all it's
own, the light reflecting flaming highlights causing the halo effect
that so enraptured her lover. </p>

<p>Finally they helped Willow into her gown and stepped back to admire the
results of their daylong efforts. Both women gasped at the regal beauty
of this naive yet powerful woman. </p>

<p>They had realized that she was pretty when they had begun, but now
the sight of her dazzled and humbled them. </p>

<p>Now they saw what Buffy saw every time she looked at her beloved Willow. </p>

<p>"She truly is the great Sorceress." Kati, the younger of the two,
whispered in awe of the sight. </p>

<p>"Yes she is my dear." her elder companion said reverently. "The true
mate of the Slayer." </p>

<p>Suddenly aware of their own need to get ready the two women excused
themselves. </p>

<p>"If you will wait in the entry room we will join you shortly." Timmra
told her. "I believe you will find a gift awaiting there for you." </p>

<p>With a sly knowing smile the older woman followed her friend out of the
room. </p>

<p>As Willow entered the front room of the cabin her nose was the first to
notice that something in the room had changed since she'd entered it
hours earlier. </p>

<p>The fragrance of flowers assaulted her sense of smell following her nose
the witch saw a huge bouquet of flowers.
She smiled when she saw it consisted of white roses (Buffy's favorite)
and her own favorite lilies. </p>

<p>Examining the floral display closely Willow found a note written in her
lovers well known hand. </p>

<p><i>For my Wills<br>
With everything I am.<br>
 B. </i></p>

<p>Unfolding the paper the bleary eye red head found an ancient poem that
Buffy had liked from the minute Willow showed to her. </p>

<p><i>Join with me under a garland of stars,<br>
Conifers silent witness<br>
To night winds echoed vows<br>
Throughout universal whiteness<br>
The sepulchre of the Gods<br>
Touch me once for all time<br>
All lives that are to be<br>
Our love enshrined<br>
Join with me under the gaze of the stars, <br>
Celestial concourse, Bless our joy<br>
Now and forever more<br>
Join me, my sister, my soul, my love </i></p>

<p>Willow could feel the hot tears fall from eyes to leave trails down her
cheeks, and when her two companions joined her and inquired as to the
reason for her tears she showed them the note. They too were soon in
tears. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Thank the Goddess for waterproof make-up.&lt;&gt; Willow thought with a
slight smile. &lt;&gt;I got a feeling it will get a work out before this night
is through.&lt;&gt; </p>

</table>

<p>The three women's tear-fest was interrupted by a heavy knock on the
door. </p>

<p>"Who is it?" Willow asked a little more abruptly than she meant. </p>

<p>"It is time to go, Sorceress." a deep voice answered from the other side
of the door. "I had hoped you were expecting me, the moon is rising." </p>

<p>"Sorry." Willow said sheepishly, realizing how harsh she'd sounded. "I
hadn't noticed the time." </p>

<p>"That's quite all right, my child." the priest returned, feeling an
affinity for this young, powerful, yet gracious witch he'd only just
recently met. "A certain nervous anxiety is to be expected on such a
momentous occasion." </p>

<p>Her two attendants helped her on with her cloak and fastened it at the
throat with the pentagram fastener. </p>

<p>The priest handed her the staff she'd received from Teach Tu Dannan.
Then, while the two other women placed and secured a crown of Holly and
Black Oak leaves on the soon to be joined woman's head, the priest
intoned an ancient blessing. </p>

<p>"Now shall we proceed." the older man said and led the way out the door.
"You will be blindfolded before we enter the sacred grounds. I hope this
is not a problem." </p>

<p>"Of course not." Willow stated. "I've done my homework." </p>

<p>That brought a smile to the priest's lips as he handed her a strand of
rope that hung from his belt. </p>

<p>The priest and the two attending witches each took up a torch that had
been placed outside the cabin and lit them from a small fire at the
beginning of the path that led through the woods to the clearing where
the ceremony was to be held. </p>

<p>As she was led through the dense woods by her escorts Willow began to
hear a deep resonant chanting, in an ancient language she'd never heard
before, that grew louder with every step they took. There was also the
sound of drums and if her senses weren't fooling her someone was playing
a flute. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before the witch could tell by the sounds and the feel of
the atmosphere that her party had reached the clearing. </p>

<p>Her blindfold was removed and she found herself standing at one end of
an aisle formed by people in either grey Druid robes or the black and
silver robes of Willow's friends' coven. Each was holding a flaming
torch. </p>

<p>Willow hesitated for a moment in awe of the spectacle she beheld.
Looking around she noticed the scene took on an even more surrealistic
appearance as a thick white fog rose from the ground surrounding the
clearing. She looked to the priest that had escorted her to the area. </p>

<p>"Your destiny awaits Sorceress." the man said, softly indicating that
she should proceed down the aisle. "Go forth and join with your
beloved." </p>

<p>Willow took the candle offered her by the priest, who then took his
place with the others forming the aisle. She walked slowly down the
aisle hearing the gasps as many of those gathered were seeing her for
the first in the green velvet silver trimmed gown and cloak given her by
Brigit. </p>

<p>As she reached the center of the clearing Willow set her eyes on her
lover and as always was breathless at the sight, but this time more than
normal. </p>

<p>Buffy too was wearing the clothing given her by the Morrigan, but the
sight of her lover in the leather tunic, short dark blue skirt and knee
high leather boots set the young witch's blood on fire. </p>

<p>Buffy also wore a crown of Holly and Black Oak leaves but, unlike Willow
who wore her hair loose letting the flaming waves cascade to her
shoulders, the Slayer wore her blonde locks pulled back into a french
braid that hung down her back. </p>

<p>Thoughts of ravaging the blonde beauty filled the red head's mind and
reading her lover's thoughts Buffy favored her with a dazzling smile
that told the hormonal young woman that they both were feeling the same
thing. </p>

<p>Continuing her walk toward the altar where her lover waited Willow
noticed the two coven members that stood beside the Slayer. Remembering
her time with the two women that were accompanying her, she felt a
momentary twinge of jealousy knowing that they had touched her Slayer as
intimately as Kati and Timmra had touched her. </p>

<p>The feeling was gone almost as quickly as it came but not quick enough
that the Slayer didn't notice her lover's feelings and gave her
Sorceress a disapproving frown that fleetingly crossed her features. </p>

<p>Willow felt a small pang of guilt at her momentary lack of trust in her
soulmate and quickly mouthed an apology to her slightly hurt partner,
who once again gave her that all forgiving adoring smile that was
reserved only for Willow. </p>

<p>As the witch approached the altar the priests and witches holding the
torches filed in after her forming a circle around the altar and the
wedding party. </p>

<p>When Willow reached her lover's side, Buffy leaned over and lightly
kissed her beloved's lips then side by side they turned to face the
altar. </p>

<p>A frail looking old priest in a heavily decorated robe, leaning heavily
on his intricately carved staff, stepped up to the opposite side of the
altar from the couple and their sponsors. </p>

<p>He nodded to a younger man in a pure white robe. The young priest held a
large sword up and began walking around the outside of the circle. </p>

<p>On his first trip around all was silent. On the second trip he stopped
at the compass points as the priest or witch that stood there called
that corner. That's when the first strange event of the night happened. </p>

<p>The young priest's first stop was at the Northern point and as the
priest that was there called for the guardian of the element of earth, a
huge white wolf stepped out of the thick impenetrable fog and went
directly to the north point where he sat and, with his tongue hanging
out in a canine smile, looked expectantly at the old priest. </p>

<p>The old man smiled and was heard to say "Welcome Icerunner." then
indicated for the young, obviously frightened, priest to continue. </p>

<p>At the East corner a grey wolf came out of the fog and, when seated, was
greeted as Dawnchaser the guardian of Air. </p>

<p>From the South came the red wolf called Firewalker guardian of Fire and
from the West came Wavedancer the black wolf guardian of Water. </p>

<p>The now pale and shaken young priest then began his third circuit of the
circle he began chanting the casting of the circle of protection, until
he ended up where he started. He then returned to the old high priest
and awaited his next duty. </p>

<p>The old priest turned and looked at the two young people in front of him
and with an amused twinkle in his surprisingly bright hazel eyes gave
the now even more nervous couple a friendly grin. </p>

<p>"I would call that an auspicious start, wouldn't you?" he said with an
infectious chuckle. "It seems the powers want you two together so I'd
better get this dog and pony show on the road. An old man like me can't
afford to get the powers mad at him." </p>

<p>Everyone around the alter heard him and they all couldn't help but let
out a tense chuckle, which was what he was shooting for. </p>

<p>Letting a serious expression come over his features he pounded his iron
shod staff on the ground 3 times to call everyone's attention. </p>

<p>"You have come to this altar of your own free will to join with your
chosen mate." he turned and looked at Buffy and Willow who nodded their
agreement then he continued to the spectators. "Who sponsors and
supports this union of souls?" </p>

<p>The four witches that had accompanied them started to step forward to
vouch for the couple but found they couldn't move or speak. The air
between them and the couple seemed to shimmer and bend then three
figures stepped out of a portal. </p>

<p>"That would be our place." came the husky voice of the statuesque red
head who turned to Buffy and smiled mischievously. "Did you think this
would go by without our notice Slayer?" </p>

<p>"Morrigan!" Buffy shouted, and grabbed the tall woman in a fierce hug
that would have broken a lesser person. "Gods I'm glad you guys came,
but we weren't sure it was allowed." </p>

<p>Brigit walked up to a happily tearful Willow and kissed her lightly on
the cheek. </p>

<p>"You are restarting a circle that we thought was gone for eternity." the
soft reassuring voice of Brigit began. "And with the two of you taking
over where we were forced to leave off, all those many generations ago,
we simply could not miss it." </p>

<p>"Now that all is as it should be, friend priest, let us begin." Lugh
called out, his deep voice reverberating through the night air. "Before
these women drown us in tears of joy." </p>

<p>Morrigan sniffed and shot a withering at her friend and ancient mentor,
to which he returned a knowing and compassionate smile. </p>

<p>"We have come to sponsor these new Sisters of the Soul." Morrigan
announced proudly. "And to promise our support and the support of all
that follow our path." </p>

<p>The old priest nodded his head and for a moment was at a loss for words.
Even he, who thought he'd seen everything, had to admit that in all his
years not once had a legendary god figure actually come to a ceremony. </p>

<p>Now here in this quiet little burg three of the most famous of the
ancient Celtic legends had come to sponsor a lesbian couple. </p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and swore to himself to get good and drunk
before he tried to comprehend what was happening.
The old priest picked up a razor sharp two edged dagger from the alter
and held it in front of him over the altar. Willow reached out her hand
and placed it palm up under the blade and Buffy placed her hand palm
down over the blade lacing her fingers with those of her love. </p>

<p>Morrigan picked up a long green and white ribbon and tied it around
their hands so that they held the knife tightly between their palms. </p>

<p>Facing each other Buffy and Willow gazed deeply into the eyes of the
person they loved most in the world and simultaneously began the ritual
they'd learned by heart from the Book of Souls.

"I give you that which is mine to give" </p>

<p>The voices of the two lover's recited harmonised, their expressions
showing that they meant every word they were saying.</p>

<p>"I am free but I shall serve you in those ways you require
and the Honeycomb will taste sweeter coming from my hand"</p>

<p>The words were at once ancient and timely</p>

<p>"I pledge to you that yours will be the name I cry out in the night
Yours will be the eyes into which I smile each morning.
I pledge to you the first bite of my meat, and the first drink from my
cup.
I pledge to you my living and my dying each equally in your care.
I shall be the shield at your back and you at mine.
I shall not slander you nor you me.
I shall honor you above all others and when we quarrel we shall do so in
private, and tell no strangers our grievances.</p>

<p>This is my joining vow to you.</p>

<p>This is a joining of equals.</p>

<p>A joining of sisters."</p>

<p>The old priest looked at the two young women and quietly scanned them
with a knowing eye and judged that these two women were entering this
union seriously and with their eyes open, free of illusions. </p>

<p>He then looked at the three rather imposing figures standing behind them
and with a nod from Lugh he began the blessing. But this was one he'd
never done before. </p>

<p>This binding was far more than any he'd ever done before, the power
present at this ceremony was at a frighteningly high level, giving him
pause at what the two young women had insisted upon. </p>

<p>However he remembered that this was no ordinary joining and felt
compelled to carry out their wishes. </p>

<p>He cleared and in a voice that belied his age intoned the words that had
been given him.

"These promises you make,
By the Sun and the Moon
By Fire and Water
By Day and Night
By Land and Sea

With these vows you swear by the God and Goddess
To be full partners each to the other
If one drops the load the other will pick it up
If one is discredited the other her honor
will be forfeit, generation upon generation until she repair that which
is damaged
and finds that which was lost </p>

<p>He stopped long enough for his words to sink in, then
continued. </p>

<p>"Should you fail to keep the oaths you pledge,
The Elements themselves will reach out and destroy, erasing all evidence
of your existence." </p>

<p>As the old man recited his final words a swirling vortex of neon green
and pure white light rose from the ground at Buffy and Willows feet and
grew until it surrounded the five figures at the front of the alter. </p>

<p>The spinning lights rose into the night sky the colors swirling and
mixing intensifying growing stronger and brighter with each word spoken
until it covered the sky over the clearing blocking out the moon and
stars. </p>

<p>The light became so bright people were forced to shield their eyes and
were unable to look directly at the couple and their sponsors. </p>

<p>Then as the light reached it's peak, Brigit reached up and quickly
pulled the dagger out from between their tightly bound hands. </p>

<p>Blood flowed freely from the bone deep cuts across the palms of the
Slayer and her Sorceress, mixing and running onto the ground at their
feet. </p>

<p>As the blood flowed their voices rose in unison loud enough for all to
hear.</p>

<p>"With this we are joined<br>
Body to body<br>
Mind to mind<br>
Blood to blood<br>
Two halves of the some soul<br>
Now and for eternity<br>
Friends, lovers, soulmates, Sisters" </p>

<p>With a blinding flash the light disappeared. </p>

<p>As if to signal the end of the ceremony all four wolves got up and
howled eerily then turned and trotted into the trees, disappearing into
the quickly dissipating fog. </p>

<p>Morrigan and Brigit gave the girls goodbye hugs and stepped back
allowing Lugh room to step up to the newly joined couple and lay his
hands on their shoulders. </p>

<p>The three looked into each others eyes theirs shining with unshed tears
of pure joy, his with pride in these two brave young ones entering into
a war that had begun before time and would continue on long after they
were gone, facing it unflinchingly, head-on with full knowledge of the
consequences of their choice even when other so called great warriors
would cower in fear. </p>

<p>"Be well young ones." Lugh said, his voice thick with unaccustomed
emotions. "We will be together again, if not in this life than the
next." </p>

<p>With that he joined the two women and opened the portal. </p>

<p>"Do we leave them like this." Brigit asked not happy with leaving her
one time student and her Slayer to their own devices </p>

<p>"Worry not dear one." Lugh reassured "We have yet to meet their wizard.
He has yet to reveal himself." </p>

<p>That said the two women followed him through the portal that vanished as
soon as they were through it. </p>

<p>The attendants hurriedly went to the couple and untied the ribbon that
held their hands together so they could bandage the wounds from the
dagger. </p>

<p>To their amazement when the women examined the couples palms and washed
off the remaining blood, there were no open cuts, only matching scars
that crossed their palms, obliterating their lifelines. </p>

<p>After discussing it with the old high priest, Buffy and Willow along
with the four coven members that had seen and heard everything, decided
that it would be best not to discuss the unusual occurrences the had
happened that night. </p>

<p>The old priest made both of them promise that after everything settled
down the three of them would sit down and have a long talk about their
sponsors. </p>

<p>That problem dealt with, the party followed their guests to another area
where there was a large banquet hall that had once been the mess hall
for the camp site and began the festivities that traditionally went with
a proper joining ceremony. </p>

<p>At Buffy's suggestion, she and Willow acquired the keys to one of the
cabins and claimed fatigue after back to back parties.
After suffering the inescapable snide remarks and lame sexually
suggestive jokes at their expense the two lovers slipped away from their
celebrating friends, old and new, and hurried through the primeval woods
to one of the well equipped cabins. </p>

<p>They stopped on the front porch and Buffy followed Willow's gaze up into
the night sky and the slowly setting moon. </p>

<p>"What's up Wills?" Buffy asked nuzzling her partner's neck, knowing full
well the effect it had on her passionate lover. "Don't cha wanna go
inside and get re-acquainted, babe." </p>

<p>Kissing her way up the red head's neck until she reached the ear, she
took the sensitive lobe between her teeth nipping it lightly causing the
already aroused witch to moan loudly. </p>

<p>"Still wanna star gaze, witchy-poo." the blonde seductress purred into
her lover's shell like ear. "You know there's a really nice hot tub in
there just waiting for us to finish communing with nature and start
honeymooning." </p>

<p>With a sexually charged growl Willow spun around in Buffy's arms and
claimed the Slayers lips with her own. </p>

<p>Buffy ran her tongue over her lover's lips, demanding entrance that was
gladly given. Tongues swirled around each other exploring their lover's
sweet mouths. </p>

<p>Buffy coaxed Willow's tongue into her mouth and sucked on the squirming
flesh as she held it in place with her teeth forcing a whimper of
surrender from the red haired witch. </p>

<p>Lifting her lover Buffy carried her partner into the cabin and kicked
the door shut behind them. </p>

<p>Shadows of clothing flew across the window shades. Squeals and giggles
of delight soon were overcome by moans.
Growls and screams of undiluted animal pleasure filled the air around
the cabin, it's occupants safe and secure guarded by state of the art
security systems and by ancient and powerful magiks that held back the
terrors of the night. </p>

<p>A pair of malevolently glowing eyes watched the cabin, listening to the
hateful sounds of the two women that the owner of the eyes despised more
than anything else in the universe and felt actual jolts of pain because
of their pleasure. </p>

<p>It had tried earlier to enter the grounds but was driven back by the
area's sacred status. That too heightened his rage over the very
existence of the two women. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Just wait, you whores of the light.&lt;&gt; it thought, it's mind seething
with it's insane rage. &lt;&gt;You are alive because that bastard Kresis
interfered with the mistress. It won't happen next time.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME! </p>
