<p>It wasn't the toughest slayage Buffy had ever faced, but it was tough
enough that she was getting to vent some of her pent up hostility and
anger. </p>

<p>Every kick, every punch carried with it a little piece of the insults
and harassment she'd been forced to put up with over the last few
months. Every time someone had said some hurtful remark toward her and
her Willow that she couldn't retaliate against was stored in her and
every chance she got she released the beast within her. </p>

<p>The Slayer used all stored up negative energy to add strength to her
fighting abilities. This was something Merrick had taught her and she
was grateful to him for it, among all the other lessons he given her. </p>

<p>When the first vampire attacked, she could feel his bones breaking under
each punch and kick. Buffy even ignored early opportunities to stake him
in order to prolong the fight itself. </p>

<p>Though she knew the Scoobies (especially Willow) wouldn't approve of her
enjoying slaying, but deep down Buffy felt her little "inner slayer"
jumping up and down for joy, cheering her on. Buffy was concentrating on
beating the vamp she was currently facing to a bloody pulp, and was
probably too focused on it too much. </p>

<p>It felt good, with every punch every kick Buffy could feel the
adrenaline coursing through her veins. It was like some drug sending her
to new heights of pleasure. It was times like these that Buffy
understood Faith, it was almost better than sex, almost. </p>

<p>She'd beaten the vampire back to where he was almost trapped against a
large garish tombstone when she heard Willow's warning and caught
movement out of the corner of her eye. </p>

<p>The Slayer ducked just in time as the vampire sneaking up behind her
swung a punch at the back of her head. The fist cut through empty air
where Buffy's head had been, missing her completely. </p>

<p>From her crouch the Slayer launched a vicious side kick that connected
with the second vampire's chest and knocked him backwards about four
yards into the air, only stopping when his body collided with a waist
high tombstone. </p>

<p>Pulling a second stake from behind her belt Buffy threw it at the second
vamp.
Thanks to her slayer abilities the stake hit him in the center of his
chest, sinking all the way through his cold undead heart. </p>

<p>Before that one turned into a cloud of dust Buffy turned to face her
first adversary, only to find that he'd used the opportunity to duck
around the tombstone and was running toward a low rise. </p>

<p>From experience the Slayer knew that on the other side of the rise was a
small bowl shaped valley just perfect for an ambush.
With that in mind she took off after him knowing full well that she was
more than likely running head-long into an ambush.
In her excitement the third vampire and Willow slipped her mind
momentarily, recalling that she wasn't alone but with full confidence
that her friend could handle a single vampire. </p>

<p>"I'm going on after this one, Wills." the Slayer shouted over her
shoulder as she took off in pursuit of the escaping vampire. "I think
this is it." As an after thought she added "Come on when you're done.
I'll hold them off till you get there." </p>

<p>Buffy continued running, grinning at her own arrogant over-confidence
and knowing she'd hear about it later from her lover. </p>

<p>Buffy went on ahead over the rise and down into the bowl shaped valley
of tombstones and an old granite and marble mausoleum that was crumbling
slightly with age. </p>

<p>She came to a sliding stop toward the center of the valley as she found
herself suddenly surrounded by ten or fifteen very large vampires. All
of which looked to be highly capable veterans, not at all like the
inexperienced newbies she and Willow normally faced. </p>

<p>With a hard loud gulp Buffy began to realize that she could be in
serious trouble. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Oh shit.&lt;&gt; she thought, cursing herself for not waiting for Willow.
&lt;&gt;This is definitely not the smartest thing I've ever done. I hope
Giles' plan works, cause if doesn't my sweet little Slayer butt is dead,
or worse.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy began to really worry when she realized that she was no longer
linked to Willow. In fact now that she thought about it she hadn't been
since the fighting started. </p>

<p>Looking around Buffy realized she was totally alone and Willow was
nowhere in sight, and without the link Buffy felt more alone than she'd
ever felt before. </p>

<p>Something else was beginning to bother the Slayer, although the vamps
had her out numbered and surrounded none of them had made a move of any
kind. </p>

<p>They just stood there in a circle, eerily quiet as if they were just
holding her there for someone else. They hadn't even slipped into
game-face. It was obvious that this was a well organized and disciplined
force, not the usual collection of self-serving individuals she was used
to. </p>

<p>Deep in her heart Buffy felt fear and doubt for the first time in a long
time. She wasn't sure that she and her friends would be enough to stop
this new and different threat. </p>

<p>Summoning up what courage she could the Slayer took a deep breath and
addressed the group. </p>

<p>"Uh...hey guys." Buffy said, trying to hide her nervousness behind
bravado. "What's up? Who's hosting this little shindig?" </p>

<p>As if in answer to her question the vampires in front of Buffy stepped
aside to form an isle that was soon filled by a bizarrely beautiful
woman, being closely followed by a big muscular man of obviously latin
extraction and flanked by two huge hulking red skinned demons. </p>

<p>As the group drew closer she could see that the woman, while beautiful,
had some noticeable differences that marked her as not quite human, most
notable were her glowing red eyes that captured and held the Slayer's
vision. </p>

<p>"Greetings Slayer." the woman said, her deep rasping voice sending
tingles along Buffy's nerves straight to her core. "I'm so glad you
could join us. We were waiting for you but it seems you have misplaced
your little witch-kit.
I do hope she hasn't gotten herself into more trouble than she can
handle, and that she too will join us soon." </p>

<p>The woman laughed lightly filling the air between them with the musical
sound. Buffy found she was unable to speak and found the woman's deep
throaty rasping voice strangely compelling. </p>

<p>It was as if a curtain had fallen over her mind that kept Buffy from
thinking of anything except her attraction for this woman. She found
herself drawn to the exotic beauty to the exclusion of everything else. </p>

<p>All thoughts of Giles, Xander, Cordelia, the Abbot, even her soulmate
Willow were wiped from her conscious mind, and her entire being was
centered on the vision of darkly inhuman beauty that was facing her. </p>

<p>"I am the Countess Hela." the woman announced. "And you, my sweet
Slayer, belong to me, as does your beloved little witch-kit. I have
decided it is time to collect my property." </p>

<p>Buffy tried to fight against the pull of the voice, but it seemed to
penetrate deep into her psyche crowding all other thoughts and impulses
back into the dark recesses of her mind. </p>

<p>This was the voice of her dreams, the voice that held the promise of
salvation, the voice that gave forgiveness. It could not be ignored it
would not be denied. Buffy's deepest, most primal self answered it's
siren's call. </p>

<p>"Come to me my Slayer." Hela commanded, softly and gently. "Come to your
mistress and surrender your will to me, submit to my dominance obey my
commands. Come to me." </p>

<p>Buffy tried to fight the compulsion to follow the Countess' orders, A
chill ran up her spine. Fear, revulsion and anger joined submission and
lust in the Slayer's mind in a confusing vortex of emotions. </p>

<p>She was unable to resist Hela's commands. She took a tentative step
toward the Countess and her small entourage. Buffy tried with all her
strength to fight the compulsion, but it was too strong, too deep. It
was as if her legs were following Hela's orders of their own accord. </p>

<p>"Come along my child." Hela coaxed, like she was encouraging a toddler
to walk for the first time. "Come to your mistress come on, that's a
good girl." </p>

<p>A shiver of both revulsion and joy swept through Buffy's body at Hela's
words of praise. Buffy closed her eyes and clenched her fists in a
futile attempt to escape the fiendishly subtle female's spell, but her
body was no longer hers to command and it continued to follow Hela's
instructions. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Oh Gods Wills!&lt;&gt; Buffy's mind cried out in desperation. &lt;&gt;Please come
save me my love or I'm lost forever.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy walked stiffly like some giant puppet, answering the woman's
beckoning call. As she reached the woman, the two demons stepped up and
seized the slayer's arms. </p>

<p>At a signal from the Countess they turned their captive around to face
the direction from which she'd come. The vampires formed battle lines
between the Slayer and the far side of the bowl shaped valley.
Buffy felt the woman come up behind her. Hate anger and fear joined
disgust and nausea as Hela's inhumanly large hands began roaming Buffy's
body, over her clothes. </p>

<p>She closed her eyes tightly as she felt an unnaturally long tongue sweep
over her ear and neck as the woman's abnormally hot breath washed over
her sensitive flesh. </p>

<p>The Slayer was close to the end of her strength. She could feel her
knees threatening to give out and a blackness began closing in on her
mind to save her sanity that was hanging by a slender thread. </p>

<p>But the blackness quickly dissipated when the voice of hope and strength
and most of all love reached her from across the valley.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow left Angel standing flat footed in stunned silence as she took
off running at top speed following the path over the rise that Buffy had
taken. </p>

<p>She went over the rise and down into the valley coming to a sudden halt
facing the battle line of snarling vampires. While the line of game
faced vamps was enough to stop her, what really captured Willow's
attention was the sight of her chosen mate, best friend, and lover being
held by two gigantic red skinned demons while being groped by what
appeared to be a female of one of the higher demon races. </p>

<p>She could feel Buffy's disgust and rage at being so intimately assaulted
by the female. The situation was made worse by the big muscular latino
man that was watching the Slayer's humiliation and giggling insanely. </p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow called out to her lover. "Buffy, look at me." </p>

<p>Buffy's eyes flew wide open and almost instantly locked on her mate's
glowing green eyes. </p>

<p>"Look at me my Slayer, my love." Willow's voice carried soft calm and
clear across the distance separating the soulmates. "Open your mind to
me my darling. Link with my thoughts. Feel my love for you. Let my power
fill you. Let it enter your soul.
These others are of no consequence to us. They have no hold on us. Our
love is beyond anything they have. Feel the power of our love free you
from their grasp." </p>

<p>Buffy's eyes grew wide as she listened to Willow's reassuring voice, and
her very core was filling with the power her beloved witch was sending
her. </p>

<p>The powers forced the hold the Countess had on the Slayer's mind to
slip. Hela fell back a few steps in surprise and sudden fear when she
felt the overwhelming power of the Slayer's witch-kit. </p>

<p>In a blast of intense neon green fire the two demons holding the Slayer
disappeared, the powerful fire consuming them, completely freeing the
Slayer. </p>

<p>As if that was the prearranged signal several of the vampires exploded
into clouds of dust as Giles and the rest of their back up came over the
rise, firing their crossbows with deadly accuracy while Angel attacked
from the flank throwing the vampire troops into confusion. </p>

<p>Seeing her opportunity to capture the two young women she'd wanted so
badly slip away, Hela decided to cut her losses and put an end to them
once and for all. </p>

<p>"Destroy them!" Hela shouted to her troops with an angry hiss, then she
turned to her pet and spoke in a lower voice. "Kill the witch Max, we
can't have her so no one will, kill her." </p>

<p>"Yes mistress." the psychotic man answered. "I will gladly do as you
wish." </p>

<p>Max stealthily slipped into the shadows and began circling around the
fighting, to find a good position from which to kill the offending red
head that had ruined his mistress plans. </p>

<p>At the Countess' orders the Vampires split into groups. Two of them
attacked the Slayer and the witch. </p>

<p>The few remaining vamps tried to get at the reinforcements, to stop the
deadly rain of wooden crossbow bolts that took a devastating toll on
their ranks with each volley. Soon the sounds of close hand to hand
combat could be heard all over the depression. </p>

<p>The two young women were too busy fighting for their lives to pay
attention to where everybody was, but they were overjoyed that their
friends were fighting at their side. </p>

<p>The fight lasted for over half an hour. Being veteran fighters, the
vampires were harder to dust, but finally nearly all the Countess'
troops were dust bunnies. The last two fell back to guard Hela. </p>

<p>As Buffy and Willow were about to attack, a commanding voice rang out
across the battle field. </p>

<p>"Hela!" the voice announced. "By order of the high council of Tarsus, I
have come to return you to them to stand trail for treason and other
high crimes." </p>

<p>"HA! Kresis!" Hela scoffed back at him. "You don't have the power or
authority to do anything to me." </p>

<p>"Once he learned of your plans the Master of Tarsus himself broke the
curse barring me from this place." gloated Kresis. "Thus giving me all
the power I need." </p>

<p>With a wave of her hand Hela sent a bolt of reddish-yellow energy at the
Count and his two vampire body guards. At almost the same instant Kresis
launched his own arc of blue and black energy at her. </p>

<p>The two bolts struck simultaneously, knocking both high demons back
several feet and utterly destroying the vamp body guards of both. They
both rose shakily and faced each other. </p>

<p>Both were wounded, but neither would give in and admit defeat. </p>

<p>Suddenly the tense silence was broken as shots rang out. Everyone turned
and looked at Xander standing there holding a smoking 9mm automatic in
his hand. </p>

<p>Taking advantage of everyone watching the confrontation between Kresis
and Hela, Max had silently approached his intended victim. Finally
getting within striking distance Max slipped out of the shadows and held
his favorite knife ready to strike out at the witch his mistress wanted
dead. </p>

<p>Xander saw the man come out of the shadows and move toward Willow with a
big hunting knife. Deducing his purpose and knowing there was no way he
could reach the man before he could hurt Willow, Xander acted the only
way he knew how, he drew the 9mm and aiming carefully Xander emptied the
magazine into the man. </p>

<p>The group looked over at the man's lifeless body laying in the short
cemetery grass. Willow looked over to Xander, worried about her lifelong
friend. She looked into his eyes and saw them filled with a mix of
happiness at saving his friend's life and sorrow for having taken
another human's life. </p>

<p>"I told you I was watching your back." Xander explained. "He was going
to kill Will and I couldn't let that happen." </p>

<p>Willow went to her friend and placed a hand on his arm to comfort him. </p>

<p>"I know Xander." the witch said sympathetically. "You didn't have a
choice." </p>

<p>Buffy ran across the depression and grabbed the young man in a crushing
bear hug that lifted him off the ground. There was no mistaking her
feelings. </p>

<p>"Thank you Xander." the Slayer said softly, releasing him then planting
a big kiss on his cheek, her joy and gratitude clear in her eyes and
voice. "I'll never be able to tell you how much that means to me." </p>

<p>She would have said more but was interrupted by a hissing scream from
across the clearing. </p>

<p>"You bitch, you killed Max!" Hela screamed in rage as she turned and ran
into the shadows before anyone could do anything to stop her escape.
"You have not heard the last of this Slayer. I will be back for you too
witch-kit." </p>

<p>The Slayer and her witch companion looked at each other and sighed, each
one knowing that the Countess meant every word. </p>

</table>

<p>Hela's threats still echoed through the air after she vanished into the
shadows. The group looked after the fleeing demoness trying to catch a
glimpse of the direction that she was headed, when a groan and a thud
reminded them of the other humanoid demon, the one she'd called Kresis. </p>

<p>Seeing that the seemingly civilized creature was in some distress, Giles
and one of the brothers started to go to the wounded being's aid when he
was suddenly facing several well armed "men".
The "men" were all dressed in a collection of various military combat
uniforms and were well armed with modern assault weapons. By their
dress, demeanor, and the way they handled their equipment, it was
obvious that each was highly proficient in the use of their weapons.
They formed a battle square and held the group back from the fallen
demon. </p>

<p>A tall lean battle scared soldier wearing a black patch over one eye
stepped forward and knelt next to the fallen demon and began caring for
his wounds expertly. He looked up at the ex-Watcher and gave him a weary
smile that didn't quite reach his golden eye with its snakelike pupil. </p>

<p>"We aren't here for you or yours Watcher." the kneeling mercenary told
Giles. "We are here to aid my lord the Count. Let my men and I do that
and none of you will be harmed." </p>

<p>It was not a threat. It was a statement of fact. Giles backed away and
the man went back to his task. </p>

<p>"Caladin, is that you old friend?" the wounded Count groaned in pain.
"It is good to see you." </p>

<p>"I am here, my lord." Caladin said, reassuring the wounded demon. "Let
me care for your injuries. Just lay back and rest my Lord." </p>

<p>Following the advice of his friend and loyal retainer, Kresis lay down
and closed his eyes. Although the Count was badly wounded he would
survive thanks to Caladin's knowledge of combat medicine. </p>

<p>The mercenary was relieved that his old friend would recover, cursing
the delay that had slowed his arrival. He had waited for the prearranged
signal, but when it didn't come and he heard gunshots, Caladin had
ordered his men to go to the Count and protect him at all cost. </p>

<p>Once they'd made sure of the Count's security, scouts were sent to find
Hela's trail or her body. That done, their leader was able to
concentrate on caring for his liege lord. Finally finishing what he
could in the field, Caladin sat back and took a deep breath in an effort
to relax. </p>

<p>"Is it bad Caladin?" Kresis asked weakly. "How bad did the bitch get to
me?" </p>

<p>"Well you're going to carry some pretty nasty scars my lord, but you
know how the females like that." Caladin said, trying to lighten the
mood before he delivered the worst of the news. "You'll be weak as a new
born kit from blood loss for quite some time, that will delay your
recovery." </p>

<p>Kresis noticed that his friend was stalling for some reason and there
was grave concern in his eyes. </p>

<p>"All right spill it old friend." Kresis croaked his throat dry with pain
and worry . "What is it you are not telling me?" </p>

<p>"Well my lord." Caladin said, licking his thin lips nervously. "The
worst of your wounds is that you have lost your right arm just above the
elbow." </p>

<p>The remaining color drained from the Count's face as the shock of the
news registered. He saw the concern on his friend's face and the worried
looks on the faces of the other men gathered around. Knowing that his
duty was to bolster the men's morale, he took a deep breath and called
up his reserves. </p>

<p>"So the bitch got me hard huh?" Kresis growled. "As long as I have you
and your men I still have a strong right arm. Any idea where she went?" </p>

<p>Seeing the look of pride and admiration on the faces of his mercenaries,
Kresis knew he'd acted and said the right thing.
One of the scouts stepped forward and knelt down next to his commander
and the badly wounded Count. </p>

<p>"We found a blood trail, from the color we knew it had to be hers." the
scout reported. "We followed it to a sewer entrance where it
disappeared." </p>

<p>"Good job." the Count commended the scout, who rose smiling and rejoined
the ranks. "Do you have a plan of action Caladin?" </p>

<p>"Once we have gotten you to a safe haven to heal, I will send out S&D
teams to find the Countess Hela." Caladin said her name like a curse.
"We will get the bitch this time my lord. I swear it!" </p>

<p>Four men stepped up carrying a stretchier and, with extreme caution,
laid the Count on it. Surrounded by the loyal band of mercenaries the
count was taken away. Caladin and two of his men stayed behind and
approached Giles. </p>

<p> "We mean you no harm Watcher." Caladin said matter of factly.
"However I would advise you and yours to stay out of our way when we go
after Countess Hela. Count Kresis is not only our liege. He is also our
most trusted friend, and wounding him is the last insult or injury I and
my men will tolerate from her.
In short it is a personal vendetta. I wouldn't want to see any of your
people damaged. After all, I understand there is to be a special
occasion soon. We wouldn't want to put a damper on that would we?" </p>

<p>Giles understood the thinly veiled message the cold blooded mercenary
was sending him. The Countless was theirs and they would tolerate no
interference. </p>

<p>"Yes I suppose you are right." Giles answered, secretly glad for the
truce. </p>

<p>Having heard of Caladin and his company of vicious mercenaries, he knew
they were capable of carrying out any threat. </p>

<p>"We have no problem with you or your people, and as long as the Countess
leaves us alone there is no reason for any of us to go after her." </p>

<p>"That's good enough." Caladin said humorlessly. "Please convey the
Count's and my congratulations to the Slayer and the Sorceress." </p>

<p>"Ah...yes right thank you." the ex-Watcher stammered, taken back by the
legendary mercenary's words. "And please convey our best wishes for a
complete and speedy recovery to the Count." </p>

<p>Caladin bowed slightly in a show of respect, then giving a signal to his
men, the three disappeared into the shadows. </p>

<p>Thinking of the mercenary's thinly veiled threat Giles shrugged his
shoulders and turned to head down the rise to where the Slayer and
company were sitting on tombstones in groups of two. </p>

<p>Further on, leaning on the ancient mausoleum was Angel, watching his one
time lover and her new mate and their friends. As he drew near Giles
could clearly see the pain in the souled vampire's eyes. He went to the
dark "man" to express his gratitude. </p>

<p>"Thank you for coming." Giles said quietly, not wishing to cause him any
further suffering. "Your help, as always, was invaluable. I know this
can't be easy for you considering your feelings." </p>

<p>"Yeah well feelings change." the vampire said wistfully and shrugging
his shoulders. "As long as she's happy. It's just too bad I was too damn
pigheaded and stupid to see how happy Willow makes her feel. I don't
know why I was so surprised. I've known how she's felt about Willow ever
since I've known her. I can't believe I was jealous, but I sure was." </p>

<p>Both men looked at the two young women that were sitting on a tombstone
a short distance away, huddled closely together talking. Their love was
as evident as a bright light on a cloudy night. </p>

<p>Feeling the eyes on them, both looked over at Giles and Angel, smiled at
them, then turned back to their intense conversation. Then as the men
watched Buffy and Willow got up and, with Buffy in the lead, walked over
to the two older men. </p>

<p>They stopped talking and watched the two girls approach, Angel couldn't
help noticing they were holding hands. </p>

<p>All four estranged friends stood awkwardly silent. Buffy and Angel
couldn't look each other in the eyes, both embarrassed by their past
behavior. </p>

<p>"Uh...hi Angel." Buffy stammered unsure of how to begin. "How are things
in L.A.?" </p>

<p>"Yeah...ah..hi." Angel said, scuffing the toe of his boot in the dirt
like a kid in trouble. "Everything's okay I guess, never boring anyway." </p>

<p>"Look Angel..." </p>

<p>"Buffy, I..."
They started simultaneously, then were quiet each waiting on the other
one to start first. </p>

<p>"Oh geeze, you two!" Willow huffed, aggravated by her two friends. "Okay
age before beauty, Angel you first... come on speak up, you ancient
idiot!" </p>

<p>The over 200 year old vampire looked at the slender, normally shy red
head, slack jawed at her temerity. He had to chuckle at her now innocent
and shy smile as she batted her eyes at him. </p>

<p>"Alright, I'll start." he said giving in. "Turn off the girlish charms
witch." </p>

<p>He looked over at Buffy and a crooked smile crossed over his lips. </p>

<p>"Getting bossy, isn't she." he said to the Slayer. </p>

<p>"You don't know the half of it." Buffy answered rolling her eyes joining
in to tease her lover. </p>

<p>"Well I suppose I'd better speak up before she attacks again." Angel
said. </p>

<p>"That might be wise." his ex girlfriend agreed. </p>

<p>"Enough for Goddess sake!" Willow exclaimed, and stomping her foot
glaring at the two miscreants, crossed her arms over her chest. "Will
you please get on with it before I do something really...really... oh
really mean!" </p>

<p>They both laughed at her, throwing their hands up in surrender. </p>

<p>"You win Willow." Angel said with a wry laugh. "Wouldn't want you to be
forced to give us a good talking to." </p>

<p>Angel gave the red head a look of amused disbelief knowing that even her
threat of doing something "mean" wouldn't be followed up on. He'd known
all along that the little witch, that had captured Buffy's heart, was
incapable of harming him or anyone else that wasn't a threat to Buffy's
or her survival. </p>

<p>He looked over to Buffy and his smile turned sad as he saw the strain
his being there caused the young Slayer and he knew an explanation was
in order, that plus an apology. </p>

<p>"Seriously Buffy and you too Willow," Angel said softly, his dark
brooding eyes focusing on both girls. "I said some really stupid things
and what's worse, it was at a time when you needed all your friends to
support you.
I'm truely sorry and, if it's possible, I would feel honored if you
could get past my bout of rampant idiocy and feel free to consider me a
friend you can call on at any time." </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other and smiled knowingly. </p>

<p>"I think we've all had our minor bout of stupidly childish behavior and
I for one am glad it's finally over, almost." Willow spouted off, then
with a warning look at her soulmate said. "Now I think it's time for a
certain Slayer to eat a little humble pie and swallow hard." </p>

<p>Buffy tried to get by giving them her best "who me?" face, but gave it
up at the first sight of her lover's resolve face knowing she could
never refuse Willow anything once she gave her the resolve face. She
cleared her throat loudly and began sheepishly. </p>

<p>"I'm really sorry I overreacted so badly. I should have just let it go
and trusted that you would come around sooner or later, instead of being
so quick to be angry with you.
Then I made it worse by refusing to accept your sincere apologies. I
acted like a big spoiled baby, instead of being the friend I was
supposed to be." Buffy began slowly, but quickly warmed to the subject.
"What you did for Wills tonight just proves what a true friend you are.
Even when I acted like a petty vindictive bitch. I'm just glad I got a
chance to thank you for saving her. If something happened to her
I...well...I..." </p>

<p>That was all Buffy could say without bursting into tears. When she
remembered how close she'd come to losing her soulmate because she'd
been so focused on Slaying instead of keeping an eye on her lover, like
she was supposed to. </p>

<p>Buffy fell into the old habit of blaming herself for every mistake and
was beating herself up mentally for it. </p>

<p>Willow could feel her mate's dilemma and knew she had to act fast before
the guilt got out of hand again. She reached out and pulled her Slayer
to her and held her tightly letting her lover release those doubts and
fears in the form of tears that soon soaked through Willow's shirt. </p>

<p>Willow kept her beloved Buffy in her tight comforting embrace until the
sobbing subsided. </p>

<p>Seeing that the split between Angel and his two charges was finally
mended, for now at least, as well as it could be in one night. Only time
could do the rest. </p>

<p>Looking at his watch Giles announced that it was time for everyone to go
home. While there was some talk of going to Giles house, to "let off
some steam" as Xander put it, but the ex Watcher put a stop to that by
insisting that everyone go home to rest up for the wedding the next
afternoon. </p>

<p>Finally agreeing, the group split up. The Abbot and his men had already
gone to stay at the home of Dr. (brother) Fallon, </p>

<p>Xander and Cordelia went to their newly rented apartment and Angel went
to his old haunts, hoping that no one or no thing had taken over the
mansion. </p>

<p>Buffy, Willow, and Giles headed home to their complex, but before the
girls could go to their own townhouse Giles asked them to join him at
his place for a few minutes. </p>

<p>Willow had noticed that the Slayer had seemed to be on a slow burn since
they left the cemetery and she wasn't sure why. She knew it wasn't aimed
at her. </p>

<p>From the dark glances she'd been giving Giles she figured that he was
definitely the object of Buffy's ire. Willow wasn't able to tell why,
because Buffy was so angry that the witch couldn't reach her thoughts. </p>

<p>The only thing Willow knew for sure was that there was a major Slayer
type explosion coming and their mentor was dead center in the cross
hairs. Even Willow was a little scared. She'd never seen her lover this
mad at anyone on their side. </p>

<p>Buffy entered the ex Watcher's living room and threw herself down on the
couch in a huff. Trembling slightly from the anger radiating from her
lover, Willow sat down next to Buffy and waited for the fireworks. She
didn't have long to wait. </p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 19</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Slayer sat on Giles' couch. Her impatience would have been obvious
even to someone that didn't know her. </p>

<p>To Willow the anger and frustration that radiated from her lover was an
almost living thing gnawing at her. The anxious witch had to scoot away
from her beloved Buffy to escape the painfully intense emotions that
flowed into Willow's mind, despite her attempts to block them out. </p>

<p>The two girls waited for Giles to come back from the kitchen both
wishing he would hurry but for far different reasons.
As if on cue, Buffy's mentor and ex Watcher entered the room carrying
three large mugs of herbal tea. </p>

<p>After setting a mug in front of each girl the man retreated to his
favorite overstuffed easy chair. Willow took a sip of her tea and closed
her eyes savoring the comforting feeling the warmth and flavor provided
her over tired body. </p>

<p>"Mmm...This is really good, Giles." Willow tried to lighten the tension
with small talk. "You've been experimenting again haven't you. I can
taste the chamomile and peppermint but there's something else. I just
can't make it out. Alright I give up what's in there?" </p>

<p>"Well your right about the first two." Giles said, smiling at the girl
knowing what she was trying to do. "There is also ginseng and echinacea.
According the herbalist you told me about, it's supposed to help relax
while restoring energy and stamina. Do you like it?" </p>

<p>"It's excellent." Willow answered "Did you like Cheryl? I met her
through some Wyccans I met on the net. She seems to kn..." </p>

<p>"Enough babble!" Buffy roared unable to contain her anger any longer. </p>

<p>Willow flinched like she'd been struck. Seeing that made the Slayer even
angrier. She launched herself off the couch. Unable to contain the
nervous energy that accompanied her rage, Buffy began pacing. Giles
watched her calmly, infuriating her even further. </p>

<p>The ex-Watcher decided it was time to let his Slayer vent some of her
anger. </p>

<p>"Judging by your outburst Buffy, you have some questions about tonight."
Giles said in the calm parent to petulant child voice that he knew
irritated the raging blonde even more. "If you would like...." </p>

<p>"You're damn right I've got some questions." Buffy growled
sarcastically, interrupting Giles, her patience gone. "Like where the
hell were you while that demon bitch was feeling me up and the woman I
love was nearly killed?" </p>

<p>Giles started to answer but the Slayer stopped him abruptly. </p>

<p>"NO! Giles let me finish!" She said quietly, the barely controlled
menace clear in her trembling voice. "It's bad enough you call in these
people we don't even know and expect us to work with them and trust them
with the pressure that Wills and I are under after the last few weeks.
Then you leave us out there to be humiliated and nearly killed." </p>

<p>Buffy didn't feel it but tears of rage and humiliation were flowing down
her face. She blamed Giles for her capture and the delay in freeing her
and, even worse, she blamed herself for Willow being nearly killed or
worse. </p>

<p>To be honest, the fact that her lover had to be rescued by Angel, her
ex-lover, especially after she'd treated him so badly, really hurt. </p>

<p>Although it could be argued that Buffy knew that her lover was capable
of handling a single vampire. It was also true that she had no idea
there was another vamp hiding in the shadows. </p>

<p>She also knew she should have stayed with Willow until she'd finished
off her opponent, then they both could have gone after the escaping
vamp. That was the first rule of slaying, never leave a companion alone,
always stay together. </p>

<p>But she'd broken her own rule and left the most important person in the
universe alone and vulnerable. She'd come close to realizing her worst
nightmare, losing the one thing more important to her life than
breathing. </p>

<p>Willow was almost killed and it was her fault. That thought was eating
at the back of her mind fuelling her anger. </p>

<p>As Buffy ranted and paced both Willow and Giles watched her intently,
never taking their eyes off the Slayer. But when the accusations and
incriminations became more personally aimed at Giles himself, Willow
watched the man out of the corner of her eye. She saw the pain in his
eyes and how his body jerked with every accusation Buffy sent his way. </p>

<p>Seeing his anguish, and knowing that Buffy was just striking out at him
because he was there, Willow decided that it was time for her lover's
tantrum to end. </p>

<p>As Buffy approached the couch on her next tour around the room, the red
haired witch reached out and gently took the Slayer's wrist, causing
Buffy to stop in mid-sentence and look into the eyes that held her heart
and soul. </p>

<p>"Buffy, honey stop." Willow softly pleaded with her lover. "Let Giles
explain, I'm sure he can. Sit here with me sweetheart, please." </p>

<p>Buffy looked over at Giles and saw the hurt written for her to see
clearly in his eyes and felt badly for having caused it. Looking back
into the eyes of her beloved, and seeing the request for peace in her
gaze, the mighty Slayer knew she was lost. </p>

<p>She sat down on the couch feeling guilty for losing control. Willow
scooted over next to her Slayer and gently took her lover in her arms.
The witch could feel the tension leaving Buffy's muscles as her touch
relieved the Slayer's rage and guilt. </p>

<p>"This had better be good." Buffy growled, letting them know she was
still not a happy camper. </p>

<p>"Thank you, my love." Willow whispered, then nibbled lightly on her
Slayer's sensitive ear lobe bringing a soft groan from deep in Buffy's
soul. </p>

<p>"You don't play fair Wills." the defeated blonde moaned pulling her
lover closer. </p>

<p>"You love it though." whispered the red head. She placed a soft kiss on
Buffy's lips and placing a hand high on the muscular thigh of her
"victim", gave it a firm squeeze. "Don't cha?" </p>

<p>"Abso-frickin-lutely." the Slayer whispered breathlessly as her heat
rose. </p>

<p>Before they could go any further Giles cleared his throat loudly,
reminding the young lovers of his presence. </p>

<p>Embarrassed for getting carried away the girls separated and turned
toward the ex-Watcher giving him their undivided attention. He wasn't
completely sure he really wanted it. </p>

<p>"Alright Giles." Willow stated calmly. "I think we're ready to hear your
explanations now." </p>

<p>The ex-Watcher shifted in his chair suddenly uncomfortable under the
intense gaze of his Slayer's lover. He'd practically raised both these
girls since meeting them as sophmores in high school, watching them grow
and mature into their roles as Slayer and Sorceress. </p>

<p>Now under their combined scrutiny he was in awe of the raw power he
could feel radiating from them. It felt like electric shocks directly to
his brain effecting him on many different levels. </p>

<p>Taking a big gulp of his tea, Giles swallowed hard then gathered his
thoughts and his courage and locking eyes with the girls he began hoping
they would understand his motivations. </p>

<p>"I suppose the best place to start would be to explain the unexpected
extra help that showed up here tonight." Giles began, while making a
mental check list of things that needed to be covered during this
session. "As far as the Abbot and his brothers are concerned, they
contacted me through Jeffrey Fallon and requested to see you both. It
was implied that they had knowledge of a vital nature to share with you,
as it turned out they did.
I thought since we were facing a powerful and unknown force I simply
believed we could cover two things at once.
First, you know how the church can be, and by meeting with it's
appointed representatives we headed off several potentially serious
problems.
Second, by repairing the ancient rift between the Sisters of the Soul
and the church, we would gain a powerful ally and resource that was
completely independent from the Watchers Council, and it would be ours
alone.
I realized that when they expressed their desire that the council not be
informed of their involvement. Add to that their specialized knowledge
and the church's larger source of occult information, not only past but
present as well, gives us more than even the council can give." </p>

<p>The ex-Watcher paused his narrative for a few moments to try to gauge
the two girls' reactions. By the look on Buffy's face he knew he had her
with the idea of further separation from the much despised Watchers
Council. </p>

<p>Giles felt a little guilty for playing on the Slayer's hatred of the
treacherous Council, but he knew it would work and he needed her on
board quickly so he could get to the hard part, convincing Willow. </p>

<p>The red haired witch had not only had dealings with certain religious
fanatics but, because of her Wyccan heritage, she already had a deep
distrust of the church and it's representatives. Giles was worried that
this would cloud Willow's view of the offer of assistance but, after
speaking with the Abbot and seeing the man was sincere in his beliefs
and his offer was genuine. </p>

<p>They came to a shaky truce that gave them more crossbows with fairly
adequate marksmen behind them. The fact that the Abbot had brought
several rare and priceless artifacts of the Sisters of the Soul sect to
give to Buffy and Willow. </p>

<p>Also the performing of a heretofore unknown betrothal ritual by the
Abbot himself had gone a long way toward gaining the hard won trust of
the young Sorceress and her companion. They had even acted pleased that,
when the Abbot and his companions left in the morning, their semi-friend
Jeffrey Fallon would be staying on as a kind of Slayer paramedic and
liaison between the Scoobies and the Abbot's order. </p>

<p>"Okay, I guess that springing the church guys on us can be explained."
Buffy began then with a hard edge to her voice. "But you went behind my
back and called Angel, when you knew how I felt about him. What gave you
the right to..." </p>

<p>"Buffy don't." Willow interrupted softly and placed a finger gently on
her love's lips. "Remember what would have happened if not for Angel." </p>

<p>The Slayer turned and looked into the deep green eyes of her universe
and felt the unvoiced emotions swirling just below the surface
threatening to break through. </p>

<p>She and Willow shared the horror and guilt that Buffy felt when she
remembered how close she'd come to losing the love of her life that
night. And then she felt the love, trust, and more than a little lust
that her soulmate had for her at that moment. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;This knowing each other's thoughts could have a real up side.&lt;&gt; Buffy
thought, as a smile spread across her lips when she saw a totally
unbusinesslike vision flash into her lover's mind. &lt;&gt;And it looks like
tonight's gonna be interesting!&lt;&gt;
Both girls eyes took on a smoky sensual tint as they looked deep into
the promise of each other's soul. Then Buffy's eyes turned hard and cold
as she remembered the reason they were there and Willow knew she'd lost
her temporally to the rage in her warrior's heart. </p>

<p>They turned back to Giles and he could see the angry demand for an
explanation in the Slayer's deadly cold eyes. Taking his cue from that
he began before she even had to ask. </p>

<p>"Not telling you was an absolute necessity, Buffy." Giles tried to
explain. "Angel was my wild card. I was the only one that knew he was
there. I could not tell anyone that he would be watching over Willow,
especially not you or Willow."
Giles held up his hand to stop Buffy's outraged protest. </p>

<p>"Please let me explain." Giles asked pleading for her trust. "If you
remember, I told you I had seen evidence of a metaphysical attack on you
Buffy." </p>

<p>When he saw acknowledgement in both girls eyes he continued. </p>

<p>"Well that meant to me that somehow someone or something had gained some
kind of access to your mind, Buffy." the e-Watcher explained. "And
through you they had possible access to Willow. So you can understand
why I could not tell you about any special back up I had arranged." </p>

<p>Willow nodded her understanding and agreement with her mentor's actions,
but feeling Buffy's still seething anger she knew Giles had other things
to explain. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;He'd better explain what she wants to know quick.&lt;&gt; Willow thought
watching her beloved. &lt;&gt;If he doesn't, he's gonna have ticked off slayer
exploding all over this house. It won't be pretty.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>The more Buffy thought about what Giles had said or more what he hadn't
said the angrier she became. She clenched her jaw grinding her teeth as
her hands curled into fists. Every muscle in her body was tight like a
coiled spring ready to launch her in every direction at once. </p>

<p>"That's all fine." Buffy growled. Her anger was like a living thing
taking control of her mind and body longing to lash out at anyone handy.
"Now would you care to explain why you and the good Abbot stood by and
watched while that...that...BITCH put her sleazy hands all over me. Did
you have a good view? Was it a good show? Did it turn you all on?" </p>

<p>By the time she finished the Slayer was standing over Giles, her face
nearly purple with rage, her body tensed for attack, her voice barely
above a whisper, but every word clear and concise. Both other occupants
could clearly hear and understand every word. </p>

<p>Willow could feel her lover's anger getting out of control and knew she
had to intervene before Buffy attacked Giles, knowing that Buffy would
never forgive herself if she hurt her surrogate father. </p>

<p>Stepping up behind her lover Willow gently wrapped her arms around
Buffy, trapping her arms to her sides. Knowing she was taking a big
risk, but counting on her lover sensing who she was, Willow began
planting soft kisses on the Slayer's neck and lightly nibbling at her
flesh. </p>

<p>She knew this would distract Buffy just enough to get her anger under
control. </p>

<p>"Easy baby." Willow whispered softly into Buffy's ear so only her lover
could hear. "You know this is Giles, not some stranger. We've sworn to
hear him out, cause he usually has a reason for what he does and you
know he would have stopped if he could have. Right Giles?" </p>

<p>"Buffy, I swear to you if I had had any idea that the Countess would do
anything like that to you, I would have set up the ambush entirely
different." Giles began, hoping the vulnerable and humiliated girl would
understand what he was about to tell her. "It was the only way to free
you from whatever had taken control of your mind.
I reasoned that whatever it was would have to be there to gain full
control of your faculties, and after seeing Willow defeat it in her
sleep I knew that her powers had increased at a fantastic rate.
That led me to believe that she would be able to defeat it and
permanently free you from it's control. I also believed that the two of
you needed to join forces to overcome it." </p>

<p>The former watcher paused to get a drink of his now cold tea and let the
girls absorb what he'd already said. </p>

<p>"What I hadn't counted on was you separating from Willow." Giles
continued. "I knew she was more than likely safe, having entrusted her
safety to Angel. But when you came over that rise alone, it was the
first time all night that I was worried.
Then when the demoness gained control of you so quickly, I was
admittedly caught unaware. My biggest worry was, if I sprung the ambush
too early the Countess would get away with you, Buffy.
Knowing how much the two of you mean to each other and how unbreakable
the ties are between you, I knew that it would only be a matter of time
until she either gained control of Willow or the shock of losing you
would kill her.
Even so I was going to risk it to get you back and I was about to order
the attack, especially when I saw what she was doing to you. Buffy, I
want you to know that when I saw that creature trying to violate you, I
am sorry but, I almost lost control and in doing so would have probably
cost you at the very least your life." </p>

<p>Giles had to stop momentarily to regain control of his emotions,
reliving his moment of truth. Knowing that once again he'd acted like an
outraged father and not a watcher bothered him.
He wondered if he was capable of doing his duty to the two girls that,
for better or worse, had come to depend on his judgement and trusted him
to know what to do to keep them as safe as was possible. </p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>"You have no idea how relieved I was when I saw Willow come over that
rise." Giles began again when he'd regained control. "Once she arrived
we got into position as planned. It still might not have worked if not
for Willow's confidence in her abilities. If she had not almost
instantly taken control of the situation, I shutter to think what might
have happened.
Fortunately for all of us she had matured into what she was destined to
be and can see her own worth.
I am very proud to see that at last. It showed in how she handled the
situation tonight. She stepped in and took control, doing just exactly
what was needed so that not only were you freed of the Countess' control
but, by instinctively combining your powers hers, the two of you
destroyed her ability to control your mind entirely.
When those two demons burst into green flames, I knew Willow had
succeeded and I signalled for everyone to attack, which I might add
worked out well.
Only one of the clerics was injured and the Abbot assured me he would
make a complete recovery." </p>

<p>Buffy looked over shoulder at her beloved witch and fairly beamed with
pride at Giles' praise of the red haired Wyccan. Willow blushed at both
Giles' praise and her lover's pride filled eyes that looked deep into
hers. </p>

<p>"After all that our plan very nearly failed." their mentor reminded,
regaining their attention. "All because none of us thought anything
about her human servants.
In our arrogance we all believed that any human in her service would be
an involuntary slave.
None of us considered the possibility that anyone would serve as evil an
entity as the Countess, much less kill for her.
That ignorance on our part nearly cost us our Willow. Fortunately for
all of us Xander, as he puts it, watched your back. If he hadn't stopped
that beast, I'm positive Willow would not have survived." </p>

<p>Giles stopped here to let all the information sink in and let the girls
ask any questions. He got up and poured himself a generous portion of
his best single malt as a reward for the nights achievements. Returning
to his chair he settled in knowing one of his charges had questions. </p>

<p>It didn't surprise him it was Willow. Giles also knew he had to answer
their questions with the complete truth or he knew neither girl would
believe any of what he had said up to now and they would never trust him
again. </p>

<p>"Okay Giles." Willow began calmly, in contrast to her partner's obvious
hostility. "I can probably convince my Buffy that everything you did,
while somewhat ill conceived, was necessary at least in your mind and
that you did what you did to help us.
However there are a few things that need clearing up.
For one thing, who was that demon that we heard you call Count and those
strange looking soldiers and why did you just let them leave without
finding out why they were here." </p>

<p>"That was Count Kresis." Giles recounted hoping they would understand
his reasons. "His name has popped up in many of the ancient texts since,
well, no one knows since when.
He is a very powerful entity that had some unknown trouble in his home
realm and was exiled here.
The soldiers were a group of mercenaries under a half demon named
Caladin.
They have been tied in with Kresis several times. And the main reason I
"let" them leave was one of the things that has always been mentioned in
connection with them, is that they are totally ruthless and completely
merciless and their ability to spread unmentionable carnage is
legendary.
I doubt seriously if even you two would have survived a confrontation
with them intact.
They are loyal to one thing only and that is the Count. Since he was
apparently there for Hela and not us, I saw him as a kind of ally in
this particular case.
Caladin made it quite clear that, as long as we didn't interfere with
their hunt for the Countess, there would be no fight, and quite frankly
I believe him.
He has a kind of soldiers honor. If he wanted to kill us he would have
done it already. But if for some reason the Count wanted us gone he
would come after us with no hesitation what so ever." </p>

<p>Buffy stared at him slack jawed at not only what he'd just said but also
at the total honesty of his statement. Willow sat holding the Slayer,
nodding her head understanding his reasons and agreeing with them. </p>

<p>"Now I have some personal comments to make." Giles spoke suddenly,
catching the girls off guard by getting out of his chair and coming over
to sit on the coffee table in front of them. </p>

<p>Reaching out he took the girl's hands in his and looked directly into
their eyes focusing on them, willing them to listen to what he was going
to say. </p>

<p>"I want you both to know that I care for you deeply. I feel as if you
are my own daughters." the normally unemotional man began, his voice
trembling, knowing that if he didn't get this said now it would never be
said. "I know the past few months have not been easy for you, with all
the changes that have occurred. And I know that you haven't been totally
up front with me.
I just want you to know that with all that has gone on and especially as
hard as the last several weeks have been, I have never been so proud of
you as I am right now.
You have faced things that would have destroyed a lesser person. And I
must say that if you hadn't had each other to turn to even you wouldn't
have gotten through it.
I have seen a growth and maturity blossom in the two of you that belies
your age.
Willow, you have gone from a shy retiring shrinking violet to become a
strong confident capable young woman that can take what ever life dishes
out and handle it and to be a pillar of support for the woman you love.
You not only see her strengths but you can see her weaknesses and
vulnerability and accept her as the person she is.
You will do well in this life as long as you trust yourself and not let
doubt and fear rule your actions.
"Buffy, what can I say? When I first met you I saw you as a selfish,
self-involved, shallow, overindulged little girl and was sure that you
would be dead and I would be back in England within a month.
Thank god I was wrong. I have seen you grow to be a warm caring
nurturing individual that is involved and concerned for her fellow human
beings. And although I have never really understood you, I love you as
if you my own blood.
The biggest surprise was when you and Willow declared yourselves as
partners. That took a strength of character I'm not sure even I can
claim. I have also seen your capacity for love grow to immeasurable
depths since you have finally your true soulmate.
"You have both affected me in ways I can't begin to fathom and I want to
thank you for letting me be a part of your lives.
Yes I know all about the watcher/slayer thing, but we have gone far
beyond that relationship.
I want you both to take care and cherish each other and treat each
moment you have together as if it may be your last. Remember you are
both inordinately strong women alone but together you are unstoppable." </p>

<p>Giles looked at the two young women that he'd been through so much with
and knew that this would probably be the last time they would talk like
this. He felt a constricting pain of loss but knew he had to continue. </p>

<p>"Buffy, there is one thing that has slowed your progress more than
anything else." Giles said sternly sure that she was listening. "We very
nearly lost you this time and the one that must bear the brunt of the
blame must be laid at your feet Buffy.
It is not entirely your fault. All the signs that you were in trouble
were there, but like everyone else I didn't see them.
What we forget is that while you have superior strength and physical
stamina, you are still very much a young and vulnerable girl who has
been forced by destiny to experience far more than anyone should ever
have to endure.
In your case it is worse because of the very thing that makes you so
special to us, your sensitive and caring nature.
For some reason, known only to your subconscious, you feel responsible
for everyone that you know that has fallen in the fight we face daily.
That is why you have such vivid and horrifying nightmares that plague
your sleep.
You face these inner-demons alone only because you refuse to let us
help.
That is how the demoness gained control of you. By repressing your
feelings and letting the guilt you feel fester inside, you have made
yourself an easy target, and to be honest, the only reason you didn't
tell us you were in trouble was stupid pigheaded pride.
You were so afraid that Xander or Cordelia or I or even Willow would
think less of you if you showed weakness, that you very nearly cost not
only your life but the life of the person you say you love. This is the
only selfish and childish habit you have my dear and when it was only
you, then indulging your little ego was alright as long as you didn't
let it interfere with your duties.
But now it's not just you any more, you are about to tell the world that
you are going to love and protect her, but you will fail miserably if
you don't learn to admit that the high and mighty Slayer might need some
help coping with all the death and evil she faces every day, in her
effort to save mankind's sorry butt from the things out there that would
destroy it.
The reason you have lived longer than any other Slayer is not because
you are better than they were.
Not at all.
Many of them were far better than you, but you have outlived them all.
Do you know why?" </p>

<p>When neither girl answered and just looked at him startled by his change
of subject and hostile tone Giles continued. </p>

<p>"The reason you have made it this far is your capacity to have friends
and to count on them to help you whenever they can. In case you don't
grasp this concept let me explain. Friends like Xander, Cordelia and
even myself do not care about you because you are strong and the all
powerful Slayer. I doubt seriously if either one of them gives a damn
about the Slayer. But we care a lot about Buffy Summers and friends
trust each other enough to seek the others help when they are in
trouble.
My god Buffy! You didn't even trust Willow and she loves you more than
life itself. Are you so selfish that you would risk even her life so no
one will realize that you are a human being with human frailties and not
some super human hero?" </p>

<p>"Before you even ask, yes I am mad at you, but I am hurt more by your
lack of confidence in me and the others and the lack of respect you have
shown for this wonderfully special person you claim to love, but I could
willingly over look this entire matter if I could be sure you have
learned to never let something like this happen again.
Can you do that?" </p>

<p>"Giles, I think that will be quite enough." Willow said firmly,
unwilling to let him lash out at her lover any more. "I am sure Buffy
will never hold back her feelings again. "She is fully aware of what
happened and why it happened and the nearly tragic outcome of her error
in judgement.
I think we all are guilty of some grievous misjudgements throughout this
entire incident and I also believe we are all far too tired to have any
more discussion about that tonight.
So, if you will excuse us, my fiancee and I will go home and try to get
some sleep as we have a very busy schedule for the next two days.
Good night my friend. We will see you tomorrow for the wedding." </p>

<p>With that Willow rose gracefully from the couch, leaned over and kissed
Giles gently on the cheek. She helped her quietly weeping lover to her
feet then, holding her protectively, led the sobbing blonde from Giles'
house to their own next door. </p>

<p>Knowing the true depths of her lover's pain from the revelations her
watcher had just revealed, Willow took Buffy straight to bed and held
her as she cried out her sorrow and pain, until the Slayer fell into an
exhausted and dreamless sleep. </p>

<p>Buffy was soon joined in the land of Morpheus by her beloved witch. Both
were too tired to be excited about their upcoming nuptials and only
cared for their own sleep deprived bodies and minds, all promises of
passion forgotten. Put off for now.</p>

<p>Buffy woke slowly, her eyes protesting painfully at the brightness of
the sunlight that flooded their bedroom. She felt the comfortably
familiar weight of her lover on her chest. The still groggy blonde
opened her eyes and looked down at the red-head that was sprawled out
over her covering her body. </p>

<p>On an impulse Buffy buried her face in the tousled red hair inhaling
deeply, enjoying the intoxicating scent of her beloved witch. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;This has got to be what Heaven is like.&lt;&gt; she mused happily. &lt;&gt;I have
no idea what I've done in my life so right that gives me the chance to
be with her, but I will thank whatever god is responsible for this every
minute of everyday for the rest of my life, and it still won't be
enough.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy pulled her head back, sighed softly and found herself looking into
of the most beautiful sleepy eyes in the universe.   </p>

<p>"Hey." Willow said sleepily.   </p>

<p>"Hey yourself, sleepyhead." Buffy answered, smiling down at the
substitute blanket, amazed at how just the sound of Willow's voice
turned her on. "You ready to get up?" </p>

<p>"Don't wanna get up." The sleepy red head pouted. "Feels too good right
here." </p>

<p>To make her point Willow snuggled into Buffy causing their bodies to
rub, eliciting a moan from the already aroused Slayer's throat. She let
a hand slowly slide down her lover's side, so that it just grazed her
skin raising goose bumps over Willow's skin. </p>

<p>The tiny blonde brought the hand around to cup a soft breast and began
teasing the already hard nipple with her thumb, forcing a sensual growl
from the red head.
Willow smiled sexily up at her lover and began licking and kissing any
of Buffy's exposed skin she could reach, enraptured by the taste. </p>

<p>The highly aroused witch gently grabbed some of her lover's skin between
her teeth. Buffy growled and pulled Willow up to her until their lips
met, gently at first then more passionate, more insistent. </p>

<p>Buffy lightly nipped at her lover's lower lip demanding entrance. The
witch's lips parted obligingly allowing the impassioned Slayer's tongue
to enter and explore freely the depths of her mouth. </p>

<p>Buffy devoured Willow's sweet mouth as both lovers let themselves sink
into the pleasurable sensations washing over their bodies, bringing
their every nerve ending to life. They shivered as chills of excitement
ran up and down their spines. They finally pulled back from the kiss,
forced by lack of air. </p>

<p>"Gods I want you so bad it hurts." the Slayer moaned, and began licking
and nipping at Willow's neck. </p>

<p>Buffy slid her hands down Willow's back relishing the feel of the
muscles flexing and relaxing under the soft smooth skin. Then grasping
her lover's taught rear, Buffy pulled her witch tighter against her
enjoying the heat radiating from the red head's body. </p>

<p>Willow opened her eyes and saw the clock next to the bed and with a
groan of disappointment reluctantly pushed away from her persistently
grasping blonde lover. </p>

<p>"Buffy, we gotta stop baby." Willow told her already over aroused
Slayer. "I'm sorry hon, but it's already nine and our wedding is today,
in case you forgot." </p>

<p>She had forgotten in the heat of the moment, but wasn't about to admit
it to Willow. With a loud growl of frustration Buffy tried to pull the
red head back into the embrace, but the determined witch wasn't giving
in. </p>

<p>"Come on lover we can't, there's not enough time." Willow insisted,
pushing on Buffy's chest. "Do you really want Cordelia or worse one of
our mothers to come barging in here in the middle of us making love?" </p>

<p>The visual of Willow's mother walking in and finding Buffy nestled
comfortably between her daughter's legs, happily lapping away while
Willow writhed and moaned (or screamed as she normally did) effectively
put the damper on the Slayer's lust. </p>

<p>With a final roar of total frustration, Buffy released her lover and
quickly got out of their bed.   </p>

<p>"Real nice visual Wills." The Slayer growled in frustration, her voice
thick with pent up lust. "You win this one, but just remember my smug
little witch, I'll get you back. You just wait Willow Rosenberg. You'll
get yours." </p>

<p>"Ooo, I can hardly wait." Willow purred seductively, as she headed for
the bathroom with an exaggerated sway to her hips. "I'll settle for your
promises for now, but later I expect you to live up to every one of them
Chosen One." </p>

<p>With a giggle the red head was through the door before Buffy could
react. The bride to be laughed and shook her head at her lover's
behavior. She slipped on her robe and began getting things together for
later. </p>

<p>"Oh man." the Slayer muttered to herself. "I'd better conserve my
strength. I've got a feeling that a certain red-head isn't going to take
'I'm tired' for an answer tonight." </p>

<p>Willow returned wearing only a towel and using another to dry her hair.
Buffy looked at her and a wistful smile lit up her face. </p>

<p>"I've never seen anyone look that good wearing a towel." the blonde
sighed. "Those super models got nothin' on my Wills." </p>

<p>Willow blushed shyly at this unexpected compliment, turning her lover on
even more. </p>

<p>"You know." Buffy purred, as she took a step toward the object of her
desire. "It wouldn't take all that long if we..." </p>

<p>"Don't even go there, Miss Overheated Slayer." Willow said, holding up
her hand to stop her approaching paramour. "We don't have time to do it
right and if we can't do it right, I don't want to do it at all."
Faced with that kind of logic, Buffy had no choice but to retreat. </p>

<p>"Oh all right." the blonde mumbled, as she walked toward the second
bathroom seriously pouting. </p>

<p>Willow thought her lover was so adorable she almost gave in, but was
stopped by the ringing of their door bell. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Whew!&lt;&gt; she thought relieved. &lt;&gt;Talk about saved by the bell.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>"Cheer up Slayer." the witch called to her partner's retreating back.
"Soon you'll be too busy to be horny." </p>

<p>"Yeah right!" came the answering growl. "Wanna bet?" </p>

<p>Cordelia, true to form was the first to arrive and instantly took
charge, rushing the two soon to be weds all over the house, while
handling all the last minute details that could only be done the day of
the wedding and any last second emergencies that occurred. </p>

<p>The girl was a wonder. Several of the people from the wedding suppliers
asked if she was interested in party and wedding planing professionally.
Cordelia was flattered and promised them she'd think about it. </p>

<p>"Just think Cordy." Both of her friends told her when they heard of the
offers. "It's the perfect career. You get to push people around, spend
their money and get paid for it. It's the perfect job and you'd be the
best at it." </p>

<p>Their friend blushed at their half serious teasing. But before she could
say anything, Cordelia saw one of the florists trying to bring in the
wrong flowers and was off in a flash to pounce on the unsuspecting
miscreant.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Around noon Willow headed for her parent's house. Even though neither of
them were speaking to her mother, Willow's father insisted they still
hold the ceremony in his huge back gardens. </p>

<p>So with Xander driving she prepared to face the dreaded mother monster,
while
Joyce and Cordelia took Buffy to her mother's house to get ready under
the intensely close supervision of Cordelia and Joyce. </p>

<p>Being a normal mother Joyce had tried to put in her 2 cents worth over
the wedding plans. But unlike Sheila Rosenberg, Joyce Summers knew when
to just back off and let her daughter take care of things. All of them
were hoping for the best but expecting the worst. </p>

<p>Four o'clock that afternoon found a very nervous Willow standing in
front of an altar in her parents beautifully landscaped back garden,
fidgeting, with Xander unobtrusively rubbing the small of her back
trying to soothe her ragged nerves. </p>

<p>"Hey Will." Xander whispered. "What's the matter, afraid the Buffster's
gonna run off with Cordy and leave you standin' at the altar?" </p>

<p>Willow glared up at her life long friend and saw his brown eyes
sparkling with humor at her expense. </p>

<p>"Shut up Xander." the witch growled with mock jealousy. "If I recall
correctly it wasn't all that long ago that your girlfriend was making
comments about my fiancee's cute little rear end." </p>

<p>"What!" Xander blurted out, shocked at his friend's comment . </p>

<p>This time it was Willow with the mischievously evil smirk. Xander more
felt rather than heard the red head's chuckle. </p>

<p>"Ha ha very funny." he muttered under his breath. "Nothin' worse than a
witch that thinks she's funny." </p>

<p>Thanking the Goddess for her best friend and his overactive sense of
humor, Willow also took the time to send her thanks to whichever Gods
were responsible for the perfect weather, so that they were able to have
the outdoor wedding they had both wanted. </p>

<p>The witch's thoughts were interrupted by a commotion at the back of the
assembled guests. She looked back wondering what was going on when she
was struck breathless by the sight that met her eyes. Giles looked
positively handsome in his new Armani tux and Cordelia was a regal
vision in her light blue gown (the color inspired by Willow's "Xander in
a blue tux" remark) but they all came in a pale second compared to the
heart stopping revelation on the librarian's arm. </p>

<p>Buffy was the quintessential beautiful bride, not that she didn't think
the petite blonde was beautiful all the time, but now on this day at
this place she was far beyond anything as mundane as beautiful.
In fact Willow's vocabulary failed her. Words like gorgeous, etherial,
and magnificent were somehow inadequate to describe the vision that
filled the red head's very being with unbearable joy. </p>

<p>She was so affected by the sight she forgot to breath until the burning
of her oxygen starved lungs reminded her. </p>

<p>"Come on girl, breathe damn it." Willow told herself. "By the Gods,
she's so beautiful it hurts." </p>

<p>"Whoa, you got that right." Xander whispered in answer, surprising his
friend who hadn't realized she'd spoke out loud. </p>

<p>When Buffy saw her beloved looking at her and recognised the look in the
awestruck witch's eyes, the Slayer smiled shyly dazzling her intended
even more. </p>

<p>"Will, you're gonna be alright." Xander whispered in her ear, causing
her to realize her whole body was trembling at the sight of her bride. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Breathe, Willow, breathe.&lt;&gt; she told herself, while nodding to
reassure her best man. &lt;&gt;She'll kill you if you pass out now and that
would sure put a damper on the old wedding night.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>Xander gave his witchy friend a strange look when he saw her blush, then
heard her chuckle under her breath. </p>

<p>Willow lost all contact with her surroundings, her eyes were captured
and held by the most beautiful creation in the universe. The Slayer
seemed to glow with a pure white light that eclipsed the sun itself. </p>

<p>She felt her legs go weak and her knees threatened to buckle, but by the
strength of her resolve not to embarrass her bride kept upright. </p>

<p>"I can't believe she wants me." the red Head whispered to her best man.
"If all these people weren't here you'd see the world's happiest happy
dance." </p>

<p>Xander couldn't help himself and blurted out a loud laugh that he tried
unsuccessfully to disguise as a cough. </p>

<p>For just an instant all eyes were on the terminally embarrassed best
man. </p>

<p>Then the organ began and the spectators turned to see what Willow had
already seen, the petite blonde's presence transcended any possible
written definition or phrase leaving everyone stunned by her almost
supernatural beauty. </p>

<p>The sound of the collective gasp was nearly deafening. </p>

<p>Willow watched mesmerized as Giles and Buffy walked slowly down the
aisle toward her, she could feel the nervous perspiration beading on her
upper lip and without thinking licked it off. </p>

<p>Once they were standing next to her and Giles placed the Slayer's hand
into Willow's they looked into each other's eyes. </p>

<p>Buffy gave her lover one of her patented 300 watt smiles and suddenly
the only thing that mattered to the red haired witch was spending the
rest of her life making this Goddess in human form happy. </p>

<p>At Buffy's prompting Willow remembered where they were and that there
were others there also, they turned to face the Rabbi that had consented
to officiate the unorthodox ceremony. </p>

<p>She smiled at the two young women facing her and could see the
overwhelming love that radiated from the couple and smiled reassuringly
at them. </p>

<p>She had known Giles since his 'Ripper' days and was fully aware of the
significance of what was occurring and her part in it. </p>

<p>Turning her attention to the gathering behind the couple it was apparent
that not everyone was as enthusiastic over this occasion as others. </p>

<p>"It is my great honor to have been asked by these two young people to be
here today." the Rabbi began, surveying the crowd and letting her
piercing grey eyes settle on each less than happy face out there resting
the longest on Willow's mother. "This is the most important time of
their lives and if there are any here that cannot share the joyful
spirit in which it is intended they should leave now rather than allow
their negativity mar this otherwise perfect day." </p>

<p>Pausing to allow any that wished to leave to do so, the Rabbi smiled at
the two women facing her. When no one moved the Rabbi continued. </p>

<p>"Now that we are all agreed to share their joy." the Rabbi restarted.
"And as the unusual nature of this occasion is somewhat outside my
training, it is my belief that Buffy and Willow have written their own
vows. At this time I turn it over to them. Willow, I believe you are
first." </p>

<p>Willow turned to face her beloved and gazed into the two brightest
points of light in her universe. Gulping hard then clearing her throat
she began. </p>

<p>"Buffy, I don't have the words to adequately describe my feelings for
you." the trembling Wyccan began. "You are the sun that lights my days
and the moon that blesses my nights.
Without you I'm empty. I'd be wandering aimlessly through life with no
direction no goals never knowing the true meaning of friendship, life,
or love.
Because of you I have purpose. I have a reason to believe that tomorrow
will be worth living and that no matter what all my tomorrows bring they
will be better for your having been with me.
Without you the universe makes no sense and there is no reason to go on.
You are the rest of me.
You are my strength and my courage.
You are more to me than life itself because you are my spirits guide.
When I am frightened you protect me.. When I am hurt you care for me.
When I am lost you give me direction.
I promise to be at your side no matter what we face we shall now and
forever face it together." </p>

<p>Both women were weeping uncontrollably making it impossible for Buffy to
read the things she had written and so she decided to "wing it". </p>

<p>"Willow, my Wills." Buffy began, letting herself get lost in the
fathomless pools of her lover's eyes. "I still can't believe where we
are.
My greatest fear is that I'll wake up and find this is all just some
wonderful dream. I remember the day I met you and asking who is this
beautiful soul and why does she appear to like me.
I think even then my heart knew you, that my soul felt the pull of your
soul, but being young and naive I simply chalked it up to friendship.
I was right, but over the years since that day you have redefined that
term until without either of us realizing it our feelings past beyond
friendship into the realm of true deep lasting love and respect.
Now we have at last come to that point where we must stop denying the
truth that we both know.
It is time to leave the half truths of our childhood and start on the
interwoven path that our destinies have laid before us. I can't do this
alone.
I need my Willow to be with me.
You are the rock that anchors me.
Your goodness keeps me from go over to the darkness that has nearly
claimed me many times.
You are my other half, the soul that completes mine.
Without you I'd have lain down and died long ago.
I love you with every fiber of my being. I give you my heart, my mind,
my body, and my soul.
Do with what you will but I beg you to love them and hold them near your
heart because that's the only place I truly want to be. " </p>

<p>Unable to continue, the two teary eyed young women turned to face the
Rabbi. She smiled down at these two bright loving faces and was struck
once again by the deep abiding unquestioning love they had for each
other. </p>

<p>The sight brought tears of hope and happiness to the older woman's eyes.
She looked out over the gathering and saw that there was not a dry eye
in the place. </p>

<p>During this she had Xander and Cordelia give her the rings, the Rabbi
looked at the two identical silver rings and gasped quietly as a jolt of
unknown power shot up her arm. </p>

<p>She held her hand that was holding the rings to the couple and could
feel a powerful vibration filling the air as lightening shot across the
cloudless sky. </p>

<p>"The rings symbolize the strength and depth of your commitment to each
other. By giving them you are inviting your partner into your life and
by accepting them you are pledging to love and respect them to the
exclusion of all others." the Rabbi said quietly, almost as if the words
were meant solely for the couple being joined. </p>

<p>Once the two had given and received their rings the Rabbi reached and
took their joined hands into hers and when they looked at her she spoke.
"The path the two of you have chosen to follow is a path less travelled.
The days ahead of you will hold many trials as well as joys and the two
of you have chosen to face them together.
That is a good thing in this world.
Just be sure to be there for each other. Let no day end without showing
and telling your partner what their love and support means to you.
Your life will never be the same. But remember you are no longer forced
to face your trials and tribulations alone and that you have the
unwavering love of each other to rely on." </p>

<p>She smiled and looked out to the spectators and turned to the two that
were now one and smiled. "As much as these two young people have pledged
their commitment to each other in words and symbolically with the
exchange of rings, by the power afforded me both by my beliefs and those
assembled I declare these two souls joined and would introduce them for
the first time as Buffy and Willow Rosenberg-Summers." </p>

<p>Both Buffy and Willow were beaming and blushing as the gathering stood
and cheered theirs union. </p>

<p>Xander leaned in and whispered into Willow's ear. "Come on Will, you're
supposed to kiss her or something." </p>

<p>Willow took her new wife's chin in her hand and gently turned the red
faced blonde's head to face her, then softly pressed her lips to Buffy's
giving her a chaste loving kiss, not wanting to embarrass her or any of
the others. </p>

<p>Buffy figured out what she was doing and wrapped her arms around
Willow's neck and proceeded to kiss the red head passionately not
releasing the kiss until the lack of oxygen became an issue. </p>

<p>"Wow!" was all Willow could gasp out when her lover finally released her.</p>

<p>"That should hold you till tonight my little witch." Buffy told her with
a wicked smile.
"Now let's go. Cordy's got a party planed and the sooner we get there
the sooner we can get started on the Honeymoon." </p>

<p>Buffy grabbed her new wife's hand and led the still partially stunned
woman back up the aisle to the limo Willow's father had gotten them. The
Slayer dove into the back of the long black vehicle and pulled a very
willing red head in with her. </p>

<p>As the chauffeur shut the car door, nearby guests could hear a giggling
Slayer say. </p>

<p>"To the party Jeeves and step on it." </p>
