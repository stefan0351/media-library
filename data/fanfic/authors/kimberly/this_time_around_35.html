<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Five: Honey, I'm A Slayer -->

<p>***Outside; Night***</p>

<p>After a long day of school Brooke, Sam, and Faith decided they
deserved some fun, and Buffy just thought she'd tag along with her
lover.  They were making the rounds of all the cool teen hangouts in
the city.  After spending an hour at the last place doing non-stop
dancing they decided to go somewhere quieter and just hang out, so
that's why they were out, at night, on a dark street.</p>

<p>Sam unconsciously clung to Faith, feeling protected being near her
love.  Brooke very consciously clung to Buffy, her eyes darting
everywhere; she so did not want to become a rape or murder statistic.</p>

<p>The small group was just passing by an alleyway when a hand shot out
and grabbed Sam's arm (she was the closest to the alley).  Faith was
immediately in a fighting stance, Buffy just behind her.  Neither of
them were surprised in the least when four figures stepped out, all
of them vampires.  To Brooke, and a very terrified Sam (still in the
clutch of one) they looked like no more than very badly scared
meanies, or bad guys, both terms work.</p>

<p>"I dunno B, only four, barely even work up a sweat."  Faith said
tauntingly, never taking her eyes off the one that held Sam hostage.</p>

<p>"Two for me, two for you?"  Buffy asked, moving up to be standing
even with Faith.  Both slayers could feel their blood pumping
furiously through their bodies, adrenaline was high, the fight was
about to be on.</p>

<p>"Sounds good, I'll take the left you take the right?"  Faith asked in
the same bored tone Buffy had used.</p>

<p>"Sure."  Buffy agreed.  With lightening fast speed Faith went right
and Buffy went left, throwing the vamps off, and putting Faith in the
position to tackle the one who had dared to touch her Samantha.
Faith and her first vamp rolled once before Faith came up straddling
him, with one quick motion she let the stake from her jacket sleeve
fall into her hand and staked the vampire in his undead heart.  She
was up and on her feet just in time to see Buffy stake her first and
go after her second, Faith decided to do the same.  In just a minute
both vampires were nothing but dust.  Leaving behind two slayers (who
hadn't even worked up a sweat), and two very shocked girls.</p>

<p>"Sam.Samantha.baby are you ok?"  Faith asked as she came up to Sam,
who appeared to be in shock from what she had just seen, her
journalistic mind trying to rationalize what had just happened.  She
couldn't do, there was no rational explanation and that was seriously
throwing her off.  Brooke was in a similar state, her mouth opening
and closing like a fish out of water, she was just staring at Buffy.</p>

<p>"I think we broke them."  Buffy said in hopes to lighten the mood.
What it did was snap Sam out of her shock, and into journalist mode.</p>

<p>"What were those.guys?  How did you do that?  How did they go all
poof like that?  What was wrong with their faces?  Why do you carry a
wooden, Jesus what is that a stake?"  Before she could fire off
anymore questions Faith answered the ones already posed.</p>

<p>"They were vampires, and yes they're real.  It was easy; just stick
the pointy end in.  They just go poof, don't know why, cool sound
though.  All vamp's faces are like that in vamp mode, although they
can look totally human when they want.  And yes it's a wooden stake,
easiest way to kill vamps.  And before you ask, we're slayers."
Buffy nodded her head in agreement to the answers.</p>

<p>"Slayers?"  This from Brooke, she finally got her voice to work again
and decided to join the conversation.</p>

<p>"How does that go B?"  </p>

<p>"In every generation there is a Chosen One. She alone will stand
against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is
the Slayer."  Buffy answered, she just loved saying it, almost as
much as Giles did.</p>

<p>"But you said that you both were," Sam responded, her face filled
with questions she still wanted to ask.</p>

<p>"Well ya see, B died, sendin' out this chick called Kendra, she died,
so I was called."  Faith explained.</p>

<p>"Why you?"  Sam asked with tears in her eyes, the thought that her
love had to stand against all the bad stuff (that most people didn't
even know about) alone scared her.  It scared her even more when she
thought that Faith could die, easily.</p>

<p>"Y'know, I've asked myself that everyday since, I dunno why me, but
it's my destiny."  Faith answered as she took Sam into her arms.  "I
love you Samantha, and I would have told you, I just wanted some
time, to be normal, a normal couple, first."  Faith explained while
holding Sam as close as humanly possible.</p>

<p>Brooke looked at Buffy, "you died?"  Buffy could see the fear in
Brooke's eyes and walked over to her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, just for a minute though."</p>

<p>"Don't do it again."  Brooke said, her demeanor starting to crack too.</p>

<p>"Promise."  Buffy responded with a smile, taking the taller girl into
her arms and kissing her soundly.</p>

<p>Sam finally pulled away from Faith, there were still so many
questions she wanted to ask, but they could wait right now she just
wanted to crawl into bed and have her Faith hold her.  "Take me
home?"  Faith nodded and started leading the small group the back to
Sam and Brooke's house.  No one said a word rest of the way.</p>
