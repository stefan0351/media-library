<!-- This Time Around \ Part Nine: Dreaming of Angels in Leather -->

<p>***The Palace (Sam and Brook's house)***</p>
<p>Sam's arm flew out from underneath the covers and slapped the
offending chirping item. The alarm clock shut up and the room was
back to the peaceful silence that had surrounded it before. Throwing
the covers off she got up to go about her morning routine. With the
addition of a cold shower. The one she had taken after gym the day
before had helped, she went home and didn't think of the dark goddess
for rest of the evening. But then night came, and she went to sleep,
allowing her subconscious to take over, and it wasn't even close to
being done thinking about Faith.</p>
<p>She couldn't figure out what it was about Faith that was drawing her
in. She had never, ever thought of herself as gay, and now here she
was, practically drooling over this new girl. And dreaming about her
too. Sam closed her eyes and let her mind drift back to the dream.
It was all dark and mysterious, just like Faith. They were somewhere
Sam didn't think she had ever been, a club or something, and she was
just sitting there when Faith came in. Without saying a word Faith
walked up to her, took her hand, and led her out to the dance floor.
Their bodies ground into each other erotically along with the beat of
the song playing. Faith was behind her, Faith's arm around her waist
holding her closer, her other arm linked with Sam's around her neck,
holding Sam's hand in place. </p>
<p>And they danced, without a care in the world. She wasn't thinking
about who was watching her, what people were thinking about her, she
just wanted, needed the contact Faith so willing gave her. It was
like nothing she had ever felt before. She felt so safe in Faith's
arms. Of course, she reminded herself, it was just a dream, and
dreams don't always come true. Sam finished up her cold shower and
headed downstairs for breakfast, this was going to be a long day.</p>
