<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twelve: A Plan In Motion -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Novak***</p>
<p>Nicole sat down on the couch in the Novak and dialed a number from
memory on her cell phone. It was the number she called anytime she
needed life destroying information. And she was definitely going to
be destroying Faith's life, one way or another. When the other line
clicked Nicole said simply, "Faith Spencer, Kenney High." And hung
up. Everything would be taken care of for her, and anything in
Faith's past or even present would be brought to the light of day.
And Nicole knew, just knew, that someone like Faith would have
something she was hiding.</p>
<p>Checking her make-up in the mirror she was about to leave when the
object of her deepest hatred, ok it was tied now, walked in. Sam
walked in and sat down, still stunned. "What's with you Spam,
recently discover you're the worlds worst journalist, sorry sweetie
the rest of us already knew that." Nicole got all ready for the
witty come back she knew would come her way; already have a deflector
in mind. But, much to her disappointment, it never came. Sam just
sat there, staring off into space. "Spamy the luncheon meat?"
Nicole asked waving her hand in front of Sam's face.</p>
<p>Suddenly breaking out of whatever haze she was in Sam said, "what did
I do to deserve this? God must hate me." Nicole was so completely
taken back by what Sam said she didn't know how to respond. "I'm
doomed." Sam put her head in her hands and sighed, she hadn't
actually realized it was Satan with her, if she had, she probably
wouldn't have let her little confession (what she actually confessed)
out. As it were though she just sat there, head in hands, sighing.</p>
<p>Nicole finally snapped out of it and replied, "of course God hates
you, she hates all fashion victims. Which should put you at the top
of her hit list." Again Nicole expected a comeback, which never came.</p>
<p>Sam raised her head and asked, "you really think God is a she?"</p>
<p>Now Nicole was convinced something was actually wrong with Spamy.
Two whole minutes in each other's presence and she hadn't said
anything hateful. It was just wrong. That was how it was done,
Nicole said something mean, and Sam had a witty comeback, which Sam
reversed so that is made Nicole sound bad. That's how it had always
been, and damn it she couldn't go and change things now, it wasn't
fair.</p>
<p>"What did a dog eat your latest article or something?" Nicole asked
as though she really didn't care, she had to fix Spam or all the fun
would be taken out of her day, it just wasn't complete without a
verbal sparring match, and Spam was the only one who was even close
to her level in that area.</p>
<p>"Bio Glass." Sam responded as if that explained everything. Nicole
thought back to that particular class. She had been paired with Mary
Cherry, who right now was somewhere paying someone to do the
assignment for them. The newest sadistic project to come out of Bio
Glass's mind was something to do with teenage hormones. No big deal.</p>
<p>"Who's your partner, April Tuna?" Being paired with the lowest of
the low on the social ladder would explain someone acting like this,
or so Nicole reasoned.</p>
<p>"Brooke and Faith." Sam said with a moan like quality in her voice.
Nicole sighed, no problem there, Spam had been paired with the queen
of Kennedy High, even if the queen of Skank was thrown in there, she
should be happy, again that's how Nicole figured it. Finally tiring
of trying to fix the hopeless Nicole walked out of the Novak to find
some other loser to insult, leaving Sam all by herself.</p>
