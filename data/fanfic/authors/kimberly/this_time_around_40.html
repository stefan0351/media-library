<!-- This Time Around \ Part Fourty: Guidence From An Unusual Place -->

<p>***Park***</p>

<p>Mike sat and watched the ducks swim around the lake.
He still couldn't believe what he had done.  He had
never raised a hand in anger at his daughter, but
today....today he had violently grabbed her arm, and
twisted her about the room.  He may not have left a
perminate make on her arm, but he knew from experience
that there was a scar on her heart and soul.  When his
father had struck him as a child he always promised
himself that no matter how mad he got he would  never
do what he did.  And now he had broken that promise.
He didn't know if he could looke Brooke in the eyes
again.  If she could look him in his.</p>

<p>He hadn't changed his mind.  He still thought that
homosexuality was wrong.  But he also knew he couldn't
tell Brooke not to.  That would just put strain on
everyone.  Because Brooke was a teenager, him telling
her not to see someone would just make her sneak
around to do it.  And Jane had already told Sam that
she wouldn't stop her.  So it wouldn't be fair to tell
Brooke she couldn't do the same.  Mike was lost
totally in his thoughts when someone sat on the bench
next to him.</p>

<p>"McQueen."</p>

<p>Mike looked next to him.  There sat Bio Glass.  Or so
his daughter called her, him, it.  Mike had gone to
highschool with the Glass twins, and still he didn't
know for sure what sex it was.  He knew the other one
had been a girl, she had been the nurse at the school
for awhile.  "Glass."</p>

<p>"Nice day."  Bio Glass said.  It hated small talk, but
sensed it was needed right now.</p>

<p>"Yup."</p>

<p>"Nice weather."</p>

<p>"Yup."  Mike really didn't feel like talking, and just
wished that it would go away so he could sulk and
think about what he was going to do with his daughter.</p>

<p>"Fix it."  Glass said suddenly.</p>

<p>Mike looked strangely at Glass, "huh?"</p>

<p>"Fathers..."  Glass muttered to itself.  "Whatever it
was you did, say sorry and fix it."  Simple advice,
right?</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I can..."  Mike said sadly.</p>

<p>"Then try."  Glass said and got up, leaving without
another word.  Mike stared after it long after it was
out of sight.  Then he got up to go home, he and
Brooke needed to have a long talk.  If she would talk
to him that was.</p>
