<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Seven: Was It All A Dream? -->

<p>***The Palace; Sam's Room***</p>

<p>Sam woke up warmly snuggled in Faith's strong arms.  For a moment she
was the happiest she could be, and then the events of the night
flooded back into her mind.  She wondered if it had all been just
some really weird dream that came about from eating Brooke's cooking
again.  And then her eyes landed on the stake that was sitting on her
nightstand.  The stake Faith had given her in case for any reason she
had to go out at night and Faith wasn't with her.  Nope wasn't a
dream.  Real life, with a vengence was more like it.</p>

<p>The warm body pillow under Sam shifted, then yawned as Faith woke
up.  She smiled to Sam and then followed her line of sight.  Sam was
still staring at the stake.  Placing her finger under Sam's chin
Faith lifted her face so that they were eye to eye, lip to lip.  "Are
you ok?"</p>

<p>"It's not fair."  Sam said, and then sniffled.  She had thought she
was all cried out last night, apparently she wasn't.</p>

<p>"I know baby, believe me I know.  But you can't fight destiny, I've
tried."  Faith closed the whole two centemeters seperating her lips
from Sam's and kissed her lightly.  She knew there was no real way to
erase Sam's fears, hell she had them too.  She decided she was going
to have to talk to Buffy and see how she and the farmboy delt with
it.  </p>

<p>"I don't want you to fight it."  Sam said quietly.  Faith looked at
her in shock, it wasn't what she had expected to hear at all.  "If
out of the five billion people on this Earth YOU were chosen, then,
well...I guess I'm kinda proud of you.  I mean, MY girlfriend, the
Chosen One."  Faith smiled and kissed Sam again, with more passion
this time.  Well at least she wouldn't have to have that conversation
with Buffy.  "But," Sam said when the kissed broke off, "you die and
I swear to God I am coming after you, you got that?!"</p>

<p>Faith chuckled, "wouldn't have it any other way Samantha."</p>
