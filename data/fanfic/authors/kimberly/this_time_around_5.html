<!-- This Time Around \ Part Five: When's Lunch Again? -->

<p>***Kennedy High; hallway***</p>
<p>"So.where ya from?" Sam asked curiously. They had been out of the
office for about five minutes and Faith hadn't said a word. The
journalist in her was just dieing to know everything, all the facts.</p>
<p>"Boston." Faith answered simply. Smirking some when Sam heaved an
aggravated sigh.</p>
<p>"Ok.what brings you here?"</p>
<p>"My Harley."</p>
<p>Sam's brow scrunched up some. Getting answers from this girl was
worse than getting teeth pulled. And then, thankfully, she noticed
Carmen, Lily, Josh, Harrison, and Sugar Daddy standing not to far
away. "Hey look some of my friends are over there." Sam started
walking over to them, not really caring if Faith was still following
her or not. "Hey guys, what's up?"</p>
<p>"Damn where'd a fine piece of woman like you come from yo?" Sugar
asked as soon as Sam and the girl with her arrived by them.</p>
<p>Faith's eyebrow rose, and she smirked, why not have a little fun.
She walked, swaggered really, her hips moving way more than they
needed to, right up to the big guy who had addressed her. She also
noticed that all the guys there were practically drooling. "Piece of
woman like me?" Faith asked innocently.</p>
<p>Sugar was suddenly imagining her holding an apple out for him, with a
big snake around her shoulders. Shaking his head he answered, "yeah,
you're supper hot yo."</p>
<p>"Supper hot eh? Well." Faith trailed off so that he could supply
his name.</p>
<p>"My peeps call me Sugar Daddy." A fine sweat broke out on Sugar's
face, and he wiped at it.</p>
<p>"I'm sure they do.Sugar." Faith walked so close up to him so that he
was now pressed against the lockers, but never actually touched
him. "That's a nice jersey ya got there." Faith said, flicking off
some imaginary flint, "play?" Sugar only nodded his head. "Big bad
football player eh? Well Mr. Daddy," Faith stared him right in the
eyes, "nest time you talk to me like that, I'm gonna turn you into a
cheerleader, got me?" Faith tone was dangerous, and Sugar only
nodded again. As soon as Faith backed up Sugar ran away without
saying anything. Faith just smirked.</p>
<p>"And this is Faith." Sam said to her gawking friends.</p>
<p>"That was wow!" Lily stated excitedly. "Everyone woman should be
able to do that when men get oppressing."</p>
<p>"This is Lily, Carmen, Josh, and Harrison." Sam finished the
introductions.</p>
<p>"S'up." Was Faith's greeting. </p>
<p>"So.I guess you found the office then." Carmen said just so that
something was said, she didn't want it to fall into one of those
obnoxious uncomfortable silences, she hated those.</p>
<p>"Yup." Everyone stared at Faith waiting for her to say more, when
she didn't Sam sighed again; this was going to be a long week.</p>
<p>"Well we better get going, don't want to be late or there's not
tellin' what Bio Glass will do." Everyone nodded, with the exception
of Faith, and started heading off to their classes.</p>
<p>"Bio Glass?" Faith asked her first question just before they entered
the biology room.</p>
<p>"Well we don't know if it's male or female, so we just call it Bio
Glass." Sam explained distractedly, she was worrying about what they
would be subjected to this year. They entered the classroom, and
since it was the first day, sat where they wanted. And then Bio
Glass came in, just as the bell rang, and Faith understood why Sam
had said `it'.</p>
<p>"All right kiddies get settled and get out your notebooks to take
notes on your brand new homework project." Bio Glass announced, and
then started on role. Most of the names were recognized as people
who had taken the class last year. When `it' got to Spencer,
Faith `it' spoke up. "My, my looks like we got ourselves a new one.
Spencer, Faith."</p>
<p>"Here." Faith answered appropriately, she was still trying to figure
out not only what `it' was, but how `it' could give homework on the
first day, it was just wrong.</p>
<p>Bio Glass got a glint in `it's' eye and then said, "oh, please stand,
tell us about yourself." All eyes turned to Faith. Sam was secretly
glad, now she got to find out some more about the mystery girl.
Among the faces now staring at her Faith recognized just about
everyone she had been introduced to this morning.</p>
<p>"Hmm.'bout me eh? Names Faith.from Boston.when I ain't here, I'm on
my Harley." Faith smirked when she heard Sam give her another
aggravated sigh; it was starting to become fun aggravating her tour
guide.</p>
<p>Bio Glass didn't look too happy with the
information `itself'. "Sit!" `It' barked out, and then proceeded to
tell them about their project.</p>
