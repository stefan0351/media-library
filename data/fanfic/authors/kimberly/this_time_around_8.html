<!-- This Time Around \ Part Eight: You're a what?! -->

<p>***Nadia's House***</p>
<p>When Faith got home from school that day she couldn't wait to go out
and slay. She needed to find a short, blonde, female vampire with
spiky hair. Sam had called Nicole Satan, from what she heard from
others it seemed to fit, idly she wondered if she was a demon, then
she could slay her, that would be fun. All the thoughts of slaying
thought brought up the question of what she would tell Nadia. The
woman had welcomed her into her home, and she didn't want to lie to
her. Plus from what B told her, Mrs. S didn't take it so well when
she found out about slayers and shit.</p>
<p>She didn't know how much G-man had told Nad either. It would be
easier if she knew that, maybe it would be a good idea to call and
ask. Before she could get to a phone thought Nadia showed up in
front of her. "How was school deary?"</p>
<p>"Interesting."</p>
<p>"Well that's good, the more interesting it is, the more likely you'll
want to go back. So did you make an new little friends?" Nadia
asked as she led Faith into the kitchen and sat her down at the
table, putting a glass of milk and some cookies in front of her.</p>
<p>Smiling, a real, true smile, Faith answered, "yeah guess so.there's
this one chick Lily, I think I'm her new idol.this other chick Sam is
like my guide to the school, she's pretty cool." Faith trailed off
and munched on a cookie thoughtfully, Nadia just waited patiently for
her to continue. "I mean she's not like anyone else I've ever met.
smart.got one wicked tongue too.I think I aggravate her though."</p>
<p>"Hmmm.sounds like a nice girl."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Faith looked down at her now empty glass of milk. She hated
milk and she had just drank a whole glass of it, without even
thinking about it! Well maybe that's `cause she was thinking about
Sam. Faith let her head fall forward and hit the table, she was
crushing on Sam.this was so not good. Now she really felt like going
out and slaying, which brought up the previous problem."Nadia?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what the G-man told you `bout me and all but."</p>
<p>"You want to go out slaying tonight?" Faith's eyes felt like they
were going to pop out of their sockets, the G-man definitely told her
more than she thought he would. "Oh don't look at me like that. When
I was a watcher."</p>
<p>"Whoa you're a watcher?!"</p>
<p>"Was, I'm retired now, but Christina, she was my slayer, she would
start to go stir crazy before the sun was even down." Nadia smiled
fondly at Faith. "You remind me a lot of her actually."</p>
<p>"Is that why you said I could live here? `Cause I'm a slayer?"</p>
<p>"You needed a change, and I needed some company, it worked out best
for both of us I'd say. The basement would be a perfect place to set
up for a training area by the way." Nadia said as she got up and was
walking out of the kitchen, leaving a very stunned Faith
behind, "just be back by midnight, it's a school night." And with
that Nadia left the room.</p>
<p>Faith banged her head against the table again; this place was just
too strange.</p>
