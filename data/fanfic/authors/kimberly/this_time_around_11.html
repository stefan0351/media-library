<!-- This Time Around \ Part Eleven: Evil Partnerships -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Biology Class***</p>
<p>Sam stared ahead at Bio Glass with a statement of pure horror written
on her face. She knew the Bio Glass liked to torture the students,
but this was just plain ridiculous! Ok she had been partnered up
with Brooke before, she could handle that, even with this totally
messed up assignment, but Brooke and FAITH?! That was just pushing
the limits of what she could handle! Both Faith and Brooke seemed ok
with the pairing, if she didn't know better she would even think that
they were happy about it. HAPPY! There was no way she could survive
this, no way!</p>
<p>She walked out of Biology still in a daze, she couldn't believe
this. And things just got worse when both Faith and Brook walked up
to her after class. "Hey Sam, I think we should have Faith over
tonight for dinner or something and then we could work on this insane
project.what do you think?" Brooke asked, all cheerful like. It
made Sam sick. </p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"I've actually got stuff to do tonight, so can we do it early?"
Faith asked Brooke, since Sam seemed incapable of forming words at
the moment.</p>
<p>"Well I have cheerleading, but after that would be cool, so say
fourish?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good. See ya then." Faith answered and walked off, Brooke
walked off in the other direction, leaving Sam still standing there
in a stunned daze. There was no way she was going to be able to
handle this. Faith was going to be in HER house, where she ate,
slept, and did.other.things. Oh there was no way any kind of good
was coming out of this!</p>
