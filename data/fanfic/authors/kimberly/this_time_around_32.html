<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Two: The Morning After (Buffy and Brooke) -->

<p>***The Palace; Brooke's room***</p>

<p>"No.no more homework.evil Glass." Brooke mumbled in her sleep,
causing the body behind her to shake with laughter.  Buffy was
currently spooning Brooke from behind; listening to all the little
mumbles thinking that they were the cutest thing she had ever heard
in her life, and the little scowl Brooke wore just added to the
effect.  Buffy started making little circular motions around Brooke's
belly button, causing the sleeping girl to giggle, Buffy had to fight
hard not to erupt with laughter.  Adding nibbling of the ear to her
little motions on Brooke's stomach Buffy was having the time of her
life.</p>

<p>"Kill the frogs!"  Brooke grumbled in her sleep, Buffy couldn't fight
it any longer and she burst out laughing causing Brooke to wake
up.  "Hmm.what?  What's so funny?"  Brooke asked sleepily as she
rolled over and kissed the hollow of Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>"You talk in your sleep."  Buffy answered simply, still chuckling
slightly.  Brooke had a horrified look on her face as her sleep
fogged mind caught on to what Buffy was saying, she had no idea what
she said in her sleep, but the possibility that it was embarrassing,
if not incriminating, was colossal.</p>

<p>Giving the cutest little grimace Brooke asked, "what did I say?"</p>

<p>Buffy's hand started moving up and down Brooke's exposed thigh, and
went back to nibbling on her ear, in-between nibbles she
answered, "other than being an enemy to all frogs, you begged for no
more homework and accused glass of being evil."  Brooke smiled as she
registered what Buffy told her, Bio Glass's class always gave her
nightmares.  Thoroughly enjoying what Buffy was doing to her body
Brooke decided to join in on the fun and moved her thigh in-between
Buffy's, rubbing it against the shorter blonde's center.</p>

<p>Buffy moaned and slipped her hand over Brooke's ass.  Brooke waited
until just the right moment and jumped up out of the bed with a
mischievous smirk, leaving a very confused Buffy behind.  When she
was standing at the foot of the bed Brook announced, "race you to the
shower!"  And started running, Buffy right on her heals.</p>

<p>Unlocking the door Brooke rushed into the warm bathroom, Buffy caught
up to her just as she reached for the shower curtain and was sucking
on her neck as she pulled it
back, "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"  Buffy's head
snapped up and saw a horrified Sam, and a shocked Faith standing in
the shower.  Belatedly she realized the steam and heat in the
bathroom must have been cause they had just turned the shower off.</p>

<p>All four girls stood frozen just staring at each other horrified.
(Any onlookers would have laughed their asses off!)  Shaking her head
to clear her fuzzy mind Faith grabbed the curtain and slid it back
into place.  This seemed to knock everyone out of their stupors and
Brooke started furiously apologizing as she and Buffy rushed out of
the bathroom.  Sam rested her head in the crook of Faith's neck and
whispered, "tell me that just did not happen!"</p>

<p>"I think we should go back to your room now Samantha."  Faith said,
peeking out to make sure the bathroom was empty she pulled the
curtain back and stepped out, grabbing a towel for herself and Sam on
the way, they both rushed off to Sam's room and got dressed.</p>
