<!-- This Time Around \ Part Sixteen: Competition Of The Buffy Kind -->

<p>***Faith and Nadia's house; Faith's room***</p>
<p>That day at school had been thankfully uneventful. The only torture
they were made to endure was Bio Glass saying they were all going to
fail their projects, which is what Faith, Sam, and Brooke were
currently working on. The trio was sprawled out on Faith's floor
with books of all shapes and sizes surrounding them. Sam kept
peeking over her laptop thinking that Faith didn't notice. Faith in
fact had noticed, and she was currently deciding just what she should
do about it.that was teenage hormones right? She was doing her
homework damn it!</p>
<p>Faith was getting restless though. Looking outside she could see the
sun was almost down. It was time to go out and slay, and her blood
was already boiling in anticipation. Only two problems though:
Brooke and Sam. Neither looked like they were ready to leave anytime
soon. Faith almost jumped when she heard a knock downstairs,
followed by Nadia answering the door. And then there was silence.
Faith shrugged it off and went back to work (thinking about Sam).</p>
<p>Sam was currently thinking about Faith. And dream Faith. And her
hands. And her tongue. And.other yummy parts of her anatomy. Sam
peeked over the top of her laptop to look at Faith for like the
hundredth time. This time though Faith was already looking at her.
So they stared at each other. Sam could almost feel the heat coming
from the dark fire in Faith's eyes. The look was intoxicating. </p>
<p>Brooke, was blissfully unaware. She was in the world of homework and
didn't notice anything going on around her. Especially the HUGE
amount of sexual tension that had just settled itself in the room.
Nope, she didn't notice at all. She's blonde like that.</p>
<p>Sam and Faith still hadn't taken their eyes from each other when the
door opened, and who should walk in? Buffy Anne Summers. Faith
looked at her, blinked a few times, and then jumped up and hugged the
older slayer. "B.Jesus what are you doing her, you shoulda called or
somthin'." Faith's smile was blinding. Sam was suddenly starting to
feel sick.</p>
<p>"What and ruin the surprise? I think not." Buffy smiled at Faith
and hugged her again, and that's when she noticed the other two girls
in the room. "Hi." Buffy gave the two unknown girls her best `I'm
friendly' smile and a little wave.</p>
<p>"B this is Brooke and Sam. I'm.we're doing our homework." Faith
informed proudly, puffing her chest out just a bit. She was rewarded
with another of those smiles that B had just for her. A red head and
a blonde head poked into the room. "Red, T, s'up?"</p>
<p>"Giles and Nadia were starting to scare us, she called him young
Rupert." Willow shivered to emphasize her point, and Tara nodded in
absolute agreement.</p>
<p>Faith grinned, "just wait until she's calling you deary, now that's a
trip. Oh, Red, T these are my friends Sam and Brooke." Faith
introduced everyone and an uncomfortable silence enveloped the room.
Faith put her arms around Buffy's shoulders. Now Sam was definitely
feeling sick. "So B who else ya bring with ya?"</p>
<p>"Just the four of us.we ah.need to talk to you." Buffy said, trying
not to be too obvious that the other two in the room that didn't know
about slayers and such should leave.</p>
<p>Faith furrowed her brow, "no good conversation ever came from those
words B." Buffy just smiled again, which in turn made Faith smile.
Sam jumped up and ran to the bathroom, throwing up the meager
contents of her stomach. Brooke and Faith watched after her
worriedly.</p>
<p>"Um.maybe I should go check on her." Brooke mumbled as she got up
and went after Sam. By time she got there Sam was at the sink
cleaning off her face with some cool water. "Sammy?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, can you not ask questions and just take me home?" Sam
asked. Brooke noticed the tears in Sam's soft brown eyes and nodded
her head quietly. She walked back into the main room and started
collecting her and Sam's things. "Sammy's coming down with the flu
or something so I'm just gonna take he home. We can finish our
project tomorrow or something, ok? Oh it was nice to meet all of
you." Brooke babble out as she grabbed up everything, and then stood
there awkwardly as she waited for Sam to come out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>When Sam finally came out, her legs were still a little shaky. She
faltered and before she knew it Faith was there, holding her up. She
had never seen anyone move so fast. She stood there staring into
those captivating eyes, again mesmerized by them. "Thanks."</p>
<p>"Are you ok?" Faith asked, searching her face for the answer. She
noticed the tears in Sam's eyes, and mistook them as pain.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Brooke is gonna take me home.and bye." Sam grabbed Brooke's
hand and drug the taller girl out of the room and out of her house.
Faith stood there, blinking a few time trying to figure out what had
just happened.</p>
<p>Tara broke her out of her reverie when she said, "I hope your friend
is gonna be ok, she didn't look too good." Faith looked over at Tara
and nodded wordlessly.</p>
