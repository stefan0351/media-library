<chapter title="Part One: Goodbye Hell">
<p>***Sunnydale***</p>
<p>"Are you sure you have to go?" Buffy asked as Faith threw the last
of her stuff into the saddlebag on her motorcycle.</p>
<p>"Yup." Faith answered plainly, not even bothering to turn around and
look at the love of her life. She knew Buffy wanted her to stay, so
they could be friends again. But that just wasn't enough for her;
she had tried that the first time around, and look where it got her.
Nope, Faith had to have Buffy's love, or nothing at all. And as much
as it hurt to leave, she knew in the long run it would be best for
all of them.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna miss you.we just got you back and now you're leaving
again." Buffy pouted. She really didn't want Faith to leave again.
She wanted her to stay, they were the chosen two, and damn it, it was
hard being part of the chosen two when half of it was in some other
city.</p>
<p>"Here." Tara said quietly as she handed Faith a bag with sodas and
snacks for her journey.</p>
<p>"Thanks T." Faith nodded to the blonde Wiccan, and her red haired
lover who had just walked up.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Willow asked as she grabbed Tara's hand,
after everything that had happened, she didn't know whether to be sad
that Faith was leaving or jump for joy. She settled for honest
curiosity.</p>
<p>"G-man set my up at some school called Kennedy. Gonna go there, see
what all the fuss is about. You know they're supposed to be the best
years of you life or some shit like that."</p>
<p>"Ours weren't." Willow grumbled under her breath, but thanks to
slayer hearing both Buffy and Faith caught it.</p>
<p>Faith cringed inside, so there was definitely more than one reason
why she was leaving. Red didn't really want her here, even if she
did save her life, and her girlfriend's life, and Tara always agreed
with Willow, whether or not she really agreed with her. Xander
didn't want her here, hell she saved his and Anya's lives too. Giles
was indifferent, leaving it up to Buffy, who even now pouted at her.
Dawn could care less. Spike, shit she didn't care what Spike wanted,
she's stay just to drive him nuts. But in the end it came down to
the advice, that of all people, Queen C gave her. She was doing what
would be best for her. She really needed a clean start, where she
wasn't known as a murderer. And hell Red was all too happy to hop on
a computer and falsify some records so she could enroll.</p>
<p>Not being one for long goodbyes, this one had already taken too long;
Faith hopped on her bike, put on her helmet, and waved. Then she was
gone. Willow and Tara stood there for a second and then went back
into the Magic Box. Buffy stood there till she could no long see
Faith, even with slayer seeing. Faith was really gone, and she
didn't think that the other half of the chosen two was coming back
this time. Sighing she went back into the shop, she felt like
hitting something, a punching bag would have to do.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Two: Hello Heaven">
<p>***Insert City Name***</p>
<p>Faith stopped her bike in front of a nice two-story house. She
checked the piece of paper where the G-man had written the address of
where she was to stay again. "Musta wrote it wrong." Faith mumbled
to herself, then she noticed a little old lady walking out of the
house and towards her. "Great two minutes here and I'm gonna get the
cops called on me."</p>
<p>"Faith?" The little old lady asked.</p>
<p>"Yup. and you are?" </p>
<p>"You can call me Nadia, welcome." The little old lady, Nadia,
motioned to the large house and Faith couldn't help but stare, this
place was as big as the whole motel she stayed at when in Sunnydale,
and a hell of a lot nicer too! Nadia grabbed Faith's had and drug
the stunned girl into the house. "Now it's just going to be me and
you here dear. So I'll expect you to help out around the house, you
know clean up after yourself." Nadia raddled on as she walked Faith
through the living room. "This is the family room, over there is the
kitchen, on the other side of that is the laundry room. Um that
there is my room, and up those stairs is your room and the guest
rooms. Your room has a bathroom in it so it shouldn't be hard to
find. Oh sorry dear, I hope you don't mind me not showing up myself,
bad knees, that's why I have a room on the first floor."</p>
<p>"No.ah no prob, I'll find it." Faith disentangled herself from
Nadia, `strong little ol' lady.' She walked up the stairs and
started looking in rooms. Only one of them had a bathroom in it, and
from the looks, it was the master bedroom. "Cool." Faith threw her
saddlebag down and flopped down on the bed. "Well this ain't so
bad." Faith reached her arms back to stretch when they encountered
paper. She leaned up and grabbed the envelope addressed to her.
Opening it she found that it was her new records, class schedule, and
other things she'd need for school. Looking at the post-it note she
frowned. "I ain't even got there yet and I got a meeting with the
principal." Frowning she shoved the papers back in the envelope, it
was dinnertime, and she was hungry.</p>
<p>The next morning Faith was up at least an hour before she actually
had to be. And she found herself doing something she never thought
she'd do; she was standing in front of a closet (which had been
magically filled) and wondering what to wear. Whoever when shopping
for her did a good job. There were lots of black and other dark
colors. Lots of leather. And what wasn't leather, looked like it'd
be skintight. There were tank tops of various lengths and colors.
She had never had this many cloths before, and that was added up
through out her entire life! Finally she decided on black leather
pants, white baby tee, and her motorcycle boots, not to mention her
ever present leather jacket.</p>
<p>Faith bounded down the stairs, careful to be quiet in case Nadia was
still asleep, and found her way into the kitchen. Nadia was sitting
there, paper in her hands, cup of coffee on the table in front of
her. On the stove sat some bacon, eggs, toast, and hash browns. On
the counter a glass pitcher of both milk and orange juice sat. When
Nadia heard Faith she put the paper down.</p>
<p>"Morning deary. I heard up there taking a shower so I went ahead and
made some breakfast for you. First day of school and all, thought
you might get hungry. Oh and there is some money for your lunch
sitting on the little table by the door, next to your house keys."
Faith could only stare in astonishment. She had never been treated
this well in her life, and she couldn't figure out why this lady
would want to take a piece of.well why she would want to take her in.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She grabbed a glass of juice and her plate and sat down at
the table. It didn't take her long to eat and when she was finished
she rinsed off her plate and put it in the dishwasher. She still had
plenty of time before she had to meet the principal, so she decided
she would ride around on her bike, see if she could find anything
interesting around the area. "Bye Nadia." Faith said, and
impulsively kissed the old woman on the cheek, then rushed out the
door.</p>
<p>Nadia stared at the retreating figure and then smiled, "yes deary I
think you're going to do just fine now." And then she went back to
her paper and coffee.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Three: Meeting Mr. Ditzy">
<p>***Kennedy High; Mr. Krupp's office***</p>
<p>When Faith finally got to the school and found a safe looking place
to park her bike it was about time to meet the principal. All she
had to do was find the office first. Looking around her at the
various other students she noticed that over half of them were blonde
girls, `great perfect place to forget about B.' Faith spotted a
friendly enough looking face and asked, "you know where Krupp's
office is?"</p>
<p>Carmen looked at the girl in front of her. She looked like she just
stepped off a movie set where she played the `bad girl'. Stunning
but scary looking. Since the girl was now staring at her like she
was mentally retarded she figured she should answer. "Oh.um.yeah."
She pointed in a direction, "that way.big sign, can't miss it."</p>
<p>Faith looked in the direction the mentally challenged girl
pointed. "Yeah thanks." Heading off she noticed that the girl ran
to a small group of people, and before she knew it she was being
pointed at. Now the reasons she quit school the first time all came
back to her. Sighing Faith opened the door to the office and walked
in, telling the secretary that she had an appointment and then
sitting down until she was called.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of just sitting there a cute guy walked out
of the office and waved for her to come in. Faith got up and walked
in, sitting down when the guy motioned for her to. "So Ms Spencer,
nice to meet you." Krupp said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, right, nice to meet you Mr. Krupp."</p>
<p>"Please call me Calvin."</p>
<p>Faith looked at the way to cheerful guy, "right, Calvin.why am I here
again?" She knew that not all new students had been called in. Idly
she wondered just what Red put in those files; maybe she should
actually read them when she got back to Nadia's house.</p>
<p>Calvin Krupp looked down at the file he had in front of him. "Well.I
thought since the school you attended in Boston was a small catholic
school, it would be nice to have someone show you around." </p>
<p>`Small catholic school, way to go Red.' "Really that's not necc."
Faith trailed off as a brunette head poked into office.</p>
<p>"You wanted to see me?" Sam asked a little fearful. It was the
first day of school; she knew she hadn't done anything in the ten
whole minutes she had been here, at least she didn't think she had.
Then she noticed the girl sitting at the desk, "oh I'm sorry I didn't
know anyone was in here with you, they told me to come on in." Sam
said pointing an accusing finger at the secretaries. </p>
<p>"No, no please come in. Sam McPherson meet Faith Spencer. You're
going to be her tour guide for a few days, till she gets the layout
of the school and all." </p>
<p>Sam sighed, the last thing she wanted to do was play tour guide to
some new kid, but she didn't want to be on the bad side of the
principal either. So grudgingly she said, "fine." And motioned for
Faith to follow her out.</p>
<p>"Have a nice day ladies." Krupp said cheerfully.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Four: Fresh Meat">
<p>***Kennedy High School***</p>
<p>Nicole watched the new students flock together, there were three of
them standing there, but there should be four. She narrowed her
eyes, one was missing. She didn't like new students, always going
where they weren't supposed to, talking above their status. No she
didn't like them at all! But every year on the first day, more
showed up. "Hey Nic." Nicole turned her head and saw her best
friend walking towards her.</p>
<p>"Brookie." Nicole greeted flatly, she was still trying to figure out
where the other new kid was.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Brook asked concerned. She looked over where Nicole
was staring. "New students?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Nicole ground out through clenched teeth. "One of `em is
missing though."</p>
<p>"Nicole.at least give them till lunch before you attack." Brook said
with a smirk. One that was matched on Nicole's face.</p>
<p>"First lunch, second lunch, or third lunch?" Nicole asked finally
taking her eyes off the new students and looking at her friend. As
the queen of Kennedy High should, Brook looked flawless. `This was
going to be a good year'. And then Mary Cherry showed up and she
decided she should rethink that last thought.</p>
<p>"Hi ya'll. Ya'll never gonna believe what ah just heard from a very
knowledgeable source." Nicole's ears pricked up at the sound of new
gossip, and Brook just sighed. "Your little step sistah to be Sammy
McDorkson is gonna be chaperoning Kenney's newest little delinquent."</p>
<p>Nicole raised an eyebrow, she just figured out where the new kid was;
it also explained where Spam was. This was just too good. Krupp had
actually come through for her. The editor of the school newspaper
(and her mortal enemy) was going to be kept very busy being a tour
guide. That meant that at least for a little while the school paper
wouldn't be saying bad things about the Glamazons! "Goodie." She
said sarcastically, couldn't let Mary Cherry think she did something
good after all.</p>
<p>"Delinquent?" Brook asked. She didn't want Sam to be stuck with
some psycho, they were actually getting along, becoming friends even,
and she wouldn't wish that on her soon to sister.</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am ah heard she is crazy, and wouldn't think it unbelievable
if she'd killed someone. She looks like pure evil ya'll." Mary
Cherry stated in her gravest of tones.</p>
<p>"You've seen her?" Nicole asked, better to know now how bad she
looked, easier to come up with nasty things to say.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry hung her head, "sorry to report to ya'll ah have not seen
her with mah own two eyes yet."</p>
<p>"Well then I guess we'll just have to wait." Nicole said, heading
into the Novak to check her make-up, after all it had been a whole
ten minutes since she checked last.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Five: When's Lunch Again?">
<p>***Kennedy High; hallway***</p>
<p>"So.where ya from?" Sam asked curiously. They had been out of the
office for about five minutes and Faith hadn't said a word. The
journalist in her was just dieing to know everything, all the facts.</p>
<p>"Boston." Faith answered simply. Smirking some when Sam heaved an
aggravated sigh.</p>
<p>"Ok.what brings you here?"</p>
<p>"My Harley."</p>
<p>Sam's brow scrunched up some. Getting answers from this girl was
worse than getting teeth pulled. And then, thankfully, she noticed
Carmen, Lily, Josh, Harrison, and Sugar Daddy standing not to far
away. "Hey look some of my friends are over there." Sam started
walking over to them, not really caring if Faith was still following
her or not. "Hey guys, what's up?"</p>
<p>"Damn where'd a fine piece of woman like you come from yo?" Sugar
asked as soon as Sam and the girl with her arrived by them.</p>
<p>Faith's eyebrow rose, and she smirked, why not have a little fun.
She walked, swaggered really, her hips moving way more than they
needed to, right up to the big guy who had addressed her. She also
noticed that all the guys there were practically drooling. "Piece of
woman like me?" Faith asked innocently.</p>
<p>Sugar was suddenly imagining her holding an apple out for him, with a
big snake around her shoulders. Shaking his head he answered, "yeah,
you're supper hot yo."</p>
<p>"Supper hot eh? Well." Faith trailed off so that he could supply
his name.</p>
<p>"My peeps call me Sugar Daddy." A fine sweat broke out on Sugar's
face, and he wiped at it.</p>
<p>"I'm sure they do.Sugar." Faith walked so close up to him so that he
was now pressed against the lockers, but never actually touched
him. "That's a nice jersey ya got there." Faith said, flicking off
some imaginary flint, "play?" Sugar only nodded his head. "Big bad
football player eh? Well Mr. Daddy," Faith stared him right in the
eyes, "nest time you talk to me like that, I'm gonna turn you into a
cheerleader, got me?" Faith tone was dangerous, and Sugar only
nodded again. As soon as Faith backed up Sugar ran away without
saying anything. Faith just smirked.</p>
<p>"And this is Faith." Sam said to her gawking friends.</p>
<p>"That was wow!" Lily stated excitedly. "Everyone woman should be
able to do that when men get oppressing."</p>
<p>"This is Lily, Carmen, Josh, and Harrison." Sam finished the
introductions.</p>
<p>"S'up." Was Faith's greeting. </p>
<p>"So.I guess you found the office then." Carmen said just so that
something was said, she didn't want it to fall into one of those
obnoxious uncomfortable silences, she hated those.</p>
<p>"Yup." Everyone stared at Faith waiting for her to say more, when
she didn't Sam sighed again; this was going to be a long week.</p>
<p>"Well we better get going, don't want to be late or there's not
tellin' what Bio Glass will do." Everyone nodded, with the exception
of Faith, and started heading off to their classes.</p>
<p>"Bio Glass?" Faith asked her first question just before they entered
the biology room.</p>
<p>"Well we don't know if it's male or female, so we just call it Bio
Glass." Sam explained distractedly, she was worrying about what they
would be subjected to this year. They entered the classroom, and
since it was the first day, sat where they wanted. And then Bio
Glass came in, just as the bell rang, and Faith understood why Sam
had said `it'.</p>
<p>"All right kiddies get settled and get out your notebooks to take
notes on your brand new homework project." Bio Glass announced, and
then started on role. Most of the names were recognized as people
who had taken the class last year. When `it' got to Spencer,
Faith `it' spoke up. "My, my looks like we got ourselves a new one.
Spencer, Faith."</p>
<p>"Here." Faith answered appropriately, she was still trying to figure
out not only what `it' was, but how `it' could give homework on the
first day, it was just wrong.</p>
<p>Bio Glass got a glint in `it's' eye and then said, "oh, please stand,
tell us about yourself." All eyes turned to Faith. Sam was secretly
glad, now she got to find out some more about the mystery girl.
Among the faces now staring at her Faith recognized just about
everyone she had been introduced to this morning.</p>
<p>"Hmm.'bout me eh? Names Faith.from Boston.when I ain't here, I'm on
my Harley." Faith smirked when she heard Sam give her another
aggravated sigh; it was starting to become fun aggravating her tour
guide.</p>
<p>Bio Glass didn't look too happy with the
information `itself'. "Sit!" `It' barked out, and then proceeded to
tell them about their project.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Six: The Blonde Bomb Squad">
<p>***Kennedy High; Cafeteria***</p>
<p>Sam led Faith to the table she and her friends sat at everyday, every
year. It may sound redundant to others, but it was their table, some
sort of control in a place where no control was to be had. "So,
how's the day going so far Faith?" Lily asked as soon as the two
brunettes were sitting down.</p>
<p>"Well just call me chop liver." Sam grumbled under her breath,
completely unaware that with her slayer hearing Faith had heard her.</p>
<p>"I've been through worse.not much worse, but worse." Faith smirked
and leaned over so that she was right next to Sam's ear, "chop
liver." Surprised, not only that Faith was whispering in her ear,
but that the other brunette had heard her, Sam swung her head around,
and came nose to nose with one Faith Spencer.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Sam managed to squeak out, being this close to Faith was
doing something funny to her. Her normally dizzying vocabulary, her
one weapon in a fight, was knocked down to the vocab of a six year
old. She couldn't think of one witty think to say. Not to mention
her heart suddenly decided to vacate the premises and was trying to
beat out of her chest.</p>
<p>Faith was about to respond, repeat really, when three blonds strolled
up like the owned the place, little did she know, they did.</p>
<p>"Oh lookey ah think we have found the lost new kihd." Marry Cherry
said excitedly. Almost going as far as clapping her hands together.
Sam had never been so happy to see Brook and cronies as she was right
now.</p>
<p>"Why I think you're right Mary Cherry. So new kid." Nicole took a
look over Faith's attire, and smirked. "we have a few things to get
straight with you. First." Nicole trailed off as Faith stood and
looked down on her.</p>
<p>"Let me guess.this is your school. You don't like me. Um.oh yeah
there's a list of places I'm not to be seen.Am I right?" Faith
asked, all honest curiosity. It completely threw Nicole, Mary
Cherry, and even Brook for a loop. She had never seen anyone talk to
Nicole like that and live long. "Listen Twinkie, I don't care about
your stupid little rules you probably spent years coming up with.
I'm here `cause I want to be, and you," Faith poked Nicole in the
chest, "ain't gonna do nothin' to ruin it for me." And with that
Faith sat down, seven very stunned faces stared at her.</p>
<p>Nicole opened her mouth to say somethin, closed it, opened it again,
and then stormed off, Mary Cherry hot on her heels. "Welcome to
Kennedy High." Brook said with a smirk of her own as she went after
Nicole to make sure she wasn't planning something that involved death.
or mayhem, that was bad too.</p>
<p>"Your like.like.I don't know but it's supper cool!" Lily gushed; she
was coming down with a bad case of hero worship.</p>
<p>"Riiiiggghhhttt.so who was that?" Faith asked pointing behind her
where the threesome had left.</p>
<p>"The last one to leave was Brook, my soon to be stepsister.the one
who you pissed off was Nicole aka Satan, good job by the way.oh and
the first one to talk, that was Mary Cherry, Satan's shadow." Sam
explained, now that Faith wasn't so close to her it was becoming
easier to function.</p>
<p>"Wow, never though I'd meet someone worse than Queen C." Faith mused
to out loud to herself.</p>
<p>"Queen C?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"Head cheerleader, and prom queen of ah.my last school. She ain't so
bad anymore though." Faith answered, her mind traveling back to when
she first met the Scooby gang, Cordelia had been the first one to
insult her, well to her face anyway. She respected that. But this
Satan person, seriously had to be put in her place, and she was going
to have fun doing it.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Seven: Saved By The Bell">
<p>***Kennedy High; Track***</p>
<p>Faith and Sam were quietly walking around the track. It seemed to
Sam that everything she did so far with Faith was done quietly, Faith
never talked unless someone asked her a question, and then she
answered with the least amount of words possible. At least gym was
the last class of the day and she could go home and forget about
Faith for a while. Sam was knocked out of her reverie when Brook
walked up next to her. "Hey Sam."</p>
<p>"Brooke." Sam replied flatly. Noticing with a little dismay that
Faith was looking Brooke over, `is she checking her out? Nah.'</p>
<p>"Hi, not sure we met, I'm Faith." Faith said to Brooke. She
couldn't help but notice that she had a lot in common with B.</p>
<p>"Right.new kid.wants to be here." Brooke responded with a smirk. "I
don't think I've ever seen Nicole turn that color before, it was.
interesting." </p>
<p>Faith snorted, "please, that whole intimidation crap she does only
works on people who care what others think of them." Faith
responded, out of the corner of her eye she could see that Sam was
turning an interesting color herself. Was that steam coming out of
her ears?</p>
<p>"And you don't? Care what others think I mean." Brooke asked, not
even noticing that she was now standing in front of Sam, pushing her
out of the way in order to talk to Faith. Sam noticed though, and
oooh was she pissed, Faith noticed to, and it just made her smirk,
she seemed to do that a lot around the girl.</p>
<p>"Naw. To much energy to care `bout shit like that." Brooke nodded
her head, apparently accepting that answer, Faith definitely didn't
look like someone who would care what others thought. "Coming?"
Faith asked as she noticed that Sam had just stopped walking
altogether. "Wouldn't want to loose my tour guide, might get a
little lost." Faith said playfully, trying to get some of the anger
out of the other girl, although she kind of like the fire she saw
when Sam was angry.</p>
<p>Before Sam could answer, and oooh she had good retort just on the tip
of her tongue, the bell rang. "Hey the bell, time to go home, bye."
And with that Sam got as far away from Faith as she could. She was
in need of a cold shower. Whether or not that was from how angry she
had gotten, or that fact that her temperature always went up when
Faith looked at her so intently as she did when asking a question,
she didn't know. Either way she really needed a cold shower.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Eight: You're a what?!">
<p>***Nadia's House***</p>
<p>When Faith got home from school that day she couldn't wait to go out
and slay. She needed to find a short, blonde, female vampire with
spiky hair. Sam had called Nicole Satan, from what she heard from
others it seemed to fit, idly she wondered if she was a demon, then
she could slay her, that would be fun. All the thoughts of slaying
thought brought up the question of what she would tell Nadia. The
woman had welcomed her into her home, and she didn't want to lie to
her. Plus from what B told her, Mrs. S didn't take it so well when
she found out about slayers and shit.</p>
<p>She didn't know how much G-man had told Nad either. It would be
easier if she knew that, maybe it would be a good idea to call and
ask. Before she could get to a phone thought Nadia showed up in
front of her. "How was school deary?"</p>
<p>"Interesting."</p>
<p>"Well that's good, the more interesting it is, the more likely you'll
want to go back. So did you make an new little friends?" Nadia
asked as she led Faith into the kitchen and sat her down at the
table, putting a glass of milk and some cookies in front of her.</p>
<p>Smiling, a real, true smile, Faith answered, "yeah guess so.there's
this one chick Lily, I think I'm her new idol.this other chick Sam is
like my guide to the school, she's pretty cool." Faith trailed off
and munched on a cookie thoughtfully, Nadia just waited patiently for
her to continue. "I mean she's not like anyone else I've ever met.
smart.got one wicked tongue too.I think I aggravate her though."</p>
<p>"Hmmm.sounds like a nice girl."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Faith looked down at her now empty glass of milk. She hated
milk and she had just drank a whole glass of it, without even
thinking about it! Well maybe that's `cause she was thinking about
Sam. Faith let her head fall forward and hit the table, she was
crushing on Sam.this was so not good. Now she really felt like going
out and slaying, which brought up the previous problem."Nadia?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what the G-man told you `bout me and all but."</p>
<p>"You want to go out slaying tonight?" Faith's eyes felt like they
were going to pop out of their sockets, the G-man definitely told her
more than she thought he would. "Oh don't look at me like that. When
I was a watcher."</p>
<p>"Whoa you're a watcher?!"</p>
<p>"Was, I'm retired now, but Christina, she was my slayer, she would
start to go stir crazy before the sun was even down." Nadia smiled
fondly at Faith. "You remind me a lot of her actually."</p>
<p>"Is that why you said I could live here? `Cause I'm a slayer?"</p>
<p>"You needed a change, and I needed some company, it worked out best
for both of us I'd say. The basement would be a perfect place to set
up for a training area by the way." Nadia said as she got up and was
walking out of the kitchen, leaving a very stunned Faith
behind, "just be back by midnight, it's a school night." And with
that Nadia left the room.</p>
<p>Faith banged her head against the table again; this place was just
too strange.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Nine: Dreaming of Angels in Leather">
<p>***The Palace (Sam and Brook's house)***</p>
<p>Sam's arm flew out from underneath the covers and slapped the
offending chirping item. The alarm clock shut up and the room was
back to the peaceful silence that had surrounded it before. Throwing
the covers off she got up to go about her morning routine. With the
addition of a cold shower. The one she had taken after gym the day
before had helped, she went home and didn't think of the dark goddess
for rest of the evening. But then night came, and she went to sleep,
allowing her subconscious to take over, and it wasn't even close to
being done thinking about Faith.</p>
<p>She couldn't figure out what it was about Faith that was drawing her
in. She had never, ever thought of herself as gay, and now here she
was, practically drooling over this new girl. And dreaming about her
too. Sam closed her eyes and let her mind drift back to the dream.
It was all dark and mysterious, just like Faith. They were somewhere
Sam didn't think she had ever been, a club or something, and she was
just sitting there when Faith came in. Without saying a word Faith
walked up to her, took her hand, and led her out to the dance floor.
Their bodies ground into each other erotically along with the beat of
the song playing. Faith was behind her, Faith's arm around her waist
holding her closer, her other arm linked with Sam's around her neck,
holding Sam's hand in place. </p>
<p>And they danced, without a care in the world. She wasn't thinking
about who was watching her, what people were thinking about her, she
just wanted, needed the contact Faith so willing gave her. It was
like nothing she had ever felt before. She felt so safe in Faith's
arms. Of course, she reminded herself, it was just a dream, and
dreams don't always come true. Sam finished up her cold shower and
headed downstairs for breakfast, this was going to be a long day.</p>

<chapter title="Part Ten: Mission `Destroy Faith'">
<p>***Kennedy High; Novak***</p>
<p>Mary Cherry sat on the plush couch in the Novak and watched Nicole
pace back and forth. They were here, early, to come up with some way
to get that new girl Faith back for embarrassing Nicole. No one
embarrassed Nicole, at least no one who lived long afterward. "So,
what are we gonna do?"</p>
<p>Nicole stopped pacing and stared at Mary Cherry. "Past."</p>
<p>Merry Cherry looked confused, ok she always looked confused but now
she looked more so than usually. "Past? Nicole what are yah
talkin' `bout?"</p>
<p>"Everyone has a hidden past. They hide it and hope no one finds it,
all we have to is find hers and she's history." Nicole said with an
unearthly glow in her eyes, had Faith seen it she definitely swear
Nicole was a demon.</p>
<p>Marry Cherry clapped her hands together like a deranged little
kid, "oooh that is brilliant, now how do we go about finding this
dark hidden past?"</p>
<p>Now Nicole added an evil smile, "leave that to me." And so
mission `destroy Faith' was about to begin, taking out everyone who
got in the way.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Eleven: Evil Partnerships">
<p>***Kennedy High; Biology Class***</p>
<p>Sam stared ahead at Bio Glass with a statement of pure horror written
on her face. She knew the Bio Glass liked to torture the students,
but this was just plain ridiculous! Ok she had been partnered up
with Brooke before, she could handle that, even with this totally
messed up assignment, but Brooke and FAITH?! That was just pushing
the limits of what she could handle! Both Faith and Brooke seemed ok
with the pairing, if she didn't know better she would even think that
they were happy about it. HAPPY! There was no way she could survive
this, no way!</p>
<p>She walked out of Biology still in a daze, she couldn't believe
this. And things just got worse when both Faith and Brook walked up
to her after class. "Hey Sam, I think we should have Faith over
tonight for dinner or something and then we could work on this insane
project.what do you think?" Brooke asked, all cheerful like. It
made Sam sick. </p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"I've actually got stuff to do tonight, so can we do it early?"
Faith asked Brooke, since Sam seemed incapable of forming words at
the moment.</p>
<p>"Well I have cheerleading, but after that would be cool, so say
fourish?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good. See ya then." Faith answered and walked off, Brooke
walked off in the other direction, leaving Sam still standing there
in a stunned daze. There was no way she was going to be able to
handle this. Faith was going to be in HER house, where she ate,
slept, and did.other.things. Oh there was no way any kind of good
was coming out of this!</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twelve: A Plan In Motion">
<p>***Kennedy High; Novak***</p>
<p>Nicole sat down on the couch in the Novak and dialed a number from
memory on her cell phone. It was the number she called anytime she
needed life destroying information. And she was definitely going to
be destroying Faith's life, one way or another. When the other line
clicked Nicole said simply, "Faith Spencer, Kenney High." And hung
up. Everything would be taken care of for her, and anything in
Faith's past or even present would be brought to the light of day.
And Nicole knew, just knew, that someone like Faith would have
something she was hiding.</p>
<p>Checking her make-up in the mirror she was about to leave when the
object of her deepest hatred, ok it was tied now, walked in. Sam
walked in and sat down, still stunned. "What's with you Spam,
recently discover you're the worlds worst journalist, sorry sweetie
the rest of us already knew that." Nicole got all ready for the
witty come back she knew would come her way; already have a deflector
in mind. But, much to her disappointment, it never came. Sam just
sat there, staring off into space. "Spamy the luncheon meat?"
Nicole asked waving her hand in front of Sam's face.</p>
<p>Suddenly breaking out of whatever haze she was in Sam said, "what did
I do to deserve this? God must hate me." Nicole was so completely
taken back by what Sam said she didn't know how to respond. "I'm
doomed." Sam put her head in her hands and sighed, she hadn't
actually realized it was Satan with her, if she had, she probably
wouldn't have let her little confession (what she actually confessed)
out. As it were though she just sat there, head in hands, sighing.</p>
<p>Nicole finally snapped out of it and replied, "of course God hates
you, she hates all fashion victims. Which should put you at the top
of her hit list." Again Nicole expected a comeback, which never came.</p>
<p>Sam raised her head and asked, "you really think God is a she?"</p>
<p>Now Nicole was convinced something was actually wrong with Spamy.
Two whole minutes in each other's presence and she hadn't said
anything hateful. It was just wrong. That was how it was done,
Nicole said something mean, and Sam had a witty comeback, which Sam
reversed so that is made Nicole sound bad. That's how it had always
been, and damn it she couldn't go and change things now, it wasn't
fair.</p>
<p>"What did a dog eat your latest article or something?" Nicole asked
as though she really didn't care, she had to fix Spam or all the fun
would be taken out of her day, it just wasn't complete without a
verbal sparring match, and Spam was the only one who was even close
to her level in that area.</p>
<p>"Bio Glass." Sam responded as if that explained everything. Nicole
thought back to that particular class. She had been paired with Mary
Cherry, who right now was somewhere paying someone to do the
assignment for them. The newest sadistic project to come out of Bio
Glass's mind was something to do with teenage hormones. No big deal.</p>
<p>"Who's your partner, April Tuna?" Being paired with the lowest of
the low on the social ladder would explain someone acting like this,
or so Nicole reasoned.</p>
<p>"Brooke and Faith." Sam said with a moan like quality in her voice.
Nicole sighed, no problem there, Spam had been paired with the queen
of Kennedy High, even if the queen of Skank was thrown in there, she
should be happy, again that's how Nicole figured it. Finally tiring
of trying to fix the hopeless Nicole walked out of the Novak to find
some other loser to insult, leaving Sam all by herself.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Thirteen: Hell, Swallow Me Up Now!">
<p>***The Palace***</p>
<p>Faith had called Nadia right after school to let her know that she
would be home real late due to working with some people on a school
project. Of course Nadia told her to take her time, schoolwork was
important. It was still kinda weird, Faith thought, to have someone
to report back to. Not like reporting to a watcher, but a parent
like person. Her parents hadn't cared what she did, probably why she
got into so much trouble when she was little. But it was a nice
strange all the same. </p>
<p>Since Sam had disappeared right after school, giving neither Brooke
nor Faith a chance to talk to her, Faith had to follow Brooke to
their house. Which to Faith looked more like a mansion than a
house. Faith parked her bike on the edge of the drive way and
followed Brooke up to and in to the house. Mike and Jane were both
sitting in the kitchen When Brooke and Faith entered to get a snack
for the study session. Brooke took the opportunity to inquire as to
Sam's whereabouts and introduce Faith. "Dad Mom, this is Faith,
she's new to Kennedy and got stuck with Sam and I on a project,
speaking of Ms Houdini seen her?"</p>
<p>"Hello Faith.Sam came flying in the door about an hour ago muttering
something about needed to clean." Jane answered while shaking
Faith's hand. Thinking to herself that Sam and Brooke occupied
themselves with the widest assortment of people she had ever seen.</p>
<p>"Hello Faith, where are you from?" Mike asked, also standing to
shake the girl's hand.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet cha, and I'm originally from Boston." Faith answered,
and was extremely thankful when Brooke pressed a bottle of water into
her hand and then dragged her out of the room. She was never good
with parents, mostly they thought she was a bad influence, and the
fact she never had any she cared to think of as parents, just made
her uncomfortable when meeting them. So normally she steered clear.</p>
<p>Brooke led Faith up the stairs and stopped when she got to Sam's
room, not bothering to knock she opened the door and she and Faith
walked in. They were greeted with a sheirk as Sam noticed their
entry, she was clad in only her pants a scarcely there bra, since she
had decided to change her shirt. She dived into the bathroom and
locked the door before anyone could say anything. Brooke tilted her
head curiously, it wasn't like she had never seen Sam in her bra
before, they were almost sisters, and had had gym together. And she
was sure Faith knew what a girl looked like without a shirt present,
being a girl and all.</p>
<p>"Well that was fun." Faith said smirking.</p>
<p>Brooke smiled at her and motioned for Faith to get comfortable, which
she did, sprawling out on Sam's bed. And Brooke went to the door for
the bathroom and knocked, "um Sam? You ok?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Sam answered, although the squeak in her voice would suggest
otherwise. Finally, with a shirt on, Sam came out of the bathroom.
She was greeted with a smirking Faith, and a confused looking
Brooke. This was not good, not good at all! "Um.hi.welcome to my
room.I guess." Sam muttered to Faith, although she was studying her
shoes. The shy little display, unknowingly, endearing her to
Faith. Sam could look so cute when she was all shy and muttering
like.</p>
<p>"Nice spread." Faith commented, not mentioning the little incident,
which Sam was really, really grateful for. "We should get started,
sooner we're done.well it'll be the sooner were done." Faith said
grinning. She was already itching to go slaying, but at the same
time she was quite comfortable on Sam's bed, where Sam slept, and did.
other things.</p>
<p>"Right teenage hormones, this'll be fun." Brooke said
sarcastically. What with the whole Josh and Harrison things in her
life, she could do without teenage hormones. And so they got down to
work. Faith finding it easy to make Sam blush.which she ended up
doing almost all night.damn teenage hormones.</p>

<chapter title="Part Fourteen: Uh Oh With A Capitol Uh">
<p>***Sunnydale; Magic Box***</p>
<p>"Um.Buffy?" Willow asked as she walked into the slayer's work out
room in the back of the Magic Box.</p>
<p>"Yeah Wills?" Buffy inquired back as she punched the bag one more
time before giving her bestest best bud all of her attention.</p>
<p>"There's a slight problem with Faith." Willow answered.</p>
<p>"How slight?" Buffy asked getting worried. She knew how much Faith
had changed, but that didn't mean she wouldn't screw up again.</p>
<p>"Someone is looking into her records and her past and stuff.I don't
know how long my firewalls will hold them off. Who ever it is, is
pretty good with a keyboard. This is bad Buffy. They could find
anything out, how her records are fake, or that she was in jail, or
that she's the slayer.anything." Willow babbled on.</p>
<p>Buffy listened intently and then did something Willow really wasn't
expecting. The slayer smiled. Willow sighed; she knew she wasn't
going to like this, nope, not at all. "Road trip." Buffy said
happily. Yup, she knew it, didn't like it one bit.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Fifteen: Dreaming Of Leather Angels, Again">
<p>***The Palace; Sam's room***</p>
<p>Sam was dreaming was dreaming of Faith again. It wasn't a club this
time, and they weren't dancing. No this dream was weirder. They
were in a cemetery, just walking around. It was night and dream Sam
noticed how the moon's light made dream Faith even more beautiful,
enhancing her dark features. Still though, she couldn't figure out
why, or how even, they had ended up walking around in a cemetery. It
freaked her out, but at the same time she felt completely safe with
dream Faith by her side.</p>
<p>Hearing a noise she did a 360, but saw nothing. Her back was to
dream Faith, and dream Faith's strong arms wrapped around dream her's
midsection, holding her close. "Scared?" It was the first time
dream Faith had said anything. Her low tone, spoken so close to her
sensitive ear, sent shivers through her body. She didn't answer
though; instead she just leaned back and put her head on Faith's
shoulder, letting the just slightly taller girl support her weight.</p>
<p>She heard the noise again, but didn't even flinch, she felt to warm,
safe, to even begin to care. So when someone, or something jumped
out at them she was more than a little freaked. Faith took her arms
back and fought the creature, finally driving what looked like a
wooden stake into it's heart. The.thing.exploded into a cloud of
dust and dream Faith turned those oh so dark eyes on her. Dream
Faith held out her hand for dream Sam to take, and although she knew
she should be freaked a little more by what had just happened, she
took the hand, she would follow dream Faith, and the real one,
anywhere.</p>
<p>Anywhere just happened to be her bedroom. Dream her and Faith
climbed silently through the window and then just stood there in the
center of her floor, looking at each other. Dream Faith reached out
and pulled dream her close, pressing oh so soft lips to her own. The
room started to spin, her knees threatened to buckle. When dream
Faith's hand crept down her back to the top of her ass, her knees did
buckle, but just as she knew she would, dream Faith's arms caught
her. And the carried her over to the bed, laying her gently on top
of the soft covers.</p>
<p>Dream Faith lay so that she was half on and half off of dream Sam,
reclaiming her lips. Dream Faith's hands were roaming all over her
body, and she swore that she could really feel them on her body. And
then dream Faith.BUZZZZZ.Sam's arm shot out and smacked her alarm
clock.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!"</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Sixteen: Competition Of The Buffy Kind">
<p>***Faith and Nadia's house; Faith's room***</p>
<p>That day at school had been thankfully uneventful. The only torture
they were made to endure was Bio Glass saying they were all going to
fail their projects, which is what Faith, Sam, and Brooke were
currently working on. The trio was sprawled out on Faith's floor
with books of all shapes and sizes surrounding them. Sam kept
peeking over her laptop thinking that Faith didn't notice. Faith in
fact had noticed, and she was currently deciding just what she should
do about it.that was teenage hormones right? She was doing her
homework damn it!</p>
<p>Faith was getting restless though. Looking outside she could see the
sun was almost down. It was time to go out and slay, and her blood
was already boiling in anticipation. Only two problems though:
Brooke and Sam. Neither looked like they were ready to leave anytime
soon. Faith almost jumped when she heard a knock downstairs,
followed by Nadia answering the door. And then there was silence.
Faith shrugged it off and went back to work (thinking about Sam).</p>
<p>Sam was currently thinking about Faith. And dream Faith. And her
hands. And her tongue. And.other yummy parts of her anatomy. Sam
peeked over the top of her laptop to look at Faith for like the
hundredth time. This time though Faith was already looking at her.
So they stared at each other. Sam could almost feel the heat coming
from the dark fire in Faith's eyes. The look was intoxicating. </p>
<p>Brooke, was blissfully unaware. She was in the world of homework and
didn't notice anything going on around her. Especially the HUGE
amount of sexual tension that had just settled itself in the room.
Nope, she didn't notice at all. She's blonde like that.</p>
<p>Sam and Faith still hadn't taken their eyes from each other when the
door opened, and who should walk in? Buffy Anne Summers. Faith
looked at her, blinked a few times, and then jumped up and hugged the
older slayer. "B.Jesus what are you doing her, you shoulda called or
somthin'." Faith's smile was blinding. Sam was suddenly starting to
feel sick.</p>
<p>"What and ruin the surprise? I think not." Buffy smiled at Faith
and hugged her again, and that's when she noticed the other two girls
in the room. "Hi." Buffy gave the two unknown girls her best `I'm
friendly' smile and a little wave.</p>
<p>"B this is Brooke and Sam. I'm.we're doing our homework." Faith
informed proudly, puffing her chest out just a bit. She was rewarded
with another of those smiles that B had just for her. A red head and
a blonde head poked into the room. "Red, T, s'up?"</p>
<p>"Giles and Nadia were starting to scare us, she called him young
Rupert." Willow shivered to emphasize her point, and Tara nodded in
absolute agreement.</p>
<p>Faith grinned, "just wait until she's calling you deary, now that's a
trip. Oh, Red, T these are my friends Sam and Brooke." Faith
introduced everyone and an uncomfortable silence enveloped the room.
Faith put her arms around Buffy's shoulders. Now Sam was definitely
feeling sick. "So B who else ya bring with ya?"</p>
<p>"Just the four of us.we ah.need to talk to you." Buffy said, trying
not to be too obvious that the other two in the room that didn't know
about slayers and such should leave.</p>
<p>Faith furrowed her brow, "no good conversation ever came from those
words B." Buffy just smiled again, which in turn made Faith smile.
Sam jumped up and ran to the bathroom, throwing up the meager
contents of her stomach. Brooke and Faith watched after her
worriedly.</p>
<p>"Um.maybe I should go check on her." Brooke mumbled as she got up
and went after Sam. By time she got there Sam was at the sink
cleaning off her face with some cool water. "Sammy?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, can you not ask questions and just take me home?" Sam
asked. Brooke noticed the tears in Sam's soft brown eyes and nodded
her head quietly. She walked back into the main room and started
collecting her and Sam's things. "Sammy's coming down with the flu
or something so I'm just gonna take he home. We can finish our
project tomorrow or something, ok? Oh it was nice to meet all of
you." Brooke babble out as she grabbed up everything, and then stood
there awkwardly as she waited for Sam to come out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>When Sam finally came out, her legs were still a little shaky. She
faltered and before she knew it Faith was there, holding her up. She
had never seen anyone move so fast. She stood there staring into
those captivating eyes, again mesmerized by them. "Thanks."</p>
<p>"Are you ok?" Faith asked, searching her face for the answer. She
noticed the tears in Sam's eyes, and mistook them as pain.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Brooke is gonna take me home.and bye." Sam grabbed Brooke's
hand and drug the taller girl out of the room and out of her house.
Faith stood there, blinking a few time trying to figure out what had
just happened.</p>
<p>Tara broke her out of her reverie when she said, "I hope your friend
is gonna be ok, she didn't look too good." Faith looked over at Tara
and nodded wordlessly.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Seventeen: Some Late Night Sisterly Advice">
<p>***The Palace; Brooke's room***</p>
<p>Brooke awoke with a start. At first she couldn't tell what had woken
her up. But then she heard.ok she didn't know what she was hearing.
It almost sounded like someone in pain. Creeping out her of her bed
she stood in the middle of the room tying to discern where the sound
was coming from. Walking over to the door that led into the bathroom
the sound got louder. As she opened her door she saw that the other
door, the one leading to Sam's room was already opened. She walked
into Sam's room and saw her tossing and turning in bed, obviously in
the throws of a nightmare.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke shook the girl slightly. Sam's eyes opened wide and
she shot up in bed, a scream dying in her throat. She fell back onto
the bed and curled up into a tight little ball and started sobbing.
To say the least, Brooke was scared. She had never seen Sam like
this. The girl was terrified; Brooke had never even seen Sam scared,
more or less like this. "Sammy, what's wrong, talk to me?" Brooke
begged, trying to get Sam to uncurl herself.</p>
<p>"She wasn't there." Sam let out in a choked whisper. "She wasn't
there." She repeated throwing herself into a very surprised Brooke's
arms. </p>
<p>Brooke lay with her back leaning on the pillows; Sam curled up in her
arms, and let her finish crying before she gently asked. "Who,
Sammy, who wasn't there?" The question only served to make Sam cry
harder. Brooke started rocking the girl back and forth gently.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later Sam calmed down and explained to Brooke
everything that had been going on in her head lately. "I've been
dreaming about her.Faith. Last night I dreamed we were in a grave
yard, although I didn't know why. Something attacked us, but she
saved me, protected me, held me. I felt so safe in her arms Brooke,
I haven't felt that safe in someone's arms since my dad died. But
tonight.she wasn't there. I was so scared, and then.it.jumped out
again, just like last night. But she wasn't there." Sam was gently
sobbing into Brooke's shoulder, just repeating over and over
again, "she wasn't there." </p>
<p>Brooke's heart was breaking for her soon to be sister. She hadn't
even realized Sam like girls, and now she was being crushed by one,
who wasn't even doing it on purpose. "Sammy." Brooke waited till
Sam's head looked up at her before she continued, "you have to tell
her Sammy. You're falling in love with her, you have to tell her."</p>
<p>"I can't." Sam responded. Her tone of voice making Brooke's heart
break a little more for the girl, who was obviously in so much pain
right now. "She'll hate me."</p>
<p>Brooke allowed a smile to cross her face. "Some how I doubt that
Sammy. But the only way you'll ever find out is if you tell her. It
can't hurt any worse, right? If she hated you?"</p>
<p>Sam thought about it. Really thought about it. And the answer she
came up with was that nothing could hurt more than what it did now.
With a new resolve to tell Faith everything Sam fell asleep in her
sister's comforting arms. The wry question, "who woulda though?" on
her mind as she drifted off into a dreamless sleep.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Eighteen: Odd Slayer Out">
<p>***Cemetery***</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith were patrolling, just like the old days. Ok they
weren't on the hellmouth, but it was almost like the old days. They
had left Willow, Tara, and Giles back at the house with Nadia, who
was telling them some stories about her watcher days. Faith was
still a little worried about Sam though. She couldn't believe it she
was patrolling with B, who was currently holding her hand (this was
her dream) and she was thinking about Sam. As Queen C would
say, "confusing much?"</p>
<p>And she was, confused that is. She knew she loved B. Has since the
first time she saw her. Plus they had that added bonus of slayer
connection. But so much had happened in their past together. Faith
still had a hard time believe that B had completely forgiven her.
But she had. And now here they were, patrolling, holding hands, and
Faith didn't want to be there. She wanted to be at Sam's house,
making sure she was ok, taking care of her till she was. </p>
<p>Buffy noticed Faith's distraction and decided to break the silence
that had fallen. "I've missed you Faith."</p>
<p>Faith looked at Buffy. So many times she wanted to hear those words,
but now they didn't mean anything. "Why did you guys come?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked a little disappointed at Faith's response, but went on
nonplused, "someone was looking into your files and background and
stuff. Digging where they shouldn't. So we came out here for Willow
to up security so to speak. Wouldn't want anyone to find out who you
now would we." Buffy added playfully, trying to keep the mood light.</p>
<p>"Naw wouldn't want that," Faith muttered darkly </p>
<p>"Faith is there something wrong?" Buffy asked. She hadn't seen the
depressing, dark side of Faith for a long time, and it scared her
when it popped out.</p>
<p>"Why now B?! Why come here and be all buddy buddy with me now?! You
couldn't of done this shit back in SunnyD.when I wanted you to?!"</p>
<p>Buffy stepped back as if she had been hit. In no uncertain terms
Faith had just told her she didn't want her anymore. She had waited
to long, and now she had lost her. The thought made tears spring to
Buffy's eyes. "I'm sorry.I.I."</p>
<p>Faith's face softened from the hard mask it had fallen into. "Sorry
B.I didn't meant ta yell at ya.it's just.you know."</p>
<p>Buffy walked up to Faith and put her hand lightly on her
cheek. "Yeah, I know." Rising up on her tippy toes Buffy pressed a
light kiss of Faith's lips, and then turned and walked away. Faith
sat down heavily on the nearest tombstone. She had just turned down
BUFFY. B had kissed her and she turned her away.</p>
<p>"Must be either fuckin' insane, or in love." Faith muttered to
herself before she got up and headed for home. On the way she
decided (for her own peace of mind) that it was love, not insanity.
Now all she had to was tell Sam.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Nineteen: Novak Confessions">
<p>***Kennedy High***</p>
<p>Faith searched everywhere for Sam the next day at school. She knew
Sam was there somewhere, Brooke had told her as much. What she
didn't know was that currently Sam was looking everywhere for her.
So they played cat and mouse. Finally Faith took a side turn and
headed into the Novak. As soon was she walked in she saw Sam at the
mirror. Sam's eyes met her through the mirror and she smiled
faintly. "Hey Faith.I was looking for you."</p>
<p>"In the mirror? Funny place ta look." Faith said smirking. Sam
blushed a little, her smile growing.</p>
<p>"Yeah well I had to ask who was the best journalist of all.habit."
Sam replied, giving Faith one of her own smirks. Faith's smirk grew
into an all out smile.</p>
<p>"And what did it say?" Faith asked as she came up closer to Sam,
they were both now looking at each other in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Connie Chung, go figure." Sam said lightly. Faith burst out
laughing, and put her hands on Sam's hips to steady herself.
Everything in Sam's body shut down so that it could focus completely
and whole on where Faith's hands were currently located. Without
thought she leaned back into Faith, who accepted her weight
easily. "Faith."</p>
<p>"You know," Faith cut her off, "I noticed something the other day.
this really hot brunette kept sneakin' peaks at me. Now normally I
wouldn't think anything of it.except I kept sneakin' peaks too."</p>
<p>"Something should definitely be done about that." Sam said as she
closed her eyes, and let Faith's hot breath, oh so close to her ear,
sooth her, wash over her.</p>
<p>"You know, came to the same conclusion myself. Funny that." Faith
nuzzled Sam's neck with her nose, taking in her scent.</p>
<p>"And just what are you going to do?" Sam breathed out.</p>
<p>"Tell her how much I want her, need her, am falling in love with
her." Faith trailed off as she pulled Sam's lips to her own and
kissed her like it was the last chance she'd ever have to do so.</p>
<p>When the finally broke apart Sam smiled, a smile that lit up the
entire room, "and just what do you think SHE'll do when she hears
this admission?"</p>
<p>"Oh I've got a few ideas." Faith said and turned Sam so that her
back was to the mirror and kissed her again for all she was worth.
Sam put her arms around Faith's neck and deepened the kiss.</p>
<p>"Well, just so you know, she loves you too." Sam said smiling.
Faith gave her another quick kiss and led her out of the Novak, she
neither of them could suddenly wait till school was out!</p>
<p>Nicole stepped out of the stall she had been hiding in, "gotcha!"</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty: A New Found Love">
<p>***Park***</p>
<p>The day just flew by for Sam and Faith. They had decided to skip
rest of school and just be together, get to know everything about
each other, grope, you know what all new couples do. They left the
school on Faith's Harley, with Sam clutching to Faith for dear life,
and ended up at the city part, lounging underneath a big tree. Faith
was laid out on her back looking up at the clouds, head resting on
her hands, and Sam was resting her head on Faith's chest, her ear to
Faith's heart, so that she couldn't listen to the even rhythm.</p>
<p>"This is nice." Sam stated needlessly after a few moments of
silence. A comfortable silence at that. She decided she could die
right there and be a happy dead woman.</p>
<p>"Yup." Faith agreed. She couldn't remember a time that she had ever
been this happy. A rough childhood, followed closely by a rough
adolescence didn't add up too much happy time. But now, right now,
she was happy, content even. She wasn't restless waiting for night
(mental note: tell Sam about nightlife); she wasn't bouncing off the
walls (or trees as the case may be) waiting for something exciting to
do. Nope she was just restful. Comfortable. Content. And happy.
All things she couldn't ever remember being before, with anyone.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to work on that you know," Sam stated playfully.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Faith looked down at the dark head resting on her chest, and
the dark head turned to look back up at her.</p>
<p>"The length of your sentences of course. Can't have people thinking
I have all the brains in this relationship."</p>
<p>"Well I got all the beauty, it'd be only fair." Faith replied,
earning a pinch to her side. She just chuckled, earning her another
pinch. "Ah come on, the strong silent type works for me, don't wanna
give away the mystery for people do I?" Faith asked, hoping Sam
would stop pinching her, unless she wanted to pinch her.</p>
<p>"Oh no, you're right, wouldn't want that, oh the horror." Sam said
in mock, well in mock horror.</p>
<p>Faith just smirked at her girlfriend (oh that sounded nice, her
girlfriend) and then launched an all out tickle war. She turned and
pounced on top of Sam before she even knew what was happening. Sam
tried, she really did, to get away from Faith's tickling fingers, but
it was all in vain. Her girlfriend (sounds really nice don't it?)
was way stronger than she looked.</p>
<p>"Uncle! I give!" Sam cried out in defeat. Faith stopped tickling
and smiled down at Sam, smiled down, `cause she was now lying on top
of her. Faith leaned down and planted a soft kiss on Sam's lips.
Sam stared up into the most beautiful brown eyes she had ever seen
and felt her heart give itself away. She was Faith's now, completely
and wholly. "I love you."</p>
<p>Faith looked shocked at first by the soft exclamation, but the shock
melted away and was replaced by a look of love. "You're the first
person to ever say that to me ya know." Faith said softly, `causing
tears to spring to Sam's eyes. Faith placed another soft kiss on
Sam's lips and then uttered, "and you're the first person I'm ever
gonna say it to, I love you Samantha." The tears that were forming
in Sam's eyes spilt over and Faith kissed them away. And before he
lips met Sam's yet again she whispered, "first and last."</p>

<chapter title="Part Twenty-One: A Battle Plan">
<p>***Kennedy High; Parking lot***</p>
<p>Nicole sat in her luxury car and thought. She had the perfect
information to hurt not only Faith but Spam too! But she didn't know
how to use it. She had tried the flyer thing before when she found
out about Carmen's mother being a drunk, so that was out. So her
problem was how to you go about telling a mass of people something,
where they knew it was you who did it, but yet had no proof that it
was. And this was her problem.</p>
<p>Tapping her steering wheel impatiently she let her eyes unfocuss and
look inward. She knew the answer had to be in her diabolical mind
somewhere. Two people walked behind Nicole's car, since her window
was down she caught part of their conversation.</p>
<p>"No way!"</p>
<p>"No I'm telling you it's true, I saw it on the net on this really
cool website, he's totally."</p>
<p>The rest of the conversation was lost on her, she had it! The
Internet! You want to let large sums of people (like the population
of Kennedy High) you post it on the net, someone will find it, pass
it on, and before you know it, everyone knows. And of course it just
has to be true, it was on the net. Nicole smiled one of her most
evil smiled and set her brain to thinking about what computer nerds
she could make put the info out. Starting the car she drove off,
with a plan in hand.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Two: Obstacles Of The Slayer Kind">
<p>***Nadia and Faith's house; Buffy's temporary room***</p>
<p>Buffy paced the length of the room she was staying in while in town.
She had sent Willow and Tara along with Giles home earlier that day
saying she would follow in a few days. She just had to find out why
Faith had suddenly turned her down. Ever since the day they had met
Faith had hit on her and wanted her, and now suddenly she DIDN'T?!
Nope that wouldn't do at all. Had to be a reason. Just had to be.
Sure she knew, somewhere in her head, that Faith wouldn't wait
forever, but couldn't she wait just a little longer? </p>
<p>Buffy turned and started walking in the opposite direction. Who was
it that had changed Faith's mind about who she wanted? She must have
met someone here, Buffy reasoned. She thought back to the day she
had gotten there and remembered! The blonde! Faith had been playful
towards her.what was her name?! Brooke! She was named after water,
how original was that?! Had to be her, again Buffy's reasoning,
Faith had a thing for blondes right?</p>
<p>Turn. Pace. Now, how do you get rid of a blonde cheerleader?</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Three: Caught In The Act">
<p>***Park***</p>
<p>Lily and Josh were taking a walk. With everything going on lately
they felt as though they didn't get enough time together. So they
took the afternoon off and headed to the park. They were currently
walking along one of their favorite paths when Lily saw something she
just knew she wasn't seeing. Sam.with a girl. Sam with Faith.
Kissing. Groping. Hey this is a public place! Walking up to her
friend Lily cleared her voice loudly. When she got no response she
cleared her voice even more loudly. Nothing. Finally giving up (her
throat hurt now) she just settled for kicking Sam.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Sam squawked as she pushed Faith to the side to see who the
offending foot belonged to. "LILY!"</p>
<p>"You do realize you have a group of guys just standing there watching
right?" Lily asked, pointing to the guys in question, and smacking
Josh (his tongue was currently hanging out, and there was slobber,
not a good sight).</p>
<p>Sam and Faith both looked to where there was a rapidly thinning group
of ogling guys. Sam blushed and Faith just gave them a `shit-eating'
grin. Then Sam got all indignant (she's good at that) "Shouldn't you
be in school?"</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you?" Lily shot back. Sam had the grace to look
caught. "So, anything new in your life?" Lily asked with a raised
brow.</p>
<p>Sam and Faith finally stood up and Sam took Faith's hand defiantly
(or for comfort, either way) and stared her friend down, "Faith and I
are dating now.sorta, we haven't actually gone on a date, but you
know what I mean." Sam gave a quick nod of her head to emphasize her
statement, and Faith just grinned at her (she was cute when she was
all proud).</p>
<p>"So I see.how long?"</p>
<p>"Um.couple hours," Sam answered sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Wow, fast workers." Lily said and then smiled (Sam was her friend
and Faith, at the moment, was her hero, so she was happy for them).
Faith chuckled, and wrapped her arm around Sam's shoulders. Josh did
the same (why? Who knows.) and put his arm around Lily's
shoulders. "So." Lily stated awkwardly.</p>
<p>"You're not gonna out us are you?!" Sam asked suddenly, she and
Faith had just gotten together (gay or not) she wasn't ready to share
that with everyone yet.</p>
<p>"Not till you give the ok." Lily answered and then started pulling
Josh away, "see you guys later, and remember the park is a bad place
for groping."</p>
<p>"Bad personal experience?" Faith asked, speaking for the first
time. Lily turned bright red and Josh just gave Faith his own `shit-
eating' grin, which was returned.</p>
<p>"Can this day get any more eventful?!" Sam asked as she buried her
head in Faith's shoulders. And then she remembered that you just
never ask questions like that, OR IT WOULD HAPPEN! Giving a little
groan she buried her head further into Faith's flesh wishing she
could just stay there forever.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Four: Just The Geek I Was Looking For">
<p>***Kennedy High; Computer Lab***</p>
<p>After her little afternoon joy ride Nicole walked into a part of the
school she had never been in before, the computer lab.  After all
where better to look for a computer geek than the computer lab.
right?  Of course that's the best place to look, duh!  So Nicole
stormed the place where the computers lived and found only one
computer geek present.  "You."</p>
<p>The girl sitting at the computer looked up at the short blonde who
had just addressed her.  She had never seen the girl before, so she
had no idea why on Earth she was addressing her.  "Um.yes?"</p>
<p>"Listen up computer geek, I have a little job for you."</p>
<p>"Huh?"  The girl sitting at the computer asked confused."</p>
<p>"Oh don't give me that, I'll pay cash so don't act dumb.All I want
you to do is make up one of your little internet things and e-mail to
the school list.got it."  Nicole asked in her normal controlling
tones.</p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"Good.here."  Nicole thrust a piece of paper with what she wanted
done at the girl and then turned to storm out of the room.  "Oh, I
don't pay until I see results."  And with that she left.</p>
<p>Willow looked down at the piece of paper that had been thrust at her,
and cursed herself for not leaving when Buffy had asked them to.
Reading over the words her brows furrowed as she read what the girl
wanted to do to Faith.  She wasn't Faith biggest fan, by no means,
but it just didn't seem right to out someone like that.  A wicked
little smile lit up Willow's face and she logged onto the net, she
had the perfect plan to show the person (who from what she could tell
made Cordelia look like May Poppins) who was just there a thing or
two.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Five: Seek And Destroy">
<p>***Kennedy High; hallways***</p>
<p>Buffy made her way through the unfamiliar hallways of Kennedy High,
noting how much bigger it was than Sunnydale High.  She was glad no
one had stopped her so far asking what she was doing in the school
before classes were even out, and she was just as glad she hadn't
seen Faith, or rather, Faith hadn't seen her.  She was on a mission,
find the blonde cheerleader, destroy the blonde cheerleader, simple
plan really.  Or so it seemed in her head, the trick was to actually
find her.</p>
<p>Buffy was starting to get upset with her lack of progress when she
heard her name being called.  Turning Buffy saw just the person she
had been looking for.  "Hi.Buffy right?  Your Faith's friend?"
Brooke asked as she approached.</p>
<p>"That's me.  And you're Brooke." They stood in awkward silence for a
few seconds.  Brooke trying to figure out why Buffy had a very, very
predatory look on her face, and Buffy trying to figure out why she
hadn't put the second part of her plan into action now that she had
found the (undoubtedly) evil cheerleader.</p>
<p>"So um, what brings you here to Kennedy?"  Brooke finally asked
dispelling the silence that had settle so uncomfortably around them.</p>
<p>Buffy thought fast, "I was just looking for Faith, she forgot her
lunch money."  `Oh yeah smooth Summers.'</p>
<p>For some unknown (to Buffy anyway) reason Brooke smirked.  "Well we
wouldn't want her to go with out lunch now would we."  She said in a
mock serious tone.  Brooke's eyes widened and she was suddenly
pulling a confused Buffy into the Novak.  "Sorry, that was our
principal."  Brooke explained seeing the question in Buffy's eyes.
Buffy looked around the bathroom, it was nice, a couch and
everything.  This place was starting to make SHS look like a ghetto
school.  Brooke cleared her throat to get Buffy's attention and then
asked, "ok, so what are you really doing here?"</p>
<p>Not being able to think of a lie on the spot (she had always sucked
at that) she told the truth.  "Looking for you actually."  The
statement lacked the malice she had wanted to put in for some
reason.  Mentally she chastened herself.</p>
<p>Brooke looked stunned for a second and then smiled, "so you found
me."  She let the rest of the statement hang, hoping Buffy would fill
in just why she would be looking for her.  When no answers from the
shorter blonde were forthcoming Brooke sighed, "Buffy."</p>
<p>Whatever Brooke was going to say was cut off as Nicole came into the
Novak, not noticing Buffy at first she greeted her friend, "Brookie,
what are you doing?"  Brooke's eyes went to Buffy and Nicole looked
over noticing her for the first time, "hello."  Nicole stated icily.</p>
<p>Brooke thought up a suitably reasonable reason for her to be in the
Novak talking to Buffy and then said to Nicole, "this is Buffy.she
wants to join the Glamazons."  She mentally patted herself on the
back for her lie.  Buffy did, after all, look like the perfect high
school cheerleader.  Buffy raised her eyebrows at the lie but didn't
bother to correct it; she figured if nothing else this would be
amusing.</p>
<p>"Really?"  Nicole asked, making a more thorough inspection of the
blonde.  The idea of making Mary Cherry lower on the food chain
filtered into her mind.  She smirked, "set up a try out?"  </p>
<p>The question was directed to Brooke who looked back at Buffy, who
answered for her, "this afternoon."  </p>
<p>"Good."  Nicole nodded and then walked out after saying goodbye to
Brooke.</p>
<p>Brooke and Buffy stared at each other for a second, neither knowing
why they lied, or what was going to happen next, but the thought of
spending time together wasn't exactly appalling, to either of
them.  `So much for that plan,' Buffy thought to herself as she
stared at the slightly taller blonde.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Six: Nickname:  I Think I'll Call You.">
<p>***Park***</p>
<p>After their little run in with Lily and Josh Sam and Faith went back
to snuggling under a tree.  They were as carefree as new young love
can be, just enjoying the presence and the loving embrace of the one
they loved.  Faith's back was leaning against the tree and Sam's head
was resting comfortably on her chest.  Everyone once in awhile Faith
would drop a soft kiss on top of Sam's head, but it was nothing
compared to the heated embrace they shared earlier when Lily had
caught them.  Despite her concerns about asking if anything else
could go wrong Sam was comfortable.</p>
<p>She loved the way Faith's arms fit around her body and held her
close.  She loved they way Faith smelt too.  Like leather and
cigarettes, it added a dangerous feel to the whole scene.  Sam
smirked, this must be her rebel phase, she mused.  Sam noticed as
Faith's hand came down and tore a piece of grass from the ground and
rolled it around in her fingers before dropping it, and then doing
again.  "I think it would take a while to get it all.easier to use a
mower."  Sam could feel Faith's chest vibrate with her chuckle and
her smirk grew into a smile.</p>
<p>"A mower, why would I want to do something sensible like that?"
Faith asked teasingly as she ran the fingers of her other hand
through Sam's thick hair.</p>
<p>Sam looked up at Faith to see a thoughtful expression on her face as
she stared back down at her.  "As corny as it sounds.what are you
thinking right now?"</p>
<p>"The was the mother of all corniness."  Faith responded with a smirk.</p>
<p>"So noted, and you final answer please?"</p>
<p>"Nickname."  Faith answered as if it explained everything.  Sam
looked up at her girlfriend with an expectant statement.  Seeing she
was going to get away with her answer, Faith explained, "I give
everyone nicknames.  Buffy is B."  Sam bristled a little, Buffy still
being a soft spot for her, it wasn't hard for her to tell the two of
the have, or had feelings for each other.  Faith continued without
notice to the sour statement on Sam's face, "Willow is Red.Tara is T.
Cordelia is Queen C.Giles is G-man.Xander is the Xandman.Oz was
wolfboy.Wesley.well Wesley was the putz."  Faith said with another
chuckle, although she knew Sam would have no idea why it was so
funny.  "I need one for you."</p>
<p>"Not too sure I want another nickname.  Everyone calls me Sam, or
sometimes Sammy."  Sam answered, she was almost afraid of what Faith
would come up with for her after hearing the other's names.</p>
<p>"I got it."  Faith answered confidently, nodding her head in
acceptance of whatever it was she was thinking in her head.</p>
<p>"What?"  Sam asked, steeling herself for whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Faith leaned down and attached her lips to Sam's.  "Samantha."  It
wasn't a nickname, but no one else called her that, and that was
enough for Faith, she just wanted a name for Sam that no one else
used.  Sam sighed, she didn't mind Faith using her full name, it
actually sounded good coming out of Faith's oh so sexy lips.</p>
<p>This time Sam initiated the kiss.  "I can live with that."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Seven: Don't Tick Off A Red-Head!">
<p>***Kennedy High; Computer Lab***</p>
<p>Willow looked at the finished product.  Ok, so it wasn't exactly what
the pushy blonde had asked for, but she thought it was perfect.
Smirking to herself she stretched and got up, smiling when she heard
Tara's soft voice.  "That's mean."</p>
<p>"And what she wanted to do to Faith and that Sam girl wasn't?"
Willow asked, knowing full well Tara was laughing on the inside at
her practical joke.</p>
<p>"It was too.when are you sending it out?"  Tara asked as she came
over and wrapped her arms around her waist, with Tara resting her
chin on Willow's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Now."  The red head answered, hitting the enter key.  The
little `net-thing' was sent to everyone in KHS with an e-mail
address.  "Come on let's go home."  Hand and hand Willow and Tara
walked out and headed for Giles' beat up car so that they could go
back to the hellmouth.  Silently each wished Faith luck.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Eight: Give Me A.'Uh Oh'">
<p>***Kennedy High; Gym***</p>

<p>Buffy looked around and the various Glamazons milling around the gym,
it wasn't so different from her cheerleading days at Hermy.  She also
noticed how everyone greeted Brooke when they came in, but hid from
Nicole.  "Brookie, there ya are."  A very Texas like accent crossed
over the gym as a crazed looking blonde ran towards them.  "Oh hello,
and who might ya'll be?"</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry this is Buffy, she went to Hermy."  Nicole said, she had
easily recognized the name of the L.A. school and was glad to have
someone with the ability and know how to be popular trying out for
the team, unlike that *shiver* Carmen Fererra.</p>

<p>"Oh my word, a Herman."  Mary Cherry said excitedly as she clapped
her hands together.  Buffy just raised an eyebrow at her. </p>

<p>Nicole clapped her hands, obviously starting practice; she quickly
introduced Buffy to rest of the people present, and then went through
the try out.  Buffy found that the movements for the cheers were
still with her as she easily matched, if not out matched, rest of the
Glamazons.  She quickly became a favorite of Nicole's, which scared
her just a little bit.  When she thought about it Nicole seemed like
a cross between Cordelia during her bitch years, and Glory.  Where as
Mary Cherry was a cross of Drucilla, Cordelia, and one of Glory's
minions.  She shivered on reflex.</p>

<p>Buffy turned her attention, wanting to think up an evil cross for her
too, but as she studied the blonde, she couldn't come up with
anything negative.  In fact she could see what Faith saw in her.
Idly she wondered when she had stopped, in her mind anyway, competing
Brooke for Faith, and started competing Faith for Brooke.  It didn't
really matter though, she was the slayer, and she was ready to pout
until she got what she wanted.  Her mind being completely elsewhere,
namely Brooke curves, she completely missed helping catch the girl
they had just thrown into the air.  </p>

<p>The poor girl landed on the floor with a thud.  *THUD. *  Everyone
flinched in sympathetic pain as they helped the girl off the
floor.  "I am so sorry."  Buffy said taking the girl's right arm,
Brooke grabbed her left and carefully they led the girl to the
nurse's office.  When they got back practice was over and they were
alone in the locker room.  Brooke quickly went to her locker and
started stripping so she could take a shower, a nice cold shower.
Buffy leaned against the lockers and watched Brooke till the taller
girl's eyes came up to meet hers.  "So.I'm a Herman?"</p>

<p>Brooke flushed and started the apology she had been working on since
practice started, "I'm sorry about all of this, even thought you're
good, other than dropping Poppy that is, but I shouldn't have lied to
Nicole and gotten you into this whole mess, and now you're kinda
stuck, and it's all my fault and I am so sorry." Brooke trailed off
as she looked up and saw the smirk on Buffy's face.</p>

<p>"Very impressive babble."</p>

<p>"Babbling Brooke that's me."  Brooke scrunched up her forehead as she
realized what she had just said.  Then she scowled at a chuckling
Buffy and went into the shower room.  Turning on the water she
stepped under the spray and started washing the sweat, and other
things, from her body.  Her back to the entrance Brooke didn't notice
at first as Buffy leaned against the doorway watching her.  But when
she turned around, her eyes opened, she immediately saw Buffy
watching her.  Buffy didn't bother looking away as Brooke's eyes met
hers.  In fact she walked forward.</p>

<p>Buffy got right up in Brooke's personal space and pressed her body to
the taller one, her lips seeking out Brooke's.  Buffy pushed Brooke
against the titled wall, the water cascading down around them, and
made the contact firmer.  When Brooke moaned Buffy took the chance to
let her tongue out to play, and slipped it into Brooke's mouth.
Brooke's tongue met her halfway and dueled for dominance of the
kiss.  Buffy's hand came up and tested the weight of Brooke's breast
in her hand, never breaking the sweet contact of their lips.
Brooke's hands traveled down Buffy's body and rested on the soft
curve of Buffy's ass.</p>

<p>Finally breaking contact Buffy pulled back some to regain her
breathing, and calm her rapid heartbeat.  Their eyes bore into each
other, smoldering with the passion that had rose so easily between
them.  "My car is out front, my house just ten minutes from there."
Brook breathed out.</p>

<p>"To far."  Buffy answered with a smirk, but nonetheless pulled back
so that they could both get dried and dressed.  "Will anyone be home?"</p>

<p>"Um.maybe Sam.but she might be out with Faith."  Brooke answered,
thinking about the conspicuous disappearance of both girls for most
of the day.</p>

<p>"With Faith?"  Buffy asked confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah, wonderful imagery huh?"  Brooke asked oblivious to the mental
slap on the forehead Buffy had just given herself.  "Come on."
Brooke led Buffy to her car, not being able to wait to get home, and
naked, with Buffy, again.</p>

<p>`Well at least I don't have to worry about the conversation where I
tell Faith I stole her girlfriend.'  Buffy thought to herself as she
settled into the front passenger side of he car.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Twenty-Nine: Your Bed Or Mine?">
<p>***Park***</p>

<p>Faith stood and stretched, "well I'm ready to be indoors again."
Faith reached down and took Sam's hand and helped her up.</p>

<p>"You want to go home?"  Sam asked, kind of disappointed, after a few
hours of making out, saying goodbye was not what she had in mind,
nope not at all.</p>

<p>"Any other ideas?"  Faith asked, thinking home was the perfect place
to go, no audiences, and much to the surprise of others, she wasn't a
voyeur.</p>

<p>"No, guess not."  Sam said disappointed.</p>

<p>"So, your home or mine?"  Faith asked, already guessing why Sam
sounded upset.  Faith leaned down and placed a soft kiss on the lips
she was quickly beginning to love.</p>

<p>"Mine, as much as I like Nadia, I don't want her knocking on the door
at the wrong time."  Sam said as her arms snaked around Faith's neck,
pulling her down for a longer kiss.</p>

<p>"I know your parents are away, but what about Brooke?"  Faith asked
skeptically, Nadia would have to manage the stairs to get to them;
Brooke would just have to walk through the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Cheerleading practice."  Sam answered with a mischievous grin.  Sam
led Faith back to Faith's bike and they climbed on, heading to the
Palace.</p>

<p>When they finally got there Sam led Faith up to her room, and quickly
locked both doors.  "Anxious aren'tcha?"  Faith chuckled.  Sam gave
Faith by far the sexiest grin she had ever seen and then climbed
seductively on the bed.  Sitting up on her knees Sam motioned Faith
with one finger in a `come hither' fashion.  Completely unable to
resist the charms of her girlfriend Faith moved forward until she
felt her knees brush the edge of the bed.  "I love you."  Faith
whispered in awe as she closed the distance between their lips.</p>

<p>Sam's hand traveled to the small of Faith's back and pulled her
closer.  Faith taking the hint climbed onto the bed, and gently
pushed Sam back so that she was lying on top of her.  Faith looked
into Sam's eyes to make sure she was absolutely sure about this,
seeing no hesitation she closed the gap between their lips once
more.  Faith's hand traveled up the inside of Sam's shirt, gently
grabbing the Sam's breast and squeezing.  Sam moaned into Faith's
mouth and arched her body into her hand.  Faith reclaimed her lips
from Sam and pushed herself up slightly.  Taking her hand from Sam's
shirt, and smiling at the slightly confused look on her girlfriend's
face, Faith sat back on her calves.</p>

<p>Pulling Sam up she quickly got rid of Sam's shirt, followed shortly
by her own.  One they were both bare-chested before the other Faith
pushed Sam back onto the bed, the swell of their breasts pushing into
each other comfortably.  Faith's hand came down and started working
on getting Sam's pants unfastened and unzipped.  When her chore was
finally done Faith let her hand glide inside of Sam's underwear,
slightly cupping Sam's wet sex.  Sam arched her hips up into Faith's
hand.  Almost cuming when Faith's hot breath whispered in her
ear, "too many cloths."</p>

<p>Nodding in agreement Sam pushed an amused Faith off of her and jumped
up taking her shoes, socks, pants, and panties off.  She stood before
Faith in all her nakedness without shame or embarrassment as Faith's
eyes raked over every inch of her body.  "Your turn."  Faith smiled
and nodded, standing up she turned Sam so that she was by the bed and
sat her down on the edge.  Never taking her eyes from Sam's Faith
reached down and undid the button on her leather pants.  Kicking her
boots off as she started to push the leather article from her body.
Her thumbs hooked in booth the edge of her pants and panties she
easily removed both items.</p>

<p>Faith now stood equally as naked as Sam, their eyes locked together
as their hands reached out to touch and explore until now unexplored
skin.  Faith pushed Sam back on the bed, helping her scoot up some so
that they were both completely lying on the bed.  Once again Faith's
body covered Sam's, their tongue's dueling, and their hands
searching.  Faith's hand was once again on Sam's sex and she let her
finger swirl in slight circles around Sam's clit.  She slid her
finger further down and was about to enter her hot passage when Sam
grabbed her hand and stopped her.</p>

<p>"Faith I've never.I mean no one has ever.I'm a." Sam stammered, for
the first time since she and Faith started making love nervous, if
not embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Sam are you a virgin?"  Faith asked softly.  Sam nodded her head,
her teary eyes meeting Faith's.  "And you've never used your own
fingers?"  </p>

<p>Sam shook her head; "I wanted to be with someone for the first time.
totally with them."  Sam tried explaining, not sure Faith was
understanding her, not sure she was understanding her.</p>

<p>"Shh.I understand.do you trust me?"  Faith asked.  Sam nodded her
head furiously up and down.  "Then trust that I'll be gentle?"  The
water that had been gathering in Sam's eyes fell and she nodded her
head again.  Faith leaned down and kissed Sam passionately, but
softly.  Excepting the gift she was being given whole heartily.
Faith's fingers were at Sam's passage again, and Faith looked into
Sam's eyes as she slid a finger into her.  Sam was tight around
Faith's finger, and she let it sit there for a minute, letting Sam
get use to the invasion.</p>

<p>Sam wound her arms around Faith's neck and pulled her down for a
kiss.  Knowing Faith was leaving the next step in her hands, Sam
pushed her hips back, and then up, so that Faith's finger went in and
out.  Faith took the hint and started pumping her finger in a slow
rhythm so she wouldn't hurt her lover.  Faith's thumb came up and
started playing with Sam's clit, it only took a few minutes for Sam
to moan out Faith's name as she came for the first time under her
lover's skillful fingers.</p>

<p>Faith held Sam close as she fell back to Earth after her orgasm.
Whispering soft, loving nothings in her ear the whole time.  Sam
buried her head in the crook of Faith's neck and sighed happily.
Faith finally removed her finger from Sam and moved to lie on her
back, Sam following and laying her head on Faith' chest.  Sam was
idly drawing circles on Faith's abdomen when she spoke softly, "I
want to do that to you Faith.but I don't know how."</p>

<p>Faith pulled Sam closer, taking the smaller hand in her own, "then
I'll show you."  Faith led their hands down to her own pulsating sex
and instructed Sam's fingers to apply a circular pressure to her
clit.  Faith's hips quickly matched the rhythm that was set.  Sam
kissed the portion of Faith's collar bone that was close to her lips,
and looked up into the passion filled brown eyes that were boring
down on her.  Smiling and leaning up she kissed Faith, conveying with
her mouth and tongue just how much she loved her.  Faith directed
Sam's hand to push two fingers inside her wet channel, and Sam
complied.</p>

<p>Rhythmically pushing her fingers in and out she watched in awe as
Faith threw her head back and closed her eyes tightly in ecstasy.
Faith directed Sam to use another finger, and rub her clit at the
same time.  In moments that seemed like and eternity Faith came with
Sam's name on her lips, her juices flooding over Sam's hand.  "I love
you."  Sam said as she placed a kiss on Faith's sweat soaked temple.</p>

<p>Faith rolled onto her side, taking Sam into her arms and replied, "I
love you too Samantha."  Together, curled up impossible close, they
fell into a contented sleep.</p>

<chapter title="Part Thirty: Double The Blonde, Double The Fun">
<p>***The Palace***</p>

<p>Brooke led Buffy into the house, both noting Faith's Harley in the
front drive.  Going straight up the stairs Brooke stopped in front of
Sam's door and listened.  Nothing.  Reaching under the small piece of
upraised carpet she produced a key.  Pushing the key into the lock
and opening the door the two blondes looked in on the two brunettes.
They were both sound asleep, curled up together in a tight embrace,
barely covered by the sheet.  Smiling Brooke relocked and closed the
door, and then led Buffy to her own room just a little further down
the hall.  Opening her door and then locking it, along with the
bathroom door she said, "well have to quiet so we don't wake them,
think you can handle that Herman?"</p>

<p>Buffy not missing the teasing challenge smiled and walked up to
Brooke, pinning her to the door, "I can if you can.babbling Brooke."
With out further ado Brooke brought her lips down on Buffy's in a
brutally smoldering kiss.  Pushing Buffy back to the bed Brooke
straddle her when they got there.  Buffy was all too happy to let
Brooke take the lead, for now.  Brooke was busy devouring Buffy's
mouth when she felt the hands on her back, under her shirt.  Pulling
back for all of two seconds Brooke pulled her shirt from her body,
and then crushed her lips back to Buffy's.</p>

<p>Impatiently Brooke pulled on Buffy's shirt, tugging it over her
head.  Getting up she tugged her skirt off, showing that she had
neglected to put her under garments on after her shower in the locker
room.  Then she pushed Buffy down and took the rest of her cloths off
for her.  Both of them being completely naked now, Brooke practically
pounced on Buffy.  Brooke's hips started thrusting against Buffy's,
their sexes rubbing against each other with every thrust.  Seconds,
or moments, or even hours later, they came with a grunt and a moan.
Brooke collapsed down on top of Buffy, exhausted.</p>

<p>Buffy rolled them over and started kissing and nipping Brooke's
neck, "my turn."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Thirty-One: The Morning After (Sam and Faith)">
<p>***The Palace; Sam's Room*** </p>

<p>Faith woke up with the most comfortable weight against her, opening
her eyes she saw Sam curled up right next to her, head pillowed on
her shoulder.  Smiling she kissed to the top of Sam head, her smile
growing larger as Sam mumbled something and burrowed further into
her.  Faith's heart swelled with the love she felt for the gorgeous
brunette next to her.  She knew now that she had never know love
before, what she had felt for others was nothing compared to what she
felt for Sam.</p>

<p>Sam mumbled again and stretched out like a lazy cat, grinning she
leaned up and pecked Faith on the cheek, earning a smile in
return.  "Morning."  Faith said softly, putting her arms around Sam
just a little tighter.</p>

<p>Sam peaked open one eye, glanced at the clock, and corrected
Faith, "afternoon.  Good thing it's Saturday, or we'd be really late."</p>

<p>"So what do you want to do today?"  Faith asked, nuzzling the top of
Sam's head, her hands wondering over Sam's body under the covers.</p>

<p>"Mmmm.this."  Sam answered as she rolled on top of Faith and smiled
down at her.  Giving her a real good morning kiss (at least five
minutes in length) she moved further down so that she could rest her
head on Faith's chest and listen to her heart pounding in her chest.
Faith wrapped her arms around the warm bundle of Sam lying on top of
her and grinned like crazy (as people are known to do after making
love).  Simultaneously Faith and Sam's stomachs grumbled at them,
demanding to be fed.  "Guess that means we have to get up."  Sam
said, although her voice seriously lacked the conviction to actually
do what she proposed.</p>

<p>"Yup."  Faith agreed, sounding way more chipper than she had ever
before in her life.  When she noticed the Sam was making no move to
actually get up she lifted her girlfriend in her arms and deposited
the shocked girl on the floor next to the bathroom door.  "What?"
Faith asked to the totally shocked statement on Sam's face.</p>

<p>"I knew you were strong, but I didn't know you were that strong."
Sam answered in awe.  </p>

<p>"Slayer strength."  Faith answered nonchalantly, without even
thinking about it.</p>

<p>Sam raised an eyebrow, "slayer strength?  What's that?"  Realizing
her mistake Faith grinned (hoping Sam wouldn't notice she wasn't
answering) and kissed her soundly (Sam didn't notice the lack of
answer).</p>

<p>"Shower and breakfast?"  Faith asked wiggling her eyebrows
suggestively.  Sam grinned and pushed Faith into the bathroom while
seeking her lips with her own. </p>

<chapter title="Part Thirty-Two: The Morning After (Buffy and Brooke)">
<p>***The Palace; Brooke's room***</p>

<p>"No.no more homework.evil Glass." Brooke mumbled in her sleep,
causing the body behind her to shake with laughter.  Buffy was
currently spooning Brooke from behind; listening to all the little
mumbles thinking that they were the cutest thing she had ever heard
in her life, and the little scowl Brooke wore just added to the
effect.  Buffy started making little circular motions around Brooke's
belly button, causing the sleeping girl to giggle, Buffy had to fight
hard not to erupt with laughter.  Adding nibbling of the ear to her
little motions on Brooke's stomach Buffy was having the time of her
life.</p>

<p>"Kill the frogs!"  Brooke grumbled in her sleep, Buffy couldn't fight
it any longer and she burst out laughing causing Brooke to wake
up.  "Hmm.what?  What's so funny?"  Brooke asked sleepily as she
rolled over and kissed the hollow of Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>"You talk in your sleep."  Buffy answered simply, still chuckling
slightly.  Brooke had a horrified look on her face as her sleep
fogged mind caught on to what Buffy was saying, she had no idea what
she said in her sleep, but the possibility that it was embarrassing,
if not incriminating, was colossal.</p>

<p>Giving the cutest little grimace Brooke asked, "what did I say?"</p>

<p>Buffy's hand started moving up and down Brooke's exposed thigh, and
went back to nibbling on her ear, in-between nibbles she
answered, "other than being an enemy to all frogs, you begged for no
more homework and accused glass of being evil."  Brooke smiled as she
registered what Buffy told her, Bio Glass's class always gave her
nightmares.  Thoroughly enjoying what Buffy was doing to her body
Brooke decided to join in on the fun and moved her thigh in-between
Buffy's, rubbing it against the shorter blonde's center.</p>

<p>Buffy moaned and slipped her hand over Brooke's ass.  Brooke waited
until just the right moment and jumped up out of the bed with a
mischievous smirk, leaving a very confused Buffy behind.  When she
was standing at the foot of the bed Brook announced, "race you to the
shower!"  And started running, Buffy right on her heals.</p>

<p>Unlocking the door Brooke rushed into the warm bathroom, Buffy caught
up to her just as she reached for the shower curtain and was sucking
on her neck as she pulled it
back, "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"  Buffy's head
snapped up and saw a horrified Sam, and a shocked Faith standing in
the shower.  Belatedly she realized the steam and heat in the
bathroom must have been cause they had just turned the shower off.</p>

<p>All four girls stood frozen just staring at each other horrified.
(Any onlookers would have laughed their asses off!)  Shaking her head
to clear her fuzzy mind Faith grabbed the curtain and slid it back
into place.  This seemed to knock everyone out of their stupors and
Brooke started furiously apologizing as she and Buffy rushed out of
the bathroom.  Sam rested her head in the crook of Faith's neck and
whispered, "tell me that just did not happen!"</p>

<p>"I think we should go back to your room now Samantha."  Faith said,
peeking out to make sure the bathroom was empty she pulled the
curtain back and stepped out, grabbing a towel for herself and Sam on
the way, they both rushed off to Sam's room and got dressed.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part Thirty-Three: The Breakfast From Hell">
<p>***The Palace; Kitchen***</p>

<p>Buffy and Brooke were already in the kitchen when Faith and Sam
walked in hand in hand.  No one looked anyone else in the eye as they
silently fixed bowls of cereal for breakfast.  Sam sat in her usual
seat at the table with Faith next to her, gripping her hand under the
table for comfort.  Brook also sat at her usual spot, Buffy next to
her.  Neither set of girls looked up from their cereal bowls as they
ate.  It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  Finally Faith broke
the silence, "as far as awkward moments go, this takes the cake."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, we had no idea you guys were in there, together,
doing that.and oh my god I'm sorry and we didn't mean to honest, and
it will NEVER happen again I swear!"  Brook babbled, her face bright
red.</p>

<p>Faith looked at Buffy and smirked, "she could give Red a run for her
money in the babble department."  Buffy smirked fondly at Brooke and
put her hand on Brooke's thigh under the table.</p>

<p>"Yup."  Brooke (if it was possible) turned brighter red.</p>

<p>"Guess you guys had fun last night then."  Faith continued, smirk
never leaving her face.  After all she wasn't one to be shy about
sex, and now that the whole thing was at least half an hour behind
them, she could look back and laugh.</p>

<p>Buffy's smirk got more mischievous, "yup."  (Brooke couldn't have
gotten redder if she tried)</p>

<p>"Can we all just move on and forget this ever happened.please."
Brooke begged, looking each of the other girls in the eye (finally).</p>

<p>"Hmmm.I don't know.Samantha?"  Faith asked teasingly.</p>

<p>Picking up on Faith teasing Sam smiled and looked at Brooke, "I don't
know, it was kinda one of those unforgettable moments, burned into
the brain and all that."  Brooke moaned and buried her head in
Buffy's shoulder, "hey that doesn't mean we want a replay."  Sam
teased acting traumatized.</p>

<p>"This is never going to be lived down," Brooke mumbled into Buffy's
neck.  The rest of the girls present chuckled.  It kinda disturbed
Brooke that she was the only one that seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p>"So what are your plans for the day?"  Faith asked, giving Brooke a
reprieve (for now anyway).</p>

<p>"Well we can mark being traumatized off the `to do list'."  Buffy
stated cheekily.  Playing along Faith made a little check mark in the
air.  "After that, no plans have been made yet, how about you guys?"
Buffy asked, glad there were no hard feelings between anyone present,
and that Faith didn't seem mad that just days earlier she had gone
after her and now she was sitting here with Brooke.</p>

<p>Faith looked to Sam asking the same question silently, receiving a
shrug she looked back to the blonde duo, "I dunno."</p>

<p>"We could all avoid each other."  Brooke mumbled piteously from
Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>"Hey don't mom and Mike get back today?"  Sam asked.  Receiving a nod
she continued, "ok I vote on outside the house activities.  We could
go back to the park."  Sam suggested to Faith, wiggling her eyebrows.
Faith chuckled at her girlfriend's antics.  </p>

<p>"I don't know, being caught in compromising positions twice in 24
hours, don't think we should risk it."  Sam pouted playfully back at
her and Faith leaned over and gave her a quick gentle kiss on the
lips.  "You're cute when you pout."  Sam smiled back at her and then
remembered Buffy and Brooke were in the room (and watching
them).  "Movies?"</p>

<p>"Dark theater, back row, no one paying any attention to anyone else."
Buffy said pretending to think it over; looking at Brooke's slightly
glazed eyes she answered, "sounds like fun."  The four finalized
their plans and went about rest of their day (Brooke never did stop
blushing).</p>
