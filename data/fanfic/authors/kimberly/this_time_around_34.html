<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Four: Back To School -->

<p>***Kennedy High***</p>

<p>When Monday morning rolled around Brooke said goodbye (reluctantly)
to Buffy for the day.  Brooke was envious of Sam and Faith; at least
they got to see each other all day.  If even if they weren't making a
display of their relationship.  So Brooke decided on the next best
thing, when she got to school she went in search of her best friend.
True Nicole could be an evil-back-stabbing-bitch sometimes, but hey,
what are ya gonna do?</p>

<p>Brooke went to Nicole's locker first, no Nicole.  So she headed to
the next best place to look, the Novak.  Her search proved fruitful
when she saw Nicole sitting on the plush couch in the Novak, head in
hands.  Concerned as to why Nicole was looking at the ground rather
than herself in the mirror Brooke approached her.  "Nic, what's up?"</p>

<p>Nicole looked up at her best friend and frowned.  "It's horrible.
Never trust a computer nerd.  And the worst thing is, I can't find
the little bitch, no one even knows who she is!"  Nicole ranted,
halfway through her rant she had gotten up and started pacing the
Novak, thrashing her arms about wildly.</p>

<p>Brooke closed her eyes, and shook her head in hopes that it would
help clear her head and make her understand what Nicole was talking
about.  It didn't work.  "Ok, let's start over.  Hi Nicole.  How are
you today?"</p>

<p>Nicole turned (during her pacing she had ended up with her back to
Brooke and the door) and glared at Brooke.  "I'm gonna kill `er when
I find `er!"  Nicole ground out.  Brooke was about to replay,
basically ask what the hell Nicole was talking about when Faith and
Sam came in.  Nicole just glared harder at the new arrivals.</p>

<p>"Damn it got cold all the sudden."  Faith said cheekily as she
noticed the ice in Nicole's glare.</p>

<p>"All right listen trailer trash and Spam McQueerson, I know it was
you who put that nerd up to it, and be damn sure I'll get you back!"</p>

<p>Faith and Sam looked to Brooke to be clued in, she just shrugged her
shoulders, after all she had no idea either.  "What's with you this
morning Satan?"  Just then Mary Cherry rushed in (it was getting
mighty crowded).</p>

<p>"Oh mah gawd Nic, Ah just saw and let me just say it is a travesty
what they have done to ya hun."  If the girls in the room other than
Nicole didn't know better they would have sword the Nicole growled,
as it was they just shook it off and looked to Mary Cherry and her
laptop (when did Mary Cherry get a laptop anyway?)</p>

<p>"What's up?"  Brooke asked hoping the psychotic Texan would prove
more useful in the knowledge area than Nicole was (scary thought
indeed.)  Instead of answering Mary Cherry placed the laptop on the
counter and turned it on.  She got online and went to the school's
homepage.  There on the greeting page for Kennedy High School was the
most grotesque version of the female body ever seen, with Nicole's
head.  Holding a sign proudly proclaiming her dateless status for
that Friday night, along with her phone number (along with the
words "I'm easy".)</p>

<p>Despite herself Brooke started laughing.  So did everyone else (Mary
Cherry tried to keep a straight face, it just wasn't working.)  "Wow
Nicole, didn't know you had a tat.  Impressive."  Faith sniggered.
The tattoo in question was a heart shape with an arrow through it,
with a name etched in the center.  Looking closer at the screen
Brooke saw the name and just started laughing harder.</p>

<p>"Wow Nicole, Scooby Doo is cool and all, but don'tcha think that's a
bit overboard."</p>

<p>"I know you guys put that damn red headed geek up to this, and when I
find her." Nicole let the threat trail off as she went out of the
Novak, quickly followed by Mary Cherry.  In Faith's mind the clues
clicked together and she chuckled.</p>

<p>"What?"  Sam asked poking Faith in the chest</p>

<p>"Red."  Faith said.  At the blank expressions she continued. "B's
friend Willow, big into computers, part of the Scooby gang back in
SunnyD.musta been her."</p>

<p>"Then it was you who put her up to it?"  Brooke asked amused.</p>

<p>Faith grinned from ear to ear, "nope."  Brooke and Sam shared a laugh
and then headed to class, the bell had rung after all.</p>
