<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Eight: All A Dream? Part Two -->

<p>***The Palace; Brooke's Room***</p>

<p>The first think Brooke realized when she woke was that she was
naked.  Then she noticed that there was someone naked spooning her
from behind.  Buffy.  A very naked Buffy.  Brooke rolled over and
kissed the lips of the still sleeping girl.  She could still taste
herself on Buffy's lips due to the nights events.  The nights
events...dancing, clubing, vampires, slayers, great sex...just a
normal night....</p>

<p>"What'cha thinking?"  Buffy asked, her eyes were still closed but she
could sense some deep thoughts coming from the other blonde.</p>

<p>"Was it a dream Buffy?"  Brooke whispered back.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed and opened her eyes, she was met with concerned hazel
ones staring at her intently.  "No...not a dream, it was real."</p>

<p>"You and Faith are slayers, who kill vampires?"  Brooke asked again,
just to make sure she had it all stright.</p>

<p>"Yup."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled and kissed Buffy soundly with all the passion she had
in her lithe body, "my girlfriend, the vampire slayer."</p>

<p>"Girlfriend?"  Buffy asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes had widened.  They had never really talked about what
they were, they were too busy having sex.  "I mean...um...if that's
not...um..."  Brooke sputtered trying with all her sleepy might to
backtrack.</p>

<p>"No, Brooke it's ok...girlfriend, I like that."  Buffy said with a
smile.</p>

<p>Brooke gave a smile of relief, then got what could only be described
as an evil glint in her eye.  "You are SO going to pay for that
Summers!"  Brooke all but growled, raising herself up and straddeling
Buffy's midsection.</p>

<p>"Promise?"  Buffy asked rakishly.  Not realising she was repeating
Brooke's question from the night before when she had found out Buffy
died, and asked that she wouldn't do it again.</p>

<p>"Promise."  Brooke answered in all seriousness.  She leaned down and
kissed Buffy, not like they normally kissed though.  There was no
hury, no rushing.  It was a slow, sensual kiss meant to show, for the
first time, love, not lust.</p>

<p>Buffy looked into serious hazel eyes after the kiss finally ended, "I
think I could fall in love with you."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled down at her, "good, 'cause I so could too...give it a
go?"</p>

<p>Buffy rolled them over so that she was lying ontop of Brooke
now, "you bet."  And with that their lips, and bodies fused together
in a heated dance as old as time.</p>
