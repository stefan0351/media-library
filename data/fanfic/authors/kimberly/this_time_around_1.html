<!-- This Time Around \ Part One: Goodbye Hell -->

<p>***Sunnydale***</p>
<p>"Are you sure you have to go?" Buffy asked as Faith threw the last
of her stuff into the saddlebag on her motorcycle.</p>
<p>"Yup." Faith answered plainly, not even bothering to turn around and
look at the love of her life. She knew Buffy wanted her to stay, so
they could be friends again. But that just wasn't enough for her;
she had tried that the first time around, and look where it got her.
Nope, Faith had to have Buffy's love, or nothing at all. And as much
as it hurt to leave, she knew in the long run it would be best for
all of them.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna miss you.we just got you back and now you're leaving
again." Buffy pouted. She really didn't want Faith to leave again.
She wanted her to stay, they were the chosen two, and damn it, it was
hard being part of the chosen two when half of it was in some other
city.</p>
<p>"Here." Tara said quietly as she handed Faith a bag with sodas and
snacks for her journey.</p>
<p>"Thanks T." Faith nodded to the blonde Wiccan, and her red haired
lover who had just walked up.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Willow asked as she grabbed Tara's hand,
after everything that had happened, she didn't know whether to be sad
that Faith was leaving or jump for joy. She settled for honest
curiosity.</p>
<p>"G-man set my up at some school called Kennedy. Gonna go there, see
what all the fuss is about. You know they're supposed to be the best
years of you life or some shit like that."</p>
<p>"Ours weren't." Willow grumbled under her breath, but thanks to
slayer hearing both Buffy and Faith caught it.</p>
<p>Faith cringed inside, so there was definitely more than one reason
why she was leaving. Red didn't really want her here, even if she
did save her life, and her girlfriend's life, and Tara always agreed
with Willow, whether or not she really agreed with her. Xander
didn't want her here, hell she saved his and Anya's lives too. Giles
was indifferent, leaving it up to Buffy, who even now pouted at her.
Dawn could care less. Spike, shit she didn't care what Spike wanted,
she's stay just to drive him nuts. But in the end it came down to
the advice, that of all people, Queen C gave her. She was doing what
would be best for her. She really needed a clean start, where she
wasn't known as a murderer. And hell Red was all too happy to hop on
a computer and falsify some records so she could enroll.</p>
<p>Not being one for long goodbyes, this one had already taken too long;
Faith hopped on her bike, put on her helmet, and waved. Then she was
gone. Willow and Tara stood there for a second and then went back
into the Magic Box. Buffy stood there till she could no long see
Faith, even with slayer seeing. Faith was really gone, and she
didn't think that the other half of the chosen two was coming back
this time. Sighing she went back into the shop, she felt like
hitting something, a punching bag would have to do.</p>
