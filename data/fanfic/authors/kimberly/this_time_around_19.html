<!-- This Time Around \ Part Nineteen: Novak Confessions -->

<p>***Kennedy High***</p>
<p>Faith searched everywhere for Sam the next day at school. She knew
Sam was there somewhere, Brooke had told her as much. What she
didn't know was that currently Sam was looking everywhere for her.
So they played cat and mouse. Finally Faith took a side turn and
headed into the Novak. As soon was she walked in she saw Sam at the
mirror. Sam's eyes met her through the mirror and she smiled
faintly. "Hey Faith.I was looking for you."</p>
<p>"In the mirror? Funny place ta look." Faith said smirking. Sam
blushed a little, her smile growing.</p>
<p>"Yeah well I had to ask who was the best journalist of all.habit."
Sam replied, giving Faith one of her own smirks. Faith's smirk grew
into an all out smile.</p>
<p>"And what did it say?" Faith asked as she came up closer to Sam,
they were both now looking at each other in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Connie Chung, go figure." Sam said lightly. Faith burst out
laughing, and put her hands on Sam's hips to steady herself.
Everything in Sam's body shut down so that it could focus completely
and whole on where Faith's hands were currently located. Without
thought she leaned back into Faith, who accepted her weight
easily. "Faith."</p>
<p>"You know," Faith cut her off, "I noticed something the other day.
this really hot brunette kept sneakin' peaks at me. Now normally I
wouldn't think anything of it.except I kept sneakin' peaks too."</p>
<p>"Something should definitely be done about that." Sam said as she
closed her eyes, and let Faith's hot breath, oh so close to her ear,
sooth her, wash over her.</p>
<p>"You know, came to the same conclusion myself. Funny that." Faith
nuzzled Sam's neck with her nose, taking in her scent.</p>
<p>"And just what are you going to do?" Sam breathed out.</p>
<p>"Tell her how much I want her, need her, am falling in love with
her." Faith trailed off as she pulled Sam's lips to her own and
kissed her like it was the last chance she'd ever have to do so.</p>
<p>When the finally broke apart Sam smiled, a smile that lit up the
entire room, "and just what do you think SHE'll do when she hears
this admission?"</p>
<p>"Oh I've got a few ideas." Faith said and turned Sam so that her
back was to the mirror and kissed her again for all she was worth.
Sam put her arms around Faith's neck and deepened the kiss.</p>
<p>"Well, just so you know, she loves you too." Sam said smiling.
Faith gave her another quick kiss and led her out of the Novak, she
neither of them could suddenly wait till school was out!</p>
<p>Nicole stepped out of the stall she had been hiding in, "gotcha!"</p>
