<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-Two: Obstacles Of The Slayer Kind -->

<p>***Nadia and Faith's house; Buffy's temporary room***</p>
<p>Buffy paced the length of the room she was staying in while in town.
She had sent Willow and Tara along with Giles home earlier that day
saying she would follow in a few days. She just had to find out why
Faith had suddenly turned her down. Ever since the day they had met
Faith had hit on her and wanted her, and now suddenly she DIDN'T?!
Nope that wouldn't do at all. Had to be a reason. Just had to be.
Sure she knew, somewhere in her head, that Faith wouldn't wait
forever, but couldn't she wait just a little longer? </p>
<p>Buffy turned and started walking in the opposite direction. Who was
it that had changed Faith's mind about who she wanted? She must have
met someone here, Buffy reasoned. She thought back to the day she
had gotten there and remembered! The blonde! Faith had been playful
towards her.what was her name?! Brooke! She was named after water,
how original was that?! Had to be her, again Buffy's reasoning,
Faith had a thing for blondes right?</p>
<p>Turn. Pace. Now, how do you get rid of a blonde cheerleader?</p>
