<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-Four: Just The Geek I Was Looking For -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Computer Lab***</p>
<p>After her little afternoon joy ride Nicole walked into a part of the
school she had never been in before, the computer lab.  After all
where better to look for a computer geek than the computer lab.
right?  Of course that's the best place to look, duh!  So Nicole
stormed the place where the computers lived and found only one
computer geek present.  "You."</p>
<p>The girl sitting at the computer looked up at the short blonde who
had just addressed her.  She had never seen the girl before, so she
had no idea why on Earth she was addressing her.  "Um.yes?"</p>
<p>"Listen up computer geek, I have a little job for you."</p>
<p>"Huh?"  The girl sitting at the computer asked confused."</p>
<p>"Oh don't give me that, I'll pay cash so don't act dumb.All I want
you to do is make up one of your little internet things and e-mail to
the school list.got it."  Nicole asked in her normal controlling
tones.</p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"Good.here."  Nicole thrust a piece of paper with what she wanted
done at the girl and then turned to storm out of the room.  "Oh, I
don't pay until I see results."  And with that she left.</p>
<p>Willow looked down at the piece of paper that had been thrust at her,
and cursed herself for not leaving when Buffy had asked them to.
Reading over the words her brows furrowed as she read what the girl
wanted to do to Faith.  She wasn't Faith biggest fan, by no means,
but it just didn't seem right to out someone like that.  A wicked
little smile lit up Willow's face and she logged onto the net, she
had the perfect plan to show the person (who from what she could tell
made Cordelia look like May Poppins) who was just there a thing or
two.</p>
