<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-Five: Seek And Destroy -->

<p>***Kennedy High; hallways***</p>
<p>Buffy made her way through the unfamiliar hallways of Kennedy High,
noting how much bigger it was than Sunnydale High.  She was glad no
one had stopped her so far asking what she was doing in the school
before classes were even out, and she was just as glad she hadn't
seen Faith, or rather, Faith hadn't seen her.  She was on a mission,
find the blonde cheerleader, destroy the blonde cheerleader, simple
plan really.  Or so it seemed in her head, the trick was to actually
find her.</p>
<p>Buffy was starting to get upset with her lack of progress when she
heard her name being called.  Turning Buffy saw just the person she
had been looking for.  "Hi.Buffy right?  Your Faith's friend?"
Brooke asked as she approached.</p>
<p>"That's me.  And you're Brooke." They stood in awkward silence for a
few seconds.  Brooke trying to figure out why Buffy had a very, very
predatory look on her face, and Buffy trying to figure out why she
hadn't put the second part of her plan into action now that she had
found the (undoubtedly) evil cheerleader.</p>
<p>"So um, what brings you here to Kennedy?"  Brooke finally asked
dispelling the silence that had settle so uncomfortably around them.</p>
<p>Buffy thought fast, "I was just looking for Faith, she forgot her
lunch money."  `Oh yeah smooth Summers.'</p>
<p>For some unknown (to Buffy anyway) reason Brooke smirked.  "Well we
wouldn't want her to go with out lunch now would we."  She said in a
mock serious tone.  Brooke's eyes widened and she was suddenly
pulling a confused Buffy into the Novak.  "Sorry, that was our
principal."  Brooke explained seeing the question in Buffy's eyes.
Buffy looked around the bathroom, it was nice, a couch and
everything.  This place was starting to make SHS look like a ghetto
school.  Brooke cleared her throat to get Buffy's attention and then
asked, "ok, so what are you really doing here?"</p>
<p>Not being able to think of a lie on the spot (she had always sucked
at that) she told the truth.  "Looking for you actually."  The
statement lacked the malice she had wanted to put in for some
reason.  Mentally she chastened herself.</p>
<p>Brooke looked stunned for a second and then smiled, "so you found
me."  She let the rest of the statement hang, hoping Buffy would fill
in just why she would be looking for her.  When no answers from the
shorter blonde were forthcoming Brooke sighed, "Buffy."</p>
<p>Whatever Brooke was going to say was cut off as Nicole came into the
Novak, not noticing Buffy at first she greeted her friend, "Brookie,
what are you doing?"  Brooke's eyes went to Buffy and Nicole looked
over noticing her for the first time, "hello."  Nicole stated icily.</p>
<p>Brooke thought up a suitably reasonable reason for her to be in the
Novak talking to Buffy and then said to Nicole, "this is Buffy.she
wants to join the Glamazons."  She mentally patted herself on the
back for her lie.  Buffy did, after all, look like the perfect high
school cheerleader.  Buffy raised her eyebrows at the lie but didn't
bother to correct it; she figured if nothing else this would be
amusing.</p>
<p>"Really?"  Nicole asked, making a more thorough inspection of the
blonde.  The idea of making Mary Cherry lower on the food chain
filtered into her mind.  She smirked, "set up a try out?"  </p>
<p>The question was directed to Brooke who looked back at Buffy, who
answered for her, "this afternoon."  </p>
<p>"Good."  Nicole nodded and then walked out after saying goodbye to
Brooke.</p>
<p>Brooke and Buffy stared at each other for a second, neither knowing
why they lied, or what was going to happen next, but the thought of
spending time together wasn't exactly appalling, to either of
them.  `So much for that plan,' Buffy thought to herself as she
stared at the slightly taller blonde.</p>
