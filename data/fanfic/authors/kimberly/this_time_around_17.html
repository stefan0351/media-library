<!-- This Time Around \ Part Seventeen: Some Late Night Sisterly Advice -->

<p>***The Palace; Brooke's room***</p>
<p>Brooke awoke with a start. At first she couldn't tell what had woken
her up. But then she heard.ok she didn't know what she was hearing.
It almost sounded like someone in pain. Creeping out her of her bed
she stood in the middle of the room tying to discern where the sound
was coming from. Walking over to the door that led into the bathroom
the sound got louder. As she opened her door she saw that the other
door, the one leading to Sam's room was already opened. She walked
into Sam's room and saw her tossing and turning in bed, obviously in
the throws of a nightmare.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke shook the girl slightly. Sam's eyes opened wide and
she shot up in bed, a scream dying in her throat. She fell back onto
the bed and curled up into a tight little ball and started sobbing.
To say the least, Brooke was scared. She had never seen Sam like
this. The girl was terrified; Brooke had never even seen Sam scared,
more or less like this. "Sammy, what's wrong, talk to me?" Brooke
begged, trying to get Sam to uncurl herself.</p>
<p>"She wasn't there." Sam let out in a choked whisper. "She wasn't
there." She repeated throwing herself into a very surprised Brooke's
arms. </p>
<p>Brooke lay with her back leaning on the pillows; Sam curled up in her
arms, and let her finish crying before she gently asked. "Who,
Sammy, who wasn't there?" The question only served to make Sam cry
harder. Brooke started rocking the girl back and forth gently.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later Sam calmed down and explained to Brooke
everything that had been going on in her head lately. "I've been
dreaming about her.Faith. Last night I dreamed we were in a grave
yard, although I didn't know why. Something attacked us, but she
saved me, protected me, held me. I felt so safe in her arms Brooke,
I haven't felt that safe in someone's arms since my dad died. But
tonight.she wasn't there. I was so scared, and then.it.jumped out
again, just like last night. But she wasn't there." Sam was gently
sobbing into Brooke's shoulder, just repeating over and over
again, "she wasn't there." </p>
<p>Brooke's heart was breaking for her soon to be sister. She hadn't
even realized Sam like girls, and now she was being crushed by one,
who wasn't even doing it on purpose. "Sammy." Brooke waited till
Sam's head looked up at her before she continued, "you have to tell
her Sammy. You're falling in love with her, you have to tell her."</p>
<p>"I can't." Sam responded. Her tone of voice making Brooke's heart
break a little more for the girl, who was obviously in so much pain
right now. "She'll hate me."</p>
<p>Brooke allowed a smile to cross her face. "Some how I doubt that
Sammy. But the only way you'll ever find out is if you tell her. It
can't hurt any worse, right? If she hated you?"</p>
<p>Sam thought about it. Really thought about it. And the answer she
came up with was that nothing could hurt more than what it did now.
With a new resolve to tell Faith everything Sam fell asleep in her
sister's comforting arms. The wry question, "who woulda though?" on
her mind as she drifted off into a dreamless sleep.</p>
