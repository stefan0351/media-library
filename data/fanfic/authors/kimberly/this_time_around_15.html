<!-- This Time Around \ Part Fifteen: Dreaming Of Leather Angels, Again -->

<p>***The Palace; Sam's room***</p>
<p>Sam was dreaming was dreaming of Faith again. It wasn't a club this
time, and they weren't dancing. No this dream was weirder. They
were in a cemetery, just walking around. It was night and dream Sam
noticed how the moon's light made dream Faith even more beautiful,
enhancing her dark features. Still though, she couldn't figure out
why, or how even, they had ended up walking around in a cemetery. It
freaked her out, but at the same time she felt completely safe with
dream Faith by her side.</p>
<p>Hearing a noise she did a 360, but saw nothing. Her back was to
dream Faith, and dream Faith's strong arms wrapped around dream her's
midsection, holding her close. "Scared?" It was the first time
dream Faith had said anything. Her low tone, spoken so close to her
sensitive ear, sent shivers through her body. She didn't answer
though; instead she just leaned back and put her head on Faith's
shoulder, letting the just slightly taller girl support her weight.</p>
<p>She heard the noise again, but didn't even flinch, she felt to warm,
safe, to even begin to care. So when someone, or something jumped
out at them she was more than a little freaked. Faith took her arms
back and fought the creature, finally driving what looked like a
wooden stake into it's heart. The.thing.exploded into a cloud of
dust and dream Faith turned those oh so dark eyes on her. Dream
Faith held out her hand for dream Sam to take, and although she knew
she should be freaked a little more by what had just happened, she
took the hand, she would follow dream Faith, and the real one,
anywhere.</p>
<p>Anywhere just happened to be her bedroom. Dream her and Faith
climbed silently through the window and then just stood there in the
center of her floor, looking at each other. Dream Faith reached out
and pulled dream her close, pressing oh so soft lips to her own. The
room started to spin, her knees threatened to buckle. When dream
Faith's hand crept down her back to the top of her ass, her knees did
buckle, but just as she knew she would, dream Faith's arms caught
her. And the carried her over to the bed, laying her gently on top
of the soft covers.</p>
<p>Dream Faith lay so that she was half on and half off of dream Sam,
reclaiming her lips. Dream Faith's hands were roaming all over her
body, and she swore that she could really feel them on her body. And
then dream Faith.BUZZZZZ.Sam's arm shot out and smacked her alarm
clock.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!"</p>
