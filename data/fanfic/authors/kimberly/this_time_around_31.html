<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-One: The Morning After (Sam and Faith) -->

<p>***The Palace; Sam's Room*** </p>

<p>Faith woke up with the most comfortable weight against her, opening
her eyes she saw Sam curled up right next to her, head pillowed on
her shoulder.  Smiling she kissed to the top of Sam head, her smile
growing larger as Sam mumbled something and burrowed further into
her.  Faith's heart swelled with the love she felt for the gorgeous
brunette next to her.  She knew now that she had never know love
before, what she had felt for others was nothing compared to what she
felt for Sam.</p>

<p>Sam mumbled again and stretched out like a lazy cat, grinning she
leaned up and pecked Faith on the cheek, earning a smile in
return.  "Morning."  Faith said softly, putting her arms around Sam
just a little tighter.</p>

<p>Sam peaked open one eye, glanced at the clock, and corrected
Faith, "afternoon.  Good thing it's Saturday, or we'd be really late."</p>

<p>"So what do you want to do today?"  Faith asked, nuzzling the top of
Sam's head, her hands wondering over Sam's body under the covers.</p>

<p>"Mmmm.this."  Sam answered as she rolled on top of Faith and smiled
down at her.  Giving her a real good morning kiss (at least five
minutes in length) she moved further down so that she could rest her
head on Faith's chest and listen to her heart pounding in her chest.
Faith wrapped her arms around the warm bundle of Sam lying on top of
her and grinned like crazy (as people are known to do after making
love).  Simultaneously Faith and Sam's stomachs grumbled at them,
demanding to be fed.  "Guess that means we have to get up."  Sam
said, although her voice seriously lacked the conviction to actually
do what she proposed.</p>

<p>"Yup."  Faith agreed, sounding way more chipper than she had ever
before in her life.  When she noticed the Sam was making no move to
actually get up she lifted her girlfriend in her arms and deposited
the shocked girl on the floor next to the bathroom door.  "What?"
Faith asked to the totally shocked statement on Sam's face.</p>

<p>"I knew you were strong, but I didn't know you were that strong."
Sam answered in awe.  </p>

<p>"Slayer strength."  Faith answered nonchalantly, without even
thinking about it.</p>

<p>Sam raised an eyebrow, "slayer strength?  What's that?"  Realizing
her mistake Faith grinned (hoping Sam wouldn't notice she wasn't
answering) and kissed her soundly (Sam didn't notice the lack of
answer).</p>

<p>"Shower and breakfast?"  Faith asked wiggling her eyebrows
suggestively.  Sam grinned and pushed Faith into the bathroom while
seeking her lips with her own. </p>
