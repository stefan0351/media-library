<!-- This Time Around \ Part Fourty-Three: Sneaking Out, And Sneaking In -->

<p>***The Palace***</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith stood at the foot of the Palace
looking up at the darkened rooms of their lovers.
Patrol had been...interesting.  To say the least there
wasn't a vamp or demon in 100 miles that wasn't
wincing at the slaughter that had come of their
brethern.  Everything evil they came across since they
left Faith's house that day was taken out with
precision that would have left even the watcher's
council proud of the slaying duo.  As it were, they
were currently trying to find a way up, without
getting caught preferably, to see how the fallout with
Mike had gone.  Buffy in particular was worried, she
had prayed all afternoon that Mike didn't hurt Brooke.</p>

<p>Finally deciding that the rain gutter would be the
easiest, and quickest way up without disturbing
anyone, they climbed up and entered Sam's room.  Faith
used her slayer senses and found that her girlfriend
wasn't in the room.  So she decided to follow Buffy
into Brooke's room to see if her lover was in there
with her sister.  Brooke's room was just as empty.
"Shit."  Buffy cursed softy, then looked to Faith for
what to do next.  They had no idea where their
girlfriends could be, but none of the things swiming
around their heads were any good.</p>

<p>"Come on lets go back to my place and we'll figure
something out.  They're fine."  The younger slayer
protested with way more conviction than she actually
felt at the moment.</p>

<p>***Faith and Nadia's House***</p>

<p>Sam climbed up the ladder that Faith kept connected to
her window so she didn't have to wake Nadia when she
had a late patrol, quickly followed by Brooke.  After
Brooke had finally calmed down after her father's
announcement Sam had suggested they do the normal
teenage thing and sneak out.  The idea seemed perfect.
 No way they'd be caught.</p>

<p>They toppeled into Faith's room, a little louder than
they were going for, but not being slayers they
weren't quite as stealthy.  Sam flicked on the room
light and saw that her girlfriend was no where to be
seen.  They went down the hall to the guestroom Buffy
was staying in and found it likewise.  "Maybe they're
out on patrol or something."  Sam suggested.  </p>

<p>Brooke's shoulders slumped slightly, "with they way
today is going it figures."</p>

<p>"Hey I'm sure they had a lot of energy to use up, I
mean for a minute there today I though Buffy was going
to attack Mike, but she held back, for you.  So you
know, major energy, and probably the need to hit
something."  Sam said with a slight grin.</p>

<p>"You're right, I guess we should just wait here for
them?"  Brooke asked.  She was all too happy to let
Sam be the ringleader here, afterall Sam was the one
with sneaking out experience.</p>

<p>"Guess so, let's go wait in Faith's room, she has a
huge stash of candy hidden in there."</p>

<p>Faith and Buffy climbed up the ladder to Faith's room.
 They were tired from all the slaying, and just plain
emotionally spent after worrying about Brooke and Sam
all the way home.  Faith swore that if Mike had done
anything to Sam...or even Brooke she would go back on
her no killing humans rule and rip him a couple new
holes.  Faith noticed the light on in her bedroom and
a flickering light, she pulled out her stake, and then
thought better of it.  It couldn't be a vamp unless
Nadia had let it in, and that wasn't likely, she was a
parinoid old woman sometimes.  She pulled out the
knife that she kept in her boot and motioned to Buffy
to back her up.</p>

<p>With a speed and agility that only a slayer could
possess Faith sprang throught her window and grabbed
the first body she camn in contact with.  She grabbed
it by the neck and put the knife there to make sure it
didn't think about moving, at all.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Brooke had just gotten up to throw her now empty soda
can away when something came through the window and
grabbed her in the dark.  She didn't have any time to
do...well anything.  As soon as the figure had her she
could feel the cold steel pressed against her neck.
She prayed for Buffy.</p>

<p>Sam, with the light of the TV, saw Brooke being
grabbed and took up the crossbow that Faith kept by
the bed just in case.  She aimed at the figure that
was holding her sister hostage.  The light of the TV
cast an eerie glow on the room.  Buffy was the first
to see through her adrenninalin and see that Sam was
holding a crossbow at Faith.  Through her fight filled
mind she reconized that that was just a little wrong.</p>

<p>Buffy cautiously walked over to the light and flicked
in on.  "Faith!"  "Brooke!" "Sam!" "Buffy!"  Was
yelled by the girls simotaneously.</p>

<p>With a look of fear at what she had almost done Faith
let her hand drop, and released Brooke.  "Oh, Jesus,
I'm so sorry...I saw the light and thought demons, or
somthing...god I'm so sorry Brooke!"  Faith
apoligised.  Sam lowered her crossbow and shook her
head, they had all almost killed each other.  She
could just see the headlines now.</p>

<p>"That's ok...we should have known better than to break
into a slayers bedroom."  Brooke said with her head
burried in Buffy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You ok?"  Buffy asked the blonde head nessled in the
crook of her arm.  And she wasn't just talking about
being attacked by Faith, although she knew first had
that that could be quite tramatic.</p>

<p>"Yes...can we goto your room now?"  Came the muffled
responce.  Wordlessly Buffy led Brooke to the spare
bedroom where she had taken up occupancy.</p>

<p>"This is just WAY to much excietment for one day."
Sam said flopping down on the bed.</p>

<p>Faith smirked, "well at least we know your crossbow
lessons are paying off, you could have taken my head
off there, easily."  Sam gave Faith a 'don't go there
look'.  "So what are you two doing breaking and
entering anyway?"  Faith's eyes narrowed, "not to
mention eating all my candy?"</p>

<p>With a sheepish smile Sam answered, "we wanted to see
you guys."</p>

<p>Faith chuckled at how all there minds seemed to think
alike.  "Well it just so happens we were held up
breaking into your bedroom, to find it empty."  </p>

<p>Sam got up and put her arms around Faith's neck, "you
came to see me?"</p>

<p>"I was worried."</p>

<p>"Don't be."  Sam leaned in and claimed Faith's lips in
a gentle kiss.  Faith's hands came up to rest on Sam's
hips, and she used her hold to pull the slightly
shorter girl closer to her.  "Make love to me Faith."
Sam said when the kiss broke.  Faith was all too happy
to comply.  She gently picked Sam up and carried her
to the bed, laying her down with the utmost care.</p>

<p>Faith slid her hands under Sam's shirt and slid it up,
pulling it over Sam's head, exposing her braless chest
to Faith's hungry gaze.  With a soft smile Faith bent
down so that her eager mouth could take a happy nipple
into the warm confines of her mouth.  While she was
suckling Sam's breast Faith's hands moved down and
started working on the buttons to Sam's pants.
Finally getting the damn things unbuttoned and
unzipped, Faith with patient help of Sam, slid them
off the lither body beneath her.  "You are so
beautiful."  Faith uttered in revernce before her
mouth found other tasks to keep busy with.</p>

<p>Sam arched her body into Faith's talented touch and
started about shedding Faith of her cloths.  After a
few frustrating minutes gloriously naked body touched
equally gloriously naked body.  Faith slid her hands
into Sam's, and then pressed her lips to Sam's own,
their hips starting a rhythm of grinding.  Normally
just the slight friction wouldn't be enough to make
either girl fall over the edge, but tonight, just
their bodies pressed tightly to each other, was
enough.  Together they reached heights unimaginable,
and tumbled over into oblivion...together.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Down the hall Brooke was comfortably nessled in
Buffy's arms, relating what had happened with her
father.  And the rule about Faith and Buffy not being
seen in the house.  Buffy was really REALLY glad they
hadn't been caught earlier, that really would have
been bad.  As it were Buffy held Brooke through the
tears, and comforted her when her own heart had a
sinking feeling in it.</p>

<p>After Brooke had told everything that happened, up
until the time Faith attacked her accidently, Buffy
leaned down and kissed Brooke's temple.  She left
little kisses from there to Brooke's waiting lips, and
then back up the other side.  Without either uttering
a word they shed their cloths and began the wonderful
dance of making love.</p>

<p>Comfortably sated in each other's sleeping arms later
that night both girls dreamed of the future, and just
prayed that there was one for them.</p>
