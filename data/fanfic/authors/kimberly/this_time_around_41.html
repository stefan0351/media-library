<!-- This Time Around \ Part Fourty-One: Worry Wort -->

<p>***Faith and Nadia's house; Faith's room***</p>

<p>Faith paced the floor.  Buffy paced the floor.  Faith
and Buffy paced the floor.  It was definitly a sight
to see.  Perfect syncronization.  When Faith turned,
Buffy turned, only difference was they were always
walking in different directions.  Both were worried.
Buffy was worried about what Brooke's dad was going to
do when he got back.  And Faith was worried about Sam.
 Faith knew that if Mike started somthing with Brooke
that Sam would jump in to assist Brooke, it was just
the type of friend Sam was.</p>

<p>They were worried about their girls, and so...they
paced.  Faith, at least, had the bennifit of getting
to see Sam everyday at school.  Buffy would have to
wait longer to see Brooke.  It was hard for them to
sit back and do nothing.  They were slayers after all,
they should be able to protect the ones they loved.
But how do you protect someone you love, from someone
they love.  Can you?  </p>

<p>"You don't think he'll really  hurt her do you?"
Buffy asked out of nowhere, not stopping her pacing at
all.</p>

<p>Faith, who didn't stop either, answered, "no...doesn't
seem the type...plus don't think Jane or Sam will let
him."  Buffy nodded, she seemed pacified for the time
being.  But still they paced.  It was still hours till
dark, but both girls were in the mood to slay.  At the
same time they stopped their pacing, looked at each
other, and said, "sewers!"  Perfect sycronization, the
chosen two, slayers.  Togther they grabbed some stakes
and headed out to kill some dead things.</p>
