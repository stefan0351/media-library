<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Three: The Breakfast From Hell -->

<p>***The Palace; Kitchen***</p>

<p>Buffy and Brooke were already in the kitchen when Faith and Sam
walked in hand in hand.  No one looked anyone else in the eye as they
silently fixed bowls of cereal for breakfast.  Sam sat in her usual
seat at the table with Faith next to her, gripping her hand under the
table for comfort.  Brook also sat at her usual spot, Buffy next to
her.  Neither set of girls looked up from their cereal bowls as they
ate.  It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  Finally Faith broke
the silence, "as far as awkward moments go, this takes the cake."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, we had no idea you guys were in there, together,
doing that.and oh my god I'm sorry and we didn't mean to honest, and
it will NEVER happen again I swear!"  Brook babbled, her face bright
red.</p>

<p>Faith looked at Buffy and smirked, "she could give Red a run for her
money in the babble department."  Buffy smirked fondly at Brooke and
put her hand on Brooke's thigh under the table.</p>

<p>"Yup."  Brooke (if it was possible) turned brighter red.</p>

<p>"Guess you guys had fun last night then."  Faith continued, smirk
never leaving her face.  After all she wasn't one to be shy about
sex, and now that the whole thing was at least half an hour behind
them, she could look back and laugh.</p>

<p>Buffy's smirk got more mischievous, "yup."  (Brooke couldn't have
gotten redder if she tried)</p>

<p>"Can we all just move on and forget this ever happened.please."
Brooke begged, looking each of the other girls in the eye (finally).</p>

<p>"Hmmm.I don't know.Samantha?"  Faith asked teasingly.</p>

<p>Picking up on Faith teasing Sam smiled and looked at Brooke, "I don't
know, it was kinda one of those unforgettable moments, burned into
the brain and all that."  Brooke moaned and buried her head in
Buffy's shoulder, "hey that doesn't mean we want a replay."  Sam
teased acting traumatized.</p>

<p>"This is never going to be lived down," Brooke mumbled into Buffy's
neck.  The rest of the girls present chuckled.  It kinda disturbed
Brooke that she was the only one that seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p>"So what are your plans for the day?"  Faith asked, giving Brooke a
reprieve (for now anyway).</p>

<p>"Well we can mark being traumatized off the `to do list'."  Buffy
stated cheekily.  Playing along Faith made a little check mark in the
air.  "After that, no plans have been made yet, how about you guys?"
Buffy asked, glad there were no hard feelings between anyone present,
and that Faith didn't seem mad that just days earlier she had gone
after her and now she was sitting here with Brooke.</p>

<p>Faith looked to Sam asking the same question silently, receiving a
shrug she looked back to the blonde duo, "I dunno."</p>

<p>"We could all avoid each other."  Brooke mumbled piteously from
Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>"Hey don't mom and Mike get back today?"  Sam asked.  Receiving a nod
she continued, "ok I vote on outside the house activities.  We could
go back to the park."  Sam suggested to Faith, wiggling her eyebrows.
Faith chuckled at her girlfriend's antics.  </p>

<p>"I don't know, being caught in compromising positions twice in 24
hours, don't think we should risk it."  Sam pouted playfully back at
her and Faith leaned over and gave her a quick gentle kiss on the
lips.  "You're cute when you pout."  Sam smiled back at her and then
remembered Buffy and Brooke were in the room (and watching
them).  "Movies?"</p>

<p>"Dark theater, back row, no one paying any attention to anyone else."
Buffy said pretending to think it over; looking at Brooke's slightly
glazed eyes she answered, "sounds like fun."  The four finalized
their plans and went about rest of their day (Brooke never did stop
blushing).</p>
