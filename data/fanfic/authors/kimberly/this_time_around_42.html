<!-- This Time Around \ Part Fourty-Two: Give A Little, Take A Little -->

<p>***The Palace; Sam's room***</p>

<p>Sam was sitting on her bed thinking about the
crazziness that had occured earlier.  Everything was
going insane and she had no way to stop it.  At least
her mom took it in stride, like she did with
practically everything.  But Mike...dude was crazy.
Of all the things that Sam had planned up to break her
mom and Mike up in the beginning she never would have
dreamed that this would be the straw that broke the
cammles back.  And what a stupid reason too.  But it
would be enough, Sam knew, if her mom was willing to
let her and Brooke live their lives, and Mike wasn't
it would be somthing that would come between them.
And down that road lied divorce court.</p>

<p>Sam didn't want that, anymore.  She knew first had
what it was like to not have both parents, and
although her baby sister's dad wouldn't have died, it
wouldn't be the same as having two loving parents in
the home.  And it would be her and Brooke's fault.  </p>

<p>Sam was knocked out of her musings by a knock on the
door.  Thinking it was either her mom or Brooke she
opened the door without asking who was there.  Mike
stood in front of her, looking kind of scared.  Of
her.  It was almost comical.  Almost.  "Can I...I
wanted to talk to you and Brooke...together..."  Mike
said while playing with the carpet using the toe of
his shoe.  he looked like a little kid asking
permission to go out and play.</p>

<p>"Um...ok..."  Sam answered unsure, where was her mom
again?</p>

<p>Mike getting the answer he wanted walked down to
Brooke's room, Sam right next to him.  Brooke answered
the door and saw her father and Sam standing there.
She gave Sam a questioning look, Sam merely shrugged
her shoulders, she didn't know what was going on
either.  Sam and Brooke sat on Brooke's bed, while
Mike too the desk chair.  They all looked at each
other warily for a few minutes before Mike broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Brooke's anger flared, "sorry?!  For what exactly,
being a biggot, grabbing my arm, yelling at me and
telling me I'm not who I am, when you don't know?
What FATHER, what are you sorry for?!"</p>

<p>"All the above."  Mike answered.  "I won't lie and
tell you that I'm comfortable with you being...with
you seeing who you're seeing, but I can't not allow
it.  It wouldn't be right, I see that now, guess it
just took me by surprise, and the way I found
out...with time I hope that things will go back to
normal...well normal for here anyway."</p>

<p>Both Brooke and Sam were stunned, they hadn't expected
a complete 180 like that from Mike so quickly.  Their
suspesions were peaked, Mike was up to something, they
just didn't know what yet, of course neither was
willing to look a gift horse in the mouth.  If Mike
was saying he wouldn't argue to them seeing their
lovers, they weren't going to argue, nope not at all!
"Thanks."  Sam said to break the silence.</p>

<p>"But..."  There was just always a but wasn't there!
"I don't think I will be able to handle either of
those girls in my presence...you'll have to see them
elsewhere."  It was a reasonble request, Brooke knew,
but that didn't stop her heart from breaking.  The
Palace was about the only place she could be alone
with Buffy.  At least Sam got to see Faith at school.
Mike got up and walked out of the room.  </p>

<p>Brooke's eyes watered up, things had been fixed only
to be broken again.  Sam pulled the softly sobbing
blonde into her arms, and held her sister tightly.
She knew she would feel the same way if most of her
time with Faith had just been taken from her.  But
they would just have to work things out...spend more
time at Faith's place maybe...something.  Sam wasn't
usually an optimist, but in this case she knew,
without a doubt, that with two slayers, a jounalist,
and a cheerleader working together, things would turn
out ok.  They had to.</p>
