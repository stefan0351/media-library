<p>***Sunnydale; Magic Box***</p>
<p>"Um.Buffy?" Willow asked as she walked into the slayer's work out
room in the back of the Magic Box.</p>
<p>"Yeah Wills?" Buffy inquired back as she punched the bag one more
time before giving her bestest best bud all of her attention.</p>
<p>"There's a slight problem with Faith." Willow answered.</p>
<p>"How slight?" Buffy asked getting worried. She knew how much Faith
had changed, but that didn't mean she wouldn't screw up again.</p>
<p>"Someone is looking into her records and her past and stuff.I don't
know how long my firewalls will hold them off. Who ever it is, is
pretty good with a keyboard. This is bad Buffy. They could find
anything out, how her records are fake, or that she was in jail, or
that she's the slayer.anything." Willow babbled on.</p>
<p>Buffy listened intently and then did something Willow really wasn't
expecting. The slayer smiled. Willow sighed; she knew she wasn't
going to like this, nope, not at all. "Road trip." Buffy said
happily. Yup, she knew it, didn't like it one bit.</p>
