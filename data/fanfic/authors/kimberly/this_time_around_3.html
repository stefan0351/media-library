<!-- This Time Around \ Part Three: Meeting Mr. Ditzy -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Mr. Krupp's office***</p>
<p>When Faith finally got to the school and found a safe looking place
to park her bike it was about time to meet the principal. All she
had to do was find the office first. Looking around her at the
various other students she noticed that over half of them were blonde
girls, `great perfect place to forget about B.' Faith spotted a
friendly enough looking face and asked, "you know where Krupp's
office is?"</p>
<p>Carmen looked at the girl in front of her. She looked like she just
stepped off a movie set where she played the `bad girl'. Stunning
but scary looking. Since the girl was now staring at her like she
was mentally retarded she figured she should answer. "Oh.um.yeah."
She pointed in a direction, "that way.big sign, can't miss it."</p>
<p>Faith looked in the direction the mentally challenged girl
pointed. "Yeah thanks." Heading off she noticed that the girl ran
to a small group of people, and before she knew it she was being
pointed at. Now the reasons she quit school the first time all came
back to her. Sighing Faith opened the door to the office and walked
in, telling the secretary that she had an appointment and then
sitting down until she was called.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of just sitting there a cute guy walked out
of the office and waved for her to come in. Faith got up and walked
in, sitting down when the guy motioned for her to. "So Ms Spencer,
nice to meet you." Krupp said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, right, nice to meet you Mr. Krupp."</p>
<p>"Please call me Calvin."</p>
<p>Faith looked at the way to cheerful guy, "right, Calvin.why am I here
again?" She knew that not all new students had been called in. Idly
she wondered just what Red put in those files; maybe she should
actually read them when she got back to Nadia's house.</p>
<p>Calvin Krupp looked down at the file he had in front of him. "Well.I
thought since the school you attended in Boston was a small catholic
school, it would be nice to have someone show you around." </p>
<p>`Small catholic school, way to go Red.' "Really that's not necc."
Faith trailed off as a brunette head poked into office.</p>
<p>"You wanted to see me?" Sam asked a little fearful. It was the
first day of school; she knew she hadn't done anything in the ten
whole minutes she had been here, at least she didn't think she had.
Then she noticed the girl sitting at the desk, "oh I'm sorry I didn't
know anyone was in here with you, they told me to come on in." Sam
said pointing an accusing finger at the secretaries. </p>
<p>"No, no please come in. Sam McPherson meet Faith Spencer. You're
going to be her tour guide for a few days, till she gets the layout
of the school and all." </p>
<p>Sam sighed, the last thing she wanted to do was play tour guide to
some new kid, but she didn't want to be on the bad side of the
principal either. So grudgingly she said, "fine." And motioned for
Faith to follow her out.</p>
<p>"Have a nice day ladies." Krupp said cheerfully.</p>
