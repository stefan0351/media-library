<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Nine: Coming Out -->

<p>***The Palace; Kitchen Table***<br>
***Two weeks later***</p>

<p>Brooke, Faith, Sam, and Buffy all sat around the table eating lunch
in companionable silence.  No one was in any rush to end the
peacefulness.  But the knock on the door did it for them.  Sighing
Sam got up to answer the door, she saw Carmen and Harrison standing
there, both looking nervous.  "Hey Sam."  Carmen greeted in her 'way
too cheerful cause somethings wrong' voice.  Sam sighed, she could
just imagine what this was going to be about.</p>

<p>"Hey guys, come on in."  Sam led them to the table where she sat back
down next to Faith, then looked at her friend questionably as they
just stood there looking between each other and the other people
assembled.  "What's up?"  Sam finally asked to get them started.  </p>

<p>"Um...there was kinda somthing we wanted to tell you...and we don't
want you to get mad or anything like that...we weren't planning on
telling everyone, but hey everyone's already here, and ..."  Carmen
babbled on, staying as far away from her point as she could.</p>

<p>The four girls at the table exchanged glances.  At first Sam would
have sworn that they were there to tell them that they knew about her
and Faith's relationship, but now she wasn't so sure.</p>

<p>Harrison in a bold move reached out and took Carmen's hand, which
seemed to calm her down.  "Sam you've been my best friend forever,
and we've all been friends, you, I, Lily, and Carmen for as long as I
can remember...so we wanted to tell you that..."</p>

<p>"We're together."  Carmen blurted out before Harrison could say it.
Then shrinked back waiting for an outburst...that never came.</p>

<p>"Congratulations."  Sam said calmly, whith a smile on her face.</p>

<p>"Really?"  Harrison and Carmen asked in unison, both shocked that
there was no outburst, they had expected an outburst, prepared for an
outburst, they just didn't know what to do without the outburst.</p>

<p>"Yes really."  Sam said as she got up and hugged first Harrison, and
then Carmen.  She turned to look at Faith, "don't they make a cute
couple honey?"</p>

<p>Faith smirked, knowing that Sam had been dreading coming out to her
friends, and in a round about way she just had.  "Adorable."  Faith
said in an easy drawl, not arguing when Sam moved over and sat in her
lap.</p>

<p>"Definitly congratulations," Brooke added, "and cute too."  Brooke
leaned back into Buffy's body, but remain in her own chair.  Buffy's
arms wrapped around her and she smiled at the shocked faces of
Harrison and Carmen.  </p>

<p>"You...you...and...you...you?"  Harrison spluttered, hundreds of past
wet dreams coming up in his mind.</p>

<p>"Yup."  Came the answer from all four seated girls at once.</p>

<p>Carmen narrowed her eyes at her friends, "so that's what Lily
meant..."  Sam raised an eyebrown in silent question as to just what
Lily had said.  The day Lily and Josh had caught her and Faith
necking in the park still fresh in her mind.  "She said that you had
found your faith in loving someone again...now I know what she
meant."  Everyone gave a little chuckle at the pun but didn't say
anything.  Faith squeezed Sam a little in silent acknowlegement that
she too had found her faith in love again (bad pun or not).</p>

<p>"You...you...and...you...you?"  Harrison repeated, suddenly thinking
that he'd like to be alone with Carmen for an hour to do...stuff.</p>

<p>"It's ok honey...calm down."  Carmen said smiling at her new
boyfriend.  "I think you broke my boyfriend."  She said playfully to
the girls at the table.</p>

<p>"Well by all means take him home and fix him."  Faith said while
raising her eyebrows up and down.  Carmen blushed at the innuendo,
but grabbed Harrison by the hand and led him out none the less.</p>

<p>When they were gone Sam sighed, "now all we have to do is tell mom
and Mike."</p>

<p>"And school."  Brooke added, they both shuddered at that thought.
There was no way Nicole was going to let them live easy lives with it
out in the open.  Brooke could kiss her throan to Kennedy High
goodbye.  Buffy suddenly got images of Cordelia walking through the
halls after it came out that she was with Xander, she had held her
head high and was proud still.  She wondered if Brooke would do that
for her, be proud.</p>

<p>"Small steps Brooke...today our friends...the real ones at
least...tomorrow, or later even the rest of the world."  Sam said,
wiggling in Faith's lap to get a more comfortable spot.</p>

<p>"If you don't stop that right now I'm gonna take you right here,"
Faith whispered in Sam's ear.  Sam's eyes got wide and she hopped up
off Faith's lap.</p>

<p>"Um...we have to go upstairs...now!"  With that she grabbed Faith had
and practically dragged the smirking girl with her.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?"  Brooke wondered out loud after she heard
Sam's door slam shut upstairs.</p>

<p>Buffy chuckled, thanks to slayer hearing she knew what it was all
about, but she didn't think Brooke would apreaciate knowing what her
step-sister was doing right now.  "Who knows with those two."</p>

<p>Brooke stood up and then straddled Buffy's lap so that she was facing
the back of the chair and looking right into the blue-green eyes of
her girlfriend, "well I know what I wouldn't mind doing right now..."</p>

<p>"Really what's that?"  Buffy asked in her most innocent voice as
Brooke started to nibble on her ear.  "Go out for ice cream?"  Brooke
smiled and shooke her head 'no', and started to nibble the other
ear.  "Catch a movie?"  Again Brooke answered in the negative, now
her lips attached to Buffy's neck.  "Go ice skating?"</p>

<p>"If you don't take me upstairs and make love to me now I may have to
go take care of this need on my own."  Brooke growled playfully as
she slipped her hands under Buffy's shirt.  Smirking, and without
making Brooke move, Buffy stood them up and carried Brooke to her
room.  Where the muffled sounds from Sam's room gave evidence to what
they were doing.  Once in Brooke's room Buffy laid Brooke out on the
bed and began the oh so lovely process of making love to the gorgous
blonde.</p>

<p>Mike and Jane walked into the quiet house with Mac held in Jane's
arms.  "It's too quiet."  Was the first think out of Mike's mouth.</p>

<p>"Don't be so cynicle, the girls have been getting along great
lately."  Jane said as she bounced the girgling baby in her arms a
few times.</p>

<p>Mike smiled, "you're right, come on, lets go let them know we're
home."  Walking up the stairs together Jane stopped at her daughter's
door as Mike walked further down the hall to Brooke's door, and at
the same time walked into their daughter's rooms, without knocking.
And at the same time screamed and ran back out into the hall.  Mike
looked down the hall at Jane, as she looked back at him, then they
walked back downstairs to sit on the couch and wait for Brooke and
Sam to come down.</p>

<p>A very mortified Brook, Sam, Faith, and Buffy met in the
hallway.  "What is it with people walking in on us when we're
doing...stuff?"  Sam whined.</p>

<p>"Time to face the music?"  Brooke asked looking to her step-sister
for confirmation, half hoping that Sam suggest they climb out the
window and go hide.</p>

<p>"So much for waiting till tomorrow or later," Sam grumbled as she
headed the procession down the stairs.  This was one conversation she
was SO not looking forward to.  And the way it was coming about
wasn't how she had hoped either.  Oh well, when life gives you
lemmons...much a pucker face, 'cause you're screwed!</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Sam, Faith, Brooke, and Buffy sat on the couch facing
Mike and Jane.  They had put Mac to bed just in case
there was yelling, Mike predicted yelling, lots of it.
 But right now, there was no yelling, just silence.
Silence as they all sat and stared, the teenagers
stared at their shoes, and the parents stared at the
teenagers.  Everyone was still blushing, even
Faith...it had to bad if Faith was blushing.</p>

<p>"So..."  Jane tried to get the conversation started,
but she ran out of things to say after the initial
word.</p>

<p>"Just what in the hell was going on when we got
home?!"  There was the yelling.</p>

<p>Sam looked at her mother and step-father, "um...it's
not what it looks like?"  She asked hopefully.  Her
mother stared at her, it made her feel like a three
year old just caught stealing a cookie, but boy was
the 'cookie' worth it.</p>

<p>"Samantha McPhearson this is no time for being a
wise-ass."  Jane stated firmly.  "Now don't get me
wrong, I was a teenager once, and I know that
experimentation..."</p>

<p>Jane was cut off by Brooke, "we were'nt experimenting
mom."</p>

<p>Jane raised an eyebrow at her step-daughter, "and I
know that girls your age will experiment with
things...but THIS?!"</p>

<p>"This will NOT continue!"  Mike started firmly when
Jane stopped talking.</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes and resolve in her voice Sam
said, "you can't stop us, I love Faith, and I won't
stop because you don't want me to."</p>

<p>Mike started turning red.  "You listen here young
lady..."</p>

<p>Jane was the one to cut Mike off, "you love her?"  It
was a simple, softly spoken question.  Jane knew her
daughter well, she knew that it would take a lot for
her to admit love, hell Sam rarely even told her, her
MOTHER, that she loved her.  Sam had just built so
many walls after her father had died.</p>

<p>"Yes."  Sam stated looking right into her mother's
eyes so that she could see the truth in her own.  Mike
watched the silent exchange and knew that Sam had just
won her battle, but he would be damned if Brooke
would.</p>

<p>"Ok, but there are going to be rules, LOTS of rules."
Jane stated, she, Sam, and Faith would have to have a
long talk later.</p>

<p>"You're the best Jane," Brooke stated grabbing Buffy's
hand happily.</p>

<p>"HELL NO!"  Mike bellowed and flew from his chair,
yanking Brooke up from hers, and seperating her from
Buffy.  Brooke had never feared her father, but right
then, she had never been so scared in her life.  Not
even when faced with vampires.  "No daughter of mine
will..."</p>

<p>"MIKE!"  Jane yelled to her husband.  "Let her go."
Mike looked at his daughter, he could tell that his
grip was hurting her, at that moment he thought he was
going to be sick.</p>

<p>"Oh, god...Brooke, honey I'm sorry."  He released her
as he apoligised, she immediatly ran to Buffy and
stood behind the shorter girl.  Mike saw the hurt,
fear, and anger in his daughter's eyes, all emotions
he never thought he would evoke in his daughter, "what
have I done?"  Mike whispered to himself.  He still
thought it was wrong, what his daughter was doing with
another girl, but what he had just done was the
ultimate sin in his book.  Without another word Mike
left the house, got in his car, and left.  He needed
to think.  Confess.  Do something.</p>

<p>Brooke was crying softly as her father exited the
house and Buffy turned around to hold her girlfriend.
Buffy whispered soothing words into Brooke's ear as
she cried on her shoulder.  Sam and Faith watched
Jane's reaction closely, they hadn't ventured further
than holding hands.  Jane for her part looked
horrified at what Mike had done.  She knew her wasn't
the sort of man who would hurt his child, she wouldn't
have married him and brought her daughter into his
house if he was.</p>

<p>But she also knew that everyone had a limit.  And they
had just found Mike's, she just hoped that he came to
his senses before he lost Brooke.  And she couldn't
deny that Brooke and Buffy seemed to genuinly care for
each other.  It was obvious in the way they held each
other for support.  Jane looked at her daughter.
Sam's hand was firmly incased in Faith's, their
fingers entwined.  They seemed to glow, despite what
was happening around them.  And even if she wanted to,
Jane couldn't deny the love she saw in both girl's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Please, girls, sit down."  All four teens did as
asked.  Brooke rested her head on Buffy's shoulder,
still crying softy.  "He'll calm down, be back, and
apoligise.  I'll talk to him Brooke, I'm sure he'll
see things diferently once he gets a different veiw on
things.  And as I said there are going to be rules.
For starters, what we walked in on today will not
happen again, understood?"  Four heads, two blonde,
two brunette, nodded in the affirmitive.  "Good.  I
think it would be a good idea if Faith and Buffy
left."  Sam and Brooke both paled at the aspect of not
having their security blankets with them for when Mike
got back.  "I'm not saying you girls can't come back,
but for now I think it would be best if you weren't
here."</p>

<p>Faith looked over at Buffy, who nodded.  "Alright."
Faith knew she couldn't, but she'd be damned if she
left Sam without a kiss.  She leaned over and placed a
soft, loving kiss on Sam's cheeck.  "I'll see you at
school Samantha, ok?"  Sam nodded.  "Love you."</p>

<p>"I love you too Faith."  Sam said as Faith got up to
leave.  Faith waited for Buffy to pry herself loose
before she headed out.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to you later Brooke, I promise, I won't go
far.  I'll be right here if you need me, you know
that."  Brooke sniffled, but nodded.  "Bye, love."
Buffy gave Brooke a little kiss on the tip of her nose
and got up to join Faith.  Together they walked out of
the palace, worried about their girls.</p>
