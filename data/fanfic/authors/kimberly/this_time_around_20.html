<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty: A New Found Love -->

<p>***Park***</p>
<p>The day just flew by for Sam and Faith. They had decided to skip
rest of school and just be together, get to know everything about
each other, grope, you know what all new couples do. They left the
school on Faith's Harley, with Sam clutching to Faith for dear life,
and ended up at the city part, lounging underneath a big tree. Faith
was laid out on her back looking up at the clouds, head resting on
her hands, and Sam was resting her head on Faith's chest, her ear to
Faith's heart, so that she couldn't listen to the even rhythm.</p>
<p>"This is nice." Sam stated needlessly after a few moments of
silence. A comfortable silence at that. She decided she could die
right there and be a happy dead woman.</p>
<p>"Yup." Faith agreed. She couldn't remember a time that she had ever
been this happy. A rough childhood, followed closely by a rough
adolescence didn't add up too much happy time. But now, right now,
she was happy, content even. She wasn't restless waiting for night
(mental note: tell Sam about nightlife); she wasn't bouncing off the
walls (or trees as the case may be) waiting for something exciting to
do. Nope she was just restful. Comfortable. Content. And happy.
All things she couldn't ever remember being before, with anyone.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to work on that you know," Sam stated playfully.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Faith looked down at the dark head resting on her chest, and
the dark head turned to look back up at her.</p>
<p>"The length of your sentences of course. Can't have people thinking
I have all the brains in this relationship."</p>
<p>"Well I got all the beauty, it'd be only fair." Faith replied,
earning a pinch to her side. She just chuckled, earning her another
pinch. "Ah come on, the strong silent type works for me, don't wanna
give away the mystery for people do I?" Faith asked, hoping Sam
would stop pinching her, unless she wanted to pinch her.</p>
<p>"Oh no, you're right, wouldn't want that, oh the horror." Sam said
in mock, well in mock horror.</p>
<p>Faith just smirked at her girlfriend (oh that sounded nice, her
girlfriend) and then launched an all out tickle war. She turned and
pounced on top of Sam before she even knew what was happening. Sam
tried, she really did, to get away from Faith's tickling fingers, but
it was all in vain. Her girlfriend (sounds really nice don't it?)
was way stronger than she looked.</p>
<p>"Uncle! I give!" Sam cried out in defeat. Faith stopped tickling
and smiled down at Sam, smiled down, `cause she was now lying on top
of her. Faith leaned down and planted a soft kiss on Sam's lips.
Sam stared up into the most beautiful brown eyes she had ever seen
and felt her heart give itself away. She was Faith's now, completely
and wholly. "I love you."</p>
<p>Faith looked shocked at first by the soft exclamation, but the shock
melted away and was replaced by a look of love. "You're the first
person to ever say that to me ya know." Faith said softly, `causing
tears to spring to Sam's eyes. Faith placed another soft kiss on
Sam's lips and then uttered, "and you're the first person I'm ever
gonna say it to, I love you Samantha." The tears that were forming
in Sam's eyes spilt over and Faith kissed them away. And before he
lips met Sam's yet again she whispered, "first and last."</p>
