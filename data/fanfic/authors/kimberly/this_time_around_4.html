<!-- This Time Around \ Part Four: Fresh Meat -->

<p>***Kennedy High School***</p>
<p>Nicole watched the new students flock together, there were three of
them standing there, but there should be four. She narrowed her
eyes, one was missing. She didn't like new students, always going
where they weren't supposed to, talking above their status. No she
didn't like them at all! But every year on the first day, more
showed up. "Hey Nic." Nicole turned her head and saw her best
friend walking towards her.</p>
<p>"Brookie." Nicole greeted flatly, she was still trying to figure out
where the other new kid was.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Brook asked concerned. She looked over where Nicole
was staring. "New students?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Nicole ground out through clenched teeth. "One of `em is
missing though."</p>
<p>"Nicole.at least give them till lunch before you attack." Brook said
with a smirk. One that was matched on Nicole's face.</p>
<p>"First lunch, second lunch, or third lunch?" Nicole asked finally
taking her eyes off the new students and looking at her friend. As
the queen of Kennedy High should, Brook looked flawless. `This was
going to be a good year'. And then Mary Cherry showed up and she
decided she should rethink that last thought.</p>
<p>"Hi ya'll. Ya'll never gonna believe what ah just heard from a very
knowledgeable source." Nicole's ears pricked up at the sound of new
gossip, and Brook just sighed. "Your little step sistah to be Sammy
McDorkson is gonna be chaperoning Kenney's newest little delinquent."</p>
<p>Nicole raised an eyebrow, she just figured out where the new kid was;
it also explained where Spam was. This was just too good. Krupp had
actually come through for her. The editor of the school newspaper
(and her mortal enemy) was going to be kept very busy being a tour
guide. That meant that at least for a little while the school paper
wouldn't be saying bad things about the Glamazons! "Goodie." She
said sarcastically, couldn't let Mary Cherry think she did something
good after all.</p>
<p>"Delinquent?" Brook asked. She didn't want Sam to be stuck with
some psycho, they were actually getting along, becoming friends even,
and she wouldn't wish that on her soon to sister.</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am ah heard she is crazy, and wouldn't think it unbelievable
if she'd killed someone. She looks like pure evil ya'll." Mary
Cherry stated in her gravest of tones.</p>
<p>"You've seen her?" Nicole asked, better to know now how bad she
looked, easier to come up with nasty things to say.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry hung her head, "sorry to report to ya'll ah have not seen
her with mah own two eyes yet."</p>
<p>"Well then I guess we'll just have to wait." Nicole said, heading
into the Novak to check her make-up, after all it had been a whole
ten minutes since she checked last.</p>
