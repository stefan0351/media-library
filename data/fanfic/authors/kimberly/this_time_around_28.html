<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-Eight: Give Me A.'Uh Oh' -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Gym***</p>

<p>Buffy looked around and the various Glamazons milling around the gym,
it wasn't so different from her cheerleading days at Hermy.  She also
noticed how everyone greeted Brooke when they came in, but hid from
Nicole.  "Brookie, there ya are."  A very Texas like accent crossed
over the gym as a crazed looking blonde ran towards them.  "Oh hello,
and who might ya'll be?"</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry this is Buffy, she went to Hermy."  Nicole said, she had
easily recognized the name of the L.A. school and was glad to have
someone with the ability and know how to be popular trying out for
the team, unlike that *shiver* Carmen Fererra.</p>

<p>"Oh my word, a Herman."  Mary Cherry said excitedly as she clapped
her hands together.  Buffy just raised an eyebrow at her. </p>

<p>Nicole clapped her hands, obviously starting practice; she quickly
introduced Buffy to rest of the people present, and then went through
the try out.  Buffy found that the movements for the cheers were
still with her as she easily matched, if not out matched, rest of the
Glamazons.  She quickly became a favorite of Nicole's, which scared
her just a little bit.  When she thought about it Nicole seemed like
a cross between Cordelia during her bitch years, and Glory.  Where as
Mary Cherry was a cross of Drucilla, Cordelia, and one of Glory's
minions.  She shivered on reflex.</p>

<p>Buffy turned her attention, wanting to think up an evil cross for her
too, but as she studied the blonde, she couldn't come up with
anything negative.  In fact she could see what Faith saw in her.
Idly she wondered when she had stopped, in her mind anyway, competing
Brooke for Faith, and started competing Faith for Brooke.  It didn't
really matter though, she was the slayer, and she was ready to pout
until she got what she wanted.  Her mind being completely elsewhere,
namely Brooke curves, she completely missed helping catch the girl
they had just thrown into the air.  </p>

<p>The poor girl landed on the floor with a thud.  *THUD. *  Everyone
flinched in sympathetic pain as they helped the girl off the
floor.  "I am so sorry."  Buffy said taking the girl's right arm,
Brooke grabbed her left and carefully they led the girl to the
nurse's office.  When they got back practice was over and they were
alone in the locker room.  Brooke quickly went to her locker and
started stripping so she could take a shower, a nice cold shower.
Buffy leaned against the lockers and watched Brooke till the taller
girl's eyes came up to meet hers.  "So.I'm a Herman?"</p>

<p>Brooke flushed and started the apology she had been working on since
practice started, "I'm sorry about all of this, even thought you're
good, other than dropping Poppy that is, but I shouldn't have lied to
Nicole and gotten you into this whole mess, and now you're kinda
stuck, and it's all my fault and I am so sorry." Brooke trailed off
as she looked up and saw the smirk on Buffy's face.</p>

<p>"Very impressive babble."</p>

<p>"Babbling Brooke that's me."  Brooke scrunched up her forehead as she
realized what she had just said.  Then she scowled at a chuckling
Buffy and went into the shower room.  Turning on the water she
stepped under the spray and started washing the sweat, and other
things, from her body.  Her back to the entrance Brooke didn't notice
at first as Buffy leaned against the doorway watching her.  But when
she turned around, her eyes opened, she immediately saw Buffy
watching her.  Buffy didn't bother looking away as Brooke's eyes met
hers.  In fact she walked forward.</p>

<p>Buffy got right up in Brooke's personal space and pressed her body to
the taller one, her lips seeking out Brooke's.  Buffy pushed Brooke
against the titled wall, the water cascading down around them, and
made the contact firmer.  When Brooke moaned Buffy took the chance to
let her tongue out to play, and slipped it into Brooke's mouth.
Brooke's tongue met her halfway and dueled for dominance of the
kiss.  Buffy's hand came up and tested the weight of Brooke's breast
in her hand, never breaking the sweet contact of their lips.
Brooke's hands traveled down Buffy's body and rested on the soft
curve of Buffy's ass.</p>

<p>Finally breaking contact Buffy pulled back some to regain her
breathing, and calm her rapid heartbeat.  Their eyes bore into each
other, smoldering with the passion that had rose so easily between
them.  "My car is out front, my house just ten minutes from there."
Brook breathed out.</p>

<p>"To far."  Buffy answered with a smirk, but nonetheless pulled back
so that they could both get dried and dressed.  "Will anyone be home?"</p>

<p>"Um.maybe Sam.but she might be out with Faith."  Brooke answered,
thinking about the conspicuous disappearance of both girls for most
of the day.</p>

<p>"With Faith?"  Buffy asked confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah, wonderful imagery huh?"  Brooke asked oblivious to the mental
slap on the forehead Buffy had just given herself.  "Come on."
Brooke led Buffy to her car, not being able to wait to get home, and
naked, with Buffy, again.</p>

<p>`Well at least I don't have to worry about the conversation where I
tell Faith I stole her girlfriend.'  Buffy thought to herself as she
settled into the front passenger side of he car.</p>
