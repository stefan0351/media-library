<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 13 -->

<p><b>2014 - A Week Later</b></p>

<p>"You're hands are shaking," Jessie said
softly bringing her own hands up to cover Katie's in an attempt to still them. The
fact was Katie's body was just acting out how she was feeling, but the reaction still
surprised her. It had never occurred to her that twelve years after losing her virginity,
and who knew how many lovers later, that Katie's hands could still shake with
uncertainty like they had all those years ago.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie breathed out looking over at
Jessie. "I keep trying to make them stop, but it's not working so well,"
she continued her gaze dropping down, as she laughed softly. "I mean, Christ,"
she went on her eyes focusing on her hands, which were still twitching slightly even
though cupped within Jessie's.</p>

<p>"Blasphemer," Jessie whispered playfully bringing
her lips to Katie's softly, trapping their hands between their bodies.</p>

<p>"You were saying?" Katie asked softly, her hands
finally still once more.</p>

<p>Feeling Katie's hands still, Jessie stepped back
slightly, letting go of the other woman's hands letting her own fall to Katie's
waist. With her hands now free Katie rested them on Jessie's shoulders, and then
slowly drew them down over her arms before finally placing her hand on Jessie's chest
covering her heart, her eyes slowly shutting as a soft smile spread across her face.</p>

<p>"How can..." Jessie started to say, studying
Katie's face reverent as the other woman slowly opened her eyes revealing her
sparkling green orbs to Jessie.</p>

<p>"How can what?" she whispered her gaze dropping
down to Jessie's as she bit her bottom lip softly.</p>

<p>"How can you look at me like you've never done
this before?" Jessie asked her eyes focused on Katie's lips too, wanting to free
her lip from where it was ensnared by Katie's teeth, and kiss away any thoughts that
might have been in the other woman's head.</p>

<p>"Because it feels like it," Katie replied simply.
"I just look at you...touch you...and it's like the most amazing thing
ever," she continued her hand moving from over Jessie's heart to the top button
of her shirt.</p>

<p>"Katie," Jessie breathed out softly swallowing
hard as Katie's eyes captured hers, locking their eyes together.</p>

<p>"Yes," Katie asked her hands deftly unbuttoning
Jessie's shirt even as her eyes never for a second strayed from Jessie's.</p>

<p>"I want you to make love to me," Jessie said
lifting her hand up to cover Katie's once more and dragging it under her now open
shirt, placing it on her breast as she had done so many years ago. "Right. Now,"
she continued holding Katie's gaze, her need painfully evident in her shinning eyes.</p>

<p>Katie stared a Jessie for a moment longer, the feelings of
love she felt for this woman threatening to overwhelm her with the power of it all. Then
she opened her mouth, shutting it just as quickly when she realized that nothing she could
say could possibly be good enough, could possibly express the depth of her emotion. So she
leaned forward, touching her lips to Jessie's softly at first and then with an
increasing passion, as she began to move her hand, pushing the material of Jessie's
bra up impatiently and massaging her breast.</p>

<p>Jessie tugged at Katie's shirt, struggling to yank the
material out of the waistband of her skirt as Katie began to pull her shirt off, only
stopping to let Katie remove the garment once she had freed Katie's shirt and was a
decent way into the process of removing it.</p>

<p>Katie barely had time to drop Jessie's shirt to the
ground before the blonde was yanking hers over the top of her head, but she certainly
wasn't complaining about it as she felt Jessie's hand slip up underneath her
skirt as the blonde ran her hands up her thighs, bunching the skirt at Katie's waist.
Leaning into Jessie's touch as their lips crashed against each other desperately
again and again, Katie moaned into Jessie's mouth as the blondes hand came to caress
the moist material of her panties at the apex of her thighs.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Katie groaned wrenching her lips away
from Jessie's as her hands fumbled with the blonde's bra, finally unclasping it
and ripping it off of her body impatiently. Then her lips returned to Jessie's as her
hands made their way up Jessie's torso, and the blonde tugged her skirt down past her
waist letting it fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Stepping out of her skirt as it had landed, Katie moved
forward and continued to do so until the end of her bed halted Jessie's legs and they
could move no further. Simply holding Jessie close for a moment Katie then slowly dropped
to her knees, her eyes holding Jessie's as she moved down, and as she extended her
tongue licking a path from the top of Jessie's pants to her belly button, dipping her
tongue inside before placing a soft kiss over the now wet flesh.</p>

<p>Jessie looked down at the top of Katie's head, her
breath coming erratically now that Katie had released her eyes. She could feel
Katie's hands on her moving against her stomach and was painfully aware of the moment
the button to her pants popped free. Then her breathing hitched again she saw Katie's
head begin to move down as she felt her zipper lower.</p>

<p>"You," Jessie breathed out licentiously as Katie
grinned up at her while tugging down her pants. "Get back up here," she
continued gasping as Katie decided to kiss her way up, stopping along the way to lavish
attention on her stomach and then to each of her breasts, before finally making her way
back to her lips.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Katie whispered, her voice low and
husky as she felt Jessie's hands slip under the waistband of her underwear.
"What do you say," she continued lowering Jessie down onto the bed and draping
her body over hers. "No more foreplay?"</p>

<p>Jessie smiled drawing her hand up behind Katie's neck
and bringing the woman's lips back down to hers. "No more foreplay," she
agreed before fixing it so that neither of them could say anything more.</p>
