<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 24 -->

<p><b>2015</b></p>

<p>Jessie smiled softly to herself as she leaned
up against one of the walls that made up a small, dark corner of the gallery. She raised
her glass slowly to her lips as her eyes were focused towards the center of the room.
Katie was standing in the middle of a circle of people, smiling and gesturing emphatically
basically charming the pants (and skirts) off of everyone around her if their laughter and
smiles were any indication. Jessie smiled again at seeing her girlfriend so happy, it made
her happy to see Katie happy, however unlike Katie she could only take so much happiness
with people milling about her asking her if she was happy before she had to sound the
claxons and call for a retreat.</p>

<p>It had been a whirlwind of a year for them. At
first Katie was slow to get to work, dawdling about muttering about finding her motivation
and having more pressing matters on her mind than finger-painting, such as finding them a
house and getting funding for the gallery and all sorts of other rot that would have been
perfectly reasonable if they weren't coming from Katie. However, once she had gotten
back to work Jessie had come home every evening to smell of paint, oil and the sounds of
the Rolling Stones.</p>

<p>It was one of the most beautiful experiences
in the entire world, and she got to have it everyday. Lucky girl, that's what she
was. She was one lucky girl.</p>

<p>A hand on her shoulder drew Jessie out of her
thoughts. Surprised, not having thought anyone saw her slip away, but not alarmed Jessie
tipped her head to the side smiling when she saw her mother standing beside her.</p>

<p>"A raging success," Karen said
softly her eyes roaming around the room.</p>

<p>"A raging success," Jessie agreed
turning to smile at her mother as Karen squeezed her shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're going to have to make her
take out the trash so her head doesn't swell," Karen offered conversationally as
she watched Katie bow and smile rakishly to the people gathered around her. It had taken
awhile, but she and Katie were friends again now, which meant that she got to start making
fun of her once more.</p>

<p>"I make her take out the garbage
anyways," Jessie replied, her eyes once again focused on Katie though her attention
was devoted to her conversation with her mother.</p>

<p>"That's my girl," Karen said
proudly her eyes scanning the crowd for Henry.</p>

<p>"It's the ass-pole gene,"
Jessie mumbled taking a sip of her champagne. Sammler women were the ones with the whips
that was just the way it worked and if they had their way - which they always did
- it was the way it would always work.</p>

<p>"The what?" Karen asked turning to
look at Jessie sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie hastily responded.
The ass-pole was a family joke that had NOT been shared with Karen.</p>

<p>"It sounded like you said something about
an ass-pole gene," Karen said quirking a questioning eyebrow at her daughter.</p>

<p>"What's an ass-pole?" Jessie
inquired, her face and tone as innocent as could be. 'That's it Jess,' she
thought to herself, 'play dumb'.</p>

<p>"You tell me," Karen responded, the
very ass-pole in question working itself into a tizzy.</p>

<p>"How can I tell you about something when
I don't even know what it is?" Jessie asked, her ass-pole senses tingling.</p>

<p>It was going to be a long night.</p>

<p><b>2015</b></p>

<p>Katie stood in the doorway of the cabin
quietly watching the serene scene displayed in front of her. Jessie was sitting on the
porch swing, wrapped in a huge afghan blanket watching the way the light of the setting
sun danced over the rippling water of the lakes surface.</p>

<p>Three mornings ago they had escaped city and
settled into a quiet little cabin tucked away in the woods for a much talked about
vacation. Katie had procured the little property only weeks before, having haggled and
bartered for it, wanting a pit stop of sorts for Jessie on the way procuring that quaint
little ranch she had talked about so many years ago.</p>

<p>Walking over to Jessie, Katie looked down at
her thoughtfully for a moment as Jessie peered up at her blithely, then she reached down
and unceremoniously ripped the blanket off of her girlfriend before folding herself around
Jessie's body and smoothing settling the blanket back around them both.</p>

<p>"You," Jessie said smiling as she
felt Katie's arm snake around her waist, "are extremely odd."</p>

<p>""Everybody says that like it's
a revelation, like people haven't tried to stamp it onto my ass before," Katie
replied placing a soft kiss on Jessie's shoulder feeling the blonde's body shake
as she laughed. "Now before you can ruin this precious moment," she continued
ignoring the look Jessie shot back at her, "I was thinking."</p>

<p>"Oh god," Jessie mumbled mock
shivering.</p>

<p>"None of that," Katie said craning
her head around to give Jessie a playfully warning look. "You'll like
this," she assured the blonde who was looking at her with a confused yet intrigued
expression, despite her earlier exclamation. "I was thinking, an intimate beach
service in Hawaii," she continued her eyes drifting off as she spoke.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked charmed by
Katie's cute faraway expression, but having absolutely no idea whatsoever what she
was talking about.</p>

<p>"For the wedding," Katie replied
simply. "My immediate family, your immediate family ... which should bring the
total to around 30 ..." she added smirking. "And a good photographer."</p>

<p>"Wedding?" Jessie asked softly,
shifting in the sway seat so that she could look at Katie's face without craning her
neck.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Katie responded her eyes
locked with Jessie's. "This is me proposing to you."</p>

<p>Jessie felt her heart quicken and her mind
slow as the last of Katie's words drifted to her ears. Her body was torn between
wanting to jump up and run down the shoreline screaming and pumping her fists and wanting
to faint and maybe twitch a little. Katie was proposing to her, they were going to get
married and spend the rest of the their lives together. She was looking at forever with
the only person she had ever loved. So, she did the only thing she could. She sat there
staring at Katie with a stupefied expression on her face.</p>

<p>"Look," Katie said digging around
underneath the blanket for a moment before pulling out a small black box.
"Shiny," she continued flipping it open to show Jessie the ring. She really
hoped that the ring would encourage the blonde to make an expression. She was beginning to
think she really should have done the whole knee thing, but no, she had to prove herself
right and actually propose in the most asinine fashion ever.</p>

<p>"This is me," Katie began again
taking the ring out of the box and picking up Jessie's hand. "Asking you to
marry me," she went on holding the ring just over Jessie's index finger.</p>

<p>It may have been unusual proposal, but such
was her way.</p>

<p>Jessie slowly moved her hand so that it
covered Katie's and with her eyes trained on their joined hands she moved
Katie's and pushed the ring fully onto the index finger of her other hand. Then,
after pausing for a moment to look at the ring on her finger as Katie's hand gently
held her own, she raised her eyes and leaned forward bringing their lips together, in a
soft, tender kiss.</p>

<p>"I'm," Katie said, her voice
quivering slightly as they separated, "going to take that as a yes and use this
opportunity to call no take backs," she continued realizing that her voice
wasn't the only thing that was shaky. "So Hawaii, what do you..." But
before she could continue Jessie had captured her lips once more, her hands coming to the
sides of Katie's face holding her in place as she kissed her over and over and over
again, tears of happiness streaking down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"In the evening, just before
sunset," Jessie whispered placing her head on Katie's shoulder and turning her
still watering eyes back towards the lake.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I was
thinking," Katie replied smiling.</p>

<p><b>2019 - Epilogue</b></p>

<p>"Gracias," Katie said, a soft smile
touching her lips as she looked up at the man standing next to her as she passed the small
postcard back to him.</p>

<p>However, though her eyes were on him, her
attention was focused on a slight tugging sensation on her other arm. The hand of which
was attached firmly to the back of a small, struggling boys stylish jumper.</p>

<p>"Caleb," she finally said in a
harassed tone as the man walked away autograph in hand. "Caleb stop," she
continued, as he looked back at her for a moment then started right back up again pointing
through the window of the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Oh alright," Katie said looking out
the window and spotting the object of his agitation.</p>

<p>"I scream," the boy said excitedly
just incase she hadn't caught his drift. "I scream, I scream," he continued
surging forward only to be restrained by Katie's hold. "I scream," he added
for good measure once he had caught his breath from his previous exertions.</p>

<p>"Ice cream," Katie agreed smiling
down at the top of his shaggy head before glancing across the table.</p>

<p>"The perfect after breakfast snack,"
Jessie replied, a lazy smile spreading across her face as she watched Katie's body
jerk to the side as Caleb's eighth wind came to him and took her with him as he
surged forward.</p>

<p>"I'm gonna remember you said
that," Katie replied grinning at her wife as she stood up finally letting go of the
boys jumper and watching as he flee forward a few steps then stood facing the door
bouncing up and down on his feet breathlessly. "Is he too young to put on
medication?" Katie continued turning her head to face Jessie as they headed for the
exit. "Hey, ouch," was what followed the question as she rubbed her shoulder.</p>

<p>"So you finally got to see a show in
Madrid," Katie commented as they crossed the square, watching as Jessie gazed around
them with that same glazed expression she'd been wearing since they had gotten off of
the plane. "Was it worth the wait?"</p>

<p>"Every year," Jessie replied
smiling. "Now how long till I get to see one in Palermo?"</p>

<p>"Oh at least another ten years,"
Katie replied breezily. "Somebody keeps stealing my paints," she added pointedly
looking down with a mock glare. "I wonder who it could be?" she continued as the
small figure walking between them peered up at her ingenuously. Caleb then turned his head
to look at Jessie and pointed.</p>

<p>"Mum," he said nodding at Katie
seriously before focusing on the ice cream truck once more.</p>

<p>"Has somebody got some 'splaining to
do?" Katie asked looking over at Jessie who merely shook her head while thinking to
herself 'oh god there's two of them now'.</p>

<p>But as they reached the vender a broad smile
spread across her face before she bent down to pick up Caleb so that he could pick what he
wanted. And as his stream of consciousness selection debate drifted to her ears, her gaze
flickered over to look at her wife who had her bottom lip firmly ensnared by her teeth as
she looked intently at the menu, tilting her head to the side with interest occasionally
before shaking her head and going back to study the menu some more.</p>

<p>"Uh," Caleb said pointing to a
selection, drawing Jessie out of her pleasant haze.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Jessie asked
raising an eyebrow at him. If she'd told him once, she'd told him a thousand
times, civilized people don't grunt.</p>

<p>"Uh, por favor?" Caleb responded
hopefully, looking over at Jessie with an expression that said 'did I get it?'</p>

<p>"That's better," Jessie said
smiling before leaning slightly to the side to place a brief kiss to his forehead turning
to order.</p>
