<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 3 -->

<p>"No, it's alright, go ahead," Katie said
looking over at her assistant. "We're almost finished here anyway. Aren't
we?" she said turning her attention to Jessie, who nodded and smiled over at the
girl.</p>

<p>"Well, alright," Monica said grateful to actually
be going. It had been extremely uncomfortable being around these two for the entire day.
Five seconds after Katie had introduced herself, it became apparent to her that they knew
each other, but they weren't acting like any old friends that she knew, which led her
to believe that they'd been more than that. Which, understandably would have made it
difficult for them to be working together, still it made it uncomfortable for her too and
she was glad to be getting out of there. "See you tomorrow then."</p>

<p>Katie merely nodded and watched as she made her way out
before returning her gaze to Jessie.</p>

<p>"I think I actually saw smoke coming off of her
feet," she commented softly, her eyes on the table top as visions of cartoon
characters vanishing behind clouds of smoke washed through her brain.</p>

<p>"She did seem ... eager," Jessie agreed her
eyes resting on Katie for a moment before dropping back down to the information pad in
front of her.</p>

<p>"Usually she doesn't shut up. Even when you ask
her nicely, then tersely, then threaten her pets," Katie said conversationally,
unconsciously playing with her ring again. "I think we were making her
uncomfortably."</p>

<p>"Really?" Jessie asked still staring at the
screen in front of her though she couldn't actually make anything out. A blur,
everything was a blur.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie answered letting out an amused
sigh. "Of course. I mean we're making me nervous and I'm one of us,"
she continued glancing up to look at Jessie once more.</p>

<p>Jessie looked up at the admission, her mouth opening as if
to say something, then closing before even a syllable could escape. Instead she sat there,
staring back across the table at Katie looking anxious and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I probably shouldn't say this," Katie
continued sighing softly, when Jessie didn't respond. "God knows it'll just
make things more uncomfortable, but ... it's good to see you," she said.
"Really good to see you. I didn't even ... I mean I knew that I missed you,
but I didn't realize how much until I saw you there and everything that I had missed
was back," Katie pressed on having seen Jessie open her mouth to speak and wanting to
get what she was thinking out before Jessie could interrupt her. "And, I'm just
... it's just ... good. To see you."</p>

<p>Jessie remained still for a moment after Katie finished
speaking, then slowly extended her hand and pressed a button on her data pad, shutting the
instrument off. Her finger lingered on the button for a moment, her eyes intensely focused
on the blank screen, and then she picked it up and placed it in her briefcase, which she
then carefully closed.</p>

<p>"The case doesn't seem to difficult, we really
shouldn't have any problem here as long as the information you gave me checks
out," she said standing up, picking up her blazer and draping it across her arm.
"Especially with the anti-conglomerate tide lately, people are actually starting to
actively care about the little guy, if only because they are the little guy," she
continued picking up her briefcase. "I'm going to try and track down those names
that you gave me, so if you need to reach me you should leave a message with my secretary,
because I check in with her every hour or so," she went on nudging the chair in.
"So, I'll see you ... later," she finished turning to make her way to
the door.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Katie said softly, her chair scraping
across the floor noisily as she stood up to intercept the other woman. "Jessie,"
she said again resting her hand on the blonde's shoulder to get her stop.</p>

<p>"Please don't," Jessie said softly her voice
cracking perceptively as she turned her head to look at Katie's hand.</p>

<p>Katie immediately removed her hand from Jessie's
shoulder, but remained in the position close to Jessie's body that the gesture had
allowed. "There's this place down the street, great nachos and even better
margaritas," Katie started. "On me."</p>

<p>"Katie," Jessie said turning her head away and
looking at the door across the lobby longingly.</p>

<p>"Just to talk," Katie replied chewing on her
bottom lip, her eyes looking pleadingly into Jessie's. "I swear, I won't
say anything else like," and she waved her hand dismissively to indicate their
previous conversation thread, "I just, I mean we were friends. It's been awhile.
I wanna now, about your life," she continued softly. "We used to be able to talk
for hours."</p>

<p>"We used to be a lot of things," Jessie replied
dropping her eyes away from Katie's. A decade and those eyes could still reach inside
of her and make her heart feel like it was going to melt. She'd spent a lot of time
over that decade trying very hard to make sure the consistency of her heart would never be
in danger again, and she'd succeeded in protecting it from future assaults. But like
most, she found that she was a slave to her past. That she was a willing subject under the
command of those eyes.</p>

<p>"Still are some of them," Katie responded
stepping back to lean against the doorway.</p>

<p>"Like what?" Jessie asked against her will. She
didn't want to be doing this. She should have left, when Katie stepped back, she
should have accepted the movement as an offer to leave and been entering the outdoors.</p>

<p>"Tall, for one," Katie replied smirking when
Jessie turned to look at her. The smirk turning into a genuine smile when Jessie
reluctantly returned it before dropping her head down and breaking their gaze.
"Astounded, for another," she continued softly. "All the time, every time,
whenever I'm around you."</p>

<p>Jessie stared at her for a moment as memories of the first
time she heard those words painted themselves across her mind. Her hands tentatively
running up Katie's naked torso, Katie's breathing hitching, and Katie's
hand on her, exploring softly, in wonder. She remembered what Katie smelled like, the
exact taste of her skin, and could remember every flutter of the girl's eyelids as
her eyes instinctively closed but she fought to keep them open.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you weren't going to say
anything like that," Jessie replied finally, shaking her head faintly to dislodge the
memories.</p>

<p>"I meant it when I said it," Katie responded
ruefully. "But I've never been in complete control of myself when it comes to
you."</p>

<p>"I bet you say that to all the girls," Jessie
said looking over at Katie, her voice and eyes completely serious.</p>

<p>"Never could," Katie said softly holding
Jessie's eyes. "Wouldn't have been true. But I didn't need to,"
she continued. She'd been with other women since she and Jessie had split, a fair
number of them to be perfectly honest, and even though she had always wanted them to be
more, they'd only served as distractions. Something in them had called to her, a
movement of their hands, or a phrase, or something that seemed extraordinary about them,
that seemed interesting. But they were never as interesting as that moment promised, they
were never able to hold her attention, to touch her inside. She'd only ever really
given herself to one person, had only ever really known, and in return been known by one
person. Jessie. She was ready to be found again, and to find in return.</p>

<p>"I should go," Jessie said, not really wanting to
consider Katie's statement. She knew, even without being told, simply because she
knew Katie, that her former girlfriend wouldn't have traveled the same path as her.
Katie was a people person, she needed people around her, and Jessie knew that that meant
that she would have had a constant stream of lovers. Still, she didn't want to think
about it, or what her jealously at hearing it confirmed meant.</p>

<p>"I probably shouldn't say this, but..."
Katie started.</p>

<p>"Then don't," Jessie said turning to look at
her. "Just for once in your life don't."</p>

<p>"I can't," Katie replied, the words already
tumbling into her mouth.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked already knowing the answer.</p>

<p>"Not," Katie replied. "I meant what I said
before. I've missed you more than I could ever have imagined. And I know that its
been a while, and that we've both changed, but I haven't changed so much that
I'm still not completely in awe of you. If I'd had my way back then, we never
would have broken up..."</p>

<p>"I..." Jessie started defensively.</p>

<p>"I know. We were young and life chose for us,"
Katie replied halting Jessie's defense. She'd long since stopped cursing
herself, and the world, and Jessie and anyone else she could think of for what happened
between them. "But we're not kids anymore, we can decide for ourselves now and
if you'll let me, I chose to know you again."</p>

<p>"I can't keep doing this," Jessie said, no
longer able to hold back the tears that she had been fighting all day.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to," Katie said reaching
out for Jessie one more time, one of her hands going to her shoulder and the other
underneath her chin to tilt it back up. "Just one more time. One last time."</p>

<p>Jessie sniffed, turning her head out of Katie's hand
and took a step back putting some space between them. It went without saying that she had
missed Katie too; she'd spent the majority of her entire adult life trying not to
miss Katie. After they broke up, she had shut herself off from everyone, concentrating on
school and on preparing for her future, and it had eased the pain somewhat, enough to
allow her to enter the real world every once in a while. And she'd met men and women
on those forays, been with others, but all everyone else ever made her feel was loss.
She'd gotten used to the feeling, to having an empty space in her that used to be
filled with Katie. It had become a familiar void, one that she had stopped noticing years
ago. But now she felt it again, she felt it filling up, and it scared her. She didn't
want to fall back in love with this woman.</p>

<p>"So," Jessie said finally glancing over at Katie
who was watching her closely. "What's this nacho and margarita place
called?" she asked, straightening her back. I didn't really matter what she
wanted, she hadn't had a choice the first time, and she wasn't deluded enough to
think that she did now. Love would have its way, and it would burn its bridges when it was
done, that was the way it worked.</p>

<p>"Stan's," Katie replied smiling as Jessie
rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Figures," Jessie responded smiling as she shook
her head. "So are we going, or do you want me to message you an invitation?" she
continued cheekily quirking an eyebrow at the other woman. She remembered this game, she
had missed this game.</p>

<p>"Meow," Katie said making a claw out of her hand
and waving it in front of Jessie's face playfully as she grinned at the blonde.
"After you," she said nodding towards the door.</p>

<p>"You're the one that knows where it is,"
Jessie replied stepping through the doorway and heading into the lobby nonetheless.
"You should lead."</p>

<p>"You just want the muggers to get me first,"
Katie said joining Jessie in the lobby. Jessie looked over at her and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a new suit."</p>
