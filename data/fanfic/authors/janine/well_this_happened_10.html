<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 10 -->

<p>"I swear to god I thought it was tofu," Carmyn exclaimed pleadingly.</p>

<p>"It was chicken!" Lily shot back.  "I'm a vegetarian."</p>

<p>"I know, I know…which was why I was happy when I thought it was tofu," Carm
responded.  "The menu said tofu, it looked like tofu…it tasted like chicken,
but so does everything!"</p>

<p>"Hello ladies," Harrison said walking up to his bickering friends
unknowingly saving Carmyn's hide.</p>

<p>"You're awfully chipper this afternoon," Lily commented.</p>

<p>"That's because it's been a very good day," Harrison responded smiling
broadly.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" Carm asked knowingly.</p>

<p>"I think you know," Harrison replied.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Carm and Lily replied together.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the encouragement," Harrison responded frowning slightly.  "I'll
have you know that this very afternoon Brooke tracked me down and apologized
for what happened, not only bestowing upon my a dazzling smile but also a
hug," Harrison said quite pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"You know that we're here for you, and that we'd encourage you in an
obtainable venture, but Brooke?  You've been after her since third
grade…you've got to face the facts, it's never going to happen," Carmyn told
him as gently as possible.</p>

<p>"Come one, have a little faith," Harrison responded.  "The stars are all in
alignment right now.  Brooke and I have never gotten along better, we're
both single, and I've been working out," he continued.  "It's as close to
destiny as I'm gonna get."</p>

<p>"So close and yet so far," Lily muttered under her breath before addressing
him directly.  "She's not as single as you might think.  The cards are still
stacked against you," she said ignoring the look Carm shot her.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Harrison asked, he hadn't heard about Brooke
hooking up with anyone after Josh.</p>

<p>"There's a prospect," Carm responded cryptically.  "She's off the market."</p>

<p>"How do you two know about this and I don't?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"We kind of stumbled across the information, but we've been sworn to
secrecy," Carm responded.  "We've only said this much because we didn't want
to see you get hurt."</p>

<p>"Who?" Harrison asked desperate to know who had beaten him to the punch.</p>

<p>"We've crossed our hearts and hoped to die," Lily responded.  "We can't
say."</p>

<p>After that Harrison proceeded to badger them for a few more minutes but they
wouldn't budge from their position.</p>

<p>"You know what?  This blows!" he responded.  "I'll find out myself," and
with that he stormed off down the hall.</p>

<p>"Oh boy," Carm muttered once he was gone.  "This isn't going to be pretty."</p>

<p>"Definitely not," Lily confirmed.</p>
