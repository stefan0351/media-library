<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 35: "Why Mary Cherry, Why?" -->

<p>Brooke led Nicole, Popita and Mary Cherry into the backyard of the
house.  Jane had suggested some alterations to their uniforms that
the Glamazons had unanimously decided absolutely had to be done, so
the four of them were to be Mrs. McPherson's guinea pigs.   When they
arrived, Jane was talking with her dad on the porch so Brooke decided
to show them the new reflecting pond they had just had landscaped
into the backyard.  It was absolutely killer, and they were the first
people on the street to have one.  Nicole was going to flip.</p>

<p>When Sam finished with the bird feeder her eyes immediately began to
scan for the yard for her girlfriend.  Spotting Brooke she began to
make her way over, her eyes drifting uncomfortably to the deck where
her mom and Mr. McQueen had been lounging, her brows drawing together
in confusion as she noticed that Mary Cherry seemed to be talking to
them.  Stopping beside Brooke she placed her hand on her shoulder to
draw her attention. </p>

<p>"Why is Mary Cherry talking to mom and your dad?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked.  "She's right," however as she said this Brooke
looked around her immediate vicinity and noticed that Mary Cherry was
indeed not with the four other girls.  Turning her head towards the
deck her eyes widened.  "Oh god no," she gasped spotting Mary Cherry
gesturing wildly to the parental units.</p>

<p>"Mr. McQueen, almost Mrs. McQueen," Mary Cherry began.  "I would jus'
like ta take this opportunity ta say that I'm very impressed with
your liberal open-mindedness.  I think that it's absolutely fabulous
that your'll so accepting of Brookie and Sam's so highly
controversial union.  Back home if the aged P's wah eva' to find out
that their daughters were engaged in sexual congress right under
their very roof, heads would rollll!  People like you are the reason
why I love L.A. so very, very much!  Thank you," Mary Cherry
concluded grinning.  </p>

<p>As the last syllable left Brooke's mouth, Mary Cherry began walk away
from the parental units and towards the four girls.  Likewise, Mike
and Jane turned their heads so that they were facing the girls, and
even from the distance they were at Brooke and Sam could detect the
looks of surprise and confusion covering their faces.  They weren't
so much looking at them as they were gaping.  Sam felt her hand drop
from Brooke's shoulder although she wasn't conscious of doing it;
everyone in the yard had seemed to freeze in position, still like
stone as the implications of what had just occurred came to them,
ramming into a certain brunette and blonde like a runaway freight
train.</p>

<p>Then almost as soon as it happened, it ended with older ones turning
away and walking inside the house leaving the yard to the teenagers.</p>
