<!-- About a Girl \ Part 26 -->

<p><u><i>Karen's House - Outside</i></u></p>

<p>Katie paced nervously up and down the walkway leading up to Ms.
Sammler's door.  It was just past four in the afternoon and she was
certain that Jessie was in there having seen her mother pick her up
from school an hour earlier.  After the incident with Sarah she'd
spent the rest of the night deep in thought finally realizing how
screwed up she'd gotten since she and Jessie had stopped talking.
>From swearing at teachers and snapping at her friends, to actually
being so out of things that she'd let Sarah get so close to her, it
just had to stop, she knew that she had to talk to Jessie.  She had
to see her, and resolve things one way or the other, because she just
couldn't do this anymore, it was tearing her apart.  </p>

<p>The problem was she scared, absolutely terrified at the prospect of
actually seeing Jessie only to have the other girl tell her to get
lost.  The thought that her misplaced pride might have ended up
costing her the most important person in her life, causing her to
continue pacing, just as she had for the past half hour.</p>

<p>Finally, after nearly wearing a hole in her shoes, Katie stopped
pacing and pushed forward stepping up onto the porch.  Bouncing up on
the balls of her feet and letting out a anxious exhalation of air,
she sucked in a deep breath and extended her hand until her finger
was resting on the smooth white plastic of Karen's doorbell.  Then
clenching her other hand tightly, she closed her eyes and quickly
jabbed at the bell.</p>

<p>Jessie yanked the door open fully preparing to give whoever was at
the door a piece of her mind - especially if it was those stupid
survey people again.  However, she stopped abruptly, her body jerking
to a stop as if she'd run into an invisible wall when she saw that it
was Katie who was standing there.  She suddenly found herself at a
loss for words as she blinked at the sight of her girlfriend.
Katie.  Katie was standing at her door.  Katie.  She couldn't believe
that she was actually there, that she had come to see her.  Katie.</p>

<p>Before Katie could even mumble a lame `hello' she found herself
hurrying to wrap her arms around Jessie who after a momentary bout of
silence and confused blinking had rushed out of the door at her and
into her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh my god, I'm so happy to see you," Jessie mumbled into Katie's
shoulder, not even really certain of the words that were coming out
of her mouth.  "I've missed you so much, and I thought that I'd
totally messed things up, and I should have returned your calls, I
just wanted to apologize to you so much, but every time, I could just
never do it, and I thought that you would never talk to me again,"
she continued to mumble as Katie maneuvered them into the house and
closed the door, which she then leaned against bringing Jessie with
her.</p>

<p>"I could never stop loving you, not in a million years," Katie told
Jessie softly as she stroked her back, blinking rapidly to try and
contain the tears that had been forming in her eyes from the moment
Jessie touched her.  "I shouldn't have taken everything so
personally, I was so stupid, I didn't even see, she totally didn't
change, and I hurt you and that was the last thing I ever wanted to
do," she continued her voice choking in her throat, intense feelings
of self-loathing coursing through her body as she remembered how
very, very wrong she'd been.</p>

<p>Pulling back out of Katie's arms, Jessie looked at her girlfriend,
really looked at her for the first time since recognizing the figure
at the door as her, and literally had to fight the urge to gasp in
shock.  She was alarming pale as if she had been locked in a room for
days, and her eyes were puffy and bloodshot.  Her tall frame was
hunched over tiredly and her face was tightly drawn like she had
forgotten how to relax since the last time they spoke.  It broke
Jessie heart because she knew that she was the one that had done this
to her, she'd taken this amazing person so full of life and energy
and love, and twisted her into a shell of that former self because
she was too scared and insecure to see the truth, or to believe it
when she saw it. </p>

<p>"I'm so sorry I put you through all of this," Jessie managed to choke
out as she reached up to stroke Katie's face, absolutely devastated
by Katie's broken appearance.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be," Katie said shaking her head knowing that Jessie
was blaming herself for whatever had happened, and that that wasn't
the truth.  She had helped the dig the hole, and she had willingly
wallowed in it.  "There's no reason, I mean I did stupid stuff too,"
she continued tears beginning to escape from her eyes.  "Really
stupid things," she went on turning away from Jessie to hide her face.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Jessie asked placing her hand on Katie's arm
encouraging her to turn back around, sensing that whatever was
bothering her was important.  She wasn't just going to let things
slide anymore, she wasn't not going to ask questions anymore because
she was scared of the answer or of what the reaction to them might
be.  She'd kept her fears locked away inside, and her concerns to
herself shutting Katie out of part of her life to disastrous
affects.  She wasn't going to do that again, she didn't think she
could stand it if that happened again.  No, she wasn't going to allow
that to happen again.</p>

<p>"I thought," Katie started fully crying now, "I swear that I thought
it was you," she continued slumping against the wall.  She hadn't
intended to say anything about what had happened with Sarah, she
hadn't wanted to think about it since it gave her the full body
creeps, but she knew that she had to tell Jessie, her conscience
wouldn't let her not tell Jessie.  It would be a lead ball chained to
her leg, weighing her down for all eternity if she didn't tell her,
their reunion founded on a lie and their relationship tainted.  If
they were going to fix things, then they had to be honest, painful as
it may have been she had to place her heart on her sleeve.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," Jessie said wanting to do something to calm
Katie, but not knowing how.  In her dreams, this reunion had had a
lot more kissing and a lot less tears.</p>

<p>"She came over.  Sarah," Katie said trying to get a reign in on her
emotions.  "I was asleep, and I thought that she was you, I was
thinking about you, and then it was like you were there, and I
thought that it was you . and ." Katie continued, her babbling slowly
trailing off when she realized that Jessie's body had stiffened
acutely as she spoke and that she didn't seem to actually be
breathing.</p>

<p>"Did you." Jessie started to ask softly, her hand falling away from
Katie's shoulder and down to her side limply as all of her fears and
nightmares came tumbling through her brain once more.  </p>

<p>"No," Katie said quickly, wanting to reach out for Jessie but not
knowing if the gesture would be appreciated.  "God no," she continued
vehemently shaking her head.  "She kissed me that's all, then I
snapped out of it and kicked her the hell out.  I was just so messed
up," she continued her voice cracking with emotion.  "It just took me
a minute, I really thought it was you.  I swear to God I thought it
was you," she went on softly, her eyes lowering to the ground as her
body started to shiver lightly.</p>

<p>Jessie watched Katie for a moment, torn between her own hurt at
hearing Katie admit that she had kissed Sarah, and knowing without a
doubt from Katie's bearing that it had really been an accident and
that she was probably beating herself up over it more than Jessie
could ever hope to.  She wanted to kill Sarah, she wanted to rip her
limbs from her body and then beat her about the head with them and
then maybe feed them to some wild alligators or something.  She
wanted to run out into the middle of the street and drop to her knees
in an overly dramatic way screaming at the top of her lungs.  She
wanted to, she just wanted to do something to make these ugly
feelings that had been brewing inside of her go away.  She didn't
want to be in pain anymore, she didn't want to be angry anymore.  She
just wanted Katie.  She wanted Katie.</p>

<p>"It's okay," Jessie replied a moment later sensing Katie start to
pull away from her, no doubt agitated by her lengthy silence.  "That
wasn't like on my top list of things to hear before graduation," she
continued ruefully, shaking her head a bit before taking Katie's hand
into her own, "but it's alright."  And though her heart was filled
with a myriad of emotions, from irrational jealously over what had
happened, to an almost insane anger, righteous indignation for what
Sarah had done to Katie, and extreme guilt that she'd played a part
in allowing it to happen, the love she felt for Katie was stronger.
And it washed over her, soothing her other emotions allowing her to
breath, deeply and refreshingly for the first time in weeks.</p>

<p>Katie sighed with relief upon hearing Jessie's words, believing them
and letting them wash over her like holy water, absolving her of her
sin.  When Jessie hadn't said anything for so long, she'd been about
ready to bolt, ready to take her silence as the rightful condemnation
of her actions.  But she wasn't a masochist and when Jessie offered
her forgiveness, even though she doubted she actually deserved it,
she took it.  She reached out for it and clutched it to her chest
until her knuckles were white, because she needed this; she needed
Jessie, because the blonde was elemental.  She made the flowers grow
and birds sing.</p>

<p>So, finally she looked over at her girlfriend, really seeing her for
the first time since the door opened.  She gazed into those blue eyes
that were watching her so carefully, lovingly, shinning with unshed
tears and exuding concern, and she felt like she was home.  She felt
a peace deep within her that made her close her eyes and breathe in
deeply to try and absorb the splendor of it all.</p>

<p>"You're beautiful," Katie finally exhaled absolutely astounded by the
magnificence that was Jessie.</p>

<p>"No I'm not," Jessie said glancing down at her ratty clothes, and
knowing from previous days experience that her skin was probably
blotchy and pale, and she probably had bags under eyes and looked
like she hadn't slept in days.</p>

<p>"You're breathtaking," Katie said a warm smile spreading across her
face.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled at the expression on Katie's face and ducked her head
down self-consciously not knowing how anyone could look at her with
such adoration, but loving it at the same time.  "If you keep this
up, I'm never going to wear anything but track pants again," Jessie
commented shyly looking up at Katie.  She remembered this feeling,
this excitement, it was happiness and she spelled it K-a-t-i -e.</p>

<p>"That's fine," Katie replied thinking that Jessie would look
ravishing in a burlap sack or large paper bag.</p>

<p>"Even if they're the ones with the racing stripe down the side, and
pictures of the Ninja Turtles on them?" Jessie asked playfully as she
found herself unconsciously migrating towards the warmth of Katie's
body.  She hadn't even realized how much she'd missed the feeling of
Katie's arms wrapped around her until she was almost in them again.</p>

<p>Katie looked at her in mock horror upon hearing that and shook her
head.  "You're right," she said.  "We can't have that.  You look
absolutely horrible!  Street urchin is definitely not the look for
you." </p>

<p>Jessie smiled throwing herself into Katie's arms sighing as her
girlfriend encased her in a tight embrace.  "I've got some blonde
jokes too," Katie mumbled into the top of Jessie's head, inhaling the
scent of her hair as Jessie snuggled in closer.  "And I could force
myself into talking about your momma," she continued smiling as she
felt Jessie's lips press against the skin of her neck.  She sighed to
herself contentedly, Hallmark had lied you absolutely didn't need to
say it like them.  </p>
