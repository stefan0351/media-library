<!-- Well, This Happened \ Epilogue -->

<p>All of the lights were out in the palace (otherwise known as the
McQueen/McPherson residence), the only illumination in the whole
house coming from the living room where the television cast of soft
glow about the room.  In the softly lit living room there was a
gathering.  It was a small gathering, but a gathering nonetheless,
informal, the coming together of friends (or at the very least
frienemies).  The two plush leather couches in the room were occupied
by a short-haired blonde girl with harlot red lipstick, and a long
haired blonde girl with a fashionable but not very politically
correct fondness for fur.  They were stretched out on the couches
like reigning monarchs, or lounging goddesses.  The only other seat
in the room, a leather lounge chair was occupied by a short haired
brunette (who was surprising spry as the others found out in the foot
race for the open chair) which meant that the other occupants of the
room where relegated to the floor.  </p>

<p>A blonde with hair that hung just below her shoulder sat with her
back propped up against the couch the short-haired golden goddess was
currently occupying.  Her legs were stretched out in front of her,
positioned closely together so that they formed a pillow for the head
of the luscious, long-haired brunette who was laying by her.  The two
of them, who occasionally bestowed each other with tender glances and
whispered words, were the picture of domestic bliss.</p>

<p>Another brunette girl sat cross legged off to the left of the goddess
and picture of domestic bliss.  She was sitting close to the fur-
wearer, but not too close.  She seemed uneasy and kept sending
anxious looks behind her to the fur-wearer who would then grin at her
in a highly unsettling manner.</p>

<p>Next to the spry brunette in the chair sat a handsome young man with
dark hair and soulful eyes.  He sat leaned up against the side of the
chair and could occasionally be seen casting longing though resigned
looks to the picture of domestic bliss.</p>

<p>To anyone observing the scene from the outside it would have seemed
like a quaint little scene indeed.  Imbued with sugar and spice and
nostalgia and all of those good things.  It would have seemed like
quite a charming little scene.  But things always look different from
the outside.</p>

<p>Inside:</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Harrison asked peevishly turning to glare at
Nicole, even though he could barely make out her figure in the dark
of the room.  "Stop that!"  He demanded when she didn't cease her
actions immediately.  She was fast forwarding through the parts of
the movie she deemed too boring to sit through, and he had had enough
of it.  They had missed every part of the movie where Brad Pitt
wasn't on screen.  "Give me the remote!" He demanded.</p>

<p>"Make me," Nicole responded elevating a cocky eyebrow at him.  A
challenge.  Nicole Julian didn't take orders.  If you wanted
something she had, you had to take it.</p>

<p>"Give it!"  Harrison demanded again.  Oh, how it hated this girl.  He
hated her even more than he hated Mary Cherry — and that was a
considerable statement considering that Mary Cherry, despite having
known him for almost a year, referred to him as Joe for some insane
reason.</p>

<p>"Since you obviously haven't figured this out yet, let me explain it
to you in simpler terms.  You're the Jimmy Olsen in this equation,
that means that you sit there and be grateful that I'm letting you
bask in my radiance," Nicole responded unfazed.  The silly boy
thought that yelling would intimidate her.  Laughable, pitiful.</p>

<p>"GIVE ME THE REMOTE YOU SOULLESS HARPY!" Harrison yelled at her in
response.  Just once he wanted to be Superman, he was tired of being
Jimmy Olsen.  Jimmy Olsen never got the girl.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you be obsessing over some girl that would rather date
your mother?" Nicole asked tauntingly, smiling wickedly at him as the
words left her mouth.  She was so bad.  She was utterly delicious.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Harrison, Brooke and Sam all exclaimed at once.  This only
made Nicole's smile widen.  Yah, for her, that was a three for one,
very rare indeed.</p>

<p>"I've got the perfect solution," Brooke said reaching up from her
position on the floor and yanking the remote out of Nicole's hand – a
move that becomes particularly impressive when it is noted that she
barely jostled Sam's head as she ripped the remote away from her
friend.  "Both of you, don't speak," she continued pressing the
rewind button.  The movie was called "A River Runs Through It" after
all yet Brooke hadn't spotted the river yet.  All they had seen was
shirtless Brad Pitt – not that that was a bad thing at all, Brooke
just felt that they were selling themselves short by looking at
nothing but naked man flesh.</p>

<p>"I…"</p>

<p>"No!  Don't speak," Brooke exclaimed again holding up her hand and
wiggling her finger  effectively cutting off Nicole's response.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Can I please get the end of the couch?" Carmen asked Mary Cherry.
Mary Cherry's response was to simply stare at her, and rather
apathetically at that.  "My ass has gone numb," Carmen explained
trying to appeal to Mary Cherry's heart, when she received no
response from the other girl.  This was her mistake, for Mary Cherry
had a heart condition…she doesn't have one. </p>

<p>"Let me think about that fer a minute," Mary Cherry responded tilting
her head up to the ceiling thoughtfully.  "After conversing my mah
lord and savoir Jesus Christ, I'm afraid I have ta reply in the
negatory," the blonde continued a moment later.</p>

<p>"Why?" Carmen asked.</p>

<p>"He don't want yer fat ass crinkling this gorgeous buckskin couch
anymore than I do," Mary Cherry responded plainly.  "We're agreed
that it'd be a terrible tragedy."  With that out of the she promptly
yawned and turned away from the gaping brunette.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Carmen called out indignantly.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her attention from Sam – who had interrupted her
feuding with Nicole to protest the harsh treatment her head was
receiving – and looked over to where Carmen and Mary Cherry were
situated.  She winced, this wasn't likely to be pleasant.</p>

<p>"Children please," Brooke said, though she was looking directly at
Mary Cherry as she spoke.  "Didn't anybody teach you how to play with
others.  Sharing is the first step in forming if not a lasting, than
at least a non-combative relationship."</p>

<p>"She started it," Carmen and Mary Cherry responded simultaneously
pointing at each other.  Brooke sighed.  This was a mistake, she
never should have gathered this group of people together in a
combined space.  It was one of the pitfalls of being a dreamer, she
was hopelessly optimistic.  Sometimes it paid off, other times it
slapped her upside the head.  </p>

<p>"I'll go," Mary Cherry said a second later, "if I can share with Lil'
Lily," she continued grinning at the alarmed looking brunette across
the room.</p>

<p>"No," Lily said.  "No way," she continued getting more
agitated.  "No," she went on her voice taking on a horrified quality.</p>

<p>Brooke looked down at a grinning Sam who mouthed to her `I told you
so' then continued to chuckle.  Brooke watched her highly amused
girlfriend with a scowl, how could a loved one take so much joy in
her pain.  Turning her attention from Sam momentarily Brooke looked
up in time to hear Lily yell "why does everything have to come back
to your ass!" at Carmen who yelled back "what kind of vegetarian hogs
a LEATHER couch?  Newsflash, that comfy piece of furniture ain't made
out of Tofu!"</p>

<p>Looking down Brooke saw Sam watching her, a gentle smile playing
across her lips, and she shrugged her shoulders and leaned back
against the couch happily.  Sam lifted her head up at this and
rearranged her position so that she was sitting beside Brooke and
rested her head on the blonde's shoulder as the cheerleader wrapped
her arm around the brunette's waist while whispering in her ear, "I
guess it's true, what they say about good intentions".</p>

<p>"What's that sound?" Jane asked as they entered the house.  Most of
the lights were off, but they seen a faint light coming from the
living room.  This was the first night she and Mike had gone out seen
learning about the girls relationship.  After having laid down the
ground rules—which they had an absolute aneurysm coming up with—they
had finally realized that sooner or later they were going to have to
leave Brooke and Sam alone together at some point, so the night
before they had grandly announced that they had theatre tickets and
that the girls would have the house to themselves.  However, in a
thoughtful gesture—perhaps having spotted the cold sweat they had
entered while making the announcement—the girls had responded by
asking if it was okay if they had a few people over.  Mike and Jane
nodded vigorously in agreement to this, warmed by the girls
sensitivity and delicacy, believing that the offer was an olive
branch signaling that the girls realized what an unusual and
confusing situation they were all in.  But that's what they thought.
The truth was—and it was a truth that they didn't particularly need
to know—that Brooke and Sam had made this grand gesture knowing that,
even though they had been living like nuns for weeks, they would not
be able to have intimate relations knowing that their parents knew
they were having intimate relations.  They simply wouldn't have been
able to perform, as it were, under those circumstances, they were
psychologically blocked.  This made acting mature and philanthropic
much, much easier for them.</p>

<p>"It sounds like grunting," Mike responded scowling.</p>

<p>Slowly they made their way towards the living room, glancing inside
somewhat hesitantly.  The noise they had heard was indeed grunting
and looking at the occupants of the room they now knew the source of
it.  Mary Cherry had Carmen in a head lock, and because of this
Carmen was grunting trying to free her cranium from Mary Cherry's
tyrannical grasps.  In response Mary Cherry grinned and was singing a
song that sounded like "Baby-back, Baby-back, Baby-back riiiiiibs."
Whatever that meant.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room Lily was sitting in the recliner like a
centurion.  She was holding the fire-poker in a death grip, her eyes
trained on Mary Cherry.  Every once in a while she would make a
poking gesture, as if to tell the occupants of the room that she
wasn't just holding the poker, she knew how to use it, before
focusing on Mary Cherry once again with an almost homicidal intensity.</p>

<p>Nicole and Harrison were off by themselves, circling the coffee like
a pair rabid dogs.  From his vantage point Mike was ninety percent
sure that Nicole had her teeth bared and that Harrison was foaming at
the mouth slightly.  In the center of the coffee table lay the
remote, and every couple of seconds on of them would reach for it
only to have their hand clawed at by the other.  They would then draw
the wounded appendage back towards their bodies and growl before
beginning to circle the table once more.  Mike was almost certain he
had seen this before on the discovery channel only it had been with
baby Pandas.</p>

<p>And finally Brooke and Sam were by themselves sitting on the floor in
front of the larger of the two leather couches.  Sam was sitting in
between Brooke's legs with her knees drawn up serving as a sort of
desk for a notepad that Brooke was pointing and gesturing at
emphatically.</p>

<p>Mike and Jane turned to look at each other.  What the…  </p>

<p>"See, it's clever."  The parents turned when they heard Brooke's
voice.  They had been frozen in position by the utter strangeness of
the scene they walked in on, and they were now unable to remove
themselves.  They were fascinated, and Mike thought that the little
bit they had seen was much better than `The Vaginal Monologues' and
he wasn't even paying to watch this.</p>

<p>"There's nothing there," Sam said looking at the notebook Brooke had
been pointing to before.  Her voice was calm and soothing, as if
speaking to a small child.</p>

<p> "That's it exactly.  That's the point," Brooke exclaimed happily,
glad that Sam finally seemed to have caught on.  "That's why its
significant," she continued dramatically resting her case.</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean anything," Sam insisted.  Jane thought that she saw
Sam smirk as she said this, but she couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>"But it does," Brooke responded petulantly.  "It's a very significant
statement.  Without you my life would be a font of nothing.  That's a
very significant statement," she repeated at a loss for what else to
say.   "And clever," she added at the last minute.  </p>

<p>Sam responded to this by gently taking the unused pen out of Brooke's
hand and patting the appendage patronizingly before beginning to
write something in the notebook.  Brooke watched all of this with a
pout on her face, her head hanging in mopey, hang doggish way, but
she said nothing.  She was certain that in the end she would be
vindicated and it would be proved that `font of nothing' was indeed
brilliant.</p>

<p>"I like this better," Sam said finally as she pointed to the piece of
paper.</p>

<p>"Life without you would be like a broken pencil," Brooke read aloud
with an incredulous expression on her face.  "The fuck?" she asked
looking over at Sam.  Mike scowled some more when he heard this, his
baby sure had grown up fast.</p>

<p>"A broken pencil is completely pointless.  It's got this one purpose
on earth and it can no longer fulfill it.  It's an object without a
function, it represents a life without meaning," Sam responded
helpfully in a rather scholarly tone.</p>

<p>"That's the exact same thing as a font of nothing!" Brooke exclaimed
in a agitated tone.  Sam turned to look back at her girlfriend, her
face was red, she was all flustered.  Brooke looked at her blinking,
her lips quivering slightly.  She looked like a puppy who'd had their
favorite chew toy taken away.  Sam was immediately contrite.</p>

<p>"I was just rompin'," Sam responded gently.  She was helpless to
resist Brooke when she was all flustered and doe eyed and utterly
precious.  Iced tea, a dollar fifty-nine.  Lava Lamp, sixty-four
dollars.  Bonsai tree that dies three days later, fifty-dollars.
Brooke all flustered and precious, priceless.  "A font of nothing is
brilliant," she continued taking Brooke's hand into hers.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," Brooke responded somewhat pacified by Sam's
change of heart.  Sometimes she thought that brunette tried to get
her all flustered on purpose.  "Look, now I'm all agitated," she
continued dropping her head down to rest on Sam's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Poor baby," Sam responded placing a kiss on the top of Brooke's head.</p>

<p>"Poor baby," Brooke mumbled piteously into Sam's shoulder.  However,
despite her tone there was a smile on her face and she pressed a
brief kiss to the side of Sam's neck</p>

<p>"Mamma knows child, mamma knows," Sam responded shifting slightly so
that she could see Brooke's face.</p>

<p>"Font of nothing," Brooke mumbled.  Sam observed her for a second
with a smile on her face.  Life without her certainly would have been
a font of nothing.  Wiping such depressing thoughts from her head she
leaned forward and brought their lips together kissing Brooke
chastely on the lips.  </p>

<p>When they broke apart Brooke sent Sam a big goofy smile, and Sam
smiled back at her with the same sappy-ass expression.  After the
cavity inducing moment, Brooke then, still grinning, playfully walked
her fingers up Sam's side.  "Brooke, no.  No.  Brooke!" Sam said
pleadingly, but it was not use, the blonde started tickling her
anyway.  Soon Sam was reduced a wiggling pile of flesh in Brooke's
arms alternately laughing and pouting while the blonde hugged and
prodded her happy as a lark.</p>

<p>At this Mike and Jane managed to tear themselves away from the scene
in front of them and continued down the hallway to the stairs.  They
were quiet as they made their way up the stairs and across the
landing to their bedroom, each occupying their own vista of
contemplation, though they were considering the same subject.  As
they passed the guest bedroom — now Sam's permanent residence, a fate
the brunette had come to grudgingly accept — she shook her head.  She
supposed that all things considered the new arrangement in the house
was working out adequately.  However, lord knew dinner parties were
going to be a bitch!</p>

<p>"That was…" Mike said trailing off, shrugging his shoulders
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Yep," Jane agreed smiling.  "But if you think things are crazy now,"
she continued sitting down and the bed and taking off her
stockings, "you just wait until they find out I'm pregnant."</p>
