<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 45 -->

<p>Mike watched Brooke head out the door, Sam had exited the house just
before her and from his position in the hallway he could see the
brunette getting into the back of Nicole's convertible.  Brooke was
soon out the door too shutting it behind her with a soft click.  He
noted sadly that the fluidity of movement Brooke seemed to have been
possessed with since she came out of the womb was absent then, and
had been absent for a long time, since they had found out about the
girls relationship he admitted.  Her shoulders seemed to now have a
perpetual slump to them, and her feet dragged along the ground as if
she couldn't spare the energy to lift them up properly anymore.
There was an ungainliness to her movements, like the metronome inside
of her, which had previously guided her motions, had been
unceremoniously smashed into tiny little bits leaving her shaken and
unsure.  It broke his heart to see this shriveled up, broken down
version of his daughter roaming around.</p>

<p>Jane walked up behind him, placing her hand on his shoulder.  He had
been staring at the closed door for over a minute.</p>

<p>"Come sit down," she said softly, guiding him towards the dinning
room.</p>

<p>"They're miserable," he said as he slumped down into the chair Jane
had guided him too.  She moved around the table and sat opposite him.</p>

<p>"I know," she said.  Whatever it was the girls were feeling inside
showed through every movement they made, every word they spoke and
even more through every word they left unspoken.  Despondency was
draped around them, greeting you every time you looked at their
faces.  They were like shells of their former selves, hollowed out
waiting for a time when they could come back into themselves without
fear of having their hearts ripped again.</p>

<p>Jane blew out a tired breath, ruffling her hair as she thought about
it.  Every morning they woke up at the same time they always had,
they put on the same clothes they had put on countless numbers of
times before, applied the same make up to the same places as they
always had, and they ate the same breakfasts they always did.  Yet,
despite the sameness of their routine, despite performing the same
activities that had always left them fresh and vibrant and shimmering
with youth and promise, they now looked haggard, fruitless.  Jane
assumed that a large part of that came from the fact that they, or at
least Sam, wasn't sleeping, just tossing and turning or wandering
around the room like a ghost.  It gave them the looks of those abused
puppies in humane shelter commercials.  There was a constant cloud
over them, a gaping darkness sucking at them and those that
surrounded them.  They had come to embody misery, dejection and
melancholy.  They did not wear tragedy masks, they didn't need to,
their actual faces were doing quite well of their own.</p>

<p>"They were talking in the kitchen a few nights ago," Mike
revealed.  "I listened," this was said in a softer, almost apologetic
tone.  He sounded guilty and Jane knew how he felt, they were guilty
of the same thing, partners in life and crime.  "I don't know what to
think.  They sounded so sincere.  No artifice, no theatrics, just raw
emotions, for no ones consumption but their own…or so they thought."</p>

<p>"What did you hear?" Jane asked leaning forward slightly, resting her
elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"Gentleness, concern, comfort, declarations of undying love, begging,
fear.  I heard a truth I could have blissfully ignored," he responded
thoughtfully, his voice sounding far away. "I hesitate to call it
love because of some antiquated notions I can't quite seem to get out
of my head, but I do believe that…that they care deeply about each
other."</p>

<p>"I asked Sam," Jane said a moment after Mike finished speaking, "what
I was suppose to do about this," she continued folding and unfolding
her hands.  "She told me nothing…short of sending one of them to
another country."</p>

<p>"That night, Brooke said not even that would be enough," Mike
interjected scratching his chin.</p>

<p>"I don't know about you…but I believe them," Jane responded, the last
part of her comment coming out in a half laugh, half moan.  The
ludicrousness of the situation, the utter improbability of a
condition like this one developing, momentarily overwhelming her.  If
she weren't so completely depressed by the circumstances she would
have found it terribly amusing.</p>

<p>"Me too," Mike responded, a dark bark of laughter following the
admission.  He shook his head and scratched his chin again.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" Jane asked rubbing the corner of her left
eye.  How many times had they asked each other this question?  How
many times had they wrung their hands, and shaken their heads trying
to answer this one little question?  If she had been keeping count,
she would have lost track of it a long time ago.</p>

<p>"What can we do?"  Mike asked haltingly, giving the question the feel
of a semi-formed of idea that reached maturity as it was spoken out
loud.  He had had an epiphany.  What could they do?  Nothing,
nothing, and nothing. </p>

<p>Jane stared at him for a moment a irreverent smile appearing on her
face briefly before she spoke.  "Regulate," she answered
finally.   "Things have been done that can't be reversed.  What we
have to do is … manage," she said choosing the word carefully, "the
resulting situation.  I'm not sending my baby anywhere which leaves…"</p>

<p>"Regulation," Mike supplied closing his eyes.  "Oh lord," he muttered
shaking his head.  "I'll go get some paper and a pen," all the
ingredients needed for a royal decree, "you start thinking about what
our … policy, should be," he continued standing up and moving towards
the door as Jane shot him look.  Why'd he get to be the paper
gatherer?  "Oh, and number ten or so should be that Brooke has to get
rid of that `Pull Up To My Bumper' poster," he continued ignoring the
look Jane was shooting at him. </p>

<p>"The Brady's never had go through this," Jane muttered as she thought
about thinking about criteria for supervising the girls relationship,
and became utterly depressed by her hypotheticals.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Mike said as he started out the door.  "I always
wondered about Greg and Marsha."</p>
