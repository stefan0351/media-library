<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 2 -->

<p>They made me go back to school after she woke up.  Something about my  having to go on with my life, not to forget what happened but to heal  from it.  I didn't really want to leave, that room had become like my  home, but I wasn't going to argue.  It went completely against my  nature, but standing there in the hospital hallway, Brooke lightly  slumbering in the room beside us I just couldn't fight with them.  I  couldn't do it to them or to myself.</p>

<p>School, however was a serious mistake.  I really think that they  sound have suggested a nice stroll along the beach or an iced  cappuccino from Starbucks for those certainly would have been far  more therapeutic activities.  Instead they threw me into the lion's  den.</p>

<p>The moment I walked into the school there was a collective gasp and  then silence, as the students suddenly parted in front of me like the  Pastel Sea.  I think that I laughed in my head.  As I made my way  through the halls the passage behind me would close up and I could  hear whispers.  I think that they were loud enough that I could have  understood them if I had cared, but I had become quite adept at  shutting out unwanted noises and I definitely didn't want them.</p>

<p>Lily was the first to spot me, don't ask me how because really I  don't know.  All I remember is feeling something wrap around me mid- section and looking down to see her enveloping me in a bear hug.   Then moments after that I felt a warmth behind me, and suddenly I had  grown two new arms.  Carmen was comforting me from behind.  They were  talking to me but I don't couldn't hear what they were saying, and  this time it wasn't my fault, mumbling as they were into my clothes  and cutting off my oxygen supply with surprisingly strong embraces.</p>

<p>"Hi," I said as they pulled away.  </p>

<p>After I spoke they both looked at me keenly for a few seconds then  launched themselves back at me.  I think that maybe my clothes didn't  match and they realized what truly horrendous shape I was in.   Needless to say, the hugging went on for quite some time.</p>

<p>"We heard she woke up."  It was Josh who said this after Carmen and  Lily had decided that I would be able to breath without them manually  pumping me, and we stood in an awkward silence.</p>

<p>"Saturday night," I said nodding and turning to face him.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call?"  I recognized they sulky, slightly accusing  voice as Harrison's without having to turn around.  He was standing  on the other side of me, leaning against a locker.</p>

<p>"I did, I called our parents and then we were all kind of occupied  with the getting our hearts to beat again because she was actually  going to be okay," I responded tiredly.  I saw the others shot him a  look.  It was obviously a question that they had discussed beforehand  and decided not to ask out of tactfulness or whatever.</p>

<p>"How is she?" Carmen asked moments later neatly diffusing the tension  that had begun to begin moments before.</p>

<p>"She says it doesn't hurt, but she was also convinced for an hour or  two that her IV pole was alive and kept calling it Mrs. Norris, so  really we've mostly been talking to Morphine McQueen," I said rubbing  at my eyes trying to get them to focus.  </p>

<p>When I looked around at them, they all stood there eyeing me  uncertainly.  Didn't they know that dark humor was one of the best  ways to relieve post - traumatic stress?  Looking at their faces I  was sure that if they had heard the jokes Brooke and I were making  late Saturday night/early Sunday morning they would have fainted.   They were in far worst taste, and cheered us up even more than the  Jell-O pudding snacks we had been given earlier.</p>

<p>"The cuts and bruises are healing okay," I said choosing to ignore  their looks and continue.  "She's still got a concussion but the  swellings gone down."</p>

<p>"And…"  Carmen started then stopped, no doubt wondering if her  question would distress me reducing me to tearful, mucusy sobs.  But  I knew what she was going to ask, she was going to say `and her leg'  because those who were there saw the terrible angle it had settled  at, and those who weren't no doubt had been told by those who were.   There was nothing like a near fatality to bring people together.</p>

<p>"That's going to take some work," was all I said, was all I could  say.  I didn't like to think about her leg.  "We should…you know,  class," I continued immediately.  They knew what this meant, no more  talking about Brooke, at least for the moment, so the nodded and we  head off.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the day I got similar questions thrown at me  from everyone, but mostly from the people who knew her so intimately  because they had seen her picture in the yearbook, or they stood  behind her in the lunchroom that one time.  Fakers, posers with their  quivering lips and stuttering voices.  I don't remember what I said  to them if anything, just that they irritated me to no end.  </p>

<p>I suppose, when something tragic and horrific and dramatic like this  happens, it happens to every one.  Everyone seems to realize how  precious life is, how unpredictable, that at anytime anything could  happen to anyone of them.  It makes everyone melancholy and  introspective, and they want to connect with it, somehow to be apart  of it, maybe to learn or to assure themselves that they are still  alive.  So people like me are questioned and badgered and have to  share our grief, our terror with the masses, like good little  soldiers.  "She'll be alright", but what if she hadn't been.  "We're  all just trying to put things back together", but things will always  be different; nothing will be the same again.  "She thanks you for  your support"; she doesn't know you, just like you don't know her.   It was suffocating, and I couldn't wait for the day to end.</p>
