<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 39: "Broke-down Palace" -->

<p>"She always has to push it," Jane said agitatedly as she paced the
span of their bedroom restlessly.  "The easy road, no not my Sam,"
she continued shaking her head.  "You know, I was really becoming
okay with the whole Sam is gay thing.  I was being very mom of the
new millennium about it.  I bought an Alice Walker book!" Jane
exclaimed excitedly.  "I think I could have come around to the whole
Brooke is gay thing too.   We do live in L.A. after all.  But, this
gay together ... this, this, this, being gay together.  No.  I'm
sorry.  I don't think it's too much to ask that they be gay with
other people...other *celibate* people!" </p>

<p>"They said they didn't...you know, do it," Mike responded clinging to
the last shred of hope he had.  Jane had had far more time to prepare
for the gay in general than he did, and he most definitely wasn't
ready to approach the gay together.  How could both of them be gay?
Seriously, what were the odds.  He tried to calculate them, and they
were about on par with the odds of the Florida Marlins winning the
World Series.  This was a mathematical improbability, he was sure of
it.</p>

<p>"I know," Jane, said dismally.  "That just means it's 90% likely they
have!  I mean, that's what I told my mom, and I SO had," she
continued spinning about to face her finance.  Her soon to be
husband.  The man she had asked to adopt her daughter.  Sam's soon to
be father.  She placed her hands in her head and took a deep
shuddering breath.  God, they were practically sisters.  Sure, they
weren't related by blood, and it wasn't illegal in 49 states or
anything — as far as she knew — but still.  Jane was officially
overwhelmed. </p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" Mike asked.  Of the two of them Jane
seemed to have a better handle on the situation and he was willing to
leave things to her discretion if it meant that he didn't have to
think about it at the moment. </p>

<p>Jane stared at him for a moment, then dramatically threw her hands up
in the air in the universal 'I duh nuh' gesture.  </p>

<p>"Do you think they'll stop if we tell them too?" Mike asked
hopefully. Jane shot him a look that could peel paint and he was
quite again. </p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Sam asked watching Brooke leaf through
something in the kitchen.  They had sat for a while, but upon hearing
a thump upstairs, they decided that it would be better to be in an
upright position so that they could run away, or leap over high
furniture in a single bound, if need be.</p>

<p>"How do you feel about snow?"  Brooke asked trailing her finger down
the piece of  paper studiously.  </p>

<p>"It's alright I suppose.  Why?"  Sam asked suspiciously as she walked
over to Brooke. </p>

<p>"We could move to Ontario and get hitched.  If we did that not only
could they not do anything about it, we'd be able to legally drink in
a few years, AND we'd get free medical care … I think, they're
socialist right?" Brooke responded turning to observe Sam's
reaction.  The brunette merely stared at her.  "It was just a
suggestion," Brooke mumbled putting the bus schedule away.  "It could
have worked," she responded when Sam continued to merely stare at
her.  Sam just stared at her some more.  "Okay, maybe not, but at
least I'm trying here." </p>

<p>"That's true," Sam responded thoughtfully.  She should try and come
up with something too. Unfortunately the only thing she could think
of was,  "They're also very tolerant in Sweden." </p>

<p>"Why are the cold countries so much more progressive?" Brooke asked
thoughtfully as she idly leaned against the kitchen counter.  Sam
shrugged.  Brooke shrugged back.  They were too busy wondering where
their parents were going to bury their bodies to consider such things
at the moment. </p>

<p>"Well, we've already established that Sam is moving into the guest
bedroom," Jane said trying to force her brain to work.  "That
conjoined bathroom is like a modern day underground railroad of
debauchery," she continued somewhat bitterly as she frowned. </p>

<p>"We could also get cameras and an intercom system, and then yell at
them over the loud speakers if we saw an inappropriate touching,"
Mike suggested, his mind filling with design specs instead of images
of his daughter engaged in debauchery with Gina Gershon, Jr. </p>

<p>"Scar them for life so that they'll never be able to have a healthy
relationship!  Why didn't I think of that," Jane responded
sarcastically, making it perfectly clear to everyone where Sam got it
from.   "What about boarding school?" </p>

<p>"They're mostly all girls," Mike responded.   They looked at each
other and crossed that one off the list.  They were going to be at
this for a while.</p>
