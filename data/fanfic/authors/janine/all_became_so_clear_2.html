<!-- And It All Became So Clear \ Part 1 -->

<p>I was sitting at one of the tables in the library cataloguing some
ghoulish facts when the doors opened and Buffy walked in. She was wearing cargo pants and
a tank top, casual wear for her. She looked fantastic. I'm not sure but I think I smiled
when I saw her. She glanced at me then went towards Giles's office to look for him.</p>

<p>&quot;He's not in there. There was an emergency staff meeting or
something. He said he'd be back in about half an hour.&quot; I told her looking at the
clock to verify. She turned around and walked towards me then dropped into the chair
beside me.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you are you and what have you done with Willow?&quot;
she asked fixing me with a stare.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow is I and we...I mean I am fine,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you so chatty today? You've directed two whole
sentences at me and waited for the response,&quot; she said. I sighed. I knew I had been a
jerk and I really had hurt her. She uses the wit to hide the hurt. I was being bombarded
with the wit.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry? About what exactly?&quot; she inquired. I actually had
quite a list to choose from. They say variety is the spice of life.</p>

<p>&quot;For being so scarce. Scarce isn't what I planned on being but
then I got a headache and all the fog started to come, and I had a lot to deal with. I'm
new at the dealing and when I tried to deal the scarce came,&quot; is what I said to her.
We were all used to my babbling but usually they were more coherent than that.</p>

<p>&quot;Talk to me Will, we're friends. Let me help you with whatever
has got you. Dealing is a lot harder alone. Believe me, I know.&quot; Her voice was
gentle, and concerned. Some time during her speech she had placed her hand on my knee and
I could feel the heat radiating from it. I wanted to tell her so much, but I was afraid.
The truth was that I needed her to be in my life. I really did. Even if it was just as my
friend. I could learn to get my feelings under control, I already had. I simply couldn't
risk telling her and have her walk away from me forever. The thought of that happening
scared me more than any vampire or demon. So I did the only thing that I could. I lied.
Well told a half truth.</p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing to tell really. I mean it's just everything
that's happened recently. It's all just really confusing. So much has happened in the last
two years. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it all now. I'm sorry.&quot; I told her.
She nodded but didn't say anything. She lowered her gaze and I could tell that she was
blaming herself. How she manages to work everything out to be her fault I'll never know.
&quot;It's not your fault, Buffy. You can't blame yourself for me going through
adolescence.&quot; I told her placing my hand over hers, which was still on my knee. I
felt her body tense, I knew it wasn't because I put my hand over hers though I kept it
there.</p>

<p>&quot;It is my fault that you're going through it with vampires
trying to kill you on a weekly basis. It is my fault that you've been hospitalized more in
the past two years then in your entire life before that. It's my fault that--&quot; I
stopped her there not being able to stand her berating herself like that.</p>

<p>&quot;None of those things are your fault Buffy. If you weren't here
I would probably be dead now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No you wouldn't, because I wouldn't have been here to place
you in danger.&quot; She countered.</p>

<p>&quot;You wouldn't have been here to save me either. I live on a
hell mouth. I'm always in danger. You protect me, and give me a chance to make a
difference, and if I get hurt it's my fault. I make my own decisions. You've taught me
about courage, and character, and friendship and lo&#133; you've taught me and given me so
much Buffy and I am thankful everyday that you came to Sunnydale. Please stop blaming
yourself for everything. It's too much weight to carry on your shoulders. You've already
got the fate of the world on them, you don't need Willows pre-mid-mid life crisis' up
there too.&quot; I told her. I said more than I had planned on and nearly gave it all away
but I was glad I said it.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#133;&quot; She started to say something but then just shook
her head and smiled. &quot;I was suppose to be giving you the pep talk,&quot; she said
after a moment. I shrugged, I felt better after letting that stuff out. &quot;You're a
good friend Will, the best. I don't know what I'd do without you,&quot; she said then
stood up. &quot;Giles will be here soon I'd better get things set up,&quot; she said then
walked over to the cage and started dragging out equipment. I however just sat there
feeling my knee tingle where her hand had been and thought that despite everything that
was going on I was pretty damn lucky.</p>

<p>I stayed and watched them spar, clapping when Buffy made a
particularly good move and laughing when Giles was dumped on his butt. Mostly I just
watched Buffy though, no internal debate, no worries, just love. I had fallen hard and I
knew it, boy did I know it.</p>

<p>Things settled down over the rest of the week. I rejoined the group,
babbling as usual, we were all without significant others and Cordelia hated us again. I
didn't so much like the fact that Cordelia hated us again though. Firstly I had started to
like her a little bit. I mean she could be nice--sometimes--and she helped me accessorize.
But now that the bitch was back, I was fair game again and, unlike Buffy, and to a certain
degree even Xander, I didn't have any stinging remarks to hurl back at her.</p>

<p>Currently we, that being myself, Buffy and Xander were at the
library. We were always at the library.</p>

<p>&quot;You patrolling tonight Buffster?&quot; Xander inquired in his
uniquely charming way.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Xand-man,&quot; Buffy replied, rolling her eyes. It was
Friday, Buffy patrolled every Friday and Xander knew it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well if you get done early Will and I are going to be watching
some of the classics, and the more the merrier,&quot; Xander told her picking up his
backpack. &quot;Spartacus, Buff, you can't miss Spartacus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll keep that in mind, Roger,&quot; Buffy said with a smirk.</p>

<p>&quot;Try and stop by if you can. We'll be at my crib,&quot; I said.
Things had been a little weird with Xander since the incident and Buffy acted as well,
sort of a buffer to the weirdness. I wasn't worried about something happening with Xander,
that was way over, but weird was weird.</p>

<p>&quot;Will, I hate to break this to you but you're a white Jewish
girl, you don't have a 'crib',&quot; Buffy responded. My attempts at cool were usually the
exact opposite. &quot;We'll see if the ghouls co-operate. If I can I'll be,&quot; she
continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Ready?&quot; Xander asked. He was talking to me. We were going
to try to do some math homework before the vid-fest and it was getting late. I nodded.
&quot;Later.&quot; He called to Buffy as we headed out of the library.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I yawned and snuggled further into my blanket. Xander had left a few
minutes ago and I had returned to the couch. Jerry Springer was on but I wasn't really
watching it. I supposed I should get up and go to bed but I really didn't feel like
moving. Finally, I clicked off the tube and stepped over the empty the popcorn bowl with
every intention of going to my room and to sleep. Things didn't work out that way however.
As I exited the family room I heard a knocking at my door. I figured it was Xander coming
back because he forgot something so I wasn't to worried. Still, years of parental nagging
forced me to look through the peephole first. It was Buffy. Smiling I yanked open the
door. When I did I was shocked by what I saw. Buffy was covered in blood and slightly
hunched over. She looked pale and literally stumbled into the house. I shut the door
behind her and looked her over, a gasp escaping my lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Things didn't go so well,&quot; Buffy said. She tried to smile
but failed.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; I said in a whisper. I reached for her, I
couldn't believe it. &quot;We've got to get you to the hospital,&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said forcefully. Her voice almost sounded
normal.</p>

<p>&quot;But Buffy you're bleeding. You need to see a doctor,&quot; I
said. My hand was now covered in her blood too.</p>

<p>&quot;No. It's not so bad Will. Really. It'll be alright, we can
clean it up. If I go to doctors, they'll want to run tests and draw blood and stuff. Not
to mention wonder why I'm completely healed in less than 48 hours. I don't need that. Do
you understand?&quot; she asked. I nodded as I carefully led her into the kitchen. I
understood the need for secrecy, it was just hard seeing her in pain.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you need me to do?&quot; I asked once I had her seated
in a chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Get a bowl of warm water, a needle, some thread, aspirin, and
a couple of towels. Make sure they're not white.&quot; She instructed. Her breathing was
labored and I could tell that talking to me was taking a lot out of her.</p>

<p>I rushed to get all of the items she requested. When I returned she
had taken off her jacket. There was a rip in her shirt, that looked like it was caused by
a knife or possibly a sword. She tore the area of the shirt around the wound until it
became visible. I gasped again when I saw it, and again she smiled weakly. It was a large
gash, twenty, maybe even twenty-five centimeters long.</p>

<p>&quot;Aspirin?&quot; She requested. I handed it over. After she
popped a few in her mouth she carefully washed the area around the wound with the hot
water and one of the towels. When she finished she had me thread the needle. I knew what
she planned on doing and it made my hands shake. When I finally got it thread she took it
from me and again told me not to worry. I felt bad, I was supposed to be helping her.</p>

<p>I watched as she carefully stitched up the wound. Every time the
needle punctured her skin she winced slightly but it didn't stop her from making the small
careful stitches necessary to ensure that there would be no scaring. When she was done she
dropped the needle and rested her head on the back of the chair. She looked exhausted. I
carefully cleaned the area she had just stitched making certain not to hurt her anymore. I
worked in a state of quiet awe. I had seen her save the world, and battle demons, but it
was the not so simple task of treating her wound which showed me just how strong she was.
How many people pass out from pain when on real drugs and having it performed by a
professional? No doubt some of it was being the Slayer, but a big part of it was Buffy,
and just Buffy. As I worked, I wished I could do more, that I could stop the pain, but all
I could do was make her comfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; she asked softly as I started to clean up.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered immediately returning to her side.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I stay here to tonight? Mom's out of town on a gallery
thing and I don't&#133;&quot; I didn't give her a chance to finish.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. Yes,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;Your parents?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;At a funeral out of town. Don't worry, Buffy, I'll take care
of you, I promise,&quot; I told her with absolute conviction. She smiled. &quot;Come
on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked as I maneuvered her into
an upright position.</p>

<p>&quot;To bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Getting up the stairs was quite a challenge. I considered trying to
make a make shift bed out of the couch, but Buffy insisted that we trek on. When we got to
my room, she sat on my bed while I searched through my drawers for something for her to
wear. I could feel her eyes on my and I wondered what she was thinking. Finally I found a
T-shirt and shorts that she could wear and handed them over to her before turning around
so she could change. After a few moments she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Will, a little help here?&quot; she asked. Turning to face her
I realized that with the injury getting dressed and undressed would be difficult, not to
mention painful, and might actually cause her to re-open the wound, which neither of us
wanted. Slowly I walked towards her taking the shirt out of her hands. &quot;Go ahead it's
okay,&quot; she said when she saw me hesitate. Taking a deep breath I reached for her
shirt and started to pull it up. I stopped quickly and moved away however when she placed
her hand on my shoulder stopping me. &quot;Will, get back here.&quot; She ordered softly.
&quot;I'm not that scary am I?&quot; she asked. I shook my head to indicate a negative.
She was the exact opposite of scary. She was a goddess.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you wanted me to stop,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's okay. I was just going to say that it would be easier
if cut or ripped off the shirt.&quot; She explained. &quot;It really doesn't matter since
the thing is seriously deceased,&quot; she said gesturing to the tattered shirt she was
wearing. I nodded my head and went over to my desk to get a pair of scissors. I didn't
feel right about actually ripping her clothes off of her, especially since I had had a
dream about that the night before. Once I had the scissors I made another trip to my
drawer and pulled out a button up shirt that would be easier to put on her.</p>

<p>Once I was standing in front of her again I started cutting away the
material. As I was pushing the shirt off of her shoulders she started to laugh quietly. I
looked at her quizzically.</p>

<p>&quot;Could you imagine Xander's face if he walked in and saw
this?&quot; she explained. Despite my discomfort and rising body temperature, I had to
admit it made for a pretty amusing image and started laughing too. We would probably have
had to surgically re-attach his jaw.</p>

<p>I carefully put the other shirt on her after the remains of her
blood encrusted one had fallen to the floor. As I buttoned it up I had to concentrate on
stopping my hands from visibly shaking. She sighed as the cool clean material replaced her
old blood laden shirt and my hand, which had been reaching for her waistband, stopped as I
attempted to gain control of hormones which were racing out of control. Once I figured I
had control again I reached down and unbuttoned her pants, then pulled the zipper down.
Kneeling down I took hold and yanked them down around her ankles so she could step out of
them. Grabbing the shorts I placed them on the floor so she could step into them then
pulled them up. My head was level with her abdomen and I had to force myself into an
upright position.</p>

<p>&quot;All done,&quot; I said completely unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No problem,&quot; I responded walking towards the bed to pull
the covers down for her. &quot;After all if you can't trust your best friend to disrobe
you who can you trust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I don't have to worry about that,&quot; she said with
a grin as she slipped into the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess not.&quot; I agreed moving towards the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; she asked sitting up.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be in my parents room,&quot; I told her. She was silent
for a moment before speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Stay here?&quot; she requested. &quot;Please. It's been one
hell of a long night and I don't want to be alone,&quot; she continued. I looked at her
for a moment before nodding. Buffy didn't often admit weakness or ask for anything. I
couldn't refuse her this very reasonable request.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; I said slipping in on the other side of the
bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said once I was settled.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a problem,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;You're the best, Will,&quot; she said through a yawn.</p>

<p>&quot;No you are,&quot; I whispered once her breathing was steady in
sleep. It was hard but finally after tossing and turning for what seemed like forever I
feel asleep.</p>

<p>I awoke to a warm feeling on my right side. It felt good, new but
good. Opening my eyes I looked down to see Buffy curled up at my side. She was half lying
on top of me with her head on my shoulder. Her face was relaxed, and the morning sun
bathed her in a warm glow. She looked absolutely beautiful. I think I actually stopped
breathing for a minute. I knew that I should get up but I couldn't see a way to do so
without waking Buffy, so I lay there staring at the ceiling thinking about how completely
wonderful, and right it felt to be lying there with her.</p>

<p>I was startled out of my reverie when Buffy mumbled something and
snuggled closer to me. My heart seized again but this time in pain. I wondered who she was
thinking about. Angel? Scott? Some other mystery man who wasn't me? My mood changed after
that. I actually brooded.</p>

<p>A little while later Buffy shifted again allowing me room to slip
out of the bed. She groaned at the loss of contact but then snuggled into the pillow not
seeming to miss me at all. I crept out of the room quietly and headed down stairs to make
breakfast. Buffy would probably be hungry when she woke up, and seeing as how this was the
last time I would probably wake up with her in my arms I decided to make it special.</p>

<p>Half and hour later I heard footsteps on the stairs. Bringing the
food out to the table, I waited for Buffy. It all seemed so domestic it broke my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; she called out.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'm in the kitchen,&quot; I told her. She showed up in
the doorway a few seconds later, shirt askew and hair tousled. She looked absolutely
adorable.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I dreamed it all,&quot; she said heading towards the
table. &quot;Did you make this? It looks good. I can't cook at all. If mom even sees me in
the kitchen she freaks,&quot; she continued sitting down.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I just finished,&quot; I said joining her. &quot;Dreamed
what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything. I thought the injury was a dream until I tried to
stretch and the stitches made their presence known,&quot; she said making a face.
&quot;And I thought I dreamed you until I realized I wasn't in my bed,&quot; she
continued, snagging a few pancakes.</p>

<p>We ate in relative silence. I was depressed, and Buffy was packing
it away like a banshee. You would've thought that she hadn't eaten in weeks. I guess there
were some advantages to being a Slayer, one being that you could suck down as much food as
you wanted and still be buff. I watched her eat, watched her lips wishing I could kiss
them, getting more and more depressed with each lustful thought. We ended up watching the
movies from the night before after breakfast and I was even quieter than while we were
eating, which was quite a feat. I had already seen them so mostly I watched Buffy. She was
better than some movie anyway. Why watch a film about a hero when you have a real life one
sitting in your family room.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; she asked me once the movies
finished.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; I asked her. I was avoiding her question
but I also wanted to know. She seemed to be moving better since waking up.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be as good as new by tomorrow. I don't think you can say
the same thing though.&quot; She looked directly into my eyes now. &quot;What's up Willow?
You've been quiet for weeks now, very un-Will like. You snap out of it for a few days then
go back. It's like being around wicca Jeckle and wicca Hyde.&quot; She paused then,
seemingly thinking. &quot;It seems to get worse when I'm around. Did I do something?&quot;
she asked genuinely concerned. I hated myself for doing that to her.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I responded emphatically. &quot;You haven't done
anything except be the best friend anyone could ask for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what? And I'm not buying the Xander/Oz thing
anymore.&quot; I didn't respond right away because I didn't know what to tell her. I
didn't want to lie, keeping it inside was tearing me apart, but I was still afraid to tell
her. &quot;Please, Will. Don't you know you can tell me anything. I love you, I'll always
be here.&quot; I looked down at her when she said 'I love you'. I know she meant it as a
friend but maybe it was enough. I decided that I would tell her. Even if she didn't feel
the same way I was certain she would still be my friend.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you too, Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good, I'm glad we're agreed,&quot; she said with a smile.
&quot;Now, what's bothering you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's it,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;It bothers you that you love me?&quot; she asked
semi-confused.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you don't understand. I don't just love you, I'm in love
with you,&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am in love with you,&quot; I said looking her in the eye,
enunciating every word. She started at me for a moment, I could see her processing the
information.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; she asked softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. I watched as a myriad of emotions played
over her face. Then she stood up suddenly and looked out the window. Startled I sat up.
&quot;Please don't leave,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I added, hanging my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be sorry, Will,&quot; she said softly as she turned to
face me. &quot;It's a beautiful thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is?&quot; I asked her, wanting to believe what I was
hearing so much.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes it is,&quot; she said. She moved her hand to cup my cheek,
and continued to look at me. Study me. &quot;When Angel&#133;turned, do you know why he
went after you?&quot; she asked after a minute, her eyes boring into mine.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; I answered confused by the change in subject.</p>

<p>&quot;It was because he knew that you were the one. That you meant
more to me than any other. When he told that, I thought he was nuts, I mean he was nuts,
but he was right.&quot; Her thumb was stroking my cheek and I leaned into the touch.
&quot;I thought about it afterwards and realized he was right. You are the one I turn to,
the one who comforts me, the one I feel safe with, the one who makes me laugh. You are the
one. The one I love more than any other,&quot; she finished, then she slowly leaned
forward and our lips met in a soft kiss. When I didn't pull away she moved her lips over
my bottom one and sucked gently, stroking across the smooth softness with her tongue. I
exhaled against her lips then pressed my lips to hers as she slid her hand across my back
and I moved mine up to hold her close as she parted my lips with soft strokes. Passion
rose between us, both of us drawing in breath deeply as it seared us-within seconds we
were kissing deeply, hungrily, mouths open and tongues tangling. I pressed into Buffy's
taut, strong body, eyes closed, trying to absorb every sensation that washed through me.
Buffy's mouth was insistent, demanding, soft moans melting into me as her hands held me
closely to her, pressing us together even more firmly. From my knees upward I was pressed
tight against Buffy's body, were devouring each other now, kissing so very deeply, taking
and giving, holding tight and letting go. Our breathing quickened, synchronizing as we
sought to consume one another utterly, no thought remaining except this sweet, breathless,
fluttering excitement sweeping us up and pulling us together. Buffy releasing sweet sounds
from deep in her throat, her tongue sliding over my lips softly exploring, withdrawing,
stroking, feasting&#133; until at last those lovely strong hand slid to my shoulder and we
drew away slowly, only for Buffy's mouth to seek out mine again and again, in short hungry
kisses as if she couldn't bear to let it end.</p>

<p>For several euphoric seconds, I stood motionless, eyes closed as I
savored the sweetness of it, the passion. It was so good, so incredibly passionate, just
like I thought it would be, and completely new and wonderful at the same time. Finally we
pulled away each struggling for breath but still holding each other close not wanting to
break the connection between us. Buffy's face was flushed and I knew that mine was as
well. I had never before in life experienced anything as wonderful and fulfilling as the
kisses we just shared.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; Buffy said softly after a moment. She sounded
surprised. &quot;I've never done that with you before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said in response. I'm usually more articulate
than that but the blood wasn't exactly rushing to my head at that point. Buffy looked at
our joined hands and smiled. I mirrored the action unconsciously.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#133; ah, should probably talk about this huh?&quot; she
asked after a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Talk is good,&quot; I agreed, though all I could really think
about was repeating our former aerobics.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, talk then,&quot; Buffy said gently pushing me down onto
the couch.</p>

<p>A knock at the door startled us and I jumped, literally, off of the
couch. We had had every intention of talking, I had put on my serious talking face and we
had even gotten out a few sentences, but her lips looked so inviting that I couldn't
resist planting a tiny kiss on them, and she of course had to retaliate, and I back and so
forth, and before we knew it we were engaging in full body groping. Her hand had just
started to creep under my shirt when I heard the knock and jumped up.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to answer it?&quot; Buffy asked. She was sitting
up now and looking at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Answer it?&quot; I asked distractedly. Then I remembered the
knock, &quot;Yeah!&quot; I said trying to engage my brain.</p>

<p>It was Xander, he had coffee and donuts and as soon as I opened the
door the bust in.</p>

<p>&quot;Sleep in much Will?&quot; he asked. I was still in my pajamas
and it had to be around one in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;No&#133;I&#133;it's&#133;&quot; I started to say but he had
already moved past me and was heading into the family room.</p>

<p>&quot;How come no one invited me to the sleep over?&quot; Xander
asked once I was in the room.</p>

<p>&quot;It was more like an episode of ER,&quot; Buffy said running a
hand through her disheveled hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy was hurt patrolling last night,&quot; I supplied in way
of explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Xander asked, concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy said with a dismissive wave. &quot;I wasn't
in such hot shape when I showed up but Willow's been taking really good care of me,&quot;
she continued with a smile. The double entendre was lost on Xander but it made me blush
which caused Buffy's smile to grow.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you you should have watched Spartacus,&quot; Xander
said taking a seat in the recliner beside the couch. He looked like he was settling in.
There was to be no settling.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep, she should've listened but didn't and blood ensued. What
can you do? I know get dressed. Yep, we've really got to get dressed, the taking off and
putting on of clothes, and the nudity you can't forget the nudity. You better go, we'll
call,&quot; I said trying to usher him off of the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;No problem I'll wait for you gals down here,&quot; he said
reaching for a donut. &quot;Don't take too long though, I might start to get ideas
involving the nudity.&quot; He continued as we walked out of the room. When he said that I
turned to Buffy and smiled, she laughed and we headed up the stairs quickly.</p>

<p>Buffy sat on the bed as I looked through my drawers for something
for her to wear. The irony of it all didn't escape me. Finally I decided on a pair of
hospital pants and a tank top for her. We dressed in silence, Buffy had more range of
movement today which was a good thing considering recent revelations. Playing strip tease
after our morning activities probably wouldn't have been such a great idea. As I finished
with my earrings I looked over to where Buffy was. She was sitting in front of the mirror
trying to brush her hair only she looked like she was having a spot of trouble. I walked
over to her and took the brush out of her hands taking over the job myself. When I was
finished I reached over her shoulder to place the brush down and she kissed my neck
briefly before taking my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. She had said that phrase quite a
bit in the past few days.</p>

<p>&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; I told her truthfully. There was
something wonderfully erotic about brushing her hair, running my fingers through it's
length. She watched me for a moment trying to decide on something then smiled and pulled
me down onto her lap.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; I protested. &quot;You're going to hurt yourself.
More,&quot; I added as she continued to hold my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;No I'm not,&quot; she said. &quot;There are some advantages to
being a Slayer.&quot; She was still smiling. She seemed to be bemused by my protests.
&quot;I want to&#133;&quot; she started to say after a moment then paused. She seemed to
be struggling with something so I didn't say anything. &quot;I want to make love to you so
much Will,&quot; she continued, her voice lowering. She was looking directly into my eyes
and I could see the desire shimmering there. It caused my breath to quicken, and it took
entirely to much concentration for me to get my next sentence out.</p>

<p>&quot;I want that too Buffy. So much,&quot; I told her. She looked
up at me then raised her hand to the back of my neck bringing our lips together. &quot;We
have to stop,&quot; I told her when I finally managed to break my lips away.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said regretfully. She looked towards the
door with disdain. When she turned back to face me I saw a pout on her lips. It was
absolutely too cute for words. &quot;We better go. Xander and ideas, especially those
involving nudity is not a good combination.&quot; I got off of her lap and straightened my
clothing. Once standing up as well Buffy followed suit. As we headed out the door she
turned to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I promise we'll talk about this. All of it once he's
gone,&quot; she said sincerely. &quot;For real next time.&quot; She added with a smile. I
nodded, for despite our enthusiasm we really did need to talk. I was almost glad for
Xander's interruption, I wanted things to be clear between us about what we were feeling
before we took it to the next step. There were things I needed to ask her. If Xander
hadn't showed up there would have been little clearing and lots of stepping. Mostly I
needed to be sure that she was feeling what I was feeling, because I didn't think I could
handle it if what was happening ended up being some rebound thing.</p>

<p>So side by side we headed down the stairs preparing to face the
world.</p>
