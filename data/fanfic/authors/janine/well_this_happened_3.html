<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 3 -->

<p>Sam regarded her friends carefully, bouncing on her feet a little, but
mostly watching her friends carefully.  After lunch Lily and Carm had made a
big production of ditching Harrison and then tracking her and staring her
down like prison wardens.  The last time she had seen that particular look
on their faces she had spilled just about all of the beans she had, and she
wasn't particularly looking forward to spilling anymore.  She quite felt
like holding onto her beans this time around.</p>

<p>"What?" she asked finally.  They had to get this over with sooner or later
and she and her beans preferred that it be sooner.</p>

<p>"Is everything alright?" Lily asked softly as she watched Sam keenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam replied drawing the word out as long as humanly possible before
bouncing on her feet some more and blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>Carm and Lily exchanged a look that did not go unnoticed by the prisoner.</p>

<p>"How's Brooke?" Carm asked, her voice had that lilt to it that people
usually reserved for small children and animals.  Sam didn't appreciate it.</p>

<p>"She's fine too," Sam responded preparing to bounce some more.  However once
she got onto the tips of her toes Carm reached and grabbed her shoulders
pushing her back down to the ground.</p>

<p>"Stop that," Carm admonished.  "Please, please stop that," she went on, her
voice holding a pleading tone to it.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Sam asked struggling to bounce under Carmyn's grasp.</p>

<p>"That!" Carm said pointing to Sam's feet.  "That psychotic bouncing. Up and
down, up and down, side to side, up and down.  Please, please stop!"</p>

<p>"Okay," Sam responded softly looking at Carm like she had two heads.  "I'll
stop, you just take a deep a breath.  Look, no more bouncing," she went on
smiling reassuringly.  She couldn't believe that she was the one they were
doing an intervention on when Carm was so obviously very, very tense.</p>

<p>"The thing is," Lily started after Carm nodded at indicating that she should
continue the interrogation while she gathered her wits, "that for the past
week you've been acting increasing like a speed freak and Brooke seems to be
acting according to the gospel of St. Bastard or something...so, we were kind
of wondering if...you know...you two were having problems...or something."</p>

<p>"We're fine," Sam responded.  But even as she spoke as shadow of something
crossed her face.</p>

<p>"No, no we don't think that you are.  Something is definitely wrong," Carm
responded having come back to herself.  "You know we're going to badger you
until you tell us, take the easy road for once Sam, you might even like it."</p>

<p>"Brooke and I are fine.  There is no trouble in paradise," Sam responded.
They simply stared at her and she got the distinct impression that they
wanted more.  "It's just that...well, paradise has gotten a few new
inhabitants since we spoke last and one of them, of the Dad variety,
fractured his ankle and doesn't leave the house.  Ever," she went on her
tone darkening and her brows scrunching together in consternation.  "Ever,"
she added again just for good measure.  "He's just there, all the time, like
a lawn gnome or dust mites or something."</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence then the exclamation of "Ohmygod!" by
Carm, which was followed my many mini 'ohmygods' until she forced herself to
calm down when passerby's started to look at her.  "You're not getting any,"
she whispered pointing at Sam knowingly.  "That's why you've been...and she's
been...ohmygod," she continued in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>"It's not funny," Sam whispered menacingly as she shot Carm a look that
would have made Medusa run away with her tail between her legs.  And it
wasn't funny, it was a terrible situation, absolutely abominable.  The
situation made her very, very sad, and very, very hyper, and it made Brooke
very, very cranky.</p>

<p>"I beg to differ," was Carmyn's response as she doubled over.  To Carm, this
was priceless, absolutely priceless.  Sam was always authoritative, so
imposing, that to see her dissolve into a restless pile of nerves was
absolutely priceless.</p>

<p>"Sam's right," Lily stated after Carm spoke.  "Sexual frustration can be
incapacitating, and routinely forces people to do things they wouldn't do
under normal circumstances.  In fact that's how the women of Sparta ended
the Peloponnesian war."</p>

<p>"What?  They wouldn't sleep with each other because they were afraid their
parents would catch them?" Carm asked dissolving into another giggle spree,
and just when she had started to get herself under control, damn!</p>

<p>"This is just great," Sam responded moodily as she bounced on her feet
unconsciously, sending Carm off into another set of laughter.  "Just know
that I hate you intensely at the moment," Sam continued before starting down
the hall.</p>

<p>Carm and Lily went after her.</p>

<p>"Come on Sam," Carm whispered once they had caught up.  "I'm not getting any
either," she continued starting to laugh again.  "Besides you'll always have
gym class, and spandex and cold, cold showers."</p>

<p>"You're evil," was all Sam said in response, before bouncing on her feet
again, an absolutely despondent look coming over her face.</p>

<p>"We've gotta get this girl outside for a while," Carm said turning to Lily.
She actually felt bad once she saw the look on Sam's face.  She looked like
one of the puppy dogs on those humane shelter commercials.  It was pathetic
in a rather compelling way.  She wanted to help.</p>

<p>"The cheerleaders are practicing," Lily responded absently.</p>

<p>"Let's go," Sam responded instantaneously making a U-turn and heading for
the stadium.  Once again Carmyn and Lily exchanged amused looks and
quickened their steps to catch up with their rapidly retreating friend.</p>
