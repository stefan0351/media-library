<!-- About a Girl \ Part 6 -->

<p><u><i>Two days later - Bonfire. Night.</i></u></p>

<p>Sensing a break in the conversation Jessie quickly excused herself  ducking away from the assembled group of ex-play people and made her  way across the field approaching a group of people, among whom Katie  was entrenched.  Catching Katie's eye and tilting her head to the  side Jessie watched as some life entered her eyes and she quickly,  very quickly, pushed her way past the people standing around her.</p>

<p>"My hero," Katie gushed as they entered the woods to escape the mass  of people occupying the field.  "I don't know if I could've taken  another second of that," she continued smiling over at Jessie.  "Did  you know that there are people out that actually like Carson Daily?"  she asked with a horrified expression.  "I was so scared.  I felt  like asking for my Mommy."</p>

<p>"Just returning the favor," Jessie responded through a laugh as she  watched Katie mock shiver in fright.</p>

<p>"What favor?" Katie asked absently bending down to pick up a stick,  and fencing with an imaginary enemy for a moment before turning her  full attention back to Jessie.</p>

<p>"For saving me from Tad and his tarantula impression, all those many  months ago," Jessie responded smiling over at Katie.</p>

<p>"Oh," Katie replied with a grin.  "Well, Tad's moves are an act  against humanity.  I was morally bound to rescue you, before he got  around to asking if your daddy was a thief," she continued rolling  her eyes at Tad's lameness.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did," Jessie responded reaching over and grasping  Katie's hand in hers as they made their way further into the  forest.  "Of course if anything like that happened now, more  strenuous measures would need to be taken," Jessie continued  conversationally. </p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked intrigued enough to stop obsessing about how  good it felt to be holding Jessie's hand long enough to listen to  her. </p>

<p>"Well, you would clearly have to declare a feud with his house, or at  the least insult his immediate family," Jessie responded trying to  keep her voice breezy although she was actually concentrating with  all her might to keep her voice from cracking.  "Now that I'm your  girl, you could do no less," she finished.</p>

<p>Katie was silent for a moment after she finished speaking, the sound  of their feet on the ground the only noise around them.  "My girl?"  she asked finally, a wide grin spreading across her face that was  clearly heard through her tone. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded.  "If you want," she continued softly,  looking down at the ground. </p>

<p>As the words reached her ears Katie stopped walking dragging Jessie  to a stop too seeing as how their hands were still held  together.  "My girl," she breathed out softly, as if testing out the  phrase.  "Yeah," she continued smiling again, tugging Jessie's hand  gently to bring them closer together before leaning forward and  pressing her lips against Jessie's happily. </p>

<p>Pulling back she watched as Jessie smiled up at her then moved  forward resting her head on her shoulder contently, a soft sigh  escaping her lips.  Katie drew her arms around Jessie, holding her  firmly against her as she carelessly drew tiny shapes on Jessie's  back with her fingers.</p>

<p>"Katie!  Jessie!" they heard from somewhere nearby.  It was Tad.</p>

<p>Reluctantly they pulled apart just before he burst out in front of  them.</p>

<p>"What're you doing out here?" he asked looking between them.</p>

<p>"Trying to figure out the fastest way to Mexico," Katie responded  glibly.  "What're you doing out here?"</p>

<p>"Had to clean out the pipe," Tad responded with a grin.</p>

<p>"Ewww, gross," Katie replied making a face.  "You didn't go on the  pathway did you?" she asked looking back the way they had entered.</p>

<p>Tad just smiled and said, "come on, the kegs here," then took off.</p>

<p>Katie shook her head then looked over at Jessie with a smile.  "Come  on, we're going to need to tap in to survive the rest of the night."</p>
