<p>Chemistry, I used to find this class interesting, I really did. The
problem I guess wasn't so much chemistry as it was that I seemed to having a lot of
trouble concentrating recently. I mean I couldn't follow a word the teacher was saying,
and these lapses in concentration seemed to be happening more and more frequently. To tell
you the truth I kind of felt like I was becoming lost in a dense fog. Everywhere I looked
nothing was clear and things I used to see were disappearing. To be quite honest it was
really a royal pain in the ass, after all I had a life to live, one that had just been
thrown into turmoil and really did need my undivided attention.</p>

<p>Shaking my head in an attempt-which failed miserably-to clear it I
looked up and at the back of the head in front of me. This may sound strange but I knew it
well. It, the head that is, was bowed down slightly. At least somebody was able to
concentrate. The reason I knew this head so well was because it belonged to my best
friend, Buffy Summers.</p>

<p>Buffy, was actually the cause of a lot of the haze surrounding me.
I'm not blaming her for it, but since she came to Sunnydale and into my life a few years
ago she's turned it upside down. My life was now remarkable, scary, exciting, confusing
and much more. To be certain things hadn't been boring since Buffy arrived in town. It was
just that as a result the last two years and perhaps who I knew myself to be where all up
for debate.</p>

<p>I was sure about one thing however, and that thing was perhaps a
bigger problem than all my other ones put together, and let me tell you my other ones were
considerable. Anyway when I finally moved out of la la land I saw Buffy staring at me. Her
lips were moving but I couldn't exactly be sure what she was saying. The word
&quot;Chloroplast&quot; came out of my mouth in response to her question. I can't be sure
why I said it but the answer seemed to satisfy her and she turned back around. Once her
back was completely towards me once again I let out a tiny sigh them propped my head on my
hand and turned to look out the window. It was sunny as usual. Sunny Sunnydale.</p>

<p>Buffy shot looks back at me throughout the rest of class. She was
worried about me, I knew that. Truthfully I had been avoiding her for quite some time, I
really had. A few times when she looked back at me I saw pain her eyes and I knew it
wasn't because of being the Slayer, or because of Angel but because of me and how I was
acting. I was hurting her by avoiding her. She would never say that but I could tell that
it was true. That in turn hurt me because the last thing I ever wanted to do was hurt
Buffy. She was probably the most important person in my life. She really was, and that was
part of the problem.</p>

<p>Anyway what I decided was that I was going to take off again today
after school before she could talk to me but that this would be the last time. I was going
to go home and deal with what I had to deal with and I was going to come to school the
next day and be my old babbling self. If there happened to be any residual stuff to deal
with then I would pretend to be my usual babbling self. Either way I was going to stop
hurting Buffy by avoiding her. And while I was at it I was going to have to think of a
convincing lie to tell her about why I was acting so strangely. I didn't want to lie to
her but I wasn't ready to tell her the truth yet. Once I got all of that settled I was
able to concentrate, a least a little bit.</p>

<p>I sat on my bed with a carton of ice-cream, butterscotch ribbon, in
front of me and a picture, framed, off to my side. I was eating the ice-cream straight
from the carton, I looked like the cliched troubled teenage agonizing over her adolescent
woes, and I was, I really was. In the framed picture was a photograph of Buffy. I can't
tell you how long I lay there looking at that picture, only that it was quite some time. I
was mesmerized. I always was by Buffy.</p>

<p>People say your teenage years are the best and hardest of your life.
I think that's true, but if you want to know a secret it's even harder when you're in love
with your best friend! You see there it is. I'm in love with Buffy. I told you it was a
big problem. I've known crushes, I can deal with crushes. After all I had one on Xander
for years.</p>

<p>My immediate and biggest problem was my love for Buffy. And it is
love, let me assure you of that. People are always quick to dismiss teenage love as lust
or hormones and truthfully most of the time it is. Case in point: Xander and Cordelia. But
other times it really is love and that's how it was for me. Who would have guessed that a
little Jewish girl would have such big problems? Not me, that's for sure.</p>

<p>A lot of the trouble lay with the fact that I was so unaware, or
perhaps in denial of my feelings for quite some time. It's not just a river in Egypt you
know. I had never recognized at least consciously an attraction to other women, and my
attraction to Buffy was intertwined with out friendship allowing me to deny it. How you
may wonder did I finally see the light? I'll tell you, it was a visit from the little
green-eyed monster. Yes, jealousy. When I learned the reason Angel lost his soul was
because he and Buffy had been together, I was consumed with an intense mixture of anger
and jealousy. I pushed it aside at the time because Buffy was hurting and needed me but I
felt it, boy did I feel it, and boy did it confuse me.</p>

<p>I managed to push it down, squash it and hide it away after that.
Sure I started looking around a bit more in gym class but that didn't mean anything. At
least that's what I told myself. Then there was Oz. He swept me off my feet, he really
did. Nobody had ever looked at me before, boy or girl, and I was charmed. He was funny,
and smart and a musician, and cute, and things went good for us. I mean I even got over
the whole werewolf thing. But then my feelings for Buffy started surface again. I would
watch her practice with Giles, watch how she moved, think about how beautiful she looked,
and then I would think 'Shut up brain. You like boys remember?' And so would go the
internal debate, over and over.</p>

<p>Then more trouble. I know, I know, it's something about living on a
hell mouth. It follows you around. What was this trouble? Xander. Finally after years of
indifference he decides he likes me. What do I do? I internally debate more, but finally
after years of want and a need to prove myself as a member of the heterosexual family, I
give in. What happens once I do? We get caught making smoochy, smoochy, and Oz won't talk
to me, and Cordelia impaled herself. But the worst part about it was that after it all
happened, and I was all sad, Buffy declared that we were having a slumber party. That's
not the bad part, what is is that in the middle of it I started crying. I mean I was
really bawling, I couldn't stop even though I wanted to. And Buffy, she came over to me
and wrapped her arms around me and kissed the top of my head and held me telling me that
everything would be alright. And I believed her. Sitting there in her arms despite all
that had happened I felt alright. What I realized was that I was exactly where I wanted to
be. After I got the crying under control I continued to kind of fake shake because I
didn't want her to let go. I never wanted her to let go. So sitting there wrapped in my
best friends embrace supposedly crying over my two lost men I let go, and I embraced my
feelings and let the love I felt for the woman holding me flood though my body.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to put it back since. So sitting on my bed
eating my ice-cream I was left with one question. What do you do with a woman who has no
love for you? Or more accurately, what do you do with a woman who can never love you the
way you love her?</p>

</table>

<p>I was sitting at one of the tables in the library cataloguing some
ghoulish facts when the doors opened and Buffy walked in. She was wearing cargo pants and
a tank top, casual wear for her. She looked fantastic. I'm not sure but I think I smiled
when I saw her. She glanced at me then went towards Giles's office to look for him.</p>

<p>&quot;He's not in there. There was an emergency staff meeting or
something. He said he'd be back in about half an hour.&quot; I told her looking at the
clock to verify. She turned around and walked towards me then dropped into the chair
beside me.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you are you and what have you done with Willow?&quot;
she asked fixing me with a stare.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow is I and we...I mean I am fine,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you so chatty today? You've directed two whole
sentences at me and waited for the response,&quot; she said. I sighed. I knew I had been a
jerk and I really had hurt her. She uses the wit to hide the hurt. I was being bombarded
with the wit.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry? About what exactly?&quot; she inquired. I actually had
quite a list to choose from. They say variety is the spice of life.</p>

<p>&quot;For being so scarce. Scarce isn't what I planned on being but
then I got a headache and all the fog started to come, and I had a lot to deal with. I'm
new at the dealing and when I tried to deal the scarce came,&quot; is what I said to her.
We were all used to my babbling but usually they were more coherent than that.</p>

<p>&quot;Talk to me Will, we're friends. Let me help you with whatever
has got you. Dealing is a lot harder alone. Believe me, I know.&quot; Her voice was
gentle, and concerned. Some time during her speech she had placed her hand on my knee and
I could feel the heat radiating from it. I wanted to tell her so much, but I was afraid.
The truth was that I needed her to be in my life. I really did. Even if it was just as my
friend. I could learn to get my feelings under control, I already had. I simply couldn't
risk telling her and have her walk away from me forever. The thought of that happening
scared me more than any vampire or demon. So I did the only thing that I could. I lied.
Well told a half truth.</p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing to tell really. I mean it's just everything
that's happened recently. It's all just really confusing. So much has happened in the last
two years. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it all now. I'm sorry.&quot; I told her.
She nodded but didn't say anything. She lowered her gaze and I could tell that she was
blaming herself. How she manages to work everything out to be her fault I'll never know.
&quot;It's not your fault, Buffy. You can't blame yourself for me going through
adolescence.&quot; I told her placing my hand over hers, which was still on my knee. I
felt her body tense, I knew it wasn't because I put my hand over hers though I kept it
there.</p>

<p>&quot;It is my fault that you're going through it with vampires
trying to kill you on a weekly basis. It is my fault that you've been hospitalized more in
the past two years then in your entire life before that. It's my fault that--&quot; I
stopped her there not being able to stand her berating herself like that.</p>

<p>&quot;None of those things are your fault Buffy. If you weren't here
I would probably be dead now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No you wouldn't, because I wouldn't have been here to place
you in danger.&quot; She countered.</p>

<p>&quot;You wouldn't have been here to save me either. I live on a
hell mouth. I'm always in danger. You protect me, and give me a chance to make a
difference, and if I get hurt it's my fault. I make my own decisions. You've taught me
about courage, and character, and friendship and lo&#133; you've taught me and given me so
much Buffy and I am thankful everyday that you came to Sunnydale. Please stop blaming
yourself for everything. It's too much weight to carry on your shoulders. You've already
got the fate of the world on them, you don't need Willows pre-mid-mid life crisis' up
there too.&quot; I told her. I said more than I had planned on and nearly gave it all away
but I was glad I said it.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#133;&quot; She started to say something but then just shook
her head and smiled. &quot;I was suppose to be giving you the pep talk,&quot; she said
after a moment. I shrugged, I felt better after letting that stuff out. &quot;You're a
good friend Will, the best. I don't know what I'd do without you,&quot; she said then
stood up. &quot;Giles will be here soon I'd better get things set up,&quot; she said then
walked over to the cage and started dragging out equipment. I however just sat there
feeling my knee tingle where her hand had been and thought that despite everything that
was going on I was pretty damn lucky.</p>

<p>I stayed and watched them spar, clapping when Buffy made a
particularly good move and laughing when Giles was dumped on his butt. Mostly I just
watched Buffy though, no internal debate, no worries, just love. I had fallen hard and I
knew it, boy did I know it.</p>

<p>Things settled down over the rest of the week. I rejoined the group,
babbling as usual, we were all without significant others and Cordelia hated us again. I
didn't so much like the fact that Cordelia hated us again though. Firstly I had started to
like her a little bit. I mean she could be nice--sometimes--and she helped me accessorize.
But now that the bitch was back, I was fair game again and, unlike Buffy, and to a certain
degree even Xander, I didn't have any stinging remarks to hurl back at her.</p>

<p>Currently we, that being myself, Buffy and Xander were at the
library. We were always at the library.</p>

<p>&quot;You patrolling tonight Buffster?&quot; Xander inquired in his
uniquely charming way.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Xand-man,&quot; Buffy replied, rolling her eyes. It was
Friday, Buffy patrolled every Friday and Xander knew it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well if you get done early Will and I are going to be watching
some of the classics, and the more the merrier,&quot; Xander told her picking up his
backpack. &quot;Spartacus, Buff, you can't miss Spartacus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll keep that in mind, Roger,&quot; Buffy said with a smirk.</p>

<p>&quot;Try and stop by if you can. We'll be at my crib,&quot; I said.
Things had been a little weird with Xander since the incident and Buffy acted as well,
sort of a buffer to the weirdness. I wasn't worried about something happening with Xander,
that was way over, but weird was weird.</p>

<p>&quot;Will, I hate to break this to you but you're a white Jewish
girl, you don't have a 'crib',&quot; Buffy responded. My attempts at cool were usually the
exact opposite. &quot;We'll see if the ghouls co-operate. If I can I'll be,&quot; she
continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Ready?&quot; Xander asked. He was talking to me. We were going
to try to do some math homework before the vid-fest and it was getting late. I nodded.
&quot;Later.&quot; He called to Buffy as we headed out of the library.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I yawned and snuggled further into my blanket. Xander had left a few
minutes ago and I had returned to the couch. Jerry Springer was on but I wasn't really
watching it. I supposed I should get up and go to bed but I really didn't feel like
moving. Finally, I clicked off the tube and stepped over the empty the popcorn bowl with
every intention of going to my room and to sleep. Things didn't work out that way however.
As I exited the family room I heard a knocking at my door. I figured it was Xander coming
back because he forgot something so I wasn't to worried. Still, years of parental nagging
forced me to look through the peephole first. It was Buffy. Smiling I yanked open the
door. When I did I was shocked by what I saw. Buffy was covered in blood and slightly
hunched over. She looked pale and literally stumbled into the house. I shut the door
behind her and looked her over, a gasp escaping my lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Things didn't go so well,&quot; Buffy said. She tried to smile
but failed.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; I said in a whisper. I reached for her, I
couldn't believe it. &quot;We've got to get you to the hospital,&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said forcefully. Her voice almost sounded
normal.</p>

<p>&quot;But Buffy you're bleeding. You need to see a doctor,&quot; I
said. My hand was now covered in her blood too.</p>

<p>&quot;No. It's not so bad Will. Really. It'll be alright, we can
clean it up. If I go to doctors, they'll want to run tests and draw blood and stuff. Not
to mention wonder why I'm completely healed in less than 48 hours. I don't need that. Do
you understand?&quot; she asked. I nodded as I carefully led her into the kitchen. I
understood the need for secrecy, it was just hard seeing her in pain.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you need me to do?&quot; I asked once I had her seated
in a chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Get a bowl of warm water, a needle, some thread, aspirin, and
a couple of towels. Make sure they're not white.&quot; She instructed. Her breathing was
labored and I could tell that talking to me was taking a lot out of her.</p>

<p>I rushed to get all of the items she requested. When I returned she
had taken off her jacket. There was a rip in her shirt, that looked like it was caused by
a knife or possibly a sword. She tore the area of the shirt around the wound until it
became visible. I gasped again when I saw it, and again she smiled weakly. It was a large
gash, twenty, maybe even twenty-five centimeters long.</p>

<p>&quot;Aspirin?&quot; She requested. I handed it over. After she
popped a few in her mouth she carefully washed the area around the wound with the hot
water and one of the towels. When she finished she had me thread the needle. I knew what
she planned on doing and it made my hands shake. When I finally got it thread she took it
from me and again told me not to worry. I felt bad, I was supposed to be helping her.</p>

<p>I watched as she carefully stitched up the wound. Every time the
needle punctured her skin she winced slightly but it didn't stop her from making the small
careful stitches necessary to ensure that there would be no scaring. When she was done she
dropped the needle and rested her head on the back of the chair. She looked exhausted. I
carefully cleaned the area she had just stitched making certain not to hurt her anymore. I
worked in a state of quiet awe. I had seen her save the world, and battle demons, but it
was the not so simple task of treating her wound which showed me just how strong she was.
How many people pass out from pain when on real drugs and having it performed by a
professional? No doubt some of it was being the Slayer, but a big part of it was Buffy,
and just Buffy. As I worked, I wished I could do more, that I could stop the pain, but all
I could do was make her comfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; she asked softly as I started to clean up.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered immediately returning to her side.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I stay here to tonight? Mom's out of town on a gallery
thing and I don't&#133;&quot; I didn't give her a chance to finish.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. Yes,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;Your parents?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;At a funeral out of town. Don't worry, Buffy, I'll take care
of you, I promise,&quot; I told her with absolute conviction. She smiled. &quot;Come
on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked as I maneuvered her into
an upright position.</p>

<p>&quot;To bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Getting up the stairs was quite a challenge. I considered trying to
make a make shift bed out of the couch, but Buffy insisted that we trek on. When we got to
my room, she sat on my bed while I searched through my drawers for something for her to
wear. I could feel her eyes on my and I wondered what she was thinking. Finally I found a
T-shirt and shorts that she could wear and handed them over to her before turning around
so she could change. After a few moments she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Will, a little help here?&quot; she asked. Turning to face her
I realized that with the injury getting dressed and undressed would be difficult, not to
mention painful, and might actually cause her to re-open the wound, which neither of us
wanted. Slowly I walked towards her taking the shirt out of her hands. &quot;Go ahead it's
okay,&quot; she said when she saw me hesitate. Taking a deep breath I reached for her
shirt and started to pull it up. I stopped quickly and moved away however when she placed
her hand on my shoulder stopping me. &quot;Will, get back here.&quot; She ordered softly.
&quot;I'm not that scary am I?&quot; she asked. I shook my head to indicate a negative.
She was the exact opposite of scary. She was a goddess.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you wanted me to stop,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's okay. I was just going to say that it would be easier
if cut or ripped off the shirt.&quot; She explained. &quot;It really doesn't matter since
the thing is seriously deceased,&quot; she said gesturing to the tattered shirt she was
wearing. I nodded my head and went over to my desk to get a pair of scissors. I didn't
feel right about actually ripping her clothes off of her, especially since I had had a
dream about that the night before. Once I had the scissors I made another trip to my
drawer and pulled out a button up shirt that would be easier to put on her.</p>

<p>Once I was standing in front of her again I started cutting away the
material. As I was pushing the shirt off of her shoulders she started to laugh quietly. I
looked at her quizzically.</p>

<p>&quot;Could you imagine Xander's face if he walked in and saw
this?&quot; she explained. Despite my discomfort and rising body temperature, I had to
admit it made for a pretty amusing image and started laughing too. We would probably have
had to surgically re-attach his jaw.</p>

<p>I carefully put the other shirt on her after the remains of her
blood encrusted one had fallen to the floor. As I buttoned it up I had to concentrate on
stopping my hands from visibly shaking. She sighed as the cool clean material replaced her
old blood laden shirt and my hand, which had been reaching for her waistband, stopped as I
attempted to gain control of hormones which were racing out of control. Once I figured I
had control again I reached down and unbuttoned her pants, then pulled the zipper down.
Kneeling down I took hold and yanked them down around her ankles so she could step out of
them. Grabbing the shorts I placed them on the floor so she could step into them then
pulled them up. My head was level with her abdomen and I had to force myself into an
upright position.</p>

<p>&quot;All done,&quot; I said completely unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No problem,&quot; I responded walking towards the bed to pull
the covers down for her. &quot;After all if you can't trust your best friend to disrobe
you who can you trust?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I don't have to worry about that,&quot; she said with
a grin as she slipped into the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess not.&quot; I agreed moving towards the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; she asked sitting up.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be in my parents room,&quot; I told her. She was silent
for a moment before speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Stay here?&quot; she requested. &quot;Please. It's been one
hell of a long night and I don't want to be alone,&quot; she continued. I looked at her
for a moment before nodding. Buffy didn't often admit weakness or ask for anything. I
couldn't refuse her this very reasonable request.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; I said slipping in on the other side of the
bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said once I was settled.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a problem,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;You're the best, Will,&quot; she said through a yawn.</p>

<p>&quot;No you are,&quot; I whispered once her breathing was steady in
sleep. It was hard but finally after tossing and turning for what seemed like forever I
feel asleep.</p>

<p>I awoke to a warm feeling on my right side. It felt good, new but
good. Opening my eyes I looked down to see Buffy curled up at my side. She was half lying
on top of me with her head on my shoulder. Her face was relaxed, and the morning sun
bathed her in a warm glow. She looked absolutely beautiful. I think I actually stopped
breathing for a minute. I knew that I should get up but I couldn't see a way to do so
without waking Buffy, so I lay there staring at the ceiling thinking about how completely
wonderful, and right it felt to be lying there with her.</p>

<p>I was startled out of my reverie when Buffy mumbled something and
snuggled closer to me. My heart seized again but this time in pain. I wondered who she was
thinking about. Angel? Scott? Some other mystery man who wasn't me? My mood changed after
that. I actually brooded.</p>

<p>A little while later Buffy shifted again allowing me room to slip
out of the bed. She groaned at the loss of contact but then snuggled into the pillow not
seeming to miss me at all. I crept out of the room quietly and headed down stairs to make
breakfast. Buffy would probably be hungry when she woke up, and seeing as how this was the
last time I would probably wake up with her in my arms I decided to make it special.</p>

<p>Half and hour later I heard footsteps on the stairs. Bringing the
food out to the table, I waited for Buffy. It all seemed so domestic it broke my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; she called out.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'm in the kitchen,&quot; I told her. She showed up in
the doorway a few seconds later, shirt askew and hair tousled. She looked absolutely
adorable.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I dreamed it all,&quot; she said heading towards the
table. &quot;Did you make this? It looks good. I can't cook at all. If mom even sees me in
the kitchen she freaks,&quot; she continued sitting down.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I just finished,&quot; I said joining her. &quot;Dreamed
what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything. I thought the injury was a dream until I tried to
stretch and the stitches made their presence known,&quot; she said making a face.
&quot;And I thought I dreamed you until I realized I wasn't in my bed,&quot; she
continued, snagging a few pancakes.</p>

<p>We ate in relative silence. I was depressed, and Buffy was packing
it away like a banshee. You would've thought that she hadn't eaten in weeks. I guess there
were some advantages to being a Slayer, one being that you could suck down as much food as
you wanted and still be buff. I watched her eat, watched her lips wishing I could kiss
them, getting more and more depressed with each lustful thought. We ended up watching the
movies from the night before after breakfast and I was even quieter than while we were
eating, which was quite a feat. I had already seen them so mostly I watched Buffy. She was
better than some movie anyway. Why watch a film about a hero when you have a real life one
sitting in your family room.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; she asked me once the movies
finished.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; I asked her. I was avoiding her question
but I also wanted to know. She seemed to be moving better since waking up.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be as good as new by tomorrow. I don't think you can say
the same thing though.&quot; She looked directly into my eyes now. &quot;What's up Willow?
You've been quiet for weeks now, very un-Will like. You snap out of it for a few days then
go back. It's like being around wicca Jeckle and wicca Hyde.&quot; She paused then,
seemingly thinking. &quot;It seems to get worse when I'm around. Did I do something?&quot;
she asked genuinely concerned. I hated myself for doing that to her.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I responded emphatically. &quot;You haven't done
anything except be the best friend anyone could ask for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what? And I'm not buying the Xander/Oz thing
anymore.&quot; I didn't respond right away because I didn't know what to tell her. I
didn't want to lie, keeping it inside was tearing me apart, but I was still afraid to tell
her. &quot;Please, Will. Don't you know you can tell me anything. I love you, I'll always
be here.&quot; I looked down at her when she said 'I love you'. I know she meant it as a
friend but maybe it was enough. I decided that I would tell her. Even if she didn't feel
the same way I was certain she would still be my friend.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you too, Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good, I'm glad we're agreed,&quot; she said with a smile.
&quot;Now, what's bothering you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's it,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;It bothers you that you love me?&quot; she asked
semi-confused.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you don't understand. I don't just love you, I'm in love
with you,&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am in love with you,&quot; I said looking her in the eye,
enunciating every word. She started at me for a moment, I could see her processing the
information.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; she asked softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. I watched as a myriad of emotions played
over her face. Then she stood up suddenly and looked out the window. Startled I sat up.
&quot;Please don't leave,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I added, hanging my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be sorry, Will,&quot; she said softly as she turned to
face me. &quot;It's a beautiful thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is?&quot; I asked her, wanting to believe what I was
hearing so much.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes it is,&quot; she said. She moved her hand to cup my cheek,
and continued to look at me. Study me. &quot;When Angel&#133;turned, do you know why he
went after you?&quot; she asked after a minute, her eyes boring into mine.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; I answered confused by the change in subject.</p>

<p>&quot;It was because he knew that you were the one. That you meant
more to me than any other. When he told that, I thought he was nuts, I mean he was nuts,
but he was right.&quot; Her thumb was stroking my cheek and I leaned into the touch.
&quot;I thought about it afterwards and realized he was right. You are the one I turn to,
the one who comforts me, the one I feel safe with, the one who makes me laugh. You are the
one. The one I love more than any other,&quot; she finished, then she slowly leaned
forward and our lips met in a soft kiss. When I didn't pull away she moved her lips over
my bottom one and sucked gently, stroking across the smooth softness with her tongue. I
exhaled against her lips then pressed my lips to hers as she slid her hand across my back
and I moved mine up to hold her close as she parted my lips with soft strokes. Passion
rose between us, both of us drawing in breath deeply as it seared us-within seconds we
were kissing deeply, hungrily, mouths open and tongues tangling. I pressed into Buffy's
taut, strong body, eyes closed, trying to absorb every sensation that washed through me.
Buffy's mouth was insistent, demanding, soft moans melting into me as her hands held me
closely to her, pressing us together even more firmly. From my knees upward I was pressed
tight against Buffy's body, were devouring each other now, kissing so very deeply, taking
and giving, holding tight and letting go. Our breathing quickened, synchronizing as we
sought to consume one another utterly, no thought remaining except this sweet, breathless,
fluttering excitement sweeping us up and pulling us together. Buffy releasing sweet sounds
from deep in her throat, her tongue sliding over my lips softly exploring, withdrawing,
stroking, feasting&#133; until at last those lovely strong hand slid to my shoulder and we
drew away slowly, only for Buffy's mouth to seek out mine again and again, in short hungry
kisses as if she couldn't bear to let it end.</p>

<p>For several euphoric seconds, I stood motionless, eyes closed as I
savored the sweetness of it, the passion. It was so good, so incredibly passionate, just
like I thought it would be, and completely new and wonderful at the same time. Finally we
pulled away each struggling for breath but still holding each other close not wanting to
break the connection between us. Buffy's face was flushed and I knew that mine was as
well. I had never before in life experienced anything as wonderful and fulfilling as the
kisses we just shared.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; Buffy said softly after a moment. She sounded
surprised. &quot;I've never done that with you before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said in response. I'm usually more articulate
than that but the blood wasn't exactly rushing to my head at that point. Buffy looked at
our joined hands and smiled. I mirrored the action unconsciously.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#133; ah, should probably talk about this huh?&quot; she
asked after a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Talk is good,&quot; I agreed, though all I could really think
about was repeating our former aerobics.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, talk then,&quot; Buffy said gently pushing me down onto
the couch.</p>

<p>A knock at the door startled us and I jumped, literally, off of the
couch. We had had every intention of talking, I had put on my serious talking face and we
had even gotten out a few sentences, but her lips looked so inviting that I couldn't
resist planting a tiny kiss on them, and she of course had to retaliate, and I back and so
forth, and before we knew it we were engaging in full body groping. Her hand had just
started to creep under my shirt when I heard the knock and jumped up.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to answer it?&quot; Buffy asked. She was sitting
up now and looking at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Answer it?&quot; I asked distractedly. Then I remembered the
knock, &quot;Yeah!&quot; I said trying to engage my brain.</p>

<p>It was Xander, he had coffee and donuts and as soon as I opened the
door the bust in.</p>

<p>&quot;Sleep in much Will?&quot; he asked. I was still in my pajamas
and it had to be around one in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;No&#133;I&#133;it's&#133;&quot; I started to say but he had
already moved past me and was heading into the family room.</p>

<p>&quot;How come no one invited me to the sleep over?&quot; Xander
asked once I was in the room.</p>

<p>&quot;It was more like an episode of ER,&quot; Buffy said running a
hand through her disheveled hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy was hurt patrolling last night,&quot; I supplied in way
of explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Xander asked, concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy said with a dismissive wave. &quot;I wasn't
in such hot shape when I showed up but Willow's been taking really good care of me,&quot;
she continued with a smile. The double entendre was lost on Xander but it made me blush
which caused Buffy's smile to grow.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you you should have watched Spartacus,&quot; Xander
said taking a seat in the recliner beside the couch. He looked like he was settling in.
There was to be no settling.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep, she should've listened but didn't and blood ensued. What
can you do? I know get dressed. Yep, we've really got to get dressed, the taking off and
putting on of clothes, and the nudity you can't forget the nudity. You better go, we'll
call,&quot; I said trying to usher him off of the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;No problem I'll wait for you gals down here,&quot; he said
reaching for a donut. &quot;Don't take too long though, I might start to get ideas
involving the nudity.&quot; He continued as we walked out of the room. When he said that I
turned to Buffy and smiled, she laughed and we headed up the stairs quickly.</p>

<p>Buffy sat on the bed as I looked through my drawers for something
for her to wear. The irony of it all didn't escape me. Finally I decided on a pair of
hospital pants and a tank top for her. We dressed in silence, Buffy had more range of
movement today which was a good thing considering recent revelations. Playing strip tease
after our morning activities probably wouldn't have been such a great idea. As I finished
with my earrings I looked over to where Buffy was. She was sitting in front of the mirror
trying to brush her hair only she looked like she was having a spot of trouble. I walked
over to her and took the brush out of her hands taking over the job myself. When I was
finished I reached over her shoulder to place the brush down and she kissed my neck
briefly before taking my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. She had said that phrase quite a
bit in the past few days.</p>

<p>&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; I told her truthfully. There was
something wonderfully erotic about brushing her hair, running my fingers through it's
length. She watched me for a moment trying to decide on something then smiled and pulled
me down onto her lap.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; I protested. &quot;You're going to hurt yourself.
More,&quot; I added as she continued to hold my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;No I'm not,&quot; she said. &quot;There are some advantages to
being a Slayer.&quot; She was still smiling. She seemed to be bemused by my protests.
&quot;I want to&#133;&quot; she started to say after a moment then paused. She seemed to
be struggling with something so I didn't say anything. &quot;I want to make love to you so
much Will,&quot; she continued, her voice lowering. She was looking directly into my eyes
and I could see the desire shimmering there. It caused my breath to quicken, and it took
entirely to much concentration for me to get my next sentence out.</p>

<p>&quot;I want that too Buffy. So much,&quot; I told her. She looked
up at me then raised her hand to the back of my neck bringing our lips together. &quot;We
have to stop,&quot; I told her when I finally managed to break my lips away.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said regretfully. She looked towards the
door with disdain. When she turned back to face me I saw a pout on her lips. It was
absolutely too cute for words. &quot;We better go. Xander and ideas, especially those
involving nudity is not a good combination.&quot; I got off of her lap and straightened my
clothing. Once standing up as well Buffy followed suit. As we headed out the door she
turned to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I promise we'll talk about this. All of it once he's
gone,&quot; she said sincerely. &quot;For real next time.&quot; She added with a smile. I
nodded, for despite our enthusiasm we really did need to talk. I was almost glad for
Xander's interruption, I wanted things to be clear between us about what we were feeling
before we took it to the next step. There were things I needed to ask her. If Xander
hadn't showed up there would have been little clearing and lots of stepping. Mostly I
needed to be sure that she was feeling what I was feeling, because I didn't think I could
handle it if what was happening ended up being some rebound thing.</p>

<p>So side by side we headed down the stairs preparing to face the
world.</p>

<p>We headed to the library after Buffy and I rejoined Xander. Giles
always liked to get after-patrol reports and this time Buffy actually had something to
report. With everything that had happened over the past 24 hours or so I had neglected to
glean any real information about the attack from Buffy, so I was actually looking forward
to the meeting because I would get to hear all of the good stuff. Sometimes Buffy would
try to soften things up for me when recounting tales, avoid all the blood and guts and
what have you. I would tell her not to I know she still did it. She wouldn't do that with
Giles though so I knew I would hear the real thing.</p>

<p>The walk to the library was quiet. Buffy and I were each lost in our
thoughts and, presumably, Xander was wondering what was up with all the quiet. When we
arrived Giles was re-stocking the cage-o-weapons. I'm still not sure how he got away with
installing that thing. As we took our usual seats around the table he approached.</p>

<p>&quot;Good of you to make it,&quot; he said in greeting. It was his
repressed British way of saying 'what the hell took you so long'. After we all gave him
suitably chastised looks he continued, &quot;How did it go last night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was trouble and it found me,&quot; Buffy said with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;She was sliced and nearly diced,&quot; Xander chipped in. We
all gave him the look of shame and he was quite again.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was patrolling around the playground this vamp jumped
out from behind the teeter-totter. He had long hair and funky tattoo on his face, and the
clothes he was wearing, my God! He looked like the Miami sound machine exploded all
over&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Giles interrupted, trying to get her back on
topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry. So he jumped out from behind the totter and I was like
'GREAT!' So he comes at me like I'm meals on wheels or something and we tangle. Kick,
punch, block, jab, twirl, yada, yada, yada. So after a while of that he pulls out this
bigass knife, and I'm like 'fan-freaking-tastic'. So he starts slashing away and I'm
jumping around trying not to be ginsued. So this one time I didn't turn quick enough and
he cuts me on the side. So I was really pissed off by then and I was like 'That's so it'
and I kicked the knife out of his hand and staked him.&quot; She continued making a little
stabbing motion when she got to the staking part. &quot;I was kind of bleeding by then so
I headed over to Willow's because it was close by, and we stitched me all up. No
biggie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Giles said. His brow was creased so you could
tell that he was thinking. &quot;What exactly did this tattoo look like?&quot; he asked
Buffy after a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;It's kind of hard to describe. It was over his right eye, and
was like a bunch of lines joining together,&quot; Buffy replied.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't be certain but that sounds familiar,&quot; Giles said
still wearing his thinking face.</p>

<p>&quot;To the book trolley?&quot; Xander guessed. Giles simply
nodded, and Buffy and I laughed.</p>

<p>We had been at it for a few hours and still nothing. We decided that
an extra pair of hands couldn't hurt and Xander was sent out to get Faith seeing as he was
the least research inclined out of all of us. Giles was in his office and Buffy was on the
upper level. I had just finished with my book so I headed up to where Buffy was.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you looking at,&quot; I asked, joining her.</p>

<p>&quot;Big, ugly, useless red book that won't fit on the shelf,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah volume twelve,&quot; I responded. I had had the pleasure of
dealing with that one before.</p>

<p>&quot;Find anything?&quot; she asked turning to face me.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides dust-balls?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Besides dust-balls,&quot; she confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. You?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nada,&quot; she responded closing the book up. After trying to
put it on the shelf and watching it fall a couple times she shrugged and left it where it
was on the floor. &quot;How many books have you sped through so far?&quot; She asked
stepping over it.</p>

<p>&quot;Three,&quot; I responded waiting for the shocked response I
knew I was sure to get. Usually I would have gone through twice as many in the same amount
of time. She took a step so that she was standing directly in front of me and looked at
me, scrutinizing me from head to toe.</p>

<p>&quot;You look like Willow, and sound like Willow but&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been having some trouble concentrating,&quot; I said
cutting her off. She laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I didn't have anything to do with that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually&#133;&quot; I started to say but I never got a chance
to finish. She pushed her lips against mine, and as seemed to be the norm our breathing
soon quickened as our tongues moved with each other hungrily. She moaned into my mouth and
I moved my hand up to the back of her neck bringing us closer to together.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; she said when we finally broke apart. &quot;I've
never&#133;it's not usually&#133;it doesn't&#133;&quot; She stopped speaking and just
looked up at me.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said smiling. &quot;Me either.&quot; I know
what she was trying to say because I felt the same. Never had I responded to a kiss the
way I responded to hers. So passionately, repeatedly. I was glad I wasn't the only one
feeling it, that she was as overwhelmed by it as I was.</p>

<p>&quot;It's&#133;&quot; She started to say but was interrupted by the
library doors opening. Quickly grabbing a book we moved out from behind the shelf. It was
Xander and Faith. Moving down to the lower level we dropped our books on the table and
waited for them to join us.</p>

<p>&quot;Heard you got gashed B, you okay?&quot; Faith asked looking
Buffy over. She was obviously trying to find the wound.</p>

<p>&quot;Better than he is,&quot; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I see it?&quot; Faith asked. She sounded excited which
bugged me. Buffy could have been seriously hurt.</p>

<p>&quot;Morbid much?&quot; Buffy asked her.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on B,&quot; Faith implored. &quot;I'll show you mine if
you show me yours,&quot; she added with a grin.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep it,&quot; Buffy responded as she lifted up her tank top
enough for Faith to see it.</p>

<p>&quot;How many?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifteen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not bad,&quot; Faith said clearly impressed.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you two going to arm wrestle next or can we get on with
it?&quot; I asked suddenly. Three pairs of startled eyes regarded me.</p>

<p>&quot;On with it,&quot; Buffy responded for all of them. Xander and
Faith then moved away to find books but Buffy stayed by me. Once they were out of earshot
she turned to me and raised her eyebrow in question.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said. She continued looking at me though,
obviously wanting a better answer. &quot;I guess I'm feeling sort of territorial,&quot; I
offered. She continued to stare at me for second before smiling and shaking her head.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess you are,&quot; she agreed. &quot;You don't have to
worry about Faith invading this territory though,&quot; she continued teasingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I need to worry about anyone else?&quot; I asked regretting
it the moment it came out of my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;No. No you don't,&quot; Buffy said regarding me seriously.
&quot;I promise we'll talk about this soon, work it all out. But I want you to know I
meant what I said this morning.&quot; I nodded not really knowing what to say.</p>

<p>&quot;We should get back to the research thing,&quot; I said
gesturing vaguely towards the table. She nodded and moved over to seat where she had
dropped her book. I sat down beside her and a few minutes later we were joined by Xander
and Faith.</p>

<p>Surprising us all, it was Faith who put a halt to research fest '99
with a call of eureka. After having Buffy confirm that the guy in the book had the same
markings as the vamp she slayed we called Giles in. He took the book from Faith and looked
at it for a few seconds before taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. A gesture
which never meant anything good.</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid of this,&quot; he said shortly there after.
Sometimes I hated being right.</p>

<p>&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Approximately six hundred years ago there was a caste of
vampire who called themselves 'The Children of the Dark'. They were extremely powerful and
lethal. Their secret power lay in being able to force their opponents to re-live past
experiences. If at sometime in the past you happened to break your leg they could make you
re-live that pain in conjunction with others. They could kill without ever laying a hand
on someone, human and demon alike.&quot; Giles related pausing momentarily.</p>

<p>&quot;Fun,&quot; I interjected during the silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally a Slayer by the name of Paladar was able was able to
defeat the cast by challenging their leader on a spiritual plane. Paladar defeated the
master and the caste lost its power and were banished to an alternate dimension where they
were suppose to remain until the end of time,&quot; Giles continued, ignoring me.</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently being banished until the end of time doesn't mean
what it used to,&quot; Xander commented.</p>

<p>&quot;How'd they escape?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what do they want?&quot; It was Faith who asked this.</p>

<p>&quot;Their powers back I would imagine,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;And how would they go about doing that?&quot; Buffy inquired.
Giles rubbed his eyes and shifted his position before responding.</p>

<p>&quot;By performing a ritual at one of their sacred grounds and
sacrificing then consuming the blood of a Slayer,&quot; Giles said. We were all silent as
we absorbed what he'd just told us.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know about you B, but I like my blood in my body. I
say we impale these guys and pronto,&quot; Faith declared, standing up and looking a Buffy
expectantly.</p>

<p>&quot;How many are there?&quot; Buffy asked Giles.</p>

<p>&quot;It's impossible to know for sure. I appreciate your
enthusiasm, Faith, but we don't have enough information to go slaying as of now. My advice
would be for you all to go home and get some rest,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe we should pair off. Buffy and Faith shouldn't be alone
if there's a price on their heads,&quot; Xander piped up moving closer to Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a good idea,&quot; Giles said slightly disconcerted
that it had come from Xander. &quot;Buffy and Willow you stay together. Xander you go with
Faith.&quot; Giles instructed.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I get stuck with dumb and dumber?&quot; Faith
complained as we made our way out of the library.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey your not exactly a prize petunia yourself,Elvira,&quot;
Xander shot back. Buffy sent me a look as we followed the bickering duo out and I had to
smile. Even though I wondered at the wisdom of sticking those two together, I had to admit
that I was glad because Buffy and I would finally have some time alone.</p>

<p>Since Buffy's house was closer to the school, we headed there once
we left the library. I left a message on my voice mail telling my parents where I was in
case they called, then I joined Buffy in the family room.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do they call it 'The Pretender'? I mean he's not really
pretending because he actually becomes a doctor or a firefighter or whatever,&quot; Buffy
asked once I entered the room.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess it sounds better than 'The Actualizer',&quot; I said
sitting down beside her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well it's either this guy or the weather network. And the
weather network in Sunnydale never has much to report. Sun, sun, sun, and more sun,&quot;
Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&quot;This guy,&quot; I said settling into the couch. Neither of us
new quite how to start the talk so the talk was delayed. When the show ended however we
turned to look at each other.</p>

<p>&quot;That Miss Parker's a bitch,&quot; Buffy commented.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, she reminds me of Cordelia,&quot; I added. We both
laughed at that before settling into an awkward silence.</p>

<p>&quot;I said we would talk and I meant it I really did, I
just&#133;I don't know where to start,&quot; Buffy admitted with a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said softly. &quot;Angel,&quot; I told her
after a moment. I decided that we could as well start with the big guns.</p>

<p>&quot;Angel,&quot; Buffy repeated, looking down at her hands.
&quot;Okay. It's over between Angel and I, it has been for a long time now. We were really
saying goodbye from the beginning.&quot; She started again, &quot;What we had at first, it
was good. I loved him, but there was always this distance between us, this palpable
distance. We could feel it. Slayer, vampire, Buffy, Angel, whatever the dynamic even when
things were good it just never had the feeling of&#133;rightness. But we wanted it to so
badly, neither of us liked the distance. I think that was one of the main reasons
we&#133;you know,&quot; she said. I did know. &quot;And you know how that turned out. When
he came back and I was hiding him I guess I was hoping that things could go back to the
way they were before, but it soon became apparent that they couldn't. The time he spent as
Angelus had changed me, how I perceived him, and us.&quot; She paused the looked up at me.
&quot;I care about him still, love him, but I'm not in love with him, and I haven't been
for quite some time. I love him like I do Xander, or Giles, that's all. That's all I think
it was meant to be,&quot; she continued, taking my hand in hers and bringing it up to her
heart. &quot;It would be an understatement to say that things have been crazy lately and I
don't know exactly when my feeling for you changed, but believe me when I tell you that I
love you and am as sure of that as I am that my name is Buffy Summers,&quot; she
concluded. After that I couldn't resist placing a soft kiss on her lips. Pulling away
Buffy looked at me. It was my turn. &quot;Oz.&quot; Was all she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oz.&quot; I repeated. He was my one true regret in all of this
because I really did care about him. &quot;I care for him, maybe even love, but I'm not in
love with him. He makes me laugh and I like being around him but he doesn't make my knees
weak or my head swim. Only you do that. He doesn't make me feel whole. Only you do
that,&quot; I told her. There were all sorts of other things floating around in my head,
but what I said basically summed it all up.</p>

<p>We sat staring into one another's eyes for many long moments, both
caught up in an impossible yearning, aware of one another's desire, yet seemingly unable
to do anything about it. My eyes lowered to take in Buffy's slightly parted lips, as well
as the exquisite line of her throat. Finally I raised one hand to her cheek and stroked it
slowly with the backs of my fingers, smiling as Buffy tilted her head to meet my caress. I
cupped Buffy's face acutely aware of the warm breath on my hand as Buffy moved against me
gently. Shifting closer I raised my head feeling her warm breath now on my lips, Buffy's
eyes closing as we migrated towards each other.</p>

<p>Carefully, in the precarious fits and starts characteristic of a
first kiss, our lips brushed, exploring gently, softly, repeatedly. We kissed sweet,
lingering kisses, tasting one another, consuming each other gently, cautiously. Buffy
pulled away briefly to stare into my eyes, her own stare darkened to a deep blue. Her hand
came to my cheek mirroring my hand on hers and we kissed deeply again, more passionately,
Buffy's breath coming in trembling sighs as I tugged gently, her tongue moving delicately
over my lips, tempting me, seducing me with warm breath and soft lips, quiet moans of
desire.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you,&quot; Buffy moaned into my mouth. I kissed her
fully, leaning forward to lay her back onto the cushions of the couch as my arm slid
across her shoulders to hold her tightly. I could taste her need, could hear the beautiful
soft sounds of pleasure that spilled into my mouth as she pulled me closer as our kiss
deepened further.</p>

<p>Buffy moaned and moved to kiss me over the spot just above the
juncture of my neck and shoulder. I groaned softly in response, almost a growl, and then
Buffy was pulling me up, nipping at my bottom lip playfully, smiling. She managed to shift
us so that she could stand, then held out her hand to me. Standing there, in front of the
couch Buffy kissed me deeply again before she pulled away and led me unprotesting up the
stairs and to her bedroom.</p>

<p>We stood at the foot of the bed, the starlight coming through the
window the only source of illumination as Buffy slowly revealed her body to me. I could
only stand mesmerized and stare as she undressed herself, smiling all the while. I watched
intently as she lifted her tank top up over her head, the muscles of her arms unmistakably
defined in the starlight. Then her hands slid up her stomach, and her bra was unclasped
and fell to the floor. She looked into my eyes, her lips curved upward in an utterly
sensuous smile as her hands moved to her waistband, pushing her pants and underpants down
her hips allowing them to fall to the floor, straightening and running her hands through
her hair as she stepped out of them.</p>

<p>Then she was naked, her body the most delicate porcelain I had ever
seen, just as I had imagined; slim and soft, perfect in its lines, unique and graceful and
so very beautiful. For long moments I simply gazed at the long, graceful lines of her
body. She moved toward me then, her hands reaching out and sliding beneath my shirt
pulling it up and over my head. Soon my bra, skirt, and underwear joined the rapidly
growing pile of clothes on the floor. Then I too was naked open to Buffy's heated gaze as
she inspected me slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow&#133;&quot; She whispered softly. Then she moved so
that we were together and we gasped as our skin touched for the first time, pressing into
one another, our lips meeting again and again in increasingly hungry kisses. Buffy's hands
were warm and gentle, her fingertips tracing the line of my jaw and the curve of my
throat, sliding over my body with quiet determination. I buried my face in her neck,
seeking out and finding her pulse point sucking on it gently.</p>

<p>Then it happened. The unimaginable. The catastrophic. The phone
rang, and rang and rang, and rang until finally, regretfully Buffy let go of me moved to
pick it up.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; she demanded irritably. I almost felt sorry for
the person on the other line, what with having to deal with a very horny, very pissed off
vampire Slayer. Almost. &quot;Xander? Is that you?&quot; she asked. Her expression changed
to one of concern. &quot;Slow down I can't understand what you're saying,&quot; she said
into the receiver. &quot;Alright, alright. Stay put we'll be there as soon as we
can,&quot; she said. &quot;No, just stay where you are, we'll get Giles. Okay&#133;it's
not your fault&#133;believe me&#133;okay&#133;be careful,&quot; she said then hung up the
phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Trouble?&quot; I asked already reaching for my clothes, while
cursing the unpredictability of my life, and the just wrongness of this interruption. I'd
already waited two plus years. This was just&#133;mean.</p>

<p>&quot;They've got Faith. Xander's at the motel now,&quot; she told
me, reaching for her clothes as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he okay?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;They whacked him over the head. He'll probably have a killer
headache but he'll live,&quot; Buffy said now fully dressed and moving over to the side of
her bed to pull out the trunk-o-fun. Knowing the drill I grabbed her bag and handed it to
her so she could start to load it up. &quot;Call Giles and tell him what's up while I
finish here?&quot; she asked, shoving a few stakes into the bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said moving over to the phone. I talked to Giles
while Buffy finished packing the bag. &quot;He's going to pick us up. He should be here in
a few,&quot; I said when Buffy moved over towards me. She nodded and together we headed
out the door to wait in the foyer.</p>

<p>&quot;Will&#133;&quot; she started once we were down there. There
was a look of deep regret in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I know.&quot; I told her with a gentle smile though my body
was tingling, crying out for her touch. &quot;Duty calls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said taking my hand in her free one and
squeezing it.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be.&quot; I told her. &quot;Somebody's got to save to
world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't doom and death have waited for an hour?&quot; She
asked, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess they have a schedule to maintain. Besides we've got
plenty of time for&#133;things,&quot; I volunteered. She smiled that sweet smile that
always broke my heart then looked through the peephole.</p>

<p>&quot;The cavalry has arrived. Let's jet,&quot; she said a moment
later. I followed her out the door. Another day, another demon.</p>

<p>Buffy dumped her bag in the front seat of the chair then joined me
in the back. The ride to the motel was silent, all of us lost in thoughts that ran along
similar and different lines. As Giles pulled into the parking lot of the motel we could
see Xander standing in the opening of one of the doors. As we got closer and Giles parked
the car I could clearly see that the door had been knocked out of its hinges. Moving out
of the doorway Xander opened the passenger side door. Sending Buffy's bag into the back
seat he got in. There was a bruise on the side of his face but other than that he seemed
to be okay.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Giles asked once Xander was safely in the
car.</p>

<p>&quot;I think half of my face is still in there, but other than that
hunky-dory,&quot; he responded giving a big thumbs up then wincing. Giles nodded then put
the car in reverse backing up and heading out of the parking lot.</p>

<p>&quot;Do we know where they've taken her?&quot; Buffy asked seeing
that Giles was heading out of instead of back into Sunnydale.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Giles responded. &quot;After I sent you all home I
started a deeper investigation into 'The Children of The Dead'. It took a while to locate
more than rudimentary reference of them in the texts but shortly before you called I was
able to ascertain some more information about the ritual. It was really a very difficult
process of cross-referencing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Giles...&quot; Buffy prompted. He too sometimes had a habit of
droning on. What he seemed to have trouble grasping sometimes was that we didn't so much
care how he found something, just that he found it.</p>

<p>&quot;The ceremony must be performed on the first night of the
crescent moon at one of the clans sacred grounds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That means we've got a day to find them,&quot; I said after
looking out window. Tomorrow night the moon would be crescent.</p>

<p>&quot;So where are these scared grounds and how do we get at
'em?&quot; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Most of them are in east and western Europe. The majority of
the clans population seemed to reside in France during the years of their dominance.&quot;
Giles answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, G-man, the airports that way,&quot; Xander said jerking
his thumb in the opposite direction before Giles could continue.</p>

<p>&quot;The cast was also kind enough to provide us with detailed maps
to of all of their sacrificial grounds in the known world,&quot; Giles continued, ignoring
Xander's comment. &quot;According to the map which I'm afraid to say is severely out of
date they had...properties, shall we say, all around the new world. And if I have
deciphered the maps correctly they should have a site about a day out of Sunnydale in the
Newik forests. I believe this is where they are most likely to take Faith,&quot; Giles
concluded turning onto the highway.</p>

<p>&quot;Yay, road trip,&quot; Xander said clapping his hands together.</p>

<p>&quot;So, who are you going to be, Thelma or Louise?&quot; Buffy
asked with a smirk.</p>

<p>&quot;Which one was Geena Davis?&quot; Xander asked. Giles sighed,
and the rest of us laughed. It was going to be a long night for the Watcher.</p>

<p>We drove for hours on a road that seemed to go to nowhere. Tree,
lamp post, road sign, over and over again in that order, for hours. An hour or so into the
ride the motion of the car and the monotony of the view started to lull me to sleep. At
first I tried to stop it by reciting binary codes in my head but that only made it worse,
then I tried to count the cars we passed until I realized there were none, then I started
flicking Xander in the back of the head but he got mad and I had to stop that too.
Eventually seeing that my eyes were barely staying open Buffy told me to go to sleep and
rested my head on her shoulder. At first I tried to stop her motioning to Xander and
Giles, but she told me not to worry and put my head back where it had been.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes again it was still dark. Giles had pulled the
car over to side of the road and was rubbing his eyes. Looking up I saw that sometime
during my little nap Buffy had fallen asleep too. Up in front, Xander seemed to be waking
up as well. He had probably been jarred out of sleep by the motion of the car stopping
like I was.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhh, isn't that cute?&quot; He noted as he turned around to
look in the back seat. At first I was confused as to what he was talking about then I
realized that Buffy and I were kind of curled up together all cozy. I simply stuck my
tongue out at him, after all it was kind of cute.</p>

<p>&quot;Giles I don't think you should drive anymore tonight.&quot; I
said turning away from Xander and looking at the Watcher. He looked tired.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you're probably right but we can't stay parked on the
side of the road.&quot; The Watcher responded placing his glasses back on.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll drive, just tell me what direction and where to
stop.&quot; Xander volunteered. Giles nodded and took out a map of the area from his glove
compartment. After trying to open it in the car with less than stellar results the two men
got out of the car and placed the map on the hood. After a few minutes of discussion which
I couldn't hear they swapped sides, and Xander started the car up.</p>

<p>The next time we stopped was a seedy road side motel-not unlike the
one Faith was kidnapped from. It was just past sunrise and Giles said that we could all
use a few good hours sleep before continuing, and not to worry because we would still be
ahead of the vampires anyway because they couldn't drive during the daytime. I wasn't so
sure about that since Spike seemed to be able to drive around day or night, but Xander
said that before he passed out he had seen their car and the windows weren't blacked out
like on Spike's party-mobile.</p>

<p>We weren't exactly planning on a road trip when we left Sunnydale,
so Giles ended up paying for the rooms we used. It was okay though because as long as he
got a receipt the Watcher's council would pay for it. I asked Giles if he wanted any help
with the map that would lead us to the sacrificial grounds, but he told me that we could
work on it after we rested, so we unloaded the k-car and brought the equipment into our
respective rooms. Buffy and I were assigned to room 11 while the boys took room 12.</p>

<p>In a perfect world Buffy and I would have picked up where we left
off when we were interrupted earlier, but if there was one thing living on a hell mouth
taught you, it was that the world was far from perfect. In reality we were both tired and
stiff from the long hours spent in the car, and were kind of freaked out by the idea that
Xander and Giles were next door. I was pretty sure we could keep it quiet enough that they
wouldn't hear anything, but knowing they were mere inches away, separated from us only by
crappy insulation and dry wall didn't sit too well with me.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; Buffy asked looking over at me. We had walked in
the door, dumped the equipment on the floor and collapsed onto the beds. The only movement
either of us had made was to take off our outer clothing so we were left only in our
underwear. Seeing as how we would be wearing those clothes for at least two more days, it
didn't seem wise to sleep in them. So I lay on the first bed by the door and Buffy, who
made it a little farther into the room, took the one by the washroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow's not here right now, please leave a message at the
sound of the beep,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Buffy... and I'm lonely. When you get this... come over
'cause I need you near me,&quot; Buffy said as if she were speaking to an answering
machine. Quickly I got up and walked over to her bed and lay down beside her. &quot;That
was fast,&quot; she said with a smile. I just smiled, I could be fast when properly
motivated. &quot;Come on, get under the covers, let's go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about...&quot; I said looking at the wall to Xander and
Giles' room.</p>

<p>&quot;We really are going to sleep. That wasn't an analogy for
anything,&quot; she responded amused. I slapped her on the thigh and gave her a look.
&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That wasn't what I meant,&quot; I told her.</p>

<p>&quot;I know. Don't worry, they won't come in. I have the key and
Giles at least is a gentlemen, which means he'll keep Xander out as well.&quot; I smiled
at her and climbed under the covers. Like in all motels, the air conditioner was going
full blast so we would actually be able to make some use of the blanket. Climbing in
behind me Buffy wrapped her arms around my waist and snuggled in. &quot;I like this.&quot;
She commented.</p>

<p>&quot;What? Spooning?&quot; I asked with a smile she couldn't see.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Spooning,&quot; she acknowledged peevishly, but I could
feel her smiling against my back. &quot;But only with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As it should be.&quot; I told her with a nod.</p>

<p>&quot;I never knew you were so territorial,&quot; she commented
pulling me even closer which was no easy feat.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never had anything worth being territorial over
before,&quot; I told her seriously. She was quite for a moment and I had said my piece so
we just lay holding each other.</p>

<p>&quot;I think that's just about the nicest thing anyone's ever said
to me,&quot; she said finally as she kissed the back of my neck. Slowly I turned around so
that we were face to face.</p>

<p>&quot;If that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to you, you must
have been hanging around some real morons,&quot; I said as I looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the second nicest thing,&quot; she said meeting my
gaze. Then she leaned forward and kissed me. It wasn't a kiss designed to arouse passion,
but one meant to convey the love she felt for me and I intercepted it and returned with
equal strength. &quot;Sleep. We're suppose to sleep,&quot; she said as if she was trying
to remind herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Sleep.&quot; I repeated turning back around. Once I was
settled she pressed up against me and I could feel her breasts pressing into my back
causing sleep to sound not so important just then, but exhaustion overcame hormones and
soon I was peacefully asleep secure in the knowledge that my Slayer would protect me.</p>

<p>When I awoke I was wrapped in a delicious warmth, surrounded. I
could feel Buffy drawing shapes on my arm and I turned around so that I could see her. She
smiled when she saw that I was awake and I smiled back. She looked pensive though, worried
and I wondered how much sleep she had gotten, if she got any. I had seen this look before,
too many times. Nobody as young as we were should have been able to produce a look like
that.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot; I asked her gently. It was a tossup
whether she would tell me or not. Sometimes she just kept it all inside bottled up because
she didn't want to worry anyone with her problems. What she didn't realize was that her
problems were our problems, and that whether she told us or not we were affected.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. I was just thinking,&quot; she responded
distractedly. &quot;We should get dressed and go next door.&quot; I nodded, deciding to
drop the subject for now.</p>

<p>We were back on the road by two p.m. Buffy and I had joined Giles
and Xander shortly after we awoke and, together, the four of us had gone over the maps
Giles brought with him. We determined that the site was around five hours away and located
near the Newik verge. According to the map, if we followed the Currier stream, it should
lead us straight to the site. Once there, Giles and I would recite a incantation from the
book of Tiraynes. That would, in theory at least, re-open the gateway to the alternate
dimension from which the vampires had escaped and send them back for good this time. While
Giles and I were doing our thing, Buffy would do her thing holding off the vamps, and
Xander would find and free Faith. On paper it was a good, relatively simplistic sounding
plan which meant that at one time during it all one of us was likely to have near death
experience. That's how it worked on the hellmouth, the easier it seemed the more likely we
were to end up dead.</p>

<p>So with all the details settled we loaded up the k-car once again
and headed out. The ride was spent mostly listening to depressing country songs. It seemed
to be the only thing they played out in the middle of nowhere, country and Celine Dion.
They played an inordinate amount of Celine Dion, as well as lots of Patsy Cline which
oddly Xander seemed to know all the lyrics.</p>

<p>It was just past 7:00 p.m. when we pulled into the rest station.
Giles drove the car into the brush a ways then we disembarked. The Currier stream was
about fifty meters in front us so once we had all of our gear we headed in its direction.
It was excessively dark out and the only light we had was being provided by the moon and a
small pocket flash light. We Rosenbergs weren't exactly the outdoorsy type, so I'd never
been camping before. I imagined it would be somewhat like this, only without the stakes,
and Latin chants, and vampires-and I was glad I hadn't been because the silence was
creepy. Really creepy, and this is coming from a woman who sees unholy monsters on a
weekly, sometimes daily basis.</p>

<p>We proceeded carefully, trying to make the least amount of noise
possible so as not to alert them to our presence. Assuming of course that they were out
there which we weren't entirely sure they were, but it was best not to think that. We had
been hiking for just over half an hour when we came to bend in the river. As we prepared
to follow it Buffy put her hand up and stopped us putting her other hand up to her lips
calling for silence. After a moment she motioned for us to follow her and headed in the
opposite direction to the bend. We walked for a few minutes in silence before Buffy
stopped once more. Carefully she parted the bushes that were in our path and looked
through.</p>

<p>&quot;Found 'em.&quot; She whispered moving aside so that the rest
of us could see what was going on.</p>

<p>There was a large circular clearing. In the middle of it was a stone
dais with carving all along it. Faith was on top of the dais tied down and struggling. She
was saying something, but I couldn't make out what exactly it was, only that it had
something to do with their mothers. The dais was surrounded by a ring of fire, consisting
of blue and green flames, and around the fiery ring was a circle of vampires. There were
ten of them, and they were dressed in brown cloaks and were chanting quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;How do we bust up this giggle fest?&quot; Xander asked quietly
as we moved away from the bushes.</p>

<p>&quot;How close do you two need to be to the party, or does it
matter?&quot; Buffy asked addressing Giles and I.</p>

<p>&quot;We must be in sight of the dais and positioned at the north
and south ends of it,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, this is what we'll do,&quot; Buffy began, now in full
Slayer mode, &quot;Giles will quietly circle around them so that he's on the north side,
when he gets there he'll make a bird call. You can do that right?&quot; Buffy asked the
watcher suddenly.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Giles said sniffing slightly as if he were
insulted.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. So once Giles gives the sign I'll move out into the
clearing on the west side and draw their attention. Once they're all focused on me, Xander
will move in behind them from the east and get Faith, while Will and Giles do their 'um
shanty' thing,&quot; Buffy said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Buff? I hate to be a party pooper but how do I get through
the ring-o- freaky fire over there?&quot; Xander asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Just run really, really fast,&quot; Buffy told him. &quot;Are
we all set?&quot; Giles and I nodded while Xander repeated 'really fast' over and over
again. Once we were decided on what we were going to do Giles, Xander, and Buffy all moved
to their positions.</p>

<p>There were a few minutes of silence after that--well, except for the
colorful phrases Faith was hurling at her captors. The wait seemed like forever, though in
reality it was only a minute or so. Finally, however, I heard an owl hoot and grabbed the
my book ready to head into the field. Seconds after the call Buffy burst into the
clearing.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn't the GAP!&quot; Buffy exclaimed, clearly incensed.
It had the desired effect as all the vampires turned toward her. One of the vampire yelled
&quot;get her&quot;, or &quot;stop her&quot;, or something equally clever and they rushed
her. Seeing this Giles and I stepped inside the clearing and started in with our chants.
Once we were in sight, Xander left his position and started running, really fast, towards
Faith. Buffy had already taken down two of the vamps by the time Xander made it through
the ring of fire.</p>

<p>A few of the vamps seemed to realize that there were more people in
the clearing and stepped up their attack. Realizing we didn't have much time, Giles and I
quickened our pace, watching as a swirling purple and white vortex started to appear over
the clearing. Xander had Faith untied by then and they both moved to intercept the
vampires who were heading for Giles and I.</p>

<p>The fighting continued as Giles and I neared the end of the
incantation. Gold was now mixing in with the purple and white and the wind was starting to
blow violently. When we reached the end, there was a thunderous cracking, like the very
particles in the air surrounding us were exploding one by one, then suddenly lighting bolt
like rays of energy shot out from the center of the vortex and interfaced with the
vampires who were still whole. The energy rays struck them in the back forcing them to
their knees and for a few seconds they stayed like that, almost frozen in time, then one
by one they started to separate into millions of tiny molecules and were sucked up into
the vortex. It was like watching a giant dust buster at work. Then BOOM it was gone, and
the silent forest we entered over an hour ago returned, and the ring of fire slowly
dissipated.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to see Spielberg do that!&quot; Xander declared. We
all just kind of looked at him and laughed, even Giles joined in. We were alive, and the
world was saved from one more gang of evil demons, but most importantly we were alive.</p>

<p>The ride back to the motel was quiet, not uncommon after events like
that. Facing death always seemed to make us a little introspective afterwards. I suppose
it's some sort of built in survival mechanism, your brain going &quot;Why the hell did I
just do that?&quot;, and most people would say never again, but not us, we seemed to have
the &quot;Why not?&quot;, mentality. However our brains still wanted to have their say,
hence the introspective quiet. I really didn't mind the ride though, with Faith in the
back, Buffy and I were squished together and I couldn't really find any fault with that,
that is to say it was all good.</p>

<p>Still five hours is a long time and my mind started drift trying to
catch up with the events of the last two days or so. It was actually quite a lot to catch
up on. At the beginning of the week I was just starting to come to terms with my
unrequited love for my best friend, and was barely able to concentrate on anything for
more than a few seconds, and was being a 'brooding, depressed, running away from her
emotions and hurting her friends' type of gal. Now a mere six days and a whole lot of
country songs later, I was heading to a Motel 6 where I was going to go to sleep and wake
up in Buffy's arms, content in the knowledge that she loved me. I still couldn't
concentrate on anything for more than a few seconds, but this time in a good way. The
brooding was gone, the running had stopped. Okay, so maybe there wasn't a whole lot to
catch up on, but it was still a big change from at the beginning of the week.</p>

<p>When we got back to the motel, all of us were beyond exhausted. We
still had our rooms from earlier that day, so after getting Faith set up, we headed to
them. By the time we got to the motel, it was pretty booked up and the only other room we
could get was at the other end so Faith got our old room and Buffy and I got the new one.
Buffy had the room key so I followed behind her, watching, as I have been known to do. She
was walking a bit stiffly, but otherwise seemed alright. I imagine it was mostly because
she hadn't completely recovered from the wound she had gotten two nights before. She was
talking to me, but to be honest I wasn't quite sure what she was saying, something about
some move Faith had done during the fight or something.</p>

<p>When we got into the room, we both stripped off our clothes and
literally fell into bed. We just lay there on the covers for a few moments before dragging
ourselves up and getting under the covers. We were lying so that we were facing each other
and I saw that sad, contemplative look on Buffy's face again.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot; I asked her gently. I would get an answer
this time. I'm not what you would call forceful, but when Willow Rosenberg makes up her
mind about something, that something gets done.</p>

<p>&quot;Depressing Slayer thoughts. You don't want to hear them,&quot;
Buffy said trying to shrug it off.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes I do,&quot; I told her. &quot;Besides weren't you the one
lecturing me one the up side talking no more than four days ago?&quot; I asked her in my
'we both already know the answer to this and I'm right' voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I warn you, major depress alert here. Could result in the mass
consumption of chocolate, and chocolate like products,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a vending machine in lobby. Spill it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to hurt you,&quot; she said sighing softly.
&quot;I wish I could tell you that everything is going to be alright, and that
this..,&quot; she said making a gesture that meant 'us', &quot;is going to last forever.
But Slayers, we don't have a long life expectancy, I mean if I reach twenty-five I'll be
eligible for my pension plan. There's always going to be demons, and people trying to
sacrifice us, and horned beasts that look like rejects from the movie 'Legend' coming
after me. And one day I'm not going to be good enough, or fast enough to stop them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy...&quot; I started but she continued on.</p>

<p>&quot;Call it the law of averages. I mean I've already died once,
I'm not a cat here you know, I don't have eight more to go. I just...I don't want you to
get hurt,&quot; she said taking my hand. &quot;I don't want this to hurt you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know the risks, Buffy. I know the stakes.&quot; We both
ignored the poor choice of words. &quot;But whether we're together like this or not I'm
still going to be right there beside you,&quot; I told her. &quot;This can only make us
stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When we make love, any part me that isn't already yours will
be. I don't think I could stand it if something happened to you because of me,&quot; she
told me looking down at our linked hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Whether we make love or not, I don't think I could stand it if
anything happened to you,&quot; I told her honestly. Before our first kiss my heart was
hers, and if she put a halt to the road we were traveling now it would still be hers.
&quot;I don't think we have a choice in this. Love isn't logical, it doesn't make sense,
and it doesn't always last, but when you find it you hold on, you hold onto it for as long
as you can, because it's special and beautiful and rare. We can't let 'what ifs' stop us
from loving can we?&quot; I asked her, hoping beyond reason that her answer would be no.</p>

<p>&quot;No. I couldn't stop loving you if I tried. I just...&quot; she
said looking into my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;There's always the possibility it could end tomorrow. I mean
someone could walk outside and be hit by a bus or something? With us it's more likely to
be a flying stake or some variation on that, but what ever you do, whoever your with,
there's always a risk,&quot; I told her. &quot;I want to be with you and love you, and I'm
willing to face the pain that will come if one day something happens. I'm willing to face
the pain because being with you would be worth it. The worst thing in the world I could
think of would be to not be with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You say the sweetest things,&quot; she said with a smile.
&quot;You're worth it, without a doubt you're worth it,&quot; she added. &quot;We'll be
stronger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll be stronger,&quot; I confirmed with a smile, then we
moved together and our lips met in a tender kiss. Within seconds we were kissing deeply,
hungrily, tongues tangling. I moved closer, pressing against Buffy's strong body,
absorbing every sensation that flowed through me. Buffy's mouth grew more insistent,
demanding, soft moans melting into me as her hands moved over my body, tracing, learning.
I moved my hands to her back pressing us together even more, urging her on. Her hand
slowly made it's way up from my abdomen to breasts, I moaned into her mouth as she cupped
them feeling their weight, squeezing.</p>

<p>&quot;Clothes have got to go.&quot; Buffy whispered heatedly as she
removed my bra. Our breathing quickened, as we sought to disrobe each other of what little
clothing we still had on, all the while kissing one another, no thought remaining except
for the amazing sensations coursing between us pulling us together.</p>

<p>Once we were naked, flesh pressed together in the most delicious way
imaginable we kissed sweet, lingering kisses, tasting one another, consuming each other
gently. My hands roamed Buffy's body trying to memorize, learn every curve, while her
fingertips traced the curve of my throat and slid eagerly over my body with quiet
determination.</p>

<p>That night we made love to each other for the first time, slowly,
tenderly, passionately, feverishly, we discovered each other. We talked, we kissed, we
caressed, we laughed, and most importantly we loved and were loved in return. We
completely immersed ourselves in our own private universe where the only things that
existed were each other, and our love. It was the most incredible thing that I had ever
experienced. I had never made love to a woman before, or anyone for that matter, but I
knew exactly how to touch her, how to make her buck, make her arch, make her scream, and
she knew exactly how to do the same to me.</p>

<p>When I first told her I loved her she told me that it was a
beautiful thing, and it was, it was. The ancient Greeks believed that at one time all
people had four legs, and four arms, and two heads, and one soul, but that one night in a
fit of rage Zeus cast down a shower of thunder bolts which split all the people in two so
that they only had two arms, and two legs, and one head, and half a soul. That night I
knew without a doubt that I had found my other half.</p>

<p>Secure, warm, and loved. I felt all of those things as I opened my
eyes to greet the morning. A smile spread across her face as I remembered the previous
night. I was happier than I could ever remember being in my entire life and I knew that
without I owed it all to the woman I was snuggled up against. Raising myself onto my
elbows looked up so that I could regard the sleeping face above me.</p>

<p>&quot;It's about time you woke up,&quot; Buffy said with a smile,
her eyes still closed.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were still asleep,&quot; I said watching her.</p>

<p>&quot;I know what you thought,&quot; she said finally opening her
eyes. She looked down at me and smiled. &quot;Waking up like this makes morning infinitely
more tolerable.&quot; She commented. I smiled back and shifted so that our faces were only
inches apart then moved in and kissed her as my hands started to roam. &quot;I think I've
created a monster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be counter productive to you job don't you
think?&quot; I asked nipping at her neck.</p>

<p>&quot;What was I thinking? Really Will, I'm a Slayer not a
machine,&quot; she said laughing now. The object of stopping at the motel had been to get
rest, however, we didn't much succeed at that. In fact I know for sure that I expended
more energy once we arrived than before.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I tire you out?&quot; I asked with fake concern.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't we find out?&quot; she asked flipping me over.</p>

<p>&quot;I love the way your mind works,&quot; I said giving into the
double assault of Buffy's hands and tongue. She laughed and mumbled something that I
couldn't hear then we settled down for some serious loving.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * *</p>

<p>Buffy and I managed to drag ourselves out of bed around noon when
Giles came knocking at our door. As we exited our room, I accidentally bumped into the guy
who had the room beside us. He looked down at me and kinda smirked, then started trying to
look around me. When Buffy came out of the room, he shifted his gaze between the two of
us, then started laughing saying &quot;No way!!! No wayyyy&quot;, and headed back into his
room yelling &quot;I told you so!&quot;.</p>

<p>Once he was gone Buffy looked at me and said &quot;We're going to
have to work on volume control.&quot;</p>

<p>The ride back to Sunnydale was uneventful and torturous. It was
driving me mad, being shoved up against Buffy for the entire ride and not being able to
touch her. Not to mention the fact the Buffy and Faith kept getting in little fights about
nothing, then tried to hit each other, the main problem with that being that I was in
between them. The only thing that saved me from having to endure this for the entire ride
was that I nearly got clipped in the eye and Buffy put a stop to it. At that point we
still had about three more hours to go though so a game of twenty questions was started
up. I'm not sure which was more painful, being the cream in a Slayer Oreo, or trying to
find out what brand of tea Giles was.</p>

<p>Despite all reason, we went Bronzing later that night. Buffy tried
to get me out there dancing with her and Faith, but I wasn't exactly 'gettin' jiggy wit
it' and decided to just switch between watching them, playing pool with Xander and
avoiding Cordelia. We stayed there for about two hours before Buffy and I decided to book.
We just wanted to spend some time alone, and she still had to make a patrol so I went with
her.</p>

<p>It was wonderful just walking around holding hands talking. Even
though Buffy's attention was split between me and looking for vamps, just being out there
with her felt really special, like we were a real couple. Except for one brief moment
where I was inexplicably mad at society for making us feel like we should have to hide
what we were feeling for each other, the patrol went wonderfully. Afterwards we went for
mocha's then ended up at the park. We sat down on the swings while we finished our drinks,
then Buffy pushed me on them. It was all ridiculously romantic, and I loved every second
of it. After that we moved over to the bench and just sat there for a while, just looking
up at the stars. We got bored of that after a while though, and somehow ended up kissing
on the bench. I don't think that it was one or the other of us who started it, it just
happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Buffy exhaled a moment after we broke apart,
which wasn't exactly the reaction I was expecting. Then I noticed that she was looking
behind me. I figured that there was a vamp or something behind me and turned around so
that I could see. It wasn't a vamp, however, it was Xander and Faith.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I covered that Will,&quot; Buffy responded, standing
up. I joined her and we walked over to our stunned friends.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know that you were a 'girlfriend' girlfriend.&quot;
Faith said with a smirk winking at Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;Wil....Bu...ki...tongu...&quot; Xander started then stopped
settling on a stupefied expression. Buffy and I looked at each other, then back to Xander
and Faith and sighed. It was going to be long, long night, but what else was new?</p>
