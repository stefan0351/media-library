<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 15 -->

<p>Brooke ran an unsteady hand through her hair, tugging at it nervously.  She
had messed up, she had screwed up really badly and know she was dreading
what had to be done to at least try and make it better.  She had been so
concerned with her own thoughts and fears, so introverted after speaking
with Josh that she didn't realize what it would look like to Sam.  She had
known that if Nicole was going to hold off on her campaign of terror she
would have to make it look like she really had begun to take Josh back, that
she had to play the part of soon-to-be girlfriend to him, only Sam didn't
know she was playing a part.  'She didn't know because you didn't tell her',
the little voice at the back of Brooke's head whispered to her.  Brooke
shook her head.  That had been a minor major oversight.  But as she paced
the hallway outside Sam's door, she knew that she wasn't being perfectly
honest with herself.  She had wanted the best of both worlds.  Pretending to
be back together with Josh was a dishonest way for her to try and figure out
if she could take him back, if she could take the road most traveled and be
marginally happy in breeder land without jeopardizing what she had with Sam
while doing it.  She had wanted the best of both worlds and it had blown up
in her face, big time.</p>

<p>Gathering her courage she raised her hand and knocked at the door.  There
was no reply, which didn't really surprise her.  She opened her mouth as if
to call out, but suddenly closed it thinking better of the situation.  If
Sam knew that it was her outside the door she might shove a dresser or
something in front of the door before Brooke could get a chance to talk to
her.  Instead she decided that it would be best if she just let herself in.
The lock on Sam's door was old and slightly defective if you knew it's weak
points which Brooke did.</p>

<p>Heading into her room she grabbed a hair pin from off of her dresser then
made her way back to Sam's door.  After a moment of fiddling with the lock
she heard the door click open and pushed her way inside.</p>

<p>The room was dark, and upon entering the only sound that Brooke could detect
was the mournful sounds of Patsy Cline.  As Brooke scanned the room for Sam,
the words coming from the radio flittered into her brain making her heart
heavy with guilt for what she had done.</p>

<p align=center><i>Crazy<br>
      Crazy for feeling so lonely<br>
      I'm crazy<br>
      Crazy for feeling so blue</i></p>

<p align=center><i>I knew<br>
      You'd love me as long as you wanted<br>
      And then someday<br>
      You'd leave me for somebody new</i></p>
<p align=center><i>Worry<br>
      Why do I let myself worry<br>
      Wond'rin'<br>
      What in the world did I do</i></p>
<p align=center><i>Crazy<br>
      For thinking that my love could hold you<br>
      I'm crazy for tryin'<br>
      Crazy for cryin'<br>
      And I'm crazy<br>
      For lovin' you</i></p>

<p>Finally Brooke spotted Sam sitting in the corner of the room between her bed
and the wall next to Sir Hugglesworth: The Most Cuddliest Bear In The Whole
Wide World-or so a five year old Sam McPherson had deemed him many years
ago.  As Brooke approached the brunette she could feel Sam's eyes on her,
watching her with a brutal intensity that she felt she absolutely deserved.</p>

<p>"Sam," she said softly, her voice splintering near the end.  At the sound of
her voice she saw Sam's eyes close almost painfully, a tear streaking down
her face as she hugged her knees closer to her body.  As Brooke watched her
she felt her own eyes begin to tear not for the first time that day, and she
knelt down, instinctively reaching out to brush the tears from Sam's cheek.</p>

<p>The moment her fingers made contact with Sam's skin, Sam flinched away from
her touch, turning her head, before bringing her own hand up a moment later
to bat Brooke's hand away.  "Don't touch me," she whispered harshly, her
voice breaking with every syllable she uttered.  Until that day, Sam had
always thought the saying 'dying of a broken heart' was a flight of fanciful
imagination, but as she sat there shaking into her own arms, she understood
the sentiment of the colloquial most intimately.  The way she felt, she
could as well have been dying.</p>

<p>"Please," Brooke responded letting her hand drop.  "Let me explain."</p>

<p>"I hate you with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns," Sam replied
acerbically as she tried to turn away from Brooke.  "I hope you choke on a
pomp-pomp."</p>

<p>"Please Sam," Brooke responded desperately, "just let me talk to you."  She
could see Sam still shaking and it took all of her self-control not to reach
out and try to comfort her again knowing that it would only would it make
things worse.</p>

<p>"Please?" Sam asked incredulously.  "Listen, I can only please one person a
day.  Today is not your day.  Tomorrow's not looking to good for you
either," she continued.  The tears were coming less frequently now, and she
was beginning to come back to herself enough to know that she was really,
really pissed off.  "Did you mean any of it?" Sam asked a moment later, a
note of vulnerability creeping into her voice despite her wishes.  But then
she figured that it shouldn't have surprised her.  She had never really been
able to hide her emotions from Brooke, so why should it be any different now
that it was pain she was feeling instead of love.  "Or was it just part of
some sadistic plan to fuck me for those editorials?  Literally, and
figuratively," she continued in an accusatory tone.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes closed agonizingly as she listened to Sam's words.  "Whatever
you heard, whatever you're thinking right now…that I did, I didn't do…I
haven't done, and I absolutely positively do not want to do.  This has all
been one epic case of 'telephone' gone bad," Brooke said slowly moving a bit
closer to Sam.  "I meant everything I've said to you, I mean everything I've
said to you," Brooke continued.  "I love you…you're my heart."</p>

<p>"Harrison heard Josh talking to Nicole…about what you and he did last
night," Sam responded refusing to meet Brooke's eyes.  "If that's what you
do with your heart than I don't want it."</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything with Josh last night," Brooke stated.  "The only thing
that being with him did was testify to the fact that nobody makes me feel
the way you do.  That I love you more than I have words to express it,"
Brooke continued moving again so that she was kneeling directly in front of
Sam.  "You're the one.  You're the only one, and I need you," she finished
leaning forward and gently bringing their lips together.</p>

<p>When they separated Brooke could feel Sam's body begin to shake against hers
and could feel the wetness of Sam's tears against her cheek as they once
again began to stream down her face.  Before she could react to that however
she felt Sam begin to push against her violently as she muttered obscenities
at her, but Brooke wouldn't let go this time.  Instead she grappled with
Sam's hands until she managed to get a good hold on the girl then drew her
into the circle of her arms, where Sam continued to struggle for a moment
before relaxing into the circle of Brooke's arms crying out her heartache
onto the shoulder of Brooke's shirt.</p>
