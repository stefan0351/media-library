<p>Sam smiled, it was a low, sexy smile, and she saw the girl standing
across from her respond with a similar expression.  Sam reached out
her hand and crooked her finger out beckoning Brooke to come towards
her as she bit down on her bottom lip, her eyes twinkling throughout
the entire display.  To her surprise the other girl shook her head,
relaxing her stance; it became clear to Sam that Brooke didn't intend
to go anywhere.</p>

<p>"If you want me," Brooke drawled out, an impish smile gracing her
lips.  "Come and get me," she continued her tone turning teasing.  So
it was a challenge, that was fine with Sam, she loved challenges.  </p>

<p>Sam advanced on the blonde, her movements were slow and touched with
a feline grace.  She was an elegant, sleek jungle cat closing in on
her prey.  She didn't blink, she barely breathed, her entire being
focused on capturing the prize in front of her.  </p>

<p>Upon reaching her quarry, she extended her hand, she had met the
challenge and she now wanted her prize.  Brooke took a step back,
dancing out of Sam's grasp.  Sam took another step forward and
reached for her again.  Once more, Brooke stepped back, smiling all
the time.  Sam observed her for a second, quirking an eyebrow up
questioning.</p>

<p>"You're not playing fair," she commented impatiently, but there was a
somewhat petulant, almost whiny tone to her voice as well.</p>

<p>"Would you like some cheese to go along with that whine," Brooke
replied with a mockingly inquisitive expression on her face.  Her
eyes however remained amused, teasing Sam.  "Well?" she asked a
moment later when the brunette didn't respond.  Her hand dropped down
to her waist as she said this, then started to trail up her torso and
further up in-between her breasts suggestively as she watched Sam
intently.</p>

<p>"You'll just move away again," Sam responded though she began to move
towards Brooke again.  She couldn't help it, the blonde called to
her, like a moth to a flame.</p>

<p>"You'll never know unless you try," Brooke responded.  Her finger was
now in her mouth, the tip of it resting on her bottom lip innocently —
 in a Catholic schoolgirl in porn kind of way, that is.</p>

<p>Sam moved towards her once again, reaching out as she stepped up to
Brooke.  This time the blonde didn't step back, instead she relaxed
her body letting Sam pull her into her so that they were soon nose to
nose.  They observed each other for a moment, Sam's head leaning
forward then pulling back again in uncertainty, her lips hovering
just in front of Brooke's.  The blonde smiled as she watched the
display, her tongue jutting out to lick her bottom lip.</p>

<p>"Come on Sam," Brooke said, her tone was soft but serious, it had
lost the teasing edge that had coated all of her previous
statements.  "You know you want to," she continued, "why don't you
practice what you preach."  </p>

<p>Sam was still for a moment after Brooke spoke, then without further
ado she leaned in and brought their lips together.  The contact was
hesitant at first, but in a short period of time their embrace became
increasing heated.  Their lips crashed against each other, their
bodies straining to increase the contact between them.  Their hands
roamed each other's bodies, skin on skin, skin of cloth, caressing
and exploring in a desperate haze.</p>

<p>The next thing Sam knew, they were lying on her bed and they were
both completely naked.  Brooke was draped over her body, covering
almost every inch of her.  She found that her own hands were trailing
up Brooke's sides, towards her now fully exposed chest.  She arched
up into Brooke's hands, scarcely aware of the guttural sounds being
emoted from her own throat.</p>

<p>"Who do you want?" Brooke whispered into Sam's ear as her hands
expertly manipulated the brunette's body.  Sam was too preoccupied to
respond.  "Who do you want?" Brooke repeated, ceasing her movements
and looking at Sam intently.</p>

<p>"You," Sam moaned desperately as Brooke's hand began to trail below
her waist and her hips expectantly.  "I want you."</p>

<p>Sam bolted up into a sitting position, her chest heaving as she
blinked rapidly.  She braced her hands on the side of her body and
closed her eyes taking a few deep calming breaths.  When she
eventually she managed to get her breathing somewhat under control,
she sighed dejectedly and flopped back down on the bed.  Dammit, not
again!  She couldn't freaking believe it, this was the fourth night
in a row she had had the same dream about Brooke – well not exactly
the same dream as they had gotten increasingly more graphic as time
went on – and it was starting to piss her the hell off.  Not only was
she haunted by Brooke for most of her waking hours, but now her
unconscious had joined in too.  It was a damn conspiracy.</p>

<p>She turned her head to the side.  The phone was ringing.  She
smirked, not only was she glad to have the distraction, but she if
this was the call she thought it was, she had been waiting for it for
what seemed like eons and it couldn't have come at a better time.
There was no more time to think about the meaning of her Brooke
dreams, she had bigger fish to fry, greener pastures to move on to
and all of that wonderful stuff.</p>

<p>"Hello?" she said hurriedly picking up the receiver, speaking into it
before she even had the other end at her ear.</p>

<p>"Persephone?" the voice on the other end asked.  The voice was
unmistakably male, but Sam had already expected that, what threw her
momentarily was tone which wasn't nearly as deep as she had expected
it to be.</p>

<p>"Arabian Knight?" she asked, shaking her head at the codename once
again.  That one always cracked her up.</p>

<p>"Is Operation Sizzler still a go?" Arabian Knight asked, his voice
dropping secretively.  Sam could almost picture him looking around
his surroundings furtively, keeping an eye out for Fibbies in black,
or places that could be easily bugged.</p>

<p>"You tell me?" Sam responded.  "Everything's five by five on my end,"
she continued deciding to play along with espionage-ese for the
moment.</p>

<p>"The Museum of Modern Art, the janitorial closet across from the
Pollack exhibit 8:00 pm," he responded.  "Be there," he intoned
seriously, "or be square.  Arabian Knight out."  This was followed by
the irritating buzzing of the dial tone.  Sam rolled her eyes and
replaced the phone on the hook.  He was goofier than she expected,
but that didn't matter to her as long as he could deliver the goods.</p>

<p>"Sam," she heard her mother call through the door as she rolled out
of bed.  "Get up, your going to be late," she continued.</p>

<p>"It's only 7:30," Sam called back as she ran a hand through her hair
and rubbed at her eyes.</p>

<p>"That may be so, but Brooke's already dressed and eating breakfast.
You don't want to miss the bus," Jane replied.  </p>

<p>"I'll be down in a minute," Sam responded.  Soon after that she heard
her mothers footsteps retreating down the hallway and she let out an
exasperated breath.   "Brooke's already dressed and eating breakfast"
she repeated sourly in mocking tone as she stomped towards the
bathroom.  She hadn't even been wake for half an hour and already
Brooke was haunting her.</p>

<p>Brooke's surveyed the crowd uneasily.  An abnormal silence had come
over the assembled group of teenagers coating the peeling walls of
the bus station with a palpable tension.  Brooke closed her eyes, her
face scrunching up in anticipation of the inevitable.  She could feel
the indignation swelling in the chests of each and every one of her
peers, she could see hands clenching all around her, she could hear
breaths being sucked in sharply, and breathes coming in huffs.  In
about one point five seconds, things were going to get very ugly.</p>

<p>Then it happened, all around her people erupted into fits of rage.
Screaming, yells, fists pumping in the air.  All around her comments
were being shouted at the front of the station, "What do you mean
there's a seating plan?!",  "The fuck?!",  "Excuse me!"  To her
immediate right, she could hear Nicole starting up.  "No!  No, I
don't think that YOU understand.  Listen to me…no listen TO ME.  Pull
your floppy ears out of the dog dish and listen to the grape vine,
there is no way in hell that…"  but the cries were soon interrupted
by a screeching Bio Glass.</p>

<p>"If you want," Glass yelled waving a clip board in the air,  "to be
getting on this bus," she continued surveying the crowd with beady
eyes, "you will shut your traps this instant and," she turned to face
Nicole as she spoke, "as Miss Julian so gracefully put it," there was
a definite snare on her face, "you will listen to the grapevine!"</p>

<p>Everyone was quiet.</p>

<p>"The seating is alphabetical," Glass announced, eyes roaming over the
crowd.  "Now move!"  And with that she began to announce who would be
sitting with each other on the bus.</p>

<p>"Cherry and Esposito," Glass yelled out.  "Front and center."</p>

<p>Sam looked over at Lily trying valiantly to contain her smile, as for
how well that worked, well, they say it's the thought that counts.
Lily glared at her then made her way to the front.  As she reached
Bio Glass, she saw Mary Cherry look back and wink at her causing a
deep, chilling shiver to run through her body.  She looked over at
Glass in desperation, panic over came her and threw herself at Glass,
grasping onto her arm like it was gas mask on a crashing plane.</p>

<p>"Please, please don't make me sit with her!" Lily pleaded
desperately, looking into Glass's eyes.  "Oh God, don't make me sit
with her," the brunette continued.</p>

<p>"Get on the bus Esposito," Glass responded shaking Lily off.  "And
for God's sake, pull yourself together."</p>

<p>"Ford and Ferrerr," Glass called out next.</p>

<p>Carmen looked over at Sam and winked, causing the journalist to shake
her head and whisper "go `em tiger!", to which Carm blushed and
smiled nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Julian and John."</p>

<p>As Harrison walked by Sam crossed herself and mumbled, "my prayers
are with you".  As he approached the front of the bus Nicole turned
around, and while nobody could be absolutely certain it appeared as
if she growled at him.</p>

<p>"McPherson and McQueen," Glass called out, then paused for a
second.  "Oh, how quaint," Glass then added smiling as Brooke and Sam
approached.</p>

<p>Sam sighed as she walked to their designated seating area.  New York
was a very long way away, and Sam could tell that this was going to
be a positively excruciating bus ride.</p>

<p>Sam looked up and over at the girl next to her, an expression of
extreme annoyance covering her features.  Her nostrils flared and she
rolled her tongue about in her cheek as she observed Brooke.</p>

<p>"I know!" the blonde exclaimed into her Fido excitedly.  "I know!"
she repeated making the two words last at least twice as long as they
should have.  "I know, I know," she continued smiling and nodding her
head.  "I…"</p>

<p>"If you say `I know' one more time I will personally rip that phone
out of your hand and beat you with it," Sam interrupted, barely
restraining herself from reaching out and shaking the blonde.  "Know
that," she continued letting out a shuddering breath.</p>

<p>"Uh oh. Spam alert, Spam alert," could suddenly be heard coming from
the front of the bus.  "Abort mission, no equipment for a bitter, old
hag attack."</p>

<p>Sam braced her hands on the arms rests and raised herself up so that
she could see over the seats in front her.  Turning her attention to
the front of the bus she spotted Nicole looking back at her with a
smile on her.  Sam glared at the blonde for a moment and then sat
down.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Nicole whispered to herself with a smile as she turned
back around to face forward.  It was then that she felt eyes on
her.  "What are you staring at Shaggy?" she asked turning to face
Harrison who quickly averted his eyes to avoid being turned to stone.</p>

<p>Mary Cherry bounced in seat practically dying  because she was so far
away from the action.  As she watched Nicole turn her wrath on Joe a
small whimper escaped from between her lips.  She was suffering from
withdrawal pains, it felt like all of her organs were shriveling up
into little raisin sized morsels.  She didn't like being surrounded
by brunettes at all, the had an earthy, rustic smell to them that
disturbed sophisticated sensibilities.  Feeling lower than Charlize
Theron after she wore the same pantsuit as Charisma Carpenter Mary
Cherry turned her attention to Lil' Lily and suddenly she felt better.</p>

<p>Lily sensed Mary Cherry's eyes on her and shuddered.  Oh lord, not
again, Lily thought to herself.  The southerner had actually left her
alone for ten minutes or so, but that was about to change, Lily could
feel it building up like a tropical storm.  Hesitantly, almost
painful she turned her head so that she could see Mary Cherry.  The
blonde was sitting up straight and had her head craned at an odd
angle; when she noticed Lily watching her she smiled and licked her
lips winking at Lily suggestively.  The brunette watched in a state
of confusion before she finally realized that with the angle Mary
Cherry was leaning at the blonde could see down her shirt.  She
shuddered again, her hands gripping the arm rests like they were the
last bottle of Evian in the Sahara desert.  Then as she saw Mary
Cherry begin to dig into her leather carry on bag, panic gripped her
and she frantically turned around looking behind her.  She had to
escape.</p>

<p>"Lookie what I got Lil' Lily," Mary Cherry said drawing Lily's
attention back to her.  </p>

<p>Lily shook her head and began to mouth "no, no" over again before
suddenly standing up and running to the end of the bus where she
locked herself in the washroom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Brooke turned her head to look at Sam who was still watching her with
an expression that could peel paint.  The brunette's death stare had
been momentarily broken when she turned to watch Lily run through the
aisle, but she was now back at it with a renewed vigor.  Raising her
hand up Brooke pointedly clicked her phone off, the small screen
going black with a little beep.  "Not that I didn't enjoy the threats
of bodily injury," Brooke started in a soft tone, "but all you had to
do was ask," she continued turning away from Sam and slumping back in
her chair slightly.</p>

<p>Sam looked over at Brooke, feeling genuinely ashamed.  Sometimes she
was just so Joan Crawford not even she could stand it.  "I'm sorry,"
Sam said softly as she too slumped back in her chair moodily.  She
was surprised at how easily the words fell out of her mouth, though
she considered that with the thoughts that had been running through
her head lately she shouldn't really have been.</p>

<p>"I was just bored," Brooke mumbled a minute later breaking the
silence that had arisen between the two of them after Sam spoke.  Sam
looked over at her but didn't say anything.  "And I think we both
know that you weren't exactly an option," she continued as her eyes
traced the contours of the roof idly.</p>

<p>"That's not true," Sam muttered under her breath as she picked at one
of her nails, her eyes flickering to observe Brooke's profile
nonetheless.  Brooke didn't respond to her verbally, but Sam did she
her loll her head to the side and roll her eyes dramatically.  She
frowned.</p>

<p>"That was mature," Sam commented, moody once more.</p>

<p>Brooke turned to look at her, a mildly amused expression on her
face.  "You're the one that threatened to beat me to death with my
phone and you're question my maturity level?" she asked.  Instead of
responding Sam returned to picking at her nails.  "You know, you can
act as pissy as you want to, but you know you wouldn't have talked to
me," Brooke continued.  This comment caused Sam to look over at her,
not so much because of what she said but because of how she said it.
There was something in Brooke's voice, an accusation, a sadness that
Sam couldn't help but acknowledge.</p>

<p>"Even if I wanted to talk to you," Sam started somewhat defensively,
though she didn't exactly know why, "what could we possibly have
talked about?  I know that I'm personally at a loss as to what could
out do that no doubt mentally exhausting `I know' conversation."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Brooke responded turning to face Sam.  "Maybe
Herman Melville's condemnation of consumer society as can be seen in
his little appreciated work `Bartleby, the Scrivener'."</p>

<p>Sam's lips parted in her surprise and her brows scrunched
together.  "I…" she started to say.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Brooke interrupted turning away once more.  "I've
decided to re-organize my make-up case."</p>

<p>Sam stared at her for a moment longer, her mind trying to come to
grasps with the fact that, one, Brooke knew who Herman Melville was,
let alone was able to comment on the themes of one of works, and two,
that she commented on the condemnation of consumer society and then
decided to re-organize her make-up case.  Shaking her head, she
turned around and looked out the window.  Screw Brooke, she didn't
really want to talk to her anyway.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her head to look at Sam just as the brunette turned to
face her.  Their eyes locked and narrowed.  They had entered their
room only moments before engaging in this almost primal staring
contest.  Sam licked her lips.  Brooke noticed the movement and
blinked.  This was the opportunity that Sam had been looking for.
She smiled to herself and thought `sucker!'  She broke out into a
sprint.  Brooke noticed the movement and started after her, but she
was too slow.  Sam jumped into the air launching herself forward,
landing on the mattress softly, skidding across it for a second
before coming to complete stop.  She raised herself into a sitting
and then a standing position where she turned to face Brooke arms
raised high in triumph.</p>

<p>"I have picked my bed," Sam declared smiling.  It was the one on the
right side of the room, the one she knew Brooke wanted.  Both of them
had this thing with having whatever was on the right side, and she
had won this battle.  </p>

<p>"Whatever," Brooke mumbled staring at Sam as if she were trying to
cast a spell that would inflict the ten plagues of Egypt plus a
clashing wardrobe upon the brunette.  After that voodoo moment Brooke
then bent down and picked up her suitcase adding `stupid jackass'
under her breath as she carried it over to the other bed.</p>

<p>Sam sat and down on the bed and crossed her legs watching as Brooke
resentfully heave her suitcase onto the bed, still muttering under
her breath.</p>

<p>"Don't be bitter," Sam commented as she luxuriated across her bed,
sighing contently, "it'll give you wrinkles."</p>

<p>Brooke frowned, turning her head slightly so that she could see
Sam.  "I'd ask if you're always this annoying, but I'm already
painfully aware of the answer to that question," Brooke responded,
pushing to suitcase to the other side of the bed and lying down
wearily.</p>

<p>"Hey, I didn't ask to be roomed with you either Merry Sunshine," Sam
replied getting up off of the bed and moving to retrieve her own
suitcase, which had been unceremoniously dumped just inside the
doorway.  Hauling the luggage up onto her bed, Sam looked over at
Brooke just in time to see the blonde smirk and let out a short,
derisive, wisp of laughter before then moodily turning her attention
to the ceiling.  Sam observed her for a second, think that she looked
rather peaceful despite the situation, the way the light was shining
on her seemed to light her hair up making it look like she was
surrounded by a golden halo, and the angle that she had her head
titled at gave her a rather reflective appearance, like one of those
ancient Greek statues from the classical period where the subject
always looked like the were contemplating some elusive truth.</p>

<p>Sam turned away and began to fiddle with her suitcase, trying to open
it.  She had things to prepare for tomorrow before Glass came to get
them for dinner.  There were other things to think about besides
Brooke.  She was on a mission after all.</p>

<p>"Dammit," Sam exclaimed a moment later.  The lock to her suitcase
seemed to be stuck.  She did not need this.  In fact, she was so busy
trying to mentally combust the case that she didn't notice Brooke
approach her until the blonde spoke.</p>

<p>"Here," Brooke softly said coming to stop beside Sam and reaching
over for the case.  "Mine does this all the time," she continued
turning her head to look at Sam for a moment before returning her
gaze to the suitcase.  Sam felt herself gulp, and prayed to God that
it wasn't audible.  Having Brooke this close to her, speaking to her
in a soft sexy whisper was doing things to her that was only suppose
to happen when she was alone in her room at night.  </p>

<p>"All you have to do is very gently," and with that Brooke raised her
arm high up into the air and slammed it down onto the top of the
leather suitcase with all of her strength.  Sam gaped at her, so
surprised by Brooke's assault of her suitcase that she didn't resist
when the blonde then reached for the key which was loosely held in
her hand, and removed it using it to open the case.</p>

<p>"Thanks?" Sam responded still mildly stunned, but glad that she was
no longer in the Brooke induced fog that had been hanging over her
moments before.  Brooke took a step away from Sam, looking over at
her, a small smile gracing her features before she looked away and
headed back over to her side of the room.  "I meant that," Sam added
a moment later.</p>

<p>"Your welcome," Brooke replied as she lay back down and closed her
eyes while taking in a deep breath.  Sam smelt like lavender and she
could still faintly detect the scent hovering about her.  She liked
it, not that she would ever in life tell Sam that.  </p>

<p>She stayed like that for a moment longer then  opened her eyes and
turned to look at Sam once more.  "Wake me up for dinner?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded nodding as she spoke, she was feeling a wee bit
out of it, she knew this because it didn't even occur to her to fight
with Brooke, no "what am I?  Your freaking butler?", no "yes
highness, would you like me to fan while I'm at it?", no "This may be
the Plaza but that ain't on the room serve menu", just `yeah'.  Sam
continued to watch Brooke as Brooke continued to look at her but then
the blonde turned away and closed her eyes once again, and Sam too
looked away suddenly deciding that what the room desperately needed
was some ice.</p>

<p>Brooke slowly, curiously cracked one eye open.  For the last couple of
seconds she had been coated with a feeling of unease, as if someone
was watching her.  However, years of movies of the week and badly
acted films had instilled a certain amount of caution in her, and if
there was some bloody thirsty killer in the room she didn't want them
to know that she was awake, so she barely cracked open one eye and
looked out to see what awaited her.</p>

<p>"Ah," Brooke cried jumping back slightly.  What had awaited her was
Sam's face hovering inches away from her.</p>

<p>"Hee," and a smile was Sam's response to her.  Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"What are you doing you psycho?" Brooke mumbled as she pulled herself
together.  Sam continued to smile.</p>

<p>"You asked me to wake you up," Sam replied seating herself of the edge
of Brooke's bed.  "So I woke you up."</p>

<p>"I said wake me, not stare at me like some pedophile in training,"
Brooke responded as she sat up slightly.  She hadn't bothered to get
under the covers, so all she had to do was rest her back against the
headboard to be on even ground with Sam-who seemed to be making
herself quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Sam's face dropped a bit when Brooke said that, her expression turning
serious.  Brooke wasn't sure what to make of the change so she
remained silent.  Sam turned her head so that she was facing Brooke,
her eyes locked on her intensely.</p>

<p>"I really didn't mean to scare you, I was just about to tap you on the
shoulder when you woke up," she began conciliatorily.   </p>

<p>"It's okay," Brooke responded feeling compelled to say something.
"I'm not really a morning…no, make that a getting up person.  It
doesn't really matter what time it is, I just don't like it."</p>

<p>Sam smirked but her expression soon became serious once more.  She
turned her head away again so that she was looking at her lap.</p>

<p>"I did watch you though," she said a moment later, raising her head to
look out the window.  Brooke looked confused but didn't say anything.
 "You're so small," Sam continued a second later.  "You looked
so….small," she went on hesitating for a second them shrugging her
shoulders helplessly as she repeated the word 'small'.</p>

<p>"I…" Brooke started, not at all sure what to make of Sam's behavior.</p>

<p>"Don't know what to make of that?" Sam asked interrupting Brooke, that
cocky smile of hers once again covering her face.  Brooke nodded
smiling herself, encouraged by the expression on Sam's face.</p>

<p>"If I were you I'd be a morning, or should I say getting up, person,"
Sam continued still observing Brooke.</p>

<p>"Why?" Brooke questioned intrigued by Sam.  She couldn't figure out
why the other girl was actually talking to her, she figured maybe it
was to show her up for that comment she'd made on the bus, but
truthfully she didn't care.  She just wanted to see where this was
going.</p>

<p>"Because like an astonishing one per cent of the population you
actually wake up looking refreshed and rosy cheeked," Sam said.  "It's
really quite remarkable how much money you spend supporting Max Factor
when it's good genes and enough sleep that do all the work."</p>

<p>Brooke stared at her, completely and utterly befuddled.  She was sure
that for a second or two after Sam had spoken her mouth had opened so
that she was gaping at the other girl, but she had quickly closed it
so that now she was only staring at her in amazement.  She didn't know
what to say to that, so she fell back on the old reliable route of
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Flattery will get you everywhere, but you're already in my bed,"
Brooke said winking at the other girl.  She had assumed that Sam would
get all huffy at the comment, make some remark about her lack of
maturity and stalk into the bathroom where she would remain for so
long that Brooke would have no time to get in there before they were
called down for dinner.  Brooke was wrong, Sam did none of those
things.  Sam looked over at her and smiled.  Then Sam shifted her
position so that she was sitting leaned up against the headboard right
next to Brooke.</p>

<p>"That almost sounded like a invitation Ms. McQueen," Sam said
teasingly.</p>

<p>"Make of it what you will," Brooke replied because quite frankly she
had no idea what to say other than that.</p>

<p>"Alright," Sam responded thoughtfully nodding her head slowly in
contemplation for a moment before looking back over at Brooke.  "I
will," she continued, that smile, that damn cocky loveable smile back
on her face.  And before Brooke knew it Sam's lips were on hers,
pressing against hers.  Surprise caused her to try and jerk her head
back at first, it was a base instinct, but she found that she couldn't
do it.  Sam's hand had followed the course of her lips and was holding
the back of Brooke's head firmly in place.  The only way to stop the
kiss would have been for Brooke to push Sam away from her, and, well,
she found that she didn't really want to do that.  Her body relaxed
and she leaned forward into the kiss, surrendering to Sam's skillful
ministrations.  As she leaned into the kiss she felt Sam smile against
her lips then shift closer to her on the bed.  This caused Brooke to
smile herself before then forcibly bringing Sam's lips back to hers,
moaning into Sam's mouth as her passion mounted.  If this is how she
was woken up every morning, there just might have been hope for her
yet.</p>

<p></p>

<p>
"Sam?" Brooke questioned.  She was feeling a bit dizzy.  She didn't
understand it, she felt like she was being shaken.  "Sam stop that
this instant," she said looking across her and noticing that Sam's
hands were now on her shoulders and were apparently trying the shake
the shit out of her.</p>

<p>"Goddammit wake up!" Sam yelled shaking Brooke some more.  First the
stupid girl tells her to wake her up, then she lies there like limp
noodle mumbling at Sam while channeling somebody's mother.</p>

<p>"The…?" Brooke asked opening her eyes and seeing Sam standing over her
still shaking her for all she was worth.  "I'm awake," Sam still
didn't stop.  "I'm awake," Brooke repeated, her head was starting to
pound.  "Get your bloody hands off of me, I said I'm awake!" she
yelled finally raising her hands trying to beat Sam off of her before
she did some serious damage to her brain.</p>

<p>"Dinner, fifteen minutes," Sam told her with a scowl then the brunette
stalked across the room and walked out the door.</p>

<p>Brooke drew her knees up to her body and dropped her head onto them.
This was not good, she thought herself, although secretly she admitted
she liked how Sam had woken her up in her dream better than reality.
No, she then thought to herself, you will not think such thoughts.
This…nightmare, she continued as she flung her legs over the edge of
the bed and stood up, was not about Sam or sex or especially not about
sex with Sam.  That was just ludicrous.  It was about…about…about her
own narcissism, yes that was it.  She was far to complimentary to
herself in the dream, this was her subconscious's way of telling her
to get over herself.  Well, she thought, message sealed, signed and
delivered.  As she stood in front of the mirror, she decided - with
this new knowledge fresh in her mind-that she was only going to wear
foundation and lip gloss to dinner.</p>

<p>Brooke rolled her head around her shoulders tiredly and rubbed at her
eyes.  She was finding it increasingly difficult to concentrate on
what their tour guide was saying.  She had gotten next to no sleep
the night before and she was feeling the effects of it now.  She and
Sam hadn't spoken much when they had returned to their room after
dinner, and when they did speak to each other it was fleeting, yet
surprisingly polite.  Mundane things, who got first dibs on the
bathroom, who was going to put their clothes in which drawer, which
one of them got control of the remote.  Despite the civility of the
conversation however, it was uncomfortable as hell and if it hadn't
been for the fact that it was after midnight and that they were on
lockdown, Brooke would have made her rounds and gone to visit Nicole
and Mary Cherry in the adjoining suites they had reserved on the top
floor.   But it had been after midnight, they were on lockdown, and
Brooke was left with no other option but than to lay down, and try
not to think about Sam, which, vexingly, was something she had been
finding increasing hard to do since the brunette had woken her up
earlier on.  Then to make matters worse, it seemed as if Sam was
having trouble sleeping too, so they both had lay there in the dark
painfully aware of the others presence until Sam had broken the
silence.  In fact Brooke could remember everything that had been said
perfectly.</p>

<p>{"Brooke?" Sam had said softly, the word hovering in the air for a
moment before the blonde responded.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke had said, her eyes trained on the ceiling—not that she
could make it out or anything.</p>

<p>"You awake?"  Sam asked.</p>

<p>"What do you think Sam?" Brooke had responded turning so that she was
facing Sam's bed even though she couldn't see her.  It wasn't like
Sam to ask stupid questions, so it immediately put Brooke on guard.</p>

<p>"I'll go with, yes," Sam responded, her tone a bit rueful.  "Listen,
I just wanted to say I shouldn't have shook you like that, and if
your head really hurts then…"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I won't make you say it," Brooke responded.  "Wouldn't
want a black hole opening in the room and sucking time and space into
a huge gaping oblivion because we seemed to be getting along."  She
paused there for a moment.  "And it only hurt for a little while."</p>

<p>"Yes…well…" Sam said in response.  Brooke had expected more to follow
that, but apparently Sam was done, because the silence came after
that once more.  Just as she was about to drift off to sleep however,
she learned that she was wrong about the silence because Sam started
a up again a few minutes later.  "I was thinking, that is to say that
our previous conversation and you helping me with my suitcase made me
think," Sam continued shaking her head at herself as the words came
out of her mouth.</p>

<p>"And," Brooke questioned, sitting up slightly.</p>

<p>"And I think we should try, you know, make a valiant attempt to not
piss each other off.  Although the argument could be made that this
situation shouldn't really be new for each of us since we live
together back home, that argument is faulty.  The fallacy lies mostly
with the principles of time and space, which allow for us to be
hardly ever occupying the same area at the same time back home.
Here, however, things are different and…fighting could lead to bodily
harm.  So if you can pretend that you don't hate me for four more
days, I think this trip could be much more enjoyable for both of us,"
Sam replied hurriedly, before letting out a breath and sinking back
down onto her pillow.</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a long time after Sam spoke, so long in fact
that Sam had begun to wonder if  the blonde had fallen asleep by the
time she replied.  "That sounds acceptable," Brooke said
finally.  "And," she added pausing again, "I never hated you," she
went on quickly, then she shifted again, her sheets rustling together
audibly and she closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Brooke…" Sam started a second later, surprised by the other girls
words.  Actually Brooke's words had caused some heart palpitations,
but Sam chose not to focus on that at the moment.</p>

<p>"Brooke's sleeping now," the blonde responded, "she'll be available
again in the morning, thank you and please call again," she continued
effectively putting an end to the conversation.</p>

<p>"What no beep?" Sam asked afterwards, but she said nothing after that
and Brooke could hear her settle down into the bedding like she had
done only moments before.}  </p>

<p>Brooke was broken out of her revere by the tour guide who was
explaining the origins of Van Gogh's "Starry Night" to them.  "When
Vincent van Gogh was a patient in an asylum at Saint-Rémy in the
south of France, he wrote to his brother Theo," she was saying as
Brooke looked around to see if anyone had noticed her space
out.  "This morning I saw the country from my window a long time
before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very
big," the tour guide went on.  Looking around her at the restless
faces of the Kennedy students loosely assembled around her, Brooke
figured that it was a good thing this was the last painting on the
tour.  It was becoming very clear to her that the natives were
getting restless, and truthfully she counted herself among them. "He
said he stayed up for three nights painting the picture because
according to him, the night is more alive and more richly colored
than the day."  This was followed by clapping and then the scattering
students who ran off to eat, or smoke, or ogle the nudie pictures
during their free time.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes immediately drifted over to Sam.  She never wanted her
eyes to immediately drift over to Sam, but despite her wishes her
eyes just seemed to do it anyway, so not for the first time that day
she found herself gazing at Sam, this time as the brunette walked
away.  Sam had branched off from her other friends, heading in the
opposite direction; Brooke would have wondered where she was off to,
but Nicole grabbed her arm and started dragging her down the hall.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" Brooke asked giving up trying to follow Sam
with her eyes and turning her attention to Nicole.  </p>

<p>"Does it matter?" the shorter blonde responded.  "The hell away from
here," she continued shaking her head.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sam paused, she had the strangest feeling that someone was watching
her.  She knew she was late for her meeting, but she turned around
anyway, worse than being late would have been having someone notice
where she was off to.  Looking behind her she noticed Kennedy
students scattering, but didn't see anyone watching her except for
maybe Brooke who was in the process of turning around anyway.
Despite herself Sam watched Nicole drag Brooke through the hall for a
moment longer before turning around herself and heading towards the
Pollack exhibit.  She didn't have time to think about Brooke, she had
a job to do.  She didn't have time to think about the fact that she
and Brooke had gotten along smashingly that morning, she didn't have
time to think about the fact that she had seen the blonde smile more
at her in the past two days than the past few years.  She didn't have
time to think about the fact that she had had a dream about Brooke
again last night, and that when she woke up in the morning and
realized that the object of her lust was lying peacefully mere meters
away for her it had excited her so much that she had been forced to
take an agonizingly cold shower.  She didn't have time to think about
the fact, that she and Brooke had actually talked on the bus as they
drove from site to site, and that Sam had enjoyed talking with her,
finding her conversation to be smart, and amusing.  Sam didn't have
time to think about these things, but that didn't stop her from
thinking about them anyway.</p>

<p>Finally locating the Pollack exhibit Sam hurriedly made her way to the
janitorial closet across the hall from it.  Seeing the door slightly
ajar she tilted her head up and sent a silent thank you to the man
upstairs for the fact that her contact hadn't been spooked away when
she failed to arrive on time.  Clutching her shoulder bag closer to
her she rapidly walked over to the door, this was the type of story
that became notorious in a school's history, if Arabian Knight
presented her with the information she thought he would, she would go
down in Kennedy High history.  Plus, it would look really good on her
University application.</p>

<p>Stepping into the closet she closed the door behind her silently.  Her
heart was racing, this was so cool.</p>

<p>"Arabian Knight?" she called out, "it's Persephone," she continued
walking a bit further into the room.</p>

<p>"Over here," a voice returned.  It was the same voice she had heard
over the phone, Sam smiled to herself.  Suddenly and light flicked on,
Sam squinted and covered her eyes with her hand until her eyes
adjusted to the light.</p>

<p>"I can't see you," she said moving her head around.</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry, my bad," Arabian Knight responded directing the light so
that it was no longer shining directly in Sam's eyes.</p>

<p>"No problem," Sam responded mildly as the spots that were dancing in
front of her eyes began to disappear.  "Did you bring the stuff?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Arabian Knight responded rather indignantly.  "Would I be
here if I didn't?" </p>

<p>"Good," Sam responded.  "Shall we get on with this then?" she asked
opening up her shoulder bag and producing a notebook.</p>

<p>"Yes, let's" Arabian Knight said finally stepping out of the shadows
as he walked towards Sam.  The brunette gasped as she got her first
look at him, then stared as he continued towards her.  "What?" he
asked peevishly, self-consciously running a hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" Sam asked suspiciously getting a painful feeling in
the pit of her stomach.</p>

<p>"I told you I'm seventeen," Arabian Knight responded straightening his
back and puffing her chest forward.  Sam merely raised an eyebrow at
him, it was clear to him that she did not believe him.  "Thirteen," he
said deflating somewhat, "but I can help you," he continued quickly.
"I knew you wouldn't talk to me if you knew how young I was, but I
have information that needs to be spread and I knew that you could do
it."</p>

<p>"Does your mother know you're out?" Sam asked, as she pictured an
irate mother busting into the room and battering her over the head
while yelling about how Sam was trying to corrupt her baby.  She
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Pokemon opened today," Arabian Knight responded, "I'm good for at
least another hour and a half," he continued smiling.  "Not bad, huh?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Sam rolled her eyes.  Pokemon, oh lord.  "Let's just get on with this,
what have you got for me?" she asked wanting to get out of there as
fast as possible.</p>

<p>"Information that'll change the way school cafeteria's operate from
here to Miami," he responded placing a folder down on an overturned
box.  "Information that will shock and alarm you.  Something that will
make you question everything you ever thought you knew.  Something
that…"</p>

<p>"You do not want to finish that," Sam said holding up her hands.
"This isn't a rhetoric exam, just tell me what you know." </p>

<p>"Okay," Arabian said, but Sam could tell that he was disappointed she
had interrupted his little speech.  Oh, well, c'est la vie.  "The
information I have for you will unquestionably prove that school
cafeteria's all over the country, have for the past year been using
chemicals pilfered from school chemistry classes to artificially
enhance the products served for lunch in an attempt to reduce
spending.  And, that this disturbing trend was started by one Bobby
'Bio' Glass, at a school I think you are very familiar with," he
concluded with a smile.  "Take a look at this," he continued opening
up the folder he had been carrying with him.</p>

<p>Sam looked down at the pieces of paper then back up at him and smiled.
She had hit the jackpot and she was going to ride it all the way.</p>

<p>"Leave her," Nicole stated emphasizing each of her words clearfully,
"you'll be doing us all a favor.  Rose petals and doves await
you…besides, don't feel bad, Spam'll fit in perfectly with the freaks
and fringe loners that inhabit the city.  You'll be helping her out,
finally she will have found her people," Nicole continued trying to
guide Brooke towards the exit of the Museum.  She wanted to get back
to the Plaza, "Shakespeare in Love" was coming on Cinemax.</p>

<p>"I won't be able get on the bus, we have to sign in at the same time,"
Brooke responded craning her head back around trying to catch some
glimpse of Sam.  "Don't worry, you go, I'll find her and meet you
outside," Brooke said removing her arm from Nicole's grasp.</p>

<p>Upon extracting herself from Nicole's sphere of influence Brooke
looked around her trying to figure out what direction she had seen Sam
go off in.  Finally, she just settled on left and started to head in
that direction, she hadn't passed the Pollack exhibit or the Etching
demonstration so she decided that she should start with those places.
 Stopping on the ramp that would take her to her first destination
Brooke carelessly turned the corner.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," the blonde exclaimed as she bumped into someone.  Her
hands immediately stretching out as she tried to steady whoever it was
she had just crashed into.</p>

<p>"I'm o…Brooke?" Sam asked, uncomfortably aware of Brooke's hands
brushing over her body.</p>

<p>"Oh it's you," Brooke said finally focusing on Sam for the first time.
 "I've been looking for you."</p>

<p>"You have?" Sam asked rather incredulously before she had to time to
think better of it.  "I mean, you have," she corrected herself, her
tone far more civil.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I have," Brooke responded shaking her head.  "It's time to go,
Glass is going to flip.  We were suppose to be out there about five
minutes ago," Brooke continued subtly trying to usher Sam towards the
exit.  Sam looked down at her watch, surprise covering her feature.</p>

<p>"I didn't realize…"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, time flies when you're having fun," Brooke muttered as
she continued to gently shove Sam towards the door.  "By the way your
bags open," she added distractedly as she concerned herself with
whether it would be faster to go left or right.</p>

<p>"Wha…" Sam began looking down at her bag.  "Uh no," she muttered her
face screwing up in frustration.  "I can't believe I left it behind,"
she continued stopping dead in tracks and turning around.</p>

<p>"Whoa, where do you think you're going?" Brooke asked hurriedly making
an about face.</p>

<p>"I forgot something," Sam mumbled as she hurriedly made her way
through the crowd.  "You go ahead, I'll find my way back to the
hotel," she said turning around to face Brooke before returning her
focus forward.</p>

<p>"I can't get on the bus unless you're there," Brooke said catching up
to Sam and placing her hand on her shoulder halting her progress.  </p>

<p>"I have to go get it," Sam said.  "Glass will let you on, just say
that you couldn't find me.  Nobody'll blame you," she continued before
working herself out of Brooke's grasp and continuing back down the
hall.</p>

<p>Once again Brooke quickened her step to catch up with Sam.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Sam asked turning her head to the side as Brooke
began to power walk beside her.</p>

<p>"I'm coming with you," Brooke responded meeting Sam's eyes.</p>

<p>"Why?" Sam asked genuinely confused.</p>

<p>"Because I'm not going to leave you to wonder around by yourself at
night to be raped or murdered by some psycho," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>Sam stopped and turned to look at Brooke, her mouth opened and closed
a couple of times but no words came out of her for the first few
seconds.  "I…you don't have to," she said chickening out before she
even got started.  She had planned on expressing surprise and
gratitude for Brooke's concern with her safety, but that didn't end up
happening.</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke replied meeting her gaze.  She stared at Sam for a
second longer, then gave a short little laugh as she shook her head.
"Well?"</p>

<p>"This way," Sam said and with that they wondered off back into the
depths of the Museum. </p>

<p>Sam extended her hand managing to both whack Brooke in the chest and
halt her progress.  Brooke looked down at the spot Sam had hit and
made a face barely registering the brunette's mumbled "janitor" and
she rubbed her now sore spot.  Trying to distract herself, Brooke
looked up and watched as Sam's head bobbed around the corner as she
spied on the janitors movements while muttering to herself about
something or the other.  Looking back down again Brooke suppose she
should be grateful Sam hadn't landed her blow a few centimeters lower.</p>

<p>"Come on," Sam whispered to Brooke as she crept out from behind the
wall they had been hiding behind.  The halls of the museum were
practically empty and even the soft sounds of their feet scuffling
along the floor reverberated against the walls.</p>

<p>Brooke looked around her in something close to wonder, the place
seemed grander in the silence, she felt more humbled.  She thought
that she would have liked visiting museums much more if they were
always like this.</p>

<p>"In here," Sam said, hesitating for a moment before finally reaching
out and taking Brooke's hand into hers.  The blonde seemed distracted
and she had to get her attention somehow.  Brooke looked over at her
immediately after their hands touched, her gaze dropping to their
conjoined hands for a moment before she began to walk in the direction
Sam was facing.  To the brunette's surprise, and pleasure Brooke made
no effort to remove her hand from Sam's once they began to walk again,
and by some silent accord Sam made no effort to let go of Brooke's
either.</p>

<p>As Sam stopped in front of a janitorial closet Brooke looked over at
her simultaneously smiling and rising a questioning eyebrow.  It was a
look that said "what the hell" but in a sleazy, porn director kind of
way.</p>

<p>"Shut up Brooke," Sam muttered as she opened the door and slipped
inside.  Brooke followed behind her letting the door close as they
became submerged in darkness.  "There's a light over here somewhere,"
Sam said stepping away from the door.  A minute - and a couple of
bumps and colourful phrases - later Sam turned on the light and the
room was covered in a dim yellow glow.</p>

<p>Sam quickly made her way over to the overturned box which had served
as Arabian Knights desk, dropping down and crouching over it as she
got there.  "Shit," she muttered as she looked around the box with no
luck.  She wondered if maybe the janitor had found the fallen folder
while he was in there, but then her eye caught something just over to
the left.  Reaching out, she closed her eyes let out a relieved sigh,
it was still there.  Picking up the folder and smiling she turned
around to face Brooke who was watching her with a curious but patient
expression.  If she hadn't have just found the folder on the floor she
would have brought it to her lips and given it a big kiss.  As if was,
as the wave of euphoria rushed through her body she had to struggle
not to yell 'yes!' pump her fists in the air and give Brooke a big
hug.</p>

<p>"We can go now," is what she said however.</p>

<p>"Good," Brooke said turning around and reaching for the door knob.</p>

<p>"Come on, I thought you were in a hurry," Sam said a moment later as
she walked up behind Brooke who still hadn't opened the door.</p>

<p>Brooke turned around to face Sam, her features were drawn and she was
blinking rapidly.  "The door's locked," she stated.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"The door.  It's locked," Brooke repeated her left eye twitching
slightly.</p>

<p>"It can't be," Sam responded pushing past Brooke and reaching for the
handle herself.  She turned it and pushed.  Nothing happened.  She
tried it again to the same effect.  "The door's locked," she said
softly a second later.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I covered that," Brooke responded.  "Not that I'm trying to
usurp control or anything, but I've rapidly come to the conclusion
that secrecy is no longer our friend, and that if we want to get out
of here we better start yelling like now," she finished still watching
Sam.</p>

<p>"I concur," Sam replied immediately.  "After you," she said waving her
hand graciously.</p>

<p>Brooke nodded her head and opened her mouth to begin screaming like a
baby in any enclosed space when the light in the hall outside the door
suddenly went out.  She turned her head to look at Sam, in moments of
crisis like this it was always good to consult with others.  They
stared at each other for a second then they both flung themselves at
the door and began banging on it and screaming for all they were
worth.</p>

</table>

<p>Brooke slumped back against the door and let herself slid to the
ground with a soft sigh.  They had been banging for over ten minutes
and nobody had come to let them out, leading Brooke to the conclusion
that there was nobody there to let them out, and that there probably
wouldn't be until morning.  The walls of the closet were thick and
Brooke could tell from the way their voices were being absorbed by
them next to none of the noise they were making was getting beyond the
door.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke said softly.  "Just stop," she went on.  "Nobody's out
there, sit down."</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to come by," Sam insisted even though she sunk to the
ground joining Brooke.  "A security guard or something."</p>

<p>"If one walks by we'll hear and start yelling again, but I'm not up
for continuous yelling for the rest of the night.  Doing it or hearing
it," Brooke responded tilting her head back and rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"So what are we supposed to do?" Sam asked as she focused on a rickety
looking shelving unit at the back of the closet.</p>

<p>"The way I see it we have to options.  We can sit here in silence
until someone finds us, or we can talk," Brooke replied turning to
look over at Sam.  "You indicated yesterday that you weren't totally
averse to the idea of conversing with me in a non-combative manner, so
now's our chance," she finished.</p>

<p>Sam removed her gaze from the shelving unit and turned to watch Brooke
watch her.  She was beautiful the dim light of a dusty museum
janitorial closet, Sam decided as she watched the blonde.  "What do
you want to talk about?" the brunette asked finally.  "Herman
Melville's condemnation of consumer society?"</p>

<p>Brooke smiled but shook her head.  "Actually, I was wondering how I
ended up getting trapped in here," she responded pointedly looking at
the manila folder that was now lying in Sam's lap.</p>

<p>"This could take a while," Sam said softly as she traced her finger
around the edge of the folder.  She never talked about pieces she was
working on before she had finished them, it was one of her unwritten
rules.  To break it, for Brooke - even if she did owe the girl an
explanation - would be a big step, a leap of trust as it were.</p>

<p>"If there's one thing we've got," Brooke replied watching Sam fiddle
with the folder.</p>

<p>"About a month ago I was in one of the chat rooms on…." Sam began.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to tell you sir…ma'am, sir, ma'am sir….ah, I really
don't know what to tell you," the man stuttered looking at Bio Glass
in stupification.  "We cleared the museum out over half an hour ago,
your girls aren't in there."</p>

<p>"You're an Arts major aren't you?"  Glass asked suspiciously as she
watched the little man suffer.  "Ah, ah, ah, don't speak.  Look," she
said pointing to the line of Kennedy students lined up against the
bus.  "There, what do you see there?" she asked pointing to a gaping
whole in the line.</p>

<p>"Nnnothing," the man stuttered.</p>

<p>"Exactly, that gaping void is where *snap* McPherson and *snap*
McQueen should be," Glass replied moving closer to him so that she was
now carrying out a full on invasion of his personal space.  "Do you
know why they aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Mmmight, might I suggest ma'am, sir, ma'am, si…might I suggest that
they walked down the street to see Nsync at Radio City," he managed to
emote, though it was quite a struggle.</p>

<p>The students lined up against the bus cringed as they heard this,
cowering slightly and shielding their eyes.  He should not have said
that.</p>

<p>"Are you serious?" Sam asked barely able to control the laughter that
was bubbling up inside of her.  The visuals she was getting from
Brooke's story were almost too much for even her not to bust out
laughing at.  </p>

<p>"Perfectly," Brooke responded smiling.  "Raspberry Kool-aid.  I had
seen them do it on some show, probably Saved by The Bell or something
equally retarded.  The minute Dad saw it he made me march up stairs
and was it out of my hair…but I'm telling you, for about half an hour
there I was a living legend.  Gem never looked so good," she continued
smiling broadly.</p>

<p>Sam smiled back at her contentedly.  "You know what I always wanted?"
Sam started in rather wistful tone.  "A tree house.  In like every
family show or children's novel they always had these kids in
tree-houses.  It was like a staple of American society and I always
resented not having one."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you build one?" Brooke asked curiously, tilting her head
to observe Sam.</p>

<p>"Where?" Sam asked.  "One of the palm trees at the beach?" she
continued.  "That's another thing.  Have you ever been skiing?  I
always wanted to go skiing.  Snow, and Yule logs and eggnog around a
fire are more staples."</p>

<p>"We should go to Colorado for Christmas this year," Brooke replied
thoughtfully.  She could picture Sam all bundled up, holding a cup of
hot something-or-the-other while being bathed in gentle glow of a
fire.  The image made something flutter inside of her, gave her a
warm, happy feeling.  "There's enough snow there for a life time of
memories," she continued before pausing for a moment, then smiling.
"I'll teach you what a snow job is."</p>

<p>"Nice try," Sam said shooting Brooke an exasperated look, "but I've
heard of those."  Brooke shrugged her shoulders in defeat.  "Aspen?"
Sam asked a second later.</p>

<p>"Where else?" Brooke asked in a way that gave Sam the distinct
impression that she wasn't joking.  To her surprise, and if she were
honest to her amusement, she discovered that she found it inordinately
cute.</p>

<p>"You're such a preppy," was what she said in response however as she
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Back to your tree house," Brooke said deciding to get the subject off
of her preppiness before they ended up bitching at each other again,
"there were other options you know."  She was enjoying talking to Sam,
in fact she was enjoying talking to Sam more than she had enjoyed
talking to anyone in a long time and she didn't want the mood in the
room to shift.  She found that being trapped in the closet lead to a
pleasant fiction, a story where she and Sam were friends.  She liked
it.</p>

<p>"Such as?" Sam asked looking at Brooke expectantly.</p>

<p>"Cardboard boxes, they're always good, sometimes even better than what
came inside of them.  My personal preference was Maytag, very durable.
 You could have built yourself a small village," Brooke responded, a
nostalgic smile spreading across her face as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Did your Dad suddenly come into money a few years or something?" Sam
asked smiling at Brooke cheekily.  Truthfully she had never pictured
Brooke as a cardboard box kind of girl, she had always kind of assumed
that Brooke would have been one of those My Little Ponies, or Barbie
girls, with the house and pink convertible.  In fact, the longer they
talked the more Sam realized that she hardly knew anything about
Brooke, but that the more she found out the more she liked.</p>

<p>"Very funny," Brooke responded although she didn't seem particularly
amused.  "Even preppies have to make do sometimes," she continued
sighing a bit.  </p>

<p>"I didn't mean that in a bad way," Sam said noticing the Brooke's
defeated tone.  "It's actually kind of," she began to say but she
stopped herself.  The truth was she found Brooke's sporadic displays
of preppiness to amazing cute, but she had just begun to be able to
admit that to herself and there wasn't anyway in hell that she was
going to tell Brooke.</p>

<p>"Kind of what?" Brooke asked turning to face Sam, a look of curiosity
covering her features.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam responded shifting uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Come on Sam…Sammy," Brooke began testing the nickname out and
deciding that she liked it.  "You can't just 'nothing' that.  You were
far beyond the 'nothing' line, you've gotta tell," Brooke teased as
she bobbed her body around excitedly.</p>

<p>"You pulled that rule outta your ass rather quickly," Sam replied,
still shifting about.  "I think we've discovered your superpower: the
ability to produce copious amounts of bull-shit is a single bound." </p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, then turned away from Sam before
lulling her head to the side and muttering resignedly, "And we were
getting along so well."</p>

<p>Sam turned to watch the blonde after she spoke, the silence that now
covered the room ringing in her ears painfully.  She hadn't intended
to, she didn't really want, she had only meant to…she had screwed up
and she knew it.  "I'm sorry," she said finally.  She didn't want
things to end like that because Brooke was right, they had been
getting along so well.</p>

<p>"Are you?  Really?" Brooke asked wearily turning to face her.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded softly but adamantly.  "It's a coping mechanism,
I didn't mean it."</p>

<p>"I don't either, those things I've said to you…I never really meant
them, it was just a reaction.  I never hated you, in fact," Brooke
paused there gathering courage, "in fact I always kinda found you
interesting."</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked, her surprise showing in her voice.  Brooke
McQueen had always kind of found her interesting, that was new, new
and greatly appreciated.  The reality of the situation was that with
what had happened since they had come into the closet, and with the
way Sam was feeling, she knew she wouldn't have been able to keep up
her façade of  Brooke hating for much longer.  But, if Brooke found
her interesting, that meant that there was a chance that this truce
they had entered into could be continued, and Sam would take being
Brooke's friend over being nothing but a nuisance to the girl any day.</p>

<p>"Amazingly," Brooke replied.  It was now her turn to shift
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"We should have done this before.  Talked I mean," Sam said as she
leaned her head back to rest against the door.</p>

<p>"Why didn't we?" Brooke asked.  Sam wasn't sure whether the question
was asked rhetorically or not, but she had an answer, and after
Brooke's little revelation she decided it would only be far to share
it.</p>

<p>"I think I know," Sam replied, her voice threaded with mystery.</p>

<p>"Don't be a drama queen.  Spill it," Brooke responded lazily turning
her head to face Sam.</p>

<p>"You're a bit of a gossip aren't you?" Sam asked.  "Anyway, I think
the reason was that I feared that if I got to know you I would like
you, and if I liked you I wouldn't have been able to actively hate
you, and if I was forced to stop viewing you as Satan the world as I
knew it would have collapsed in on itself, leaving me broken and
bewildered.  Outfits I would rather not have worn." </p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, contemplative before finally saying,
"You say the sweetest things."   She then looked down at her lap where
her attention remained focused for a few moments before continuing
with, "but seriously, I'm glad that you've gotten past the actively
hating thing.  Besides, red has never really been my colour."  </p>

<p>They sat in silence for a long time after that, both watching each
other covertly until Brooke finally broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me now?"</p>

<p>"Tell you what?" Sam asked looking over at the cheerleader.</p>

<p>"What you find my preppiness to be kind of.  I know you thought that
you had distracted me with your charm, and I admit that telling
someone you no longer consider them to be a creature of pure evil
would have worked on most mere mortals, but I'm on to you," Brooke
answered meeting Sam's gaze.</p>

<p>"No."  And Sam said no more than that.  She knew that the subject was
a slippery slope and she was just willing to take a slid.  Brooke was
just going to have to get over it.</p>

<p>"Fine," Brooke responded with a sniff.  "I'm just going to read your
boyfriends notes then…to give you time to reflect on your
anti-socialness," she continued reaching out and picking up the manila
folder which had been resting beside Sam.  Placing it on her lap she
opened it up and licked the tip of her index finger before she began
to leaf through the sheets of paper.</p>

<p>"He's not my boyfriend," Sam muttered as she watched Brooke take
possession of her notes.</p>

<p>"You really should be ashamed of yourself.  I know that younger men
are in these days but, really," Brooke responded shaking her head
sadly.  "Sammy,"  she added shaking it some more to make sure she got
her point across.</p>

<p>"Shut up."</p>

<p>"Give me your notes so I can piece this conspiracy together," Brooke
said holding out her hand.  </p>

<p>"I could make you some Cliff Notes if you're having problems," Sam
replied saucily.  Despite that however she handed her notes over
willing to do most anything to get Brooke not to question her about
her feelings on Brooke's preppiness anymore.</p>

<p>"Ha!  Oh, wait, no," Brooke responded as she accepted the papers from
Sam.  "You know, you don't look like you're reflecting to me," she
commented a moment later.  Sam gave her the stink eye and Brooke
shrugged, oh well.</p>

<p>"Oooooh, now this is what I'm talking about!" Brooke exclaimed
excitedly in a somewhat sing song voice.  As she ran her eyes over the
paper sitting in her lap.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked looking over at her curiously.  Brooke had been
quiet for the better part of twenty minutes as she flipped through
Sam's notes.  Occasionally she had asked her a question or two but for
the most part she had been keeping herself busy, leaving Sam ample
time to take in their quaint surrounds and to practice not staring at
Brooke.</p>

<p>Brooked smiled and looked down at the piece of paper she had just been
looking at.  "'I had the dream again last night'," she began grinning
as she read the words Sam had written.  "A very promising beginning,"
she continued winking at Sam.  In fact she was so caught up in the
excitement of possibly learning about some of Sam's naughty bits that
she didn't see the brunette's face immediately fall, or the pained
expression that settled on it soon after.</p>

<p>"Give that to me," Sam stated as she reached out for the piece of
paper.  Silently she cursed herself, how could see have been so
stupid.  That morning she had been so preoccupied with thoughts of
Brooke that she had taken a few free minutes after breakfast to write
her thoughts down in hopes that it would get them out of her head.
Once she had finished she had just shoved the paper in with the rest
of her stuff, the stuff she handed over to Brooke.</p>

<p>"Grabby, grabby," Brooke responded playfully as she stood up so that
Sam couldn't yank the paper out of her hand.  "Come on, it's not so
bad.  Maybe I'll tell you mine…since I'll know your in a minute."</p>

<p>"I'm serious Brooke, give it to me," Sam stated standing as well.  She
reached for the paper again but Brooke blocked her with her body,
turning her back to Sam using her free arm as blocker while held the
paper with her other arm as she read it.</p>

<p>Sam continued to struggle with Brooke, trying to find away around the
blonde's body so that she could get the paper back, but Brooke
determinedly blocked her again and again.  Still, Sam couldn't give
up, the thought of giving up and just letting Brooke read a diary
entry that she made wherein she talked, and talked, and talked about
the feelings she had for Brooke just wasn't an option for the
brunette.</p>

<p>"I'm…I finished," Brooke said finally lowering her arm and relaxing
her stance.  Immediately Sam yanked the paper out of her hand, and
they stood there watching each other.  "Do you really think I have
skin like silk?" Brooke asked finally.</p>

<p>Sam watched the blonde in a kind of stupor that was only broken when
Brooke spoke.  She heard the blonde's question, but it seemed distant,
like it was coming from far, far away.  She was having trouble
breathing.  Brooke had actually read the entire the entry, she had
read it all, she knew everything.  Sam turned and began to walk
towards the door.  She realized that there was no place to go, but she
knew that she had to at least separate herself from Brooke.  She
figured Brooke would probably be grateful for the distance.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Brooke said as Sam started to walk away, quickly moving behind
her and grabbing her gently by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why? So you can mock me some more?" Sam asked not turning around.
She could feel the sting of tears in her eyes but she wouldn't give
Brooke the satisfaction of seeing her cry.  She couldn't.</p>

<p>"I was just," Brooke started hopelessly.  "I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have," she continued trying to work through her jumbled up thoughts.
"We were having fun," she continued softly, her hands still resting on
Sam.  "I was just," she went on stroking Sam's shoulders
unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Please let go of me," Sam said interrupting Brooke's babbling, her
voice remaining calm through nothing more than will power.</p>

<p>"Do you really want me to?" Brooke asked.  She could feel the warmth
of Sam's skin through her shirt, she could feel it warming her hands,
and the scent of lavender, Sam's scent, had infiltrated her olfactory
senses.  She was hyper of everything that had to do with Sam, her
smell, her feel, her breathing.</p>

<p>"That's not funny," Sam responded.  She could feel herself beginning
to crumble, she needed Brooke to let her go.  She couldn't feel Brooke
against her and remain strong, remain standing.  She needed distance.</p>

<p>"It wasn't suppose to be," Brooke responded moving closer to Sam, so
that now she was almost pressed up against the brunette's back.  "Do
you?  Really want me to stop touching you?  Because I don't want to
stop."</p>

<p>"Brooke please," Sam said, she was begging, begging Brooke to stop
torturing her, to just let her go.  She was begging and she didn't
care because she was moments away from breaking down.  Why couldn't
Brooke have just freaked out like a normal person?  Why was she doing
this, teasing her with something she couldn't have?</p>

<p>"I'm serious Sam…Sammy," Brooke breathed out softly.  Still holding
onto Sam she moved around so that she was standing in front of the
brunette.  "Lately," she began again in her new position, her hand
slowly traveling up Sam's shoulder, "I've…what I mean is…ugh," she
sighed in frustration, and closed her eyes trying to pull herself
together.  She placed her hands on the sides of Sam's face, and dipped
her head slightly so that she was looking directly into Sam's big,
beautiful, brown eyes.  "You smell like lavender, when you're bored
you stick you tongue into your cheek and when you're excited her rub
your teeth with it.  You can write with both of your hands, and your
eyes have the most incredible little gold specks in them that
absolutely break my heart.  I know what you're feeling Sam, I know,"
Brooke said her voice cracking along the way.  "Because I'm feeling it
too."</p>

<p>Sam looked away, down at the dusty floor as Brooke finished speaking.
 Her face was wet, she hadn't even realized she had been crying.  She
was overwhelmed.  She had just heard everything she had ever dreamed
about hearing, but it didn't seem real, she wondered if her alarm
clock were about to off.  But then she felt it, warm fingers tilting
her head back up, forcing her to meet Brooke's equally teary gaze.
She was confused, Brooke had never cried in her dreams.</p>

<p>They stayed like that for long moments, staring into each other eyes,
until finally Brooke impulsively leaned forward and softly, tenderly
pressed her lips against Sam's, drawing the brunette into her body as
their lips moved against each other.  Sam's body shook gently as she
felt Brooke's lips, tasted her for the first time.  Her hands wound
their way around Brooke's waist, clutching at her as the kiss deepened
and their bodies pressed closer together, their kiss becoming salty as
their tears ran down their faces.</p>

<p>Brooke watched as Sam's hand slowly made its way down from her
collarbone to the swell of  her breast where it then dipped down even
further cupping the soft mound of flesh through her shirt and
squeezing gently.  Brooke's breath hitched, her eyes momentarily
fluttering closed as Sam touched her, her own hand anxiously sneaking
its way under Sam's shirt reveling in the feeling of Sam's warm skin
pressed against her hand.  Slowly, her hand trailed upward, taking
Sam's shirt with it, until Brooke's hand reached the underside of
Sam's breast which she then began to delicately explore.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam breathed out softly as she looked down at the blonde's
face.  Somehow, though she wasn't exactly sure how, after Brooke had
kissed her they had ended up falling down to the ground, Sam sitting
on Brooke's lap, straddling her.  That had been about fifteen minutes
ago, and since then they hadn't spoken a word to each other, their
only communication coming through the tiny sounds that they emitted
and the looks and touches that they exchanged.  But it had all come
so suddenly, and Sam was beginning to wonder if it was real, because
it seemed almost to good to be true; she needed Brooke to speak to
her, to tell her that this was actually happening.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes parted though they remained slightly hooded as she
raised her head up so that she could see Sam's face.  Brooke lifted
the hand that wasn't still under Sam's shirt to the brunette's face,
stroking her cheek softly with her thumb as a tender smile spread
across her lips.</p>

<p>"We need to talk," Sam said as she leaned into Brooke's touch.  To
her surprise the smile and Brooke's face only grew, her eyes
crinkling in the most adorable way as she continued to gaze at Sam.</p>

<p>"I think," the blonde finally said, shifting her position a bit so
that her face was closer to Sam's – a maneuver that was far more
complicated than it would seem at first since Sam was sitting on her –
 "that would be a…prudent course of action," she continued still
staring at Sam.</p>

<p>Sam nodded, but she was finding it very difficult to
concentrate.  "We should probably stop touching each other," she said
finally locating the source of her distraction.  Brooke looked away
for a moment, her eyes rolling up in head as if she were in deep
thought, and for a second Sam thought that she might protest, but the
blonde lowered her gaze a moment later watching as she extracted her
hand from Sam's shirt. </p>

<p>"That's better," Sam declared, "this will be much more helpful to the
talking."</p>

<p>Brooke, in response, raised her eyebrow at Sam, then looked down at
her lap while clearing her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh right," Sam muttered raising herself up and off of Brooke so that
she was sitting on the floor beside the blonde.  There they sat
together in an increasingly uncomfortable silence until finally Sam
spoke again – to both of their great relief.</p>

<p>"So," Sam started, but apparently she hadn't thought ahead very far
because she didn't add anything to that expect for an awkward head
bob.</p>

<p>"So," Brooke repeated in an equally uncomfortable fashion.  "We've
never done THAT before," she continued wincing as the words came out
of her mouth.  She didn't think that she could have been any lamer if
she had actually put effort into it.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam agreed, "the hand up the shirt was new," she continued
shaking her head.  If things continued like this she figured that the
rest of their stay in the closet was going to seem, very, very, very,
long.</p>

<p>Brooke looked over at her when she said that, an expression of worry
marring her features.  The blonde reached over and took her
hand.  "Sam," she started very seriously.  "despite the fondling, I
just totally want you to know that I respect you…you know as a
person, and not just as…"</p>

<p>"A sex-monkey?" Sam supplied helpfully.</p>

<p>"First I would like to say that that just gave me a very disturbing
visual," Brooke responded making a face, "and secondly, well yeah,"
she continued shrugging her shoulders rather helplessly.  "Not that
you're not sex-monkey material, I mean your totally sex-monkey
material, just not to me…not that I don't think of you in that way,
because, well, the fondling, just I wouldn't use the term sex-monkey,
because…"</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked interrupting the cheerleaders babbling.  "I get
it," she continued as a smile played across her lips.  She was beyond
charmed by the little display and it showed on her face.</p>

<p>"Good, cause I was starting to confuse myself," Brooke admitted
shaking her head ruefully.  "We're going to have to talk more than
this aren't we?" she asked a moment later as she turned to face Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded noticing with a touch of amusement how Brooke's
face fell, a pout forming on lips Sam now knew to be delicious.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have to tell you mine now aren't I?" Brooke asked
remembering how she had taunted Sam earlier.  Damn, she knew Sam was
going to make her pay for that, but impulse control hadn't been her
strongest attribute lately, so she decided that she shouldn't really
have been surprised that she did it anyway.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded smiling happily.  She planned on making Brooke
pay for taunting her earlier.  The cheerleader really should have
known better.</p>

<p>"You're not going to let me kiss you again until I tell you, are
you?" Brooke asked barely managing to keep her voice from sounding as
whiny as she was feeling.</p>

<p>"'Fraid not," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Great," Brooke responded resigning herself to her fate.  "Are you
comfortable?  This could take a while."</p>

<p>"Not yet," Sam answered shifting a bit closer to Brooke and resting
her head on the blonde's shoulder.  "Now I'm good."</p>

<p>"Great," Brooke muttered.  "Where should I start?"</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Sam began thoughtfully.  "How about you tell me about the
time you first realized that you wanted my body," she suggested
happily a moment later.  Brooke sighed, this was going to be fun.</p>

<p>Sam held Brooke's open palm in her hand, cradling the delicate
appendage as she traced the lines of the blonde's hand gently, her
finger practically hovering, barely grazing the flash beneath it.  Sam
could feel Brooke's eyes on her as the cheerleader silently watched
her; she liked the feeling, it sent a hum of excitement through her
body, warmed her over to feel Brooke's eyes on her, burning into her.
 She looked up meeting the blonde's clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You have the most delicate hands," Sam said softly, her voice holding
a touch of wonder.  "Looking at them, I feel like I could break them,
but," as she said that Brooke moved her hand firmly grasping Sam's in
her own, taking it captive, "they're so strong," Sam continued a small
smile playing across her lips.  "I wonder…"</p>

<p>"You wonder what?" Brooke asked maintaining her hold on Sam's hand,
stroking it absently as she waited for the journalist's response.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the same applies to the rest of you," Sam answered after
a moments hesitation.  Brooke didn't respond right away, instead she
dropped her gaze down to their joined hands, watching her own as they
moved across Sam's skin.</p>

<p>"I don't know the answer to that," the cheerleader responded softly as
she raised to eyes to meet Sam's once again.  "Maybe," she continued
dipping her head shyly, "maybe you'll help me find out."</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked genuinely curious.  She had just spent the last
fifteen minutes listening to Brooke tell her that at some point she
had realized that her feelings for Sam had become more than sisterly,
and that she had been rather alarmed by the development at first and
tried to deny it, but that recently - said with a impish smile - she
had become more comfortable with the way she was feeling.  But even
after listening to Brooke, Sam still wasn't really sure about anything
other than the fact that Brooke found her as attractive as she found
Brooke.</p>

<p>"I was being serious when I said you were more than a sex-monkey to
me," Brooke said in a semi-serious tone, trying to keep the situation
light but also convey to Sam the fact that she did want more than just
someone to release stress with.  "I'm not going to lie and tell you
that I know with absolute certainty what's going inside of me, but I
can tell you that I have feelings for you that are more than skin
deep, and that I want to know what it is we could have together-if
anything-because I think that this could be something special," she
finished watching Sam intently.  "If you want that that is," she added
suddenly, her brows drawing together.  "I mean you never said…if you
just…"</p>

<p>"Wanted a sex-monkey?" Sam offered helpfully.</p>

<p>"That term is going to be with us for a while isn't it?" Brooke asked
rhetorically before shaking her head and focusing back on Sam.  "But
yeah."</p>

<p>"What if that was all that I wanted?" Sam asked watching Brooke
carefully.</p>

<p>"Then," Brooke said pausing.  Sam could she her eyes shifting around
as she thought and found herself wondering what was going on in the
beautiful head.  "I'd let you," Brooke finally said.</p>

<p>"But you said…why?" Sam asked placing her hand on top of Brooke's,
repossessing the blonde's hand as her own.</p>

<p>"Because, because I'd rather have you for a little while than not at
all," Brooke replied haltingly, as if the words that were coming out
of her mouth were a revelation even to her.  "Certainly it wouldn't be
the great follow-up to my last relationship that I was looking for
but…" she left the sentence hanging.  "Is that?  What you want I mean.
 Purely physical?"  she asked in a tone that Sam couldn't quite
decipher.  "In your dreams was I your sex-monkey?"</p>

<p>"No," Sam said shifting closer to Brooke.  "And that's not what I
wanted, want or would possibly want in the future," she continued
looking right into Brooke's eyes, stressing each and every word so
that there could be no doubt whatsoever as to the sincerity of her
words.</p>

<p>"So what does this mean?" Brooke asked relieved to hear that Sam was
interested in more than just her body, because frankly while she was
certain she would have given it to the brunette she wanted more than
just that and she knew she never would have been happy if she'd had to
settle.  "That you and I are interested in each other as people."</p>

<p>"That we're now going steady?" Sam suggested.</p>

<p>"That would make you my girl," Brooke replied smiling, as if she was
testing out how the words would sound coming out of her mouth and
deciding that she liked it a lot.  "And if you're my girl," Brooke
continued still smiling, but instead of finishing her sentence she
leaned forward and pressed her lips against Sam's softly.  Sam then
leaned forward increasing the pressure and the intensity of their
kiss, her hands making their way up Brooke's body and behind her neck
and their lips crashed against each other again and again with a
growing hunger. </p>

<p>"I think," Sam said, still trying to catch her breath as they broke
apart.  "That I'm going to like being your girl," she continued as a
sexy grin spread across her lips.</p>

<p>"Good," Brooke replied.  "I'm glad we're agreed on this.  Now," she
said smiling herself, "I would like to request some more sugar,"  she
continued barely managing to get the words out before Sam took
possession of her lips once more.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Brooke asked feeling a slight shudder run through Sam's
body.  It was now just past three in the morning and the hustle and
bustle of the day was beginning to catch up with both of them.  Brooke
was leaned propped up against the door and a shelving unit and Sam was
sitting in-between her legs.  "Don't tell me your uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"I'm very comfortable," Sam responded, "in fact you're better than a
futon."</p>

<p>"That's lovely," Brooke responded glaring at the top of Sam's head.
"Are you cold?" she asked feeling another shiver run through Sam's
body.</p>

<p>"No, just thinking about how much shit we're going to be in when they
find us in the morning," Sam said shuddering once again.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that, but now I am, and…" Brooke shuddered too.
"They're going to call our parents.  You are going to be in so much
trouble," Brooke continued.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'me'?" Sam asked.  "As far as I'm aware I'm not the
only one is this room.  What about you?"</p>

<p>"I'll probably get an award for being such a concerned bus buddy and
following you into doom and misfortune," Brooke responded.  "The
school will probably create a new award just for me, the McQueen
Medallion or something more grandiose."</p>

<p>Sam paused for a second then said, "Now that you've had time to rejoin
me on the planet earth, what do you think is really going to happen?"
Sam asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"I'd prefer not to think about it if it's all the same to you," Brooke
replied as she ran her hands up and down Sam's arm lightly.  </p>

<p>Sam smirked then shifted up a little so that her lips were hovering by
Brooke's neck where she planted the gentlest of kisses.  Brooke leaned
her head down, capturing Sam's lips in an equally tender embrace.</p>

<p>"Sam," she said when they separated and Sam's head was once again
resting on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ummm," Sam mumbled.</p>

<p>"I sleepy," Brooke related blinking rapidly in an attempt to keep her
eyes open.</p>

<p>"Me too," Sam admitted with a sigh.  "I didn't get much sleep last
night."</p>

<p>"Hmph," Brooke emoted, surprisingly able to make even her grunts carry
a touch of amusement.  "I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," Sam muttered knowing exactly what Brooke was thinking.  </p>

<p>"Don't be grouchy, I'm sure that it was good for both of us," Brooke
continued smiling as she rested her head against Sam's.  The
brunette's response was merely to focus though brown orbs at her and
place an expression on her face that clearly said 'you're really gonna
wanna shut up now'.  Brooke smiled, she would shut up…but only because
Sam was her girl.</p>

<p>The Kennedy students silently trekked through the empty early morning
hallways of the Museum of Modern Art.  Brooke and Sam were still
missing and they had been woken up extra early but an especially surly
Bio Glass.  A security guard at the museum had gone over the tapes for
the museum and had found evidence of Sam and Brooke moving through the
museum about ten minutes before closing time, but had found no footage
of them at any of the exits which meant they were still in the museum
somewhere.  So, with that evidence in hand, Glass had dragged everyone
back to the museum to begin The Search for Spock…I mean, Brooke and
Sam.</p>

<p>"We've checked all of the washroom and closets on the first floor,"
Security guard Bob was saying to Bio as they all marched through the
hallways.  "Our next stop is on the second floor, the janitorial
closet by the Pollack exhibit.  If we don't have any luck there, there
are three washrooms, and a maintenance closet that still have to be
checked."</p>

<p>Bio simply snared at the man in response.</p>

<p>"In that case…here we are," Bob said fumbling with his keys, not
ashamed to admit that the teacher to his side was terrifying him more
than any person he had ever meet before in life.  "Let's just open
this up and…"  Security guard Bob jumped back slightly as the door
flew open.  Out of the doorway rolled two girls, one blonde and one
brunette.  "Huh, looks like we found your…" but he was interrupted by
a shrill shrieking sound originating from somewhere behind him.</p>

<p>"OH MAH GOD!" Mary Cherry yelled.  "She's killed Brookie!" the
southerner continued pointing at Sam who had rolled out of the closet
on top of Brooke and was the first of the two of them to begin to wake
up.  "With those damn dirty whore hands of hers she has strangled the
life out of our dear precious one," Mary Cherry continued as tears ran
down her face leaving mascara trails in their wake.</p>

<p>"What the…" Sam muttered beyond disoriented, however despite that
having the presence of mind to roll off of a now waking up Brooke and
into a sitting position beside her before anymore could verbally
wonder what the hell she was doing on top of Brooke in the first
place.</p>

<p>Brooke raised her hand to her face and rubbed at her eyes sleepily.
What a freaky dream she had been having, she was Kenny from South Park
and Mary Cherry was yelling at some unfortunate soul accusing them of
murder.  Brooke shook her head as she forced her eyes open, that was a
damn weird dream.  Stretching, she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ahhhhhhh!" the cheerleader screamed bolting upright and scrambling to
her feet in a panic.  Upon opening her eyes she was greeted to the
sight of a scowling Bio Glass whacking a ruler a against her hand.  An
image that was just too disturbing for words.</p>

<p>"Nice of you to join us McQueen," Glass said eyeing a now upright
Brooke like one of the worms they dissected in class.  "Now if you're
through demonstrating to the class that you do indeed wake up minty
fresh, we have more important matter to attend to," she went on
slapping the ruler against her hand once again.  Brooke shifted
uncomfortably and turned her attention to Sam who was of no help
whatsoever as she was involved in a detailed examination of her shoe.
 The cheerleader sighed, this was just going to be the best morning
ever!</p>
