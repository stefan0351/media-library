<p>"It wasn't so bad," Sam said as she lay back on the bed.  She was
absolutely exhausted.  After she and Brooke had been freed from the
closet, they had remained at the museum for a few more hours to
straighten things out with the curator, then it had been onto the bus
were they were verbally accosted by Bio Glass for the entire ride back
to the hotel.  That's when things got rough.  Upon arriving at the
hotel they were forced to call their parents and explain why they had
gotten a call the other night telling them that their daughters had
disappeared.  Following that very painful conversation Glass grounded
them confining them to the hotel where they were to remain as
punishment until further notice.  Following this announcement Brooke
had been dragged by a raging Nicole up to her suite while Carmen, Lily
and Harrison followed Sam to her room to badger her to death.</p>

<p>"What do you mean it wasn't so bad?" Carmen responded dropping onto
the bed and consequently shaking Sam about.  "You can't just say it
wasn't so bad and leave it at that.  You and Brooke were trapped in a
confined space for an extended period of time and nobody sustained
serious injury.  That's something, that's more than not so bad, that's
a freaking miracle," she continued her voice raising in excitement as
she went on.</p>

<p>"She's not so bad," Sam stated simply, trying to contain the smile the
mere mention of Brooke's name threatened to bring to her face.</p>

<p>"You once said that she was a creature of pure evil," Harrison pointed
out.  "You were so flustered that you said that she couldn't be any
eviler on the evilest day of the year if she had an electrified evil
machine," he continued snickering at the description.  That one had
had him in stitches for days.</p>

<p>"Not my finest moment," Sam replied calmly, so calmly in fact that she
was beginning to freak her friends out.  "Still, Brooke's alright."</p>

<p>"Okay, who are you and what have you done with Sam?" Lily observing
Sam suspiciously.  Sam could tell that she was suspicious because her
eyes narrowed and her lips thinned, and she started to look really
constipated.</p>

<p>"I'm Sam and nobody's done anything to Sam because being Sam I would
know if something happened to Sam, which it didn't cause I'm Sam and I
know that nothing happened to Sam…I mean me, I mean…well you know what
I mean," Sam responded her brows scrunching together as she tried to
make sense of her own sentence before she decided that she didn't
really care.</p>

<p>"Alright, we'll assume that you're not some sort of Sam-bot…for the
moment," Carmen began, "but the fact still remains that you and
Brooke, sworn enemies, the closest thing that I've ever seen in
real-life to comic book style arch enemies, are getting along.  You
were like Archie and Reggie, now you're like Betty and Veronica.  This
is strange, this demands an explanation, an explanation we are still
waiting for" she concluded.</p>

<p>"We just had nothing to do in there but talk," Sam responded with a
rather exasperated sigh.  "I mean, as much as I bitched about her it
wasn't like if given the opportunity I really would have gone all
medieval on her ass or something.  We just decided that it would be
better if we tried not aggravate each other, and that led to talking,
and talking led to the realization that our fighting was more
posturing than loathing, and that well we can get along pretty well
when we want to," she continued turning to survey them.  "Come on,
this isn't like learning that I'm a crime fighter by night, or that
Glory is god.  You guys should be happy, you always said I should give
her a chance, now I have and I'm admitting that she's not a demon
spawn.  You win, this is probably the only time you're going to hear
me speak those words, so absorb or inhale or revel or whatever."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Sam raised her head and looked around at them.</p>

<p>"What?" Carmen asked.  "We're reveling.  Look at us revel."  Sam
looked, but to her reveling looked an awful lot like sitting.</p>

<p>"Don't you three have a Disney movie cum-Broadway production to go get
dressed for?  The circle of life is quickly spiraling by it, and it'll
be a good two or four years, cause even numbers seem so much more
symmetrical, before it'll be back," was Sam's response.  It was funny,
she had only been away from Brooke for about an hour but it already
seemed like a life time.  This being the case, she wanted her
love-den…um, room to be free of interlopers when the apple of her eye
returned.</p>

<p>"She's right!" Lily exclaimed jumping up.  "We have to get ready.  I
have to prepare my notes," she continued tugging on Carmen's arm
trying to get her to stand up.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you'll be alright?" Harrison asked as he opened the door
just in time for an arriving Brooke to squeeze by him and into the
room.</p>

<p>"Positive," Sam responded watching as the blonde crossed in front of
her bed.</p>

<p>"Alright, we'll see you later then," he said stepping out of the door.
 "And ladies, please behave," he added before shutting the door and
taking off down the hall behind Lily and Carmen.</p>

<p>"Who knew having friends could be such a drag on one's social life?"
Brooke asked sighing dramatically as she flopped down onto the bed
next to Sam.  "I mean really, it's like they think I have nothing
better to do.  Of course as far as they know I did have nothing better
to do…but you and I know better don't we?" she continued turning her
head so that she was looking at Sam.</p>

<p>"How'd it go?" Sam asked smiling at Brooke fondly, she liked it when
Brooke was goofy like that, it made her eyes seem to twinkle and left
her mouth permanently unturned in the cutest way, like she couldn't
get enough of her own wit and charm.  It was an expression that Sam
would have found terribly narcissistic on anyone else, but that
disarmed her coming from Brooke.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so bad, I was verbally assaulted by Mary Cherry who was
somehow under the impression that my stay in the closet had damaged my
hearing and therefore felt the need to stand beside me and yell
directly into my ear whenever she spoke, and Nicole kept sniffing me
in a way that was really quite creepy muttering how she could smell
Spam on me, but other than that it went well I think," Brooke replied
as her eyes drifted to the ceiling.  "I got a manicure and a facial."</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Uh huh.  Apparently I deserved something extra special for the trauma
that I went through last night," Brooke responded grinning at Sam.
"And you know what they say about…something about gift mouths and
horses…" she went on trailing off as she became distracted by Sam's
smile and felt the need to watch it and be warmed.</p>

<p>"Actually," Sam said shifting forward so that she and Brooke were
lying pressed up against each other.  "The saying," she started
brushing her lips against Brooke's, "goes" she said before extending
her tongue and licking the blonde's bottom lip, "don't," she went on
arching her body against Brooke's teasingly, "look, a gift horse in
the mouth," she concluded before pressing her lips against Brooke's
drawing the blonde into a deep, passionate kiss that left them both
breathless.</p>

<p>"You know," Brooke started running her hand up Sam's side once they
broke away, "I'm pretty sure that I could mess up a few more sayings
if you'll correct me like that every time."  Her lips were now
hovering just in front of Sam's, the air between them filled with
electricity.  "There was something about there always being other fish
in your tea.  I always found that one strange."</p>

<p>"Sea, other fish in the sea," Sam corrected dipping her head down
where she trailed a line of kisses down Brooke's neck.</p>

<p>"That definitely makes more sense," Brooke responded in a half moan as
she leaned her head back to give Sam better access.  "What about that
one about education being the key to good dress?"</p>

<p>"Success," Sam whispered as her hand found it's way under Brooke's
shirt.  "Education is the key to success," she continued as she hand
explored the soft skin of Brooke's stomach while her lips returned to
work on her neck.</p>

<p>"And the early bird gets the perm?" Brooke asked her breath coming in
short gasps.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked as she nudged Brooke to the side and rolled on top
of her.  "Shut up," she continued before capturing taking the blonde's
willingly lips captive.</p>

<p>Sam sensuously extended her tongue, her eyes sparkling with unspoken
promise.  Keeping those eyes locked on Brooke's Sam then slowly
flicked her tongue upwards clearing a path on the strawberry Brooke
was holding which was otherwise covered in whip cream.  Brooke gasped
and Sam smiled wickedly, lowering her mouth once more to take the
entire strawberry in, sucking on it until every trace of whip cream
was removed.  Then she sumptuously bit down on the fruit, moaning
gratuitously as she chewed on it, leaving a gaping, shallow breathed
Brooke staring at her in wonder.</p>

<p>"That is like the most amazing thing I've even seen," Brooke managed
to chock out as she watched Sam lick her lips.</p>

<p>"This is much better than the Lion King isn't it?" Sam asked, a
playful yet sexy smile spreading across her face.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Brooke responded leaning forward and bringing their lips
together, the taste of strawberries mixed with Sam's natural flavor
sending a shiver through her body.  It truly amazed her what Sam was
able to do to her body, the feelings the brunette was able to inspire
in her.  When they weren't touching-which was very, very rarely-Brooke
was over taken by the need to write bad poetry about her, and it
excited Brooke to no end because she had never felt the need to write
bad poetry before and she liked the feeling.</p>

<p>Sam leaned back, falling against the mattress as Brooke leaned into
and then over her.  She could sense the blonde's excitement, feel her
body humming more and more as their embrace continued.  She felt
Brooke's hand make its way under her shirt and begin to slide up her
torso.  She body arched up, and anxiously she sought out Brooke's
lips, desperately needing to feel connected to her, to feel her
passion.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooked groaned dropping her down onto the brunette's shoulder,
"being this close to you is doing things to me."</p>

<p>"What kinds of things?" Sam asked as her hands ran up Brooke's sides
and across her back.</p>

<p>"Naughty things, I'm wanting to touch," Brooke responded raising her
head and looking down at Sam, "more and more of you," she continued
her eyes lowering to take in what was exposed of Sam's body.  "And I
know that we've just started to…explore what's happening between us,
and that things are progressing rather quickly, and that if I'm to
avoid an excruciating number of cold showers…"</p>

<p>"We should probably watch one of the ten dollar movies on Cinemax and
finish our dinner?" Sam interjected.</p>

<p>"Well, yeah, I mean to quote the great vocalist Monica 'I should make
a move but I won't, I know you're probably thinking something is
wrong, knowing if I do that it won't be right, I wanna get down, but
not the first night'" Brooke responded, her lip quivering it the
sweetest of ways as she recited the lyrics.  "I mean, I know lying on
top of you, groping you probably constitutes making a move, but the
rest of it…" she continued trailing off.</p>

<p>"The getting down part?" Sam asked watching Brooke carefully.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that part," Brooke replied meeting Sam's gaze.</p>

<p>"You don't wanna do that part?" Sam asked her eyes still trained on
Brooke but her face revealing nothing.</p>

<p>"No, I wanna do that part, I wanna do that part so much that I'm in
actual physical pain here.  I was just thinking that, we probably
shouldn't rush…."</p>

<p>"I know," Sam replied leaning forward and bringing her lips to
Brooke's softly.  "You're right, I was just playing with you…old
habits die hard you know," she continued grinning.  "And just so you
know," Sam continued as she extended her arm to the side groping
around for and then finding the remote, "I really, really wanna do
that part to."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled and rolled off of Sam, sighing and starring at the
ceiling.  "We're not watching anything with Steven Segal in it."</p>

<p>"Even when we were pretending to dislike each other I would never have
inflicted such a horror upon myself simply to torture you," Sam
responded flipping the television on with a smirk.  Brooke placed her
hands behind her head smiling herself while wondering why it had taken
her so long to realize that Sam was an original and utterly fantastic.</p>

<p>Sam sighed rolling her eyes dramatically before allowing her head to  flop down onto the table top with a dull thud.  Harrison, Lily and  Carmen were sitting around her badgering her, just like they had been  since breakfast.  She couldn't even find it amusing in an annoying  sort of way anymore she just wanted it to end.</p>

<p>"Oh my god, will you give it a rest already!" Sam finally said in a  highly exasperated tone.  "It's not that big of a deal.  I thought  that we already went through this."</p>

<p>"Bu…but that was before," Carmen sputtered.</p>

<p>"Before what?" Sam asked tiredly knowing that she didn't really want  to know.</p>

<p>"You, you, you, smiled at her," was Carmen's response.  "And you two  spoke in sentences where the word `bitch' wasn't used, not even  once.  You're really getting along.  Really," she went on sounding  more and more distressed as she continued.  "I…we…it…huh!?!"</p>

<p>"Oh good lord," Sam said pushing away from the table and standing  up.  "I'm going over there now," she said pointing vaguely to  somewhere on the other side of the room.  "I want none of you to join  me."</p>

<p> "She's not a witch," Brooke stated in an increasingly exasperated  tone. </p>

<p>"There's no other logical explanation for what's happened.  Don't be  so narrow minded Brookie, there are things in this world that just  can't be explained by anything other than dark occult forces, like  the popularity of Sabrina the Teenage Witch," Nicole responded  resting her elbows on the table and leaning towards Brooke  challengingly while Mary Cherry nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>

<p>"Really she's not that bad," Brooke said ignoring Nicole's  tirade.  "She's really smart, and funny, and if you don't provoke her  she can be really…"</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, are you hearing this?  My god, what has she done to you  Brookie?  Poor, sweet, simple Brooke," Nicole went on turning to Mary  Cherry.  "Her naive little mind just couldn't hold up against the she- demons constant assaults."</p>

<p>Brooke gaped at Nicole for a moment, truly shocked at the words that  were coming out of the blonde's mouth.  She may have been a lot of  things, but simple wasn't one of them.  Then as if that wasn't bad  enough Mary Cherry decided to add her fifty cents to the  conversation.  Finally Brooke just leaned back surveying the room  around them while Nicole and Mary Cherry discussed what a lost cause  she was and how they might be able to save her soul. </p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Nicole asked suddenly noticing Brooke push  back from the table and stand up.</p>

<p>"My master awaits," Brooke responded with a slight smile as she  turned and looked in the direction Sam had just taken off in.  "But  don't give up on me, you two seemed to be onto something a minute  ago."  </p>

<p>With that she walked over to Sam who had settled herself against the  side of one of the rooms pools tables.</p>

<p>"Do you play, or is it all about the look?" Brooke asked settling  next to Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm the real deal," Sam responded keeping her eyes trained on  something in the distance.</p>

<p>"Prove it," Brooke said moving off to the side and picking up two  pool cues.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can handle me," Sam said accepting the cue  nonetheless.</p>

<p>"We'll see," Brooke said softly raking her eyes over Sam  thoughtfully.  "Let's hope not."</p>

<p>Feeling herself start to flush under Brooke's heady eyes, Sam moved  to the other end of the table silently setting up the balls.  When  she was done she looked over to Brooke indicating that she could  break, then she stepped back from the table watching as Brooke slowed  leaned over the table, her eyes never leaving Sam's.</p>

<p>Sam jumped slightly, the sound of the balls scattering jarring her  out of her daze.  The thing she remembered was watching Brooke lick  her lips, before they parted slightly in preparation for her strike.   Focusing on Brooke again Sam saw her grinning at her mischievously.</p>

<p>"I'm solid," was all the blonde said, then she moved over to Sam's  side of the table brushing up against the brunette's back as she  walked past her.  "Six ball, corner pocket."</p>

<p>Lily ran a hand through her hair nervously as she eyed the girl  beside her.  She wasn't so sure about this.  It wasn't that she  really disagreed with Carmen's interpretation of the text, in fact  she fully agreed with it, it was just that what the taller girl was  proposing was kind of illegal.</p>

<p>"Carm, I'm not so sure about this," Lily said finally.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Harrison said pointing at Lily.  "See, she thinks you're  insane too.  I mean, I didn't really want to use the `i' word but,  well, somebody had to say it."</p>

<p>"Actually," Lily interjected.  "I kinda do agree with her.  I'm just  not to keen on the breaking and entering."</p>

<p>"You agree with her?" Harrison asked, his eyes widening.  "Come on  Lily, this is Brooke and Sam we're talking about.  They're not that  way.  I think that I know a little something about the lesbian way of  life, living with two of them and all, and I think I can safely say  that Brooke and Sam aren't," he went on.  "Trust me."</p>

<p>"This doesn't have anything to do with trust.  And it's not like  baldness, you can't just tell by looking at someone," Carmen  responded.  "And we're not doing anything wrong, we just have to get  Sam away from Brooke for a while so we can talk to her."</p>

<p>"I'm not doing it," Harrison said holding up his hands.  </p>

<p>"Lily?" Carmen asked looking at the smaller girl with an expression  that conveyed that either way she was going to go ahead with her plan.</p>

<p>"Okay," Lily said sighing.  She couldn't let Carmen go it alone, and  truthfully she didn't really want to miss out on what she was sure  was going to be a juicy conversation.</p>

<p> Mary Cherry turned around her full-length mirror once more carefully  studying her reflection.</p>

<p>"Nic," she asked turning around, her brows crunched together in  thought.  "Do theez pants make mah ass look big?"</p>

<p>Nicole sighed as she pulled on her DKNY leather all-purpose  gloves.  "No Mary Cherry, the fact that your ass is big makes your  ass look big."</p>

<p>Mary Cherry turned back to the mirror with a frown.  "Whah do yah haf  to be so cruel?"</p>

<p>"Come on, we've got a head cheerleader to save," Nicole said heading  for the door.  "It's going to be a dirty job," the short - haired  blonde said seriously, her hand hovering over the doorknob.  "And  we're lucky to be the ones to do it.  Now move!"</p>

<hr>

<p>Lily tugged at her ski mask for what had to have been the billionth  time in the three-minute time span it took her and Carmen to get from  their room to Sam's.  Slipping her hand underneath the woolly  material, she fully intended to rip it off of her face when she felt  a hand grasp hers.  Carmen was holding her hand with her left hand  while her right hand was raised up to her lips in the  universal `ssssh' gesture.  Lily sighed, as Carmen let go of her hand  and took a step back.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous!" She exclaimed only to have a hand clamped over  her mouth.  Wrenching Carmen's hand off of her face, Lily looked at  the taller girl rather peevishly.  "What are we doing?!" she  continued, this time in a softer voice.  "Look at us, we look like  rejects from I Spy!  Sam is our friend, we should just knock on the  door and…"</p>

<p>"Sssh," Carmen interjected putting up her hand.</p>

<p>"I don't think that that was necessary.  I was merely saying that…"  Lily tried to explain but Carmen interrupted her again.</p>

<p>"Sssh," the taller brunette repeated again.  "Listen to that."</p>

<p>Lily was silent for a moment as leaned her ear in the direction  Carmen pointed.  At first she didn't hear anything, but then she  could detect a faint scratching sound, and what sounded like whispers.</p>

<p>"What is that?" Lily asked turning her attention back to the other  girl.</p>

<p>"Only one way to find out," Carmen responded rounding the corner.</p>

<p> "Southern Comfort to Mrs. Deville, Southern Comfort to Mrs. Deville… ovah," Mary Cherry whispered into the walkie-talkie clutched in her  hand, as she ducked her head around from side to side suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Are you sure your parents aren't related?" Nicole whispered harshly  as she yanked the Southerner down into a crouching position.  It was  so hard to find competent help these days.  "Just shut that vacuous  hole you call a mouth for a moment won't you, I'm almost done."</p>

<p>"Awr you shur that these pants don't make mah ass look big?" Mary  Cherry asked unaware that Nicole had even spoken.  She had learned  that you didn't really need to listen to what Nicole was saying, you  just had nod your head and agree with her vigorously.  So, with that  knowledge in mind, she had turned to a detailed examination to see  what her own buttocks looked like in a crouched position.</p>

<p>"Did I just tell you to shut your…" Nicole started to say,  momentarily turning her attention away from the lock picks in her  hand, when she froze.  Curse, Mary Cherry and her loud, grating  voice.  The Southerner had managed to distract her just long enough  for the doofus twins to locate them.</p>

<p>Quickly standing up, Nicole made her way over to Lily and Carmen  before the halfwits could open their mouths and alert someone to  their presence.  Stupid Bio Glass and her bloody strict curfew.   Slapping a hand over Carmen's mouth and dragging her back around the  corner into the stairwell, Nicole watched as Mary Cherry grabbed Lily  and did the same.  Once safely hidden away in the concrete well,  Nicole and Mary Cherry removed their hands from over the brunettes  mouths and stepped back, making mental notes to buy some anti- bacterial soap before bringing their hands anywhere near their own  flesh again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke continued to move backwards until she felt backs of her legs  hit the bed.  Turning around to look at the object that had impeded  her back peddling, she steadied herself then turned her attention  back to Sam, who was watching her with a debaucherous grin on her  face.  Brooke smiled down at her momentarily before ducking her head  forward and capturing Sam's lips with her own, as the brunette gave  one last push sending them both toppling down onto the bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Listen Krispy Crème," Nicole stated sticking her finger in Carmen's  face and waving it around for good measure.  "You and Cousin It were  sneaking around down there, so don't even think about hauling your  fat ass up on to a soapbox and lecturing me!" the shorthaired blonde  continued.  "There are two ways this meeting can end, my way and my  way, so listen closely.  We're both after the same thing here, to  find out what's going on with Cinderella and the soon to be step- troll, so we could as well work together.  Now, before we were so  rudely interrupted, I was about 5.3 seconds away from getting that  lock open, so you two can either come quietly, or Mary Cherry can  show you how they handled interlopers on her uncle's hog farm.  So,  what's it gonna be?"</p>

<p>"We'll be right back," Carmen whispered grabbing Lily by the arm and  pulling her to the other end of the stairwell.  </p>

<p>Nicole watched with growing boredom as they argued with each other,  Carmen's hands waving in the air and pointing at her palm before,  they finally seemed to come to an agreement.</p>

<p>"We accept the conditions of your proposal," Carmen said coming back  over to Nicole.  "Now let's get the hell over with, you two are  giving me hives."</p>

<hr>

<p>"Do you hear something?" Brooke asked, though she herself was  becoming more and more distracted the more Sam's hand crept up her  shirt.</p>

<p>"Only you," Sam responded.  "I want to hear more of that, only this  time along the lines of `ummm ohhhh'" Sam continued making the  appropriate faces to go along with her sound effects.</p>

<p>"You're a dirty girl aren't you?" Brooke asked with a smile, her  worries about mysteries noises long forgotten.  "I like that."</p>

<hr>

<p>Snapping the lid of her lock pick set closed Nicole stood up and  turned around to face the girls assembled behind her.  Mary Cherry  seemed to be using her compact mirror to look at Lily's ass, while  Lily orbited Carmen's body trying to escape Mary Cherry tyrannical  grasps.  Nicole sighed, freaks and losers surrounded her.  Whatever  had she done to deserve this.</p>

<p>"If you all are quite finished now," she began in a harsh  whisper.  "Our friends await."</p>

<p>Carefully opening the door, Nicole lead the pack of girls inside of  the darkened hotel room, closing the door quietly once everyone was  inside.  Moving slightly to the side she carefully extended her hand  and began to feel along the wall for a light switch, a wicked smile  working it's way across her face as her finger connected with the  stub.  </p>

<p>Just then she heard a nose emerge from the darkness of the room.  It  was a noise Nicole knew well, it was a sexual, desperate, highly  aroused moan.  Deciding right then and there, that she absolutely had  to put a stop to whatever was going Nicole flicked her finger and the  lights turned on, showering everything in the room with bright,  embarrassing light.</p>

<p>Lily and Carmen's mouths dropped open as the stood thunderstruck at  the sight that greeted them once Nicole had flipped on the light  switch.  The scene that greeted them simply too much for their non- payperview watching minds to grasp.  Sam and Brooke, together, on the  bed.  Clothes rumpled, and hands, hands in naughty, naughty places.   They could see Brooke's bra, Sam's mouth was hovered over it, they  were, they were doing stuff.  Yes, Lily and Carmen stood watching the  scene in front of them thunderstruck.  It was too much, where oh  where had the coy glances stage gone?</p>

<p>Sam's head whipped around, and Brooke's raised off of the bed as they  blinked against the suddenly light filled room, which they could just  blurringly make out as now filled with people.  </p>

<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" Mary Cherry yelled falling to her knees, her  hands coming up to grasp the hair at the front of her head as she  stared up at the ceiling.  "WHAH?  OH DEAR GAWD WHAH?  TAKE ME!  TAKE  ME!" she cried looking back over at the bed, dark mascara streaks now  marring her features.  "Whah do they great ones leave us so young???"  she whaled her body shaking.</p>

<p>Brooke blinked as the Southerners harsh cries filled the room, her  stupor finally breaking.  Working her way out from underneath Sam she  jumped off the bed and practically flung herself at Mary Cherry  clamping a hand over her mouth.</p>

<p>"My god Mary Cherry," she whispered harshly.  "SHUT UP.  You're going  to wake up the whole floor!" Brooke continued looking around  desperately, barely noticing Sam also getting off of the bed and  walking towards their visitors.  </p>

<p>Finally when Brooke was fairly certain that Mary Cherry wouldn't  erupt into a screaming fit again she removed her hand and stood up,  backing away from the still cowering Southerner.</p>

<p>"Does somebody want to tell me what the FUCK is going on here?" Sam  asked once the room became blanketed in silence once more, her gaze  leveled at Lily and Carmen who had the good decency to look shamed. </p>

<p>"You should know the answer to that question better than anyone  shouldn't you Spam?" Nicole asked, her arms folded across her chest,  as she surveyed the play unfolding in front of her with a detached  fascination.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you!" Brooke erupted pointing at Nicole as she  spotted the small pouch in her hand and recognized it for what it  was.  "You picked the lock didn't you?!?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Brookie," Nicole said sweetly looking over at the wispy haired  blonde.  "You might wanna," she continued waving a lazy hand to  indicate Brooke's semi-torso, "before lighting into me."</p>

<p>Looking mildly confused Brooke lowered her gaze, her eyes widening  when she realized what Nicole was referring to.  "Holy god!" she  muttered, beyond mortified to realize that she wasn't wearing a  shirt.  Quickly turning around so that her back was to their visitors  she began to scan the room.</p>

<p>"Where's my shirt?" she asked, her voice raising an octave or so as  she looked over at Sam.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Sam responded her voice rising as well, as her  attention was torn between Brooke and Lily who was now looking at  Brooke with an interest Sam didn't appreciate.</p>

<p>"Where's my shirt?" Brooke repeated again, getting desperate now.   She was painfully aware of how underdressed she was, and she wanted  her shirt back now.</p>

<p>"I dunno," Sam repeated once more, now torn between scanning the room  herself and watching Mary Cherry in amazement as the girl diligently  reapplied the make-up she had ruined earlier.</p>

<p>"You're the one that took it…" Brooke trailed off, as she remembered  that there were other people in the room.</p>

<p>"Brookie," Nicole said, practically singing her name.  "Over there,"  she said waving her hand in the direction of the vanity mirror, where  horror of horrors, Brooke's shirt was hanging precariously on the  corner.</p>

<p>"What'd you use to play softball?" Brooke asked shooting Sam a look  before self-consciously removing her shirt from it's resting place  and drawing it over her head.  </p>

<p>"Tut, tut Brookie," Nicole piped up as Brooke pulled down her shirt,  finally covering all of her yummy regions.  "Those who cop feels off  of other women shouldn't lob stones," she continued observing Brooke  with a shrewd smile on her face.  "Basketballs maybe, after all,  considering your new hobby and height the WNBA might just be your  calling."</p>

<p>"Get out," Brooke said whipping around to face Nicole, her face a  study in barely controlled rage.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure you really want me to do that," Nicole said rising  up to her full height and stepping forward so that she was only a  meter away from Brooke.  "Because after the terrible trauma I just  suffered, if you cast me out I might just be forced to call everyone  I've ever met and share the horror that was you groping Spam  McPherson with them."</p>

<p>Brooke opened her mouth as if to respond when Nicole finished then  promptly closed it again.  She really hadn't even begun to  contemplate possibly hypothetically conceiving responses for Nicole  finding out about her and Sam, and bam, here it was right in front of  her.  Previously she had been functioning on mortification and  indignation to guide her, but they had left her now leaving  befuddlement in their wake.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," Brooke said, but not only did the statement come out  sounding more like a question, Brooke also looked confused as if she  wasn't really certain what was coming out of her mouth.</p>

<p>"You!" Mary Cherry exclaimed extending an accusing finger in Sam's  direction.  "Look at what ya've done ya no neck little monsta!  Damn  bastard chald, ya've gone `n' broke Brookie with damn dirty whore  hands!" the southerner continued waving at Brooke who was still in a  stupefied stated.</p>

<p>Sam whipped around to face Mary Cherry, her features covered in  outrage.  "What!?!" she yelled at the blonde.  "And don't think that  I can't see you!" Sam yelled pointing at Lily and Carmen who had been  trying to ease themselves towards the door for a hasty escape before  the situation could get any worse.  "You two of all people," Sam  continued turning her attention away from Mary Cherry for a  moment.  "Working with Satan and Tweedle Dumb, have you suddenly gone  stupid!?!  How could you do this?  Will you still own your first born  or was that the price for this little congregation of horrors!?!" </p>

<p>"We were just coming to talk, then Nicole kidnapped us and threatened  to have Mary Cherry hog tie us if we didn't keep quiet and come along  peaceably," Carmen blurted out pointing at Nicole who merely rolled  her eyes extremely bored.  "We were just coming to say hi, see how  the incarceration was coming along, we don't know…that is to say if  had thought that…you know stuff would be happening…with you…we, you  know wouldn't have, and did I mention we were threatened?"</p>

<p>"Oh save it Carnie," Nicole responded looking at Carmen with  irritation.  "We all you that you two saw them looking at each other  like fiesta platters and wanted to find evidence that the looks were  just the result of being starved for the past two days instead of  actual erotic attraction.  Just admit it, you two were like our  retarded twins.  Besides, lil' big head over there seemed to enjoy  the show," Nicole continued grinning at Lily.  </p>

<p>"Did not!" Lily piped up immediately, looking around her to see if  anyone actually believed her.  Nicole simply seemed amused, Sam was  looking at her with a slight frown on her face, Brooke was watching  Sam watch her, Carmen seemed to be muttering to herself trying to  figure out why Nicole called her Carnie, and Mary Cherry was sniffing  one of Brooke's shoes.</p>

<p>"Okay, I've had enough of this," Brooke said her back straightening  purposefully.  "I want all of you to get out of our room like now!  I  think we've all seen quite enough of each other for one night," she  finished looking at all of them and then at the door.</p>

<p>"Um no," Nicole responded spinning around to face Brooke once more.</p>

<p>"What do you mean no?" Brooke asked looking at Nicole like she was  insane.  "I said get out."</p>

<p>"And I said that I don't think that's going to be happening anytime  soon.  I came here to get answers, tell you they're wrong and give  you the correct ones," Nicole responded calmly.  "And I'm not going  anywhere until I've shoved the light down your throat and made you  like it."</p>

<p>"Why?" Sam asked turning to look at Brooke.  "Why? Why? Why, do you  associate with her?!!"</p>

<p>"You want answers?" Brooke asked looking around the room at all of  them challengingly.  "Fine, I'll give you answers," she continued,  her indignation working up into a creamy lather, before she paused to  look at Sam.  "Is it alright if I give them answers?" she asked the  brunette, ignoring Nicole and her obnoxious hand motions.</p>

<p>"Be my guest," Sam responded smiling softly at the blonde.  Brooke  smiled back at her then turned to face their audience once more.</p>

<p>"Sam and I are together, and from what you walked in on I think you  know in what way I mean.  She had a thing, I had a thing, and so we  decided to have a thing together.  That's the way it is.  When we get  back home I'm gonna give her my cheerleading jacket, and then we'll  be going steady.  And if any of you have a problem with this you can  just suck on that real hard!" Brooke continued looking at them with  her most intimidating face on. </p>

<p>"That was impressive Brooke," Nicole responded not looking at all  impressed.  "Did you practice that one in front of the mirror?" she  continued staring at the other blonde.  "Go steady?" she asked  incredulously.  "Have your brains fallen completely into your utterly  stylish pants?  She," Nicole continued, pointing to Sam at this  point, "is the enemy.  She is a complete social retard, and  genetically I believe only slightly more complex than a howler  monkey.  If you must embrace the Angelina Jolie inside of you, I can  accept that, but you will not bring upon us all a social backspace  the likes of which Los Angeles has never before witnessed, for …  that," Nicole finished waving her hand at Sam, her voice drenched  with distaste.</p>

<p>"Howler monkey!?!" Sam exclaimed lunging at Nicole, missing the other  blonde by mere centimeters as Brooke grasped her around the waist and  pulled her back into her body.  "Let me go," Sam complained  struggling her Brooke's surprisingly strong arms.  "She called be a  bloody Howler monkey!"</p>

<p>"Sammy," Brooke said softly into Sam's ear as she fought to hold onto  the brunette.  "The direct use of force is such a poor solution to  any problem, it is generally employed only by small children and  large nations.  Calm down," Brooke continued in her most soothing  voice.</p>

<p>"Don't quote Friedman to me," Sam said tilting her head to the side  to look at Brooke.  "She called me a howler monkey!  And, you totally  stole that book from my room."</p>

<p>"Borrow Sam, borrowed," Brooke responded shooting Sam her most  charming smile hoping it would calm the irate brunette down.  </p>

<p>"You're lucky you're cute," Sam muttered, a small smile appearing on  her face nonetheless as she stopped struggling and settled back into  Brooke's arms.  Damn but she loved it when Brooke held her.</p>

<p>"This isn't a Glamazon meeting Nicole, you can bark all night but I'm  not going to bite," Brooke said looking over at Nicole as Sam rested  her head against her shoulder.  "She's my howler monkey, and I'm not  letting her go because you enjoy the creative rush you get when you  insult her.  So, somebody please, pop the cork cause it's time to  christen our new treaty with the Browns."</p>

<p>Nicole folded her arms across her chest after Brooke finished  observing the blonde shrewdly.  Finally, tilting her head up in the  air and turning her nose up she addressed the head cheerleader.  "Who  says you get say what treaties are made and unmade around here?" she  asked staring at Brooke hard.</p>

<p>"I say.  And you know why I get to?" Brooke responded meeting  Nicole's gaze unflinchingly.  "Because I'm the Queen Bee.  Now be a  good little peon and hail the queen."</p>

<p>The room was covered in silence after Brooke finished speaking,  nobody quite able to believe what they had heard come out of her  mouth.  It was a strange relationship that Brooke and Nicole had, to  insiders of the popular cliché and outsiders alike.  It was taken as  some sort of natural commandment that Nicole just stood by Brooke,  people had long ago stopped trying to figure out why because how  wispy little Brooke managed to contain a pit-bull like Nicole was  beyond their powers of reasoning.  But suddenly to the people in that  room it made sense, Nicole welded her power like a deadly weapon but  she also respected it in other people.  If she came up against  someone as strong willed as herself she would still rip into them  like a starved Panda, but she would view them as someone worthy of  her, a goddess like herself.  And nobody had been able to figure out  how the shorter blonde didn't rip Brooke a new asshole because the  cheerleader seemed like such a pushover.  But Brooke wasn't a push  over, she could dish it out to Nicole as well as Nicole gave it to  her, and that's why Nicole always stayed at her side.  In Brooke she  had finally found someone who could and would stand up to her.  Their  dynamic was all about respect.</p>

<p>And then finally when the silence seemed to grow oppressive, Nicole  smiled, and bowed her head slightly before whipping around to face  Mary Cherry.  "Let's go Gumbo," she barked snapping her fingers at  the southerner.  And with that she strode out of the room without  looking back. </p>

<p>"Wow," Carmen breathed out looking at Brooke with something close to  awe on her face once Nicole and Mary Cherry had exited the  room.  "That was the greatest thing I've seen."</p>

<p>"Didn't you once see a six year old rescue a grown man from a burning  building?" Lily asked looking over at Carmen.</p>

<p>"This was better," was Carmen's only response.</p>

<p>"I think you've got a groupie," Sam said twisting around so that she  could see Brooke's rapidly flushing face.  The fact was that she was  rather surprised by how Brooke had handled Nicole as well.  "I never  knew you were so dominant," Sam continued watching as Brooke turned a  deeper shade of red in response.</p>

<p>"It's not so amazing," Brooke said ripping her attention from Sam and  turning to face Carmen.  "You just have to know what Nicole is."</p>

<p>"Which is?" Lily asked.</p>

<p>"A two year old on a power trip with a gold card," Brooke  responded.  "If you let her get away with something she'll keep doing  it because she can, because getting away with the unacceptable amuses  her.  If you don't set limits with her, she'll set them…and you don't  want that," she continued.  "She's not really a bad person, she just  sometimes gets intoxicated by herself and doesn't know any better.   When she's acting normal, she's actually quite charming."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell me that smug bitch isn't her normal state of  being?" Sam asked looking up at Brooke unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm not saying that it's as alien to her as manual labour,  but…" Brooke responded seeing that she really wasn't convincing  anybody.  She sighed mentally, getting people to view Nicole as an  actual human being was apparently going to be the most difficult task  she'd undertaken.</p>

<p>"Well, now that the world has completely gone insane," Carmen  responded.  "I think I'm going to bed.  I have a world order to  restore before breakfast tomorrow…and of course questions to  prepare," she said looking at Sam who rolled her eyes.  "So… goodnight," she said turning around with Lily following behind her.</p>

<p>"And," Lily said, just before she and Carmen reached the  door.  "Congratulations.  We're happy for you.  Both of us.  Aren't  we Carm?"</p>

<p>"Ecstatic," Carmen responded.  "Positively."  Then before Carmen  could say anything else, Lily ushered her out the door and Brooke and  Sam were left alone in their room once again.</p>

<p>The moment the door closed, Brooke dropped her head down onto Sam's  shoulder and let out a piteous moan.  "What?" Sam asked kissing her  on the side of her head.  "That wasn't fun for you?"</p>

<p>"You look tired," Nicole commented with a grin as Brooke slumped down  into the seat next to her.  Harrison had taken over her seat next to  Sam; apparently the sheet of paper he was waving in her face was of  the utmost importance so she decided to steal his seat.</p>

<p>"Don't start with me," Brooke responded turning to face Nicole,  though the smile on her face took away any sting her words may have  had.  </p>

<p>"Is she any good?" Nicole asked looking at Brooke intently.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know," Brooke responded.  "THAT'S not why I'm tired," she  continued shooting her friend a look.  "I've never walked so much  continuously in my entire life.  My feet are bleeding; my feet have  to be bleeding.  This is too much, I mean my god, I'm from L.A. not  Wisconsin or something."</p>

<p>"So you haven't…" Nicole asked her voice incredulous.  After what she  had seen the night before, the idea that the two of them had somehow  managed to control themselves in the past was unimaginable to her.</p>

<p>"No."  </p>

<p>"Would you tell if you had?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Didn't think so," Nicole said looking towards the front of the bus  as the engine started up.</p>

<p>"Lady's never kiss and tell," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>"I always tell."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Brooke replied with a grin, thinking she had just called  checkmate.</p>

<p>"So, is she any good?" Nicole responded seeing the self satisfied  look on Brooke's face and knowing that it wouldn't be there for long.</p>

<p>"I just said…"</p>

<p>"I know," Nicole said interrupting.  "But I don't know any lady's who  would be caught dead doing what you were last night … so dish."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to tell," Brooke responded.  "You saw everything,"  she added in a rather militant tone.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, you're so deeply in lurve that you're relationship has  grown so that it's deeper than a physical love," Nicole responded  grinning happily.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Brooke responded.  "Besides, who would say that, that's  the most retarded thing I've ever heard."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, so there's always room for S-A-M-M-Y, huh?" Nicole asked.</p>

<p>"You're going to torture me for the rest of the week because I called  you a peon aren't you?" Brooke asked miserably.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Now I'm going to make some breast jokes, and you better laugh  like you mean it!"</p>

<p>Brooke sighed as Nicole began speaking again.  Why did relationships  have to be such hard work?</p>

<hr>

<p>"You look really…I don't know, think of something poetic and pretend  that I said it."</p>

<p>Sam looked up from the notes she had spread out in front of her when  she heard the washroom door nosily creak open.  When Brooke had  decided to take a shower after dinner, she had taken out the notes  she had received from Arabian Knight, and for the first time in days  returned her attention to what had gotten her so excited about this  field trip in the first place.  However, as she watched Brooke exit  the washroom, clad only in a white bathrobe with wet, messy hair  silhouetting her face, Sam quickly remembered why she had forgotten  all about her article in the first place.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked looking over at Sam with a slight smile sensing  the girls eyes on her.  "You're not going to accuse me of hogging the  shower again are you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.  No.  I mean wow," Sam breathed out still unable to pull  her eyes off of Brooke.  "You look really, really…I don't know," Sam  said shaking her head and blushing as she realized that she couldn't  think of a word to adequately describe how breathtaking Brooke  looked.  "I can't…why don't you just think of something really poetic  and pretend like I said it."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled at her flustered roommate and walked over to her bed  flopping down on the side not occupied by the notes Sam was gathering  up.  Once horizontal, she reached her arms back placing them under  her head, which in turn caused her robe to inch a up a little,  smiling as she watched Sam become fascinated by the newly revealed  areas of skin.</p>

<p>"It's going to be really hard for you to write that article if you  can't think of any adjectives," Brooke commented drawing Sam's  attention back to her face.</p>

<p>"I know, shame on you," Sam responded her gaze looked on Brooke's  lips for a moment, before she finally gave into her desires and  leaned down pressing her own lips against Brooke's.</p>

<p>"Shame on me?" Brooke asked once their kiss broke.  "What did I do?"</p>

<p>"You're so irresistible that you leave me almost literally  speechless," Sam responded, as her hand slowly crept across Brooke's  robe covered abdomen, before coming to rest on her hip.</p>

<p>"I can't help the fact that I'm sinfully delicious," Brooke  responded, her own eyes fastened on Sam's face as the brunette  watched her hand play across Brooke's mid-section.</p>

<p>"McQueen, deep and delicious," Sam replied smiling, before returning  to her serious contemplation of the shapes her hands were making over  Brooke's robe.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking?" Brooke asked, placing her hand over top of  Sam's watching her carefully.  There was something in the brunette's  gaze that eluded her, but was also exciting her.</p>

<p>"That," Sam said pausing so that she could look up into Brooke's  eyes.  "That I'd like to see what's under this," she continued, her  fingers idly tracing the tie of the robe.</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, and then lifted up her hand so that  it came to rest on the side of Sam's face.  Then, propping herself up  on her other hand, she leaned forward bringing their lips together,  softly at first then with increasing intensity as she felt Sam's  hands begin to work the tie of her robe.</p>

<p>As Sam's hand slipped inside of her robe, Brooke's arm gave way and  she fell back against the bed, Sam easily rolling on top of her,  their lips only separating when Sam rose up to watch her actions once  she had settled herself on top of Brooke.  </p>

<p>Brooke watched Sam's face, her lips were slightly parted and her eyes  hooded, as her thumb stroked Brooke's stomach lightly.  Brooke felt  her breath start to come in quicken and her heart flutter as Sam  slipped her other hand inside of the robe.  The blonde felt herself  shiver as she realized what Sam was about to do, and then the  brunette fulfilled her prophecy.  Slowly, Sam slid her hands up  Brooke's torso, the robe spreading apart in the wake of her hands.  </p>

<p>Sam was still for a moment once she had revealed Brooke's nude torso  to her hungry eyes, then she leaned forward bringing their lips  crashing against each others once again passionately, as she placed  her hand on Brooke's bare breast for the first time, swallowing the  blonde's groan hungrily.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked softly as the need for oxygen finally forced them  apart.  Her heart was beating so fast she was sure it was going to  break free of her chest.  She felt as if she were on fire, she felt  like she was suffocating and Brooke's skin was air.  She needed…she  needed…</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke whispered, her own body shivering with  anticipation.  Sam had stilled her hand when she spoke, but it made  no difference to Brooke's body, Sam had merely removed the cause, not  the symptoms.  "I want…I'm ready," she continued bringing one of her  hands up to rest over top of Sam's, using it to make Sam's hand  squeeze her breast once more.</p>

<p>Sam was silent for a moment, her attention focused on her hand, which  had started to massage Brooke's breast once more, then she smiled and  leaned forward bringing their lips together once more.  And, as she  felt Brooke's hands begin to slide under her own shirt, she thought  to herself, so this is what love is.  </p>
