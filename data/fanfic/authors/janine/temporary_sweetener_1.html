<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Prologue -->

<p>Pain.  Well dressed feet.  Blue pant legs.  Billows of smoke.  A gasp  of pain.  Buffy.  Buffy moving, side to side, round and about  surrounded by clouds of smoke.  Someone's yelling, it's Buffy's  name.  Head turns to side, an image is caught on the reflective  surface of a piece of metal.  The face reflected is Cordelia's.   Cordelia's hands on Buffy's shoulders.  The smoke dissipates.  Bright  light.</p>

<p>"Arrrrrrrgh," Cordelia moaned grasping her head in pain as she felt  the contents of her stomach begin to rise up into her throat and her  legs begin to totter.  She felt herself beginning to fall over only  to be grasped around the waist by two strong hands before she began  to feel herself being lifted into the air moments later.</p>

<p>"Ugh," she groaned again, blinking rapidly as her head began to clear  and it didn't hurt to think anymore.  She could hear hurried  footsteps and then felt a depression on whatever surface it was she  was laying on.  A voice, Angel, was asking if she was alright.  "I'm  fine," she managed to choke out in the general direction of the hazy  blob in front of her she assumed was the vampire.</p>

<p>"What'd you see?" Angel asked softly reaching out his hand to accept  the cool compress Fred was holding out for him.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia responded struggling to sit up.  The terror she  felt in the vision still lingered inside of her keeping her somewhat  off kilter.</p>

<p>"What do I have to do?" Angel asked trying to keep the alarm he felt  out of his voice.  He didn't like this, a message from the powers so  soon after she'd come back, when she clearly wasn't up to anything  let alone saving the world once more.  "What was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Cordelia responded truthfully her head finally clear  as she sat up and rubbed at her temples.  "But I have to go, to  Sunnydale.  I saw myself, in the vision.  I'm there with her when  whatever it is happens."</p>

<p>"We'll leave as soon as you can pack," Angel replied, standing up and  offering his hand to Cordelia.</p>

<p>Cordelia grasped his hand allowing him to pull her up easily, before  preparing to object to his use of the word `we'.  She hadn't seen him  in the vision anywhere.  "Angel I …"</p>

<p>But before she could get another word out, her hands flew to her head  once more and she fell to the ground, her eyes screwed tightly shut  as another vision overtook her mind.  Rocking and battering her until  she felt a deep ache in every part of her body.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Angel asked gently picking Cordelia up and resting her on  the couch once more, his free hand dragging the hair strewn across  her face to the side.</p>

<p>"No, young kid, maybe 13.  In a warehouse near the Boulevard.  He's  surrounded by Pylorian demons.  And there's a sign on the wall with a  giant egg on it," the brunette related as she rubbed at her eyes  tiredly.</p>

<p>"Wesley, Gunn," Angel started to say looking over at the two men on  Cordelia's other side.</p>

<p>"No," Cordelia stated firmly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean no," Angel asked looking over at her with that  charmingly confused look on his face.  </p>

<p>"I mean you stay, I go," Cordelia responded standing up.  "Whatever  is happening in Sunnydale, you're not suppose to be there.  You're  needed here, at that warehouse.  Whatever that kids involved with,  it's more than a night's work," she continued placing a hand on his  shoulder.  "Don't worry," she went on in softer tone.  "I'll look out  for her.  After all, she is the only one of you dunces who can  appreciate my shoe collection…be it a dwindling one," she continued  now standing.  "I'll call if anything pops up," and with that she  headed for the door before they could stop her, or she could stop  herself.  </p>

<p>Back to Sunnydale, home sweet hell.</p>
