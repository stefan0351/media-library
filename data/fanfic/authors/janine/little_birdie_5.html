<!-- A Little Birdie Told Me So \ Part 5 -->

<P>"Where is everybody?" Anya asked finally emerging from the
back room. </p>
<P>"Buffy's out walking Spike, and Xander and Giles went to the
butchers shop," Willow responded looking up from her book. Giles always had the
best spell books just lying around his house. </p>
<P>"Oh," Anya said taking a seat on the couch. "Are you doing
anything fun?" </p>
<P>"Well, I was looking through Volume III of the Dreger's
almanac, and I found this super cool incantation for…" Willow started to say but
Anya interrupted her. </p>
<P>"Please, stop," Anya said holding up her hand. "I'm already
regretting my inquiry immensely." </p>
<P>"Boy, you must be a joy to be around in the morning," Willow
said as Anya yawned. </p>
<P>"Mornings tend to lose their thrill after 2000 years or so,"
Anya responded. "Let's see how you're doing after your first millennia," she
continued. </p>
<P>They sat in silence for a while after that, but Willow found
it impossible to concentrate on the text with Anya sitting behind her doing
nothing. </p>
<P>"You know," Willow said standing up and moving over to the
couch. "It occurs to me that we've never really had the opportunity to just sit
down and talk." </p>
<P>"Are we going to bond now?" Anya asked looking over at her.
</p>
<P>"We're going try," Willow said building up her resolve. "We
are certainly going to try." </p>

<P>"I don't see why I have to be here," Spike grumbled kicking
a pebble along the ground. </p>
<P>"You said you wanted some fresh air, so I'm giving you some
fresh air," Buffy responded. "Now be good or I'll put on your leash."
</p>
<P>"I don't bloody believe this!" Spike exclaimed kicking a
wall. "Oh! God! Bloody hell that hurts!" he said now bouncing on his good foot
holding the one he'd hurt. "I'm William the Bloody, the scourge of Europe…and
some of Asia. Whole country sides bowed down to my will…" </p>
<P>"One more word out of you Mister and I swear…" Buffy said
holding up the leash and clicking the clasp. </p>
<P>"Why don't you just stake me?" Spike muttered under his
breath. </p>
<P>"Don't temp me," Buffy retorted. "I'm disliking you more
than usual right now…which is saying a lot." </p>
<P>"Oh, this is about Birch again isn't it?" he asked limping
slightly. </p>
<P>"That's it," Buffy said reaching out for him. "An important
part of functioning in society is learning to respect authority. Without that
fundamental respect, chaos ensues…as you well know. You, Spike, have spent too
much time on the outskirts of society and it is my duty not only as the Slayer,
but as a human being, to re-integrate you," Buffy continued attaching the leach
to his collar. </p>
<P>"Were you this mean when you WERE getting some?" Spike
asked. Buffy simply yanked in response. "I'll take that as a yes," Spike
muttered under his breath. </p>

<hr width=100>

<P>"So," Willow started. "How are things going with you and
Xander?" She could only hope that her inquiry wouldn't be met with graph
descriptions of the sex they were having. </p>
<P>"He's distracted," Anya responded. "I had to make my own
orgasm," she added sourly. </p>
<P>Willow visibly paled. </p>
<P>"TMI," Willow said clasping her hands over her ears.
"T-M-I," she said again pronouncing each letter distinctly. </p>
<P>"I'm not familiar with that acronym," Anya said completely
unfazed. "Explain." </p>
<P>"Too Much Information," Willow responded finally unclasping
her hands from the side of her head. </p>
<P>"You shouldn't have asked then," Anya responded. "I don't
understand why humans insist on making queries that they don't wish to know the
answers to. It's highly illogical." </p>
<P>"Thank you for sharing that diatribe Mr. Spock," Willow
responded. Her face was starting to regain colour. </p>
<P>"Mr. Spock? Is that some sort of pop-culture reference?"
Anya asked. "Because I don't do those." </p>
<P>"Okay," Willow said shifting her position. "This is not
going at all according to plan." </p>
<P>Anya just stared at her. </p>
<P>"Maybe we should just forget about this 'bonding' thing and
go back to sitting in silence," Willow suggested. She knew that silence was
looking really good to her at the moment. </p>
<P>"Wouldn't a change of topic be more appropriate?" Anya
asked. She wasn't really a fan of the silence. Besides she did have something in
mind to talk about. </p>
<P>"Yeah," Willow responded eyeing her a bit. "Sure, change of
topic, a topic different from the original…a whole new area of discussion, a
completely separate…" </p>
<P>"I get it," Anya said interrupting. "It's new." </p>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Before I start I'd like to make it clear that I'm not at
all interested in seeing you attain any sort of happiness," Spike said as Buffy
dragged him along. </p>
<P>"Ditto," she said simply. </p>
<P>"But…" </p>
<P>"There's always a but," Buffy muttered. </p>
<P>"Why don't you just tell her how you feel and get it the
hell over with so that I can get some goddamn rest," he continued testily.
</p>
<P>"There's nothing to tell," Buffy said yanking him a bit. For
someone who was technically dead he sure did talk a lot. </p>
<P>"Yeah, and I'm Martha Stewart," Spike responded. </p>
<P>"Well, that menorah you made for Willow really was very
pretty," Buffy said smiling. </p>
<P>"I was bored and Giles had just gotten back from the pottery
barn," Spike said defensively. </p>
<P>"Keep telling yourself that," Buffy said turning down the
road that would bring them back to Giles'. </p>
<P>"Come on," Spike said. "Talking about it will make you feel
better." </p>
<P>Buffy just looked back and glared at him. </p>
<P>"I won't tell anyone, I swear it," Spike continued when
Buffy didn't respond. </p>
<P>"Since you seem to be so smart why do you need me to tell
you anything?" Buffy asked. She wasn't even really upset at Spike, he was just
being…well Spike. She was upset that she was seriously considering talking to
him. Besides Claire and her posse, Spike was the only person Buffy knew was hip
to her feelings about Willow, and she really needed to talk about it.
</p>
<P>"I was just trying to be civil," Spike responded in a
slightly wounded tone. "Since I can't kill you and all," he added under his
breath. </p>
<P>"I can't tell her," Buffy mumbled. </p>
<P>"Why the hell not?" Spike asked. Humans were so annoying,
that's why he ate so many of them. </p>
<P>"I don't want to ruin our friendship," Buffy answered.
"Telling someone that you're in love with them and want their body usually tends
to have SOME sort of effect on a relationship." </p>
<P>"Yeah," Spike agreed. "You tell her and then you both have
sex, and I don't have to watch you pining after her anymore. Everybody wins, but
more importantly I'M happy." </p>
<P>"If I tell her, there won't be any sex or anything else to
be had since she doesn't feel the same way I do, "Buffy said scuffing her shoes
along the ground. "She's probably still not even over Oz." </p>
<P>"Who?" Spike asked staring at Buffy's neck. </p>
<P>She looked back at him. </p>
<P>"The werewolf," Buffy responded. </p>
<P>"Oh him," Spike responded. "She's not in love with him. I'm
sure he was very snuggly but they were just passing time." </p>
<P>"Excuse me?" Buffy asked stopping and trying around to face
the vampire. </p>
<P>"I'm surrounded by stupidity, utter, ubiquitous stupidity,"
Spike said exasperated flinging his hands into the air. "I try, and I try, but
I'm a demon not a bloody miracle worker." </p>
<P>"Are you finished wallowing in self pity?" Buffy asked.
Spike nodded sullenly. "Okay, then do you mind telling me what the hell you were
getting at with that 'passing time' comment?" </p>
<P>"Willow's in love with you too!" Spike exclaimed. "Whenever
you're in the same room she's gives off as many pheromones as bloody dog in
heat." </p>
<P>"You went to the 'Cordelia Chase School of Tact', didn't
you?" Buffy asked looking him. </p>
<P>"Honesty's the best policy," Spike respond shrugging.
</p>

<P>Willow somehow got the impression that her conversation with
Anya was going to be a trying event, so before they started in with the new
conversation she went into the kitchen to get some refreshments. </p>
<P>"So," Anya said once Willow re-joined her in the room. "When
are you and Buffy going to become orgasm friends?" </p>
<P>Willow sat in a stunned silence and started at her. The
hacker thought that she was alive, she could still see and think, but she felt
oddly detached from her body, like she wasn't really in it, let alone in the
room. </p>
<P>"Oh god, I think I killed her," Anya said when Willow didn't
respond. The ex-vengeance demon moved over and the couch and started poking her.
"Are you dead?" she asked. "Because I don't think that the others are going to
like that." </p>
<P>"You…I …you…said…orgasm," was all Willow managed to get out
before her oral skills once again deserted her. </p>
<P>"Well?" Anya asked. </p>
<P>"I…me…Buffy…me…and Buffy…not…one with…orgasm," Willow said.
She couldn't seem to get past that word. </p>
<P>"I'm beginning to think that the silence probably would have
been the better of the two ideas," Anya commented. </p>
<P>"Buffy…Buffy doesn't feel the same way I do," Willow said a
few moments later in a soft voice. </p>
<P>"Really?" Anya asked. "What Buffy are you talking about,
because the Buffy I know can barely keep her eyes, and hands off of you," she
continued. </p>
<P>"No," Willow said. She was sure that there was more to that
sentence but "no" was all that came out. </p>
<P>"Ah, yeah," Anya responded. </p>
<P>"No," Willow said again. Her brain refused to engage.
</p>
<P>"Yeah," Anya retorted. </p>
<P>"No." </p>
<P>"Yeah." </p>
