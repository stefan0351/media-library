<p>It had been an interesting night to say the least. Not only had she verbally attacked Parker in an utterly compelling way, but she had almost been burned to death and ended up being saved by a devolved version of her best friend. A version who was fond of clubbing people over the head, and seemed to get immense pleasure out of playing with her hair. Willow sighed and shook her head, sometimes her life was weird even to her which was saying a whole lot.</p>
<p>Buffy looked over at Willow when she heard the girl sigh and cocked her head to the side. She walked for a few more moments watching Willow rub her eyes before she spoke.</p>
<p>&#34;Girl tired,&#34; Buffy said stopping. &#34;Buffy help girl,&#34; she said firmly and she reached out for Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;It's okay Buffy, really. I'm just a little…Buffy…wait…what…&#34; was all Willow managed to get out before she was flung over Buffy's shoulder.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy make it better see,&#34; Buffy said as she started to walk again. She sounded very pleased with herself and Willow was glad that Buffy was glad because she really didn't want Buffy to be upset because Buffy seemed to like to hit people over the head with sticks when she didn't like them, but she really, really wanted down.</p>
<p>&#34;I really appreciate the effort you're trying to make here, it's really very sweet, and I'm really really grateful, but I would like very much to be put down now. Very much,&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy help, girl tired, Buffy carry girl. All good,&#34; Buffy responded not breaking stride.</p>
<p>Willow sighed again, and they walked in silence for a moment before Willow finally looked at the two men walking behind them who were being unusually quiet. Looking up Willow managed to make eye contact with Giles. The look on her face clearly said &#34;Help me!&#34;. Giles nodded his head and quickened his pace so that he was walking beside Willow and Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, perhaps it would be best if you were to put Willow down now,&#34; the Watcher started. Buffy stopped walking and turned to face him.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; she said. Then with her free hand she poked him in the chest with her finger. &#34;Quiet you.&#34; With that she continued walking again.</p>
<p>Willow looked back at Giles imploringly again.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, I really think it would be best if you were to…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why you still talk?&#34; Buffy asked whirling around to face him again. &#34;If you still talk, Buffy make you stop talk,&#34; she said making a fist. Giles stared at her for a second then made the wise decision and stepped away.</p>
<p>&#34;Although not very manly I think you made the right decision,&#34; Xander said slapping Giles on the back.</p>
<p>&#34;Would you care to give it a go?&#34; Giles asked turning to face Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't mind if I do,&#34; Xander said. Willow watched as he walked past her so that he was beside Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; was all he managed to get out before she shoved him away from her.  After that Xander followed Giles lead.</p>
<p>&#34;I know that she's devolved but that was still very, rude. I mean, I'm her beer dude, her connection, her alcoholic pimp,&#34; Xander said in a wounded voice.</p>
<p>&#34;Beer?&#34; Buffy said turning around. &#34;Where beer? Buffy want beer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's no beer Buffy,&#34; Willow said finally giving into the ride.</p>
<p>&#34;Man say beer,&#34; Buffy responded looking back at Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;Man was wrong,&#34; Willow said calmly.</p>
<p>&#34;Bad man,&#34; Buffy said.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once they got to the door of their room Buffy reached for the door then stopped momentarily captivated by the shiny surface of the door knob. She poked at it at first, then flicked it with her nail before finally turning it. Once she figured out how to turn it was only a matter of moments before she managed to get the door open. The truly amazing part wasn't that she figured out how to do all of that, but that she was able to do so without putting Willow down.</p>
<p>Once they were in the room Buffy walked over to the bed closest to the door (which just happened to be her own) and flung Willow down on it.</p>
<p>&#34;See Buffy help,&#34; she said smiling down at Willow. The smile was open, and caring, and infectious and Willow smiled back.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes, Buffy help. Thank you,&#34; Willow responded. Buffy smiled again then turned to face Xander and Giles who were standing just inside of the door.</p>
<p>&#34;Men go now,&#34; she said walking towards them. &#34;Girl home, Buffy home,&#34; she continued ushering them the short way to the door. &#34;Go home.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles managed to stop short of actually being pushed out of the door and walked around Buffy until he could see Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow are you going to be alright here, if…well it wouldn't be any trouble for…&#34; Giles started to say but Willow interrupted.</p>
<p>&#34;It's alright Giles, really, we'll be fine,&#34; Willow said noticing the way Buffy was staring at him.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you sure Will,&#34; Xander said. &#34;It could be like a slumber party, Buffy and I could bunk together and Will and Giles…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Xander!&#34; Willow exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander!&#34; Giles exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#34;What? It was just a suggestion,&#34; Xander said defensively.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said getting up off of the bed. Buffy walked over to her immediately her attention completely focused on Willow. &#34;Here, look at this for a moment,&#34; Willow said turning on the TV Buffy looked at the little people on the screen then looked back at Willow before returning her attention to the screen.</p>
<p>Satisfied that Buffy was occupied Willow walked to where Giles and Xander were standing.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not completely comfortable leaving you here with her,&#34; Giles said his attention focused on Buffy in background. &#34;Her moods have proven to be unpredictable, she could become violent.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow protested. &#34;Buffy would never hurt me, not even cave Buffy,&#34; she continued. &#34;I know that she seems different, but deep down she's still Buffy. Everything she's done to tonight has been to help me…well that and get beer, but what I'm saying is that she wouldn't ever hurt me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He may be right Will,&#34; Xander said. &#34;You might tell her to go to bed, and if she doesn't like the suggestion she could introduce you to Mr. Club.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Giles, Xander,&#34; Willow said firmly. &#34;I understand that you're concerned but I promise everything will be fine. Buffy likes me, she won't do anything to me. I'm sure that everything will be fine.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once Willow managed to get Xander and Giles out of their room she walked over to her bed and flopped back down on it. She closed her eyes and flung her arm over her eyes. It had been a long, long, night. A few seconds after she lay down on the bed she heard Buffy get up. A moment later she felt the bed bounce.</p>
<p>&#34;Will-ow,&#34; Buffy said softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Willow said not moving.</p>
<p>&#34;You okay?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow took her arm from over her face so that she could see Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm okay Buffy,&#34; Willow said smiling slightly. &#34;I'm just tired, and dirty, and…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly,&#34; Buffy supplied.</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly,&#34; Willow repeated.</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly,&#34; Buffy confirmed.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not,&#34; Willow started to say as she lifted an arm to her nose. &#34;Okay so maybe a little bit,&#34; Willow conceded.</p>
<p>&#34;It okay,&#34; Buffy said quickly sensing that she had upset Willow. &#34;Girl still beautiful,&#34; she continued in a softer voice. Willow looked over at her surprised. Beautiful, Buffy had never her called that before. Then again, she thought, best friends don't go around telling each other they're beautiful, even if that's what they're thinking. On lots of separate occasions Willow could have told Buffy that she was wholly beautiful…but you just don't do that. Do you?</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly and beautiful, that's an interesting combination,&#34; Willow said more to say something than anything else. &#34;I guess that I could do something about the smelly.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What?&#34; Buffy asked cocking her head to the side again.</p>
<p>&#34;Shower,&#34; Willow said sitting up. &#34;Definitely a shower.&#34; A shower would give her a chance to put everything that had been going on lately into perspective. Things not just with Buffy but with Oz too. Having one of them distant would have been hard enough, but now she had no idea what was going on with her boyfriend and her best friend was a Neanderthal.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy help,&#34; Buffy said reaching out for Willow again.</p>
<p>&#34;No, that's okay,&#34; Willow said moving out of her range. &#34;I'll walk this time,&#34; she continued as she headed over to her closet to get her robe.</p>
<p>&#34;Sure?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Buffy strong,&#34; she continued.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, I think I can manage,&#34; Willow said smiling to herself. One thing that could be said for this version of Buffy was that she was certainly attentive.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy go too,&#34; Buffy said moving over behind Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;No, Buffy stay, Willow go,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy smelly too, Buffy want sho-wer…Buffy want to go with Will-ow,&#34; Buffy said getting slightly agitated. &#34;Please,&#34; Buffy said softly this time looking directly into Willow's eyes. &#34;No want to be alone.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow looked down into Buffy's green eyes and didn't even have to think about her answer. Just like with normal Buffy, this Buffy's eyes were very expressive and what Willow saw in them broke her heart. Buffy was scared, and sad, and lonely, and Willow was the one that she wanted. Willow couldn't have said no even if she had really wanted to.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said grabbing Buffy's robe and handing it over to cave to her. &#34;You can come…but you have to behave.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Promise,&#34; Buffy said with a smile. &#34;Be good just like Will-ow.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once they arrived in the, thankfully, empty washroom Willow spent a few minutes demonstrating to Buffy how to use the knobs and dials in the shower and how to lather and apply as well as wash off soap. Buffy's enthusiasm made the lesson take a little longer than it should have but after about ten minutes she was satisfied Buffy had understood her.</p>
<p>Willow turned on shower and sighed. This was a very, very, good idea, she decided. After a few minutes of pure relaxation her mind started to wander into decidedly unpleasant territory. Oz and his new obsession Veruca. She had no evidence that anything was going on, but she didn't need any evidence, she could feel it in her bones. She was sure that nothing had gone on, but she got the feeling that she was just waiting for a &#34;yet&#34;, nothing had happened yet.</p>
<p>She didn't know how she would have gotten through what had been going through without Buffy by her side. No matter what was going on with slaying or with Parker, or with anything, Buffy was there for her. Just being in Buffy's presence made her feel better, even this version of Buffy.</p>
<p>Willow was about to reach for her shampoo bottle when she heard the shower door open. She was about to tell whoever it was that the stall was most definitely occupied when they spoke.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy no like over there,&#34; the Slayer said stepping completely into the shower. Willow turned around crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy you can't stay in here,&#34; Willow said her voice raising a couple octaves. &#34;This is a private place.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy no like over there,&#34; the blond repeated. &#34;'Sides, Buffy clean see,&#34; Buffy displaying her body to Willow. Willow stared for a second then ripped her eyes away. There was no way she was going to stand there in the shower naked looking at her best friends nude, wet, nude, nude, did she mention nude form.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, you can't just, it's not…you really should…because being in…we shouldn't be…&#34; Willow said not being able to get anything coherent out. She just wasn't familiar with the etiquette for a situation like this.</p>
<p>&#34;It okay,&#34; Buffy said soothingly seeing that Willow was upset. &#34;Buffy clean now,&#34; she continued reaching out for Willow's hand. &#34;See,&#34; Buffy said placing Willow's hand on her stomach. &#34;All clean.&#34; Willow managed to nod, or at least she thought she nodded. She couldn't believe this. &#34;Buffy make Will-ow clean,&#34; Buffy said dropping Willow's hand and reaching for the soap.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said taking the soap away from her. &#34;I think emphatically not.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Buffy said taking the soap back. &#34;Fattically yes.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said again swiping for the soap and missing.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Buffy said again starting to work up a lather.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said again. She couldn't believe that she was having this conversation.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy want to help Willow,&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow started to say. &#34;I…okay,&#34; Willow finally consented. She hadn't even really thought about her answer, it had just felt like that right thing to do.</p>
<p>Buffy made no visible reaction, she just continued to lather the soap.  Having agreed Willow now watched Buffy's movements with rabid attention.  Soon Buffy was satisfied with the lather and she reached out for Willow and started to work the soap onto her arms.</p>
<p>Despite her pre-historic state of being Buffy's touch was amazing gently.  Feather light, sometimes the touch was so gentle Willow wasn't even sure Buffy was touching her. Willow closed her eyes and let her head drop down to her chest. She couldn't help it, it was all very relaxing. She could feel the tension ebbing away from her, being replaced by a fluttering warmth. Willow gasped softly her eyes popping open when she realized exactly what that warmth was. She was becoming aroused by Buffy's ministrations, by Buffy. Highly aroused at that. Then she realized where Buffy was about to clean next and knew for an absolute fact that the warmth wouldn't go away if Buffy got down there.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm clean now,&#34; Willow said suddenly reaching out and stopping Buffy's hand from wandering any further. &#34;Really very clean now, clean as can be. Just call me Mrs. Clean,&#34; Willow continued reaching for the taps and turning off the water.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy like getting clean,&#34; the Slayer said following Willow out of the stall.</p>
<p>&#34;Clean is good,&#34; Willow said reaching for her robe and pulling it on.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't reach for her robe, she simply stood there staring at Willow.  She looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow soft,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;Buffy like soft,&#34; she continued reaching out a hand. Willow took step back.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes soft is nice, nice is soft, soft nice,&#34; Willow said reaching for Buffy's robe. &#34;This is soft too, how about you put it on. It smells like lemons,&#34; Willow said shoving the robe her Buffy's direction.</p>
<p>Buffy reached out and took the robe. Once she had it in hand she brought it to her nose and smelled it. She seemed to consider something for a moment then she dropped the robe onto the ground.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, please put on the robe,&#34; Willow said. Her voice sounded desperate and she realized that that's exactly what she was. Desperate. She was desperate to get Buffy in clothes because she found her eyes wandering and didn't like what that meant considering the fact that the warmth from in the shower was still there.</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>
<p>&#34;You said you'd behave,&#34; Willow reminded. &#34;You said you'd be good like me,&#34; she continued. &#34;Were you lying…like the man?&#34; she asked referring to Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Buffy said firmly. &#34;Buffy no lie, lying bad.&#34; With that said Buffy reached down and picked up the robe.</p>
<p>&#34;Thank the Lord,&#34; Willow muttered heading for the door. Suddenly the night was looking a whole lot longer.</p>

<p>The trip back from the washroom to their dorm room passed by uneventfully for the most part. There was the tiny matter of Buffy trying to take off the robe continually, but Willow caught her before she was able to open it up. At least she thought she had caught her before she was able to open it up.</p>
<p>After ushering Buffy into their room Willow relaxed notably. There was considerably less Buffy could do in the sanctity of their room that would be spread across the campus. Now all she had to do was find something to entertain Buffy for a few minutes while she changed. They weren't going to go through the 'naked, nude, unclothed bodies in close proximity to each other' thing again anytime soon. Not if Willow Rosenberg had anything to say about it.</p>
<p>&#34;Well, look at that,&#34; Willow said walking over to her snow globe. Buffy followed her. &#34;Here,&#34; Willow said handing the sphere over to her friend.  &#34;You tip it like this,&#34; Willow instructed while demonstrating how the globe worked.</p>
<p>&#34;Snow go up…snow go down,&#34; Buffy said turning the globe. &#34;Up…down…up…down…&#34; Willow smiled and headed over to her closet.</p>
<p>Pulling out her pajamas Willow quickly changed into them not wanting to get caught by Buffy again. She could still hear Buffy talking to her new friend, but she decided to play it safe. The cave slayer could be sneaky when she wanted to. Peaking out from around the door once she was dressed Willow saw that Buffy was now trying to use reverse psychology on the snow globe. She would say up then turn the globe down and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#34;That's so cute,&#34; Willow thought to herself. &#34;No wait,&#34; she continued to think turning her head away. &#34;That's not cute, not cute at all. Buffy is not cute…Buffy's sexy…..No wait, Buffy's not sexy, I repeat not sexy in the least, she gorgeous…No wait…she's…&#34; Willow stopped thinking and closed her eyes, she was starting to hyper ventilate. After taking a few deep breaths she spoke to herself softly. &#34;Okay,&#34; she started. &#34;You are calm and strong…like the mighty oak.&#34; Then she steeled herself and re-entered the room.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said in a tone that was way too chipper.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Buffy repeated in a similar tone as she turned her attention away from the snow globe and over to Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Why don't we get you out of that and…&#34; before Willow could finish the sentence Buffy had torn the robe from her body. &#34;…into something more comfortable,&#34; Willow said finishing the sentence softly. So much for avoiding the nude, there was now plenty of nude. There was nude all over the place and it was very well lit.</p>
<p>&#34;Comfortable,&#34; Buffy said stretching. Despite her best intentions Willow found herself watching the display attentively. She watched the way Buffy's muscles played under her skin, and the way the light reflected off of her perfectly tanned skin.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh my,&#34; Willow muttered to herself closing her eyes. This was not good.  This was not good at all. Bad, bad, hormones.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said finally pulling herself together. &#34;Forget the comfortable part, let's just concentrate on the something. Let's just get you into something,&#34; she continued moving over to Buffy's drawers to find some clothes for her.</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked moving over so that she was standing behind Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Because,&#34; Willow answered acutely aware of Buffy's presence behind her.  She could feel the other girls warmth wrapping around her like a blanket.  &#34;People wear clothes in today's society. There are laws about it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked again moving closer so that she could see over Willow's shoulder.</p>
<p>&#34;Because,&#34; Willow said her voice catching in her throat a bit. &#34;We can't just walk around naked.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked again.</p>
<p>&#34;Because…because it leads to fornication and…and orgies,&#34; Willow finally responded trying to concentrate on looking through the drawers.</p>
<p>&#34;So?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow paused in her searching. She hadn't thought about it that way.</p>
<p>&#34;So…so this is college…we don't do that here,&#34; Willow responded flustered.  She had to get them off of the topic of nudity and orgies. &#34;Buffy, please,&#34; Willow said softly turning around. &#34;Just put on some clothes…I'm begging over here,&#34; Willow continued trying to keep her eyes above Buffy's neck.</p>
<p>Buffy was silent for a moment. She just stood there watching Willow, studying her. Then she responded. &#34;Okay,&#34; she agreed sullenly as she looked down at the floor. She clearly didn't want to be putting on any clothes, but she didn't want to upset Willow either, she wanted Willow to be happy, so she agreed.</p>
<p>&#34;Really?&#34; Willow asked surprised. &#34;Good,&#34; she added quickly before Buffy could change her mind. &#34;Alright, let's see what we've got here,&#34; Willow said turning back to the drawers.</p>
<p>Even thought Buffy had agreed to put something on it took Willow quite some time still to find something that the girl was actually willing to put on.  The floor of the room was covered with the rejects Buffy had tossed away.  Finally, Willow was able to get Buffy to at least put on a pair of underwear and a tank top. It still didn't leave a lot to the imagination, and Willow would have preferred a complete ensemble, but, well it was better than nothing.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Willow was tired, she was very tired, and therein lay the problem because Buffy wasn't tired. She had tried everything to get Buffy to go to sleep, she really had. She offered to part with her snow globe and everything, but the answer was still a no. Finally, she just lay down on her bed staring at the ceiling hoping that Buffy would wear herself out soon.</p>
<p>Buffy watched Willow flop down on her bed and close her eyes. She watched her for moment from her bed, then she walked over to Willow's bed and sat down on the side brushing some stray strands of hair out of Willow's face.  Willow's eyes popped open at the touch and looked up meeting Buffy's gaze with her own.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, hello,&#34; was all Willow was able to get out, and that was a whisper.  She knew that she should look away, but she just couldn't, she was caught.  Caught in Buffy's gaze, and in her beauty. Even in this devolved state Buffy was startlingly beautiful, still had an aura about her that drew Willow in completely.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy stay here,&#34; Buffy said still not breaking their eye contact. Willow knew instinctively that Buffy meant that she wanted to stay there on the bed with her. No, Willow thought to herself, absolutely not. Completely unacceptable, I will not stand for that!</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; was what actually came out of her mouth however. It was nice to know that her mind and her mouth were operating together.</p>
<p>Willow shifted on the bed to make room for Buffy who then proceeded to lay down beside her. Once Buffy was settled she placed Willow's head on her shoulder and began to play with the hackers hair. Willow remained still and let Buffy play with her hair, but she didn't relax. She couldn't. She kept on thinking about how she shouldn't be allowing this to happen, how it was taking advantage of Buffy's situation. She knew that none of it would have been happening if Buffy was herself, and that's why she should stop it.  Because she was enjoying the attention and the touching way too much.</p>
<p>Just as Willow was in the final stages of drifting off to sleep she felt it. Soft lips being pressed against hers. It was gentle and sweet, like  kissing a cloud. After a moment more Willow opened her mouth and allowed the kiss to be deepened. Finally after minutes of gentle exploration the lips pulled away and Willow felt a hand on her cheek. Slowly she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Buffy was still lying beside her but her head was now directly about Willow's looking down.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said softly almost in amazement. She couldn't believe that this was happening.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't respond, she merely brought their lips back together passionately. When Willow didn't pull away Buffy moved her lips over Willow's bottom lip and sucked on it gently, stroking across the smooth softness with her tongue. Willow exhaled against her lips then pressed her lips against Buffy's as she slid her hand across Buffy's back. The passion rose between them, both of them drawing in breath deeply as it scorched them, with seconds they were kissing deeply once again, hungrily. Mouths open and tongues tangling they dueled. Willow pressed into Buffy's strong body eyes closed trying to absorb every sensation coursing through her body through osmosis.</p>
<p>Finally, Willow wrenched her mouth away from Buffy's placing her hands on Buffy's shoulders to hold her back. She had to but a stop to what they were doing. Every fiber in Willow's being wanted to continue, wanted take Buffy and kiss every inch of her body. She wanted it so much it hurt, but she just couldn't let that happen. The timing, the circumstances were all wrong, and to continue would be wrong too. Buffy was in a state of vulnerability and she would NOT abuse that, she wouldn't abuse Buffy in that way. And then there was Oz. She couldn't do this to him.</p>
<p>Buffy tried to lean forward to kiss Willow again, but Willow kept up the resistance. She was actually surprised that she was able to keep her hands out, every part of her body was on fire. She had never experienced anything like that before in her life. She loved Oz, and when they were together it was amazing, but nothing that she had ever experienced with him had prepared her for what she and Buffy had just shared.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said, her voice cracking. Buffy looked down at her with a confused expression. Willow understood the feeling. What she was doing was in complete contradiction to every signal that her body was sending out.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow, and Buffy,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;Together,&#34; she continued trying to lean down once again. Once more Willow stopped her.</p>
<p>&#34;We can't,&#34; Willow said softly. It was a struggle for her to just get the words out of her mouth. Her heart constricted every time she spoke.</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow could just detect the forming of tears in the corner of Buffy's eyes. &#34;Bu…I,&#34; she continued correcting herself.  &#34;Love…you. I love you,&#34; she said looking down at Willow pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, god…Buffy,&#34; Willow said breaking their eye contact. They couldn't…they just couldn't. &#34;We can't.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy leaned back, then once she was settled she stared at Willow for a moment not saying a word. Then she closed her eyes and remained like that for a few moments. When she opened them again Willow could see tears.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy bad,&#34; she said not bothering to try speaking in the first person anymore. &#34;Willow hate Buffy,&#34; she continued starting to get off of the bed.</p>
<p>&#34;No!&#34; Willow said firmly reaching out this time to bring Buffy back. &#34;I don't hate you, I couldn't never hate you,&#34; she continued. &#34;I love you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then why?&#34; Buffy asked. Her gaze wasn't accusatory or angry, she was just struggling to understand something Willow wasn't sure she could explain to her. Wasn't sure she could explain to herself.</p>
<p>&#34;It's not the right time,&#34; Willow said looking into Buffy's eyes trying to convey what she was feeling. &#34;I love you, but we can't right now. It's just not the right time.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy lowered her head, thinking about what Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;But, sometime?&#34; she asked looking back up at the red-head.</p>
<p>Willow stared at her. She didn't know how to answer that really. There was so much she didn't know, and that question encompassed all of it. She didn't know if Buffy would remember anything that had happened between them when she returned to herself. She didn't know what was happening between her and Oz and anymore and what that meant, if it meant anything at all, to what was happening between her and Buffy. She couldn't possibly know if there would ever be a sometime, even if she wanted there to be.</p>
<p>&#34;Sometime,&#34; she finally responded. She hadn't thought about the answer or what it meant, but it was out there now. Buffy smiled and Willow smiled back. &#34;We should go to sleep,&#34; Willow said finally. The night really had worn her out. Besides she wasn't sure that she could handle anymore deep revelations, or contemplation's.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy stay here?&#34; Buffy asked even though it really was more of a statement.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded. Once the words were out of her mouth Buffy moved so that she was lying behind Willow and then she wrapped her arms around the red-heads waist drawing them together.</p>
<p>When Buffy pulled them together Willow became acutely aware of the curves and plains of Buffy's body pressed up against her own. She also was re-introduced to the warmth and suddenly wondered if the sleeping arrangements were such a good idea after all.</p>

<p>The first thing Buffy became aware of was the feeling of warmth enveloping her. It was like she was lying against a giant hot water bottle. It was nice…it was person, she realized with a start. Immediately her eyes opened and went straight to the form in front of her. Willow. She was lying in bed with Willow. In Willow's bed she realized. Then she looked down. She was lying in bed with Willow half naked…with a headache.</p>
<p>Headache, she thought to herself. Why do I have a headache? It was much safer to first try and find out why she had a headache than why she was undressed and in bed with her best friend. Then she remembered the beer.  The bad beer.</p>
<p>Once she remembered the beer images soon started to come back to her about the night. It was fuzzy and there were parts that were completely blank, but she was able to put together most of it. Basically what she figured out was that she had drunken drugged beer and it made her devolve, then she had been in a fire. Willow was there too, in the fire, and she had saved her.  Then she remembered hitting Parker over the head with a big stick. Up to that she was clear on what happened, but the rest of it…the rest of it was decidedly more difficult.</p>
<p>After that she remember carrying Willow back to their room. She had a vague recollection of Giles and Xander, but she wasn't sure about what they were doing. Then she remember being in the shower with Willow…washing Willow.  She remembered being in the shower with Willow washing her naked body, Willow's naked, wet body. Then she remembered playing with a snow globe.  Willow's snow globe, and after that flinging clothes all over the place.  Then she remembered playing with Willow's hair and…and kissing her. She remembered kissing Willow. Oh god, she kissed Willow. Hell, she groped Willow, full body groped.</p>
<p>She returned her attention to mop of red hair nestled against her shoulder, then looked up at the ceiling, staring. She couldn't remember enough about what happened. She had to remember what exactly happened. Then she got a flash of Willow holding her back and telling her 'no'. Her heart froze when that image floated into her head. If she had hurt Willow or forced her to do something she didn't want to, she didn't know what she would do. No, she did know what she would do. She'd tell Oz and let his wolfy self rip her to pieces. Tiny little pieces.</p>
<p>She looked back down at Willow who was still sleeping soundly. Turning her head to the side she saw that it was still dark out. She then turned her attention to the clock which read 5:30 am. I've got to get up, Buffy thought to herself. She had to think. She started to move her arm which was wrapped around Willow when the hacker started to stir.</p>
<p>Willow seemed disoriented at first like she had been then the hacker looked up at her. Willow's hair was disheveled and eyes were still sleepy, she was the most beautiful sight Buffy had ever seen in her life.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey, sleepy-head,&#34; Buffy said forcing a smile across her face. Willow blinked and looked at her for moment.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; she asked. &#34;Real, non-Cro-Magnon Buffy?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Completely of this century,&#34; Buffy responded watching Willow's reactions closely. Willow smiled and moved the few centi-meters necessary to hug her. Buffy hugged her back, then they pulled away from each both very aware of the issues at hand.</p>
<p>&#34;We had an interesting night didn't we?&#34; Buffy asked looking around the room.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you remember…last night I mean?&#34; Willow asked looking at Buffy intently. There was trepidation in her voice, Buffy could feel it.</p>
<p>&#34;Bit's and pieces,&#34; Buffy responded carefully. She had to careful, she couldn't lie, Willow would know she was lying, but she wasn't going to volunteer anything either. &#34;I remember hitting Parker,&#34; she continued smiling. Willow smiled back and then they spent a few moments in comfortable silence.</p>
<p>&#34;What else?&#34; Willow asked finally.</p>
<p>&#34;It's pretty fuzzy right now,&#34; Buffy told her. &#34;I'm…I'm not really sure what happened,&#34; she said sticking to the truth. &#34;I know I'm not going drinking for a while. And that I'm going to kill Xander, but beside that…&#34; she just shrugged.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Willow said. She sounded relived. Buffy didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. &#34;I'm sure it'll come back to you eventually.  Slayer powers and everything. The strength and memory of an elephant.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Should I take offense to being compared to a large, smelly, mammal?&#34; Buffy asked stalling for time.</p>
<p>&#34;Elephants are very noble creatures,&#34; Willow responded. &#34;If it wasn't for those snotty lions they'd be king of beasts.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't you just hate those lions,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>
<p>&#34;With a passion,&#34; Willow answered.</p>
<p>They remained in silence after that for a moment.</p>
<p>&#34;Will?&#34; Buffy asked breaking the silence. &#34;I didn't do anything last night did I? You know, anything that could possibly get me arrested or anything?  Did I?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No, you were a fairly well behaved Neanderthal,&#34; Willow responded. &#34;You didn't much care for clothes…but other than that…&#34; Willow continued.</p>
<p>&#34;So, ah, this is the result of my lack of fondness for clothing,&#34; Buffy said looking down at her lack of attire.</p>
<p>&#34;Pretty much,&#34; Willow answered. &#34;And you have no idea how long it took me to get you into that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What was I wearing befo…ohhh,&#34; Buffy responded realizing the answer to her own question. &#34;I should probably…you know put on some clothes or something,&#34; Buffy said getting up off of the bed.</p>
<p>&#34;Clothes are good,&#34; Willow agreed. &#34;They keep you warm…or cool…plus they look nice. In general they look nice, not that they just look nice on you, not that they don't look nice on you, they just look nice on a lot of people including you, not that your not people, just that…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Clothes are nice,&#34; Buffy said interrupting Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow said. She was now sitting cross-legged on her bed looking at everything but Buffy. Finally, Willow looked over at Buffy who was pulling on a pair of a pajama pants. &#34;I think I'm just going to hit the hay again…I'm kind of tired.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Buffy said looking back at her. &#34;I'm sorry if I kept you up last night, I guess my cave-mother didn't teach me very good manners.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's okay, you didn't keep me up,&#34; Willow said. Buffy looked back at her with a disbelieving look. &#34;Much, you didn't keep me up much.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Go to sleep Will,&#34; Buffy said heading over to her bed.</p>
<p>&#34;I have a class at…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;I'll make sure you're up in time.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Willow said closing her eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;Anything for my Will,&#34; Buffy responded softly lying down.</p>
<p>Soon after her head hit the pillow her thoughts drifted to the past, to Willow. She had realized that the feelings she had for Willow were deep for some time, years even. And that night two Halloweens ago when she had seen Willow in her bad girl outfit and then again when she had seen her leather bound doppelganger she had felt pangs of desire. Strong pangs of desire.  Throbbing, strong, pangs of desire. But she had buried them when she had felt them then because she already had enough on her plate with Angel, and slaying. And then Faith had come along, and added a whole new set of problems to everything. She knew she loved for Willow for years, she even told her that she kinda loved her, but she wasn't or didn't want to be aware of what kind of love it was that she had for Willow.</p>
<p>She had been able to deny the feelings for years, but when Angel left at the end of the school year, and was no longer there to consume her thoughts, Buffy found herself thinking about Willow more and more. Wanting to be with Willow more and more, and finally being the person that she was she was not able to deny what she was feeling anymore. She had to admit that she just didn't love Willow, she was IN love with Willow.</p>
<p>But Willow was with Oz. And Oz was with Willow. A they were happy, and together and snuggly. But more importantly they were happy. Buffy was willing to take the chance and tell Willow how she felt, she was confident that even if Willow didn't return her affections that they could remain friends, the bond they had was that strong she was sure of it. But she never could tell Willow, because she was with Oz, and as much as Buffy wanted to be with her, or at least wanted the chance to perhaps be with her, she wasn't going to sacrifice Willow's happiness with Oz for it. She loved Willow enough to let her live her life.</p>
<p>And then, then she had to go and drink some bad beer. And know she had memories about what Willow's lips felt like. Memories of holding her close and melding their bodies together. She had memories of what it felt like to be enveloped in Willow's warmth and feel her love. And there was nothing, absolutely nothing that she could do about it. Because Willow was with Oz, and Oz was with Willow</p>
<p>Buffy glanced over at the clock. It was 7:00 am, time for Willow to get up.</p>
<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy said touching her on the shoulder. &#34;Wakey, wakey.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said opening her eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;Time to wake up, little tree,&#34; Buffy said smiling. &#34;It's the beginning of a brand new day.&#34;</p>
