<p>We stood outside the entrance of the cave looking at the gaping mouth like it was death
itself. The gang and I had been in situations like this a countless number of times. Us
against the end of the world, heading into the darkness with our heads held high and our
knees shaking. But on this particular day there was a different quality about the air
around us, it was tenser more desperate and I knew why. I had already stood at the mouth
of this cave and I had faced the demon and lost. We were going in now not as predators but
as trespassers who were being hunted as well as hunting. </p>

<p>&quot;Stay behind me,&quot; I said tightening my grasp on the flame thrower in my
hands. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lia piped up. &quot;Stay behind us.&quot; I looked back at her. The
look in my eyes conveyed that she too was to follow my instructions. I was the first line
of defense and she was the second. If it got through both of us I didn't even want to
think of consequences. </p>

<p>Before submerging myself in the darkness of the cave I looked back at Willow. Taking
that image with me I stepped into the cave. I had tried to get her to stay behind, that
morning before breakfast I tried to convince her that the best thing for her to do would
be to stay behind with Wesley and research other possibilities. It didn't work of course,
it never did. It was futile to try, but I had to anyway, it was a compulsion. I knew it
irritated her, made her feel like I didn't trust her or didn't think that she could take
care of herself, but nothing could have been farther from the truth. It was me I didn't
trust, but I could never quite get that across. </p>

<p>&quot;You've got to love the décor,&quot; Lia said as we traipsed through the cave
flash lights bouncing around. &quot;It just reeks danger, like Tori Spelling reeks
nepotism.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Apparently we've got ourselves a demon with self-respect,&quot; Xander continued.
&quot;This is the way it should be, huh, Giles? All dankness, and filth. None of that
condominium and Miata crap for this guy.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; Giles responded from somewhere behind Xander. &quot;It's nice to
know that demons somewhere still have some values. I mean, really.&quot; </p>

<p>I smirked into the darkness then turned a down a passage. We had pondered our own
mortality and were now bantering about the décor and the lack of respect demons seemed to
have for themselves these days. So far everything was going according to plan. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, I remember you,&quot; I said as we entered the fork in the cave where Lia
and I had been ambushed on our previous trip. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Lia agreed darkly. &quot;I remember you too. I don't like you,&quot;
she continued eyeing the space evilly as she rubbed her head unconsciously. </p>

<p>&quot;Is this where your head got jiggled?&quot; Willow asked Lia as she made her way
up to the front of the procession. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes it is,&quot; Lia answered. &quot;Can't you just feel the evil?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Luckily you for you didn't have much up there to get scrambled,&quot; Lyndon said
cheerfully. </p>

<p>&quot;We'll see if you're still Mr. Sunshine when that thing decides to play 'splatter
brains' with you,&quot; Lia responded turning away from him. </p>

<p>&quot;As much as I hate to do this, I'm going to have to ask you all to shut up
now,&quot; I said staring at the tunnel directly in front of me. </p>

<p>&quot;See, I don't know what Cordelia was talking about when she said that you lack
people skills,&quot; Xander quipped in response to my request. </p>

<p>&quot;Xand,&quot; I said looking back. </p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, shutting up now,&quot; he said making a motion like he was zippering his
lips. </p>

<p>Before entering the tunnel in front of me I heard Giles mutter, &quot;Today we have
witnessed a miracle&quot;. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I felt it before I saw it. No one else seemed to be able to sense it coming so I knew
it had to be my spidy-senses. It was coming for us right now. We were being hunted. </p>

<p>&quot;It's here,&quot; I said raising my flame thrower. The others look confused but
raised theirs as well. </p>

<p>&quot;Where is it?&quot; Willow asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said shaking my head. &quot;I can't tell. But it's here.
It's here somewhere.&quot; </p>

<p>I closed my eyes and stood completely still. Listening, feeling the air around me,
engaging all of my senses just like Giles had taught me. As a Slayer I was acutely aware
of things others were not, could not be aware of. Even Giles though he taught me, and was
skilled in his own right could not hope to achieve the level of awareness I was capable
of. &quot;It's what makes you the One,&quot; Giles had said to me. &quot;It's my gift,
it's my curse,&quot; I had responded quoting Frank Black. </p>

<p>A moment after I closed my eyes I felt it. In the blink of an eye I turned so that I
was facing it and pressed the trigger. An eruption of fire burst from the apex of the
thrower illuminating the room with a unpleasant glow. I hit it's left side and the beast
let out a outrageous cry. It was high pitch, almost deafening, like listening to a bunch
of whales mating with the volume way turned up. If I didn't need my hands to hold the
flame thrower I would have clasped them over my ears which I was certain were going to
start bleeding at any moment. </p>

<p>Finally the beast seemed to grasp the situation and contorted it's gooey body to avoid
the blast by propelling the middle part of it's body off to the side. It looked like
someone had taken an ice-cream scoop to it. I adjusted the blast when I saw what it had
done but it was too late. For something that looked like the Kool-Aid guy on crack the
thing sure could move like lightening. By the time I got it again it had almost reached
us. </p>

<p>&quot;Guys,&quot; I said continually adjusting my fire. &quot;Now would be a good time
to use those things!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot; That was Giles </p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh.&quot; That was Willow. </p>

<p>&quot;I knew that.&quot; That was the Xand-man. </p>

<p>&quot;You looked like you had it under control.&quot; That one was Lia. </p>

<p>&quot;Where's the trigger?&quot; Without a doubt that one was Lyndon. </p>

<p>Soon we were all firing at it. I had the mid section under control. Lia was being
vicious and going for it's head, and Xander, Willow and Giles were altering limbs. I could
see the black ooze bubbling where our fire was in contact with it. Bubbles were forming
and popping all over it and an awful smell was released. It was like sulfur only worse,
which was quite a feet cause sulfur really, really smells. </p>

<p>Things continued in this fashion for a few minutes until the beast let loose another
one of those cries. Then just like before the beast moved like lightening. The gang had
listened to me and stayed behind me and at that moment I was eternally grateful for it. I
was closest to the beast and it headed straight for me, not that it had far to go. I
re-aimed my thrower when I located it again but it was too late, it was on me by then.
Sucking me up into it just like before, ready to suck my brain dry. </p>

<p>&quot;Stop firing,&quot; it was hazy but I could tell that it was Willow. She sounded
worried, not that that was an unreasonable reaction or anything. After all we all knew
what happened last time the beast and I danced together. &quot;Stop or you'll hit
her.&quot; </p>

<p>I could feel it starting to enter my mind. The outside world was starting to fade away,
I could no longer make out words or phrases, only sounds. I tried to move my arm. There
was resistance but I could move it slightly. That was fine with me, I only needed to move
it slightly. I shifted and tilted the flame thrower up so that the barrel was facing the
beasts head. &quot;Please don't blow me up, please don't blow me up, pleasedon'tblowmeup,
pleasedon'tblowmeup&#133;&quot; I chanted as I pulled the trigger and let loose and stream
of fire. </p>

<p>I could see the beast bubbling again. Even though I was only aiming at one part of it's
body it seemed to be traveling all over, migrating from the inside out. The longer I fired
for the more violent the bubbling became, but I didn't feel any of the heat that was the
sure result of my actions. It was like I was in some sort of shielded pocket for which I
was thankful, cause what was happening to it looked like it would suck. Like it would suck
a whole lot. </p>

<p>Soon it started to glow orange, and where I was lodged inside of it started to become
very hot. Even as I kept the trigger compressed I could feel my skin beginning to burn.
The body of the thing started to expand creating a huge goo bubble around my body. It
stayed like that for a moment thumping like it was breathing, trying to compress, trying
to live, but it was not to be. Within moments the bubble burst spraying bits of goop all
over the cavern we were standing in and white circular energy waves were cast out from
where the beasts body had been filling the cavern with a hum and a blinding white light. </p>

<p>Then all was quiet again. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy are you alright?&quot; Willow asked running over to where I had dropped
when the tar-man exploded. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm alright Will,&quot; I said with a slight smile. &quot;Well-done, but I'll be
fine.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Your arm,&quot; she said reaching out but not touching it. &quot;It's all
burned.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, I planned on working on my tan anyway,&quot; I responded standing up and
giving her hand a squeeze. &quot;It's alright, I've had worse.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure you're alright Buffy?&quot; Giles asked concerned. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, &quot; Xander piped up. &quot;It looked pretty hot in there. Not that
you're not always on fire.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll be fine. But I won't protest to getting the hell out of here,&quot; I
responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Lia said flicking a piece of black-brown goop off of her shirt before
walking over and picking up the flame thrower I had dropped. &quot;Does anybody else feel
like pudding?&quot; </p>

<p>When I was four years old I wanted to be a figure skater. When I was eight years old I
wanted to be an astronaut. When I was fourteen I wanted to be an actress/model and be on
90210 and date Jason Priestly. When I was fifteen I wanted to live to see my eighteenth
birthday. Now that I'm eighteen I'm praying to make it to twenty-one. It's funny how
things can change so dramatically in such a short period of time. You find out you're
destined to fight demons from hell and routinely save the world from unspeakable horrors,
and your whole life goes to hell. </p>

<p>These were the things I was thinking about when I felt a hand come to rest on my face.
Before opening my eyes I knew it was Willow. Not only because Willow was the only one who
could get into my room, or because she was the only one, besides my mother, who would dare
touch me when I was asleep, I knew it was her because she touched me in a way that was
distinctly Will-like. I smiled and opened my eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you feeling better now?&quot; she asked once my eyes were completely open.
&quot;I hope you're feeling better, although I doubt that you could be feeling worse, what
with the being inside a demon that blew up thing, so you'd have to be feeling better or at
least same&#133;better or same,&quot; she finished. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm happy as can be...like Robert Downey, Jr. in a crack house,&quot; I
responded. &quot;Now that I've got my Wiccan wic me that is.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You're tried,&quot; Willow said brushing a stray strand of hair out of my face.
&quot;You never would have made a pun like that at full strength.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm, maybe your right,&quot; I agreed thoughtfully. &quot;Some bed rest should
make it all better though,&quot; I continued pulling her down onto the bed so that she was
lying down beside me. </p>

<p>&quot;Somehow I don't think that what you have in mind is going to be particularly
restful,&quot; Willow responded smiling. &quot;And you know what? I'm okay with
that,&quot; she continued before bringing our lips together. </p>

<p>&quot;You know where this would look really good?&quot; I asked her a moment later
fingering the material of her shirt. &quot;On the floor,&quot; I said answering my own
question. She raised her head up above me and looked down at me for a moment. Then she bit
her bottom lip and I knew that I had won. She released her lip and smiled then leaned down
and brought our lips back together. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;You are a bad, bad influence Buffy Summers. Bad,&quot; Willow said adding the
extra bad just in case I had missed the other two. </p>

<p>&quot;What I ask, what did I do?&quot; I said in a voice like that Rooster from Loony
Tunes. </p>

<p>&quot;I had come here on a mission of the utmost importance, and then with your cute
little smile, and your bar-style pick up lines you seduced me. Mission completely
forgotten. Bad, bad, Slayer,&quot; she responded. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, sometimes not even I fully understand the power of my feminine
wiles,&quot; I said. &quot;Why don't you tell me about the mission now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I would if I could but I can't,&quot; she responded refusing to make eye contact.
</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked confused. </p>

<p>&quot;I forget what it was.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You forget?&quot; I asked. She nodded. &quot;You mean you don't remember?&#133;At
all?&quot; Another nod. &quot;Can you remember if it was important? Because if it was that
means that someone is probably looking for&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>I didn't get a chance to finish that sentence seeing as how the door to my room flung
open. It was Lia and her gaze went straight to the bed. Willow pulled the sheet up. </p>

<p>&quot;A little late for modesty don't you think?&quot; Lia asked rhetorically.
&quot;We've been looking for you two. Giles has had us searching the entire
compound.&quot; She paused for a moment then before continuing. &quot;I knew we shouldn't
have sent her to get you,&quot; she directed that comment to Willow. </p>

<p>&quot;It's not her fault,&quot; I said bringing Lia's attention back over to me. </p>

<p>&quot;No, I would imagine not. Takes two to tango and all that,&quot; she responded
smiling. &quot;Listen, if you two are finished, I assume you're finished since you both
have the freshly fucked look&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Lia!&quot; I said interrupting her about two syllables too late. </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; she asked. &quot;Do I lie?&quot; I didn't responded. &quot;Alright,
alright, sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;We're meeting back at HQ in like ten minutes, so
come on over cause Giles has some news for you,&quot; she continued. &quot;By the way, you
two really need to find a new a hobby,&quot; she said before heading for the door. </p>

<p>&quot;You're just jealous,&quot; Willow said speaking for the first time since Lia
entered the room. </p>

<p>&quot;You know what, I probably am,&quot; Lia responded before continuing towards the
door. &quot;Oh, two last things. First, you might want to consider locking the door unless
you want people like me to walk in or perhaps watch secretly. Second, clothes are your
friends, please put some on. Okay, bye bye now.&quot; </p>

<p>With that she went the rest of the way out of the door and closed in behind her. </p>

<p>&quot;Definitely got to remember to lock the door. Definitely,&quot; I said once we
were alone again. </p>

<p>&quot;Definitely,&quot; Willow agreed. &quot;Uh huh.&quot; </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Willow and I were the only ones left on the beach. We had all come out there after our
meeting for a game of moonlight volley-ball. The news Giles had wanted to give me was that
both Johnny and Elizabeth had regained their memories. The doctors were confounded as to
how it happened but they were able to tell Giles the approximate time they got their
memories back, and he realized that they coincided with the destruction of Swamp Thing.
Giles believed that when we destroyed it the ring of light that we saw was the synaptic
energy the beast had stolen being released and returned to it's rightful owners. </p>

<p>Now that we were alone I was lying with my head in Willow's lap. We were just watching
the waves lap at the shore, taking in our peaceful surroundings. Moments like that were
rare in our lives. </p>

<p>Most people when they looked at us, as friends or as lovers it really didn't matter,
always assumed that I was strong one. I am Buffy the Vampire Slayer after all, scourge to
beasts and nasties everywhere, so assuming that I am the strong one would be logical. It
would be logical, but wrong. Willow was really the strongest out of the two of us. She was
the one that kept me whole, kept me sane and together through all of the madman stuff that
my life consisted. She was my Slayer, the person who kept the doubts and the demons within
me from taking over. </p>

<p>&quot;A pair of Prada boots for your thoughts,&quot; Willow said breaking the silence. </p>

<p>&quot;New York or Milan?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;New York of course,&quot; she responded smiling. </p>

<p>&quot;I was just thinking about us,&quot; I told her. </p>

<p>&quot;Good thoughts?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If they're about you they're always good,&quot; I answered. &quot;Do you ever
wonder?&quot; I asked her a moment later. &quot;I mean, I guess there's really been no
time to think about, let alone talk about it, but how'd it happen?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It?&quot; she asked. I realized that I was being vague again. </p>

<p>&quot;My memory,&quot; I clarified. &quot;How'd I get my memory back?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Willow answered. &quot;Like you said there really hasn't bee
much time to think about it, but in the little time there has been to think about it I've
thought about it, and still don't really know.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We could always asked Giles,&quot; I suggested. &quot;He usually knows stuff and
when he doesn't he's nice enough to make things up and buy us ice-cream. Double
scoop.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; Willow answered emphatically. &quot;Cause then we'd have to tell him
stuff, stuff about what we were doing. Sex stuff,&quot; she said her voice dropping to
whisper as she said the last part. &quot;That means that he'd know about&#133;stuff, and
we'd know that he knew about&#133;stuff&#133;and&#133;yuck!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm pretty sure he knows how we spend certain hours of our leisure time,&quot; I
responded. &quot;In fact he's the one who the found the evidence of your vampire
impersonation on my neck,&quot; I continued watching the myriad of expressions that
crossed her face. I was being bad, I wasn't actually going to ask Giles anything. It would
have caused him serious mental distress. He was about as interesting in hearing about our
sex life as we were in hearing about his. As in, not at all. </p>

<p>&quot;But details Buffy, he doesn't know the details. And they're the most important
part. Without the details it's all academic, it's all abstract. But with the
details&#133;it's&#133;it's&#133;pay-per-view resolution. We don't want pay-per-view
resolution Buffy, we really really don't,&quot; she responded finally. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright, no Giles,&quot; I agreed. </p>

<p>&quot;Is it really that important to you?&quot; she asked reaching down so that our
fingers were intertwined. </p>

<p>I didn't answer right away, instead I titled my head up so that we were looking
directly at each other and said, &quot;Come down here.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You want snuggles from your snuggle bunny?&quot; she asked with that sexy,
mischievous grin I loved so much. </p>

<p>&quot;There are two things in life I can never get enough of,&quot; I said as she
settle down beside me. &quot;Snuggles form my snuggle bunny, and chocolate. Even better,
my snuggle bunny covered in chocolate.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said burying her head in my shoulder. I shouldn't tease her like
that, I know it's mean, but she's so cute what she blushes. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; I told her placing a kiss on the top of her head. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you too,&quot; she said lifting her head up to place a soft kiss on my
lips. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you more,&quot; I responded with a smile. </p>

<p>&quot;No I love you more,&quot; she said grinning. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you more than Mr. Pointy and Mr. Gordo rolled up into one,&quot; I said
touching her check. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you more than Mr. Laptop and Mr. Modem&#133;they're alright one,&quot; she
responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; I asked. Coming from a hacker that was probably the biggest
compliment one could be given. </p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; she responded placing her head back down on my shoulder. </p>

<p>I tightened the hold I had on her and we lay there together in silence for a few
moments. </p>

<p>&quot;You never answered my question you know,&quot; Willow said softly. </p>

<p>&quot;And what, I say what would that be?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;If it was really important to you to know how you to your memory back?&quot; she
explained. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, the question isn't going to plague me until I need to be checked to place
with padded walls and high fiber diets, but I'd like to know,&quot; I responded. &quot;In
this line of work unanswered question have a way of coming back to try and kill
you&#133;or maybe torture and taunt you first just for kicks.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What if maybe I had an idea how it could possibly have
happened&#133;hypothetically,&quot; she said playing with her fingers nervously. </p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; I asked shifting so that I could see her face. &quot;Did you do a
Wicca thing?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; she responded immediately. &quot;Nothing like that, I would never do
something like that without asking you first. I promise,&quot; she said with absolute
conviction. I felt like a big stupid jerk for even asking. </p>

<p>&quot;I didn't mean,&quot; I started to explain but she interrupted me. </p>

<p>&quot;It's okay,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a Wicca like result and I'm the only one
that you know&#133;at least that you know of&#133;and that I know of, except for Amy, but
she's still a rat and doesn't count.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm still sorry,&quot; I told her. </p>

<p>&quot;It's okay,&quot; she said again. She was drawing in the sand with her left hand. </p>

<p>&quot;What is it Will?&quot; I asked. I was starting to get concerned. Willow wasn't
usually a vault when it came to sharing information unless she was concerned about
something. </p>

<p>&quot;When you and Lia were out playing cops and robbers I did some researching on the
net,&quot; she said returning her attention to me fully. &quot;I found some information on
this thing called a Tarcon that fit the description of our baddie perfectly. I mean if
they weren't the same thing, they had to be like first cousins or something. So, the
information didn't say how to kill it, but&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But?&quot; I prompted. </p>

<p>&quot;It said that the beast didn't really steal memories, it just kind of made a Xerox
copies of the enzymes then took that and blocked the pathway which makes it seem like the
memories are gone.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Self-defense, like a porcupine's needles.&quot; I said. &quot;If you can't
remember what happened to you, you can't tell anyone, and then you can't be hunted. Why
are the ugly ones always the smartest?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It said that the barrier wasn't concrete, that it could be broken. The reason
that it usually wasn't was because with their memories gone the victims were separated
from the person who could save them,&quot; Willow continued when I had finished. </p>

<p>&quot;Divide and conquer,&quot; I muttered. </p>

<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Willow said. &quot;Only we found you,&quot; she said moving closer
to me. &quot;It said that the barrier could only be broken by someone who had a bond deep
enough with the victim that they were in a sense a part of the victim. Then that in a
moment of closeness the two souls would join and the barrier would be broken,&quot; she
finished softly. </p>

<p>&quot;They'd have to be&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Soul-mates,&quot; she supplied. </p>

<p>&quot;That means&#133;&quot; I said staring at her in a daze. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said lowering her gaze. I watched the movement confused. </p>

<p>&quot;Don't you&#133;? I mean, why are you so&#133;? Isn't this a good thing?&quot; I
finally managed to ask. &quot;Big source for the happies?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I thought that maybe you'd&#133;I thought that maybe you'd feel cornered, like
you couldn't get away from me,&quot; she responded in a small voice. </p>

<p>&quot;Will, I don't want to get away from you,&quot; I told her. &quot;I love you, more
than anything, more than life. I could only wish to be cornered with you for the rest of
my life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; I answered. &quot;I'd never give up my snuggle bunny.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Soul-mates,&quot; Willow said again in a breathless whisper as a smile worked
it's way across her face. </p>

<p>&quot;I definitely like the sound of that,&quot; I said as our lips came together. </p>

<p>When you know nothing you can see everything. All that was once commonplace and old,
boring and tired becomes new again, becomes beautiful and miraculous. You see the world as
a new and shiny place to be discovered, like a child, but with an adults ability to reason
and understand. You comprehend how Columbus felt on that fateful day centuries ago looking
around at the majesty of the new world, both alien and familiar. </p>

<p>Even with my memory returned to me, I still found myself looking around at my
surrounding with a touch of reverence and awe. Having it all taken away from me had made
me appreciate it all the more once it was returned to me. We all have a tendency to take
what we have for granted, we start to think of it all as a right, a constant, rather than
a precious gift. When everything is taken away from you, you come to realize how truly
special what you possess really is, and you cherish it and hold on to it all the more
tightly. </p>

<p>Despite all of the terrible pains which have burned and scarred my soul, if I had it
all to do over I wouldn't change a thing. I wouldn't change a thing, because I know with
absolute certainty that it has all been worth to be able to walk where I walk, which is
heaven on earth, hell on earth, and everything in between all rolled into one package. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly, undeniably, I have loved and lost, and loved again. I have fought, and
been defeated, and come to stand once more. I have not always been perfect, but I have
always tried to do my best. I have made a difference in the lives of the people I cherish
most, and people whom I've never meet. I have lived and live still. </p>

<p>I looked down at the expanse of red hair spread across my shoulder and smiled happily.
No, I wouldn't change one damn thing. Not one damn thing.</p>
