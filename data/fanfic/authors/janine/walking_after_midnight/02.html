<p>When we entered the cave it became obvious that it was a limestone one. Bermuda had one
of the highest concentrations of limestone caves in the world, the cave-making activity
having began in the Pleistocene Ice Age, and we were walking in one of them now. In
history class we had read of an account where adventurer Capt. John Smith had complained
that he had encountered a very strange, dark, and cumbersome cave. The cave he had
encountered was a limestone one, although he couldn't have known that at the time, and as
we made our way deeper inside I could definitely see what he was talking about. There were
endless caverns of great stalactites and stalagmites of Gothic grandeur in the cave. The
formations themselves had a delicate beauty about them and under different circumstances I
might have enjoyed exploring the caves.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; I asked breaking the deathly silence of the cave. It was
the first time either of us had spoken since we entered.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lia answered. &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A dying Giraffe?&quot; I offered. &quot;Whatever it was, it came from over
there,&quot; I said pointing to one of the tunnels.</p>

<p>&quot;We should have brought our rain ponchos,&quot; Lia commented as started into the
tunnel. We were constantly getting hit by falling water droplets.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you kidding? They would totally clash with our shoes,&quot; I responded with
a smirk as I took the lead.</p>

<p>We continued to follow the tunnel until it lead to a literal fork in the road. There
was a tunnel to our left, to our right, and straight ahead. As we were trying to decided
which route to take I heard the noise again. It was close this time, very close, it
sounded like it was right on top of us, and then it happened. It was a blur of movement
from the right side, just a hulking mass going straight for Lia. Before she even had a
chance to raise her hand in defense it knocked her to the side, up against the cave wall,
then enveloped her. That was the first time I got an actual look at it. I don't know how
quite to describe it other than to say it was like a tar-man. It consisted of this shinny
black ooze, but had a humanoid form-legs, arms, and head. Coming up behind it I drew back
my arm and punched it in the back. My arm got sucked into it and I had to actually yank it
out. When I struck it, it dropped Lia and turned towards me. When it let go of Lia she
collapsed into a heap on the floor, and I noticed that she was bleeding. She was
completely defenseless and I definitely didn't want that thing going back after her, so I
decided that a change of location was needed. Turning I headed into the first tunnel I
saw, and when I saw it start after me I started running, and running.</p>

<p>Skidding to a stop I made a sharp turn right and headed down the corridor. I had made
so many turns and course adjustments since leaving the fork I wasn't even sure I could
find my way back to Lia, but at the moment that was the least of my worries.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; I muttered barely managing to stop before I ran straight into a
wall. It was a dead end, and looking around I realized dead sides too. I was trapped, and
it was right behind me. As I watched it approach me I entered my battle stance. When it
came within striking distance, I tried to punch it again but same thing happened as before
and my arm was sucked into it. This time before I had a chance to pull it out the thing
kept on walking until my entire arm was covered, and then my entire body.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Cold, I was terribly cold. That was the first thing I became aware of. The next thing I
became conscious of was the pain in my head. Pain was actually to delicate a word for it.
What I was feeling, it was all consuming, paralyzing in it's intensity. There was a
constant ringing in my ears, and I felt as though my head would explode at any second. I
curled up into a fetal position, holding my head, trying to get rid of the pain, or to get
my head to just explode already. Finally, after what seemed like hours it stopped. Turning
over onto my back, I opened my eyes tentatively. Whatever I was lying on was cold and wet,
and above me was a dripping ceiling. I soon came to the conclusion that I was in a cave.</p>

<p>Once I was upright and balanced I looked around trying to figure out what was going on.
But I realized that I didn't have any answers, only questions. What was I doing in a cave
in the first place? Where was the cave located? How do I get out of the cave? Where do I
go once I get out? Every question lead to another. The only thing I knew for sure was that
I was in a corridor that ended in a dead end. Having no option but forward, that's what
direction I went in.</p>

<p>I let out the breath I had been holding as I spotted the opening to cave in front of
me. I had been wandering around inside for what quite possibly could have been hours.
Every tunnel, every fork, lead to another one. I had no idea if I was even going in the
right direction, and even if I was going the right way I still had no idea what I was
going to do once I got out of the cave. Still, despite all the uncertainties something
inside of me would not allow me to quit, to give up. I had to go forward, I had to keep
walking, so I did.</p>

<p>I squinted as the sunlight attacked my eyes as I exited the mouth of the cave. It was
sunny out, sunny and warm. Wherever I was it was a tropical climate. Despite my
disorientation I sensed someone approaching me quickly from behind and entered what could
only be characterized as a battle stance. Surprisingly, despite my state of readiness I
did not attack when the person came within range. Instead I simply turned around and
looked at them, looked at her. She was beautiful, she had red hair, and an angelic smile
on her face. Before I even realized what was happening she had enveloped me in a hug, and
though I was surprised I felt myself returning it. I found her touch to be comforting and
I wondered if we knew each other.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said happily, that smile returning to her face. &quot;I was so
worried, when we found Lia she was bleeding from the head&#133;and then we were looking
and calling out, but we couldn't find you,&quot; she continued. &quot;I'm so glad
Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; I said half asking and half repeating. &quot;That's me right?&quot;
I continued. She just stared at me for a moment first confused, then concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; she asked again. I looked behind me just to be on the safe side,
then when I saw no one there I decided that she had to be addressing me.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I responded. &quot;I guess,&quot; I added a second later. She looked
very worried now. I wanted to take back what I had just said, or perhaps say something
else to sooth her, but I didn't know what to say. I didn't even know what her name was.
All I knew was that she was sad and I didn't like that. She reached out her hand like she
was going to touch me then at the last moment dropped it again.</p>

<p>&quot;Do..do you know who I am?&quot; she asked. I looked into her eyes and I knew that
she already knew what my answer would be.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. I can't remember,&quot; I told her truthfully. She closed her eyes
for a moment after I answered, then released a shuddering breath and re-opened them.
&quot;You know me,&quot; I said when she was looking at me again. &quot;We're
friends,&quot; I stated.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she responded with a sad smile. &quot;Come with me, the others are
waiting around the bend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Others?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Friends,&quot; she responded taking my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I said. &quot;Okay,&quot; I added then I let her lead me away.</p>

<p>She didn't say much as we walked, and when she did speak it was mostly just to ask me
how I was feeling, if I was okay. She was deep in thought for the short walk, so I used
the time to observe her. She was scared, that much was obvious. I realized that she was
probably scared for me. When we entered the small clearing there were five people gathered
around a picnic bench. Around the bench were two older men, two teenage boys, and one
teenage girl who had her head against the top of the bench and was holding an ice pack to
it. They all looked up when we entered the clearing and they seemed happy to see us. Then
they must have seen the worried look of Red's face because the smiles faded.</p>

<p>&quot;It's alright,&quot; Red said letting go of my hand and turning to face me. She
still hadn't told me her name. It probably wasn't one the most pressing things on her
mind, but it was important to me. &quot;I just have to go talk to them for a minute. You
just stay here,&quot; she continued. I looked at her for a moment uncertainly then nodded.</p>

<p>When she reached the rest of them they all kind of huddled around Red as she spoke. I
assumed she was telling them about how she found me. When she was finished talking the
more rigid of the older men tried to speak, but he was shushed by the other one.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow,&quot; the less rigid, lighter haired older man said, turning to face Red.
Willow, that had to be her name. Willow, I liked it, it suited her. &quot;It is most
imperative that Buffy regain her memory,&quot; he continued. Buffy, that was me. They were
talking about me again. &quot;I know that this is difficult for you, but I'd like for you
to stay with her. Of all of us here, she's most likely to respond to you,&quot; he
finished gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Respond,&quot; Willow repeated. &quot;Right, okay. Response is good, we want her
to respond,&quot; she continued. She looked so sad, I wanted to go over to her. Right now
she was all I had, and I didn't want her to be sad. I hadn't even realized I had started
to move towards her until I felt an arm restrain me.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going, darling?&quot; the voice attached to the arm asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Willo&#133;&quot; I started to say, but she interrupted me.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow's alright for now. You've got to stay over here&#133;and let them talk
about you in peace,&quot; she said. It was the teenage girl from the bench, the one with
the ice pack. Now that she was closer I could see that she a rather nasty bruise on the
side of her head. I wanted to argue with her about the staying thing, but I knew that she
was right.</p>

<p>&quot;Why aren't you over there helping them strategize?&quot; I asked a moment later.</p>

<p>&quot;Firstly, I don't feel I know you well enough to partake in the discussion. But
that alone wouldn't stop me which brings me to my secondly, which is that my brain just
got jiggled and right now serious thought leads to pain,&quot; she answered bringing the
ice-pack back up to her head. &quot;My name, by the way, is Lia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're the one that was bleeding from the head,&quot; I said remembering what
Willow had said.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember that?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No. Red&#133;Willow, she said that they found you bleeding from the head,&quot; I
responded. &quot;I'm Buffy&#133;apparently,&quot; I said as an introduction. She laughed
at that for a moment before turning her attention back to the group who were dispersing.
&quot;So,&quot; I continued, &quot;what is this? A field trip?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If only it were that simple,&quot; was her only reply.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>The ride to the, cottage colony I think they called it, was a quiet one. Everyone was
deep in thought, and I knew that it centered around me. Willow returned to my side after
the group had split up and had been there since we left the clearing.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are all my clothes?&quot; I asked taking a look around the room, my room
apparently. &quot;I do have clothes right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh you have clothes alright,&quot; Willow answered smiling. &quot;They're still
in your bags. You've never been a big fan of unpacking. You always said it makes no sense
to unpack&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since you just have to pack all back up again?&quot; I asked finishing up the
sentence. That did make sense.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said taking a seat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's your room?&quot; I asked sitting down next to her. I hoped it was close.</p>

<p>&quot;Right there,&quot; she responded pointing through the adjoining doors.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, fun,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she responded looking down at her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't have to do this you know,&quot; I said looking over at her. I wanted
her to be around, that was true, but not if it was going to make her sad. &quot;I know
that guy told you to stay by me, but you don't have to if I upset you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she responded quickly. &quot;I want to be here, I want to help you.
It's just that&#133;&quot; she kind of trailed off after that.</p>

<p>&quot;It's tough looking at me and seeing a stranger?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;We were close, huh?&quot; I asked. She looked over at me when I asked that, and
stared at me for a second before answering.</p>

<p>&quot;Best friends,&quot; she said simply.</p>

<p>&quot;I can see that,&quot; I responded. &quot;It's a nice thought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was a nice reality,&quot; she responded. &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I think so, yeah,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinners in an hour,&quot; she said standing up. &quot;I have to go to a meeting,
but I'll be back to get you, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I answered. She looked at me for a moment longer before giving one
last smile and heading out the door. I watched her until the door closed then flopped down
on the bed and sighed. After a moment or two more of that I got up and moved over the bags
which had been tossed haphazardly near the door to the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; I said opening the first one. &quot;Buffy Summers, who are
you?&quot; I asked pulling out the first article of clothing. There had to be something in
these bags that would at least tell me a little something about who I was, and I was all
for that.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Willow had come back to the room about forty-five minutes after she had left only to
find clothes scattered all around the room. If she had been surprised by the condition of
the room it didn't show. In fact she looked amused when she walked in and saw what I had
been up to. I guess it had reminded her something I used to do when I was her Buffy. She
helped me pack up all the stuff I had taken out of the bags then we headed down to patio
area for dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; I asked Willow looking around the patio at all the
people spread around. Lia and her brother were seated at another table, and Xander, Giles
and Wesley were all still in the line.</p>

<p>&quot;Eating, it's dinner time,&quot; Willow answered not meeting my gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, okay, I got that part,&quot; I told her trying to get her to look at me
again. &quot;But we're American, and this is Bermuda. And there are tons of teenagers
around, and a few chaperons here and there, so what are we doing here? Is it a school
trip? What?&quot; I asked when she finally turned back to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you open this?&quot; she asked handing me a ketchup bottle. She was stalling.
Taking it from her I wondered why she would ask me to open it. I was kind of scrawny so if
she couldn't open it I didn't know why she thought I could. Mentally shrugging I reached
for the top of the bottle and turned it with all my might.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; I said drawing my hand away from the bottle. Somehow when I had turned
it, I had cracked the top of glass bottle off and ketchup was everywhere. I looked up at
her apologetically, then decided that the bottle must have been made with recycled glass
or something. &quot;Sorry, I guess I don't know my own strength.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ain't that the truth,&quot; she responded taking the remnants of the bottle away
before I could hurt myself with it.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to answer my question?&quot; I asked reaching for a napkin. She
thought I had forgotten, but I hadn't.</p>

<p>&quot;It's&#133;like a convention thing,&quot; she responded vaguely.</p>

<p>&quot;A convention thing?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she answered. I was about to ask her something else but Giles,
Xander and Wesley returned to table effectively putting an end to our conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Pour vous,&quot; Xander said making a sweeping gesture as he handed me a bowl
full of JELLO.</p>

<p>&quot;For me? You shouldn't have. Really,&quot; I responded taking the bowl.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey now,&quot; Xander responded. &quot;You're gonna feel bad for saying that once
you try some. You love that stuff!&quot; he continued.</p>

<p>&quot;JELLO?&quot; I asked doubtfully poking at it with my spoon and watching it
jiggle. I liked when it jiggled.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep, not only is fat-free, but you like to watch it jiggle,&quot; Willow said
smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I said pulling my spoon back.</p>

<p>The rest of dinner was spent with the three of them regaling me with tales of our
former adventures, or misadventures as it were. I got the impression that most of the
stories were being censored, but it was still nice to hear about the stuff that we had
done together, and the other people we knew. I was particularly curious about Oz, Cordelia
and someone named Angel. They were particularly sketchy when it came to him, his name kind
of just popped up then disappeared. I was going to have to ask about that later. I wanted
to meet Oz though cause he sounded like a cool guy-had to have been to have dated
Willow--, and I wanted to meet Cordelia because I didn't see how it was possible for
someone to be as horrible as they said she was.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Willow asked coming up behind me. She had been in her room
for the last few minutes and I hadn't heard her enter. I had been staring out the window
for while and I guess I got caught up in it.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing's wrong,&quot; I responded turning to face her. &quot;What makes you
think something's wrong. This is not a face that has something wrong,&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Willow repeated. That was the one thing (well one of the
things) that sucked about having amnesia. Everyone knew you, but you didn't know them. She
could probably tell I was lying by some little thing I did, but I didn't know anything of
those things about her.</p>

<p>&quot;Can we go swimming?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Swimming?&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you know, like in water. With the holding of breath and everything,&quot; I
responded. &quot;I can swim right? I mean I'm not going to drown or anything am I?&quot; I
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&quot;You're one of the best swimmers I know, you swim like a fish&#133;well not really
like a fish since you don't have gills and stuff, but you swim really well. I mean there
was that time that you kinda&#133;wait that's not important&#133;you can swim,&quot; she
said kind of babbling. I noticed that she did that a lot, kind of ran off at the mouth
like that. I thought it was the cutest thing.</p>

<p>&quot;So we can swim?&quot; I asked again.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she confirmed heading back to her door. &quot;I'll meet you back here
in a few minutes,&quot; she continued before she entered her room and I lost sight of her.</p>

<p>It didn't take me long to find my bathing suit, and I quickly changed. I sat on the bed
for a few minutes when I finished changing waiting for Willow, then got bored and decided
to go get her. The doors between our rooms were still open so I just slipped in. Not even
a second after I walked through the doors, I came to dead stop and my jaw fell. She was
naked from the waist up, with her back facing me, and although I knew I should turn around
and go back into my room, or at the very least announce my presence, I couldn't. I just
stood there, and stared at her. Stared at the elegant lines of her back and she pulled the
straps up onto her shoulder, and a hand through her hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said surprised turning around.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, hi,&quot; I said lamely kind of waving at her. She looked at me for a moment
quizzically before responding.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; she said waving me the rest of the way through the door.</p>

<p>When we got poolside, I nearly stopped walking, my breath catching in my throat. There
was a full moon out and it was reflecting off of the water creating a beautiful shimmering
effect. I couldn't remember seeing anything so beautiful, but then again I couldn't really
remember anything. I watched as Willow dropped the towels on two of the nearby chairs,
then followed her over to the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>&quot;You're sure I can swim, right?&quot; I asked looked down.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't let anything happen to you,&quot; she said looking over at me. I looked
into her eyes and say the truth of the statement.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said bending my legs getting ready to jump. &quot;Cannonball!&quot;
I yelled then jumped in before she had a chance to back away. Surfacing as fast as I could
I looked around to see if I had gotten her. If I had it would have been sweet, it would've
been real sweet. I saw her standing in the same spot completely drenched and smiled.
&quot;Yes!&quot; I called out jumping up and pumping my fist. After all I wanted to be
mature about it.</p>

<p>&quot;You are so dead,&quot; she said looking at me.</p>

<p>&quot;You talk big, but can you deliver?&quot; I taunted. She just looked at me for a
moment before a smile worked it's way across her face. This wasn't like the other smiles I
had seen, this smile had a more sinister look to it, and I got the distinct feeling that I
had bitten off more than I could chew.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's find out,&quot; she called diving in. I looked around for her but I
couldn't see her under the water, it was too dark. Then I felt something brush against my
legs and next thing I knew I was being dragged under.</p>

<p>We wrestled like that for a while until finally she got me up against one of the walls
of the pool. I was about to beg for the mercy of the court or something like that anyway,
when something very strange happened. I was looking at her, and then all of a sudden these
images started flooding my through my head, like I watching a clips show.</p>

<p>We were in a library, at least I think it was a library, and she was smiling at me.
Then she reached over for a book at the same time I did and we got all tangled up and lost
our balance toppling over. I was on top of her, and then I was leaning down and we were
kissing.</p>

<p>Then the scene changed and we were outside. It was raining and we were soaking wet and
running around. We ended up ducking into an alleyway and hiding from the rain in the
doorway of a stores back entrance. We were laughing and shivering, and I brought her
closer to my body rubbing her arms and back trying to warm her up. She laid her head on my
shoulder and we stayed like that, wrapped together, trying to keep each other warm.</p>

<p>Then I was back to the present, staring at her worried face.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said putting her hand on my shoulder. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;
she continued. I looked at her for a moment, trying to sort out what the images I saw
meant, if they meant anything at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said finally. &quot;Just got a little dizzy. I'm alright,&quot; I
said smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure? There's a doctor if&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure Willow,&quot; I told her cutting her off. I really didn't want to dwell
on this.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; she said back peddling so that I could move away from the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;We should get Xander out here,&quot; I said swimming away from the wall. &quot;He
was on the swim team, right?&quot; I continued circling her.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, but he's not really, I mean he was part&#133;&quot; she said then she
paused for moment. &quot;He was on steroids then,&quot; she said finally. I looked back at
her questioningly. &quot;It's true, he got them in the mail,&quot; she said in response to
the look.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't we get him anyway,&quot; I said. &quot;We'll just stay in the shallow
end.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said heading for the edge of the pool. &quot;He's watching some
of the girls play volleyball on the north end of the beach. Cutting through the forest
trail would be the fastest way to get there,&quot; she continued pulling herself up.</p>

<p>&quot;You think he's gonna want to leave if he's watching them play volley ball?&quot;
I asked while getting out of the pool. She looked me up and down then smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me, he'll leave,&quot; she said walking over and getting the towels. I just
shrugged and took it out of her hands.</p>

<p>The forest trail was nicely landscaped, and even in the dark there was a very tranquil
feel to it. The maids, and cooks, and other personnel had cottages out on the trail, and
if you asked me they got the best deal because it was really nice out there.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, did you hear that?&quot; I asked stopping on the trail.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Willow responded. &quot;But you've always had better hearing than us
mere mortals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It sounded like yelling,&quot; I said. &quot;Come on, it's coming from over
there,&quot; I said moving off of the trail and into the bushes.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked even though she had already started to follow me.</p>

<p>&quot;Someone could be in trouble. We can't just walk away,&quot; I said moving to the
left in between two trees.</p>

<p>It only took a few more moments before we broke through the foliage and were able to
see what all the commotion was about. There was a man and woman fighting on the front lawn
of one of the personnel cottages. The man had her by the arms and was shaking her
violently while she was yelling for him to stop. I didn't even think about what I was
doing, I just headed over to them.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're not going to play nicely, you shouldn't play at all,&quot; I said
coming to a stop behind the man.</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell,&quot; he said turning around. I didn't recognize him, but then
again that didn't mean much.</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; I said pointing to the woman's trapped arms, &quot;Is no way to treat
a lady.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get the hell outta here bitch,&quot; he growled.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Buffy actually,&quot; I said not moving. He let go of the woman's hands when
I said that and shifted so that he was completely facing me. I saw a dangerous glint in
his blue eyes and started to wonder if perhaps Willow was right. I was working on instinct
alone up until this point and was beginning to think that possibly instinct had taken me
as far as it was going to go.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to take her place?&quot; he asked stepping towards me.</p>

<p>&quot;I was actually aiming for a solution where nobody got beat up. Possibly even a
round of kumbiyah afterward,&quot; I said backing away.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not really the hands across America type,&quot; he said in a mockingly
apologetic tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, now,&quot; I said still moving back. &quot;Can't we all just&#133;get
along?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know what&#133; I don't think we can,&quot; he said then he reached out his
arm to grab me. My arm flung out blocking his, and then I spun around so that I was behind
him. I would have wondered where that came from, but he had turned around again and had
progressed to punch mode. I reached up with my left hand and blocked the punch, then
grabbed a hold of his arm and twisted around so that it was at his back. Then I kicked out
the back of his knee and he fell to the ground.</p>

<p>He was struggling trying to the break the hold, so I tightened my grip on his arm and
pushed in against his back harder. That was when I heard the snap, and he started to howl
in pain. Letting go of his arm I stepped back and watched as he curled up holding his arm.</p>

<p>Willow who had been slowly making her way towards us came up to stand beside me.</p>

<p>&quot;You broke his arm,&quot; she said looking at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure looks that way,&quot; I responded still watching him. He was a big guy, at
least 6'3, and well over two hundred pounds. I was a foot shorter than him, and more than
a hundred pounds lighter, but somehow I had managed to overpower him. It didn't compute.
&quot;I just don't know how I did it,&quot; I said looking over at her. When I did I
noticed that she didn't look particularly surprised that I had been able to bring him
down, almost as if she was used to it.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess it's like riding a bike,&quot; she responded looking over at me.
&quot;You never forget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what, I'm like some Kung Fu master or something?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Or something,&quot; she responded. &quot;We have to go see Giles,&quot; she
continued suddenly.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought we were going to get Xander?&quot; I said starting to make my way over
to the woman who had been watching the whole scene from the same spot in her yard.</p>

<p>&quot;No, now we're going to get Giles,&quot; she said following me.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; she answered. I waited for more but no more came.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; I asked the woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she responded nodding.</p>

<p>&quot;You might want to call a doctor for him, or possibly the police ,&quot; I said
looking at the guy. He had made it to his feet now and was eyeing me wearily.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she answered. She was eyeing wearily too. There's gratitude for ya.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright then,&quot; I responded. &quot;Have a nice night,&quot; I continued
before heading back towards the path.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me again why we're going to see Giles,&quot; I asked once we had made our
way back through the bush.</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; Willow answered again.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not going to tell me are you?&quot; I asked her.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered smiling slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh brother,&quot; I muttered heading back down the path towards the cottages.</p>

<p>Giles's room was covered in books, some were open some were closed, but when we arrived
all were forgotten and I was herded into a corner while he and Willow huddled in a corner
on the opposite side of the room. Once again I was given the distinct impression that they
were talking about me. Truthfully I was getting tired with all the secrecy, I mean it was
my life that they were talking about, plotting about and I had a right to be involved in
it. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright, STOP!&quot; I demanded walking over to them. </p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me?&quot; Giles asked looking over at me. </p>

<p>&quot;I said STOP,&quot; I told him not backing down. &quot;As in stop talking about me
like I'm not in the room. As in cease and desist with protecting me from god knows
what,&quot; I continued. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy&#133;&quot; Giles started to say, but I interrupted him. </p>

<p>&quot;No, don't Buffy me. Something is obviously going on, something has been going on
from the moment I woke up in that cave. There's the first clue&#133;a cave, I woke up in a
cave for christsake!&quot; I said, my voice was rising and I didn't care. &quot;You people
are suppose to be my friends, but all you've been doing since you found me is having
little powwows and I gotta tell you it's not helping with the anxiety factor which is
already unsurprisingly high in cases of amnesia. For all I know you could be getting ready
to ship me off to Vietnam as a mail order bride. So here's the deal&#133;you give me the
real deal, or I'm out of here,&quot; I concluded looking him in the eye. </p>

<p>&quot;Where would you go?&quot; Willow asked taking a step towards me. </p>

<p>&quot;Anywhere, somewhere, at least it would be up to me,&quot; I answered. &quot;I
don't WANT to go anywhere, but I don't want to be left out of the club house anymore. I
won't be.&quot; Willow looked over at Giles questioning and he took of his glasses and
rubbed his forehead before sighing, and nodding to her. </p>

<p>&quot;You'll want to sit down for this,&quot; Giles said taking a seat on the edge of
the bed. I pulled a chair over from the desk and sat down as he instructed. Willow took a
seat next to him. &quot;We haven't meant to insult you with our secrecy, we simply felt
that it would be in your best interest if we eased you in. You may have sensed this, or
may not have, but your life&#133;our lives are not ordinary,&quot; Giles continued once we
were all seated. &quot;There is so much more to the world than people are aware of, and
underbelly they are ignorant to, and we are a part of that other world.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We're drug dealers?&quot; I asked alarmed. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Willow answered quickly. &quot;We most certainly are not.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Pimps?&quot; I asked next. It seemed like a logical progression. </p>

<p>&quot;What have you been telling her?&quot; Giles asked accusingly turning to face
Willow. </p>

<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Willow answered quickly. &quot;You're the one that started with
that separate world, underbelly talk.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We are not drug dealer or pimps,&quot; Giles said turning to face me again.
&quot;As fantastic as what I'm about to tell you might sound, I want to assure you right
now that it is all truthful. In every generation a Slayer is born...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Slayer?&quot; I asked. &quot;Like someone who kills things?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes exactly. One girl in all the world. She alone must fight the demons, and
vampires&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And general forces of darkness,&quot; Willow added. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and general forces of darkness,&quot; Giles said. &quot;She is the Slayer,
she is you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I started. &quot;I was wrong. You don't sell drugs, you're all ON
drugs,&quot; I continued standing up. </p>

<p>&quot;Everything I have told is true,&quot; Giles responded calmly. </p>

<p>&quot;I can't be true, it's crazy&#133;in fact it's more than crazy, it's insane. Can
you hear yourself? I mean are you aware of the words that are coming out of your mouth?
Vampires, demons, Slayers&#133;hello? Come on, seriously. Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,
there's a scary title. Really&#133;&quot; I said incredulously. </p>

<p>&quot;He's telling the truth Buffy,&quot; Willow said coming over to stand by me.
&quot;I know it sounds nuts, but it's true. Nobody wants to believe it at first, but it's
true. You are the Slayer, you're the best&#133;and the world needs you. Needs you to
believe,&quot; she said taking my hand. I looked over at her after a minute, looked into
her eyes. I had known her for less than a day, but already I knew that her eyes never
lied. In her eyes was truth, and that's exactly what I saw when I looked in them then. The
truth. </p>

<p>&quot;You're serious aren't you?&quot; I asked though I already knew the answer. </p>

<p>&quot;You know it's true,&quot; Willow said. &quot;I can see it in your eyes. It's how
you broke that ketchup bottle, and how you beat up that man. You are built to battle
demons,&quot; Willow answered still holding my hand. &quot;And we are here to help
you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh god,&quot; I said stepping away from her and moving over to the window. I
rested my head against the glass and just looked out it. I could see the ocean. The waters
were rough, troubled, just like me. I didn't want to believe what they were saying, it was
too fantastic. I could walk out of the room right now, tell them I didn't believe and
nobody could have blamed me. Nobody could have blamed me for not believing them when they
told me that I was some Superchick destined to save the world. But I wouldn't walk out of
the room, I couldn't walk out of the room. Because I knew. I knew that they weren't lying,
I knew that despite how insane it all sounded it was true. I could feel it, in my blood,
in my marrow, in my heart. I could feel it, I knew it, I knew it all along. </p>

<p>&quot;So now what?&quot; I asked finally turning around. </p>

<p>&quot;Now&#133;you train,&quot; Giles responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Train?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Tomorrow you'll start training with Lia. Even without your memory you are still
the best Slayer that we have. You've always been very instinctive, you've always had your
own way. I never had much to teach you that way,&quot; Giles answered. &quot;I would
rather you not have to do this, but there is a powerful demon on this Island, the same one
that took your memory, and it must be stopped. You must stop it, it's&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My destiny,&quot; I responded smirking a little. I didn't know why but the answer
seemed so familiar. I saw Willow smile too and I knew it must have been something I used
to say. &quot;Question,&quot; I said a moment later. &quot;Before you said that the Slayer
was one girl in all the world, but just now you said that I was the best Slayer you've got
even sans memory which means that there are lesser Slayers out there. But if a Slayers one
girl, then how can there be others?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A Slayer becomes a real Slayer when they are called into duty, but there are
other girls who are being trained so that when they are called they will be ready. Most of
the girls in this colony at the moment are Slayers in training,&quot; Giles responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Lia?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Lia is the next in line, yes,&quot; he answered. </p>

<p>&quot;So how does one move on up in this line?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;When one Slayer dies the next is called,&quot; Giles answered. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I said. &quot;So right now there's only one real Slayer, that's
me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Actually there&#133;.&quot; Willow started to say. </p>

<p>&quot;Willow,&quot; Giles said quickly cutting her off. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, don't shush her,&quot; I said jumping to her defense. &quot;I want to hear
what she was going to say.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Once a couple of years ago you were&#133;well you were&#133;see you kind
of&#133;you sort of died, and another Slayer was called in,&quot; Willow responded. </p>

<p>&quot;I sort of what?&quot; I asked. Could this conversation have gotten any weirder? </p>

<p>&quot;You were drowned&#133;but we got your heart started again,&quot; she responded. </p>

<p>&quot;That's nice to know,&quot; I muttered. &quot;So where's this other Slayer?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;She's in a coma,&quot; Willow answered looking down at the ground. Apparently the
other Slayer was a sore spot. </p>

<p>&quot;Demon?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; was the only response. I waited for a second expecting more, but no
more came so I moved on. </p>

<p>&quot;So tomorrow I train?&quot; I asked Giles. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we need to ascertain exactly what level you are at. We're not going after
the demon unless I'm absolutely certain that you can handle it,&quot; he answered. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright then, tomorrow,&quot; I said heading for the door. I waited until Willow
joined me then I opened the door and we headed out. </p>

<p>Later, once we were back in my room and passed out on the bed I looked over at Willow
who was staring at the ceiling. </p>

<p>&quot;So this is really real?&quot; I asked still kind of dazed. </p>

<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; she answered looking over at me. </p>

<p>&quot;And I'm good?&quot; I asked looking her straight in the eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;The best,&quot; she answered with absolute certainty. Our gazes held after she
finished speaking, and as we looked at each other time seemed to slow. I couldn't actually
remember watching a movie, but it was like we were in a movie and it was moving in slow
motion. Something passed between us in that time, something special. Nothing that I could
put a name to, maybe something that didn't have a name to put to it, but it was something
special I knew that. </p>

<p>I didn't know why exactly but I trusted this girl completely. She could have told me
that the sky was purple and the grass blue and I would have believed her. She could have
told me that I had gills and could swim with the fishes and I would have believed her. I
couldn't help but be drawn to her, I couldn't help but to trust her. It was like an
elemental force. I could try to stop it sure, but I would have failed, and truthfully I
didn't want to stop it. When I was around her my emotions were all over the place, like a
compass gone mad, but I craved it. I craved that fluttering excitement that I got in my
stomach every time she was near, and I craved that safe protected feeling that blanketed
me when she was around. Simply put, I craved her. </p>

<p>Shortly after that Willow headed to her room to go to sleep, and continued my musings
until I literally passed out. </p>

<p>Warm, wet lips, kissing my mouth, smiling as I moan. Moving down, kissing my jaw,
kissing, licking, sucking, my neck playfully as they move down. A warm tongue licking my
shoulder, nipping at it as a hand moves to my breast, squeezing, teasing gently. I arch
into the touch begging for more, needing more. The other hand moved down, caressing the
insides of my thighs, lightly brushing the skin. Tormenting and exciting the hand was. A
warm mouth descended upon my nipple sucking, licking, loving. The hand between my legs
moves upwards, closer, yes almost there&#133;yesssssssss, moving, pumping&#133; </p>

<p>&quot;Willowwwww!&quot; I screamed as my hips jumped off the bed. </p>

<p>My eyes popped open at that exclamation and I sat up. My heart was racing, my body
covered in sweat, and my hand&#133;between my legs. I sighed and let my head fall back
onto the pillows, hoping to god that I didn't scream out for real. Willow. I could still
hear the name ringing in my ears. As I stared at the ceiling I was beginning to realize
that that name was starting to encompass my world. I craved her, in more ways than one. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, don't think&#133;feel,&quot; Lia said as we stepped away from each
other and entered a ready position. That suggestion was alright by me, the last thing I
needed to do was think considering what direction my thoughts had been going in. </p>

<p>I managed to block a few easy punches before I ended up on my back on the floor. I
stood back up and we fought again with the same result. This continued for a while longer
until finally Giles stood up and put a halt to it. He instructed me to go take a seat then
started to talk to Lia. </p>

<p>&quot;It's not the amnesia, it's her. The skills are still there, I can see them, she
should be kicking my ass. It's something else entirely,&quot; I heard Lia say before I sat
down next to Willow. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm filling the room up with suck,&quot; I muttered brushing some hair out of my
face. </p>

<p>&quot;If it makes you feel better, even in this lesser state of Buffness you could
still kick my ass,&quot; Xander offered. </p>

<p>&quot;Xander, my four year old cousin beat you up,&quot; Willow said turning to face
him. </p>

<p>&quot;I still say that kid was seven maybe even ten years old,&quot; Xander said
defensively. &quot;And he went for shins which way, way below the belt no matter what
grade you're in,&quot; he continued. Willow just smirked and turned back to face me. </p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry I'm sure you just have to warm up,&quot; Willow said resting a hand
on my thigh. &quot;Once you're warm you'll be kicking ass again. Buffy the ass kicker
we'll call you&#133;well we won't call you that, but that's what you'll be doing,&quot;
she continued squeezing. I looked up at her and felt my heart constrict. </p>

<p>&quot;You think?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she answered smiling. I smiled back then looked over to the side to
see Lia staring at me. Actually it was like she was staring through me. A second later she
turned back around and said something to Giles. They argued for a moment then Lia took her
position again and Giles came back over to us. </p>

<p>&quot;Let's try it again,&quot; he said to me. &quot;Just concentrate on what you're
doing, be in the moment,&quot; he continued. I nodded then stood up and headed over to
where Lia was. </p>

<p>&quot;What'd you say to him?&quot; I asked her. </p>

<p>&quot;Nothing of consequence. He disagreed with my interpretation of the text,&quot;
she answered with a shrug. &quot;Shall we?&quot; </p>

<p>The results that time, and the next few times we fought were the same as before-me on
my ass. Finally Lia looked over at Giles. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on Giles,&quot; she implored. &quot;If I'm wrong what harm could it
do?&quot; He nodded then turned to Willow and spoke to her for a moment. She glanced at me
then turned her attention back to Giles and nodded. She then got up and headed across the
room, only stopping to wish me good luck, then she was out the doors. Xander said spoke
briefly to Giles then he headed out after Willow who looked distraught. I started to head
out after her too, but Lia restrained me. </p>

<p>&quot;Your place is here,&quot; she said in response to the look I shot her. </p>

<p>&quot;What the hell did you tell him to say to them?&quot; I asked her menacingly. </p>

<p>&quot;The truth,&quot; she said simply. </p>

<p>&quot;Which is?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The truth is, that right now I could beat you standing on one leg while reciting
Shakespeare. The truth is, that there are white belts out there that wouldn't fight you
because it would be unfair. The truth is, that you are not fighting like a Slayer, you're
not even fighting like a fairly competent sissy,&quot; Lia said looking down at me both
literally and figuratively. &quot;In a few days we have to go up against a demon that beat
BOTH of us not to long ago, and you can't seem to keep your ass of the ground. You want to
know why I told him to get rid of them?&quot; she asked her eyes boring into mine. </p>

<p>&quot;I know you're going to tell me,&quot; I said with barely controlled rage. </p>

<p>&quot;So that when they follow you blindly back into that demons lair they won't know
it's a suicide mission. I've known your friends long enough to realize that they'll follow
you in there no matter what, they're loyal that way&#133;like dogs, nothing's going to
stop them. So I figured it was best for them to go in there thinking that there was the
possibility of victory instead of knowing that with you fighting like crap we're all going
to die, or be mind fucked,&quot; Lia explained calmly. &quot;But I think they already know
what the deal is, Willow sure did. They've seen more action than I have and they know what
it takes to win, because you used to be it, now you're shit and they know it. I just hope
that Xander can&#133;'comfort' Willow enough&#133;&quot; I don't know why exactly, but
when she said that last sentence I snapped. The anger I had been holding onto since she
opened her mouth for the first time ten minutes ago rushed out. She would not talk about
Willow that way, I would not stand for it. The things she had said before about my being
crap angered me, but this latest insinuation in her barrage of insults infuriated me. </p>

<p>I charged her. Before that moment I didn't know it was possible for someone to move so
fast. I wasn't thinking, I was just feeling, reacting, and I was winning, I could feel it,
I could sense it. Then she was down on the ground, and I was above her looking down.
Looking down at her. </p>

<p>&quot;Behold the eighth wonder of the world,&quot; she said smiling. I stepped back
from her confused. &quot;I knew it,&quot; she continued. &quot;Didn't I tell you,&quot;
she said looking over at Giles. &quot;All she lacked was motivation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You planned that,&quot; I said tempted to go over there and kick her again. </p>

<p>&quot;It was the only way,&quot; Lia responded looking at the ground. &quot;You should
have been whipping me. I should have been putting up a fight, a good one, one that would
win against anyone but you, but you should have been beating me. But you weren't, you
weren't even coming close. So, I told him, I told him that you weren't because of one of
two reasons. Either you were distracted, or you just didn't care. So I got rid of the
distractions, and made you care,&quot; Lia finished finally looking up. </p>

<p>&quot;That stuff about Xander and Willow?&quot; I asked. It was important that I know. </p>

<p>&quot;Pure fabrication,&quot; she responded. &quot;No doubt they care for each other,
but Willow's heart lies elsewhere.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;With who?&quot; I asked darkly. My tone even surprised me. </p>

<p>&quot;No one,&quot; Lia answered smiling a bit. </p>

<p>&quot;But you said&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I said elsewhere, as in not with Xander. It doesn't mean someone else has it,
just that he doesn't. You dig?&quot; she asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I responded. &quot;Her heart lies someplace that is else.&quot;&nbsp;
</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>

<p>I spotted Lia walking across the patio with Lyndon and hurried over to her. She had
left about ten minutes before I got out of my meeting with Giles and I wanted to talk to
her. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; I called falling into stop beside them. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Lia greeted. </p>

<p>&quot;Can I talk to you for a minute&#133;in private?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I'll just be going now,&quot; Lyndon said taking the hint. &quot;I don't really
have any place to go but&#133;&quot; he said then started off in the other direction. </p>

<p>&quot;Listen, if this is about the stuff I said earlier, I'm sorry. I know that I was
down right mean, and not only did I step over certain lines but jumped on them before
making my way across, but I really was just trying to help,&quot; she said as we made our
way over to a table. </p>

<p>&quot;That's totally yester&#133;forget about it,&quot; I said waving it off. I had
been quite pissed at the time but I understood what she was doing, and why she doing it. </p>

<p>&quot;That's a relief. I don't really want you pissed off at me,&quot; she said rubbing
her arm. After that little bit of theatrics, things had gone the way they were suppose to
and she was the one on the ground most of the time. </p>

<p>&quot;Can I talk to you&#133;about something important. I mean, will it stay between
us?&quot; I asked her looking around the patio area. </p>

<p>&quot;I realize I probably haven't made the best impression, but I promise you that
anything you say will remain confidential. I'm much like a lawyer that way&#133;well that
and I'm a terrific liar,&quot; she responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay, good,&quot; I said meeting her gaze finally. &quot;Well, it's about me.
Well me before I lost my memory,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay, but like I said before, I had only known you for a few days before
that,&quot; Lia responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I know. That's okay, I mean this thing I want to ask you about would be
kind of obvious,&quot; I said wondering if this was a mistake. &quot;Besides the reason I
want to ask you is because you don't know me as well as they do, and I think that you'll
give me straight answers when they won't.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll listen, but if I feel that a question is out of my sphere of knowledge, I
won't answer it,&quot; she said seriously. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay, that's fair,&quot; I agreed, then paused momentarily. &quot;Um&#133;do I
bat for the home team?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you are playing at your home diamond I believe you would bat for the
home team. But if you were the visitors then that's the team you would bat for, because
they would be your team. That makes sense cause it would switch depending on who's diamond
you were at. Sorry if that's not much help, but I'm not really a connoisseur of the
baseball,&quot; she responded. </p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not what I meant. I mean&#133;well&#133;I think I'm kind of gay,&quot;
I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh that. Sorry, I wasn't expecting to have to play 'Guess this Analogy',&quot;
she responded. &quot;Why do think I would know?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, I just figured that&#133;well you know you're good looking and everything
and I figured that if I was I might have&#133;you know&#133;like made a pass at you or
something,&quot; I said while mentally kicking myself in the ass. That was lame, that was
very lame. </p>

<p>&quot;Sadly no pass was made&#133;by you at least,&quot; she added with what could only
be described as a rakish grin. </p>

<p>&quot;Does that mean you are?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm ambi-sexual, let's leave it at that,&quot; she said. &quot;Back to
you&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, am I?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Can't you tell?&quot; she asked looking over at me. I just stared at her.
&quot;Okay, a straight-and I hope you see the irony in my choice of words-answer. To my
knowledge you do in fact hit for the home team.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Okayyyy,&quot; I said drawing the word out. &quot;Was I hitting with
anyone?&quot; I asked, those images of Willow and I playing out in my mind again. </p>

<p>&quot;Not in my sphere,&quot; Lia responded. &quot;Alter your query.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I keep having these flashes, where I see Willow and myself, and we are in
situations that are decidedly more than friendly. We're&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;G-rated show here,&quot; Lia said putting up her hand. &quot;This is really
something you should discuss with Willow. I'll tell you this though, if I know that you
like girls, then they know too and have accepted it. From what I saw it was clear that you
cared for Willow very much, and that she cared for you just as much as you did for her. As
for what exactly that caring detailed, you'll have to ask her.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But I can't,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I can't just go up to her and ask how her day went, then smoothly work a question
about whether or not we were lovers into the conversation. If we weren't it could make her
very uncomfortable around me, and I don't want that,&quot; I explained. </p>

<p>&quot;So you want me to make it easier. Well, I can't do that, it's not right. If you
want to know you have to ask her, or wait and see if something happens, but you're not
going to get it out of me, or Giles, or Xander, or Lyndon&#133;if he knows what's best for
him. This is your life now, time to start making the tough calls,&quot; Lia answered.
Despite her absolute refusal to help me she actually looked sympathetic to what I was
going through. &quot;You probably need some time to think, and I need to go baby-sit my
brother, so I'm going to be going now. Before I do, I'll tell this&#133;follow your heart
Buffy. Trust your instincts, we're Slayers, they never lie,&quot; then with that she
headed back in the direction of the main compound. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I remained out there for what had to have been hours, just staring out at the ocean,
thinking and trying not to think alternately. Should I risk it? Should I risk telling my
best friend, the only person I had any real connection with since waking up that I was in
love with her? Did I even know how it was possible to fall in love in a matter of days?
Lia was right though, whether I decided to tell her or not to tell her it had to be my
decision, based on my life and feelings now. </p>

<p>Finally the stiffness in my shoulders started to bug me, I decided to head back to the
room and lay down for a while. I wasn't making any sense anymore anyway. The decision
whether or not to tell Willow probably wouldn't have been made sitting outside on a patio
anyway, I wasn't like that. If I told her it wouldn't be planned, it wouldn't be something
that I orchestrated, it would just happen. I would look at her, or she would look at me
and I wouldn't be able to hold it in any longer, and afterwards what would be would be. I
just hoped that my heart would be intact after I followed it. </p>

<p>Kicking off my shoes I flopped down onto the bed and stared at the ceiling. I had been
doing quite a bit of that, and I wondered if it was something I always used to do, or if
it was a new adaptation of this life I was living now. After a few minutes I heard
footsteps coming towards me and knew that it was Willow making her way into my room from
hers. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; she asked tentatively. </p>

<p>&quot;That's my name,&quot; I said lazily not moving. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asked taking a seat on the edge of the bed. I looked up
at her and shook my head. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I responded. &quot;I hurt&#133;hurt covers me,&quot; I continued
rubbing my shoulders. </p>

<p>&quot;Your shoulders always get tense when you're stressed out,&quot; Willow said
looking down at me. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, how did I fix it before? Cause I want some now,&quot; I said meeting her
eyes. She was looking at me oddly and I wondered what she was thinking. </p>

<p>&quot;I could&#133;I could massage them for you,&quot; she said still looking down at
me. &quot;It worked before.&quot; I watched her debating the wisdom of letting her touch
me like that considering the direction my feeling for her were heading in. The smart thing
to do would be to politely turn down the offer, to tell her that I was just tired and
needed some rest then send her on her way thus keeping our friendship intact and my
feelings hidden. That would have been the smart thing to do which is probably why I ended
up doing the exact opposite. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; is what I said. That wasn't what I had meant to say, but there it was
and I wasn't going to take it back. </p>

<p>&quot;Turn over, onto your stomach,&quot; she requested. I did as she asked and soon
deceptively strong hands started stroking my back, working out the kinks. I started to
feel the effects immediately and had to forcefully contain a moan that wanted to make it's
presence known. &quot;How's that?&quot; she asked a moment later. &quot;Heaven on
earth,&quot; I responded unable to stop the cheesy reply. I heard her make a noise in her
throat and I instinctively knew that she was smiling. </p>

<p>&quot;I need to get better access,&quot; she said a few minutes later, and I felt her
hands drift to my waist where they rested. </p>

<p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; I told her. My lips and my brain didn't seem to be communicating
efficiently at the moment, because that response and others I had made since she came in
the room were not at all what I had been thinking. </p>

<p>I felt her start to pull the shirt up, her hands running along my side as she did.
Putting my arms out in front of me I allowed her to remove the shirt completely. After
that she tried to resume her motions but my bra kept getting in the way of her motions. </p>

<p>&quot;That, ah, usually goes too,&quot; she said resting her hand over the clasp.
Before answering I wondered if all best friends gave each other topless massages. Somehow
I doubted it, and that feeling that we had been more than friends seemed to be plausible
all of a sudden, very plausible actually. </p>

<p>&quot;Well then, by all means,&quot; I responded. &quot;Take it off.&quot; She didn't
verbally reply, she just started the removal process. I was unnaturally aware of her hands
as they undid each clasp and then slid around to pull the garment off. I was even more
aware of the way her hands brushed against my breasts as she pulled the bra off. Once it
was off I laid my stomach flat against the bed again resting my head on my arms, then she
started her movements once more. </p>

<p>I could feel her weight on me as she straddled me hips. Could feel the heat radiating
off of her body, could feel her bare legs brushing against my naked sides. I could feel
her hands caressing my skin, and I realized suddenly that they were caressing. Sometime
during my musings she had gone from massaging my back to caressing it. She was moving her
hands up and down my sides, stroking them. I realized that this massage was having as much
of an effect on her as it was on me. That's when I felt it, warm lips pressed to my
shoulder blade, placing butterfly kisses on my back. </p>

<p>&quot;Willow&#133;&quot; I whispered huskily, and she stopped. The moment the last
syllable of her name was out of my mouth she stopped. More accurately she froze. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she whispered starting to move off of me. It was just like I had
thought, unlike me she wasn't aware of what she had been doing. It had been an automatic
for her, completely natural. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said turning around quickly and grabbing her hand. We were now lying
side by side facing each other. &quot;It's okay&#133;I promise,&quot; I added when she
still looked worried. </p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn't have&#133;you're&#133;&quot; she started but trailed off. She was
avoiding my gaze, looking at the wall behind me, but I desperately needed to see what was
in those eyes. I needed to know what she was feeling. </p>

<p>&quot;Willow,&quot; I said gently still holding her hand. &quot;It's okay,&quot; I
continued bringing her hand to my lips and kissing the palm, then each finger tip.
&quot;Please, don't ever apologize for that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said finally meeting my eyes. What I saw there almost broke my
heart. There was pain, arousal, confusion, longing, loneliness, love. In that look I had
the answers to all of my most pressing questions. We had been lovers, but we had been more
than that. We had been in love. I didn't know what to say to make her understand that I
understood, I didn't know what to say to make her understand that while my memory may have
been stolen the love I felt for her never went away, never dimmed. I didn't know what to
say to make her see that I still loved her, that I still needed her, that she was still my
world, so I did the only thing I could. I leaned forward and I kissed her. Slowly, gently,
I kissed her. &quot;Buffy,&quot; she said again when I pulled back. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; I said simply. I was no poet, those were the only words I had
to express what I was feeling, and they did so wonderfully. For whether I said it in a
thousand words, or three, it came down to that. &quot;I don't know what my address is, I
don't even know when my birthday is, but I know that I love you.&quot; She looked at me
for a moment, then the tears started to fall and I reached out for her. &quot;Don't
cry,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;I've missed you so much,&quot; she said tightening the hold she had around my
waist. &quot;I&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said her stroking her hair, and as unbelievable as it sounded I
did know. </p>

<p>She released me then, and brought our lips together. This kiss was firmer, more
confident, more passionate than before, and this time I moaned freely. I had almost
forgotten that I was topless until I felt her hand move it's way up my side and cup my
breast. I arched into the touch momentarily before I lowered her unprotesting to the
sheets draping my body over hers as we continued to kiss, sweetly, passionately, our lips
moving against each other in a gentle hunger. My hand had slipped under her shirt lifting
it up and over her head before I moved down to kiss her neck, to nip at it gently as my
right hand moved to her breast, squeezing it through the fabric, as my left moved up and
down her side. </p>

<p>And then the next thing I knew we were naked, and my lips were covering every square
inch of her body, kissing licking, biting, before raising to the top to start again. Every
moan, every movement of her body was like air to me, a necessity of life. Then our lips
were pressed together again and our bodies pressed so tightly together that it was hard to
tell if were two people or one. </p>

<p>I moved by thigh between her legs and felt her start to move against me. It was a dance
older than time, the steps etched into our DNA from the moment we were conceived, and I
realized that I had been waiting for this, needing it since the moment I woke up. Then her
hand was between us, moving down until she slipped inside of me. Then it was my turn to
moan, to move against her. We moved together and away, together and away, for long
moments, our motions becoming increasingly focused. Then I felt her start to tremble and I
knew the dam was about to burst. She arched off of the bed a second later, her head thrown
back and her body on fire as she called out my name. The past few days had been a time of
rediscovery for me, and of all the things that had been re-born for me-the sun, a blooming
flower, the moon-she was the most beautiful sight of all. And then I was gone too, my body
reduced to a mass of quivering flesh and fiery nerve endings. In her arms my body became a
conduit for pure ecstasy, and all that I could do was let her hold me as we rode out the
waves together. </p>

<p>As our bodies began to calm I dropped my head to her shoulder and exhaled. I wasn't
aware of anything but the beating of her heart, the rise and fall of her chest, and the
warmth of her body. For the first time I could remember I felt completely at peace. I felt
free. </p>

<p>Then just as I had finished processing those thoughts, a bright white light exploded
behind my eyes and I felt the flood gates open. My mind was saturated with images, images
moving by at a dizzying pace. I almost expected to hear an announcers voice saying
&quot;Buffy Summers this is your life&quot;. I have no idea how long these images flashed
through my mind for, but I know that afterwards-when the storm had passed-that Willow was
holding me tightly and stroking my hair. </p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; I asked my voice shaky and barely audible. My mind was still
spinning. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; she asked in an equally unsteady voice using her hand to tilt my
head up so that she could see my face. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said smiling. &quot;It's me.&quot; </p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part Six</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At a moment like that there were no words for what we were feeling, so we simply lay
there holding each other. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm so happy I can't even think,&quot; Willow whispered breaking the silence. </p>

<p>&quot;I know, my brains not functioning on the higher levels right now either,&quot; I
responded nuzzling my face against hers. I wanted to get closer to her, but there was no
space between us already. We were so close you couldn't have slipped a piece of paper
between us. </p>

<p>&quot;The past few days have been so surreal. It's like I was dreaming it all&#133;but
I knew that I wasn't. I knew it was real,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said. &quot;That's how it is for me now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How are we going to explain this?&quot; she asked. I knew that she was referring
to the sudden return of my memory. </p>

<p>&quot;Simple, we'll just tell them that you brought you me to mind blowing orgasm and
that&#133;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said slapping me on the arm. She was the same old Willow and I
loved her. </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked innocently. Ten minutes back and I was already being beaten. </p>

<p>&quot;We can't tell them the truth, I mean&#133;.wait&#133;mind blowing, huh?&quot; she
asked suddenly as a smile worked it's way across her face. </p>

<p>&quot;A mind blowing, earth shattering, re-birth,&quot; I confirmed. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, we still can't tell them the truth,&quot; she responded a moment later.
Despite her answer she was looking mighty pleased with herself. </p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; I said in a tone that left no doubt I still thought my first idea
was the way to go. It would have been worth it for the shock value alone. &quot;How about
the good old knock to the head explanation?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said. &quot;What if they ask how you hit your head?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Easy, we'll just tell them that we were in the shower and you were bringing me to
a mind blowing orgasm when&#133; </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Willow said interrupting. </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked again. </p>

<p>&quot;Find a new theme,&quot; she instructed. I smiled. It was good to be back. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>We decided that the best thing to do would be to just get everybody gathered in one
room and tell them all at the same time. That meant less grunt work of us, and only having
to conduct one question and answer session, both of which couldn't be interpreted as
anything but good. We called the front desk and asked them to deliver the messages out
when they made the wake up calls. At 9:00am we all meet in the lounge of the main compound
like we had before. </p>

<p>&quot;There's news&#133;news that wants to be shared,&quot; Willow started once
everyone was seated. </p>

<p>&quot;Does this news have to do with the difficulties at yesterday's practice
session?&quot; Wesley asked. My first response to give him the evil eye, then I progressed
from there. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, look,&quot; I said looking at the ground before tilting my head up to regard
him. &quot;There's a spider. Shouldn't you be running away screaming like a little
girl?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Merciful Christ!&quot; Xander exclaimed excitedly standing up. &quot;She's
back!&quot; he continued. Then when Willow and I looked over at him with amused
expressions he sat back down and asked &quot;You are back, right? I mean 'you' you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm back,&quot; I confirmed smiling at him. There was silence for a moment then
as everyone in the room looked at everyone else visually asking each other 'what the
hell'. </p>

<p>&quot;When did your memory return?&quot; Giles asked me finally. </p>

<p>&quot;Last night,&quot; I said. I didn't see any need to volunteer lies. </p>

<p>&quot;How'd you get it back?&quot; It was Lia who asked this question. </p>

<p>&quot;I fell, hit my head and&#133;BOOM,&quot; I said clapping my hands together. </p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; she asked leaning forward. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah&#133;really,&quot; I answered leaning forward and meeting her gaze. She
looked at me for a moment then smirked and leaned back against the back of the couch. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said. &quot;I had just thought that maybe you hurt it playing
baseball,&quot; she continued, that smirk making an appearance again. </p>

<p>&quot;Sorry to disappoint,&quot; I responded leaning back in my chair as well. </p>

<p>&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Giles asked once the mini-match between Lia and I had
ended. </p>

<p>&quot;Like a million bucks,&quot; I responded. &quot;I was a bit disoriented right
after it happened, but I'm one hundred percent now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That's good, because I've been doing some research on our friend in the cave and
there's more to this than we suspected,&quot; Giles said addressing the entire group. </p>

<p>&quot;Let's have it,&quot; I told him. Usually there was always more to it than we
expected. Basically, the unexpected was all we could expect&#133;which made it expected,
right? </p>

<p>&quot;This particular demon only surfaces once a decade, and only for 60 days in order
feed. As you probably figured out it feeds on memory enzymes. After that feeding period it
returns to the bowels of the earth where it hibernates until it is time for it to feed
again. According to the texts the beast will continue in this fashion for three centuries
until it has stored up enough energy to rise permanently. We do not want that to happen.
According to the last astrological charts it has been above ground for 58 days, which
means that we have two days to kill it,&quot; Giles responded. Sometimes I really dreaded
it when the man opened his mouth because he usually brought nothing but bad news. </p>

<p>&quot;What happens if we don't get it?&quot; Willow asked. </p>

<p>&quot;It will return to it's liquid state and seep into the ground where it will remain
hidden for the next sixty years. Then when it rises the next time it will be at full
power,&quot; Giles responded. </p>

<p>&quot;So killing it is pretty much a must,&quot; I said looking at him. </p>

<p>&quot;Pretty much,&quot; he agreed. </p>

<p>&quot;Is life always like this for you guys?&quot; Lia asked a moment later. </p>

<p>&quot;Well if I were to consider that question on, say a weekly basis, I would have to
say&#133;yeah, pretty much,&quot; I answered. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Considering everything that Giles had learned about the demon we decided that the best
way to eliminate it was to torch it. The only problem was we had nothing to torch it with,
and the only supplier of the flame-throwers we needed was not willing to sell us the
goods. So, Lia and I were cruising the streets of downtown looking for the store to see if
we could&#133;negotiate with them. </p>

<p>&quot;Can you feel that breeze?&quot; Lia asked excitedly as we walked down main
street. &quot;It's such a lovely night to commit multiple felonies.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Multiple?&quot; I asked. &quot;Calm down there Bonnie, we're here to commit one
little crime and one little crime only.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I still say it's a lovely night,&quot; she responded. &quot;You think we're going
to get a chance to test our 'get away' skills? I've always wanted to jump a fence. Not
just in practice, you know, but like in a real confrontational situation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It's not as glamorous as it sounds,&quot; I told her. &quot;Nobody warns you
about the lacerations due to barbed wire, and ripped jackets that result. Not to mention
that most of the time when you come across a fence you're being tossed up against it, not
jumping it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Good with the bad,&quot; she responded. &quot;If you want the rainbow, you gotta
put up with the rain,&quot; she continued. &quot;This is it,&quot; she said stopping in
front of a store. </p>

<p>&quot;So, what do you say, trash can or one of my personal favorites, the window
jump?&quot; I asked reviewing our options. </p>

<p>&quot;That's a tough choice, they're both classics you know,&quot; she responded.
&quot;I'm gonna have to go with the window jump though.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Everybody always picks the window jump,&quot; I said backing up onto the street
to get a running start. </p>

<p>&quot;It's a staple of the American film industry. We've been conditioned to pick the
window jump,&quot; she said joining me on the road. </p>

<p>&quot;On three,&quot; I said bouncing on my toes a little. &quot;Three!&quot; I said
then took off. It took Lia a second to catch on but soon we were crashing through the
window together. </p>

<p>&quot;Kickass!&quot; she shouted as we made it through. &quot;Yeah, baby,&quot; she
continued as we made our way further into the store. I could hear the alarm and knew we
didn't have much time. </p>

<p>&quot;You check out here, I'll check the supply room. We don't have much time so if you
don't see them come back and help me. You dig?&quot; I said to her. </p>

<p>&quot;Got ya,&quot; she said saluting before heading off in search of treasure. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;I got two here,&quot; I heard her call a moment later. </p>

<p>&quot;Two more back here,&quot; I said grabbing them. &quot;That's good enough, let's
get the hell outta here,&quot; I said joining her in the main room. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm all for that,&quot; she said jumping out of what remained of the window. We
started to head in the direction we had come from but we saw sirens not rounding the
corner and turned around. </p>

<p>We headed straight down the street for a few minutes before ducking into an alleyway.
There was a fence, it seemed like Lia was going to get her wish. </p>

<p>&quot;How far back are they?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Not far, minute maybe,&quot; she answered. </p>

<p>&quot;Give me your stash, then jump over. I'll throw them over to you then
follow,&quot; I instructed. I could hear their footsteps getting closer. Lia handed me the
two throwers she had then jumped the fence in a fluid motion. Once she landed I threw the
throwers over then jumped the fence. </p>

<p>&quot;Let me guess, now we run?&quot; Lia asked handing me back my two throwers. </p>

<p>&quot;You're catching on kid,&quot; I said, then we headed down alley. We were out of
sight, if not out of mind by the time the officers made it over the fence. </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>When Lia and I returned from our escapade we all headed down to the beach for a
bonfire. Xander had raided the kitchen and gotten us marshmallows and other bonfire
goodies to snack on, so all we had to do now was get the fire lit. </p>

<p>&quot;I would really advice against that,&quot; Giles said to Lia as he slowly backed
away from where she was standing. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh don't get your knickers in a knot,&quot; Lia responded. &quot;this is a great
idea. Not to mention fast. Good, fast ideas are rare and not to be wasted.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Lia, let's try not to have a repeat of the Snake Hill incident,&quot; Lyndon
goaded from the sidelines. </p>

<p>&quot;That was a good idea on Snake Hill, mother said that it was very
impressive,&quot; she responded. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, before you hit the tree,&quot; Lyndon said in response. By now all of us
were standing what we hoped was a safe distance away from her. </p>

<p>&quot;Where's everyone going?&quot; Lia asked looking around. &quot;Nothing is going to
happen, this is perfectly safe,&quot; she said looking at us all imploringly. </p>

<p>&quot;Miss Grayson, I implore you,&quot; Wesley started. &quot;Surely you've broken
enough laws for one evening.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wes my boy, you can never break too many laws in one evening. There are a lot of
them you know, so you'll never run out,&quot; Lia responded with a smile. She ignited the
flame thrower and headed towards the pit walking slowly so as not to have the flame blow
into her face she carefully lowered it into the pit we had dug. Willow and I exchanged a
look then turned our attention back to Lia. </p>

<p>The flame was now at full power and the fire was starting to grow. There was brief
moment then where everything seemed to be going according to plan. Then it happened, the
fire licked up really high and make a popping sound. Seconds later Lia dropped the flame
thrower and backed away from the pit. That's when I saw that part of her was on fire. She
was waving her arm around in the air trying to get the flame to go out. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, alright, this was a BAD idea,&quot; she said in a loud voice as she tried
blowing on her arm to help. </p>

<p>&quot;That's not going to work stupid,&quot; Lyndon said not making a move towards her.
&quot;Spit on it or something,&quot; he continued now moving towards her. </p>

<p>&quot;You are not spitting on me,&quot; Lia said waving her arm in front of her to ward
of Lyndon. Then she brought it back in and started blowing with renewed vigor. &quot;Okay,
this is really starting to hurt!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stop drop and roll,&quot; Xander said moving towards her. &quot;Dirt in the
skirt,&quot; he continued. </p>

<p>Lia looked at him for a split second then dropped to the ground and started rolling in
the sand. Being the good Samaritan that I am I picked up my towel and went over to her to
try and help beat out the flame. </p>

<p>&quot;It's out, good god woman it's out!&quot; Lia said rolling away from me and out of
range. Standing up she began to survey the damage done to her. The sleeve of her shirt had
completely burned away and she was slightly sooty but that seemed to be the extent of it. </p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Willow commented a moment later as Lia continued to inspect her rag.
&quot;At least the fire is going.&quot; Lia looked up at her. &quot;And it was fast,&quot;
Willow hastened to add, &quot;it was really, really, fast.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That's true,&quot; Lia said brightening up a bit. &quot;I just didn't foresee the
living flame part of it.&quot; </p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Are you worried about tomorrow?&quot; Willow asked from her spot beside me on the
bed. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I responded in what I thought to be a suitably unaffected tone. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure everything will be alright,&quot; she continued as if I hadn't said
anything. </p>

<p>&quot;I know. We're going to open up a can of whoop-ass on it's behind,&quot; I told
her picking up her hand and taking it into my own. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said seriously looking down at me. &quot;You'll do it this time,
we'll be there to back you up.&quot; </p>

<p>I looked up at her. </p>

<p>&quot;Does this mean that you're not buying my 'Cool as Oz' routine?&quot; I asked
smiling. </p>

<p>&quot;I was for a minute&#133;but then you made an expression and the jig was up,&quot;
she responded resting her head down on my shoulder. &quot;What are you worried
about?&quot; She had been working on me about talking about what I was feeling over the
past months, and I'd been trying. I had gotten better about actually telling her what was
bothering me, but it was still hard sometimes, because I didn't want to burden her with
what I was going through. She had enough to worry about without me dumping all my crap on
her. It was a lose, lose situation because I ended up hurting her whether I told her or
whether I didn't tell her. However, I had come to realize that the hurt that came from me
shutting her out was worse to her than actually knowing what I was thinking, so I tried to
do my best to be honest with her. </p>

<p>&quot;The usual,&quot; I said in a kind of half sigh. &quot;You know,&quot; I said
getting a bit off topic, &quot;just once I'd like for someone who encountered a demon to
write about how to kill it. Maybe if they didn't know for sure, they could just theorize
to help a sister out a bit. I mean it would be so much easier to hunt and kill things if I
KNEW how to kill them. That makes sense right? I mean imagine me&#133;prepared, I could
like kick some serious ass. But besides that everything is completely of the usual.&quot;
Willow placed her hand on my cheek and stroked it with her thumb as she stared at me. Her
face was contemplative and I knew what she was thinking. </p>

<p>She worried about me constantly. Not just about my physical health, but about my mental
health as well. Frankly, I've dealt with the cards handed to me rather well, but every
once in a while I do have a tendency to kind of snap and go all wiggy. I mean, over the
years I suppose I've given her cause to worry about both. </p>

<p>&quot;You don't need to hear this,&quot; I said not liking the sad look in her eyes.
She always asked, then when I told her she always got sad. It was a vicious cycle and I
hated it. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she responded. &quot;I do.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But it just upsets you,&quot; I protested not for the first time. &quot;It seems
like every time I open my mouth I make you cry. It's&#133;it's&#133;it's like I'm Wesley
or something bringing misery wherever I go,&quot; I continued avoiding her gaze. </p>

<p>&quot;I get upset because I worry about you. I can't not worry about you. I'll tell you
something, I worry more when I don't know what you're thinking, because that means that
you're keeping it all to yourself locked away. That leads to festering and breakdowns, and
unscheduled vacations,&quot; she responded. I winced at the last one, I knew that my
disappearance that past summer was still a sore spot. I had really hurt her with that one,
I had hurt them all, but it had hit Willow and Mom the most. I hadn't realized how badly I
had hurt Willow until Xander had let me have it one night and let it all out. Xander was
always there for Willow, I was glad for that. I had worried about the tension between them
when Willow and I first started dating. Xander had always been there for her and vice
versa, and I didn't want to come between that. </p>

<p>&quot;The fact that I worry about you isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing, an
unavoidable thing, or in other words a thing that can't be avoided,&quot; she continued.
&quot;You need to talk about what your feeling, and I want to listen. It's works out well
for both of us, and helps avoid the need for pharmaceuticals.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why do you have to make so much sense all the time?&quot; I asked with a smile
bringing my hand up to her face. </p>

<p>&quot;It's a gift. Sometimes it's hard, but then I just think to myself, 'Willow you
were put down on this planet for a reason, and you must fulfill that reason', and then the
tension eases,&quot; she responded with one of those beatific smiles that I absolutely
thrived on. </p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for sharing your gift with me,&quot; I told her sincerely. </p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for sharing your heart with me,&quot; she responded leaning down. When
we broke apart I smiled. The truth was I might not have a lot of life left, but I knew
that as long as I was with Willow, the time I did have left would be extraordinary. </p>
