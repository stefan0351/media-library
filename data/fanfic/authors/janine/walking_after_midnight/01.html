<p>In reality it had only been a few months since Willow and I had declared our love for
each other, embraced it, and as a result had been the happiest either of us could ever
recall being in life, but, nothing gold can last. That's how the saying goes anyway.
Happiness is fleeting, an elusive mistress, while pain is a much more loyal companion,
almost shadow like, stalking you constantly, waiting for the sun to set. The last few
months however did two things in all their horrific glory. They gave me much time to
think, and they brought Willow and I closer together. At times it seemed as if the direct
opposite would result, that the seemingly unending obstacles placed in our path would tear
us apart, but together we made it through. Still, now, at the end of it all, certain
events are hazy and unclear, as if I were viewing them through a piece of dirty glass.
Perhaps that's because I wasn't seeing them clearly at the time they were taking place, or
perhaps it's just a trick of the mind. I can't forget, so I glaze over.</p>

<p>The first hurdle had to have been when Oz tried to reconcile with Willow shortly after
our ordeal with Rio, and that was a hurdle created solely from my own imagination, my own
fears. The reconciliation was not to be, but I clearly remember my feelings during that
brief period of time. It was before the rest of the cards came tumbling down, and I
remember that I was afraid, afraid that he would succeed. Absence, I think, makes the
heart grow needier, but time, time makes it grow fonder. Back then I knew that Willow was
my crucial game piece, and she is even more so now. Quod me nutrit me destruit-what
nourishes me, destroys me. For a transient moment during the time I saw them speaking, saw
him smile at her, and her place her hand on his shoulder, I felt a tightening in my
stomach and dizziness in my head. I felt like I was dying, and I knew then with absolute
certainty just how much of me she actually owned.</p>

<p>My fears were unwarranted, unnecessary, uncalled for, and mentally I knew this all. But
love, I was quickly becoming to realize belonged not to the realm of the synapses, of the
brain. I was understanding that it was not something to be intellectualized, but to be
felt. Felt with the heart, with the spirit. That, sometimes made love irrational, even
painful, but without it the experience we call love would not be the same. Would not be
love.</p>

<p>One of the few good things to come out of these last few months was that Oz had
rejoined us. He had been informed of the recent developments, he had been cool (as usual),
and he had been a great deal of help to us. I had been surprised at how well he had taken
the news and this surprise, when commented on, blossomed into a conversation which
revealed this: To some extent he had always known that there was something special between
Willow and I. Something that he couldn't explain or even qualify, but something that he
was aware of nonetheless. He said that when all things were considered, Willow was happy
and that there was to be no fault found in that. The best man-so to speak-had won.</p>

<p>The person who devastated me so completely over these few months however, was not
Willow, or Oz, or Angel, but Faith. Faith, my sister in arms, my friend. She revealed to
me a new insight into darkness that I had never considered before, had never needed to
consider. My world of darkness is occupied with demons, and vampires, and creatures with
no soul. Creatures who were created with the sole purpose of destroying and inflicting
suffering. This being said, when the time comes to remove these creatures from the face of
the earth there is no remorse, no moral struggle. But Faith, she's a different story
altogether, for I knew the good in her, and the very, very worst. The entire situation
with the Mayor, and the ascension, and the murder revealed to me a new breeding place for
evil. This place more frightening, more disturbing than all the crypts, and fire demon
nests in the world because it's much, much closer. This place is the human soul. When the
darkness comes from there the motivations of the individual are not so easy to ascertain,
the course of action to employ not so easy to decide, the moral dilemma much more
difficult to settle. At the end of it all, as she lay in coma, broken and beaten by my own
hand, I'm still not sure what to make of her. I only know that despite everything that
happened to us, and that we had done to each other, I still considered her to be a friend,
to be my sister in arms.</p>

<p>Cordelia, Wesley, and some chick named Anya also made appearances over the past few
months, but that's pretty much all there is to say about them. Mother always said that if
you didn't have anything nice to say you should at least have the decency to be vague.</p>

<p>The school year had ended, the birds were chirping, pretty much everyone made it
through graduation alive, and the demons seemed to be on vacation-at least for the time
being. After the ascension fiasco Wesley was summoned back to England, Cordelia and her
family were getting ready to move, Oz and the band were heading down to L.A to try and get
some exposure, and&#133;well, I'm not really sure where Anya went.</p>

<p>Basically what was left of the gang and I had a summer of bumming around, and loitering
to look forward to, and to me, that was okay. Giles however had other ideas.</p>

<p>&quot;We're going where?&quot; I asked aghast. I couldn't have heard that right, which
is to say that I must not have heard that right.</p>

<p>&quot;Camp,&quot; Giles responded calmly, as if he hadn't heard the tone of voice I had
used. But he had heard it, I knew it. &quot;The council feels&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought that I said I wasn't working for them anymore,&quot; I started. &quot;I
clearly remember stating that I wasn't working for them anymore. I spoke from the
diaphragm, and there was discussion that ended in me stating that I was not working for
them anymore. Has everyone forgotten this?&quot; I continued looking around at my peeps
for support.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I mention that the camp was in Bermuda?&quot; Giles asked conversationally.
&quot;It must have slipped my mind. But, if you're absolutely certain that you don't want
to accept the councils offer then&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When do we leave?&quot; I asked cutting off his response.</p>

<p>&quot;The tickets are for Saturday morning at 9:00am, but the time can be changed if
that poses a problem for any of you,&quot; Giles answered semi-smugly. He knew I would
cave and cave I did.</p>

<p>&quot;Padres?&quot; I asked turning to look at the assembled Scoobs. I was greeted by
four wiggling thumbs pointed in the direction of up. &quot;Saturday is fine,&quot; I
responded. How could I say no to such cute hope filled faces? &quot;I assume this includes
rooms, and board&#133;and petty cash?&quot; I asked. If they wanted to buy me back I could
as well make them work for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Giles responded. I knew that he was going to go into office
immediately after and check out the petty cash thing. The council would probably say no at
first-like they always did-but I was sure Giles would get us some moola.</p>

<p>&quot;I would just like to note, that I recognize this for what it is,&quot; I
responded pointing at Giles.</p>

<p>&quot;And what might that be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absentee Council Syndrome,&quot; I responded. &quot;It's a new spin on the
classic 'Absentee Parent Syndrome'. When the parent, or in this case 'council', realizes
that they have been neglecting their child, or in this case 'Slayer', they lavish them
with gifts, and trips to tropical islands&#133;and cars,&quot; I added the 'cars' part in
at the end. It was worth a shot, fighting evil would be easier with wheels. I mean, every
superhero had wheels, or the ability to fly, or something equally as cool. All I had was a
BMX&#133;and it was rusting.</p>

<p>&quot;Does this mean you don't want to go?&quot; Giles asked tilting his head to side
in that way dogs do when they're curious.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah&#133;right,&quot; I responded guffawing. I always wanted to go to Bermuda,
it reminded me of the Beach Boys. Bermuda, and Cocco.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well then,&quot; Giles responded. &quot;I suggest the two of you,&quot; he
continued looking at Xander and Willow, &quot;try to fabricate some suitable tale to tell
your parents,&quot; he finished then headed into his office.</p>

<p>&quot;So we're going to Bermuda?&quot; Xander asked once Giles was out of hearing
range.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks that way my friend,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha, and to think they laughed and scoffed at the 'Jean Machine' when I bought
that blue and purple Haiiwian shirt. For you see, they doubted me and my choice in
clothing, but now, now they'll be chew, chew, chewing on that, 'cause every shirt has it's
day and mine has arrived,&quot; Xander said dreamily. I could almost hear him mentally
mocking the sales people.</p>

<p>&quot;Xander that's not why they were laughing at you at the Jean Machine,&quot; Willow
started to say before Xander interrupted her.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes it was Willow. Yes it was,&quot; he said suddenly serious, as he looked
directly into her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Righhhhttttt,&quot; Willow said drawing out the word. &quot;My bad,&quot; she
continued. Xander nodded seemingly pleased with that response and headed over to where he
had left the homework he wasn't going to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I miss something?&quot; I asked leaning over and whispering in Willow's ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Willow said smiling. &quot;When we went shopping Xander&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what's going on over there?&quot; Xander asked suspiciously looking up.
&quot;How many times do I have to tell you,&quot; he said whining, &quot;it was the shirt!
The shirt!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Xander. It was the shirt,&quot; Willow responded soothingly.</p>

<p>&quot;It was the shirt,&quot; he muttered turning back to whatever it was he was doing.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you later,&quot; Willow whispered back deviously a moment later as she
leaned back into me. Once again Xander looked back at us skeptically and glared for a
moment.</p>

<p>&quot;It was the shirt and nothing but the shirt,&quot; I said putting my hands up.
Apparently, we had hit a nerve with the accuracy of a surgeon, and it was kinda fun
playing with it.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I don't know how Giles did it, but he did, and for it he received multiple huggings
from all. We had gotten ourselves a petty cash budget and we were going to blow half of it
at the mall buying beach wear and other vacation necessities. That was the great thing
about school ending-well besides the whole not having to go to school thing-all the time,
was all your time. It was noon, we were in the mall, and if all things went according to
plan we wouldn't leave until they kicked us out. That, or until we found everything we
needed.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; Willow said checking the list. &quot;What's next?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beach balls!&quot; Xander piped up from behind her. &quot;I say we get the
rainbow colored kind, cause they're the prettiest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty spherical objects coming right up,&quot; I said from my position beside
him. I had been standing by Willow but I had to move when Xander came in behind or I would
have been squished between them. Not that that would have been all that bad.</p>

<p>While we at the 'Beach Emporium', or whatever the store was called, we decided to take
a look at bathing suits, and beach towels. They were after all essential elements to beach
life.</p>

<p>&quot;Will,&quot; I started slowly eyeing the towel she was holding critically.
&quot;Are you sure you want to buy that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, look,&quot; she said pointing at it. &quot;It's all colorful, which was
part of the criteria, and it's got a guy fishing on it. Look, he's so happy because he's
fishing, and he likes fishing, and he's got his rod out and he's just fishing away. See
that smile? That's a fishing smile,&quot; she continued smiling. She looked so happy I
didn't want to spoil it, but I couldn't let her buy that towel. It would have led to ruin.</p>

<p>&quot;Will, that's not a rod he's holding. At least not a fishing rod,&quot; I said
trying not to smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure it is,&quot; she responded looking at the towel a bit more closely.
&quot;It's just a short one&#133;Ohmygod&#133;&quot; she squeaked dropping the towel and
jumping away from it. &quot;That's disgusting, they can't put stuff like that on a towel
and make people think that he's fishing, when he's not fishing. He was soooo not
fishing!&quot; she exclaimed. The whole display was too cute. I would never say that
though cause she'd go and throw a hissy fit that I would find equally as cute and I would
only end up digging myself a bigger grave.</p>

<p>&quot;He was happy though,&quot; I said smiling. It always paid to look at the glass as
half full.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll bet,&quot; she said looking down at the towel a meter or so from her feet
with contempt.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't we move on,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Swim wear sound good?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said quickly forgetting all about the towel. She started shifting
her gaze between me and the change rooms and I eyed her suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;You just want to molest me in the change rooms, don't you?&quot; I asked
smirking. I knew her so well, and I knew this.</p>

<p>&quot;What if I did?&quot; she asked giving me that sexy 'come hither' smile. I loved
the sexy 'come hither' smile, I really did. I always hithered.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd say, what are we waiting for?&quot; I responded. We looked at each other for
a moment then practically ran to the change rooms. I loved shopping.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;What took you two so long?&quot; Xander asked when we finally met him outside the
store.</p>

<p>&quot;Faulty hinge,&quot; I said shrugging. I didn't really know what that meant, but
that's what came out of my mouth so I'd have to stick with it, dumb as it was.</p>

<p>&quot;Faulty hinge?&quot; he asked. He didn't seem convinced, I couldn't imagine why.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Okaaayyyy,&quot; he said drawing out the word. &quot;Where to next?&quot; he
asked a moment later.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Willow said digging around in her pocket.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked though I could just sense where this was going.</p>

<p>&quot;I left the list in the change room,&quot; she said blushing slightly obviously
thinking about what we had been doing in the change room. She had actually been holding
the list when we went in and we were kind of in a hurry so I doubt we would have been able
to find the list anyway. I had probably chucked it somewhere&#133;somewhere far.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; was what I said in response to her statement however. I think that it
went without saying that we could not go back into that change room. &quot;No prob, we'll
just wing it. How hard could vacation shopping be?&quot; I asked shrugging my shoulders.
Theoretically the worst of it should have been over already anyway.</p>

<p>By the end of that day I vowed to never, ever in life, to ask how hard something could
be again. Never, ever.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>After our interesting adventures at the mall we headed back to my house to do nothing.
We figured that maybe something was on TV, but if there wasn't anything on we'd maybe play
a game. Or, if we didn't feel like that we'd just look through the yearbook and make fun
of people we didn't like. Or, if we didn't feel like doing that either we'd maybe just sit
there. Sufficed to say, we didn't have any concrete plans.</p>

<p>Willow and I were on the big couch, while Xander was off to the side in the recliner. I
was using Willows lap as a pillow, as we lounged in the family room watching Ally McBeal.
I had never really considered myself to be a snuggler, in fact B.W (before Willow), I
probably would have considered myself an anti-snuggler. What I was realizing though, was
that I was a snuggler when I was with the right person, and I kinda liked it. As we
lounged around we commented on how nuts all the characters on the show were until we
realized that it was pretty much a given and not really worth discussion. The principle
behind it was identical to the reason why we no longer discussed the oddity that was our
lives.</p>

<p>My mom came home shortly before the episode finished and proceeded to completely ruin
it by talking through the whole thing. She was trying to find out how our day had gone or
something. After a series of grunts met her first query, she decided to move onto greener
pastures. Basically to sum up, she ruined any chance I had of finding out if Ling won her
lawsuit.</p>

<p>&quot;How did the two of you manage to convince your parents to let you go?&quot; she
asked directing her next question at Willow and Xander. I didn't bother moving off of
Willow when she came into the room, there were other places for her to sit, and she was
fine with Willow and I being together. In fact after the initial shock wore off she was
actually pleased. She liked Willow, she thought she was a good influence on me. I wasn't
so sure about that but if it made mom feel better then who was I argue. Truthfully, my
mother was a pretty cool individual, which was tough on me because when people were
bitching about their parents I couldn't really say anything about her.</p>

<p>&quot;We told them that, ad;klv jieh!a dkjfd bobe,&quot; Willow and Xander responded
together having completely deteriorated into gibberish after the word 'that'. Mom looked
down at me to see if I could translate. I simply shrugged then stared back at her. That
was always a wise course of action.</p>

<p>&quot;Come again?&quot; she asked once she realized that I was going to be of
absolutely no use.</p>

<p>&quot;We told them that *cough* it was something *cough* that had to do with *cough*
*cough* thegalleryandthatyouwerepayingforusbothtogosothatwecouldactasgophers *cough*
,&quot; Xander responded looking at his hands for the entire time.</p>

<p>&quot;You what?&quot; she asked her voice squeaking a little. I was actually impressed
that she had managed to decipher what he had said with all that coughing, and the highly
caffinated speech patterns. Willow and Xander hung their heads slightly and turned towards
me. They wanted a bail out, and it was my intrinsic duty to provide one. She was my mother
after all.</p>

<p>&quot;You are going out of town for the week we'll be gone,&quot; I said stressing the
word 'are'. &quot;It was the only way their parents would let them go. Not all parents are
as understanding, and kind as yourself,&quot; I continued plastering a look so sweet it
could rot teeth across my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy&#133;&quot; she started to say looking down at me with that mom 'I am not
convinced' look.</p>

<p>&quot;Please,&quot; I said. I sounded like I was begging and I was. She still looked
unconvinced however.</p>

<p>&quot;Please,&quot; Willow and Xander said in stereo each matching the pitiful puppy
dog face I had on mine.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; she agreed a moment later. The combination of three adorable faces
looking at her beseechingly was too much for her to resist. &quot;But if you get into any
trouble, I am 'so' telling your parents,&quot; she continued mocking the way myself and
millions of other teenagers said the word 'so'.</p>

<p>&quot;Trouble?&quot; I asked. &quot;I know not thy face,&quot; I continued. She looked
down at me for moment and then sighed. She actually did that a lot, I guess I'm an
exasperating kind of kid. Oh, well.</p>

<p>&quot;The things I do for love,&quot; she muttered standing up. She walked over and
gave me a kiss on the forehead before heading out of the room shaking her head. If I was a
less secure individual I would have had major issues with my mother kissing me in front of
a friend, not to mention my girlfriend, but since she had just saved our asses I decided I
would be mature about it and not start wiping at face going 'ewwww'.</p>

<p>&quot;That was&#133;easy,&quot; Willow commented once we were sure she was gone.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I responded slowly. And we all sat there, thinking.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Saturday approached quickly which was just fine with me. Everyday between the day Giles
told us and Saturday had just been filler. I was ready to go. We arrived at Willow's house
first around 6:00am, or at least I think it was around six, I was curled up in the front
seat of the car sleeping. After we got Willow's stuff all set up in the trunk-or whatever
you call them in jeeps-I went into the back with Willow and curled up and went to sleep
back there. And, somewhere in between that and arriving at the airport, we picked up
Xander.</p>

<p>We met Giles at the end of a line that had to have been started sometime in the 19th
century. When we got to him I couldn't even see the beginning the line. While Giles headed
over to where my mom was waiting the rest of us used the opportunity to drop our bags.
Xander and Willow started fighting for leaning room on the pillar near us, while I turned
to observe my mother and Giles. The two of them, together, had made me nervous since that
candy incident. It was just too disturbing for thought. And finding out that they had
slept together, twice, on the hood of a police car had nearly made me go loco. It had a
chillingly high ick factor.</p>

<p>&quot;Are they in separate rooms Mr. Giles?&quot; my mother asked in what she assumed
was a voice low enough for me not to hear. She assumed wrong, I have ears like a hawk, I
heard and I glared at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes of course,&quot; Giles responded in a tone that said 'not to worry I've
got it all under control'. I glared at him too after that.</p>

<p>Luckily, we got through the baggage check sometime before the millenium. The lady who
was doing the luggage check, and ticket identification took an extra long time when it
came to us because she thought Giles was cute, and that if she spent enough time telling
us what the weather was like in the Bahamas (even though we were going to Bermuda) was she
would get lucky. Then when Giles turned away for a moment Xander told her he was gay and
we got through the rest of the process in a snap.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>All I have to say is that first class is a wondrous, magical place, full of chairs big
enough for two, and more than enough leg room in between rows, for people who are as tall
as I wished I was, to sit comfortably. It was also a place that I would never again visit
in life, and I intended to make the most of while I was there.</p>

<p>&quot;I still don't see why we couldn't go to the gift shop,&quot; Xander grumbled as
he stowed away his bag in the overhead compartment.</p>

<p>&quot;All that was in the gift shop was five dollar gum, and ten dollar key
chains,&quot; I responded slipping into the window seat. &quot;Wouldn't you rather pay
five bucks for Caribbean gum, instead of your run of the mill Yankee Bazooka Joe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ho, ho, that's very funny. Five bucks for Caribbean gum, Bazooka Joe, very droll
indeedy,&quot; Xander said laughing in a sarcastically jovial way. I smiled at his
response then turned to look out the window as Willow settled into the seat next to me.
Xander and Giles were seated across the aisle. I knew that Giles was going to kill me for
subjecting him to all of this quality time with Xander but I couldn't give up any
opportunity to be alone, or slightly alone with Willow. Besides, I actually think that
they were starting to bond, hopefully.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure that in flight attends were seriously considering asking the airline
to reconsider the companies policy on the distribution of complimentary peanuts by the
time we were finished with them. Our first offense was having a competition to see who
could horde the most peanuts. This then branched out into seeing who could actually open
the bags of peanuts they had apprehended. I'm ashamed to say that it was not I who
succeeded. Neither was it Xander or Willow though, so it wasn't too bad. The three of us
eventually had to hang our heads in shame as passed our bags over to Giles to open them,
then thank him as he passed them back. It was really very sad, very, very sad. However,
once we got over that, the peanuts then became flying projectiles to be used in the civil
war launched by Willow and I against the country of Penisalvenia (otherwise known as
Xander's pants). What nuts were left at the end of that were now being used by Xander to
answer some question Willow had asked about four way stops that I probably failed on my
written test.</p>

<p>&quot;No, but you're in like a circle&#133;&quot; Willow had started to say.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you're not in a circle, you're at a four way stop,&quot; Xander responded
shaking his head as he pointed to peanuts.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, you're in a square like perimeter, but still who has the right of way,
because everyone's like to the right of someone but whose more to the right then the
others who are also&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; Xander said cutting her off. &quot;Think of it this way, four cars
come to a stop at a culdasack,&quot; he continued as he moved the peanuts around on his
tray table. &quot;You're a car, and I'm a car&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>I watched the display for a few more seconds before turning my full attention to Willow
gazing. It was quickly becoming one of my favorite pass times. We hadn't had much time to
spend alone together since the incident with Rio and I realized that I missed just holding
her, looking at her, and being alone with her as much as I missed being able to make love
to her, and have her make love to me. As I sat there watching her bad poetry started to
float through my head and I realized why I was a vampire slayer and not a poet. 'Roses are
red, violets are blue, Willow loves me, and I love her too' was the kind of crap I was
coming up with. It was almost as scary as the demons we fought!</p>

<p>Sometime while I was watching her I must have fallen asleep, because the next thing I
became aware of was being the victim of incessant pummeling. Wincing slightly I opened my
eyes and turned my head to see Willow excitedly whacking me. Sometimes the girl really
didn't know her own strength.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked moving out of range.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, look, look,&quot; she said pointing at the screen. &quot;She looks exactly
like you,&quot; she continued. &quot;Only skankier,&quot; she added as an after thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Skankier?&quot; I asked stressing the 'ier' part. &quot;Are you implying that I
have a skank quotient to be 'ier'ed?&quot; I continued raising an eyebrow. Willow simply
stared at me for a moment looking like a deer caught in headlights. I let her squirm for a
few seconds before letting her off the hook. &quot;Either way, I suppose there is a slight
resemblance,&quot; I allowed.</p>

<p>&quot;Slight?&quot; Willow asked as if it was one of the most absurd things she had
ever heard. &quot;She's like your twin. If you were to be cloned it would look exactly
like that, if you were suddenly to be split into two individual entities the other one
would look exactly like that. If&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what you're saying is that she looks like me?&quot; I asked cutting her off.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she responded. &quot;Only with brown hair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there you go. She can't be my twin. I'm a natural blond,&quot; I responded
pleased with my own logic. Actually the resemblance I possessed to her did border on
freaky.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said grinning sexily. I looked over at her meeting her gaze for
a moment before having the good grace to blush then look away. I knew how she knew, and
she knew that I knew how she knew, and I knew that she knew that I knew how she knew
and&#133;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Xander called in loud whisper interrupting my thoughts. &quot;Zip it.
Zip it real good,&quot; he continued. &quot;This is the best part.&quot; Returning my gaze
to the screen I watched as the brunette me leaned forward and kissed the girl opposite to
her on the blanket. I watched as they kissed, while at the same time quasi-wondering if it
was wrong for the display to be making me randy. It was positively Freudian, and I
suddenly felt bad for teasing Willow about the situation she had been placed in with her
vamp-self. When the two on the screen finally separated Xander looked back over at me and
started to speak again. &quot;Hey, Buff, not only does she look like you but
she&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't finish that sentence Xander. Just don't,&quot; I said leaning back in the
chair. Getting of off this flight was going to be fun.</p>

<p>As I watched the various pieces of luggage move by me slowly I thought back to when we
left the plane. I was right, getting off had been an interesting experience. Someone had
actually asked me for my autograph. It could have gone worse though, they could have
wanted to see a reenactment. Hearing my name being called spastically I reached out and
picked up Xander's suitcase. I considered flinging it at him then decided that I would be
nice and gently rest it by him. I had two grown men as travelling companions and I got
stuck with luggage duty. How did that work into the karmic cycle?</p>

<p>As we approached the van that would be escorting us 'camp' I felt a cold chill run down
my spine, and was suddenly filled with apprehension.</p>

<p>&quot;No&#133;&quot; I whispered just loud enough that Willow who was walking beside me
could hear.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; she asked keeping her voice just as low and moving closer to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Please God, no&#133;&quot; was all I said in response as I stared at the van. It
couldn't be&#133;Giles would have said something. Wouldn't he?</p>

<p>&quot;Ah&#133;good of you to make it. I was starting to worry that Mr. Giles report of
the three of you joining us was merely wishful thinking,&quot; came the dreaded voice from
inside the doorway of the van. Some people brought happiness wherever they went, and
others whenever they went. He was one of those people from column B. I had been happy when
he had gone, but now he was back, and I was the opposite of happy.</p>

<p>&quot;Wesley,&quot; I said smiling slightly, I think.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, come aboard then, we've got a schedule to maintain you know. A prompt girl,
is a popular girl,&quot; he responded waving us in.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll have to remember that one,&quot; I said quickly moving past him and towards
the back of the van. He seemed like one of those front seat people, so I was going to get
as far away as humanly possible while still being in the same vehicle.</p>

<p>&quot;Who knew the British could be such sneaky bastards,&quot; Xander commented taking
the seat to the right of me while Willow took the left one. &quot;The G-man knew all about
this and kept mum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kept mum?&quot; I asked quizzically turning to look at him. He had definitely
been spending to much time around Giles. Way too much time around Giles.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, kept mum. I've been expanding my vocabulary, trying to better myself,&quot;
Xander responded huffing slightly. Apparently the incident at the Jean Machine, and his
new found vocabulary were off limits.</p>

<p>&quot;Well what are we going to do now that he's here?&quot; Willow asked looking up to
the front of the van then looking away before eye contact could be made.</p>

<p>&quot;Three words: avoid, avoid, avoid,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;That's actually one word repeated three times,&quot; Xander pointed out. My
response was merely to stare at him until he looked away and was quiet again. Three words,
one word repeated three times, the word three was still in there somewhere and that's what
really mattered.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, sweet lord,&quot; Willow whispered repeatedly as she dropped her bags
down at my the door then walked a little further into the room before collapsing on the
bed. We were staying at the Cambridge Beaches cottage colony in Sandys parish. The place
was very nice, but more importantly very remote, which made it the perfect place for our
little group to be staying. Basically it consisted of about forty cottage units spread out
across beautiful grounds, and one central compound that served as a sort of base of
operations.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Will, it wasn't that bad&quot; I responded dropping my bag next to hers
then moving over to join her on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;He was a worse driver than you,&quot; Willow said as if that explained
everything. I was slightly offended. So I sometimes forgot to look at the road, and I had
gotten into one minor collision. That didn't mean I was a bad driver, just that I was
surrounded by bad drivers and had a short attention span.</p>

<p>&quot;I think that was uncalled for,&quot; I responded turning to face her. I mean the
van guy swerved into on coming traffic and nearly drove us into a rock-face. Surely I
wasn't that bad.</p>

<p>&quot;You turned onto an off ramp,&quot; Willow reminded me looking over in my
direction. I had forgotten about that.</p>

<p>&quot;One little miscalculation and I'm branded for life,&quot; I said throwing up my
hands. &quot;You burn down one little school, and turn the wrong way on one little off
ramp and nobody lets you forget about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I still love you even if you can't drive,&quot; Willow said rolling over so that
she was straddling my waist and looking down at me.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you too Little Tree,&quot; I said smiling as she stuck her tongue out at
me. I was about to pull a switcharoo and secure my position as queen of the castle when
there was a knock at the door. Once Willow had removed herself from on top of me I went
over to answer it. &quot;Giles,&quot; I mouthed back to her rolling my eyes. &quot;Make
yourself presentable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To what do I owe this pleasure?&quot; I asked Giles once I opened the door.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm looking for Willow,&quot; Giles responded still standing outside the door. I
was blocking his entrance. Once I had gotten my room key we kind of ran away from him.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow you say,&quot; I said stepping to the side to block him. &quot;What makes
you think she's here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Besides your paddle ball routine?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Busted,&quot; I responded stepping back so that he could enter the room.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you might be interested in knowing where your room was,&quot; he said
walking over to Willow who was lounging against the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Nah, I like it here,&quot; Willow said.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure you do, it's very quaint, but you're room is identical. And if it's the
company you're worried about, I'm sure that Buffy will let you visit,&quot; Giles
responded. &quot;This way please.&quot; In response Willow simply stared at him like he
was speaking some foreign language. When he failed to get a reaction besides that from her
he turned to me for help.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked helplessly. &quot;Of the three of us here, you think I'm the
boss of her?&quot; Even if I had wanted her to go, which I didn't, I couldn't make her go.
Willow had a mind of her own and was able to make it up free of any direction from me.</p>

<p>&quot;Children, please,&quot; Giles responded looking imploringly between the two of
us.</p>

<p>&quot;If it's far I'm coming back,&quot; Willow said pushing herself off the desk a
moment later.</p>

<p>&quot;I assure you that you'll hardly have to walk at all,&quot; Giles responded
heading back towards the door with Willow in tow after she picked up her bags.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I come?&quot; I asked bring up the rear. Giles merely sighed and continued
out the door. Grabbing my room key, I closed the door behind me then joined Willow and
Giles who were waiting on the pathway outside the door. The only way to get from room to
room was by going outside or through connecting doors. I had expected some kind of motion
when I joined them, either left or right, but we simply remained where we were.
&quot;What?&quot; I asked finally. &quot;Did you forget to bring the map?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is it,&quot; Giles responded handing the room key over to Willow.</p>

<p>&quot;You're joking right?&quot; she asked looking at the number on the key.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm beginning to wish that I was,&quot; Giles responded. &quot;We meet poolside
for tea in an hour. Don't be late,&quot; he added then headed down the walkway.</p>

<p>&quot;What room are you in?&quot; I asked moving beside her. The look of disbelief on
her face was usually reserved for Xander&#133;and occasionally Cordelia.</p>

<p>&quot;18,&quot; she said smiling. I smiled back, I was in 17.</p>

<p>&quot;Who would have thought the British were such sneaky bastards?&quot; I asked
mirroring Xander's earlier comment. Willow smiled and opened the door. Walking in we both
looked for the same thing, and found it a moment later. The wondrous adjoining door.
&quot;Two for the price of one,&quot; I commented as Willow tossed her bags to the side.</p>

<p>&quot;We've still got an hour to kill,&quot; she said sitting on the bed. &quot;What's
to do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You,&quot; I responded closing in on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Me?&#133;.Oh, me,&quot; she managed to get out before my lips descended upon
hers. For long moments I stood there leaning over kissing her gently, tasting her,
reveling in it. It had seemed like so long since we had had a quiet moment like this, just
the two of us together with no interruptions, no demons on our heels, and no rouge Slayers
to occupy our minds. I had missed it so much, and now that we were here like this I didn't
want to let go.</p>

<p>When we finally broke apart she pulled back and looked at me for a moment before
carefully pulling me down onto the bed beside her. She took my hand and kissed the palm
first, then the wrist, and then all the way up the rest of my arm before returning her
lips to mine. We kissed slowly at first, almost chastely. It wasn't so much one kiss as a
myriad of tiny ones, merging together. We continued in this fashion for what could have
been seconds or minutes, wanting it all to last forever, but eventually the kiss became
more passionate and our breathing soon quickened, harmonizing as we sought to consume one
another completely. Willow brought her hands to my shoulders pushing on them gently until
I was lying on my back, then she draped her body over mine and started to run her hands
over body, all the while never breaking the kiss. I liked it when we were like this, her
body on top of mine, covering every inch of me. It made me feel safe, loved completely,
every square inch. I slid my hands up her sides caressing her as I removed her shirt,
loving her all the way with my hands and tongue. She did the same to me, slowly,
deliberately. There were no words exchanged between the two of us, there were none needed,
not at this time. We were beyond that, I knew what she needed, what she wanted, just like
she knew what I did. There was no thought remaining within either of us except for the
sweet, breathless, fluttering excitement sweeping us up and pulling us together again, and
again as me moved against each other. With each other. She was my world, and I was hers.
Together we rocked, together we kissed, together we climbed. And it was beautiful, just as
she was, and just as she made me. Together, we were beauty.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>We made it poolside with four minutes to spare. Not bad if I did say so myself. We
spotted Xander over by the food line and headed over.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the what?&quot; I asked moving in behind him.</p>

<p>&quot;Not much,&quot; he responded grabbing a croissant. &quot;Got unpacked, took a
nap, fell in love, tried to hook the movie box up and got zapped,&quot; he continued
moving along.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I tried to hook up the movie box and got zapped. Do not ask me how, for I know
not,&quot; he responded.</p>

<p>&quot;I think she was referring to that love part,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; was all he said in response.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, dish it out. You know about our love lives, it's only fair to
share,&quot; I said poking him in the ribs.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Willow said teasingly. &quot;What's her name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evangelia,&quot; he said blushing slightly. Sometimes Xander was just too cute
for words.</p>

<p>&quot;Xander and Lia sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g&#133;&quot; Willow singsonged
happily. She was finally getting some material to tease him back with. After he had
stopped wiggin about the two of us being together he had embarked upon a quest to tease
Willow as much as was humanly possible. I was sure if he made one more crack about her
going over to my house for 'dessert' she was going to snap.</p>

<p>&quot;Shhh,&quot; Xander responded. &quot;She'll hear you,&quot; he continued looking
around.</p>

<p>&quot;Which one is she?&quot; I asked looking around the patio area. There were about
thirty people milling about, watchers, Slayers in training, and Slayerettes.</p>

<p>&quot;Over there,&quot; he said jerking his head in what was suppose to be an
inconspicuous motion. If she had seen him she wouldn't have known he was pointing at her,
she just would have thought he had some horrible tick.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it with you and Slayers?&quot; I asked not for the first time. The girl
was indicating was standing off to the side near the waterfall. She was tall,
dark-skinned, very beautiful. For some reason the term Nubian princess kept popping into
my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it my fault you're all dollsome?&quot; he asked. I had no response to that.
&quot;That's what I thought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhh, look,&quot; Willow said as we exited the food line. &quot;It's got our
names on it. Well it's got Buffy's name on it&#133;kind of,&quot; she amended. I looked
over to where her gaze was. The sign read: Bufee</p>

<p>&quot;I get no respect I tell ya, none,&quot; I said looking at the thing. &quot;As if
my name was flaky enough already they had to go and dork it up even more,&quot; I
continued shaking my head. There was no justice.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come on Boof-fee, it's not that bad,&quot; Xander said grinning as he made
his way over to the table.</p>

<p>Once everyone was seated we had to listen to some old guy drone about the importance of
teamwork or something like that for like half an hour. He had one of those Chef Boyardee
mustaches and it kept moving around in all kinds of distracting ways as he spoke. The only
thing that was missing was his Colonel Klink eyepiece and riding boots. The gist of his
whole little speech seemed to be that us Slayers would live longer if we worked as a
collective, and the next week was being set up to help us 'be the most productive units we
could be'.</p>

<p>&quot;So, who's the competition?&quot; I asked once Chef Klink sat down and we were
left to nurse our orange juices before appetizers were served.</p>

<p>&quot;Virtually every female you see here is competition,&quot; Giles responded,
&quot;But the only one who posses any challenge to you is one Evangelia Grayson, she's
seated over there,&quot; Giles said pointing to Xander sweetie. &quot;She being toted as,
ah, the next Buffy Summers,&quot; Giles continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you mean Bufee?&quot; Xander asked before snapping a bread stick in two.</p>

<p>&quot;The new me?&quot; I asked ignoring him. &quot;Nobody needs a new me. The old me,
is still here and doing just fine,&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;That's not what they mean exactly,&quot; Giles said trying to calm me down.
&quot;They just mean that the two of you share certain characteristics which have proven
to make you a great Slayer, and they hope means the same for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So they're saying that she's a tall younger version of me,&quot; I stated my
anxiety level not having lowered at all.</p>

<p>&quot;That's not what I meant,&quot; Giles responded rubbing his brow.</p>

<p>&quot;How far down the line is she?&quot; Willow asked saving Giles from having to
complete his answer.</p>

<p>&quot;She's the next in line. When&#133;well, she's the next in line,&quot; Giles
responded changing his answer half way through. We all knew that he was about to say 'when
Faith dies', but none of us could find fault with him changing his answer. It wasn't a
particularly nice thought for any of us, despite what she had done, and especially for me
considering the part I had played in moving Evangelia up in that line.</p>

<p>Thankfully the appetizers came along soon after that preventing us from having to
pursue that line of thought.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>The council wastes no time, and half an hour after dessert was served we moved on to
the first structured activity of the week. Beach sparing. Apparently the Slayers parts in
the camp activities would be more physical than the others. I didn't know who I was up
against, only that I was in the last drawing, so the gang and I found a quiet place to sit
on the beach and watched the others go at it.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy Summers and Evangelia Grayson,&quot; called the master of ceremonies, or
whatever he was.</p>

<p>&quot;Wish me luck,&quot; I muttered as I stood up and made my way over to the pit.</p>

<p>We entered at approximately the same time and walked towards the center, stopping a
meter apart. We looked at each other for a moment, her down and me up before she stuck her
hand out.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm Evangelia, but everyone calls me Lia. It's a pleasure to meet you,&quot; she
said with a lopsided grin on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;It's shared,&quot; I responded grasping her hand and shaking. &quot;My name's
Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. You're quite the legend around here. You've become the model we've all
got to live up to. Not big, but certainly formidable shoes to step into,&quot; she
responded.</p>

<p>&quot;From what I've heard you've been doing a good job of it,&quot; I said. She smiled
and looked at the sand for a moment before looking back up to meet my gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess we shall soon see how accurate those reports are,&quot; she said finally.
With that the master of ceremonies handed us each a staff, and told us to take our
positions.</p>

<p>We each stepped back and held the staff half an arms length from our bodies, then
started circling each slowly. She thrust out the bottom end of her staff then pulled it
back teasingly, a smile playing across her lips. Her eyes were alight, mischievous, and I
found myself smiling back. She wanted to play, so we would. I bounced on my feet lightly
before sticking out the bottom of my staff which she blocked easily. She then thrust out
the top of her staff which I blocked easily.</p>

<p>After a few more seconds of playing around like that we began to actually spare.
Blocking, jumping, kicking, twirling. Truthfully I was impressed. She wasn't like the
other girls I had watched tonight, she didn't play by the book, she made her own rules,
had her own style. She was having fun with it. She was good, I would give her that, by far
the best present excluding me. We continued fighting for a few minutes, each looking for
an opening, finally I found one when she dropped her left hand, and after a few quick
moves her staff was in my hand and she was lying on her back in the sand.</p>

<p>She raised herself into a sitting position then stood up fully. Once she was upright
she made a fist with her right hand and laid it against the palm of her left then bowed
down.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like I've still got some work to do,&quot; she said grinning, then she
turned around and made her way back to where she had come from. I handed the staffs back
to the master of ceremonies then made my way back over to the gang.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Is this not the epitome of romance?&quot; I asked Willow making a grand gesture
with my free hand. The moon was shinning, the sky was filled with stars, the waves were
lapping at the shore, and I was with Willow. What was not to love?</p>

<p>&quot;It's beautiful,&quot; she responded. &quot;I know that we've done this before at
home, but it's not the same. Hand holding and moonlight strolls are always better in
foreign places,&quot; she continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Been on many moonlight strolls in foreign places?&quot; I asked looking over at
her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm basing that generalization on this one time alone,&quot; she answered
smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;That's good enough for me,&quot; I said tilting my head back up to look at the
stars. &quot;You know what would be more romantic?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; she asked with trepidation in her voice. She knew me so well.</p>

<p>&quot;Wrestling in the surf,&quot; I answered. &quot;You'd get all wet and your clothes
would cling to your taunt teenage body, and when we were through I would be left with no
option but to ravage your body with kisses right here on the shore,&quot; I continued
pointing to the spot where the ravaging would take place.</p>

<p>&quot;That almost made me want to say yes,&quot; she responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a no?&quot; I asked pouting.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a yes?&quot; I asked hopefully.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; She responded. I pouted again and kicked at the sand with my foot.
&quot;If it makes you feel better when we get back to the room I'll get in the shower with
my clothes on and you can ravage me then,&quot; she offered no doubt in response to my
crestfallen look.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not the same,&quot; I said pulling her along as we started to walk again.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not? Either way I'm wet and clingy. It sounds entirely same to me,&quot; she
responded. I could have said something totally inappropriate in response to that, but I
didn't, I controlled myself..</p>

<p>&quot;The romance factor just isn't there. There has to be stars, and sand, and some
old guy on the fifth floor with binoculars watching,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;A pedophile with binoculars adds to romance factor?&quot; she asked clearly not
convinced.</p>

<p>&quot;Well not when you put it like that,&quot; I agreed. Perhaps I hadn't made my
argument very clear. &quot;Spontaneity is romantic. We're suppose to just throw caution to
wind and make mad passionate love where we stand. The world be damned, because the fire we
feel for each other cannot be extinguished but for the cool of the ocean and feel of each
other,&quot; I said trying again.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a much more convincing argument,&quot; she said. &quot;I was moved,
there were words and they moved me. It was very poetic really&#133;&quot; she continued,
but I interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;Prophetic,&quot; I corrected.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I think poetic was the right word. Prophetic would mean that&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was some sort of foretelling that was about to come true,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly, and &#133;.Buffy&#133;what are you&#133;Buffy&#133;no this
isn't&#133;funny&#133;Buffy&#133;&quot; she started to protest but it fell upon deaf ears.
We were going to frolic in the surf and she was going to like it, so it was predicted and
so it shall be.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I was awoken by the sun shining into my eyes, and I raised one of my hands trying to
block it. Realizing that it was doing no good I shifted slightly adjusting the hold I had
on Willow until the sun was no longer shining in my eyes, and sighed happily. I probably
should have gotten us both up, but truthfully I just didn't feel like it. It had been a
long time since I had woken up with Willow in my arms and I didn't want to interrupt that
just yet. She was so very beautiful when she was asleep, her face totally relaxed, angelic
in its state of peace. I particularly loved the tiny little smile that played across her
lips, I liked wondering what she was thinking about to put it there.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh,&quot; Willow groaned turning away from the light which was now in her eyes
and further into my embrace.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Snow White, it's time to wake up and go to work with the rest of the
dwarfs,&quot; I said smiling as I ran my hand up and down her arm gently.</p>

<p>&quot;If I'm Snow White where's my kiss?&quot; she asked sleepily.</p>

<p>&quot;Right here,&quot; I said kissing her softly.</p>

<p>&quot;I still don't wanna get up,&quot; she said resting her head on my shoulder and
closing her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Will&#133;&quot; I said brushing a strand of hair out of her face. As much as I
would have enjoyed lounging the day away we did have to get up. I couldn't exactly
remember the reason just then, but there was a reason. I was sure of that.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't vacations suppose to be time in sleep&#133;I mean sleep in time?&quot; she
asked not moving.</p>

<p>&quot;Not when they're sponsored by the Old England Watchers Council,&quot; I responded
kissing the tip of her nose. &quot;Giles is going to be making his wake up calls soon, we
should probably be in our own rooms,&quot; I continued trying to get her to move.</p>

<p>&quot;Who's room are we in, anyway?&quot; she asked rolling away from me and into a
sitting position.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said looking around. &quot;I think mine.&quot; We were
definitely going to have to start paying attention to those kind of things.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Corn Flakes, or Frosted Flakes? Pancakes or Waffles? Sausage or bacon? What to
choose, what to choose&#133;&quot; Xander said as we made our way through the buffet
breakfast they had set out.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better chose wisely&#133;this could be one of the tests,&quot; I said
snagging a few pieces of watermelon and honey dew.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, if the answer's Corn Flakes, you don't want to end up with the losers who
picked Frosted Flakes, do you?&quot; Willow asked. Xander looked at her then down at the
miniature box of cereal he held in his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Frosted Flakes aren't for losers,&quot; Xander said defensively. &quot;They're
Grrrreat!&quot; Willow and I exchanged looks and continued on down the line as Xander
continued to mull over every piece of food he decided to put on his plate. At the rate he
was going he would finish about ten minutes before they were ready to serve lunch.</p>

<p>Once breakfast was finished we were informed of what our activities for the day would
be. Xander and Willow got to stay poolside playing trust games and water polo, while I was
off on what could quite possibly be another van ride from hell, only to end up in the
wilderness where I would get to wander around. Not for the first time I felt like I had
pulled the short stick. On the bright side, the exercises where only to last until five,
then we were free to do whatever we wanted.</p>

<p>As I approached the van I saw Evangelia hug the young man who had been with her every
time I saw her-except for our sparing match-before she boarded the van. It could have been
nothing, but since we would be spending the majority of the day together I decided I could
at least find out if Xander had a chance with her or not. It was the decent thing to do.</p>

<p>&quot;You look well rested. Sleep well?&quot; Lia asked as I took the seat next to her.
There were about eight girls spread out around the van.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you could say that,&quot; I said smiling. &quot;You?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't complain,&quot; she said glancing out the window and frowning slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Something the matter?&quot; I asked noticing the look.</p>

<p>&quot;No. Just not looking forward to spending the day in a place called 'Spittal
Pond',&quot; she responded sheepishly. &quot;Doesn't exactly conger up a very appealing
image.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ew&#133;&quot; I said making a face. I had never really thought about that
before. Spittal pond was Bermuda's largest nature reserve, and was suppose to be a very
beautiful place, but I had to agree that perhaps the name could have used a little work.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed smiling at the look on my face. &quot;The two people with
you,&quot; she started a moment later. &quot;Are they the infamous Xander and
Willow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Infamous,&quot; I said laughing a little. &quot;I don't know about that, but
they're definitely Xander and Willow. They're my Scoobs,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Clever,&quot; she said in response. &quot;Velma and Shaggy I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shhh, let's keep that between the two of us. Xander's always wanted to be
Scooby,&quot; I said in a hushed tone looking around. &quot;What about the handsome
stranger that's been permanently attached to your hip? He's a muffin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll make sure to tell him he's among the sweetest of the baked goods,&quot; she
said smirking. &quot;He's my brother, Lyndon. The only cute nickname I have for him is
asswipe though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet he's hoping that one doesn't catch on,&quot; I commented watching with
abject terror as the driver started the engine.</p>

<p>&quot;That's what he gets for years of sticking my head in a toilet. He's lucky I still
talk to him,&quot; she said looking out the window again.</p>

<p>&quot;It's stories like that that make me glad I'm an only child,&quot; I responded
smiling. I bet he didn't try to do that anymore.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd call you a lucky bastard, but I think that goes without saying,&quot; she
said shifting slightly trying to make herself comfortable. Sometimes it was an advantage
to be short.</p>

<p>&quot;You're a good sister,&quot; I told her smirking.</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I keep telling him,&quot; she responded finally settling into what
could only have been a semi-comfortable position. The afternoon was looking up, I figured
with Lia around it wouldn't turn out to be a total bust.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Is there going to blood involved?&quot; Lia asked sticking up her hand.
&quot;Cause, this jacket's off the rack but it was still ridiculously expensive.&quot; The
lead Watcher guy just continued with what he had been saying before she asked her
question. &quot;Was I just ignored? I'm feeling very ignored here,&quot; she said turning
to face me.</p>

<p>&quot;Bitch slapped,&quot; I confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; she said looking back up at him.</p>

<p>We were inside the nature reserve receiving the instructions for our task. The ten of
us had been split up into pairs and each given a map and clues. We were suppose to use the
map and clues and find some sort of demons nest they had set up. The first team back won,
or got a lollipop or something.</p>

<p>The clues were painfully juvenile, and the map far to accurate. We could probably have
found the nest without even reading the clues. I realized they probably wanted to ease us
into things, but this exercise was pointless. I thought that perhaps I only felt this way
because I had already been called, and had seen the real action, but Lia agreed that
activities at her girl scouts camp had been more harrowing then this. We decided that
instead of going back and being assigned another tedious task we would just wander around
and buy our own lollipops when we got back to town.</p>

<p>&quot;So you know, I figure that if they enjoy living in denial, far be it from me to
terminate their lease,&quot; Lia said shrugging as we made our way around a bend in the
path.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think that they enjoy it so much as they're totally unprepared to deal
with reality. The first time I saw a vampire I nearly had a conniption,&quot; I responded
thinking back. I hadn't wanted to believe back then either. If I had had the option of
forgetting, like they do, I probably would have too. But I didn't have that option, I
didn't have a choice.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a big scary world out there. Frankly, I think that the demons and vampires
we're born to battle are a lot less frightening than the other things out there people are
willing to accept. At least there's an easy way to deal with them,&quot; Lia responded
kicking at a pebble.</p>

<p>I was about to respond when I heard something. It sounded almost like crying, it was
very faint, but it sounded like crying.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you hear that?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she responded heading towards the sound. &quot;Sounds like crying.
You think one of the teams forgot to pack their pic-i-nic basket?&quot; she continued
mocking Yogi Bear.</p>

<p>&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; I said. The sound was getting louder, and I
figured that whoever was making it had to be behind one of the rocks to our left. I
pointed for Lia to go around on the opposite side to me just incase. When we came around
on the other side of the rock I saw a little boy curled up against the rock crying. He
looked to be around seven years old, and was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Parts of his
clothing, and skin were covered in some sort of black substance, that could have been
anything from dirt to tar. Lia started to walk over to the child so I quickly moved to
intercept her.</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful,&quot; I whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a little kid,&quot; she replied unconcerned.</p>

<p>&quot;Demons come in all shapes and forms. A little kid nearly got my mother to kill
me,&quot; I responded thinking back to MOO. Stupid, stupid acronym. &quot;Be
careful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; she called out to the boy stopping just over a meter away from him.
The boy stopped crying as hard as he had been and looked over at us sniffling a little
bit. But still he didn't say anything. &quot;My name's Lia, this is Buffy,&quot; she said
pointing to me. I gave a little smile. &quot;Are you lost? Are your mom and dad out here
looking for you?&quot; she continued moving a little closer.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; the boy said in a small voice.</p>

<p>&quot;What's your name?&quot; Lia asked finally coming to a halt next to him.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he answered again. Lia looked over at me for some kind of
answer but I had none. &quot;What are you doing out here?&quot; I asked moving in front of
the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said sniffling again.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you detecting a pattern here?&quot; I asked Lia turning away from the boy
momentarily.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she answered smirking a little. Apparently she had a warped
sense of humor. &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; she asked the boy. He seemed to consider the
question for a moment before answering.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; he answered. &quot;You got food?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I got food,&quot; Lia answered smiling. &quot;I've got a chocolate bar in
my jacket, and if you come with us we can get you some sandwiches and something to drink.
That sound good to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; the boy answered nodding.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright then Johnny my boy, let's go,&quot; she said reaching out her hand.</p>

<p>&quot;My name's not Johnny,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know that?&quot; she asked once he was upright.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't,&quot; he said continuing to hold her hand as we walked.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then from now on you're Johnny. It's better than 'kid' right?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Johnny answered. Lia smirked and looked over at me.</p>

<p>&quot;John Doe,&quot; she said in response to my unasked question.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh,&quot; I answered. The girl definitely had a warped sense of humor. I
liked it.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Long day, it had been a very long day. Once we had found little Johnny we made our way
back to the meeting spot. We told the head Watcher guy all we knew, and when the rest of
the teams made it back, Lia and I were shipped off to the hospital with Johnny. Once we
got there the doctors had questioned us about how he was when we found him, then ran some
tests on him to see what could be effecting his memory. Soon after the police arrived and
asked us basically the same questions the doctors had. The answers we had weren't much
help to either. The preliminary results of the tests the doctors had run came back just
before we left, and they didn't show any medical reason for the memory loss as far they
could tell. We had actually gotten to be pretty good friends with Johnny boy over the
afternoon and didn't want to leave, but the police had located his parents and they were
waiting to see him. The last thing I heard as we were leaving was Johnny asking his mother
who she was. It was hard for me to hear that, I can't imagine how she felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Look who's decided to grace us with her presence,&quot; Xander commented as I
made my way through the adjoining doors into Willow's room where the two of them were
lounging around.</p>

<p>&quot;Where were you?&quot; Willow asked watching my progress.</p>

<p>&quot;Hospital,&quot; I responded kicking off my shoes. There were rocks in them, they
were hurting my feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asked concerned as she scanned my body for injuries.
Xander was scanning my body too but I didn't think it was injuries he was looking at.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'm five by five,&quot; I said not even realizing what was coming out of my
mouth before it was out there. That was Faith talk. &quot;We were out on a nature walk
when we found this seven year old kid out there,&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Were they alright?&quot; Willow asked still concerned, only this time for Johnny.</p>

<p>&quot;As far as we could tell physically he was fine,&quot; I said dropping down onto
the bed. &quot;But he couldn't remember anything. Who he was, where he was from, what his
name was, nothing. The doctors think it's all mental though, a result of being lost out
there or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So&#133;he'll be alright?&quot; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, they already found his parents and everything,&quot; I said massaging my
shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;You out of commission for the night?&quot; Xander asked noticing the motion.</p>

<p>&quot;Hell no,&quot; I responded. &quot;I promised fun and partying, and fun and
partying I shall deliver.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love it when you talk like that,&quot; Xander responded smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is this party to be at?&quot; Willow asked taking over the job of massaging
my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Lia mentioned some place called Oasis. According to the locals it's suppose to be
the place to be,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, Oasis. The pool guy was telling me about that place. Let's go there,&quot;
Xander said. He was way to excited, we were missing something.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; I asked not really sure if I wanted to hear the answer.</p>

<p>&quot;It's wet T-shirt night,&quot; he responded delightedly. I didn't even have to
look back at Willow to know she was rolling her eyes right along with me. &quot;Come
on,&quot; Xander said seeing the look. &quot;Just because you two are all hen pecked
doesn't mean you should take away Xander's fun,&quot; he continued. The scary thing was
that that was his idea of sweet talking us. And we were not hen pecked!</p>

<p>&quot;What's next Xander? Strip Clubs?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;One more year,&quot; he responded dreamily as his eyes glazed over in response to
some hormonally induced fantasy.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<p>Shortly after arriving at the Oasis nightclub I came to the conclusion that a club was
a club no matter what continent you were on. Sure the furniture was in a different spot,
and the D.J's looked goofy in different-though not necessary worse ways-but when all was
considered a club was a club no matter where you were, and just like back home the
bartender spotted as a minors a mile away, so we were left cradling our cokes as we waited
for a song to come on that would allow us to get our groove on.</p>

<p>When a song with the right beat finally came on, no communication was needed. We all
knew it was time to dance. As we made our way out onto the floor I could feel the
vibrations start to move their way through me. When we found a spot big enough for the
three of us, we just started moving, the rhythm of the music, letting it dictate our
motions. As we continued to move I started to migrate over towards Willow. It wasn't a
conscious motion, something that I was even aware I was doing, she just called to me, and
I answered. This was why I loved Bronzing, why I loved dancing. For a moment, whether it
be a second or an hour, I could let go. I could forget I was the Slayer, forget that I had
a world to save, because all that mattered was the music pulsing through my veins, taking
me over, consuming me. There was no thought involved, only instinct, only feeling.</p>

<p>By the time we finally got off the dance floor we were all sweaty, but we were
energized. As we headed over to the spot we had occupied before I felt a familiar
presence.</p>

<p>&quot;You looked good out there. What was that, the jitter bug?&quot; Lia asked sliding
up beside me with that lopsided grin on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you want to see The Twist next?&quot; I asked her making a strangling
motion with my hands. She raised her hands up before responding.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I'll pass,&quot; she said glancing behind us to the bar.</p>

<p>&quot;Lyndon here?&quot; I asked. He was probably hidden in a swarm of girls.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, he's getting the goods,&quot; she responded happily.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we talking carbonated goods, or goods with a capital 'G' and a lemon
spritzer?&quot; Xander asked squeezing his way in between Lia and I.</p>

<p>&quot;Capital 'G' baby, all the way,&quot; she said grinning at him. &quot;According to
the state of Wisconsin he's twenty-one years old, and so am I. Of course we've never been
to Wisconsin&#133;actually, I'm not even sure if it is a state,&quot; she continued.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think he has a chance with her? I mean, he does have a chance I guess, but
do you think the odds are in the millions?&quot; Willow asked turning her attention to the
dance floor. Lia and Xander were out there dancing up a storm.</p>

<p>&quot;I think he may,&quot; I said smiling</p>

<p>&quot;What about the soothsayer?&quot; she asked. She was referring to Lyndon who was
somewhere in the club trying to separate a fool from his money.</p>

<p>&quot;He's her brother. Skies are clear on that front,&quot; I responded as Xander and
Lia made their way over to the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Wills, it's your turn to take a ride on the roller-coaster ride that is
I,&quot; Xander said taking her hand and pulling her up. She looked back at me for a
moment with trepidation before they disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;The man's a machine,&quot; Lia commented sitting down. &quot;What are you feeding
him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The usual grubs and berries,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's asswipe?&quot; she asked looking around. I guess that really was her
nickname for him.</p>

<p>&quot;Over by the bar trying to predict the future. Of course inflation has caused him
to have to introduce a little non-refundable fee,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;One of these days his dumbass ideas are gonna get his dumb ass thrown in
jail,&quot; she said finally spotting him.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's your watcher?&quot; I asked once she had turned back around. I hadn't
seen her with one which was odd to the say the least.</p>

<p>&quot;Sweden. Stock holders meeting,&quot; she responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Sweden?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd be surprised by the number of financial holdings the council has,&quot; she
responded. &quot;Tim's always been a book man,&quot; she added. I assumed that Tim was the
watcher in question. &quot;Here, let me do your palm,&quot; she continued a moment later.</p>

<p>&quot;Wha&#133;what?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me read your palm,&quot; she explained smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it? A family pass-time?&quot; I asked giving her my hand nonetheless.</p>

<p>&quot;We come from a long line of thieving seducers. We start with palm readings, then
a little wink wink here, and a little nudge nudge there, and next thing you know we're
inheriting estates,&quot; she said moving her finger along my palm before looking up at me
and winking.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you hitting on me?&quot; I asked only semi-jokingly. &quot;No,&quot; she
answered smiling. &quot;I come from a long line of terrific flirters, it's encoded in my
DNA.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you came from a long time of thieving seducers?&quot; I asked noticing
she was still playing with my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;The two go hand and hand, like Sigfreud and Roy,&quot; she responded. &quot;Don't
worry I would never make a pass at you with your S.O dancing mere meters away. It would be
impolite,&quot; she continued looking out onto the dance floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Xander isn't my significant other,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said smirking again. &quot;I was talking about Velma.&quot; She
continued to trace the lines of my palm as I stared at her blankly for a moment. Finally
regaining some of my motor skills I pulled my hand back and looked at her.</p>

<p>&quot;How'd you know? I mean is it that obvious?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she responded. &quot;Only to a disciple of the human condition like
myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The&#133;&quot; I started making a swishy hand movement. &quot;What was it?&quot;
I asked. I was curious to know. It wasn't that I was ashamed of being with Willow, or that
I didn't want anyone to know, that was never and would never be a problem. I was just
concerned about the fact that the depth of my feeling were displayed out there for
everyone-good or bad-to see, especially those who would use it against us. In my
profession I didn't exactly deal with the most upstanding of individuals, and I didn't
want my feeling for Willow to place her in anymore danger than they already did. Being the
friend of a Slayer was enough to put her in danger, but to be the lover of one, that just
added to it.</p>

<p>&quot;Narrow your inquiry, please?&quot; Lia responded.</p>

<p>&quot;What gave it away?&quot; I asked, this time coherently.</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing obvious, nothing that I think you can even help,&quot; she responded
thoughtfully. &quot;Someone would really have to be looking. Like I said that night on the
beach, you're kind of like our Captain Kirk, you know. The Slayer of Slayers, so I've kind
of been watching you trying to perhaps pick up some skills,&quot; she continued. &quot;I
just ended up picking up on something else too. It's&#133;well I believe it would be best
articulated in the words of the great philosopher Bonnie Raitt.&quot; I raised my eyebrows
at that one, but didn't say anything. &quot;You laugh just a little too loud, you stand
just a little too close, you stare just a little too long,&quot; she singsonged.
&quot;Does that help?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; I responded. I couldn't really help any of those things.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't worry about it. Demons aren't notoriously perceptive, and neither are
most people,&quot; she responded. &quot;You're completely forgetting the most important
question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think I'm sexy? Cause I usually get cute, people like to call me cute. Do
you think I'm cute?&quot; she asked so seriously you knew she couldn't actually be
serious.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at the moment I don't,&quot; I responded trying to hide a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take that as a yes then,&quot; she responded pleased. &quot;I'll be back,
I'm going to try and stop that Neanderthal man from pummeling my brother into the stone
age,&quot; she continued noticing the walking wall closing in on Lyndon.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;All I'm saying is that being an oracle can be very, very stressful. It's only
fair that those of us with the gift are compensated for our time and effort. I mean if I
read one of the cards wrong, or misinterpret one symbol I could ruin someone's whole life.
Very few people understand what it's like to be responsible for a burden like that,&quot;
Lyndon said as we walked down the street. It was probably the longest I had ever heard him
speak for at one time. Usually he spoke in clipped, non-committal sentences.</p>

<p>&quot;Despite the loads of crap that are flowing out of his mouth, the truly
frightening thing about his diatribe is that his 'predictions' are usually
semi-correct,&quot; Lia said when her brother had stopped talking.</p>

<p>&quot;The words of a higher wisdom are not, I repeat not flowing crap, you
blasphemer,&quot; Lyndon shot back.</p>

<p>&quot;Was it that higher power that told you to introduce a service charge, too? What's
next shipping and handling fees for the supreme amount of effort it'll take you to pull
your head out of your ass?&quot; Lia asked mockingly. I was almost certain that she was
actually going to stick her tongue out. Lyndon for his part just looked over at her for a
moment before then trying to punch her on the arm. She caught his hand however, then
jumped up and gave him a noogie. Willow and I exchanged amused looks at this latest
development. They had been fighting over one thing or another since we left the club. I
was beginning to think that they spent so much time around each other not because they
were terribly fond of each other, but because they enjoyed fighting with each other so
very much.</p>

<p>As we turned onto the street where the stop for the bus we had to take get back to the
colony was, a young woman jumped out from one of the alley ways and grabbed Willow by
shoulders shaking her.</p>

<p>&quot;What's my name?&quot; she demanded over and over again until I stepped in between
them and freed Willow bringing her into a loose embrace while giving the woman a look that
clearly said 'back off'. Even in her somewhat frenzied state she realized that it would be
best for her to find a new person to question so she turned to Lia who was the next person
closest to her. &quot;What's my name? What's my name? What's my name?&quot; she asked
getting increasingly frustrated each time she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I know you?&quot; Lia asked not moving from the spot she had stopped in a
moment ago even though the woman started to approach her.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I know you? Do I know you? Do I know you?&quot; she replied closing her eyes
for a moment before looking at Lia again. &quot;Do I know you?&quot; this time it sounded
like an actual question.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Lia said holding up her hand. &quot;First of all, stop walking,
you're already within a sufficient distance to carry on a civil conversation. Secondly,
you have to stop repeating everything we say. Not only is it irritating, it's also a sign
of below average intelligence. Thirdly, who are you?&quot; she continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Who&#133;&quot; the woman started then stopped. She had stopped walking like Lia
had told her to and was apparently working on number two. &quot;I don't know who,&quot;
she said finally.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't know who you are?&quot; Willow asked stepping out of the loose circle
of my arms. &quot;Not even your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; the woman said shaking her head and looking down at the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Riddle me this Batman,&quot; Lia started a moment later while looking at the
woman. &quot;What steals a persons memories leaving them disoriented, and alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; Willow asked turning to look at her.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, but whatever it is we've got a case of it on our hands,&quot; Lia
responded stepping towards the woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Who am I?&quot; the woman asked again as Lia approached her.</p>

<p>&quot;We don't know, but we'll find out,&quot; Lia said placing a hand on her back to
motion her down the street. &quot;Don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jane?&quot; I whispered to Lia once we were on the move again. It looked like it
was time to play the name once again.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she responded thoughtfully. &quot;Elizabeth. Yeah, Elizabeth I
think,&quot; she said finally.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Elizabeth?&quot; I asked not understanding the correlation.</p>

<p>&quot;I've always liked the name Elizabeth. It's very aristocratic, I think she would
like it,&quot; Lia responded shrugging. Whatever.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>We took Elizabeth to the police station and once there we informed them of her
condition when we found her, and told them what little information we had been able to
gather about how long she had been out there for. After that we then headed back to colony
to consult with Giles, and if he was around, Wesley. We decided it would be best to try
and keep things quiet for now since we weren't certain that anything was actually going
on.</p>

<p>Presently we were all gathered in the lounge of the central compound. There was a table
in front of us and two couches, and two chairs surrounding it. Willow, Xander and I were
on the couch to the south, while Lia and Lyndon occupied the couch to the north, and Giles
and Wesley were seated in the chairs to the east and west respectively.</p>

<p>&quot;How long had her memory been gone for when you found her?&quot; Giles asked after
we finished our recount of happened when we left the club.</p>

<p>&quot;A week, maybe a week and a half. She wasn't exactly keeping detailed notes,&quot;
I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, where did it happen? Does she remember where she woke up?&quot; Wesley
asked as he adjusted his glasses.</p>

<p>&quot;She said she woke up in the woods,&quot; Willow responded. &quot;In a cave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she give you any other information? Was there anything else of
interest?&quot; Giles asked looking at each of us individually.</p>

<p>&quot;Numbers,&quot; Lia said quietly. &quot;She said that at the end of a winding
trail ahead of the cave mouth she saw a bronze plaque with numbers on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What were the numbers?&quot; Wesley asked leaning forward slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;She didn't say. She just said that they were real G.I Joe-ish, you know looked
like a military code or something,&quot; Lia responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Willow said suddenly. &quot;Wasn't there something about that in the
brochure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will, you and my Uncle Morty are the only two people in the world who actually
read the brochures,&quot; Xander said in response. Willow gave him a look then continued
with whatever it was she was going to say.</p>

<p>&quot;It's called Spanish Rock. The plaque is just a copy of some inscription that was
found carved into stonewall,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Spanish Rock. That's near where we found Johnny,&quot; I said remembering the
map. We were right around that area.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Giles commented as he removed his glasses and proceed to clean the
lenses. I knew what that meant.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me guess,&quot; I started. &quot;Tomorrow we're taking a field trip Spittle
Pond?&quot;</p>

<p>Giles confirmed that that would be indeed be what we were going to do. First thing in
the morning Wesley would talk to those in charge and try to get the five of out of
whatever activities we were scheduled into so that we could investigate.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>I was lying on the bed facing the ceiling with my arm draped over my eyes when I felt
the bed shake.</p>

<p>&quot;Lyndon thinks you're after his job,&quot; she commented moving until she was
lying next to me. Fortune-telling was his arena, and I had foretold what we would be doing
tomorrow pretty accurately.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't mind swapping. The pay is much better on his side of fence,&quot; I
responded taking my arm from over my face and sighing.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think it's a demon that's stealing these peoples memories?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's always a demon,&quot; I responded wearily.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed softly.</p>

<p>&quot;This was suppose to be a vacation,&quot; I said. &quot;There was suppose to be
sand, and limbo contests, and tequila shooter competitions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't forget volley-ball, there was suppose to be volley-ball,&quot; Willow
added.</p>

<p>&quot;And volley-ball,&quot; I added. &quot;I could've stayed at home for this,&quot; I
continued a second later.</p>

<p>&quot;If you did then whatever's doing this would just keep on doing it,&quot; Willow
pointed out.</p>

<p>&quot;The island's full of demon fighting people,&quot; I responded. There was a
Slayer's convention in town, if they were missing one little me it wouldn't have mattered.</p>

<p>&quot;But you're the one,&quot; she said raising onto her elbows so that she was
looking down at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Lia could have done it. Lia or that Austrian girl, Greta. Greta looks pretty
tough, I bet she could do it. It would have given them something to put on their
rsums,&quot; I responded avoiding her gaze. I was acting babyish and I knew it, I just
didn't want to see it reflected back at me.</p>

<p>&quot;You are the one,&quot; Willow repeated this time stressing each and every word.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said a closing my eyes momentarily before finally opening them to
meet her gaze. &quot;Sometimes&#133;sometimes being the one is lonely,&quot; I said
finally.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not alone,&quot; she responded before leaning down and kissing my lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm not, am I?&quot; I asked reaching up and bringing her lips back down to
mine. She was mine, and I was hers. As long as we were one, we would never be alone.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>We were in the park for about fifteen minutes before we located the bronze plaque
Elizabeth had mentioned. Inscribed on it was: TF 1543. Giles and Wesley poured over the
demonic almanacs they had brought with them while the rest of us looked around to see if
we could find anything else that could be of use. Xander found the original carving, but
it was exactly the same thing as what was on the plaque.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I've found something,&quot; Wesley called out about half an hour after
we arrived at Spanish Rock. He had two books spread out in front of him, one was a book
about the history of Bermuda, and the other was one of the almanacs. &quot;It says
here,&quot; he continued pointing to the history book, once we had all gathered around,
&quot;that many believe the inscription was carved by an early Portuguese 'discoverer'. I
believe the discoverer they are referring to is Renaldo Falcon,&quot; he said now pointing
to the almanac. &quot;In here it says that while Falcon was on a trip to La Bermudas his
crew started disappearing and suffering from memory loss while they were out gathering
supplies. Falcon then goes on to recount an encounter he had with a terrible beast, saying
that he barely escaped with his life. It goes on to say that he carved a warning into
stone near the beasts lair to warn others of the danger, and spare them the horror that
befell his crew,&quot; Wesley concluded looking up. &quot;Sounds much like our culprit to
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't give any suggestions about how to kill this beast does he?&quot; I
asked from my spot in the grass. All the good sitting rocks were taken. Wesley merely
shook his head. &quot;Didn't think so,&quot; I muttered. Everybody had seen a demon and
wrote about how scary they were, but nobody seemed to have any ideas about how to kill
them.</p>

<p>I looked down the path that lead to the opening to the cave, then I looked over at
Giles.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it in there?&quot; I asked, even though I was fairly certain what the answer
would be.</p>

<p>&quot;Most likely,&quot; Giles answered. I could tell he already knew where I was going
with this. I nodded, then got up and swung my pack over my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;You coming?&quot; I asked turning to Lia.</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; she asked. She had been playing with a twig. &quot;Oh, the
cave,&quot; she said catching up. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she answered jumping up and swinging
her bag over her shoulder. &quot;We gonna kick some ass?&quot; she asked walking over to
me. &quot;That's why we're going in there,&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Wesley said standing up. &quot;Absolutely not. I do not give you leave
to go in there. I forbid it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You forbid it?&quot; I asked looking at him. &quot;I'm a Slayer. I slay things,
bad things. That's my job, and if I do it well I sometimes get cookies. The thing in there
is bad, and I'm gonna kill it. What's the problem?&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;She,&quot; he said pointing to Lia, &quot;is not an active Slayer. If she is
injured&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you afraid of? A lawsuit?&quot; Lia asked interrupting. &quot;Somebody
has to go in there with her, I mean you're not suggesting she go up against this thing
alone are you?&quot; she asked looking at him. &quot;I'm the closest thing to another
Slayer that you've got, and I'm going in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I forb&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You forbid it. I heard you, I just don't care,&quot; Lia responded. &quot;Is he
always this anal?&quot; she asked turning to face me. I nodded and she made a face.</p>

<p>&quot;We have to formulate a course of action,&quot; Wesley responded not ready to
admit defeat.</p>

<p>&quot;We have a course of action,&quot; I responded. &quot;We go in there and we kill
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would suggest you put a little more thought into it than that,&quot; Wesley
continued.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a very simple concept. The thing is bad, we kill it. It doesn't exactly
require a Ph.D.&quot; I responded. &quot;Do you know how to kill it?&quot; I asked him.</p>

<p>&quot;No&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I thought. If we sit around on our asses for a few more hours will
you know how to kill it then?&quot; I asked building up momentum.</p>

<p>&quot;No&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I thought. So we can go in there and try to kill it now, or we can go
in there and try to kill it tomorrow. Since we're here already, I say we go ahead and just
kill it already,&quot; I finished.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll second that,&quot; Lia piped up. Wesley's posture got even more rigid than
it had been before and he looked over at Giles in an attempt for support.</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful,&quot; Giles said turning to face us. &quot;Don't try anything overly
heroic, if you run into trouble, leave. For once we've got plenty of trained back up.
There's no need to take any unnecessary risks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will do,&quot; I responded, then I looked over at Lia and we headed for the cave.</p>
