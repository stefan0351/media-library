<!-- Starlight \ Part 8 -->

<p>Willow sat on the floor at Buffy's feet undoing the laces of the Slayer's running shoes. It was ten at night, and except for the sounds of their breathing the room was quiet. Xander and Anya had left a few hours before, and Giles and Buffy weren't currently on speaking terms.</p>

<p>That yell that they had heard while gathered around the table earlier had only been the beginning. Buffy continued to scream at the top of her lungs for fifteen minutes before Willow couldn't take anymore and went to get her. Giles had managed to stop her five minutes before and tried to stop her again, but she was determined.</p>

<p>Buffy had wheeled herself in silently and without looking at any of them-except for Willow who she tenderly thanked-she rolled herself into the bedroom where she remained for the rest of the day. Willow, who was less than thrilled with Giles as well, spent most of the day in the bedroom with Buffy, only leaving her to check up on the progress they were making in the main room.</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Buffy said softly, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&#34;For what?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>Buffy merely looked down at her feet, the feet Willow was currently pulling shoes off of.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm glad I can help,&#34; Willow responded before returning to her work.</p>

<p>&#34;You're more than helping,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Your saving. I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here,&#34; she continued sincerely.</p>

<p>&#34;Now you know how I feel on an almost daily basis,&#34; Willow responded with a sweet smile.</p>

<p>&#34;I guess I do,&#34; Buffy responded returning the smile.</p>

<p>They continued to look at each for a few more seconds before Willow finally averted her gaze and started to remove Buffy's socks.</p>

<p>&#34;You're going to have to talk to him again sometime,&#34; Willow commented softly a moment later.</p>

<p>&#34;No I don't,&#34; Buffy responded petulantly.</p>

<p>&#34;He wasn't trying to be mean,&#34; Willow responded in a reasonable tone.</p>

<p>&#34;If his intentions were so honorable then why haven't you been talking to him all day either?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Protecting my honor, perhaps?&#34; the Slayer cleverly asked.</p>

<p>&#34;He just…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wanted to prove to me that I DO need your help, and that if I keep acting the way I have been I'm going to be alone, and that I'm beyond vulnerable the way that I am and I need to get my legs back or I'm dead, and that feeling sorry for myself isn't going to get a damn thing done. Is that 'just' what he wanted?&#34; Buffy asked looking down at Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, yeah,&#34; Willow responded grinning. &#34;I guess it worked though.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It was inhumane. If I was a dog there would be a network special dedicated to the trial I had to go through. But I'm lower than a dog, I'm the Slayer! I don't lick my own ass, or drink from the toilet, I just save the world so who gives a flying fuck!&#34; Buffy finished dramatically.</p>

<p>&#34;I spoke too soon,&#34; Willow said softly sitting back on the floor.</p>

<p>&#34;Please, Will…don't,&#34; Buffy said shaking her head as if to ward off the oncoming attack. &#34;I don't need to get the speech from you too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What speech?&#34; Willow asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;The 'you're not allowed to have feelings because your Slayer' speech. The 'so you're paralyzed, suck it up speech', and any other variation on the theme that you can think of,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said slowly lifting her hand up to take Buffy's into hers. &#34;Would you consider hearing an 'I love you Buffy, and you and can lean on me, cry on my shoulder and whatever else you want' speech?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I think I could deal with that,&#34; Buffy responded smiling.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I love you,&#34; Willow said looking up at Buffy. &#34;And you can lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend. I'll help you carry on,&#34; Willow continued in an utterly serious voice, which only made Buffy's smile widen. &#34;And whenever you feel the need…or want to just for the heck of it…you can cry on my shoulder, or pant leg, or any other part of my body, and if there's something else that you can think of that would help…well, you can do that too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's the best speech I've ever heard in life,&#34; Buffy replied. &#34;Look, it's made me all misty-eyed,&#34; she continued blinking back some tears.</p>

<p>Willow raised up onto her knees so that she and Buffy were face to face. Then she reached up with her right hand and brushed away a tear that Buffy couldn't quite manage to contain-though she was giving it a valiant try. Once she had done this Willow continued to reach around with her hand, brushing a few strands of Buffy's hair behind her ear, before finally leaving her hand to rest on Buffy's cheek.</p>

<p>Buffy leaned into the touch slightly, her eyes flickering closed as she absorbed the sensations flooding through her body. She wanted to turn her face around and softly kiss the palm of Willow's hand. She wanted to take that hand in hers and rain a shower of kisses across it, and along her arm. She wanted to take Willow into her arms and kiss her until nothing existed in the entire world except for them. She wanted…</p>

<p>She needed to end this before it started, because she knew if it started she wouldn't be able to end it.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow,&#34; Buffy breathed in husky timbre she hadn't intended, but couldn't help.</p>

<p>At the sound of Buffy's voice Willow became painfully aware of their positioning and of what she herself was doing. She also noted with an agonizing sluggishness that her heart was thundering in her chest, and she became almost unnaturally aware of the blood that was madly coursing through her veins. In short, she realized that her body had responded to Buffy's muted utterance with a pure, unadulterated rush of desire. She could feel the yearning burning in the pit of her stomach like a wild fire, consuming her.</p>

<p>She felt like a thug, and was overcome by a moment of intense self-loathing. She couldn't comprehend how she could be so selfish at a moment like this, and it made her sick to think that at a time when Buffy needed her friendship more than anything, all that she could think of was kissing her friends lips-lips she had decided after careful consideration, years worth at least, were the best, most lush, most kissable lips ever to be created.</p>

<p>Willow yanked her hand back and stood up abruptly. Buffy looked up at her questioningly, her friends unexpected movements momentarily destabilizing her equilibrium.</p>

<p>&#34;We should go to bed,&#34; Willow said meeting Buffy's gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;It's ten-thirty,&#34; Buffy responded giving a Willow an uncertain smile.</p>

<p>&#34;It's been a long day,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>&#34;That it has,&#34; Buffy said a moment later, sighing. &#34;Sleep sounds good actually.&#34;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy held her position-facing the door, her back turned Willow-for a second more before finally turning around. They had gotten in bed about half an hour ago, but neither of them had managed to fall asleep. She could hear Willow breathing and her breaths were still coming in the fast, erratic pattern of consciousness.</p>

<p>&#34;I knew ten thirty was too early to go to sleep,&#34; Buffy said into darkness. &#34;I'm really kind of night person.&#34;</p>

<p>She didn't need to open her eyes to know that Willow was laughing.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't imagine why,&#34; Willow responded shifting so that she was facing Buffy as well.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, if you're worried about the guy with a hook for a hand, don't. I'll protect you,&#34; Buffy said, but as she said the last part her voice hollowed out as if she only then realized that what she was saying was no longer true.</p>

<p>&#34;I know you will,&#34; Willow responded with absolutely certainty. She had picked up on the change in Buffy's voice immediately and knew what caused it. She shifted a little bit closer to Buffy and placed her hand on the Slayer's shoulder. &#34;You know that you're my hero, don't you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you might want to start checking the classifieds for a replacement,&#34; Buffy responded dropping her eyes though Willow couldn't see.</p>

<p>&#34;Won't need to,&#34; Willow said. &#34;You're going to be back on the job in no time.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy raised her eyes again after that, feeling an intense need to be close to Willow. She couldn't even really describe what she feeling, only that then, there, Willow was…Willow was… everything. She was shining and shimmering and everything that was good and pure in her life, and in the world. She was the one who could save her from the ranks of the freaks, the suspect, and the lonely.</p>

<p>&#34;I…&#34; the Slayer started to say, but she couldn't think of the words. &#34;There's so much that I want to…&#34; but she trailed off again not knowing how to describe all that she was feeling. But she needed to do something, she needed to…she needed to…kiss the girl.</p>

<p>So she did.</p>

<p>Buffy closed the small distance that remained between them, and touched her lips to Willows, barely brushing the hackers full lips with her own.</p>

<p>Then she pulled back and observed Willow. The red heads eyes were closed, her lips were slightly parted, and she didn't seem to be breathing.</p>

<p>&#34;I just…this,&#34; Buffy said almost inaudibly, then she brought her lips back to Willows. She pressed them together more firmly this time, but the kiss was still chaste, and quickly over.</p>

<p>This time when Buffy pulled back Willow's eyes were open and she was watching the Slayer with a kind of wide eyed wonder that Buffy was certain was unique to Willow alone. She opened her mouth as if she was going to say something, but no sound came out and she quickly closed her mouth.</p>

<p>&#34;Do…do you think you'll be able to sleep now?&#34; Buffy asked reaching out to brush a strand of hair that had fallen over Willow's eyes out of her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow said softly, nodding her head as if the empathize the truthfulness of her response.</p>

<p>&#34;Good,&#34; Buffy responded, leaving her hand where it was for moment longer before removing it and returning it to her side.</p>

<p>&#34;Goodnight,&#34; Willow said, her voice was shaky.</p>

<p>&#34;Night,&#34; Buffy responded contemplatively.</p>

<p>Willow shifted settling back into her former position, and was ready to try and fall back asleep-which she seriously doubted she would be able to do-but she stopped and turned back around to face Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you,&#34; she said with a touch of awe in her voice.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you too, Will,&#34; Buffy responded with a small smile.</p>

<p>With that both girls turned around and placed their heads back down on their pillows and took up staring at the door and the window respectively. Both of them began reviewing the events of the night, and the past few days. Both of them began reviewing what they themselves had said and initiated, and what the other had said and initiated. And as they did this both them were left wondering, what the hell was going?</p>
