<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 1 -->

<p><b>2002 - Evanston, Illinois</b></p>

<p>"Oh my god," Jessie breathed out as she stepped
closer to the canvas, her nose mere centimeters away from the surface. "This is
amazing," she continued turning around to face Katie who was standing off to the
side, bouncing about nervously.</p>

<p>"So it doesn't suck complete ass?" Katie
asked bouncing on the balls of her feet, and tipping her head from side to side.</p>

<p>"It's no where near ass. It's so far away
from ass that ass needs a telescope to see its outline," Jessie replied walking over
to her girlfriend and wrapping her arms around her waist, squeezing reassuringly.
"You should totally send it in," she continued resting her head on Katie's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said dropping her head
down.</p>

<p>"I do," Jessie returned, unwrapping herself from
around Katie's back so that she could move around to face her. "So just shut up
and do what I tell you to," she continued before leaning forward and bringing their
lips together.</p>

<p>"I love it when you get all authoritative," Katie
replied smiling lecherously a moment later when they pulled apart. Even though what she
had said was a joke, she was really the kind of girl that needed someone to keep an eye on
them. Before she met Jessie, she'd always found herself in some kind of trouble or
the other. Lord help her, she just didn't have that filter in her brain that told her
when to be quiet or when to not do something. Jessie wasn't only her better half she
was her sane and sensible half too.</p>

<p>"Be quiet," Jessie replied turning her attention
back to Katie's painting. When Katie looked at her like that, it made her want to do
things that they most definitely couldn't do in Katie's basement with her
parents upstairs.</p>

<p>"Why? Have I been naughty?" the dirty blonde
asked still wearing the same expression as before when Jessie turned back to face her.</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you don't shut up I'm going to
have to punish you," Jessie replied waving a dangerous finger in her face.</p>

<p>"That could be fun," Katie said thoughtfully,
wondering if Karen was out on another date so that they could 'date' a little
themselves in her empty house.</p>

<p>"Not if it's coming to scrabble night at the
Manning house," Jessie responded with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Right," Katie said turning her attention back to
the painting in front of them. Suddenly she didn't want to be bad anymore. "So
I'll add it to the portfolio then," she continued serious once more as she
stared at one of the pieces of artwork that could possibly change her life.</p>

<p>"They'll love it," Jessie said reassuringly,
sensing her girlfriend's anxiety and wanting to sooth it.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Katie replied non-committedly. That was
what she was afraid of.</p>
