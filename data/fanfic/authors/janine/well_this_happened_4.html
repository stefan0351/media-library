<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 4 -->

<p>Brooke ran a hand through her wet hair, a slight shiver running through her
body.  That shower had certainly been cold.  Wrapping the towel more
securely around herself she walked over to her vanity mirror and leaned
over, placing her hands on the top of it and stared at her own reflection
studiously.  'Brooke,' she thought to herself, 'you have got to pull
yourself together.'  These were some very true thoughts, thoughts that she
carefully took into consideration, strenuously believed, and just couldn't
seem to follow through on for the life of her.</p>

<p>
Sam crept down the hall stealthily towards Brooke's bedroom, carefully
opening the door and sneaking in.  Turning around with a pleased smile on
her face she observed Brooke observing herself in the mirror before walking
over to her.  Wrapping her arms around Brooke's waist, Sam then rested her
chin on the blonde's shoulder and stared forward into the mirror.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell your fortune?" the brunette asked smiling.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Brooke replied dipping her head down so that she was looking
at the table surface.  "I was talking to myself."</p>

<p>"You might want to keep that on the down low...or at least blame it on your
hand so that people don't think you're crazy," Sam responded lightly, before
adding in a more serious tone, "What were you consulting yourself about?"</p>

<p>"I've got this problem you see," Brooke started looking up into the mirror
once more, her eyes locking with Sam's in the reflection surface.  "I've got
this really sexy girlfriend, I mean hot…hotter than Angelina Jolie in the
Arizona desert in August at high noon," Brooke continued.  "But that's not
my problem…actually I'm quite pleased with that."  Sam smiled.  "My problem
is that I have this condition…"</p>

<p>"Condition?" Sam asked knowingly, her eyes hooding slightly as she listened
to the now low timbres of Brooke's voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  My hands, they seem to have a mind of their own…they do things that
I don't remember telling them to do," Brooke responded as one of her hands
reached back and started to make it's way up Sam's thigh.</p>

<p>"What kind of things," Sam asked softly, she was momentarily distracted by
Brooke's problematic hands and the very pleasant effects they were having on
her.</p>

<p>"All kinds of things," Brooke responded with a dramatic sigh.  "I don't know
what to do.  I just can't help myself."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Sam began, "the best way to beat temptation is to yield to it,"
she continued before brushing Brooke's hair aside and licking her neck
sensuously.  Brooke groaned and turned around in the circle of Sam's arms
leaning forward but not quite bringing their lips together.</p>

<p>"We can't do this," Brooke whispered, her mouth hovering dangerously close
to Sam's.  However, she didn't sound terribly convinced, even to her own
ears.  In truth, she sounded acutely desperate to do it.</p>

<p>"Carpa Deum, Brooke," Sam whispered back.  "Seize me," she continued before
closing the distance between them and bringing their lips together in a
heated embrace.  Brooke, unable to help her response, drew her arms around
Sam bringing them closer together as the kiss deepened.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke practically moaned as she pulled away.  "They're just
downstairs."</p>

<p>"Their busy," Sam responded distractedly as she leaned in to take Brooke's
lips once more.  "Some conference call from Tokyo."  Certainly the situation
wasn't idle, but Sam had given up quixotic ideas such as flowers, and
candles, and Marvin Gaye days ago.  Desperate times, called for desperate
measures, and Tokyo would do.</p>

<p>"What about your mom?" Brooke asked allowing Sam to draw her into her.</p>

<p>"She's sitting in on it," Sam responded pleased to see Brooke start to
relax.  "I heard them talking."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled, "You mean you eavesdropped."</p>

<p>"Essentially," Sam answered with a matching grin.  "But aren't you glad that
I did?"</p>

<p>"Extremely," Brooke responded before bringing their lips together once
again.</p>

<p>The first contact was like heaven, both of them having felt as if it had
been months, years, or even decades since they had last been free to touch
each other unreservedly.  Since their parents had come back, it had all been
quick kisses here and there, brief moments snatched for themselves in dark
corners;  a covert operation, a hot/cold war as it were.</p>

<p>On those days, after dinner at pre-arranged times, Sam would sneak into a
mostly deserted area of the house, to be joined by Brooke a few minutes
later where all they could do was fan the fire that was burning them up
inside instead of extinguishing it.  And, even though it actually made their
situation worse, made them long for each other company with a greater
intensity than before they had meet, they continued to do it.  Because the
idea of being either further removed from each other than they already were
was unthinkable to them.  To each other they were life giving, a galvanizing
impetus, simply a daily necessity for the continued existence of the unique
species categorized as Sam and Brooke.  So those stolen moments, those
clandestine meetings were cherished and dreaded at the same time, for when
it was time to part-and they always had to part-the world was a little bit
colder than before, and Sam a little more hyper and Brooke a little more
ornery.</p>

<p>"It feels like forever since I've gotten to hold you," Brooke whispered
softly when the briefly separated.  "To touch you," she continued almost
reverently.</p>

<p>"Forever is far too long," was Sam's response, to which Brooke smiled.  Sam
then turned her attention to Brooke's neck as one of her hands parted
Brooke's towel and leisurely made it's way underneath, tickling Brooke's
skin along the way.  As Sam's hand began to explore Brooke's hidden
treasures the only thing that was keeping the towel attached to Brooke's
body was the intimate proximity of their bodies; and as Sam's hand trailed
up Brooke's torso to cup her breast, Brooke just couldn't seem to find it
within herself to care.</p>

<p>
"Brooke?" a voice called from outside the door freezing the two girls in
their positions.  They were only spurred into motion when they saw the knob
begin to turn and heard the door start to creak open.</p>

<p>Sam removed her hands from Brooke's body and stumbled backwards until there
was an acceptable distance between the two of them, leaving Brooke to clutch
her towel to her body desperately as Jane McPherson walked into the hormone
filled bedroom, completely oblivious to the activities which had been going
on previous to her arrival and the distress that they occupants of the room
were now in.</p>

<p>Spotting Brooke first she gasped, "I didn't know you were in here," a slight
blush coming to her face to match Brooke's own flushed complexion.  "I
thought you were in the shower, although I guess you were…I just wanted to
return this," she went on extending her hand to reveal a book Brooke had
leant her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's alright, you know…the more the merrier," Brooke responded in what
she hoped was a blasé tone, although she shifted her weight uncomfortably
aware of the fact that she could still feel Sam's hands on her and her body
was still reacting like nothing had changed from a few moments before, even
though everything had changed.  She clung to the towel that now hung
precariously on her body more fervently.  "Are you finished already?" she
went on, more for the sake of distracting herself more than anything else as
another shiver ran through her body.</p>

<p>Jane was about to respond to the inquiry when a movement off to the side
caught her eye.  Recalling Brooke's comment about 'the more the merrier' she
was suddenly dying to know and terrified to find out who could possibly have
been in Brooke's room after she showered.  Turning her head slightly she
spotted her daughter standing off to the side, and was relieved but somewhat
confused to see it.</p>

<p>"Sam?" she asked in a tone that was mildly surprised but nothing really more
than that.</p>

<p>"I thought she was in the shower," was Sam's somewhat odd response
considering the tone her mother had implied.  The brunette sounded more like
she was giving testimony than answering a simple greeting.</p>

<p>"What?" Jane asked not quite following her daughters train of thought.</p>

<p>"I came to get my bio text," Sam responded pointing the book lying on the
bed having spotted it a moment before.  Sam knew enough about biology to
know that both she and Brooke were in bad shape at the moment, and watching
Brooke shift and shudder, the flush previously on her skin not going
anywhere, Sam knew too that she had to get herself and her mother out of
there.  "To do homework," she added after that really for no discernable
reason other than she didn't want to be thinking about Brooke's body at the
moment.</p>

<p>"I see," Jane responded returning her attention to Brooke who was fiddling
with her towel trying to tie it again.  "The…" she started to say to the
cheerleader but was cut off by Sam coming up behind her and nudging her.
"What are you doing?" Jane asked in regards to the mini body check Sam had
just given her.  She had seen baby elephants engaged in this type of
behavior on the Discovery Channel before, but it wasn't really as cute
coming from her own child.</p>

<p>"We should go," Sam said gravely.  "She's like naked," she continued looking
at Brooke quickly before turning away.  "We shouldn't be here when she's
almost naked," Sam went on nudging her mother towards the door.  "In America
we don't like nudity, that's why its only on late night TV and pay per view.
  We should definitely go."  And with that both of the McPherson's were
outside and room and Sam quickly turned around and shut the door, her
anxiety level lowering considerably once Brooke was out of sight, and out of
reach.</p>

<p>"You didn't take your book," Jane pointed out once they were in the hallway.</p>

<p>"What book?" Sam asked distractedly.</p>

<p>"Your text book," Jane said watching her daughter.  Sam had been acting
oddly lately, and she was beginning to get suspicious although she didn't
know what she beginning to get suspicious about.  She was however certain
that she was suspicious of something.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," Sam replied.  "I guess I already got my biology lesson for
today," she continued looking back at the door, then smiling uncomfortably
when she realized what she had said and who she had said it to.</p>

<p>"You're a strange child," Jane responded shaking her head.</p>

<p>"I prefer the term eccentric," Sam related.  Jane smiled and drew her arm
around Sam's neck dragging her down the hall.  This meant quality time.  Sam
sighed, it was the perfect end to the perfect night.  "I thought you had a
conference call to Tokyo," Sam commented a moment later unable to resist.
She should have had at least two hours and she was a bit bitter that things
didn't work out that way.</p>

<p>"Oh, that got postponed to tomorrow night…after Mike gets his cast off,"
Jane replied.</p>

<p>"Figures," Sam muttered darkly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>
