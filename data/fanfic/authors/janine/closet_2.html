<!-- The Closet \ Part Two -->

<p>Brooke's surveyed the crowd uneasily.  An abnormal silence had come
over the assembled group of teenagers coating the peeling walls of
the bus station with a palpable tension.  Brooke closed her eyes, her
face scrunching up in anticipation of the inevitable.  She could feel
the indignation swelling in the chests of each and every one of her
peers, she could see hands clenching all around her, she could hear
breaths being sucked in sharply, and breathes coming in huffs.  In
about one point five seconds, things were going to get very ugly.</p>

<p>Then it happened, all around her people erupted into fits of rage.
Screaming, yells, fists pumping in the air.  All around her comments
were being shouted at the front of the station, "What do you mean
there's a seating plan?!",  "The fuck?!",  "Excuse me!"  To her
immediate right, she could hear Nicole starting up.  "No!  No, I
don't think that YOU understand.  Listen to me…no listen TO ME.  Pull
your floppy ears out of the dog dish and listen to the grape vine,
there is no way in hell that…"  but the cries were soon interrupted
by a screeching Bio Glass.</p>

<p>"If you want," Glass yelled waving a clip board in the air,  "to be
getting on this bus," she continued surveying the crowd with beady
eyes, "you will shut your traps this instant and," she turned to face
Nicole as she spoke, "as Miss Julian so gracefully put it," there was
a definite snare on her face, "you will listen to the grapevine!"</p>

<p>Everyone was quiet.</p>

<p>"The seating is alphabetical," Glass announced, eyes roaming over the
crowd.  "Now move!"  And with that she began to announce who would be
sitting with each other on the bus.</p>

<p>"Cherry and Esposito," Glass yelled out.  "Front and center."</p>

<p>Sam looked over at Lily trying valiantly to contain her smile, as for
how well that worked, well, they say it's the thought that counts.
Lily glared at her then made her way to the front.  As she reached
Bio Glass, she saw Mary Cherry look back and wink at her causing a
deep, chilling shiver to run through her body.  She looked over at
Glass in desperation, panic over came her and threw herself at Glass,
grasping onto her arm like it was gas mask on a crashing plane.</p>

<p>"Please, please don't make me sit with her!" Lily pleaded
desperately, looking into Glass's eyes.  "Oh God, don't make me sit
with her," the brunette continued.</p>

<p>"Get on the bus Esposito," Glass responded shaking Lily off.  "And
for God's sake, pull yourself together."</p>

<p>"Ford and Ferrerr," Glass called out next.</p>

<p>Carmen looked over at Sam and winked, causing the journalist to shake
her head and whisper "go `em tiger!", to which Carm blushed and
smiled nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Julian and John."</p>

<p>As Harrison walked by Sam crossed herself and mumbled, "my prayers
are with you".  As he approached the front of the bus Nicole turned
around, and while nobody could be absolutely certain it appeared as
if she growled at him.</p>

<p>"McPherson and McQueen," Glass called out, then paused for a
second.  "Oh, how quaint," Glass then added smiling as Brooke and Sam
approached.</p>

<p>Sam sighed as she walked to their designated seating area.  New York
was a very long way away, and Sam could tell that this was going to
be a positively excruciating bus ride.</p>
