<!-- Starlight \ Part 15 -->

<p>Willow leaned back in her chair and immersed herself in an activity that was fast becoming her favorite pastime. It was a little game that she liked to call &#34;Buffy Gazing&#34;. The best part about the game was that it was almost sinfully easy. All that one had to do to win was, gaze at Buffy, and she could definitely handle that. Buffy was sitting across the table from her. They were all seated around Giles table in a very Brady moment. Giles and Buffy were engaged in an arduous discussion-and Willow used the term lightly-about the best ingredients to put on a Kabob. Willow had no idea how the conversation had arrived at such a topic of universal importance, and since she didn't really have anything useful to add the eloquent polemic taking place, she decided to Buffy gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;Is too,&#34; Buffy said leaning forward so that her face was only inches away from Giles's.</p>

<p>&#34;Is not,&#34; Giles's shot back not backing down. &#34;That didn't even make sense,&#34; he went on in a huffy tone. &#34;That wasn't even a point!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Buffy asked clearly outraged. &#34;That…that was entirely pointy!&#34; she continued emphatically.</p>

<p>&#34;You did it again,&#34; Giles said pointing a finger in her face. &#34;You're non-sensical...you're a non-sensical Slayer!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;A non-sensical Slayer?&#34; Buffy asked incredulously. &#34;And I'm the one who's not making any sense?&#34;</p>

<p>That was about the last of that compelling discussion Willow heard, for her Buffy gazing soon metamorphisized into a deep reflection of recent events. For the first time-in what felt like weeks, but had actually been days-Willow was able to sit back and reflect on the journey she had been through over the past few days-the horrors of it, the wonders of it, the uncertainty, the excitement, the beauty and ugliness of it all, starting on that one cold night. She had no idea that coming upon Buffy's body in that cemetery, lying there cold and motionless, would only the first of the horrors visited upon her that night and indeed in the days to follow.</p>

<p>Through no volition of her own, Willow found her mind wondering to the later hours of that night. In her minds eye she saw herself, and Xander struggling to hold down Buffy's protesting body as Giles attempted to bind her wound. It had without a doubt been one of the most horrific experiences in her entire life, and truly considering the things she had seen and done that was significant statement. Every time Buffy's body bucked, or shook, or whimpered, it felt to Willow as if she herself were being branded-for doing nothing to stop the pain, and for doing the only thing possible to stop the pain.</p>

<p>She remembered staying with Buffy after the others had left, and she remembered picking up the Slayers unmoving hand and bringing it to the side of her face before succumbing to sea of tears that had been threatening to overwhelm her from the moment she had first laid eyes on Buffy's prone form. She had sat there, leaning over Buffy's body crying, raging, and aching for the better part of an hour, trying to purge herself of the tumultuous emotions brewing inside of her and failing miserably to do so. It was true that sometimes a good cry helped, and it was also true that some times it was as useless a book left unread, or a pencil with a broken point-utterly, and wholly.</p>

<p>And then, joy of joys, Buffy had awoken. Bruised and beaten but not defeated she had awaken, and the angels had sung and Willow's heart had soared. In the company of doves, her heart had risen, had flown into the white of the clouds and the sun had shone upon her warming her formerly tortured soul. And there, wrapped together in as tender a moment as they had ever shared, verging on a closeness that had only ever been considered in the deepest depths of their unconscious minds and there buried before the light of day could encroach upon its edges, they had lay if not in blissful ignorance then in a state of happiness as close to it as one could get.</p>

<p>And then, horror of horrors, Buffy had fallen. And once again the dark, towering, mountains of gloom appeared above, over, and around them. Trapping them in yet another revolution of desolation.</p>

<p>But somehow, miraculously in those dark days, a bond already formed by years of friendship and devotion had been cemented, and furthermore augmented. Words had taken on deeper meanings, touches carried with them more serious connotations, and looks which before had been obscure and ambiguous at best began to take form and transform into something tangible, into something obtainable. In those days something beautiful was being born between them; it was phosphorescence in the dark, cruel depths of the ocean.</p>

<p>And now, here they were. Gathered around a table, in the home of a man both of them considered a father of sorts-and one certainly preferable to the contemptible examples of the species each of them had been given-sharing dinner and discussion. Willow found herself thinking that this was quite a remarkable near conclusion to all that had transpired erstwhile.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow?&#34;</p>

<p>The hacker was brought out of her musings by the sound of an impatient Slayer voice.</p>

<p>&#34;What's the up?&#34; Willow asked looking over at Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles wanted to know if you wanted…&#34; Buffy began but she paused, a positively libidinous smile working its way across her face, &#34;…dessert,&#34; she finished licking her lips.</p>

<p>Willow refusing to be baited meet Buffy's gaze and allowed an equally sensual smile to cross her own lips.</p>

<p>&#34;A truly inspired idea,&#34; she responded.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned, and they both turned to face Giles how was looking at them rather oddly.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well,&#34; he responded at a complete loss as to what he had just witnessed. &#34;How does Napoleon sound?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Is that a short joke?&#34; Buffy inquired without missing a beat.</p>

<p>Willow smiled. Somehow, through some mysterious, untenable impetus a feeling of rightness enveloped her. Everything would be all right, she was sure of it. Everything had to be all right, she reasoned, for that was the only suitable conclusion to the trek they had been taken on, so everything had to be all right. And would be.</p>
