<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 7 -->

<p>"No, I'm serious," Brooke exclaimed excitedly.  "She has a sense of humor,
she just doesn't know it yet!"</p>

<p>"Yesterday you referred to her as the most fabulously boring person ever to
be noticed for being so utterly and completely unnoticeable," Sam responded
dubiously.  "I remember because I said that your verbiage was excessive and
you stuck your tongue out at me and referred to me as Murphy-freaking-Brown
for the rest of the night."</p>

<p>"Oh that," Brooke responded.  "That was cute though.  Wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded pouting a bit.  "You're going to do it again aren't
you?"</p>

<p>Brooke smiled at that.  "Possibly," she responded.  "At least until you
start to think it's cute."</p>

<p>"Why do you suddenly think she got a sense of humor?" Sam asked changing the
subject.</p>

<p>"I was in English, and I was talking to Random Guy," Sam smiled at that but
said nothing, " so Miss Collins called on Claire to go to the front.  So,
she goes up there and starts to read her composition which is obviously the
most unbelievably boring thing I'd ever heard-including the last
Presidential debates-until she gets to this one part where she stops
mid-sentence and declares 'Hey!  I'm a poet and I didn't even know it!'"
Brooke went on.  "I don't care if it was Claire that said it, that was just
funny."</p>

<p>"I'm a poet and I didn't even know it?" Sam asked trying to contain her
smile.</p>

<p>"I'm a poet and I didn't even know it," Brooke confirmed.</p>

<p>"Ohmygod," Sam exclaimed before dissolving into a fit of laugher.  Brooke
wrapped her arms tighter around the trembling girl in her arms and rested
her chin on Sam's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I told you," she whispered smugly.</p>

<p>"I told you," Sam repeated mockingly twisting her head around so that she
was looking at Brooke.  "I could think of better things for you to be doing
with your lips."</p>

<p>"Why Samantha McPherson," Brooke responded with a faux southern drawl.  "Are
you propositioning me...again?"</p>

<p>"Me?  You're the one who brought me to make-out-point in Archie's jalopy,"
Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Hey, this isn't just any old jalopy, it's like the jalopy's bad-ass cousin
from New York.  It's at least got 30 per cent more 'jal' and 70 per cent
more 'lopy'," Brooke responded.  "And, might I add, it was not easy to
procure this fabulous machine, but I did it for you," she continued before
dipping her head down and gently nipping at Sam's neck.</p>

<p>Sam rolled her head back giving Brooke more access to her neck sighing
contentedly.  "You're very, very good to me," Sam said softly as Brooke's
tongue tickled her skin.  "Are you going to have your way with me now?"</p>

<p>"No," Brooke responded removing her lips from Sam temporarily.  "I didn't
bring you up here to have my way with you, I brought you up here to have you
all to myself," she went on intertwining her fingers with Sam's.  "I've just
missed you."</p>

<p>"I've missed you," Sam replied sincerely.  "Also, I'd like to note that I
would turn around if I could but can't so I won't."</p>

<p>"I've got you," Brooke responded hugging her.</p>

<p>"I know," the brunette said softly.  "I know."</p>

<p>"I didn't realize how much I had gotten used to touching you until I
couldn't anymore," Brooke said a moment later.  "I think it caused a minor
mental situation."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it.  Cagney and Lacy cornered me a few days ago.  Apparently
I've been acting like a speed freak and..." Sam trailed off before she got
into their description of Brooke.</p>

<p>"And," Brooke prompted.</p>

<p>"It's not pretty," Sam warned her.</p>

<p>"I figured as much," Brooke replied.  "Lay it on me."</p>

<p>"You were crowned Princess Bitch-a-lot, sister and right hand to Satan," Sam
related.</p>

<p>"Ouch," Brooke commented.  "Carm?"</p>

<p>"Harrison," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Figures," Brooke responded knowingly.  "I should apologize, shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"It's what Britney or Christina would do," Sam answered with a smile before
tilting her head back and bringing her lips and Brooke's together.</p>

<p>Once they separated Brooke sighed softly and rested her head on Sam's
shoulder, unconsciously tightening the hold she had on the brunette.  They
sat in silence like that for a moment before Sam couldn't take it anymore.
Brooke had been acting like this all night, most of the time she fine but
then she would get very quiet and hug Sam to her almost as if she thought
the brunette were going to float away.  It was starting to worry Sam.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Sam asked quietly, placing her hands over top Brooke's
stroking them lightly as she waited for Brooke's answer.</p>

<p>"She knows.  Nicole, she knows about us," Brooke related hurriedly, before
she could lose her courage; the only part of her body to move at all being
her lips.  Sam's eyes widened at the revelation.  She knew that Brooke had
been hesitant to tell her friend, and knowing Nicole Sam knew exactly why
she had been hesitant.  Nicole Julian was the reason for the saying 'keep
your friends close and your enemies closer'.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Sam asked instinctively knowing that Brooke hadn't been the
one to inform Nicole of the situation.</p>

<p>"She just...saw it I guess.  You know what she's like, she got suspicious and
started collecting clues.  I think I'm going to have to face the fact that I
stare at you far to much...I thought I was being stealthy but apparently not,"
Brooke answered dejectedly.</p>

<p>"How'd she react?" Sam questioned gently.  From the way Brooke was acting
she almost feared the answer.</p>

<p>"Alright, I suppose," Brooke said finally raising her head from it's resting
place.  "She was forward, as expected.  Abrasive, as expected.  And
insulting, once again as expected, but she seemed to be okay with it."  Sam
was less than comforted by this answer.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?  She didn't outright threaten you?" the brunette
asked.</p>

<p>"Basically," Brooke responded sighing again and replacing her head.  "I've
just got a bad feeling about it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She was too nice, Sam," Brooke mumbled in response.  "It was like
Nicole-lite, like she was warming up or something.  I don't know," she
finished shaking her head.</p>

<p>Sam squeezed Brooke's hand reassuringly.  "We'll just have to wait and see,
there's nothing else we can do," she said still holding onto Brooke.
"Complex mess of complications," she continued feeling Brooke smile against
the skin of her neck.</p>

<p>"Complex mess of complications," Brooke repeated as her hands began to make
their way under Sam's shirt and her lips attached to the brunette's neck.</p>

<p>"I want to see you," Sam mumbled softly as she began to struggle in Brooke's
arms.  She had tried to turn around once before, but she was only playing
then.  Now she was serious and nothing was going to stop her.</p>

<p>Placing her hands on Sam's waist Brooke loosened her hold on Sam helping the
other girl turn around so that they were face to face.  However it soon
became clear to them that they wouldn't be able to stay in that position
very long, so Brooke reached back pressing the release button on the seat,
folding it down then shifted her position so that she was lying on her back,
one of her legs braced on the floor and the other resting on the seat with
Sam in between.</p>

<p>Sam slid her hands up Brooke's thighs until they came to rest on the
brunette's hips.  Once she had reached her intended destination she then
slowly traced her finger along the seam of Brooke's pants until she reached
the button which she quickly popped open with a smile.  Once that was taken
care of, Sam grasped the tip of Brooke's zipper and slowly slid it down
before beginning to drag her hands up Brooke's abdomen once again, this time
taking the hem of her shirt with her.</p>

<p>Having dragged the shirt half way up Brooke's chest Sam left it where it was
and shifted her position so that she was lying instead of sitting in between
Brooke's leg and lowered her mouth to the smooth skin of Brooke's stomach.
She then traced her teeth on a downwards path along the smooth expanse of
skin until she reached the waist band of Brooke's panties, which she
sensuously dipped her tongue under before licking a path up towards Brooke's
navel.   Brooke arched up into Sam's mouth as the brunette continued to
tease her in the most delicious of ways, an almost guttural moan escaping
from her lips.</p>

<p>"I know," Sam began her hands slipping underneath Brooke and around to her
back, "that you said you weren't going to have your way with me," she
continued as she deftly unclasped the blonde's bra. "But I," she went on
brining her hand back to the front of Brooke's body, "made no such promise."
  And with that she slid up Brooke's body heatedly pressing their lips
together as her hand slipped under Brooke's now unclasped bra to massage the
tender mound of flesh underneath.</p>

<p>Brooke bucked up into Sam's busy hands, groaning into the kiss as her own
hands began to roam over Sam's body frantically.</p>

<p>Sam broke the contact between their lips momentarily as she freed Brooke
from the confines of her shirt, despite the blondes muttered please of
disapproval at the loss of contact between them.  Then once that was done,
Sam once again returned her lips to Brooke's hungrily as both of their hands
began to roam once more.</p>

<p>
Brooke's body quivered upon hearing the sound torn from Sam as the blonde
worked her leg in between the brunettes, and she gasped ecstatically when
she felt Sam press down against her and nip at her neck desperately.
Brooke's body then began to tremble violently as she felt Sam slide down on
he thigh until the brunette's groin was resting snugly against her hips and
her hand slipped under the waistband of Brooke's panties towards the center
of her molten hot desire.</p>

<p>As Sam slowly entered her, Brooke's eyes fluttered shut and her lips parted
sensuously, a low, sexy moan escaping from deep within her throat as Sam
began to move within her.  As Brooke's hips rose to meet Sam's questing
fingers she could feel the brunette grinding against her hip bone urgently
as she sucked on her bottom lip and her breath came in shallow pants.</p>

<p>Brooke reached up desperately bringing her hand to the side of Sam's face,
and ran her thumb across her lips tenderly before leaning up and crushing
their lips together as Sam entered her one last time and Brooke tensed,
moaning her release into Sam's mouth as her body began and shake intensely.</p>

<p>A moment later Brooke felt Sam stiffen as well; lovingly holding onto the
girl as her body quaked and her breathing hitched before her eyes fluttered
shut and she collapsed on top of the cheerleader, where they stayed together
as their breathing calmed and their hearts slowed back to their normal
paces.</p>

<p>Once she felt that she once again had control of her faculties, Brooke
raised her hand to Sam's forehead-which was nestled against her shoulder-and
brushed back a few arrant strands of dark hair before pressing her lips to
Sam's temple softly.</p>

<p>"I hope you know," Brooke began softly as she ran her hand along Sam's back
soothingly, "that Sugar Daddy is never going to let me borrow his truck
again," she finished gravely.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence after Brooke spoke that was then interrupted
as Sam began to laugh burying her face even deeper into Brooke's neck and
hugging the blonde towards her.</p>
