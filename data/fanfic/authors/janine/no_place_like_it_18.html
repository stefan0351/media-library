<p>Karen entered the kitchen clutching a folder in her hand
heading towards the fridge before spotting her daughters hunched over figure at the table.
Stopping halfway to her previous destination she turned her attention towards Jessie who
was staring intently at one of the many books spread out before her. She sighed and turned
her attention to the window, it was a beautiful summer day outside, Jessie shouldn't
be cooped up in the kitchen reading by herself.</p>

<p>"You work too hard," Karen said softly as she
walked over to the table.</p>

<p>"You worry about me too much," Jessie responded
her lips quirking up into a smile as she recalled that they had this conversation before.</p>

<p>"I think that you should..." Karen started to
say, but Jessie interrupted her knowing what her mother was about to say and not really
wanting to hear it.</p>

<p>"Henry's already taken," Jessie quipped, her
eyes never leaving her books.</p>

<p>"You're funny," Karen replied not at all
amused. "Jessie..." she started again.</p>

<p>"Mom, I'm fine," Jessie said shortly,
finally looking up from her books and turning to face her mother. "I know you worry
about me but you don't have to, I really am fine," she continued sighing.
"I want things alright, right now I want this," she went on waving to the books
spread out in front of her. "I want to be alone," she continued her eyes meeting
her mothers steadily. "I want to find out who I am, separate from being half of a
couple. I don't need anyone in my life right now, so you worrying about me not having
someone is an exercise in futility."</p>

<p>"You're at the language section aren't
you?" Karen asked looking down at the books covering her table. The truth was she
believed her daughter was telling the truth, last summer and for most of the school year
had been rough for Jessie, had been rough for everyone who cared about her. She'd
been quiet, and listless and sullen, and her eyes, which Karen had gotten used to
sparkling continually, had seemed to burn out. But over the last few months, she had been
getting better. She'd started talking more, and eating more - for which Karen
was eternally grateful - and her eyes had begun to show some signs of life again. It
was just that she just hated seeing her children less than blissful and now that Eli had
seemingly gotten his act together, all of her doting could be directed at Jessie.</p>

<p>"Go," Jessie said finally, waving at her mother
tired now of the woman looking at her with those thoughtful eyes. "You're going
to be late for your appointment."</p>

<p>Karen looked down at her watch at this and sighed. Jessie
was right, she and Henry were supposed to be meeting with the florists in ten minutes.
She'd forgotten how much work planning a wedding was.</p>

<p>"Try and get outside for a least a few minutes
won't you," Karen said standing up.</p>

<p>"Will do," Jessie replied saluting her.</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll see you later," she said, and
with that she was out the door.</p>

<p>Jessie watched her mother disappear out the door, before
bringing her hand to her head, rubbing at her eyes before allowing her gaze to drift
towards the window for a moment. It was a nice day out she realized, her mom was right,
she should go outside for a while. It was a nice day, she thought to herself again, her
lips curving up slightly. And with that she picked up a few of the books surrounding her
and headed for the door as well.</p>
