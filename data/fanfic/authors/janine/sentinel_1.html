<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 1 -->

<p>I could feel the cold from the floor against my skin, but it didn't  matter because I was already chilled.  I sat with my back up against  the wall, curved, hunched over.  My head hung limply.  My eyes were  open, I know this because I remember seeing white, it must have been  the floor, blurry and wet with my tears.  The room hummed, the gentle  buzz of electronic devices filling the air.   </p>

<p>I must have been sitting there for hours, I know that's what it felt  like as my bones ached and cracked, my muscles cramping as I stood up  later.  People were there too, I remember people coming into the room  at various times, doctors and nurses.  I knew when they came in  because they changed the sound, disturbed the hum, the rumblings of  their voices disturbing our solitude.  They were talking to  me, `let's go for a walk', `can I bring you something to eat', `would  you like a pillow', `is there someone I can call', blah, blah, blah.   They all left eventually, finally realizing that stretching my legs,  or filling my stomach would do nothing to lessen my despair, that I  was inconsolable and that was the way I wanted it.  That or they got  tired of talking to themselves.</p>

<p>It was at Saturday, they were weekend staff so I forgive them.  They  couldn't have known any better.  To the others, the ones who were  there everyday, I had become like a ghost, haunting the room,  haunting the hallways.  And they knew, maybe they had seen it before  so they knew that I was in a place beyond words.  They would walk  into the room and carry out their tasks wordless, preserving the  silence and in return earning my gratitude, and then they would exit,  casting upon me tender sad looks.  Poor child, poor withering child  with her greasy hair and her bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>I had to share the room on occasion, but I felt no offense when it  was them, only closeness and understanding.  They knew because they  felt it too.  Even the little one was silent in that room, her tiny  breaths seeming even smaller, respectful of her older sister.  Every  time they visited mother would ask me if I was coming home and every  time I would say `maybe later'.  She would nod with those slightly  glazed eyes of her looking at me keenly, understanding and not  understanding at the same time.  I wouldn't leave until she woke up  and told me to, or until the flashing red light on her bedside  monitor ceased to glow.  They would stand then, preparing to leave  and as he walked by he would place a hand on my shoulder and squeeze  encouraging, giving strength to the sentinel watching over his  angel.  </p>

<p>One day the sounds changed.  I sat in some corner of the room, her  brooding babysitter, when I felt my heart stop.  Something was wrong,  the sounds had changed.  Immediately I looked towards her, to the  side of her bed.  It was still glowing.  I leaned forward, creaking  into an upright position slowly slouching over to where she lay.  My  body felt strange as it moved, like a rusted out bike brought out on  a summer's day.  </p>

<p>She exhaled.  It was barely audible and I knew at once I couldn't  possibly have heard it from where I was sitting before, and that it  was this tiny emission that woke me from my slumber and brought me to  her side.  </p>

<p>I stood there looking down at her watching as the sounds became  steadier, stronger.  Her eyelids began to flutter and my mouth parted  in anticipation.  Could it be, Snow White about to awaken?  And then  in a moment, without further warning, without the slightest mores  hesitation her eyes opened, and she was staring directly into my  stupefied face.</p>

<p>"Sam?" she asked.  Her voice cracked as she spoke and was barely more  than a whisper.</p>

<p>"I think so," was my response.  I managed to keep my voice from  cracking, but it was just as soft as hers.</p>

<p>"So it was real?" she asked as her body shook, rattled by coughs.</p>

<p>"A real live nightmare," I responded taking her hand in mine.  "Don't… you shouldn't talk, you've been asleep for a while."</p>

<p>"That's all the more reason to talk."  She coughed again, her hand  clutching mine more tightly.</p>

<p>"Please," I said lightly stroking the back of her hand with my  thumb.  "I'll go get someone.  A doctor."</p>

<p>"Don't leave me," she responded holding onto my hand more  determinedly.  I could have easily broken the hold she had upon me,  her grasp was week I could barely feel her fingers.  "Not now," she  added.  Or I think she added.  I've never been certain if that was a  figment of my own overtired mind, or if she had actually said it, and  I've never really wanted to ask.</p>

<p>"I won't," I responded.  And she smiled at me; pale and brittle like  an injured bird.  It was the most beautiful sight I had ever  seen.  "I'm glad you're awake."  I was sitting on the bed by the time  I said this and she turned to look up at me, her eyes big and  surprisingly bright.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I got to wake up to you."</p>

<p>This time it was me who smiled.</p>
