<p>"I don't know what to tell you sir…ma'am, sir, ma'am sir….ah, I really
don't know what to tell you," the man stuttered looking at Bio Glass
in stupification.  "We cleared the museum out over half an hour ago,
your girls aren't in there."</p>

<p>"You're an Arts major aren't you?"  Glass asked suspiciously as she
watched the little man suffer.  "Ah, ah, ah, don't speak.  Look," she
said pointing to the line of Kennedy students lined up against the
bus.  "There, what do you see there?" she asked pointing to a gaping
whole in the line.</p>

<p>"Nnnothing," the man stuttered.</p>

<p>"Exactly, that gaping void is where *snap* McPherson and *snap*
McQueen should be," Glass replied moving closer to him so that she was
now carrying out a full on invasion of his personal space.  "Do you
know why they aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Mmmight, might I suggest ma'am, sir, ma'am, si…might I suggest that
they walked down the street to see Nsync at Radio City," he managed to
emote, though it was quite a struggle.</p>

<p>The students lined up against the bus cringed as they heard this,
cowering slightly and shielding their eyes.  He should not have said
that.</p>
