<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 44 -->

<p>Mike closed the study door with a shake of his head.  He couldn't
believe he had forgotten to fax those papers to the office in
Singapore.  Then again considering the stress he had been under for
the past few days, he realized that it was only bound to happen.  He
was just glad that he remembered in time to send them.  As he headed
to the stairs he heard Brooke's voice, and stopped his movements.
Turning around he looked into the kitchen, spotting two figures
silhouetted in the moonlight.  Blending into the shadows he watched
the scene unfolding in front of him.</p>

<p>Brooke watched Sam with hooded eyes as she rested her weight on the
kitchen table.  "You look miserable," she commented finally.  With
the way everything had been since their parents found out, they
hadn't had much time to spend together, even to talk, and now that
they had stumbled across some alone time, Brooke wasn't going to
waste it brooding in the dark.</p>

<p>"So do you," Sam responded, her lips twitching, but not able to form
a smile.  Her eyes didn't even try, maintaining that haunted look
throughout her statement.</p>

<p>"That's because I am," Brooke responded with a weary half smile of
her own.  Her voice sounded distant, even to her, and she wondered if
she looked as worn-out as she felt.  The past few days seemed to have
sucked everything out of her.  Her reserves were depleted, and she
knew it was beginning to show.  She wanted to stay strong for Sam,
but she could feel herself crumbling too.</p>

<p>"I guess it goes without saying that I am too," Sam responded
lowering her gaze to the floor, where it remained for a long moment.
When she finally looked up, she sniffed and Brooke could see her
trying to blink back tears.  She raised her eyes to ceiling and
breathed out, "God, I hate this.  I feel like something's breaking
inside of me," she continued a tear escaping the prison of her eye
lashes and trailing down her face.</p>

<p>Brooke pushed herself off the table when she saw this and crossed the
short distance over to Sam, regarding her helplessly for a moment
before reaching out her hand and placing it on Sam's cheek, stroking
the soft skin gently with her thumb.  "Please," Brooke said in almost
pleading tone.  "Don't cry.  I don't think I could take it if you
cried," she continued resting her forehead against Sam's.  "It'll be
okay," she said, she could still feel tiny shivers running through
the brunette's body.  She took her free hand and joined their fingers
together.  "We shall overcome," she went on somewhat desperately.  It
paid off however, since she heard Sam chuckle softly, and
whisper, "thanks Mrs. Tubman," before she buried her head in Brooke's
neck, drawing the blonde into a hug.</p>

<p>After a moment, once she was sure that Sam was no longer crying,
Brooke stepped back slightly so that she could see the entirety of
Sam's face.  She raised her hand to Sam's cheek once again, stroking
it as she had before, a contemplative look on her face.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you something," she began a moment later, her
voice low, but intense.  "And no matter what happens I want you to
remember this.  I love you," she said stressing each of the three
words.  "Before you, I was walking in shadows, you showed me the
sun.  And, he can ground me, or send me off to England where I'll
start referring to underwear as knickers, but it won't change the
fact that I love you.  I want you to remember that, to know that
you're my heart," she concluded.  Her voice had cracked a few times
as she spoke, and she knew that she too know bore the telltale signs
of fallen tears.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that," Sam responded immediately.  "Like it's
already over. It can't be over.  I need you," she continued another
tear running down her face as she stepped into Brooke once more where
she was enveloped into an almost desperate hug.</p>

<p>Finally, pulling herself together, Brooke turned her head to the side
and placed a soft kiss on the side of Sam's forehead.  "It'll be
alright," she said softly.  Her tone was suppose to be reassuring,
but in it Sam could hear that Brooke was just as lost as her, just as
confused and heartbroken, and scared.  She didn't know that things
would be alright, she just hoped they would.  She tightened the hold
she had on the cheerleader.</p>

<p>Mike slipped away after this, heading towards the stairs making very
certain that they wouldn't see him.  He made his way up the stairs on
unsteady legs, quite shaken by what he had witnessed.  Until he saw
them there, interacting with each other so tenderly, he had truly
thought that their relationship was just some kind of teen fling, but
the agony in their voices couldn't be denied. The broken heartedness
in Brooke's voice and Sam's tears had been evidence enough to force
him to reconsider his thoughts on the situation.  He realized that
they sincerely meant something to each other, and although he wasn't
sure how, he knew that that changed things.</p>
