<!-- The Closet \ Part Nineteen -->

<p>Sam sensuously extended her tongue, her eyes sparkling with unspoken
promise.  Keeping those eyes locked on Brooke's Sam then slowly
flicked her tongue upwards clearing a path on the strawberry Brooke
was holding which was otherwise covered in whip cream.  Brooke gasped
and Sam smiled wickedly, lowering her mouth once more to take the
entire strawberry in, sucking on it until every trace of whip cream
was removed.  Then she sumptuously bit down on the fruit, moaning
gratuitously as she chewed on it, leaving a gaping, shallow breathed
Brooke staring at her in wonder.</p>

<p>"That is like the most amazing thing I've even seen," Brooke managed
to chock out as she watched Sam lick her lips.</p>

<p>"This is much better than the Lion King isn't it?" Sam asked, a
playful yet sexy smile spreading across her face.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Brooke responded leaning forward and bringing their lips
together, the taste of strawberries mixed with Sam's natural flavor
sending a shiver through her body.  It truly amazed her what Sam was
able to do to her body, the feelings the brunette was able to inspire
in her.  When they weren't touching-which was very, very rarely-Brooke
was over taken by the need to write bad poetry about her, and it
excited Brooke to no end because she had never felt the need to write
bad poetry before and she liked the feeling.</p>

<p>Sam leaned back, falling against the mattress as Brooke leaned into
and then over her.  She could sense the blonde's excitement, feel her
body humming more and more as their embrace continued.  She felt
Brooke's hand make its way under her shirt and begin to slide up her
torso.  She body arched up, and anxiously she sought out Brooke's
lips, desperately needing to feel connected to her, to feel her
passion.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooked groaned dropping her down onto the brunette's shoulder,
"being this close to you is doing things to me."</p>

<p>"What kinds of things?" Sam asked as her hands ran up Brooke's sides
and across her back.</p>

<p>"Naughty things, I'm wanting to touch," Brooke responded raising her
head and looking down at Sam, "more and more of you," she continued
her eyes lowering to take in what was exposed of Sam's body.  "And I
know that we've just started to…explore what's happening between us,
and that things are progressing rather quickly, and that if I'm to
avoid an excruciating number of cold showers…"</p>

<p>"We should probably watch one of the ten dollar movies on Cinemax and
finish our dinner?" Sam interjected.</p>

<p>"Well, yeah, I mean to quote the great vocalist Monica 'I should make
a move but I won't, I know you're probably thinking something is
wrong, knowing if I do that it won't be right, I wanna get down, but
not the first night'" Brooke responded, her lip quivering it the
sweetest of ways as she recited the lyrics.  "I mean, I know lying on
top of you, groping you probably constitutes making a move, but the
rest of it…" she continued trailing off.</p>

<p>"The getting down part?" Sam asked watching Brooke carefully.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that part," Brooke replied meeting Sam's gaze.</p>

<p>"You don't wanna do that part?" Sam asked her eyes still trained on
Brooke but her face revealing nothing.</p>

<p>"No, I wanna do that part, I wanna do that part so much that I'm in
actual physical pain here.  I was just thinking that, we probably
shouldn't rush…."</p>

<p>"I know," Sam replied leaning forward and bringing her lips to
Brooke's softly.  "You're right, I was just playing with you…old
habits die hard you know," she continued grinning.  "And just so you
know," Sam continued as she extended her arm to the side groping
around for and then finding the remote, "I really, really wanna do
that part to."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled and rolled off of Sam, sighing and starring at the
ceiling.  "We're not watching anything with Steven Segal in it."</p>

<p>"Even when we were pretending to dislike each other I would never have
inflicted such a horror upon myself simply to torture you," Sam
responded flipping the television on with a smirk.  Brooke placed her
hands behind her head smiling herself while wondering why it had taken
her so long to realize that Sam was an original and utterly fantastic.</p>
