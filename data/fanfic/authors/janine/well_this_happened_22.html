<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 22 -->

<p>Brooke practically skipped into the house, her body fused with vim and
vigor.  She was a happy girl, she could as well have been in a musical
comedy for all of the saccharine that streaming out of her every pore. In
other words she was having a good afternoon.  Hearing a movement in the
living room, Brooke placed her prize behind her back and carefully moved
forward to see who it was.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke greeted spotting Jane.  If she had been in anything other the
completely euphoric mood she was in, she would have noticed that the older
woman looked a little pale, and slightly dazed, but she was in the
completely euphoric mood she was in and she didn't notice that the older
woman was a little pale and dazed.  "Is Sam home?" she asked trying not to
sound totally like a kid at a candy factory.</p>

<p>"She's upstairs," Jane responded shaking herself out of the stupor she had
been in ever since she had left her daughters bedroom.  "You're in a good
mood," she commented noticing Brooke's sudden animation.  It surprised her,
because for the last couple of days both she and Sam had been moping around
like they were straight out of an after school special.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke agreed leaving it at that.  Somehow she didn't think that
declaring that she had come to terms with the social implications of  the
love she felt for Jane's daughter, would go over well so she decided that a
simple 'yeah' would do the trick.  "Later," she continued a moment later as
she began to maneuver herself so that Jane couldn't see what was behind her
back.  She then quickly made her way to and up the stairs, just barely
hearing Jane's comment that she was heading out to the grocery store as she
continued her ascent.</p>

<p>Sam's door was slightly ajar when Brooke reached it; this she took as a sign
from God to continue so she did so without reservation.  Once in the room,
she spotted Sam typing diligently away at her computer.  Two months ago this
sight would have terrified Brooke to the very marrow of her bones, since the
brunette had had an uncanny way of focusing a great majority of her work on
Brooke-the reason why Brooke now knew and it turned her frown upside
down-but now the blonde just found the display terrible cute.  Closing the
door behind her silently, Brooke snuck up behind Sam, bent down and wrapped
one of her arms around the girl so that all that stood between them was the
back of the chair.</p>

<p>"I saw you," Sam stated.  But Brooke had felt her jump momentarily at the
first touch of her arm and knew better.</p>

<p>"Of course you did,"  the blonde responded with an indulgent smile that she
was probably lucky Sam couldn't see.  "Pour vous," Brooke continued a second
later unfurling the arm which had remained behind her back, presenting Sam
with a single red rose.</p>

<p>At that sight of the rose Sam turned around to look into Brooke's smiling
face.  "Thank you," she breathed.</p>

<p>"You're welcome," Brooke said raising herself a little so that she could
bring her lips to Sam's.</p>

<p>"You're in a good mood," Sam commented once they separated.  She could feel
the energy coming off of Brooke in waves.  It was actually quite
intoxicating and, not for the first time by any means, Sam wished that they
had the house to themselves once again.  She really, really wished that they
had the house to themselves.  Really.  Really.</p>

<p>"So I keep hearing," Brooke responded standing up and moving to lean against
the corner of Sam's desk.  "I talked to Nicole today."</p>

<p>"I take it things went well," Sam replied, surprised but pleased.  Maybe
Brooke hadn't been projecting when she said that Nicole actually had a heart
buried somewhere in the deep Siberian mine shaft she called a heart.</p>

<p>"Eventually," Brooke said half sighing dramatically.  "I only had to have a
nervous breakdown, before things started to go really well."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd been really tense for the past couple of days, I have a
tendency to bottle up emotions, and today I basically caved in like Rosie
O'Donnell at a Hostess sale.  Nicole…picked up the pieces," Brooke related
in a steady tone, though her face revealed some of the emotions that she
must have gone through during their confrontation.</p>

<p>"So she not going to tell?" Sam asked just to clear things up.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Brooke responded.  She was quiet for a moment after
that, then she smiled.  "But that's not the issue.  The truth is somewhere
after the begging, and towards the end of the breakdown I realized that I
don't care if she tells…and *that* feels pretty excellent," she continued,
before pausing once more.  "Unless you care, because I can threaten her if
you want."</p>

<p>Sam smiled at the last part because she was sure that Brooke would do it.
She was finally beginning to realize that as much as she was powerless when
it came to Brooke, Brooke was powerless when it came to her.  She found it
oddly comforting.  "That's sweet, but not necessary.  I'm sleeping with the
head cheerleader, I've already gotten my props."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled then swooped in kissing Sam's cheek before moving so that she
kneeling beside Sam's chair.</p>

<p>"What are you doing later?" the cheerleader asked.  "Nothing?  Good," she
continued before Sam had a chance to respond.  "I was hoping you'd say
that."</p>

<p>"Let me guess?  You have an idea," Sam replied looking down at Brooke
curiously.  "It better not involve the removal of clothes and a tub of
jello."</p>

<p>"That was just a suggestion," Brooke responded although she leered at Sam
suggestively anyway.  "Actually," she continued ignoring the look Sam shot
her, "I have reservations."</p>

<p>"Reservations about what?"  Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Reservations at a restaurant," Brooke clarified.</p>

<p>"A restaurant?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"A restaurant," Brooke confirmed.</p>

<p>Sam looked at her blankly, and Brooke smiled again standing up and pulling
out Sam's chair.  Once Sam's legs were free of the desk she then sat down on
the brunette's lap and draped her arm around the back of the chair.  Sam
looked at her with a bemused expression but didn't still didn't say
anything.</p>

<p>"This is me," Brooke started, "asking you to accompany me to dinner tonight.
  Dinner at a restaurant, one with menus and waiters, and cheesy elevator
music and those cute little dessert trolleys."</p>

<p>"A date?" Sam asked looking up at Brooke.</p>

<p>"Yeah, an honest to God date," Brooke responded.  "I think it's about time,
don't you?" she asked smiling.</p>

<p>"And here I thought all this time I had been dating the cheapest woman in
the world," Sam replied with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, mamma hit the jackpot and who better to spend it on than her
bitch," Brooke responded leaning in and rubbing her nose against Sam's,
effectively diffusing any scathing response the brunette could have come up
with.</p>

<p>"Were you born this charming, or is this the result of tireless hours of
practice?" Sam asked sarcastically though a beautiful smile was gracing her
equally beautiful lips.</p>

<p>"I'm all natural baby," Brooke responded bringing their lips together
playfully.</p>

<p>"Tell that to Clairol," Sam replied a wicked grin spreading across her face.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Brooke stated drawing her head
back slightly so that she could see Sam's face.</p>

<p>"I've seen the bottles," Sam responded, the smile never having left her
face.</p>

<p>"That's…it's just to lighten it," Brooke stammered.</p>

<p>"I love you anyway," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"That's very big of you," Brooke commented.</p>

<p>"I know.  That's why I'm fabulous," Sam agreed.</p>

<p>"Shut up and gimme some sugar," Brooke responded smiling as she leaned in.
Sam smiled back and brought her head forward bringing their lips together in
a deep, passionate kiss.  "Come on," Brooke said softly when they separated,
taking Sam's hand into her own.</p>

<p>"Where?" Sam asked, allowing Brooke to lead her nevertheless.</p>

<p>"To the door," Brooke responded walking them over to said object which she
locked upon their arrival.  "Then to bed," she continued once again leading
Sam by the hand to the object in question.</p>

<p>"My mom," Sam started.</p>

<p>"Your mom's gone grocery shopping," Brooke responded with a wide smile as
she lifted the laundry basket resting on the bed to the floor.  "We have the
house all to ourselves."</p>

<p>"I wish I had a million dollars," Sam whispered as a smile covered her face.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked quizzically drawing Sam towards her all the same.</p>

<p>"When you first came in, I wished that we had the house all to ourselves
again," Sam responded placing her hands on Brooke's hips.  "Since that wish
came true, I just thought that I'd cover my bases," she continued as her
hands found there way under Brooke's shirt.</p>

<p>"That's my girl," Brooke responded before leaning forward and pressing her
lips Sam's.  As she did this Sam slipped her hands underneath Brooke's
shirt, massaging the soft skin there as she leaned into Brooke and felt her
body begin to hum.  After minutes, or hours, or a life time-Sam wasn't sure
which and really didn't care-Brooke pulled away from her minutely, only mere
centimeters separating them and looked at Sam with wide open eyes.  Her
cheeks slightly flushed, and her lips slightly parted she stood there,
offering herself to Sam.</p>

<p>Sam immediately began to push the material of Brooke's shirt up but with an
almost painful slowness, her eyes taking in every inch of skin as it was
revealed, worshipping not just the body but the girl in front of her.
Pulling the shirt over Brooke's head Sam let it fall to the floor absently
as she leaned in and attached her lips to Brooke's neck, licking and kissing
her skin sensuously but hungrily.  Leaving a wet trail in her wake Sam made
her way over to Brooke's shoulder, nipping at the skin as her hands made
there way behind Brooke's back and unhooked her bra.</p>

<p>Stepping back Sam then raised her hands to Brooke's shoulder and freed the
blonde from the confines of her bra before renewing the contact between
them, just into time to hear Brooke gasp slightly and feel the tremble that
ran through her body.  Ducking her head down Sam placed her lips over
Brooke's heart kissing her, then trailed her way in between the valley of
the cheerleaders breasts and down her stomach to the waist band of her
pants.  With her head now level with Brooke's waist Sam ran her hands up
Brooke's legs bringing them to the waist band of her pants and unhooked
them, slowly drawing the zipper down, then peeling the parasuco's off of the
blonde's body.</p>

<p>Standing up and taking a step back once Brooke was free of the garment, Sam
gazed at Brooke, who was standing perfectly still allowing the inspection
without the slightest sign of protest.</p>

<p>"How can you do that?" Brooke asked softly as Sam watched her, a note of
wonder creeping into her voice.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked drawing her eyes to Brooke's.</p>

<p>"Look at me like you've never seen me before," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>"Because every time I see you it *is* like the first time," Sam replied as
reverently as Brooke had posed the question, a gentle smile crossing her
lips as she raised her hands to her own body and began to disrobe.  Brooke
reached out for her, but Sam stepped back shaking her head, that gentle
smile she had gradually turning impish.  Brooke returned to her former
position, settling herself to the idea that this was now Sam's show.
Actually, as the brunette began to left her shirt up teasingly and caressed
her own abdomen sexily, Brooke had to admit that she really couldn't find
anything wrong with that.  Teasing Brooke with her excruciatingly slow
movements Sam revealed herself inch by inch, never letting Brooke touch her
until she was completely undressed.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Brooke breathed out desperately when Sam finally freed her from
her prison and allowed their skin to meet for the first time.  Pressing
herself firmly against the brunette Brooke brought their lips together, her
hands roaming over Sam's body franticly, as Sam moaned and arched into her.</p>

<p>Somehow, neither one of them actually certain how it actually happened, they
ended up on the bed, Brooke smiling and leaning over Sam.  The brunette
responded to their new position by pulling Brooke's mouth down to hers,
forcing the blonde to drape her body over Sam's completely, so that almost
every part of them was in contact.</p>

<p>Breaking the contact between their lips almost regretfully Brooke dropped
her head down and began to shower kisses along Sam's neck, trailing her lips
across her collar bone and then downwards, encircling Sam's right breast
with sweet kisses.  Sam arched up into Brooke's mouth, crying out into the
still of the room, her sounds of passion exciting Brooke even further as the
blonde captured Sam's nipple in her eager mouth.  As Brooke's lips
concentrated on Sam's chest, her hands once again began to explore the
brunette's body, another moan escaping the confines of Sam's lips as
Brooke's fingers danced along her torso causing waves of pleasure to roll
over Sam, her head turning to the side as she bit down on her lips hotly.</p>

<p>Slowly, adoringly Brooke kissed her way down Sam's body, as her hands rose
to take over where her lips had left off.  Sam's breath caught in her
throat, and her eyes closed, a decidedly erotic sound making it's way from
deep within her which brought an answering whimper from Brooke.</p>

<p>Now dragging her hand down, Brooke let her hand intimately explore the
smooth, soft flesh before removing her lips from Sam's abdomen and looking
up at Sam's face; her eyes were closed and her bottom lip snared between her
teeth erotically.  Brooke watched her with something close to awe.  Her hand
stopped it's movements, and she stayed in the position she was in watching
Sam, silently wishing that she would open her eyes.  And when those brown
orbs did flutter open Brooke was captured by their vibrancy, her breath
hitching with look of raw passion clouding them, directed at her.  Not
taking her eyes off of Sam's Brooke shifted her position slightly, moving
further down on the bed, then lowered her lips the flesh of Sam's inner
thighs, licking and kissing the skin she found there passionately.</p>

<p>Sensations were running rampant throughout Sam's body, wonderful,
exhilarating feelings that seemed to engulf her completely as Brooke kissed
her way up Sam's legs. When the blonde finally reached her intended
destination, her tongue slipped out and dipped between the folds of Sam's
sex with an indolence that was almost unbearable yet maddeningly exciting at
the same time. Sam's eyes once again closed at the touch of Brooke's mouth
to the center of her being, despite the fact that she was desperately
willing them to stay open, and her hands grasped at her sheets, her fingers
retracting into fists as she grabbed handfuls of sheet and her body
undulated.</p>

<p>Prying her eyes open with an almost superhuman force, Sam's eyes held the
blue of Brooke's for a moment before she felt the blonde's mouth close
around the bud of her pleasure and her fingers slipped inside of her, moving
in and out of her attentively as Brooke lips and tongue caressed the nucleus
of her pleasure.  Sam's body rose and fell vigorously, as her right hand
clutched at the sheets beside her and her left hand held Brooke firmly in
place, as if there was any place else the blonde would rather have been.
Brooke reveled in Sam's death grip as she felt the body beneath hers tense,
Sam's body rising one last time before the physical and emotional pleasure
she was feeling finally cumulated into one mind-blowing orgasm that washed
over her like a tidal wave, her body shaking and shivering as she moaned
Brooke's name over and over again.</p>

<p>Sam reached out blindly drawing Brooke upwards needing to feel every inch of
the cheerleader against her.  Raising herself up, Brooke planted small
kisses along Sam's body as the brunette's body came under control.  Raising
her face above Sam's, Brooke simply gazed at her until she felt Sam's hand
come to rest on her cheek and caught those magnificent eyes watching her.
Having already learned that words often failed her at moments like this
Brooke simply leaned down and brought her lips to Sam's once more, trying to
pour everything that she felt for her into it, trying to make her kiss the
embodiment of her love.</p>

<p>Breaking from the kiss Sam stroked the side of Brooke's face gently, her
fingers following a pattern only she could detect on the warm skin of the
blonde's face.  "What are you thinking?" Sam asked, truly having no idea
what the cheerleader was thinking.  She had discovered that after they made
love Brooke's mind usually wandered to strange yet wondrous places.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her head to side and could just see over the edge of the bed
to the laundry basket lying on the floor.  "I think that we should do this
load," Brooke responded decisively.  Sam rolled her eyes and tilted her head
up to the ceiling, her body trembling with barely restrained laughter.</p>
