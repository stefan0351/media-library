<p>By the time Buffy and I made it over to
them, Xander was hyperventilating, and Faith was just standing there watching
us with a smirk on her face. Buffy and I were just starting to get used
to the whole idea of 'us', and while we always knew we were going to tell
our friends, we just didn't plan on doing it so soon. I was expecting at
least a couple of months of 'us' time, not merely the forty-eight hours
of it that we ended up having to share with demons. We had hardly had anytime
to sort anything out, yet here we were.</p>

<p>"You saw?" Buffy asked, though it was really
more of a statement. It would really have been a miracle if they hadn't
seen.</p>

<p>"Ohhhh, yeah!" Faith responded, her eyes
flickering back to the bench for a moment before settling back on us. She
actually looked excited. There was a glint in her eyes, I was sure of it.</p>

<p>"In that case, this Slayer votes two thumbs
up for a change in local," Buffy responded after glancing at me briefly.
"Anyone want to bang the gavel?" She asked. She knew that wouldn't feel
comfortable having what was soon to turn into a very private discussion
in the middle of the park, and I was glad she suggested we leave. The time
it would take us to re-locate would also give me some time to gather my
thoughts, and they did need gathering. When no objections were voiced she
continued. "We can go to my house, moms not due back 'til tomorrow." Once
we all agreed we started towards Summer's manor.</p>

<p>The beginning leg of the trip was very
quiet. I wasn't even aware that my legs were moving really, it was just
an automatic. I knew how I felt about Buffy, that wasn't even a question,
and I knew how she felt about me. The problem was that I wasn't sure if
I was ready to talk about it with other people. This wasn't exactly a subject
that people were eager to discuss, it was more like something that was
to be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>Once we were on our way Buffy dropped back
from the lead to walk beside me letting Xander and Faith lead the way.
Once we were side by side she took my hand in hers and squeezed it.</p>

<p>"Are you alright with this?" she whispered,
indicating to our joined hands. I simply nodded my head. It felt good to
feel her, to know she was there, it helped anchor me, bring me back to
reality. Something that I desperately needed. "How're you doing?" she continued,
this time she was referring to the whole situation.</p>

<p>"You mean being caught in the act?" I whispered
back. She nodded an affirmative but continued to look at the ground. "I'm
not sure, I'm kinda just here. You know? I wasn't expecting this so soon.
It's like getting hit with a spitball…you knew it was coming, but it's
still a surprise when it smacks you on the side of the face," I told her
shrugging my shoulders helplessly.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she responded probably choosing
to ignore the spitball reference. I knew I would if I was her. As we walked
her gaze continued to be locked on the ground and her hands were sweating
slightly. Despite the calm demeanor she was putting forward I knew that
she was as nervous about the prospect of talking to them as I was. "Faith
seems to be handling it rather well," she commented softly a moment later
scuffing her boot against the ground.</p>

<p>"Faith has probably done this before,"
I responded derisively. I wasn't just being a smart-ass either, I actually
had something in mind that resembled a fact when I said it. A couple of
times when we were out getting mocha's at the Expresso pump, I had noticed
Faith checking out the pump girl. Not to mention she was always way to
eager to go get us coffee. That and the fact that the girl had gotten around.</p>

<p>"Picked up on that too, huh?" Buffy asked
with a lopsided grin. I smiled back and it kind of lessened the tension
for the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>Once we neared Buffy's house she took the
lead again so that Xander and Faith wouldn't have to wait outside the house
for her. We headed to the family room once we were inside and kind of scattered
around the room as Buffy headed into the kitchen to get us something to
drink. Faith was idly playing with a stake, and Xander was looking everywhere
and at everything in the room except for me. Either he was avoiding my
gaze, or the trim around Buffy's walls were very captivating. When Buffy
finally came back with the drinks--that none of us really wanted-- we sat
there in silence for a long, long, long time before it was broken.</p>

<p>"So is this why you two wanted my room
last night?" Faith asked in her usually subtle way. Truthfully, I couldn't
say that I was surprised that she broke the silence, or at the question
she asked.</p>

<p>"Tact, Faith, look it up," Buffy said fixing
her with a stare.</p>

<p>"I thought there was suppose to be discussion.
So, let's discuss," Faith said, wriggling a little deeper into the couch.
She was obviously ready to talk, and I knew that Buffy just wanted to get
it over with like I did, which only left one person.</p>

<p>"Xander?" I asked quietly. He hadn't said
anything since his jabbering in the park, and I was starting to worry about
what he might be thinking. Quiet usually never meant anything good with
Xander. Even when he was bleeding and dying he was talking away. He looked
up at me when I said his name with an unreadable expression on his face.
Even after I said his name he remained quiet for a moment.</p>

<p>"This," he said motioning between Buffy
and I, "has been going on for how long?"</p>

<p>"Not long," Buffy responded carefully.
Then the silence came again, and stayed that way for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"So are you two, like, serious?" Faith
asked, making a totally inappropriate hand gesture that implied sex. Once
again, I couldn't say that I was surprised.</p>

<p>"It's serious," Buffy responded before
I could say anything. "Which doesn't necessarily mean…" then Buffy repeated
the hand gesture made a moment before.</p>

<p>"So you haven't…" and Faith made the gesture
again.</p>

<p>"What I said was, that the fact that what's
happening between us is definitely more than a 'thing' doesn't mean that
we must be…" and Buffy repeated the gesture yet again.</p>

<p>"Can you please stop doing that?" I asked,
cutting off whatever reply Faith was going to make. I didn't appreciate
having what Buffy and I shared reduced down to vulgar hand motions, hand
motions that had the subtlety of a battering ram.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Buffy said quietly realizing what
she had been doing. We looked at each other for a moment and I knew that
she really was sorry. She had only been trying to help.</p>

<p>"Ditto," Faith mumbled. Tearing my gaze
away from Buffy I looked at her, studying for expression for a moment.
In the entire time I had known her I didn't think that I had heard Faith
mutter anything that could be interpreted as an apology and I wasn't quite
sure what to make of it. After a careful analysis I could tell that she
meant it, which surprised me, but I decided to keep that to myself. Then
the quiet came once again.</p>

<p>"When'd you like…you know…start-having-feeling-of-a-sexual-nature-that-were-the-result-of-a-stimulus-
caused-by-a-person-of-the-same-gender-as-yourself?" Xander asked, rushing
the question off at such a speed that I couldn't compute. He was speaking
at, like, warp factor five.</p>

<p>"I don't know about the lovebirds, but
I completely lost you after '…you know…'," Faith said. "Think you could
repeat that so that those of us who weren't drinking coffee for an hour
previous to this conversation can understand?" she continued.</p>

<p>"A summation of the last part would be:
get gay?" Xander explained after a moment, turning slightly red. I looked
over at Buffy, we had yet to talk in depth about this. Talking a breath
I figured I would take the plunge first. After all, I had known him the
longest.</p>

<p>"I didn't 'get' gay," I started. "You can't
just 'get' gay, like you 'get' herpes, or athlete's foot, it's more like
it's there, but there's like pillows and stuff on top hiding it…like at
Easter, it's like an egg. Then you find it sooner or later…like…like a
scavenger hunt," I responded realizing that I probably should have thought
about that response before saying it out loud.</p>

<p>"Well….when did you find it? Where you
just looking for keys and, BAM?" Xander asked, clapping his hands together.</p>

<p>I decided to ignore the last part of Xander's
statement, and answered his first question, about when I found it. "What
month did you come to Sunnydale?" I asked Buffy, turning to face her.</p>

<p>"September," Buffy said softly, smiling
as she looked at me. We held each others gazes and I was overtaken by a
tingling fluttery warmth that started in my toes and settled in my heart.
It was an effect that only she could produce in me, something that I only
wanted her to produce in me.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I've got to throw up now,"
Faith said, sticking a finger in her mouth and making a gagging motion.</p>

<p>"He asked," Buffy responded flatly.</p>

<p>"What's your story B? Does it involve sleep
away camp?" Faith asked, smiling. She was doing that a lot tonight, smiling.
At least someone was enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>"Oddly enough sleep away camp doesn't figure
in. Except to explain my fear of meatloaf," Buffy responded, looking at
Faith before continuing. "More along the lines of detention. I developed
a crush on Ms. Mitchell my English teacher in eighth grade. She must have
wondered what I did to get sent to detention so much. Anyway, I just didn't
really think about back then, the way my life was it didn't really matter.
It hasn't really mattered until now," she finished with a shrug. Faith
seemed satisfied with that answer, and Xander just kind of sat there stewing
or brooding or whatever it was he had been doing all night.</p>

<p>"Did you forget that both of you have boyfriends?
Boy, being the operative word," Xander piped up a moment later as if he
was reminding us of something that had just slipped our minds.</p>

<p>"Actually we don't," Buffy pointed out.
She and Angel hadn't actually been dating since he came back from hell,
and Oz wasn't talking to me. Xander didn't have anything to say to that
right away, so in the pattern of the evening, the quiet came again.</p>

<p>"Is that a hickey?" Faith asked, studying
Buffy's neck intently. Looking where Faith's gaze was directed I saw a
slight discoloration and realized that it was, and if I was the swearing
type, I would've. Stupid Californian heat, if we lived in Michigan Buffy
would be wearing a turtle neck and we could've avoided the conversation
I was sure was going to ensue.</p>

<p>"Can't you get your mind out of your pants
for five minutes?" Buffy asked Faith irritably. She obviously knew where
this was leading as well.</p>

<p>"You're awfully cranky," Faith commented.
"Did we interrupt you two finding the fun, when we crashed your party on
the love bench? " Faith continued making a voice when she said the 'love
bench' part. It was said mockingly, and it reminded me of the way kids
used to sing the k-i-s-s-i-n-g part of the song about people in a tree.</p>

<p>"Shut up Faith," Buffy responded defensively.
I knew that Faith had a way of hitting Buffy's buttons--which usually resulted
in Buffy being pissed off almost to the point of no return-- and Faith
was off to a brilliant start at the moment.</p>

<p>"Well that settles it. You two must have
boinked or B wouldn't be all 'I'll huff and puff and blow your house down'."
Faith said with self-satisfied smirk as she crossed her arms and leaned
back. You would think that she had just solved the mystery of the Sphinx
or something.</p>

<p>"Unlike you Miss 'Get 'em drunk, get 'em
in bed and get 'em out', I don't boink. This isn't like one of your seedy
motel liaisons," Buffy responded, glaring at Faith. If looks could kill
the other Slayer would have been Dust-Buster chow.</p>

<p>"I'm not the one who was uncorked last
night, in a motel," Faith shot back, making sure to stress certain words
to get as much kick out of the sentence as she could.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Buffy repeated. I could practically
feel the anger rolling off of her in waves. This was not good, not good
at all.</p>

<p>"You looked pretty tired this morning so
I'm guessing it was good," Faith continued, not backing down.</p>

<p>"I mean it Faith, shut the hell up or get
the hell out. Either, or. I personally don't care," Buffy said, standing
up.</p>

<p>"Fine….bygones," Faith muttered after a
long moment before holding up her hands in the universal sign of peace.
Buffy continued to stare at her for an instant then finally sat down when
I placed my hand on her arm, tugging slightly. Faith was holding a white
flag up-tattered as it may be-and we were going to take it.</p>

<p>"So, are you two…dating?" Xander asked
once things had settled down. When he asked this I looked over at Buffy,
we had never really put a name to what we were. In fact when I thought
about it we hadn't really discussed a whole lot.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess. Yeah," Buffy answered looking
at me to make sure it was okay that she answered affirmatively.</p>

<p>After that, things calmed down and the
four of us sat talking for awhile longer, actually managing to have what
resembled a mature conversation. In total Xander and Faith were there for
about an hour. As we had observed on the way over, Faith didn't seem to
give a rat's ass that we were together other than to find out if we had
slept together--or as she so delicately put it "had done the horizontal
cha cha"--, and that nearly resulted in her and Buffy trading blows again.
Xander on the other hand was having more trouble with it, which was understandable
considering that we had had a thing, and that he had had a thing for Buffy
and probably still did. All things considered it could have gone worse.
It would take time for everyone to get used to the change in our relationship,
we were still getting used to the change in our relationship. It would
be awkward at the beginning, but it would be okay.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"How'd it go?" Buffy asked as I walked
back into the family room.</p>

<p>"They say they're starting to forget what
I look like, but that if I feel I absolutely must, I can stay," I related,
smiling. She was referring to the phone call I had just made to my parents.
They had gotten back to town about an hour after we had.</p>

<p>"Good," Buffy said, relieved, as she took
a seat on the couch. "Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"Yes and no," I responded. The talk with
Xander and Faith had taken a lot out of me emotionally but I wasn't really
ready to go to sleep yet. I was in one of those annoying states that's
a mix between being really tried and really pumped up simultaneously.</p>

<p>"That's not really a big help," Buffy said,
motioning for me to sit beside her. "The way I figure it, we're suffering
from 'post-conversation stress syndrome'. However, we're in luck since
the cure for this unique syndrome is the Jerry Springer show which just
happens to be on right now."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that?" I asked. It was
bad form to question a physician's advice, but I was curious.</p>

<p>"Simple, whatever we're going through,
demons included, will seem like a cake walk after we watch this. Sure I
hunt demons for a profession, but at least my mother didn't have the child
of my father's bisexual lovers brother," Buffy answered as I sat down.
Once I was seated Buffy put her arm around my shoulders and pulled me closer
to her so that I was almost lying on top of her. "Is this okay?" she asked
once we were settled.</p>

<p>"Better than okay." I answered with a smile.
I could feel the tension draining out of my body as I spoke. It was amazing
what being in her presence did to me. I was wound up so tightly by the
time Xander and Faith left, I was literally a tension ball, but the moment
she put her arms around me it all melted away. It was actually a very interesting
phenomenon that deserved extensive scientific study.</p>

<p>"How are you doing?" she asked, kissing
me on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Actually, I'm doing quite well right now,"
I responded playing with her hand which resting on my stomach. We were
snugglers, I could tell already. "Before good and I were not together,
but I think that everything will be okay. I mean it's not going to be kid's
day at the ex, but it should work out. Right?"</p>

<p>"It'll work out. Xander, we just need to
give some time. He's still in the militant 'but they'se be my women', other
wise known as the Cro-Magnon stage," Buffy answered thoughtfully as only
she could. "As for Faith, she's not going to give it rest until we make
videotape and send her a copy a la Pam and Tommy Lee."</p>

<p>"We're not going to do that though?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Well…" Buffy said thoughtfully as she
scratched her chin. I gave her the look of shame as only I can and she
smiled. "Okay, okay we'll have to come up with another plan," she relented.
"However, I would like to note that a recording would have been the most
expedient not to mention fun way of eliminating her interest," she continued,
wiggling her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Or generating more," I commented snuggling
in closer. I wasn't sure I wanted Faith that interested.</p>

<p>"True, that could create a whole new set
of problems. Problems that would probably involve the internet. The Watcher's
council would probably frown at nudie pictures of their Slayer and her
girlfriend being posted. It would contributes to a lack of credibility
amongst my demon foes," Buffy agreed. "Tired yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I responded sheepishly forcing my
eyes to stay open. They had started to drift shut as she was speaking.</p>

<p>"Okay, your sleepy, that's good. I thought
that maybe I was just frightfully boring… like Geraldo," she responded.
"Let's go upstairs," she continued, poking me in the ribs so that I would
get up.</p>

<p>"Hey," I muttered slapping her hand away.
Once I was up I turned to her again, "Is it okay if we don't…" I didn't
get a chance to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said gently taking my hand.
"It's like I told you this morning, I'm not a machine. I can kill evil
ones blindfolded but I'm not part of the family," she continued trying
to make me smile, which she succeeded in doing. Once that was taken care
of we continued up the stairs hand in hand.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Despite the fact that we spent the entire
weekend saving the world from a clan of vampires who had a disastrous special
power that could have brought down Western civilization as we knew it,
it was a Monday morning and we had to go to school. Buffy and I tried to
worm our way into staying home--which I must say Mrs. Summers was game
to after
hearing the edited version of our story-- however my parents who
remain in dark about pretty much everything involving me would hear nothing
of it. I got an ear full of, "You spent the entire weekend 'partying down'
and if you think you're going to miss school because you and your friends
thought it would be 'cool' to go gallivanting around then you are sorely
mistaken young lady," from my mom. Needless to say that it was a very pleasant
way to start off the morning.</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing was for certain, school
would be an interesting experience today. I had math with Xander first
period which would be a trying experience if he was still wiggin. I wasn't
expecting him to have an immediate coolness with everything, but the awkward
silences were, well, awkward.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I called this morning, your mom said you
weren't home," Xander said, leaning over to look at my paper once the teacher
had finished with the lesson for the day and gone to get coffee.</p>

<p>"I was at Buffy's," I whispered back.</p>

<p>"You slept over?" he asked. He sounded
as if I told him I had ate a can of worms. In fact if I had told him I
ate a can of worms he probably would have taken it better.</p>

<p>"Yeah," I confirmed, looking over at him.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's proper? If I was your
mom…" he started, but I interrupted before he could finish.</p>

<p>"You're not my mom. If I wanted to be lectured
and 'do you think that's proper'd' I would talk to my mom, but I don't
want to be lectured and 'do you think that proper'd' which is why I don't
talk to my mom. That and she thinks I'm a witch, which I am, but she thinks
that I'm a bad naughty witch, which I'm not. Now the real question should
be, do you think it's proper to be copying my work?" I said, eyeing him.</p>

<p>He didn't respond to my little speech,
he simply straightened his chair around and muttered under his breath as
he sharpened his full sized pencil until it was about the size of his pinky.
After watching him for a few moments, I started back on my own work. I
figured things would be what they would be and that there was really no
use thinking about it, or worrying about it for that matter because it
wouldn't change anything. Things would be what it would be.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As I was waiting in the courtyard after
school for Buffy my eyes were constantly drawn to the woman who was leaning
against a tree about 20 meters away. A part of the reason I kept looking
over at her was because every time I turned my head away I could feel her
eyes on me, but when I looked over at her she was just leaning against
the tree playing with a stupid yo-yo. The other part of the reason I keep
looking over at her was that I was inexplicably drawn to her presence.</p>

<p>"What's with the frownie face?" Buffy asked,
sitting down beside me.</p>

<p>"Do you know if there's a young supply
teacher in today?" I asked her distractedly.</p>

<p>"You didn't just say the words 'young'
and 'supply' in the same sentence, did you? All of the supplies in Sunnydale
are over sixty, dead, or giant preying mantis's," Buffy responded. "Why?"
she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"You see that woman over there?" I said,
looking back over to where she was standing.</p>

<p>"The beauty queen playing with the yo-yo?
Yeah, I see her. I have to admit I'm surprised, those things are making
a comeback and anyone over nineteen usually only catches up when the fads
are on their way out. Maybe she's a student," Buffy suggested. "Come on…"</p>

<p>"I passed her on my way out here, she's
like twenty-three, she can't be a student," I responded, standing up nonetheless
so Buffy would stop poking me in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Should I be getting jealous about your
growing obsession with this gorgeous mystery woman?" Buffy asked. She was
smiling though, so I could tell she was just joking around.</p>

<p>"Well no, since I'm not the one that thinks
she gorgeous," I responded. "She's just…it's…oh, I don't know, never mind.
I've been living on the hellmouth for to long, it's made me weary of new
people…and bright colored clothing," I said, shaking my head.</p>

<p>"Well, at least we don't have to worry
about you taking candy from strangers," Buffy commented as she dragged
me towards the library.</p>

<p>Buffy had just joined me at the table when
I noticed someone emerging from the corner of the library near the door.
Buffy and Faith had just finished a rather heated workout session that
ended in Faith storming out of the room, and Buffy grumbling about something
as she sat down. Whenever Giles had disappeared into his office for a few
moments Faith would stay something to Buffy and Buffy would get mad and
speed up her motions. I figured Faith was saying something to her about
me, but I couldn't hear what she was saying and I didn't really care. Buffy
was beautiful when she was angry and I was concentrating on that.</p>

<p>The person coming out the shadows was the
woman from the courtyard. I was about to show her to Buffy, but she started
clapping. At the sound Buffy looked up and over at the woman before trying
her gaze to me and then back again.</p>

<p>"That was very entertaining," the woman
said happily. "You're quite talented, your dark- haired friend too. I must
admit though that it's a rather interesting game to be playing in a library,"
she continued, leaning against the counter.</p>

<p>"Whatever floats your boat I guess," Buffy
responded non-committally. The woman smiled and nodded vigorously. She
was far too amused by the comment and it left me feeling like we were missing
something.</p>

<p>"It's still very dangerous to be doing,
all of these obstacles," she said finally, gesturing towards the table,
the counter she was leaning against, and the cage--which she stared at
for an inordinate amount of time. "Do you like to play dangerous games?"</p>

<p>"The best games usually involve a little
danger," Buffy answered looking at her. "What's a game of truth or dare
without the chance that you might have streak across your neighborhood
naked, or eat dog food? Answer = Boring."</p>

<p>"What about you?" she asked, directing
the question to me. She was staring at me intently and I found it unnerving.</p>

<p>"Me? I like Hungry Hungry Hippo's, and
if I'm feelin' really rebellious I've been know to play a game or two of
Gin Rummy," I told her. I could see Buffy smiling in my peripheral vision,
but my attention was focused on the woman who was still staring at me,
though she too was smiling.</p>

<p>"Interesting," was the only comment she
made. There was silence for a few moments and I found myself studying her.
Buffy was right, she was gorgeous, deep blue eyes, full lips -- the kind
people would pay good money for only to have them come out looking half
as good as hers-- and shoulder length brown hair. She stood at what I would
guess to be around five feet, eight inches, and had a trim yet muscular
build. I would more have expected to see her on the cover of Vogue than
in a school library. Actually I wished she was at a photo shoot someplace
far away, like Milan, rather than here.</p>

<p>"You mentioned truth or dare," she said,
finally breaking the silence. "That's a risk taker's game. But that's what
you relish about it isn't it? The uncertainty of the outcome, having a
challenge set forth and quelling it. That appeals to you, doesn't it?"
She continued looking at Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Why play something if you know how
it's going to end, or if it's so boring you wish it would end? Which would
you rather play, go-fish or poker? For me that's pretty much a no-brainer,"
Buffy responded. "What about you?"</p>

<p>"I lean more to your way of thinking, but
I think your friend would rather play go-fish," the woman answered, looking
at me as she spoke the last few words. It was hard to tell what she meant
by that comment, but before either of us could respond Giles came out of
his office.</p>

<p>"Can I help you?" he asked the woman as
he polished his glasses.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, turning around to face
him. They spoke momentarily before she nodded and headed out of the library.</p>

<p>"You were right, there's something off
about her, and I don't mean off as in she likes to wear men's underwear,
or she talks to taxidermied animals. There's something …hellmouthish about
her," Buffy said to me in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>"What do you think it is?" I asked having
tried to come up with something myself and drawing a blank.</p>

<p>"I have absolutely no idea.That's what
we have a Giles for," Buffy said standing up and looking at me expectantly.</p>

<p>"I'm coming," I told her, rising to my
feet before she could start poking me in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Not here I hope," she said with a smirk
before heading over to where Giles was. I, being me, just blushed and followed
after her. Speaking of playing games.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>We talked to Giles about the bad vibes
we were getting from the woman after she left and he said that he would
do some research and keep his eyes open, but with the information, or more
accurately the lack of information, we had there was nothing that we could
really do. Currently I was walking home from a tutoring lesson to meet
with Buffy to study. She was falling behind in English and needed me to
help, or so she said. Buffy was actually quite proficient in English- which
baffled Giles because of how she abused the language while speaking. I
think she just wanted an excuse to get together tonight and that was just
fine with me.</p>

<p>As I turned onto Fawndale Street, I could
feel somebody watching me. I had gotten frighteningly proficient at sensing
people following/sneaking up on/trying to kill me, over the past few years.
It was just like in the courtyard this afternoon only there weren't tons
of people around now and I felt considerably less safe than I did this
afternoon. It was around dusk though, not dark yet, so I ruled out vampires
as a possibility.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I waited until I could feel the other person
near me then flung around to face them. It was the woman from the courtyard
and the library. She smiled when she saw me turn around and started walking
beside me. After a few moments she asked me where my friend from earlier
was, which branched out into small talk, which we continued to do- her
doing most of the talking- until we crossed the street and I spoke.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I asked her trying to keep
my voice from trembling. The woman was dark, and mysterious, beautiful,
and actually charming, but there was also something very disconcerting
about being in her presence.</p>

<p>"Rio," was all she said looking across
the street at the same time.</p>

<p>"De Janeiro?" I asked, thinking that perhaps
she thought I asked where she was from. She looked like perhaps she could
have been from that region, she had an exotic quality about her, but it
was hard to pinpoint exactly what heritage inspired it.</p>

<p>"No thanks," she responded as she watched
a child across the street playing with their ball.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, completely losing track
of this conversation.</p>

<p>"Is on second," she replied, looking down
at me her lips curving up into a smile.</p>

<p>"You're playing with me," I said rather
unnecessarily a few moments later.</p>

<p>"I enjoy games," she said, still smiling,
"They're fun. The only way to stave off the tediousness of everyday live
really. I mean if all we did was eat, sleep and work, things would be very
boring wouldn't they? Games, well, games provide the entertainment that
delay insanity."</p>

<p>"You know, I hear scrabble is quite entertaining,
and the best part is that if you play on a computer you can play it alone.
Not that I want to get rid of you or anything, it's just that at some point
everyone has to be alone, or in other words solitary…hey there's an idea,
solitaire. That's fun too…" she interrupted me before I could finish however.</p>

<p>"Do you always talk so much or is this
a reflection on me? I mean, I've been watching you and your mouth is always
moving. I just figured you chewed a lot of gum or something," she said.</p>

<p>"Um…yeah," I said really wishing that I
was at home.</p>

<p>"Yeah you talk a lot or yeah you chew gum?"
she asked, looking down at me.</p>

<p>"The first one," I said, stopping at Old
Edith's house. My house was down the street but I really didn't want to
talk to this woman, Rio, anymore. She was really starting to freak me out.
Old Edith was a little strange herself, but she would let me in, and she
wouldn't kill me. She would make me eat rock candy but that was definitely
better than talking to Rio any longer. "Anyway, this is my stop, the place
where I live and must enter now," I continued looking at the house.</p>

<p>"No, it's not," she said, looking at me
intently. "You live down the road," she continued, pointing in the direction
of my house.</p>

<p>"No I don't, I live here, which is why
I said that I lived here, because I do," I said. "You hear that meowing,"
I asked as one of Edith's cats started to meow, "that's my cat…Petey's
his name, he's a tabby, he likes tuna."</p>

<p>"Now who's playing games?" she asked, stepping
into my personal space. That made me even more uncomfortable because it
was MY space, that's why it's called personal space and she was violating
it big time.</p>

<p>"Listen lady," I said, getting tough. I'd
had enough of this, "I didn't want to say this before because my mother
taught me manners, but you have got to go. Following people around, and
telling them where they live and generally acting like a psychotic isn't
going to win you any friends. Unless you meet another psychotic, which
I'm not. So why don't you go tell whoever put you up to this that it didn't
work," I continued.</p>

<p>"What if nobody put me up to it?" she asked
still standing close. "What if I am a psychotic? 'Cause if I was I wouldn't
care what you say, would I? 'Cause I'd be the type of lunatic who makes
baskets out of rat tails. What would you say then?" She asked a moment
later a smile working it's way across her face as her hand dipped into
her pocket.</p>

<p>"Please…don't cut out my tongue," was what
came out of my mouth. I was too busy wishing that Buffy was there to concentrate
on what I was saying. Buffy would kick her ass.</p>

<p>She looked at me for a minute then started
to laugh heartily throwing her head back and everything. When she was finished
she removed her hand from her pocket to reveal a pez dispenser, Taz I believe.
She then tipped the head back and took one out.</p>

<p>"I like you, you're funny," she said chewing
on the candy. "We'll have to play again sometime…for longer. Games are
better when they're long. You get more… involved," she continued. "You
take care of yourself okay Willow. We can't play if you go out and hurt
yourself," and with that she continued down the street turning to wave
before she walked off.</p>

<p>Buffy arrived at my house about an hour
after dark having had to make a quick sweep before coming over. My parents
were at the exhibit Joyce had been working on so I had been alone in the
house and was very glad when Buffy finally got there.</p>

<p>"It's the soloplays, no wait sillibays…that's
not it either, it's…it's those long boring S things that nobody understands
anyway," Buffy said as we sat around my kitchen table.</p>

<p>"Soliloquy's?" I guessed.</p>

<p>"That's the thing. I mean what does he
want to be? Or not be? Or sling? And why do I have to hear about for like
four pages?" She asked, making a helpless gesture.</p>

<p>"He's contemplating suicide. During…the
soliloquy he's….basically…just weighing the pros…and cons…of it..." I said
distractedly. Buffy was running her foot up and down my leg gently and
it was distracting me, in a very good way. Of course it didn't take much
to distract me in that way anymore.</p>

<p>"If he's gonna do it I wish he would get
on with it already," Buffy said, biting on the tip of her pencil as she
continued her leg motions. "Who talks to themselves for four pages anyway?"</p>

<p>"Hamlet?" I offered. Buffy smirked and
turned her head so that she was looking at me.</p>

<p>"You okay? You're looking a little light-headed?"
She asked, scrunching her brow up in an attempt to look concerned, but
a smile was slowly making it's way across her face.</p>

<p>"Now that you mention it something is making
me kind of …distracted," I responded.</p>

<p>"I might know of a way to help," Buffy
offered, leaning forward so that her lips were almost touching my ear.
"If you want it that is."</p>

<p>"If you think it would help then go right
ahead. Because help is good. Help is a good way to elevate distress, because
help by definition is…" I didn't get a chance to finish that thought though
and I can't say that I'm sorry. Buffy leaned over and kissed me softly.
Within moments we were kissing deeply causing Buffy to raise her hand to
my cheek to steady us. She had the most wonderfully soft lips and I was
sure that I could spent and eternity kissing them, licking them, sucking
on them. "We're suppose to be studying," I said when we broke apart. What
we were suppose to be studying I couldn't really remember, but it was something,
I was sure of that.</p>

<p>"I know," she said smiling, "but sometimes
it's good to be bad," she continued, running her tongue along my bottom
lip before capturing them again. "See…doesn't this feel good?" she asked,
sliding her tongue over my lips, softly exploring. It felt like we sat
there kissing, trading soft caresses for hours, until Buffy finally pulled
away. Once we parted she looked up at me sheepishly then moved her chair
to the side a bit. "Just a precaution," she said in response to my questioning
look.</p>

<p>"You're mean," I told her, glaring at her
as she picked up her pencil and started to write.</p>

<p>"Me? What did I do?" she asked innocently.</p>

<p>"That didn't help," I said, "I'm worse
off now than before. I don't have a hand book but I'm sure that there's
a rule in it about working up your girlfriend then just stopping…to do
homework," I said, face still flushed.</p>

<p>"But you said we were suppose to be studying.
So I'm studying," Buffy answered, holding up the book as evidence. She
was a tease, a big 'ol tease and I was loving it.</p>

<p>"Alright then, I've got an idea," I said,
dragging my chair back close to hers.</p>

<p>"A studying idea? Because those are the
only kind I'm accepting," Buffy said as I settled in.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a studying idea alright. But
I think we should study biology. We've done enough English for one night,
and biology is an important subject."</p>

<p>"What about biology?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The human body, more accurately motor
responses. The best way to study this is for you to introduce a stimulus
to my body, then assess the response and try to repeat the effect if it
was a positive one," I said. "Just to make sure it wasn't an aberration
of course," I explained. "Now since I'm the teacher I think that we should
start at the top then work our way down. Our first lesson will be…" I said
then I leaned forward and brought our lips together again. I rested my
hand on her knee and shifted even further forward in the chair so that
I was practically sitting in her lap.</p>

<p>"I'm probably going to need extra help,
a lot of extra help, tons of extra help," Buffy mumbled between kisses
that were becoming increasingly passionate as her hand made it's way to
my back stroking it softly.</p>

<p>"I think I can fit you in somewhere," I
responded breathlessly as my hand started to creep under her shirt.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I'm not sure how we actually managed to
make it all the way to my bedroom, but we did. On top of that, we actually
managed to make it to the bed without breaking anything, which was pretty
impressive considering that neither of us were looking were we were going.
Sure the phone got knocked under the bed, but it was for a good, great,
wonderful, exceptional reason. If all biology lessons went that well there
would be much higher marks in the course, I was sure of it. That and there
would be a lot of teachers in jail. As we lay post-coital bliss I found
my mind drifting back to my encounter with Rio. I had planned on telling
Buffy about it when she arrived but I didn't want to start off our evening
that way, and afterwards I got a little distracted.</p>

<p>"Send me a postcard from wherever you're
vacationing?" Buffy asked finally.</p>

<p>"Sorry," I said, shifting so that our faces
were only inches apart. "My mind drifted."</p>

<p>"Drifted? You were in another time zone,"
Buffy commented softly as she regarded me for a minute with concerned eyes.
"You know that if…we didn't have to…I mean I know last night you didn't
want …if," she stopped talking for a second and sighed. "We didn't have
to make love, it's alright if you're…"</p>

<p>"That's not it," I said, stopping her before
she could finish. "Biology 101 was my idea, remember? I wanted this, I
want you," I told her never wanting her to doubt that her love was anything
but a godsend to me. "I was just thinking about…" I started to say but
then trailed off.</p>

<p>"Thinking about what?" she asked moving
a little closer and placing her hand on my hip stroking lightly with her
thumb. "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but know that you
can tell me anything and I'll listen," she continued, watching the movements
she was making with her hand.</p>

<p>"When I was walking home from tutoring
that woman from the courtyard and the library sidled up to me on the street,"
I responded.</p>

<p>"Who? Tall, dark, and crazy?" she asked,
surprised.</p>

<p>"One and the same. Buffy…she's not…I mean
I think that maybe she's just nuts. She said that she had been watching
me, and she knows where I live. I tried to tell her that Old Edith's house
was my house, because she was really freaking me out and I didn't want
to talk to her anymore, but it didn't work. Old Edith would've made me
eat rock candy and that stuffs pretty bad, but if I had to chose between
rock candy and Lizzy Borden, it would be rock candy all the way, but she
knew that it wasn't my house and pointed to where my house was. Then she
invaded my personal touch bubble…"</p>

<p>"Did she…"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't like that, she just stood
really, really close. Almost as close as we are now, only I didn't want
her this close. So I kinda told her to go away and stop acting like a lunatic,
and she was all 'how do you know I'm not a lunatic', and I was like, 'please
don't cut my tongue out', and she found that really funny, then she started
talking about how we were going to have to play again sometime, because
games are fun, and she likes games, and…Buffy, I think she's really unbalanced."</p>

<p>"Does she know who you are?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"She knows my name. She called me Willow.
I never told her what my name was though," I answered. "I think her name's
Rio, but she may just have been playing around."</p>

<p>"Were you even going to tell me about this?"
Buffy asked. Her voice was steady but when I looked into her eyes, I could
tell she was hurt.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," I answered. "I was going
to but…but I got a little sidetracked," I continued, causing Buffy looked
down at our current state of undress.</p>

<p>"Oh," was all she said.</p>

<p>"Yeah," I agreed, and we were silent for
a moment.</p>

<p>"Tell me if she bothers you again, okay?"
Buffy asked, reaching up to stroke my cheek.</p>

<p>"I will," I agreed. "I think she needs
help,"</p>

<p>"What she needs is a good ass kicking,"
Buffy replied. "Nobody messes with you."</p>

<p>"Cause I'm your girl?" I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"That's right," Buffy confirmed. "Now…go
make me a sandwich woman!"</p>

<p>"What was that?" I asked, reaching out
for her.</p>

<p>"No…don't….Will don't, I'm sorry," she
pleaded. "It was a joke, please…noooo," she continued as I started tickling
her. If the demons of the world knew this little secret we could all be
in big trouble, but as of yet I was the only to find this Slayers Achilles
heel, and I would use it as I saw fit.</p>

<p>Finally, I stopped when Buffy had turned
beet red and was wheezing for air. Half of the reason I even tickled her
was because she looked so cute afterwards. All mad but not able to do anything
about it because she knew I would tickle her again if she did. I got a
certain amount of pleasure from making her impotent with rage that I didn't
want to analyze.</p>

<p>"And you said I was mean," Buffy said once
she had caught her breath. She was holding her sides and watching me carefully.
"Oh, no you don't," she uttered jerking away as I reached my hand out.</p>

<p>"Don't be like that, I'm not going to tickle
you," I said trying to coax her back over.</p>

<p>"That's what you said last time, but there
was more tickling. You said no more tickling but I distinctly remembering
tickling…and laughing." Buffy responded eyeing me suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that,"
I said in a suitably apologetic voice. "Let me kiss it better," I continued,
trying out my new sexy 'come hither' smile.</p>

<p>"Okay, but if there's tickling, I'm going
to have to introduce you to Mr. Pointy," Buffy responded, sliding back
over.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The next morning I met Xander at our lockers.
I hadn't seen him since lunch the day before, and was surprised to find
him waiting for me. A week ago it wouldn't have surprised me, but I didn't
think that I was on his favorite people's list at the moment. At the moment
we had 'issues'.</p>

<p>"Hey," I said as I arrived and reached
for my lock.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself," he responded. "Did you
have a nice night?" he continued. I had to consider how to answer that
question because certain elements were very nice, due entirely to the strong
Buffy factor, and other parts were not so nice, due to their loony fringe
factor. I suppose I took to long deciding how to answer because he began
to speak again. "Why don't we start with an easier question," he said.
"Did you spend the night at your own house?" I stopped what I had been
doing when he asked this question. It wasn't so much the question he asked
but how he asked it that got me. I hated it when my parents said that but
sometimes it was just true.</p>

<p>"Why are you acting like this?" I asked,
turning around to face him.</p>

<p>"Acting like what? Can't a guy inquire
as to his friend whereabouts? Some people would be touched by the display
of concern," he responded.</p>

<p>"My night was fine, and I was at home,
my own home," I responded, turning back around to get my math book out
of my locker. I didn't want to start a fight with him.</p>

<p>"What were you doing? It must have been
verrrry engrossing," Xander continued as I zipped up my back pack.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I was calling you for most of the night
and there was no answer. Whatever you were doing must have been very interesting
for you not have heard the phone ringing. Repeatedly," he answered. At
first I as confused about what he was taking about then I remembered that
when Buffy and I entered my room we knocked the phone of off the dresser
and under the bed. It was a portable so it was probably ringing under there--for
awhile--and I didn't hear it.</p>

<p>"The phone must have gotten knocked under
the bed. I didn't hear it, that's all," I responded. It was mostly true.</p>

<p>"Sure you weren't just otherwise occupied?
I know of a certain Slayer who cut patrol short last night," he continued,
not relenting. I stopped walking and turned to look at him for a moment
before ushering us into a quiet corner.</p>

<p>"I know you're having a hard time with
this, but that's no reason to act…to act like a big stupid jerk," I told
him once we were away from prying ears and eyes.</p>

<p>"Who's having a hard time with anything?
I'm not having a hard a time with anything, I'm not even having an anything
with anything, and I'm not acting like a big stupid jerk," Xander responded,
rubbing the arm I had used to drag him over.</p>

<p>"If you're not wiggy then why are suddenly
concerned with when, and where, I'm with Buffy? It never mattered before,"
I shot back.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well before the two of you weren't…"</p>

<p>"Weren't what Xander?" I asked when he
trailed off. We stood there for a few seconds staring at each other before
he responded.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he muttered then pushed his
way past me and continued down the hall. I watched him go until he was
out of sight then leaned against the wall and sighed. I loved Xander, but
he could be a real jerk sometimes, usually when he was hurting and didn't
want anyone to know. It was a defense mechanism he had developed over the
years. I knew that he was hurting now, but the problem was he was a really
proficient jerk and I just didn't have to energy to deal with that currently.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>I ended up in the library during lunch
time doing some cataloguing for Giles. Buffy was in having a 'talk' with
her history teacher, and things with Xander were just as tense during lunch
so when the opportunity arose we both took off. Giles had noticed things
had been a little tense over the past few days and had tried to get to
the bottom of it, but I shrugged it off, and luckily he had to go on lunch
duty before he could prod anymore.</p>

<p>I was so engrossed in what I was doing
I didn't even realize Buffy had entered the office until she placed her
hands on my shoulders and started to massage them.</p>

<p>"What's with the sad?" she asked, continuing
her motions.</p>

<p>"Who's sad?" I asked, knowing that I wasn't
fooling her for a second.</p>

<p>"You are. Why?"</p>

<p>"Xander," was all I said in response.</p>

<p>"What'd he say?" she asked, hopping on
the desk beside me.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I responded. There was no sense
in both of us being mad at him.</p>

<p>"He had to have said something or else
you wouldn't have typed the same sentence over and over again for a paragraph,"
Buffy said looking at the screen. "Whatever happened, it was about us,
right?" she asked when I didn't respond to her previous comment.</p>

<p>"Basically," was all I said. She sighed
and hoped down off the desk moving behind me then wrapped her arms around
me.</p>

<p>"He's in stage two now, otherwise know
as the 'it hurts and I'm going to act like a big stupid jerk' stage. I
think you can see why they changed the name," she said. "It'll work out,
we just have to be patient, give him time," she continued, kissing me on
the cheek.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," I said, leaning back
into her slightly.</p>

<p>We stayed wrapped together like that for
a moment before I started to get a bit to comfortable and decided to break
up the snuggles.</p>

<p>"How'd it go with your teacher?" I asked.
Seeing as how she was here instead of with Synder I figured things couldn't
have gone too badly.</p>

<p>"It seems the director took some liberties
with the film. Apparently, in WWI there was no underground city that housed
the world's top scientists so they could conspire against the enemy," she
responded</p>

<p>"Who was the enemy?" I asked. I, just like
everyone else, had no idea who the 'bad guys' were in the first world war.</p>

<p>"I don't know, the French maybe," Buffy
responded, unconcerned. "So, when you take the fact that the underground
city was just a big lie into consideration, it becomes painfully obvious
that I did no research whatsoever and that I based my essay on a sub-par
movie. This revelation usually leads to chats with your teacher, and a
zero on your essay, all of which were fulfilled," Buffy added, shrugging.</p>

<p>"I told you not to watch that movie," I
said. The director was a no talent who liked to use rapidly changing camera
angles to cover up the fact that he had no talent. I had gotten motion
sickness watching some of his earlier work.</p>

<p>"I know…and you were right about that camera
angle thing," Buffy said. "But you should also consider this. What kind
of a world are we living in where a young woman can't turn to television
and film as a way skip out of doing actual work? I remember a day when
you use to be able to rent a movie and know that it was like the book,
only shorter, which is of course why you rented it in the first place.
But nowadays, well, you just can't trust Hollywood to present a story accurately.
It's all about money these days, with their car chases, and underground
cities. When you think about it, it's really a sad day. I mean, didn't
anybody think of the children? Next time I'll just have be a sell out and
get one of those internet essays like everyone else, but inside I'll be
mourning the loss of better time, a time when you could believe in movies.
A time when you could use them to hoodwink. I'll be mourning the passing
of an era when you could turn on the T.V and say 'hey, I used that movie
to cheat on an English paper'," Buffy said concluding her little speech
with a shake of her head that was intended to show how truly disgusted
she was with the state of affairs of the world today. Once she finished
I simply turned around and stared at her. For a long time. "What?" she
asked finally, "Is it so wrong to be nostalgic?"

<p>Mrs. Summers wanted our help later on dismantling
the exhibit whose last showing had been the night before--the one my parents
attended. It had actually been a lot of fun disassembling it, I had gotten
to smash things, and was able to show Buffy how I could make things float.
We were there until around nine before deciding sneak out and get some
ice-cream. Smashing things was fun, but ice-cream combined with Buffy was
better.</p>

<p>"Someone's following us," Buffy whispered
as we passed by the playground on our way back from the ice-cream shop.</p>

<p>"I bet I know who it is," I whispered back.</p>

<p>"Our South American stalker," Buffy responded,
placing her hand on the small of my back to change the direction I had
been going in. "Three… two…one…" Buffy whispered, then she dived into the
bushes and emerged a moment later with Rio in her hand. I saw her face
as Buffy flung her onto the ground and she was smiling. She was about to
get her booty kicked and she actually looked amused. Disturbing, very disturbing.
She slowly picked herself up off the ground, then once she was upright
raised her leg and kicked out a Buffy who jumped back out of the way.</p>

<p>Buffy rushed her after that and the two
of them started trading blows. They were moving so fast it was hard for
me to keep track of their motions. I watched as they fought and realized
that Rio was holding her own against Buffy. As far as I could tell, they
were pretty evenly matched, and for that to be true she couldn't have been
human. Which we suspected all along, so it wasn't really a surprise. Finally,
Buffy managed to get some leverage and kicked Rio in the stomach sending
her flying over near where I was standing.</p>

<p>Rio stood up slowly, her head was down,
her shoulders slightly hunched over, and her legs crossed at the ankles.
They movement was very fluid and graceful, almost bird like. Once she was
standing she flung her hair back revealing her true face to us. Now that,
that was surprising. She was a vampire. Her eyes were glowing yellow, her
features were distorted. Her fangs were visible through her smile.</p>

<p>Buffy and I traded looks not believing
what we were seeing. We had both seen her in the daylight, in the middle
of the afternoon no less. It wasn't possible. She couldn't be a vampire.
We continued to stand there watching her in a semi-stupefied state as she
growled softly before raking a hand through her hair.</p>

<p>"Not bad, not bad at all," she said focusing
her gaze on Buffy. "This is going to be fun," she said her face returning
to its human state. "but I've got to be going now. Don't you two be strangers,
you hear," she added before winking at us and walking away.</p>

<p>"What the…?" I asked, turning to Buffy
once she was out of ear shot. There was no doubt that she was a vampire,
the transformation back had just happened right in front of us, but it
just didn't compute. Vampires couldn't walk around in the day, that's just
the way things were.</p>

<p>"I'm right there with ya, Will," Buffy
said looking after her. Turning to face me she took my hand. "We've got
to find Giles, this is way weird."</p>

<p>Since we were close to the school we checked
there first, but no Giles was to be found so we headed over to his house.
Luckily Giles lived close to school, so the whole trip only took us about
forty-five minutes. We had speculated together about what might be happening,
but nothing either of us came up with made any sense and we were right
back were we started.</p>

<p>"Buffy, Willow…" Giles started as he opened
the door.</p>

<p>"We've got problems of the fanged kind,"
Buffy said, leading the way into Giles house. I smiled and shrugged at
the watcher then followed her in.</p>

<p>"What exactly is the problem?" Giles asked,
leading us into the living room.</p>

<p>"That woman who was in the library two
days ago…" Buffy started.</p>

<p>"I've researched as much as I could with
the information proved which was close to null. I think that she is perhaps
just eccentric," Giles said, interrupting Buffy. "I thought you said this
had to do with vampires?"</p>

<p>"I was getting to that Mr. Interrupto,"
Buffy said giving Giles a look. "The woman's not eccentric, she's nuts.
Worse still, she's a nuts vampire."</p>

<p>"That's impossible," Giles responded. "I
spoke to her in the middle of the afternoon. You said you saw in the courtyard.
Vampires do not walk around in the light."</p>

<p>"She was a vampire Giles. We're positive,"
I said. "We saw her change."</p>

<p>"Not to mention that if she were human
she would have suffered numerous broken bones. I was going at her with
everything Giles, even Faith flinched when I hit her, with this one, nothing
but a smile," Buffy added. "Which in itself is a little scary."</p>

<p>"You're certain?" Giles asked. We simply
nodded. "Did you notice anything about her that could help our search in
the text? Any defining characteristics, or things out or the ordinary?"</p>

<p>"Besides the whole walking in the day thing?"
Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course besides the whole walking
in the day thing," Giles confirmed.</p>

<p>"She was burned," I said, remembering something
I noticed that day in the library.</p>

<p>"Burned? How?" Giles asked. His curiosity
was piqued. I could tell. If he was a dog, his tail would have been wagging.</p>

<p>"It was like a marking, on her forearm.
Almost like a tattoo, only it was burned onto her arm," I responded.</p>

<p>"What was the marking of?" Giles asked
putting on his glasses.</p>

<p>"It was…it was some sort of game piece,
like from those really old chess boards or something," I related, trying
to remember exactly what it looked like.</p>

<p>"That sounds familiar," he said with that
far away look in his eyes he got when he was mentally searching through
thousands of texts.</p>

<p>"See, I told you," Buffy said, "this is
why we have a Giles. The man is a walking encyclopedia of demonic facts
and figures," Buffy continued.</p>

<p>"I'll start looking into it now," Giles
said as he glanced at his watch. "You two might as well head home, there's
nothing more you can do tonight. If the texts don't turn up anything tonight
we'll search tomorrow after school."</p>

<p>"Alright," Buffy said getting up, "we'll
see you tomorrow." With that I got up and joined her.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I'll walk you home, I don't want a repeat
of yesterday," Buffy said as we headed down Giles' driveway. I nodded,
I didn't want a repeat of yesterday either, especially in light of recent
revelations. It was bad enough when I thought she was just crazy, now she
was a crazy vampire. "I won't let anything happen to you," Buffy said,
taking my hand in hers and squeezing.</p>

<p>"I know," I said. "I know."
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When we showed up at the library the next
day, Giles confirmed what we had already guessed, his research last night
was a bust and it was time for us to break out our research- wear because
it was going to be a long night. We had run into Xander on our way to the
library and gotten him caught up on the situation. We would need all the
hands and eyes we could get. He had a thing to do with his dad right after
school, but when he was done he would come back and help. We figured he
was still in for about four or more hours of page flipping fun.</p>

<p>"What brings you to my nightmare?" Buffy
asked as I joined her on the upper level.</p>

<p>"The Gurzanar text, it's full of fun facts,"
I told her. As she reached over to place the book she had been holding
onto the shelf I too started to reach over to check one of the texts and
we ended up getting all tangled up. I ended up tilting on an angle, and
as Buffy tried to straighten me up we ended up tripping over each others
feet and tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>"Are you hitting on me?" Buffy asked, looking
down at me. "Because, if you wanted to get closer all you had to do was
ask," Buffy continued smirking.</p>

<p>"Sometimes actions speak louder than words,"
I responded, trying out that 'come hither' smile again. You know what they
say, if something's worth doing once it's worth doing twice.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Buffy commented as she continued
to stare down at me. Then coming to a decision she leaned down and kissed
me gently. Smiling, I leaned forward returning the kiss until we had to
break apart to take in oxygen.</p>

<p>"We should probably get up," Buffy said
once her breathing had returned to normal, even though she still made no
effort to get off of me. I nodded in agreement and moved my hands to her
sides trying to get her to actually move. She smiled again then started
to get up, but as she was rolling off of me her movements stopped and she
stiffened. "What is up with this?" She muttered continuing her rolling
motion until she was off of me. Wondering what she was talking about, I
turned my head to the side and saw Giles standing on the steps.</p>

<p>"Research doesn't look like that when I
do it," Giles commented, looking between Buffy and I. Not knowing how long
he had been standing there Buffy and I remained silent. Silence was always
a good choice, it couldn't get you in trouble, nor could it get you out
of it. "Well, come on then, I suppose the research can wait for a while,"
Giles continued when we failed to comment. Buffy and I got up and followed
him down the stairs. As we walked I came to the conclusion that we were
definitely going to have to work on discretion. The way people were finding
out definitely had to reflect on us in some way, it just had to. We were
'livin' la vida loca' and everyone was livin' it with us.</p>

<p>"Giles," Buffy started once we were all
seated at the table, "we were just…"</p>

<p>"Making out in my book stacks. Yes, I caught
that," the watcher replied.</p>

<p>"That wasn't exactly what I was going for,
but…" Buffy trailed off. Obviously he had been standing there for a while.
We sat there quietly for a while before Buffy broke the silence. "Well?"
she asked him expectantly.</p>

<p>"Well what?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to yell, or go all wiggy,
or wipe your glasses, or call our mothers, or…something?" I asked. I had
always figured Giles would take the news rather calmly--like he took everything
else--but I had expected some sort of reaction. And for some odd reason
in my mind tea was involved somewhere.</p>

<p>"Would you like me to do any of those things?"
Giles asked looking between us.</p>

<p>"Uh… no," Buffy answered. "But don't you
have anything to say…about…you know…like, stuff that you want to say about
things?" she asked, sounding like me for a moment.</p>

<p>"I must say that I'm not completely surprised
by what I saw. I'll admit I never expected to 'walk in on you' but I'm
not shocked. I am quite an observant chap, and if I hadn't noticed that
there was something going on between the two of you-- especially lately--that
would have been shocking. They don't hand watchers certificates out to
just anyone you know," Giles answered as he shifted his gaze between us.</p>

<p>"Right, you find them in your box of Frosted
Flakes along with a decoder ring," Buffy interjected during the momentary
silence.</p>

<p>"Are you happy?" Giles asked after a moment,
wisely choosing to ignore Buffy's last statement.</p>

<p>"Yes," we answered simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Then I don't believe we have anything
left to discuss," Giles said standing up. "I was coming up to give you
this," he said, placing the Guzanar text down in front of me before heading
into his office.</p>

<p>"Well…" Buffy said once he was gone. "That
was…interesting. Which is to say that it was…interesting."</p>

<p>"Interesting is a good word or it. Or maybe
scary. Interesting, and scary," I responded.</p>

<p>"Do you think that was his way of giving
us his blessing?" Buffy asked. I could tell from the way that she said
it that she wanted it to be. Buffy and Giles had a very special bond, I
would go so far as to say that he was even a father figure to her, and
I knew that his approval meant a lot to her. If Giles had had a problem
with us I knew that it would have been very difficult for her. For me too
since I was pretty fond of the man myself.</p>

<p>"It sounded like a blessing to me, or as
close as we're going to get from a Brit," I told her with a smile.</p>

<p>"The happies are back and in full swing,"
Buffy said, smiling.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Xander showed up about an hour after our
talk with Giles. He said he had swung by Faith's place, but she wasn't
there. She was probably on one of her excursions so we would have to count
her out on this one. Like I predicted, we still had another four or so
hours of research ahead of us--pizza break included--since none of us had
found anything relevant.</p>

<p>As we researched the night away, I noticed
Xander observing Buffy and I every once and a while, but didn't say anything.
He looked more introspective than anything and I figured that it was a
good thing. Perhaps he was moving onto stage three, acceptance of the inevitable.
That's what I hoped the situation was anyway. Xander and I had been friends
forever, almost every memory of childhood, and teenhood, involved him,
and I wanted all my memories of adulthood to as well. I didn't want Buffy
and I being together to become a real problem for him because, if I had
to chose, I knew he wouldn't win and I didn't want it to come to that.
I loved both of them, but Buffy was my other half and I needed her.</p>

<p>A few hours and a few pizza's later the
doors to the library opened. It was Angel. After taking a quick look around
he made a bee-line for the table. He glanced at Buffy quickly before turning
to face the rest of us.</p>

<p>"She's, ah…she's here," he said in that
soft whispery voice he usually had when he had just run really far, or
was nervous about something.</p>

<p>"Who's here?" Buffy asked shifting in her
chair slightly.</p>

<p>"Rio," Angel replied, rubbing his hands
nervously.</p>

<p>"You know her?" I asked, surprised. Though
I shouldn't really have been surprised Angelus was quite popular in his
day, he knew everyone there was to know in the demon world it seemed.</p>

<p>"Everybody--every vampire everybody that
is--knows Rio. She's a legend…she's the day walker," Angel replied.</p>

<p>"See I told you she didn't have a twin,"
Buffy said, slapping Giles on the arm. He had been constantly asking us
if we were sure it was her.</p>

<p>"She's contacted you?" Angel asked before
Giles could respond.</p>

<p>"She's been 'single white femaling' them
for a couple days," Xander answered.</p>

<p>"This is not good," Angel said, looking
past us. "If she's made contact that means she's getting ready to play,"
he continued.</p>

<p>"What exactly does that mean? Play? 'Cause
I'm hoping it means like monopoly, or scategories, but she doesn't really
strike me as the scategories type of gal. More like the type that sneaks
up on elderly people and yells boo…which is why I'm really not lovin' the
whole play terminology 'cause I'm thinking it might be terminal, and I'm
kind of partial to life," I said, babbling a little. We were all used to
it and he was able to determine what I meant just fine.</p>

<p>"Everything's a game to her. That's what
she does, she plays. Only her pieces are people and her board the world,"
Angel responded.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, we're the pawns this time?"
Buffy asked, already knowing the answer.</p>

<p>"That's what it looks like," Angel said,
nodding.</p>

<p>"You said that she's known among vampires
as the day walker," Giles said, speaking for the first time since Angel
entered the library. "Do you know how that's possible? I'd imagine more
than one vampire has tried to learn how she's capable of walking in the
light throughout the centuries."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure exactly. I don't even think
that she knows for a fact. There are a lot of speculations, one of which
I think is more likely than the others. It's based on the one thing that
separates her from all the other vampires I've ever heard of," Angel said
in response.</p>

<p>"Which is?" Buffy prompted. She didn't
like cryptic speech.</p>

<p>"She's a Slayer," Angel said pausing slightly
for dramatic effect. "Or at least she used to be, hundreds of years ago.
She was turned in the 16th century, the exact date I don't know," he continued.
"The thing that makes her unique is that vampires never turn Slayers. Hunting
them has always been a sport. If a Slayer is caught they're killed and
displayed as a trophy, never turned," he looked down at the floor as he
said this no doubt feeling guilty over the fact that he had participated
in such hunts in his other life. "Rio is the first Slayer that I've heard
of who was ever turned, and she's also the first day walker in recorded
history. I think it's safe to assume the two are related."</p>

<p>"So she was a Slayer," Buffy said when
he finished speaking. "Was she any good?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't around when she was a Slayer,
but if you want to believe the talk she was supposedly pretty impressive.
She was twenty-four when she was turned and had been called in her mid-teens,
so she must have had a pretty good run," Angel responded.</p>

<p>"'Rio' must be the Slayer, Dario," Giles
responded. "She disappeared around the time Angel say this 'Rio' appeared,
and it explains the marking you saw on her arm. If she is indeed Dario,
then the texts give the impression of a very capable Slayer, and young
woman."</p>

<p>"This still doesn't explain her being able
to go for afternoon picnics," Buffy said in response to both their answers.</p>

<p>"The physiology of a Slayer is different
from that of other humans. Taking that into consideration, the assumption
that a Slayer would react differently to process of being turned isn't
unreasonable," Giles responded.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's some strange form of compensation,"
I added.</p>

<p>"Explain?" Buffy asked turning to face
me.</p>

<p>"You know, a way to say 'sorry you got
turned into the undead on the job, but a least you'll be able to watch
the sunrise' type of deal, or something like that. A way to take the suckage
out of a lifetime of servitude to the cause," I explained.</p>

<p>"In other words, The Big Kahuna works in
mysterious ways and this may be one of them," Xander summed up for the
benefit of anyone who had dozed off.</p>

<p>"Giles?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"I doubt the good Lord had anything to
do with it, but the physiological differences a Slayer has may indeed form
some sort of resistance to the particular agent that makes it deadly for
vampires to walk in the light," Giles responded. "Of course all of this
is speculation."</p>

<p>"Of course," Buffy responded. "What do
you think she's going to do?" Buffy asked, turning to Angel this time.</p>

<p>"I have no idea, that's what makes her
so dangerous, what has earned her a reputation among the undead. She's
brilliant, she's unpredictable, and she can be ruthless. She never plays
the same game twice, some are similar, but they're never the same," Angel
responded.</p>

<p>"Does she want to kill us?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"She wants to play with you," Angel responded.
"She's done this before with no one dying, but she's also played games
with very high mortality rates. It depends on the luck of the draw."</p>

<p>We were all silent for a moment before
Giles broke it up.</p>

<p>"Now that we know who and what we're looking
for it should be simple to find reference to her, especially if she is
as legendary as Angel says she is. Our best option is now to find out as
much about her history as we can, and try to find a pattern to her behavior
so that we can formulate a course of action," the watcher said.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a beginning," Buffy said,
reaching for the book she had placed on the table when Angel arrived. "Grab
a book big boy, this isn't a spectator sport," she said to Angel, who was
watching us shift into research mode. He nodded and took a seat next to
Xander.</p>

<p>Angel didn't know about Buffy and I yet,
and I found myself getting nervous in his presence. I didn't doubt Buffy's
feelings for me, but I still had this not-so-nice feeling in my stomach
about the whole thing. There was one thing I was certain of however, it
would be an interesting evening. If it was one thing it would be that.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Over the next half hour or so we did manage
to find a few references about Rio in the texts but it was nothing that
could really help or that we didn't know already. I had just finished with
the book I was reading and placed it back on the table before turning my
head to the side to observe the scene playing out there.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel were standing off to the
side near one of the stacks speaking quietly. Buffy was speaking, moving
her hands about and Angel merely stood there watching her as far as I could
tell. At one point when I was watching them, I saw him turn his head to
look at me and our gazes met. At that moment I knew that he knew. I probably
couldn't have said anything at that moment if I had had to. When he looked
at me it was with mournful eyes, and I felt badly for him. I liked Angel,
I really did, and I wouldn't have wished him any harm, but things were
the way they were and there was nothing that I could do about that, nothing
that I would really want to do about that, but it was sad nonetheless.</p>

<p>They spoke for a few more seconds before
separating. Buffy headed back over the table where I was seated, and Angel
headed for Giles' office. I switched my gaze back and forth between the
two of them watching their progress until Buffy settled in beside me.</p>

<p>"That was an unfun wasn't it?" I asked,
even though I already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"Definitely an unfun," she agreed, looking
towards the office for a moment before returning her gaze to me. "He knows…about
us I mean," she continued.</p>

<p>"I figured," I responded.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she said more for the sake of saying
something than for any real exchange of information.</p>

<p>"How'd it go?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You want details this time?" she asked,
smiling slightly.</p>

<p>"I want all the 'tails," I responded.</p>

<p>"It went well I suppose. I think I kinda
caught him by surprise when I called him over, I think he figured I just
wanted him to get one of high books down," she started. "I don't think
that this is going to go on his list of Kodak moments but he seemed to
take it alright, keep a sense of humor about it."</p>

<p>"Really?" I asked. First of all I was surprised
he had a sense of humor, and second of all I was surprised it chose a moment
like that to pop up.</p>

<p>"Yeah, he said it could have been worse…it
could have been Xander," Buffy related with a somewhat perverse grin. "Seriously
though, I think knowing it was you made it somewhat easier to deal with.
You're one of his favorite peeps," Buffy continued seriously.</p>

<p>"Was one of his favorites," I said pretty
sure that I was off the list now.</p>

<p>"He'll be okay," Buffy responded, "and
he doesn't hate you. You're probably not going to get a birthday card or
anything, but you didn't before this either so it shouldn't be to hard
to deal with." She continued smiling. I couldn't stop the grin from forming
on my face and looked down at my lap as it made it's way across my face.</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy said, putting her hand under
my chin and tilting it up so that I was looking at her. "I love you."</p>

<p>"I love you too," I responded, then she
leaned forward and kissed me lightly before pulling back.</p>

<p>"It works out well that way," she responded
when we broke apart. I smiled and nodded, it did work out well. She reached
out giving my hand one last squeeze before getting up. "I really should
have gotten him to get the high book first," she muttered softly to herself
as she wondered off. I watched her walk off, she was looking at the bookshelf
like it was a creature from the pits and hell. As I watched her I felt
a big goofy grin spread across my face and I didn't care a bit. We always
said love made you do the wacky.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"You have got some real crazies livin'
here," Faith said as she breezed into the library, her index finger moving
in circles around her ear. "Cuckoo, Cuckoo," she continued as she made
her way to the table. "What's goin' on and why wasn't I invited?"</p>

<p>"Maybe if you were home every once in while
you wouldn't miss all the fun," Buffy responded from her seat. We weren't
expecting her to show, but the fact that she had didn't surprise us. Faith
basically did her own thing which meant that we usually had no idea what
she was doing.</p>

<p>"I was on a mission, B, besides reading
ain't exactly my idea of high times," Faith responded.</p>

<p>"What type of mission? Were you suddenly
overtaken with the need to find a new pair of vinyl pants?" Buffy asked
looking at the other Slayers legs.</p>

<p>"Meowww, someone's in a mood," Faith responded
making a clawing motion with her hand. "Willow, you going to take of this?"
she asked with a smirk, turning to face me. We all knew how she assumed
I would take the edge off. As for my response, I just kind of looked at
her blankly, for I knew not how to respond to that. "Cuckoo, cuckoo," she
repeated, tapping the top of the table.</p>

<p>"Faith?" Giles said, coming out of office
surprised to see the other Slayer.</p>

<p>"That's what most people call me," Faith
said, swinging around slightly. "But you can call me later if you want,"
she continued with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, well…" Giles responded, rubbing his
glasses vigorously. "Have you been appraised of the situation?"</p>

<p>"There's a sitch, nobody told me there
was a sitch," Faith said, turning around to eye us.</p>

<p>"While you were on your 'mission'," Buffy
said, saying the word 'mission' in a tone that left no doubt she still
thought Faith had just gone to buy pants, "we've been trying to find the
secret weakness of a day walking vampire who's been stalking us."</p>

<p>"Fuck, I leave town for two days and everything
goes to hell," Faith responded. "This 'day walking' thing though, that
was just to see if I was paying attention, right?"</p>

<p>"'Fraid not," Xander replied.</p>

<p>We spent the next few minutes getting Faith
caught up on the situation. When she was pretty much up to date, I remembered
something she had said before and asked her about it.</p>

<p>"What did you mean about the crazies in
town…I mean I know this is a hellmouth and all and crazies pretty much
have a hall pass, but were these special crazies, like the kind that play
word games, and tell you their name is a city, and talk about basket's
made out of rat tails, or your usual run of the mill crazy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I left my decoder ring at home.
Little help here?" Faith asked once I had stopped.</p>

<p>"Did whatever you were talking about have
to do with, Rio?" Buffy explained, while giving her a look.</p>

<p>"I dunno," Faith said, tossing an envelope
on the table. "You tell me."</p>

<p>Buffy picked the envelope up off the table
and opened it up. Shaking the envelope we all watched as a playing card
floated out. Once the card was resting safely on the table Buffy looked
up at Faith and raised her eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Look at the bottom," was all Faith said
in response. Buffy picked up the card, it was a queen of hearts.</p>

<p>"It says 'complete the picture'," Buffy
said, putting the card back down.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Got me," Buffy responded shrugging. Angel
had left about half an hour before so we couldn't ask him if he had any
theories about what the card meant.</p>

<p>"So," Xander said, "is it our crazy, or
another crazy?"</p>

<p>"Only one way to find out," Buffy said,
standing up.</p>

<p>"Does it involve ski masks, jumper cables,
and martini's, cause if so I've got us covered…expect for the martini part,"
Xander said, getting excited. Espionage always excited him.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy responded. "Even better," she
then paused until we were all leaning forward in our seats in anticipation.
"We…check our mail."</p>

<p>"Hook line and sinker," Faith snickered.
Buffy smirked and stood up.</p>

<p>"Coming?" she asked. Xander, Faith and
I got up and joined her. "Giles?"</p>

<p>"You go ahead, I'm going to continue doing
some research," the watcher responded. "Alert me if you come across anything,"
he added. Buffy told him it was an affirmative and we headed out.
</p>

<p>My house was closest to the school, so
we headed there first. When we arrived my mom was doing some of her yoga/meditative/guru
stuff, and my dad was up in the study, so we were free to roam without
question. I quickly located the pile of unopened mail and started searching
through it for an envelope without a return address. The one Faith had
gotten had no return address, and it seemed in character for Rio to hand
deliver them.</p>

<p>I found it near the bottom of the pack
and opened it up. There was a card inside just like there had been in Faith's.
It was a queen of spades and had the same words written on the bottom of
it: complete the picture.</p>

<p>"Well I guess that answers the question,"
Buffy said as I placed the card in my pocket and we headed for the door.
"It's definitely our crazy."</p>

<p>We headed to Buffy's house last. The trip
to Xander's house had produced the queen of diamonds with the same three
words written on the bottom as with the other two cards. When we got to
Buffy's we found another card, this time it was the eight of spades. We
laid all the cards out on Buffy's coffee table then she headed into the
kitchen to see if her mom had left a note. Xander and Faith remained seated
in the family room while I headed into the kitchen to find Buffy a few
minutes later.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" I asked, placing my hand
on her shoulder. She was staring at the stairs with a frown on her face.</p>

<p>"She's not home," was all she said.</p>

<p>"Your mom?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she should be here," Buffy said,
turning to face me. "It doesn't even look like she's been home today."</p>

<p>"She's probably just working late at the
gallery," I said.</p>

<p>"Probably," Buffy allowed, shaking her
head a bit. "What are you doing out here anyway, I said I'd be right back,"
she continued.</p>

<p>"But you weren't…right back, so I came
to look for you," I responded.</p>

<p>"You're always looking out for me, aren't
you?" she asked, turning around so that she could look into my eyes.</p>

<p>"Just like you're always looking out for
me," I responded. "It works out well that way," I said, mirroring her earlier
statement.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," she said thoughtfully before cracking
a tiny smile. We were so close our faces were practically touching anyway,
so I leaned forward and kissed her.</p>

<p>"I really hate to interrupt the snuggles,
but Giles is on the phone." We separated and turned around to see Xander
standing in the doorway. Buffy simply nodded and headed into the family
room to take the call while I remained behind with Xander.</p>

<p>"I was right you know," he said once she
was gone.</p>

<p>"About what?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"In the car on the weekend, when we were
heading into the wild green yonder," he responded. "You two are cute… a
twosome of cuteness even," he continued before heading out of the room
as well. I stood there for a moment after he left another one of those
stupid grins plastered across my face, most of it caused by relief. Things
would still take a little getting used to, but he had accepted Buffy and
I for what we were, and who we were to each other, and I couldn't find
anything not to smile about in that.</p>

<p>When I got into the family room, Buffy
was just hanging up the phone.</p>

<p>"What's the up?" I asked, taking a seat
next to Buffy on the couch.</p>

<p>"Giles got a card too. He found it in his
mailbox at the school," Buffy responded. "He said he checked that mailbox
after lunch. That means that she came in there right under our noses and
put it there."</p>

<p>"She could have been caught," I thought
out loud.</p>

<p>"I think that was the point," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"So what now? We wait for her to play us
for suckers again?" Faith asked, fingering a stake.</p>

<p>"No, we try and figure out what the hell
these cards are suppose to mean," Buffy answered.</p>

<p>"What was the card Giles got of?" I asked,
having missed that.</p>

<p>"The eight of hearts," Buffy said. "We've
got ourselves a Full House."</p>

<p>"You think it has a twin that likes to
sing songs about peanut butter?" Xander asked. He was making reference
to those wretched Olsen twins, and we all wished he hadn't. We all really,
really wished he hadn't.</p>

<p>"You should have locked that one up and
thrown away the key," Buffy said shaking her head ruefully.</p>

<p>"Hey, being a comical genius is not easy.
Ask the Jim Carrey's, and Mike Meyer's of the world and they'll tell this:
they can't all be winners. Frankly I thought that it was a rather valiant
attempt considering the material I had to work with," Xander responded
pretending to be vexed.</p>

<p>"So…about the cards…" Buffy said, causing
Xander to pout a little, which caused Faith and I to trade looks. The looks
bordered on camaraderie and made me dizzy for a second.</p>

<p>We discussed what the meaning of the cards
could be for a while. Most of Xander's suggestions involving the word 'strip'
somewhere before I finally remembered something and picked up one of the
cards.</p>

<p>"Complete the picture," I said, reading
off of the card. "Complete the picture," I repeated.</p>

<p>"Will?" Buffy asked. She could tell that
I was on to something. I had a habit of repeating things when I was onto
something.</p>

<p>"Do you think it could mean 'Picture Perfect'?"
I asked, turning to Buffy.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That's right it closed down before you
moved here. Picture Perfect was a Casino located just outside of downtown.
It went out of business about a year before you came to Sunnydale," I responded.</p>

<p>"Why'd it close down?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of Sunnydale spend enough
time gambling with their lives, apparently they didn't want to gamble with
their money. To sum up: it be bad business for them there gambling folks
to set up in this one Starbucks town, 'cause when the tables weren't a
rockin', the creditors came a knockin'," Xander answered saying the last
part in a Texan cadence.</p>

<p>"Check out the back side of the cards,"
Faith said a moment later. We all turned the cards around to look at the
colorful backs. After a second I realized what Faith was getting at.</p>

<p>"'The perfect place to win'," I said reading
the words etched into the back of the card.</p>

<p>"Ding, ding, ding…I think we've found a
winner," Buffy said.
</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles arrived about ten minutes after we
had figured out the meaning of the clues. When he got there we told him
what we thought and he agreed that it made the most sense. Once we had
figured out where she was the only thing left to ponder was, why? Why did
she send us the cards?</p>

<p>"I'll be back in a sec," Buffy said when
there was a pause in the discussion, then she headed into the kitchen.
Mrs. Summers still hadn't come home and I figured that Buffy was going
to check up on her. She had been glancing at the clock all night and I
knew that she was worried. Idly I wondered if this was how my parents felt
when I was out half the night. I doubted it though, to be worried you had
to notice someone wasn't there.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked when Buffy entered
the room a few minutes later. She had looked worried going into the kitchen
and she looked even more so now.</p>

<p>"I called the gallery, they said that she
left over three hours ago," Buffy said, and we all knew what she was thinking.</p>

<p>"Rio?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Joanna, said that just before mom left
there was a woman in talking to her about some artifact or something. Jo,
described her as 'beautiful, mysterious, and a trifle odd'," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"Rio," I agreed.</p>

<p>"I say we pack up our stakes, bottles of
holy water and whatnot, and go blazing into the casino much in the style
of John Wayne," Xander said from his spot on the couch.</p>

<p>"For once, I vote two thumbs up for John,"
Buffy said.</p>

<p>"I think that perhaps we should put a little
more thought into our course of action," Giles piped up.</p>

<p>"No, no more thought," Buffy said. "This
is my mother we're talking about. Whether we spend five hours or five minutes
trying to figure out which entrance to use, it's not going to change a
thing. If she wants to play, then we'll play. Let's not wait, let's not
discuss it in a committee, let's do," Buffy continued standing up. "In
or out?"</p>

<p>"In."</p>

<p>"In."</p>

<p>"In."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Then let's get moving," Buffy said.</p>
