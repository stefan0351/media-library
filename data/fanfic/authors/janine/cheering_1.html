<!-- Cheering For Navratilova \ Part 1 -->

<p>Jess lifted her head up idly from where it had been resting at the
		foot of her bed when she heard the door to their room loudly open,
		watching as a nearly doubled over Jules rushed in laughing, her
		entire face lit up before she lifted her hand to her mouth to muffle
		the sound, in the process blocking half of her features.  Closing
		the door softly, Jules then turned to look at Jess imploring, a
		conspirital look on her face, before she lifted her index finger to
		her lips then nodded towards the closet a meter to her left before
		sneaking over to it and walking in closing the door behind her.  </p>

		<p>Jess stared at the closed closet door for a moment, a quizzical
		expression on her face before she heard some rather enthusiastic
		pounding on the door to their room.</p>

		<p>"Eh, no need for that, come on in," Jess called out struggling into
		a sitting position as the door whipped open and Alex Ross came
		flying into the room.</p>

		<p>"Where is she?" Alex asked looking at Jess, his face urgent and
		serious.</p>

		<p>"You mean Jules?" Jess asked, trying not to smile as she imagined
		the blonde curled in the closet, body shaking with silent laughter.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, yeah," Alex responded impatiently.  "You know where she is?"</p>

		<p>"Hasn't been by in an hour or so," Jess responded shrugging her
		shoulder and trying to plaster an apologetic look over her
		face.  "What'd she do?"</p>

		<p>"She," Alex started in a loud, agitated tone.  "She," he repeated in
		a quieter voice.  "Nevermind, it's not important," he then mumbled
		before staring at Jess for a moment, and then promptly turned and
		walked out of the room.</p>

		<p>"Oh.  My.  God," Jules exclaimed softly, hanging onto the closet
		door as she became over run with another fit of the giggles.  "It
		was brilliant Jess, absolutely fucking brilliant," she continued
		finally letting go of the closet door that had been supporting her
		and moving further into the room.</p>

		<p>Jess found herself smiling at Jules' good mood, despite the fact
		that she'd been feeling rather depressed and confused moments before
		the blonde had come back to their dorm room.  She waited quietly
		however, simply watching her lithe friend as she stumbled across the
		room before flinging herself, surprisingly gracefully, onto Jess's
		bed, shifting slightly once reclined so that her back was against
		the wall and her long, lean legs where hanging over the side.</p>

		<p>"He's such an ass," Jules continued, though her words were spoken
		with genuine affection.  She and Alex were always fighting and
		arguing, but it was in a comical, good-natured way that served as
		entertainment not only to themselves, but anyone who was fortunate
		enough to be in their immediate vicinity. </p>

		<p>"What'd you do?" Jess asked knowing that whatever happened it was
		Jules' fault.  Alex was the fall guy in that relationship.</p>

		<p>"Nothing," Jules replied looking over at Jess with a wounded
		expression on her face.  One that soon dissolved into a smile as her
		eyes darted away and she sheepishly added, "much anyway.  Besides,
		it's hardly my fault that the guy's like the antithesis of
		athletic."  </p>

		<p>Jess raised an eyebrow, indicating that further exposition would be
		very appreciated, her lips twitching slightly as she anticipated the
		tale she was about to hear.  She was feeling almost giddy.  It never
		ceased to amaze her.  Jules' moods were infectious.  If the blonde
		was happy, it was impossible for Jess to be anything but as well.
		She didn't really understand it, but she'd come to treasure it.</p>

		<p>"Alright, so, you know that couch in the lounge, the one with the
		wooden arms?" Jules' asked though she knew perfectly well Jess knew
		what couch she was talking about.  "So, I'm telling him about
		practice right, and he's being a real smart-ass asking me if next
		I'm gonna tell him that the great `soccer' gods have granted me the
		power to leap over tall buildings as well," she went on, ignoring
		Jess's amused look at the distaste in her tone when she
		said `soccer'.  "So, I'm all like," she went on pausing, a
		thoughtful look coming over her face before she frowned.  "I've been
		in California too long," she muttered looking distressed that the
		words `so, I'm all like' had even gone through her head, let alone
		come out of her mouth.  "Oh, it's funny is it?" she asked turning to
		look at Jess, who had started laughing, a faux threatening
		expression on her face.  "Stop that right now, my rapid decent into
		beach bunniness is not funny."</p>

		<p>"Really?" Jess asked thoughtfully.  "Then why am I laughing?"</p>

		<p>"Because you're evil," Jules growled launching herself at
		Jess.  "You're a creature of pure, undiluted evil and you must be
		stopped," she continued as she wrapped her arms around a struggling
		Jess, holding her captive in her arms.</p>

		<p>"How do you plan on doing that?" Jess asked laughing as she
		struggled, before hitching in a deep breath.  "You're not going to
		sing are you?" she asked suddenly, stilling as her voice filled with
		horror.</p>

		<p>"Hey," Jules exclaimed not having to completely feign her
		indignation this time.  "I'm a fine singer.  It's your ears that
		have the problem," she continued laughing as Jess started to
		struggle again, her arms unfurling to rain tickles all over Jess's
		body, her smile growing and her laughter getting louder as the girl
		beneath her shrieked and laughed, batting at her with her hands
		ineffectually.</p>

		<p>"Alright, alright, I give, stop it," Jess yelled, exhaling with
		relief when she felt Jules stop moving against her, her fingers
		dropping away from Jess's body, though her arm remained draped over
		her waist.  She could feel Jules' breath on the back of her neck and
		felt the vibrations running through the blonde's body as she
		continued to laugh softly.</p>

		<p>"The winner and still champion, Jules," Jules mumbled softly behind
		Jess, before making the sound of applause with her mouth.  "God,"
		she continued shifting slightly, momentarily pressing herself
		against Jess's back before pushing up onto her arm and then scooting
		back across the bed, settling back into the position she had
		occupied before.  "Beating you is hard work."</p>

		<p>Jess remained in the position their impromptu wrestling session had
		placed her in, lying on her stomach, arm flung over the side of her
		bed.  Her heart was racing a mile a minute and she found that she
		wasn't quite ready to move let alone speak.  In fact she wasn't sure
		that if she tried to speak anything but a series unintelligible
		sounds would emerge.  When she'd felt Jules' press against the
		length of her body, it had been like a surge of electricity shooting
		through her body.  She'd become hyper aware of everywhere their
		bodies were in contact, felt the heat of Jules' body like there was
		a fire burning beside her, the press of the blonde's breasts against
		her back ...</p>

		<p>Jess shot up suddenly, scrambling to stand almost falling off the
		bed in the process and not caring.  Once standing she brushed her
		hands down her pant legs nervously and turned in circles for a few
		seconds trying to figure out what to do with herself before finally
		looking up and over at Jules, a befuddled `Ah' coming out of her
		mouth before she ripped her eyes away Jules' concerned and confused
		gaze.</p>

		<p>"Are you alright?" Jules' asked sliding off of Jess's bed trying to
		keep her voice steady and strong.  There was more than a trace of
		panic in Jess's tone and movements and she didn't at all like that
		the other girl wasn't even able to meet her eyes.  She felt like
		slapping herself in the forehead, then maybe banging her head
		against a wall a few hundred ... thousand times until she had beaten
		out the stupidity.  She didn't know what she had been thinking lying
		around holding Jess in her arms after the brunette had
		called `uncle'.  It was stupid, it was severely stupid and she'd
		known that it was stupid at the time but still hadn't been able to
		help herself.  The reality of quietly laying with Jess in her arms
		overcoming any common sense she had left.  And, the idea that Jess
		had sensed something, that through bodily contact the other girl had
		managed to divine the more than friendly feelings she'd recently
		found herself harbouring, terrified her.  "Jess," she continued
		softly, her hand coming to gently rest on the girls shoulder.</p>

		<p>Jess jumped when she felt Jules' hand on her shoulder, relieved when
		she felt the pressure immediately disappear as Jules pulled back her
		hand.  She'd been so lost in the chaos of her emotions and
		disjointed thoughts that she hadn't even heard the blonde approach.</p>

		<p>Jules stared a her hand for long moments after ripping it away from
		Jess's body with the brunette flinched at her touch.  Jess had never
		flinched at her touch before.  She turned her hand over repeatedly,
		looking at palm and back trying to see if anything looked different,
		if there was any visual evidence of the change that had alarmed Jess
		so.  It looked the same, but she knew it wasn't.  Jess must have
		figured it out, and now couldn't stand the idea of being touched by
		her.  Jules let her hand drop to her side, as her eyes looked
		forward to gaze at Jess's back.</p>

		<p>"I ..." Jules started, though she quickly trailed off.  She didn't
		know what to say to make things better.</p>

		<p>"It's Joe," Jess said suddenly, her voice a bit shaky though she
		turned around to face Jules nonetheless.</p>

		<p>"Wha ..." Jules started meeting Jess's gaze, her brows drawing
		together in confusion.  She wasn't following.</p>

		<p>"Joe," Jess said in a firmer, more confident tone finally latching
		onto a reasonable explanation for the weirdness that was her
		emotions.  That's what it had to be, she thought to herself, feeling
		a bit better now that she had some idea of what was going on with
		her.  She hadn't had time to deal with the ramifications of the
		conversation they had just had.   There'd been no quiet since Jules
		had come back to the room, which was within seconds of her having
		hung up the phone, so it was understandable that in the first
		moments of quiet since then it should suddenly hit her.  It was
		perfectly reasonable for her to be feeling confused.</p>

		<p>"Joe," Jules breathed out, as a battle raged in her mind between her
		desire to sigh with relief and her desire to bang her head against a
		blunt object.  Her eyes skittered off to the side as she considered
		the oddity of her emotions.  She didn't understand how it was
		possible for her to be terrified of Jess knowing and then
		disappointed by the fact that she didn't.  Disappointed and
		relieved.  It made no sense.  </p>

		<p>"We broke up," Jess said watching Jules closely, not sure how to
		interpret the look on the blonde's face or the fact that she
		suddenly seemed unable to meet her eyes.  Jules had been supportive
		of her relationship with Joe, giving her more than enough support to
		make up for her families reluctance on the matter, but throughout
		and presently Jess wondered it she really meant it, or if she was
		just being a good friend.  Jules had told her that she was over Joe
		and not to worry about it, but looking at the blonde now she
		wondered, because Jules looked almost relieved.</p>

		<p>"When?  Why?" Jules asked finally looking over at Jess, deciding to
		contemplate her contradictory emotions later.  </p>

		<p>"Today.  Just now, before you got back," Jess responded her voice
		cracking a bit.  She was beginning to feel overwhelmed again, though
		she didn't particularly want to think about why.  She wanted a hug
		was what she wanted.  She wanted to take a few steps forward and
		feel Jules wrap her arms around her and press a kiss to her
		forehead.   However she suddenly felt the thought of wanting that
		alarming and the idea of getting it even more so, so she stayed
		where she was and brooded for a moment.  "I just wasn't working."</p>

		<p>"You seemed," Jules started then stopped certain that that wouldn't
		be the best thing to say.  She knew for a fact that the way things
		seemed weren't always the way they were.  "Was it the distance?"</p>

		<p>"Maybe," Jess said tiredly, reaching out for her desk chair and
		dropping into it.  "I don't know," she continued sounding confused
		as she watched Jules move to the side to take a seat on the edge of
		her head.</p>

		<p>"Did he ..." Jules started her back straightening as she looked over
		at Jess, her eyes narrowing slightly.  If Joe had broken up with
		Jess because ...</p>

		<p>"No," Jess interjected stopping Jules' inner diatribe.  "I ... it was
		my idea, you know," she continued allowing her eyes to drift around
		the room a bit.</p>

		<p>Jules remained silent, not certain what to say.  It was like she had
		been about to say before, Jess seemed happy.  For that matter, Joe
		seemed happy from the few times they had spoken since they'd gone to
		Santa Clara.  She couldn't think of a reason why Jess would break up
		with him, and from the look on the other girl's face she wasn't
		certain that if she asked Jess would be able to answer her.</p>

		<p>"It's gonna sound terrible," Jess said softly looking over at Jules
		who was patiently watching her.</p>

		<p>"If it's the truth it's not terrible.  Terrible would be to deny
		it," Jules replied, shifting further back onto the bed so that she
		was resting against the wall again.</p>

		<p>"The novelty wore off," Jess said, her voice barely audible as she
		looked over at Jules through her eyes lashes.</p>

		<p>Jules had to try extremely hard not to laugh at that.  She wasn't
		trying to be insensitive or unkind, it was just that she understood
		exactly what Jess was saying.  Joe's novelty had worn off for her
		months ago, though she realized that her reasons were probably far
		different from Jess's.  She couldn't have guessed it at the time,
		but her mother had been right about her.  Not with her crazy
		theories about slacks and sports bras, but she'd seen her attraction
		to Jess before Jules herself had become aware of it.  And as her
		eyes drifted over to the Mia Ham poster tacked on the wall by her
		bed, Jules realized her mother had been onto something with the
		poster thing too.  In fact, Jules was now of the opinion that Joe
		had been her first and only real crush because he'd been so pretty.
		The man had high, delicate cheekbones that were to die for, and
		luscious, full lips that were rare on men.  Not to mention the trim,
		compact body.  It was no wonder she'd found picturing him with long
		hair to be such a fulfilling mental exercise.</p>

		<p>"How do you mean?" she asked turning her attention to Jess.  Joe may
		have been a pretty man, but he had nothing on the girl sitting in
		front of her, and she could've saved herself a lot of heartache and
		dramatic brooding if she'd just realized sooner that it wasn't Jess
		she was jealous of in Germany when she'd found them on the balcony
		about to kiss.</p>

		<p>"I don't know," Jess said sounding a bit frustrated.  "I mean I'm
		just not excited you know.  At the beginning it was great, and I
		used to get all knocky in the knees whenever I heard his braggart
		voice over the line," she went on. "And I mean it's not like I don't
		like or want to talk to him now, it's just that ..."</p>

		<p>"Your knees are no longer in perilous danger," Jules stated starting
		to get an idea what was wrong.</p>

		<p>Jess simply nodded.</p>

		<p>"It's not terrible.  It's human, it happens to everyone," Jules
		stated moving forward a bit on the bed so that she was leaning
		towards Jess.  "We fall in love with the idea of being in love
		instead of with the person we think we're in love with," she
		continued trying to think about how ironic it was that Joe was that
		person for both of them.  Poor guy.</p>

		<p>"I'm not a completely ungrateful prat? Jess asked looking over at
		Jules.</p>

		<p>"Ungrateful?  Nah," Jules said waving her hand.  "Prat?  Well,
		that's another story," she continued laughing as Jess picked up a
		sock off of the floor and threw it had her.  "Oh my god, are you
		trying to kill me?" Jules asked catching the offending sock in the
		air before it hit her and holding it up with two fingers for Jess to
		see.  "This is like a biological weapon, you could take down a small
		nation with this," she continued waving the dirty football sock
		around before flinging it back at Jess.  "Talk about fighting dirty."</p>

		<p>"Oh, shut up," Jess muttered glaring at Jules who merely grinned at
		her saucily in response.</p>

		<p>"You feel better now?" Jules asked turning serious again a few
		moments later, drawing Jess's attention to her from where she'd been
		playing with her sock.</p>

		<p>"Strangely, yeah," Jess responded bringing the sock to her
		nose.  "These are fine," she went on a second later pointing at
		Jules with them.</p>

		<p>"Well, I'll admit that as far as foot smells go, yours is rather ...
		aromatic, but ..." Jules started, but before she could finish Jess was
		out of her chair and in front of Jules waving the sock in front of
		her face before pressing the object in question against Jules' nose.</p>

		<p>Jules lifted her hand to her face a few moments later and picked up
		the sock Jess had discarded, tossing it across the room as she felt
		the bed depress, Jess dropping down to the join her on the mattress.</p>

		<p>"How'd he take it?" she asked looking over at the brunette who was
		staring at the ceiling.</p>

		<p>"He was confused," Jess sighed.  "Couldn't or wouldn't really grasp
		what I was saying.  Telling me that if it was about my family they'd
		understand.  He already had my Father out playing cricket two days a
		week.  Truthfully, I don't think I was explaining it very well.  I
		mean, how do you tell someone you liked the idea of them better than
		the reality without sounding like a complete arse?"</p>

		<p>"You don't.  It's just better to do it sooner than later," Jules
		responded.  "He just needs some time."</p>

		<p>"How did you ..." Jess started to ask, before trailing off, certain
		that it wasn't at all appropriate to ask Jules how she had gotten
		over the guy that had picked her instead.</p>

		<p>Jules looked over at Jess, and in her mind pictured herself telling
		Jess exactly how she'd gotten over him.  `Well,' she'd start.  `I
		realized I was falling in love with best friend, that'd be you in
		case you were wondering, and the rest seemed to fall into place.'</p>

		<p>"Gold Medal Ribbon," was what she actually said.</p>

		<p>"What?" Jess asked looking over at Jules questioning.</p>

		<p>"Ice-cream," Jules responded smiling and shaking her head at
		Jess.  "Come on," she continued grasping the brunette's hand and
		tugging.  "Come on, come on, up we go," she continued planting her
		feet and tugging until she got Jess upright.</p>

		<p>"Where're we going?" Jess asked in a beleaguered tone though she was
		smiling.</p>

		<p>"Downstairs.  Cafeteria.  Ice-cream bin," Jules responded dragging
		Jess towards the door.  "You're going to sit and listen to me finish
		my story ... yeah I remember," she continued smiling as she nudged
		Jess's arm playfully.  "Then I'll sing some bitter anti-love songs
		for you, cause I know how soothing and melodic you find my voice."</p>

		<p>"I swear," Jess said rounding on Jules and pointing a finger into
		the taller girls chest.  "If you sing to me I will beat you to
		death."</p>

		<p>"Even if I smile all dapper like this, and dance about like this?"
		Jules asked smiling dapperly and making some ridiculous movements
		with her arms and legs that had Jess almost doubled over with
		laughter in a matter of seconds.   </p>

		<p>"You're an idiot," Jess declared a moment later once she'd gotten
		herself under control again.</p>

		<p>"I've made peace with it," Jules told her seriously.  "Now for my
		musical selection, would you prefer something gross or
		objectifying?" she continued opening the door and tumbling into the
		hallway while batting Jess's hands away from her.</p>
