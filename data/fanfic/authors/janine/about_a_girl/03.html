<p><i><u>Katie's House - Two weeks later (a.k.a. Jessie's first night of freedom)</u></i></p>

<p>"When are your parents coming home?" Jessie asked as she curled up  against Katie's side.  They were in Katie's bedroom, lying down on  her bed watching Gladiator, Jessie was convinced, for no other reason  other than the hotness of Connie Neilson.</p>

<p>"Late," Katie replied pressing a kiss to Jessie's forehead.  "That  new medicine they've got mom on is really making an improvement and  they went to celebrate.  Which mean have wild, loud sex in a classy  motel … which is code for ones with specialty rooms," Katie  continued.  She didn't often talk about her mom's depression because  she didn't really know what to say about it, other than that it  really sucked and was hard, but she knew that no matter what she said  around Jessie it'd be okay, because she had gone through the same  thing with her mom.</p>

<p>"Okay, ewwww," Jessie responded making a face at the thought of  anyone their parents age having sex.</p>

<p>"I know which is why they went to a motel, to spare me the emotional  distress of hearing through the walls.  And really, I thank them for  that," Katie replied before getting distracted by the feel of  Jessie's hand moving on her stomach, where it had been resting, and  starting to slip underneath the material.</p>

<p>Katie took in a sharp breath as she then felt Jessie's hand begin to  move on the bare skin of her stomach, taking a deep breath to try and  calm her breathing which was becoming rapidly erratic.  As Jessie's  hand continued move across her skin, she began to feel herself flush  with warmth.  "Wha…what are you doing?" Katie asked her mind  beginning to flood with very naughty thoughts.</p>

<p>Jessie's hand stilled and she looked up at Katie nervously.  "Do you  want me to stop?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"No," Katie responded immediately.  "But I have to admit, I'm not  exactly thinking clearly at the moment," she continued as she felt  her head start to spin.</p>

<p>"You're not?" Jessie asked pushing against her more tightly though  she kept her hand still.</p>

<p>"Nnn…oo," Katie replied shivering at the feel of Jessie so close to  her.</p>

<p>"Is that good thing or a bad thing?" Jessie asked already knowing the  answer, but wanting an excuse to stay pressed up against Katie.</p>

<p>"It certainly feels like good thing," Katie exhaled softly smiling,  the smile fading to be replaced by another gasp as Jessie started to  move her hand again.  This time tentatively pushing up the material  of Katie's shirt to reveal her abdomen.  She stared down at the pale  skin, lightly moving up and down, before lowering her head so that it  was bent over Katie's stomach.  Then she closed the remaining  distance between her lips and Katie's stomach, planting small, wet  kisses all over the skin, then leaning back slightly and blowing on  the skin, watching as little goose bumps appeared all over.  At this  Katie felt a surge of electricity shot straight through her,  apparently intent on settling in her groin and promptly jumped off of  the bed, pacing around agitatedly as she pulled down her shirt.</p>

<p>"You can't.  I'm mean you can't just do and…and…and…and do …THAT…and… and …and…and," Katie began in a flustered voice not able to say  anything coherent, as those feeling kept shooting through her body  making thought very, very difficult.  </p>

<p>"I thought you liked it," Jessie said softly, not quite sure what to  make of Katie's response, and wishing she hadn't done anything  because of it.</p>

<p>"I did, I do," Katie said walking back over to the bed realizing that  she was freaking Jessie out.  "I like it a lot, too much.  Definitely  too much.  Like I really liked it…like liked it a lot," she went on  both wanting to think about how much she liked it, and fearing that  thinking about liking it would get her all worked up again now that  she was just starting to calm down.</p>

<p>"Then why did you … you know, run away?" Jessie asked wanting to  believe Katie, but having insecurities jump up in her face making it  harder than it should've been to actually accept what she was saying.</p>

<p>"Because," Katie said standing up again and pacing once  more.  "Because touching like that leads to stuff … naked stuff.   Naked … sweaty stuff," she continued her voice lowering slowly as she  spoke.  "Naked sweaty stuff on the bed…"</p>

<p>"I get it," Jessie interrupted blushing as images of what Katie was  describing came to her, making her shift suddenly feeling a bit warm.</p>

<p>"Yeah, so," Katie responded snapping out of it and carefully lying  back down on the bed.  "This way, the no stuff way … is good," she  continued as her head came to rest against the pillow.  Jessie nodded  tentatively shifting back towards Katie, then snuggling in once more  when her girlfriend made no effort to move.</p>

<p>"Do you not want," Jessie started a moment later, "to do stuff.  With  me?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," Katie replied wondering immediately if she  should've taken a moment to make sure she didn't sound like an  undersexed 14-year-old boy looking at his Seven of Nine poster.  "I  just…I mean, I didn't know if you wanted to yet, and I didn't want to  make it seem like, well you know, make you feel like just because I  wanted to, you had to want to … too.  Because I don't want anything…"</p>

<p>"That I don't want," Jessie finished for her lifting her head to look  at Katie.  "I wasn't trying to get you worked up," she continued a  moment later.   "I just … sometimes I just get this need to touch you  and …"</p>

<p>"It's okay," Katie said interrupting her, knowing that Jessie wasn't  ready to go any farther yet.  It was fine with her; she probably  really wasn't ready for it either, hormones were just tricky  bastards.  "You're not ready, that's fine."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed in response to Katie's statement and rolled away from  her flipping onto her back on the other side of the bed.  She knew  that Katie was ready to move on to the next step, that sometimes when  they were together Katie literally had to stop herself from touching  Jessie to keep things under control.  And she wanted to be ready to  move on too, she'd thought about it, taking things to the next step,  but she just knew that she wasn't ready to do more than think about  it and that upset her because she knew that she couldn't give Katie  something she wanted, maybe even needed.  </p>

<p>"On TV everyone always says its alright, but then you always find  them making out in the janitors closet with some hoochie who *will*  give it up," Jessie moaned closing her eyes dejectedly, thinking that  this is what you get for dating a stupid sophomore.  </p>

<p>Katie rolled over so that she was leaning over Jessie with her arms  braced on the sides of the girl's body, and looked up at her very  seriously and said, "that's not going to happen.  They lock the  janitor's closets at our school."  </p>

<p>Jessie looked down at her face and couldn't help but smile at the  expression Katie was wearing before she turned her head away self- consciously.  </p>

<p>"Seriously though.  That's not gonna happen.  I love you.  And even  though everyone on TV might be a lying bastard, I'm not.  You're the  only girl for me," Katie continued with absolute seriousness this  time.  Jessie looked down at Katie meeting her gaze for a few moments  after this, the eye contact between them only breaking when Katie  leaned up and kissed her softly.  </p>

<p>Her girlfriend then rolled off of her on back onto her side of the  bed.  "So um, we probably shouldn't watch `Bound' next."</p>

<p>"So what was with the receiver off the hook last night, Singer?" Tad  asked nudging Katie lecherously as he grinned over at her.  He'd been  fairly pissed off at her for a couple of days, and then unimpressed  with her for a couple more days, but after she'd come over to his  house giving him the puppy dog eyes, things had pretty much gone back  to normal.  In fact as he asked this, she was dismounting from his  back after the piggyback ride he'd just given her through the  hallways.  He figured that he had no chance with Jessie so he could  as well live vicariously through his friend.</p>

<p>"Shut up Tad," Katie responded slapping him on the shoulder, though  she was smiling widely.</p>

<p>"Sup?" Russell asked coming up behind them wrapping his arm around  Katie's neck playfully.  Katie yanked off his hat and pulled it over  her head, nodding at him with a slight pout on her lips, completely  thugged out.</p>

<p>"Katie's phone was off the hook last night, while Jessie was over and  her parents were out," Tad responded grinning, smiling even brighter  at the look of pure venom Katie shot him as Russell `oooooh'ed in her  ear, using the opportunity to also steal his hat back.</p>

<p>"Hey," they heard from the side, all three of them turning to see  Sarah Grasser standing beside them.</p>

<p>"What'd you want?" Tad asked contemptuously, standing up to his full  height.  He'd never liked Sarah much; she always acted like something  had crawled up to ass to everyone but Katie.  It had pissed him off,  how she'd been able to dupe his friend for so long.  Even now, Katie  still isn't insisted that she wasn't always a complete bitch, but Tad  knew better.  Sarah was just letting Katie see it now too.  </p>

<p>"Can I talk to you for a minute?" Sarah asked ignoring Tad and  looking straight at Katie.</p>

<p>"I don't know that we have anything to talk about," Katie replied as  Russell and Tad glared at Sarah for her, allowing her to remain  looking nonchalant.</p>

<p>"Please," Sarah said ignoring Katie's entourage.  "Just for a  minute," she continued her voice slightly pleading.</p>

<p>"Fine," Katie said not really wanting to see her grovel in the middle  of the hallway.  "Over here," she said nodding to a quieter place  down the hall.</p>

<p>"Desperate's her colour don't you think?" Russell asked as they  watched to two girls make their way down the hall.</p>

<p>"Nah, I'd go with black, to match her soul," Tad replied smiling.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Sammler, you have GOT to call me," Brian Jones called out as  Jessie and Grace made their way through the halls.</p>

<p>"Cool, I'll pencil you in right after pigs fly," Jessie called back  winking at him before pushing on.</p>

<p>"Nice," Grace commented, thinking that was a smoothly delivered  comeback.  She would have to give that one a grade of at least 9.7.</p>

<p>"You know what they say about practice," Jessie responded absently,  shaking her head.  They could at least try and come up with some  original material.</p>

<p>"How often do you get that?" Grace asked thinking that while Jessie  had always been able to hold her own in verbal sparring match, one- line zingers had never been her specialty.</p>

<p>"Oh, just about a million times everyday," Jessie, muttered rolling  her eyes.   "Hmmm, soon you'll be able to insult in a single bound," Grace  commented, pleased to see Jessie smirk at the comment, but a little  disoriented when she saw her stepsister's face cloud over a second  later.  Turning her head to follow Jessie's Grace saw Katie and Sarah  Grasser standing off in a quiet corner just down the hallway.</p>

<p>Jessie took a step forwards as if she were going to head over but  then stopped.  It was ridiculous, she had a class to get to, and  Katie could talk to whomever she wanted.  She wasn't going to be one  of those jealous girlfriends who like video taped every move their  significant other made.  It was stupid.</p>

<p>"You're not going over there?" Grace asked having seen Jessie's move  forward and then her abrupt stop.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie replied even though she really wanted to.</p>

<p>"Why?  You obviously want to," Grace asked.</p>

<p>"Because I'm not going to give Sarah the satisfaction of knowing that  she actually makes me jealous, so she can just take her conniving and  suck on it REAL hard," Jessie muttered before turning down the  hallway that led to her class leaving Grace alone to observe the  scene.  Grace shook her head in sympathy for the bitch fest that  Katie was bound to be gobsmacked with later for her egregious break  in dating etiquette then headed for her own class.</p>

<hr>

<p>"What is it?" Katie asked boredly leaning against a nearby locker as  Sarah stopped in front of her looking down at her shoes doing her  best humility impression.</p>

<p>"Do you have to be so hostile?" Sarah asked quietly looking up at  Katie as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Just following your lead," Katie replied not looking at Sarah,  knowing that if she did she'd feel bad for snapping at the girl even  though she deserved it and not wanting that to happen.  She'd tried,  when she'd realized that she'd hurt Sarah, she'd tried to talk to  her, tried to make her realize that they could still be friends even  if everything else had to end, but Sarah hadn't wanted to hear it,  hadn't been able to hear.  She'd made Katie choose and then she'd  gotten mad and bitchy when Katie chose Jessie.  It was Sarah's  problem to deal with now, not hers.  She'd tried.</p>

<p>"I deserve that," Sarah said with a sigh, glancing over at Katie.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you really do," Katie, replied, her stance loosening  nonetheless now that she was fairly confident that they were about to  have a civil conversation instead of the usual spitting contest.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you know," Sarah said seeing Katie relax slightly.  "About  how I acted after … about how I acted.  I was just hurt, and I know  you didn't mean to," she added quickly seeing Katie tense in  preparation to respond.  "Really I do.  It's just you know, sometimes  teenage plus girl equals unimaginable bitch," she continued adding to  herself that when you added love to the equation the bitch just got  bigger.  "I should've been happy for you, and I am.  Now," she pushed  on seeing Katie watching her with interest.  "And you said, before  that we could still we friends, and you know, if that offers still on  the table I'd like to accept it this time.  I miss you."</p>

<p>Katie looked at Sarah intensely for a moment before sighing and  letting her gaze drift around the crowded hallway.  After things had  gone bad between them, she'd been filled with so much guilt, and  she'd wished for so long that the day would come when Sarah would  realize that she hadn't meant any harm and they could just go back to  the way things had been before.  But that had been a wish she'd long  since given up on, and now that she had heard the words she'd longed  to hear for so long, she just felt sad, hollow.  She realized she  didn't really care anymore, that while Sarah may have missed her she  didn't miss Sarah all that much.  But, she also remembered when  things had been good between them, fun.  Sarah had never touched her  deep down inside like Jessie did, she never felt Sarah's presence  with her even when she wasn't around like she did Jessie, and they  didn't have that age old friendship that tied them together tighter  than either of them realized like she did with Tad.  Sarah was just  fun, but fun had been really good.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said quietly her gaze drifting back to  Sarah.  "It's not that I don't want to be friends, it's just that  with everything that's happened it'd be really complicated."</p>

<p>"And by complicated you mean Jessie doesn't like me and if we start  hanging out again she won't let you in the ballpark let alone near  any of her bases," Sarah replied darkly, having sensed Katie on the  edge of giving her a chance.</p>

<p>"So we're back to this are we?" Katie asked tiredly looking over at  Sarah sadly.  "I'd like to accept your offer, really I would.  But I  don't believe you, and you're not helping yourself with shit like  that.  Jessie's my girlfriend, and I'm not going to risk hurting her  by hanging out with you if all you're gonna do is insult our  relationship and piss and moan about how life done you wrong," Katie  continued beginning to pick up speed.  "Sometimes things don't work  out the way we want them to.  Deal with it.  You're not special.   You're problems aren't any more of a tragedy than anyone else's," she  went on pushing off the locker.  "So yeah, we can be friends again …  when you stop taking behavioral tips from you're three year old  sister," she finished starting down the hallway.</p>

<p>"Wait," Sarah said reaching out for her and grasping her around the  arm stopping her from moving.  "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you keep saying that, and yet…" Katie replied removing Sarah's  hand from her arm.</p>

<p>"Please, just give me a chance," Sarah continued moving to stand in  front of Katie looking up at her through her eyelashes as innocent as  could be.  "I promise, no more digs.  Let's just hang out, and if  it's cool then it's cool, and if you find my company unbearable than  I swear I won't bug you again."</p>

<p>Katie looked over at Sarah's pleading face, and sad hopeful eyes and  sighed.  The offer sounded reasonable, and it couldn't really hurt  anything.  "Fine.  What'd you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"How about a study session?" Sarah suggested trying to remain calm.   She hadn't expected Katie to give in so easily, but she was delighted  that she had.  Maybe Katie missed her to and was just too proud to  admit it.  "You help me with math, I'll help you with geography and  we can top off by making fun of Mauray Povich."</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie said brightening at the suggestion of Mauray  Povich.  Jessie refused to watch it with her, even though she  insisted they would only watch to mock him endlessly.  She had so  much daytime TV hate bottled up and would now be able to release it  constructively.</p>

<p>"Great.  How about after school then?" Sarah asked.  "I mean unless  you already have plans," she continued uncertainly images of Jessie  floating around her mind mocking her.</p>

<p>"After school's fine," Katie responded.  Jessie had a doctor's  appointment and was going out to dinner with her mom afterwards so  they hadn't made any plans.  "I'll drop by your locker.  We can do it  at my house, mom's likely to be upstairs grouting something so we  won't have to worry about her."</p>

<p>"Cool, see you then," Sarah said backing up and turning around not  wanting to stick around and give Katie a chance to change her mind.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, later," Katie replied absently as Sarah headed off down the  hallway, sighing once the girl was out of sight.  She suddenly felt  like someone had just strapped a medium sized planet to her back.   Intellectually, she couldn't see what was wrong with trying to get  along with Sarah again; lord knew her life was easier when the other  girl didn't actively hate her.  Yet, despite this line of reasoning,  she couldn't help but feel she'd just made a serious mistake.   Sighing again she shook her head, there was nothing she could do  about it now; she'd given Sarah her word, and it was only one night. </p>

<p>"This is a surprise," Katie commented as Jessie came up behind her,  wrapping an arm around her waist lightly before leaning up against a  nearby locker.  "Of the chocolate variety of course."</p>

<p>"Chocolate variety?" Jessie asked watching as Katie loaded up her  backpack with a bunch of books Jessie was quite certain she had no  intention of reading.</p>

<p>"Scrumptious," Katie replied finally closing her locker door and  looking over at Jessie.  "I thought you had your appointment today?"  she said remembering Jessie's dislike for the word `therapy' being  mentioned in the public sphere.  That was one of the things she loved  about Jessie, how real she was.  Most of the kids at school thought  being in therapy and riddled with neurosis's was some sort of badge  of honor, mostly because they'd never had to go through anything that  would make them have to go to therapy thus leaving them with the  delusion that it was somehow romantic.  </p>

<p>"I do," Jessie replied pushing off the locker.  "Just thought I'd  walk you out."</p>

<p>"That's a thought I can definitely get behind," Katie replied with a  small smile following Jessie down the hall.</p>

<p>"So, what'd you do last night?" Jessie asked trying to sound blasé.</p>

<p>Katie sighed shaking her head slightly before responding.  "Sarah  came by.  She stopped me at school yesterday and was all, blah, blah,  blah, regretcakes saying she was sorry about everything."</p>

<p>"And you believed her?" Jessie asked trying fight back the urge to  grab Katie by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.</p>

<p>"Well, she'd certainly eaten her Bitch Flakes with frosting that  morning, but she did seem sorry … and she just looked so pathetic.  I  just couldn't tell her to get lost, it would've been like kicking a  puppy," Katie tried to explain knowing from Jessie's tone that she  was upset, and not really blaming her for being so.</p>

<p>"Well, how was it?" Jessie asked somehow managing not to comment that  Sarah always seemed more like a crazy, rabies infected dog than a  cute little puppy.  She certainly wouldn't have had a problem kicking  her; she probably would've liked it.</p>

<p>"It was alright I guess," Katie responded in a bored tone.  "I mean  it was kinda weird at first, cause I could tell that she was making a  serious effort not to snap at me.  But once we started working it was  okay.  I mean she's so retarded, asking how angles could be obtuse,"  Katie continued her voice a little more animated know.  "I'd  forgotten what a knob she could be.  And then when she went on about  how every episode of Mauray is the same, it was so funny cause it's  like totally true.  It's always either boot camp or children with sad  defects, and…" Katie went on until they exited the building and  Jessie had to go meet her mother.</p>

<p>"Alright, see ya later," Katie said as Jessie opened the door to  Karen's car.  "Hi, Ms. Sammler," she added waving at Karen who smiled  and waved back at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded smiling weakly, then ducking into the car.   If she'd been assaulted by one more verse of Katie's ode to Sarah she  didn't know what she would've done.  God, she loathed that girl.</p>

<hr>

<p><i><u>Two Weeks Later</u></i></p>

<p>"Do I look like Gumby?" Jessie bitched at Grace from across the  kitchen table.  "Does my arm look like it's made out of some  incredible stretching material that can zoom across the kitchen and  pick up a bagel so that you don't have to get off your lazy ass?" she  continued crankily swishing her cereal around in the bowl.</p>

<p>"What the hell is your problem?" Grace asked shooting Jessie a look  just as hostile as the other girl's tone.</p>

<p>"Your face," Jessie muttered not even bothering to look up from the  milk in her bowl.</p>

<p>"My face?" Grace asked indignantly.  "My face!?!  What are you still  in kindergarten?  What's next a `yo mamma' joke?" she continued  standing up and moving away from the table.  "No wonder Katie's  hanging out with Sarah again," she said sensing an opportunity to get  back at Jessie and snapping at it like a hungry Panda.  "I'd hardly  want to be around you either," she finished walking out of the  kitchen, not needing to look back to know that her statements had hit  their mark.  Her face indeed.</p>

<p>Jessie glanced up watching Grace exit the kitchen with a frown  marring her fine features, before sighing and going back to her  contemplation of her Corn Pops, Grace's closing words echoing in her  mind.  She'd been obsessing over Sarah and her reemergence into  Katie's life ever since the afternoon Katie couldn't shut up about  her.  She knew without a doubt that Sarah was trying to worm her way  back into Katie's good graces so that she could try and get her away  from Jessie, but Katie for all of her wonderful qualities seemed  completely oblivious to what the other girl was after.  In her  defense, the way Katie treated her hadn't changed in the least, she  was still as doting and attentive as ever, and didn't really seem  inclined to mention Sarah at all unless Jessie herself brought her  up.  But still, there was a little voice nagging Jessie at the back  of her head asking her if Katie was really as oblivious to what Sarah  was doing as she acted.  Making her wonder if Sarah actually had a  chance because she would do anything to get Katie back, while she  herself wasn't willing to do anything to keep her.</p>

<p>Before that night a week ago, they had never actually discussed being  physically intimate.  Like a lot of other things in their  relationship the answer had seemed to be already known to them so  they hadn't needed to talk about it, just like how at the beginning  they hadn't needed to talk about how much affection they would  display in public, they just seemed to understand what the other  would be comfortable with.  But now that they had talked about it,  and Jessie knew for a fact that Katie was ready and was only waiting  on her, she began to be consumed by thoughts of it.  About whether  she was being fair to Katie and their relationship by holding out,  about why she felt the need to hold out even though she often had to  fight herself for control when they got into heavy make-out sessions,  and when the very idea of it made her all tingly inside.  And now  that Sarah had reemerged with her dirty girlfriend stealing hands  pawing wantonly at Katie, who seemed content to just ignore them  instead of patting them off of her, Jessie had begun to think about  it more.  She began to think about taking away the only advantage  Sarah could possibly have over her, and making Katie hers completely.</p>

<p>"What can I say?" Katie asked shrugging playful as she and Jessie  backed away from Tad and a few other assembled people.  "Where goes  Jessie, so goes my nation," she continued which was met by a chorus  of whipping sounds being made.</p>

<p>"They're such punks," Katie commented once they were out of earshot  of the others.  </p>

<p>"You know you love them," Jessie replied smiling as Katie mock glared  at the memory.  Katie shrugged conceding Jessie's point.</p>

<p>"So, for what did I just get myself labeled P-whipped?" Katie asked  as they continued down the hall.  They'd all just been lounging  around when Jessie had whispered to her that she wanted to talk to  her alone, and now she found herself intensely curious as to what was  on her girlfriends mind.</p>

<p>"P-whipped?" Jessie asked ignoring Katie's question for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yep.  As far as everyone is concerned I am now officially the bottom  in this relationship," Katie replied.  "So this better be worth it."</p>

<p>"My moms leaving for some conference this afternoon and is gonna be  gone all weekend," Jessie began willing her hands to stop  shaking.  "So, I'll basically have the place all to myself," she went  on.  "I was thinking that you should come over."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie agreed instantly, thinking that some quality time ALONE  with Jessie couldn't be anything but of the good, already planning  for sappy movies and multiple snuggles.  "Sounds like good times."</p>

<p>"Okay," Jessie said realizing that she had made the right decision as  soon as Katie responded positively the moment she had finished  talking.  Katie had said that she'd been fine with waiting, but that  response had proven that she really didn't want to, because everyone  knew that when you got invited over to your significant others empty  house for the weekend it was equivalent to saying `let's have  sex'.  "How about seven-ish?" Jessie continued.</p>

<p>"I'll be there," Katie replied smiling at her seeing `Beaches' in  their future.  "Cause I simply refuse to be square."</p>

<p>"Oh that's not going to be a problem," Jessie muttered to herself, as  the weight of planning for this evening began to settle across her  shoulders.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked not quite being able to make out what Jessie had  said.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie replied.  "What do you have next?"</p>

<hr>

<p><u><i>Karen's House – That Night</i></u></p>

<p>Katie flipped through Karen's cd collection with quite a bit of  interest as Jessie shuffled between running upstairs and downstairs.   She'd tried asking Jessie what she was doing and if she wanted any  help, but Jessie had repeatedly told her to just relax and she'd see  soon enough.  So, after a final finger wagging Katie had acquiesced  and began looking at Karen's cd's, which were actually quite  impressive as far as she was concerned.</p>

<p>"You're mom's got some great taste in music," Katie commented sensing  Jessie as she walked into the living room.</p>

<p>"You think?" Jessie asked not really in the mood to make small  talk.  "She'll be happy to hear that," she continued steering the  conversation away from anything that had to do with her mother.  "Why  don't you come upstairs, I want to show you something."</p>

<p>"Oh, field trip," Katie replied grinning at Jessie as she turned away  from the cd rack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Katie looked around the room in something close to awe.  There were  no lights on, but the room was softly lit by a dozen or so candles  strategically placed around the room, and in the background she could  hear the strings to some soft music playing, Sade or something like  that.  The room looked absolutely amazing, completely drenched in  atmosphere.  "Wow," she breathed out as Jessie slowly walked up to  her.  "This is incredib…" was all she managed to get out however,  because Jessie's lips soon came to cover hers swallowing whatever she  may have wanted to say, though truthfully the moment Jessie's lips  touched hers she hadn't wanted to say anything anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Katie arched into Jessie's touch as she felt her girlfriends hands  begin to sneak under her shirt and she brought their lips together  again.  The feelings that were cursing through her body were almost  overwhelming, everything that Jessie was doing to her just felt so  good that she almost couldn't stand it.  But there was something  wrong, even though everything in her body seemed to be feeling right  for like the first time ever, there was this shadow at the back of  her mind telling her that something wasn't right.  So finally,  wishing that she could kick her own ass for stopping what they were  doing, she pulled back from Jessie's lips stepping away from her to  put a little space between them.</p>

<p>"What's…what's going on here?" she said her voice coming out in short  gasps as she looked at Jessie, who's face was undetectable at the  moment, making her think that she was definitely right to stop things.</p>

<p>"I would think that's fairly obvious," Jessie replied stepping  towards Katie again.  </p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded watching Jessie closely.  "Everything's right  out of `Seduction 101'.  What isn't obvious is why you're doing this  when you clearly don't want to be," she continued still staring at  Jessie.  Jessie had been going through the motions, she'd been going  through them really well, but there had been no passion behind them.   She'd felt more raw affection from her girlfriend months ago when  they'd just sat at the foot of Jessie's bed staring at each other,  than she had moments ago.</p>

<p>"I don't see how anything I've done could be interpreted as not  wanting to," Jessie replied stepping closer, taking Katie's hands  into hers.  "This was my idea after all."  </p>

<p>"What changed?" Katie asked still uncertain.  She wanted nothing more  than to pick up where they'd left off, if Jessie truly wanted to, but  she didn't think that Jessie wanted to, and she couldn't, she  wouldn't go through with anything if that were the case.  She just  couldn't understand why Jessie would go to all of this trouble and  then be so vacant.</p>

<p>"Listen," Jessie said her voice rising a little as she realized that  Katie wasn't just going to let her get on with it.  "If you don't  want to sleep with me, just say so!"</p>

<p>"That's not it," Katie said reaching out for Jessie who'd pulled away  from her, not knowing how Jessie could possibly believe that that  could be anything that approached the truth.  "You're just … you're  not here with me," Katie continued.  "You say you want to, but it's  like your mind is somewhere else, like you're being forced into  something, and I don't understand why you should feel like that.  I  mean did I do something to make you think you had to do this, even if  you didn't want to?" Katie asked the mere implication that she may  have made Jessie feel pressured into sleeping with her before she was  ready cutting into her like a knife.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted this?" Jessie asked closing her eyes and making  them sting as she tried to contain her tears behind them.  "Do you  not need it anymore?"</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked now completely lost.  "I don't understand," she  continued trying to draw Jessie into a hug, but stopping when her  girlfriend resisted her pull.  "What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie muttered finally opening her eyes and moving around  Katie to turn on the lights, humiliation settling over her  uncomfortably, closely followed by extreme vulnerability.</p>

<p>"It's obviously not nothing," Katie said following Jessie to the  door, and touching her on the arm lightly.  "It's something, and I  want to know what."</p>

<p>Jessie let out a small humorless grunt of laughter and shrugged out  of Katie's grasp, her feelings of vulnerability putting her on the  defensive.  "You've been spending a lot of time with Sarah," she said  softly moving back towards the center of the room.</p>

<p>"Sarah?" Katie asked completely befuddled.  "What does Sarah have to  do with any …" she began to say before pausing as a thought struck  her.  "You think she's trying to steal me away from you," Katie said  softly, her eyes beginning to tear up as she glanced at Jessie whose  wandering eyes indirectly confirmed what she had said.  "By putting  out," she continued her voice rising incredulously.</p>

<p>"God Jessie!" she exclaimed a moment later as she realized what the  girl must have thinking, what was really going on.  "I'm not sleeping  with Sarah, I don't want to sleep with Sarah, and I never have," she  continued, her nostrils flaring slightly as she tried to keep control  of her temper, not wanting to say something she'd regret later.  "If  she was the last person on her earth, I'd rather dedicate my life to  the study of seashells than sleep with her," she went on.  "How can  you not know this?" she asked with more than a touch of exasperation  in her voice.  "How can you still not know that you're absolutely the  only person I ever think about?  I mean is it me?  Am I not telling  you how I feel enough so that you actually think you have to whore  yourself to me to get me to stay?" she asked running a head through  her hair and thus missing Jessie's wince at her accurate but painful  description of what she'd been trying to do.</p>

<p>"How many times do I have to tell you I don't care about the sex, I  care about you.  I want you, what's up here," Katie said touching her  head blinking away some tears that were stinging her eyes, "and in  here," she continued softly placing her hand over her heart.  "Not,"  she continued a moment later, "what's in your pants," she finished  bluntly shaking her head, as she wondered what it said about her,  about Jessie, about their relationship that they were even having  this conversation.  From that day in the attic, she'd given Jessie  all of the control and she'd continued by that prerogative always  letting Jessie be the first to start things, to kiss her, to tell her  mother about them, to ask her to the dance, to touch her in public  for the first time at school, and anything and everything else.  It  just boggled her mind that Jessie still didn't understand this,  didn't see that she had willingly given herself to her, that she  couldn't understand that she really loved her as much as she said she  did.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Jessie said reaching out for Katie only to have Katie  remove her hand from Jessie's.  "I wasn't thinking," she continued  starting to panic as she saw Katie begin to retreat into herself.  "I  was just so scared, that I might lose you … I wasn't, I didn't…"  Jessie finished trailing off lamely as she watched Katie watch her.   She'd screwed up royally, she was aware of that fact now.  All of her  fears and her concerns, they were just that, HER fears and concerns.   Nothing that she had worried about had even entered Katie's mind, and  her implication that they may have were now hurting Katie which was  something that she had never wanted to do.  She just couldn't have  fathomed that whatever she gave to Katie would've been enough, but  she was realizing that whether she could fathom it or not, it was the  truth.</p>

<p>Katie pressed the ball of her hand to the bridge of her nose wearily,  finally breaking the eye contact between her and Jessie.  She  believed her girlfriend when she said she was scared, and she could  clearly see that she was both upset and sorry, but she was also  upset, and confused and wondering how the hell all of this could have  happened.</p>

<p>"I know," Katie breathed out softly, finally dragging her hand away  from her face.  "But I have to go," she continued heading for the  door.  She needed some time alone, she had to think about things, and  try and sort out the jumbled mess of thoughts filling her head.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't go," Jessie said reaching out for her again, her voice  cracking as more tears slid down her face.  "Please."</p>

<p>Katie carefully placed her hand over top of Jessie's squeezing it  slightly before removing it from her arm.  "I think we both need some  time alone," she responded, wanting nothing more than to take Jessie  into her arms but knowing that she wouldn't be able to stand it if  she did.  "I'll call you tomorrow," and with that she walked out of  the bedroom door and headed for stairs, not once stopping to turn  back knowing that if she did it would break whatever was left of her  heart.</p>

<p>Jessie watched Katie's form disappear from sight, her eyes still  watering as she stood there in something close to shock.  She  couldn't quite comprehend what I had just happened, except to know  that somehow she had managed to screw things up to epic proportions.   They were supposed to have gotten closer tonight, as close as  possible, but instead she felt farther away from her girlfriend than  she had ever since they'd met.  </p>

<p>Stumbling back to her bed she sat down, just barely catching the edge  of it and placed her head in her hands.  God, what had she done?</p>

<p><i><u>Manning House . Brunch, the next day</u></i></p>

<p>"Where's the bacon?" Zoë asked frantically looking around the table
for her crispy goodness.  "What?" she asked as she saw her mom and
sister, and Eli start to snicker.  "What?" she asked again.  "Come
on, where's the bacon?" she asked again as Rick stood up to answer
the ringing phone.</p>

<p>"Just a second," he said into the receiver before placing it on his
shoulder.  "Jessie, Katie's on the phone," he said preparing to jump
out of the way when she pounced towards him to grab the phone, as was
usually the case.  He had been a casualty of young love, and didn't
want it to happen again.</p>

<p>"Can you just tell her that I'm not feeling well and I'll call her
later?" Jessie responded dully pushing the food on her plate around
absently, and thus missing the astonished looks from everyone
gathered around the table, including Zoë who had for the moment
forgotten about the bacon.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Rick started slowly not sure what was going on, but knowing
that having him lie to Katie for her couldn't possibly be the best
solution.  "I'm not going to lie to her for you, you're obviously
feeling fine, so if you have something that you'd like to discuss or
not discuss with Katie then."</p>

<p>"Fine!" Jessie in an alarmingly loud, but relatively calm voice as
she stood up from the table.  "Tell her the truth, tell her I'm not
here," and with that she headed towards the door, opening it and
escaping into the afternoon sunlight before anyone could stop her or
say anything to her.  She just couldn't talk to Katie, not after what
she'd done the night before.  She'd made complete ass out of herself,
she couldn't even understand what had been going through her head to
make her act that way.  All she knew was that the humiliation she
felt knew no bounds, and that she absolutely couldn't talk to Katie.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Katie," Rick said still watching the door in
amazement.  "She's not here right now, can I take a message?"</p>

<hr>

<p><i><u>School - Monday</u></i></p>

<p>"You've gotta be shittin me!" Katie exclaimed looking at Andrea like
she had just sprouted antennae.  "This is like the most ridiculous
assignment I've had the intense displeasure of having to not do," she
continued as everyone around her laughed and Tad slung his arm around
her shoulder, muttering `there's our girl' to a response of `here,
here's'.  There wasn't an assignment known to man, that Katie
couldn't blow off with the nonchalance of a true professional.</p>

<p>"I wonder what your old lady's gonna have to say to that?" Russell
asked as he spotted Jessie just across the schoolyard.</p>

<p>Katie looked up just in time to catch Jessie's eyes as she glanced
over at them, and as always was lost for a moment looking at her.
Then she remembered, she remembered being ditched all weekend long,
and she remembered being pissed at being treated like the bad guy for
not wanting to take advantage of the girl she was in love with.  She
remembered to look away, and that's just what she did, turning her
head slightly to side, leaving Jessie staring at the side of her face.</p>

<p>"Whoa, is it just me or did it suddenly just get chilly?" Tad asked
mock shivering as Jessie continued on her way towards the school
after Katie totally turned her back on her.</p>

<p>"Don't," Katie responded darkly turning to face him.  "Just don't."</p>

<hr>

<p><u><i>Manning House . Two days later</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie stared down at her plate before closing her eyes and sighing
deeply, then digging at her eyes tiredly.  "Can I be excused?" she
asked finally not able to take any more sitting around.</p>

<p>"You've barely touched you food," Rick commented upon hearing
Jessie's request.  He didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but
he had noticed that she hadn't been eating much lately, and knew that
with her history it was a big deal.  He'd underestimated things the
first time around and he wasn't going to make the same mistake this
time.</p>

<p>Jessie glanced over at her dad then back down at her plate which she
hadn't touched.  "I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>"You should try and eat a little," Rick said not backing down, making
a mental note to call Karen and see if Jessie was acting the same way
at her house.  If she was falling back into old patterns they were
going to have to talk about what to do.  "It's good."</p>

<p>Jessie was quite for a moment, acutely aware of the silence of the
room, and of the feel of everyone's eyes on her.  Painfully aware of
the fact that everyone at the table was watching her, and knowing
what they must be thinking, that she was relapsing, and their
consequent pitying.  "If you like it so much, why don't you eat it?"
she said finally shoving the plate away from her and jostling the
rest of the dishes on the table.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Lily began feeling the need to mediate before things got
out of hand.  "I could fix you something else if."</p>

<p>"I don't want anything else," Jessie replied crankily.  "I'm NOT
hungry!  What? I'm not allowed to not be hungry like day of the
goddamn year?" she continued flinging herself against the back of her
chair and crossing her arms, indignation her halo.</p>

<p>"That's right," Rick responded.  He'd had about enough of her
attitude, she'd been almost unbearable to live with for the last few
days, constantly snipping and complaining and throwing a temper
tantrum at the slightest provocation.  He'd say it was like living
with a three year old, only she'd been an absolute angel when she was
three.</p>

<p>"What are you gonna do, force-feed me?" Jessie asked snottily looking
over at him with a look that said `deal with it'.  Then when he
didn't respond, she stood up and huffed out of the kitchen, flouncing
up the stairs leaving a very uncomfortable family at the dinner table.</p>

<hr>

<p><u><i>Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie scratched at her notebook as her mind drifted back to school,
and the memory of Katie and Sarah standing together in the hallway
laughing away together merry as could be, then looked back down at
her page scratching carelessly some more.  She'd been trying to find
Katie to apologize, to try and make up, cause she was absolutely
miserable without the other girl around.  But when she'd seen that,
that irrational part of her brain that seemed to be controlling her
more and more lately, took over and got all offended making her huff
away bitterly.</p>

<p>"Is Katie coming over?" Karen asked wandering into the living room
and seeing Jessie working alone.  On Thursday nights, Katie was usual
over there with her working away on whatever it was they were working
on.  It had become somewhat of a routine for them, one Karen actually
enjoyed.  It was nice to have the house filled with sounds, and
laughter and life.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie responded curtly not bothering to look up.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Karen asked thinking that Jessie hadn't been filling the
house with anything other than snideness and dark clouds lately.</p>

<p>"Because we broke up," Jessie responded as if she was discussing the
weather, still not looking up.</p>

<p>Karen looked at her in surprise; she certainly hadn't expected that
one.  Moving further into the room she sat down on the couch.  "Why?"
she asked gently.  She had actually gotten quite attached to the idea
of the two of them together.  Katie was genuinely a nice girl, and
Jessie was so happy when they were together that Karen couldn't help
but see the beauty in their relationship, even if she still worried
for what it would mean to her daughters future.</p>

<p>"Because," Jessie replied peevishly as memories of her disastrous
seduction came back to her.</p>

<p>"That's not much of an answer," Karen pointed out wondering what
could possibly have happened between them.  "Is it?" she continued
trying to coax some more information out of her daughter.</p>

<p>"Fine," Jessie said turning around for the first time since her
mother started talking.  "The real reason we broke up is that she
asked too many questions," she said looking at her mother pointedly.</p>

<p>Karen stared at her for a moment, her expression clearly showing that
she wasn't impressed by her daughter's response, and then she got up
and moved into the other room as Jessie turned back to her paper
ripping it out of her notebook and throwing it to the side.</p>

<p>"She still got that bee up her ass?" Eli asked his mother as she came
into the kitchen.  </p>

<p>"A whole nest from the looks of it," Karen replied shaking her head.</p>

<p>Grace winced as Katie snapped at Miriam Crow, effectively cutting the
girl a new asshole for making the serious mistake of trying to talk
to her.  Poor Miriam, Grace thought to herself.  She was renowned
around school for her cluelessness and it had now come to bite her in
the ass.  While Katie had always been known around the school for her
relative friendliness . thus separating herself in a good way from
the majority of the popular crowd . everyone had realized days ago
that: one, it was best to stay out of Katie's way now and two, dark
bags were not a good look on the dirty blonde.  Everyone that was
except for poor, oblivious Miriam.</p>

<p>"So what are some of the causes of world hunger?" Mrs. Simpson asked
the class, her attention focusing on Katie who was slouched over in
her chair looking barely conscious.  "Ms. Singer?" she asked causing
Katie to look up at her grouchily.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie replied softly without even attempting to look
like she had considered the question before hanging her head back
down and beginning to zone out again when Mrs. Simpson interrupted
her again.</p>

<p>"Surely you must have at least a suggestion," Mrs. Simpson replied.
She didn't understand what was going on with Katie recently, even
though the girl had never really been big on handing in her homework,
she was one of the best students in the class. However, lately she
had been off of her game, so far off of her game that her game was
like a dot to her.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said wearily closing her eyes and wishing the
woman would leave her alone.  "How about your fat ass?" she continued
barely aware of the gasps from the students sitting around her.  </p>

<p>Grace shook her head as she watched Katie slouch out of the
classroom, her first class ticket to the principles office firmly
grasped in her hand.   Grace sighed and turned away from the door as
Katie's figure disappeared, her eyes returning to her notebook as she
wondered what could possibly have gone so wrong between her and
Jessie.  The two of them had been like the perfect couple, almost
sickeningly in love.  To have gone from `I see forever in your eyes'
to whatever kick it was the two of them were on now just didn't make
any sense to Grace, and she figured that that was the problem because
it probably wasn't making any sense to them either.</p>

<p><u><i>Katie's House . Three days later</i></u></p>

<p>"You're mom let me in," Sarah said into the darkness of Katie's
bedroom.  She could hear Billie Holiday playing softly in the
background and could just make out Katie's figure sprawled listlessly
across the bed.</p>

<p>"Great, then she can let you out too," Katie muttered into the
darkness, not moving an inch.  Movement might have indicated some
sort of interest on her part in whatever it was that had brought
Sarah over, and she absolutely didn't want that to happen.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that," Sarah said softly, reaching over to turn on a
nearby lamp.  "The last thing you really want is to be alone," she
continued now able to see Katie, instead of merely a mass on the
bed.  </p>

<p>"Thanks for the analysis Dr. Freud," Katie mumbled sarcastically in
response as she shied away from the light Sarah just turned on.   She
was like a miner who'd been underground for too long suddenly exiting
the shaft, and Sarah wondered how long she'd been lying there in the
dark.  </p>

<p>"Now get outta here," Katie continued oblivious to the look on
concern covering the other girls face.  "Go on, Am Scray," she
continued impatiently, just wanting to be left alone.  She missed
Jessie so much that it was like even breathing took up to much effort
now that her girlfriend wasn't around anymore.  The first couple of
days after the weekend, when she'd started giving Jessie the silent
treatment, had been fine.  She'd had righteous indignation to hold
onto and had truly believed that things would blow over, but now it'd
been a week, and it was like she was dying.  She didn't want to eat,
or talk or do anything.  She was just sad.</p>

<p>Sarah walked over to the bed, the idea of actually leaving Katie
alone not even occurring to her, and sat down on the edge of it
watching Katie sadly.  She looked like shit, just like she had for
day upon days.  This wasn't like Katie she'd never seen the other
girl so upset, it seemed wrong somehow, like it was against nature.
Katie was a person naturally acclimated to the light; the darkness
didn't suit her at all in Sarah's eyes.  She wanted Katie to smile
again, and she wanted to be the one to cause it.  She would bring
back the light.</p>

<p>"You can act as tough as you want, but I'm not leaving," Sarah said
softly.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," Katie muttered covering her head with a pillow so
that she wouldn't have to listen to Sarah's pseudo-psychology new age-
y bullshit anymore.  All she wanted to do was sleep, and brood, and
wallow in self-pity while cursing herself, and she could do all of
that just was well with Sarah there as she could alone. </p>

<hr>

<p>Katie licked the skin beneath her lips, moaning as she felt a hand
begin to slip under her shirt, tracing her skin lightly.  "Jessie,"
she mumbled against the salty skin of the neck her lips were attached
to, pressing soft kisses along it as she felt the hand under her
shirt begin to slip further up.  Jessie, Jessie, Jessie her mind sung
deliriously.</p>

<p>"Jessie," she said again, gasping this time as the hand cupped her
breast massaging it lightly.  "I love you so much," she whispered
reverently pressing herself into the hand that had stopped moving.</p>

<p>The hand began to move again a second later, but the slight
hesitation was enough for the haze surrounding Katie to begin to lift
and for the first time since the touching started she began to become
aware of her surrounding, and the more she did, the more she knew
that something was seriously amiss.  Jessie?</p>

<p>The scent of the body above her was wrong, the hands pressed against
her body weren't nearly delicate enough, the body itself felt larger,
and the hair was too long . and dark.  Then it all started to come
back to her, Sarah showing up uninvited and sitting on the bed, her
ignoring her and trying to go to sleep completely exhausted from all
of the weeks emotional stress, and a dream of Jessie where they
hadn't been fighting and everything was perfect and Jessie was
kissing her.</p>

<p>Katie bucked up violently, dislodging the body on top of her and
rolled off of her bed, standing up and turning around to stare down
at Sarah like she'd never seen her before.  She wanted to start
brushing off her body, or jump into a lake.  Dirty, she felt dirty.</p>

<p>"What the fuck do you think you're doing!?!" Katie whispered harshly,
anger settling in over her now that the shock of the situation had
worn off. </p>

<p>"I didn't do anything," Sarah responded as Katie stalked toward her
and yanked her off the bed.  Ripping her hand out of Katie's grasp
she continued to speak, her voice high and defensive.  "You started
it.  I was just sitting there waiting for you to wake up when you
wrapped yourself around me and started to kiss me," she went on
looking at Katie as she blinked back tears.</p>

<p>"Don't give me that," Kate responded acerbically glaring over that
the other girl.  "You knew I was thinking about her, not you," she
continued accusingly remembering very well what she had said when
Sarah's hand had paused, and that it had paused before she'd tried to
keep on going.  She distinctly remembered saying Jessie's name, so
Sarah had to have heard and decided that it didn't matter that she
was half unconscious and thinking about someone else.</p>

<p>"Come on, Kate," Sarah said realizing that she was in a very
precarious position.  She hadn't intended to start anything with
Katie, at least not like that, and she had tried to resist when Katie
had started to kiss her, she'd really meant to stop it.  But, Katie
had been so tender and passionate, so loving that she couldn't help
but give in.  Nothing she and Katie had shared in the summer and for
those few months in the fall had been anything like what had just
happened, the past had been like a shadow, a whisper in the wind.
She'd been swept up in the magic of it all, the beauty of it, the
purity of emotion, ecstatic at the thought she was sharing this with
Katie.  And then she'd heard Jessie's name fall adoringly from
Katie's lips.  That's when she had realized that Katie didn't even
know who she was with, but by then it had stopped mattering to her
because everything that she had dreamed since that first day Katie
had smiled at her was finally coming true, and even though it wasn't
exactly what she had hoped for it was enough.  It was good enough and
she couldn't stop herself from taking it.  "It wasn't so bad," she
continued imploringly.  "Didn't it feel good?"</p>

<p>Katie paced back away from her towards the back of the room, running
an agitated hand through her hair, before finally turning around to
face Sarah again, to face her for the last time.  "Go.  Now," she
ground out softly, but viscerally, trying valiantly to stop herself
from walking across the room and throttling Sarah were she
stood.  "And don't come back, and don't talk to me. Ever.  Again,"
she finished dropping her head down and turning her back to Sarah.</p>

<p><u><i>Karen's House - Outside</i></u></p>

<p>Katie paced nervously up and down the walkway leading up to Ms.
Sammler's door.  It was just past four in the afternoon and she was
certain that Jessie was in there having seen her mother pick her up
from school an hour earlier.  After the incident with Sarah she'd
spent the rest of the night deep in thought finally realizing how
screwed up she'd gotten since she and Jessie had stopped talking.
>From swearing at teachers and snapping at her friends, to actually
being so out of things that she'd let Sarah get so close to her, it
just had to stop, she knew that she had to talk to Jessie.  She had
to see her, and resolve things one way or the other, because she just
couldn't do this anymore, it was tearing her apart.  </p>

<p>The problem was she scared, absolutely terrified at the prospect of
actually seeing Jessie only to have the other girl tell her to get
lost.  The thought that her misplaced pride might have ended up
costing her the most important person in her life, causing her to
continue pacing, just as she had for the past half hour.</p>

<p>Finally, after nearly wearing a hole in her shoes, Katie stopped
pacing and pushed forward stepping up onto the porch.  Bouncing up on
the balls of her feet and letting out a anxious exhalation of air,
she sucked in a deep breath and extended her hand until her finger
was resting on the smooth white plastic of Karen's doorbell.  Then
clenching her other hand tightly, she closed her eyes and quickly
jabbed at the bell.</p>

<p>Jessie yanked the door open fully preparing to give whoever was at
the door a piece of her mind - especially if it was those stupid
survey people again.  However, she stopped abruptly, her body jerking
to a stop as if she'd run into an invisible wall when she saw that it
was Katie who was standing there.  She suddenly found herself at a
loss for words as she blinked at the sight of her girlfriend.
Katie.  Katie was standing at her door.  Katie.  She couldn't believe
that she was actually there, that she had come to see her.  Katie.</p>

<p>Before Katie could even mumble a lame `hello' she found herself
hurrying to wrap her arms around Jessie who after a momentary bout of
silence and confused blinking had rushed out of the door at her and
into her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh my god, I'm so happy to see you," Jessie mumbled into Katie's
shoulder, not even really certain of the words that were coming out
of her mouth.  "I've missed you so much, and I thought that I'd
totally messed things up, and I should have returned your calls, I
just wanted to apologize to you so much, but every time, I could just
never do it, and I thought that you would never talk to me again,"
she continued to mumble as Katie maneuvered them into the house and
closed the door, which she then leaned against bringing Jessie with
her.</p>

<p>"I could never stop loving you, not in a million years," Katie told
Jessie softly as she stroked her back, blinking rapidly to try and
contain the tears that had been forming in her eyes from the moment
Jessie touched her.  "I shouldn't have taken everything so
personally, I was so stupid, I didn't even see, she totally didn't
change, and I hurt you and that was the last thing I ever wanted to
do," she continued her voice choking in her throat, intense feelings
of self-loathing coursing through her body as she remembered how
very, very wrong she'd been.</p>

<p>Pulling back out of Katie's arms, Jessie looked at her girlfriend,
really looked at her for the first time since recognizing the figure
at the door as her, and literally had to fight the urge to gasp in
shock.  She was alarming pale as if she had been locked in a room for
days, and her eyes were puffy and bloodshot.  Her tall frame was
hunched over tiredly and her face was tightly drawn like she had
forgotten how to relax since the last time they spoke.  It broke
Jessie heart because she knew that she was the one that had done this
to her, she'd taken this amazing person so full of life and energy
and love, and twisted her into a shell of that former self because
she was too scared and insecure to see the truth, or to believe it
when she saw it. </p>

<p>"I'm so sorry I put you through all of this," Jessie managed to choke
out as she reached up to stroke Katie's face, absolutely devastated
by Katie's broken appearance.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be," Katie said shaking her head knowing that Jessie
was blaming herself for whatever had happened, and that that wasn't
the truth.  She had helped the dig the hole, and she had willingly
wallowed in it.  "There's no reason, I mean I did stupid stuff too,"
she continued tears beginning to escape from her eyes.  "Really
stupid things," she went on turning away from Jessie to hide her face.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Jessie asked placing her hand on Katie's arm
encouraging her to turn back around, sensing that whatever was
bothering her was important.  She wasn't just going to let things
slide anymore, she wasn't not going to ask questions anymore because
she was scared of the answer or of what the reaction to them might
be.  She'd kept her fears locked away inside, and her concerns to
herself shutting Katie out of part of her life to disastrous
affects.  She wasn't going to do that again, she didn't think she
could stand it if that happened again.  No, she wasn't going to allow
that to happen again.</p>

<p>"I thought," Katie started fully crying now, "I swear that I thought
it was you," she continued slumping against the wall.  She hadn't
intended to say anything about what had happened with Sarah, she
hadn't wanted to think about it since it gave her the full body
creeps, but she knew that she had to tell Jessie, her conscience
wouldn't let her not tell Jessie.  It would be a lead ball chained to
her leg, weighing her down for all eternity if she didn't tell her,
their reunion founded on a lie and their relationship tainted.  If
they were going to fix things, then they had to be honest, painful as
it may have been she had to place her heart on her sleeve.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," Jessie said wanting to do something to calm
Katie, but not knowing how.  In her dreams, this reunion had had a
lot more kissing and a lot less tears.</p>

<p>"She came over.  Sarah," Katie said trying to get a reign in on her
emotions.  "I was asleep, and I thought that she was you, I was
thinking about you, and then it was like you were there, and I
thought that it was you . and ." Katie continued, her babbling slowly
trailing off when she realized that Jessie's body had stiffened
acutely as she spoke and that she didn't seem to actually be
breathing.</p>

<p>"Did you." Jessie started to ask softly, her hand falling away from
Katie's shoulder and down to her side limply as all of her fears and
nightmares came tumbling through her brain once more.  </p>

<p>"No," Katie said quickly, wanting to reach out for Jessie but not
knowing if the gesture would be appreciated.  "God no," she continued
vehemently shaking her head.  "She kissed me that's all, then I
snapped out of it and kicked her the hell out.  I was just so messed
up," she continued her voice cracking with emotion.  "It just took me
a minute, I really thought it was you.  I swear to God I thought it
was you," she went on softly, her eyes lowering to the ground as her
body started to shiver lightly.</p>

<p>Jessie watched Katie for a moment, torn between her own hurt at
hearing Katie admit that she had kissed Sarah, and knowing without a
doubt from Katie's bearing that it had really been an accident and
that she was probably beating herself up over it more than Jessie
could ever hope to.  She wanted to kill Sarah, she wanted to rip her
limbs from her body and then beat her about the head with them and
then maybe feed them to some wild alligators or something.  She
wanted to run out into the middle of the street and drop to her knees
in an overly dramatic way screaming at the top of her lungs.  She
wanted to, she just wanted to do something to make these ugly
feelings that had been brewing inside of her go away.  She didn't
want to be in pain anymore, she didn't want to be angry anymore.  She
just wanted Katie.  She wanted Katie.</p>

<p>"It's okay," Jessie replied a moment later sensing Katie start to
pull away from her, no doubt agitated by her lengthy silence.  "That
wasn't like on my top list of things to hear before graduation," she
continued ruefully, shaking her head a bit before taking Katie's hand
into her own, "but it's alright."  And though her heart was filled
with a myriad of emotions, from irrational jealously over what had
happened, to an almost insane anger, righteous indignation for what
Sarah had done to Katie, and extreme guilt that she'd played a part
in allowing it to happen, the love she felt for Katie was stronger.
And it washed over her, soothing her other emotions allowing her to
breath, deeply and refreshingly for the first time in weeks.</p>

<p>Katie sighed with relief upon hearing Jessie's words, believing them
and letting them wash over her like holy water, absolving her of her
sin.  When Jessie hadn't said anything for so long, she'd been about
ready to bolt, ready to take her silence as the rightful condemnation
of her actions.  But she wasn't a masochist and when Jessie offered
her forgiveness, even though she doubted she actually deserved it,
she took it.  She reached out for it and clutched it to her chest
until her knuckles were white, because she needed this; she needed
Jessie, because the blonde was elemental.  She made the flowers grow
and birds sing.</p>

<p>So, finally she looked over at her girlfriend, really seeing her for
the first time since the door opened.  She gazed into those blue eyes
that were watching her so carefully, lovingly, shinning with unshed
tears and exuding concern, and she felt like she was home.  She felt
a peace deep within her that made her close her eyes and breathe in
deeply to try and absorb the splendor of it all.</p>

<p>"You're beautiful," Katie finally exhaled absolutely astounded by the
magnificence that was Jessie.</p>

<p>"No I'm not," Jessie said glancing down at her ratty clothes, and
knowing from previous days experience that her skin was probably
blotchy and pale, and she probably had bags under eyes and looked
like she hadn't slept in days.</p>

<p>"You're breathtaking," Katie said a warm smile spreading across her
face.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled at the expression on Katie's face and ducked her head
down self-consciously not knowing how anyone could look at her with
such adoration, but loving it at the same time.  "If you keep this
up, I'm never going to wear anything but track pants again," Jessie
commented shyly looking up at Katie.  She remembered this feeling,
this excitement, it was happiness and she spelled it K-a-t-i -e.</p>

<p>"That's fine," Katie replied thinking that Jessie would look
ravishing in a burlap sack or large paper bag.</p>

<p>"Even if they're the ones with the racing stripe down the side, and
pictures of the Ninja Turtles on them?" Jessie asked playfully as she
found herself unconsciously migrating towards the warmth of Katie's
body.  She hadn't even realized how much she'd missed the feeling of
Katie's arms wrapped around her until she was almost in them again.</p>

<p>Katie looked at her in mock horror upon hearing that and shook her
head.  "You're right," she said.  "We can't have that.  You look
absolutely horrible!  Street urchin is definitely not the look for
you." </p>

<p>Jessie smiled throwing herself into Katie's arms sighing as her
girlfriend encased her in a tight embrace.  "I've got some blonde
jokes too," Katie mumbled into the top of Jessie's head, inhaling the
scent of her hair as Jessie snuggled in closer.  "And I could force
myself into talking about your momma," she continued smiling as she
felt Jessie's lips press against the skin of her neck.  She sighed to
herself contentedly, Hallmark had lied you absolutely didn't need to
say it like them.  </p>

<p><u><i>Manning House . Later that Week</i></u></p>

<p>Lily sighed as she walked in the front door, happy to finally be home
after a long day.  Then just as she finished hanging up her jacket,
she heard a loud bang in the kitchen and looked over questioningly.
Things were quiet for a moment, and then she heard another sound and
pinched the bridge of her nose wondering what was going on before
finally heading towards the source of the disturbance.</p>

<p>Lily stopped dead in her tracks as she got her first good look at the
kitchen.  It looked like bomb had gone off, causing everything that
had been in the cupboards and fridge to explode outwards covering the
kitchen in heaps of everything.</p>

<p>"We're making dinner."  Lily looked up, the sound of Jessie's voice
snapping her out of her haze.  Following the sound of her voice she
saw Jessie grinning at her, while Katie nodded along gamely beside
her.</p>

<p>"It's a bit more complicated that `BAM!' though," Katie, added a
moment later shaking her head thoughtfully, before looking over at
Jessie, who promptly looked over at her, causing the two of them to
look at each other for a few seconds before breaking out laughing.</p>

<p>"That's nice," Lily, responded trying not to hyperventilate as she
surveyed the damage and tried to ignore the giggling girls.  "What're
you making?" she asked trying to accentuate the positive.  Jessie was
smiling, Katie was smiling, they were smiling, and smiling was
definitely preferable to glaring and temper tantrums.</p>

<p>"Pizza."</p>

<p>"Chicken."</p>

<p>Jessie and Katie then turned to look at each other in surprise,
staring hard at each other for a moment before turning back to Lily.</p>

<p>"Chicken pizza," they said simultaneously nodding at her as if to
indicate that they had it all under control.</p>

<p>Lily smiled and wandered out of the kitchen wondering if Zoë still
had her paper bag from lunch.</p>

<p><u><i>Manning House . Three weeks later</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie watched from her peeping spot just inside the kitchen door,
Katie shift around on the couch uncomfortably before finally coming
to a stop upon which she dubiously looked over to her side where Rick
was seated.  "I really don't know much about." she started to say,
trying to subtly worm her out of spending quality time with him, but
before she could finish she was interrupted.</p>

<p>"That's alright," Rick responded with a friendly smile.  "Just think,
this is the last time you're going to be able to say that," he
continued as the sportscasters began to speak and the golfers took to
the green.</p>

<p>Katie slumped back against the back of the couch, resigned to an
evening of bonding with Mr. Sammler.  For weeks before she had Jessie
had split he'd been trying to corner her and bond with her, and she'd
managed to avoid him but he caught her this evening.  Oh well, such
was the price of love.</p>

<p>"You have to make him stop," Jessie said with authority marching up
to Lily as she walked away from the door.  Lily, Grace and Zoë were
puttering around fixing dessert which was all well and good, but Lily
really had more important things to be doing, like getting her dad to
stop torturing her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Lily asked looking over at Jessie, wondering what had
the child so agitated this time.</p>

<p>"He's trying to tell her about 5 irons," Jessie responded clutching
at Lily's arm.  "She doesn't care about 5 irons.  NOBODY cares about
5 irons," she went on her arms waving wildly.  "You have to make him
stop," she finished pleadingly, doe like eyes gazing up at Lily
imploringly.  </p>

<p>"He's trying to bond with her," Lily replied smiling down at
Jessie.  "He's taking an interest.  That's sweet, isn't it?" she
asked wishing that her parents had tried to get along with the boys
she'd dated, instead of merely threatening them and then peeping
through the curtains to make sure no funny stuff was going on.  What
Rick was trying to do was much healthier.</p>

<p>"I think it's sweet," Grace piped in from over by the sink simply
because she knew it would piss Jessie off.  Because despite their
friendlier status, pissing off Jessie was still like one of the best
ways to spend her quality time, especially if she could get the girl
to gape.  Her guppy face was just priceless.</p>

<p>"Me too," Zoë agreed for no other reason than the fact that when she
agreed with Grace for no reason it bothered her sister immensely, and
that was always good for at least five or ten minutes of
entertainment.  </p>

<p>Jessie responded by glaring at both of them for a good ten seconds .
so that they realized that she was truly unimpressed with their
improve routine . and then returned her attention to Lily intending
to begin pleading again.  However, her glaring had apparently given
Grace enough time to find two more cents that she just simply had to
share with them all.  </p>

<p>"I mean it's not like they can talk about clothes and make-up," Grace
said smiling over at Jessie, crossing her mental fingers as she
waited for the guppy face, her smile fading into a shrug when Jessie
simply glared at her once more. </p>

<p>"Eli!" Jessie exclaimed happily, finally breaking eye contact with
Grace and flinging herself at her brother when he walked in the
door.  "You've gotta take dad somewhere," she continued disentangling
herself from around his neck.  "Shot hoops with him or something.
You've gotta get him out of the living room, Eli," she continued
grasping his hand and attempting to drag him into the living room.</p>

<p>"He's in there with Katie isn't he?" Eli asked looking at the rest of
the people assembled in the room, not budging despite Jessie's best
efforts.  They all nodded.  "Golf?" he asked.  Once again, a series
of solemn nods followed.  "Poor girl," he replied.  "I'll be in my
room."</p>

<p>"Eli!" Jessie whined.</p>

<p>"It's his way," Eli responded turning around.  "Jennifer had to watch
Monday night football with him, and Carla got the XFL.  This is what
it means to be a Sammler and have a girlfriend.  Deal with it," he
continued a smile spreading across his face as he finished.  He still
found it highly amusing that Jessie was dating a girl, a hot girl, a
hot older girl no less.  Then he turned back around and continued
merrily on his way.</p>

<p>Jessie glared at his back for a good twenty seconds, and then turned
back around and glared at the rest of the occupants of the room for
good measure, before finally returning to her peeping spot to see how
things were progressing in the other room.</p>

<p>"So the lower your number is, the better," Rick said pointing to the
spread at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie said in response, it was a simple enough concept to
grasp.  "But what's with the buggies?" </p>

<p>"They're not buggies," Rick replied looking over at the girl.

"They look like go-carts for senior citizens," Katie insisted meeting
his gaze, interested in the conversation for the first time since
she'd sat down.  She wasn't sure, but it looked like his eyes were
twitching.  It was kind of gross but also rather compelling.</p>

<p>"They're golf carts.  Not buggies, not go-carts.  Golf carts.  For
golfing," Rick replied straightening his back authoritatively while
trying to resist the urge to shake his finger at her to drive his
point home.</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie agreed once more.  "But what's the point of them?  I
thought this was a sport," she continued sarcastically.</p>

<p>"It is a sport," Rick replied gaping at her, astonished that she
would even imply that it wasn't.  It was lunacy, pure and simple.
Jessie was obviously dating a head case. </p>

<p>"Not much of a sport," Katie mumbled leaning back against the back of
the couch folding her arms across her chest.  "Basketball's a sport,"
she continued.  "Tennis is a sport.  Golf is like Sport's drunk
cousin that needs to be propped up to go to the bathroom," she
finished.</p>

<p>"Golf," Rick responded, "requires a great deal of skill and
precision," he continued defensively as he leaned back as well trying
to seem relaxed, but not at all succeeding.</p>

<p>"So does model building," Katie replied absently.  "It's not a sport."</p>

<p>"Well model building isn't on the sports network is it?" Rick asked
pointedly nodding at the screen.</p>

<p>"They play Magnum P.I. on A&E and that can't be considered either art
or entertainment," Katie responded while silently cursing the
eighties for its advocation of short-shorts for all.</p>

<p>"Golf is a sport," Rick replied somewhat militantly.  He liked Magnum
P.I.</p>

<p>"If you say so Mr. Sammler," Katie said conciliatorily.  She hated it
when old people got sulky.  It was just sad.</p>

<p>"I do," he responded, still not pleased that she seemed to be
humoring him instead of having actually seen the light.</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie said again, causing Rick to tense.  He was beginning
to dread the word `alright' when it came out of this girl's
mouth.  "What's with the eunuch?</p>

<p>"Eunuch?" Rick asked, wondering if he had been right about her being
on drugs.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you know the guy carrying the bag," Katie explained waving her
hand in the general direction of the screen.</p>

<p>"They're caddies, not eunuchs," Rick replied shooting her a
disgruntled look.  Katie smirked, so that's where Jessie got it from.</p>

<p>"Not much of a difference from where I'm sitting," she replied.</p>

<p>"They're a vital part of the game, invaluable to the golfers really,"
Rick tried to explain.</p>

<p>"Like the buggies?" Katie asked looking over at him.  Rick sighed, he
should have just let Zoë take her upstairs for a riveting game of Zoo
Tycoon, he really should have.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled and turned to head back into the kitchen.  She was
actually beginning to feel somewhat sorry for her dad.  He was
obviously way out of his league.</p>

<p><u><i>Karen's House . A Lazy Mid-Summer Afternoon</i></u></p>

<p>"You're quiet," Jessie said as they walked into her room.  They had
been hanging out at Booklovers torturing Judy and scamming free
caffeine, but that had gotten boring . alright they'd gotten kicked
out . so they'd been forced to find something more productive to do
with their time.  Which meant hanging out a Jessie's house, and most
likely watching Jenny Jones.  Yes, summer vacation had arrived and it
was good.</p>

<p>"I guess I am," Katie agreed a moment later after pausing to consider
Jessie's statement for a moment.  "Hmmm.  Apparently I am capable of
being serious, every now and then," she continued unperturbed.</p>

<p>"What's to be serious about?" Jessie asked hovering by her lamp
debating whether or not to turn it on before finally deciding not
to.  There was enough light streaming into the room through the
curtains that they could see each other, and she kind of liked the
romantic mood the darkened surroundings created.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said turning towards her looking somewhat
confused.  "It just feels like a serious time I suppose.  Not a bad
serious," she continued calmly as Jessie moved towards her, looking
at her keenly.  "Just like an attitude of respect is required or
something."</p>

<p>"That's okay," Jessie breathed out softly, "I like serious on you,"
she continued raising her hand to stroke Katie's check lightly.  "You
look so calm.  It's beautiful."</p>

<p>"Hmph," Katie exhaled softly, her lips curving up in a little smile
as she tilted her head down slightly.</p>

<p>"Have I finally embarrassed you?" Jessie asked happily, a smile
spreading across her features too as she looked at her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Not embarrassed," Katie replied tilting her head back up to look at
Jessie, her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"Then what?" Jessie asked softly as Katie continued to stare at her
thoughtfully yet blissfully.</p>

<p>"More like astounded," Katie breathed out finally, her lips twitching
slightly.  "All the time, every time, whenever I'm around you," she
continued now smiling as she regarded Jessie.</p>

<p>"Why?" Jessie asked unable to tear her eyes away from Katie's starkly
intimate gaze.</p>

<p>"Because I love you," Katie responded her eyes holding Jessie's for a
moment, and it was really as simple as that.  "And that's a very
astounding thing."</p>

<p>Jessie regarded her for a minute after that, taking in the blissful
look on her girlfriend's flawless face, and smiled herself.  Then
slowly yet without hesitation leaned forward and brought her lips to
Katie's, pressing their bodies together as her hands came to rest on
the side of her face.  And then she ran her tongue along Katie's lips
tracing and tasting them, before moving to kiss her way along Katie's
jaw-line and then down to her neck where her tongue snuck out and
licked a path up to lips that she never, ever wanted to stop kissing.</p>

<p>Katie watched as Jessie stepped back, her girlfriend's hands falling
to her waist and resting there as she watched her.  "It's quiet in
here," she said softly, as if she had just suddenly become aware of
the silence in the house.</p>

<p>"We're the only ones here," Jessie replied still watching her, her
hands slowly slipping underneath the material of Katie's tank top,
her thumbs brushing against the smooth, warm skin she found
underneath, teasing it with soft, gentle strokes.</p>

<p>"I knew that," Katie replied, acutely aware of the feel of Jessie's
hands on her stomach but nonetheless keeping her eyes on her
girlfriends face, studying her, instead of looking down.  "I was just
saying."</p>

<p>Jessie nodded absently, then began to push the material of Katie's
tank top up, leisurely, revealing more and more of her girlfriend's
skin, her eyes trained intently on the now exposed flesh.  </p>

<p>"Can I?" she asked softly a moment later, her eyebrow quirking up
slightly as she looked up at Katie.  She had pushed the material up
to the point where the only thing left to do was take the top off.</p>

<p>Katie regarded her for a second, then simply nodded before lifting up
her arms to allow Jessie to pull the top up and off of her, leaving
her standing there in only her bra and cream capri pants.  </p>

<p>As she stood there she became highly aware of the rise and fall of
her chest that accompanied her every breath, and she could sense
Jessie's eyes on her in the very marrow of her bones as the blonde
stood there watching her breathe, raking her eyes over her.  And, she
was extremely aware of the way the air was caressing her skin and the
pleasant chills it caused to ripple throughout her body.</p>

<p>And then Jessie's lips were on hers once more, and her own hands
enthusiastically trailed their way up Jessie's sides, brushing across
the front of her chest, before slipping around to her back and coming
to rest on the blonde's hips as they broke apart, their breathing
ragged and uneven.  She fingered the thin material of Jessie's shirt
meditatively, and then wrapped her arms around Jessie's waist
dragging the girl back into her.   With that taken care of she then
returned her lips Jessie's, kissing her ardently as Jessie moved her
hand to cover Katie's drawing both of their hands under her shirt and
upwards.</p>

<p>With Jessie's hand over hers, keeping it firmly in place Katie
brushed her thumb across the material of Jessie's bra, her breath
hitching in her throat as she saw Jessie's mouth open and heard a
soft moan escape from the blonde's slightly parted lips.  Swaying
closer, intoxicated by Jessie, she rested her head against her
girlfriend's forehead and moved her thumb again, inhaling sharply as
Jessie attached her lips to her neck, sucking and licking at the skin
of her neck desperately as she pressed forward into Katie's hand.</p>

<p>Pulling back slightly when Katie's hand stilled, Jessie looked up at
her, her eyes stormy but focused.  "Come on," she said quietly, her
fingers hooking into the tabs of Katie's pants as she began to drag
her towards the bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>"You're quiet," Jessie whispered her eyes focused on her finger as
she trailed it down along Katie's naked torso, carelessly drawing
shapes on Katie's damp skin as she listened to her girlfriend's now
rhythmic breathing.</p>

<p>"Uh," followed by a deep breath was Katie's response.  Jessie smiled
and turned her head up to look at Katie's face.  She was staring at
the ceiling, and hadn't formed a full word in over five minutes.  </p>

<p>Jessie shifted upwards, and rested her head on Katie's shoulder,
drawing the sheet up around them before draping her arm across her
girlfriend's body.  There were no words to describe what she was
feeling, she hadn't even been aware previously that there were
feelings comparable to what she was feeling.  She felt so real, like
she was aware of every atom in her body, every electron and proton
and shooting about, like for the first time she was truly aware of
her body, of herself.  And at the same time she felt like she was in
a dream, painted with watercolours that were dripping warmly around
her covering her in their dreamy colours, like this world was too
perfect to actually exist.</p>

<p>"Billie," Katie said softly, her voice bringing Jessie out of her
reflections.  "I think I've gone stupid," she continued, not sounding
terribly concerned about it, as she felt Jessie shift to look up at
her.</p>

<p>"What're you talking about?" Jessie asked looking over at Katie as
she blinked up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I can't," Katie started.  "My mind just won't .work.  It's like when
I broke my arm and the doctor put me on morphine only he gave me too
much.  I feel like that, only better.  And.more tingly," she
continued, highly and pleasantly aware of the feel of Jessie's bare
skin pressed against the side of her body and the excited feeling it
caused inside of her.</p>

<p>"Are you saying I'm like a drug?" Jessie asked leaning over and
pressing a chaste kiss to Katie's cheek, completely in awe of Katie's
reaction to what they had just shared.</p>

<p>"No," Katie breathed out softly, looking up into Jessie's
eyes.  "Drugs should like be totally jealous of you.  There's some
Columbian cocaine huddled in the corner of a bathroom crying it's
eyes out right now," she continued, her eyes closing as a smile
spread across her face.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Jessie mumbled in response before burying her head in the
crook of Katie's neck and drawing her arms around the other girl even
tighter.  "I love you," she continued feeling Katie kiss to top of
her head.</p>

<p>"I love you too," Katie, replied her eyes drifting back to the
ceiling dreamily.  "I love you times infinity," she declared.</p>

<p>"I love you times infinity plus one," Jessie whispered softly kissing
Katie's collarbone.</p>

<p>"Dammit," Katie exclaimed, a smile spreading across her face.  She
always forgot about the plus one, Jessie always beat her with the
plus one.</p>

<p>"You're funny," Jessie mumbled, her hand tracing the side of Katie's
torso absently, marveling at the feel of her skin.</p>

<p>"You think so huh?" Katie replied looking down at the top of Jessie's
head.  "You wanna know what's really funny?"</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked knowing that Katie was going to say something
completely stupid and that she was going to find it highly amusing
anyway, cause that was just the way things worked.</p>

<p>"The Sandra Bernhard Experience," Katie replied.  "Why'd they cancel
that?" </p>

<p>"You know," Jessie replied, trying not to laugh.  "I think I liked it
better when you were speechless," she continued laying her head back
down on Katie's shoulder blissfully.  </p>

<p>"Goodnight Tad," Katie said with a touch of exasperation as she
removed her head from where he had been holding it under his
arm.  "And," she said rushing down the steps, trying to smooth her
hair back down before he could grab her again, "as for the . ah,
stain.  Try baking soda," she continued grinning up at him before
Jessie grasped her hand leading her away from the house before he
could respond.</p>

<p>Despite the late hour it remained pleasantly warm outside as they
made their way through the darkened streets towards the Singer
residence, the faint voices of the other kids exiting Tad's house the
only sound around them as they walked the peaceful suburban streets.</p>

<p>"So," Katie started, her head tipping up to observe the stars above
them.  "What do you think is going to happen tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at her, smiling softly before tilting her head up
as well.  "I have absolutely no idea," she breathed out, closing her
eyes as a warm breeze rushed past her.</p>

<p>"I know one thing," Katie said dropping her gaze down and turning her
head to look at Jessie.  "We," she continued, halting her movement
and spinning around so that she was standing just in front of
Jessie.  "Will be together," she went on softly, pirouetting Jessie
and then wrapping her arms around her waist.</p>

<p>"Then I know something too," Jessie replied, smiling as Katie pressed
a kiss into the crook of her neck, hugging them together in the
process.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Katie asked moving back beside Jessie so they could
continue their walk.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow's going to be a good day," Jessie replied glancing down at
their joined hands before looking back up at the road ahead of them,
a great smile settling across her features as she anxiously awaited
dawn.</p>
