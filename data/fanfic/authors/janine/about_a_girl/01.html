<p>"What's going on?" Grace asked wandering into the kitchen. Everyone was gathered around the counter not saying anything, simply starring at the table where Jessie alone seemed to be seated.</p>

<p>"Lily's trying to figure out if that was really cold medication she bought for Jessie yesterday," Eli whispered, his eyes never leaving his sisters back for a second.</p>

<p>"Jessie thinks eggs is a funny word," Zoë added from somewhere beneath Grace's right elbow. "She said so, but she's still eating them." Grace looked down at her little sister sighing internally to see that the child had that blasted placemat on her head again, only this time neither her mom or Rick seemed notoriously concerned about it.</p>

<p>"You don't think we should call someone do you?" Rick asked scrunching up his brow in concern.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Grace laughed looking at all of them like they were insane. "Can't she just be in a good mood?" she asked shaking her head before heading for the fridge. "Hey," she greeted looking at Jessie briefly before reaching for the orange juice container.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie responding shooting her a grin before turning back around and bringing her fork down to her plate, seemingly surprised to find it empty. Now intrigued, Grace watched as her stepsister shook her head and smiled with a `stupid me' expression, then got up, dumping her plate in the sink and headed out of the kitchen. But not before looking at everyone like they were pod people when they moved out of her way collectively. Grace smiled again and turned her attention back to the fridge. It wasn't the medication Lily had bought that was making Jessie act that way, she was sure of it. She doubted that Jessie was actually ever feeling sick to begin with, and if she had been, she'd certainly been fine when she'd gone up to the attic yesterday to deliver the medication, only to find Jessie and Katie standing around self-consciously but happily looking at her like they'd never seen her before. Then later, as she'd gone to leave the attic she'd looked back to find Jessie sprawled out on her bed looking up at the ceiling with a blissed out expression on her face, and she knew instinctively what must have happened between her and Katie.</p>

<p>"What did the warning label say?" Rick asked turning to look at Lily once Jessie had left the room.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Grace grumbled again rolling her eyes as she sat down at the table. She didn't know if she could take a whole day of this.</p>

<p><u><i>Hospital Parking Lot</i></u></p>

<p>Karen looked back at Eli sharing a brief smile with him as they watched Jessie bound off into the distance in search of the car. As Eli wheeled her out of the hospital, Jessie had run off saying she was going to prepare the car, because while Eli hadn't actually been raised in a barn, he lived like he had been.</p>

<p>"At least you didn't have to sit through her monologue on the beauty of butterflies," Eli grumbled good naturedly before tipping his mother's wheelchair back and running with it momentarily, stopping only when Karen begged him to stop. The action had earned him a slap on the arm, but also a smile, so he figured it all evened out in the end. "I swear it was like she'd never been outdoors before," he continued watching as Jessie's head disappeared behind a van a couple yards ahead of them. "And at breakfast, she actually let that little Hobbit cut her food into the shape of a bunny rabbit!"</p>

<p>"Hobbit?" Karen asked turning in her chair slightly. "Who's a Hobbit?"</p>

<p>"Zoë," Eli responded adjusting their course a bit as he spotted the car. "And before you get mad, Jessie's the one that called her that first."</p>

<p>"Why?" Karen asked bewildered.</p>

<p>"The kid used her favorite pair of socks to make a puppet," Eli responded grinning. "To this day ... well maybe not today," he amended, "She stomps out of the room whenever Mr. Buckley Buttonpants of Zoë's third drawer makes an appearance."</p>

<p>Karen smiled, soaking up this relaxing moment with her son, like it was the first day you could outside without a jacket after a long winter. Things had been so strained between them for the past little while, that it was nice to just be able to talk to him, and have him talk to her.</p>

<p>"She's in a good mood," Karen said softly a moment later, watching as Jessie threw some article of clothing out of the backseat and into the trunk.</p>

<p>"HEY! BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE!" Eli bellowed at the top of his lungs as Jessie began to fling some music sheets carelessly into the trunk. "Hey!" he yelled again, when she looked up at him then went back to what she had been doing.</p>

<p>"Eli, please," Karen said wincing as his voice reverberated in her ears.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said realizing what he had been doing. "It's just that we need those for practice tomorrow," he continued glaring at Jessie as he quickened his step.</p>

<p>"Did anything happen last night?" Karen asked sending him a reproachful look that caused him to slow down once again. He sighed; he was never going to be able to find the sheets he needed tomorrow.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked absently.</p>

<p>"Jessie, she seemed really upset the other day when she came by to see me," Karen responded. "But...she seems better now. Better than for a long while now," she continued softly.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Eli said thinking back. "I don't know ... that hot chick she's been hanging out with came by...that's about it."</p>

<p>"Eli," Karen said stretching out her sons name with distaste. "Katie's 15," she continued looking back at him. Eli shrugged. "You're sure that's it?" Karen asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli responded. "After that she pretty much spent the whole night in her room listening to that CD she's got from prohibition times, or whatever," he continued making a face.</p>

<p>"Billie Holiday," Karen corrected gently. Prohibition times, Karen thought to herself, good grief.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's what I said," Eli responded finally bringing them to a stop beside the car.</p>

<p>"Said about what?" Jessie asked her head popping up to look at them from across the car.</p>

<p>"You're boyfriend Taaaaaaaad," Eli responded mockingly, making kiss-y faces before pretending to swoon.</p>

<p>"He's not my boyfriend," Jessie responded glaring at her brother, before ducking her head back into the car to toss the last of his crap into the trunk.</p>

<p>"'Oh Tad, I love you and you're gay porn sounding name'," Eli said in response, his voice rising in a crude attempt to mimic Jessie's voice. He was bitter about the treatment she had just given his `Sex Machine' t-shirt.</p>

<p>"Eli," Karen started, really not wanting to listen to two of them argue the whole way home, but before she could get anything else out, Jessie's head popped up again interrupting her.</p>

<p>"How would you know?" she asked, her eyebrow rising challengingly.</p>

<p>"Know what?" Eli asked not really liking the expression on her face. Jessie may have been younger than him, but when she wanted to she could rip anyone a new asshole. He clenched beginning to think that he should have listened to his mother.</p>

<p>"What his name sounds like," Jessie explained. "Been watching a lot of gay porn lately?" she asked grinning at him.</p>

<p>"Alright," Karen said holding up her hands, cutting Eli off before he could respond. "That's enough. Both of you behave." Both of them stared at her for a moment, looking like they wanted to object, then muttered that they would, and set about preparing the car for her. Karen smiled; it was good to be back.</p>

<hr>

<p><u><i>School</i></u></p>

<p>"No, they sucked," Katie, stated emphatically. "No. No they sucked."</p>

<p>"You're just bitter because Acoustic Soul got shot down like a cougar at the Playboy mansion," Tad responded happily as Russell slapped him on the back.</p>

<p>"Just because you inherited your dad's taste from like the 70s it doesn't mean all of us have light candles at the Shrine of Bono," Katie responded shooting Tad a nasty sideways look. The truth was she was bitter that Acoustic Soul got shut out. "Besides, it was soooo long. I mean what time did it end, like 2 am? In corrupt prisons across the world they're torturing people with Jon Stewart's striptease."</p>

<p>"I thought that was funny man," Russell starting to laugh. "He was all...and then it was like..." he went on almost doubling over from the effort it was taking for him to hold in his girlish giggles.</p>

<p>Katie rolled her eyes, and turned away from the two guys letting her eyes scan the hallways. Catching sight of a familiar face, she broke out into a huge grin, which she then rather conspicuous covered.</p>

<p>"I'll catch up with you later," she called out already heading down the hall.</p>

<p>"Hey," Tad called out. "Are you coming tonight," he asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Katie called back almost out of earshot. Then she held up her hand making the `I'll call you' hand motion and disappeared down the next hallway.</p>

<p> "Alright, meet me outside of the gym after school and I'll give you a lift," Grace said with a long-suffering sigh as she checked her watch.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Jessie responded choosing to ignore Grace's tone. Sometimes with Grace it was best to do that.</p>

<p>"Looks like you've got a visitor," Grace commented a moment later, her previous sulky tone now gone.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked looking up. "Oh," she continued seeing Katie propped up against a wall near her locker, seemingly reading a nearby poster. "Right. Okay, I'll see you later," Jessie responded trying to subtly shoo Grace away.</p>

<p>"Riiiight," Grace responded. "Later," and with that she continued on down the hallway smiling. Jessie was sooo busted.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie said coming up behind Katie. "What cha looking at?"</p>

<p>"Intramural floor hockey," Katie responded cocking her head towards the poster and sign up sheet.</p>

<p>"You thinking of joining?" Jessie asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"No. I like my teeth in my mouth," Katie responded, her hands brushing down over her skirt shakily before she finally turned to look at Jessie. "So, the world of academia is glad to have you back," she continued as they headed towards Jessie's locker.</p>

<p>"The feelings mutual," Jessie responded turning her lock slowly. She seemed to be having trouble remembering her combination. "Oh, and tell academia's mom thanks. The cookies she baked were breakfast this morning," Jessie continued knowingly.</p>

<p>"Busted, huh?" Katie asked, leaning against a nearby locker.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was a valiant effort," Jessie responded smiling. "It's good to see you," she continued, her voice dropping a little as she raised her eyes to meet Katie's.</p>

<p>"It's good to be seen," the girl responded, smiling softly, before turning her head to watch the passing students. "So ... you wanna do something later? I have extensive ideas about how to waste time. There may even be a flow chart but I can't remember if I got around to it," she continued glancing at Jessie. They had talked on the phone over the weekend, but hadn't actually seen each other since that afternoon in the attic. And as ecstatic as she was over what had happened in Jessie's bedroom that day, she wasn't sure where they stood exactly. She knew where she wanted to be standing, but it was up to Jessie.</p>

<p>"I told my mom I'd come straight home," Jessie replied closing her locker door. "There's still a lot of stuff to get back in order, I mean the mail pile alone was like a week's worth of work," she continued turning to face Katie.</p>

<p>"Yeah, of course," Katie responded. "Totally. I completely understand," she responded, her shoes suddenly seeming very interesting.</p>

<p>"You should come," Jessie said seeing Katie's expression and knowing what was probably going through her head. "She keeps asking about you anyway. Katie this and Katie that ... I swear it's like she wants to marry you or something," she continued smiling at the memory of her mother incessantly questioning her about Katie.</p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked looking over at Jessie.</p>

<p>"Yeah, apparently I talk about you a lot," Jessie, responded shaking her head self-consciously. "You don't have to, I mean it's probably not going to be a lot of fun. She'll probably have us stocking cupboards or dusting something, but..."</p>

<p>"I'll come," Katie said interrupting her. "I mean, I'd like to go with you. We can do the whole underage illegal worker thing together."</p>

<p>"Cool," Jessie responded smiling, as she adopted a position similar to Katie's against the locker.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie agreed a wide grin spreading across her face. "So, you tired of lounging yet?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said pushing off of the lockers. "How do the jocks do it?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows," Katie responded heading down the hall. "But I suspect it has something to do with the numerous blows to the head. That just can't be healthy. Also, it's not very pretty."</p>

<p>"The real reason floor hockey is out?" Jessie asked gamely.</p>

<p>"I stand by my decision," Katie responded grasping Jessie's hand momentarily, letting go as they turned the corner. "My stop," she said glancing at the classroom door.</p>

<p>"Lunch?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"Well, that's right around the time I get hungry so you're in luck," Katie replied smiling. "I..." she started to say, looking at Jessie seriously. "Yeah," she continued shaking her head, "I'll see you then."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said holding her eyes for a second longer. Then she continued down the hall, smiling once she was out of sight. Lunch never seemed so far away.</p>

<p><u><i>Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>"Oh my god," Katie exclaimed flinging herself on Jessie's bed as  Jessie closed the door to her room.  "I thought you were joking about  the packing and dusting and stuff!  I haven't worked that hard since  dad made us help build crazy uncle Cory's cottage slash whacked out  bomb shelter!"</p>

<p>"Bomb shelter?" Jessie asked raising an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"That's why we call him `crazy' uncle Cory," Katie responded flipping  around onto her back so that she could see Jessie.  "He once ate  nothing but baked beans for like eight months.  He wasn't allowed to  come over for holiday dinners during that period," she continued  sitting up as Jessie walked over to the bed.</p>

<p>"That's a lovely story," Jessie said making a face coming to stop  just in front of Katie.  "I'm surprised that it isn't told every  Christmas with people gathered around the fireplace holding hands and  stuff."</p>

<p>"Mock him if you will," Katie responded with a pseudo  sigh.  "Really.  Everyone else does," she continued grinning up at  Jessie cheekily, her smile slowly fading away to be replaced by  questioning head tilt as she realized just how close to her Jessie  was standing.  "Hey," she continued a moment later, swallowing  heavily as her eyes traveled up Jessie's torso, settling on her lips  for a moment before moving up further to her eyes, which were  watching her closely.</p>

<p>"I want…" Jessie began slowly, clearly annunciating every syllable.</p>

<p>"I know," Katie responded holding her gaze.  "It's okay," she  continued.  "It's always okay."</p>

<p>And before she could say anything else, she felt Jessie's lips on  hers, brushing against her own gently, then with an increasing  firmness as she got swept up in the tide, pulling away only when the  need for oxygen became too great to ignore.</p>

<p>"It's different when I'm taller than you," Jessie commented softly as  she looked down at Katie's seated figure.  A wickedly delicious smile  creeping across her features as the euphoria hit her.  "I like being  tall."</p>

<p>"Certainly it has its advantages," Katie responded hers lips turning  upwards at well, her reply both teasing and relieved.  "But there's  something to be said for the view from Midget Town too."</p>

<p>"Midget Town?" Jessie asked, her eyes narrowing menacingly.  So she  was going to start with the short jokes was she?  Not a good move.</p>

<p>"Is Dopey coming by today, he's got my copy of `It's a small world  after all'," Katie answered immediately, her smile growing wider at  Jessie's expression.  God, she was so cute, like when she did  anything.  All Jessie had to do was make an expression and it was  like the best thing she'd ever seen.</p>

<p>"You are in *so* much trouble," Jessie ground out staring a Katie for  a moment, before laughing as she flung herself at Katie, causing the  other girl to fall back against the bed, as Jessie landed on top of  her, rolling them over, causing her laugh even harder as Katie began  to tickle her.</p>

<hr>

<p>"What are you doing?" Jessie asked looking down as Katie picked up  her hand in hers.  They were sitting across from each other cross- legged on the floor.  At first they had been talking, about stupid  things, about anything, but then they'd just kind of stopped and  started looking at each other.  For a long time.  Then Katie had  reached out her hand and picked up Jessie's.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Katie responded as she cradled Jessie's hand in her  left one, and then began tracing the lines of Jessie's hand with one  of the fingers of her right hand slowly.  "Wait," Katie continued a  moment later.  "I know now."</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked, her breath coming out surprisingly short.  She  had stopped concentrating for a moment, and now it seemed as if she'd  forgotten how to breathe.</p>

<p>"Learning," Katie said softly, her head tilting up momentarily to  gaze at Jessie.  "You're hands are so soft…delicate," she whispered  softly, almost as if she were in a trance.  "Beautiful," she  continued her eyes dropping back down to Jessie's palm.  "Like you."</p>

<p>"You…you think I'm beautiful?" Jessie asked a moment later, her voice  halting with uncertainty as her eyes dropped down to their joined  hands.</p>

<p>"No," Katie responded gazing over at her without a moment's  hesitation.  Jessie looked up at her questioningly, confused, but  Katie continued going before she could say anything.  "I know it.   I'm pretty sure that it's written in stone somewhere," she continued  seriously.  "Like Gospel.  You're name is in italics."</p>

<p>Jessie was quiet for a second, then half exhaled, half laughed,  bowing her head down self-consciously as Katie's words washed over  her like cool fresh water over pebbles on a summer day.  It made her  feel tingly inside, like when they kissed; only it was different at  the same time.  Her mother had told her that she was beautiful  before, her dad too.  Even Eli had acquiesced that she'd `probably be  a looker' when she grew up.  But it had never really fazed her, when  she heard it with them, it had just rolled off of the surface and she  had never truly believed it.  But coming from Katie, it was  different; it began to sink into her.  And she believed it for  second, even if it was only in Katie's eyes.</p>

<p>"Hey, are you okay?" Katie asked concern filling her voice as she  looked at Jessie's still bowed head.  "I didn't mean to embarrass  you," she continued ducking her head down to try and get a better  look at Jessie's face.  "Sometimes I just talk to much.  I won't be  planning on saying anything, and then words just come tumbling out of  my mouth, and I suddenly wish that my mom would actually buy that  muzzle she's always threatening me with."</p>

<p>"You don't talk to much," Jessie said softly finally looking up, her  eyes still shimmering as she gazed at Katie.  "I mean, I like  listening to you talk," she said smirking at her own lameness.</p>

<p>"That works out well then, I think," Katie responded smiling self- depreciatingly seeming not to mind her lameness if there had been  any.  "You know, I meant it.  But I won't say it again if it makes  you uncomfortable," she continued, her finger still unconsciously  stroking Jessie's hand.</p>

<p>"It's not that, it's just…" Jessie started; momentarily distracted by  the feeling Katie's finger was producing in her hand, which then  promptly shot through the rest of her body like electricity.  "I  just, you know never heard that from anyone who's not related to me,"  she continued a moment later, her head dropping down once more.</p>

<p>"Not even from Tad?" Katie asked, a small smile etching it's way  across her features.</p>

<p>Jessie looked up at her then contemplatively.  Tad had told her  something like that.  And she had gotten it from strangers too she  supposed, she just hadn't believed them.  She hadn't believed anyone  who had told her before Katie, not even a little bit.  She still  wasn't sure, not really, she only knew that she believed Katie meant  it, and that was enough for her.</p>

<p>"I guess it just didn't mean anything coming from him," she said  softly, her brows drawing together thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"But it does…from me?" Katie asked studying Jessie's face.</p>

<p>Jessie merely nodded, and then turned her eyes up to look into  Katie's smiling face.</p>

<p>"We were going to …" Karen began opening Jessie's bedroom, pausing  momentarily as she got her first good look inside.  There were just  sitting on the floor, Katie giving Jessie what looked like a palm  reading while grinning at each other, but she felt like she was  interrupting something the moment she opened the door and couldn't  quite explain why.  "Order a pizza, when I realized that I didn't  know what Katie likes," she continued as Jessie scrambled to her  feet, walking over to the door to help steady her.  Eli had carried  her up the stairs, and she'd be fine with the walker for the next few  minutes, but Jessie always worried.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about me," Katie said getting to her feet as well,  rubbing her hands together uncertainly.  "Whatever's fine."  Man, she  thought to herself, did like every parent in the world have the  absolute worst timing ever?  Was there like a course that they got to  take or something?</p>

<p>Karen smiled at her before looking back over at Jessie.  "Pepperoni  and cheese it is," she said then, turning her head slightly as Eli's  voice wafted down to her from further down the hall.  "Yeah, yeah,  you'll get yours," she muttered under her breath, but loud enough for  Jessie to hear as she was standing beside her.</p>

<p>"I thought we were all suppose to behave," Jessie murmured as she  helped her mother maneuver out the door.</p>

<p>"You've got your father's sense of humor," Karen responded shaking  her head, causing Jessie to laugh a little.</p>

<p>"I think dad's funny," she responded as Karen started down the  hallway to her room.</p>

<p>"You would," she heard faintly followed by the soft sounds of  laughter, before she lost sight of her mother as she entered her room.</p>

<p>"I think he's funny," Jessie said again turning around to face Katie,  feeling somewhat unsteady - in a good way - now that she wasn't  holding her mother anymore and therefore able to use her as a  distraction from the emotions that had been coursing through her  before the interruption.</p>

<p>"I think you're funny," Katie offered conciliatorily before flopping  back down on her bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm highly amusing," Jessie, agreed walking over to sit on the  bed beside Katie.</p>

<p>"And beautiful," Katie added.</p>

<p>"Well, that goes without saying," Jessie responded seriously looking  over at Katie, who watched her for a moment before they both broke  out laughing, falling back down on the bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Jessie carefully opened the door to Karen's bedroom, scrunching up  her face with intensity as she tried to make a sound.  Then, having  successfully opened the door she crept inside carefully closing it  behind her before walking over to her mother's bed as stealthily as  humanly possible.  She was like a cat, she was sure of it.</p>

<p>"Hello," Karen said into the dark, having sensed her daughter as soon  as she opened the door.</p>

<p>"AH!" Jessie yelled jumping back a bit.  "How…" she began, starting  to replay her entrance in her head and knowing with absolute  certainty that she hadn't made a sound.</p>

<p>"A mother always knows," Karen responded cryptically looking in the  direction of Jessie's voice.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that a TV show back in the day," Jessie asked lifting up the  edge of the blanket and slipping into the bed, plastering herself to  her mother's side and resting her head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"That was `Father Knows Best'," Karen responded with a touch of  amusement before kissing Jessie on the top of her head.</p>

<p>"Ah," Jessie said softly, almost knowledgably, before asking, "I  wasn't alive then was I?"</p>

<p>"No," Karen responded laughing softly.  "I only saw reruns."</p>

<p>"Must have been a long time ago," Jessie mumbled her response, her  fingers running along the hard outer shell of the cast on her mothers  arm.</p>

<p>"I suppose it would seem like that to you," Karen replied looking  down at the top of Jessie's head.  "Are you settling down?" she asked  a moment later feeling her daughter's breaths coming less and less  frequently.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Jessie replied, not seeming notoriously concerned.</p>

<p>"So I guess you figured out what you wanted then," Karen commented  taking in Jessie's relaxed bearing.  It wasn't often that she saw her  like that, totally calm.  She realized that she herself had a  tendency to worry, and fret over things, and to her chagrin she had  noticed the same tendency in Jessie.  It caused them both to rather  high strung most of the time, so it was rare and very pleasant to see  Jessie this way, and feel similarly herself.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked looking up at her mother even though she could  barely make out her features in the dark.  Had she fallen asleep or  something?</p>

<p>"What we were talking about the other day at the hospital," Karen  answered, feeling Jessie's head drop back down onto her shoulder a  moment later.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie replied, fully awake again.  "Kind of," she continued  not really sure that she wanted to talk about at the moment, or ever.</p>

<p>"What did you decide?" Karen asked bringing her hand up to brush some  hair off of Jessie's face, but then stopping.  She actually like how  it looked, it was as if Jessie had her own personal halo or something.</p>

<p>Her question was followed by a deep sigh, and Jessie wriggling about  like she had ants in her pants for a few seconds, before she finally  began to speak.  "I guess I didn't really decide anything," she  started slowly.  "I just knew … I guess.  Already," she finished  awkwardly.</p>

<p>"So?" Karen prompted leadingly, "What did you realize?" She continued  earning another deep sigh and more shifting from Jessie.</p>

<p>"Mom," the girl whined, stretching the words out for as long as  humanly possible, before burying her head in the crook of Karen's  shoulder as if she was trying hide or find buried treasure.</p>

<p>"I badger because I care," Karen said with a sigh of her own, knowing  that she wasn't going to get anything else out of Jessie for the  moment.  She'd used that exact same tone with her mother more than  once and she knew what it meant.  Quit embarrassing me and leave me  alone.  It was a very adaptable whine.</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie replied softly.  "Can we go to sleep now, or do you  want to keep me up even later on a school night, so that I can't  concentrate in class, flunk out and end up selling pencils on street  corners for a living?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight, honey," was Karen's simple response.</p>

<p>"Night," Jessie mumbled.</p>

<p>"I love you," Karen added dragging the blanket up so that it covered  Jessie's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mom," Jessie said again, the pitch of her voice even higher than  before.</p>

<p>"Alright, alright," Karen replied smiling but trying not to sound  like she was.</p>

<p><u><i>A week later - School</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie flung her math text into the locker, dragging out an even  bigger biology text shoving it into her backpack.  Then, dropping the  now obscenely heavy bag to the floor she reached back and closed her  locker, bending down to pick up her bag when she caught sight of a  familiar figure in the distance.  Leaving the backpack where it was  she leaned back against her locker and stared down the hallway.</p>

<p>She could just make out Katie's face in between the bodies of the  people who were surrounding her.  Katie was shaking her head  emphatically about something and poking at one of the people standing  in front of her rhythmically.  Jessie smiled as she watched the  scene, thinking that she wouldn't have wanted to be the person Katie  was jabbing at.  But mostly, she just watched her friend and let the  feelings that she had now come to associate with Katie wash over  her.  She knew that she was attracted to Katie; there was no denying  that after what happened in her room.  In fact, after what happened  in her room she hadn't wanted to deny it anymore because it had just  felt so good, so right.  It was like as soon as their lips had  touched this huge weight had been lifted off of her shoulders.  It  was like coming home after a really long drive.</p>

<p>And as she stood there, she let her eyes wander around the hall,  looking at the various students as they passed her.  She'd been doing  that a lot since the day at the attic, looking at other people,  trying to figure it out.  What she was?  What wanting to be with  Katie made her?  But she couldn't, because while she looked, while  she thought some people were more attractive than others, and that  some guys were attractive and some girls were attractive, it didn't  really mean anything.  She didn't really feel anything.  Because  whether she meant to or not, her mind always compared them to Katie  and that meant that there was no comparison.  Because nobody came  close, nobody stood a chance next to Katie.</p>

<p>"You know, the law has a word for what you're doing," Grace whispered  sidling up behind Jessie.  "It's called stalking."</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked turning around to face her stepsister, her head  almost knocking into her still open locker door as she turned  around.  Where had she come from? Jessie wondered carefully shutting  the door before she could hurt herself.</p>

<p> "You know with the intensity you do that it could be an Olympic  sport," Grace continued remembering the concentrated look Jessie had  had on her face as she stared down the hall at Katie.  "Barring that  it could at least make it onto ESPN."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Jessie responded turning  her head away as she felt herself start to blush.</p>

<p>Grace leaned toward Jessie after that comment, her voice lowering  secretively.   "I'm talking about your love connection with Claire  Standish over there," knowing that Jessie knew that she knew what was  going on between her and Katie.  After that afternoon in the attic,  when she had turned to see Jessie staring up at the ceiling  all `sunshine, lollipops and rainbows everything', there hadn't been  doubt in her mind as to what had happened.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked turning around to face Grace again.  "With who?"</p>

<p>"God, you are so young," Grace responded shaking her head at Jessie's  ignorance of everything John Hughes.  "You and Katie," Grace  clarified smiling lecherously.</p>

<p>"Right, well.  I gotta get to class," Jessie responded shooting Grace  one last glare before heading off down the hall.</p>

<p>"If it's any consolation, I thought it was cute," Grace called after  her still smiling.  This was going to be great, she'd have material  for months.</p>

<p><u><i>A few weeks later - Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>Katie drew her knees up to her chest, resting her chin on top of her  knees and tilted her head slightly to watch Jessie as the other girl  read off a sheet of paper.  She was suppose to be listening so that  she could give Jessie her opinion on it, but the truth was she was  having trouble concentrating.  Her mind kept drifting, shifting to  contemplate the girl sitting in front of her and what exactly their  relationship was.  She knew how she felt about Jessie, she'd known  for a while that she was seriously falling for the girl, and if she  hadn't already fallen, then she was sure she was only like days from  it.  The problem was she didn't know where Jessie was with them, with  anything.  She knew that Jessie liked her, was attracted to her, but  she didn't know what that meant to Jessie or how it changed their  relationship to her, beyond the obvious advantage of getting to make  out.  Which was a considerable advantage, but still not conclusive.</p>

<p>She wanted to ask, to say something, to have a conversation.  She'd  practiced how to start things off a million times pacing around her  room, or talking in the shower.  She even worked out a whole system  of contingency conversations and branch patterns of inquisition.  But  every time she went to say something, she just couldn't do it.  She'd  look at Jessie, and the girl would smile at her, or say something,  and then she just couldn't get the words past her lips.  She was  afraid, afraid that if she pushed she'd end up pushing Jessie away  and she just couldn't risk that.  But she wanted to know.  She wanted  to know so badly.  It was like trying to scratch an itch through a  snowsuit.</p>

<p>"It sounds great," Katie said softly lifting her head up.  "Of course  I didn't understand half of it," she continued smiling.</p>

<p>"You had this class last year," Jessie responded smiling at her  teasingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I had Mrs. Franklin.  Mrs. Franklin," Katie responded  emphasizing the teacher's name.  She was notorious around the school  for being the absolute worst teacher ever in the history of  man.  "And if that isn't bad enough, Maureen Adams sat next to me and  we used to spend the whole class discussing Frankie's latest fashion  disaster," she continued shaking her head.  "We were such bitches."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you weren't," Jessie replied gently, swiveling in her chair  to get a better look at Katie whose head was back resting on her  knees.</p>

<p>"That's sweet," Katie responded cocking an eyebrow up at her.   "But  we were.  However," she continued some life returning to her  voice.  "I did learn enough to know that your essay is great.  There  are fourth years that can't use existentialist in a sentence.  Hell,  Mrs. Peters probably doesn't know how to use it in a sentence.   You're so going to kill," she finished smiling at Jessie proudly.</p>

<p>Jessie held Katie's gaze for a moment then looked down at her paper,  and back at Katie again, a tentative smile working it's way across  her face as she let out a relieved sigh.  Turning her head to the  side she followed Katie as the girl crawled across the floor until  she was kneeling in front of Jessie's chair.  Jessie looked down at  her as Katie gazed up at her, noting Katie's serious expression with  a touch of concern.</p>

<p>"You know I…" Katie began slowly before trailing off, her eyes losing  focus as her attention turned inside for a moment.  Jessie watched as  a myriad of expressions flowed across her fine features, her eyes  crinkling at the sides as she frowned momentarily before focusing on  Jessie again with a deflated sigh.  "It's just … my mom always says  that when we feel something strongly we should share it," she said  starting up again though her eyes still seemed to be looking at  something beyond Jessie.  "Which is ironic since sharing my strong  feeling on how she looked like a brothel worker the night of her  Christmas party got me grounded for a week," she continued her lips  curving up momentarily before thinning out again.  "But, I mean, what  I really wanted to say, is just that … just how much you, our  friendship means to me.  Cause you're like the best thing that's  happened to me since walking, and that's only cause I needed walking  to be able to get over to you," she went on dropping her head down as  she felt tears begin to well up in her eyes.  For some reason she  just didn't want Jessie to see her cry tonight.</p>

<p>"Katie?" Jessie asked softly her hand reaching out to touch the other  girl's cheek.  She was amazingly touched by the words Katie had just  spoken to her, and surprised yet happy by the intensity with which  they were spoken, but at the same time Katie's demeanor was beginning  to worry her.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," Katie said looking up at Jessie, flashing her a quick  smile.  "Really.  I just wanted you to know," she continued her eyes  drifting off to the side.</p>

<p>Jessie continued to watch her for a moment after that, thinking about  what she could do since there was obviously something bothering  Katie, but before she could open her mouth to begin, Katie's eyes had  returned to her, and she was leaning up bringing their lips  together.</p>

<p>The kiss was slow, and tender and beautiful, and Jessie leaned  forward prolonging the contact between them, absorbing the emotions  pouring into her through Katie's lips.  And then it was gone; Katie  had pulled back and was standing up.</p>

<p>"I've gotta go," Katie said softly when Jessie's eyes finally opened  and turned to look up at her.  "It's late."</p>

<p>Jessie turned her head to the side to glance at the clock beside her  bed, and noticed somewhat sadly that it was late.  She didn't want  Katie to leave, especially now that she was sure that something was  bothering her, but Katie was right, she had to be going home.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie replied, not quite able to keep the disappointment out  of her voice.  "I'll walk you out," she continued grasping Katie's  hand.  Katie glanced down at their joined hands and smiled at her,  and then they headed for the door.</p>

<p><u><i>Manning House</i></u></p>

<p>Grace walked into the living room hurriedly looking behind to make  sure that she had successfully ditched Zoë.  She loved her little  sister, she really did, but she was tired of hearing out the damn  holes in the ozone.  Satisfied that she was safe in a Zoë free zone,  she looked around the room spotting Jessie lying on the couch  starring at the TV.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you speak fluid French too," Grace began crossing the  room to sit on the free couch.  "Because I would literally have to  throw myself off a bridge."</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked blinking at Grace in confusion.  She hadn't even  seen her come into the room, just heard a kind of far off rumbling  and turned to see Grace sitting there with her mouth flapping.  "What  are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Grace studied for a moment only then realizing how out of it Jessie  had to have been.  She nodded towards the TV.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Jessie responded, her mind finally putting together what it  was Grace had said.  "I … no," she continued picking up the remote  and flipping the channel.  "I can't."</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Grace asked staring at Jessie.  She was the one  that was forever complaining about how everyone fawned over Jessie  like she was a newborn puppy or something, and had sworn that she  would never join the `protection of precious widdle Jessie' fan club,  but seeing the girl sitting there obviously out of it, she just  couldn't help herself.</p>

<p> "Oh.  Yeah.  Fine," Jessie responded, her reply coming a second to  late to be even remotely believable.</p>

<p> "You want to talk about it?" Grace asked a moment later  contemplating whether she really cared enough to try dragging  information out of Jessie, then realizing she had nothing better to  do.</p>

<p>Jessie hesitated for a moment, debating internally whether or not she  should talk about what was bothering her with Grace.  "I don't really  know that there's anything to talk about," she said finally.  The  truth was that she kind of wanted some advice and Grace was the only  person who knew what was really happening between her and Katie to  any degree, so she didn't really have a choice in the matter.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Grace asked.</p>

<p>"It's just," Jessie began shaking her head.  "I don't know.  Katie  was acting kind of strange last night.  Upset I guess.  But I don't …  I can' t figure out why," she finished with a sigh looking over at  her stepsister.</p>

<p>"That's easy," Grace replied immediately.  "It's because women are  insane.  That'll be five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at Grace once she finished talking, holding her  gaze for a moment before muttering, "thanks so much for your help."</p>

<p>Grace grinned at her, and she smiled back, silence covering the room  once more before Grace finally broke it.</p>

<p>"What were you talking about before she got all weird?"</p>

<p>"It's private," Jessie muttered in response, her head dropping down  to stare at her lap as she felt her cheeks start to colour, a  sensation that only increased when she heard Grace snicker in the  background.</p>

<p>"I don't need a blow by blow account," Grace said finally even though  she kind of would liked one after seeing Jessie's expression.  "Just  sum it up or something."</p>

<p>Jessie took a deep breath, readying herself as if she were about to  face a firing squad, and then began to speak.  "We were just talking,  and then she … she just told me that I was like important to her and  stuff," she continued her voice dropping as she remembered the  conversation they had had.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you respond?" Grace asked impatiently wondering if  conversation was truly a lost art.  Nobody she knew seemed to be able  to carry on a halfway decent narrative.  It was extremely vexing.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jessie responded shooting Grace a rather biting  look.  "I mean I guess I didn't."</p>

<p>Grace's face fell and her eyes narrowed upon hearing this, her head  turning to look at Jessie with an expression that clearly showed that  she thought Jessie was dumber than a chimp.</p>

<p> "What?"  Jessie asked a bit self-consciously.</p>

<p>"Well, that's obviously it," Grace replied as if what she was saying  were common knowledge.  "Have you ever told her?  How you feel?"  Grace asked looking around to make sure no one was around before she  continued.  "She's probably all insecure about whatever is going on  between you two.  I mean how could she not be after the way you  acted?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean `after the way I acted'?" Jessie asked  grumpily.  "I didn't do anything."</p>

<p>"Nothing except stop talking to her, fake sick to avoid her, and then  turn it all around on her like 180 degrees in a five minute period of  time," Grace replied giving Jessie a hostile little look as she  remembered Katie coming up to her in class, all big watery eyes and  shaky concern over how Jessie had responded to her  letter.  "Basically you fed her a horse sized anxiety pill and now  she's foaming."</p>

<p>Jessie was silent for a moment after that, looking almost  contemplative, and then she looked back over at Grace with a look of  utter confusion on her face.  She obviously had no clue what Grace  was talking about.</p>

<p>Grace sighed deeply.  "She doesn't know how you feel about her and  what's happening between you two.  For all she knows you're using her  to practice until Tad asks you out again," she explained slowly.</p>

<p> "I'm not…" Jessie protested emphatically, shooting Grace an offended  look.</p>

<p>"That's not the point," Grace explained.  "I'm talking about what she  knows, and she doesn't know that that's not what you're doing because  you've never talked to her about it," she went on.  "Of course, I  could be wrong.  Maybe she just had a headache, or indigestion or  something.  But either way you should probably talk to her.  It never  hurt anyone to hear that the person they like likes them back."</p>

<p>"But…" Jessie started, but she was interrupted before she could  finish.</p>

<p>"But what?" Grace asked her.  "You make-out with her so she should be  able to tell?" she continued, smiling as Jessie shot her a look of  pure venom.  "Trust me Jess, it doesn't work that way."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed as she thought over what it was Grace had told  her.  "What if I don't know what to tell her?"</p>

<p>"You obviously know something," Grace responded certain that Jessie  had to have some idea what she was feeling if she had been semi- dating Katie for almost a month now.   "So tell her what you do  know."</p>

<p> "I don't know," Jessie responded uncertainly, leaning back against  the couch wearily.</p>

<p>"Then maybe she's right to be concerned," Grace responded frankly  leaning back as well.</p>

<p>Jessie turned to look at Grace upon hearing that, a denial already  upon her tongue when she heard the front door open and heard Lily and  Judy's voice's as they trudged into the house.   Hearing the noise  get closer and realizing they were coming into the room Jessie turned  away from Grace and started flipping through the channels once again.</p>

<p>"Hey girls," Lily said walking into the room smiling at them.  "How  were your days?"</p>

<p>"Ok," they replied simultaneously before slumping even further down  into the cushions.</p>

<p>Lily glanced over at Judy upon seeing this watching as her sister  smirked at her, shrugging her shoulders as if to say `teenagers,  can't live with them are legally contracted to take care of them'.   Lily frowned, it was hard being mother, it really was.</p>

<p><u><i>Manning House - Dinner</i></u></p>

<p>"What's that you're working on?" Lily asked looking over at Grace who  was vigorously scratching something onto a piece of paper.  Almost  from the moment they had sat down for dinner Grace had been  scribbling on that sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Just some paper work for the GSA dance," Grace responded barely  looking up from her sheet of paper, and as such missing the look her  mother sent her husband.  "It's coming up in a couple of weeks,"  Grace continued looking up, her attention focused on Jessie who was  sitting opposite her.  "It'll be a great opportunity for people to  freely express how they feel about each other in a healthy, positive  way."</p>

<p>"Ouch!" Rick gasped a moment later reaching down under the table to  rub his leg.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Jessie said wincing as she realized she'd kicked the wrong  person.  "Muscle cramp."</p>

<p>Rick looked up at her upon hearing this, his expression both  surprised and proud.  "That's quite a leg you've got there."  But  Jessie had ceased paying attention to him so that she could  concentrate on giving Grace the stink eye.</p>

<p>"Will you be attending the dance?" Lily asked trying to keep her  voice nonchalant.</p>

<p>"Well, I did plan it.  It's kind of my duty," Grace responded as if  that was the stupidest question she'd ever heard.</p>

<p>"Do you know who'll be attending yet?" Lily asked trying to calm her  breathing.</p>

<p>"No, but there's a couple people I'd like to see there," Grace  replied pointedly.</p>

<p>"Oh," Lily responded not quite sure what to make of that.</p>

<p>"Is Jessie gonna go?" Zoë asked feeling as though it was time that  she contribute to the conversation.  Lily looked over at Jessie after  hearing Zoë's question never having considered whether Jessie would  be attending or not.</p>

<p>"What?!" Zoë screeched a moment later.  Jessie had muttered something  under her breath but she hadn't been able to make it out.</p>

<p>"I said `maybe'," Jessie ground out glancing at Zoë before returning  her attention to playing with her mashed potatoes.</p>

<p> "It's nice of you to think about supporting Grace like that," Lily  responded with a smile upon hearing Jessie's answer, causing her to  miss the peevish look Grace sent her.</p>

<p>Jessie considered Lily's comment, and Grace's answering look for a  moment, then gave a small smile and nodded before quickly shoving  some food in her mouth so that she wouldn't have to talk anymore.</p>

<p>"What?" Lily asked finally sensing Grace staring at her.  Grace  simply turned away from her and began to write on her piece of paper  some more.  "What?" she asked again, but it was futile.</p>

<p>"Are girls allowed to play football now?" Rick asked looking at  Jessie appraisingly having finally stopped rubbing at his leg.</p>

<p>"I'm not playing football," Jessie responded around a mouthful of  potato.</p>

<p> "I'm just saying, that with a leg like that you should be kicking  something regularly," Rick responded diplomatically.  Jessie stared  at him then turned away back to her food covering the room in an  oppressive silence.</p>

<p>"So, how was your day?" Lily asked turning to look at her youngest  daughter.  Grace and Jessie sighed, they just knew they were going to  have to listen to a speech about bacon and global warming until Zoë  got bored and decided to go watch cartoons.  It was going to be a fun  meal.</p>

<hr>

<p><u><i>Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie paused outside of her brother's room, debating the wisdom of  talking to him about something that was even mildly important to her  before finally knocking.</p>

<p>Entering the room, she headed straight for his bed and plopped  down.  "What cha doing?"</p>

<p>Eli looked down at the guitar in his hands, then over at the sheet  music in front of him and then back at his sister.  "Playing soccer,"  he responded dryly.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed heavily and rolled over on her side not at all  impressed by his attempt at humor.  "What's wrong with you?" he asked  taking in her rather petulant expression.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie responded glumly thinking that she shouldn't have  bothered with him.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong, you never come in here and lie down with the  pouty face unless something's wrong," Eli replied really paying  attention for the first time.  This wasn't like one of Jessie's (or  any girl for that matter) normal mood swings.  Something was really  getting to her.</p>

<p>"Nothing's wrong," Jessie repeated picking at his comforter  militantly.</p>

<p>"Fine" Eli responded starting to strum again.  He wasn't going to  argue with her when she got like this.  If she came to his room, she  obviously wanted to talk and would get around to it sooner or later.   In the meantime he was perfectly happy to go on about his business.</p>

<p>Jessie glanced over at him a minute later seeing him happily plucking  away and frowned. "There's this person," she started interrupting  him.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli prompted putting his pick down and turning to face her.</p>

<p>"Well, what if there's this person that likes you, and you like them  only they know that you like them but they don't know that you like  them as much as they like you, and you want to tell them how much you  like them but you're also not sure what it means that you like them  as much as you do," Jessie asked sitting up slowly as she began to  talk before looking at him expectantly.</p>

<p>"I'm not even sure whether that was a question or not," Eli finally  responded his brows coming together in confusion.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed at his ignorance and flopped back down on the bed,  clearly finding him to be no help at all.</p>

<p>"But I did understand about a third of it," he continued ignoring his  sisters melodramatics, "and if this person likes you and you like  them, you should just tell them.  Carpe diem Scout, you gotta hold on  to the important stuff when you still have it."</p>

<p>"Carpe diem," Jessie responded thoughtfully, rolling her eyes up to  the ceiling contemplatively.  Carpe diem.</p>

<p><u><i>Two days later - Bonfire. Night.</i></u></p>

<p>Sensing a break in the conversation Jessie quickly excused herself  ducking away from the assembled group of ex-play people and made her  way across the field approaching a group of people, among whom Katie  was entrenched.  Catching Katie's eye and tilting her head to the  side Jessie watched as some life entered her eyes and she quickly,  very quickly, pushed her way past the people standing around her.</p>

<p>"My hero," Katie gushed as they entered the woods to escape the mass  of people occupying the field.  "I don't know if I could've taken  another second of that," she continued smiling over at Jessie.  "Did  you know that there are people out that actually like Carson Daily?"  she asked with a horrified expression.  "I was so scared.  I felt  like asking for my Mommy."</p>

<p>"Just returning the favor," Jessie responded through a laugh as she  watched Katie mock shiver in fright.</p>

<p>"What favor?" Katie asked absently bending down to pick up a stick,  and fencing with an imaginary enemy for a moment before turning her  full attention back to Jessie.</p>

<p>"For saving me from Tad and his tarantula impression, all those many  months ago," Jessie responded smiling over at Katie.</p>

<p>"Oh," Katie replied with a grin.  "Well, Tad's moves are an act  against humanity.  I was morally bound to rescue you, before he got  around to asking if your daddy was a thief," she continued rolling  her eyes at Tad's lameness.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did," Jessie responded reaching over and grasping  Katie's hand in hers as they made their way further into the  forest.  "Of course if anything like that happened now, more  strenuous measures would need to be taken," Jessie continued  conversationally. </p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked intrigued enough to stop obsessing about how  good it felt to be holding Jessie's hand long enough to listen to  her. </p>

<p>"Well, you would clearly have to declare a feud with his house, or at  the least insult his immediate family," Jessie responded trying to  keep her voice breezy although she was actually concentrating with  all her might to keep her voice from cracking.  "Now that I'm your  girl, you could do no less," she finished.</p>

<p>Katie was silent for a moment after she finished speaking, the sound  of their feet on the ground the only noise around them.  "My girl?"  she asked finally, a wide grin spreading across her face that was  clearly heard through her tone. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded.  "If you want," she continued softly,  looking down at the ground. </p>

<p>As the words reached her ears Katie stopped walking dragging Jessie  to a stop too seeing as how their hands were still held  together.  "My girl," she breathed out softly, as if testing out the  phrase.  "Yeah," she continued smiling again, tugging Jessie's hand  gently to bring them closer together before leaning forward and  pressing her lips against Jessie's happily. </p>

<p>Pulling back she watched as Jessie smiled up at her then moved  forward resting her head on her shoulder contently, a soft sigh  escaping her lips.  Katie drew her arms around Jessie, holding her  firmly against her as she carelessly drew tiny shapes on Jessie's  back with her fingers.</p>

<p>"Katie!  Jessie!" they heard from somewhere nearby.  It was Tad.</p>

<p>Reluctantly they pulled apart just before he burst out in front of  them.</p>

<p>"What're you doing out here?" he asked looking between them.</p>

<p>"Trying to figure out the fastest way to Mexico," Katie responded  glibly.  "What're you doing out here?"</p>

<p>"Had to clean out the pipe," Tad responded with a grin.</p>

<p>"Ewww, gross," Katie replied making a face.  "You didn't go on the  pathway did you?" she asked looking back the way they had entered.</p>

<p>Tad just smiled and said, "come on, the kegs here," then took off.</p>

<p>Katie shook her head then looked over at Jessie with a smile.  "Come  on, we're going to need to tap in to survive the rest of the night."</p>

<p><u><i>A week later</i></u></p>

<p>Katie pressed herself against Jessie in a dark corner of the porch  and leaned down, brushing her lips against Jessie's softly, before  smiling and pressing her lips to Jessie's forehead affectionately.</p>

<p>"I should go," she sighed a moment later not needing to look at her  watch to know that it was late.  They had just gotten back from some  god awful movie that she couldn't even remember anymore - sometimes  she loved the damage MTV had done to her long term, hell her short  term memory - and she didn't quite want to separate from Jessie yet.   The movie had been fun; the backs of theatres were simply divine.</p>

<p>"Come inside," Jessie whispered soaking up the feeling the Katie's  body so close to hers.  "If you don't at least pop in to say hi,  they're going to question me incessantly about everything we did  tonight."</p>

<p>"That could be fun," Katie replied.  "But not for you," she amended  catching the look Jessie sent her.  "Alright then, let's go."</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie called out as they entered the living room.  Everyone,  but Zoë who was probably in bed, was gathered around the TV watching  a loud movie.  Upon the sound of her voice the others looked up, her  dad smiled, Eli barely blinked, Grace smirked and Lily asked how the  movie was.</p>

<p>"Stupid," was Jessie's response to Lily's question as she plunked  herself on the floor by her dad's feet not wanting to get on the  couch with him and Lily.  Some things were better left undisturbed.   Katie took a step forward and followed Jessie's led plopping herself  down onto the floor on the other side of Rick's legs.</p>

<p>"I like you're hair," Lily said by way of conversation fingering  Katie's follicles for a second before Katie looked over at her with a  smile thanking her and quoting some hair commercial.</p>

<p>"What movie?" Jessie asked after smiling stupidly at Katie's response  to Lily's caressing.</p>

<p>"Not sure," Rick responded.  "But you see that guy that's covered in  blood?  His hand just tried to kill him," he continued.  "Things are  only going to get worse for him now."</p>

<p>"Neat. Family entertainment," Katie whispered looking over at Jessie  across Rick's knees.  Jessie met her eyes and they grinned at each  other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Looks like you've got a fan club," Eli commented standing up as the  credits rolled and turning to face his dad.  Lily and Grace followed  his gaze looking over to Rick, who now had two sleeping girls using  his legs as pillows.</p>

<p>"Aw," Lily said her hand rising to her mouth, clearly finding the  display to cute for words.  Grace looked over at her mother and  rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Wakey, wakey," Rick said placing her hands on their shoulders and  shaking slightly, his legs were starting to go numb.  Gratuitous  blinking followed this, and quick shifting in an attempt to make it  seem like they weren't really sleeping at all, but they soon stopped  realizing that nobody was buying their act.</p>

<p>"I better go," Katie mumbled still half asleep as she stood up and  nearly fell back over, much to Jessie's amusement until she nearly  did the same thing.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Lily replied dismissively.  "Why don't you just call your  mom and tell her you're spending the night.  We'll drop by your house  in the morning and you can get your things for school."</p>

<p>"Then it's a sleepover," Jessie responded looking over at Katie who  shrugged.  Jessie smiled and turned her attention back to Lily who  was handing the phone to Katie accidentally catching a look at Grace,  who was glaring at her like she'd just kicked her cat or something.   Jessie sighed, what now?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's so unfair," Grace grumbled at Jessie as they stood outside the  bathroom door.  Jessie was waiting of Katie who was in there changing  into some clothes she'd given her, but Grace was apparently just  hanging around to bug the shit out of her.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked tiredly.</p>

<p>"She never would have let Spencer sleepover," Grace complained.  "In  MY BED," she continued.  Oh, someone's grapes were sour.  Jessie  merely shrugged at first, before then shooting Grace a smile that  left no doubt it was her who ate the canary.</p>

<p>"So?" Grace asked suggestively a moment later, leaning towards Jessie  as if they were sharing a top-secret message.</p>

<p>"So what?" Jessie asked tilting her head back surprised to find  Grace's face so close to her own.</p>

<p>"So have you …" Grace began.  "Are you going to…" she continued  looking at Jessie expectantly.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked her voice squeaking slightly, Grace's tone and  demeanor setting her on guard.</p>

<p>"You know," Grace said grinning, her eyebrows rising salaciously.</p>

<p>"No!"  Jessie responded jumping back slightly, clearly surprised and  a bit agitated by Grace's suggestion.  "And no," she continued  staring at Grace like she'd suddenly grown a second head.</p>

<p>Grace smiled, a low chuckle coming out of her throat as she watched  Jessie's eyes suddenly grow as wide as saucers as the reality of her  situation and what Grace was implying settled in with her.</p>

<p>"What's so funny?" Katie asked coming out of the washroom.  Seeing  Grace so clearly amused and Jessie ashen-faced and nearly shaking she  was almost afraid to find out.  "Are you okay?" she asked Jessie  reaching out to touch her shoulder, slightly surprised to feel Jessie  twitch underneath her hand.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Jessie responded but she seemed to still be shaking faintly  and Katie didn't believe a word that was coming out of her mouth.   She turned a questioning and accusing look at Grace but before she  could say anything Jessie had grabbed her hand and was dragging her  up the attic, yelling `night' to Grace.</p>

<hr>

<p>Katie finally let her eyes drift open of sighed.  This was  ridiculous.  She was actually tired but there was absolutely no way  she was going to be able to go to sleep like this.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should sleep on the floor," she commented into the darkness  knowing that Jessie was still awake.  Almost as soon as they entered  the room they became hyper aware of each other, and once they got on  the bed, every breath the other took was like as loud as thunder.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie exclaimed, "why?" she continued still clutching at her  blanket.</p>

<p>"If you were any stiffer I think you'd have to be legally declared  dead," Katie replied with a sigh, noting that Jessie hadn't moved,  except for taking an occasional breath, for like fifteen  minutes.  "Besides, I'm gonna cramp up if I keep trying not to move."</p>

<p>"You can move," Jessie replied glancing over at her.</p>

<p>"Physically yes, I am capable of it," Katie responded meeting  Jessie's eyes before turning her gaze away again.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should sleep over the floor," Katie said again reaching for  the edge of the blanket.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie replied reaching over and slapping her hand away.</p>

<p>"You're obviously not going to be able to fall asleep with me beside  you," Katie responded trying to use reason to get her way.  The fact  that Jessie was pressed up against her back not making accessing her  reasoning center the easiest thing for her.</p>

<p>"I'm not the only one that's awake," Jessie pointed out slowly  removing herself from Katie's back and lying back down.</p>

<p>"Touché," Katie conceded with a sigh.  "It's just…I don't wanna do  anything."</p>

<p>"I wasn't saying that we should," Jessie replied a touch to quickly,  her conversation with Grace making her a bit jumpy about the  subject.  The thought of them doing stuff hadn't even entered her  mind when Lily suggested that Katie sleep over, but after Grace had  started talking about it, she had started thinking about, and now she  couldn't stop clutching her blanket.</p>

<p>"No, I mean like by accident," Katie responded sighing again,  choosing to ignore how quickly Jessie confirmed that she didn't want  to do anything.  "When I'm asleep I don't… I mean I sometimes, I have  dreams … as people are known to from time to time," she continued  shifting uncomfortably.  "Sometimes you're in them," she went on her  eyes plastered on the ceiling.  "And, sometimes I toss and turn," she  explained trying to keep her breathing even.  "I just don't want to  end up dreaming and toss and turn on you," she finished closing her  eyes with a dejected exhalation.  Well that was thoroughly mortifying.</p>

<p>"Oh," Jessie breathed out, trying not to think about how pleased she  was to hear that Katie dreamed about her sometimes.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  So I'll just…" Katie began trying to move again.</p>

<p>"You're not sleeping on the floor," Jessie said reaching out to stop  her again.  "I forbid it."</p>

<p>"But…" Katie started again, not quite able to her whine inaudible,  once again incredibly aware of the heat emanating from Jessie's body  as she leaned over her trying to stop her from moving</p>

<p>"I'll take the chance," Jessie replied softly.  "Besides," she  continued.  "If you did toss and turn, and ended up somewhere near  the vicinity of me … it'd hardly be the worse thing that could  happen," she continued, trying not to let on how much the idea of  sleeping in Katie's arms actually appealed to her.  It wasn't like  she wanted to do stuff, yet, but the lying together part didn't seem  so bad, in fact it seemed kind of perfect in theory.</p>

<p>"Really?"  Katie asked, trying not to let on how pleased she was by  the idea that Jessie wasn't totally opposed to the concept of long  term snuggling, show in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded simply.</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll stay," Katie acquiesced, sighing grandly.</p>

<p>"I'll know if you're actually asleep," Jessie added, once she felt  Katie shift and settle down again.</p>

<p>Katie laughed softly in response.  Then deciding to just go with the  flow asked, "would it really make a difference?"</p>

<p>"Probably not," Jessie admitted softly, and then she flipped around  with her back to Katie drawing the blanket around her before  muttering `goodnight'.</p>

<p>"Night," Katie replied a smile spreading across her face.  It was a  night that couldn't help but be good.</p>

<p><u><i>Karen's House - A Week Later</i></u></p>

<p>"You didn't have to do this," Karen said stepping back out of Judy's  way as her friend moved across the kitchen to reach for the plates.   After a conversation they'd had earlier that week, Judy had declared  that she was going to come over and cook some real food, after all of  the take-out they'd been living off of since Karen returned home.   Karen had protested at first, but eventually Judy's promises of food  that didn't come out of anything Styrofoam won her over.</p>

<p>"I know," Judy replied turning around to face her with a little  smile.  "I wanted to.  Now gracefully accept, and call your brats for  dinner," she continued moving into the dining room to set the table.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Karen said her voice teasing as she headed for the  stairs.  "Really," she continued more seriously.</p>

<p>"You're very welcome," Judy replied, and then turned back to her task  as Karen set off up the stairs.  It was still difficult for her to  move around, and just moving around the house tired her out to a  degree that she never would have imagined possible before, but she  was getting better.  And she was able to walk with only a cane now,  so she had gotten back some of that independence she had sorely  missed during the apex of her injury.</p>

<p>"Dinner ready?" Eli asked popping his head out of his door, his nose  twitching as the smells from downstairs wafted up to him.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Karen responded.  "Is Jessie in her room?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, she got a phone call twenty-minutes so she's probably still  squealing away," he answered pushing out of his room and heading for  the stairs.  "You'll be okay?" he asked wondering if she'd need his  help down.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Karen nodded smiling at him.  "Go ahead," and with that he  disappeared down the stairs.</p>

<p>"No, you shut up," Jessie said laughing into the receiver.  "No.   No.  No you shut up," she repeated again giggling as her mother  approached her partially open door.  Knowing that she probably  shouldn't but unable to help herself, Karen propped herself up  against the wall outside Jessie's room, listening to the happy sounds  that drifted into the hallway, a smile working it's way across her  face at hearing her daughter so obviously happy.</p>

<p>"You do more," Jessie went on, her voice teasing.  "Hmmm," she  continued thoughtfully.  "Maybe.  I said maybe," she went on drawing  out the last word wickedly.  Karen placed her hand over her mouth,  overcome by the sheer preciousness of the scene.  She remembered what  it was like to be in High School, and how she had had similar  conversations with boys from school just like the one Jessie was  having now.  "Hey," she heard Jessie exclaim, jarring her back to the  present.  "Yeah, I guess I do," she continued oblivious to her  mother's presence.</p>

<p>Beginning to fell bad about her eavesdropping, Karen silently  repositioned herself to make it seem as if she was just coming down  the hall, and called out Jessie's name, pushing her door open as she  did.</p>

<p>Jessie flipped over looking at her doorway to see her mother standing  there.  "I gotta go," Jessie said.  "Dinner.  Judy.  Yeah.  Yeah.   Yeah.  Stop it," she said, pausing every few second's apparently  answering questions from the person on the other end.  "I gotta go.   I mean it, she's standing right here.  Okay.  Bye," Jessie finished  clicking off the phone and standing up.  "I'll be right down, I just  gotta wash my hands," she said looking over her mother.</p>

<p>"Okay, everything's set up so just come down when you're done," Karen  responded backing out of the doorway to let her by.  Then smiling as  Jessie bounded down the hallway she made her way down the stairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was still on the phone?" Judy asked raising an eyebrow as Karen  took her seat.  "Who was she talking to?"</p>

<p>"Tad," Karen responded smiling as she reached for her silverware.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Eli mumbled derisively around a mouth full of  food.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Karen asked looking up at him curiously.  She had  been certain that with the way Jessie had been acting it had to have  been Tad she was taking to.  "Is she seeing someone else?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, but that's not what I meant," Eli replied looking  up for a second before turning back to food.  "It was a girl on the  other end.  Probably Katie," he continued.  "All I ever hear or see  anymore is the two of them laughing and flitting around," he went on  rolling his eyes as he reached for his drink.  "Is there anything  more annoying than teenage girls?"</p>

<p>"You didn't seem to mind them two years ago," Judy, commented  grinning at Eli, who had the good graces to nod, conceding her point.</p>

<p>"She's been over there a lot too?" Karen asked looking over at Eli,  her mind still wrestling with her earlier interpretation of Jessie's  tone and the information that she had been talking to Katie, not Tad.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli muttered as he chewed.  "I swear to god, Dad's going to  have to convert the storage closet into a room for her or something,  she's over there more than I am," he continued.</p>

<p>"She's so cool though," Judy said piping up.  "I was talking to her  about the new Victoria's Secret line, and she was so right about like  everything.  I went back, and pg. 56 really was probably the most  unappealing thing I'd ever seen.  The convent page," Judy continued  chuckling to herself as she thought about it.</p>

<p>"Yeah, fabulous," Karen replied, forcing a smile onto her face.  She  was distracted, there was something nagging at her, scratching at the  back of her mind trying to dig through, but she couldn't put her  finger on it.  She just knew that there was something that she should  be getting but that just kept eluding her.  However, before she  ponder the situation anymore Jessie came tumbling down the stairs  throwing herself into the free seat, drawing Karen's attention  outwards once more.</p>

<p>Jessie rested her head against the car door watching the houses and  trees streak by absently, her mind pleasantly blank as they drove  quietly to school.  At least it was quiet for a while.</p>

<p>"Well?" Grace asked expectantly looking over at Jessie's oblivious  form.</p>

<p>"Did I miss something?" Jessie asked tiredly, turning her head to  look at Grace.  "We weren't talking, so what could you possibly  be `welling'?"</p>

<p>"The dance is on Friday," Grace replied reaching out to play with the  radio for a second.  "So?" she continued when Jessie didn't reply.</p>

<p>"So what?" Jessie asked sighing deeply as she turned to look at Grace  once more.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" Grace asked slowly, carefully pronouncing each word  as if she thought that Jessie needed to get hooked on phonics.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie responded drawing her word out as painfully slowly as  Grace had.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Grace asked scowling at her as she rounded a corner.</p>

<p>"Why do you care?" Jessie asked irritably turning her attention back  the passing scenes outside the window.  Just cause she had asked  Grace for advice like once in her whole life it didn't mean that she  wanted to talk about everything that had ever happened to her in  excruciating detail with the girl.</p>

<p>"I don't," Grace replied in a similarly cranky tone.  "Do whatever  you want," she continued her tone clearly conveying that she thought  that whatever it was Jessie had decided was plainly wrong.</p>

<p>"Fine," Jessie replied standoffishly.  "I will."</p>

<p>"Fine," Grace muttered back, leaving the only the low sounds of radio  to fill the car.  "Why aren't you going?"</p>

<p>"Dances are stupid," Jessie responded.  "All everyone ever does is  stand around in corners with their friends and make stupid requests  to the DJ so that they can go back to the corners with their friends  and snicker about it," she continued huffily.</p>

<p>"You don't want anyone to know that you're dating her do you?" Grace  accused glancing over Jessie.  "That's why you let everyone go on  thinking that it's Tad who's calling you in the middle of the night,  and why you always shut up whenever mom brings up the dance," she  continued gaining steam now.  "You don't want to soil you're perfect  little image."</p>

<p>"You don't have any idea what you're talking about," Jessie said  softly, her tone all serious and vaguely hostile.  "You're always  going on about how I think I'm so perfect and blah, blah, sour  grapes, but you're the one who thinks you're gods gift or something.   All knowing, all seeing Grace Manning," she continued softly, her  tone bitterly sarcastic.  "Sell it to someone else," she went on  brushing some hair out of her face.  "You're no better at this than I  am."</p>

<p>Grace opened her mouth to respond, but then clamped down stopping  herself - for once - from saying the first thing that popped into her  head.  The last thing that she wanted was a repeat of what had  happened between them in the bathroom weeks ago.  Not only did she  not want to see that look on Jessie's face again, she didn't really  think that she could sit through another one of Jessie's verbal  lashings either.  </p>

<p>"You do whatever you want," Grace said quietly as she parked the car  and popped the keys out of the ignition.  "But she wants to go," she  continued getting out of the car and turning on the automatic  locks.  "*She's* proud of you," she finished closing the door on  Jessie who remained seated inside, her eyes following Grace's rapidly  retreating figure.</p>

<hr>

<p><u><i>Dr. Rosenfeld's (a.k.a. Therapy)</i></u></p>

<p>"So I guess she's sort of right," Jessie admitted reluctantly.  "But  she's not right for the reason she thinks she's right for.  She just  kind of stumbled across a part of right by accident," Jessie mumbled  looking over at Dr. Rosenfeld grouchily as if admitting that Grace  could be even a little right about anything was on par with being  kicked in the crotch.</p>

<p>"So you are a little ashamed of your relationship with Katie?" Dr.  Rosenfeld asked, taking off his glasses and wiping them slowly.</p>

<p>"No!" Jessie responded quickly.  "It's not … I mean it's more  complicated than that.  It's just that if they know, about us,  they're going to start asking questions and I don't think I have the  answers to those questions.  I mean, I'm with Katie, and that's  great, and I really, really like her.  I know that.  But I don't know  what that means, you know?  And they'll want to know, and if I can't  tell them then …"</p>

<p>"They'll send you to therapy?" Dr. Rosenfeld asked with a gentle  smile, which Jessie returned.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I mean?" she continued a moment later  though.  "It's like I'm confused about the big picture, the big  picture's like a fuzzy dot to me."</p>

<p>"Why do you think you have to worry about the big picture now?" Dr.  Rosenfeld asked glasses back on now.</p>

<p>"Because they'll be concerned with the big picture," Jessie responded  with a sigh.  "And I don't know what to tell them.  I like Katie so  I'm obviously a little gay.  But how gay?  Can you measure gay?  Am I  completely gay, or like gay lite?  Just one calorie," she continued  slumping in her chair.  "I mean, I've heard all of that sexuality is  fluid, it's like a colour scale or a pie chart and stuff, but…" she  began trailing off, her eyes drifting around the room.</p>

<p>"But what?" Dr. Rosenfeld asked trying to coax her attention back to  him.</p>

<p>"I don't think that *they* know that stuff," Jessie replied her eyes  crinkling at the corners as her features drew together worriedly.</p>

<p>"You feel like they want something from you that you can't give  them?" Dr. Rosenfeld questioned though it was really more of a  statement.</p>

<p>"I guess that pretty much sums it up," Jessie replied glumly.  "All  of it maybe," she continued thinking about that `perfect' wedding  dress her mother had shown her when she was six and had told her she  was saving for her `perfect' wedding.  </p>

<p>"Nobody has all the answers Jessie," Dr. Rosenfeld replied watching  her carefully.  With Jessie you could almost learn more about her  from the expressions that flowed across her features than from her  words.  "No matter what they tell you, or how old or young they are.   Except for me," he went on earning a tiny smile for his last  crack.  "If you wait until you're absolutely a hundred percent  certain about something, to talk to your parents about it, then  you're all just going to have to get very comfortable playing  charades together, because no matter what, no matter when there's  always going to be doubts.  Nothing is ever one hundred percent.  All  we can hope for is a sincere belief, and certainty in our hearts if  not our heads."</p>

<p>Jessie looked up and over at him upon hearing that, her features  relaxing and her eyes clouding over, getting a distant look in them  as she considered what he said.</p>

<p><i><u>School – Monday Afternoon</u></i></p>

<p>Jessie jerked backwards suddenly finding a foreign object being  thrust her face.  Regaining her composure once she had separated  herself from the object she turned around to see Katie standing  slightly behind her smiling.  She was holding out something in front  of Jessie's face.  Turning back to look at what Katie was holding she  saw a flower in front of her.</p>

<p>"You can take it Billie, it's for you," Katie said speaking for the  first time since sneaking up on her.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Jessie responded taking the object from Katie's hands.</p>

<p>"It's a paper flower," Katie replied thinking that was pretty  obvious.  "I made it in art class.  I almost had a bouquet, but there  was an … incident, shall we say, and I was only able to save this,"  she continued.  "Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"I love it," Jessie said smiling over at her.</p>

<p>"Then those were tax dollars well spent," Katie replied sounding just  as delighted as she felt.  "Don't forget to put it in water," she  went on receiving a slap on her shoulder for her trouble.  "I was  just trying to be helpful," Katie laughed spinning away from Jessie  coming at a stop at a nearby locker.</p>

<p>"Trying to be an idiot is more like it," Jessie replied smiling as  she fastened the arts and craft flower to one of the pockets on her  backpack.  "What do you think?" she asked looking over at Katie once  she was done.</p>

<p>"I think you're dating a cheapskate," the girl replied grinning as  Jessie rolled her eyes at her.  "You want a ride home?" Kate  continued a second later.  "My parents finally let me take the car,  so how about I impress you with how responsible and adult like my  driving is?"</p>

<p>"Responsible and adult like?" Jessie asked skeptically, thinking that  whenever someone gratuitously tooted their own horn there was usually  nothing to toot at.</p>

<p>"Fine.  Competent," Katie replied rolling her eyes.  "But I promise,  I'll take good care of you."</p>

<p>"Alright," Jessie agreed smiling.  She was actually pleased by the  offer; it meant that they'd have some time alone together.</p>

<p>"Then it's a car pool," Katie responded as the bell rang.  "I'll meet  you at your locker after 8th," and with that she was off down the  hall.  </p>

<p>Jessie looked down at the flower attached to her bag, giving one last  smile before turning and heading into her own classroom.</p>

<hr>

<p>"So," Jessie began tugging at her seatbelt self-consciously.  "It's  almost Friday, huh?" she continued wincing at her own stupidity.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, it's coming up," Katie responded glancing over at her before  returning her eyes to the road.  Jessie had already freaked out at  once on the drive for her `look, no hands' trick, so she was trying  to redeem herself.  "Right after Thursday I think."</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at her, but chose to ignore that last comment.   She kind of deserved it.  "So, the dance is on Friday," she began,  picking imaginary lint off of her pants.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie replied carefully, wondering where Jessie was going  with this.  "I was talking to Russell during 5th, and he said that  Grace has gone like nuts with it.  Apparently she's got Jamie K. to  DJ," she continued conversationally.  "He said it sounds lush."</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's been like totally obsessing over planning it," Jessie  replied.  "It's been like she forgot to take her medication … or  started taking medication, I'm not sure which, for like the last  week," she went on shaking her head at the memories of Grace totally  losing her shit and running around the house like a chicken with her  head cut off.  "So … youwannago?"</p>

<p>"What was that?" Katie asked her eyebrows drawing together as she  tried to decipher Jessie's word jam.</p>

<p>"Do you wanna go?" Jessie asked again calming herself.  "To the  dance?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to?" Katie asked sensing Jessie's anxiety, but not  really knowing which of the million possibilities was causing  it.  "Cause if you're just asking cause you think I wanna go, but you  don't really want to go, then we don't have to go.  Cause you know,  I've got Jenga Plus, and that's always a good time."</p>

<p>"I wanna go," Jessie responded sincerely.  "I wanna go with you."</p>

<p>"And I wanna go with you," Katie replied a huge smile spreading  across her face, relief flushing happily through her body.</p>

<p>"Okay then," Jessie replied smiling herself.  That wasn't so hard.</p>

<hr>

<p>"What's that?" Karen asked staring at the back of Jessie's bag as her  daughter tossed it on the counter and went to the fridge.  Jessie  turned around to see what her mother was taking about and shook her  head.</p>

<p>"It's a paper flower mom," she responded.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," Karen said tracing the edges of it with her  finger.  "Did you make it?"</p>

<p>"Katie did," Jessie responded absently unscrewing a water  bottle.  "It's nice, huh?" she continued smiling.  "Apparently there  was a whole bouquet, but there was an incident and the rest of them  met a horrible fate.  Mine is only survivor," she continued almost  blissfully, completely oblivious to the keen expression on her  mothers face as she regarded her.  "I think I'll call it Rainbow."</p>

<p>"That was nice of her," Karen murmured watching Jessie closely.  "To  give it to you."</p>

<p>"Can we go shopping?" Jessie asked bored with the previous  conversation thread her mind flashing forward to the dance on  Friday.  "Pacing ourselves of course," Jessie added remembering that  while Karen was moving freely now, she still didn't have the stamina  she had before the accident.</p>

<p>"Sure," Karen responded thrown off a bit by the abrupt subject  change.  "Did you have something special in mind?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jessie said thoughtfully twirling to lean against the  counter.  "What do you think I should wear?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Wear for what?" Karen asked wondering if she had blanked out for  part of the conversation, and wondering when Jessie suddenly got  concerned about what she would wear for anything.  She'd seemed  completely ambivalent towards getting dressed up for her first date  with date, almost pissed off that people kept bringing it up – `If I  was going to kill myself, people would ask me what I was going to  wear' – so this sudden interest in what she was going to wear  somewhere peaked Karen's interest.</p>

<p>"The dance," Jessie responded straightening up, trying to act as if  she hadn't pulled that answer out of her ass.  She suddenly became  aware of how she was behaving, the euphoria from the car ride finally  fading, and she decided that it would be prudent to stop acting like  a twelve year old at an Nsync concert.  Even though Katie WAS dreamy. </p>

<p>"What dance?" Karen asked with a touch of exasperation in her voice.</p>

<p>"The one on Friday," Jessie replied breezily.  "You know, the one  Grace planned.  I told her I'd go," she continued playing with the  water bottle as half-truth tumbled out past her lips.</p>

<p>"Oh," Karen said not really knowing anything about the dance that  Grace had planned.  "That's nice.  It's good that the two of you are  getting along better," she continued remembering that she hadn't  heard Jessie complaining about the other girl quite as bitterly  lately.  "Do you have a date?" she inquired nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"I'm just going to go with Katie," Jessie responded missing the sharp  breath Karen look Karen in her direction upon hearing that.  "It's  kind of an informal thing," she continued realizing how that must  have sounded, even without seeing her mothers look.  "You know, just  kind show up.  Everyone's probably going to stay on their own side of  the room anyway … but the DJ is suppose to be good."</p>

<p>"Well that sounds like fun," Karen responded feeling a bit  faint.  "Why don't you go finish you're homework and then we can head  out to the mall," she continued desperate for some alone time to stop  her head from spinning.</p>

<p>"Cool," Jessie responded brightly, and with that grabbed her backpack  and made her way up the stairs, failing to note how Karen's eyes  followed her until she was out of sight.</p>

<p>Propping her elbows down on the kitchen counter Karen let out a sigh  she'd been holding in almost since Jessie entered the kitchen and  closed her eyes breathing in deeply.  Everything could have been  perfectly innocent, it could be nothing, but there was something  inside of her that was telling her that it was something.  Her mind  drifted back now that she had acknowledged the seed that had been  growing in the back of her mind since dinner with Judy.  She recalled  the conversation she'd had with Jessie about how she hadn't felt an  attraction towards Tad, and how Jessie had seemed to come to life  once she had become friends with Katie.  And she recalled the  conversation they'd had in the hospital about how Jessie had learned  a certain `person' had liked her more than she thought and she hadn't  known how she felt about it.  And that time she had walked into  Jessie's room to find the two of them holding hands, and million and  two other looks and glances and incidents that she hadn't taken the  time to consider.</p>

<p>She sighed again, her head tilting to the side as she considered the  phone hanging on the wall.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Karen," Rick said surprised, tossing his pencil down onto his desk  as he leaned back in his chair, wondering what he had done this time.</p>

<p>"I ah, was just calling to let you know that I'm going to take Jessie  shopping for the dance, so you don't need to worry about that," Karen  responded, her mind shooting off in a hundred different directions as  she tried to consider the best way to go about getting the answers  she desperately needed.</p>

<p>"Dance?" Rick asked sounding confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Karen replied wondering how he could not know when his  stepdaughter had planned it.  "Jessie said Grace was in charge of it."</p>

<p>"Oh," Rick replied.  "That dance.  I didn't know Jessie was going,  she'd said that maybe she was, but that was weeks ago, and she  sounded like she was just saying that to get the conversation off  her, and she hadn't mentioned anything about it since then, so I  didn't know that she was actually going."</p>

<p>"Well, she is," Karen, replied, not really caring to hear his inner  monologue on the subject.  "So Grace planned it, huh?  She the head  of some committee or something?"</p>

<p>"I guess maybe on the board of directors or something," Rick  replied.  "It's for the Gay/Straight Alliance, she joined a while  back.  That crazy drama teacher is in charge of it though."</p>

<p>"Gay/Straight Alliance?" Karen asked weakly.  "How progressive," she  continued biting her lip.  "So girls will be going with each other … and so on," Karen continued Jessie's words ringing through her  head `I'm just going to go with Katie.  I'm just going to go with  Katie.  I'm just going to go with Katie' over and over again like it  wanted to go to the bathroom on a long car trip.  "Sorry, what was  that?"</p>

<p>"I said I guess so," Rick replied wondering if Karen had recently  taken any medication.  "I don't really know, but I would think so.   Grace just keeps on asking us what it matters and saying that people  should be able to date whoever they want or there's no point to  living whenever we ask, so it's been a dead subject lately."</p>

<p>"Okay," Karen said her voice alarming chipper, now frantic to get off  the phone with Rick.  "Well, bye."</p>

<p>"Bye," Rick responded staring ahead completely befuddled.  </p>
