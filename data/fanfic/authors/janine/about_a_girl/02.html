<p><i><u>Karen's House – Thursday Night</u></i></p>

<p>Karen stood at the doorway to the living room, looking at the TV from her position just outside the door. Jessie was in there watching TV, and when she had passed by the image of a shimming half dressed woman on the screen had sucked her in. Hearing a sound behind her in the kitchen she quickly turned around.</p>

<p>"What's she watching?" Karen asked flicking her head towards the living room. Stepping to the side slightly so that he could see inside the other room Eli turned back around to face her.</p>

<p>"Shakira," he replied unconcerned as he pulled on his shoes.</p>

<p>"What's she doing?" Karen asked oddly captivated by the blonde woman's pelvic gyrations.</p>

<p>"Rain dance?" Eli suggested straightening up. "Be back later." And with that he was gone, leaving Karen back to her contemplation of Jessie's contemplation of shaking half naked women who were apparently ready whenever, wherever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hey honey," Karen said finally deciding to actually enter the room instead of merely peeping.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie replied lifting her feet up so that Karen could sit down and then lowering them back down onto her lap.</p>

<p>"What are you up to?" Karen asked trying to keep her tone nice and light.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie responded. "You can tell by the part where I don't do anything." Karen didn't reply, her expression still focused on something in front of her. "That was a joke, you can laugh," Jessie continued staring at her mother. "Or you can ignore me completely and stare at the wall. Mom!" Jessie said rising up her foot and wiggling it in front of Karen's face. "Hello!"</p>

<p>Karen caught Jessie's wiggling foot and carefully lowered it back down to her lap, apologizing, saying that the TV just distracted her for a moment. </p>

<p>"Could you turn that off for a minute, honey?" Karen continued a second later. "I'd like to talk to you about something."</p>

<p>Jessie hesitated for a moment, looking between the television and her mother, truly torn about what she could do. While it was true that there was nothing good on at the moment, the television also `didn't want to talk to her for a moment'. Jessie had a thing with the `I just want to talk to you for moment' cause it never ended up well. Finally, realizing that she didn't really have a choice in the matter she picked up the remote and turned the television off, turning to face her mother with a look of trepidation on her face.</p>

<p>"What?" she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to tell you, that you can tell me anything," Karen started, her tone serious but full of tenderness. "No matter what it is. If there's anything on your mind, or anything that's happening with you that's important to you, you can always come and talk to me about it. You're my daughter and nothing, absolutely nothing in this world could ever make me stop loving you. You'll always be my baby," Karen continued staring at Jessie's confused little angelic face trying to remain somewhat composed.</p>

<p>"I love you too," Jessie said slowly, eyeing her mother uncertainly. She didn't know where that had come from, and frankly it kind of creped her out. It was like someone was dying or something.</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want to tell me?" Karen asked realizing that she was going to have to lead Jessie if she wanted to actually have a conversation.</p>

<p>"About what?" Jessie asked. She was starting to feel suspicious again.</p>

<p>"About anything," Karen replied, noting the slightly defensive tone in Jessie's voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jessie responded wondering what her mother was getting at. "I guess inflation kind of sucks."</p>

<p>"Does Katie think inflation sucks," Karen responded.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jessie said slowly, kind of thrown by her mother bringing Katie up. "I would think so. I mean doesn't everyone?"</p>

<p>Karen nodded her head, letting the room fall into silence for a moment as she thought about how things were going so far. Or not going as the case was. Sighing she realized that there could be no beating around the bush with this, if they were going to talk about what was happening, then she was going to have to be direct with Jessie. She was the adult after all.</p>

<p>"So," Karen began a moment later, one of her hands tickling Jessie's feet and making her squirm. "Is she your girlfriend?"</p>

<p>She felt Jessie's body go rigid the moment the question came out of her mouth, and Jessie pulled her feet away, digging them into the couch cushions away from Karen's touch.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Jessie asked now sitting with her knees tucked up against her body.</p>

<p>"Is she your girlfriend?" Karen asked again.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by girlfriend?" Jessie asked. "It's a versatile term with many and various implications from use to use."</p>

<p>"Is she who you were talking about?" Karen clarified. "In the hospital?"</p>

<p>Jessie eyes dropped from her mothers face down into a deep study of her partially covered feet. She truly hadn't anticipated being thrust into a situation like this. She'd figured if, when, they talked about her and Katie it'd be because she brought it up, or someone walked in on them doing something. Never in a million years had she figured that her mother would actually figure it out for herself. Or that if she did, she would actually want to talk about it.</p>

<p>"Um," was what she managed to choke out a few seconds later.</p>

<p>Karen took a deep breath at this response from Jessie and reached out her hand placing her hand on her daughter's knee. It was true then, in some way or another they were involved romantically.</p>

<p>"It's okay," Karen, said softly, her thumb moving in what she hoped was a soothing pattern on her knee, her mind racing in thought about the implications. Even though she thought that she had seen signs, even though over the past few days she had read books and felt that she was suitably prepared to deal with any eventuality, a little part of her had always assumed that it wasn't true. That she was just being paranoid as usual and Jessie would glare at her for a moment before shaking her head and telling her she was so stupid.</p>

<p>"Is it?" Jessie asked, her voice small as she tentatively glanced up at her mother a few seconds after Karen's gentle words. "Or are you just saying that, and really inside you want to cry, and think you did something wrong?" she continued staring at her mother intently.</p>

<p>"It is," Karen replied meeting Jessie's gaze and holding it for a moment before continuing. She was lying of course, the tight feeling in the pit of her stomach and the burning in her eyes as she struggled to hold back tears, indicated to her strongly that she was in fact not okay with anything. But that was her problem to struggle with, not Jessie's, and she truly believed that given more time to adjust, she would be okay with it, and it was this belief that allowed her to continue. "I'm not going to give you the speech where I tell you that it's going to be a harder road, or that it's not what I would've chosen for you," she continued, "because I think that you probably have a better idea about all of that than I do."</p>

<p>Jessie merely made some sound in the back of her throat that vaguely sounded like an affirmative, and then rested her head down on her knees.</p>

<p>"And I'm not going to ask if you're happy," Karen continued. "Because I can see that you are … maybe not at this moment," she admitted, "but that you have been. And I'm not going to give you my blessing, because you have it. You always have it," she finished her voice choked but full of love.</p>

<p>"But," Jessie mumbled around the material of her pants blinking rapidly. She knew that there was a `but' coming.</p>

<p>"We have to talk about some things," Karen responded stealing herself for what was about to come. After the talk they'd had about Jessie's lack of feelings for Tad she had assumed that her daughter was just a late bloomer, and that she would be spared having to have this conversation for a few years. She was wrong. "Especially with this dance coming up," she continued knowing very well what generally went on after dances in backseats and motel rooms.</p>

<p>Jessie was silent for a moment, then her head shot up as she realized where this conversation was most likely going. "Oh god, we're not going to have the sex talk are we?" she asked clearly horrified by the prospect of having to discuss anything like this with her mother. "Cause we had it already in gym class. Like three years in a row."</p>

<p>"You had the generic sex talk, the manual in the seat pocket talk," Karen told her blithely. "Now, now the captain is speaking."</p>

<p>"I don't…" Jessie started shaking her head as if that would ward off what was to come.</p>

<p>"Have a choice? That's right," Karen responded wishing that she could just leave it at that, but the good parent inside of her knowing that they had to talk and set down some ground rules. "Now," she said taking a deep cleansing breath. "Your father mentioned a sleepover a few weeks ago," she started really wishing that there were a paper bag around her somewhere. "Have you and…"</p>

<p>"No!" Jessie exclaimed in a mortified half sob. "Can we PLEASE not talk about this?" she went on her voice rising with distress, before she buried her face down behind her knees.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank god," Karen breathed out clearly relieved to a degree that she didn't have words to express, that her baby hadn't yet been deflowered. Quite frankly she wasn't certain she would have been able to handle learning that Jessie had … with her nerves already so frazzled. "And no."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed again, but at which statement Karen wasn't sure.</p>

<p>"First, no more sleepovers," she continued, her face an authoritative mask when Jessie's head snapped up ready to protest. However, seeing the look on her mother's face she glumly nodded waiting for Karen to continue. "At either house," Karen added as an after thought realizing the loophole she may have lain open.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell dad?" Jessie asked ignoring Karen's addition to rule one.</p>

<p>"I won't tell him, no," Karen responded slowly. "If he doesn't figure it out on his own, then that's something you should tell him," she continued struggling to get the words out as it went against every fiber of her being. She wanted to tell Rick, she wanted to point and poke at him, and ask him how he couldn't know what was happening, and many other things that she could feel but not articulate. She wanted someone to share her confusion. But the books had said that this was the best way to go about handling things, and Karen figured that they knew what they were talking about. And it had to be about Jessie, it always had to be about Jessie. "However, I would suggest that you tell him, but I'm not going to force you too until you're ready," she went on. "That being said, if you don't tell him, do not expect to be able to get away with anything over there that you can't here. Because despite what the after school specials tell you, divorced parents still DO talk to each other."</p>

<p>Jessie merely nodded, relieved at least to know that she wouldn't be forced into talking to her dad about it yet. "What's second?" she asked finally resigning herself to Karen's rules.</p>

<p>"Um," Karen responded not quite sure where to go from here. Even though she had planned to have this conversation with Jessie, she realized at that moment for the first time how much she had truly believed that nothing would come of her questions. She hadn't even considered what she would want to do about the situation if it was true, hadn't been able to force herself to consider it. But here it was, and she was feeling quite lost, which pretty much fit the pattern of her life as of late. "I guess that thing about your dad can be second," she continued stalling for time.</p>

<p>"Oh," Jessie replied, chancing a glance at her mother. Karen was sitting with her back ramrod straight and her eyes facing downwards to her lap. She was playing with the fingers of her left hand, and Jessie swore that she could see her shaking faintly. "Okay then," she continued with a sigh. Despite her words, Jessie could tell that Karen wasn't really fine with anything but was merely doing her best to make her think that she was. </p>

<p>She tried to curl her body tighter around itself, but she had no more room left to maneuver on that front.</p>

<p>"Three," Karen continued feeling a desperate need to lighten the mood in the room a bit, for her sake and for Jessie's. "Don't do anything your brother would do," she dictated with a smile even though her words were a bit shaky. Jessie lifted up her head at this, staring a Karen for a moment before tentatively grinning, then smiling full- blown she recalled all of Eli's girl problems.</p>

<p>"Can she still come over?" Jessie asked softly, the worry in her voice that she may not be able to spend time with Katie anymore painfully evident to Karen. She realized that Jessie must have been picking up on some of her anxiety and had to struggle to suppress the urge to sigh. She was doing a wonderful job of this.</p>

<p>"Of course," Karen responded trying to keep her voice light to alleviate some of her daughters concern. "But not when I'm not home."</p>

<p>"But Eli…" Jessie started to protest forgetting the supposed delicacy of her situation for a moment, the clear injustice of the statement catching the ire of her teenage indignation.</p>

<p>"Rule number three," Karen retorted interrupting Jessie's objection.</p>

<p>"Fine," Jessie mumbled shooting Karen a disgruntled look nonetheless, before continuing. "So you're really okay with this?" she asked still not sounding at all convinced. "I mean what about…" she started say trailing off gradually lost in thought.</p>

<p>"What about what?" Karen asked gently.</p>

<p>"Your plans and stuff?" Jessie replied almost inaudibly. That fear that she would disappoint her parents somehow, that she wouldn't be good enough for them, now raring it's monstrous head once again, as every conversation she'd ever had with her mother about weddings, and boys, and children played loudly in her head, mocking her with her failure.</p>

<p>"The plans haven't changed," Karen, responded softly, though her heart was heavy, desperately waiting for the day that she could truly believe that, "just the generic figure in them with you. It's more shapely now," she went on trying not to think of how much it actually hurt her that the figure had changed, and getting mad at herself for being hurt about it.</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at her and smiled. "Shapely?" she asked highly amused, Karen's antiquated choice of words momentarily breaking through the dark cloud that had been hanging over her head since they had started talking.</p>

<p>"Shapely," Karen confirmed, realizing that she must have emitted some kind of uncool mom sound into the world, thereby causing Jessie to internally mock her. If that was the case, so be it, she had made peace with the idea.</p>

<p>"Can we go down to the speakeasy later to hang with all the cool cats?" Jessie asked grinning madly through the occasional sniffle.</p>

<p>"That's going to cost you," Karen said turning around to face Jessie an evil smile working it's way across her face, her cloud momentarily parting as well.</p>

<p>"How much?" Jessie asked with some trepidation, the tension that had been running through her body from the beginning of the conversation slowly beginning to ease now. She was glad, she hadn't realized how tense she was, she had certainly been only moments away from rupturing something.</p>

<p>"A tickle and three kisses," Karen said solemnly, willing to let the stress of their conversation slide away for the moment.</p>

<p>"Oh come on," Jessie whined as Karen reached out for her with outstretched wiggling fingers. "This is like cruel and usual punishment," she cried out as her mother tickled her.</p>

<p>"Where did you get your law degree?" Karen asked laughing as Jessie squealed under her fingers.</p>

<p>"Bought it off the internet," Jessie replied trying to roll herself off the couch so that she could make a getaway, but she soon found herself trapped and just gave into the inevitable. Sometimes it sucked being the baby of the family, but these were just the sacrifices she was destined to make.</p>

<p>Katie took Jessie's hand into hers; drawing it upwards against her face, placing a soft kiss on Jessie's palm before looking down into her big, blue, terrified eyes. "We don't have to go in," Katie said softly, her voice nonetheless carrying in the empty hallways making it almost painfully loud. "Seriously," she continued. "It's like an Oscar, being asked is enough."</p>

<p>"But everyone wants to win," Jessie responded stepping closer to Katie, pressing their bodies together sighing gently as she felt Katie's arm wrap around her. "I wouldn't have asked you if I didn't want to go."</p>

<p>"Okay," Katie whispered, her hands moving across Jessie's back slowly. It was one of those times where she just needed to give Jessie a moment. To sort out or accept whatever it was she was feeling at the moment. She had learned, as they spent more time together how deeply everything affected Jessie, how sensitive she was to everything around her. She herself was deeply affected by things as well, her mother's depression and the stress it was causing within her family, hadn't left her as unaffected as she tried to project. But she had learned somewhere down the road how to push it aside, how to put on a brave face and march like a good little soldier. But Jessie lived in a glass house where everything was visible, every wound, and every scar there for the world to see if they cared to look. She sometimes felt about as deep as a puddle around Jessie, but she loved that about her. She had learned that it sometimes meant that it took Jessie longer to settle things, that sometimes you just needed to give her time and quiet. So she held her, and waited for her to move. </p>

<p>"Ready?" Katie asked feeling Jessie shift in her arms and begin to move out of them, stepping back.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said reaching out for Katie's hand, grasping it in hers.</p>

<hr>

<p> "Can I borrow her for a minute or twenty?" Katie asked coming up behind Jessie, though her gaze was focused on Grace whom her girlfriend had been talking to. "They're about to play our song," she continued turning her head to face Jessie.</p>

<p>"We have a song?" Jessie asked smiling as Katie stepped into view.</p>

<p>"You'll see," Katie responded cryptically. "I had to promise the DJ my first born, so we've got to get out there and enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Sounds serious, you better go," Grace responded smiling at the display as she heard a few soft cords start up in the background. Jessie smiled back at her and then Katie took her by the hand, leading her out to the dance floor.</p>

<p>"Billie Holiday?" Jessie asked smiling as Katie wrapped her arms around her waist pulling her closer.</p>

<p>"God Bless the Child," Katie responded resting her forehead against Jessie's as a smile etched it's way across her features. "That's got her own, that's got her own," Katie whispered brushing her lips across Jessie's.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled as they pulled apart burying her head in the crook of Katie's neck as they swayed to the soulful sounds of Billie Holiday. The room faded, the voices of the others in the room faded, the lights and everything else except the voice and the feel of Katie against her faded into the background. And Jessie took a deep breath, inhaling Katie's scent letting the sensations wash over her and carry her away to a magical place covered in gardenias where the sun shone on your face all day long. So this was love, she thought to herself as she felt Katie's cheek press against her own, so this is love.</p>

<p>"Billie?" Katie whispered softly into her air as they moved together. "Sing for me?"</p>

<hr>

<p>Jessie pulled back her hand shaking her head slightly as she tried to get her hand to stop trembling. She didn't know why but she just couldn't stop tingling, it was as if every nerve ending in her body was on fire, and to her consternation she learned that that led to a loss of fine motor control. She'd been standing in front of the punch bowl trying to get a drink for over a minute now.</p>

<p>"That was quite a show," Jessie turned her head at the sound of the unfamiliar voice beside her. Her eyes focusing on the figure she soon recognized as Sarah Grasser. "You're a big woman on campus now aren't you?" Sarah continued when Jessie merely stared at her. "The newest thing. Katie's new hoola hoop."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Jessie said moving to take a step back. The last thing she wanted to do was talk to Sarah and her lemon juice thereby blighting her otherwise perfect night.</p>

<p>"You don't get it do you?" Sarah asked stepping in front of her effectively blocking her path.</p>

<p>"Move," Jessie said softly, her eyes meeting Sarah's. "Now."</p>

<p>"She's like a three year old. Always looking for some new, shiny toy … that she'll forget about three months later," Sarah continued holding Jessie's gaze and not moving so much as a centimeter. "She's like the sun, shining down on you, warming you until you think she'll always be there. But she won't, she'll go away and leave you shivering in the dark. It's her nature," she finished her head turning to the side, drawing Jessie's eyes with her to where a group of people who were gathered around Katie. Orbiting her.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about," Jessie said looking away and back over at Sarah. "She's not like that."</p>

<p>"Let me guess," Sarah started mockingly. "What you have together is special," she continued smiling coldly. "How did she do Sammler, huh? Poetry? Love letters?" Sarah went on, seeing Jessie's eyes flicker at the mention of love letters and smiling to herself. "Katouschka," she went on noting the look of jealously that flashed in Jessie's eyes at her use of her old nickname for Katie, "is a player. She only loves one thing, Katouschka. And if you don't think that you're going to end up being cast away into the land of misfit toys then you're not nearly as smart as everyone says you are." "T...that's not…" Jessie started, her words catching in her mouth before she could push them out. She could feel tears beginning to well in her eyes, and fought down the sick feeling in her stomach.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's going on?" Katie asked coming up behind the two, resting her hand on Jessie's shoulder as she looked between the two of them, not liking what she saw at all.</p>

<p>"Just chatting," Sarah responded smiling callously at Katie, her smile only growing when she saw Katie's eyes narrow with displeasure.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go find somebody else to talk to," Katie suggested, her voice a low grumble. She couldn't believe that this was the same girl she had been friend's with only months ago, she hardly recognized Sarah anymore, like the other girl had suddenly changed personalities one night leaving this imposter in place of her friend. It killed her that they had to fight like this, but she wasn't going to let Sarah abuse Jessie because of a mistake that she had made.</p>

<p>"What are you? Viceroy of Sammlerland?" Sarah asked arching an eyebrow at Katie. "She can't chose who she wants to talk to," she continued her eyes flittering over to Jessie. "Do you have to ask her permission to go to the washroom too?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you be off to see the Wizard? You know about that heart problem?" Katie asked her gaze practically causing Sarah's dress to start smoking. Sarah huffed in response, giving Katie and Jessie one last contemptuous look over before raising her head and walking away.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Katie asked as soon as Sarah was out of air shot, adjusting her position so that she could see Jessie's face.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Fine," Jessie replied straightening her shoulders, but Katie had spent enough time around her, watching her, to know that her response was utter crap.</p>

<p>"Alright," she responded carefully. "Then why don't we go get some fresh air?"</p>

<p>"What did she say?" Katie asked worriedly looking over at Jessie. The other girl had hardly said a word to her after they left the gym, and they had already lapped the field once now in complete silence.</p>

<p>"Were you in love with her?" Jessie said careful to keep her tone neutral. Between the way Sarah had been acting towards her from when they first met on the play and today, and Grace's statement about how she and Katie had been madly in love with each other, Jessie was beginning to wonder if there was some truth to it. She just couldn't fathom Sarah acting the way that she was if they hadn't been together, she couldn't conceive of any other reason for the pain and anger that laced the girls every word.</p>

<p>"With Sarah?" Katie asked, her tone indecipherable.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded quietly.</p>

<p>"No," Katie replied a moment later, her eyes drifting around the open field before them before she continued. "But she was. With me. At least that's what she said afterwards," she continued sighing softly. "We'd always kinda talked, but last summer … I don't know, I guess we just started hanging out more…common bond or something," she went on playing with her index finger nervously. "One night, we were down in her basement listening to music or something and she kissed me, and it felt better than any kiss I'd had before so I let her do it again. It didn't really change anything … as far as I was concerned. I liked her, but no more than my luggage," she said recalling a line from one of her favorite movies. "I guess it changed things for her though. She got attached, way attached. Way more than me. I guess I led her on, cause I'd kiss her too sometimes … but I was just playing around. I didn't realize how serious she was until after the play started. Until after I met you.</p>

<p>"She knew, you know, that I liked you. And that's when she started getting all pissy. I'm sure you remember," Katie continued sighing at the memory of Sarah harassing Jessie about anything she could think of whenever they were in the same room. "After one of the fittings, I took her outside to ask her what the hell she thought she was doing. I was pretty upset, I'd wanted to make a good impression," she went on shaking her head. "She started crying and yelling at me, asking if I thought she was stupid. I had no idea what she was talking about, and just asked her why she had to try and ruin things, you know, any chance I had to get to know you. She looked like I'd slapped her across the face or something, and that's when I knew that she'd been in totally different place to me on whatever it was we were doing. She walked away, and that was that," Katie finished finally gathering up the nerve to look over at Jessie. </p>

<p>"So you didn't get bored of her?" Jessie asked her eyes focused on the ground as it depressed under her feet. </p>

<p>"No," Katie said surprised. "Is that what she told you? That I used her or something?"</p>

<p>"She said you were a player," Jessie admitted softly. "That I was just the newest thing."</p>

<p>"Player?" Katie repeated incredulously, as if she didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the description. Shaking her head, she turned to glance at Jessie who was still staring at her feet as they walked along, looking no happier than when they first exited the gym. "You believed her?" Katie said softly, her stomach suddenly feeling queasy. "You're still wondering if it's true, if you're just … convenient."</p>

<p>"I didn't," Jessie replied immediately hearing Katie's tone. "I don't," she continued, but her denial lacked a certain conviction and Katie picked up on it, on the hesitation, on the lack of feeling behind the words.</p>

<p>"Do you…" Katie started coming to a stop. "How could you think that this is game for me?" she asked her voice rising, the pain she was feeling at the attack on her character, her motivations, and her feelings hitting Jessie like an arrow to the heart.</p>

<p>"I don't," Jessie said, her voice vehement this time as she stepped towards Katie.</p>

<p>Katie flinched away from Jessie taking another step back, her eyes accusing as she spoke. "But you did, you did believe her," she responded.</p>

<p> "It wasn't that I thought you were using me," Jessie replied stepping towards Katie again only to have the other girl take another step back. "I was just scared." </p>

<p>"That I was using you," Katie supplied somewhat bitterly. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded matter of factly. "But it didn't really have anything to do with you. I hadn't thought about rationally or decided anything. And I didn't think that Sarah was such an upstanding citizen or something, I just," Jessie said her voice cracking with emotion. "I just got really scared, like crazy scared, that I would wake up one day … and not be your girl," she went on struggling to hold back tears. "I didn't believe it, but it freaked me anyway, cause being with you is like the best thing that's ever happened to me. And the thought … the idea of not being with you terrifies me. I mean, you're the first thing I think about when I wake up, if I wasn't already thinking about you, and when you're around like even silence is like good, and …" </p>

<p>"Jessie," Katie said gently taking a step forward and placing her hand on Jessie's shoulder. "Stop," she continued biting her bottom lip. "I get it. I do," she went on softly. "I…I feel the same way. About you. You're like my sun. And it's like if you ever stopped shining on me I would … I don't know, but it'd really really, really, suck." </p>

<p>"Really?" Jessie asked smiling through the tears that had started to run down her face as she spoke. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded. "Totally," and then Jessie's lips were on hers and they were kissing. Messily, hungrily, desperately bringing their lips together as they clung to one and other like life preservers. </p>

<p> "I don't want to go back in there," Jessie said softly when they broke apart. </p>

<p>"Then we won't," Katie replied smiling as she took Jessie's hand into hers. "Come on." </p>

<hr>

<p>Jessie tipped her head back, pressing her lips against the soft skin of Katie's neck and keeping them there for a minute as she felt her girlfriends low moan reverberate through her. Smiling, she turned slightly in Katie's arms and rested her head on her shoulder contentedly. After leaving the school they'd driven out to a place Katie liked to call `her own little piece of nowhere' and gotten out of the car. Katie had left the radio on and they'd settled down on the ground, somehow coming to be in the position they were currently occupying. Katie sitting with her back leaned up against a tree, and Jessie curled up warmly in her arms. And there they sat quietly together, in their own little garden.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Jessie mumbled into Katie's shoulder minutes or maybe hours after they arrived.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked, her voice sounding dreamlike and far away.</p>

<p>"I love this song," Jessie replied happily taking Katie's hand into her own as the music swept over her.</p>

<p>"Some say a heart is just like a wheel When you bend it, you can't mend it And my love for you is like a sinking ship And my heart is like that ship out in mid ocean</p>

<p>They say that death is a tragedy It comes once and it's over But my only wish is for that deep dark abyss 'Cause what's the use of living with no true lover</p>

<p>And it's only love, and it's only love That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out"</p>

<p>A gentle evening breeze. Rustling leaves. "I think I'm in love with you."</p>

<p>A smile with closed eyes, pressing closer. "I was just thinking the same thing."</p>

<p><i><u>School – Monday</u></i></p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie called back smiling before turning her attention back to Grace with a somewhat uncertain expression. That was like the tenth person that she didn't know to greet her since she'd walked into the school building that morning. "I didn't start spitting gold or something did I?" Jessie asked stepping closer to Grace unconsciously. She didn't like this newfound visibility. It was jarring.</p>

<p>"In a way," Grace replied watching Jessie with a touch of amusement. "It's what you get for dating the most popular girl in school, instant celebrity and a new and lower class of poser, user friends. Congratulations."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't it be more like the cause a major social backspace?" Jessie asked not quite able to wrap her mind around how on the planet earth dating a girl could increase her popularity. It boggled the mind. "Shouldn't I be spray painting over slurs on my locker or something?" she asked, having truly anticipated a less than enthusiastic response upon returning to school after the dance. She didn't think that there was going to be like major violence or something, but she'd expected snide comments and sideways look at least.</p>

<p>"Inevitably, there's going to be some asshole that's going to think it's funny or something to bother you about, but I wouldn't expect much of that. Everybody's already thought that Katie was gay for like a year and nobody gave or is likely to give a shit. It's 2002 and queer or not someone like Katie …"</p>

<p>"What do you mean someone like Katie?" Jessie asked not quite sure what to make of Grace's statement or tone.</p>

<p>"Someone beautiful and personable, with just the right touch of mystery to make everyone go `oooh ahhhh'," Grace replied shortly. "Adoration is like in her DNA or something, when the doctor let her mother hold her for the first time he probably told her to start preparing for house party's, and when she got dumped in the room with the other babies she got like invited to a kegger like as soon as the nurse left," she continued. "Plus, it's a universally known fact that dating cool makes you cool. So as long as the golden girl, is your girl you better get used to the celebrity," Grace finished wishing that she had to adjust to problems like Jessie's. Oh, my significant other is breathtakingly beautiful and popular, and would crawl fifty miles over broken glass to sweat in my shadow, and everybody loves me and I just won a million dollars and discovered a cure for cancer. Woe is me, Grace thought to herself sullenly.</p>

<p>"But I haven't changed," Jessie pointed out in what could be argued to be a whine if one cared to argue about such things.</p>

<p>"But you have. Over the weekend you became like ninety percent more interesting. Because as far as everyone's concerned if Katie sees something in you, then there must be something worth seeing," Grace replied running out of steam to pep talk Jessie into liking popularity. "You're in. Enjoy it," she finished trying not to sound as bitter as she was starting to fell. "Later," and with that she took off down the hall to find her class, or a big hole, whichever she came across first.</p>

<hr>

<p> "How could you do this to me?" Tad whispered harshly flinging Katie's hand off of his shoulder and backing them up underneath the stairs away from prying eyes. "Everyone knows," he continued whispering. "I'm a fucking joke!"</p>

<p>"I didn't DO anything," Katie responded defensively, taken back by his response. "You had your chance, she didn't like you," she went on in a like tone. "You had every opportunity. Hell, I helped set you up!"</p>

<p>Tad sighed in acknowledgement of the fact that Katie really couldn't be blamed for Jessie not wanting to date him, after all it wasn't like he was going to consider major surgery for her or anything. But that didn't mean she was off the hook. "You could have told me at least," he said running an agitated hand through his hair. "I still thought I had a chance…I… Russell's been harassing me ever since the dance. I mean do you have any idea what it's like for the entire school to know some chick stole your girlfriend?" he said getting worked up again.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Katie exclaimed. "I didn't steal anything. She's not a fucking VCR!"</p>

<p>"You don't even get it do you?" Tad asked pissed off by Katie's attempt at comedy. "I'm on the football team!"</p>

<p>"What?" Katie whispered back at him totally confused. "The football team? Oh, hi left field nice to see you too. What are you talking about?" she continued peevishly.</p>

<p>"I'm …" Tad started agitatedly, he's eyes scanning the hallways. "I…" he said, stopping abruptly, his eyes focused behind Katie.</p>

<p>"You're what?" Katie asked turning around to see what had distracted him and spotting Jessie moving towards them.</p>

<p>"I'm going," he muttered shooting her one last contemptible look before pushing past both girls.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie said softly, resting her hand on Katie's waist as she studied her girlfriends clouded features. "Is everything alright?" she asked leaning into her slightly.</p>

<p>Katie sighed as she felt Jessie's body against her, the tension flowing out of her body like the tide as Jessie's voice reached her ears. "Yeah," she breathed out a moment later, wondering at the effect Jessie was able to have on her. "But only because I have like the best girlfriend in the history of the universe."</p>

<p>"That's a lot of history," Jessie commented pulling back slightly to observe Katie's face. </p>

<p>"I'm aware of that," Katie responded with a small smile making no attempt to alter her statement any.</p>

<p>"You sure everything's okay?" Jessie asked, still clearly able to see worry etched over Katie's features.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I mean, Tad's just pissed off because I didn't tell him about us, and his friends are harassing him cause you ditched him for a chick," Katie replied sounding rather lost. She really hadn't anticipated him getting upset, though thinking about she realized she probably should have. She was just too busy thinking about Jessie all the time to realize that he had still been thinking about her too.</p>

<p>"I didn't ditch him for you," Jessie responded truthfully. "I ditched him cause he's a lunk," she continued causing Katie to laugh momentarily before quieting down again.</p>

<p>"He doesn't see it that way," Katie replied. "What is with the people at this school?" she asked tiredly. "Everyone like seriously over-estimates the power of my charms."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," Jessie replied thinking that she liked Katie's charms over-estimated or not. "You did get the girl," she continued with a smile. "Don't worry, I'm sure he'll be over it by lunch."</p>

<p>"You think?" Katie asked hopefully. While it was true that Tad was nothing to write home about, he was *her* nothing to write home about – in a manner of speaking. They'd been friends since Power Rangers was cool, and she'd kind of gotten used to having him around, annoying as he may be.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded though she seriously had no idea. Tad didn't strike her as the sort with a long enough attention span to hold a grudge for too long, but the truth was there was no way she could know how long he'd be angry. The only thing she knew was that there was no sense worrying about it cause there was nothing they could do to change it.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie repeated more for her own benefit than any other reason. She knew what Jessie was trying to do, and she was willing to accept it. "So," she continued deciding to move on to greener pastures. "How about I officially walk you to class?"</p>

<p>"I officially like that idea," Jessie agreed smiling as Katie reached down for her hand.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey," Katie said stopping Jill Mason as they passed her in the hallway. "Don't forget about `Sebastian's' tonight."</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah your worship, I know," Jill replied grinning as her gaze shifted over to Jessie and then down to their loosely joined hands. "Hey," she said addressing Jessie who merely nodded not quite sure what etiquette demanded out of her. She would make a horrible trophy wife, she was certain of that now. "Anyway," Jill continued her attention back on Katie, "you should make sure to remind Phil. He lost his pad of post-its and now he's completely hopeless."</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll track him down," Katie responded frowning slightly at the mention of Phil and his stupid post-it notes. He was such a jackass.</p>

<p>"Sweet. Later," Jill called glancing at Jessie once more before whacking Katie on the back playfully and taking off down the hall, Jessie's eyes following her as she went.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Katie asked noticing Jessie staring off down the hall after Jill.</p>

<p>"She talked to me," Jessie replied as if it was comparable to finding a bar of solid gold up her ass.</p>

<p>"So?" Katie responded. "I talk to you all the time, and you only occasionally look at me like that," she continued receiving a slap on the arm for her trouble.</p>

<p>"I mean, I've been getting that all day. Strange people that I've never even seen before, are like waving and saying hi to me and stuff," Jessie responded. "Grace says it's because I'm your girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Is that what Grace says?" Katie asked not quite sure were Jessie was going with this.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie replied with a small frown. "Which is weird, people being all nice because of something so periphery."</p>

<p>"First you stare at someone else's ass and now I'm periphery," Katie grumbled teasingly. "I'm beginning to wonder if this official class walking thing was such a good idea."</p>

<p>"Will focus for like five seconds?" Jessie asked smiling to show she was only kidding. "I'm waxing philosophy here."</p>

<p>"Sorry," Katie replied properly whipped, wondering if the garbage needed to be taken out. "How do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>"Weird," Jessie replied smiling a bit.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I caught that," Katie responded rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>"How do you do it?" Jessie asked. "How do you deal with not knowing whether someone's talking to you because they really like you, or if they're just doing it to get close to who you are or who you're with?"</p>

<p>"You just get used to it," Katie replied seriously. "Most times I don't even think the people that are doing it know whether they like you or just the image of you. Which makes it a real bitch for anyone else to figure out. After a while you just kind of learn to sense the really fake ones … if you're lucky, and everyone else gets the surface material."</p>

<p>"That sucks," Jessie replied softly a moment later, wondering how Katie managed to deal with it day in and out.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Katie admitted remembering how alone she had felt, keeping everything that she was feeling to herself because she didn't know which of her `friends' actually cared enough for her to tell them anything. "And sometimes not so much," she continued smiling down at Jessie adoringly, also remembering what a revelation it had been to be really able to talk to Jessie, to find someone who was interested in more than the surface material.</p>

<p>"Stop it," Jessie said laughing as Katie continued to stare at her, her expression now humorously doting.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Katie asked batting her eyes and sighing dreamily.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" Jessie exclaimed still smiling as they continued through the halls.</p>

<p><i><u>Booklover's (a.k.a. Judy's bookstore)</u></i></p>

<p>Judy sat down across from an amazingly quiet Karen pushing an abnormally sized cup of coffee across the table to her. Karen had come in about ten minutes ago, quietly asking Judy if they could talk, but once they sat down Karen had just started staring at the tabletop, glancing up apologetically every couple of seconds. Judy had suggested that she just needed to get a little caffeine in her system, but as she sat across from the quietly sipping woman she wondered if that was true. Karen was, well she usually looked perturbed and slightly worried, like the weight of the world never left her but merely shifted, however this seemed more serious to Judy. </p>

<p>"You have to promise that this is going to stay, just between us," Karen said seriously looking up at Judy. Because of Judy's friendship with her, and the fact that Lily was her sister, Karen was aware that a lot of information got shared between everyone due to Judy's dual relationships. She just had to make sure that this wouldn't be one of those times.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Judy responded realizing that Karen meant `don't tell Lily', "of course."</p>

<p>"Jessie," Karen started softly. "She went to the dance Grace planned."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Judy responded smiling obliviously. "Lily to told me. We all think it's really great that Jessie's supporting Grace like that. I guess they really are getting closer, I hadn't believed it but it looks like they've come along way since the play."</p>

<p>"Supporting Grace?" Karen asked with a touch of confusion. She wasn't exactly sure what Judy was talking about.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I mean it's good. That Grace has got someone to help her through this. Cause it's got to be hard, you know. But at least she's got the club to help her sort through things, and it's got to help her to know that Jessie is there for her."</p>

<p>Karen was quite for a moment, and then let out a bark of laughter she quickly reigned in when Judy looked up at her sharply.</p>

<p>"Lily," Karen started. "You … you think that Grace is gay?"</p>

<p>"Well she did join the club," Judy said somewhat defensively. "And she hasn't been seeing anyone, and she's really defensive about people being able to love whoever they want," she went on. "I mean, it's easy for you, your daughter's dating a fine piece of football player," Judy continued stopping only when she noticed Karen's face fall at her mention of Tad. "What?" </p>

<p>"I don't think that Lily has anything to worry about," Karen replied running a hand through her hair. "Grace isn't gay," Karen continued wrapping her hands around the coffee cup, soaking in the warmth. Judy opened her mouth to respond but Karen pressed on before she could speak, or she could lose her nerve. "Jessie is."</p>

<p>Judy's mouth opened, then closed. Then opened again, before closing once more as her eyes bugged out missing Guinness records by a pinch. "But Jessie didn't join the club," Judy got out eventually.</p>

<p>"I don't really think that club membership is a conclusive indicator," Karen responded wearily. "From a rant Jessie went on a while back, it seems Grace joined because of some guy she has a crush on."</p>

<p>"Oh," Judy responded, her mind still trying to adjust to what Karen was saying. "Oh. But, Jessie? Aren't she and Tad…"</p>

<p>Karen merely shook her head, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. </p>

<p>"But how do you know?" Judy persisted surprised but intrigued but what Karen was telling her.</p>

<p>"I asked her," Karen admitted taking another sip of her coffee.</p>

<p>"And she just told you. Just like that?" Judy asked sounding rather incredulous.</p>

<p>"I already knew," Karen, replied staring down into the cup, talking to herself more than Judy. "I didn't want to believe it, but after I heard … and I saw that flower and …" she started trailing off remembering how she had slowly trickled towards enlightenment. "And the way that they looked at each other," she continued with a sigh, remembering lingering … longing glances that at the time she had thought to be secretively and playful.</p>

<p>"She's seeing someone?" Judy asked nearly having a conniption. "How? Who? When … who?"</p>

<p>Karen smirked at Judy's reactions wondering if she had looked like that. If she had sounded like that. She certainly knew that she had felt like that. "Think about it," Karen urged quietly. "What's every other word out of her mouth? Who's practically attached to her hip?"</p>

<p>Judy scrunched her brows together as her mind searched for obscure people and phrases that she may have heard Jessie use, before Occum's Razor slashed her across the wrist and the simplest answer came pouring out of her. "Katie?" Judy asked looking up and over at Karen. "Jessie…and Katie. Together? Like that?"</p>

<p>"Like yes," Karen replied leaning back in her chair. "Like for a while. Like they went to the dance together," she continued her eyes drifting around the store.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Judy exclaimed, what Karen was saying sinking in with her for the first time. "Does Rick know?"</p>

<p>Karen shook her head, leaning forward once more and resting her elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"Well, you're going to tell him, right?" Judy asked. Karen shook her head again. "What? How can you not?"</p>

<p>"I promised Jessie I wouldn't," Karen replied shaking her head. "And the books said …"</p>

<p>"You've read books?" Judy asked surprised.</p>

<p>"I read many books," Karen said looking over at her. "I read books," she admitted a moment later, hanging her head down. "I didn't know what else to do, I mean they don't really cover this in the parenting classes, and I sure as hell didn't think to ask," she continued. "I mean who plans for this? Who looks at their baby girl and starts planning for commitment ceremonies?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Judy agreed. "Books would be good then," she continued nodding along. "So you're really not going to tell Rick?"</p>

<p>"I promised Jessie," Karen said again. "That she could … when she was ready. And she's not. If I hadn't figured it out," she went on shaking her head. "You should have seen her, she seemed so small. I," she stopped sighing tiredly. "I wish I could help her more but…"</p>

<p>"You're freaked?" Judy supplied.</p>

<p>Karen opened her mouth to protest, and then closed it. "Yeah. Pretty much," she finally responded with a derisive snort. "I thought … you know, when I heard those public service announcements, and saw `those very special episodes' that I wouldn't be like that. That if my kid was gay, I would perfectly fine with it and be all supportive, and we could march together and wear matching t-shirts. But at the same time I never considered that I would have to be. I was in the role of the supportive friend you know, I was to be doing the patting, not be patted."</p>

<p>"It's normal, your reaction," Judy said comfortingly reaching across the table. "Everyone has these dreams for their kids, these hopes and expectations, and when … when you're forced to change them … well, it's alright to mourn their loss," she continued squeezing Karen's hand sympathetically.</p>

<p>"She thinks I'm disappointed in her," Karen replied struggling to keep her voice steady. "That it makes me love her less. But nothing could be farther from the truth," she continued. "She's my baby. I love her more than life itself, and nothing could ever change that. I just feel like she doesn't believe that, and I can't for the life of me figure out how to make her."</p>

<p>"You've just got to give yourself time," Judy responded, congratulating herself for having HBO and thus material to reference to comfort. "Those moms and dads that you see out there marching, and speaking at schools and wearing buttons, they were all sitting where you are now," she continued thoughtfully. "They all went through it, but they overcame it. You will too, it'll just take time. I mean it takes people years to realize they're gay," Judy went on, Karen's mind drifting to Jessie talking about how she didn't understand why she wasn't interested in dating boys. "It's only understandable that it takes parents some time to get used to the idea too. The most important thing is that you do love her. The rest will come with time."</p>

<p>"So I'm not a bad mother?" Karen asked looking over at her, quite relieved to hear that she wasn't some sort of hopeless bigot for not doing cartwheels upon learning of Jessie's relationship.</p>

<p>"No," Judy said shaking her head. "She's lucky to have you."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I just don't think it's possible to do that with a gerbil. Not because some pervert wouldn't try it, but because the gerbil would probably have a problem with that. If I was the gerbil I know I would," was what Karen and Judy heard as they approached the front of the house.</p>

<p>Turning the corner they saw Jessie and Katie sitting on the porch with they're bags resting in front of them.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Judy asked looking at them strangely, not because of what Karen had told her or because of the conversation they had been having, but because it was extremely odd for them to be sitting out there.</p>

<p>"Forgot my keys," Jessie ground out starring up at her mother with a look that could wilt flowers. Karen looked away from her making a beeline for the door, realizing that they were out there because of rule number three and that Jessie wasn't at all happy about it.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get a spare made and hide it around here somewhere," Karen mumbled as she unlocked the door, still feeling Jessie's eyes burning holes into her back. Unlocking the door she quickly stepped inside. Maybe they could revisit rule three, she thought to herself as the rest of them followed her inside.</p>

<hr>

<p> "So," Karen started carefully. "You're the one that introduced Jessie to Billie Holiday?" she continued trying to find the route to pumping Katie for information. Now that she knew the girl was dating her daughter she wanted all of the information on her that she could get.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded resting against the kitchen counter as Judy lounged beside her and Karen made coffee. Dr. Rosenfeld had called needing to reschedule Jessie's appoint for the week, so she had run upstairs to call her dad to arrange a new day. "She's great isn't she?" Katie went on sounding like she was going to swoon. "Most kids don't like the classic stuff, but I think it's great. You just don't hear stuff like that anymore, stuff that stays with you. I forget all the new songs like five minutes after I've heard them. But Lady Day is timeless."</p>

<p>Karen couldn't help but smile at that, the girl had a point. "So you're really interested in music?" she asked watching as Katie watched herself wiggle her foot. Kids were so strange.</p>

<p>"I like listening to it, but I have no discernable talent. I'd tried to learn how to play the piano once, but I was unbelievably bad at it. There are like Chimpanzee's out there that can play chopsticks better than me," Katie replied shaking her head dismally. "I've got scars," she continued smiling. "Jessie's great though," she continued warming to the subject. "Hearing her sing `Bless the Child' was like out of this world … no solar system," she went on grinning. "Pluto was all like `hey come back here!'"</p>

<p>Judy started laughing, mumbling to Karen how she `loved this kid' before shaking her head. Katie grinned at Judy sensing that she would an easier audience than Karen.</p>

<p>"You're easy," Katie responded settling more comfortably against the counter. "And you haven't even seen what I can do with a simple ping pong ball and candle."</p>

<p>"So what do you like to do?" Karen asked drawing Katie's attention back to her. She didn't know what the girl meant by that last comment but it sounded dirty.</p>

<p>"You mean like interests?" Katie inquired. Karen nodded finishing up with the coffee and turning around to devote her full attention to Katie. "Um, I guess I like gardening," she responded though she didn't seem too sure about that. "And drawing," she continued, confident this time as she located something that she liked that wasn't totally lame. "You know, art."</p>

<p>"Do you have any work with you?" Judy asked perking up after tuning out expecting a conversation about fertilizer.</p>

<p>"Ah, yeah," Katie said reaching down for her satchel and pulling out a small folder. Opening it up she flipped through a few pages, and then pulled out a couple loose sheets of paper. "Sketching isn't really my strong suit, I'm better with paints you know. But … well, there it is," she continued as she spread them across the counter and the two adults bent over the counter to look at the drawings. "That one's Jessie," she added a moment later pointing to the picture furthest to the left.</p>

<p>Karen stared at the pictures, really quite impressed by the work. Katie may not have had a gift for music but she certainly had one for art. Hearing her addition, she turned her head to where the girl was pointing and saw the picture in question. It showed Jessie sitting on a bench, laughing at something as she looked off slightly into the distance. It was a beautiful sketch, playful and wistful, but also deeply reverent. </p>

<p>Karen looked up at Katie after that, staring at her for a moment as the deep emotion that had to have been poured into drawing that picture struck her.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," she said softly, removing her eyes when she saw Katie start to shift under her gaze.</p>

<p>"You can have it," Katie said a bit unnerved by Karen's gaze. "If you want. I mean you see her like every day so you probably don't need a stupid sketch of her, but …"</p>

<p>"Thank you," Karen interjected cutting off Katie's babble. "That's very nice of you. It really is a beautiful drawing."</p>

<p>"Oh, well I had a good subject," Katie replied a dreamy smile spreading across her face before she realized what she must look like and stopped, really wishing that this was one of the times she had opted for meaningful silence, as both Karen and Judy looked over at her. "I mean that bench is just gorgeous."</p>

<p>They were all silent for a moment, and then Judy started laughing. "I love this kid," she said repeating her earlier sentiment. "What do you think of the new DKNY line?" Judy asked a minute later drawing Katie's attention away from Karen who was still looking at her.</p>

<p>"Skirts could be shorter," Katie replied absently, turning her head as she heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and while simultaneously thanking the lord for soon rescuing her. </p>

<p>"Hey Judy, how you doing? Had a nice day? That's great," Jessie said blowing into the room and stopping next to Katie. "Dad says tomorrow at 5, new shoes mom? Let's go," she finished taking Katie's hand and dragging her – as much as she could drag her statuesque girlfriend – up the stairs.</p>

<p>Judy and Karen were silent as the girls took off up the stairs then turned to look at each other for a moment, and then Judy burst out laughing. "Oh my god," she said doubling over. "That was …" she continued noting that Karen couldn't help but let out a small smile too, "too cute."</p>

<hr>

<p>"Is your mom on some new medication or something?" Katie asked wandering to the side of Jessie's room and fingering her solar system model.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately not," Jessie replied with a sigh. "She knows."</p>

<p>"Knows what?" Katie asked turning around to face her.</p>

<p>"About us," Jessie replied flopping back on her bed. "She's trying to act like she's cool with it, hence the weird. Next time you see her she'll probably threaten you with a shotgun, `get away from my daughter'," she finished in an exaggerated southern accent.</p>

<p>"I've never been threatened with shotgun violence before," Katie said sitting on the edge of Jessie's bed. "Little Katie's all grown up now," she continued with a smile. "Besides your moms pretty cool. Stares a lot but she's pretty cool," she continued pausing for a moment before adding. "Plus she's kinda hot."</p>

<p>Katie turned her head to face Jessie having felt the bed shift, only to find the other girl looking at her with an absolutely aghast look on her face, which was soon replaced by a look of pure and utter evil as she stared at her girlfriend. Katie gulped, she had thought that was funny, but she was coming to realize that it really, really wasn't.</p>

<p>"Did I mention that I did a lot of drugs in the washroom before we left school?" Katie asked shifting uncomfortably under Jessie's stare. Damn, was it just her or was it getting hot in there. "Did you know," she continued smoothing her hands out on her pants, "that dogs snore? How crazy is that?"</p>

<p>Jessie merely continued to stare at her. God, Katie thought to herself, humans had to blink didn't they. Why wasn't Jessie blinking?</p>

<p>"Um," she said searching for conversation. "When I was a baby I used to be able to stick my whole leg in my mouth. I thought that was a bit strange, but mom says its cause the Singers come from a long line of circus people," she continued chancing a glance over at Jessie whose jaw seemed to have unclamped a bit, and who actually blinked. That's good, Katie thought to herself, keep acting like as ass. "And ah, last night I dreamt that I was eating a giant marshmallow, and when I woke up my pillow was gone." </p>

<p>There was a moment of silence then Jessie reached behind her picking up her pillow hitting Katie over the head with it. "Shut up, it was not!"</p>

<p>"Alright, that was lie. But the baby and dog things were true," Katie admitted crawling across the bed to Jessie. "I am I forgiven?" she asked lying her head down in Jessie's lap looking up at her innocently.</p>

<p>Before Jessie could respond however there was a knock at her door and Karen walked in, her eyes immediately going to the quaint little scene on the bed. "Ah, Judy's taking me to the grocery store, do you need anything in particular?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie replied staring at her mother very aware of Katie's head, which was still in her lap as the girl picked at the helm of her shirt.</p>

<p>"Marshmallows," Katie whispered, drawing Jessie's eyes down to her for a moment. </p>

<p>"Quit it," Jessie whispered back, but still loud enough that her mother could hear, as she involuntarily smiled at the comment.</p>

<p>"Is that a yes or a no to marshmallows?" Karen asked wearing a smile of her own. Judy was right; they really were extremely adorable together.</p>

<p>"A no," Jessie responded smiling back before her eyes drifted around the room wondering why Karen was still looking at them. "We're good."</p>

<p>"All right, try not to get into any trouble when we're gone," Karen replied starting to shut the door.</p>

<p>"What about rule number three?" Jessie called out while simultaneously wondering what could possibly have possessed her to ask the question.</p>

<p>Karen paused for a moment regarding the two of them once more before finally replying, "Gift horse. Mouth, Jessie," upon which she finished backing out of the door and closed it behind her.</p>

<p>"So is this when we strip naked and take pictures of each others buttocks?" Katie asked once the door closed. Jessie looked down at her sternly. "Oh, I remember this game. Okay…um, did you know that you have to water cactuses? I mean how wild is that?"</p>

<p><i><u>Manning House – One week later</u></i></p>

<p>Jessie slowly crept down the hallway as quietly as she could, taking extra caution to be especially quiet as she passed by everyone's room on her way to the staircase. It was just past one in the morning and if she knew Katie the girl was already outside waiting for her. It had been a crazy week for both of them and they'd hardly been able to spend anytime together outside of school, and school didn't really count because they were never really alone or could never really relax. There was always someone passing by with something to say, or a class to run off to, so when Katie had suggested that they sneak out and watch the meteor shower that was predicted for that night, she had agreed almost without any hesitation. Almost, after all she was still her mother's daughter, and as such rule breaking always caused her some minor heart palpitations though they generally passed. </p>

<p>"Billie!" Katie whispered happily as Jessie opened the back door, flying into the kitchen and wrapping her arms around Jessie.</p>

<p>"Sssh," Jessie said putting her fingers on Katie's lips to quite her. "Eli," she continued having heard her brother moving around his room as she passed by the door to the garage. Katie nodded and drew two fingers across her lips making a tossing motion. Jessie smiled and leaned up kissing her quickly before grabbing her hand and leading her out the door, not stopping to look back.</p>

<hr>

<p>Rick rubbed at his eyes tiredly barely avoiding banging into a wall as he stumbled into the kitchen. Using the counter to steady himself, he slowly made his way to the fridge, opening it up and taking out a pitcher of water. However, as he reached for a glass he felt a slight draft and turned around to look at the back door. Making his way around the counter he padded over to the door to see it slightly ajar. One of the kid's shoes, Zoë's from the size of it had caught in between the frame and door. He frowned to himself as he considered this, turning around slowly. He was the last one downstairs and he had locked the door himself before heading up to bed. Now, fully alert he reached above the stove grabbing a frying pan as he passed into the living room. Moving very carefully, he slowly checked all of the downstairs rooms then made his way upstairs.</p>

<p>Lowering the frying pan, he headed for the door to his bedroom. Nobody was in the house, which only meant one thing; one of the people who was suppose to be there was missing.</p>

<hr>

<p>"You're not serious, are you?" Jessie asked rolling over, so that her arms were braced on the sides of Katie's body and she was leaning over the other girl. Rumpling the blanket they were lying on along the way, but really not caring in the least.</p>

<p>"I am so," Katie responded with an exaggerated importance. "I mean really, think about it, it's the perfect topic for a history paper. A hearty tribute to a natural phenomenon that has benefited mankind from the beginning of time yet is constantly taken for granted. I can't be the only person that's tired of hearing everyone go on and on about electricity, and nuclear power, and the printing press. I think it's high time that somebody gave gravity its props. Said, `Hooray for Gravity' even. I plan to be that person."</p>

<p>"Hooray for Gravity?" Jessie questioned shaking her head slightly before lowering it down to rest on Katie's chest. "Why don't you just say that you're writing a commentary on consumer culture and call it `Snap in to a Slim Jim!'?" she continued derisively. Hooray for gravity, indeed.</p>

<p>"Snap in to a Slim Jim," Katie repeated thoughtfully as she wrapped her arms around Jessie's waist, tracing her back with small, careless circles. "You'd have to help me with that one though, it sounds a bit complicated," she went on with a smile.</p>

<p>"What happened to the meteor shower?" Jessie asked choosing not to dignify Katie's comment with a response.</p>

<p>"What meteor shower?" Katie asked as if Jessie had just asked her if she'd seen a talking dog walk by.</p>

<p>"The meteor shower you said we came out here to watch," Jessie replied raising her head up and looking at Katie keenly. "Oh my god," she said a moment later fixing her with a stern look that quickly dissolved into a grin. "You brought me out here to have your way with me."</p>

<p>Katie smirked, looking away guiltily before turning back to look up a Jessie. "Next time I'm going to have to produce a meteorological report from a reputable news source aren't I?" she asked smiling softly.</p>

<p>"Two," Jessie replied seriously, before leaning down to kiss Katie softly, pulling back a moment later with a dreamy smile on her face as she lay her head back down.</p>

<p>"So does this mean your not going to help me snap into a Slim Jim?" Katie asked, but before she could continue Jessie's lips were on hers, and she suddenly found much better things to do with her tongue.</p>

<hr>

<p>"The back door was open," Rick said as Lily pulled on her robe. "I know I locked it before I came up, and I checked the house and nobody was here. One of the kids has snuck out, it's the only explanation."</p>

<p>"Alright," Lily said her voice still blurry with sleep. "You go downstairs to see if Eli's there, and I'll check on Grace and Zoë, then we'll head up to the attic."</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me," Rick replied, thinking smugly that Grace was going to be in a lot of trouble when her mother found out she wasn't there.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey," Katie said softly, gently shaking Jessie's shoulder. The other girl had fallen asleep on her an hour ago, but she hadn't minded, in fact she'd loved just lying there getting to hold her while she was asleep. "We've gotta get back," she continued seeing Jessie blink up at her sleepily.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" Jessie asked lifting her head off of Katie and rolling onto the other side of the blanket.</p>

<p>"Almost five," Katie replied sitting up. She's felt like kicking herself when she'd checked her watch a minute ago, they'd planned on being back way before this. "I guess we lost track of the time."</p>

<hr>

<p>"That just leaves Jessie," Lily said meeting Rick at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the attic. She'd checked to find both Grace and Zoë sleeping soundly, and Rick had reported that Eli had actually been in his room for once, which meant that the youngest Sammler was the only one left to check on.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Sssssshhhhhhhh," Jessie whispered loudly as she pushed the door open and Katie grabbed her around the waist laughing. "Sssssh," she said again laughing herself now as Katie bit her lip in an exaggerated attempt to look like she was trying to be quiet. Jessie smiled up at her thinking that she had never seen a more adorable face in her life and leaned up pressing their lips together.</p>

<hr>

<p>Rick's hand twitched as he heard his daughter enter the house, telling whoever she was with to be quiet, then he lifted his hand and flicked on the lights to the kitchen half a tirade already out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Where the hell have you be …" he said stopping as he got his first look at the scene in front of him. "…en?" he finished saying, his voice barely audible as he watched Jessie rip her lips off of Katie's as she twirled around to look at him and Lily.</p>

<p>Jessie opened her mouth to answer, still uncomfortably aware of the taste of Katie's mouth and proximity of her body, but no sound came out. Instead she merely stood there gaping at her father and Lily, her mind completely and utterly blank.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Maybe I should just take Katie home?" Lily suggested breaking the silence that had descended upon the kitchen the moment the lights had been turned on. It had been over a minute and nobody had said a thing since Rick stopped talking.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Go to your room," Rick said softly the moment the backdoor shut behind Lily and Katie.</p>

<p>"Dad," Jessie started carefully, but before she could get out anything more Rick interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Go. To. Your room, Jessie," Rick repeated his tone dull, but leaving no room for argument. This was not a request, it was an order and Jessie knew it. Sighing softly, Jessie dropped her head down and headed towards the stairs.</p>

<p>Hearing Jessie's feet dejectedly slumping up the stairs Rick took a deep breath, possibly his first since he turned on the light, and sighed running an agitated hand through his hair. He had not expected to see that. Not in a million years had he expected to see that. </p>

<p>Taking a few steps forward he dropped down onto the couch, bringing his hand up to his face, rubbing it over his features before allowing his hand to drop back into his lap. He had not expected to see that. Not in a million years had he expected to see that.</p>

<p><i><u>Manning House – The Next Morning</u></i></p>

<p>Grace stomped into the living room exceeding pissed off as she checked her watch one more time. "Oh my god Jessie, I swear if you don't get your ass down here like ten minutes ago I am so outta here," she bellowed in the general direction of the stairs. She had wanted to get to class early because Mr. Dimitri had been acting strangely around her for the last couple of classes and she just had to know why. "Jessie!" she yelled again as Jessie's blonde head finally became visible at the top of the stairs as she came running down, flinging her bag around her neck as she went.</p>

<p>"God," Grace said getting a good look at the girl for the first time as she headed towards her. It looked like Death had visited her in the middle of the night and beat her with a big stick. "You really should lay off the drinking and the whoring," Grace said as Jessie approached her. "It's aging you," she continued waving her hand in front of Jessie's face.</p>

<p>"That's funny," Jessie muttered under her breath coming to a stop beside Grace. "I thought you were in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Right," Grace said her mind back on track after commenting on the train wreck that was Jessie. "Come on," she said grabbing the girl by her shirt and tugging her into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Lily called out as Grace continued to drag a worryingly passive Jessie towards the door. </p>

<p>Jessie paused upon hearing her stepmothers voice, her body going rigid and finally resisting Grace's pull. She had been waiting for this since her father had sent her up to her room the night before. This had to be where the yelling and the head shaking came in, and she was both terrified and relieved that the moment was finally at hand. She just wanted to get this over and done with. Taking a deep breath she slowly pivoted until she came to face Lily. "Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Here," Lily said tossing her a brown paper bag, which Jessie just barely caught before it hit her in the face.</p>

<p>"Thanks?" Jessie responded uncertainly looking at Lily completely stupefied. She hadn't been expecting lunch. But before she could say anything else Grace was dragging her once more, towards and then out the door.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I'm glad you called, I wanted to confirm that you'd pick Jessie up from school and I'd get her from the house, I'm trying to…" Karen started to say as soon as she heard her ex-husbands voice on the other end of the phone, but she was interrupted before she could continue.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, that's fine, but that's not why I called," Rick said dismissively as he paced around his office whipping the phone cord around with him as he walked. "We need to talk about Jessie."</p>

<p>"Okay," Karen said slowly, leaning back in her chair. She could tell that Rick was upset about something, in his own quiet voiced, passive aggressive way. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"She …" Rick began trying to gather his scattered thoughts. "She snuck out last night ... with that girl. Right in the middle of the night, didn't get back until nearly dawn. This girl is clearly a bad influence…"</p>

<p>"Girl?" Karen asked interrupting his tirade. "Katie?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Rick replied his voice slightly agitated. "I mean, god knows what they were doing, I have no idea how long she was gone for! What could they have been doing for that long?" he continued knowing that considering the time he had locked the door and the time they had come back in that they could've been gone for over three hours, and he didn't even want to contemplate what and where they may have been doing things.</p>

<p>"What did Jessie say?" Karen asked frowning slightly. She was upset herself about what Rick was telling her, but he seemed to be agitated enough for both of them leaving her as the voice of reason.</p>

<p>"What?" Rick asked, Karen's voice dragging him out of his thoughts – for which he was eternally grateful.</p>

<p>"Well, you talked to her when she came in didn't you?" Karen asked trying not to get upset about Rick's spaciness and borderline hysteria. "What did she say about it?"</p>

<p>"She …" Rick started to answer in a perturbed tone, "I didn't really get a chance to… I mean there were other things to consider …"</p>

<p>"Your daughter snuck out in the middle of the night, what other things were there to consider?" Karen asked a bit irritably.</p>

<p>"I don't know, maybe the fact that she was kissing her best friend?" Rick snapped back, instantly regretting it. He shouldn't have broken the news to Karen like that, he thought shaking his head, he should have taken the time to explain what happened but Karen always knew how to push his buttons. And, now he'd gone and done it, she was going to be devastated by this.</p>

<p>"Oh," Karen replied lightly. "Well what did she say about that?"</p>

<p>"Oh?" Rick asked staring at the base of the phone incredulously as if it were Karen's face. "Oh? All you have to say about it is `oh'?"</p>

<p>"No," Karen replied with a sigh. "I did also ask what she said about it."</p>

<p>Rick paused for a second considering his ex-wife's response before continuing. "You're not the least bit … shocked by this?" he asked unable to understand how she could be taking this so calmly. He knew Karen and this was not something that she would take lightly.</p>

<p>"About Jessie and Katie?" Karen replied debating about whether or not she should tell him that she already knew and deal with the inevitable blow out that would ensue, or whether she should just let things alone and let him take what he wanted from her response. "No, not really."</p>

<p>"Did you know about them, before this?" Rick asked slouching down into his chair rubbing at his forehead. He was getting a headache, and depending on how Karen answered he was about to blow his top.</p>

<p>"I had an idea, yes," Karen replied carefully. "The signs were all there."</p>

<p>"And, what? I just wasn't paying attention?" Rick asked heatedly sitting up straight in his chair.</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," Karen sighed rolling her head to the side tiredly. "Does this mean you didn't ask her where she was?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't ask where she was," Rick responded rolling his eyes. "Listen," he said getting his act together. "Would you mind just coming by an hour or so later? I'd like to talk to her when she gets home." </p>

<p>"Alright," Karen said emphasizing with what Rick was going through now having been there herself not to long ago. "That'll be fine. That's fine."</p>

<p>"Okay, thanks," Rick said getting ready to hang up, before Karen interrupted before he could place the receiver down.</p>

<p>"Rick, just…" she started to say softly, her tone almost pleading with him to be careful about this.</p>

<p>"I know," he said realizing where she was going and cutting her off before she could continue. Jessie was his daughter too, and he didn't intend to attack her or in any other way berate her for whatever she had with Katie. He just wanted a chance to try and understand it. "I'll see you later."</p>

<hr>

<p>Katie let out a relieved sigh as she saw Jessie approaching her from across the schoolyard. It was almost time for class to start and when she hadn't seen the other girl she began to wonder just how much trouble she had gotten her into. "Billie," she greeted clearly relieved, "hey, I thought you'd found out where they buried Hoffa."</p>

<p>"Can I talk to you?" Jessie said barely glancing at the small group of people loosely gathered around her girlfriend. She really wasn't in the mood for small talk. "In private."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie said some of her enthusiasm at finally seeing Jessie disappearing now that she had gotten a good look at her. That was not a happy face. Her hangdog response was followed by a series of "ooohs" and "what's that? Burn" and various other commentaries before she shot them all disgruntled looks and walked off with Jessie.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Katie, sighed once they got out of ear shot from her friends, her head dropping down miserably. "I swear I wouldn't have taken you out if I thought we'd get caught."</p>

<p>"There's nothing for you to be sorry about," Jessie replied softly, taking Katie's hand into hers and squeezing it softly as she looked over at her.</p>

<p>"Get a room! Preferably mine," Bob Brooks yelled from a nearby bench high five-ing his buddies as he tracked the two of them lecherously. There were other out girls on campus, but none of them came close to the hotness that was Katie and her girl.</p>

<p>"Get a life, preferably one without a blow up hole," Katie called back irritably flipping him the bird as they walked by, which was met by his buddies laughing at him and making `ouchy' faces turning away.</p>

<p>"We love you Katie!" One of them called after her to which she turned around and curtsied to graciously to before continuing on her way.</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," Katie said once again returning her attention to Jessie.</p>

<p>"You don't have to apologize for that either," Jessie said frowning at the memory of the last guy tracking Katie's ass as they had walked off.</p>

<p>"So, how much trouble did you get in?" Katie asked almost dreading the answer. Her ride home with Lily had been like the worst, most awkward experience ever. They hadn't said like one word to each other, the only interaction between them being Lily's sideways glances at her like every other second. She'd been convinced they were going to crash into a telephone pole or something. She loathed finding out how it must have been for Jessie.</p>

<p>"Don't know yet," Jessie responded softly. "I got `go to your room' on auto repeat," she continued remembering her dad's expression. "How did your dad react?"</p>

<p>"He bought some riverfront property on denial and has been resting there comfortably for the last year," Katie responded with a sigh. "Mom said she always suspected cause I was a little flamer always sneaking into the change rooms in the lingerie department, but she's so vacant that…" Katie stopped not wanting to go down that road. "Anyway, dad still thinks I loved Wonder Woman cause of the great writing and set design, and that's the way he likes it," Katie continued her tone melancholy despite the humor she tried to inject into her response. The truth was that it wasn't something that was talked about in her house. Except for the initial blow out that night her parents had found her and Sarah making out, they never brought it up or referred to it. Even though she knew they knew otherwise, Jessie was still merely referred to as her `good friend'. "Rick?" she then prompted breaking the silence. She'd made some kind of peace with her situation, now Jessie had to.</p>

<p>"You should've seen his face," Jessie said a moment later, unconsciously drifting closer to Katie. "It was just … it was just sad."</p>

<p>"And he didn't say anything to you other than `go to your room'?" Katie asked reaching down for Jessie's hand again having felt her girlfriend shift closer to her.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie said. "What does that mean? That he couldn't even talk to me."</p>

<p>"This is going to sound strange, but I think that maybe it's a good thing," Katie replied using her thumb to rub Jessie's hand. "I mean it had to have been a shock for him … to say the least. But, you know, even though he was probably freaked as all hell he didn't lose his shit or anything," she continued thoughtfully. "Sounds to me like he just needed some time to … what's that word … yeah, ruminate. He just needs some time to ruminate over it all."</p>

<p>"And once he's both rummed and nated?" Jessie asked glumly.</p>

<p>"You're probably going to get grounded," Katie replied seriously. "Cause once he gets over the whole kissing thing, he's going to remember that we didn't get back until five. Then you're going to get grounded."</p>

<p>"You think?" Jessie asked hoping that that would be all there was to it. Her mom had just started being normal about everything again, even suggesting that she invite Katie over the nights she went to her book club, so she wasn't really looking forward to another awkward home experience.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but don't worry I'll pelt rocks at your window like in that Swedish movie so that you know that I love you. Even though you're a hooligan," Katie replied smiling over at Jessie.</p>

<p>"You say the sweetest things," Jessie replied rolling her eyes but grinning at Katie warmly nonetheless as her girlfriend pulled her into a quick hug. The day may not have started out so well, but at least there was some sunshine, and since it was shining directly on her that was all that she needed.</p>

<p>Jessie lowered herself onto the bed shifting around uncomfortably for a moment before deciding that she was only putting off the inevitable and looking up at her father and Lily who were standing just inside the door to their bedroom. </p>

<hr>

<p>Grace walked into the kitchen picking an apple up off of the counter as she glanced over to the side to see Zoë eating peanut butter out of the container with a spoon.</p>

<p>"What do you think you're doing?" Grace asked taking the spoon away from the child with a disgruntled look. "The rest of us eat that stuff too, and we don't want your cooties."</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as cooties," Zoë said condescendingly looking over at Grace.</p>

<p>"Where's mom," Grace asked not really wanting to have to police the little brat.</p>

<p>"Upstairs with Rick and Jessie," Zoë replied going to get another spoon. "She says they're having a serious talk and are not to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"What are they talking about," Grace asked intrigued at the possibility of new gossip, especially if it involved Jessie in any way, shape, or form.</p>

<p>"Jessie snuck out last night, and now she's in BIG trouble," Zoë responded. She'd managed to follow them for a little while before they got into the bedroom and had heard that much, but then her mom had noticed her and shooed her away.</p>

<p>"Really?" Grace asked turning towards the stairs. "Hmmm."</p>

<hr>

<p>"…And what you did is completely unacceptable," Rick continued pacing around in front of the bed. "Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be wandering around the streets at night? How worried we were that you were dead or worse?" he continued looking over at Jessie sharply.</p>

<p>"We were only ten minutes away," Jessie began but Rick interrupted her not wanting to hear any of that.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter where you went, you shouldn't have been anywhere but in bed in the safety of our house. What you did was … was unacceptable," he repeated again getting himself all flustered and worked up. "You are not to see her…"</p>

<p>Jessie leapt off the bed as she heard this, her face filled with rebellious fire. "You can't stop me from seeing her!" she fired out immediately interrupting the rest of her father speech. "I don't care if you don't like it, it's not your life, it's mine. And I LOVE her! And you can tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about, cause I DO know what I'm talking about, and you can't keep me away from her," she continued blinking back tears as she mentally debated whether she should threaten them with running away and selling her ass on the street. However, before she could decide Rick cut back in finishing his previous statement.</p>

<p>"…see her or anyone else until further notice, because you are SO grounded," he went on, seeing Jessie pout but return to her sitting position on the bed. "As for Katie," he continued his voice lowering again to a reasonable tone, "I know I can't stop you from seeing her. I don't want to stop you from seeing her. But..."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed loudly and irritably at the use of the word `but' but otherwise remained silent.</p>

<p>"Since you are seeing her," Rick continued ignoring Jessie's exhalation, "I'd like to get to know her a bit better. Plus, the two of us need to talk."</p>

<p>"You don't need to talk," Jessie said shaking her head vehemently. There were to be no more talks. "She's had the talk. She's been threatened with shovels and other blunt objects already. Mom gave her the talk, she gave it to her for like twenty minutes," Jessie continued sighing at the memory. "Katie was afraid to look at me afterwards. So you really don't need to have the talk," she finished huffily.</p>

<p>"Karen had the talk with her?" Rick asked surprised. Karen had led him to believe that she hadn't had any concrete knowledge of Jessie's relationship with Katie, just a suspicion. Finding out otherwise didn't please him, not only did it mean she was keeping things from him about his own daughter, but that she had taken away a father's prerogative. It was tradition that the dad threatens whatever boy was trying to get into his daughters pants by pretending in being interested in dating her. Katie was certainly not a boy, but he had a speech ready dammit, and he'd wanted to use it.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Jessie exclaimed. "And she had it with me too. A long talk. A long detailed talk," she continued shivering at the memory. People who loved people may have been the luckiest people in the world, but people who had to talk about the exact details of their loving other people with their mothers were doomed to have many sleepless nights. "And no we haven't. Can I go now?"</p>

<p>Rick nodded and Jessie gratefully jumped off of the bed heading for the door.</p>

<p>"Remember you're…" Rick started to call after her.</p>

<p>"Grounded, I know," Jessie grumbled her footsteps slowing until she was actually slumping out of the door.</p>

<p>Rick sat down on the bed looking slightly dazed as soon as Jessie was out of the room. Lily sat down beside him placing a hand on his shoulder causing him to jump slightly. She'd been so quiet during the talk he'd forgotten she was there.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought both of them would end up liking girls?" Lily asked shaking her head at the thought of the odds of both of their daughters ending up being gay.</p>

<p>Rick looked over at her, his expression clearly showing that he was not in the mood to be philosophical about it.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. You'll deal with it. In fact once you get acclimated to the idea, you'll see that same-sex love is a beautiful thing," Lily commented thinking about the journey she had undertaken when she had first become aware of Grace's gayness, and how she had come to be proud of her daughter and couldn't wait until they could hold signs together and wear matching humorous T-Shirts. She had even started taping Rosie just to lend her support to the cause. "I just wish that Grace could find a nice girl like Katie," Lily continued with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Katie's a hoodlum," Rick grumbled in response, not having been paying the least bit of attention to Lily until she mentioned the girl's name.</p>

<p>"She's not a hoodlum," Lily responded rolling her eyes. Over all the times that Katie had been over at their house, Lily had managed to talk to the girl quite a bit and she was a very nice girl. She was sweet, and funny and outgoing, and as far as Lily was concerned just the kind of girl that Jessie needed.</p>

<p>"She probably does drugs," Rick, continued oblivious to Lily's presence.</p>

<p>"She doesn't do drugs," Lily responded looking over at him incredulously.</p>

<p>"What do you know?" Rick asked grumpily. "You thought Jessie was heterosexual and I had nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>At this Lily stood up and began to head to the door to go and see if Grace had gotten home yet. There was no use talking to Rick when he got like this.</p>

<p>"She probably sells drugs and that's what they were doing out so late," Rick called after her, but Lily continued out the door ignoring him.</p>
