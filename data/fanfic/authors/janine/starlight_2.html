<!-- Starlight \ Part 2 -->

<p>&#34;Willow, please,&#34; Giles said looking down at the young redhead once again.</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow responded firmly not moving from her position.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Willow, I really…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Would it kill you to respond in complete sentences?&#34; Giles asked running a&nbsp;&nbsp;hand through his hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as he cared about the scoobs they were&nbsp;&nbsp;absolutely exasperating at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he had managed to convince&nbsp;&nbsp;Xander to go home and get some rest.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, Giles it would actually kill me,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;So, no.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Giles said sighing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Let me know if you need anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Will do,&#34; the hacker responded before returning to her vigil.</p>

<p>Spike watched as Giles exited the room, then slipped out of the shadows and&nbsp;&nbsp;headed towards the room where the Slayer and hacker remained.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he&nbsp;&nbsp;reached the door he fully intended on entering, but something stopped him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead when he reached the door, he just stood there leaning against the&nbsp;&nbsp;frame and looked into the room.</p>

<p>Willow was hunched over in her chair holding Buffy's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd often&nbsp;&nbsp;wondered about the two of them, Willow more than Buffy as the Slayer was&nbsp;&nbsp;able to keep a tighter leash on her emotions than her friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd been&nbsp;&nbsp;walking the earth for just over two hundred years and during that time,&nbsp;&nbsp;especially after he died, he had a lot of time to observe the mortals.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn't because he particularly cared about them, or was curious about them,&nbsp;&nbsp;he just wanted to learn how to read them so that he could better manipulate&nbsp;&nbsp;and torture them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the decades he learned that he was very good at&nbsp;&nbsp;reading people, in fact he was certain he could have been a bloody good&nbsp;&nbsp;shrink.&nbsp;&nbsp;And although he couldn't torture or manipulate Buffy and Willow (at&nbsp;&nbsp;least not anymore) he still watched them.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something compelling,&nbsp;&nbsp;something special about the two of them-although if someone asked him he&nbsp;&nbsp;would never admit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, watching them almost made him wish he was&nbsp;&nbsp;still human…almost.</p>

<p>He shook his head and smirked darkly as he watched Willow smooth away a&nbsp;&nbsp;strand of Buffy hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chippies were in love with each other, but were&nbsp;&nbsp;to afraid to tell the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have had such fun&nbsp;&nbsp;with this if he was still a bad-ass vamp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months ago he would have&nbsp;&nbsp;milked this discovery for all it was worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, now that he had spent&nbsp;&nbsp;so much time around them and gotten their cooties he wouldn't even enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;room because he didn't want to disturb them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was enough to make him want&nbsp;&nbsp;to jump on a table leg.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, isn't this quaint,&#34; Spike drawled finally making it into the room.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Willow asked turning around to look at the Billy Idol&nbsp;&nbsp;clone.</p>

<p>&#34;Just paying my respects,&#34; Spike said coming to a stop beside her chair.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, and VIP is quality entertainment,&#34; Willow said turning away from him.</p>

<p>&#34;That's a bloody good show,&#34; Spike said looking down at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Is there a reason you're here?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Is there a reason any of us are here?&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, do any of us really know&nbsp;&nbsp;what we were put on the this planet for?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we did would we even be&nbsp;&nbsp;able to achieve it….&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy knows and does,&#34; Willow said cutting off his mock philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;diatribe.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well isn't she lucky,&#34; Spike said making a face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Buffy's brave and&nbsp;&nbsp;strong and courageous isn't she?&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes you really wonder why she'd waste&nbsp;&nbsp;her time on a sub-par witch who's as afraid of her own feelings as she is of&nbsp;&nbsp;her shadow, doesn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp;It sure makes me wonder.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I only did that once,&#34; Willow said in response to the shadow comment.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm so sure,&#34; Spike responded rolling his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;You're just trying to annoy me,&#34; Willow said tilting her head up to peer at&nbsp;&nbsp;the vampire.</p>

<p>&#34;You're right, I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't mean that I'm wrong.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wrong about what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;About you…being afraid of your own insignificant emotions.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not afraid of my own emotions, in fact I'm very in touch with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;fact right now they're telling me that I don't like you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Really, then why don't you just tell her…if you're not afraid that is?&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spike challenged.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you insane?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, yeah,&#34; Spike answered sarcastically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Where have you been for the last&nbsp;&nbsp;three years?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Alright, I'll admit it was a stupid question,&#34; Willow acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;But&nbsp;&nbsp;in my defense it was an excited utterance.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll bet you were excited,&#34; Spike commented lecherously.</p>

<p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Willow asked finally turning around to peer at&nbsp;&nbsp;the vampire.</p>

<p>&#34;You and the brave little tank engine,&#34; Spike said casting a look in Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;You're obviously hot for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She makes you randy doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;she?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I am NOT, I repeat…emphatically…NOT hot for Buffy,&#34; Willow said her voice&nbsp;&nbsp;rising defensively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;And…who say's 'randy' anyway…you stupid-head.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhh, that was convincing,&#34; Spike said in a voice that oozed sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; Willow said turning away from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wasn't sure what she was&nbsp;&nbsp;more upset about, Spike being right about her feelings for Buffy, or Spike&nbsp;&nbsp;disturbing the silence?&nbsp;&nbsp;It was probably an equal combination.</p>

<p>&#34;She's really got your digits, huh?&#34; Spike asked with an obnoxious grin.</p>

<p>&#34;You want you know about digits?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll show you a digit,&#34; Willow responded&nbsp;&nbsp;flipping Spike the bird.</p>

<p>&#34;The cat has claws,&#34; Spike responded making a clawing motion with his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;and growling suggestively.</p>

<p>&#34;Have you ever heard the expression 'three's a crowd'?&#34; Willow asked turning&nbsp;&nbsp;around irritably.</p>

<p>&#34;Have you heard the expression 'I don't give a flying fuck'?&#34; Spike&nbsp;&nbsp;responded.</p>

<p>Willow didn't responded and Spike bounced on the balls of his feet for a&nbsp;&nbsp;moment observing Willow and the Slayer, smiling.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, you can stick up all the fingers you like, but you know that I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;right.&nbsp;&nbsp;You're in love with the Slayer,&#34; he said gleefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;How&nbsp;&nbsp;staggeringly pathetic,&#34; he went on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If I were you I'd get my jollies while&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, because even Buffy's not stupid enough to blind to your feelings for&nbsp;&nbsp;her for much longer…and once she wises up…well, let's just say you'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;begging to have you sidekick status back.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're wrong,&#34; Willow said softly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Buffy's my best friend…nothing will&nbsp;&nbsp;come between us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're stronger than that,&#34; Willow said not sure if she was&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to convince Spike or herself.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing except for the fact that you want to jump her bones,&#34; the vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If you don't think wanting to engage in sexual congress with&nbsp;&nbsp;your best friend is going to cause anything but total fall out, you're&nbsp;&nbsp;stupider than Xander looks.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Like you would know anything about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't even have a heart, how do&nbsp;&nbsp;you expect to know how those of us whose hearts still beat will feel?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know because you know,&#34; Spike responded smugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If you really believed&nbsp;&nbsp;all of this 'unconditional friendship' crap that you've been preaching you&nbsp;&nbsp;would have told her already.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that you sit here in the dark holding&nbsp;&nbsp;her hand when she's unconscious because you know it's the only way you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;ever be able to do it tells me everything that I need to know.&#34;</p>

<p>Spike watched as the hacker dropped her gaze and stared at her shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;Merry wallowing,&#34; the vampire said in closing, then he walked out the door.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy slowly become aware of her surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;One sound, one smell, one&nbsp;&nbsp;touch at a time she slowly came back into herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The room smelled vaguely&nbsp;&nbsp;of herbs, it was a combination of hospital smell and the Magic shop, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn't her olfactory senses that were primarily engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;What she was&nbsp;&nbsp;almost hyper-naturally aware of was the hand on hers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently tracing&nbsp;&nbsp;patterns on her skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in her barely conscious state she knew that the&nbsp;&nbsp;hands belonged to Willow and it caused her heart to flood with warmth.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, there's a law against molesting the unconscious,&#34; Buffy said&nbsp;&nbsp;smiling as she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;I wasn't…&#34; Willow said pulling her hand away quickly.</p>

<p>&#34;It was a joke Will, granted it wasn't a very good one, but I'm not exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;at my peak right now,&#34; Buffy responded cutting Willow off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;it wasn't a bad way to wake up…and believe me I know for I have woken up a&nbsp;&nbsp;number of bad ways.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How do you feel?&#34; Willow asked leaning forward slightly, but not touching&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation that she had with Spike was still playing through&nbsp;&nbsp;her head like a broken record that she couldn't shut off.</p>

<p>&#34;I've been better,&#34; Buffy responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I've been worse.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're being vague,&#34; Willow responded gently.</p>

<p>&#34;Hurt and I are very close friends right now,&#34; Buffy said smiling a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;I don't really like Hurt though…she's a bit of a wise-ass.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hurts bad,&#34; Willow agreed.</p>

<p>&#34;Very bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurt needs a cap in her ass like nobody's business,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;responded grinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;How are you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not the one with the demon bite,&#34; Willow responded meeting Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;True enough, but you are the one who looks like she hasn't sleep since the&nbsp;&nbsp;reign of Louis XIV,&#34; Buffy responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in her weakened state the worry&nbsp;&nbsp;in her voice was clear.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm okay,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I…I've just been worried about you…you&nbsp;&nbsp;looked so pale Buffy, I was so worried we didn't know what to do and…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Shhh,&#34; Buffy said reaching out and grasping Willow's hand which was&nbsp;&nbsp;thankfully near by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's all right now, no 'if's', 'ands', or&nbsp;&nbsp;'buts'&nbsp;&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all roses.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Roses?&#34; Willow asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Red, yellow…what ever kind you want,&#34; Buffy responded smiling.</p>

<p>A few moments later Willow noticed Buffy's eyes close briefly and saw a&nbsp;&nbsp;shudder run through her body.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah…it's okay,&#34; Buffy answered quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I'm just cold,&#34; she added&nbsp;&nbsp;softly.</p>

<p>Willow started to stand up.</p>

<p>&#34;What?!&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going?!&#34; Buffy asked trying to maintain the weak hold&nbsp;&nbsp;she had on Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm going to get you another blanket,&#34; Willow said looking down at Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;I'll be right back, it'll be okay.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, Will, just stay…I don't need…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, yes you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt that shudder run through your body, and you told&nbsp;&nbsp;me yourself you were cold.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I…there's…listen, I don't need a blanket…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, wait, just hear me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I…I'll be alright if you just…if you come lie&nbsp;&nbsp;down with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Body heat's the best heat…or so the saying goes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, really the linen closet is just down the hall,&#34; Willow said looking&nbsp;&nbsp;at the door.</p>

<p>&#34;I…Will…I don't want to be alone, can you understand that?&#34; Buffy asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willow nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Can you…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;No 'ifs', 'ands', or 'buts' about it,&#34; she&nbsp;&nbsp;continued smiling as she moved around the other side of the bed to slip in&nbsp;&nbsp;beside Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Buffy said softly once Willow had settled in beside her.</p>

<p>&#34;There's no need for thanks…I'm glad to be of service,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, then I'm glad to have you in my service,&#34; Buffy said softly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Don't&nbsp;&nbsp;take this as an affront but I'm probably going to fall asleep very, very,&nbsp;&nbsp;soon.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No 'fronts' will be taken…Scouts honor,&#34; Willow said.</p>

<p>&#34;You were never a Scout,&#34; Buffy said through a yawn.</p>

<p>&#34;True…but my heart was in the right place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you comfortable?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Despite all reason, yeah,&#34; Buffy responded soaking in Willow's warmth and&nbsp;&nbsp;the feel of her friends body pressed up against her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Definitely a yeah.&#34;</p>
