<p><b>2003 - Jessie's Attic</b></p>

<p>Jessie heard a loud obnoxious banging at her door, then
heard some feet stomping up the stairs before she saw Zoë's head pop up over the
banister and saw the girl begin to march towards her phone in hand. She really hadn't
missed people bursting into her room when they were in Australia.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you could come in," Jessie
said glaring at the kid.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I wouldn't have if you'd just
have picked up the phone like a normal person," Zoë said handing the offending
object over the Jessie. "Some of us have work to do."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" Jessie asked already knowing the
answer.</p>

<p>"It's Wednesday night, who do you think it
is?" Zoë asked rolling her eyes at Jessie and heading out of the attic.</p>

<p>"Hello," Jessie said into the receiver her tone
bored. Zoë was right, whenever the phone rang in pulses on Wednesday night they all knew
who it was. Katie. Only this Wednesday night, Katie's call had come about three hours
late and Jessie had decided not to pick up when her girlfriend apparently remembered her,
however Zoë had other ideas.</p>

<p>"Try to contain your excitement, you don't want
to rupture anything," Katie replied sarcastically. "I'm not interrupting
anything am I?" she asked surprised at Jessie's lackluster response to her call.</p>

<p>"Just reading," Jessie replied in the same dull
tone. She knew she was being unreasonable, and the truth was the moment she heard
Katie's voice her heart skipped a beat, but she couldn't help feeling hurt that
on one of the few opportunities they got to talk, Katie had put her off for whatever it
was she had been doing with her new friends, in her new country, in her new best life
ever.</p>

<p>"Must be a very good book," Katie replied slowly.
"Listen I'm sorry I'm calling a bit late," she continued figuring
that's what must have been getting Jessie all riled up.</p>

<p>"Did you forget?" Jessie asked softly unable to
help herself. This was the first time it had happened and Katie had apologized and she
should've been happy to leave it at that, but she just couldn't.</p>

<p>"No, never," Katie responded adamantly.
"These calls, talking to you ... it means as much to me as it means to you,"
she continued sighing.</p>

<p>"It's just that you've got this whole new,
exciting life that I'm not a part of, and..."</p>

<p>"I was at the library doing propositional
calculus," Katie interjected. "New, but not particularly exciting," she
continued sighing again. "I feel like I'm missing things with you too you know.
The play, the camping trip ..."</p>

<p>"I wasn't trying to..." Jessie started to
say. It hadn't been her intention to make Katie feel bad for having a life that was
the last thing she'd wanted to do.</p>

<p>"I know. I know that. It's just ... I
don't know what to say when you say stuff like that," Katie said dejectedly.
"I love you, I think about you all the time, I mean they've started calling me
J.Lo for Jessie lover," she continued shaking her head. "I just ... you
know," she went on sighing. "I don't know."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said in a similar tone. "So
what's propositional calculus?"</p>

<p>"It's this really retarded logic shit, where if
Peter was in the shed or in the garden, P would equal S or something," Katie replied
glad for the change of topic. When she talked to Jessie she hated it when they got into
talking about how much it sucked to be separated because there was just nothing they could
do about it. All she wanted to do was just hear about Jessie's voice, and listening
to her complain about Zoë, and find out what Karen was up to. She just wanted to hear her
voice, just wanted to talk to her and concentrate on what they could do, what they did
have, not what they'd lost. "I don't get it. This guy Keith from the class
was trying to help me out, but I'm officially a dumbass."</p>

<p>"I think your ass is cute," Jessie replied
smiling.</p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked playfully. "In that
case, what're you wearing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie said.</p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked her voice rising as her
eyes popped open. She was suddenly glad she was alone in the room.</p>

<p>"Shorts and a tank top," Jessie replied smiling.</p>

<p>"Tease," Katie accused though when it was teasing
like that she didn't really mind.</p>

<p>"I'll make it up to you," Jessie promised,
referring to Katie's impending return for Christmas.</p>

<p>"Can you write that down, laminate it and mail it to
me?" Katie asked. "I'm going to hold you to that."</p>
