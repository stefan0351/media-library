<p>It had been a beautiful day out, the sun was just
beginning to set, and people were laughing and kids playing. The air was
crackling with a mirth and good humor which was rare in a twenty cemetery
town like Sunnydale. The good humor however was not shared by a lone girl
walking down the street. Hands stuffed into her pockets, head down, she
walked without looking, without purpose. She was lucky in one aspect however,
she didn't have to watch out for people running into her. There was something
about the girl, what you might call her aura, or presence, that caused
people to move out of her way. "The wave effect" as she and her friends
had taken to calling it.</p>

<p>As she passed by the playground the girl looked over
at the children on the slide, and the swings, and the teeter totter. She
watched as they tried to get one last swing, or slide in before it was
time to go home, before it got dark. She watched them with a wistfulness
that one would not have suspected a person as young as she was would be
able to produce. Soon the adults started to hurry the kids up, they wanted
to make sure they all got home before dark. The townspeople had learned
a long time ago that it was no longer safe to stay out once the sun had
gone down, and they now made every effort to be securely in their homes
by the time it happened. It was an unwritten, unspoken rule in Sunnydale.
But there were a lot of things that went unsaid in Sunnydale so it wasn't
surprising. The girl, who was all too familiar with the workings of her
town, frowned at the hurried display then continued on her somber walk.</p>

<p>By the time the girl reached the town square the
sun had gone down completely, blanketing the town in darkness. There were
still people out and about but they were only teenagers and adults, the
young ones had all been tucked away. The people who were out however weren't
ignorant to the dangers of the night and were all in large groups, putting
credence in the saying, 'security in numbers'. A few of the people recognized
the girl as she walked by them alone, but were not worried for her, they
knew that she could take care of herself. If she was known for one thing,
it was that.</p>

<p>The girl crossed the street with the intention on
entering the cemetery when she noticed a figure off to the side of the
road kicking her car tire and yelling at it. As the girl noticed the figure
the figure noticed the girl and called out to her.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Called the figure. The girl, Buffy, walked
over the car.</p>

<p>"Having a little car trouble Cordy?" Buffy asked
even though she had already spotted the flat tire.</p>

<p>"No, it's fun for me to be crouching in the gutter
in the middle of the night," Cordelia responded kicking the tire again
just for effect.</p>

<p>"It's only eight o'clock," Buffy observed, slightly
amused by Cordelia's exclamation. The girl had a knack for exaggeration,
Buffy would admit that.</p>

<p>"Whatever," Cordelia responded absently. It really
wasn't so important what the time was, as that she was crouching in the
gutter. That was the part of her statement Buffy was supposed to focus
on. "Damn American cars, I told my parents we should have gone German."</p>

<p>"Do you want some help, or should I leave you two
alone?" Buffy asked with a smirk. She really had no intention of leaving
Cordelia stranded, although the other girl probably deserved it. Besides,
if Cordy ended up getting bitten or something, it would just mean more
work for her.</p>

<p>"Vampire Slayer and auto-mechanic, is there nothing
you can't do?" Cordelia asked sarcastically though she desperately wanted
the other girl's help.</p>

<p>"Clog dancing. The wooden shoes hurt my feet," Buffy
responded in character as she moved towards the back of the car. "You do
have a spare right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I can't operate that step thingie," Cordelia
answered moving to the back of the car and opening the trunk. "Instructions
for an atomic bomb would probably be simpler to decipher."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, you don't have to operate
the step thingie," Buffy responded closing the trunk once the debutante
had removed the tire. "Just slip the tire on when I lift the back end of
the car up," she instructed. At that remark Cordelia raised her eyebrows
and looked over at Buffy doubtfully. "Just do it," Buffy said in response
to the look. She couldn't believe it, she saved the world on a weekly basis
yet Cordelia had trouble believing she could change a tire. It was ridiculous,
it was so Cordelia she would have laughed if she wasn't depressed. Besides
she didn't know how Cordelia would respond to it. She really had no desire
to verbally assaulted at the moment. That was what school was for.</p>

<p>After a moment mores hesitation Cordelia rolled the
tire around to where the flat was and waited for Buffy to raise the car
up. Once it was up Cordelia took off the ruined tire and put the new one
on.</p>

<p>"Don't take your time or anything," Buffy commented
once she had placed the car back down. Sure she was a Slayer but holding
cars up wasn't exactly fun for her.</p>

<p>"Aren't you like paid to be strong and lift things?"
Cordelia asked dusting off her hands.</p>

<p>"I'm not paid to do anything," Buffy responded dully,
dusting off her jacket. She had no life, she had no money, she had no recognition.
She had problems though, she had plenty of those.</p>

<p>"Well, thanks for the lifting and stuff," Cordelia
responded. There had been a subtle change in Buffy's demeanor and she wasn't
sure how to interpret it or respond to it. Not that she was usually a big
fan of etiquette.</p>

<p>"No problem, at least I KNOW I helped you," Buffy
responded putting her hands back into her pockets and heading across the
street. The cemetery awaited, the undead really hated it when you were
late. They were grouchy buggers.</p>

<p>"You help a lot of people," Cordelia said locking
the car and heading after Buffy. She had no idea why she was actually following
her and trying to be nice, but she was and she didn't want to expend the
energy necessary to stop.</p>

<p>"Like who?" Buffy asked surprised that Cordelia was
walking with her. Except for the week before, when Cordelia had helped
out with the research that had eventually linked Faith to the Mayor, she
had barely spoken to her, unless of course it was to insult her.</p>

<p>"Like that guy that time that had the thing, and
that girl that was like dead or something...and the fishpeople," Cordelia
answered not really being able to remember the details, only that most
of the time it was yucky and usually ended with her ruining some article
of clothing.</p>

<p>"That makes me feel so much better," Buffy responded
sarcastically. She wondered if Cordelia could have possibly vagued that
sentence up anymore?</p>

<p>"I was only trying to help," Cordelia responded,
somewhat insulted.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Buffy told her sincerely. Cordelia nodded
though Buffy couldn't see it and they continued to walk in silence.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile Cordelia would look over at
Buffy and sigh. She had so many things to consider. First of all she was
wondering why she had followed the girl into the cemetery, she hated the
cemetery--as most normal people did, and secondly she was wondering why
Buffy looked so sad, she looked like someone had killed her dog or something.
It bothered her that the other girl was upset, and that annoyed her. After
all Buffy and her Scooby gang had the been the cause of her exile from
the popular crowd, not to mention that since the Slayer had come to town
she had broken more nails and ruined more dresses than in her entire life
before, and that included the family's annual camping trip. Or as she liked
to think of it, 'hell week'.</p>

<p>"What's with the tragedy mask?" Cordelia asked finally.
The silence was getting to her. She was starting to think and that led
to wrinkles.</p>

<p>"Is that seriously your question?" Buffy asked incredulously
turning to the girl. "Were you not in the mansion a week ago?" Images of
Faith and Angel rushing through her brain. She could almost feel the knife
pressed to her throat again. That night had gone so wrong, it had all gone
so wrong.</p>

<p>"Oh, so it's about Faith and your boyfriend acting
all psycho and trying to torture and kill you," Cordelia surmised thinking
that that would indeed suck.</p>

<p>"Do you even think about what you're going to say
before the words come tumbling out of your mouth?" Buffy asked, stopping
and staring at Cordelia. She wasn't being sarcastic either, things just
seemed to pop out of the brunette's mouth without her knowing, or caring.
Even when she was trying to help, she was insulting. Like at her homecoming
party, when Cordelia jumped into her shoes and referred to her as a freak
of nature. Did she actually think that was helping?</p>

<p>"Are we back on that tack thing again?" Cordelia
asked. They had been over this and she decided that it wasn't worth the
effort.</p>

<p>"Why do you even care?" Buffy asked, tiring of the
conversation. "What are you trying to do anyway, get some new material
or something?" She continued starting to walk again. Truthfully it was
the only reason she could think of that would have made Cordelia follow
her out there.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I do," Cordelia responded surprising
herself. "Who would have thought it?" She asked shrugging her shoulders.
Buffy looked at her for a moment, looked into her eyes trying to find the
insincerity in the statement but there was none. Just honest curiosity,
and even a little empathy. Cordelia wasn't the only one surprised.</p>

<p>"Alright," Buffy said slowly, "I'll tell you," Buffy
said beginning to move again. At the time she had spotted Cordelia by her
car she was desperately lonely, and needing someone to talk to but not
knowing who. Not knowing who would understand, or be willing to listen,
so when Cordelia offered to be that ear Buffy found herself helpless to
resist. Stranger things had happened, afterall she did live on a hellmouth.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy pulled her jacket on, grabbed her bag and raced
down the stairs into the kitchen. Opening the refrigerator she took out
a carton of orange juice and poured some in a glass, drinking it quickly.
For the first time in a long time she had slept fitfully, too fitfully
seeing as how she was now rushing to get ready for school. Talking to Cordelia
had really helped if not ease her mind, then to lighten the burden. She
had actually been really surprised, when she had started to talk to Cordelia
the night before, she hadn't really been sure what to expect from her,
but as she talked Cordelia had patiently listened, commenting every so
often but for the most part just being there.</p>

<p>"Buffy are you ready?" Joyce called from the foyer.
If Buffy was ever on time for anything she probably would've had a heart
attack. The girl was even a week late being born.</p>

<p>"Yeah mom," Buffy responded picking up her bag and
heading out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"You're rather energetic this morning," Joyce commented
as they walked through the door. She definitely wasn't complaining though,
anything that put a smile on her daughters face couldn't be bad in her
opinion. Unless of course it was a demon, she really hoped it wasn't a
demon because they had been through that whole thing already.</p>

<p>"You know me, can't wait to fill my head with all
the knowledge school provides. Knowledge and cheesy fries," Buffy responded
locking the door. Joyce looked at her for a moment before entering the
jeep then shrugged. Sometimes it was better to just accept what came out
of her daughter's mouth without too much thought. She had learned that
it led to headaches.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As Buffy slipped into English class with a third
of a second to spare, she idly wondered why it was that when you were late
the bell seemed to sound three times as loud. Taking her seat she looked
at the guy beside her trying to see what he had done for homework. It wasn't
like she had done it or anything, but if she at least knew what it was
it would help when it was time to make up yet another excuse as to why
it wasn't done. Looking over to her right she spotted Cordelia looking
her way and gave a little smile which much to her surprise was returned.</p>

<p>"Today we will be looking at Hamlet's 'to be or not
to be' soliloquy," the English teacher started. Her name was Mrs. Engle,
or so Buffy thought, she was really going to have to start paying attention
to those things, that and start showing up for class. She figured that
knowing her teachers names, and showing up for their classes couldn't help
but endear her to them. Of course this was her last year at Sunnydale High
so learning their names now probably wouldn't have helped her anyway.</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Whatshername had finished reading the soliloquy
she started dividing the students up into pairs despite such eloquent objections
to it like, "What the hell is this? Kindergarten?", which was voiced by
Moose the schools quarter back. It was because of students like him that
Buffy was assured she would not be the worst student in the class. As for
her partner she ended up being paired with Cordelia. A few days ago this
would have seemed like a punishment/death sentence to her, but she was
pretty sure that it would out okay now. Buffy had learned that Cordelia
actually wasn't so bad when she wasn't shooting venom.</p>

<p>Half an hour or so later the bell rang and Buffy
began to pack up.</p>

<p>"How about you come over to my house tonight and
we work on it?" Cordelia asked sidling up her desk. Buffy jumped slightly
then looked up at her. She couldn't figure out how someone wearing three
inch heals could walk so quietly.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me., Buffy said standing up. "What
time?"</p>

<p>"Eight?" Cordelia asked realizing that Buffy probably
had to kill things first.</p>

<p>"It's a date," Buffy responded as they headed out
of the room.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As per usual, Buffy headed to the library after school
to meet up with Xander and Willow. The amount of time the three of them
spent in the library really was very scary. Pushing through the doors,
she spotted Xander sitting in one of the chairs with his feet propped up
on the table. Seeing this Buffy came to the conclusion that Giles was either
in his office, or out of the library. Probably the latter, since he was
like a prissy old woman when it came to people putting their feet on his
table.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Belvedere?" Buffy asked once she was
within acceptable speaking distance. Wesley had to meet with a representative
from the council to discuss Faith's situation which meant he wouldn't be
around for a few days for which she was eternally grateful. The way she
saw it, there were enough people to hate in the world without him working
so hard to add another.</p>

<p>"Staff meeting," Xander responded dropping his feet.
"I say we go into his office and re-arrange his roll-a-dex. It'll be mayhem,"
Xander continued with a grin.</p>

<p>"This is Giles' roll-a-dex we're talking about Xander.
How much mayhem could ensue? He losses the number for 'Tea bags-R- us'?"
Buffy asked taking a seat opposite Xander. "Where's Will?"</p>

<p>"Office. Computer stuff. Almost as boring as librarian
stuff, only she has access to nudie pictures should she so choose," Xander
responded. "So, you up for some Bronzing tonight?"</p>

<p>"Can't, I'm going to Cordelia's later," Buffy responded
blowing on her nails and rubbing them on her shirt. Slaying was murder
on her cuticles, it really was.</p>

<p>"Heh, I'm sorry what you just said sounded almost
like 'I'm going to Cordelia's later'. You meant you're cooking tortillas
later right? You and tortillas?" Xander questioned.</p>

<p>"Who's with tortillas?" Willow asked coming out of
Giles's office.</p>

<p>"Buffy's with tortillas," Xander responded.</p>

<p>"I'm not with tortillas. Tortillas and I are not
together. I said I'm going to Cordelia's later. Cor-del-ia's," Buffy stressed.</p>

<p>"But she's evil," Willow blurted out. "Mean, evil,
and skanky. That's the worst combination. I know, for I have walked in
those shoes, not to mention the leather bustier."</p>

<p>"Listen it's not like I'm going over to play scrabble
and when it's over we're going to braid each others hair. We have to do
a project to do for English class," Buffy explained slightly amused by
her friends' chagrin. "Besides, dealing with mean, evil, and yes even skanky
creatures is my destiny."</p>

<p>"Our thoughts and prayers will be with you," Xander
responded crossing his chest and mouthing a phony prayer.</p>

<p>"You're being rather harsh for someone who used to
share smoochies with this evil, mean, scanky, creature," Buffy commented
dryly.</p>

<p>"Well sure when you put it that way it sounds hypocritical,"
Xander said. "But you have to take into consideration the fact she called
me 'the boy with no cool'. She called ME 'the boy with no cool'," Xander
explained looking plaintively between his two friends.</p>

<p>"How could I have over looked that fact? You're right
she must be stopped," Buffy said turning to face him. "Just after we finish
the project," She continued with a grin.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Eight rolled around faster than Buffy had anticipated
and she had to cut her patrol short in order to make it to Cordelia's on
time. She didn't figure it would make a difference, since vamps seemed
to be in short supply anyway. She had never actually been over to Cordelia's
house before, but the place was impossible to miss.&nbsp; It was huge.
Buffy felt almost like she should be referring to it as "Chase Manor",
or something equally as grandiose. There was a winding driveway, and the
front was beautifully landscaped, all that was missing as far as she could
tell was a fountain with a sculpture of a nude man. Stepping up onto the
porch Buffy rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Come on in," Cordelia said by way of greeting once
she opened the door. Buffy smiled and walked past the other girl taking
in the interior. It was even better inside than outside.</p>

<p>"This place is gorgeous," Buffy commented turning
around to face Cordelia, who smiled.</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to tell mother you said that. She decorated
the place herself," Cordelia related. "I thought we would work in the living
room, it's this way," she continued a moment later. Buffy simply nodded
and followed her.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything to drink?" Cordelia asked once
they had their books set up.</p>

<p>"Whatever you're having," Buffy answered.</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll be right back," Cordelia said, getting
up. Buffy watched her exit the room then turned back to her books. She
hadn't really taken notice when she first came in, but Cordelia was dressed
in jeans and sweat shirt and it disconcerted her slightly. She had never
the other girl wear something like that. They suited her though, especially
the jeans which showed off the curve of her hips.</p>

<p>By the time Cordelia returned, Buffy had flipped
her book open and was jotting down some notes.</p>

<p>"Here you go," Cordelia said placing a wine cooler
down in front of Buffy. She was feeling kind of nervous for some reason
and figured that it would help calm her nerves. Besides, she figured that
if Buffy was fine to begin with it could only make her relax more which
was never bad.</p>

<p>"It's illegal to serve alcohol to minors you know,"
Buffy commented opening the bottle.</p>

<p>"I won't tell if you don't," Cordelia responded sitting
on the other side of the coffee table.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once they figured out what angle they wanted to approach
the project from Phase I ran relatively smoothly. Surprising each other
they worked exceptionally well together. Although it wasn't a surprise,
they discovered that their minds operated totally differently, but that
they also learned that the differences were complimentary, each of them
able to put a different spin on the same thing.</p>

<p>"I don't know about you, but I could use a break,"
Cordelia commented about an hour later. "I'm starting to go cross-eyed,"
she added rubbing her eyes for effect. She had actually been surprised
when she looked at the clock and saw how much time had passed. Usually
homework felt like it was taking longer than it actually was, tonight was
the total opposite.</p>

<p>"I'm all for that," Buffy agreed standing up to stretch
her legs. She could hardly believe it but she was actually having a pretty
good time. "When are your parents coming home anyway?" Buffy asked wondering
if they should get rid of the bottles.</p>

<p>"They're not. At least not tonight, they're at a
convention in Palm Springs for the week," Cordelia responded standing up
as well to work out some of the kinks.</p>

<p>"Sounds like fun," Buffy commented moving up onto
the couch.</p>

<p>"Yeah, dad gets paid for golfing, and mom gets to
play canasta all day," Cordelia responded joining Buffy on the couch. "You
want to watch some TV or something?"</p>

<p>"Sure. It beats the hell out of staring at the wall,"
Buffy responded turning away from the wall.</p>

<p>"Right," Cordelia said standing up and wandering
out to the room. She came back a minute later with more wine coolers and
a converter. After pulling open the doors to the entertainment center she
rejoined Buffy on the couch and started flipping through the channels.</p>

<p>"How about that," Buffy suggested a few minutes later.
The way Cordelia was channel surfing was starting to make her couch sick.</p>

<p>"Xena?" Cordelia asked with raised eyebrows. "Don't
you get enough violence in your life without watching it on TV?"</p>

<p>"Professional interest," Buffy responded turning
to face her. They stared at each other for a few seconds in a battle of
the wills before Cordelia finally relented.</p>

<p>"Know that I'm doing this only because you are my
guest," She said putting the converter down. She had actually liked the
show when it was good.</p>

<p>"What happened to her hair?" Buffy asked a minute
later referring to Gabrielle's new do.</p>

<p>"She cut it," Cordelia answered thinking that that
was fairly obvious. She figured that's what happened when you fought vampires
daily, the memory was bound to go sooner or later. The human brain wasn't
designed to take that kind of constant trauma. All you had to do was look
at professional boxing, or the NFL.</p>

<p>"Thanks Albert. I meant why?" Buffy responded. Cordelia
shrugged.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Cordelia responded. What was she
one of Dionne Warwicks' physic friends? "Maybe her woman likes it that
way," she added after a moment.</p>

<p>"I see you've bought into the propaganda," Buffy
commented with a smile. She couldn't wait to hear Cordelia's view on this
one.</p>

<p>"What propaganda?" Cordelia asked turning to face
Buffy. "That time you died you and Willow didn't tongue wrestle on a spiritual
plain did you? And when was the last time the two of you took turns scrubbing
each others backs in a hot tub?" Cordelia continued.</p>

<p>"There was never a first time but I see your point,"
Buffy conceded.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come around to my line of thinking,"
Cordelia said pleased. Winning always made her happy. "Anyway, they make
kind of a cute couple," she continued taking a drink. Buffy looked over
at her quizzically but she didn't notice.</p>

<p>"I could think of worse," Buffy said finally in response
to Cordelia's comment.</p>

<p>"I've had worse," Cordelia responded darkly.</p>

<p>"Xander's my friend you know," Buffy said in response
to what she knew was a shot at her friend.</p>

<p>"Would you date him?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"No, but that's not the point," Buffy told her. There
were just some people you weren't at all attracted to and for her Xander
was one of those people. She loved the guy, she just didn't LOVE the guy.</p>

<p>"Trust me I know all about the POINT," Cordelia responded,
and Buffy recognized the reference to her impalement.</p>

<p>"He didn't intend to hurt you," Buffy told her after
a moment.</p>

<p>"You know what they say the road to hell is paved
with," Cordelia responded shifting in the chair. Not receiving an answer
Cordelia looked over at Buffy and saw the look on her face. Silently she
cursed herself realizing that that was more than a saying for Buffy. "Sorry,
I didn't mean..." She said letting the rest of the sentence hang.</p>

<p>"It's okay, I mean it is a saying," Buffy responded.
"We should probably get back to the homework thing."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia agreed moving back over to the table.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As Buffy suggested they did indeed get back to the
homework thing, and worked diligently on it for quite some time before
Cordelia broke the silence. That seemed to be a theme with her.</p>

<p>"You know what? Hamlet is a jerk," she declared.</p>

<p>"You're just figuring this out now?" Buffy asked
having come to that conclusion somewhere around Act II.</p>

<p>"No, I mean really. He neglects his kingdom, he beats
his girlfriend, he tells off his mother, he kills his childhood friends,"
Cordelia said ranting. "Sometimes I swear I could just do without men all
together," she continued without even thinking.</p>

<p>"Really?" Buffy asked attentively. She noticed that
her voice was slightly slurred and realized that they had been kicking
back quite a few of the wine coolers.</p>

<p>"Yeah really," Cordelia answered surprising herself
with the adamancy of the statement. She was going to have to lay off the
coolers.</p>

<p>"Really?" Buffy said again. "Like the show?" she
asked curiously as she gestured towards the ending episode of Xena.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Cordelia answered, her brain starting to
resister where this conversation was going. In her mind she saw a big flashing
red light but she couldn't quite seem to stop.</p>

<p>"Really?" Buffy asked once again.</p>

<p>"What are you stoned? Can't you say something besides
'really'?" Cordelia asked peevishly.</p>

<p>"Have ever you thought about it?" Buffy asked a few
seconds later ignoring Cordelia's comments. Sometimes it was best to ignore
her when she got all pissy like that. Confrontation only led to more bitching.</p>

<p>"Have you?" Cordelia asked Buffy curiously.</p>

<p>"Well this is productive," Buffy commented in regards
to the complete lack of information being exchanged.</p>

<p>"Why don't you just answer the question then?" Cordelia
asked her. She had been prepared to let the subject drop before but now
she was interested. She knew what her answer was and wanted to know what
Buffy's was.</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" Buffy shot back wanting to know
equally as bad.</p>

<p>"Fine then. On three," Cordelia stated. "One...two...three."</p>

<p>"Yes,"&nbsp; they answered simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Really?" Cordelia asked not being able to resist.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy responded. They were now staring at
each other intently from across the table. Throughout the course of the
night Buffy had taken more and more notice of how nice Cordelia actually
did look, and she was noticing again now. "Have you ever kissed a girl?"
Buffy asked finally breaking the silence. She figured it was her turn.</p>

<p>"Not really," Cordelia answered watching as Buffy
licked her lips. She wanted to kiss one at that moment though.</p>

<p>"That's not a real answer," Buffy said frowning.</p>

<p>"Okay, once in seventh grade. But it wasn't really
a kiss, it was a non-kiss. As far as real kisses go, then no," Cordelia
related in a rush. "What about you?"</p>

<p>"No. Almost once, but her parents came home," Buffy
told her looking at the wall.She returned her gaze to Cordelia after a
few seconds and the girls were left staring at each other, each thinking
the same thing but afraid to voice it, afraid that they were misunderstanding
the other and what it could mean if they were. Fingers drummed against
the table top, hair was pushed behind ears, but at the end of it all two
pairs of eyes, one brown and one blue met again and again, waiting. The
homework which was spread across the table was long forgotten, both girls
preoccupied with the realization that they were standing at a line. They
could step away from it, chalk all the talk up to wine coolers and forget
the conversation had ever taken place, or they could step over the line
and make what they were both feeling very real.</p>

<p>"Do you want to find out?" Cordelia asked, finally
breaking the silence. She didn't even know why she was offering. Of all
the people to experiment with she never would have guessed she would end
up asking Buffy Summers. Besides, if it ever got out that she kissed a
girl it could be the cause of an even bigger backspace then the one she
had suffered when she went out with Xander. Though not by much.</p>

<p>"God yes," Buffy breathed out. For the last few seconds
her eyes had been darting between Cordelia's chocolate brown eyes and her
slightly parted lips. When the question was posed, she didn't even have
to think about the answer, she wanted it.</p>

<p>"Me too," Cordelia said, sliding over to Buffy's
side of the table. Hesitantly she placed her hand on Buffy thigh, "My parents
aren't going to come home and interrupt," Cordelia said looking at Buffy
intently. She was giving Buffy one last chance to back out. If she really
didn't want it then she could say so and Cordelia would go back over to
her side of the table and they could forget everything. That was one good
thing about living in Sunnydale, the residents were the rulers of denial.</p>

<p>"Good," was all the Slayer said in response. They
sat there side by side for a few seconds, each waiting for the other to
make the first move. Finally not being able to hold back any longer Buffy
leaned forward and kissed Cordelia's lips gently, then pulled back waiting
for the other girls reaction. The kiss was light, just a tease really and
it worked, leaving Cordelia wanting more. Raising her hand, Cordelia rested
it on Buffy's cheek and brought their lips together again. This kiss was
firmer, less hesitant, more passionate, and Buffy moaned softly as Cordelia's
tongue caressed her bottom lip, sucking on it gently. Cordelia exhaled
against Buffy's lips then pressed hers against Buffy's harder as she slid
her hand across her back. Buffy moved her hand up to hold Cordelia closer
and let her tongue brush against her lips parting them with soft stokes.</p>

<p>Eventually the need for oxygen led them to separate.
Parted but still touching they looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Wow," Buffy whispered, her body tingling. She hadn't
really known what to expect, only that she hadn't been expecting the electrifying
joining she and Cordelia had just shared. She was glad she was sitting
down because she was pretty sure that if she was standing she would have
swooned. That was totally unacceptable for a Slayer.</p>

<p>"I'd say that pretty much sums it up," Cordelia agreed,
a small smile making it's way across her face. She had always thought Buffy
had great lips. Now she knew Buffy had great lips and just what they were
capable of.</p>

<p>"Really?" Buffy asked smiling herself now at what
had become a running joke. Actually she was glad Cordelia was feeling some
of what she was feeling because she really, really wanted to try that again.</p>

<p>"Yes, really," Cordelia answered leaning forward
and bringing their lips together again.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Damn," Cordelia muttered around Buffy's questing
tongue as she blindly moved her hand around searching for the ringing phone.
Breaking her lips away she pushed the power button, "Hello?".</p>

<p>"Hello... Cordelia? Is Buffy there?" It was Joyce.</p>

<p>"Yes, just a second," Cordelia told the older woman
trying to get her breathing under control. Placing her hand over the receiver
she looked at Buffy. "It's your mom."</p>

<p>"She always did have impeccable timing," Buffy noted
dryly taking the phone from Cordelia. "Hey...yeah...uh huh. No, just homework
and Hamlet, Hamlet and homework, the two 'H's'. Yeah, okay...no I just
lost track. Yeah, bye," Buffy said pushing the off button.</p>

<p>"You have to go?" Cordelia asked even though she
already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"Bingo," Buffy responded shaking her head. "I'm allowed
to save the world as long as I make curfew," she continued ruefully.</p>

<p>"Do you want a ride?" Cordelia asked even though
she wanted nothing more than for Buffy to stay right where she was.</p>

<p>"That'd be nice," Buffy said, glad that she would
have the extra time with Cordelia it would take to drive home. "I, ah,
actually don't want to go," she admitted as they started to pack up.</p>

<p>"Well that's a relief since I don't really want you
to either," Cordelia said.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought it?" Buffy asked as they
made their way out of the living room.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy lay awake in her bed for a good hour after
getting in. She couldn't quite get her mind to wrap around the idea that
in less than 48 hours she and Cordelia had gone from being virtually mortal
enemies to being whatever they were now would be classified as. It wasn't
even the fact that Cordelia was a girl that had her so confused, that had
always made sense to her, it was more the fact that Cordelia was, well,
Cordelia. They had always had a somewhat turbulent relationship with the
occasional moment of concern, like when Cordelia so delicately warned her
about her 'Joan Collins 'tude, or like the night before when she had talked
to the other girl and she had listened to her. She couldn't deny the fact
though that she definitely did have feelings for the her. She was at least
able to take comfort in the fact that Cordelia seemed to be feeling the
same way she was, or at least close there to by the way she responded to
their kissing. There was one thing she though that she was sure of and
that was that she was really, really looking forward to English class tomorrow.</p>

<p>As Buffy's eyes finally closed in sleep, Cordelia
was still lying awake in her room pondering exactly the same questions
Buffy was asking herself. The truth of the matter was that she had never
responded to a kiss the way she did to Buffy's. It was all that she could
think about. If she closed her eyes she could feel Buffy's lips pressed
against hers, feel the warmth of her body as they pressed together. The
fact was that despite her best efforts not to she did care for Buffy, as
their conversation from the night before testified to. She had promised
herself that after everything that happened with Xander, she wouldn't open
herself up to them again, that she wouldn't allow them to hurt to her anymore
and she meant to keep that promise. She had actually started to think of
them as friends when everything with Willow and Xander went down, and it
had left her feeling betrayed and hurt. Now with everything that had happened
in the past few days, that was all up in the air, everything was up in
the air. As she closed her eyes one last time the only thing that she could
be sure of was that she was really looking forward to English class.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Cordelia made her way hurriedly through the hallway's
of Sunnydale High with a single minded determinedness that few possessed,
only stopping once when Harmony asked for her advice about a third date
'I'm ready' outfit. She was trying to get to the library because she knew
that Buffy would be there. She was always there. She had only seen the
other girl for a few minutes in English class before half the class was
whisked away to an assembly. It was done alphabetically and Chase and Summers
where at opposite ends of the spectrum. She hadn't been able to get the
previous night's activity out of her head and it now seemed inordinately
important that she see Buffy.</p>

<p>Pushing through the doors to the library she spotted
Buffy immediately. She was seated on the left side of the table beside
Willow. Xander and Oz were there too, but her attention was focused on
the petite blond whose face lit up when she walked in the room. Tearing
her gaze away from Buffy she turned to Giles who was standing behind the
counter. "I need books. Books to read," she stated as her eyes helplessly
drifted back to where Buffy was.</p>

<p>"Sorry CC, Wesley's not here," Xander stated. "You
should probably go across the street to the public school if you want to
find him," he continued. "He's into younger women," he ended in a hushed
tone.</p>

<p>"I've got a better idea, why don't you--" Cordelia
started to say but she was interrupted by Giles. She didn't even really
like Wesley she was just doing what she did because it pissed Xander off
and that made her happy.</p>

<p>"What book are looking for?" Giles asked, stopping
whatever Cordelia was going suggest Xander do. He wasn't in the mood to
watch a catfight between the two of them.</p>

<p>"Uh...The Edible Woman," Cordelia responded trying
to think of a book the man was unlikely to have handy.</p>

<p>"I'll have to look that up," Giles responded moving
from behind the counter and over to the card catalogue.</p>

<p>"Haven't you gotten that on computer yet?" Cordelia
asked moving to take the open seat at the front of the table while Giles
opened up the drawer. "You and one guy in Yemen are, like, the only people
who haven't joined the rest of the world in the twentieth century," Cordelia
continued.</p>

<p>"Yes, well...you see it's a very complicated..."
Giles started then trailed off as he leafed through the index cards. Why
couldn't they just leave him alone with his cards and books?</p>

<p>"Well this is fun," Cordelia commented a few seconds
later, referring to silence that was blanketing the room like marijuana
at a heavy metal concert. "Later on we'll have to get some fluid and embalm
each other," she continued earning a laugh from Buffy which immediately
caused three sets off eyes to focus on the Slayer.</p>

<p>"What? It was funny," Buffy said defensively looking
at each of them.</p>

<p>It took Giles a few more moments to locate Cordelia's
book. Once he had found it he handed it over to her, then rolled out the
book trolley.</p>

<p>"Researching the night away once more? Don't you
people ever do anything that doesn't involve books written in the Medieval
times?" Cordelia asked, looking at the cart like it was diseased. This
was one thing she didn't miss about hanging out with the gang. She had
gone through enough books in one month of hanging out with them to last
her a lifetime, possibly two.</p>

<p>"You're welcome to partake in the fun, or I guess
in this case it would be the total lack thereof," Buffy offered looking
over at Cordelia expectantly. She was disconcertingly delighted that the
other girl had come to find her and she wanted her to stay.</p>

<p>"If you insist," Cordelia responded nonchalantly
as she took off her jacket. Secretly, she was glad Buffy had invited her
to stay. Even though they wouldn't be able to talk about what had happened
the night before with the others around she found that being in the Slayers
presence gave her the happies. "I'm not promising to actually read them
though," she added for effect.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dream of asking you to," Buffy responded,
grabbing two books from the cart and handing one to Cordelia. As Buffy
handed out the rest of the books, she missed the doubtful looks her friends
were giving her. Since Xander and Cordelia's break up the plan had been
to get their dealings with the debutante over and done with as soon as
possible, and by inviting her to stay Buffy had just violated the first
rule of Cordelia dealing.</p>

<p>"What are we researching anyway?" Cordelia asked
once she realized she had no idea what she was looking for.</p>

<p>"Info on Graduation Day," Oz said speaking for the
first time.</p>

<p>"It's June 4th, besides I hardly see how your going
to find anything about it in these things," Cordelia said receiving looks
from her table mates. "Oh, the other Graduation Day, with the guy with
no arms, and demons and stuff. Got it."</p>

<p>"Don't Xander," Buffy warned seeing the glint in
her friends eyes. She had no desire to see him and Cordelia verbally spare
yet again.</p>

<p>"You're right it's too easy. Just know that I had
a come back, a good one," Xander said backing down and picking up his book.
Opening hers Buffy silently wondered what she had just gotten herself into.
She hadn't even really thought about inviting Cordelia to stay, she had
just wanted her to so she did. It was becoming clear to her, however, that
being around Cordelia alone, and being around Cordelia with the rest of
the gang were two different stories. Sighing, she decided that what was
done was done, besides, depending on how things worked out with what happened
the night before she might just have to get everybody use to having her
around again. However that was another story altogether.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>They had been at it for over three hours when Buffy
announced that she had to go on patrol. When Buffy announced that she had
to leave Giles decided that the rest of them had put in their dues and
called it a night. As they were all getting ready to go, Cordelia made
her way over to Buffy.</p>

<p>"Do you want to come over when your finished with
patrol so we can finish the project?" Cordelia asked, very mindful of the
other three people standing suspiciously close to them. If Buffy hadn't
been standing there, she probably would have said something, but since
Buffy was indeed standing in front of her, she just waited for the Slayer's
answer.</p>

<p>"Same bat time, same bat channel?" Buffy asked shooting
a look at her nosey friends.</p>

<p>"Yep," Cordelia responded.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a plan," Buffy agreed. "I'll see you
then."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>It took Buffy a little longer than she had anticipated
to get to over to Cordelia's. She had finished her sweep and was on her
way over to the other girls house she heard a commotion an alley way. Going
to check it out, as she was known to do, she spotted a vamp trying to make
a happy meal out of a taxi driver. After a few minutes of fighting the
thing had actually ran off, and she had to follow it. Needless to say it
was a particularly satisfying kill.</p>

<p>"What happened to you?" Cordelia asked as Buffy stepped
in the front door.</p>

<p>"El loco vampo decided it would be fun to wrestle,"
Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"Nude?" Cordelia asked remembering Faith's little
story. Oddly it was more appealing to her now that it was Buffy than it
had been to her before.</p>

<p>"No, I'm Buffy. Buf-fy," the Slayer responded noticing
Cordelia looked a little crestfallen when she said she wasn't nude. Cordelia
nodded and led them to the living room. When they arrived Buffy noticed
with some amusement that there were Cokes and only Cokes on the table.</p>

<p>They worked quietly if not competently on the project
for the next hour. Neither of them were really paying attention to what
they doing. They were studying alright, just not Hamlet. Finally alone
together they could feel the connection they had last night, and in the
library grow but neither knew quite how to bring it up.</p>

<p>"You're thinking about it aren't you?" Cordelia asked
though it was more of a statement than a question. She had become freakishly
aware of every little noise in the house and it was driving her crazy.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy admitted. "It's all I've been thinking
about since you dropped me off last night actually."</p>

<p>"Well it's nice to know I'm not the only one who's
been afflicted," Cordelia commented with a smile.</p>

<p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Buffy asked, though
she knew what she wanted to do.</p>

<p>"I'd rather do," Cordelia admitted noting the way
Buffy's face lit up at the suggestion. All she had wanted to do all day
was taste Buffy's lips.</p>

<p>"That's works for me. After all I'm a woman of action,"
Buffy responded, sliding up onto the couch and waiting for Cordelia to
join her. Taking the hint Cordelia climbed onto the couch and leaned over
to bring her lips to Buffy's.</p>

<p>As the kiss deepened Buffy leaned back, and Cordelia
draped her body over the Slayer's. Buffy moaned and trailed her hand up
Cordelia's sides lightly brushing her breast before tangling her hands
in the brunette's hair. Cordelia's breathing quickened at the light touch,
and she moaned into Buffy's mouth. Encouraged by Cordelia's response to
her touch, Buffy untangled her hands from Cordelia's hair and lowered them
to her waist. She left them there for a moment as Cordelia lowered her
head to suck on her neck, then as the other girl moved back up to capture
her mouth Buffy slowly inched her hands under Cordelia's shirt reveling
in warm skin she found underneath. Cordelia arched into Buffy's hands as
the girl continued to stroke her sides.</p>

<p>"You're driving me crazy," Cordelia murmured.</p>

<p>"That's the idea," Buffy mumbled back, nibbling on
Cordelia's earlobe.</p>

<p>"I...." Whatever response Cordelia was going to make
was cut off when Buffy's hands found her breasts and squeezed lightly.
Groaning Cordelia arched further into Buffy's strong hands and let her
own start to wander. Reaching the bottom of Buffy's shirt Cordelia let
her hands slip underneath. "More," she whispered moving back slightly so
that she could see Buffy's face. Slowly she lifted the tank top over the
Slayer's head tossing it to the side. Once the shirt was over her head
Buffy looked into Cordelia's eyes which were focused on her partially clad
chest. Impassioned by the fiery look in the brunettes eyes Buffy tilted
her head up and crushed her lips to Cordelia's.</p>

<p>Soon Cordelia's shirt joined the rapidly growing
pile of clothing on the floor and it was Buffy's turn to stare. Her gaze
was broken, however, when Cordelia bent down to suck on her pulse point.</p>

<p>"Umm," was the only thing Buffy was able to get out
before Cordelia moved further down, dipping her tongue between Buffy's
breasts and sucking softly.</p>

<p>"This has got to go," Cordelia said reaching around
behind Buffy to undo her bra. Lifting her head up from Buffy's tantalizingly
soft skin so that she could concentrate on what she was doing Cordelia
froze.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Buffy asked seeing the look on Cordelia's
face and feeling her body tense. She silently cursed herself thinking that
they had gone to fast and Cordelia was having second thoughts. There were
plenty of hormones floating around the room, but did care about Cordelia
and didn't want to think that she had alienated her or pressured her.</p>

<p>"Angel," Cordelia said. Buffy looked at her for second
wondering why she felt the need to bring him up at that particular moment.</p>

<p>"Angel and I aren't together anymore," Buffy started.
"What we had was...." She was interrupted by Cordelia before she could
continue.</p>

<p>"I'd really like to hear that story sometime, really,
but that's not what I meant," Cordelia said. "He's outside the window right
now, staring at me."</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked shifting so that she could see
out the window in question. "Oh," Buffy said seeing that Angel was indeed
standing outside the window staring at them. "Um...."</p>

<p>"Should we let him in?" Cordelia asked not really
knowing what the etiquette was for a situation like this.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I mean he's got to be here for a reason,"
Buffy said starting to move into a sitting position.</p>

<p>"He was just faking crazy, right?" Cordelia asked
as she reached for her shirt. She may have to let him in but she wasn't
going to do it half dressed.</p>

<p>"Yeah. He was just faking," Buffy said pulling her
own shirt over her head and walking over to the window. Nodding to Angel
she motioned him towards the sliding doors in the kitchen. By the time
Buffy had the door open Cordelia was standing behind her.</p>

<p>"Hello Cordelia," he said in his trademarked soft
voice.</p>

<p>"Hey," she responded after a second not really knowing
how to act. I mean what did one say to the vampire ex-boyfriend of the
girl one was just groping?</p>

<p>"I...ah, there's trouble in the town square. I stopped
by the Bronze and Willow said you were over here, ah...studying," he explained
keeping his gaze locked on the floor. Although it didn't really show, he
was not at all expecting to see what he saw.</p>

<p>"What's the up?" Buffy asked not to comfortable with
the situation herself. She hadn't talked to him since that night at the
mansion and this wasn't helping that 'not so comfortable around Angel'
feeling.</p>

<p>"It's Faith," he said looking up now. "She's leading
a coterie of vampire's around breaking into stores. It looks like they're
trying to stock up on supplies."</p>

<p>"I should contact Giles," Buffy said, already slipping
to Slayer mode.</p>

<p>"Willow said she was on it, they're probably already
on their way over," Angel responded. "I was sent to get you, which I guess
I have, so...I'll just wait for you...." He motioned towards outside then
headed back out the sliding doors.</p>

<p>"You really should get paid for this," Cordelia said
realizing that their night was shot.</p>

<p>"I've got to--"</p>

<p>"I know," Cordelia said. "I'll drive."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>It was around midnight by the time Cordelia pulled
up in front of Buffy's house to drop her off. The face-off with Faith had
not been fun. By the time they arrived, the vamps had vandalized about
four stores and were well on their way to filling up their goody bags.
Faith had been hiding out in the shadows until Buffy showed up, only coming
out once the fighting had started. At the end five of her ten vamps had
been dusted and the rest had formed a semi-circle around her. The only
thing she had said was, "Graduation Day. Me and you, B. Then we'll see
who's the real deal," and they had taken off.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Cordelia asked once she had parked
in the Summers driveway. Buffy had been quiet the whole ride and she was
worried. Buffy had come to mean a great deal more to her than she was willing
to admit over the past few days.</p>

<p>"I will be," Buffy responded tilting her head so
that she was looking at Cordelia. "Are you okay?" she asked. She had noticed
Cordelia get pushed to side during the fray and had wanted to go over,
but she'd had her hands full at the time.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia answered. She had actually broken
her watch but it didn't seem so important at the moment.</p>

<p>"I should probably get going. Mom's probably freaking,"
Buffy said though she made no effort to actually get out of the car.</p>

<p>"Probably. Freaking isn't a good look on parents,
usually leads to grounding and lectures," Cordelia agreed not really concentrating
on what was coming out of her mouth. She was beginning to think that maybe
Buffy was onto something with that. "I'll see you tomorrow right?" She
asked after moment.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy responded. "We've still got to finish
that project," she added with a smile. Poor Hamlet, he'd been so neglected
those past few days.</p>

<p>"Good," Cordelia said smiling as well. Knowing that
she would see Buffy tomorrow made her forget all about the fact that her
favorite watch had been ruined. After a moments hesitation Buffy leaned
over and softly kissed Cordelia on the lips.</p>

<p>"I'll see you tomorrow," Buffy said opening the door
this time. Cordelia said goodbye and waved as Buffy made her way to the
door. Once she was inside Cordelia put the car in reverse and backed out
of the driveway smiling.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Cordelia looked up as the doors to the cafeteria
opened up and Buffy walked in. Just as the brunette's eyes had been drawn
to the Slayer, Buffy looked over at Cordelia as soon as she walked in the
room. Their gazes held as Buffy crossed to sit with the gang only being
broken when Melody directed a question at Cordelia. Regretfully Cordelia
turned around asking the girl to repeat whatever insipid question she had
asked.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffster," Xander greeted as Buffy sat down
next to Oz.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself," Buffy responded. "What's the sitch?"</p>

<p>"Whatever the opposite of&nbsp; the festivities we
were discussing last night," Oz said snagging a fry from Willow's plate.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the joy that is Faith," Buffy said making
a face. She still couldn't believe that the other Slayer had turned on
them. Sure things hadn't always run smoothly, and they did have differences
in their approach to doing the job, but there was nothing so wrong that
would have warranted Faith turning on her. At least she didn't think there
was. After the incident with Allan, Buffy was sure that if she could just
get Faith to open up she could've helped her deal, after all she understood
more than anyone what Faith was going through. Like she had told Willow,
in another circumstance it could have been Faith. But after their fight
in the mansion Buffy realized that whatever problems Faith had went way
beyond her and anything that had happened to her since she arrived in Sunnydale.
But despite all that had happened, there was still something there and
Buffy was not looking forward to their next confrontation.</p>

<p>Buffy listened with half an ear as her friends talked
about the night before, and traded ideas on what they would like to do
to Faith if they got their hands on her, but she wasn't up to Faith-bashing
herself and found her attention drawn to Cordelia where she was seated
across the room. The brunette was leaning against the back of her chair
with her legs and arms crossed, and Buffy could tell that she was beyond
bored with whatever was being said. However, knowing the girls she was
sitting with that didn't surprise the Slayer at all. Every once in a while
Cordelia would look over in her direction and they would hold each gaze
until their attention was demanded elsewhere only to return again a few
minutes later. It was during that time that Buffy realized whatever they
had embarked upon that night in Cordelia's house had gone beyond the experimentation
stage and crossed into full fledged emotions. She wasn't sure exactly what
she would classify the emotions Cordelia was bringing up in her as, only
that they were the good kind, and as Cordelia looked over at Buffy once
more, the Slayer knew that whatever she was feeling was being felt by Cordelia
too.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>With everything that had been going on, the gang
needed to have some fun, so it was decided that Bronzing was in high order
for the night. Buffy would sweep, Buffy would slay, then they all would
party, 'cause partying was fun, and that was the whole idea of evening,
fun. The place was packed by the time they got there, but luckily they
were able to get their usual seats when the people who had been previously
occupying them got up to play pool.</p>

<p>"Alright people, who's ready to giggy wit' it?" Xander
asked, hopping to his feet and clapping his hands together.</p>

<p>"One order of gig right here," Buffy said rising
as well. The sweep she had made before coming was a bust and she had some
energy to burn.</p>

<p>"Looks like it's just you and I," Xander said to
Buffy. Willow and Oz were cuddling on the couch and didn't even seem to
have heard them. "Lucky you," Xander continued grabbing Buffy's arm and
tugging her onto the dance floor.</p>

<p>As if on cue, when they got out there the band started
a new song. This one was slow, with a pulsing beat, very sensuous. Buffy
and Xander worked their way into the middle of the crowd and started swaying.
Sometimes together, sometimes separately. Buffy wasn't really paying attention
to what she was doing, she was just listening to the music, letting it
tell her body what to do. As her mind started to drift and her body freed
up she was totally relaxed until she bumped into someone lightly. Turning
around to apologize she realized the person she had bumped into was Cordelia.
They regarded each other for a moment before Buffy finally started to move
again, Cordelia joining her.</p>

<p>For the rest of the song, and the one after it they
danced near each other, sometimes together, sometimes not, sometimes touching,
sometimes not, but no matter where they were their eyes never left each
other. The only time their gaze broke was when the band stopped playing
and they were whisked away to their separate corners.</p>

<p>"Was that Cordelia you were dancing with?" Willow
asked Buffy when they rejoined.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I bumped into her," Buffy responded somewhat
distractedly.</p>

<p>"Have you two finished that project yet?" Xander
asked. Cordelia was monopolizing the groups already limited Buffy time.
She was suppose to slay then hang out with THEM.</p>

<p>"Almost," Buffy responded turning to face him. "Things
keep coming up so it's taking us a awhile. You know, such is the life of
a Slayer."</p>

<p>"I hear ya sister," Xander responded.</p>

<p>Buffy listened for a while exchanging looks with
Willow as Xander and Oz argued over which Captain was better. The contestants
were Captain Kirk and Captain Picard. The verdict according to Buffy was
'boring'.</p>

<p>"I'll be back," Buffy said. "Will, make sure to take
notes," She added earning a look from Xander.</p>

<p>From across the room Cordelia noticed Buffy get up
and move towards one of the side exits. The current topic of conversation
at her table was Ricky Martin's leather pants and she had pretty much exhausted
her knowledge of the subject. Mumbling some excuse to the group she got
up and followed Buffy out of the building.</p>

<p>"Hey," Cordelia said as she spotted Buffy leaning
against the side of the building.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Looking for you. What are you doing out here?"</p>

<p>"Fresh air," Buffy responded. She was starting to
feel a little claustrophobic in there. Cordelia raised an eyebrow as she
looked at their surroundings. "It's better than mass unwashed bodies,"
Buffy responded dryly.</p>

<p>"I'll take your word on that," Cordelia said. Dancing
with Buffy had gotten her kind of worked up.</p>

<p>"It's...." Whatever Buffy was going to say in response
was cut off by Cordelia's lips pressing against her own. Buffy responded
to the kiss raising her hand and tangling it in Cordelia's hair as she
deepened the kiss. "We should definitely go dancing sometime," Buffy commented
when they separated.</p>

<p>"Definitely," Cordelia agreed. "But until then,"
She continued leaning forward again.</p>

<p>Buffy returned to the gang a while later, excusing
her absence by saying that she got into a tangle in the alley, which was
true in a way. They stayed at the Bronze for another hour or so dancing
and playing pool before deciding to call it a night. As they entered the
parking lot Buffy spotted Cordelia. After parting with the gang Buffy started
to make her way over to Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Hey," Cordelia greeted as Buffy made her way over
to her. Oz, Willow and Xander had just pulled away leaving them alone in
the parking lot.</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"Hey," Cordelia said again as Buffy joined her leaning
against her car.</p>

<p>"I think we've covered this already," Buffy commented
looking sideways at Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Right. You want a lift home?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"I've got to make a sweep before I head home," Buffy
responded.</p>

<p>"Want some company?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," Buffy said smiling.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"...so that basically sums up my feelings on the
subject of pastels and Capri pants," Cordelia concluded as they headed
out of downtown and towards the cemetery.</p>

<p>"That was very enlightening, Cordelia. What's next
the history of hot pants?" Buffy asked with a smirk that faded when Cordelia
shot her a look. "I was joking, as I've been known to do from time to time.
The ideal response would be laughing and praises to my wit, but I suppose
the evil eye is also applicable," Buffy said when Cordelia continued to
glare at her. "There was that joke thing again," Buffy explained. "Oh come
on, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Fine. You're forgiven," Cordelia responded. "However,
since hot pants are obviously of no interest to you, what do you want to
talk about?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Us," Buffy said as they entered the cemetery.</p>

<p>"There's an us?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"I was under the impression that there was an us,"
Buffy mumbled. She was beginning to think that perhaps she was placing
more importance on whatever they were than Cordelia was, and it didn't
sit well with her.</p>

<p>"There's an us," Cordelia confirmed, hearing Buffy's
tone. She hadn't meant what she said to come out that way. She was glad
there was a 'them', she just wanted to know if that's what Buffy meant.
After she spoke they walked for a few moments in silence before Buffy broke
it.</p>

<p>"I like you," Buffy said, keeping her eyes focused
on their surroundings.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I caught that," Cordelia responded, watching
Buffy out the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>"I'm serious," Buffy said. "Girl talking seriously
right here."</p>

<p>"I know, I seriously caught that," Cordelia responded.
"You know I like you too don't you? I mean you like me, I like you, it
works out well that way don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but that not what I meant, well it is what
I meant but not what I meant at the same time. It's some weird amalgamate
of what I meant and some other meaning," Buffy responded, not really following
her own sentence.</p>

<p>"You lost me somewhere after 'yeah'," Cordelia admitted,
her brow slightly scrunched.</p>

<p>"I mean that it's more than the fact that you give
me 'the down low tickle'. I like think about you and stuff, you know wonder
what your doing," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"I give you 'the down low tickle'?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, focus on the other part of that statement,"
Buffy told her.</p>

<p>"You mean you've gone past the science fair stage?
The experiment's over, and the results are in?" Cordelia asked, starting
to get where Buffy was going with all of this.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that pretty much sums up what I've trying
been trying to say," Buffy agreed wishing she had gotten it out without
sounding like a jabbering idiot.</p>

<p>"And you want to know how far along in the project
I am? If I've reached any conclusions?" Cordelia asked looking over at
Buffy who just nodded at her and waited for her answer. "I'd say our data
corresponds."</p>

<p>"Really?" Buffy asked smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, really," Cordelia responded returning the Slayers
smile. "So where do we go from here?"</p>

<p>"You duck, and I slay," Buffy said pulling a stake
out of her waistband and moving around Cordelia to intercept a vamp who
had just risen.</p>

<p>Cordelia stepped back and watched as Buffy and the
vampire started to fight. It was only a matter of minutes before Buffy
dusted the thing but during that time Cordelia realized that both of them
being girls wasn't going to be the main obstacle in their relationship.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As far as demons, and vampires, and openings to hell
went the next few weeks passed by relatively uninterestingly. Buffy staked
a total of about four vamps, and amazingly pathetic ones at that. So while
everything on the slaying front was boring there were other areas of her
life that just kept getting better and better. She and Cordelia had spent
at least sometime together everyday and were getting closer and closer.
Seeing the other girl had actually become the highlight of Buffy's days.
The project excuse had only worked for a few more days after the incident
with Faith, and after that they had to start being more inventive with
finding ways to see each other. Ways that usually involved Buffy starting
patrol earlier and finishing later.</p>

<p>Things on the physical front had cooled down slightly.
While they sometimes got a little too involved in what they were doing,
they decided that it would be best if they waited. Not only was this type
of relationship new for both of them, but the emotions they were experiencing&nbsp;
were much more powerful then anything they had felt before, making their
connection new and exhilarating, but also frightening. Not to mention that
the incident with Angel and one with Cordelia's parents had reminded them
that they had to be more careful about when and where they engaged in certain
activities. Buffy hadn't known that it was possible to get dressed in under
sixty seconds until the night Cordelia's parents came home from their vacation
in Palm Springs.</p>

<p>"Do you think that all the fighting we've done over
the years was just the result of unresolved sexual tension?" Cordelia asked
as they snuggled into Buffy's couch. The TV was on, but neither of them
were watching it. Joyce was at the Gallery working on a new Egyptian exhibit
which would keep her out till the wee hours of the morning so they had
the house to themselves.</p>

<p>"There's a thought," Buffy said looking up at Cordelia.
"If that's true then that means that the Homecoming thing was like what...foreplay?"
Buffy asked remembering that something had been crackling in the air that
night.</p>

<p>"Hmm..." Cordelia said sniffing Buffy's hair. "Please
tell me that's not your idea of foreplay. I couldn't afford it. Do you
have any idea how much that dress cost?"</p>

<p>"I seriously doubt that," Buffy told her leaning
into the taller girls touch. "Besides I think you already know what my
idea of foreplay is."</p>

<p>"That I do," Cordelia said, smiling as she planted
a small kiss on Buffy's neck. "This is nice." Cordelia continued a moment
later. "Having someone to talk to, or not talk to, someone to just be with."</p>

<p>"Can't you do that with your friends?" Buffy asked.
She still hadn't been able to really wrap her mind around the relationship
Cordelia had with Harmony and the crew. Sometimes she could swear that
she didn't even like them. "Well not this exactly," Buffy said gesturing
to their intimate position, "but to talk to and stuff?" she finished.</p>

<p>"Those sheep? All they do is follow and bah all day
long. If any one of them ever had an original thought it would cause their
brain to overload. I would hate to be responsible for that," Cordelia responded.</p>

<p>"Why do you hang with them then?" Buffy asked genuinely
interested. She had observed Cordelia in her natural habitat and when she
was there she didn't seem happy. It was more like indifference bordering
on aversion. At least when she had hung out with her and Scooby Gang she
had been able to be herself, something she seemed to be missing now.</p>

<p>"Why did you hang with your crowd in L.A?" Cordelia
asked remembering the references Buffy had made about her life before she
came to Sunnydale.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what real friendship was like until
I came here," Buffy responded truthfully. What she observing with Cordelia
and her group was a lot like what she had been like with hers in L.A. She
didn't even really miss them when she had moved to Sunnydale. At first
she missed the security that came along with belonging to a group, but
she didn't really miss the group. Now she could hardly imagine life without
Willow, Xander, Giles, Oz, and Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what real friends were like until
I started hanging with you guys," Cordelia admitted. It had been a totally
new experience for her to be around them, they actually cared about each
other, protected each other, and when she joined in they cared about and
protected her. It wasn't about who could upstage the other, or who had
the best clothes, it was about being together, having people around that
you wanted around, and she liked it. She never would have come out and
said it, it wouldn't have been in character but she liked being their friend.
"And well, you know how that turned out," she continued.</p>

<p>"So you went back," Buffy stated. It wasn't an accusation,
just a fact. In truth she understood why Cordelia would have gone back,
why she would've have been angry with them.</p>

<p>"I couldn't stay," Cordelia said, remembering the
pain and loneliness she felt that day in the hospital. "At least they never
hurt me, not until I left the fold and even then it didn't compare. It
couldn't," Cordelia continued her voice lowering. Buffy turned around so
that she could look into Cordelia's eyes, see the pain that had been caused.</p>

<p>"I didn't know about what was going on," Buffy said
not breaking their gaze. It was very important to her that Cordelia know
she didn't take part in the deception.</p>

<p>"I know," Cordelia admitted. "You were cast out by
association. It wasn't personal."</p>

<p>"I figured," Buffy said shifting so that her face
was only inches above Cordelia's, before she slowly lowered her head to
bring their lips together in a gentle kiss. "I can't promise that you'll
be hurt by one of us again, but I can promise that it will never be intentional
and that after all is said and done we will be there. I will be there.
That's what friendship, love, and feeling is all about. I care about you,
more than I can say," Buffy told her.</p>

<p>"You'll be there?" Cordelia whispered.</p>

<p>"I'll be there," Buffy responded with absolute certainty.
Cordelia looked at her for a moment then raised her head bringing her lips
to Buffy's once again.</p>

<p>Once the kiss broke Buffy took Cordelia's hand and
lead her up to her bedroom. Cordelia followed her quietly, each girl knowing
exactly what was going to happen, and each anticipating it, wanting it,
craving it. The past few years, the past few weeks, the past few days all
culminating on the small climb to Buffy's room until both felt like they
almost couldn't take it anymore. The need to touch each, to be together,
becoming overwhelming. Buffy reached out with a steady hand opening the
door to her room, closing it once Cordelia was safely inside.</p>

<p>"What about your mother?" Cordelia asked when Buffy
turned to face her.</p>

<p>"She's at the gallery, she won't be home until dawn
and that's even if she bothers to come home at all," Buffy responded, steering
Cordelia towards the bed.</p>

<p>"Good," the brunette responded raising her hand to
Buffy's face before bringing their lips together. There was no fanfare
this time, they both knew what they wanted. Not breaking the kiss, she
gently pushed Cordelia into a sitting position on the mattress and straddled
her thighs. Cordelia moaned and began to move her hands up and down Buffy's
sides only lightly brushing her breasts. As Cordelia's hands made their
way under her shirt Buffy reached for Cordelia starting to unbutton her
shirt. It was becoming extremely important to both of them that they feel
the others skin.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped her administrations to lift her arms
so that Cordelia could lift her shirt over her head. Once she was freed
from the garment she returned to the task of removing Cordelia's shirt.
Once she had all the buttons undone she leaned forward and kissed her as
she slipped the shirt down off of her shoulders. They both moaned as their
breasts touched each others, the delightful friction causing their kiss
to become frenzied. Wanting, needing to feel more, Buffy moved her hands
to Cordelia's back undoing her bra. Leaning back slightly so that she could
see Cordelia's face Buffy pealed the lacy garment off and tossed it to
the side. Leaning forward once again she crushed her lips to Cordelia's
and moved her hands up to caress her breasts. Cordelia groaned into her
mouth and arched into Buffy's hands.</p>

<p>Moving off of Cordelia, Buffy stood up, ignoring
the girl's moan of protest. She decided that she had too much clothing
on and was going to rectify the situation immediately. Trailing her hand
down her stomach Buffy reached into the waistband of her pants and pulled
them down slowly stepping out of them. Looking up she noticed Cordelia's
gaze fastened on her. Reaching around to her back she unhooked her bra
letting it drop to the floor. Cordelia had centered herself on the bed
now and was watching Buffy's every move with avid attention. Reaching down
once again Buffy bent to remove the only article of clothing she still
had on. Slowly she peeled off her panties and stepped out of them moving
back over to the bed.</p>

<p>"Your turn," she said bending over Cordelia to kiss
her softly. "Let me," she said when she felt Cordelia's hands moving to
take off what was left of her clothing. Moving her hands down to Cordelia's
waist Buffy unbuttoned her pants then slid down Cordelia's body until her
head was at her abdomen. Grasping the waist band of the pants and underwear
Buffy tugged them down and off her feet before moving back up to join Cordelia.</p>

<p>Once Buffy was eye level again Cordelia rolled them
over so that she was on top and dipped her head to trail kisses along Buffy's
neck and collar bone, nuzzling slightly. Buffy had the most tantalizing,
soft skin and Cordelia couldn't get enough. Continuing her downward trek
she stopped at Buffy's right breast licking the area around her areola
before taking the erect pink nipple into her mouth and sucking it while
with her left hand she squeezed and pinched her left nipple. Buffy moaned
and turned her head to the side arching into Cordelia's mouth and hand.
Cordelia continued to assault Buffy's breasts alternating between left
and right for a few minutes before continuing on her way down.</p>

<p>"Cordelia..." Buffy started.</p>

<p>"I want to taste you," Cordelia mumbled before dipping
her tongue into Buffy's navel and flicking.</p>

<p>"Uhhh..." Buffy moaned leaning back as Cordelia continued
down. Reaching Buffy's sex Cordelia moaned as the scent wafted up to her.</p>

<p>"You're so wet," Cordelia commented softly as she
nudged Buffy's legs apart. Laying in between the other girls legs Cordelia
learned the answer to a question she had been trying to figure out for
ages. Buffy was a natural blond. Pushing the thought aside, she reached
out a finger coating it in Buffy's nectar then drew it into her mouth and
sucked her finger clean.</p>

<p>"Ummmm..." The brunette moaned before leaning forward
and dipping her tongue into Buffy's honey warmth. Parting her lips with
her fingers Cordelia licked the length of Buffy's sex collecting all of
the ambrosia that she could find.</p>

<p>Buffy's hips jerked at the first touch of Cordelia's
tongue, and gave a full fledged buck when the girl started to lick her.
The sensations were overwhelming, she had lost total control of her motor
skills her body was doing whatever it felt like which seemed to be pushing
forward to meet Cordelia's mouth. The sounds Cordelia was making while
she feasted on her only exciting Buffy more.</p>

<p>"Oh...yes...Cor..." Buffy wailed as the girl slipped
a finger into sopping opening.</p>

<p>As Buffy's hips started moving faster Cordelia added
another finger being careful not to hurt her lover. Continuing her pumping
motion Cordelia moved her lips up to take Buffy's throbbing clit into her
mouth, smiling at the enthusiastic reaction the move got from Buffy.</p>

<p>"Ohhhhhhgodddddddd," Buffy moaned as Cordelia started
to stroke the length of her clit while pumping her fingers faster. She
was so close, she could feel her orgasm building. When Cordelia sucked
her clit into her mouth pulling on it Buffy exploded, pelvis bucking up
into Cordelia face as a kaleidoscope of colors exploded behind her eyes.
As her orgasm continued to flow through her body Cordelia kept up her ministrations
drawing out Buffy's orgasm as long as possible.</p>

<p>When Buffy's body stilled Cordelia kissed her way
up Buffy's body placing a soft kiss on her lips as she waited for her breathing
to return to normal. When Buffy opened her eyes she was greeted to Cordelia's
smiling face.</p>

<p>"You are without a doubt the most amazing creature
I have ever laid eyes on," Cordelia said lifting her head off of Buffy's
shoulder to give her a kiss.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't that be my line," Buffy said smiling.
She could taste herself on Cordelia's lips and found it to be incredibly
erotic, not to mention stimulating.</p>

<p>"I like touching you," Cordelia said trailing her
hand up Buffy's side. "It makes me happy," Cordelia continued unconsciously
moving her sex along Buffy's thigh.</p>

<p>"I bet I know what'd make you happier," Buffy said
trailing her hands down to rest on Cordelia's hips which were now moving
steadily along her thigh. "Do you like that?" Buffy asked watching as Cordelia's
eyes started to close. The girl simply moaned in response, her hips picking
up pace.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia murmured a minute later as she
lowered her lips to Buffy's. She was starting to lose it, her hips moved
faster and faster and she could feel a tightening in her stomach. "Yesss..."
Cordelia drew out as her head dropped to Buffy's shoulder. She was almost
there, just one more, "BUFFY!!!!!" She called out throwing her head back
as orgasm ripped through body. Buffy continued to hold her tightly as her
hips bucked against her and her body shook until finally Cordelia collapsed
against her.</p>

<p>Once Cordelia's breathing returned to normal she
lifted up her head so that she could see Buffy's face. Their eyes meet
and they stared into each others eyes for an eternity before Buffy reached
up and placed a series of small kisses all over Cordelia's face.</p>

<p>"I've never--" Cordelia started to say but Buffy
interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Believe me,&nbsp; I know," Buffy said softly placing
her fingers over Cordelia's lips.</p>

<p>"What about--"</p>

<p>"It wasn't like this," Buffy said knowing that Cordelia
was referring to her and Angel. The two experiences were almost completely
different and not just because of the boy/girl thing. As a vampire Angel's
body temperature was always a few degrees lower than a human's leaving
him cold to the touch at all times. What she had just shared with Cordelia
was warm, and passionate, loving, and alive, and Buffy said so trying to
find someway to express what she was feeling.</p>

<p>Cordelia merely smiled and kissed her on the forehead.
She understand how Buffy could be at a loss for words, she was too. She
was so completely filled with feelings, with emotions but she had no idea
how to express them in words.</p>

<p>"Stay here tonight?" Buffy asked not wanting to let
her go. In fact she didn't think she could.</p>

<p>"Where could I go that would be better than this?"
Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Disney Land?" Buffy offered. That always seemed
to be a suitable suggestion.</p>

<p>"Trust me, the Magic Kingdom's got nothing on you,"
Cordelia answered with a smile.</p>

<p>"Sweet talking will get you everywhere with me Ms.
Chase," Buffy said rubbing her hand up and down Cordelia's arm.</p>

<p>"I know," Cordelia responded before leaning down
and kissing Buffy again. It was going to be a long, enjoyable night.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As Buffy opened her eyes she smiled and thanked the
Lord it was Saturday. And while she was at it she thanked the big guy for
the girl she was curled up against. Happy was an emotion Buffy had been
becoming less and less familiar with since being called but laying there
she was undoubtedly, sickeningly happy and she loved it. Was reveling in
it. When she had had to send Angel to hell the year before she had felt
like her insides had been ripped out, and the despair that had overcome
her seemed absolute. After her very unsuccessful summer vacation/dealing
cop-out, not to mention the miserable attempt to move on with Scott around
Homecoming she had started to think that she would never love again, never
feel passion again. And she didn't realize it until very recently but those
unconscious thoughts had been creeping into reality causing her to distance
herself from others, to run. Her relationship with Cordelia had changed
that however, she loved and was loved in return. With Cordelia she felt
passion, she felt happy, she felt alive.</p>

<p>Tilting her head up she noticed two dark eyes regarding
her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Morning," Cordelia offered giving Buffy a tiny smile.</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy responded continuing to look into Cordelia's
eyes. They had these little specks of gold in them that she loved. She
could probably spend at least an hour just staring into those eyes without
being bored.</p>

<p>"You okay?" Cordelia asked carefully. Buffy had seemed
deep in thought when she woke up and she was praying that the girl wasn't
having second thoughts about what they had shared the night before. She
didn't know what she would do if she was because she had fallen, she had
fallen hard.</p>

<p>"Better than okay," Buffy said with a smile shifting
up to place a soft kiss on Cordelia's lips.</p>

<p>"No regrets?" Cordelia asked once Buffy had settled
again.</p>

<p>"None whatsoever," Buffy told her. "You?"</p>

<p>"What's a regret?" Cordelia asked with a smile, kissing
the top of Buffy's head. She was too happy for words and she knew it showed
on her face. "Do I look and sound as goofy as I think I do?" Cordelia asked
thinking that there was more sap in her than in a maple tree.</p>

<p>"Yes," Buffy responded with a equally goofy grin.
"But don't worry, I think it's cute and that's really all that matters."</p>

<p>"Well good then," Cordelia responded. "How would
you feel if I told you that&agrave;" Her sentence was interrupted by the
ringing of the phone. Buffy looked at Cordelia torn between wanting to
hear the rest of what the girl was going to stay and having to pick up.
When Cordelia nodded in the direction of the phone Buffy relented and picked
it up.</p>

<p>"Hello?" Buffy asked trying not to sound as irritated
with the caller as she was.</p>

<p>"Buffalicious!" Xander greeted on the other end.</p>

<p>"Hey X," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"What are you doing today?" Xander asked. "Nothing?
Great. Cause I've got two irresistible words for you. Point-n-Putt," Xander
responded not waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>"Point-n-Putt?" Buffy asked thinking that that wasn't
two words, more like two and a half, or something like that anyway.</p>

<p>"I know, I know. It sounds to good to be true, but
I assure you it is one hundred percent genuine," Xander said barely able
to control his excitement. "Oz and Willow are aboard, so what do say? Can
we add a Slayer to the list?"</p>

<p>"Xander--" Buffy started but was interrupted.</p>

<p>"Did I mention that CC is invited too," Xander piped
up.</p>

<p>"No, no you didn't," Buffy told him slightly surprised.
They were no longer being hostile to each other, but she still figured
she had a way to go before they were inviting Cordelia places themselves.</p>

<p>"Well she is. So...what's the verdict?" He asked.
He hadn't really discussed this with Will and Oz, but puzzlingly it seemed
that Buffy and Cordelia had meshed/bonded in some way and if they wanted
the Buffster to come along for the ride, it meant CC was coming too. He
didn't pretend to understand it, he just went with the flow, because that's
what cool guys did.</p>

<p>"I'm there, but I'll have to ask her," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"What? She's there?" Xander asked surprised. He realized
they were know what you would classify as friends, but bosom buddies?</p>

<p>"No," Buffy responded quickly. "I meant I'll call
her when we're through and let you know," Buffy continued. "Time? Place?
Do you want fries with that?"</p>

<p>"One O'clock at...are you ready for this...Point-n-put,"
Xander said.</p>

<p>"Very droll," Buffy told him. "I'll call you back
later. Oh, and make sure to keep a leash on the stinging wit, it could
hurt someone," she warned before hanging up the phone.</p>

<p>"I take it that was Xander?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"You take it right," Buffy said shifting so that
she was facing Cordelia. "You up for some mini-put? We've been promised
a slap happy time."</p>

<p>"I can't. I promised mom I would help set up for
my cousins baby shower," Cordelia responded regretfully.</p>

<p>"Alright," Buffy said in response not to happy either.
"Listen, we'll be at the library around eight before heading for the Bronze.
Meet up with us?" Buffy asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Done," Cordelia responded.</p>

<p>"Good," Buffy said with a smile. "Now that we've
got that settled...how about breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Breakfast would be good," Cordelia said as she leaned
down to kiss Buffy.</p>

<p>"I was really thinking more along the lines of pancakes."</p>

<p>"I like my idea better," Cordelia responded, smiling
as Buffy leaned in to kiss her. She really liked winning.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Mini-putt was an interesting experience. Who knew
Xander could be so deadly with such a little stick? They headed to the
library later on as usual, Giles still wanted them to do some more research
on the Graduation Day, he was just spacing it out now. As it was, they
were unlikely to find out anymore than what they already knew, but it was
worth the shot. They were all in pretty good moods as they entered the
school, especially Buffy who was paying less attention to her surroundings
than usual. As a result she missed the dark figure who hid in the bushes
and followed them to the school.</p>

<p>Cordelia barely managed to sneak out of the baby
shower alive, as she had slipped out the garage door she could hear her
family start to talk about Martha Stewart and her tips for plant care.
She had shook her head and said another thank you for she knew without
a doubt that participating in that conversation surely would have killed
her. She still didn't understand how it was possible for a room full of
grown people to get so excited over plants. They were going on and on about
how they would get up early and lightly spray the plants leaves in the
morning, and how the moisture sticks were the greatest thing since unsliced
bread was re-invented. She actually wished she had gone out with the Scooby
gang. That was mostly due to the Buffy-factor of course, but what they
were doing had to have been better than what she was. Putting her car into
park she picked up her bag and headed towards the doors of the school to
meet the gang.</p>

<p>"Cordelia..." A voice sing- songed. Turning around
Cordelia saw Faith slowly walk out from the shadows to her side.</p>

<p>"Faith," she said carefully.</p>

<p>"Little late for you to be at school isn't it?" Faith
said continuing her walk towards Cordelia. "And on a Saturday no less.
That's what I call dedication."</p>

<p>"I guess. I'm just looking for--"</p>

<p>"Buffy," Faith said flatly. "I know," she continued
now circling the other brunette. "Everybody's always looking for Buffy.
Popular girl isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Well it depends whose gauge you're using I guess,"
Cordelia responded, starting to wig. Something was definitely up.</p>

<p>"Buffy gets the mom, Buffy gets the Super Friends,
Buffy gets the boy, and now..now Buffy gets the girl," Faith said standing
in front of Cordelia. "Sounds pretty popular to me," she continued. "Popular,
popular, popular. We are definitely going to have to do something about
that. So who to start with, hmm? Well, I kinda like Mrs. S, she's the only
one around here who treated me kinda decently, the Super Friends are much
more trouble than they're worth, and Angel...well I tried that already
and it didn't work so hot. Which leaves?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"The girl?" Cordelia guessed.</p>

<p>"That's right," Faith said smiling slightly. "Do
you know who the girl is?"</p>

<p>"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess...me,"
Cordelia said, really not liking where this was going at all.</p>

<p>"You're on a roll tonight Cordy," Faith said.</p>

<p>"Why me?" Cordelia asked. Except for that one night
there was no reason for Faith to think that she was friends with Buffy
and gang again.</p>

<p>"Why? Because your Buffy's new play thing," Faith
responded savoring the surprised look on Cordelia's face. "Surprised I
know huh? I'm not as dense as the Super Friends, I've had people watching
Buffy, which to my surprise meant they were also watching you. Who would
have thought it? Wonder Woman and The Super Bitch." Faith moved closer,
seriously invading Cordelia's personal space as she continued, "She likes
you, you know? If I had to hazard a guess I would even say love. Ya see
when my peeps told me about you two, I just had to go take a look for myself,
and I'll be damned if it wasn't true, goo goo eyes and all," Faith said
making a face. "Well I'm telling you I couldn't be happier about this revelation,
if Buffy hadn't fallen for you I might not have gotten the chance to pay
her back, but know I'm going to use you to play her just like she played
me," Faith finished reaching for Cordelia. "Goodnight Cordelia," she said
before putting the rag over Cordelia's face.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy glanced at the door again then looked at the
clock. It was past eight thirty, Cordelia should've been there. Currently
it was just her, Willow, and Xander in the library, Oz had to take off
earlier for a gig at the Bronze.</p>

<p>"What's with the looks, Buff?" Willow asked noting
how her friend kept checking the clock and looking at the door.</p>

<p>"Nothing, just restless I guess," Buffy responded.
It was somewhat true.</p>

<p>"I..." Willow started to say but stopped when Buffy
stood up.</p>

<p>"What's that?" The Slayer asked to no one in particular.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked looking around not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>"On the floor by the door. It's a piece of paper
or something," Buffy said, walking over. "It wasn't there before." Willow
got up and followed her.</p>

<p>"What's going on? Is it fun stuff?" Xander queried,
coming down from the second level.</p>

<p>"Buffy thinks she's found something," Willow told
him. By the time Xander got down there Buffy had picked up the object,
an envelope, and was starting to open it.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy said quietly after having read it over
a couple of times. "Dammit!" she swore crushing the piece of paper.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Willow asked, surprised by Buffy's
reaction to whatever was in it.</p>

<p>"A ransom note," Buffy said darkly. She was starting
to pace.</p>

<p>"Ransom? Who?" Xander asked looking around the room
taking stock. All he had was Juicy Fruit and if they wanted that they could
have it.</p>

<p>"Cordelia," Buffy said not bothering to look at him.
"Faith has her," she added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Why Cordelia?" Willow asked, surprised by Faith's
choice in victims.</p>

<p>"Because she knows that I'll come after her," Buffy
responded. "When are Giles and Wesley due back?"</p>

<p>"Anytime now," Willow responded. The two Watchers
had gone to Sunnyvale the neighboring city to pick up a shipment of books
earlier that day and were suppose to meet them at the library.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded and headed over to the table to sit
down. She needed to think. She couldn't believe this was happening. What
was there some unwritten law in the Slayer's hand book that said 'thou
shalt not be happy ever, but if thou doest manage to procure happiness
it shall be taken from thee forthwith'? They were just getting started,
she could still feel Cordelia's arms wrapped her, hear her voice whispering
in her ear after they finished making love, could see her face as clearly
as if she was standing in front of her. She wasn't going to lose that,
she wasn't going to lose Cordelia, she couldn't, it was as simple as that.
She loved her and she was not going to let her go. And she did love her,
Buffy realized, she really did.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow said softly, approaching her friend
carefully. It had been over ten minutes since Buffy had gotten the letter
and&nbsp; she hadn't said anything since asking when Giles was due back.
"Buffy," she said again when there was no answer. Buffy heard her this
time and looked over at her with unfocused eyes. What Willow saw in those
eyes startled her, there was anguish in them, real and true. The only time
she had ever seen a look close to this on Buffy was when she told them
how she had sent Angel to hell. Willow could understand that but this,
this was just Cordelia. She knew Buffy would be upset, and try her hardest
to find the brunette, but agony? Over Cordelia? "Buffy, what's going on?"</p>

<p>"We have to find her," Buffy said, her mind still
a million miles away.</p>

<p>"I know that. We will find her, but what's going
on?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Buffy asked focusing on Willow
for the first time since she sat down.</p>

<p>"You can't see you but I can. You're a mess," Willow
said concerned. "I know you're worried... but it's only Cordelia."</p>

<p>Buffy laughed sadly. "Yeah. It's only Cordelia,"
,he said shaking her head. "That's the point Will."</p>

<p>"Explain. I don't understand," Willow pleaded softly.
She knew Buffy had gotten closer to Cordelia over the past weeks but she
had also seen her remain cooler in much tougher situations.</p>

<p>"I can't," Buffy said not even knowing how to began
telling her friend what she was feeling. First of all how did one let it
slip out nonchalantly that one was in love with a girl ones best friend
had referred to as 'mean, evil and skanky'? In fact how does one tell ones
best friend that she is in love with another girl, let alone explain that
one invested so much hope, love, and possibility into said relationship
that one didn't think it was possible to go on if something happened? It
was only Cordelia, that was the whole point.</p>

<p>"Yes you can," Willow said. "Haven't you learned
anything over the past year. Secrets don't do anyone any good, all they
end up doing is hurting. You say you're so alone, that nobody understands
but how can we understand when you won't tell us what's going on? How can
we be there if you push us away? I don't know what's going on Buffy but
I can almost certainly guarantee you that telling will make it better,
and that we'll be here to work through it together," Willow said. Whether
her attempt to get Buffy to open up would work she didn't know but at least
she had given it a shot. She wanted to help, but she could only do that
if her friend wanted it, accepted what she was offering. "You really care
about her, don't you?" Willow asked after a moment of observing Buffy.
The other girl hadn't answered her question and Willow had noticed that
far away look in her eyes return.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought it, huh?" Buffy asked. "But
yeah."</p>

<p>"She'll be okay," Willow told Buffy. She wouldn't
pretend to understand the bond Buffy and Cordelia had seemed to form over
the past few weeks, but it was apparent to her that her friend was in distress
and she would do whatever she could to ease that.</p>

<p>"What if she isn't?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"She will be. You'll save her," Willow said confidently.
"You always do."</p>

<p>"What if I can't this time?" Buffy wondered out loud.</p>

<p>"I will not allow for that kind of negative thinking,"
Willow stated. "You obviously want her back, so if you want it bad enough,
and you go after it you'll get it. Do or do not Buffy, there is no try,"
Willow continued.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at her and smirked. "Thanks Yoda."</p>

<p>"The Force is with you," Willow said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Luke, I am your father," Buffy said in her best
James Earl Jones impression, smiling for the first time since seeing the
letter. "Now that we've gotten the heart to heart out of the way, we have
to find her," she said, getting serious again.</p>

<p>"Giles and Wesley will be back soon," Willow offered.</p>

<p>"Maybe not soon enough. Faith is not stable, who
knows what she could be doing to her. She talked about cutting into me
with just a bit to much verve. She had to know Cordelia is back in or she
wouldn't have bothered with her, which means she'll do things to her specifically
to hurt me," Buffy said realizing with a chill that it was true. "I can't
let that happen."</p>

<p>Xander who had wondered back over to the girls seeing
a discussion taking place, was about to respond when the doors to the library
opened and Angel walked in hurriedly. Three sets of eyes turned to him
as he stopped, then started to pace in front of Buffy.</p>

<p>"Buffy...I don't know how...something's happened...it's
Faith, she's...she's got Cordelia," Angel said in his usual breathless
whisper.</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy said tossing him the envelope. "Do
you know where they have her?" She asked after he finished reading it.</p>

<p>"The docks in the abandoned cannery," Angel responded.
"I'll take you there."</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at him with grateful eyes. She had
gone to talk to him a few days after he had seen them at Cordelia's to
explain what was going on. She had actually just rambled on and on in jumbled
incoherent non-sentences for a while before he stopped her and told her
that it was okay. After that she had managed to pull it together and he
had listened to her, and supported her even though she knew he still loved
her. Things had irrevocably changed between them after he came back from
hell, and while it was though, and the transition was no where close to
easy, they became just friends. For Angel while painful the truth of this
was somewhat easier for him to bare for his tortured soul would not allow
him to love another, but he knew that Buffy could and had to move on. She
had done so with Cordelia and it made him happy to know that Buffy would
love and again and be loved in return. The happiness was shadowed by his
own deep feeling of loss so it didn't endanger his soul but he was happy
nonetheless and would do everything in his power to make sure that the
two of them had everything he and Buffy could not. Cordelia couldn't have
known it but in him she had found herself a guardian, well, Angel.</p>

<p>"Let's go then," Buffy said heading for the utility
cage to stock up. Buffy had not desired a confrontation between herself
and Faith, had wanted to believe that there was still some good, something
of the friend she had once had in the girl, but Faith had gone to far too
many times. She wasn't going to allow the other Slayer to hurt anymore
of her loved ones. She owed them that much.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Cordelia had regained consciousness about a half
hour before, and Faith decided to have some fun with girl. Her mother had
always told her not to play with her food, but then again Cordelia wasn't
really HER food, she was just the entertainment until Buffy arrived, and
of course the scrap she would throw to her dogs. But then again her mother
was a drunken whore who cared more about her bottle of Jack Daniel's than
her own daughter so Faith didn't put much, well, faith in her mother's
words of wisdom.</p>

<p>"So, tell me Cordelia," Faith drawled from across
the dimly lit room, "is Buffy a good lay? The girls got so much pent-up
energy I bet that when she gets a chance it uncork she's wild ride."</p>

<p>"Spent a lot of time thinking about uncorking Buffy,
Faith?" Cordelia asked. She was way beyond hating this girl. She was never
going to get the rust stains, from the chains Faith used to tie her up,
out of her shirt.</p>

<p>"Enough. You know what I say about slaying, makes
you hungry or horny. Patrolling with Buffy usually led to the latter. Never
got the chance to find out though, cause she's so much better than me.
A murdering demon's fine, but me? No we can't have that. Royalty mixing
with the peasant stock, completely unacceptable," Faith said in a caustic
tone. It was just one more reason to take joy from torturing Cordelia,
she had breached territory that was off limits to her even though she had
wanted it, maybe even deserved it by rights of slayage. Buffy could shag
a demon and a brainless debutante but not her. That just pissed her off.</p>

<p>"You know what Faith, this 'woe is me' Oliver Twist,
'nobody loves' me routine has really been overdone. Maybe if you stopped
killing and kidnapping people you would be more popular."</p>

<p>"What the hell do you know? You've had everything
handed to you on silver-platter. The hardest thing you probably ever do
is pick out which Gucci dress to wear. You're like that Veronica chick
from the Archie comics, 'buy me this daddy, buy me that!'. I hated that
chick! To hell with you!" Faith snarled. "To hell with all of you."</p>

<p>"That attitude'll win you some friends. You've got
a real Marsha Brady complex you know? It's all about you, you, you. You
piss and moan about how nobody loves you, but when someone genuinely reaches
out a hand you bite it like a rabid dog. You messed up with the Scooby
Gang, you were in and you messed it up. Grow up, accept it, move on. Buffy
never did anything to you but try to be your friend," Cordelia finished.
Faith stared at her unable to deny the facts yet unwilling to admit them.</p>

<p>The truth was she had wanted Buffy's help after the
whole deal with Allan, she just couldn't open up. Then she had gone to
the mayor to try and get information on him and win Buffy back over, but
something unexpected happened. The mayor treated her like a princess. She
had been expecting him to treat her like dirt like everyone else did, but
he didn't. He told her that she did a good job, that she was pretty, that
she was talented, and he bought her things and talked to her. It was almost
like having a real father. She didn't even realize it, but he took her
initial envy of Buffy and subtly turned it into something more, turned
it into hate. She could remember when they all used to hang and have fun,
but she also remembered how they played her and she was angry, so angry
and full of hate at them and at the world that she couldn't think, couldn't
see, and someone had to pay for it.</p>

<p>"You do realize you've been kidnapped don't you?
You should be nice to me or things could get very nasty for you," Faith
responded finally.</p>

<p>"Is this the only way you can make new friends?"
Cordelia asked, knowing that no matter how she behaved it wasn't going
to change her fate. She could stall it though which is what she was aiming
for. Faith got up and walk across the room quickly striking Cordelia with
the back of her hand.</p>

<p>"You're really gonna want to shut up now," Faith
advised. She had tired of this game.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Can dish it out but can't take
it?" Cordelia taunted, despite the pain her face was in.</p>

<p>"I know what you're trying to do," Faith stated,
backing away from her. They all thought that they were so smart, that they
could play her like a fucking fiddle, but she wasn't falling for that.
She was smarter than they gave her credit for. "You're trying to make me
angry so that I'll goof and maybe kill you. Save you from all the pain
that is guaranteed to come your way. Well it's not going to work."</p>

<p>"You actually think your going to get away with this
don't you?" Cordelia asked incredulously. "Buffy's going to--"</p>

<p>"Buffy's not here! And by the time she gets here
you'll be dead," Faith responded cockily. She was certain that it would
take the other Slayer at least a day to locate her, maybe more. That was
possibly the only good thing about Sunnydale, there were plenty of places
to hide.</p>

<p>"Guess again," Buffy responded from the doorway of
the cannery. "I would really think about keeping the day job Faith, fortune
telling isn't your thing."</p>

<p>"B," Faith greeted with a smile simply oozing hostility,
"glad you could make it. If I'd known you were coming I would have tided
the place up a little."</p>

<p>"Let her go Faith. This is between me and you," Buffy
said hoping to appeal to the girls sense of honor.</p>

<p>"Nah, I think I'll hold on to her," Faith said. "She's
kinda cute."</p>

<p>"I was wrong that night in the mansion Faith," Buffy
said staring at the other Slayer, her former friend.</p>

<p>"Really?" The dark haired Slayer asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. You're not a loser," Buffy said. "There's
no word low enough for what you are." Faith glared at Buffy for a second
before leaning down slightly and hitting Cordelia hard across the face.</p>

<p>"Keep it up B, let's see how much your girl can take,"
Faith said delighting in the look on Buffy's face as she struck Cordelia.</p>

<p>"You're a coward Faith. Chicken would be ashamed
to share a name with you," Buffy responded. "You know you can't beat me,
I've kicked your ass enough for you to realize that, so you go after my
friends, my family. You're a coward Faith, a crowd who knows that when
put to the test she'll fail so she doesn't even try. Tell me, what's it
like to have no backbone and know it? I'm thinking it would suck," Buffy
said watching the other Slayer closely. She was getting mad, that was good,
when Faith was mad she was sloppy.</p>

<p>Faith regarded Buffy for a long moment, she could
feel the anger building inside of her like a tidal wave. Faith stomped
on the floor broads.</p>

<p>"It's time boys!" She yelled. "I'll show you who's
the coward," she directed towards Buffy then charged her. As Buffy ducked
to avoid a boot flying at her face ten vamps busted into the room from
a door off to the side. Straightening Buffy formed an X with her arms blocking
a punch aimed</p>

<p>for her and head butted Faith sending the girl stumbling
a bit. By that time the gang had entered the building and were engaging
the vamps while Xander moved over to free Cordelia from her bonds. "Bitch,"
Faith growled before lunging at Buffy again.</p>

<p>The fight raged on for minutes, Buffy striking Faith,
and Faith striking back. Nothing Buffy threw at her seemed to faze her
for long. It was like she couldn't feel the pain. All she was feeling was
the hate, the anger, and it was driving her on, giving her strength. They
had slowly shuffled their way towards a corner while the gang tried their
best to hold off the vamps. Thanks to Angel they were actually on top letting
Buffy concentrate fully on Faith.</p>

<p>Buffy kicked her in the gut, then spun around, driving
her elbow into the small of Faith's back. Faith, ignoring the pain in her
back, responded by using her downwards momentum to drop into spin kick
causing Buffy to jump up giving her the opportunity to ram the smaller
girl into the wall.</p>

<p>"How do you like that?" Faith asked, shoving Buffy
against the wall. Buffy responded by kicking her in pelvic area causing
Faith to release her and kicked the girls knee.</p>

<p>"I like that better," Buffy said. Faith backed up
holding her leg like a wounded animal, watching Buffy.</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right B," she started a sick smile
making it's way across her face. "Maybe I can't beat you in a fair fight.
But then again lucky for me that I rarely fight fair. I might not be able
to beat you but I can kill you, and all your little friends," she said
reaching into her pocket and removing a small box. "Plan C. We all go to
hell together," Faith said. Buffy stared at the box for a second knowing
exactly what Faith planned on doing.</p>

<p>"Move out!" She yelled. "Everybody get the hell out
of here!!!" Backing away from Faith she spotted Cordelia trapped in the
corner with a vamp and made a b-line for her. Faith smiled and flipped
the switch.</p>

<p>"Five seconds B," she cooed. "I'm going to enjoy
torturing you for eternity," She continued but Buffy wasn't paying attention.
After throwing the vamp to the ground she grabbed Cordelia by the arm and
looked around quickly. The door was too far away for them to make it, but
she spotted a grotto about ten meters away. It would provide protection
from the blast and best of all it was close. Dragging Cordelia with her
she shoved the girl into the grotto then covered her turning her back to
the blast. Less then a second after they reached their destination there
was a rumbling and everything started tumbling down.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes when everything was quite again.
The first thing she noted was a pain in her back most likely from scraps
hitting her, but it was good pain. It was pain that meant she was alive.
Everything was dark, but her eyes soon adjusted and she could see that
they were trapped. The opening to the alcove was now covered with layers
of rock, metal and who knew what else. A small whimper diverted her from
her inspection of her surrounding however. She was still wrapped around
Cordelia, with the other girls head resting on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Cordelia asked, coughing a little.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm here," Buffy said softly leaning her head
to rest against Cordelia's.</p>

<p>"Are we dead?"</p>

<p>"No death is much brighter than this," Buffy responded.
Cordelia didn't respond right away, opting instead to bury her face in
Buffy's shoulder. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault," Buffy whispered
as she rocked Cordelia gently.</p>

<p>"It's okay," Cordelia said softly.</p>

<p>"No it's not. You were nearly tortured and killed
because of me," Buffy objected, Faith hitting Cordelia playing through
her head.</p>

<p>"I know, Buffy. I know what it's like to be in your
life, the danger, and I chose to be here. Sure, I could do without the
kidnapping, who couldn't, but that doesn't make what happened your fault.
I can deal Buffy," Cordelia said softly. "The only question now is can
you?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"I can," Buffy responded bending her head down to
brush her lips against Cordelia's. Once they broke apart Cordelia moaned
softly and rested her head on Buffy's shoulder. "What's wrong?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"My head hurts," Cordelia murmured in response. Buffy
reached her hand out to touch the back of Cordelia's head and gasped. "That's
not making me feel better," Cordelia said.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, you'll be okay," Buffy said trying
to keep her voice calm as she removed her hand and wiped it on her pants.
When she had reached back her hand had been covered in blood. There was
a major cut back there, maybe even a concussion. "I need you to try and
stay awake though, okay Cordy?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Cordelia mumbled sleepily.</p>

<p>"Cordy? Come on, I need you stay awake," Buffy said
moving her hand to cup Cordelia's face.</p>

<p>"I'm tired Buffy," Cordelia said desperately trying
to stay awake.</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy said softly. She was starting to
get very worried. There was a limited supply of oxygen in the grotto, and
she didn't have much room to move around which would make digging their
way out very difficult. She also wasn't sure how much longer Cordelia was
going to be able to last. "Just concentrate on the sound of my voice okay?
I promise you everything will be okay, you just concentrate on the sound
of my voice," Buffy said wishing she believed her own words.</p>

<p>Willow stared at the wreckage that was once the cannery
in shock. There were parts of the building still intact but the general
sight was one of total destruction. She, Xander and Angel had barely managed
to make it out before everything went down. Angel had tried to go in after
Buffy, but she and Xander had grabbed him, dragging him out. Dust filled
the air around them, and other than the occasional creak of something falling
there was total silence. From what they could see they were the only ones
who had made it out.</p>

<p>"Come on." It was Angel who broke the silence. Willow
turned around to see him heading for the wreckage.</p>

<p>"Where?" Willow asked. She was hardly able to think.
There was no where to go, Buffy was gone, Faith was gone, Cordelia was
gone. There was no where to go.</p>

<p>"They headed to towards an arbor before the blast,
I saw them. The area around there is still intact," He said.</p>

<p>"They're alive?" Xander asked, snapping out of it.</p>

<p>"Probably, but they won't be for long if we don't
get them out. There can't be much oxygen in there." Angel started removing
rocks from where he assumed the opening to the arbor would be.</p>

<p>"Well then, what are we waiting for?" Willow asked
moving over to join him.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy leaned her head against the wall and sighed
wearily. The gang had dug them out just over three hours ago and they had
been rushed straight to the hospital after that. The explosion had gotten
attention and by the time they were dug out there was quite a crowd gathered
around. Buffy didn't mind, though in fact she was glad for the ambulance
which had been standing by. Not for herself, but for Cordelia, she had
lost consciousness half an hour before they were dug out which wasn't a
good thing. Now three hours later Buffy sat in the chair by Cordelia's
bedside waiting for her to wake up. The doctors had said that she would
fine but she was still out cold.</p>

<p>The gang had wanted to hang around after Cordelia's
initial diagnosis, but Buffy had sent them home. They had been working
all night and they needed their rest. Not to mention visiting hours were
over so they would've just been sitting in the hallway doing nothing. Giles
and Wesley had shown up shortly after they arrived at the hospital having
heard about the explosion on the radio and knowing that anything blowing
up in Sunnydale had to do with Buffy, but she had sent them home as well.
Fortunately for Buffy the doctors wanted her to stay over night to see
if there was any internal damage they had missed which meant that she got
to stay with Cordelia.</p>

<p>Cordelia's parents had left about ten minutes ago
and Joyce was due to come back with some things for Buffy any minute. Buffy
had actually been very happy her mother was there when Cordelia's parents
came in asking about what had happened. Understandably they had found it
strange that their daughter had been in a cannery by the docks that just
happened to explode with none other than Sunnydale's premiere female hooligan
around. Up until then Buffy had had no idea her mother was such a proficient
liar, not to mention a creative one. Anyway needless to say that when the
door to their room opened Buffy knew who it was without having to look.</p>

<p>"Hey," she called softly to her mother.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself," Joyce responded making her way over
to Buffy. "How are you feeling?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine mom, we Slayers don't bruise easily," Buffy
responded lifting her head away from the wall to look at her mother.</p>

<p>"How's Cordelia?" Joyce asked, looking at the still
unconscious girl on the bed. She had noticed that Cordelia and Buffy had
been spending a lot of time together over the past few weeks, and she could
see that her daughter was worried about the other girl.</p>

<p>"The same," Buffy responded. She was having trouble
concentrating.</p>

<p>"What really happened?" Joyce asked a moment later
pulling a chair over to rest beside Buffy's. Buffy sighed, she had not
told her mother about Faith switching sides, she had hoped to clear everything
up and didn't want to concern her mom who had taken a liking to Faith,
but it was apparent now that whatever was wrong between them was going
to stay that way for quite sometime. Faith wasn't ready to be helped, and
Buffy wasn't ready to offer it, at least not anytime soon. Faith obviously
felt betrayed by her, but she too was feeling betrayed by Faith, and as
long as those feeling existed there wasn't likely to be resolution between
the two anytime soon.</p>

<p>"A couple of weeks ago..." Buffy began.</p>

<p>Her mother had left a few minutes before and Buffy
was even more exhausted than before. Joyce had found it hard to believe
that Faith had turned on them and Buffy had had to go into a bit more detail
than she had planned on. When she was finished Joyce had simply told her
not to make any rash decision when dealing with Faith siting that she was
just afraid and hurting. Buffy understood that and agreed with her mother
said but she knew that if Faith went after anyone she cared about again
she was going to do what she had to do.</p>

<p>"Bu...Buffy?" Cordelia whispered, her voice cracking.
Buffy quickly moved to the side of her bed, taking her hand in hers.</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Are we dead?"</p>

<p>"Still a no," Buffy assured her. "We're in the hospital."</p>

<p>"Hospital," Cordelia repeated. "Do I still have a
head? Cause I don't feel like I have a head?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Head's still there, beautiful as ever," Buffy told
her. "Here," Buffy said handing her two pill and cup of water. The nurse
had told her to give them to Cordelia when she woke up to help with the
pain. "You should get some sleep," Buffy said once Cordelia had taken the
pills.</p>

<p>"Didn't I just wake up?" Cordelia asked her eyes
already starting to close. Buffy smiled and released her hand once she
was sure Cordelia was asleep and made her way over to her bed. All the
days events came rushing back to her and she literally collapsed into bed
and then into a dreamless sleep.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"How are you feeling?" Buffy asked, back in the chair
by Cordelia's bedside.</p>

<p>"Have you ever had one of those headaches that was
so bad you wish you were dead? Well, I wish I had one of those right now,"
Cordelia moaned. She didn't really know what it felt like to have an elephant
tap dance on your head, but she imaged it would feel something like what
she was feeling now.</p>

<p>"That well, huh?" Buffy asked. She was glad Cordelia
was awake and was almost bouncing in her seat.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you? Why are you so chipper? Woman
in pain over here," Cordelia responded testily, rubbing at her stitches.
Stupid Slayer healing powers.</p>

<p>"The doctor said not to rub at those," Buffy said,
batting her hand away. "And I'm not chipper, I'm medicated. There's a difference,
mine is a legal defense."</p>

<p>"Either way I'll take a double dose of whatever you're
on," Cordelia said.</p>

<p>"You should be feeling something, the nurse has been
pumping stuff into your IV like it was a slot machine," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling pain. Does that count?" Cordelia asked
turning her head to the side and looking absolutely pitiful.</p>

<p>"Poor baby," Buffy said, moving over to the side
of the bed and cradling Cordelia's head on her shoulder. "Momma knows child,
momma knows," she cooed.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" Cordelia protested squirming slightly
but smiling nonetheless.</p>

<p>"You want Auntie Buffy to kiss the booboo better?"
Buffy asked once Cordelia stopped squirming.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Cordelia said nodding her head. Buffy smiled
and leaned down, placing a kiss on Cordelia's forehead.</p>

<p>"Is that better?" Buffy asked pulling back so that
she could see Cordelia's face.</p>

<p>"That wasn't what I had in mind," Cordelia said looking
up a Buffy through her eye lashes.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you weren't feeling well," Buffy
said eyeing her suspiciously. "This whole 'ouch my head' thing isn't just
an elaborate ploy to get me into bed is it?"</p>

<p>"Since when would I have to come up with a plan to
do that?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Good point," Buffy relented. "Are you sure you're
up to it? I wouldn't want to hurt you," Buffy said teasingly.</p>

<p>"I asked for a kiss not wild jungle sex," Cordelia
said looking at her. "Besides, I can't feel any worse than I do right now,
so what have I got to lose."</p>

<p>"Excellent point," Buffy said approvingly. As she
was about to lean forward and kiss Cordelia, for real this time, she was
interrupted by a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>"Knock, knock!" Xander called. "The Party Crew has
arrived. It has always been a firm belief of mine that if you can't go
to the party, the party shall come to you. This is the first time it has
actually come true&agrave;but let's not dwell on that now," he continued
sweeping into the room followed by Willow, Oz, and Giles.</p>

<p>Once they were all settled Buffy and Cordelia informed
Giles of their perspectives of the previous nights activities.</p>

<p>"Well," Giles begun once they were finished, "I checked
with the police this morning and they didn't find any body's in the wreckage.
Which means that I think it would be a good idea for us to assume that
Faith made it out of the building before it came down," Giles said wiping
at his glasses.</p>

<p>"She did," Buffy said quietly. "Make it out of building."</p>

<p>"How can you be sure?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I can feel her," Buffy responded. She could sense
the other girl still out there. She didn't know exactly how to describe
the feeling or even if it was possible to, but she knew Faith was out there.
"I guess it's just a Slayer thing," She added absently.</p>

<p>"Well at the risk of being unpopular I've got to
say, NUTS TO THAT!" Xander declared, not at all concerned with being popular
at the moment.</p>

<p>"As much as it pains me to say this, I'm with Xander
on this one. Besides being a walking advertisement for birth control, the
girls got some serious issues all revolving around you," Cordelia said
directing the last part of her statement to Buffy. Buffy already had demons,
monsters, and the fate of the world on her shoulders, she didn't need a
psycho Slayer gunning to kill her as well. Her displeasure with the situation
was compounded by the fact that she didn't want another obstacle out there
for Buffy to overcome. She had become used to having the Slayer in her
life, liked having the Slayer in her life, and wanted her to remain in
her life as long as possible, and 'as long as possible' was diminished
each time some baddie decided they wanted a piece of the Buffy pie.</p>

<p>"Believe me I know," Buffy responded in response
to the last part of Cordelia's statement.</p>

<p>"I don't think we should party so hard. Someone might
rupture something," Oz deadpanned after a moment breaking the depressing
silence which had settled over the room.</p>

<p>"He's right, I thought we were suppose to be getting
with the happies, not discovering the different and plentiful categories
of dismal," Buffy responded. There was really no sense in them worrying
about Faith and getting all depressed, what would be would be. Worrying
about wasn't going to do any good.</p>

<p>"Well then," Xander piped up, "who's up for scrabble?"</p>

<p>"Scrabble?" Cordelia asked her headache starting
to come back.</p>

<p>"Did I mention I was thinking 'strip scrabble'?"
Xander asked innocently. Cordelia moaned, her headache was back with a
vengeance.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>It was a cold night by Sunnydale standards, a long
sleeves and pants sort of night. It was cooler at the beach than in town,
causing Buffy and Cordelia to snuggle under a blanket for warmth. Buffy
had been released from the hospital three days earlier, and Cordelia the
day after that. Between the police questioning them about the explosion,
and Cordelia's parents going a quality time kick it had been difficult
for the two of them to spent time together. Finally, they had managed to
get out of their respective homes and spend some time together.</p>

<p>"All I'm saying is, what good is a monkey with no
tail? I mean it's basically just a baboon and nobody likes baboons. It
wouldn't even be able to swing from trees anymore, it'd just be this pathetic
ass monkey wannabe," Buffy said looking at the stars. It was really a beautiful
night out, she was glad they had come out.</p>

<p>"All monkeys have tails so it's a pointless discussion.
Besides some people like baboons," Cordelia responded.</p>

<p>"Nobody likes baboons. That's why we have the saying
'you stupid baboon!'. Besides just think about what would happen if something
did happen to the monkeys tail. I'm thinking it'd be looking at some pretty
hard times," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Why are we talking about monkeys?" Cordelia asked,
suddenly realizing the idiocy of their conversation. They were talking
about the imaginary life of a monkey who hypothetically lost it's tail
in some unrevealed incident.</p>

<p>"You started it."</p>

<p>"No I didn't," Cordelia said. She was certain she
would have remembered bringing up monkeys. They weren't exactly a common
subject of conversation with her.</p>

<p>"Yes you did. You said something about Principal
Snyder, which of course got me thinking about ass monkeys, hence the conver,"
Buffy explained. Cordelia thought about that for a moment before shrugging.
She didn't even want to chance getting back on the subject of monkeys.</p>

<p>"Is your mother freaking as much as my parents are
about the whole 'being trapped in a building that had just blown up' thing?"
Cordelia asked. Her parents had never been coddlers for which she was eternally
grateful, but now they were coddling. Eighteen was not the time to start
coddling one's child. It led to serious wiggins on the child part.</p>

<p>"No, she's not so much freaking about this. When
she found out about the</p>

<p>Slayer thing there was major freakage, but this,
this is more 'I want quality time with my child before she dies a horrible
death' kind of thing. She's just trying to get it all in," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ever afraid?" Cordelia asked, turning
to look at Buffy.</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?" Buffy asked, looking at her.</p>

<p>"Dying," Cordelia answered.</p>

<p>"Not really, I mean I've been there before. I'm not
exactly in a rush to go back you know, but I'm not afraid," Buffy answered
after a moment. "I can't be, the job doesn't allow for it."</p>

<p>"Job or not it's scary," Cordelia said.</p>

<p>"That's true, but if you think about it too much,
if let the fear and the doubt in you'll die. I've come to the conclusion
that slaying is just as much about attitude as it is about--"</p>

<p>"Being a Superchick," Cordelia volunteered.</p>

<p>"Yes, although I wouldn't have put it that way,"
Buffy responded. "It's kind of finding the right balance I guess. I mean
I'm practically an old lady in Slayer years. Kendra didn't have enough
attitude, and Faith has too much, I'm pretty much in the middle most of
the time but when I sway too much to one side that's when hospitals usually
become involved," Buffy continued.</p>

<p>"So you've never been afraid?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Sure I've been afraid, I just can't let it become
the usual. I was afraid when I got that letter from Faith saying she had
taken you. I was afraid when I saw her hit you, I was afraid when I saw
her flip the switch. I'm actually afraid a lot, I don't think that's a
bad thing though unless you let the fear rule you," Buffy answered. She
tried not to think about these things too much but she knew that she had
to talk about them with Cordelia, it was the least she could do if they
were going to continue being together. And she wanted to stay together
very much.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could do it," Cordelia commented
a moment later, looking up at the stars once again.</p>

<p>"I think you could," Buffy told her. "Remember Homecoming?
I think you handled yourself pretty well. I mean you saved my life which
was a nice change of pace. In fact I think you're a lot braver than you're
giving yourself credit for. I think a lot of people are a lot braver than
they give themselves credit for. You, don't have to be out here, battling
vampires, getting sucked into hell and stuff."</p>

<p>"I do what I do when I do it because I don't want
to die. Not dying is really the motivating force behind my actions. That's
not bravery, it's&agrave;it's self preservation. It's all very Darwinian,"
Cordelia responded.</p>

<p>"What do you think I'm doing out there? Not dying
is a very good idea," Buffy responded. "The thing is if you weren't out
there you wouldn't have to worry about dying, so it's the being out there
part that's brave."</p>

<p>"Were you always like this badass chick?" Cordelia
asked not being able to picture Buffy any other way.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy said, laughing, "I used to be a lot like..."</p>

<p>"Me?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Once again not how I would've put it, but something
like that. When I was first called I didn't even want to train because
it made me sweat, and I tried numerous times to quit because I got dirty
and broke nails," Buffy said shaking her head. "I never could've picture
me now back then, and it's hard to think of myself back then now. You just
never know what to expect."</p>

<p>"Like us," Cordelia commented leaning over to face
Buffy once again.</p>

<p>"Yeah, exactly like us. I mean, who would have thought
it? But here we are."</p>

<p>"I know I wouldn't have thought it, but I'm glad
it is," Cordelia revealed.</p>

<p>"So am I," Buffy told her leaning over and bringing
their lips together. Cordelia moved her hand to the back of Buffy's neck
deepening the kiss, drawing the smaller girl closer to her.</p>

<p>"So where do we go from here?" Cordelia asked when
they parted.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I've got a couple of ideas though,"
Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"Go with the flow?" Cordelia questioned smiling.</p>

<p>"Something like that," Buffy answered bringing their
lips together once again.</p>
