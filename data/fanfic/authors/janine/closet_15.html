<!-- The Closet \ Part Fifteen -->

<p>Sam held Brooke's open palm in her hand, cradling the delicate
appendage as she traced the lines of the blonde's hand gently, her
finger practically hovering, barely grazing the flash beneath it.  Sam
could feel Brooke's eyes on her as the cheerleader silently watched
her; she liked the feeling, it sent a hum of excitement through her
body, warmed her over to feel Brooke's eyes on her, burning into her.
 She looked up meeting the blonde's clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You have the most delicate hands," Sam said softly, her voice holding
a touch of wonder.  "Looking at them, I feel like I could break them,
but," as she said that Brooke moved her hand firmly grasping Sam's in
her own, taking it captive, "they're so strong," Sam continued a small
smile playing across her lips.  "I wonder…"</p>

<p>"You wonder what?" Brooke asked maintaining her hold on Sam's hand,
stroking it absently as she waited for the journalist's response.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the same applies to the rest of you," Sam answered after
a moments hesitation.  Brooke didn't respond right away, instead she
dropped her gaze down to their joined hands, watching her own as they
moved across Sam's skin.</p>

<p>"I don't know the answer to that," the cheerleader responded softly as
she raised to eyes to meet Sam's once again.  "Maybe," she continued
dipping her head shyly, "maybe you'll help me find out."</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked genuinely curious.  She had just spent the last
fifteen minutes listening to Brooke tell her that at some point she
had realized that her feelings for Sam had become more than sisterly,
and that she had been rather alarmed by the development at first and
tried to deny it, but that recently - said with a impish smile - she
had become more comfortable with the way she was feeling.  But even
after listening to Brooke, Sam still wasn't really sure about anything
other than the fact that Brooke found her as attractive as she found
Brooke.</p>

<p>"I was being serious when I said you were more than a sex-monkey to
me," Brooke said in a semi-serious tone, trying to keep the situation
light but also convey to Sam the fact that she did want more than just
someone to release stress with.  "I'm not going to lie and tell you
that I know with absolute certainty what's going inside of me, but I
can tell you that I have feelings for you that are more than skin
deep, and that I want to know what it is we could have together-if
anything-because I think that this could be something special," she
finished watching Sam intently.  "If you want that that is," she added
suddenly, her brows drawing together.  "I mean you never said…if you
just…"</p>

<p>"Wanted a sex-monkey?" Sam offered helpfully.</p>

<p>"That term is going to be with us for a while isn't it?" Brooke asked
rhetorically before shaking her head and focusing back on Sam.  "But
yeah."</p>

<p>"What if that was all that I wanted?" Sam asked watching Brooke
carefully.</p>

<p>"Then," Brooke said pausing.  Sam could she her eyes shifting around
as she thought and found herself wondering what was going on in the
beautiful head.  "I'd let you," Brooke finally said.</p>

<p>"But you said…why?" Sam asked placing her hand on top of Brooke's,
repossessing the blonde's hand as her own.</p>

<p>"Because, because I'd rather have you for a little while than not at
all," Brooke replied haltingly, as if the words that were coming out
of her mouth were a revelation even to her.  "Certainly it wouldn't be
the great follow-up to my last relationship that I was looking for
but…" she left the sentence hanging.  "Is that?  What you want I mean.
 Purely physical?"  she asked in a tone that Sam couldn't quite
decipher.  "In your dreams was I your sex-monkey?"</p>

<p>"No," Sam said shifting closer to Brooke.  "And that's not what I
wanted, want or would possibly want in the future," she continued
looking right into Brooke's eyes, stressing each and every word so
that there could be no doubt whatsoever as to the sincerity of her
words.</p>

<p>"So what does this mean?" Brooke asked relieved to hear that Sam was
interested in more than just her body, because frankly while she was
certain she would have given it to the brunette she wanted more than
just that and she knew she never would have been happy if she'd had to
settle.  "That you and I are interested in each other as people."</p>

<p>"That we're now going steady?" Sam suggested.</p>

<p>"That would make you my girl," Brooke replied smiling, as if she was
testing out how the words would sound coming out of her mouth and
deciding that she liked it a lot.  "And if you're my girl," Brooke
continued still smiling, but instead of finishing her sentence she
leaned forward and pressed her lips against Sam's softly.  Sam then
leaned forward increasing the pressure and the intensity of their
kiss, her hands making their way up Brooke's body and behind her neck
and their lips crashed against each other again and again with a
growing hunger. </p>

<p>"I think," Sam said, still trying to catch her breath as they broke
apart.  "That I'm going to like being your girl," she continued as a
sexy grin spread across her lips.</p>

<p>"Good," Brooke replied.  "I'm glad we're agreed on this.  Now," she
said smiling herself, "I would like to request some more sugar,"  she
continued barely managing to get the words out before Sam took
possession of her lips once more.</p>
