<p>Willow sat on her bed in the room she shared with Buffy and silently starred at the wall. Buffy had gone out to patrol about an hour before so she was alone in the room. There the slightest sound of music filtering into the room from the room next door but Willow hardly noticed it.</p>
<p>It had been a week since Oz had left town. Just picked up and took off. Had picked up and left her. The first few days after it happened Willow as crushed, the mere act of breathing had been hard for her. She hadn't wanted to eat anything or do anything. But now a week had passed and she found that she wasn't feeling like that anymore. In fact she found that she was feeling fine. And that's what confused her. Her wolfy had gone…but she was alright with it. What was that about?</p>
<p>Snapping out of it, she turned her head towards the door. No Buffy. She knew that her friend had to out and protect people and stuff, but she really wished that would get back. There wasn't anything really pressing that she had to discuss with Buffy, no earthling shattering news to deliver, she just missed her and wanted her back home.</p>
<p>Being an only child Willow had never know what it was like to have share things with another person until she and Buffy had become roomies. And she discovered that she absolutely loved it. They had become so much closer since they started living together, and as Willow glanced at the clock again, more possessive she realized.</p>
<p>Finally, about ten minutes after Willow had started her door watching campaign Buffy opened the door and came into the room grumbling.</p>
<p>"Stupid vampires think they're so tough," Buffy said throwing her bag over onto her bed. "Look at my shirt, it's ruined, deceased, gone, to be buried and not rise again. I tell you Will it would make my job so much easier if they'd just come back to life BEFORE they're buried. I hate being covered in maggot!" Buffy continued before finally turning around to face her friend. "You okay Will?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…fine…just you know working on the whole 'centering my being' thing," Willow responded quickly.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Buffy asked moving over to Willow's bed and taking a seat on the end of it.</p>
<p>"I was just…."</p>
<p>"Thinking about Oz," Buffy said finishing her sentence. She practically spat out Oz's name. In another time and place the way she said it almost would have been funny.</p>
<p>"Sort of…I mean I guess he's in there, with other people. I guess my mind was just wandering," Willow responded. "You look tired," she continued placing her hand on Buffy's knee. Buffy pulled away.</p>
<p>"I'm all dirty," Buffy said standing up and brushing off the part of Willow's bed she had been sitting on.</p>
<p>"Covered in maggot," Willow added nodding along. "Don't you hate that."?</p>
<p>"Probably only you would have an idea just how much," Buffy said smirking. There were so few people you could discuss being covered in maggot with. "Listen," Buffy continued a moment later as she walked over to her closet. "I'm going to go take a shower, but when I get back I promise we're going to do some wild and wacky. In other words funny filled of fun filled fun…ny, fun…well it's going to be fun," she managed to get out. Despite what Willow said Buffy still felt that she could use some cheering up and she was just the Slayer to do it.</p>
<p>"Buffy," Willow started to protest. She knew that Buffy was just doing this because she thought that she was upset.</p>
<p>"No, I have declared that there shall be fun and fun there shall be. They're be fun if I have to kill myself making it," Buffy interrupted grabbing her robe.</p>
<p>"Alright," Willow said sighing, still thinking that Buffy would be better off just going to sleep. She knew how hectic her friends schedule was and didn't want to make it any harder for her.</p>
<p>"Try to contain you excitement Will…you don't want to hurt yourself," Buffy responded walking over so that she was standing in front of her. "Hey," Buffy said reaching down and placing her hand on Willow's shoulder. "It'll be okay…I promise."</p>
<p>"I know," Willow responded.</p>
<p>"I'll be back ASAP," Buffy said stepping back and heading for the door. "Before I go remember this…" Buffy continued.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I love you," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"I'll remember," Willow said smiling. Buffy smiled back.</p>
<p>"Good." Then she was out the door.</p>
<p>Willow walked down to the common room packet of microvwavable popcorny goodness in hand. If they were going to stay up having fun they could as well be having fun on a full stomach. The common room was empty which was okay with Willow. Popping the bag into the microwave she set the timer and flopped down into one of the nearby chairs and smiled. She was suddenly in a good mood again. But, she thought to herself, Buffy seemed to do that to her.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Willow heard the ping of microwave and headed back to their room. Placing the popcorn into a bowel she lay down on her bed to wait for Buffy.</p>
<p>It was sunny out, and warm. Willow could feel the rays of the sun warming her skin. She could hear the sound of water in the distance and headed towards it. There was a river. She smiled and rolled up the legs of her pants and lay down so that her feet were just barely touching the water and looked up at the sky trying to pick out shapes.</p>
<p>A moment later she felt a tingling at her ankle. Someone was kissing her ankle, and she smiled again but did look down. The kisses moved up the bare part of her leg then stopped when they reached her pants. There was no contact for a moment and she was tempted to look down but she didn't.</p>
<p>Then a moment later she felt the lips on her again, this time on her hands, moving all the way up her arms. Then they were on her neck, then her checks, then they were pressed against her lips. They were warm and soft and Willow opened her mouth willingly and the kiss deepened.</p>
<p>They continued in that fashion for a moment before the lips moved away and over to her ears.</p>
<p>"Remember one thing…" the voice said.</p>
<p>"What?" Willow heard herself ask. The voice was faint and whispery but she knew she knew it.</p>
<p>"I love you," the voice responded. Willow gasped and moved so that she could the see the person whispering to her.</p>
<p>"Buffy…" Willow said softly. And Buffy smiled and leaned back down bringing their lips together.</p>
<p>Willow jerked up violently, and breathing heavily. "Uh oh," she said softly before letting her head drop back to the pillow.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy rested her head against the wall of the stall letting the water fall over her. Nobody else was in the washroom for which she was eternally grateful. As the spray continued to beat over her skin she sighed. The shower wasn't helping things any. As had come to shower as much to clear her mind as to actually get clean, and while she was now considerably cleaner her head still wasn't clear. She kept on seeing the smile on Willow's face after she had told her that she loved her.</p>
<p>She pushed away from the wall in frustration and ran a hand through her wet hair. She wasn't going say that the feeling she found herself dealing with now were new or were a surprise because that would a lie. She had felt them growing for years, she had been aware of them for years…it was just the direction that they had gone in that had surprised her.</p>
<p>Throughout the last three years there had been a love growing between Willow and herself. It had been formed through mutual experiences, and shared hurt and joy, and a genuine affection for each other. Willow had become one of the most important people in her life. Even when she was still with Angel she had prayed that she never had to choose between the two of them, because for all of talk about how much in love she was with Angel, she couldn't have been completely sure that she would've picked him.</p>
<p>And now, now the love and affection that she had felt for Willow in the past had grown, and evolved, and changed into something with an intensity that not even she was really prepared for. It had turned into passion, it was love and passion and it was all for Willow.</p>
<p>Willow who could never, ever, find out how she felt.</p>

<p>Buffy turned off the shower and got out. She had been away for too long already. She had told Willow that she would be quick, and she had been anything but.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow paced around the popcorn bowel reviewing her dream.</p>

<p>"This is bad, this is very bad," she muttered to herself. "As if falling for a werewolf wasn't bad enough, now I gotta go for my best friend," she continued. Suddenly a lot of things were making sense to her. Things like why her toes always got all tingly whenever Buffy was around. Things like why she got a fluttery feeling in her stomach whenever Buffy touched her. Things like why she would lie on Buffy's bed sometimes when she wasn't there…she realized it wasn't because she wanted to warm up the bed like she had told herself, it was because she wanted to close to something distinctly Buffy.</p>
<p>Her miraculous recovery over the desertion of Oz suddenly seemed less miraculous.</p>
<p>Willow heard the door start to open and jumped.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" she said in a squeaky voice.</p>

<p>"Last time I checked," Buffy said breezing into the room. "Will, I really think you consider my suggestion about switching to decafe… I worry."</p>
<p>"Decafe, to calm be down. As in the opposite of caff which would excite me…not that I'm excited or anything cause I'm not…excited," Willow responded.</p>
<p>"I can see that, you're clearly not excited…I don't know what I was thinking," Buffy responded opening her closet. Throwing her night stuff onto the bed she started to open her robe.</p>
<p>"What? What are you doing?" Willow asked. The squeaky voice was back.</p>

<p>"Getting dressed," Buffy responded shooting a quizzical look back at Willow.</p>

<p>"Are you going to take it off," Willow said staring at the robe.</p>

<p>"That depends on how much money your offering," Buffy responded with a lecherous grin.</p>
<p>Willow simply stared at her in horror.</p>

<p>"That was a joke Willow, you can laugh now," Buffy said when she got no reaction from her friend.</p>
<p>"Oh…yeah…hee," Willow responded though she still looked like a deer caught in headlights.</p>
<p>"We've definitely got to find you find the fun," Buffy said heading behind the closet door to change.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Buffy there are only two of us, how are we suppose to play Truth or Dare?" Willow asked eyeing her friend doubtfully.</p>
<p>"The same way you play with more people only this way we get more turns," Buffy responded thinking that perhaps she should have put more thought into the fun they were going to have.</p>
<p>"Okay," Willow said in the same doubtful tone as before.</p>

<p>"Okay," Buffy said in a chipper tone. "So…truthfully how good kisser is Xander?"</p>
<p>Willow sighed, it was going to be a long night.</p>

<hr width=100>


<p>They had finished off the popcorn and were now lying around drinking the beer Xander had swiped the bar and hide at their place so his mom wouldn't find it.</p>
<p>"Alright," Buffy said. "Who was the last person you fantasized about sexually?"</p>
<p>"I can't, you can't, I can't, you can't, I can't…dare," Willow responded finally.</p>
<p>"Fine, I dare you to tell me," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>"You can't do that, that is completely against the rules, not to mention ethically and morally unconscionable," Willow responded.</p>
<p>"Fine," Buffy said turning onto her side so that she was facing Willow. "I dare you to…" she paused trying to stall for time. She needed to dare Willow to do something that she wouldn't normally do something that…"I dare you to kiss me," Buffy blurted out before she realized what she was doing. Damn subconscious, she thought to herself.</p>
<p>"What?" Willow asked alarmed.</p>

<p>"I dared you to kiss me," Buffy said not wanting to back down. "Either you kiss me or tell me who you last fantasized about."</p>
<p>"But…but….but…"</p>

<p>"If you don't do one or the other it would be morally not to mention ethically unconscionable," Buffy said.</p>
<p>Willow stared at her for a moment. Either way she was screwed. She knew that she couldn't lie to Buffy…it wasn't so much that she was resent to the idea as it was that Buffy would know she was lying.</p>
<p>"Kiss how?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Kiss kiss," Buffy responded. She didn't know why she was insisting on this…but then again she did. This was probably the only the only chance she would ever get to know what it felt like to kiss Willow, and she just couldn't pass up the opportunity. She just couldn't.</p>
<p>"Okay," Willow said moving over to where Buffy was lying down.</p>

<p>Buffy sat up so that they were facing each other. They starred at each other slightly for a moment then Willow reached over and placed her hand of Buffy's face. Then she slowly leaned in and brought they're lips together. It was slow and tentative at first. Neither sure how far they could or should take it, but soon instinct and need took over and the dare was forgotten. They moved closer together, and Buffy entered Willow's mouth with her tongue deepening the kiss. Their hands started to roam each others bodies as they sought to get closer together.</p>
<p>Finally, they managed to pull away from each other.</p>

<p>"Well," Buffy said. "That went …which is to say that it…went."</p>

<p>"My feelings exactly about the…going…and how it went," Willow responded.</p>

<p>They continued to stare at each other for a moment. Then Buffy closed the distance between them and brought their lips back together.</p>
<p>"Buffy," Willow said in between kisses.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Buffy responded in a half moan.</p>

<p>"I think I found the fun," Willow told her smiling.</p>

<p>"I think we've both found the fun," Buffy responded before they closed the distance between them once again.</p>
