<!-- Not So Bad Beer \ Part 1 -->

<p>It had been an interesting night to say the least. Not only had she verbally attacked Parker in an utterly compelling way, but she had almost been burned to death and ended up being saved by a devolved version of her best friend. A version who was fond of clubbing people over the head, and seemed to get immense pleasure out of playing with her hair. Willow sighed and shook her head, sometimes her life was weird even to her which was saying a whole lot.</p>
<p>Buffy looked over at Willow when she heard the girl sigh and cocked her head to the side. She walked for a few more moments watching Willow rub her eyes before she spoke.</p>
<p>&#34;Girl tired,&#34; Buffy said stopping. &#34;Buffy help girl,&#34; she said firmly and she reached out for Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;It's okay Buffy, really. I'm just a little…Buffy…wait…what…&#34; was all Willow managed to get out before she was flung over Buffy's shoulder.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy make it better see,&#34; Buffy said as she started to walk again. She sounded very pleased with herself and Willow was glad that Buffy was glad because she really didn't want Buffy to be upset because Buffy seemed to like to hit people over the head with sticks when she didn't like them, but she really, really wanted down.</p>
<p>&#34;I really appreciate the effort you're trying to make here, it's really very sweet, and I'm really really grateful, but I would like very much to be put down now. Very much,&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy help, girl tired, Buffy carry girl. All good,&#34; Buffy responded not breaking stride.</p>
<p>Willow sighed again, and they walked in silence for a moment before Willow finally looked at the two men walking behind them who were being unusually quiet. Looking up Willow managed to make eye contact with Giles. The look on her face clearly said &#34;Help me!&#34;. Giles nodded his head and quickened his pace so that he was walking beside Willow and Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, perhaps it would be best if you were to put Willow down now,&#34; the Watcher started. Buffy stopped walking and turned to face him.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; she said. Then with her free hand she poked him in the chest with her finger. &#34;Quiet you.&#34; With that she continued walking again.</p>
<p>Willow looked back at Giles imploringly again.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, I really think it would be best if you were to…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why you still talk?&#34; Buffy asked whirling around to face him again. &#34;If you still talk, Buffy make you stop talk,&#34; she said making a fist. Giles stared at her for a second then made the wise decision and stepped away.</p>
<p>&#34;Although not very manly I think you made the right decision,&#34; Xander said slapping Giles on the back.</p>
<p>&#34;Would you care to give it a go?&#34; Giles asked turning to face Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't mind if I do,&#34; Xander said. Willow watched as he walked past her so that he was beside Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; was all he managed to get out before she shoved him away from her.  After that Xander followed Giles lead.</p>
<p>&#34;I know that she's devolved but that was still very, rude. I mean, I'm her beer dude, her connection, her alcoholic pimp,&#34; Xander said in a wounded voice.</p>
<p>&#34;Beer?&#34; Buffy said turning around. &#34;Where beer? Buffy want beer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's no beer Buffy,&#34; Willow said finally giving into the ride.</p>
<p>&#34;Man say beer,&#34; Buffy responded looking back at Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;Man was wrong,&#34; Willow said calmly.</p>
<p>&#34;Bad man,&#34; Buffy said.</p>

<p>Once they got to the door of their room Buffy reached for the door then stopped momentarily captivated by the shiny surface of the door knob. She poked at it at first, then flicked it with her nail before finally turning it. Once she figured out how to turn it was only a matter of moments before she managed to get the door open. The truly amazing part wasn't that she figured out how to do all of that, but that she was able to do so without putting Willow down.</p>
<p>Once they were in the room Buffy walked over to the bed closest to the door (which just happened to be her own) and flung Willow down on it.</p>
<p>&#34;See Buffy help,&#34; she said smiling down at Willow. The smile was open, and caring, and infectious and Willow smiled back.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes, Buffy help. Thank you,&#34; Willow responded. Buffy smiled again then turned to face Xander and Giles who were standing just inside of the door.</p>
<p>&#34;Men go now,&#34; she said walking towards them. &#34;Girl home, Buffy home,&#34; she continued ushering them the short way to the door. &#34;Go home.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles managed to stop short of actually being pushed out of the door and walked around Buffy until he could see Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow are you going to be alright here, if…well it wouldn't be any trouble for…&#34; Giles started to say but Willow interrupted.</p>
<p>&#34;It's alright Giles, really, we'll be fine,&#34; Willow said noticing the way Buffy was staring at him.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you sure Will,&#34; Xander said. &#34;It could be like a slumber party, Buffy and I could bunk together and Will and Giles…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Xander!&#34; Willow exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander!&#34; Giles exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#34;What? It was just a suggestion,&#34; Xander said defensively.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said getting up off of the bed. Buffy walked over to her immediately her attention completely focused on Willow. &#34;Here, look at this for a moment,&#34; Willow said turning on the TV Buffy looked at the little people on the screen then looked back at Willow before returning her attention to the screen.</p>
<p>Satisfied that Buffy was occupied Willow walked to where Giles and Xander were standing.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not completely comfortable leaving you here with her,&#34; Giles said his attention focused on Buffy in background. &#34;Her moods have proven to be unpredictable, she could become violent.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow protested. &#34;Buffy would never hurt me, not even cave Buffy,&#34; she continued. &#34;I know that she seems different, but deep down she's still Buffy. Everything she's done to tonight has been to help me…well that and get beer, but what I'm saying is that she wouldn't ever hurt me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He may be right Will,&#34; Xander said. &#34;You might tell her to go to bed, and if she doesn't like the suggestion she could introduce you to Mr. Club.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Giles, Xander,&#34; Willow said firmly. &#34;I understand that you're concerned but I promise everything will be fine. Buffy likes me, she won't do anything to me. I'm sure that everything will be fine.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once Willow managed to get Xander and Giles out of their room she walked over to her bed and flopped back down on it. She closed her eyes and flung her arm over her eyes. It had been a long, long, night. A few seconds after she lay down on the bed she heard Buffy get up. A moment later she felt the bed bounce.</p>
<p>&#34;Will-ow,&#34; Buffy said softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Willow said not moving.</p>
<p>&#34;You okay?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow took her arm from over her face so that she could see Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm okay Buffy,&#34; Willow said smiling slightly. &#34;I'm just tired, and dirty, and…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly,&#34; Buffy supplied.</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly,&#34; Willow repeated.</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly,&#34; Buffy confirmed.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not,&#34; Willow started to say as she lifted an arm to her nose. &#34;Okay so maybe a little bit,&#34; Willow conceded.</p>
<p>&#34;It okay,&#34; Buffy said quickly sensing that she had upset Willow. &#34;Girl still beautiful,&#34; she continued in a softer voice. Willow looked over at her surprised. Beautiful, Buffy had never her called that before. Then again, she thought, best friends don't go around telling each other they're beautiful, even if that's what they're thinking. On lots of separate occasions Willow could have told Buffy that she was wholly beautiful…but you just don't do that. Do you?</p>
<p>&#34;Smelly and beautiful, that's an interesting combination,&#34; Willow said more to say something than anything else. &#34;I guess that I could do something about the smelly.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What?&#34; Buffy asked cocking her head to the side again.</p>
<p>&#34;Shower,&#34; Willow said sitting up. &#34;Definitely a shower.&#34; A shower would give her a chance to put everything that had been going on lately into perspective. Things not just with Buffy but with Oz too. Having one of them distant would have been hard enough, but now she had no idea what was going on with her boyfriend and her best friend was a Neanderthal.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy help,&#34; Buffy said reaching out for Willow again.</p>
<p>&#34;No, that's okay,&#34; Willow said moving out of her range. &#34;I'll walk this time,&#34; she continued as she headed over to her closet to get her robe.</p>
<p>&#34;Sure?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Buffy strong,&#34; she continued.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, I think I can manage,&#34; Willow said smiling to herself. One thing that could be said for this version of Buffy was that she was certainly attentive.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy go too,&#34; Buffy said moving over behind Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;No, Buffy stay, Willow go,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy smelly too, Buffy want sho-wer…Buffy want to go with Will-ow,&#34; Buffy said getting slightly agitated. &#34;Please,&#34; Buffy said softly this time looking directly into Willow's eyes. &#34;No want to be alone.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow looked down into Buffy's green eyes and didn't even have to think about her answer. Just like with normal Buffy, this Buffy's eyes were very expressive and what Willow saw in them broke her heart. Buffy was scared, and sad, and lonely, and Willow was the one that she wanted. Willow couldn't have said no even if she had really wanted to.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said grabbing Buffy's robe and handing it over to cave to her. &#34;You can come…but you have to behave.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Promise,&#34; Buffy said with a smile. &#34;Be good just like Will-ow.&#34;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once they arrived in the, thankfully, empty washroom Willow spent a few minutes demonstrating to Buffy how to use the knobs and dials in the shower and how to lather and apply as well as wash off soap. Buffy's enthusiasm made the lesson take a little longer than it should have but after about ten minutes she was satisfied Buffy had understood her.</p>
<p>Willow turned on shower and sighed. This was a very, very, good idea, she decided. After a few minutes of pure relaxation her mind started to wander into decidedly unpleasant territory. Oz and his new obsession Veruca. She had no evidence that anything was going on, but she didn't need any evidence, she could feel it in her bones. She was sure that nothing had gone on, but she got the feeling that she was just waiting for a &#34;yet&#34;, nothing had happened yet.</p>
<p>She didn't know how she would have gotten through what had been going through without Buffy by her side. No matter what was going on with slaying or with Parker, or with anything, Buffy was there for her. Just being in Buffy's presence made her feel better, even this version of Buffy.</p>
<p>Willow was about to reach for her shampoo bottle when she heard the shower door open. She was about to tell whoever it was that the stall was most definitely occupied when they spoke.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy no like over there,&#34; the Slayer said stepping completely into the shower. Willow turned around crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy you can't stay in here,&#34; Willow said her voice raising a couple octaves. &#34;This is a private place.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy no like over there,&#34; the blond repeated. &#34;'Sides, Buffy clean see,&#34; Buffy displaying her body to Willow. Willow stared for a second then ripped her eyes away. There was no way she was going to stand there in the shower naked looking at her best friends nude, wet, nude, nude, did she mention nude form.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, you can't just, it's not…you really should…because being in…we shouldn't be…&#34; Willow said not being able to get anything coherent out. She just wasn't familiar with the etiquette for a situation like this.</p>
<p>&#34;It okay,&#34; Buffy said soothingly seeing that Willow was upset. &#34;Buffy clean now,&#34; she continued reaching out for Willow's hand. &#34;See,&#34; Buffy said placing Willow's hand on her stomach. &#34;All clean.&#34; Willow managed to nod, or at least she thought she nodded. She couldn't believe this. &#34;Buffy make Will-ow clean,&#34; Buffy said dropping Willow's hand and reaching for the soap.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said taking the soap away from her. &#34;I think emphatically not.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Buffy said taking the soap back. &#34;Fattically yes.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said again swiping for the soap and missing.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Buffy said again starting to work up a lather.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said again. She couldn't believe that she was having this conversation.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy want to help Willow,&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow started to say. &#34;I…okay,&#34; Willow finally consented. She hadn't even really thought about her answer, it had just felt like that right thing to do.</p>
<p>Buffy made no visible reaction, she just continued to lather the soap.  Having agreed Willow now watched Buffy's movements with rabid attention.  Soon Buffy was satisfied with the lather and she reached out for Willow and started to work the soap onto her arms.</p>
<p>Despite her pre-historic state of being Buffy's touch was amazing gently.  Feather light, sometimes the touch was so gentle Willow wasn't even sure Buffy was touching her. Willow closed her eyes and let her head drop down to her chest. She couldn't help it, it was all very relaxing. She could feel the tension ebbing away from her, being replaced by a fluttering warmth. Willow gasped softly her eyes popping open when she realized exactly what that warmth was. She was becoming aroused by Buffy's ministrations, by Buffy. Highly aroused at that. Then she realized where Buffy was about to clean next and knew for an absolute fact that the warmth wouldn't go away if Buffy got down there.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm clean now,&#34; Willow said suddenly reaching out and stopping Buffy's hand from wandering any further. &#34;Really very clean now, clean as can be. Just call me Mrs. Clean,&#34; Willow continued reaching for the taps and turning off the water.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy like getting clean,&#34; the Slayer said following Willow out of the stall.</p>
<p>&#34;Clean is good,&#34; Willow said reaching for her robe and pulling it on.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't reach for her robe, she simply stood there staring at Willow.  She looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow soft,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;Buffy like soft,&#34; she continued reaching out a hand. Willow took step back.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes soft is nice, nice is soft, soft nice,&#34; Willow said reaching for Buffy's robe. &#34;This is soft too, how about you put it on. It smells like lemons,&#34; Willow said shoving the robe her Buffy's direction.</p>
<p>Buffy reached out and took the robe. Once she had it in hand she brought it to her nose and smelled it. She seemed to consider something for a moment then she dropped the robe onto the ground.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, please put on the robe,&#34; Willow said. Her voice sounded desperate and she realized that that's exactly what she was. Desperate. She was desperate to get Buffy in clothes because she found her eyes wandering and didn't like what that meant considering the fact that the warmth from in the shower was still there.</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>
<p>&#34;You said you'd behave,&#34; Willow reminded. &#34;You said you'd be good like me,&#34; she continued. &#34;Were you lying…like the man?&#34; she asked referring to Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Buffy said firmly. &#34;Buffy no lie, lying bad.&#34; With that said Buffy reached down and picked up the robe.</p>
<p>&#34;Thank the Lord,&#34; Willow muttered heading for the door. Suddenly the night was looking a whole lot longer.</p>
