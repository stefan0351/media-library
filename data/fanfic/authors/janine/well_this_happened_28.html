<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 28 -->

<p>“You, Ms. McPherson, look absolutely edible,” Brooke, purred sliding up
behind Sam as they made their way towards the entrance of the club. Sam
smiled, that’s just the look she was going for.  Yah, for her.</p>

<p>“That’s Ms. Sanford of 142 Lakeshore Blvd., and thank you,” Sam responded
flashing Brooke a grin as the blonde linked their arms together.  “And you
Ms….”</p>

<p>“Seaberg, Gretchen Seaberg.  22 years of age from West Hollywood,” Brooke
filled in helpfully though she made a face when she announced where her
donor I.D. had come from.  Of all places it had to West Hollywood.  She
couldn’t help it, as much as she tried she remained an area code snob.</p>

<p>“Are like butta,” Sam continued running her eyes over Brooke’s body
appreciatively.  Brooke smiled, that’s just the effect she had been trying
to produce.  Yah, for her.</p>

<p>“Yo, Harly and Quinn,” Nicole called drawing the girls attention to her.
“This way.”</p>

<p>Nicole then led them around the side of the building, where she then left
them for a moment to go over and talk to a bouncer that was watching the
alley entrance.  She spoke to him for a minute then walked back over to
where she had left the others standing.</p>

<p>“Welcome to paradise,” she said rejoining them and gesturing for them to
follow her through the now open door.  “The drinks are expensive, and the
bartenders are rude, but on the ho train is in full effect and everybody’s
got their hooch on, so enjoy.  And remember…you don’t know me,” she finished
as they entered the main room.</p>

<p>“Ho-Ly,” Sam breathed out  as her eyes swept across the main part of the
club.</p>

<p>“This is great,” Brooke responded looking around with the same look of awe
that Sam had on her face.  The place was unbelievable.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think places like this existed off of celluloid,” Carmen breathed
out as she took in the sight in front of her.  She didn’t know what she had
gotten herself into, but she liked it.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a Tupperware party ladies.  Mingle, mingle,” Nicole said before
sweeping out into the crowd dramatically where she was soon swallowed up.</p>

<p>The club itself reminded Sam of something out of a Greek myth, or Queer as
Folk.  In the center of the room was a fountain with water flowing into it
from an artificially created fall off to the side.  The room was covered in
gold and pink and green sea-foam.  They could as well have been in
Cleopatra’s palace, or at the very least her bathhouse.  All around them
were the sounds of pulsing techno music and gyrating scantily clad bodies.
Girls and guys, guys and guys, girls and girls, everyone was with everyone
and nobody seemed to give a good goddamn.  The place was utterly trampy, it
was tacky as hell, was a virtual eyesore of indecency.  Sam smiled she liked
it, it had character.</p>

<p>She was broken out of her revere when she felt Brooke wrap her arms around
her waist place her lips right next to her ear while whispering “dance
floor, now.  I’ve wanted to get my hands on you sine you walked out of the
house…and I do believe that I’m going to get the chance” she said surveying
the crowd with a smile of her own.</p>
