<!-- The Closet \ Part Ten -->

<p>Brooke slumped back against the door and let herself slid to the
ground with a soft sigh.  They had been banging for over ten minutes
and nobody had come to let them out, leading Brooke to the conclusion
that there was nobody there to let them out, and that there probably
wouldn't be until morning.  The walls of the closet were thick and
Brooke could tell from the way their voices were being absorbed by
them next to none of the noise they were making was getting beyond the
door.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke said softly.  "Just stop," she went on.  "Nobody's out
there, sit down."</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to come by," Sam insisted even though she sunk to the
ground joining Brooke.  "A security guard or something."</p>

<p>"If one walks by we'll hear and start yelling again, but I'm not up
for continuous yelling for the rest of the night.  Doing it or hearing
it," Brooke responded tilting her head back and rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"So what are we supposed to do?" Sam asked as she focused on a rickety
looking shelving unit at the back of the closet.</p>

<p>"The way I see it we have to options.  We can sit here in silence
until someone finds us, or we can talk," Brooke replied turning to
look over at Sam.  "You indicated yesterday that you weren't totally
averse to the idea of conversing with me in a non-combative manner, so
now's our chance," she finished.</p>

<p>Sam removed her gaze from the shelving unit and turned to watch Brooke
watch her.  She was beautiful the dim light of a dusty museum
janitorial closet, Sam decided as she watched the blonde.  "What do
you want to talk about?" the brunette asked finally.  "Herman
Melville's condemnation of consumer society?"</p>

<p>Brooke smiled but shook her head.  "Actually, I was wondering how I
ended up getting trapped in here," she responded pointedly looking at
the manila folder that was now lying in Sam's lap.</p>

<p>"This could take a while," Sam said softly as she traced her finger
around the edge of the folder.  She never talked about pieces she was
working on before she had finished them, it was one of her unwritten
rules.  To break it, for Brooke - even if she did owe the girl an
explanation - would be a big step, a leap of trust as it were.</p>

<p>"If there's one thing we've got," Brooke replied watching Sam fiddle
with the folder.</p>

<p>"About a month ago I was in one of the chat rooms on…." Sam began.</p>
