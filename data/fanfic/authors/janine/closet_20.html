<!-- The Closet \ Part Twenty -->

<p>Sam sighed rolling her eyes dramatically before allowing her head to  flop down onto the table top with a dull thud.  Harrison, Lily and  Carmen were sitting around her badgering her, just like they had been  since breakfast.  She couldn't even find it amusing in an annoying  sort of way anymore she just wanted it to end.</p>

<p>"Oh my god, will you give it a rest already!" Sam finally said in a  highly exasperated tone.  "It's not that big of a deal.  I thought  that we already went through this."</p>

<p>"Bu…but that was before," Carmen sputtered.</p>

<p>"Before what?" Sam asked tiredly knowing that she didn't really want  to know.</p>

<p>"You, you, you, smiled at her," was Carmen's response.  "And you two  spoke in sentences where the word `bitch' wasn't used, not even  once.  You're really getting along.  Really," she went on sounding  more and more distressed as she continued.  "I…we…it…huh!?!"</p>

<p>"Oh good lord," Sam said pushing away from the table and standing  up.  "I'm going over there now," she said pointing vaguely to  somewhere on the other side of the room.  "I want none of you to join  me."</p>

<p> "She's not a witch," Brooke stated in an increasingly exasperated  tone. </p>

<p>"There's no other logical explanation for what's happened.  Don't be  so narrow minded Brookie, there are things in this world that just  can't be explained by anything other than dark occult forces, like  the popularity of Sabrina the Teenage Witch," Nicole responded  resting her elbows on the table and leaning towards Brooke  challengingly while Mary Cherry nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>

<p>"Really she's not that bad," Brooke said ignoring Nicole's  tirade.  "She's really smart, and funny, and if you don't provoke her  she can be really…"</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, are you hearing this?  My god, what has she done to you  Brookie?  Poor, sweet, simple Brooke," Nicole went on turning to Mary  Cherry.  "Her naive little mind just couldn't hold up against the she- demons constant assaults."</p>

<p>Brooke gaped at Nicole for a moment, truly shocked at the words that  were coming out of the blonde's mouth.  She may have been a lot of  things, but simple wasn't one of them.  Then as if that wasn't bad  enough Mary Cherry decided to add her fifty cents to the  conversation.  Finally Brooke just leaned back surveying the room  around them while Nicole and Mary Cherry discussed what a lost cause  she was and how they might be able to save her soul. </p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Nicole asked suddenly noticing Brooke push  back from the table and stand up.</p>

<p>"My master awaits," Brooke responded with a slight smile as she  turned and looked in the direction Sam had just taken off in.  "But  don't give up on me, you two seemed to be onto something a minute  ago."  </p>

<p>With that she walked over to Sam who had settled herself against the  side of one of the rooms pools tables.</p>

<p>"Do you play, or is it all about the look?" Brooke asked settling  next to Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm the real deal," Sam responded keeping her eyes trained on  something in the distance.</p>

<p>"Prove it," Brooke said moving off to the side and picking up two  pool cues.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can handle me," Sam said accepting the cue  nonetheless.</p>

<p>"We'll see," Brooke said softly raking her eyes over Sam  thoughtfully.  "Let's hope not."</p>

<p>Feeling herself start to flush under Brooke's heady eyes, Sam moved  to the other end of the table silently setting up the balls.  When  she was done she looked over to Brooke indicating that she could  break, then she stepped back from the table watching as Brooke slowed  leaned over the table, her eyes never leaving Sam's.</p>

<p>Sam jumped slightly, the sound of the balls scattering jarring her  out of her daze.  The thing she remembered was watching Brooke lick  her lips, before they parted slightly in preparation for her strike.   Focusing on Brooke again Sam saw her grinning at her mischievously.</p>

<p>"I'm solid," was all the blonde said, then she moved over to Sam's  side of the table brushing up against the brunette's back as she  walked past her.  "Six ball, corner pocket."</p>
