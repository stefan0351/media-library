<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 20 -->

<p>Katie closed her eyes letting the breeze from the open
window rush across her face. Finally opening them once more she looked down at the small
device in her hand and turned it on, scanning the words that appeared on the small screen
once more. It was a development offer for a gallery in Chicago. She'd be given
effective ownership of the gallery through a fifty- five percent share, in return for
managing it and contributing pieces of work on a bi-annual basis for name recognition. The
offer was tempting, more than tempting, it was a generous gift that she by all rights
shouldn't have received, especially considering that she had publicly retired from
professional painting - a decision she had constantly been debating with herself
about since the moment she had made it.</p>

<p>Sighing she dropped her head back against the back of her
couch her eyes drifting back towards the bedroom. Who was it tonight? Stephanie, that was
right, the best thing about the class she had been teaching. Katie rolled her eyes and sat
back up, the thought that the woman lying on her bed who she could barely talk to without
wanting to boil her own head was actually the best thing about her recent position
snapping her out of her malaise.</p>

<p>Katie looked back down at the letter in her hands and
smiled. She'd accept it, why the hell not, even if it was in Chicago. Whatever it was
that she was doing in her loft in London certainly wasn't what she wanted, it
hadn't been what she had wanted for quite some time, so she could as well go back.
Yeah, she could as well go back, why the hell not, there was certainly nothing to keep her
in England, and this opportunity was just what she needed. An opportunity to paint, teach
and scout for new talent, it was a dream, one she intended to catch.</p>
