<!-- Not So Bad Beer \ Part 3 -->

<p>The first thing Buffy became aware of was the feeling of warmth enveloping her. It was like she was lying against a giant hot water bottle. It was nice…it was person, she realized with a start. Immediately her eyes opened and went straight to the form in front of her. Willow. She was lying in bed with Willow. In Willow's bed she realized. Then she looked down. She was lying in bed with Willow half naked…with a headache.</p>
<p>Headache, she thought to herself. Why do I have a headache? It was much safer to first try and find out why she had a headache than why she was undressed and in bed with her best friend. Then she remembered the beer.  The bad beer.</p>
<p>Once she remembered the beer images soon started to come back to her about the night. It was fuzzy and there were parts that were completely blank, but she was able to put together most of it. Basically what she figured out was that she had drunken drugged beer and it made her devolve, then she had been in a fire. Willow was there too, in the fire, and she had saved her.  Then she remembered hitting Parker over the head with a big stick. Up to that she was clear on what happened, but the rest of it…the rest of it was decidedly more difficult.</p>
<p>After that she remember carrying Willow back to their room. She had a vague recollection of Giles and Xander, but she wasn't sure about what they were doing. Then she remember being in the shower with Willow…washing Willow.  She remembered being in the shower with Willow washing her naked body, Willow's naked, wet body. Then she remembered playing with a snow globe.  Willow's snow globe, and after that flinging clothes all over the place.  Then she remembered playing with Willow's hair and…and kissing her. She remembered kissing Willow. Oh god, she kissed Willow. Hell, she groped Willow, full body groped.</p>
<p>She returned her attention to mop of red hair nestled against her shoulder, then looked up at the ceiling, staring. She couldn't remember enough about what happened. She had to remember what exactly happened. Then she got a flash of Willow holding her back and telling her 'no'. Her heart froze when that image floated into her head. If she had hurt Willow or forced her to do something she didn't want to, she didn't know what she would do. No, she did know what she would do. She'd tell Oz and let his wolfy self rip her to pieces. Tiny little pieces.</p>
<p>She looked back down at Willow who was still sleeping soundly. Turning her head to the side she saw that it was still dark out. She then turned her attention to the clock which read 5:30 am. I've got to get up, Buffy thought to herself. She had to think. She started to move her arm which was wrapped around Willow when the hacker started to stir.</p>
<p>Willow seemed disoriented at first like she had been then the hacker looked up at her. Willow's hair was disheveled and eyes were still sleepy, she was the most beautiful sight Buffy had ever seen in her life.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey, sleepy-head,&#34; Buffy said forcing a smile across her face. Willow blinked and looked at her for moment.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; she asked. &#34;Real, non-Cro-Magnon Buffy?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Completely of this century,&#34; Buffy responded watching Willow's reactions closely. Willow smiled and moved the few centi-meters necessary to hug her. Buffy hugged her back, then they pulled away from each both very aware of the issues at hand.</p>
<p>&#34;We had an interesting night didn't we?&#34; Buffy asked looking around the room.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you remember…last night I mean?&#34; Willow asked looking at Buffy intently. There was trepidation in her voice, Buffy could feel it.</p>
<p>&#34;Bit's and pieces,&#34; Buffy responded carefully. She had to careful, she couldn't lie, Willow would know she was lying, but she wasn't going to volunteer anything either. &#34;I remember hitting Parker,&#34; she continued smiling. Willow smiled back and then they spent a few moments in comfortable silence.</p>
<p>&#34;What else?&#34; Willow asked finally.</p>
<p>&#34;It's pretty fuzzy right now,&#34; Buffy told her. &#34;I'm…I'm not really sure what happened,&#34; she said sticking to the truth. &#34;I know I'm not going drinking for a while. And that I'm going to kill Xander, but beside that…&#34; she just shrugged.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Willow said. She sounded relived. Buffy didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. &#34;I'm sure it'll come back to you eventually.  Slayer powers and everything. The strength and memory of an elephant.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Should I take offense to being compared to a large, smelly, mammal?&#34; Buffy asked stalling for time.</p>
<p>&#34;Elephants are very noble creatures,&#34; Willow responded. &#34;If it wasn't for those snotty lions they'd be king of beasts.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't you just hate those lions,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>
<p>&#34;With a passion,&#34; Willow answered.</p>
<p>They remained in silence after that for a moment.</p>
<p>&#34;Will?&#34; Buffy asked breaking the silence. &#34;I didn't do anything last night did I? You know, anything that could possibly get me arrested or anything?  Did I?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No, you were a fairly well behaved Neanderthal,&#34; Willow responded. &#34;You didn't much care for clothes…but other than that…&#34; Willow continued.</p>
<p>&#34;So, ah, this is the result of my lack of fondness for clothing,&#34; Buffy said looking down at her lack of attire.</p>
<p>&#34;Pretty much,&#34; Willow answered. &#34;And you have no idea how long it took me to get you into that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What was I wearing befo…ohhh,&#34; Buffy responded realizing the answer to her own question. &#34;I should probably…you know put on some clothes or something,&#34; Buffy said getting up off of the bed.</p>
<p>&#34;Clothes are good,&#34; Willow agreed. &#34;They keep you warm…or cool…plus they look nice. In general they look nice, not that they just look nice on you, not that they don't look nice on you, they just look nice on a lot of people including you, not that your not people, just that…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Clothes are nice,&#34; Buffy said interrupting Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow said. She was now sitting cross-legged on her bed looking at everything but Buffy. Finally, Willow looked over at Buffy who was pulling on a pair of a pajama pants. &#34;I think I'm just going to hit the hay again…I'm kind of tired.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Buffy said looking back at her. &#34;I'm sorry if I kept you up last night, I guess my cave-mother didn't teach me very good manners.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's okay, you didn't keep me up,&#34; Willow said. Buffy looked back at her with a disbelieving look. &#34;Much, you didn't keep me up much.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Go to sleep Will,&#34; Buffy said heading over to her bed.</p>
<p>&#34;I have a class at…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;I'll make sure you're up in time.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Willow said closing her eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;Anything for my Will,&#34; Buffy responded softly lying down.</p>
<p>Soon after her head hit the pillow her thoughts drifted to the past, to Willow. She had realized that the feelings she had for Willow were deep for some time, years even. And that night two Halloweens ago when she had seen Willow in her bad girl outfit and then again when she had seen her leather bound doppelganger she had felt pangs of desire. Strong pangs of desire.  Throbbing, strong, pangs of desire. But she had buried them when she had felt them then because she already had enough on her plate with Angel, and slaying. And then Faith had come along, and added a whole new set of problems to everything. She knew she loved for Willow for years, she even told her that she kinda loved her, but she wasn't or didn't want to be aware of what kind of love it was that she had for Willow.</p>
<p>She had been able to deny the feelings for years, but when Angel left at the end of the school year, and was no longer there to consume her thoughts, Buffy found herself thinking about Willow more and more. Wanting to be with Willow more and more, and finally being the person that she was she was not able to deny what she was feeling anymore. She had to admit that she just didn't love Willow, she was IN love with Willow.</p>
<p>But Willow was with Oz. And Oz was with Willow. A they were happy, and together and snuggly. But more importantly they were happy. Buffy was willing to take the chance and tell Willow how she felt, she was confident that even if Willow didn't return her affections that they could remain friends, the bond they had was that strong she was sure of it. But she never could tell Willow, because she was with Oz, and as much as Buffy wanted to be with her, or at least wanted the chance to perhaps be with her, she wasn't going to sacrifice Willow's happiness with Oz for it. She loved Willow enough to let her live her life.</p>
<p>And then, then she had to go and drink some bad beer. And know she had memories about what Willow's lips felt like. Memories of holding her close and melding their bodies together. She had memories of what it felt like to be enveloped in Willow's warmth and feel her love. And there was nothing, absolutely nothing that she could do about it. Because Willow was with Oz, and Oz was with Willow</p>
<p>Buffy glanced over at the clock. It was 7:00 am, time for Willow to get up.</p>
<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy said touching her on the shoulder. &#34;Wakey, wakey.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said opening her eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;Time to wake up, little tree,&#34; Buffy said smiling. &#34;It's the beginning of a brand new day.&#34;</p>
