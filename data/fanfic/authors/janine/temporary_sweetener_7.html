<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 6 -->

<p>Buffy watched her hand as her fingers slowly trailed up and around  Cordelia's abdominal muscles, raising and falling with the brunette's  gentle breathes.  "That tickles," she heard the woman say a moment  later, her hand coming to rest on top of Buffy's, flattening the  Slayer's hand down so that it was merely resting on her stomach  instead of playing with it.  "Can I please have some of the blanket  now, or were you planning to molest me all morning too?" she  continued as Buffy tilted her head up to look at her.</p>

<p>"Molest?" the Slayer asked quirking an amused eyebrow at  Cordelia.  "That's funny.  Last night I could have sworn you were  saying `yes, YES'," she continued removing her hand from underneath  the brunette's and dragging the sheet up so that it covered the other  girl mid-section.</p>

<p>"At least I was saying it quietly," Cordelia responded a moment  later, a smile beginning to work it's way across her face as she  remembered what exactly it was that Buffy did to her to make her  agree so vigorously.  She supposed she shouldn't have been surprised  though, Buffy had demonstrated numerous times in the past that she  was in possession of an impressive amount of imagination.</p>

<p>"So what does this mean?" Buffy asked laying her head down on her  pillow and staring up at the ceiling.  She supposed that she should  have been feeling rather freaked out.  She had, after all, just slept  with another woman. Moreover, that other woman had been Cordelia  Chase of all people, Cordelia.  Yep, that was definitely material for  freaking out, yet she found that she was oddly calm.</p>

<p>"Couple more nights of good sleep?" Cordelia suggested, her eyes idly  roaming around Buffy's bedroom.  She could've addressed the question  on a deeper level, made it a poignant study about life, about love,  about loving in life and journey's in and love and a bunch of other  shit, but she didn't particularly feel like taking stock of how what  happened between them last night would effect her as a person or  whatever.  She wanted to concentrate on the fact that once she had  actually fallen asleep it had been a fitful one that she hadn't woken  from once.  She wanted to concentrate on the fact that just laying  there she felt more relaxed than she had since her first day as the  Pylean Queen.  She just wanted to concentrate on the fact that  whatever it was that happened, it was good.</p>

<p>"I can deal with that," Buffy responded turning her head to side so  that she was looking at the brunette.  "Yeah," she continued, "a  couple more good nights sleep," she went on hovering above Cordelia's  face as the woman turned to look at her.  "I can definitely deal with  that," and with that Buffy leaned down bringing their lips together  once more.  She couldn't remember the last time dealing had been this  much fun.</p>

<p>"What's your secret?" Willow asked making her way over to the table  where Cordelia was sitting.  The gang plus a Cordy and minus a Buffy  and Dawn were congregated as usual at the Magic Box, with a  cornucopia of books surrounding them.  Buffy had taken off for a  Parent-Teacher conference at Dawn's school which had left Cordelia  wondering around the house aimlessly until Willow had dragged her to  the shop to try and see if she could find anything in the texts about  the creature she had seen in her vision – even those Cordelia  insisted that she hadn't really seen anything.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Cordelia asked turning to face the redhead.  At the moment she  was desperately missing Wesley and Fred and their insane yet  effective research methods.  She had gotten out of practice and  didn't really care to get in practice again.  </p>

<p>"With Buffy," Willow clarified brushing an arrant strand of hair away  from her face.  "She's been talking to you," the redhead continued  her face falling slightly.  "She hasn't talked to me, not really, not  since…" she paused there, still not liking to think about what had  happened those few short months ago.  "What's your secret?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been here," Cordelia replied in a kind of half sigh after  a moment.  There was no secret really, Buffy wanted to talk, it would  have been impossible for her to not want to talk.  You just had to  ask her the right questions, the tough questions, and nobody but her  seemed to be willing to do it.  She knew they had to have figured it  out, Buffy was a stubborn jackass, she always had been, and if you  let her get away with saying nothing she would just keep on doing  it.  She knew they knew that and she also knew that they would never  be able to ask her, because making her talk about it would hurt her  before it would help her and they couldn't bear to do anything that  would hurt her.  "Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers."</p>

<p>"You're not exactly strangers," Willow responded turning her head to  the side to get a better look at the brunette.  Even when Cordelia  and the Scoobies actively hated each other so many years ago the  brunette could hardly have been referred to as a stranger.  Willow  knew that she certainly felt like she saw a lot of the brunette than  she cared to back in the day.</p>

<p>"True, nearly being eaten by evil snakes together, tends to bring  people closer," the brunette agreed with a rueful smile.  "But we  were hardly friends," she continued shaking her head  thoughtfully.  "Not like she was with you and Xander anyway."</p>

<p>Willow nodded in understanding, before letting out a loud  sigh.  "It's just that it's so…"</p>

<p>"Frustrating?  Irritating?  Makes you want to beat them with a shovel… ing?" Cordelia asked smirking at the redhead and her  expression.  "Don't' forget, I too know the friendship of a taciturn  avenger."</p>

<p>"Angel's like this too?" Willow asked though she wasn't really  surprised.  She heard that he had lightened up a bit, but with the  excessive brooding that he'd done in the past, him lightening up  would probably still have left him in the charcoal gray area of the  colour spectrum.</p>

<p>"I think he's the one she got it from," Cordelia answered shaking her  head.  The truth was that even though she was the one who brought him  up, she didn't really want to think about him at the moment, or at  any moments coming up.   The events of the night before were still  fresh in her mind, and even though she knew that Angel and Buffy were  forever more going to be a past tense, and even though she could semi- justify things by saying that she had no idea that anything like what  happened was going to happen…ever…in life, she was feeling slightly… what was that word…not quite the opposite of pride but close to it… guilty.  Yeah, she was feeling somewhat guilty and wanted to ignore  it.</p>

<p>"I just…I wanna see her happy, you know," Willow responded sighing  dramatically.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia responded.  She wanted the same thing.  "But you  can't gift wrap happiness and courier it to someone," she  continued.  "Buffy has to want it."</p>

<p>Willow nodded.  Cordelia wasn't saying anything that she hadn't  already thought of herself; it was just that the answer seemed to be  part of the problem.  "But Buffy hasn't seemed to want anything  lately," the witch finally replied in a despondent tone.  How could  wanting something be the answer to not wanting anything?  If someone  wanted something there would be no problem to begin with.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that," Cordelia replied with a droll tone,  not quite able to keep the huge smiley face she was making on the  inside stop from showing on the outside, as images of Buffy wanting  and taking came to her unbidden.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked not quite sure what to make of Cordelia's tone  or expression yet oddly encouraged by them nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Nothing," the brunette responded quickly straightening up in the  chair as she struggled to get her features back under  control.  "Sorry.   Yeah," she went on shifting in the chair  uncomfortably.  "So.  How's Amy?  Still a rat?"</p>
