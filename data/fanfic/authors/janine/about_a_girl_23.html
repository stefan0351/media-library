<!-- About a Girl \ Part 23 -->

<p><u><i>School – Two days later</i></u></p>

<p>"What can I say?" Katie asked shrugging playful as she and Jessie  backed away from Tad and a few other assembled people.  "Where goes  Jessie, so goes my nation," she continued which was met by a chorus  of whipping sounds being made.</p>

<p>"They're such punks," Katie commented once they were out of earshot  of the others.  </p>

<p>"You know you love them," Jessie replied smiling as Katie mock glared  at the memory.  Katie shrugged conceding Jessie's point.</p>

<p>"So, for what did I just get myself labeled P-whipped?" Katie asked  as they continued down the hall.  They'd all just been lounging  around when Jessie had whispered to her that she wanted to talk to  her alone, and now she found herself intensely curious as to what was  on her girlfriends mind.</p>

<p>"P-whipped?" Jessie asked ignoring Katie's question for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yep.  As far as everyone is concerned I am now officially the bottom  in this relationship," Katie replied.  "So this better be worth it."</p>

<p>"My moms leaving for some conference this afternoon and is gonna be  gone all weekend," Jessie began willing her hands to stop  shaking.  "So, I'll basically have the place all to myself," she went  on.  "I was thinking that you should come over."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie agreed instantly, thinking that some quality time ALONE  with Jessie couldn't be anything but of the good, already planning  for sappy movies and multiple snuggles.  "Sounds like good times."</p>

<p>"Okay," Jessie said realizing that she had made the right decision as  soon as Katie responded positively the moment she had finished  talking.  Katie had said that she'd been fine with waiting, but that  response had proven that she really didn't want to, because everyone  knew that when you got invited over to your significant others empty  house for the weekend it was equivalent to saying `let's have  sex'.  "How about seven-ish?" Jessie continued.</p>

<p>"I'll be there," Katie replied smiling at her seeing `Beaches' in  their future.  "Cause I simply refuse to be square."</p>

<p>"Oh that's not going to be a problem," Jessie muttered to herself, as  the weight of planning for this evening began to settle across her  shoulders.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked not quite being able to make out what Jessie had  said.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie replied.  "What do you have next?"</p>

<p><u><i>Karen's House – That Night</i></u></p>

<p>Katie flipped through Karen's cd collection with quite a bit of  interest as Jessie shuffled between running upstairs and downstairs.   She'd tried asking Jessie what she was doing and if she wanted any  help, but Jessie had repeatedly told her to just relax and she'd see  soon enough.  So, after a final finger wagging Katie had acquiesced  and began looking at Karen's cd's, which were actually quite  impressive as far as she was concerned.</p>

<p>"You're mom's got some great taste in music," Katie commented sensing  Jessie as she walked into the living room.</p>

<p>"You think?" Jessie asked not really in the mood to make small  talk.  "She'll be happy to hear that," she continued steering the  conversation away from anything that had to do with her mother.  "Why  don't you come upstairs, I want to show you something."</p>

<p>"Oh, field trip," Katie replied grinning at Jessie as she turned away  from the cd rack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Katie looked around the room in something close to awe.  There were  no lights on, but the room was softly lit by a dozen or so candles  strategically placed around the room, and in the background she could  hear the strings to some soft music playing, Sade or something like  that.  The room looked absolutely amazing, completely drenched in  atmosphere.  "Wow," she breathed out as Jessie slowly walked up to  her.  "This is incredib…" was all she managed to get out however,  because Jessie's lips soon came to cover hers swallowing whatever she  may have wanted to say, though truthfully the moment Jessie's lips  touched hers she hadn't wanted to say anything anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Katie arched into Jessie's touch as she felt her girlfriends hands  begin to sneak under her shirt and she brought their lips together  again.  The feelings that were cursing through her body were almost  overwhelming, everything that Jessie was doing to her just felt so  good that she almost couldn't stand it.  But there was something  wrong, even though everything in her body seemed to be feeling right  for like the first time ever, there was this shadow at the back of  her mind telling her that something wasn't right.  So finally,  wishing that she could kick her own ass for stopping what they were  doing, she pulled back from Jessie's lips stepping away from her to  put a little space between them.</p>

<p>"What's…what's going on here?" she said her voice coming out in short  gasps as she looked at Jessie, who's face was undetectable at the  moment, making her think that she was definitely right to stop things.</p>

<p>"I would think that's fairly obvious," Jessie replied stepping  towards Katie again.  </p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded watching Jessie closely.  "Everything's right  out of `Seduction 101'.  What isn't obvious is why you're doing this  when you clearly don't want to be," she continued still staring at  Jessie.  Jessie had been going through the motions, she'd been going  through them really well, but there had been no passion behind them.   She'd felt more raw affection from her girlfriend months ago when  they'd just sat at the foot of Jessie's bed staring at each other,  than she had moments ago.</p>

<p>"I don't see how anything I've done could be interpreted as not  wanting to," Jessie replied stepping closer, taking Katie's hands  into hers.  "This was my idea after all."  </p>

<p>"What changed?" Katie asked still uncertain.  She wanted nothing more  than to pick up where they'd left off, if Jessie truly wanted to, but  she didn't think that Jessie wanted to, and she couldn't, she  wouldn't go through with anything if that were the case.  She just  couldn't understand why Jessie would go to all of this trouble and  then be so vacant.</p>

<p>"Listen," Jessie said her voice rising a little as she realized that  Katie wasn't just going to let her get on with it.  "If you don't  want to sleep with me, just say so!"</p>

<p>"That's not it," Katie said reaching out for Jessie who'd pulled away  from her, not knowing how Jessie could possibly believe that that  could be anything that approached the truth.  "You're just … you're  not here with me," Katie continued.  "You say you want to, but it's  like your mind is somewhere else, like you're being forced into  something, and I don't understand why you should feel like that.  I  mean did I do something to make you think you had to do this, even if  you didn't want to?" Katie asked the mere implication that she may  have made Jessie feel pressured into sleeping with her before she was  ready cutting into her like a knife.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted this?" Jessie asked closing her eyes and making  them sting as she tried to contain her tears behind them.  "Do you  not need it anymore?"</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked now completely lost.  "I don't understand," she  continued trying to draw Jessie into a hug, but stopping when her  girlfriend resisted her pull.  "What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie muttered finally opening her eyes and moving around  Katie to turn on the lights, humiliation settling over her  uncomfortably, closely followed by extreme vulnerability.</p>

<p>"It's obviously not nothing," Katie said following Jessie to the  door, and touching her on the arm lightly.  "It's something, and I  want to know what."</p>

<p>Jessie let out a small humorless grunt of laughter and shrugged out  of Katie's grasp, her feelings of vulnerability putting her on the  defensive.  "You've been spending a lot of time with Sarah," she said  softly moving back towards the center of the room.</p>

<p>"Sarah?" Katie asked completely befuddled.  "What does Sarah have to  do with any …" she began to say before pausing as a thought struck  her.  "You think she's trying to steal me away from you," Katie said  softly, her eyes beginning to tear up as she glanced at Jessie whose  wandering eyes indirectly confirmed what she had said.  "By putting  out," she continued her voice rising incredulously.</p>

<p>"God Jessie!" she exclaimed a moment later as she realized what the  girl must have thinking, what was really going on.  "I'm not sleeping  with Sarah, I don't want to sleep with Sarah, and I never have," she  continued, her nostrils flaring slightly as she tried to keep control  of her temper, not wanting to say something she'd regret later.  "If  she was the last person on her earth, I'd rather dedicate my life to  the study of seashells than sleep with her," she went on.  "How can  you not know this?" she asked with more than a touch of exasperation  in her voice.  "How can you still not know that you're absolutely the  only person I ever think about?  I mean is it me?  Am I not telling  you how I feel enough so that you actually think you have to whore  yourself to me to get me to stay?" she asked running a head through  her hair and thus missing Jessie's wince at her accurate but painful  description of what she'd been trying to do.</p>

<p>"How many times do I have to tell you I don't care about the sex, I  care about you.  I want you, what's up here," Katie said touching her  head blinking away some tears that were stinging her eyes, "and in  here," she continued softly placing her hand over her heart.  "Not,"  she continued a moment later, "what's in your pants," she finished  bluntly shaking her head, as she wondered what it said about her,  about Jessie, about their relationship that they were even having  this conversation.  From that day in the attic, she'd given Jessie  all of the control and she'd continued by that prerogative always  letting Jessie be the first to start things, to kiss her, to tell her  mother about them, to ask her to the dance, to touch her in public  for the first time at school, and anything and everything else.  It  just boggled her mind that Jessie still didn't understand this,  didn't see that she had willingly given herself to her, that she  couldn't understand that she really loved her as much as she said she  did.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Jessie said reaching out for Katie only to have Katie  remove her hand from Jessie's.  "I wasn't thinking," she continued  starting to panic as she saw Katie begin to retreat into herself.  "I  was just so scared, that I might lose you … I wasn't, I didn't…"  Jessie finished trailing off lamely as she watched Katie watch her.   She'd screwed up royally, she was aware of that fact now.  All of her  fears and her concerns, they were just that, HER fears and concerns.   Nothing that she had worried about had even entered Katie's mind, and  her implication that they may have were now hurting Katie which was  something that she had never wanted to do.  She just couldn't have  fathomed that whatever she gave to Katie would've been enough, but  she was realizing that whether she could fathom it or not, it was the  truth.</p>

<p>Katie pressed the ball of her hand to the bridge of her nose wearily,  finally breaking the eye contact between her and Jessie.  She  believed her girlfriend when she said she was scared, and she could  clearly see that she was both upset and sorry, but she was also  upset, and confused and wondering how the hell all of this could have  happened.</p>

<p>"I know," Katie breathed out softly, finally dragging her hand away  from her face.  "But I have to go," she continued heading for the  door.  She needed some time alone, she had to think about things, and  try and sort out the jumbled mess of thoughts filling her head.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't go," Jessie said reaching out for her again, her voice  cracking as more tears slid down her face.  "Please."</p>

<p>Katie carefully placed her hand over top of Jessie's squeezing it  slightly before removing it from her arm.  "I think we both need some  time alone," she responded, wanting nothing more than to take Jessie  into her arms but knowing that she wouldn't be able to stand it if  she did.  "I'll call you tomorrow," and with that she walked out of  the bedroom door and headed for stairs, not once stopping to turn  back knowing that if she did it would break whatever was left of her  heart.</p>

<p>Jessie watched Katie's form disappear from sight, her eyes still  watering as she stood there in something close to shock.  She  couldn't quite comprehend what I had just happened, except to know  that somehow she had managed to screw things up to epic proportions.   They were supposed to have gotten closer tonight, as close as  possible, but instead she felt farther away from her girlfriend than  she had ever since they'd met.  </p>

<p>Stumbling back to her bed she sat down, just barely catching the edge  of it and placed her head in her hands.  God, what had she done?</p>
