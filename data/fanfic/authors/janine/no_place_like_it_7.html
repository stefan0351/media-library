<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 7 -->

<p><b>2002 - Evanston, Illinois</b></p>

<p>Katie felt the button to her jeans pop loose then
Jessie's hands on her hips slipping underneath to guide the material down. She
didn't know how Jessie planned to get them off or even if she planned to get them off
with the position they were in, but she decided to let Jessie worry about that as she
lifted her lips from where they had been attached to Jessie's neck up to her lips,
kissing her as she felt Jessie struggle with the material.</p>

<p>"Fucking jeans," Jessie muttered bitterly as she
pulled her mouth away from Katie, lowering her eyes to glare at the material in question.
"Fucking backseat."</p>

<p>"When did you become such a potty mouth?" Katie
asked playfully before raising her head up to look at Jessie's face, surprised to
find tears streaming down her cheeks. "Hey," she said her smile gone now
replaced with a look of concern as she reached up to wipe away the tear tracks marring
Jessie's feature.</p>

<p>"We need to switch," Jessie said a moment later,
turning her head to the side slightly to break the gaze Katie had initiated as she stroked
her face.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked still looking down at Jessie
concerned. She'd seen Jessie cry tears of happiness before and knew that these
weren't them.</p>

<p>"We should switch positions," Jessie said
beginning to struggle, trying to maneuver herself so that she would be propped up over
Katie.</p>

<p>"Billie," Katie said softly, placing an
ineffective hand on Jessie's shoulder to try and stop her from moving.
"Jessie," she repeated when the girl continued to try and move. "I think
we're just going to have to accept the fact, the movies lie and the backseat is
really no place to get some loving."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed, falling back against the seat of the car,
Katie was right of course. "Fine, let's drive somewhere," she said her eyes
flickering back up to Katie's.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Katie started to say, the word drawn
out in a protesting manner.</p>

<p>"I need to ..." Jessie began to reply knowing
where Katie was going with her statement and really, desperately not wanting to hear it.</p>

<p>"Jessie..." Katie started to say again,
shaking her head slightly. She knew that her girlfriend was being so adamant about this
because she was afraid of ...</p>

<p>"I don't want to lose you."</p>

<p>"I thought we had this talk already?" Katie said
focusing on Jessie once more, quirking an eyebrow at her for good measure.</p>

<p>"Don't," Jessie warned turning her head away
from Katie. She really couldn't deal with her girlfriends inappropriate sense of
humor at the moment.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Katie a moment later, her head
hanging down pathetically as the words came out of her mouth. "I'm sorry,"
she repeated seriously. She didn't mean to make inappropriate comments at the worst
possible time imaginable it just seemed to happen. Her mother said that used humor as a
defensive mechanism, and she was inclined to agree with her, the thing was that
didn't want to or need to be defended from Jessie. "There's a motel ten
minutes away from here."</p>

<p>"It's not the one your parents went to is
it?" Jessie asked smiling up at Katie.</p>

<p>"That could never be a possibility," Katie
replied. "And I should note that if you weren't so incredibly sexy that comment
would have totally ruined the moment," she continued making a face.</p>

<p>"Billie," Jessie said softly a moment later
drawing Katie's full attention back to her. "I love you," she continued
once she found those sparkling green eyes on her again. And with that she leaned up
bringing their lips together tenderly, another tear or two slipping free from behind her
eyelids.</p>

<p>"And I love you," Katie replied simply once they
pulled apart. "More than air," she went on dropping a quick kiss on
Jessie's lips. "More than summer," she said kissing Jessie again on the
cheek. "More than when daylight savings time gives us an extra hour of sleep,"
she continued kissing Jessie's nose this time. "More than anything in
existence," she finished bringing their lips together once more.</p>
