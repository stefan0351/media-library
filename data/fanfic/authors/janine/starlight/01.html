<p align=center>&#34;Star light,<br>
Star bright,<br>
I wish I may,<br>
I wish I might,<br>
Wish upon a star tonight&#34;</p>

<p>The old children's song ran through Buffy's mind as she lay motionless on
the ground staring up a the sky above her.  The stars were twinkling, they
looked mischievous, it was almost as if they were winking at her, laughing.
She hated them and wanted everyone to go out, wanted them to stop taunting
her and teasing her.  She wanted them to leave her alone, but she couldn't
stop staring at them, no matter how strong a constitution she thought she
had she just couldn't stop.</p>

<p>Idly she noticed that the longer she stared at the them the more her vision
was starting to blur.  The stars above her were starting to fuse together,
forming what seemed to be streams of white light to her tired eyes.</p>

<p>She felt light-headed.</p>

<p>The pain in her side had almost disappeared, she noted listlessly, but she
still couldn't move.  It was as if none of the signals her brain was sending
to the rest of her body weren't getting through.  The connections that told
her limbs to move and that told her body to hurt had been compromised,
broken.  She was broken.</p>

<p>She was paralyzed.  She was bleeding.  Her vision was going.  She was cold.</p>

<p>She was dying.</p>

<p>When she realized that her condition was worsening by the moment, that she
was dying, she almost laughed.  In fact she would have, if she could have.
It was just too un-fucking believable.  After everything that had happened
to her over the past five years, after all of the times she had averted the
apocalypse and saved the world from hundred year old demons, she was going
to die paralyzed, and alone in the middle of cemetery.</p>

<p>Finally, she reached a point where she could no longer see the stars above
her.  In fact she couldn't see anything.  Her world now totally consisted of
the dark and the thoughts in her head.  She was mildly disappointed.  She
realized now that she couldn't see them that she missed the stars, missed
their twinkle…even if they were winking at her and mocking her.  They had
keep her company.  But they were gone now.</p>

<p>In the night, in the dark, she found her thoughts always returning to one
thing.  One person actually.  Willow.  Her thoughts were almost entirely of
the Willow variety.  Willow smiling.  Willow laughing.  Willow with her
'resolve face' on.  Willow typing at her computer.  Willow lounging on her
bed.  Willow, Willow, Willow.  She wanted Willow to be there with her.  She
didn't want Willow to be part of the dying, but she wanted her there.  Every
time she thought about Willow not being there, she felt her heart constrict,
making it more difficult for her to breathe.  And it was already plenty
difficult.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, this has been an illuminating experience,&#34; Buffy thought to herself
as her head tilted to the side.   &#34;Five years, and I have to be on my death
bed before I admit it…mom was right, I AM a procrastinator.&#34;</p>

<p>She had always thought that when her number was finally called, she would go
quickly.  That just like everything else her life would be taken away from
her in one violent, passionate, all-consuming yank.  Over before she even
knew what was happening.  She should have known that it wouldn't have been
that easy though.  She should have known that she would go, like she lived.
Fighting valiantly to the end.  Nope, Buffy Summers didn't do anything the
easy way and she certainly wasn't going to start with her death.</p>

<p>The thing was that she had always assumed that those last moments before she
passed away would be filled with images from her distant past.  Stuff like
skating with her dad, and building sand castles on the beach.  And that
those things would be followed by images of being called by Merick, and of
meeting Xander, Giles, and Willow, and of fighting the good fight.  And
finally, she had thought there would be Angel.  His image hovering in her
mind like a guardian, carrying her over the threshold.</p>

<p>But it wasn't like that at all.</p>

<p>Yes, she thought about growing up.  Yes, she thought about being called,
burning down her old high school and moving to Sunnydale.  And yes, she
thought about Xander, and Giles and Angel.  But, it was Willow who she
thought of most.  Whom she saw in her mind watching over her.  And in this
state, where she had nothing left to lose, and more importantly nothing left
to fear, or protect, or hide, she had a epiphany.  It was to her, what the
apple was to Newton, and the light-bulb to Edison, and it struck her with a
such a force that she was almost certain it would have been enough to shock
her upright.</p>

<p>She loved Willow.  No, she was in love with Willow.  She was in love with
Willow.</p>

<p>Willow, her best friend, her confidant, her source, her strength.  Her love.
  She was in love with Willow.</p>

<p>The discovery was enough to make her cry, to make her wish that she had died
in the snap of finger like she had always envisioned.  It made her heart
constrict, and her breathing shallow, and her hands sweat.  Realizing that
she loved Willow made her hurt so much that she was sure she was going to
die of the pain, rather than from the injury she had received.</p>

<p>And the reason that it hurt so much?  Because she realized that Willow would
never know how she felt, how much she meant to her.  It hurt so much,
because she would never get to tell Willow, never get to hold her and love
her the way she now realized she had wanted to for a very long time.  It
hurt because her mind was filled with images of what could have been…what
should have been…and what would never be.  And it killed her all that much
faster.</p>

<p>&#34;My most stunning defeat, by not using my tongue,&#34; Buffy thought to herself,
twisting the words of Billy Shakespeare to apply to her situation, as her
eyes closed.  &#34;Ain't that a bitch.&#34;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Willow paced around the room, hands clasped behind her back with her head
bowed down.  She couldn't believe that this was happening, this wasn't
suppose to happen.  Alright, so really it was suppose to happen, and it had
been happening over and over again since the beginning of recorded history
and probably before that too, but it wasn't suppose to happen to Buffy.  Not
again.  Not so soon.  Buffy was different from the Slayers before her,
everyone who had ever met her said that.  She wasn't suppose to go down like
the rest of them, she was special.  She was suppose to live.</p>

<p>They-they being Willow, Xander, and Giles-had found Buffy lying in the
cemetery, barely breathing and unconscious four hours before.  They had to
assess her injuries on the scene which meant that Willow got the job of
checking Buffy's body for injuries.  She had felt around for broken bones,
and bruises and had been at a complete loss when she found nothing wrong,
then she found the rip in Buffy's shirt.  Lifting the end of the shirt up so
that she could see what was wrong, she spotted a tear of a puncture mark,
and coming out of the puncture mark were a series of nasty looking red
streaks fanning across Buffy stomach, and underneath her around to her back.
  The  mark had enflamed the entire left side of the Slayer's body, and her
skin was warm to touch.</p>

<p>It was a demon bite.  A bad one.</p>

<p>They knew that they couldn't take Buffy to the hospital with an injury like
this.  It would raise questions that they couldn't answer, not to mention
the fact that there was nothing the doctors could do for Buffy that they
couldn't do themselves.  So Giles had carefully lifted Buffy's limp body
into his arms and carried her to the car.</p>

<p>Off to Fort Giles they went.</p>

<p>Willow stopped pacing and closed her eyes.  The longer Buffy remained
unconscious the harder she found it to breathe.  She felt shut off, like she
was missing a part of her being.  An important part, and it made even the
simplest of functions difficult.  She tilted her head to look at the door
leading to Giles' bedroom where Buffy was resting.  As she stared at the
door she felt the tears that she had just managed to suppress emerging once
again.  Straining against her eyelids, burning her eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Giles asked looking up from his book as Willow headed
towards his bedroom.  He was trying to find the best way to treat Buffy's
injury by searching through a number of texts.  Unfortunately most of the
medical texts dealing with demons hadn't been transcribed to English, and
while Willow was supremely intelligent, she didn't read Latin.  In addition
to his research Giles had been watching her closely since they arrived at
his house.  He and Xander were quite concerned about Buffy's condition, but
it was affecting Willow in a much more intense way.  Giles had never seen
Willow so desolate, and after Oz's departure she had been quite depressed.
He was worried about her.  In fact he was just worried in general.</p>

<p>&#34;I need to be with her,&#34; Willow responded softly turning around to face the
older man.  She knew that she didn't need to say anymore.  Even if Giles
didn't completely understand, he wouldn't question her about this.  The
Watcher simply nodded, and Willow continued down the hallway.</p>

<p>Xander watched the exchange between Willow and Giles silently.  He had
nothing of import to interject, and he couldn't see anything humorous in the
situation to comment on so he remained silent.  He loved Buffy, he really
did.  He knew that he didn't have a chance with her romantically-that had
been made quite clear over the years-and he was happy with Anya, but he
still loved her.  He also knew that Willow loved Buffy too, that they had a
bond that he wasn't sure he would ever really understand, and he knew that
if Buffy lying in that room possibly dying was affecting him as much as it
was, it had to have been ten times as bad for Willow.</p>

<p>Willow opened the door to Giles' bedroom and closed it softly behind her.
The moment her eyes fell on Buffy's prone figure lying on the bed, so
peaceful and so lifeless at the same time the tears that she had barely been
containing began to fall, and she had to lean up against the door for
support.</p>

<p>After a moment Willow pushed herself away from the door and walked over to
the side of the bed taking a seat on the chair Giles had placed beside the
bed.  She had been given the task of changing Buffy into something more
comfortable.  The Slayer kept a couple spare change of clothes at Giles'
house…in case of an emergency.  It was an emergency.  It had almost killed
her seeing, and feeling Buffy so powerless, so helpless as she changed her.
Buffy was always so strong, so full of life and energy that seeing her lying
there inert had been devastating.</p>

<p>Willow reached over and picked up Buffy's hand holding it in her own, gently
stroking it with her thumb.  She had so many feelings welling up inside of
her, there was so much that she wanted to say, but she couldn't seem to find
any words that would convey the depths of her emotions, and her despair.
She felt so helpless.</p>

<p>&#34;I know that you can hear me,&#34; Willow said softly.  She had been sitting
there holding Buffy's hand for almost fifteen minutes before she began to
speak.  &#34;So I'm going to talk to you, and I'm probably going to babble…a
lot…not that there's anything new about that, since I am known for running
off at the mouth.  Not that my mouth actually sprints away from my body, I
just start talking and don't stop,&#34; Willow paused and smiled sadly.  &#34;See,
it's happening already.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You, ah…you gave us all a real scare there, it took Giles for ever to find
your pulse.  It was so surreal, I didn't even feel like I was in my body…it
was like being in some sort of nightmare, only I couldn't wake up and go to
you so that you could make it all better.  I thought that I was going to
have a heart attack…but it was probably just a stroke.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You look so peaceful.  Like you're just asleep or something.  I know that
this is probably the only night that you're likely to get eight full hours
sleep, but I'd really, really, appreciate it if you woke up.  I'd even bake
you cookies,&#34; Willow continued her voice cracking a little as the tears
started to stream down her face again.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm always up for cookies,&#34; Buffy responded in an almost inaudible voice as
she squeezed Willow's hand.  The movement was weak, but it was definitely
there.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Willow asked looking up at the Slayer's face.  Tears were cascading
down her face making it difficult for her to make out her friends features.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy said in the same soft voice, only this time her lips curved up
in a small voice.  &#34;I'd really like to see you, but my eyes aren't
co-operating,&#34; she continued coughing a bit.</p>

<p>&#34;Open them,&#34; Willow said suddenly wanting to see Buffy's eyes more than
anything else in the world.  You could see Buffy's soul in her eyes, strong
and gentle, and Willow wanted to look into them.  Wanted to look into Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;That's what they're aren't co-operating with,&#34; Buffy responded.  &#34;I tried
'open sesame', and 'abracadabra' and still, nothing.  I'm running out of
clichés.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How about hocus pocus?&#34; Willow suggested a small smile working it's way
across her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Hocus,&#34; Buffy said one eye slowly opening.  &#34;Pocus,&#34; she said as the other
eye opened as well.  &#34;I'm indebted to you Will, I never would have thought
of that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well,&#34;  Willow said shrugging.  &#34;It's kind of my area of expertise.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy smiled in response to Willow's answer, but the expression left her
face shortly after followed by a frown, and then a rhythmic shaking of her
body.  Her eyes closing as her body shuddered over and over again
uncontrollably.  A slight sheen covering her body through it all.</p>

<p>Willow stood up and leaned over Buffy when her body started to convulse.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said reaching out for her friend.  Placing her hands on
Buffy's shoulder she tried to hold the jerking Slayer still, but she soon
realized that her actions were foolish and stopped.  Even if she had been
able to keep Buffy still it wouldn't have been of any use.  &#34;Buffy,&#34; she
called again this time more urgently.</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>Willow back away from the bed, nearly tripping over the chair she had been
sitting on as she started to back up towards the door.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;Giles!&#34;  Willow called opening the door and tearing out into the hallway.
&#34;Giles!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Willow…what is it?&#34; Giles said meeting Willow by the kitchen.</p>

<p>Willow didn't respond verbally, she just looked nervously back in the
direction she had come from.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow,&#34; Giles said firmly placing a hand on her shoulder.  &#34;What's wrong?
Is it Buffy?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She's shaking,&#34; Willow responded snapping out of it.  &#34;Sweating and
shaking.  I couldn't stop her.  I called her name but she didn't respond.
Just shaking and sweating,&#34; Willow continued in a frantic state.</p>

<p>&#34;Wha…&#34; Giles started to say once Willow finished speaking, but he cut off
his own answer and headed down the hallway rapidly followed by Willow,
Xander, and in a distance fourth Spike.</p>

<p>When they entered the room Buffy was still shaking but less violently than
before.  Her skin had turned an unhealthy pallor and was almost gray in
colour.  She was moaning and tossing her head from side to side.</p>

<p>&#34;Dammit,&#34; Giles said moving over to the bed.  &#34;The poison…we didn't get it
all out.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow and Xander followed Giles to side of the bed, but once they got there
they realized they didn't know what they were suppose to do.</p>

<p>&#34;Look on the bright side,&#34; Spike commented from the doorway.  &#34;Maybe the
next Slayer will be taller.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;De-fanged or not, if you say anything remotely like that ever again I will
personally rip off a table leg and stab you in the heart,&#34; Xander said
turning around angrily.</p>

<p>&#34;There's no need to get hostile,&#34; Spike said glaring at Xander.  &#34;It's not
like this is a tragedy or anything.  It's just…what did that bloody monkey
call it…the circle of life.  Yeah, the circle of life.  This should be a
time of celebration, the dawning of a new era.  Out with old, in with the
new,&#34; he continued.</p>

<p>&#34;The Dagger of Gothar, it's mounted on my wall,&#34; Giles said ignoring Spike
for a moment and addressing Willow.  &#34;It's the right size and shape, it
should do.  I need to get it and place it on the stove to warm.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Right,&#34; Willow muttered softly before turning and heading out the room in a
near jog.</p>

<p>&#34;Xander, get the supply box, bring it in here,&#34; Giles said turning to the
remaining member of the gang.  &#34;And make sure that all of the windows are
closed,&#34; Giles added as an afterthought as he ran a nervous hand through his
hair.</p>

<p>&#34;What?  No job for Spike?&#34; the vampire asked after Xander pushed by him
roughly.  &#34;I'm hurt, wounded really.  I thought we friends,&#34; he continued
smirking.</p>

<p>Giles ripped his attention away from Buffy's struggling form and turned to
face Spike.  He stared at him for a moment, then in a lightening quick move
that would have impressed Buffy had she not been fighting for her life at
the moment, Giles was across the room and pressing Spike up against the
wall.</p>

<p>&#34;I hate to be the one to break the news to you, but we're not friends.
You're presence in tolerated, not desired, and it's barely tolerated at
that.  Now, you'll sit in the corner and you'll shut your bloody mouth or
there won't be enough of you left to fit in a Tupperware container.  Now,
have I made myself clear?&#34; Giles asked pressing Spike more firmly against
the wall for emphasis.</p>

<p>&#34;Bloody clear,&#34; Spike said in a somewhat strangled tone.  &#34;I said 'bloody
clear'!&#34; the vampire repeated when Giles didn't let him go.</p>

<p>Giles put Spike down and stared at him for a moment before finally turning
around and heading back to Buffy's side.  The Slayer had stopped shaking and
was now just lying on the bed prone, and sweating.</p>

<p>Willow and Xander arrived within moments of each other, both heading
straight for the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles,&#34; Willow said staring at Buffy's form.  &#34;What are we doing?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't realize how bed the bite was before.  I was negligent, more
concerned with getting her back here.  I didn't…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How about we do the self-loathing part of the assessment later, and get on
with healing now,&#34; Xander said cutting off Giles' self chastisement.</p>

<p>&#34;There's a salve in the kit, it should bring the poison the demon injected
into her to the surface.  Once we've got it there we can neutralize it,&#34;
Giles responded following Xander's suggestion.</p>

<p>&#34;Neutralize it?&#34; Willow asked her brows furrowing in confusion.  &#34;How…Giles
no…&#34; Willow said looking up at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Giles responded.  &#34;It's the only way.  If we leave the poison in
there for much longer we won't get a chance to drag it to the surface again,
and if it stays in there…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She dies,&#34; Xander said finishing Giles' sentence.</p>

<p>They stood in silence for a moment, each contemplating what they would have
to do in the next few minutes.</p>

<p>&#34;Xander check on the dagger, Willow get the salve and apply it,&#34; Giles said
disturbing the silence.</p>

<p>Willow moved over to the kit and searched through it quickly until she came
upon the salve that Giles said she was to apply.  Kneeling down beside the
bed Willow lifted up the end of Buffy shirt until the wound was revealed.
Carefully, Willow applied the salve to the wound, and then the area around
it.</p>

<p>&#34;What now?&#34; she asked looking up at Giles once she was done.</p>

<p>&#34;We wait,&#34; the watcher replied.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;And you're certain that all of the windows are closed?&#34;  Giles asked when
Xander arrived a few minutes later holding the red hot dagger with a couple
of oven mitts.</p>

<p>&#34;They're closed,&#34; Xander said soberly.</p>

<p>The next five minutes or so passed in a haze for all of them.  Xander handed
the mitts and the dagger over to Giles, then he and Willow leaned over the
bed and proceeded to hold Buffy down.  Giles then applied the burning dagger
to Buffy's side over top of the tear the demon had left in her skin.  As
soon as the dagger touched her flesh Buffy's eyes had popped open, and as
Giles applied it fully to her skin the Slayer let loose a horrific scream.
Then she quieted once Giles removed the dagger.  Then Giles applied the
dagger to her skin once again and Buffy screamed once more and started to
thrash around.  This process continued for around five minutes although it
seemed like five years to the occupants of the room.</p>

<p>Finally, when the wound was sealed and poison neutralized the gang moved
away from the bed, and sat down on the floor surrounding it.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Xander said after a few moments in a kind of half sigh.  &#34;This beat
the hell out of seeing Galaxy Quest.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Willow, please,&#34; Giles said looking down at the young redhead once again.</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow responded firmly not moving from her position.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Willow, I really…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Would it kill you to respond in complete sentences?&#34; Giles asked running a&nbsp;&nbsp;hand through his hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as he cared about the scoobs they were&nbsp;&nbsp;absolutely exasperating at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least he had managed to convince&nbsp;&nbsp;Xander to go home and get some rest.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, Giles it would actually kill me,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;So, no.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Giles said sighing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Let me know if you need anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Will do,&#34; the hacker responded before returning to her vigil.</p>

<p>Spike watched as Giles exited the room, then slipped out of the shadows and&nbsp;&nbsp;headed towards the room where the Slayer and hacker remained.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he&nbsp;&nbsp;reached the door he fully intended on entering, but something stopped him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead when he reached the door, he just stood there leaning against the&nbsp;&nbsp;frame and looked into the room.</p>

<p>Willow was hunched over in her chair holding Buffy's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd often&nbsp;&nbsp;wondered about the two of them, Willow more than Buffy as the Slayer was&nbsp;&nbsp;able to keep a tighter leash on her emotions than her friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd been&nbsp;&nbsp;walking the earth for just over two hundred years and during that time,&nbsp;&nbsp;especially after he died, he had a lot of time to observe the mortals.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn't because he particularly cared about them, or was curious about them,&nbsp;&nbsp;he just wanted to learn how to read them so that he could better manipulate&nbsp;&nbsp;and torture them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the decades he learned that he was very good at&nbsp;&nbsp;reading people, in fact he was certain he could have been a bloody good&nbsp;&nbsp;shrink.&nbsp;&nbsp;And although he couldn't torture or manipulate Buffy and Willow (at&nbsp;&nbsp;least not anymore) he still watched them.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something compelling,&nbsp;&nbsp;something special about the two of them-although if someone asked him he&nbsp;&nbsp;would never admit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, watching them almost made him wish he was&nbsp;&nbsp;still human…almost.</p>

<p>He shook his head and smirked darkly as he watched Willow smooth away a&nbsp;&nbsp;strand of Buffy hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chippies were in love with each other, but were&nbsp;&nbsp;to afraid to tell the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have had such fun&nbsp;&nbsp;with this if he was still a bad-ass vamp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months ago he would have&nbsp;&nbsp;milked this discovery for all it was worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, now that he had spent&nbsp;&nbsp;so much time around them and gotten their cooties he wouldn't even enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;room because he didn't want to disturb them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was enough to make him want&nbsp;&nbsp;to jump on a table leg.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, isn't this quaint,&#34; Spike drawled finally making it into the room.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Willow asked turning around to look at the Billy Idol&nbsp;&nbsp;clone.</p>

<p>&#34;Just paying my respects,&#34; Spike said coming to a stop beside her chair.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, and VIP is quality entertainment,&#34; Willow said turning away from him.</p>

<p>&#34;That's a bloody good show,&#34; Spike said looking down at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Is there a reason you're here?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Is there a reason any of us are here?&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, do any of us really know&nbsp;&nbsp;what we were put on the this planet for?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we did would we even be&nbsp;&nbsp;able to achieve it….&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy knows and does,&#34; Willow said cutting off his mock philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;diatribe.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well isn't she lucky,&#34; Spike said making a face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Buffy's brave and&nbsp;&nbsp;strong and courageous isn't she?&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes you really wonder why she'd waste&nbsp;&nbsp;her time on a sub-par witch who's as afraid of her own feelings as she is of&nbsp;&nbsp;her shadow, doesn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp;It sure makes me wonder.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I only did that once,&#34; Willow said in response to the shadow comment.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm so sure,&#34; Spike responded rolling his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;You're just trying to annoy me,&#34; Willow said tilting her head up to peer at&nbsp;&nbsp;the vampire.</p>

<p>&#34;You're right, I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't mean that I'm wrong.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wrong about what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;About you…being afraid of your own insignificant emotions.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not afraid of my own emotions, in fact I'm very in touch with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;fact right now they're telling me that I don't like you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Really, then why don't you just tell her…if you're not afraid that is?&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spike challenged.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you insane?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, yeah,&#34; Spike answered sarcastically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Where have you been for the last&nbsp;&nbsp;three years?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Alright, I'll admit it was a stupid question,&#34; Willow acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;But&nbsp;&nbsp;in my defense it was an excited utterance.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'll bet you were excited,&#34; Spike commented lecherously.</p>

<p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Willow asked finally turning around to peer at&nbsp;&nbsp;the vampire.</p>

<p>&#34;You and the brave little tank engine,&#34; Spike said casting a look in Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;You're obviously hot for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She makes you randy doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;she?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I am NOT, I repeat…emphatically…NOT hot for Buffy,&#34; Willow said her voice&nbsp;&nbsp;rising defensively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;And…who say's 'randy' anyway…you stupid-head.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhh, that was convincing,&#34; Spike said in a voice that oozed sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; Willow said turning away from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wasn't sure what she was&nbsp;&nbsp;more upset about, Spike being right about her feelings for Buffy, or Spike&nbsp;&nbsp;disturbing the silence?&nbsp;&nbsp;It was probably an equal combination.</p>

<p>&#34;She's really got your digits, huh?&#34; Spike asked with an obnoxious grin.</p>

<p>&#34;You want you know about digits?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll show you a digit,&#34; Willow responded&nbsp;&nbsp;flipping Spike the bird.</p>

<p>&#34;The cat has claws,&#34; Spike responded making a clawing motion with his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;and growling suggestively.</p>

<p>&#34;Have you ever heard the expression 'three's a crowd'?&#34; Willow asked turning&nbsp;&nbsp;around irritably.</p>

<p>&#34;Have you heard the expression 'I don't give a flying fuck'?&#34; Spike&nbsp;&nbsp;responded.</p>

<p>Willow didn't responded and Spike bounced on the balls of his feet for a&nbsp;&nbsp;moment observing Willow and the Slayer, smiling.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, you can stick up all the fingers you like, but you know that I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;right.&nbsp;&nbsp;You're in love with the Slayer,&#34; he said gleefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;How&nbsp;&nbsp;staggeringly pathetic,&#34; he went on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If I were you I'd get my jollies while&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, because even Buffy's not stupid enough to blind to your feelings for&nbsp;&nbsp;her for much longer…and once she wises up…well, let's just say you'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;begging to have you sidekick status back.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're wrong,&#34; Willow said softly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Buffy's my best friend…nothing will&nbsp;&nbsp;come between us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're stronger than that,&#34; Willow said not sure if she was&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to convince Spike or herself.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing except for the fact that you want to jump her bones,&#34; the vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If you don't think wanting to engage in sexual congress with&nbsp;&nbsp;your best friend is going to cause anything but total fall out, you're&nbsp;&nbsp;stupider than Xander looks.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Like you would know anything about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't even have a heart, how do&nbsp;&nbsp;you expect to know how those of us whose hearts still beat will feel?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know because you know,&#34; Spike responded smugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If you really believed&nbsp;&nbsp;all of this 'unconditional friendship' crap that you've been preaching you&nbsp;&nbsp;would have told her already.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that you sit here in the dark holding&nbsp;&nbsp;her hand when she's unconscious because you know it's the only way you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;ever be able to do it tells me everything that I need to know.&#34;</p>

<p>Spike watched as the hacker dropped her gaze and stared at her shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;Merry wallowing,&#34; the vampire said in closing, then he walked out the door.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy slowly become aware of her surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;One sound, one smell, one&nbsp;&nbsp;touch at a time she slowly came back into herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The room smelled vaguely&nbsp;&nbsp;of herbs, it was a combination of hospital smell and the Magic shop, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn't her olfactory senses that were primarily engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;What she was&nbsp;&nbsp;almost hyper-naturally aware of was the hand on hers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently tracing&nbsp;&nbsp;patterns on her skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in her barely conscious state she knew that the&nbsp;&nbsp;hands belonged to Willow and it caused her heart to flood with warmth.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, there's a law against molesting the unconscious,&#34; Buffy said&nbsp;&nbsp;smiling as she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;I wasn't…&#34; Willow said pulling her hand away quickly.</p>

<p>&#34;It was a joke Will, granted it wasn't a very good one, but I'm not exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;at my peak right now,&#34; Buffy responded cutting Willow off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;it wasn't a bad way to wake up…and believe me I know for I have woken up a&nbsp;&nbsp;number of bad ways.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;How do you feel?&#34; Willow asked leaning forward slightly, but not touching&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation that she had with Spike was still playing through&nbsp;&nbsp;her head like a broken record that she couldn't shut off.</p>

<p>&#34;I've been better,&#34; Buffy responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I've been worse.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're being vague,&#34; Willow responded gently.</p>

<p>&#34;Hurt and I are very close friends right now,&#34; Buffy said smiling a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;I don't really like Hurt though…she's a bit of a wise-ass.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Hurts bad,&#34; Willow agreed.</p>

<p>&#34;Very bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurt needs a cap in her ass like nobody's business,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;responded grinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;How are you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm not the one with the demon bite,&#34; Willow responded meeting Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;True enough, but you are the one who looks like she hasn't sleep since the&nbsp;&nbsp;reign of Louis XIV,&#34; Buffy responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in her weakened state the worry&nbsp;&nbsp;in her voice was clear.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm okay,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I…I've just been worried about you…you&nbsp;&nbsp;looked so pale Buffy, I was so worried we didn't know what to do and…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Shhh,&#34; Buffy said reaching out and grasping Willow's hand which was&nbsp;&nbsp;thankfully near by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's all right now, no 'if's', 'ands', or&nbsp;&nbsp;'buts'&nbsp;&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all roses.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Roses?&#34; Willow asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Red, yellow…what ever kind you want,&#34; Buffy responded smiling.</p>

<p>A few moments later Willow noticed Buffy's eyes close briefly and saw a&nbsp;&nbsp;shudder run through her body.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah…it's okay,&#34; Buffy answered quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I'm just cold,&#34; she added&nbsp;&nbsp;softly.</p>

<p>Willow started to stand up.</p>

<p>&#34;What?!&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going?!&#34; Buffy asked trying to maintain the weak hold&nbsp;&nbsp;she had on Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm going to get you another blanket,&#34; Willow said looking down at Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;I'll be right back, it'll be okay.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, Will, just stay…I don't need…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, yes you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt that shudder run through your body, and you told&nbsp;&nbsp;me yourself you were cold.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I…there's…listen, I don't need a blanket…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, wait, just hear me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I…I'll be alright if you just…if you come lie&nbsp;&nbsp;down with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Body heat's the best heat…or so the saying goes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, really the linen closet is just down the hall,&#34; Willow said looking&nbsp;&nbsp;at the door.</p>

<p>&#34;I…Will…I don't want to be alone, can you understand that?&#34; Buffy asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willow nodded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Can you…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;No 'ifs', 'ands', or 'buts' about it,&#34; she&nbsp;&nbsp;continued smiling as she moved around the other side of the bed to slip in&nbsp;&nbsp;beside Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Buffy said softly once Willow had settled in beside her.</p>

<p>&#34;There's no need for thanks…I'm glad to be of service,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, then I'm glad to have you in my service,&#34; Buffy said softly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Don't&nbsp;&nbsp;take this as an affront but I'm probably going to fall asleep very, very,&nbsp;&nbsp;soon.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No 'fronts' will be taken…Scouts honor,&#34; Willow said.</p>

<p>&#34;You were never a Scout,&#34; Buffy said through a yawn.</p>

<p>&#34;True…but my heart was in the right place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you comfortable?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Despite all reason, yeah,&#34; Buffy responded soaking in Willow's warmth and&nbsp;&nbsp;the feel of her friends body pressed up against her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Definitely a yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>The morning sun was streaming in through the open curtains causing Buffy to&nbsp;&nbsp;blink her eyes repeatedly as she attempted to watch the figure snuggled up&nbsp;&nbsp;beside her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willow's head was resting on her shoulder, and one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;hacker's legs was thrown over hers causing Willow to lean into her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her&nbsp;&nbsp;friend was still very much asleep, but Buffy could just barely detect a&nbsp;&nbsp;curvature at the edge of Willow's lips, confirming her suspicion that&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow's was a 'good' very much asleep sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy was very much aware of&nbsp;&nbsp;the injury that she had suffered the night before, but the pain was nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;near where it had been before.&nbsp;&nbsp;One the few perks of being a Slayer, Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;supposed.</p>

<p>&#34;Mmmm.&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy looked down at the head nestled on her shoulder when she&nbsp;&nbsp;heard Willow moan and tighten her hold on the Slayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked like&nbsp;&nbsp;somebody was just about ready to wake up, and Buffy was glad.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;that she didn't enjoy lying there holding Willow, but she really wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;see the girl without being in a state of monumental pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Monumental pain&nbsp;&nbsp;had a tendency to dull one's senses, and Buffy wanted all of her senses at&nbsp;&nbsp;peak operating capacity.</p>

<p>&#34;That was almost a word,&#34; Buffy drawled when she saw Willow start to blink.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;What you need know are some vowels.&nbsp;&nbsp;A, E, I, O, and it's time U woke up.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wha…&#34; Willow muttered wiping at her eyes and blinking groggily.</p>

<p>&#34;That was better, let's try for two syllables next time,&#34; Buffy responded&nbsp;&nbsp;smiling at Willow's not entirely successful effort to wake up.</p>

<p>&#34;Where am I?&#34; Willow asked huskily before raising her head only to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy's face which was about an inch from her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Wha…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do you some sort of aversion to 'T's'?&#34; Buffy asked her brows drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;together curiously.</p>

<p>&#34;Wh…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't go there,&#34; Buffy said cutting Willow off.</p>

<p>&#34;Go where?&#34; Willow asked backing off of Buffy a little.</p>

<p>&#34;I never noticed how completely out of it you are in the morning,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;said watching as Willow settled down again, this time on her own side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's…&#34; Buffy stopped and reconsidered her choice of words.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;Charming.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I'm glad you think so because I have absolutely no idea what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;talking about,&#34; Willow responded finally fully conscious.</p>

<p>&#34;Alright, let's see here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I don't know what.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we're at&nbsp;&nbsp;Giles' house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, don't go saying 'what?' again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that about&nbsp;&nbsp;sums it up,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>Willow was quiet for a moment and Buffy knew that she was trying to match&nbsp;&nbsp;her responses to the questions that had been asked earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she knew&nbsp;&nbsp;from the look on Willow's face that she wasn't being at all successful.</p>

<p>&#34;Your chipper,&#34; Willow said finally deciding that de-coding the Slayer's&nbsp;&nbsp;response wasn't worth the effort.</p>

<p>&#34;No, I'm Buf-fy,&#34; Buffy responded sounding out her name phonetically.</p>

<p>Willow frowned at the sardonic response, but Buffy could tell that she was&nbsp;&nbsp;amused by the way the corner of her lip twitched.&nbsp;&nbsp;The twitching was a&nbsp;&nbsp;result of trying to suppress a smile, and Buffy knew it.</p>

<p>&#34;You're obviously feeling better,&#34; Willow responded the smile finally making&nbsp;&nbsp;its way across her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Yep, better and I are like two pigs in a blanket,&#34; Buffy told her shifting&nbsp;&nbsp;her position carefully so that she was directly facing Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;How's your side?&#34; Willow asked raking her eyes over what was visible of&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy knew that her friend's extensive searching of her body&nbsp;&nbsp;was due to purely platonic concern, but she felt her body begin to stir and&nbsp;&nbsp;decided that the wisest course of action would what she like to call the&nbsp;&nbsp;'make her stop that right now' defense.</p>

<p>&#34;It's definitely better than last night,&#34; Buffy said drawing Willow's&nbsp;&nbsp;attention back to her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Which is not to say that it's entirely of the&nbsp;&nbsp;good,&#34; she continued not bothering with her usual 'I am woman here me roar'&nbsp;&nbsp;strength routine.</p>

<p>&#34;Are there any side affects?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Not that I can tell,&#34; Buffy responded thoughtfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;But all I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;doing is lying here, so it's kind of hard to tell.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Let me take a look at it,&#34; Willow ordered softly.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Bu…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Now who has an aversion to 'T's'?&#34; Willow asked smiling.</p>

<p>&#34;I thought you didn't hear any of that,&#34; Buffy said stalling.</p>

<p>&#34;Quit stalling,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't move an inch.</p>

<p>&#34;It's nothing I haven't seen before,&#34; Willow commented when she realized&nbsp;&nbsp;that Buffy was holding up out of respect to some sort of modesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;Slayer raised an eyebrow at that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was true that Willow had seen her at&nbsp;&nbsp;various stages of undress, but she was certain the area that Willow needed&nbsp;&nbsp;to check was going to far surpass those past stages.</p>

<p>&#34;How do you think you got into those clothes?&#34; Willow asked holding Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;gaze under the Slayer looked down at her body for what Willow assumed was&nbsp;&nbsp;the first time since waking up because of the surprised look on her face&nbsp;&nbsp;when she saw what she was wearing.</p>

<p>&#34;Transporter?&#34; Buffy asked looking up once again.</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;No Scottish men from space had anything to do&nbsp;&nbsp;with it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, then I guess resistance is futile,&#34; Buffy said leaning back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Go&nbsp;&nbsp;ahead.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow reached over slowly and grasped the edge of Buffy's shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting&nbsp;&nbsp;up the edge of it she carefully raised the shirt revealing Buffy's abdomen.&nbsp;&nbsp; She gasped.</p>

<p>&#34;I've gotta tell you Will, that is not a confidence inspiring sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;like the complete opposite actually.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;There's just some…inflammation,&#34; Willow responded in what she hoped was a&nbsp;&nbsp;confidant voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;She really couldn't help the gasp, she was surprised when&nbsp;&nbsp;she saw what had happened to Buffy's side over the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut itself&nbsp;&nbsp;was healing nicely, but the skin around it, and dipping down into Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;waist band was an angry red colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't the like the night before,&nbsp;&nbsp;the skin wasn't warm to the touch, and marks weren't the jagged lines they&nbsp;&nbsp;had been, there were just these intensely red patches spread out over the&nbsp;&nbsp;skin of Buffy's left side.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you sure?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if you're saying that just to comfort me I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;to have to get really, really worried,&#34; Buffy responded looking down at&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow who had put on her poker face.</p>

<p>&#34;Does this hurt?&#34; Willow asked gently touching one of the red patches.</p>

<p>&#34;Stop that,&#34; Buffy said grasping Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Did it hurt?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Then what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It tickled.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Now what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I have to see how far down the rash goes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Rash?&nbsp;&nbsp;What rash?&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn't say anything about a rash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has a rash?&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#34;I meant the inflammation.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But you said rash, which is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's…the redness?&#34; Willow answered though it was really more of a question.</p>

<p>&#34;Redness?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Redness.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What about the…redness, again?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I have to check to see how far down it goes,&#34; Willow reiterated.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Buffy responded realizing the implications of what Willow had just&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Then by all means…be my guest.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy knew that her breathing had quickened and tried to calm down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;had just pulled down the waistband of the jogging pants she was wearing, and&nbsp;&nbsp;was now lowering the pants to her ankles.&nbsp;&nbsp;She could see her abdominal&nbsp;&nbsp;muscles quivering, and hoped that Willow wasn't as perceptive to her bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;reactions as she was, cause if she was Buffy knew that she would, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;words of Ricky Ricardo, 'have some 'splaining to do'.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, usually someone has to be cursed for eternity, or buy me dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;before they get into my pants,&#34; Buffy joked awkwardly, hoping that it would&nbsp;&nbsp;at least take some of her focus away from where Willow's head was.</p>

<p>Willow looked up at her wide-eyed.</p>

<p>&#34;Joke, it was a joke,&#34; Buffy said quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I just meant that one could&nbsp;&nbsp;take advantage of a situation like this, erotically as it were,&#34; she&nbsp;&nbsp;continued cursing every syllable that came out of her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Not that I&nbsp;&nbsp;think you would…or that…I was just…making conversation,&#34; Buffy finished&nbsp;&nbsp;lamely.&nbsp;&nbsp;'That went well,' she thought to herself snidely.</p>

<p>Willow blinked.</p>

<p>&#34;I like cheese,&#34; Buffy said at a loss for what else to say.</p>

<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Willow responded finally snapping out of whatever trance she had&nbsp;&nbsp;been in during Buffy's little mind fart, and the Slayer was grateful to have&nbsp;&nbsp;the bright doe-like eyes off of her for the time being.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Buffy didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;know was that Willow had been thinking the same thing about her position,&nbsp;&nbsp;and her thoughts had taken the 'erotically as it were' path.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been&nbsp;&nbsp;still more out of fear that she had been busted, than out of shock from what&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had said.</p>

<p>&#34;How's it look?&#34; Buffy asked desperately needing a return to the status quo.</p>

<p>&#34;The 'redness' continues down your leg to about mid-thigh but it stops&nbsp;&nbsp;there,&#34; Willow responded pulling Buffy's jogging pants back up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's&nbsp;&nbsp;probably just a reaction, either to the bite or to the…treatment,&#34; Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;continued shuddering a little at the memory of the way they had to treat&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy's wound.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;That's good.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded moving back over to her side of the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you hungry?&#34; Buffy asked a minute later.&nbsp;&nbsp;They needed to get out of&nbsp;&nbsp;this room, or more specifically out of the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded quickly, perhaps too quickly.</p>

<p>&#34;Let's get some grub then…and I've got dibs on the blueberry scones,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;said.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to her as if they ended up calling 'shotgun' for just about&nbsp;&nbsp;everything in their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it sucked to be young.</p>

<p>&#34;You always get the scones,&#34; Willow said pouting.</p>

<p>&#34;That's because I've got the stones,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked looking up at her quizzically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know exactly,&#34; Buffy said with a thoughtful expression on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Oh well, race ya!&#34;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy blinked as she tried to wrap her mind around the events of the past&nbsp;&nbsp;few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had said 'race ya' to Willow, then she had flung her legs&nbsp;&nbsp;over the edge of the bed with every intention of racing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she was&nbsp;&nbsp;lying on the floor eating carpet-literally.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said coming around the bed to kneel by her friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Are you&nbsp;&nbsp;alright?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think not,&#34; Buffy said pushing herself up into a sitting position.</p>

<p>&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I wish I knew,&#34; Buffy responded softly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something wasn't right, she&nbsp;&nbsp;could feel it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in her body was off somehow.</p>

<p>&#34;Here,&#34; Willow said offering her hand to Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Let me help.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy grasped Willow's hand and allowed her friend to try and pull her up.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm gonna need a little help here,&#34; Willow said when she began realized she&nbsp;&nbsp;was meeting resistance from Buffy's end.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow, stop,&#34; Buffy said quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;You just have to…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, just stop, it's not going to work,&#34; Buffy responded trying to hold back&nbsp;&nbsp;the bile building in her throat.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, Will I can't move my legs,&#34; Buffy said cutting off the hacker once&nbsp;&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't move my legs, Will.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't move my legs.&#34;</p>

<p>Giles remained in the room for a few moments after Willow exited the room&nbsp;&nbsp;and continued to stare at the small figure that lay on his bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had&nbsp;&nbsp;said very little since Willow had come to get him, leaving the hacker to do&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had spoken when she was spoken too, but had&nbsp;&nbsp;volunteered little more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;She now lay on the bed completely still&nbsp;&nbsp;staring at the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Giles sighed, then backed out of the room.</p>

<p>In Sunnydale, when it rained a monsoon was sure to follow.</p>

<p>&#34;We're got to find the demon,&#34; Willow said the moment Giles entered the&nbsp;&nbsp;common room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Xander had arrived while Giles was still in with Buffy and was&nbsp;&nbsp;standing slightly behind Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;We've got to calm down,&#34; Giles said taking his glasses off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;We can't go&nbsp;&nbsp;rushing into anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nobody's rushing, we're taking tiny little baby steps here G-man.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's&nbsp;&nbsp;just that the solution isn't exactly playing hide and seek with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;fact, it's pretty damn simple, we find the demon,&#34; Xander responded moving&nbsp;&nbsp;in front of Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;That's not simple, that's suicidal,&#34; Giles responded in a more commanding&nbsp;&nbsp;tone than they had heard him use in a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If the beast was easily&nbsp;&nbsp;killed we wouldn't be having his conversation, not mention that demons&nbsp;&nbsp;aren't exactly know to be particularly so-operative.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What we always do,&#34; Giles responded sighing.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had thought that the&nbsp;&nbsp;answer was fairly obvious.</p>

<p>&#34;I've got musty texts letters A-E,&#34; Xander called moving over to their&nbsp;&nbsp;make-shift study area, otherwise known as the couch.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow,&#34; Giles said turning to face the red-head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I need you to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy and try to get a description of what attacked her, and any other&nbsp;&nbsp;relevant information.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Giles, she's…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know Willow,&#34; Giles said wearily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the longer we wait, the&nbsp;&nbsp;more her chances for recovery diminish.&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to move quickly.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow merely nodded and started the walk back to the bedroom.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy's head was turned away from the door, towards the window, and from her&nbsp;&nbsp;position by the door Willow could only make out have of the Slayer's face.&nbsp;&nbsp; The part that she could see, however, held her captive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale light of&nbsp;&nbsp;the moon shone through the open window illuminating Buffy's face.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;thought to herself, that lying there Buffy was the most beautiful and tragic&nbsp;&nbsp;sight that she had ever seen in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying there she looked like a&nbsp;&nbsp;painting by some French artist from the Rocco period-dreamlike, vulnerable,&nbsp;&nbsp;strong, mysterious, beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;A vision that left the viewer mesmerized and&nbsp;&nbsp;wondering what exactly was going on inside of that beautiful, tragic mind to&nbsp;&nbsp;produce such a picture of longing and loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching her, lying there&nbsp;&nbsp;looking so small, Willow felt a tear work it's way down her face for what&nbsp;&nbsp;had to have been the thousandth time that day, and like those other times&nbsp;&nbsp;she reached up and brushed it away, resolving not to let another fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;because she had to be strong-she, Giles, and Xander-they had to be strong&nbsp;&nbsp;for Buffy.</p>

<p>She made her way to the side of Buffy's bed as quietly as possible-though&nbsp;&nbsp;she knew the effort was folly since Buffy was certainly aware of her&nbsp;&nbsp;presence the moment she appeared in the doorway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And while Willow knew all&nbsp;&nbsp;of this she still proceeded stealthily, mot wanting to disturb the quiet or&nbsp;&nbsp;break the peace.</p>

<p>She stood by Buffy's bedside for a moment before reaching out ant gently&nbsp;&nbsp;placing a hand on her friend's shoulder.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm back,&#34; Willow said softly, even though she was aware of the banality of&nbsp;&nbsp;the statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been in and out of the room all day alternating&nbsp;&nbsp;between spending time with Buffy and helping with the research.</p>

<p>&#34;I gathered,&#34; Buffy responded turning her around, finally, to face Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;We…the…Giles is out getting the…thing,&#34; Willow said searching for a gentle&nbsp;&nbsp;term for it, &#34;so we should be able to get you out of here by morning,&#34; she&nbsp;&nbsp;continued looking at the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would have found Willow's vagueness&nbsp;&nbsp;confusing, but Buffy had been around the hacker long enough to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;decipher her babblings anytime or anyplace.</p>

<p>&#34;Is he going to Kramer me, or am I actually going to get one with a joystick&nbsp;&nbsp;and all those other do-dad's?&#34; Buffy asked a small, tortured, smile working&nbsp;&nbsp;it's way across her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was after all taking about the appropriation&nbsp;&nbsp;of her wheelchair.</p>

<p>&#34;State of the art, I'm pretty sure you could even launch rockets with this&nbsp;&nbsp;baby,&#34; Willow responded with a like expression on her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Rockets, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have settled for Tetris, but rockets are cool too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure blowing up vampires makes them just as dead as staking them,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah…but littering,&#34; Willow responded, her lips curving up in an&nbsp;&nbsp;unconsciously erotic way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy licked her lips.</p>

<p>&#34;That's what we have convicts for,&#34; the Slayer responded dryly before&nbsp;&nbsp;turning her face back towards the window allowing Willow to observe her&nbsp;&nbsp;freely.</p>

<p>Willow-standing there in those moments watching Buffy in the&nbsp;&nbsp;moonlight-realized what had been bothering her about her friends behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;the past day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy was perhaps the most passionate person Willow had ever&nbsp;&nbsp;met and could ever expect to meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sparkly in Buffy's eyes, and&nbsp;&nbsp;an energy that coursed through her and pulsed off of her in waves spilling&nbsp;&nbsp;onto those in her presence, warming them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even in her darkest hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;when lesser people would give up and stop fighting, choosing instead to&nbsp;&nbsp;allow the waves to wash over them, Buffy remained strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;her step would falter, and her fears would rise, but despite that all she&nbsp;&nbsp;would go on.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her there was the heart of a warrior, and it made her fight&nbsp;&nbsp;the good fight, and fight it well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly being a member of the&nbsp;&nbsp;generation she was of, and being a member of the age group she was off,&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a jaded cynicism in Buffy, a kind of sarcastic pessimism about&nbsp;&nbsp;her, but Willow knew that those things were an asset, not a fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;knew that a person without Buffy's sardonic sensibilities could not possibly&nbsp;&nbsp;have existed in the world Buffy occupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;To an untrained-or&nbsp;&nbsp;uncaring-person Buffy could seem cocky, but Willow knew that what they&nbsp;&nbsp;perceived as cockiness was in fact simply confidence, heightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had&nbsp;&nbsp;to go into every fight believing that she was to be the victor, or else she&nbsp;&nbsp;would not come out of the fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that defiance, that believe in&nbsp;&nbsp;self, that love of life, that caused that spark in Buffy's eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;would die anyway but her way, and if you messed with that she'd knock you&nbsp;&nbsp;down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaying, Willow came to realize in those moments, was the only thing&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy believed in absolutely.&nbsp;&nbsp;That in those dark days it was slaying that&nbsp;&nbsp;both cause and salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaying was to Buffy what taxes are to the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;of humanity, the only constant in life other than death.</p>

<p>During that day Willow had seen that spark in Buffy's eyes flicker and&nbsp;&nbsp;falter as if it wised to go burn out.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had sensed the horsemen closing&nbsp;&nbsp;in her friend's soul, galloping with their swords raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she realized&nbsp;&nbsp;that Buffy was afloat, unfettered from the one thing she had thought&nbsp;&nbsp;unfetterable, slaying.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a jarring suddenness Willow realized what it&nbsp;&nbsp;was Buffy needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;She needed an anchor, she needed something else to&nbsp;&nbsp;believe in.&nbsp;&nbsp;But who or what would have such audacity to think that they&nbsp;&nbsp;could replace slaying in a Slayer's life?</p>

<p>&#34;Willow?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy's voice broke the hacker out of her musings.</p>

<p>&#34;What? Yeah?&#34; Willow asked blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>&#34;Have a nice trip?&#34; Buffy asked watching her carefully.</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a thought and it ran away,&#34; Willow responded trying to shake&nbsp;&nbsp;off the lingering effects of her musings.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you going back to the dorm when Giles gets back?&#34; Buffy asked in a&nbsp;&nbsp;carefully measured tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing she wanted to do was reveal how&nbsp;&nbsp;truly anxious she was at the thought of Willow not being around her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;&nbsp;didn't want to guilt Willow into staying.</p>

<p>&#34;I…Giles when we talked earlier, I asked and he was fine with, I mean he&nbsp;&nbsp;said I could stay…if that's what you wanted…but I think that I should…I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;we both think that staying would be good because of aloneness being&nbsp;&nbsp;bad…which is why…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Will?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I want,&#34; Buffy responded smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Wasn't really looking forward to the&nbsp;&nbsp;aloneness anyway,&#34; Buffy continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;And you are without a doubt my&nbsp;&nbsp;favorite person to not be alone with.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow smiled.</p>

<p>The moment Willow had settled herself into the bed Buffy moved closer to&nbsp;&nbsp;her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not close enough to touch, but within a sufficient distance to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;to fell each others warmth.&nbsp;&nbsp;She-of course-wanted to do more, wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;reach out and pull Willow into her body and shower her face in sweet little&nbsp;&nbsp;kisses until they were both trembling.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she-of course-wanted to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;the deepest secrets of her soul and let all of the emotions that welled in&nbsp;&nbsp;her as she lay on the cold cemetery ground, while watching the distant stars&nbsp;&nbsp;mocking her, be known.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to tell Willow that she loved her.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;the words of the poet and with the actions of a lover, she wanted to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;her love.&nbsp;&nbsp;So she did the only thing she could do.&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;paused, then asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Comfy?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Snug as a bug in a rug,&#34; Willow replied.</p>

<p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yep.&#34;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#34;You look pretty,&#34; Buffy blurted out into the silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had the&nbsp;&nbsp;subtleness of a marching band, she did.</p>

<p>Willow's eyes widened-the universal gesture of shock.</p>

<p>&#34;…good, you look pretty good all things considered,&#34; Buffy went on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&nbsp;&nbsp;were her sentiments now?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were her poetic words, and gentle caresses?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell you…they ran away, and now, Buffy: the vampire slayer-otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;known as the bravest girl in all the world-was back peddling.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was back&nbsp;&nbsp;peddling like a son of a bastard, and could have given the world's best back&nbsp;&nbsp;peddlers a run for their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Not that you don't always look&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty...cause you do…just that with everything that's happened you look&nbsp;&nbsp;just as good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is good?&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy winced mentally as the words left her&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning statements into questions was never a good thing, ever.</p>

<p>&#34;I…&#34; Willow started to respond, still somewhat shocked but in a pleasant&nbsp;&nbsp;enough way.</p>

<p>&#34;Right.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was fairly certain that she had not finished her&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence.</p>

<p>&#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're right, it is getting late.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But I didn't say…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Bed sounds good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep it is.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;'Night Will,&#34; Buffy said pointedly shutting her eyes and praying to God&nbsp;&nbsp;that Willow would just go along with it.</p>

<p>&#34;Good-nightttt,&#34; Willow responded drawing out the words in a tone that&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly conveyed she was at a complete lose as to what just happened.</p>

<p>The room around her was busseling with activity. To a person removed the excitement, as Buffy was, it seemed almost as if someone had hit the fast forward button on a giant television screen. Like the morning before, Buffy had awoken to find Willow in her arm. Then just as they untangled themselves, Giles came into the room followed by a very disgruntled Spike-the vampire formerly known as William the Bloody did not appreciate being used to carry out manual labour, which in this case consisted of bringing Buffy's wheelchair into the room. Then, after some nervous greetings and useless information, Buffy had been lifted from the bed-and in a tense silence, I feel the need to add-and placed into the chair she now sat in.</p>

<p>Buffy knew that she should have been playing more attention, and taking a more active interest in helping her friends search out the answers that could cure her current predicament, yet the level of self-pity she was currently wallowing in took up a supreme amount of energy and she couldn't seem to muster up enough energy to inquire how things were going.</p>

<p>&#34;Enjoying the new wheels?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy turned her head to see Spike standing beside her.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't you have an elsewhere to be?&#34; Buffy asked wearily.</p>

<p>&#34;Is it so hear to believe that I just may be concerned about you and want to help?&#34; the vampire asked in a most innocent tone.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>

<p>Spike shrugged and dropped down onto the floor next to Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Now you know how Spike feels,&#34; the vampire said a moment later in a tone that was almost conversational. &#34;But it's not so bloody funny now that the shoe's on the other foot, is it? Is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Go away,&#34; Buffy growled.</p>

<p>&#34;I may now be just a Care-Bear with fangs, but you're now an even bigger waste of space than I am,&#34; Spike responded ignoring Buffy's previous statement.</p>

<p>&#34;Yet I could still kick your sorry ass,&#34; Buffy responded looking down at him. &#34;How pathetic does that make you?&#34;</p>

<p>Spike was silent for a moment, no doubt stewing that Buffy was indeed correct. But then he smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;You'd have to catch me first,&#34; he said looking up.</p>

<p>It hit it's mark and they were both silent for a moment. There were wounds that needed to be licked, and ego's that needed to be bandaged. It was time to tend to their wounds.</p>

<p>&#34;They're going to go after the thing that attacked you, you know?&#34; Spike said his eyes focused on the younings in front of him-and they were youngings to him, even Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;They want to…I know,&#34; Buffy responded shortly. She had hoped the silence would continue or he'd go away. She really wasn't in the mood for this.</p>

<p>&#34;And you're going to let them?&#34; Spike asked forcing a note of incredulity into his voice.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't respond because once again Spike had hit a sensitive stop. She didn't want them to track the demon that attacked her down. And she certainly didn't want them to fight it, not after she knew what it was capable of. Not after she was still bearing the effects of its attack.</p>

<p>&#34;Your concern for their well being is well…simply chilling,&#34; Spike injected into the silence while inducing a full body shiver for effect.</p>

<p>&#34;You know nothing of my concern,&#34; Buffy responded bitingly.</p>

<p>Spike smirked.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh really?&#34; he asked smugly. &#34;I think I know a little something about it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Shouldn't you be stealing candy from a baby, or scaring the elderly, you big baddie you,&#34; Buffy said practically snaring.</p>

<p>&#34;You, 'Bitter and Decrepit' Barbie, are scared out of you bloody mind and wallowing in enough self-pity to choke a fucking horse. In fact, you're so wrapped up in your whole 'woe is me' routine that you're just going to let Marianne, the Professor and Gilligan over there fight a demon that used you as a chew toy because you're in pain…and you call me a baddie?&#34; Spike asked.</p>

<p>Silence met him.</p>

<p>&#34;They're not going after it,&#34; Buffy finally said.</p>

<p>&#34;But they ARE going after it. They're going after it, and they're going to fight it…to save their precious Snow Buffy…and they're going to die.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;They're not going after it,&#34; Buffy said shaking her head as if to ward off what he was saying.</p>

<p>&#34;What's going to stop them?&#34; Spike asked the picture of innocent curiosity.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll stop them!&#34; Buffy declared quietly yet ferociously.</p>

<p>&#34;How?&#34; Spike asked a well timed moment later.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll…I'll…&#34; Buffy faltered. What would she do? Everything that had come to mind was no longer viable as a result of her current circumstances. What would she do? What could she do?</p>

<p>&#34;You'll…you'll what?&#34; Spike asked with barely restrained glee.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I'm not expert…wait, yes I am. You might want to put a little more thought into that, if you want to avoid that whole them dying unpleasantness,&#34; he finished rising to his feet.</p>

<p>Buffy focused her attention on the Scoobs after Spike walked away, and as she observed them she felt a heaviness descend upon her chest. The cause of this heaviness? Spike was right. They would track the demon down, and they would fight it-despite the odds of victory, if there was even the slightest chance that the demon could help her-and they would die. All for her, they would do that all for her and it made her want to weep, because she knew that she couldn't allow this happen, she couldn't allow them to fight it. So, she sat there-the one thing she could do rather well-and considered all that she must do and all that she couldn't do, and the heaviness settled more firmly over her and a tear ---though quickly wiped away-came to her eye. What would she do? What could she do?</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy wheeled her chair back and forth by the opening to the hallway that led to Giles's downstairs bed and bath-the place that had been home to her for the past two days. If one was looking closely enough they would have been able to detect a twisting of her lips, and a distortion of her features they would have been hard pressed to categorize. Was it a smile? Was it a grimace? Well, it just so happened that someone was looking close enough to see this particular expression on the Slayer's face, and she was at a loss for how to describe it.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Willow asked walking over to where the Slayer had embarked upon her mad cycle of pacing.</p>

<p>Intense blue eyes peered up at her and Willow felt lanced. The pain, and the dejection, in those kept in firmly in her place. It was as if she had taken root.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34; she said again, this time more softly, this time not a question but a plea.</p>

<p>Buffy opened her mouth as if to say something, but then promptly shut it again. A hundred, a thousand, little retorts to her friends very heart felt plea had come to her lips. A defense to the gently voiced plea no different from a porcupine's pins or a possum playing dead. But she stopped it before the words tumbled to her lips. As much as she wanted to lash out she wouldn't unleash her frustrations on Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;How's things?&#34; Buffy asked releasing Willow from her gaze and turning her attention to Giles and Xander who were still seated in the designated research area.</p>

<p>&#34;As always…slow and boring,&#34; Willow said keeping her eyes trained on the Slayer while Buffy's roamed. &#34;What's wrong?&#34; She had spent to much time around Buffy, observing Buffy-and though the Slayer didn't know this, loving Buffy-to not know when something was wrong with her.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing's wrong, what makes you think something's wrong?&#34; Buffy asked glancing up at Willow while tapping the wheel of her chair.</p>

<p>&#34;I can just tell,&#34; Willow responded. No matter how hard Buffy tried to hide it she could detect traces of bitterness in her words, and it stung her to see and hear her friend in such obvious pain.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at Willow thoughtfully for a moment, then bowed her head seemingly in thought. Then she did the most unexpected thing. She started to laugh. Loudly. Hysterically. She laughed so hard tears escaped from her eyes. She laughed so hard that Giles and Xander stopped reading their books and directed their attention towards her. Then as abruptly as she started she stopped and focused her gaze on Willow again. There was no amusement in her eyes, only a self-depreciation-and not her usually fun-loving 'yes I kill vampires for a living' kind, but a darker more sinister kind-along with a self-loathing of sorts.</p>

<p>She beckoned Willow to come closer by crooking her finger. Willow did as she was asked and bent closer.</p>

<p>&#34;You want to know what's wrong?&#34; Buffy asked without inflection.</p>

<p>Willow nodded.</p>

<p>&#34;I…&#34; Buffy smiled here. It was not a nice smile. &#34;I have to go to the bathroom.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So…&#34; Willow started to say, but she didn't need to complete the question. The answer hit her like a tonne of bricks or bucket of ice water.</p>

<p>&#34;I see I'm not the only one who didn't think of the…logistics of my new found position,&#34; Buffy said in response to the look on Willow's face.</p>

<p>&#34;We'll think of something,&#34; Willow said confidently looking down into Buffy's eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled. This time a real one, and all for Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;We'd better think of it fast,&#34; she responded dryly.</p>

<p>Willow's eyes widened and her lips parted slightly.</p>

<p>&#34;How long have you…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;About two hours,&#34; Buffy responded with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#34;Two hours?&#34; Willow asked incredulously though she didn't know why she was surprised. It was a very 'Buffy' thing to do.</p>

<p>&#34;Give or take,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>They stared at each other for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>&#34;Is everything alright over there?&#34; Giles called out. He and Xander had been watching them from when Buffy had lapsed into her laughing fit.</p>

<p>&#34;Right as rain,&#34; Buffy called back. Then she hesitated for a second before calling, &#34;Oh, Giles?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes?&#34; the watcher asked turning to face her again.</p>

<p>&#34;How much do you like this carpet?&#34; Buffy asked him in all innocence, or so she wanted it to seem.</p>

<p>Willow slapped her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't answer that,&#34; Willow said sternly, turning around to face the older man.</p>

<p>&#34;Never hurts to have a back up plan,&#34; Buffy muttered softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Now, you're just being gross,&#34; Willow said in a like tone, turning back around to face Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;It's a fact of life,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Birds do it, bee's do it, even educated flees do it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No Buffy,&#34; Willow said in a mockingly patronizing way. &#34;That's the game of love.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy said in a more somber tone. &#34;This IS going to be a labour of love.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow was quiet for a moment. Buffy was right of course, and that being the fact there was no one better to help Buffy than herself.</p>

<p>&#34;How's your upper body strength?&#34; the hacker asked a plan forming her mind.</p>

<p>&#34;Fine. My arms are still Slayerific. It's south of the border that things start to get screwy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You have no idea how relieved I am to hear that,&#34; Willow responded sighing. <br>
 &#34;We're definitely going to need it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's your 'I have a plan' voice,&#34; Buffy said.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, yes it is,&#34; Willow responded enigmatically.</p>

<p>&#34;Well then, into the wild blue yonder,&#34; Buffy said positioning her wheels towards the hallway.</p>

<p>Willow glanced up from the cards in her hand and cast a furtive glance in Buffy's direction. Only the light of a candle, creating a rather intimate atmosphere that both girls found comforting, lighted the room. It was well past midnight. Willow was spending the night again, this time the question didn't even need to be asked, it just seemed like some inexorable fact that Willow would remain. As Buffy raised her eyes towards Willow, Willow averted her eyes from Buffy. It was a game that had been going on all night, a sort of demented version of peek-a-boo. It actually interested the two girls far more than the card game they were playing did. There was something faintly erotic about it, about the fact that both of them were secretly wishing to get caught. It charged the air with something indiscernible, yet without doubt appealing.</p>

<p>&#34;Did you find it?&#34; Buffy asked keeping her gaze focused on Willow who looked up sharply at the sound of her voice. They had been sitting in a comfortable silence for quite some time and she didn't want to disturb it, yet this question had to be asked, this conversation had to be had. The longer she held it back the worse the feeling in her stomach got, and quite frankly she was in bad enough shape without adding an ulcer to the line-up.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked. &#34;The jelly-beans? Cause if you mean the jellybeans, Giles ate them all. He'll tell you that he didn't, but he did.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The demon actually…but I was wondering about the jellybeans,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow said brightening immediately. This caused a smile to grace her lips that sent Buffy's heart beating wildly, beating so fast in fact that she was sure it was about to beat out of her chest. &#34;Well, not 'found' exactly, but we know what it is,&#34; Willow continued. She was secretly glad that Buffy had asked. The Slayers lack of interest in the proceedings had been beginning to worry her. It wasn't like Buffy to just sit back and not take an active interest. It went against her nature.</p>

<p>&#34;Which is?&#34; Buffy asked interrupting Willow's thoughts. She was referring to the demon.</p>

<p>&#34;A Scheaklaer. They're a really old race, really, really old, which means they're survivors which isn't so good. But, what is good, at least for us, is that they need a lot of salt to survive so the places they can hide out are narrowed down considerably.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded along with Willow as she spoke, but she didn't respond right away. Her eyes were unfocused and Willow could tell that she was beyond lost in thought. Willow frowned. This was considerably less than the enthusiastic response she had been anticipating. Buffy should've been happy, they were that much closer to getting her the use of her legs back, but instead she seemed even more depressed than before. Willow was about to comment when Buffy spoke.</p>

<p>&#34;I've been thinking,&#34; Buffy said carefully. &#34;Maybe…maybe going after this thing isn't such a great idea,&#34; she continued bluntly. There was really no way to approach the subject delicately.</p>

<p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I said, 'maybe going after this thing isn't such a great…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I got that. That wasn't really an 'I didn't hear you' what. It was more of a 'have you lost your mind' what,&#34; Willow interjected. &#34;How can you say that this isn't a good idea? This thing is your best chance at getting the use of your legs back.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Buffy disagreed. &#34;This thing is a fat chance at getting my legs back and a excellent chance at you, Giles and Xander becoming a fiesta platter. That's what this demon is,&#34; Buffy continued raising her eyes to meet Willows.</p>

<p>&#34;You don't trust us,&#34; Willow said softly, her eyes piercing Buffy to her very core. &#34;You don't trust us to help you,&#34; Willow continued in a steady yet unmistakably hurt tone.</p>

<p>&#34;It's not that I don't trust you, it's what I trust to happen,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>

<p>&#34;No, not what you trust to happen…what you fear will happen,&#34; Willow responded, a kind of understanding creeping into her voice as she tried to work her mind around the thoughts racing around inside of her head. &#34;But that's all it is, Buff. A fear.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's all it is?&#34; Buffy asked incredulously. If she could have stood up to punctuate the incredulity of the statement she would have, but for now all she could do was sound as disbelieving as humanly possible. &#34;Look at me, you look at me and then tell me that fear is all it is! It's not fear that put me in this chair…it was that thing, it was one of those things that I'm built to fight and that used as a rag doll. No, Will, fear isn't all it is…truth is what it is, the ugly, naked truth is what it is,&#34; Buffy finished shaking her head miserably.</p>

<p>&#34;So we're just supposed to forget about the fact that this demon could cure you? We're just supposed to shrug our shoulders and say 'oh well, maybe next time' because there's a chance that we could be hurt?&#34; Willow asked standing up and looking down at Buffy. The Slayer refused to meet her eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Maybe we should just forget about it,&#34; Willow said softly a moment later when Buffy offered no response. &#34;We can't help you if you don't want to be helped. We can't force you to care.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at Willow when the hacker said this, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.</p>

<p>&#34;You think that this fun for me? Do you? Do you think that I like being trapped in this chair, not being able to do my duty or protect my friends? I don't want to be here, and I don't not want to be helped,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;I'll tell you one thing that I don't want though. I don't want to sacrifice you for a theory.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy you risk your life everyday to save us and people you don't even know. Is it so hard for you to comprehend that we're willing to do the same? That we'd risk it all to save someone we love?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't want you hurt,&#34; Buffy said softly.</p>

<p>&#34;And I don't want you hurt,&#34; Willow responded. &#34;But you are, and I want a part in making that go away.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>&#34;There's got to be another way,&#34; she said finally, her voice carrying a note of desperation.</p>

<p>&#34;What way?&#34; Willow asked wanting to believe that there was, but not seeing one. She had given the subject serious thought and had come up empty handed.</p>

<p>&#34;The Council,&#34; Buffy responded already mentally crossing it off her list the moment it left her mouth. She knew that wasn't even an option but it was the only thing she could think of.</p>

<p>&#34;I know you don't believe that. They're not terribly impressed with you right now as it is…what with the quitting and all. Besides…you know what they do to crippled Slayers.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy lowered her head. It was clear that the 'there had to be other options' approach was dead end, so she decided to switch tactics.</p>

<p>&#34;You don't understand,&#34; the Slayer said finally. &#34;When I think about something happening to you it makes me physically ill,&#34; she continued. &#34;Don't you see…even if you went after the demon, and you found a cure but you didn't come back, it wouldn't matter, it wouldn't matter at all because I'd die anyway. Without you I'd die.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow looked at her with eyes made iridescent by unshed tears.</p>

<p>&#34;And you don't understand that I feel exactly the same way. I can't lose you,&#34; Willow responded her tone taking on the same distressed leaning as Buffy's. &#34;And you know that this isn't just about your legs, it's about your life. With Faith…otherwise disposed, not to mention crazy, and you…currently out of operation the world is without a Slayer. The Council…Giles warned us…you know they'll come for you if they find out. Buffy, we have to do this…your life is at risk,&#34; Willow finished not even wanting to continue thinking along those lines.</p>

<p>They stared at each other once Willow fell silent, both fighting back a waterfall of tears and the outraged cries of their souls. Buffy buried her face in her hands. Never in her life had she felt so utterly helpless. Impotence, she realized, was not a feeling that she cared for at all.</p>

<p>&#34;You want to know something?&#34; the Slayer asked looking up a second later. &#34;The only thing that I want in the entire world right now is to hug you. That's all I want… and I can't even do that,&#34; Buffy said sad smile. &#34;Aren't I amazing pathetic?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow got up and walked over to where Buffy sat. She reached out her hand to Buffy and the Slayer grasped it. After debating internally for a moment Buffy took Willow's hand and placed it on her cheek holding it there for a moment. Suddenly, Buffy felt an overwhelming need to be closer to her friend-and not just for the first or hundredth time she cursed her injury. Then, she did the only thing she could do; she pulled Willow down onto her lap.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, your legs,&#34; Willow protested, albeit weakly.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't feel it,&#34; Buffy said to put aside Willow's fears. &#34;I do feel like your sugar-daddy though.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow smiled at that, but still felt the need to ask.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy are you sure? …I don't want to hurt you…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Will…stop,&#34; Buffy said shushing her gently as she stroked her hand. &#34;This is the best I've been in two days. Relax.&#34;</p>

<p>A few moments later Buffy felt Willow relax slightly in her lap. The rigid-ness that had existed in her friends body a few seconds before and Willow slumped against her. They were silent, and Buffy considered the appropriateness of resting her head against Willows shoulder. After deciding that it was completely inappropriate she did it anyway. After all pulling Willow onto her lap hadn't been the most respectable thing to do, but she had done it anyway. If something is worth doing, it's worth doing well, so Buffy decided to do as she wanted.</p>

<p>The Slayer felt Willow shift slightly once her head was on her shoulder and she knew that Willow was looking down at her. Then the most unexpected thing happened. Buffy felt a pair of soft lips press against the crown of her head. Then as soon as she felt the gentle touch it was gone, and Buffy felt cold, like the sun had burned out leaving her in the dark.</p>

<p>&#34;It'll be alright,&#34; Willow said softly wrapping her arm around Buffy shoulder and bringing them closer together. Willow felt as if she should pull away, especially after the kiss, but she just couldn't bring herself to do it.</p>

<p>&#34;I believe,&#34; Buffy responded in a reverent tone.</p>

<p>Willow didn't respond in words, instead she rested her head against Buffy's that was still nestled in her shoulder and let out a soft, contented sigh.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the world someone was dying of starvation, someone was getting to a car crash, someone was giving birth, someone was winning the lottery. Someone was getting shot, someone was sneaking home, someone was leaving home. But none of this occurred to Buffy or Willow as they sat there, wrapped together. It didn't even occur to them that it wasn't occurring to them. At that moment, at that time, the world where all of those things were happening didn't exist to them. In fact nothing outside of their candle lit room, their fortress of solitude, their intimate hide-a-way existed. And in that room, everything was perfect. The world was perfect and life was perfect. In that room was perfection.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy found herself in some kind of underground cave. In front of her was a small body of water. Sparkling, clear water. It was absolutely beautiful. Turning her gaze from the pool she tilted her head upwards. There was a vertical tunnel above her that led to an opening sunlight was pouring through. She realized where she was. She was in an underground well. Once when researching a project on Mexico she had read about them and had always wanted to visit one. Even in the books they had looked magnificent.</p>

<p>She wondered what she was doing there, and she probably would have wondered for a few more moments if a she hadn't been distracted by the sweet sounds of laughing. It was lilting, playful, and melodic. I called to her and she found herself moving towards where she assumed the source of it to be.</p>

<p>From where she was standing she could only see half of the pool, there was a sheet of rock that extended out blocking the rest of it from her view. She knew instinctively that the sound-that familiar sound-was coming from the side of the pool she couldn't see.</p>

<p>Quietly she removed her clothes and slipped noiselessly into the water and began to swim around. Almost the instant she passed the wall of rock she was shocked into inaction. At the other end of the pool was another figure. A girl. A girl equally as naked as herself with her back turned towards the Slayer. The other girl had pale, porcelain skin and red-hair just reaching her shoulder. She was a Siren, come out of Greek mythology to tempt Buffy, and Buffy was tempted.</p>

<p>As Buffy decided to proceed forward the Siren turned around.</p>

<p>Willow.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, she knew it. She knew it was Willow.</p>

<p>Willow returned the smile.</p>

<p>They swam towards each other.</p>

<p>&#34;You're looking better,&#34; Siren Willow commented coming to a stop just in front of Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, the dreamscape is an amazing thing,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Last night I was Wonder Woman…and trust me I found some better uses for the lasso.&#34;</p>

<p>Siren Willow smiled. It was a sexy, entrancing smile.</p>

<p>Buffy moved imperceptivity closer.</p>

<p>&#34;I've been waiting for you,&#34; Siren Willow said allowing Buffy to move closer to her until they were touching.</p>

<p>&#34;I've been waiting for you,&#34; Buffy responded looking deeply into Willow's eyes. &#34;There's so much I've wanted to tell you, but…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You've been afraid,&#34; Willow finished for her, reaching a wet hand up to place it on Buffy's face. &#34;Don't be afraid,&#34; she continued leaning in.</p>

<p>&#34;There's so much I want to…&#34; Buffy started but once again Willow stopped her.</p>

<p>&#34;This isn't the place,&#34; was all the Siren said.</p>

<p>&#34;But…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; she said again. &#34;This.&#34;</p>

<p>With that she closed the remaining distance between them and brought her lips to Buffy's, kissing her softly, chastely. Buffy whimpered at the contact and drew her arm around Willow's waist holding her tightly against her.</p>

<p>&#34;That's right,&#34; Willow said sighing, encouraging Buffy to continue with what she was doing. &#34;This.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This,&#34; Buffy repeated, then she lowered her lips to Willow's neck sucking on the skin there, nipping gently.</p>

<p>Under and above the water her hands roamed over Willow's body and her lips traversed the entire landscape of the masterpiece that was Willow Rosenberg. They spent an eternity exploring each others mouths, learning each others bodies inch by inch, kissing, licking, touching. Their bodies coming together and separating in a dance as old as time. Coming together, and separating, rising and falling into each until they come together one last earth-shattering, soul-searing time.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes popped open.</p>

<p>Willow's eyes popped open.</p>

<p>Their faces were directly beside each other, there limbs tangled together and the sheets in disarray. There wasn't enough space between their bodies to fit a piece of paper.</p>

<p>They stared at each other, both of them breathing heavily and eyeing the other terrified and excited at the same time, wondering if the other could possibly have any idea what had just gone on in their heads.</p>

<p>&#34;Morning?&#34; Buffy said her voice cracking and rising halfway through.</p>

<p>&#34;It is,&#34; Willow said her pupils not completely back to their normal size, and her breathing still laboured.</p>

<p>&#34;You look flushed,&#34; Buffy said willing herself not to take note of her own bodies reactions. &#34;Bad dream?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No…I mean yes!&#34; Willow responded. &#34;Very bad…hand on a hook bad.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, that's pretty bad,&#34; Buffy, agreed. &#34;Clown with a big knife for me,&#34; she volunteered before Willow could even ask.</p>

<p>&#34;Scary,&#34; the hacker agreed.</p>

<p>&#34;Yep, I thought so…obviously,&#34; Buffy, responded more for the sake of saying something. She didn't really want to think at the moment.</p>

<p>&#34;Right,&#34; Willow responded, her motives the same as Buffy's.</p>

<p>&#34;So…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Breakfast?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah! …I mean I could eat…food! I could eat food,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you're in luck. Food is on the menu,&#34; Buffy responded managing to sit up after struggling a bit. &#34;You're just going to have to reach the high shelves,&#34; she joked as she used her arms to place her legs over the edge of the bed so she could lift herself into the chair.</p>

<p>&#34;I always had to anyway,&#34; Willow responded climbing out of her side of the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Was that a short joke?&#34; Buffy asked looking up sharply though her eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#34;Who's joking?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm going to run over your toes for that,&#34; Buffy responded aiming the wheels of the chair at her friend.</p>

<p>Willow mock shivered, but then carefully moved around the Slayer from a safe distance. They headed into the kitchen after that and proceeded to make breakfast-graciously deciding to at least leave one scone for Giles-both thankful for the distraction though they knew inevitably they'd have to think about the dream. But hey, they're teenagers. Procrastinating is in their nature.</p>
