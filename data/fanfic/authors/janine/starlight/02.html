<p>Buffy watched the proceedings at the table around her with an unavoidable discomfort. The kitchen table was covered with texts and maps, and they were all gathered around trying to prepare a course of action. Giles had narrowed down the area where they were most likely to find the demon and they had to figure out how they wanted to approach the situation. The area they were focused on were the caves on the concave of Sunnydale's shoreline.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you think, Buffy?&#34; Giles asked looking up and fixing his gaze on the Slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy met his gaze but then quickly looked away.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know,&#34; she said slowly. She didn't need to look at Giles to know that his eyebrow was arched and he was looking at her questioningly.</p>

<p>&#34;Not even a suggestion?&#34; the watcher asked in response.</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged.</p>

<p>Giles observed her for a moment, then stood up and straightened his back to a rigidity anyone birthed outside of Europe would have thought to be impossible. As he did this Buffy continued to avoid his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Would you all be so kind as to give Buffy and I a moment alone?&#34; Giles asked turning to look at the other members of the table individually.</p>

<p>The members of the table shifted their attention from Giles to Buffy and then back to Giles again. There was a moments hesitation, then slowly Xander, Willow and Anya stood up and moved away from the table into the sitting room.</p>

<p>&#34;Would you like to get some fresh air?&#34; Giles asked turning his attention towards Buffy. With the other still in the house they wouldn't really be able to talk privately.</p>

<p>&#34;Would it matter if I said no?&#34; Buffy asked finally looking up at him.</p>

<p>&#34;Of course it would,&#34; Giles said looking down at Buffy gently. &#34;But I would prefer if we could take a short walk.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Then I'd love to get some fresh air,&#34; Buffy responded dryly.</p>

<p>Giles merely nodded and walked behind Buffy's chair. Grasping the handles he began to push her towards the door.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy pointedly turned her face away from Giles, her lips were pressed together tightly in an attempt to contain her growing anger. So much for fresh air, she thought to herself, she was sitting in the middle of the Spanish fucking Inquisition. The moment they had hit sunlight Giles had started to lay into her about her behavior and she had just about had it.</p>

<p>&#34;…and I know that being placed in this position has been difficult for you. But you are still the Slayer, and you have responsibilities. This non-committence can't happen Buffy. There'll be plenty of time to…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think the word your looking for is 'wallow',&#34; Buffy offered bitterly.</p>

<p>&#34;There'll be plenty of time to REFLECT on what's happened later,&#34; Giles continued ignoring Buffy's interjection. &#34;But right now we need you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Was I not there at the table?&#34; Buffy asked looking at him angrily. &#34;Was I not text reading girl? Was I not 'give a painfully descriptive account of your near death experience and the beast that did it' girl? Yes, I think I was all of those things, so please Giles, please because I'd really like to know…enlighten me as to where you're getting this absentee Buffy idea from?&#34; the Slayer finished shooting a look at him that could've turn him into stone.</p>

<p>&#34;No Buffy, sitting at the table not paying attention to anyone or anything does not constitute 'being there' where I come from.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah well, where you come from they call French fries chips, so you'll excuse me if I don't take your definition at face value,&#34; Buffy retorted.</p>

<p>&#34;You're being difficult,&#34; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&#34;And you're being a jerk,&#34; Buffy shot back.</p>

<p>&#34;I had hoped we could have a civilized conversation,&#34; Giles said softly as he took off his glasses and began to rub his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, and I once hoped to be given a bunny that would lay golden eggs,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;We don't always get what we hope for, in fact most of the stuff we do get we wouldn't wish on our worst enemy,&#34; she continued looking down at her legs pointedly.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well life kicked you in the ass so I suppose we should all just give up go home and drink some tea, and you can role over and commiserate with yourself next decade or so. As for the rest of the poor wankers in this town well they can just bloody well fend for themselves from now on, right? Because we can't be bloody bothered to help the wincers, can we?&#34; Giles said finishing his derisive tirade.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, that's just fantastic,&#34; Buffy responded antagonistically. &#34;I lose the use of my legs, find out my friends are preparing to embark upon a suicide mission, and I'm some sort of shallow asshole for being upset?&#34; Buffy asked in amazement. &#34;Am I the only one that realizes this is a normal human reaction? I know that we don't spend much time around actual honest to god humans, but I was fairly certain that we still were.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're right of course,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;It is a normal human reaction…but Buffy, you are not a normal human,&#34; Giles continued. Buffy looked at him sharply. &#34;And I know that you don't want to hear that right now. I know that in addition to being a Slayer you're a girl with normal girl feelings, but you have responsibilities that can't be put aside because you're sad. And I know that hand you've given can sometimes be horrible, but it IS your hand to play out.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well…screw cards, I fold,&#34; Buffy said militantly. &#34;It's my paralysis and I'll cry if I want to.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Giles said in a more pleading tone. &#34;Please, help us help you.&#34;</p>

<p>Giles waited, but Buffy didn't respond.</p>

<p>&#34;Fine,&#34; the watcher responded. &#34;Have it your way,&#34; he continued then he walked around the fountain in his yard-that was curiously never on-and headed for the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Buffy asked turning her head around to look at him.</p>

<p>&#34;Inside,&#34; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Wait! Giles ! You can't just leave me out here ! Giles…&#34; Buffy finally stopped calling it was no use. He was already inside.</p>

<p>Buffy turned her chair around angrily and started wheeling towards the door. Once she reached the door she angled the chair so that she could reach the handle, but it was of no use, the chair kept getting in the way of the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles!&#34; she yelled at the door.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;Where's Buffy?&#34; Willow asked as Giles walked back inside.</p>

<p>&#34;She's enjoying the fresh air,&#34; the watcher responded. &#34;Please, all of you come back over here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But Giles,&#34; Willow said as the three of them headed over to the table. &#34;How's she going to get back in?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy's a resourceful girl,&#34; Giles responded leaning over his map of the shoreline.</p>

<p>&#34;But…&#34; it was Xander who tried to speak this time but Giles halted his protest.</p>

<p>&#34;I know what I'm doing,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;She needs this.&#34;</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, until a yell interrupted them. It was Buffy calling Giles's name from outside the door.</p>

<p>Willow sat on the floor at Buffy's feet undoing the laces of the Slayer's running shoes. It was ten at night, and except for the sounds of their breathing the room was quiet. Xander and Anya had left a few hours before, and Giles and Buffy weren't currently on speaking terms.</p>

<p>That yell that they had heard while gathered around the table earlier had only been the beginning. Buffy continued to scream at the top of her lungs for fifteen minutes before Willow couldn't take anymore and went to get her. Giles had managed to stop her five minutes before and tried to stop her again, but she was determined.</p>

<p>Buffy had wheeled herself in silently and without looking at any of them-except for Willow who she tenderly thanked-she rolled herself into the bedroom where she remained for the rest of the day. Willow, who was less than thrilled with Giles as well, spent most of the day in the bedroom with Buffy, only leaving her to check up on the progress they were making in the main room.</p>

<p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Buffy said softly, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&#34;For what?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>Buffy merely looked down at her feet, the feet Willow was currently pulling shoes off of.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm glad I can help,&#34; Willow responded before returning to her work.</p>

<p>&#34;You're more than helping,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Your saving. I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here,&#34; she continued sincerely.</p>

<p>&#34;Now you know how I feel on an almost daily basis,&#34; Willow responded with a sweet smile.</p>

<p>&#34;I guess I do,&#34; Buffy responded returning the smile.</p>

<p>They continued to look at each for a few more seconds before Willow finally averted her gaze and started to remove Buffy's socks.</p>

<p>&#34;You're going to have to talk to him again sometime,&#34; Willow commented softly a moment later.</p>

<p>&#34;No I don't,&#34; Buffy responded petulantly.</p>

<p>&#34;He wasn't trying to be mean,&#34; Willow responded in a reasonable tone.</p>

<p>&#34;If his intentions were so honorable then why haven't you been talking to him all day either?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Protecting my honor, perhaps?&#34; the Slayer cleverly asked.</p>

<p>&#34;He just…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wanted to prove to me that I DO need your help, and that if I keep acting the way I have been I'm going to be alone, and that I'm beyond vulnerable the way that I am and I need to get my legs back or I'm dead, and that feeling sorry for myself isn't going to get a damn thing done. Is that 'just' what he wanted?&#34; Buffy asked looking down at Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, yeah,&#34; Willow responded grinning. &#34;I guess it worked though.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It was inhumane. If I was a dog there would be a network special dedicated to the trial I had to go through. But I'm lower than a dog, I'm the Slayer! I don't lick my own ass, or drink from the toilet, I just save the world so who gives a flying fuck!&#34; Buffy finished dramatically.</p>

<p>&#34;I spoke too soon,&#34; Willow said softly sitting back on the floor.</p>

<p>&#34;Please, Will…don't,&#34; Buffy said shaking her head as if to ward off the oncoming attack. &#34;I don't need to get the speech from you too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What speech?&#34; Willow asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;The 'you're not allowed to have feelings because your Slayer' speech. The 'so you're paralyzed, suck it up speech', and any other variation on the theme that you can think of,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said slowly lifting her hand up to take Buffy's into hers. &#34;Would you consider hearing an 'I love you Buffy, and you and can lean on me, cry on my shoulder and whatever else you want' speech?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I think I could deal with that,&#34; Buffy responded smiling.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I love you,&#34; Willow said looking up at Buffy. &#34;And you can lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend. I'll help you carry on,&#34; Willow continued in an utterly serious voice, which only made Buffy's smile widen. &#34;And whenever you feel the need…or want to just for the heck of it…you can cry on my shoulder, or pant leg, or any other part of my body, and if there's something else that you can think of that would help…well, you can do that too.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;That's the best speech I've ever heard in life,&#34; Buffy replied. &#34;Look, it's made me all misty-eyed,&#34; she continued blinking back some tears.</p>

<p>Willow raised up onto her knees so that she and Buffy were face to face. Then she reached up with her right hand and brushed away a tear that Buffy couldn't quite manage to contain-though she was giving it a valiant try. Once she had done this Willow continued to reach around with her hand, brushing a few strands of Buffy's hair behind her ear, before finally leaving her hand to rest on Buffy's cheek.</p>

<p>Buffy leaned into the touch slightly, her eyes flickering closed as she absorbed the sensations flooding through her body. She wanted to turn her face around and softly kiss the palm of Willow's hand. She wanted to take that hand in hers and rain a shower of kisses across it, and along her arm. She wanted to take Willow into her arms and kiss her until nothing existed in the entire world except for them. She wanted…</p>

<p>She needed to end this before it started, because she knew if it started she wouldn't be able to end it.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow,&#34; Buffy breathed in husky timbre she hadn't intended, but couldn't help.</p>

<p>At the sound of Buffy's voice Willow became painfully aware of their positioning and of what she herself was doing. She also noted with an agonizing sluggishness that her heart was thundering in her chest, and she became almost unnaturally aware of the blood that was madly coursing through her veins. In short, she realized that her body had responded to Buffy's muted utterance with a pure, unadulterated rush of desire. She could feel the yearning burning in the pit of her stomach like a wild fire, consuming her.</p>

<p>She felt like a thug, and was overcome by a moment of intense self-loathing. She couldn't comprehend how she could be so selfish at a moment like this, and it made her sick to think that at a time when Buffy needed her friendship more than anything, all that she could think of was kissing her friends lips-lips she had decided after careful consideration, years worth at least, were the best, most lush, most kissable lips ever to be created.</p>

<p>Willow yanked her hand back and stood up abruptly. Buffy looked up at her questioningly, her friends unexpected movements momentarily destabilizing her equilibrium.</p>

<p>&#34;We should go to bed,&#34; Willow said meeting Buffy's gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;It's ten-thirty,&#34; Buffy responded giving a Willow an uncertain smile.</p>

<p>&#34;It's been a long day,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>&#34;That it has,&#34; Buffy said a moment later, sighing. &#34;Sleep sounds good actually.&#34;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy held her position-facing the door, her back turned Willow-for a second more before finally turning around. They had gotten in bed about half an hour ago, but neither of them had managed to fall asleep. She could hear Willow breathing and her breaths were still coming in the fast, erratic pattern of consciousness.</p>

<p>&#34;I knew ten thirty was too early to go to sleep,&#34; Buffy said into darkness. &#34;I'm really kind of night person.&#34;</p>

<p>She didn't need to open her eyes to know that Willow was laughing.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't imagine why,&#34; Willow responded shifting so that she was facing Buffy as well.</p>

<p>&#34;Hey, if you're worried about the guy with a hook for a hand, don't. I'll protect you,&#34; Buffy said, but as she said the last part her voice hollowed out as if she only then realized that what she was saying was no longer true.</p>

<p>&#34;I know you will,&#34; Willow responded with absolutely certainty. She had picked up on the change in Buffy's voice immediately and knew what caused it. She shifted a little bit closer to Buffy and placed her hand on the Slayer's shoulder. &#34;You know that you're my hero, don't you?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you might want to start checking the classifieds for a replacement,&#34; Buffy responded dropping her eyes though Willow couldn't see.</p>

<p>&#34;Won't need to,&#34; Willow said. &#34;You're going to be back on the job in no time.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy raised her eyes again after that, feeling an intense need to be close to Willow. She couldn't even really describe what she feeling, only that then, there, Willow was…Willow was… everything. She was shining and shimmering and everything that was good and pure in her life, and in the world. She was the one who could save her from the ranks of the freaks, the suspect, and the lonely.</p>

<p>&#34;I…&#34; the Slayer started to say, but she couldn't think of the words. &#34;There's so much that I want to…&#34; but she trailed off again not knowing how to describe all that she was feeling. But she needed to do something, she needed to…she needed to…kiss the girl.</p>

<p>So she did.</p>

<p>Buffy closed the small distance that remained between them, and touched her lips to Willows, barely brushing the hackers full lips with her own.</p>

<p>Then she pulled back and observed Willow. The red heads eyes were closed, her lips were slightly parted, and she didn't seem to be breathing.</p>

<p>&#34;I just…this,&#34; Buffy said almost inaudibly, then she brought her lips back to Willows. She pressed them together more firmly this time, but the kiss was still chaste, and quickly over.</p>

<p>This time when Buffy pulled back Willow's eyes were open and she was watching the Slayer with a kind of wide eyed wonder that Buffy was certain was unique to Willow alone. She opened her mouth as if she was going to say something, but no sound came out and she quickly closed her mouth.</p>

<p>&#34;Do…do you think you'll be able to sleep now?&#34; Buffy asked reaching out to brush a strand of hair that had fallen over Willow's eyes out of her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow said softly, nodding her head as if the empathize the truthfulness of her response.</p>

<p>&#34;Good,&#34; Buffy responded, leaving her hand where it was for moment longer before removing it and returning it to her side.</p>

<p>&#34;Goodnight,&#34; Willow said, her voice was shaky.</p>

<p>&#34;Night,&#34; Buffy responded contemplatively.</p>

<p>Willow shifted settling back into her former position, and was ready to try and fall back asleep-which she seriously doubted she would be able to do-but she stopped and turned back around to face Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you,&#34; she said with a touch of awe in her voice.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you too, Will,&#34; Buffy responded with a small smile.</p>

<p>With that both girls turned around and placed their heads back down on their pillows and took up staring at the door and the window respectively. Both of them began reviewing the events of the night, and the past few days. Both of them began reviewing what they themselves had said and initiated, and what the other had said and initiated. And as they did this both them were left wondering, what the hell was going?</p>

<p>It was eight in the morning and the Scoobs-minus an Anya and plus a Spike-were once again gathered in Giles's living room. Today was the day of reckoning…they were going after the Scheaklar. The mood was tense, they all realized the danger of the mission and the consequences of failure. Buffy's future, and accordingly all of their futures were at risk.</p>

<p>&#34;So…according to what we've learned from the texts, the liquid found a sac behind the demons femur should combat the toxin which is currently attacking Buffy's spinal cord. This means that it is preferable to take the demon dead rather than alive,&#34; Giles said gearing the team up for their mission highly improbable. &#34;Any questions?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Xander said piping up. &#34;How do we do the killing again? I missed how we do the killing.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The weakest section of a Scheaklar 's body is the area in-between their shoulder blades. A major part of their circulatory systems is located there, and one sturdy thrust with this,&#34; Giles said holding up one his many old swords, &#34;should kill it quite effectively. Once it's dead I should then start the process of removing the sac.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So basically, Will, banana head and I are suppose to distract this Sch-a-what's-it while you play Lancelot?&#34; Xander asked.</p>

<p>Giles nodded.</p>

<p>&#34;Just making sure,&#34; Xander responded before plopping back down on the couch.</p>

<p>&#34;Are there any other questions?&#34; Giles asked looking around the room.</p>

<p>Buffy raised her hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Not so much a question as a concern,&#34; the Slayer started. &#34;Am I the only one here the least bit concerned that Willow is missing school? Am I?&#34; she asked in a suitably indignant tone.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, really,&#34; Giles said in a disapproving tone.</p>

<p>&#34;What? I'm concerned. Education is important,&#34; Buffy responded in her most sincere voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, if that's truly your concern, let me put it to rest,&#34; Giles replied. &#34;It's Sunday.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Really?&#34; Buffy asked looking at her watch. &#34;So it is,&#34; she continued momentarily defeated. &#34;But……………church!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, I'm Jewish,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Right,&#34; Buffy said with a defeated sigh. &#34;Then I guess I'm not of questions and or concerns.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Giles said clapping his hands all ready to go. &#34;Let's,&#34; he glanced over at Willow. &#34;…get going as soon as somebody decides to get dressed.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow looked down at her cow pajamas.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't help but think that was directed at me,&#34; she responded.</p>

<p>Buffy smirked.</p>

<p>&#34;Come on,&#34; the Slayer said. &#34;I'll help you find something appropriate for inspiring abject terror in all but the most terrible of beasts.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;All I have are pastels,&#34; Willow commented as she followed Buffy into the bedroom.</p>

<p>&#34;So it'll take awhile,&#34; the Slayer responded. &#34;Rome wasn't built in a day, you know?&#34;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;Tell her&#34;, that annoying voice in the back of Buffy's head screamed as the Slayer watched Willow pull on her socks.</p>

<p>&#34;No&#34;, Buffy yelled at the voice effectively conveying her wish for it to shut the hell up.</p>

<p>&#34;You have to tell her,&#34; the voice continued. &#34;Would you be able to live with yourself if something happened to her without you having told her how you feel?&#34; the voice went on.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing's going to happen to her,&#34; Buffy told the voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, if this was such a cake wake than why have you been trying to convince them not to go for the last two days?&#34; the voice asked in a reasonable tone.</p>

<p>&#34;Because,&#34; Buffy said trying to think of a response. &#34;The salt will be bad for their shoes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, that's a convincing argument,&#34; the voice retorted.</p>

<p>&#34;Why do you not shut up?&#34; Buffy asked the voice peevishly.</p>

<p>&#34;Because you don't really want me to,&#34; the voice responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I think I do,&#34; Buffy shot back. &#34;I think I really, really do!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;If you really, really, did, I wouldn't still be here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're talking in donuts,&#34; Buffy responded. They were going around in circles but nothing was in the middle.</p>

<p>&#34;Tell her,&#34; the voice responded. &#34;I'm hear because you want to tell her but you're afraid. I'm here to make you actually do it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, your doing a piss poor job of it, because I'm not telling,&#34; Buffy replied.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, you are,&#34; the voice said with a certainty that irritated Buffy. &#34;Don't you think that you at least owe it to her to be truthful? She is risking her life for yours after all.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;She knows that I love her,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>'Tell her how much,&#34; the voice pleaded.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't,&#34; Buffy responded knowing that she could but she was just scared.</p>

<p>&#34;You can,&#34; the voice said confidently. &#34;And you will. There's nothing to be scared of.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But what if…&#34; Buffy's response to herself was interrupted.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Willow asked, her voice tinged with concern.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy said looking up at Willow. &#34;Wow,&#34; she continued checking Willow out. &#34;Lara Croft look out there's a new chick in town.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Stop it,&#34; Willow said blushing.</p>

<p>&#34;It's true,&#34; Buffy replied. &#34;I'm getting scared just looking at you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Willow asked desperate to get the conversation off of her clothes and how she looked in them.</p>

<p>&#34;As okay as can be,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&#34;You looked a little out of it,&#34; Willow replied.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I was…I mean I,&#34; Buffy paused there for a moment. &#34;There's something I wanted to talk to you about before you go,&#34; she said looking up and snaring Willow's eyes with an intense gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said taking a seat on the edge of the bed so that she was almost eye to eye with Buffy.</p>

<p>'It's about…it's about last night, when I…when I…when I kissed you,&#34; Buffy said getting off to a sputtering start. &#34;When I…I mean…I wanted to tell you that…&#34; Willow cut her off.</p>

<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Willow responded, a piece of her heart chipping off with every word. &#34;It was strictly platonic…a comfort kiss,&#34; she continued while thinking that it was anything but platonic on her side of the fence, and that she desperately wanted the same to be true for Buffy's side as well.</p>

<p>&#34;No,&#34; Buffy said shaking her head in disagreement. &#34;It wasn't that…it wasn't that at all.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow was silent for a moment, trying to wrap her mind around what Buffy was actually saying, and what she wanted Buffy to be saying.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; she asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;When I first got attacked and was lying in the cemetery there was this one persistent thought in my head, this one unshakable image…you,&#34; Buffy responded tenderly. &#34;You smiling. You laughing. You with your 'resolve face' on. You typing at the computer. You lounging on your bed. It was like a Willow collage in my mind, and all that I could think about was how much I was going to miss you and…and how much I love you,&#34; Buffy continued gaining confidence as she went on. &#34;And these weren't new feelings or thoughts, it was just that…that this was the first time it was safe to admit what they really were.</p>

<p>&#34;But…but when I woke up, it was like everything had to go back into it's place, and I tried…I really, really did, but it was no good, I couldn't put them back because I remembered what it was like to love you, and it was beautiful, and…last night I just wanted to, I don't know…I guess I just wanted to show you.</p>

<p>&#34;And, I'm sorry, I'm sorry that I took advantage of the situation like that, and I'm sorry for once again demonstrating a total lack of control, but my heart…it was in the right place. It really was. I just had to tell you, before…well, before. And don't think that I'm telling you this, because I expect something, cause I don't, I just wanted you know. And…and I just hope that now that you know you won't hate me, or want to leave, because as much as I've proven I can take that's the one thing I don't think I could…&#34; Buffy finished trailing off, all the while wondering why the hell she listened to that stupid voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow breathed out softly once the Slayer finished. What she had just heard was the realization of a dream she never thought would be anymore than that-a dream-and it had her in some kind of state of shock.</p>

<p>Buffy dropped her head down. The last thing that she wanted was for Willow to offer her some heartfelt words of pity.</p>

<p>Willow moved off of the bed and dropped to her knees in front of Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, look at me,&#34; Willow gently implored.</p>

<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment, then she looked up at Willow as originally requested.</p>

<p>Willow's lips curved up into an alluring smile when their eyes met.</p>

<p>Buffy's heart missed a beat.</p>

<p>&#34;I am sooo okay with everything you just said,&#34; Willow continued holding Buffy's gaze with her own. There was this fluttering warmth consuming her, she felt as if the sun was beating down solely on her, and it was great to be alive.</p>

<p>She placed her hand on Buffy's cheek, then raised up onto to her knees.</p>

<p>And then they were kissing. Lips brushing against each other, bodies arching in search of a closeness to match that of their lips. Colours exploding behind the lids of their eyes, heart rates increasing, thundering in their chests. Nerve ending on fire, cells misfiring in every direction, blood coursing through their veins. They kissed. They kissed for an eternity, they kissed a kiss that stretched on for eons binding their souls together 'til infinity. They kissed for a nanosecond. They kissed until the world made sense again.</p>

<p>&#34;Uga boda uh,&#34; Buffy muttered once they broke apart.</p>

<p>&#34;Ama pusha tem,&#34; Willow responded equally incoherent.</p>

<p>&#34;Whoa,&#34; Buffy said-in a very Joey Lawrence during his prime way- starting to gain some control of her oratory system.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll second that,&#34; Willow responded somewhat breathlessly.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, then they both broke out into spastic grins.</p>

<p>&#34;I feel I should warn you that I'm having very powerful urges to kiss you again,&#34; Buffy said softly gazing directly into Willow's eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;It's not good to repress powerful emotions, it leads to festering and stomach hurts,&#34; Willow responded leaning forward. &#34;In the interests of your health and general well being I would have to encourage you to give into the urges.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Is that your professional advice?&#34; Buffy asked gently taking Willow's hands into hers.</p>

<p>&#34;That is the final prognosis of Dr. Willow Van Goodlove.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, and leaned in to meet her friends lips.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, good there you are,&#34; Giles said breezing into the bedroom.</p>

<p>The girls froze for a second-or as it felt to them a century or two-then pulled back into their original starting positions two meters away from each other.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles…wha…you can't just…what if one of us were naked?!&#34; Buffy exclaimed agitatedly.</p>

<p>&#34;I must confess the thought never entered my mind,&#34; Giles responded frowning.</p>

<p>&#34;No reason it should have,&#34; Willow said jumping in. &#34;Nobody was naked, or planning on being naked, or even hoping to be naked. Nope…there was no nakedness to be had…especially not the naughty kind,&#34; Willow continued babbling nervously.</p>

<p>&#34;If we could veer the conversation away from nudity it would be greatly appreciated,&#34; Giles said visibly shuddering. He was British after all.</p>

<p>Buffy started to open her mouth to respond but Giles-wisely-stopped her before she could.</p>

<p>&#34;It's time to head out,&#34; he said directing his words to Willow.</p>

<p>The hacker nodded, then turned to look at Buffy before standing up.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles wait,&#34; Buffy said as Willow started to head towards the Watcher. &#34;Could we just have a minute?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yo…I'll be outside,&#34; Giles said. He had started to protest but something in Buffy's eyes had told him that whatever she wanted to say to Willow was important.</p>

<p>Buffy waited until Giles was out the door, then turned to face Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;Come over here?&#34; Buffy requested softly.</p>

<p>Willow walked the few steps over to where Buffy was seated.</p>

<p>Buffy reached out her hand and took Willows into hers. Then she did what she had wanted to do the night before, and countless other nights, days, evening, and mornings-she raised Willows palm to her lips and placed a kiss directly in the middle.</p>

<p>&#34;I know you have to go,&#34; Buffy started holding Willows hand to the side of her face. &#34;I just wanted to tell you that I love you,&#34; Buffy said placing another kiss on Willow's hand to accentuate her words, &#34;and to hurry back so that I can keep telling you that until you get absolutely sick of hearing it.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow leaned down and placed a sweet kiss on Buffy's lips.</p>

<p>&#34;I love you too, and I'll never get tired of hearing or telling you how much.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You better go, Giles is probably going nuts out there,&#34; Buffy said reluctantly letting go of Willows hand.</p>

<p>&#34;I'll be back,&#34; Willow said as she headed for the door.</p>

<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Buffy said nodding to convey her belief in the statement. But, at the same time her heart fluttered, and she sent a silent prayer to whoever wanted to listen that Willow would come back to her. &#34;Will?&#34; Buffy asked a moment later.</p>

<p>Willow turned around looking at her curiously.</p>

<p>&#34;Ask Giles to come in?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow nodded, then continued out the door.</p>

<p>Moments after Willow disappeared through the door, it opened once again and Giles came walking in. His head was down cast, and his steps slow and measured.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow said you wished to see me,&#34; Giles said finally looking up.</p>

<p>&#34;Yep,&#34; Buffy agreed. &#34;I did say that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What about?&#34; Giles asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you see, my mother has always told me that honesty is the best policy. So, in the spirit of that sentiment I just wanted to inform you that if anything happens to Willow on this mission I WILL kill you,&#34; Buffy related with a perfectly serious expression on her face.</p>

<p>&#34;I…see…&#34; Giles responded slowly.</p>

<p>&#34;That, and well…this,&#34; Buffy continued rolling her chair over to the bed and reaching down underneath. She pulled out a gym bag.</p>

<p>&#34;What's that?&#34; Giles asked walking over to Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;This,&#34; Buffy responded dramatically. &#34;Is me taking an active interest in my life,&#34; she continued unzipping the bag. &#34;Our little…chat…got me thinking. Granted it mostly got me thinking that you're a big jerk…but, it also got me thinking that you were a little, and I do mean a little, right about how I've been acting.&#34; As she said this she started unloading the contents of the bag. &#34;So, while I was in here wallowing after our…chat…I did some gathering. What you see here is…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Every flash light that I own,&#34; Giles supplied giving her one of his time-honored outraged looks that were always undermined by an inescapable amusement caused by the wonder of nature that was Buffy Summers.</p>

<p>&#34;Well yeah,&#34; Buffy agreed. &#34;But it's also your best chance at distracting this thing without using your bodies as giant targets. I've tired that, and believe me it's not the groovy idea that it might sound like.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Flashlights?&#34; Giles asked skeptically.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, flashlights,&#34; Buffy responded scowling at him. &#34;You see, as the only one in this room who has fought the demon, I managed to learn a few things. Firstly, the demon doesn't like light. Flash the flashlight on it and it's skin starts to sizzle…this equals major pain for it which should be a cause for the happies for you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Interesting,&#34; Giles said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#34;That's what I thought,&#34; Buffy agreed shoving the flashlights back into the bag. &#34;Secondly,&#34; she continued turning her attention back to Giles. &#34;It has a blind spot. If you get into trouble you'll want to maneuver yourself there. It's eyes on the sides of it's head, so if you…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Stand directly in front of it, it won't be able to see you,&#34; Giles finished for her.</p>

<p>&#34;Precisely,&#34; Buffy said in an effected British accent.</p>

<p>They were quiet for a moment as Buffy handed the bag over to Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;About what I said yesterday,&#34; Giles said looking down at Buffy. &#34;I was out of line,&#34; Giles went on. &#34;I don't think that I need to-wait, yes, yes I do. I care about you Buffy, and I know that I'm not your father, but you are like a daughter to me, and as aggravating as you can be, as bewildering, and confounding, and…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I get it,&#34; Buffy said interrupting. &#34;I'm difficult. Can we move on to the pro-Buffy side of the list, please?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, those things that I find the most curious about you, are also the things that I find most remarkable about you. And over the last few days, I was seeing the spark that I've come to associate with your resilience fade…and it worried me, and saddened me…so I did the only thing that I could think of to make it return. So, I reasoned to myself, if that spark came back as a result of deep, deep dislike, well, then the ends would justify the means.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wow, that kind of makes my 'sorry that I called you a jerk' seem kind of shabby in comparison,&#34; Buffy said smiling in response.</p>

<p>&#34;Make no mistake, that was my intention,&#34; Giles replied allowing himself a small grin. 'Well,&#34; Giles said a moment later. &#34;I should be going.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles,&#34; she called just as he reached the door. &#34;Remember, if she's hurt I WILL beat you to death with a shovel.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I suppose there's no longer a need to ask what my motivation should be,&#34; Giles responded before continuing out the door.</p>

<p>Once he was gone, Buffy dropped her head into her hands. She hated waiting.</p>

<p>&#34;You can't be bloody serious!&#34; Spike exclaimed looking at the object Giles had just thrust in his direction.</p>

<p>&#34;If he doesn't want it, I'll take it,&#34; Xander graciously volunteered.</p>

<p>&#34;I bet you would,&#34; Spike responded shooting Xander and irritated look, but hugging the flashlight closer to him nonetheless. &#34;Who was the git that came up with this brilliant idea anyway?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;In her former confrontation with the demon Buffy discovered the light damaged it,&#34; Giles responded shifting the sword he had flung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, and look how bloody well that turned out for her,&#34; Spike replied without missing a beat.</p>

<p>&#34;If you're too scared to go through with this, then just leave,&#34; Willow said speaking for the first time since the disagreement started.</p>

<p>&#34;Scared?! I'm William the goddamn Bloody and you think I'm scared of some cross-eyed, overgrown, newt?&#34; Spike declared clearly insulted. &#34;Well, sucks to that.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;William the Bloody, Attila the Hun…it doesn't change the fact that you're a yellow-bellied coward with hair to match. After all that Buffy's done for you-despite all reason-after all that we've all done for you, you still can't see past your own desires…fine I get it, you're evil. So I'm not going to pretend to be shocked or disappointed by your complete lack of a spine. But next time you're getting ready to impale yourself on a stake, don't expect anyone to come running to your rescue encouraging you to go on,&#34; Willow responded shaking her head-for despite what she said she was disappointed with the way Spike was acting. There was some decent part of the vampire, she was sure of it. Sure, that part was deeply hidden-deeply, deeply hidden- but she was certain that it existed. &#34;Come on,&#34; she said turning to Giles and Xander.</p>

<p>Spike watched them begin to walk away.</p>

<p>&#34;I didn't say I wasn't going to come!&#34; he called after them. &#34;I just question the wisdom of using a person who got their ass kicked as a template,&#34; he muttered under his breath as he jogged to catch up to them.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Giles took one last look at the map and directed them into the final tunnel that would take them to the final grotto of the caves. The walk had been silent, tense, and though Giles wouldn't admit it if someone asked-not that he actually expected anyone too-but he was looking forward to getting in there and making the demon pay for what it had done to all of them.</p>

<p>&#34;This it?&#34; Xander asked when Giles came to a stop.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;Lights on,&#34; he continued and dutifully all of them turned on their flashlights.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you going to count to three, or can we just bloody go in?&#34; Spike asked positively hopping up and down. He had been in much better spirits since finding out he could hurt demons-which wasn't by any means saying that he was in good spirits.</p>

<p>&#34;Let's go,&#34; Giles said waving his hand towards the opening.</p>

<p>Xander was the first into the opening, and just as he always wanted it WAS much in the style of John Wayne.</p>

<p>&#34;We've come to kick ass and chew bubble gum! And guess what, we're all out of bubble gum!&#34; Xander declared flashing the lights beam around the cave.</p>

<p>The moment he finished speaking, the room was filled with a wretched screeching sound, then the room erupted into a fury of motion.</p>

<p>Xander ducked under a burly tentacle-like appendage that was aimed directly for his head, and skittered off over to the side just barely avoiding becoming the headless Xand-man. Trying to regain his balance he just barely avoided knocking over Willow who was barely holding onto her already precarious state of balance behind him.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles man, have you got with the stabbing yet?!&#34; Xander yelled hurling himself and Willow out of the range of another bone-breaking punch that was all for them.</p>

<p>&#34;Patience is a virtue,&#34; Giles yelled back moments before getting knocked against the cave wall. &#34;I'll work faster,&#34; he muttered to himself pushing off the wall and twisting out of the way of another intended blow.</p>

<p>&#34;You okay Will?&#34; Xander asked getting off of her. His 'avoiding death' push, turned out to actually be an 'oh God don't let me die' shove that ended with him on top of Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;I will be once you g-e-t o-f-f!&#34; Willow said grunting slightly as she attempted to aid Xander in the removal process.</p>

<p>&#34;Righ…tttttttt!&#34; Xander started to respond before getting some more help from the Scheaklar which latched onto the back of his pants and pulled him up into the air.</p>

<p>&#34;One thing you have to admit,&#34; Spike yelled joining in after seeing Xander get flung around. &#34;It's got multi-tasking down to an art form,&#34; he went on ducking under a tentacle and coming up in front of the beast to start pummeling its head.</p>

<p>&#34;Pain, my new best friend,&#34; Xander groaned picking himself up off of the ground and stumbling back into the fray.</p>

<p>Giles who had managed to pull his sword from it's sheath charged the demon arching the blade above his head, before lowering the blade swiftly, cutting off the one of the demons limbs.</p>

<p>&#34;Why, I repeat, WHY are we not using our flash lights?!&#34; Giles yelled peevishly jumping out of the way of yet another counter attack.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I don't know…maybe because we're playing bumper cars WITHOUT THE BUMPERS!&#34; Xander responded. &#34;Again with the ouchy,&#34; he mumbled before getting knocked to the side again.</p>

<p>Ducking out of the way of a free flying feeler Willow spotted one of the abandoned flash lights and made a dive for it.</p>

<p>&#34;I would like to take a moment to reiterate my former statement,&#34; she said trying to turn the thing on, &#34;that we SHOULD have gone with Velcro wrist enforcements!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Perhaps,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;And this is only a suggestion…we could discuss this LATER!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhhh,&#34; Spike said giddily catching the flashlight Willow tossed to him. &#34;Somebody's in a mood.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Has everybody got one?&#34; Willow yelled ignoring Spike's statement. She had managed to locate the missing flashlights.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, yeah,&#34; Xander answered in an agitated voice. &#34;Let's turn 'em on, let's turn 'em on!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Concentrate the burst,&#34; Giles called out to them as he attempted to move around to the back of the beast. &#34;All three of you aim for one section and keep the blast there,&#34; he continued finally able to get himself behind.</p>

<p>Willow was the first to lock onto a spot. Seeing a red circle-which equaled target-on it's stomach Willow locked her beam there and watched as it started to sizzle. Xander was the next to lock on, then Spike--who finally managed to tear himself away from raining a shower of fists on the beast-aimed his flashlight with the others.</p>

<p>The cave was starting to fill with smoke, and the Scheaklar was in a considerable amount of pain. The damaged caused by the initial beam had more that quadrupled in size, and there was now a hole approximately the breadth of a head.</p>

<p>The Scheaklar was howling in pain now, trying to huddle into a protective ball. The talons it had been assaulting them with since the entered the cave were now being recalled into its body, and it was lowering onto it's hunches.</p>

<p>Giles waited until he was sure the demon was suitably distracted then he stealthily moved in on it. Drawing his sword he raised it above his head, and then without a moments hesitation he struck savagely, thrusting the blade in between the Scheaklars shoulder blades.</p>

<p>The demon reared up, expanding to its full height and width, it's tentacles extending out in all directions, once the blade was thrust into it. Giles, and the rest of the gang backed up against the walls when the beast started to revolt, endeavoring to wait out the outburst without getting injured.</p>

<p>&#34;I think it's dead,&#34; Xander commented once the beast had quieted down. It had been over a minute since it last moved.</p>

<p>Giles bent down and removed the knife he had strapped to his ankle.</p>

<p>&#34;How very James Bond of you,&#34; Spike commented as he walked over to the demon and started to kick it experimentally.</p>

<p>Giles ignored him and walked over to the body.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm going to need a little light,&#34; Giles said as he bent down over the body.</p>

<p>Buffy sat in the hallway staring at the front door to Giles's house. She had in fact been sitting in the hallway staring at the front door to Giles's house since the gang left the house three hours before, and every minute that she sat there felt like an eternity, and every minute that passed without them walking back through the door caused this stabbing sensation in Buffy's heart. It was like she was being killed a little at a time, like she was being stabbed to death by a tiny little knife. This vigil that she had been on was probably the hardest thing that she had ever had to do in her entire life. She was wired for inaction, she wasn't built to sit still, and be patient, and wait. She was the Slayer, she was suppose to move, she was suppose to act, and she was suppose to be out there. And not being able to do any on those things was almost as bad as knowing that her friends were out there fighting a demon to save HER life.</p>

<p>In addition-as if all of that wasn't enough to worry about-she was left to think about, and ponder, and doubt all of what had been happening between her and Willow since her injury, culminating with their talk shortly before the gang left. It was all very confusing to Buffy, everything was so new, and just when they started to figure out what was going on Willow was taken away from her. If there was like a scale-one being the lowest and 10 being the highest- that catalogued the worst moments that something could possibly happen this would have been a 9.9 on the scale.</p>

<p>Buffy had to admit, though, that it was quite fitting. If something had actually gone well she would have had to assume that hell had frozen over and would consequently have had move into a cabin in the interior of the mountains of Montana.</p>

<p>However, since all of that was mere conjecture and things hadn't gone well, hell hadn't frozen over, and Buffy didn't even like Montana, the Slayer was left with only one option. Sit. So that is exactly what she did.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Willow was the first one out of Giles's K-car, and by the time the others got out she was halfway through the courtyard and to the door. She could hear Giles calling to her but she didn't stop, she wanted to get inside. She wanted to get to Buffy. The last few meters to the door seemed to take forever. It was almost as if she was running in water. But finally, finally, she reached the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow gasped spotting the Slayer sitting in the hallway facing the door the moment she entered the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy breathed softly taking in her friends somewhat haggard appearance. &#34;Are you okay? You're…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm alright,&#34; Willow said cutting off Buffy. The worry was evident in her friend's voice and she wanted to alleviate it. &#34;Just a little banged up,&#34; Willow continued looking down at her state of disarray.</p>

<p>Buffy visibly relaxed once this piece of information was given. This was evidenced by a soft sigh escaping her lips.</p>

<p>&#34;You have no idea how glad I am to hear that,&#34; Buffy said finally.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I think that maybe I do,&#34; Willow responded, her mind going back to all of the times she had waited awake alone at night waiting for Buffy to come home from patrol.</p>

<p>&#34;Where are the others?&#34; Buffy asked looking past Willow to the still open door.</p>

<p>&#34;They're com…&#34; Willow managed to get out before the rest of the gang appeared at the doorway. &#34;…ing,&#34; Willow finished as the gang walked in.</p>

<p>&#34;If this is what the winning side looks like,&#34; Buffy commented able to observe all of them for the first time. &#34;I'd hate to see what the loser looks like.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I'd say it's feeling no pain,&#34; Spike said breezing into the house and ripping the overcoat from on top of him. It was just demeaning having to walk around like all of the time.</p>

<p>&#34;Did you get it?&#34; Buffy asked finally, not able to hold back on asking the question any longer.</p>

<p>In response Giles held up a small container with a fluorescent blue liquid inside. Buffy stared at the vile for a moment. Her heart was thundering in her chest, and her eyes locked on the glowing liquid. It was an odd sensation to be able literally see someone holding your future in their hands. Buffy had to say that it wasn't an all-together pleasant experience. It was equal parts terrifying and exhilarating.</p>

<p>Finally Giles lowered the vile breaking the spell.</p>

<p>&#34;Shall we?&#34; he asked looking directly at Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;I think we shall,&#34; the Slayer responded.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The gang congregated in Giles's bedroom, more specifically around Giles's bed. Buffy was lying on her stomach in the middle of the bed with the other gathered around her. Willow was sitting on the edge of the bed holding Buffy's hand while Giles prepared the syringe.</p>

<p>&#34;So,&#34; Buffy said in a somewhat choked voice. &#34;Tell me again how we're going to do this?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I,&#34; Giles said as he swished the liquid around, &#34;am going to pour the serum into a syringe. Then I'm going to inject the liquid into you spinal cord,&#34; the watcher continued calmly.</p>

<p>&#34;That's what I thought,&#34; Buffy said whimpering softly.</p>

<p>Willow leaned over so that her mouth was right beside Buffy's ear. What she wanted to do more than anything was hold Buffy in her arms and try to assure and reassure her-by any means necessary-that everything was going to be alright. She wanted to take Buffy in her arms and kiss away her fears. But, she knew that there, then, she couldn't do any of those things without raising more than a few eyebrows, so she settled for squeezing Buffy's hand and offering a few words of encouragement.</p>

<p>&#34;It'll be alright,&#34; Willow whispered softly. &#34;Giles knows what he's doing…you probably won't even feel a thing.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was about to thank Willow for at least attempting to make her feel better when she got a look at the size of the needle on the syringe Giles was preparing.</p>

<p>&#34;What is that?&#34; Buffy asked in voice squeaking in alarm. &#34;I mean, you better be planning on going Whaling later, because that harpoon isn't getting any closer to me or my spine,&#34; Buffy continued in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>&#34;It's perfectly safe,&#34; Giles responded meeting Buffy gaze. He was finished. &#34;Let's get on with it shall we.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, did anybody hear me say that harpoon is not getting any closer to me or my spine? I for distinctly remember saying it,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>Giles opened his mouth to respond but Willow beat him to it.</p>

<p>&#34;It'll be alright,&#34; the hacker said softly. &#34;You know it has to be done.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But…but look at it Will,&#34; Buffy said pleadingly. &#34;I've seen javelins that a smaller than that!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said tilting Buffy's face up so that she could see her eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Buffy responded dejectedly. &#34;But I'm warning you, I'm going to be grumpy after this. Very grumpy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Giles said. &#34;Now this won't take but a minute,&#34; he continued leaning over Buffy's back. &#34;You won't even,&#34; he said as he rested the needle against her skin, &#34;feel a thing…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&#34; Buffy hollered as he sunk the needle in. &#34;I SO felt that!!!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What are you thinking about?&#34; Willow asked looking over at Buffy who was facing the television but clearly not watching it.</p>

<p>The sun had just set and they were Giles's bedroom-which seemed to be their designated area of late-watching the television. An old episode of Star Trek the Next Generation was on, but Buffy had tuned it out. She had started to watch it, but then she gotten distracted by something shiny and when she turned back to television the crew was in Victorian England and she couldn't figure out how it happened.</p>

<p>&#34;Nothing really,&#34; Buffy responded looking over at Willow who was stretched out on the bed. Buffy, was seated in her chair beside the bed. &#34;My mind's as blank as…something that's blank a lot,&#34; Buffy continued lamely.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you feel anything?&#34; Willow asked watching her intently.</p>

<p>Giles had told them that the reaction from the serum wouldn't be immediate, he had guessed that it would take a number of hours, maybe even a day before Buffy began to get the use of her legs back.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment as she concentrated on taking stock of what her body was feeling. After a moment she looked over at Willow and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't think enough time has passed,&#34; Buffy said softly. The statement was true enough, but both of them really didn't care about the validity of the statement they just wanted Buffy to have her legs back.</p>

<p>Willow nodded.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, it's only been a couple of hours,&#34; she said lying back down but keeping her eyes fixed on Buffy. &#34;Why don't you come lie down?&#34; Willow asked. She could definitely use some snuggles.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy responded, but she sounded distracted and made no move to actually get on the bed. &#34;Before though…I just wanted to…&#34; she trailed off shaking her head at her own inability to just say what she meant. &#34;Could we just talk for a minute?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Willow said sitting up. There was a seriousness in Buffy's voice that made her apprehensive. Suddenly she found herself wondering Buffy was having second thoughts about what had happened between them in the morning. After Giles had made the injection, they had all sat around for while talking-actually they had all sat around and listened to Xander regale Buffy with a tale of his heroics-which hadn't really given Willow and Buffy a chance to talk about what they had done or said earlier. Then once Xander had gone home, and Spike had gone out to wallow at Willy's, Willow and Buffy had come back to the bedroom to rest. But, much to Willow's chagrin Buffy didn't seem to want to talk about what had happened between them, or of anything of significance really. After exhausting all the channels of useless chit chat they had access to they had settled into silence watching the television.</p>

<p>But that was almost an hour ago, and Willow needed to talk. She needed to find out what was going on inside of Buffy's head, and more importantly inside of Buffy's heart.</p>

<p>&#34;About what…happened this morning,&#34; Buffy started looking down at her stocking feet. &#34;I just…if this doesn't work, this serum thing, and I don't get my legs back, I just want you know that…&#34; she faltered here, not wanting to say the words she was going to, but feeling that they should be said. &#34;…that I won't hold you to what you said this morning. We can just pretend like it never happened,&#34; Buffy finished never lifting her eyes from her feet.</p>

<p>Willow stared at her for a moment in state of complete shock.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you really think that little of me? Of yourself?&#34; Willow asked a moment later. She had thought that her tone would have been angrier, but it wasn't, it was more disillusioned. She now understood why Buffy had been so reluctant to talk since they got back. She was afraid that if she didn't get her legs back, she wouldn't want her anymore. It was the most ridiculous thing Willow had ever heard, but it broke her heart.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at her finally when Willow posed those questions.</p>

<p>&#34;I…it has nothing to do with how much or how little I think of you, or myself,&#34; Buffy responded softly. &#34;I think the world of you…I love you,&#34; she continued plaintively. &#34;And I know that this,&#34; she said gesturing to her current position, &#34;couldn't have been what you had in mind when…if you ever considered what a relationship with me might be like.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow dropped down off of the bed after Buffy had finished speaking and knelt in front of the Slayer.</p>

<p>&#34;Obviously, those nights that I lay awake wondering what it would be like to be with you it wasn't like this,&#34; Willow started gesturing to their current situation. &#34;There was no reason to think of it like this…but it doesn't matter,&#34; she continued. &#34;It wasn't the being on a beach in Fiji part, or lying by the fire part of the dreams that was important…it was the being with Buffy part that made it magical,&#34; Willow said taking Buffy's hand into hers. &#34;And it's the being with Buffy part that's important now, and I am and it's wonderful,&#34; Willow went on in an reverent tone. &#34;I hope with all of my heart that this serum works, because I've spent a considerable amount of time thinking about all of the bad that will come if it doesn't and…but never, ever, would this or anything else change the way that I feel about you,&#34; she finished.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment after Willow finished speaking. There was just one last thing nagging at her, one last worry that she couldn't shake and for the life of her she didn't know how to bring it up in delicate way. It was just too…</p>

<p>&#34;Just…what if…you know I may…&#34; Buffy started to say, then she just stopped trying to bring herself together. &#34;What if I can't…you know…consummate the relationship?&#34; she asked her voice dropping to a whisper.</p>

<p>Willow smiled, that sweet, irresistible, sexy, completely Willow smile that could melt the hardest of hearts, even in deepest depths of a Siberian mineshaft in the middle of night in December.</p>

<p>&#34;Is that what you're really worried about?&#34; she asked softly.</p>

<p>&#34;Well,&#34; Buffy said a little defensively. &#34;There's also the not being able to save the world, and fight demons and stuff…I mean those are serious concerns as well,&#34; she went on avoiding Willow's gaze.</p>

<p>Willow stood up and lowered herself onto Buffy's lap. Something she seemed to be doing a lot of lately, and something they both seemed to be partial to. Buffy looked at her quizzically but didn't say anything as Willow settled herself. Once she was settled Willow leaned in and brought their lips together in a sweet, tender, passionate, hungry kiss that had both of them arching forward trying to increase the contact between them so that they could further devour each other. It was one of those all-consuming kisses where sparks erupted behind their eye lids and their hearts felt as if they would beat out their chests, and they weren't sure if they were in heaven or still on earth.</p>

<p>&#34;You feel that?&#34; Willow asked placing her hand over Buffy's heart once they broke apart.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded her answer trying to get her breathing under control.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't think that…consummation is going to be a problem,&#34; Willow said grinning. &#34;In fact I think we almost consummated a minute ago,&#34; she went on her grin taking on a lecherous leaning.</p>

<p>Buffy stared at Willow for a moment, then broke out into a huge smile and leaned forward resting her head against Willow's chest.</p>

<p>&#34;Tell me about it,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;I think I'm still consummating,&#34; she added chuckling. Her breathing still hadn't returned to it's regular routine and she doubted that as long as she was this close to Willow that it would.</p>

<p>&#34;Which brings me back to my original question,&#34; Willow commented planting a kiss on the top of Buffy's head.</p>

<p>&#34;You had a question?&#34; Buffy asked genuinely perplexed.</p>

<p>&#34;Why don't you come lie down,&#34; Willow clarified.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh that,&#34; Buffy responded tilting her head up so that she was looking up into Willow's eyes. &#34;I think that's a very good idea. Excellent actually.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy ran her hand up and down Willow's left side as their kiss gained momentum. Then, as her lips moved down to kiss Willow's jaw line her hand started to creep under Willow's shirt, and then back up again. This time flesh on flesh, creating a delicious friction. Willow arched up into Buffy's touch and a low moan escaped from somewhere deep in her throat setting Buffy's blood on fire. As her hand slowly made it's way up Willow's torso Buffy returned her lips to those of the hacker deepening the kiss as her hand gently traced the curve of Willow's breast.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh God,&#34; Willow groaned pushing forward into Buffy's body. She tore her lips away from the Slayer's and buried her head in the crook of Buffy's shoulder, kissing and nipping at the exposed skin there as Buffy explored the regions under her shirt.</p>

<p>Buffy responded by lifting Willow's shirt up a bit more to give herself better access. After placing a small kiss on Willow's cheek-which was the only part of the hackers face still visible to her-she devoted her full attention to manipulating the mound of flesh cupped in her hand.</p>

<p>Willow responded by raking her hand down Buffy's back and dragging them even closer together. As Buffy shifted them so that Willow was lying flat on her back and the Slayer was leaning over her Willow worked a hand under Buffy's tank top and began her own journey into the unknown. Buffy moaned and pushed down onto Willow seemingly trying to fuse their bodies together while doubling her own efforts.</p>

<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy said in a somewhat strangled voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh huh,&#34; Willow answered not really up to forming real words.</p>

<p>&#34;This has got to go,&#34; Buffy said fingering the material of Willow's shirt with her free hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh huh,&#34; Willow responded already starting to pull the tank top Buffy was wearing over her head.</p>

<p>Once the Slayer was suitably undressed-at least for the time being-Buffy concentrated on removing Willow shirt while trying not to lose contact with any part of the hackers body. It was a complicated task to say the least, but Buffy managed. Dedication and motivation will do that.</p>

<p>The moment Willow's shirt was over her head Buffy flung it across the room and returned her attention to Willow's neck which she rained sweet kisses on, before devoting her attention to sucking on Willow's pulse point while the red head raked her nails down Buffy's back while moaning her name.</p>

<p>Buffy slowly made her way down, kissing Willow's collar bone, and shoulders, until she finally made her way to valley in between her breasts. When Buffy concentrated her efforts there she could feel as well as hear Willow growl, and felt Willow's hips pushing up into hers.</p>

<p>Suddenly Buffy stopped what she was doing and froze.</p>

<p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Willow asked in a ragged tone of voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Shhhh,&#34; Buffy said bring a finger up to her lips. &#34;Be very, very quiet,&#34; she continued.</p>

<p>&#34;Wha…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, Willow!&#34; Giles called. Buffy could hear him approaching the bedroom. &#34;Dinner is ready,&#34; he continued still coming towards the room.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay, we'll be right there!&#34; Buffy yelled back hoping the footsteps would stop. They didn't.</p>

<p>&#34;It's quite alright, I need to come in anyway to get….&#34; The rest of his response was cut off.</p>

<p>&#34;You can't!&#34; Buffy yelled motioning for Willow to try and find their clothes. &#34;Willow's changing,&#34; Buffy went on ignoring the look Willow shot her. &#34;There's a half-naked teenager in here, that's a definite no for admittance,&#34; Buffy continued catching the shirt Willow threw at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Why is she changing?&#34; Giles asked in a perplexed tone. Buffy sighed in relieve, the footsteps had stopped.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh…she was wearing wool?&#34; Buffy responded though it sounded more like a question.</p>

<p>&#34;No she wasn't,&#34; Giles responded staring hard at the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Right,&#34; Buffy said pulling her shirt over her head. &#34;I meant she changing into something wool…she's cold,&#34; Buffy went on dragging her chair around so that she could get into it.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, it's over 80 degrees,&#34; Giles said a bit of irritation creeping into his voice.</p>

<p>&#34;She's sensitive to changes in temperature,&#34; Buffy said settling into her chair. &#34;Lights,&#34; Buffy whispered to Willow. &#34;Turn on some more lights.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I'm coming in now,&#34; Giles said opening the door. &#34;If she's not done then I'll apologize profusely.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Gil….whatever,&#34; Buffy responded. As Giles opened the door Willow hoped on the bed and turned on the television.</p>

<p>&#34;See,&#34; Giles said moving over to the closet. &#34;All's well that ends well,&#34; he continued. Then he turned and looked at Willow. &#34;That's what you had on this morning,&#34; he said squinting.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah…&#34; Willow said looking over at Buffy-it was, after all, her brilliant idea. &#34;Ah…&#34; she continued a moment later when Buffy offered no assistance.</p>

<p>&#34;Articulate as always I see,&#34; Giles responded deciding he didn't want to know what they had been doing. &#34;Like I said dinner has been served,&#34; he went on heading for the door. &#34;Oh, and you might want to open a window…you're both looking a little flushed,&#34; and with that he was gone.</p>

<p>Willow leaned back in her chair and immersed herself in an activity that was fast becoming her favorite pastime. It was a little game that she liked to call &#34;Buffy Gazing&#34;. The best part about the game was that it was almost sinfully easy. All that one had to do to win was, gaze at Buffy, and she could definitely handle that. Buffy was sitting across the table from her. They were all seated around Giles table in a very Brady moment. Giles and Buffy were engaged in an arduous discussion-and Willow used the term lightly-about the best ingredients to put on a Kabob. Willow had no idea how the conversation had arrived at such a topic of universal importance, and since she didn't really have anything useful to add the eloquent polemic taking place, she decided to Buffy gaze.</p>

<p>&#34;Is too,&#34; Buffy said leaning forward so that her face was only inches away from Giles's.</p>

<p>&#34;Is not,&#34; Giles's shot back not backing down. &#34;That didn't even make sense,&#34; he went on in a huffy tone. &#34;That wasn't even a point!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Buffy asked clearly outraged. &#34;That…that was entirely pointy!&#34; she continued emphatically.</p>

<p>&#34;You did it again,&#34; Giles said pointing a finger in her face. &#34;You're non-sensical...you're a non-sensical Slayer!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;A non-sensical Slayer?&#34; Buffy asked incredulously. &#34;And I'm the one who's not making any sense?&#34;</p>

<p>That was about the last of that compelling discussion Willow heard, for her Buffy gazing soon metamorphisized into a deep reflection of recent events. For the first time-in what felt like weeks, but had actually been days-Willow was able to sit back and reflect on the journey she had been through over the past few days-the horrors of it, the wonders of it, the uncertainty, the excitement, the beauty and ugliness of it all, starting on that one cold night. She had no idea that coming upon Buffy's body in that cemetery, lying there cold and motionless, would only the first of the horrors visited upon her that night and indeed in the days to follow.</p>

<p>Through no volition of her own, Willow found her mind wondering to the later hours of that night. In her minds eye she saw herself, and Xander struggling to hold down Buffy's protesting body as Giles attempted to bind her wound. It had without a doubt been one of the most horrific experiences in her entire life, and truly considering the things she had seen and done that was significant statement. Every time Buffy's body bucked, or shook, or whimpered, it felt to Willow as if she herself were being branded-for doing nothing to stop the pain, and for doing the only thing possible to stop the pain.</p>

<p>She remembered staying with Buffy after the others had left, and she remembered picking up the Slayers unmoving hand and bringing it to the side of her face before succumbing to sea of tears that had been threatening to overwhelm her from the moment she had first laid eyes on Buffy's prone form. She had sat there, leaning over Buffy's body crying, raging, and aching for the better part of an hour, trying to purge herself of the tumultuous emotions brewing inside of her and failing miserably to do so. It was true that sometimes a good cry helped, and it was also true that some times it was as useless a book left unread, or a pencil with a broken point-utterly, and wholly.</p>

<p>And then, joy of joys, Buffy had awoken. Bruised and beaten but not defeated she had awaken, and the angels had sung and Willow's heart had soared. In the company of doves, her heart had risen, had flown into the white of the clouds and the sun had shone upon her warming her formerly tortured soul. And there, wrapped together in as tender a moment as they had ever shared, verging on a closeness that had only ever been considered in the deepest depths of their unconscious minds and there buried before the light of day could encroach upon its edges, they had lay if not in blissful ignorance then in a state of happiness as close to it as one could get.</p>

<p>And then, horror of horrors, Buffy had fallen. And once again the dark, towering, mountains of gloom appeared above, over, and around them. Trapping them in yet another revolution of desolation.</p>

<p>But somehow, miraculously in those dark days, a bond already formed by years of friendship and devotion had been cemented, and furthermore augmented. Words had taken on deeper meanings, touches carried with them more serious connotations, and looks which before had been obscure and ambiguous at best began to take form and transform into something tangible, into something obtainable. In those days something beautiful was being born between them; it was phosphorescence in the dark, cruel depths of the ocean.</p>

<p>And now, here they were. Gathered around a table, in the home of a man both of them considered a father of sorts-and one certainly preferable to the contemptible examples of the species each of them had been given-sharing dinner and discussion. Willow found herself thinking that this was quite a remarkable near conclusion to all that had transpired erstwhile.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow?&#34;</p>

<p>The hacker was brought out of her musings by the sound of an impatient Slayer voice.</p>

<p>&#34;What's the up?&#34; Willow asked looking over at Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles wanted to know if you wanted…&#34; Buffy began but she paused, a positively libidinous smile working its way across her face, &#34;…dessert,&#34; she finished licking her lips.</p>

<p>Willow refusing to be baited meet Buffy's gaze and allowed an equally sensual smile to cross her own lips.</p>

<p>&#34;A truly inspired idea,&#34; she responded.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned, and they both turned to face Giles how was looking at them rather oddly.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well,&#34; he responded at a complete loss as to what he had just witnessed. &#34;How does Napoleon sound?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Is that a short joke?&#34; Buffy inquired without missing a beat.</p>

<p>Willow smiled. Somehow, through some mysterious, untenable impetus a feeling of rightness enveloped her. Everything would be all right, she was sure of it. Everything had to be all right, she reasoned, for that was the only suitable conclusion to the trek they had been taken on, so everything had to be all right. And would be.</p>

<p>Buffy turned her head and observed the people gathered in the room around her. Xander and Anya were lounging on Giles's couch both looking beyond bored, Spike was sitting in the left corner of the room sipping from a mug moodily, and Giles was standing just off to her side glaring at Spike. They were waiting for Willow to get back from school. The hacker hadn't wanted to leave Buffy's side but the Slayer had insisted. University wasn't like High School were attendance was really a courtesy to the tax payers. You could get kicked out for poor attendance and Buffy wasn't about to let that happen to Willow. As for herself, if the note they had written after hacking into the Sunnydale General mainframe worked, she would be excused for medical reasons. She didn't really want to think about the 'if not' or her mothers reaction to it.</p>

<p>&#34;I've mutilated corpses that were more fun than you blokes,&#34; Spike comment having finished his snack.</p>

<p>&#34;We could always play 'Shove the Stake in the Vampire',&#34; Buffy responded looking at him with a sweet smile. &#34;If you'd prefer.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The vampire's right,&#34; Anya said perking up. &#34;We could be having the sex now,&#34; she continued running her hand up Xander's-who had the decency to blush-chest.</p>

<p>&#34;Ix nay on the ex say,&#34; Xander responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Not that I wish to join the ranks of those who came before me,&#34; Giles started. &#34;But, is there a reason you've gathered us all. Other than to enjoy each others company that is?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;And as soon as Willow gets here everything will be made clear.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhh, somebody's been taking notes from the Cryptics Handbook,&#34; Spike said in response. &#34;At the hour of the wolf in the light of the crescent moon the truth of truths will be revealed and placed upon our feet for reflection and knowledge,&#34; he went on sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#34;You're a sad little man aren't you?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Spike was about to respond when Giles's front door opened and Willow breezed into the room. The books that had been in her hands were quickly discarded and she made a bee-line for Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Got your message,&#34; she said looking down at the Slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;Alright, I think it's about time to get this show on the road,&#34; the Slayer responded.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;I didn't have time to go through a trial run, so you'll have to excuse any minor technical difficulties,&#34; Buffy said addressing the group as she moved the chair backwards until all the occupants of the room were in front of her. Once she was positioned she hesitated for a moment praying that what she was about to do wouldn't end in an anti-climax, then she placed her hands on the arms of the chair bracing herself for what was about to come.</p>

<p>Everyone in front of Buffy watched with a baited breath as she slowly raised one foot, then the other and planted them on the floor. Everyone in the room waited with a breathless anticipation as Buffy used her braced arms to push up lifting herself out of the chair. And everyone in the rooms breath hitched as the now vertically inclined Slayer swayed slightly while looking down at her legs like a mother would a disobedient child.</p>

<p>Buffy stood looking down at her legs, her position precarious to say the least. She knew that there was only one of two outcomes to the situation and in the first few seconds she was upright she began to worry that it would be the &#34;fall flat on her ass&#34; outcome. However, as she felt herself began to steady she grinned mentally, sometimes being a Slayer didn't suck.</p>

<p>Looking up, the Scoobs became witnesses to an ecstatic, giddy, relieved, and mischievous smile. Buffy looked to all to be the cat who had swallowed the canary. And she was.</p>

<p>&#34;As my first official act of re-bipedal Dom,&#34; Buffy said focusing her attention on Spike. &#34;I decree,&#34; but instead of finishing her sentence she crossed the room as fast as her legs would carry her and slapped the vampire upside the head. &#34;That's for the Barbie crack,&#34; she explained backing away from Spike who by then was shaking with repressed rage.</p>

<p>Buffy then turned around to face the rest of the group, barely having enough time to spread her arms before Willow was in between them hugging her.</p>

<p>&#34;Group hug!&#34; Xander exclaimed wrapping himself around the girls only to be joined seconds later by Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;This is a bizarre ritual,&#34; Anya commented watching them all. &#34;Those are the best kind,&#34; she continued before jumping in as well.</p>

<p>&#34;Can't breathe,&#34; Buffy managed to choke out. She appreciated the effort, really she did, she just appreciated oxygen more.</p>

<p>&#34;Right.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Is that a problem?&#34;</p>

<p>Were the various responses as they all disentangled themselves from around her.</p>

<p>&#34;You guys got any plans for the rest of the day?&#34; Buffy asked grinning.</p>

<p>&#34;Actually there's a very interesting program on the mating habits of Atlantic salmon coming on the Discovery channel at…&#34; Giles trailed off when he received the looks the gang was shooting him. &#34;No plans at all,&#34; he said revising his answer.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and looked at Willow. Willow smiled and looked at Xander. Xander smiled and looked at Anya. Anya was fussing with her cuticles and didn't smile at anyone. Xander shrugged and smiled at Giles.</p>

<p>&#34;That's good,&#34; Buffy said once the game of visual 'telephone' was over. &#34;Cause I got some.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow turned around to look at Buffy who was lying across her bed, her legs dangling off the side holding a pink stuffed pig up in the air.</p>

<p>&#34;It's good to see you too Mr. Gordo,&#34; Buffy said in that voice reserved for infants and pets. She brought the pig to her ear. &#34;No I missed you more,&#34; she said moving it back to it's former position.</p>

<p>Willow smiled fondly at the display and crossed over to Buffy's bed. Buffy had the pig at her ear again.</p>

<p>&#34;Who kept me warm?&#34; Buffy asked the pig as if clarifying something. &#34;Willow,&#34; the Slayer informed the pig in a confidential tone. &#34;Yes, yes, I know it's about time,&#34; Buffy went on glaring at the pig. &#34;Smartass,&#34; she finished placing it on the pillow.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't let me interrupt,&#34; Willow said when Buffy turned to face her.</p>

<p>&#34;He was beginning to get surly anyway,&#34; Buffy responded before turning her attention to Willow, a soft smile working its way across her face. Buffy patted the spot beside her on the bed. &#34;I won't bite,&#34; she said staring at Willow how was studying the spot where Buffy's hand lay with a positively scholarly interest. &#34;Unless you're into that sort of thing,&#34; Buffy added a moment later smirking.</p>

<p>Willow looked over at her with a suddenness that made Buffy wonder if her banter was bang on. Willow opened her mouth as if to respond but them instead of speaking she closed her mouth and walked over to the bed where she lay down beside Buffy. Once horizontal Willow shifted to get closer to Buffy but her progress was impeded. Buffy looked down at the object that was separating them. Reaching out she picked up the fuzzy pink toy otherwise known as Mr. Gordo and hurled him across the room. With that out of the way they proceeded to snuggles with no further interruption.</p>

<p>&#34;It's funny,&#34; Buffy comment as she felt Willow relax against her.</p>

<p>&#34;What is?&#34; Willow asked sighing contentedly.</p>

<p>&#34;I almost can't remember what it was like to go to sleep without you beside me,&#34; Buffy respond. And she wasn't just saying that to act like a romantic cheese ball either, it was the absolute truth.</p>

<p>Willow tilted her head up until she was looking into Buffy's eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;I know what you mean,&#34; she responded softly. &#34;It's like…like it was kismet…like we've just been waiting for this all along.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment, then she raised an unsteady hand to the side of Willow's cheek and tenderly stroked the soft skin underneath her fingers.</p>

<p>&#34;I want to make love to you so much that it hurts,&#34; Buffy breathed out in a half whisper, half moan.</p>

<p>&#34;Well…I don't want you to be in pain,&#34; Willow responded in a slightly deeper voice than usual as she leaned into Buffy's touch. &#34;I think that we should do something to fix this situation.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I did promise you…consummation, didn't I?&#34; Buffy asked smiling in an involuntarily sensual way.</p>

<p>Willow smiled back up at her with a like expression and then leaned up bringing their lips together in an vibrant kiss that pulsed through their bodies starting at their joined lips and traveled throughout the rest of their bodies to the tips of their toes, leaving a trail of fire behind it that had them both quivering and gasping for air by the time they separated.</p>

<p>Buffy, who recovered first, pushed up onto her elbows and gently lay Willow down so that the hacker was flat on her back and leaned over her looking down at her with the sweetest, almost reverent expression on her face. Then, as if finally unable to contain the emotions flowing inside for a moment longer, she bent her head down and brought their lips together with an intensity that neither shocked or surprised either of them. Quite the opposite in fact, they both welcomed it. Craved it. It was the actualization of years of renounced and constrained love, lust, desire, want and need. It was the merging of two hearts, and it was violent, tender, beautiful and a myriad of other sensations that defy description.</p>

<p>Their hands roamed each others bodies, exploring and manipulating flesh along the way, removing clothes and discovering curves and they sought to fuse themselves together. Lips caressesed skin, and bodies arched into each other in a choreography as familiar to them as their own hands without ever having had to learn the steps. Tender words, and impassioned moans of ecstasy where released and received in kind. Slick bodies ground against each other, pushing and receiving, arcing and giving, taking and receiving, until in that last glorious moment they joined together one last time in a state of absolute rapture.</p>

<p>Buffy placed a soft kiss on Willow's shoulder, then followed that one kiss up by kissing her way up Willow's neck, then her jaw line, before finally coming to a stop on the hackers lips, which she explored thoroughly, though leisurely.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't feel my body,&#34; Buffy mumbled as she separated her lips from Willow's.</p>

<p>&#34;I LOVE to feel your body,&#34; Willow responded gutturally as her eyes started to shut. Then she seemed to realize what she had said and how she had said it causing her eyes to pop open and gape at Buffy.</p>

<p>The Slayer smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;After what we just did, I don't think that's gape worthy,&#34; Buffy responded gently. &#34;I'm quite fond of your body too,&#34; she continued smiling.</p>

<p>Willow responded by reaching out and tentatively placing her hand on Buffy's stomach caressing the skin there and being thoroughly absorbed doing it before slipping her hand around to the Slayers back and pulling her into a hug that Buffy willingly surrendered to.</p>

<p>&#34;It's like being in a dream,&#34; Willow said softly as they snuggled together. Her hand unconsciously tracing patterns on the Slayers back.</p>

<p>&#34;It's better than a dream,&#34; Buffy said as Willow rested her head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>They lay there together in a comfortable silence reveling in the warmth of their joined bodies and the feelings their closeness created within them.</p>

<p>&#34;I was thinking,&#34; Buffy said just as Willow as about to drift off to sleep.</p>

<p>&#34;About what?&#34; the hacker asked sleepily.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you think you're going to be needing your bed anymore?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Willow asked suspiciously. She had heard this tone from Buffy before and it never led to anything good.</p>

<p>&#34;I've always wanted a trampoline,&#34; Buffy said smiling. &#34;I think that one would look very nice over there. Plus, practice for my flips…well, once I learn how to do some flips.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow batted her in the stomach.</p>

<p>&#34;It was just a thought,&#34; Buffy responded before ducking her head to kiss Willow as a peace offering.</p>

<p>&#34;Think of something else,&#34; Willow replied her voice a mere whisper as her eyes closed.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, ma'am,&#34; Buffy said softly before placing a kiss on Willow's forehead and allowing her own eyes to close.</p>
