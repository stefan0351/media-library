<!-- The Closet \ Part Three -->

<p>Sam looked up and over at the girl next to her, an expression of
extreme annoyance covering her features.  Her nostrils flared and she
rolled her tongue about in her cheek as she observed Brooke.</p>

<p>"I know!" the blonde exclaimed into her Fido excitedly.  "I know!"
she repeated making the two words last at least twice as long as they
should have.  "I know, I know," she continued smiling and nodding her
head.  "I…"</p>

<p>"If you say `I know' one more time I will personally rip that phone
out of your hand and beat you with it," Sam interrupted, barely
restraining herself from reaching out and shaking the blonde.  "Know
that," she continued letting out a shuddering breath.</p>

<p>"Uh oh. Spam alert, Spam alert," could suddenly be heard coming from
the front of the bus.  "Abort mission, no equipment for a bitter, old
hag attack."</p>

<p>Sam braced her hands on the arms rests and raised herself up so that
she could see over the seats in front her.  Turning her attention to
the front of the bus she spotted Nicole looking back at her with a
smile on her.  Sam glared at the blonde for a moment and then sat
down.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Nicole whispered to herself with a smile as she turned
back around to face forward.  It was then that she felt eyes on
her.  "What are you staring at Shaggy?" she asked turning to face
Harrison who quickly averted his eyes to avoid being turned to stone.</p>

<p>Mary Cherry bounced in seat practically dying  because she was so far
away from the action.  As she watched Nicole turn her wrath on Joe a
small whimper escaped from between her lips.  She was suffering from
withdrawal pains, it felt like all of her organs were shriveling up
into little raisin sized morsels.  She didn't like being surrounded
by brunettes at all, the had an earthy, rustic smell to them that
disturbed sophisticated sensibilities.  Feeling lower than Charlize
Theron after she wore the same pantsuit as Charisma Carpenter Mary
Cherry turned her attention to Lil' Lily and suddenly she felt better.</p>

<p>Lily sensed Mary Cherry's eyes on her and shuddered.  Oh lord, not
again, Lily thought to herself.  The southerner had actually left her
alone for ten minutes or so, but that was about to change, Lily could
feel it building up like a tropical storm.  Hesitantly, almost
painful she turned her head so that she could see Mary Cherry.  The
blonde was sitting up straight and had her head craned at an odd
angle; when she noticed Lily watching her she smiled and licked her
lips winking at Lily suggestively.  The brunette watched in a state
of confusion before she finally realized that with the angle Mary
Cherry was leaning at the blonde could see down her shirt.  She
shuddered again, her hands gripping the arm rests like they were the
last bottle of Evian in the Sahara desert.  Then as she saw Mary
Cherry begin to dig into her leather carry on bag, panic gripped her
and she frantically turned around looking behind her.  She had to
escape.</p>

<p>"Lookie what I got Lil' Lily," Mary Cherry said drawing Lily's
attention back to her.  </p>

<p>Lily shook her head and began to mouth "no, no" over again before
suddenly standing up and running to the end of the bus where she
locked herself in the washroom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Brooke turned her head to look at Sam who was still watching her with
an expression that could peel paint.  The brunette's death stare had
been momentarily broken when she turned to watch Lily run through the
aisle, but she was now back at it with a renewed vigor.  Raising her
hand up Brooke pointedly clicked her phone off, the small screen
going black with a little beep.  "Not that I didn't enjoy the threats
of bodily injury," Brooke started in a soft tone, "but all you had to
do was ask," she continued turning away from Sam and slumping back in
her chair slightly.</p>

<p>Sam looked over at Brooke, feeling genuinely ashamed.  Sometimes she
was just so Joan Crawford not even she could stand it.  "I'm sorry,"
Sam said softly as she too slumped back in her chair moodily.  She
was surprised at how easily the words fell out of her mouth, though
she considered that with the thoughts that had been running through
her head lately she shouldn't really have been.</p>

<p>"I was just bored," Brooke mumbled a minute later breaking the
silence that had arisen between the two of them after Sam spoke.  Sam
looked over at her but didn't say anything.  "And I think we both
know that you weren't exactly an option," she continued as her eyes
traced the contours of the roof idly.</p>

<p>"That's not true," Sam muttered under her breath as she picked at one
of her nails, her eyes flickering to observe Brooke's profile
nonetheless.  Brooke didn't respond to her verbally, but Sam did she
her loll her head to the side and roll her eyes dramatically.  She
frowned.</p>

<p>"That was mature," Sam commented, moody once more.</p>

<p>Brooke turned to look at her, a mildly amused expression on her
face.  "You're the one that threatened to beat me to death with my
phone and you're question my maturity level?" she asked.  Instead of
responding Sam returned to picking at her nails.  "You know, you can
act as pissy as you want to, but you know you wouldn't have talked to
me," Brooke continued.  This comment caused Sam to look over at her,
not so much because of what she said but because of how she said it.
There was something in Brooke's voice, an accusation, a sadness that
Sam couldn't help but acknowledge.</p>

<p>"Even if I wanted to talk to you," Sam started somewhat defensively,
though she didn't exactly know why, "what could we possibly have
talked about?  I know that I'm personally at a loss as to what could
out do that no doubt mentally exhausting `I know' conversation."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Brooke responded turning to face Sam.  "Maybe
Herman Melville's condemnation of consumer society as can be seen in
his little appreciated work `Bartleby, the Scrivener'."</p>

<p>Sam's lips parted in her surprise and her brows scrunched
together.  "I…" she started to say.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Brooke interrupted turning away once more.  "I've
decided to re-organize my make-up case."</p>

<p>Sam stared at her for a moment longer, her mind trying to come to
grasps with the fact that, one, Brooke knew who Herman Melville was,
let alone was able to comment on the themes of one of works, and two,
that she commented on the condemnation of consumer society and then
decided to re-organize her make-up case.  Shaking her head, she
turned around and looked out the window.  Screw Brooke, she didn't
really want to talk to her anyway.</p>
