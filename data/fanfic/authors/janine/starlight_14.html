<!-- Starlight \ Part 14 -->

<p>Buffy ran her hand up and down Willow's left side as their kiss gained momentum. Then, as her lips moved down to kiss Willow's jaw line her hand started to creep under Willow's shirt, and then back up again. This time flesh on flesh, creating a delicious friction. Willow arched up into Buffy's touch and a low moan escaped from somewhere deep in her throat setting Buffy's blood on fire. As her hand slowly made it's way up Willow's torso Buffy returned her lips to those of the hacker deepening the kiss as her hand gently traced the curve of Willow's breast.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh God,&#34; Willow groaned pushing forward into Buffy's body. She tore her lips away from the Slayer's and buried her head in the crook of Buffy's shoulder, kissing and nipping at the exposed skin there as Buffy explored the regions under her shirt.</p>

<p>Buffy responded by lifting Willow's shirt up a bit more to give herself better access. After placing a small kiss on Willow's cheek-which was the only part of the hackers face still visible to her-she devoted her full attention to manipulating the mound of flesh cupped in her hand.</p>

<p>Willow responded by raking her hand down Buffy's back and dragging them even closer together. As Buffy shifted them so that Willow was lying flat on her back and the Slayer was leaning over her Willow worked a hand under Buffy's tank top and began her own journey into the unknown. Buffy moaned and pushed down onto Willow seemingly trying to fuse their bodies together while doubling her own efforts.</p>

<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy said in a somewhat strangled voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh huh,&#34; Willow answered not really up to forming real words.</p>

<p>&#34;This has got to go,&#34; Buffy said fingering the material of Willow's shirt with her free hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh huh,&#34; Willow responded already starting to pull the tank top Buffy was wearing over her head.</p>

<p>Once the Slayer was suitably undressed-at least for the time being-Buffy concentrated on removing Willow shirt while trying not to lose contact with any part of the hackers body. It was a complicated task to say the least, but Buffy managed. Dedication and motivation will do that.</p>

<p>The moment Willow's shirt was over her head Buffy flung it across the room and returned her attention to Willow's neck which she rained sweet kisses on, before devoting her attention to sucking on Willow's pulse point while the red head raked her nails down Buffy's back while moaning her name.</p>

<p>Buffy slowly made her way down, kissing Willow's collar bone, and shoulders, until she finally made her way to valley in between her breasts. When Buffy concentrated her efforts there she could feel as well as hear Willow growl, and felt Willow's hips pushing up into hers.</p>

<p>Suddenly Buffy stopped what she was doing and froze.</p>

<p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Willow asked in a ragged tone of voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Shhhh,&#34; Buffy said bring a finger up to her lips. &#34;Be very, very quiet,&#34; she continued.</p>

<p>&#34;Wha…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, Willow!&#34; Giles called. Buffy could hear him approaching the bedroom. &#34;Dinner is ready,&#34; he continued still coming towards the room.</p>

<p>&#34;Okay, we'll be right there!&#34; Buffy yelled back hoping the footsteps would stop. They didn't.</p>

<p>&#34;It's quite alright, I need to come in anyway to get….&#34; The rest of his response was cut off.</p>

<p>&#34;You can't!&#34; Buffy yelled motioning for Willow to try and find their clothes. &#34;Willow's changing,&#34; Buffy went on ignoring the look Willow shot her. &#34;There's a half-naked teenager in here, that's a definite no for admittance,&#34; Buffy continued catching the shirt Willow threw at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Why is she changing?&#34; Giles asked in a perplexed tone. Buffy sighed in relieve, the footsteps had stopped.</p>

<p>&#34;Uh…she was wearing wool?&#34; Buffy responded though it sounded more like a question.</p>

<p>&#34;No she wasn't,&#34; Giles responded staring hard at the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Right,&#34; Buffy said pulling her shirt over her head. &#34;I meant she changing into something wool…she's cold,&#34; Buffy went on dragging her chair around so that she could get into it.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy, it's over 80 degrees,&#34; Giles said a bit of irritation creeping into his voice.</p>

<p>&#34;She's sensitive to changes in temperature,&#34; Buffy said settling into her chair. &#34;Lights,&#34; Buffy whispered to Willow. &#34;Turn on some more lights.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I'm coming in now,&#34; Giles said opening the door. &#34;If she's not done then I'll apologize profusely.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Gil….whatever,&#34; Buffy responded. As Giles opened the door Willow hoped on the bed and turned on the television.</p>

<p>&#34;See,&#34; Giles said moving over to the closet. &#34;All's well that ends well,&#34; he continued. Then he turned and looked at Willow. &#34;That's what you had on this morning,&#34; he said squinting.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah…&#34; Willow said looking over at Buffy-it was, after all, her brilliant idea. &#34;Ah…&#34; she continued a moment later when Buffy offered no assistance.</p>

<p>&#34;Articulate as always I see,&#34; Giles responded deciding he didn't want to know what they had been doing. &#34;Like I said dinner has been served,&#34; he went on heading for the door. &#34;Oh, and you might want to open a window…you're both looking a little flushed,&#34; and with that he was gone.</p>
