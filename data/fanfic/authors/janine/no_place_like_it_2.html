<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 2 -->

<p><b>2014 - Chicago</b></p>

<p>"The lawyer's here," Monica said placing a
hand on her new boss's shoulder as she came up behind the preoccupied woman.</p>

<p>"Name?" Katie asked softly, her voice
semi-distracted as she continued to stare at the painting in front of her. It was an
Urbane, the work of formerly new, and young, talented young artist who had recently died
in a tragic rock climbing accident. He had promised the painting to her, back when he was
still a nobody - before he was gone and everyone suddenly decided that he was
brilliant - and now she was in a battle with the gallery that had supposedly bought
all the rights to his work.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Monica replied biting her
bottom lip. She really should have thought to ask.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," Katie sighed turning
around to face her new assistant. "We'll find out soon enough, won't
we?" she said with a smile small giving the woman a reassuring pat on the back. She
was just a kid really, fresh out of college with virtually no experience doing anything,
and so far she hadn't really been of any assistance, but Katie had a feeling about
her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I should have," the girl started
to say.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," Katie interrupted
smiling at the girl warmly. "Come on."</p>

<p align="center">**********</p>

<p>"Sorry to have kept you waiting," Katie said
breezing into the lobby of the gallery. Just up ahead of her in front of one of the
exhibits she could see a blonde woman in a suit. Her posture seemed familiar, but the
woman's back was too her, and all lawyers tended to blur together to her anyway.
"I'm Kathryn Singer the galleries new owner," she continued, "and the
first thing I'd like to officially do is thank you for coming on such..." she
continued before her face halted in surprise as the woman turned around to face her.
"Short notice," she finished, her voice barely a whisper as she stared at the
woman in front of her. Jessie.</p>

<p>Jessie blinked rapidly as she tried to get her heartbeat
back to non- critical levels. When she'd heard the voice talking to her from across
the gallery, she'd thought that it sounded familiar and it had even called up an
image in her mind of the girl that a similar voice had belonged to, but she had chalked it
up to mental delusion on her part, until the woman had announced her name. Kathryn Singer,
Katie Singer. And now she was standing in front of the girl, no woman, they both very much
grown now, whom she had once thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with.</p>

<p>"Katie," Jessie responded finally, realizing that
she had been silent for far too long as the woman to Katie's left looked at her
inquisitively. Her voice cracked as she uttered the word and felt like wincing, but
controlled the urge. "I didn't know you were back in town," she continued
feeling the need to get her mind off of her verbal faux pas before she started to blush.</p>

<p>"I haven't been," Katie replied, her eyes
roaming over Jessie's face. "Not for long. I only got back two weeks ago and I
haven't had time to inform the grapevine," she continued, her inspection of
Jessie continuing down. She looked almost exactly the same as Katie remembered her,
slightly older - which only meant that her features had become sharper and more
dignified - and she was wearing new, powerful clothes, but other than that, she
looked to be the same old Jessie. Expressive blue eyes, just as deep and captivating as
ever, same blonde hair tied back into a ponytail, same trim body - fuller than it had
been when they first met, but the same size as far as she could tell from the last time
they saw each other - and the same luscious, glossy lips promising to brand somebody
for life.</p>

<p>"Grapevine moves a lot slower now anyway," Jessie
replied, feeling Katie's eyes on her and shifting uncomfortably, before carrying out
her own assessment of the woman in front of her. Katie's green eyes were still
sparkling with the promise of mischief, and her dirty-blonde hair remained it's
natural colour - which was becoming rarer and rarer -- hanging around her shoulders
loosely though it was a different style, and slightly shorter than Jessie remembered. She
was dressed in a tastefully retro style that oozed simplicity and cool, but without any of
the odor of effort that usually accompanied such outfits.</p>

<p>"Only thing that is," Katie responded her eyes
flickering to the small black receiver pinned to Jessie's lapel, the evolution of
cell phones. "This is Monica Mason," she said finally drawing her eyes away from
Jessie and turning to face her assistant who was watching them and feeling quite out of
place.</p>

<p>"Jessie Sammler," Jessie responded automatically
smiling and extending her hand to the other woman. "It's a pleasure to meet
you."</p>

<p>"You too Ms. Sammler," Monica replied grasping
Jessie's hand.</p>

<p>"Jessie," she corrected gently. "I imagine
we'll be seeing quite a bit of each other," she continued once again knowing
instinctively that Katie was studying her. When they were still together, she'd
developed a kind of sixth sense that allowed her to know whenever her girlfriend's
eyes were on her, she could pick Katie out in a crowded room because of it. Apparently
sixth senses didn't just fade with time.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see it?" Katie asked, drawing
Jessie's attention back over to her.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked blinking; Katie's hands
had distracted her. One of them was playing distractedly with a ring she wore on her
finger, a ring Jessie recognized because she had given it to her.</p>

<p>"The painting," Katie replied calmly, though her
hands stopped fidgeting and she placed her hands behind her back, clasping them together
loosely. She knew that Jessie had seen the ring, and it embarrassed her for some reason.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," Jessie replied looking up into
Katie's face once the woman had placed her hands behind her back, thus ending
Jessie's study of them. "I think so. Yes," she continued bending over
slightly to pick up her briefcase.</p>

<p>"This way," Katie said waving grandly in the
direction that she had come from minutes before, though it now seemed like much longer
than that. "I think that you'll enjoy it."</p>
