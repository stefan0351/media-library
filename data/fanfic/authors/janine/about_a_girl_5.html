<p><u><i>Manning House - Dinner</i></u></p>

<p>"What's that you're working on?" Lily asked looking over at Grace who  was vigorously scratching something onto a piece of paper.  Almost  from the moment they had sat down for dinner Grace had been  scribbling on that sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Just some paper work for the GSA dance," Grace responded barely  looking up from her sheet of paper, and as such missing the look her  mother sent her husband.  "It's coming up in a couple of weeks,"  Grace continued looking up, her attention focused on Jessie who was  sitting opposite her.  "It'll be a great opportunity for people to  freely express how they feel about each other in a healthy, positive  way."</p>

<p>"Ouch!" Rick gasped a moment later reaching down under the table to  rub his leg.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Jessie said wincing as she realized she'd kicked the wrong  person.  "Muscle cramp."</p>

<p>Rick looked up at her upon hearing this, his expression both  surprised and proud.  "That's quite a leg you've got there."  But  Jessie had ceased paying attention to him so that she could  concentrate on giving Grace the stink eye.</p>

<p>"Will you be attending the dance?" Lily asked trying to keep her  voice nonchalant.</p>

<p>"Well, I did plan it.  It's kind of my duty," Grace responded as if  that was the stupidest question she'd ever heard.</p>

<p>"Do you know who'll be attending yet?" Lily asked trying to calm her  breathing.</p>

<p>"No, but there's a couple people I'd like to see there," Grace  replied pointedly.</p>

<p>"Oh," Lily responded not quite sure what to make of that.</p>

<p>"Is Jessie gonna go?" Zoë asked feeling as though it was time that  she contribute to the conversation.  Lily looked over at Jessie after  hearing Zoë's question never having considered whether Jessie would  be attending or not.</p>

<p>"What?!" Zoë screeched a moment later.  Jessie had muttered something  under her breath but she hadn't been able to make it out.</p>

<p>"I said `maybe'," Jessie ground out glancing at Zoë before returning  her attention to playing with her mashed potatoes.</p>

<p> "It's nice of you to think about supporting Grace like that," Lily  responded with a smile upon hearing Jessie's answer, causing her to  miss the peevish look Grace sent her.</p>

<p>Jessie considered Lily's comment, and Grace's answering look for a  moment, then gave a small smile and nodded before quickly shoving  some food in her mouth so that she wouldn't have to talk anymore.</p>

<p>"What?" Lily asked finally sensing Grace staring at her.  Grace  simply turned away from her and began to write on her piece of paper  some more.  "What?" she asked again, but it was futile.</p>

<p>"Are girls allowed to play football now?" Rick asked looking at  Jessie appraisingly having finally stopped rubbing at his leg.</p>

<p>"I'm not playing football," Jessie responded around a mouthful of  potato.</p>

<p> "I'm just saying, that with a leg like that you should be kicking  something regularly," Rick responded diplomatically.  Jessie stared  at him then turned away back to her food covering the room in an  oppressive silence.</p>

<p>"So, how was your day?" Lily asked turning to look at her youngest  daughter.  Grace and Jessie sighed, they just knew they were going to  have to listen to a speech about bacon and global warming until Zoë  got bored and decided to go watch cartoons.  It was going to be a fun  meal.</p>

<p><u><i>Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie paused outside of her brother's room, debating the wisdom of  talking to him about something that was even mildly important to her  before finally knocking.</p>

<p>Entering the room, she headed straight for his bed and plopped  down.  "What cha doing?"</p>

<p>Eli looked down at the guitar in his hands, then over at the sheet  music in front of him and then back at his sister.  "Playing soccer,"  he responded dryly.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed heavily and rolled over on her side not at all  impressed by his attempt at humor.  "What's wrong with you?" he asked  taking in her rather petulant expression.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Jessie responded glumly thinking that she shouldn't have  bothered with him.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong, you never come in here and lie down with the  pouty face unless something's wrong," Eli replied really paying  attention for the first time.  This wasn't like one of Jessie's (or  any girl for that matter) normal mood swings.  Something was really  getting to her.</p>

<p>"Nothing's wrong," Jessie repeated picking at his comforter  militantly.</p>

<p>"Fine" Eli responded starting to strum again.  He wasn't going to  argue with her when she got like this.  If she came to his room, she  obviously wanted to talk and would get around to it sooner or later.   In the meantime he was perfectly happy to go on about his business.</p>

<p>Jessie glanced over at him a minute later seeing him happily plucking  away and frowned. "There's this person," she started interrupting  him.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli prompted putting his pick down and turning to face her.</p>

<p>"Well, what if there's this person that likes you, and you like them  only they know that you like them but they don't know that you like  them as much as they like you, and you want to tell them how much you  like them but you're also not sure what it means that you like them  as much as you do," Jessie asked sitting up slowly as she began to  talk before looking at him expectantly.</p>

<p>"I'm not even sure whether that was a question or not," Eli finally  responded his brows coming together in confusion.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed at his ignorance and flopped back down on the bed,  clearly finding him to be no help at all.</p>

<p>"But I did understand about a third of it," he continued ignoring his  sisters melodramatics, "and if this person likes you and you like  them, you should just tell them.  Carpe diem Scout, you gotta hold on  to the important stuff when you still have it."</p>

<p>"Carpe diem," Jessie responded thoughtfully, rolling her eyes up to  the ceiling contemplatively.  Carpe diem.</p>
