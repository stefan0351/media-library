<!-- Starlight \ Part 12 -->

<p>Buffy sat in the hallway staring at the front door to Giles's house. She had in fact been sitting in the hallway staring at the front door to Giles's house since the gang left the house three hours before, and every minute that she sat there felt like an eternity, and every minute that passed without them walking back through the door caused this stabbing sensation in Buffy's heart. It was like she was being killed a little at a time, like she was being stabbed to death by a tiny little knife. This vigil that she had been on was probably the hardest thing that she had ever had to do in her entire life. She was wired for inaction, she wasn't built to sit still, and be patient, and wait. She was the Slayer, she was suppose to move, she was suppose to act, and she was suppose to be out there. And not being able to do any on those things was almost as bad as knowing that her friends were out there fighting a demon to save HER life.</p>

<p>In addition-as if all of that wasn't enough to worry about-she was left to think about, and ponder, and doubt all of what had been happening between her and Willow since her injury, culminating with their talk shortly before the gang left. It was all very confusing to Buffy, everything was so new, and just when they started to figure out what was going on Willow was taken away from her. If there was like a scale-one being the lowest and 10 being the highest- that catalogued the worst moments that something could possibly happen this would have been a 9.9 on the scale.</p>

<p>Buffy had to admit, though, that it was quite fitting. If something had actually gone well she would have had to assume that hell had frozen over and would consequently have had move into a cabin in the interior of the mountains of Montana.</p>

<p>However, since all of that was mere conjecture and things hadn't gone well, hell hadn't frozen over, and Buffy didn't even like Montana, the Slayer was left with only one option. Sit. So that is exactly what she did.</p>

<p>Willow was the first one out of Giles's K-car, and by the time the others got out she was halfway through the courtyard and to the door. She could hear Giles calling to her but she didn't stop, she wanted to get inside. She wanted to get to Buffy. The last few meters to the door seemed to take forever. It was almost as if she was running in water. But finally, finally, she reached the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow gasped spotting the Slayer sitting in the hallway facing the door the moment she entered the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Will,&#34; Buffy breathed softly taking in her friends somewhat haggard appearance. &#34;Are you okay? You're…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm alright,&#34; Willow said cutting off Buffy. The worry was evident in her friend's voice and she wanted to alleviate it. &#34;Just a little banged up,&#34; Willow continued looking down at her state of disarray.</p>

<p>Buffy visibly relaxed once this piece of information was given. This was evidenced by a soft sigh escaping her lips.</p>

<p>&#34;You have no idea how glad I am to hear that,&#34; Buffy said finally.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I think that maybe I do,&#34; Willow responded, her mind going back to all of the times she had waited awake alone at night waiting for Buffy to come home from patrol.</p>

<p>&#34;Where are the others?&#34; Buffy asked looking past Willow to the still open door.</p>

<p>&#34;They're com…&#34; Willow managed to get out before the rest of the gang appeared at the doorway. &#34;…ing,&#34; Willow finished as the gang walked in.</p>

<p>&#34;If this is what the winning side looks like,&#34; Buffy commented able to observe all of them for the first time. &#34;I'd hate to see what the loser looks like.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I'd say it's feeling no pain,&#34; Spike said breezing into the house and ripping the overcoat from on top of him. It was just demeaning having to walk around like all of the time.</p>

<p>&#34;Did you get it?&#34; Buffy asked finally, not able to hold back on asking the question any longer.</p>

<p>In response Giles held up a small container with a fluorescent blue liquid inside. Buffy stared at the vile for a moment. Her heart was thundering in her chest, and her eyes locked on the glowing liquid. It was an odd sensation to be able literally see someone holding your future in their hands. Buffy had to say that it wasn't an all-together pleasant experience. It was equal parts terrifying and exhilarating.</p>

<p>Finally Giles lowered the vile breaking the spell.</p>

<p>&#34;Shall we?&#34; he asked looking directly at Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;I think we shall,&#34; the Slayer responded.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The gang congregated in Giles's bedroom, more specifically around Giles's bed. Buffy was lying on her stomach in the middle of the bed with the other gathered around her. Willow was sitting on the edge of the bed holding Buffy's hand while Giles prepared the syringe.</p>

<p>&#34;So,&#34; Buffy said in a somewhat choked voice. &#34;Tell me again how we're going to do this?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I,&#34; Giles said as he swished the liquid around, &#34;am going to pour the serum into a syringe. Then I'm going to inject the liquid into you spinal cord,&#34; the watcher continued calmly.</p>

<p>&#34;That's what I thought,&#34; Buffy said whimpering softly.</p>

<p>Willow leaned over so that her mouth was right beside Buffy's ear. What she wanted to do more than anything was hold Buffy in her arms and try to assure and reassure her-by any means necessary-that everything was going to be alright. She wanted to take Buffy in her arms and kiss away her fears. But, she knew that there, then, she couldn't do any of those things without raising more than a few eyebrows, so she settled for squeezing Buffy's hand and offering a few words of encouragement.</p>

<p>&#34;It'll be alright,&#34; Willow whispered softly. &#34;Giles knows what he's doing…you probably won't even feel a thing.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was about to thank Willow for at least attempting to make her feel better when she got a look at the size of the needle on the syringe Giles was preparing.</p>

<p>&#34;What is that?&#34; Buffy asked in voice squeaking in alarm. &#34;I mean, you better be planning on going Whaling later, because that harpoon isn't getting any closer to me or my spine,&#34; Buffy continued in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>&#34;It's perfectly safe,&#34; Giles responded meeting Buffy gaze. He was finished. &#34;Let's get on with it shall we.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, did anybody hear me say that harpoon is not getting any closer to me or my spine? I for distinctly remember saying it,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>Giles opened his mouth to respond but Willow beat him to it.</p>

<p>&#34;It'll be alright,&#34; the hacker said softly. &#34;You know it has to be done.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But…but look at it Will,&#34; Buffy said pleadingly. &#34;I've seen javelins that a smaller than that!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said tilting Buffy's face up so that she could see her eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Buffy responded dejectedly. &#34;But I'm warning you, I'm going to be grumpy after this. Very grumpy.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Giles said. &#34;Now this won't take but a minute,&#34; he continued leaning over Buffy's back. &#34;You won't even,&#34; he said as he rested the needle against her skin, &#34;feel a thing…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&#34; Buffy hollered as he sunk the needle in. &#34;I SO felt that!!!&#34;</p>
