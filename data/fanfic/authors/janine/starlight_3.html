<!-- Starlight \ Part 3 -->

<p>The morning sun was streaming in through the open curtains causing Buffy to&nbsp;&nbsp;blink her eyes repeatedly as she attempted to watch the figure snuggled up&nbsp;&nbsp;beside her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willow's head was resting on her shoulder, and one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;hacker's legs was thrown over hers causing Willow to lean into her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her&nbsp;&nbsp;friend was still very much asleep, but Buffy could just barely detect a&nbsp;&nbsp;curvature at the edge of Willow's lips, confirming her suspicion that&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow's was a 'good' very much asleep sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy was very much aware of&nbsp;&nbsp;the injury that she had suffered the night before, but the pain was nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;near where it had been before.&nbsp;&nbsp;One the few perks of being a Slayer, Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;supposed.</p>

<p>&#34;Mmmm.&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy looked down at the head nestled on her shoulder when she&nbsp;&nbsp;heard Willow moan and tighten her hold on the Slayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked like&nbsp;&nbsp;somebody was just about ready to wake up, and Buffy was glad.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;that she didn't enjoy lying there holding Willow, but she really wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;see the girl without being in a state of monumental pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Monumental pain&nbsp;&nbsp;had a tendency to dull one's senses, and Buffy wanted all of her senses at&nbsp;&nbsp;peak operating capacity.</p>

<p>&#34;That was almost a word,&#34; Buffy drawled when she saw Willow start to blink.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;What you need know are some vowels.&nbsp;&nbsp;A, E, I, O, and it's time U woke up.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Wha…&#34; Willow muttered wiping at her eyes and blinking groggily.</p>

<p>&#34;That was better, let's try for two syllables next time,&#34; Buffy responded&nbsp;&nbsp;smiling at Willow's not entirely successful effort to wake up.</p>

<p>&#34;Where am I?&#34; Willow asked huskily before raising her head only to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy's face which was about an inch from her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Wha…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Do you some sort of aversion to 'T's'?&#34; Buffy asked her brows drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;together curiously.</p>

<p>&#34;Wh…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Don't go there,&#34; Buffy said cutting Willow off.</p>

<p>&#34;Go where?&#34; Willow asked backing off of Buffy a little.</p>

<p>&#34;I never noticed how completely out of it you are in the morning,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;said watching as Willow settled down again, this time on her own side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's…&#34; Buffy stopped and reconsidered her choice of words.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#34;Charming.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, I'm glad you think so because I have absolutely no idea what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;talking about,&#34; Willow responded finally fully conscious.</p>

<p>&#34;Alright, let's see here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I don't know what.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we're at&nbsp;&nbsp;Giles' house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, don't go saying 'what?' again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that about&nbsp;&nbsp;sums it up,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>Willow was quiet for a moment and Buffy knew that she was trying to match&nbsp;&nbsp;her responses to the questions that had been asked earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she knew&nbsp;&nbsp;from the look on Willow's face that she wasn't being at all successful.</p>

<p>&#34;Your chipper,&#34; Willow said finally deciding that de-coding the Slayer's&nbsp;&nbsp;response wasn't worth the effort.</p>

<p>&#34;No, I'm Buf-fy,&#34; Buffy responded sounding out her name phonetically.</p>

<p>Willow frowned at the sardonic response, but Buffy could tell that she was&nbsp;&nbsp;amused by the way the corner of her lip twitched.&nbsp;&nbsp;The twitching was a&nbsp;&nbsp;result of trying to suppress a smile, and Buffy knew it.</p>

<p>&#34;You're obviously feeling better,&#34; Willow responded the smile finally making&nbsp;&nbsp;its way across her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Yep, better and I are like two pigs in a blanket,&#34; Buffy told her shifting&nbsp;&nbsp;her position carefully so that she was directly facing Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;How's your side?&#34; Willow asked raking her eyes over what was visible of&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy knew that her friend's extensive searching of her body&nbsp;&nbsp;was due to purely platonic concern, but she felt her body begin to stir and&nbsp;&nbsp;decided that the wisest course of action would what she like to call the&nbsp;&nbsp;'make her stop that right now' defense.</p>

<p>&#34;It's definitely better than last night,&#34; Buffy said drawing Willow's&nbsp;&nbsp;attention back to her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Which is not to say that it's entirely of the&nbsp;&nbsp;good,&#34; she continued not bothering with her usual 'I am woman here me roar'&nbsp;&nbsp;strength routine.</p>

<p>&#34;Are there any side affects?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Not that I can tell,&#34; Buffy responded thoughtfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;But all I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;doing is lying here, so it's kind of hard to tell.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Let me take a look at it,&#34; Willow ordered softly.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her.</p>

<p>&#34;Bu…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Now who has an aversion to 'T's'?&#34; Willow asked smiling.</p>

<p>&#34;I thought you didn't hear any of that,&#34; Buffy said stalling.</p>

<p>&#34;Quit stalling,&#34; Willow responded.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't move an inch.</p>

<p>&#34;It's nothing I haven't seen before,&#34; Willow commented when she realized&nbsp;&nbsp;that Buffy was holding up out of respect to some sort of modesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;Slayer raised an eyebrow at that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was true that Willow had seen her at&nbsp;&nbsp;various stages of undress, but she was certain the area that Willow needed&nbsp;&nbsp;to check was going to far surpass those past stages.</p>

<p>&#34;How do you think you got into those clothes?&#34; Willow asked holding Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;gaze under the Slayer looked down at her body for what Willow assumed was&nbsp;&nbsp;the first time since waking up because of the surprised look on her face&nbsp;&nbsp;when she saw what she was wearing.</p>

<p>&#34;Transporter?&#34; Buffy asked looking up once again.</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; Willow responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;No Scottish men from space had anything to do&nbsp;&nbsp;with it.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well, then I guess resistance is futile,&#34; Buffy said leaning back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Go&nbsp;&nbsp;ahead.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow reached over slowly and grasped the edge of Buffy's shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting&nbsp;&nbsp;up the edge of it she carefully raised the shirt revealing Buffy's abdomen.&nbsp;&nbsp; She gasped.</p>

<p>&#34;I've gotta tell you Will, that is not a confidence inspiring sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;More&nbsp;&nbsp;like the complete opposite actually.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;There's just some…inflammation,&#34; Willow responded in what she hoped was a&nbsp;&nbsp;confidant voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;She really couldn't help the gasp, she was surprised when&nbsp;&nbsp;she saw what had happened to Buffy's side over the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut itself&nbsp;&nbsp;was healing nicely, but the skin around it, and dipping down into Buffy's&nbsp;&nbsp;waist band was an angry red colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't the like the night before,&nbsp;&nbsp;the skin wasn't warm to the touch, and marks weren't the jagged lines they&nbsp;&nbsp;had been, there were just these intensely red patches spread out over the&nbsp;&nbsp;skin of Buffy's left side.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you sure?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if you're saying that just to comfort me I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;to have to get really, really worried,&#34; Buffy responded looking down at&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow who had put on her poker face.</p>

<p>&#34;Does this hurt?&#34; Willow asked gently touching one of the red patches.</p>

<p>&#34;Stop that,&#34; Buffy said grasping Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Did it hurt?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Then what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It tickled.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Now what?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I have to see how far down the rash goes.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Rash?&nbsp;&nbsp;What rash?&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn't say anything about a rash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has a rash?&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#34;I meant the inflammation.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But you said rash, which is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's…the redness?&#34; Willow answered though it was really more of a question.</p>

<p>&#34;Redness?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Redness.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What about the…redness, again?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I have to check to see how far down it goes,&#34; Willow reiterated.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Buffy responded realizing the implications of what Willow had just&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Then by all means…be my guest.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy knew that her breathing had quickened and tried to calm down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;had just pulled down the waistband of the jogging pants she was wearing, and&nbsp;&nbsp;was now lowering the pants to her ankles.&nbsp;&nbsp;She could see her abdominal&nbsp;&nbsp;muscles quivering, and hoped that Willow wasn't as perceptive to her bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;reactions as she was, cause if she was Buffy knew that she would, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;words of Ricky Ricardo, 'have some 'splaining to do'.</p>

<p>&#34;You know, usually someone has to be cursed for eternity, or buy me dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;before they get into my pants,&#34; Buffy joked awkwardly, hoping that it would&nbsp;&nbsp;at least take some of her focus away from where Willow's head was.</p>

<p>Willow looked up at her wide-eyed.</p>

<p>&#34;Joke, it was a joke,&#34; Buffy said quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I just meant that one could&nbsp;&nbsp;take advantage of a situation like this, erotically as it were,&#34; she&nbsp;&nbsp;continued cursing every syllable that came out of her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Not that I&nbsp;&nbsp;think you would…or that…I was just…making conversation,&#34; Buffy finished&nbsp;&nbsp;lamely.&nbsp;&nbsp;'That went well,' she thought to herself snidely.</p>

<p>Willow blinked.</p>

<p>&#34;I like cheese,&#34; Buffy said at a loss for what else to say.</p>

<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Willow responded finally snapping out of whatever trance she had&nbsp;&nbsp;been in during Buffy's little mind fart, and the Slayer was grateful to have&nbsp;&nbsp;the bright doe-like eyes off of her for the time being.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Buffy didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;know was that Willow had been thinking the same thing about her position,&nbsp;&nbsp;and her thoughts had taken the 'erotically as it were' path.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been&nbsp;&nbsp;still more out of fear that she had been busted, than out of shock from what&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had said.</p>

<p>&#34;How's it look?&#34; Buffy asked desperately needing a return to the status quo.</p>

<p>&#34;The 'redness' continues down your leg to about mid-thigh but it stops&nbsp;&nbsp;there,&#34; Willow responded pulling Buffy's jogging pants back up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;It's&nbsp;&nbsp;probably just a reaction, either to the bite or to the…treatment,&#34; Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;continued shuddering a little at the memory of the way they had to treat&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy's wound.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;That's good.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded moving back over to her side of the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you hungry?&#34; Buffy asked a minute later.&nbsp;&nbsp;They needed to get out of&nbsp;&nbsp;this room, or more specifically out of the bed.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded quickly, perhaps too quickly.</p>

<p>&#34;Let's get some grub then…and I've got dibs on the blueberry scones,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;said.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to her as if they ended up calling 'shotgun' for just about&nbsp;&nbsp;everything in their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it sucked to be young.</p>

<p>&#34;You always get the scones,&#34; Willow said pouting.</p>

<p>&#34;That's because I've got the stones,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked looking up at her quizzically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know exactly,&#34; Buffy said with a thoughtful expression on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Oh well, race ya!&#34;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy blinked as she tried to wrap her mind around the events of the past&nbsp;&nbsp;few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had said 'race ya' to Willow, then she had flung her legs&nbsp;&nbsp;over the edge of the bed with every intention of racing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she was&nbsp;&nbsp;lying on the floor eating carpet-literally.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said coming around the bed to kneel by her friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Are you&nbsp;&nbsp;alright?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think not,&#34; Buffy said pushing herself up into a sitting position.</p>

<p>&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I wish I knew,&#34; Buffy responded softly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something wasn't right, she&nbsp;&nbsp;could feel it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in her body was off somehow.</p>

<p>&#34;Here,&#34; Willow said offering her hand to Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Let me help.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy grasped Willow's hand and allowed her friend to try and pull her up.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm gonna need a little help here,&#34; Willow said when she began realized she&nbsp;&nbsp;was meeting resistance from Buffy's end.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow, stop,&#34; Buffy said quietly.</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;You just have to…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, just stop, it's not going to work,&#34; Buffy responded trying to hold back&nbsp;&nbsp;the bile building in her throat.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, Will I can't move my legs,&#34; Buffy said cutting off the hacker once&nbsp;&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't move my legs, Will.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't move my legs.&#34;</p>
