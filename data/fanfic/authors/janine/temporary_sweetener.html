<p>Pain.  Well dressed feet.  Blue pant legs.  Billows of smoke.  A gasp  of pain.  Buffy.  Buffy moving, side to side, round and about  surrounded by clouds of smoke.  Someone's yelling, it's Buffy's  name.  Head turns to side, an image is caught on the reflective  surface of a piece of metal.  The face reflected is Cordelia's.   Cordelia's hands on Buffy's shoulders.  The smoke dissipates.  Bright  light.</p>

<p>"Arrrrrrrgh," Cordelia moaned grasping her head in pain as she felt  the contents of her stomach begin to rise up into her throat and her  legs begin to totter.  She felt herself beginning to fall over only  to be grasped around the waist by two strong hands before she began  to feel herself being lifted into the air moments later.</p>

<p>"Ugh," she groaned again, blinking rapidly as her head began to clear  and it didn't hurt to think anymore.  She could hear hurried  footsteps and then felt a depression on whatever surface it was she  was laying on.  A voice, Angel, was asking if she was alright.  "I'm  fine," she managed to choke out in the general direction of the hazy  blob in front of her she assumed was the vampire.</p>

<p>"What'd you see?" Angel asked softly reaching out his hand to accept  the cool compress Fred was holding out for him.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia responded struggling to sit up.  The terror she  felt in the vision still lingered inside of her keeping her somewhat  off kilter.</p>

<p>"What do I have to do?" Angel asked trying to keep the alarm he felt  out of his voice.  He didn't like this, a message from the powers so  soon after she'd come back, when she clearly wasn't up to anything  let alone saving the world once more.  "What was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Cordelia responded truthfully her head finally clear  as she sat up and rubbed at her temples.  "But I have to go, to  Sunnydale.  I saw myself, in the vision.  I'm there with her when  whatever it is happens."</p>

<p>"We'll leave as soon as you can pack," Angel replied, standing up and  offering his hand to Cordelia.</p>

<p>Cordelia grasped his hand allowing him to pull her up easily, before  preparing to object to his use of the word `we'.  She hadn't seen him  in the vision anywhere.  "Angel I …"</p>

<p>But before she could get another word out, her hands flew to her head  once more and she fell to the ground, her eyes screwed tightly shut  as another vision overtook her mind.  Rocking and battering her until  she felt a deep ache in every part of her body.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Angel asked gently picking Cordelia up and resting her on  the couch once more, his free hand dragging the hair strewn across  her face to the side.</p>

<p>"No, young kid, maybe 13.  In a warehouse near the Boulevard.  He's  surrounded by Pylorian demons.  And there's a sign on the wall with a  giant egg on it," the brunette related as she rubbed at her eyes  tiredly.</p>

<p>"Wesley, Gunn," Angel started to say looking over at the two men on  Cordelia's other side.</p>

<p>"No," Cordelia stated firmly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean no," Angel asked looking over at her with that  charmingly confused look on his face.  </p>

<p>"I mean you stay, I go," Cordelia responded standing up.  "Whatever  is happening in Sunnydale, you're not suppose to be there.  You're  needed here, at that warehouse.  Whatever that kids involved with,  it's more than a night's work," she continued placing a hand on his  shoulder.  "Don't worry," she went on in softer tone.  "I'll look out  for her.  After all, she is the only one of you dunces who can  appreciate my shoe collection…be it a dwindling one," she continued  now standing.  "I'll call if anything pops up," and with that she  headed for the door before they could stop her, or she could stop  herself.  </p>

<p>Back to Sunnydale, home sweet hell.</p>

<p>Cordelia slowly made her way up the steps onto the Summer's front  porch, until both of her feet came to rest on the bare straw mat that  lay in front of the door.  She looked down in-between her feet and  smiled, people in L.A. still had ones that read: Welcome.  Looking  back up, she confirmed that the doorbell was indeed in the same place  she'd last seen it and extended her hand to ring the bell.  But just  before her finger reached the black button, she stopped, her arm  merely hovering centimeters away.  It had been so long since she had  been there, not that she used to be at Buffy's house everyday  braiding the Slayer's hair and helping her carve stakes, but even she  could tell it felt different.  It had only been a few years, but they  hadn't been short and so much had changed.  And, as her hand hovered  by the bell, she wondered if anything would be the same.</p>

<p>"I can't answer the door if you don't ring the bell," said a soft  voice from behind Cordelia.  The brunette turned her head around  slowly recognizing the voice immediately as Buffy's.  Her tone was  flatter, softer than Cordelia was used to hearing from the blonde,  but it was unmistakably Buffy.</p>

<p>Now facing the blonde she looked at her intently, and with a slight  smile moved her finger the last centimeter, pressing down on the  black button, filling the silence of the porch with a faint buzzing.</p>

<p>"You cut your hair," Buffy said making her way onto the porch and  reaching for the door handle.</p>

<p>"You've grown yours out," Cordelia responded eyeing the blonde as she  pushed through the now open door, only looking back briefly to make  sure the brunette was following her before continuing further into  the house.</p>

<p>"Can I get you something to drink?" Buffy asked carelessly tossing  her jacket over the back of one of the chairs around the kitchen  table as she made her way to the sink.  "We've got every pop known to  mankind, and…apparently soy milk."</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Cordelia responded softly, unconsciously matching Buffy's  tone.  "Thanks," she continued observing the blonde as she nodded to  indicate she'd heard the brunette then reach for a glass for  herself.  </p>

<p>The brunette hadn't really been sure to expect when she saw Buffy for  the first time, but from the way she was feeling having finally met  her again, she knew she hadn't been expecting this.  She supposed  that considering all that had happened to Buffy over the past year,  hell over the past couple of weeks, that the blonde seemed to be  doing rather well.  Sure she wasn't exactly a ray of shine, but  logically one couldn't expect her to be.  She had lost her mother,  nearly lost her sister, died, was banished to a hell dimension, and  then suddenly brought back to life.  That was pretty rough deal; it  would've left anyone feeling a bit out of sorts.  It would have been  insanity to expect her to be the same old Buffy.  But as Cordelia  watched her pour herself a glass of water, she realized that she had  secretly been expecting to see the old Buffy.  That somehow she had  just assumed that Buffy would've bounced back like always, and when  they met they would've insulted each others clothing and it would  have been like the good old days.  But the moment she arrived at the  house, and saw the unkempt lawn, the shoddily patched up window, and  the overhanging tree branches she knew.  She knew that it wasn't  going to be like the good old days, and standing in the center of the  Summer's kitchen watching the Slayer watch her; she suddenly realized  that she had no idea what to do.</p>

<p>"Have we run out of small talk?" Buffy asked snapping Cordelia out of  her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Where's Dawn?" Cordelia asked ignoring the blonde's question.  The  fact was that there was plenty to talk to about, too much to talk  about, and there was no way that they would talk about it.  They  could talk about how Buffy looked like shit, they could talk about  how the house looked like it had been ransacked, they could talk  about how she had mind numbing visions, or how she was no longer able  to sleep through the night.  They could talk about what hell was  like, about how it felt to feel like the powers that be were  punishing you for trying to do your best.  They could talk about what  it felt like to have no life, to feel like a plague that would infect  and destroy anyone who got close to you.  They could talk about how  they would sigh in relief as night fell.  They could talk about  having no parents and being on their own.  They could talk about a  lot of things, but they wouldn't.  </p>

<p>"School," Buffy responded.  "Apparently the teacher's LIKE her.   Heard that's what happens when you attend," she continued pulling out  a chair and sitting down.  "You can sit down you know, we don't have  a lot of chairs left but the ones that are here are fully functional."</p>

<p>"What happened?  To the house I mean?" Cordelia asked pulling out a  chair and sitting down gingerly, still uncertain of the structural  soundness of the object in question.</p>

<p>"Crystal eating, fish demon," Buffy responded nonchalantly.  "Why are  you here?"</p>

<p>"I had a vision," Cordelia responded settling onto the chair more  securely.  Buffy's segue into finding out what the hell she was doing  back in Sunnydale hadn't exactly been subtle, but she was glad for  the change of subject.  She could talk business.  "I know that sounds  like I eat granola and sleep on bubble wrap, but two years ago…"</p>

<p>"I know about the visions," Buffy interjected cutting Cordelia  off.  "Angel told me.  He said you almost died from them."</p>

<p>"That was different," Cordelia, responded both surprised and not  surprised that she had come up during any conversations the two of  them had had.  "Most of the time they're just excruciatingly painful,  not lethal."</p>

<p>Buffy let out a bark of dark laughter.  "Don't you love being  special?" she asked looking up and over at Cordelia, her lips  twitching upwards, but not quite smiling.</p>

<p>"Doesn't all suck," Cordelia responded seriously meeting her  gaze.  "But," she continued smiling slightly, "when it does decide to  bend you over it works you with a ten foot pole."</p>

<p>Buffy's lips twitched again at this, this time forming what could be  recognized as a smile, but her expression reverted back to the mask  of indifference that it had been since Cordelia first turned on the  porch to face her.</p>

<p>"What could you have possibly seen that would bring you here?"  Buffy  asked resting her elbow on the table boredly and propping her head in  her hands.</p>

<p>"Me.  Here," Cordelia responded, blinking rapidly in surprise when  Buffy started to laugh.  "That's funny?" the brunette asked wondering  if perhaps she should have asked Angel to go into a bit more detail  about Buffy's mental state before entering a confined, deserted space  with her.</p>

<p>"Strangely, yes," Buffy replied standing up and heading for the  door.  "Feel like taking a walk?" she asked looking back at Cordelia  briefly.</p>

<p>"I guess so," Cordelia responded seeing Buffy pick up her jacket and  knowing that Buffy was going for one whether she went or not.</p>

<p>"I'm not really a fan of confined spaces right now," Buffy continued  as Cordelia stood up to follow her.  "Can't imagine why," she went on  as they stepped out of the house and she closed the door.  "Must have  had something to do with the coffin I used to play in as a child."</p>

<p>"Morbid much?" Cordelia asked as they stepped down the steps.</p>

<p>"Seems so.  But, I'm getting the impression that `being re-animated  from death' humor has kind of jumped the shark," Buffy responded  turning off of the driveway and onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I think it has a certain charm to it," Cordelia responded sticking  her hands in her pockets as they made their way down the street.  "I  get a lot of drop dead's in L.A. … you know, from cabbies, and after  my so close to death I knew what he had lunch experience, I liked to  respond, been there done that still waiting on the rain check,"  Cordelia continued glancing over at the blonde.  "But you're right, I  think that it really is an acquired taste."</p>

<p>Buffy smirked but said nothing as they cut across the street and  headed downtown.</p>

<p>"You know," the Slayer started a moment later.  "If I wasn't so sure  that you were here to tell me something's going to kill me again, I'd  say that it was good to see you." Cordelia smiled and shook her head.  Now that the extreme awkwardness  had worn off, she found herself thinking that it was kind of nice to  see Buffy too.</p>

<hr>

<p>"They didn't really give me much with this one.  I don't know, maybe  I couldn't see more because it has to do with me, or maybe they were  just feeling particularly bitchy last night, I don't know.  So, what  I'm trying to say, apparently taking the scenic route to it, is that  I don't know what's coming; I don't when it's coming, or what it  wants.  All I know is that it is coming, it'll be here sometime, and  when it finds you I'm there with you," Cordelia related moving the  spoon around her coffee, watching as the brown liquid swirled around  and around in the hideously oversized cup.</p>

<p>"You do realize that you've been of absolutely no help," Buffy  replied staring out the window.  Ooh, another mysterious evil, that  was unexpected.  The blonde sighed and brought her hand up to rub at  her temples tiredly.  Another threat to the survival of the world,  how May of the powers, twice in one year wasn't she the lucky lass.  </p>

<p>"I hoping that more will come later," Cordelia related finally  placing her spoon on the saucer.  "That happens sometimes, like a  mini-series only usually without Joanna Kerns."</p>

<p>"Usually?" the blonde asked glancing at her companion.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she sometimes pops up.  After Growing Pains ended she sold her  soul to Kalshar and tends to pop up in ritual sacrifice visions,"  Cordelia responded.  "I love her robes though, it's always a  surprise."</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"It's Calvin Klein, he's Rashtazar's servant on earth and Rash and  Kal are really tight, so Joanna's got a whole specialized line of  bloodstain resistant poly-cotton blend, doubled stitched robes,"  Cordelia continued.  "Martha's really bitter about the arrangement,  she has to wear smocks."</p>

<p>"What you just said," Buffy responded once Cordelia had finished. </p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia responded watching with a frown as Buffy pushed her  untouched plate away.</p>

<p>"That was more depressing than dying," Buffy continued with a sigh.</p>

<p>Cordelia watched Buffy for a moment after the Slayer spoke.  She wore  weariness over her face like glitter make-up, the dark bags under  hers eyes only accentuating the hollowness of her eyes, and the  gauntness of her cheeks.  She was getting the impression that right  now Buffy would have considered pretty much anything more depressing  than dying, and that confused Cordelia as much as it worried her.</p>

<p>"You're wrong you know," the ex-cheerleader responded a moment later,  her tone completely serious.  "If you think that's more depressing  than dying, then you need to see Fred's wardrobe," she continued in  the same tone.  "Everyone thinks that chiffon went out of style with  asbestos, but the bitch is back and I have to work in the same  building as it.  I mean, imagine trying to convince the bank that you  actually live in Spain so that they won't foreclose on everything and  your shoes, with the knowledge that mere meters above your head lives  a sea-foam chiffon chemise."</p>

<p>"You're right," Buffy said looking over at her.  "That is horribly  depressing."</p>

<p>And as Cordelia looked over at Buffy she could see that the woman  seemed to look even worse, and realized that her little story hadn't  helped matters.  "Of course we have to look on the bright side," the  brunette continued a moment later.</p>

<p>"What?  Even chiffon disintegrates with time?" Buffy asked quirking  an eyebrow at the brunette.</p>

<p>"No," Cordelia replied shaking her head.  "Maybe that's why I was  sent here, to tell that story, so that when our mystery monster  arrives, all we have to do is throw a chiffon camisole over it, and  it'll die of shame," she continued in a conspirital whisper, pleased  to see Buffy smile and shake her head in response.</p>

<p>"Come on," Buffy said standing up a moment later.  "I have to go pick  up Dawn."</p>

<p>"Why, are her legs broken?" Cordelia asked standing up nonetheless.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy responded as they headed for the door.  "It's just that… before…well before when Glory was loose I got used to picking her up  and…it feels normal," she continued pushing out into the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Normal," Cordelia repeated as she joined Buffy on the  sidewalk.  "What's that again?"</p>

<hr>

<p>"This is it," Buffy said as they stopped just outside the doors to  The Magic Box.  Dawn had been ecstatic to see Cordelia, for some  reason the younger girl had always thought that Cordelia was all that  and a bag of chips, and much to Buffy's relief Dawn had immediately  begun to engage the other brunette in conversation from the moment  they saw each other.</p>

<p>"Fresh coat of paint," Cordelia said turning around to face  Buffy.  "That's new for this part of town," the brunette continued.   Buffy had been silent since they'd picked Dawn up and while she had  been entertained by the smaller Summer's girl, she couldn't help but  worry about Buffy at the same time.  Despite the blonde's statement  that she had wanted to pick Dawn up because it seemed normal, and the  amazing sacrifice she had made the girl, from what Cordelia could see  Buffy didn't seem all that interested in her.  She'd barely greeted  the girl when they arrived at the school, and as soon as Dawn had  started talking to her Buffy had moved ahead of them, seemingly  unaware of their presence for the past twenty minutes.  </p>

<p>"Anya's in charge of the shop now…even though Giles is back," Dawn  interjected into the silence that followed Cordelia's  statement.  "The place has got a lot of cool stuff in it, but Anya  employs a strict `you break it, you bought it' policy, so I'd be  careful about what you touch," the younger girl continued.  "Xander's  still paying off the Hhasperas hide he spilled Coke on."</p>

<p>"You know what they say," Cordelia responded smirking at Dawn as  Buffy opened the door to the store. "Retail, it's not a profession,  it's a way of life."</p>

<hr>

<p>"No really, they're glad to see you," Dawn whispered to Cordelia as  the occupants of the shop continued to stare at her blanketing the  room in an unnatural silence.  The moment they had spotted her all  activity immediately ceased and everyone began to stare at her like  she'd just burned a Harry Potter book.  All except for the blonde  girl sitting beside Willow who just looked confused.  Cordelia looked  over at the youngest Summers' girl unconvinced.  "Really," Dawn  insisted.  "We just don't get a lot of visitors."</p>

<p>"It's a shop," Cordelia replied with a sigh, watching as Dawn turned  and looked at the rest of them imploringly.  "Well," Cordelia  muttered walking further into the shop.  "This is going to be a  horribly awkward afternoon," she continued coming to a stop at the  bottom of the stairs, watching idly as Anya stepped closer to Xander  and Willow whispered something to the confused blonde girl.</p>

<p>"Oh," Tara gasped a moment later in understanding.  "She doesn't seem  evil," she whispered to Willow in a voice that wasn't quite as soft  as she thought it was.</p>

<p>Cordelia turned around and smiled at the shy blonde girl before  turning her attention to the redhead sitting beside her.  "Willow I'm  hurt," the brunette began.  "If this is because I inadvertently  called you a big `ol lesbo, I didn't mean anything by it."</p>

<p>"You can't have Xander back.  He's mine now, I've carved our initials  into various objects and surrounded them by hearts," Anya said  speaking up before Willow could respond to Cordelia's comment.</p>

<p>"Okay," Cordelia responded clapping her hands together.  "With that  taken care of why don't we just skip any and all attempts at small  talk and I'll just get straight to the point."</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia slipped out of the living room quietly making her way to the  kitchen.  Peeking inside and seeing that the room was empty she  turned back around to head up the stairs when she noticed that the  front door was ajar.  Walking over she nudged the door open a  fraction more and saw who she had been looking for.</p>

<p>She had noticed that Buffy had disappeared from the gathering some  half hour before but hadn't been able to get out of the room before  then.  She had noticed the blonde get increasingly quite and pensive  as the day wore on, and by the time the Slayer had removed herself  from the company of her friends Cordelia would have been forced to  describe her behavior in the afternoon as positively cherry in  comparison.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind her she moved to sit next to the Slayer, her  mind still trying to wrap around all that she had witnessed today.   Sunnydale had become a far more complicated place since she had left,  and they had all become far more complicated people.  Everything was  tense and off-kilter, dull and gray.  They talked to each other  without saying anything, they frowned at behavior but looked the  other way, they smiled but it never reached their eyes.  She felt  like she had entered some kind of bizarro world where everyone looked  the same, and sounded the same, but there was something just a little  wrong about them.  Their hair was parted in the wrong way, or one of  their arms was shorter than the other.  These were the people that  never ran, that bit their thumb at death, that mocked the undead.  They were the humble heroes.  And now, well now they weren't.</p>

<p>"When I woke up, after the incident with the never-ending visions, I  told Angel what I had seen.  And he sat there quietly, looking  pensive and doing that thing with his brow.  You know, the furrowing  thing that makes them go all scrunch-y.  And I asked him if hell was  like because I couldn't see how things could possibly be worse.  And  he was pensive for a minute; you know high octane brooding, before  telling me that there weren't words in the English vocabulary to  describe what hell was like.  He said that on earth there was good  along with the bad, and that once you had been to a place where good  was distant echo the earth was like … well he was glad to be back,"  Cordelia finished finally taking her eyes off of her shoes and  turning to face Buffy who was staring out into the dark of the street  in front of them.  "You're not."</p>

<p>"I'm not what?" Buffy asked her attention still focused on something  in the distance that Cordelia couldn't see, that Cordelia wasn't even  sure was there to see.</p>

<p>"You don't seem glad to be back," the brunette responded keeping her  eyes trained on the side of the Slayer's face.  That had been bugging  her since they had first seen each other, a feeling that had gotten  worse throughout the day.  Buffy was miserable, she could see it, and  she knew that the Scoobies could see it too.  Everybody saw it, but  nobody talked about it.  It didn't make sense, she was out of hell,  she should have been getting better but she wasn't and everyone was  afraid to ask why.</p>

<p>"I was tortured for months in an unimaginable hell dimension,  surrounded by nothing but fire and agony.  The only human sounds that  I heard were my own tortured screams, and the only way to bare the  pain without going complete insane was to shut down, to stop feeling  and lose the pain in nothingness," Buffy began, her monotone voice  soft and hollow.  She had practiced these words and they fell out of  her mouth effortlessly.  "I don't seem glad because I'm not…I'm  learning how to feel again," she concluded with a deep sigh.  She was  so tired, but she knew she couldn't sleep.  To sleep was to remember  so it hurt too much to sleep.</p>

<p>"That was almost convincing," Cordelia responded a moment later,  turning her gaze out into the darkness as well.  She wondered how  many times Buffy had practiced that to make it sound so effortless.   The words they raged, but there was no fire.  Who says they want to  feel with no feeling?  "There's just one thing," the brunette  continued, "if you want to be warm again, why are you are you running  away into the dark?"</p>

<p>Buffy brought her head into her hands, rubbing her temples slowly.   Of all the people to call her out, she hadn't thought it would  Cordelia.  But now that the brunette was there, it seemed to make  perfect sense, why not Cordelia.  Hadn't the woman always called  people on their shit before?  "It hurts less out here," the Slayer  said finally turning to face the other woman.  "It's not warm in  there," she continued letting her gaze drift back into the  darkness.  "It's suffocating."</p>

<p>Cordelia turned her head to face Buffy once more upon hearing the  blonde's response.  She couldn't say that she was surprised by the  blonde's answer considering what she had seen throughout the day.  It  was a curious statement to be sure, but these were curious  circumstances. </p>

<p>"I don't expect you to get it," Buffy continued in Cordelia's  silence.  And she meant it, how could the brunette possibly know what  she was talking, how could she expect another to know when she barely  understood herself.  How could Cordelia whom she hadn't seen in three  years, had barely interacted with on anything more than a superficial  level, and who had only been in town for eleven hours possibly  understand what she meant when the people that lived with her, the  people that loved her, hadn't figured it out. </p>

<p>"You don't feel like you can be yourself," the brunette said softly  as she watched the Slayer, images and sounds from the day flooding  back to her.  The Scoobies furtive glances towards the blonde, the  strained jokes and smiles, the constant inquires about how Buffy was  feeling, the worried and somehow guilty glances sent her way when  they thought she wasn't looking.  "You're trying to be okay for them,  but you're not okay."</p>

<p>"They brought me back, they were so happy.  I can't be happy and I  can't tell them that," Buffy responded looking at Cordelia with a  touch of surprise.  A touch of surprise was all she was able to get  into her expression, but in reality she hadn't expected Cordelia to  say anything half as insightful as she had.  "The only person I've  been able to talk to since … coming back is Spike, and it's not at  all possible to be happy about that," she finished her head tilting  back lazily so that she could see the stars above her.</p>

<p>"I know," Cordelia started a moment later.  "I know we were never  bosom buddies, and that there was a time when I actively tried to  make your life as difficult as a could in my own little way…but since  then, I've come to understand a fraction of what it is that you have  to deal with and how amazingly strong you really are…and always have  been.  And if you'd like someone to talk to besides The Neutered  Dead, I'd be more than happy to listen.  I'm good at that, and of  course also giving my opinion afterwards," Cordelia finished offering  Buffy a friendly smile before standing up.  From her numerous chats  with Angel she had learned that this was the best time in a  conversation to let the subject ruminate over what had been said,  therefore allowing them to come to the conclusion that she, as  always, was right.  She had, after all, gotten quite good at having  these types of chats with the emotionally retarded.  Hell, if she  could get Angel to open up, one more talk with Buffy and she'd have  the girl spilling her guts – in a good, and helpful way that is.</p>

<p>"Cordelia," Buffy said softly looking up at the brunette, surprised  at the tightening she felt in her stomach when the brunette had stood  up to go.  Anxiousness, that was old, she hadn't felt that it quite  some time.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" the ex-cheerleader responded looking down at the blonde.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to inform you," Buffy began desperately trying to think of  something to say that would get the brunette to stay for a while  longer, "that you didn't make anything difficult.  In fact I found  you rather refreshing in an extremely annoying sort of way," the  Slayer went on, her lips twitching up a little as she anticipated the  brunette's offended and hopefully protracted response.    </p>

<p>"Really?" Cordelia asked moving to lean against the porch railing  before returning her gaze to Buffy's.  "So you were just pretending  to hate my tell it like it is policy?"</p>

<p>"No, I really did hate it.  I'm just a big enough person to admit,  that it came in handy from time to time," Buffy responded watching  the other woman pushed off of the railing as if preparing to go once  more.  "And," she continued taking a deep breath, "to ask, that is to  say that if you're wouldn't be totally opposed to the idea … or in  other words if you think that it might be agreeable to you…"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to stay out here with you?" Cordelia asked cutting  the blonde off with a knowing grin.  "Normally I would've let you  finish, but I want to get to bed sometime before the sun rises so I  thought it best to take charge of the situation."</p>

<p>"I see you still haven't signed up for those tact lessons," Buffy  replied smiling as Cordelia settled back down beside her on the  steps.  It was strange feeling for her lately to want any company at  all, and an even stranger feeling to want Cordelia's.  But it was a  feeling that didn't immediately feel like it was shredding her heart,  so she meant to hold on to it for as long as possible.</p>

<p>"Of course not," Cordelia exclaimed proudly.  "I wanted to be an  actress," she continued in a grand tone before smiling  depreciatively.  "You'd be surprised how much social consciousness  doesn't help you in the `Wood.  If you think Sunnydale's bad, you  haven't seen anything until you've been to a meet and greet mixer."</p>

<p>"Horrifying?" Buffy asked with a genuine touch of interest that  didn't go unnoticed by Cordelia.  </p>

<p>The brunette smiled.  "Let me tell you a story…"</p>

<p>"You know, I never thought the day would come that I would see this,"  Buffy said not trying to hide the smile that covered her face upon  seeing Cordelia holding up two packages of Kraft macaroni.  The  brunette had the microwavable stuff in one hand, and the original in  the other and seemed to be thinking very carefully about which would  give you the most for your dollar.   </p>

<p>"Yes, how the mighty have fallen," Cordelia muttered placing the  microwave stuff back on the shelf and tossing the other box in the  shopping cart.  "You know, it's really in poor taste to beg me to  accompany you to the grocery store and then insult me for price  comparing.  I only had your best interests at heart," the brunette  continued as they began to make their way down the isle.  " `Oh  Cordelia, we have no food, for I was searching for my monetary place  amongst men and had not time to clip coupons.  Oh Cordelia shopping  alone is ever so boring and I've been so very lonesome since my  return for hell.  Oh Cordelia my piddly little legs cannot reach the  high shelves, if you don't come with me whatever shall I do?'" the ex- cheerleader continued reaching up as the entered the next aisle  pulling down a can of soup.  "I gave up tanning at the beach for you,  the least you could do is mock me behind my back."</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment, and as Cordelia looked over she could  see that blonde was making a great show of looking deep in  thought.  "After carefully considering what you just said," Buffy  began as they entered the cereal aisle and began scanning for sugary  goodness.  "Of course ignoring mostly everything after `yes, how the  mighty have fallen', I feel that I have to say, MY LEGS ARE NOT  PIDDLY!"</p>

<p>"You're like one of those computer generated midgets from that Ring  movie," the brunette replied smiling as the Slayer tossed a box of  Corn Pops into the shopping cart and shot her a nasty look.  "Awww,  look at her pout," she continued in a baby voice as Buffy began to  move further down the hall.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm beginning to remember why we hated each other," the  Slayer muttered hoping in the air slightly to grab a box of hot  chocolate.  She had decided that she wasn't going to give the ex- cheerleader the honor of collecting items from the high shelves  anymore.</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled to herself watching the blonde's little display,  deciding to hang back for a little while to give the appearance of  being shamed.  The blonde was actually quite amusing when she was  angry so Cordelia didn't really mind.</p>

<p>"We never hated each other did we?" the ex-cheerleader asked finally  making her way back beside the Slayer.  "I never hated you," she  continued as the Slayer glanced over in her direction.  "I know that  the moments when I didn't have my bitch on, were few and far between,  but I never treated you any worse than I did my friends."</p>

<p>"I hated you," Buffy responded as Cordelia reached for a jar of  peanut butter.  "For about a minute and a half in 10th grade."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Cordelia asked looking at Buffy briefly before continuing on  ahead of the blonde.  She needed the moment it would take Buffy to  catch up with her to collect herself.  When the first part of Buffy's  statement had reached her ears she felt as if her heart had stopped,  no matter how briefly, and it shook her.  She hadn't realized before  then that she cared what Buffy Summers had thought of her.</p>

<p>"It was a couple of months after we had moved here.  I was cold, and  hungry and probably had dirt clinging to various parts of my body,"  Buffy continued quickening her step until she was beside Cordelia  once more.  "We were at the Bronze, and I looked across the room and  I saw you, you were dancing with Owen and I hated you for the next  few minutes."</p>

<p>"Why?  He left looking for you," Cordelia responded ceasing her  movements and looking over at the Slayer.  Of all of the moments for  Buffy to choose, of all of the times they had crossed paths, and  traded insults, for Buffy to have chosen a moment she wasn't even  aware of to hate her seemed confounding.</p>

<p>"Because when I looked at you I saw everything that I could've had  but wouldn't," the blonde responded quietly.  "And I don't mean  Owen," she continued with a small smile.  "I meant friends, respect,  a social life, ignorant bliss, possibility.  You were what I could've  been with taller shoes and darker hair, and for a moment I hated you  for having it."</p>

<p>"I never knew," Cordelia responded a moment later, her voice barely a  whisper.  She wasn't quite sure what to make of what Buffy had just  told her, or what to make of the fact that she had been told at all.</p>

<p>"It was only for a moment," the Slayer replied eyeing the brunette  before allowing a cheerless little smile to dance briefly across her  lips.  "Besides," she went on in Cordelia's silence.  "It was silly.   You were never really that girl I hated anyway, were you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I was," the brunette replied as they started down the aisle  again.  "Maybe not.  Maybe sometimes.  I don't know.  I was a mystery  unto myself."</p>

<p>"Weren't we all?" Buffy asked glancing down at the list in her  hand.  "Aren't we still?"</p>

<p>"That's gloomy," the brunette responded turning her head to observe  the woman beside her.</p>

<p>"That's life," Buffy responded with a sigh tossing a carton of orange  into the cart carelessly.</p>

<p>"That's even gloomier," Cordelia replied before glancing over Buffy's  shoulder and heading towards the next item on the list.  Surveying  the cheeses in front of her Cordelia frowned, no wonder the blonde  wasn't glad to be back.  Not knowing, not caring to know, not  believing that knowledge was possible.  With an outlook like that  life on earth could as well be hell.</p>

<p>"Does she do this a lot?" Cordelia asked looking over a Dawn.  Willow  was sitting in the middle of the floor, hovering above the ground  slightly with her eyes closed and her hair whipping around like she  was surrounded by her own private funnel cloud.  "Because it has an  extremely high creep factor."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," the younger brunette responded.  "Mostly we try and  ignore it, which is surprising easy…you know as long as things don't  start flying at your head … and the Emus stay away."</p>

<p>"Well I personally miss Fred's gadget's and I hate Fred's gadgets,"  Cordelia muttered to herself.  There was just something very off- putting about the entire display and she'd be glad when it was over.</p>

<p>"Who's Fred?" Dawn asked starting to get the ignoring and denial off  to a start.</p>

<p>"She's like Professor Peabody, only from Texas," Cordelia responded  shaking her head.  "She followed us home from another dimension and  despite my warning Angel insisted on feeding her…and well the rest as  they say is…"</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow called out her eyes opening wide exposing her  darkened pupils to the occupants of the room.  "Something new is  town.  I think it's Cordy's demon."</p>

<p>"It's not my demon, I didn't even get a good look at it.  It's  everybody's demon really," the ex-cheerleader interjected but nobody  seemed to paying attention to her besides Dawn who seemed to feel as  if being ignored brought them closer together in some way.</p>

<p>"It's stalking a group of kids out by Chatterley Park," the redhead  continued turning to face the blonde.  "I don't think that it's  planning on asking them for directions."</p>

<p>"Kids in trouble," Buffy muttered standing up.  "It must be a  weekday," she continued heading for the door.  "Come on," she said  turning around to face Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I don't fight the monsters, I just tell people where they are," the  brunette responded.</p>

<p>"I need you to tell me is this is the thing you saw in your vision,"  Buffy responded flatly.  "Besides, you said you were there so  obviously I'm going to convince you to come sooner or later, so you  could as well just save my vocal chords the strain and grab your  coat."</p>

<p>"Well when you put it like that," Cordelia started, "I really just  want to hit you," she continued walking towards the hallway  nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Works for me," the Slayer responded picking up her own coat.  "Shall  we."</p>

<hr>

<p>"What the hell were a bunch of kids doing out here anyway?" Cordelia  asked as they exited the park.  They had found evidence that a group  of people had been there recently but there was no sign of them  now.  "There's nothing to do out here.  They didn't build a Wal-Mart  around here did they?"</p>

<p>"No Wal-Mart," Buffy responded smiling though she was somewhat  distracted looking for any clues that would indicate the direction  the kids had taken off in.  "But there is an abandoned house about a  mile away that backs into the woods," Buffy continued her voice  slowing as an idea started to form in her mind.</p>

<p>"You think?" Cordelia asked looking over at Buffy.</p>

<p>"The mushrooms," Buffy said looking behind at the park remembering  the pieces of mushroom they had found scattered around the bench.</p>

<p>"This town really, REALLY needs a community center," the brunette  replied making a face.  "So we follow the shrumes?"</p>

<p>"Could as well," Buffy replied shrugging.  "I don't have any better  ideas."</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia dodged to the side as the trashcan lid went flying by her  head.  Turning back around quickly she looked at the terrified kids  frozen in front of her.  "GO!" she yelled waving her hands towards  the end of the alleyway.  However, all this seemed to so was cause  them to blink and stare at her blankly.  "GO!" Cordelia yelled  again.  "Run.  Away.  Flee!" she continued beginning to push them in  the correct direction.  "Fly away little birdies."</p>

<p>Sighing in relief when she saw them finally begin to take off she  turned around to find Buffy.  They had been on their way to the  house, when they'd heard a muffled scream come from one of the side  streets.  Needless to say, one thing led to another and once again  they were in a potentially lethal situation.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" the brunette yelled as the creature threw the blonde against  a nearby brick wall, and Buffy slid down bonelessly.  "Good one  Cordy," the brunette muttered to herself as the beast turned its  attention towards her at the sound of her voice.  "Next time you  should wear a t-shirt that say's `kill me' and avoid all the  confusion."</p>

<p>However before she could beret herself anymore she suddenly felt  herself being squeezed about the torso and hoisted into the air.   Kicking out with her legs she could feel her feet coming into contact  with the creatures flesh but it didn't seem to phase it.  Using her  hands to try and pry the creatures hand loose also seemed to be  having zero effect, so while her insides were still inside Cordelia  cast her gaze beyond the beasts hulky form where she spotted Buffy  once again on her feet.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Cordelia called out in a voice she was proud to admit was  panicked.  "Buffy!" she yelled again when the girl didn't move.  She  could see them, Cordelia was sure of it, she was looking directly  into the Slayer's face, but it was like nobody was home.  Buffy was  just staring without seeing.  Cordelia started to struggle harder,  but it was getting increasingly difficult as the creature tightened  its hold on her.  She was having trouble breathing.  "BUFFY!" she  yelled again.</p>

<p>Cordelia was about to yell out once more, but she found that her view  of the Slayer was quickly becoming impeded.  Focusing on the beast in  front of her, her mouth opened soundlessly in horror.  It had just  detached its jaw, opening up its mouth so that it was now big enough  to…   "BUFFY!" Cordelia yelled with a renewed vigor.  "BUFFY!!!" she  called again unable to see if the woman had begun to move or not.    And then she heard a sickening crunch and was falling to the ground  as the creature's hand released her.  And she was crouched down on  the ground gasping for air with a pained middle section watching as  Buffy raised a broken off piece of metal bar above her head and  slammed it down against the beast over and over and again, until it  stopped moving.  And then she was dragging herself into a standing  position as the Slayer grabbed a hold of the creatures' mangled body  and struggled to drop it into one of the alleys many dumpsters.</p>

<p>"Where were you!?!" Cordelia yelled  as Buffy turned away from the  dumpster to face her once again.  Her heart was still pumping wildly  in her chest and she was feeling decidedly uncivil at the moment.</p>

<p>"Here.  Saving your ass.  Just like old times," the Slayer responded  somewhat surprised by the anger in the other woman's voice.  What the  hell did she have to be angry about; she wasn't the one that had just  been used as a punching bag.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," Cordelia accused glaring at Buffy as she  began to pace.  Sure Buffy had been physical present the enter time,  but for a moment there she had disappeared, zoned out or something,  and in that moment Cordelia had nearly gotten her head bitten off!</p>

<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Buffy asked impatiently,  seriously beginning to become unimpressed by Cordelia's tone.   Perhaps if the brunette's visions hadn't been so lame she would have  been able to kill the thing faster.  You're breathing aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Barely," Cordelia shot back rubbing at her neck possessively while  staring at Buffy in a decidedly hostile manner.</p>

<p>Buffy stared at the other woman, expecting anger to overcome her at  any time as a result of Cordelia's gross ingratitude.  But the longer  she waited the more she came to realize that it wasn't going to  happen, and the wearier she became.  "I don't have to take this," the  Slayer stated softly but firmly, turning to leave the alleyway.</p>

<p>"Fine, run away.  Again, like always," Cordelia shot towards Buffy's  back.  She had seen this before from Buffy and more than a few times  from Angel.  These people were so strong, so gifted, so terrified of  themselves.  "You don't have to take anything do you, everyone else  just has to deal with it when you leave," she finished in a softer  tone, running a hand through her hair.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped moving as the woman's words reached her, halting her  where she stood.  "You think you know?  What I'm going through??" she  asked incredulously whipping around to face the brunette.  The  woman's audacity astounded her.</p>

<p>"I'm Cordelia, I don't think I know.  And I KNOW that you need to  snap the hell out of it!" Cordelia responded meeting the blonde's  increasing fiery gaze, realizing that this conversation had the  possibility of going horribly wrong…or perhaps wonderfully right.</p>

<p>"Snap out of it?" Buffy asked with a humorless bark of laughter.  "Do  I look like Cher!?!  I can't catchy quote my way out of this!" she  continued, yelling in the brunette's direction.  Ah, there was the  anger, she thought to herself.  Long time no see old friend.</p>

<p>"I see you," Cordelia responded standing her ground.  "I see what  you're doing, and it's going to get you killed.  Or one of them  killed.  You don't care, but you have to," she went on taking a step  towards Buffy.  "You can't just go through the motions, walk through  the part.  What's it going to take to get through to you, what's it  gonna take to penetrate your heart?  For god's sake Buffy, you're  alive!"</p>

<p>"And what if that's the problem!?!" the Slayer shot back  unthinkingly.  "What then oh great sage?  Tell me what to do.  Tell  me how I'm supposed to snap out of knowing I'm in hell!" </p>

<p>"This isn't hell Buffy, it's life," Cordelia responded somewhat  thrown and more than a little disturbed by the blonde's previous  statement.  Sometimes life could resemble hell, but they weren't the  same entity.  Buffy used to know that, and the fact that she had  ceased making the distinction worried Cordelia greatly.</p>

<p>"And that's supposed to make it better?" Buffy responded stepping  back from Cordelia and hanging her head down.  The anger was gone  leaving nothing in its wake.   "Fortune cookie wisdom," she muttered  under her breath.  "I was happy goddammit!" she continued spitting  out the words like they were ash in her mouth.  "For the first time  in as long as I can remember I was happy.  And now…" she trailed off  shaking her head dismally.  She ran her hand through her hair,  tugging at the strands forcefully pacing back and forth.</p>

<p>"You weren't in hell…" Cordelia practically choked out.  Like a wave  crashing over her, the truth of the situation came to her, chilling  her deeper than bone.  It was the only explanation, Buffy wasn't in  hell.</p>

<p>"I have to get back to Dawn," the Slayer said upon hearing the  brunette's response.  She couldn't do this, she had to leave.  She  needed to walk, she needed to find someplace quiet and just sit.</p>

<p>"You weren't in hell," Cordelia repeated, more firmly this time.  And  thinking about it she realized how ludicrous it had been to think  that Buffy had been.  Because if this girl, who sacrificed everything  she was, and everything she could have been for the people of the  world couldn't make it to the good place, then what chance did anyone  else have.  Buffy wasn't in hell, there was no way she could have  been, she's Buffy.</p>

<p>"I have to go," Buffy repeated.  She didn't want to think about, she  didn't to think about thinking about it.  She couldn't help thinking  about it, but she didn't want to think about it on purpose.</p>

<p>"Oh god.  Buffy," Cordelia whispered in a strangled voice as the  horror of the situation settled in her mind.  "You didn't want to  come back, they ripped you from…" and she let the sentence hang there  merely tilting her head up towards to the sky.</p>

<p>"I have to…" Buffy started again beginning to wake away from Cordelia  once more.  She couldn't say it, she couldn't talk about this.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia breathed out in a voice so pained that it was  almost inaudible.  She took a step towards the blonde, reaching out  for her and grasping her about the shoulder.  "You can't keep this  inside."</p>

<p>"They can never know," was all Buffy said in response.  She was  painfully aware of the weight of Cordelia's hand on her shoulder, of  the warmth.  She felt as if she was going to collapse from it.</p>

<p>"They have to know," Cordelia told her, moving around so that she was  standing in front of the Slayer, her hands still resting on the  woman's shoulder.  This silence, this play she was putting on for  them, it was helping to kill her.</p>

<p>"No!  They can never find out."  Buffy responded her body shaking  slightly.  "How?  How can I tell them?" she continued as tears  escaped from her eyes and her small frame continued to tremble.  "I  can't," she continued her voice quivering.  "How can I tell them that  I'd rather be dead?"</p>

<p>"You can't go on like this," Cordelia stated gently, placing her hand  on Buffy's check and stroking the skin of her cheek lightly as she  ducked her head down to get a better look at the blonde's face.</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy breathed out, her head tilting towards the hand  Cordelia had placed on her face.  "But…how do I make the pain go  away?"  she asked her voice helpless and beaten as the tears that had  been damned behind her eyes for weeks suddenly broke loose.  </p>

<p>Cordelia closed the last remaining distance between herself and Buffy  upon seeing the Slayer's breakdown, wrapping her petite blonde girl  in her arms.  She knew that she was the one that was trying to tell  Buffy that life didn't suck completely, but at the moment she wasn't  so sure about that.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Why do you superheroes think that you always have to be strong?"  Cordelia asked looking down at the Slayer as the blonde tried to  pulled out of her arms.  They had only remained standing for a little  while after she had brought Buffy into her arms, then gravity and  Slayer strength directed in a downwards direction had pulled them  down to the ground where they settled in a heap.  The truth was that  Cordelia wasn't against getting off of the filthy ground per say, she  just didn't think Buffy was trying to get up for the right reasons.</p>

<p>"Dawn," Buffy said, uncomfortably aware of the large wet patch on the  front of Cordelia's shirt, and of the fact that she was still nestled  in the other woman's arms and really didn't want to leave them.</p>

<p>"Dawn will be fine.  She's got three mommies, she's not going to miss  one for another couple minutes," the brunette related with a small  smile.  "Breathe Buffy.  Soak in the total lack of atmosphere."</p>

<p> "I have to…" Buffy started again, but was interrupted by Cordelia.</p>

<p>"You have to what?" Cordelia asked craning her neck around so that  she could see Buffy's face.  "What is it that you're going to do?"</p>

<p>Buffy met Cordelia's gaze for moment before turning away again.  What  was it that she had to do?  Where was she going to go?  Anywhere she  realized, she just had to move, she had to do something or else she  would go insane – if she hadn't already.</p>

<p>"I have to move.  I can't stay still," she told the brunette using  her strength to break the girl's hold on her this time.</p>

<p>"It's not all bad," the brunette said standing up as well.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked straightening her jacket as she prepared run far  away.</p>

<p>"The world," Cordelia responded dusting herself off.  What was it  with her and alleyways in Sunnydale?</p>

<p>"How can you of all people defend it?" Buffy asked momentarily  distracted from her plans of retreat.  "They wire the pain directly  into your brain.  All you see is hell."</p>

<p>"Not quite," Cordelia responded, her gaze on her boots.  "I've never  told them this, I've kept it too myself since the visions came to  me," she continued figuring that if she expected Buffy to bare her  soul, she should ante up as well.  "Sometimes, when I see things… they're not bad.  Most of the time it's blood and demons, and  sacrifice this, cut off that.  But sometimes, sometimes I'll see a  kid on a soccer field chasing down a ball.  Or a thirteen year old  getting their first kiss.  It's not all bad.  There's beauty, it's  just that people like us have to look a little harder for it.  That's  why we to do, so that other people won't have to."</p>

<p>"How am I suppose to find the answer when I don't even know the  question?" the blonde asked looking over at the brunette.  Sure their  little crying session had provided a bit of a catharsis, but there  was still the rest of her life to deal with.  She could hardly spend  her days crying on Cordelia's shirt. </p>

<p>"You know the question Buffy.  We all do," Cordelia told her shoving  her hands into her pockets.  "You've just been finding the answer  lacking."</p>

<p>"So how do I change that?" Buffy asked thinking Cordelia had just hit  the nail on the head.  "How do I change that it's not enough."</p>

<p>"Look harder," the brunette responded with a helpless little shrug.   What else could you do?</p>

<p>"When did this happen?" Buffy asked a moment later shaking her head.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"When did you become the voice of reason?" the blonde explained.</p>

<p>"September 31st, 1999 at 9:03 pm,"  Cordelia responded in perfectly  serious voice.  "It was a vindicating evening."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled shaking her head as they headed out of the alleyway.   She was actually glad to have Cordelia Chase back in town, the world  was a strange and unusual place.</p>

<p>Buffy awoke with a pained groan grabbing the side of her head and  wincing.  Being thrown against walls really did nothing to improve  her disposition upon waking up.  Seeing that it was dark outside she  glanced at her clock 7:30 pm, she and Cordelia had left at 10:00.   She'd been asleep all day.  She couldn't be sleeping in all day, she  had things to do, she had a sister to take care, and she had a  household to run and guest to entertain.  She felt more rested than  she had in probably like a year or something and decided to just  focus on that.</p>

<p>As she made her way down the stairs she could hear voices coming from  inside of the living room and slowed her step, listening to the sound  of her friend's voices, trying to let them wash over her.  Leaning  against the staircase she tilted her head to the side so that she  could see into the room yet remain unobserved.  Dawn seemed to be  acting out some sort of vignette, her back hunched over and her hand  moving in front of her face in a dramatic manner as she her mouth  parted and little sounds started to come out of her throat.  Her eyes  were twinkling and Buffy wished that she had a camera with her so  that she could keep that image with her for the rest of time.  So  that she could keep it in her pocket and take it out when the  darkness came and threatened to blind her.</p>

<p>And she looked at them all one by one and she saw Xander's excited  motions, and Anya's furrowed brow, and Willow's amused smile, and  Tara's serene visage.  And she saw Cordelia bathed in light watching  them all with a soft smile on her face, that would at times be  replaced by a smug grin, or an amused smirk, or an eyes twinkling  smile.  She heard the brunettes smooth voice echoing her in  mind "look harder", and she did.  And she felt, she felt something  inside when she watched the woman.  She felt something inside as she  traced the elegant lines of Cordelia's tanned skin with her eyes,  down her throat, across her shoulders, over her breasts, sliding  further down to her hips to long tapered legs.  She felt something  inside as she watched the brunette's lips curve and pout; she felt  the need to get some fresh air. </p>

<hr>

<p> Cordelia heard the back door close softly in a moment of relative  silence in the room and knew that the lady of the house had arisen  and snuck out. Mumbling something that was probably intelligible to  anyone in the room, the brunette stepped out secretly glad for the  distraction.  She liked the Scoobies well enough, and they were  nothing if not entertaining, but she was finding it increasingly hard  to keep her upper lip stiff as the day wore on.  It gave her a whole  new appreciation for what it was Buffy had been going through trying  to keep the truth hidden for so long, and strengthened her belief  that the blonde needed to tell them if she ever hoped to feel sane  again.</p>

<p>"Hiding again?" Cordelia asked settling herself on the steps of the  deck.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Buffy responded turning her head to the side so that  she could make Cordelia out.  She had slumped down in one of the lawn  chairs and was looking  at the stars when she heard the brunette come  out.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come in?" the brunette asked.  Everyone had been  badgering her all day about what had happened the night before and  she was sure it would have pleased the Scoobies to see that fearless  leader was up and about.</p>

<p>"I was busy," the Slayer responded her eyes still trained on the  brunette.</p>

<p>"What?" Cordelia asked standing up and moving towards Buffy.  She  couldn't see the Slayer's face and she couldn't talk to Buffy like  this without seeing her.  She'd miss something, and knowing both of  their luck it'd be something that shouldn't have been missed.  "You  have to practice being anti-social?"</p>

<p>"No," Buffy said following Cordelia with her eyes until the girl came  to rest in the chair beside her.  "I was looking."</p>

<p>"Looking?" Cordelia repeated leaning towards Buffy as if the answer  to her question were written on the blonde's face.  "Ah, looking,"  she continued a second later as the answer came to her.  Somebody was  actually following her advice.  How novel!  "What'd you see?"</p>

<p>"I saw them," Buffy said turning her head in the direction of the  house.  "I saw you," she continued turning her attention back to  Cordelia.  "And I thought that it looked nice in there."</p>

<p>Cordelia watched as a smile began to spread across Buffy's checks  after she finished speaking.  A shy one that caused her to dip her  head down and look off to the side shaking her head a little.   Cordelia could almost picture the inevitable blush across her  cheek's, and found herself thinking that she thought the entire  display was only marginally less cute that a sack of puppies.  It was  charming, and for a second it felt like three years before when the  sun always shone and nothing existed in the world that could hold  them down for the count.</p>

<p>"When I was there, watching you," Buffy started up again, her head  still tilted downwards but her voice strong, and carrying without a  falter, "I felt excited for the first time since coming back," she  continued glancing up at the brunette.  "I mean, something came over  me," she went on upon the seeing the other woman cock her head to the  side questioningly.  "Something warm…and I felt a genuine desire to  do something.  Not because I didn't know what else to do, but because  I wanted to do it."</p>

<p>"What did you want to do?" Cordelia asked unconsciously leaning  towards Buffy, her voice lowering intimately.  She knew that she  probably shouldn't have asked, that whatever it was Buffy had felt  was personal and probably a rather private desire, but she wanted to  know.  She tried to justify this need by telling herself that she  wanted Buffy to make a break through so that the Slayer would be well  on her way to being on her feet when it came time for them to face  down the beast again.  She kept telling herself that, but she knew  that it wasn't true.  The truth of the matter was that she just  wanted Buffy on her feet again, she wanted to see the blonde smile at  her before she left and mean it.  She wanted to look at the woman and  see that old mischievousness behind her eyes.  She wanted Buffy to be  better, and she wanted this because she just plain liked the girl.   And, she thought to herself, if you weren't such a stubborn jackass  you'd just admit it.</p>

<p>"What happened last night," Buffy began carefully.  "You're sure that  wasn't the vision you had?"</p>

<p>"Positive," Cordelia responded equally as carefully.  "Same bat time,  wrong bat channel."</p>

<p>"So that means you've gotta be around here at least another night,"  the Slayer stated though it came out sounding more like a question.</p>

<p>"Another.  A couple other.  Yeah," Cordelia responded looking at  Buffy carefully.  The woman wasn't doing much to inspire her  confidence.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded as spoke, slowly easing herself out of her chair as the  brunette finished up.  "The great thing about residing at rock  bottom," the blonde began taking a step towards the ex- cheerleader, "is that you've got no place left to fall," she went on,  watching Cordelia watch her.  "So, when I started to feel this… thing," she breathed out, her voice no more than a soft rasp.  "I  just decided to roll with it."</p>

<p>"Roll with what?" Cordelia asked forcing herself to ignore the  nervous energy that began to course through her body as Buffy closed  the last of the distance between them.</p>

<p>"Wanting to do this," Buffy responded and with that she leaned down  closing the remaining distance between them as she pressed her lips  against Cordelia's lightly, her hand coming to rest on the brunette's  face, her thumb stroking her cheek lightly.  She had felt Cordelia  tense at the first touch of their lips, but almost as soon as she had  become aware of the reaction it was gone and the brunette was  relaxing and opening her mouth to the Slayer.</p>

<p>"Oh," Cordelia breathed out as Buffy leaned back breaking the contact  between their lips, her eyes searching the blonde's face though for  what she wasn't certain.  "I see."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy stood there looking down at Cordelia and her virtual non- reaction then closed her eyes.  "And now that the gates have been  opened, other emotions are starting to surface, like guilt and  mortification," she muttered softly taking a step back from Cordelia  while mentally berating herself for the stupidity of her previous  action.  She always had to push it didn't she.  It wasn't enough that  she just actually wanted to do something, she had to be a jackass and  actually do something about it.  "And the instinct to flee," she  continued turning around and heading for the house.  How was she  suppose to look this woman in the eye for the rest of her visit?   They were suppose to face death together now?</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia called out seeing the woman turn to run again.  "I  wasn't, I'm not…" she continued standing up and walking over to the  Slayer, "upset."  Coming to a stop directly in front of the blonde  she dipped her head down slightly before continuing.   "More knocked  completely off my feet.  I…I just haven't been kissed for longer than  my dignity allows me to admit."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" Buffy asked, her gaze trained on Cordelia's  neck not willing to look the girl in the face yet.  She'd been so  numb since coming back and for the first time since that god awful  night she was feeling something, feeling human for the first time in  weeks and she was terrified at the thought that Cordelia might take  the warmth away.</p>

<p>Cordelia watched the woman in front of her for long moments trying to  come up with a response to her question.  What was she saying?  How  could she tell Buffy when she didn't even know herself.  She shook  her head as the answer came to her, it's simplicity amusing her  slightly.  She couldn't tell Buffy anything, so she'd so what she had  been trying to get Buffy to all along.  She'd feel.  So smiling ever  so slightly Cordelia leaned forward pressing her lips against Buffy  as her hands came to rest on the side of the blonde's face.</p>

<p>And soon they were leaning into each other, their bodies pressed  against each other tightly as they strained to increase the contact  between them.  Their hands roaming each other bodies and tangling in  each other's hair as they sought to consume each other, overcome by a  desperate hunger.  And as they stayed together, in that warm embrace,  Cordelia wasn't thinking about whether the next vision she received  was going to knock her out or praying that it wouldn't be a child  that she'd see.  She wasn't thinking about the isolation she felt as  a result of knowing what other people chose not to know.  And she  wasn't thinking about the fact that this is the first moment in  longer than she could remember where she hadn't been a little  afraid.  And as their tongues danced with each other in that age old  ballet, Buffy wasn't thinking about how cold it was, or how  everything seemed so dull and muted, and she wasn't thinking about  how she has to smile when she really just wanted to collapse.  All  she that she was aware of was that for the first time since coming  back she was glad to be exactly where she was.</p>

<p>Buffy carefully closed the door to bedroom before turning around to  be ensnared in Cordelia's arms once again, the brunette immediately  leaning forward bring their lips together once more.  By the time  they had made it back inside of the house the gang had decided to  call it a night, and for this a certain Slayer and diviner were  extremely grateful.  After their adventures in the Summers' backyard  the last thing either one of them wanted to have to do was make small  talk.</p>

<p>"We have to be quiet," Buffy managed to mumble, her eyes closing as  Cordelia kissed her way down her neck, and began to work her hand  under the Slayer's shirt.  "Dawn and Willow are just across the ha …  ha … hall," she continued feeling Cordelia smile against the skin of  her shoulder as her breath hitched in her throat and she struggled to  get the rest of her words out.</p>

<p>"Okay," the brunette whispered back a moment later, her hands  settling on the blonde's hips, her lips attaching themselves to the  spot behind Buffy's ear working the soft skin with her tongue, her  heart skipping a beat at the sound her actions caused to erupt from  the Slayer's mouth.  "Is there anything else?" she continued, her  mouth hovering beside Buffy's ear.</p>

<p>"Yeah," the Slayer responded a smile of her own now spreading across  her face.  "Take off your shirt."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>How they found their way to the bed neither of them would later be  able to remember, and how the rest of Cordelia's clothes were shed,  to be quickly followed by Buffy's, without them ever breaking  contact, they could only contribute to divine intervention.  But  somehow, someway they did end up spread across Buffy's bed, their  clothes discarded, Buffy's body draped over Cordelia's, covering her  like a blanket, moaning softly at the first contact of their naked  bodies as the Slayer rubbed her body along the brunette's lithe  frame.  And then the Slayer was kissing her, her hands resting on the  ex-cheerleaders hips as the brunette trailed her own hands over the  smooth expanse of Buffy's skin, desperately tugging and clawing,  trying to draw the Slayer closer to her.  Because everywhere they  touched, every place where their bodies were in contact with other  they felt fire.  </p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"Uhhhh," Cordelia moaned, biting down on her lip as the moan started  to erupt from her throat.  Her heels were digging into the mattress  as Buffy's mouth captured one of her already painfully erect nipples  and began to suck, her other hand manipulating Cordelia's other  breast as the brunette's hands bunched themselves in fists around the  bed sheets.  The brunette's mouth flew open, a long drawn out moan  that she just couldn't contain tearing from her throat as the  Slayer's lips, teeth, and fingers continued to attack her nipples.   Freeing themselves of the bed sheets, Cordelia's hands came to tangle  themselves in Buffy's hair holding her head in place as her chest  arched up into the blonde's mouth, begging for more of whatever she  was willing to give.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy pressed her lips to Cordelia's pulse point sucking on it hard  as her hand caressed the inside of Cordelia's thigh.  Her nails ran  lightly across the tanned skin of Cordelia's leg as she pressed  herself closer to brunette even though there was no place left for  her to go.  Cordelia arched up into Buffy, blindly seeking out her  lips, which Buffy gladly gave over to her, groaning as the brunette  sucked her tongue into her mouth, kissing her fervently.  </p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The only thing that Buffy was aware of was the sound of Cordelia's  voice — the soft sounds she was making in the back of her throat and  the sound of her name coming out of her mouth in ragged, desire  filled gasps — and the sound of her own breathing.  The body beneath  hers was now moving in a frenzy, a blur of activity as Buffy  continued to move her hand in and out, her lips and her free hand  caressing and exploring every and all available patches of skin.  And  then she felt it.  Cordelia's body tensed, her breath hitching one  last time before wave after wave of pleasure ripped through her body,  taking her breath away.  And as Cordelia surged against her, forcing  her further in, Buffy pressed herself down onto the brunette one last  time before she too lost the ability to make sound all together.</p>

<p>Buffy watched her hand as her fingers slowly trailed up and around  Cordelia's abdominal muscles, raising and falling with the brunette's  gentle breathes.  "That tickles," she heard the woman say a moment  later, her hand coming to rest on top of Buffy's, flattening the  Slayer's hand down so that it was merely resting on her stomach  instead of playing with it.  "Can I please have some of the blanket  now, or were you planning to molest me all morning too?" she  continued as Buffy tilted her head up to look at her.</p>

<p>"Molest?" the Slayer asked quirking an amused eyebrow at  Cordelia.  "That's funny.  Last night I could have sworn you were  saying `yes, YES'," she continued removing her hand from underneath  the brunette's and dragging the sheet up so that it covered the other  girl mid-section.</p>

<p>"At least I was saying it quietly," Cordelia responded a moment  later, a smile beginning to work it's way across her face as she  remembered what exactly it was that Buffy did to her to make her  agree so vigorously.  She supposed she shouldn't have been surprised  though, Buffy had demonstrated numerous times in the past that she  was in possession of an impressive amount of imagination.</p>

<p>"So what does this mean?" Buffy asked laying her head down on her  pillow and staring up at the ceiling.  She supposed that she should  have been feeling rather freaked out.  She had, after all, just slept  with another woman. Moreover, that other woman had been Cordelia  Chase of all people, Cordelia.  Yep, that was definitely material for  freaking out, yet she found that she was oddly calm.</p>

<p>"Couple more nights of good sleep?" Cordelia suggested, her eyes idly  roaming around Buffy's bedroom.  She could've addressed the question  on a deeper level, made it a poignant study about life, about love,  about loving in life and journey's in and love and a bunch of other  shit, but she didn't particularly feel like taking stock of how what  happened between them last night would effect her as a person or  whatever.  She wanted to concentrate on the fact that once she had  actually fallen asleep it had been a fitful one that she hadn't woken  from once.  She wanted to concentrate on the fact that just laying  there she felt more relaxed than she had since her first day as the  Pylean Queen.  She just wanted to concentrate on the fact that  whatever it was that happened, it was good.</p>

<p>"I can deal with that," Buffy responded turning her head to side so  that she was looking at the brunette.  "Yeah," she continued, "a  couple more good nights sleep," she went on hovering above Cordelia's  face as the woman turned to look at her.  "I can definitely deal with  that," and with that Buffy leaned down bringing their lips together  once more.  She couldn't remember the last time dealing had been this  much fun.</p>

<hr>

<p>"What's your secret?" Willow asked making her way over to the table  where Cordelia was sitting.  The gang plus a Cordy and minus a Buffy  and Dawn were congregated as usual at the Magic Box, with a  cornucopia of books surrounding them.  Buffy had taken off for a  Parent-Teacher conference at Dawn's school which had left Cordelia  wondering around the house aimlessly until Willow had dragged her to  the shop to try and see if she could find anything in the texts about  the creature she had seen in her vision – even those Cordelia  insisted that she hadn't really seen anything.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Cordelia asked turning to face the redhead.  At the moment she  was desperately missing Wesley and Fred and their insane yet  effective research methods.  She had gotten out of practice and  didn't really care to get in practice again.  </p>

<p>"With Buffy," Willow clarified brushing an arrant strand of hair away  from her face.  "She's been talking to you," the redhead continued  her face falling slightly.  "She hasn't talked to me, not really, not  since…" she paused there, still not liking to think about what had  happened those few short months ago.  "What's your secret?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been here," Cordelia replied in a kind of half sigh after  a moment.  There was no secret really, Buffy wanted to talk, it would  have been impossible for her to not want to talk.  You just had to  ask her the right questions, the tough questions, and nobody but her  seemed to be willing to do it.  She knew they had to have figured it  out, Buffy was a stubborn jackass, she always had been, and if you  let her get away with saying nothing she would just keep on doing  it.  She knew they knew that and she also knew that they would never  be able to ask her, because making her talk about it would hurt her  before it would help her and they couldn't bear to do anything that  would hurt her.  "Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers."</p>

<p>"You're not exactly strangers," Willow responded turning her head to  the side to get a better look at the brunette.  Even when Cordelia  and the Scoobies actively hated each other so many years ago the  brunette could hardly have been referred to as a stranger.  Willow  knew that she certainly felt like she saw a lot of the brunette than  she cared to back in the day.</p>

<p>"True, nearly being eaten by evil snakes together, tends to bring  people closer," the brunette agreed with a rueful smile.  "But we  were hardly friends," she continued shaking her head  thoughtfully.  "Not like she was with you and Xander anyway."</p>

<p>Willow nodded in understanding, before letting out a loud  sigh.  "It's just that it's so…"</p>

<p>"Frustrating?  Irritating?  Makes you want to beat them with a shovel… ing?" Cordelia asked smirking at the redhead and her  expression.  "Don't' forget, I too know the friendship of a taciturn  avenger."</p>

<p>"Angel's like this too?" Willow asked though she wasn't really  surprised.  She heard that he had lightened up a bit, but with the  excessive brooding that he'd done in the past, him lightening up  would probably still have left him in the charcoal gray area of the  colour spectrum.</p>

<p>"I think he's the one she got it from," Cordelia answered shaking her  head.  The truth was that even though she was the one who brought him  up, she didn't really want to think about him at the moment, or at  any moments coming up.   The events of the night before were still  fresh in her mind, and even though she knew that Angel and Buffy were  forever more going to be a past tense, and even though she could semi- justify things by saying that she had no idea that anything like what  happened was going to happen…ever…in life, she was feeling slightly… what was that word…not quite the opposite of pride but close to it… guilty.  Yeah, she was feeling somewhat guilty and wanted to ignore  it.</p>

<p>"I just…I wanna see her happy, you know," Willow responded sighing  dramatically.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Cordelia responded.  She wanted the same thing.  "But you  can't gift wrap happiness and courier it to someone," she  continued.  "Buffy has to want it."</p>

<p>Willow nodded.  Cordelia wasn't saying anything that she hadn't  already thought of herself; it was just that the answer seemed to be  part of the problem.  "But Buffy hasn't seemed to want anything  lately," the witch finally replied in a despondent tone.  How could  wanting something be the answer to not wanting anything?  If someone  wanted something there would be no problem to begin with.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that," Cordelia replied with a droll tone,  not quite able to keep the huge smiley face she was making on the  inside stop from showing on the outside, as images of Buffy wanting  and taking came to her unbidden.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked not quite sure what to make of Cordelia's tone  or expression yet oddly encouraged by them nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Nothing," the brunette responded quickly straightening up in the  chair as she struggled to get her features back under  control.  "Sorry.   Yeah," she went on shifting in the chair  uncomfortably.  "So.  How's Amy?  Still a rat?"</p>

<p>Sensing a presence beside her Cordelia turned her head to the side  slowly cracking her eyes open.  She hadn't seen Buffy since the  Slayer had taken off earlier that day to attend the meeting at Dawn's  school, and feeling rather tired and not wanting to be presumptuous  she had taken up her spot on the Summer's couch again and settled  in.  "Home a little late aren't we?" the brunette asked looking up  into Buffy's face.  "Either that or extremely early."</p>

<p>"I got distracted by a song and dance number," the Slayer responded  her eyes focused on Cordelia intensely.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?" the brunette asked wondering if it had been wise to  leave the blonde alone for so long.</p>

<p>"Nothing…I just had the strangest night," Buffy responded shaking her  distractedly.  "I'll tell you about it tomorrow," she continued  taking a step back and offering her hand to the brunette.</p>

<p>"Ummm," the brunette responded grasping the blonde's hand allowing  herself to be pulled into a standing position.  "I'll remember," she  said turning her head to the side to watch Buffy as the Slayer began  to lead them up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Of that I have no doubt," Buffy responded softly a small smile  drifting her across her face as she opened the door to her bedroom  allowing Cordelia to enter the room.  "I'll just have to do my best  to occupy you until then," she continued, her smile growing as she  watched the brunette lift her shirt over her head and fling it to the  side.</p>

<p>"Promises, promises," Cordelia mumbled turning around to face Buffy.  </p>

<p>They turned out to be the last coherent words she was able to emote  quite some time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------</p>

<p>"Good morning, Buffy," Giles greeted as the blonde woman entered the  shop.</p>

<p>"Oh hey, did Dawn get off to school alright?" Willow asked looking up  as the Slayer entered the shop.  Buffy had been late getting down  that morning for some reason and the young brunette had been worried  about getting to school to time.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked turning distractedly to face Willow.  "Oh, uh,  yeah.  I think," she continued, the redhead's question finally  registering with her as she scanned the store for a certain  brunette.  One who wasn't at all happy with her for hurriedly taking  off earlier and thus avoiding the conversation she had promised to  have with her if the brunette let her have her way the night before.</p>

<p>"Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!" she heard Xander chanting  from her side.</p>

<p>"That's still funny, sweetie," Anya told him encouragingly on her way  to the counter.  However as Buffy turned her attention to Xander's  side and saw Cordelia staring at him sternly, she realized that Anya  was probably the only one who still found it amusing and that if she  didn't distract everyone with strange happens soon, Cordelia was  going to be looking at her with that expression.</p>

<p>"So, uh, no new research?" Buffy asked making her way into the middle  of the store.  "Nothing new going on?  Monsters or whatnot?" she  continued, ignoring the look Cordelia sent her as the others shook  their heads no.  "Good!" she declared upon seeing their  reactions.  "Good," she continued less certainly as the events of the  night before came back to her.  "Uh, so, did anybody ... uh ... last  night, you know, did anybody, um ... burst into song?"</p>

<p>"Merciful Zeus," Xander cried dropping his donut back onto the plate,  as the rest of the room's occupants rushed over to the table.</p>

<p>"We thought it was just us!" Willow stated excitedly looking over at  Tara.</p>

<p>"Well, I sang but I had my guitar at the hotel..." Giles responded  glancing at everyone else.</p>

<p>"It was bizarre. We were talking and then it was like-" Tara  interjected animatedly.</p>

<p>"You were in a musical!" Buffy said finishing Tara's sentence.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what it was," Cordelia said looking over at the two  girls.  "I'd heard noises but figured that what two people choose to  do in the sanctity of their own bedroom is…"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Tara responded nodding in Buffy's direction.  "And hey!" she  said looking at Cordelia who suddenly found the seam of her pants  extremely interesting.</p>

<p>"That would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the  synchronized dancing from the room service chaps," Giles added  looking rather pleased at the turn the conversation had taken since  it meant that he wasn't going completely nutty.</p>

<p>"We did a whole duet about dish washing," Willow related.  "And  Cordelia accompanied us, no matter what she says."</p>

<p>"It was catchy, that's all," the brunette responded, even as she  thought back to the incident and realized that her participation had  been rather involuntary if highly amusing.</p>

<p>"And we were arguing and, and then everything rhymed and there were  harmonies and the dance with coconuts," Anya said jumping in not  liking the fact that Cordelia was speaking more than her.  Men liked  women who could speak.</p>

<p>"There was an entire verse about the couscous," Willow went on  shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Oh god the couscous," Cordelia muttered shaking her head.</p>

<p>"It was very disturbing," Xander said with a touch of bewilderment in  his voice.</p>

<p>"At least you didn't get couscous," the ex-cheerleader responded to  which Xander nodded.  That was very true.</p>

<p>"What did you sing about?" Giles asked looking at the Slayer.  This  discussion of couscous was getting them nowhere.</p>

<p>"I don't remember," the blonde replied, "but i-it seemed perfectly  normal."</p>

<p>"But disturbing.  And not the natural order of things," Xander added  in after Buffy finished speaking.  She probably just forgot to  mention that part, and he was nothing if not a helper.  "And do you  think it'll happen again?" he continued with a touch of dread in his  voice.  He really had more of an alone in the shower kind of singing  voice, definitely, but if this continued there were going to be  mountaintops and all that stuff and he just really wasn't up for that.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Giles said glancing down.  "I should look into it."</p>

<p>"With the books," Willow supplied.</p>

<p>"Of course with the books," Cordelia said shooting a look at Willow.   Like there was anything else with these people.</p>

<p>"Do we have any books on this?" Tara asked thoughtfully.  She'd never  come across a musical section before.</p>

<p>"Well we just gotta break it down," Xander said firmly.  "Look at the  factors before it happens again," he continued, "because I for one…"</p>

<p>"I've got a theory/ That it's a demon/ A dancing demon! /  No  something isn't right there," Giles began to sing, sitting down and  taking his glasses off in consternation.</p>

<p>"I've got a theory/ A kid is dreaming/ And we're all stuck inside his  wacky Broadway nightmare," Willow piped up as Tara accompanied her  with some jazz hands.</p>

<p>"I've got a theory we should work this out," Xander contributed.</p>

<p>"This isn't Fosse/ What are the jazz hands all about," Cordelia sang  shaking her head.  This was going to be a long, long, long, long,  long, long, couple of days.  And she didn't even need to have visions  to divine that.</p>

<p>"Don't think that I've forgotten," Cordelia said coming to a stop  beside Buffy and reaching up to place the book in her hand back on  the shelf.</p>

<p>"How could I with the death rays you've been sending me all day,"  Buffy muttered in a rather petulant tone.  First she has deal with  the entire town suddenly going Disney, and then Spike becomes Mr.  Even Worse Attitude after admitting to spying on her and Cordelia  while they were in the backyard the other night – somehow making it  sound like he had suffered a great injustice – and kicked her out of  his crypt while singing that dumbass song, and now Cordelia was  giving her attitude.</p>

<p>"I think death rays is tad strong," Cordelia started with a  frown.  "Perhaps icy…uh….ah…Buffy," she trailed off clutching her  head as her eyes closed painfully.  "Buffy," she repeated one last  time before the images began to flood into her brain, slamming into  her and causing her to stumble backwards.</p>

<p>"Cordy!" Buffy yelled moving around the brunette just in time to  catch her before she hit the ground.  "Giles!  Giles…Cordelia,  something's wrong!"</p>

<p>"Dawn.  At the Bronze.  Crazy Tommy Tune like guy's holding her.   He's the one.  Buffy's dancing … for him?" Cordelia choked out her  eyes still closed even though the pain was lessening now.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Buffy asked worriedly as the brunette began to  struggle into an upright position.  "I mean, god … are they always  like that?" the Slayer continued wondering if Cordelia had been  putting up with whatever that was for over two years now.</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Cordelia said struggling onto her feet with Buffy's  help.  "It's okay.  Really.  The demon that's got Dawn, it's the same  one from my vision in L.A.," she continued.  "I…"</p>

<p>However, as Cordelia was about to continue the door to the Magic Box  came flying open and Spike walked in dragging what looked like a  super-sized Chucky doll behind him.  It was, to put it mildly,  exceptionally creepy.</p>

<p>"Lookie, lookie what I found," the vampire stated flinging the thing  inside of the shop.</p>

<p>"Is this the demon guy?" Tara asked eyeing the odd looking creature.   Somehow she thought that it really looked more comical that evil.   And he in no way resembled Tommy Tune.</p>

<p>"Tara," Willow said happily seeing the girl come up behind her.   She'd gotten the impression that Tara had been avoiding her, and as  the blonde ignored her she realized that she had been right on the  mark with her earlier assessment which meant that something was  seriously wrong.</p>

<p>"Works for him," Spike responded.  "Has a nice little story for the  Slayer, don't you?  Come on then," she continued giving Chucky a none  to gentle shove.  "Sing."</p>

<p>"My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she  summoned him and at midnight he's going to take her to the underworld  to be his queen," Chucky stated calmly.</p>

<p>Spike glanced at the Scoobies who seemed be perfectly contended with  the dolls answer irritably.  Not only was Buffy wrapped around the  bloody cheerleader like she was a candy bar, no one in the room  seemed to give a ruddy damn that they didn't know anything about what  the dancing bad wanted.  "And what does he bloody well want?" the  vampire asked jerking the doll around again.</p>

<p>"Ah Spike," Buffy interrupted as the vampire raised his hand to hit  the hostage.  "We kind of already know that."</p>

<p>"How?" </p>

<p>"Cordelia had a vision," Tara replied taking a step back when the  vampire's lips curved upwards in a snarl.</p>

<p>"Well Cordelia's just bloody well got all of the answers doesn't  she," he muttered tightening his hold on the doll.  "What's next,  turning water into wine?" he asked tossing the doll out of the door.</p>

<p>"Did somebody get caught cheating at kitten poker again?" Cordelia  asked in a suedo-sympathetic voice.  "Uh ah," the brunette continued  as the vampire wiped around to face her.  "You don't want to hurt  yourself."</p>

<p>"Um, if Cordelia and Spike are finished re-introducing us to  kindergarten, do you think that we could maybe move on," Buffy  interjected stopping the vampire from retorting.  "Like onto maybe  forming a plan."</p>

<p>"Plan, schman.  Let's mount up," Xander said taking a step forward.   He had a thing for the Summers girls.  He just liked them, and there  was NO way Dawn was getting married before him!</p>

<p>"No," Giles said glancing over at Buffy sadly.  He had hoped to see  her begin to show some kind of interest in her life, to see her  begin – even if slowly—to take charge once more.  But, here she was  again, simply waiting for orders, unable or unwillingly to think for  herself.</p>

<p>"Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature,"  Anya began at Giles statement.  "But ... I've seen some of these  underworld child bride deals and, and they never end well," she  continued.  "Well, maybe once."</p>

<p>"We're not just gonna stay here," Willow said adding onto Anya's  unique critique of Giles' noninterference policy.</p>

<p>"Yes we are," Giles responded looking intently at Buffy.  "Buffy's  going alone."</p>

<p>Spike left out briefly disgusted laugh at that.  "Gah! Don't be a  stupid git. There is no…" the vampire began.  Buffy may have been  messing around with Skipper for now, but she was still his girl  whether she knew it or not, and he'd look out for her until she  realized that they meant for each other.</p>

<p>"If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll..." Giles began before pausing  briefly to consider his words.  "I'll never want your opinion," he  concluded looking hard at the vampire.</p>

<p>Willow watched the proceedings with a growing unease.  "A little  confusion spell could…"</p>

<p>"No!" Tara interjected cutting Willow off.  A little anything spell  was the last thing any of them needed.  "I mean I don't think it'll  help."</p>

<p>"Look, forget them Slayer.  I've got your back," Spike said stepping  forward.  He liked the little bit and didn't want anything to happen  to her, plus it couldn't help but win him brownie points with Buffy.   It was really a win, win situation.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted me to stay away from you?" Buffy responded  rather militantly, unconsciously leaning towards the warmth of  Cordelia's body.  "Isn't that what you sang?"</p>

<p>"Spike sing a widdle song?" Xander asked smiling at the idea.</p>

<p>"Would you say it was a break away pop hit or more of a book number?"  Anya asked edging her way into the circle and the conversation.</p>

<p>"Let it go, sweetie," Xander responded shaking his head.  Sometimes  the woman just tore the ass out of subjects, she had to learn to let  bygones be bygones gee golly.</p>

<p>"Fine," the vampire responded angrily as she noticed the Slayer's  motions.  If she wanted the bitch she could have her.  The brunette  was going to leave, just like all the others and Buffy could rot away  alone and miserable for all he cared.  "I hope you dance till you  burn," he spat at her.  "You and the little bit," and with those  parting remarks he huffed his way out of the shop.</p>

<p>"You're really not coming?" Buffy asked turning her head to look at  her Watcher.  She couldn't believe what she was hearing.  They were  just going to abandon her now?  They couldn't be bothered anymore?   She hadn't asked for them to bring her back, but they had, so that  what? They could stay home at night and carve fertility statues?</p>

<p>"It's up to you," Giles responded walking over to Buffy.  He could  see the hurt in her eyes, but he knew that it was for the best.</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to do?" the Slayer asked clearly upset.</p>

<p>"Your best," the older man responded.</p>

<p>Buffy clenched her jaw.  Her best.  Whatever.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy shoved her hands into her pockets as she stalked down the  darkened streets of downtown Sunnydale.  She was overwhelmed, she was  hated, she was alone, and she was numb.  "I touch the fire and it  freezes me/ I look in to it and it's black," she began to sing, her  heart contracting painfully.  Had it ever been warm?  Was it that  along ago?  "Why can't I feel?/ My skin should crack and peel," she  continued passing by an open fire and feeling nothing.  "I want the  fire back!"</p>

<p>"Now through the smoke/ She calls to me./  To make my way across the  flame/ To save the day," she sang her move forming a sorry excuse for  a smile, "or maybe melt away/ I guess it's all the same," she  continued shoving her hands into her pockets.  It didn't matter  anyway, whatever she did it was never enough, there were always more  and always death.</p>

<p>"So I will walk through the fire," she continued making her way down  the street.  "'Cause where else can I turn?  I will walk through the  fire/ And let it…"</p>

<hr>

<p>"I hope you dance till you burn," Cordelia repeated.  Spike's words  swirling around in her mind like endless dark clouds.  Images from  her visions flashing in mind, disjointed but pieces that could be put  together.  "Buffy surrounded by smoke," she continued.  "I hope you  dance till you burn…oh god!" she said whipping around to face the  others in the room.</p>

<p>"Will this do a thing to change her?/ Am I leaving Dawn in danger?/  Is my Slayer to far gone to care?/" Giles sang looking thoughtfully  into the distance.</p>

<p>"What if Buffy can't defeat it?" Xander sang looking around the room.</p>

<p>"Beady eye's is right," Anya joined in.</p>

<p>"We're needed," Cordelia continued.</p>

<p>"Or we could just sit around and glare," the ex-demon went on staring  at Willow and Tara.</p>

<p>Immediately they all rose, striding purposefully towards the door.</p>

<p>"We'll see it through/ That's what we're always here to do," they  sang together as they strode down the street.  "So we will walk  through the fire…"</p>

<hr>

<p>"Showtime!" Buffy heard from in front of her as she kicked the door  to the Bronze down and walked inside.  "I love a good entrance," the  demon continued.</p>

<p>"How are you with death scenes?" the Slayer asked looking up onto the  stage to make sure her sister was alright.</p>

<p>"You got a name?" she continued ignoring the creatures amused  laughter.</p>

<p>"I've got a hundred," Sweet responded with a smile.</p>

<p>"I ought to know what to call you if you're going to be my brother in  law," the Slayer continued taking up a relaxed stance against one of  the room's pool tables.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I swear I didn't…" Dawn started wondering why she constantly  had to be the damsel in distress.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, you're not going anywhere," the Slayer said  interrupting her sister.  "I am."</p>

<p>"What?" Sweet asked leaning forward.  This was an unexpected, though  not totally unwelcome change.</p>

<p>"Deal's this," Buffy said meeting his gaze.  "I can't kill you…you  take me to Hellsville in her place," she continued her voice almost  as flat as she was feeling.</p>

<p>"What if I kill you?" Sweet asked intrigued by the Slayer's response  to the whole situation.</p>

<p>"Trust me.  Won't help," the blonde deadpanned meeting the demon's  gaze.</p>

<p>"That's gloomy," Sweet responded.</p>

<p>"That's life," Buffy replied checking her instinct to frown at the  feeling of déjà vu that came over her.</p>

<p>"Come on now, is that really how you feel?" Sweet asked.  "Isn't life  a miraculous thing?" he continued in a teasing tone.</p>

<p>"I think you already know," Buffy replied pushing off of the pool  table.  "Life's a show/ And we all play our parts/ And when the music  starts," she sang, opening up her jacket as she went along.  "We open  up our hearts," she went on moving forward as her jacket dropped to  the ground.  "It's alright/ If some things come out wrong/ We'll sing  a happy song/ And you can sing along," she continued grabbing a pool  cue and some of Sweet's minions approached her from the sides.</p>

<p>"Everywhere there's life," she sang hitting one of the minions with  the cue.  "There's hope/ Every day's," she continued elbowing one, "A  gift. Wishes can," kick, "come true/ Whistle while/ You work/ So  hard/ All day," she continued impaling the last of the minions.</p>

<p>"To be like other girls," she continued as the Scoobies arrived.  "To  fit in to this glittering world," she continued wistfully.  "Don't  give me songs/ Don't give me songs," she continued as Anya and Tara  began to dance behind her.</p>

<p>"Give me something to sing about…" she cried desperately.  Make it  enough; she needed it to be enough.</p>

<hr>

<p>"All the joy/ Life sends," Buffy continued working herself up into a  frenzy, wanting to stop but not knowing how.  "Family/ And friends/  All the twists/ And bends/ Knowing that/ It ends/ Well that/  Depends," she continued wishing that her mouth would shut yet at the  same time becoming oddly glad that it wouldn't.  "On if they let you  go/ On if they know enough to know/ That when you've bowed/ You leave  the crowd," she went on walking up onto the stage, her gaze shifting  between the others and Sweet.</p>

<p>"There was no pain/No fear, no doubt/ Till they pulled me out/ Of  Heaven," she continued noticing Giles and Xander's shocked  faces.  "So that's my refrain/I live in Hell/ `Cause I've been  expelled/From Heaven/ I think I was in Heaven," she went on  softly.  "So give me something to sing about…"</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia watched as Buffy looked out at them desperately before  flipping off of the stage.  She turned to look at the Scoobies who  were standing by in some sort of stupor as Buffy began to dance and  dance and dance.  Faster and faster she moved, spinning wildly until  smoke began to curl off of her.  </p>

<p>"Buffy!" she called out stepping forward, her shoulder colliding with  something.  Turning her head she spotted Spike beside her.  She  hadn't realized when he had shown up, but apparently he had the same  idea she did.  </p>

<p>They watched each other for the briefest of moments, then eyes  blaring with some emotion the brunette didn't have the time to  identify, the vampire stepped back allowing Cordelia access to the  Slayer.</p>

<p>"Life's not a play," Cordelia sang grasping Buffy's shoulders,  slowing the Slayer's motions down.  "It isn't bliss/ It's just this,"  she continued as Buffy stared at her.  "It's living," the brunette  went on.  "You'll find a way," she sang, brushes a stray strand of  the Slayer's hair away.  "Those feelings of pain/ Only you can  repair/ By living.  You have to go on living.  Believe in living,"  Cordelia continued as Buffy stared at her.</p>

<p>Buffy stared into the brunette's dark eyes, the shimmering, dark  orbits anchoring her as emotions churned inside of her like the sea  during a storm.  She didn't want to feel like this anymore.  She  couldn't take feeling like this anymore.</p>

<p>"The hardest thing in this world…is to live in it," she heard her  sister say from behind Cordelia.  Her voice quivering slightly as she  recalled the Slayer's words.  </p>

<p>And Buffy remembered then.  She remembered what love felt like.  She  remembered loving Dawn so much that she died for her, and how  beautiful and terrible an emotion it was.  She remembered how happy  she was to see Giles when he returned and how she was unable to  convey to him just how glad she was to see him.  She remembered the  endless comedy that was kitten poker, and she remembered Cordelia  trying to chase her down with the shopping cart at the grocery  store.  She remembered the way the brunette's lips felt against hers,  and how wonderful it felt to feel Cordelia's warm body sliding  against her own, warming her in places that had been so cold.  She  remembered that cartoon they always used to show after Care Bears  where the little boy shared his double scoop with his sister after  she dropped hers and how it always made her feel warm and fuzzy  inside.  She remembered how much fun it had been trying to teach  Willow to skate until the redhead had decided that sitting on the ice  was more her speed, and much more fun it had been meeting with Xander  for hot chocolate after.  She remembered that things could be good…if  you'd let them.</p>

<p>So, remembering this, Buffy leaned into the brunette's arms allowing  the other woman to pull her into a tender embrace.  And lying her  head against Cordelia's chest, her eyes closing as she sighed softly,  she let it feel good.</p>

<p>"So everything's alright?" Angel asked, his relief clear even through  the muffled tones of the receiver.  He'd been getting increasing  agitated as the days had worn on and he hadn't heard anything from  her.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, everything's fine.  She's completely alive … and, dare I say  it, finally on the mend," the brunette responded.  "How did the stuff  at the warehouse go?"</p>

<p>"You know, slash.  Kick.  People running away in a blind panic.   Consult the books.  Swords.  Methane tanks.  The usual," the vampire  responded trying to sound nonchalant.  The truth was, though it had  taken a couple of days, they hadn't had much trouble dispensing with  the small group of demons that had kidnapped the boy.  But, it just  hadn't been the same without Cordelia there.  He didn't know quite  how to explain it, but things just seemed off somehow with the  brunette gone, and the others had felt it too.  The fact was, that  he'd be glad when she came back.  "So, when can we expect the  pleasure of you're company?" </p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning I guess," the brunette responded.  It had been a  couple days since the musical incident ended, and while things with  Willow and Tara seemed a little tense, and the Scoobies interactions  with the Slayer were still rather strained, Buffy seemed to be taking  whatever epiphany she had at the Bronze that night to heart.  She  wouldn't have minded sticking around a little more to see how things  turned out, to maybe help Buffy ease back into life a bit more, but  she knew that if she didn't leave soon she was going to be sucked  into something bigger than whatever it was that had been going on  between her and Slayer, and she couldn't wait for that.  She had  responsibilities to get back to in L.A.  "Everything here is slowly  getting back to normal … so, no more Cordy."</p>

<p>"We'll all," the vampire started pausing, then sighing.  "I'll be  glad when you're back.  The hotel has been missing a certain …  Cordyosity."</p>

<p>"You mean horribly bad coffee?" the brunette asked. "Of course," Angel responded.  "We've been able to drink it for the  last week.  I don't think that Fred has been able to get to sleep for  the last three days."</p>

<hr>

<p>"So," Dawn began looking at her sister dubiously.  "What you're  saying is that the Bretton Woods project was a task undertaken by the  world's leading thinkers in cracker technology to create a new and  better biscuit?" she went on. "And that this all became possible  because of amazing discoveries that Gen. Poncho Villa made during the  invasion of Normandy?"</p>

<p>Buffy shifted uncomfortably in her chair as her sister summed up the  conversation they had just had into a few very compact, very  incredulous sentences.  It had seemed a lot better when she was  making it up.</p>

<p>"Buffy did ever even GO to school?" Dawn asked shaking her head.  She  may not have read the homework, or paid much attention in class, but  she knew that Poncho Villa didn't have anything to do with the  invasion of Normandy, and was willing to bet her `No String's  Attached' cd that Bretton Woods didn't have anything to do with  crackers … even though Bretton crackers were very yummy with spread.</p>

<p>"I did," Buffy replied huffily looking over at Dawn.  "Occasionally I  did," she continued playing with the scone on the plate in front of  her.  "Once or twice," she went on glancing over at Dawn.</p>

<p>She held her sisters gaze for a moment, each of them staring at each  other intensely, before they both began making little hmph-ing sounds  in there throats which quickly led to full out laughing.</p>

<p>"I seriously fail to see how writing a history paper could be this  much fun," Cordelia stated walking into the kitchen eyeing the two  laughing Summers girls with a touch of amusement and concern.  What  could possibly be that funny?</p>

<p>"It is if Buffy's the one giving you source material," Dawn replied  cracking up again.  "Poncho Villa," she continued shaking her  head.  "Ass."</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy responded.  "He was very important to development of  commercially marketing the hooded sweater jacket!"</p>

<p>"Was this before or after he personally defeated Dr. No in his island  fortress of extremely stupid evil?" Dawn asked smirking at Buffy.   She'd missed this, them just sitting around snarking at each other in  the way only sisters can do and still love each other in the  morning.  She'd missed Buffy.</p>

<p>"Oh go to bed," Buffy replied pointing at the door.  Dawn stuck out  her tongue.  "No  seriously," Buffy continued.  "Go to bed.  It's past midnight." "I would so kill to get my hands on one of your old papers," the  brunette stated with a smile sitting down across from the Slayer.</p>

<p>"I hear they're actually handing them out to the kids now as  warnings, skip class and this could happen to you," Buffy responded  shaking her head with an exaggerated sigh.  "My personal favorite  was `Nuts to the Middle Ages'.  I based the whole essay on five  minutes of a documentary I saw on PBS one night.  It would've been  good, it could've been good…you know if the documentary had actually  been on the Middle Ages," she continued smirking at the  brunette.  "And if I had left out the little rant about genetically  engineered, super intelligent monkey's surviving us icies on the  moon."</p>

<p>"You're a strange girl, aren't you Buffy?" Cordelia asked the other  woman, her eyes twinkling with amusement.</p>

<p>"Professionally," the Slayer responded with a grin, before becoming  pensive as she regarded the brunette.  "When?" she asked finally her  eyes drifting about the kitchen.</p>

<p>"When what?" Cordelia responded, not surprised but still confused by  Buffy's abrupt subject change.</p>

<p>"When are you leaving?" the Slayer asked looking back over at the  former debutante.</p>

<p>"Oh," the brunette replied with sigh, slumping down in her chair  slightly.  "Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I bet the business is crumbling without you," Buffy commented,  suddenly finding the tabletop very interesting.</p>

<p>"You have no idea.  I really wonder about those people.  The only  thing I don't have to schedule for them are bathes," Cordelia  responded in a fond tone though she shook her head as if it were an  absolutely exasperating experience just thinking about them.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment as she considered what had been said.   The truth was that she had become quite fond of the brunette and she  didn't at all want her to go.  In fact she would have been quite  pleased with Cordelia staying with them, with her indefinitely.  But  she knew that it couldn't be that way.  </p>

<p>"I should give you a proper send off," the blonde began moments  later, pushing out of her chair and standing up.</p>

<p>"What did you have in mind?" the brunette asked looking over at the  Slayer questioningly.</p>

<p>"Follow me and I'll show you," the Slayer responded, a truly  lecherous grin spreading across her features as her eyes raked  themselves over the brunette's body, before she turned and headed for  the door.</p>

<p>"Different cork than I was expecting," Cordelia mumbled to herself  standing up.  "But it works for me," she continued with a grin.  Oh,  sweet Sunnydale.</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia stood looking out of the Summers bay window.  The Scoobies  were congregated outside on the lawn with her luggage talking about  something or the other, probably wedding plans from the look on  Willow's face.  They'd been inside moments before saying their  goodbyes, but had left after the hugs and the `good to see yous' to  wait for Cordelia's cab.  As for the brunette herself, she was  waiting for a certain Slayer to make her appearance so that they  could say a proper goodbye to each other.  A private goodbye, worth  of the bond formed between them over the past week.</p>

<p> "I didn't say it the first time you left…you know, because I  wouldn't have meant it," Buffy started with an impish little grin as  she stepped off the last stair.  "But I'm going to miss you," she  continued coming to stop in front of the brunette who was now facing  her.  Her voice dropped intimately as she looked at the other woman  and she had to struggle to suppress the urge she was feeling to  stroke the brunette's cheek.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Cordelia responded looking down at the Slayer  thoughtfully.  "You're temporary sweetener," she continued a ghost a  smile making it's way across her face.  For some reason she was  feeling an intense desire to wrap the smaller woman in her arms and  squeezing her as tightly to her as she could without injuring either  of them.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy stated taking a step towards the other woman.  "No  Sweet ' n ' Low, just you," she continued softly.  "If things were  different," she went on dropping her head down not quite sure that  she should be voicing the thoughts that were running through her  head.  "I don't' know, if things were different I guess that things  could be different."</p>

<p>"You'd join the parade with Kim and Kerry over there," the brunette  asked flickering her head towards the window indicating Willow and  Tara who were waiting outside with the others and her luggage.   Truthfully, she never considered that she would consider considering  herself one of those women who wore shirts saying `I'm not gay, but  my girlfriend is'.  But she had never considered considering that she  might end up working for a vampire, while getting visions from a  higher power that helped her be a champion of justice, before  becoming a Queen in an alternate dimension.  So all things  considered, what she considered considering didn't really mean that  much.</p>

<p>"Well, I already march to my own drummer," the Slayer responded  grinning at the brunette.  She should have figured that the brunette  would've been able to figure out what she was getting at.</p>

<p>"And I step to my own tune," the ex-cheerleader responded seriously  before pausing for a second, then leaning down and brining their lips  together.  Drawing the blonde into her tenderly as her hands came to  rest of the Slayer's hips, deepening the kiss as they stayed locked  together in that sweet embrace for long moments.  </p>

<p>"I've gotta go," Cordelia whispered reluctantly, taking a step back  from the blonde in an attempt to collect herself.</p>

<p>"You will call, won't you?" Buffy asked as the brunette opened up the  front door.  "I may be reanimated tissue but I'm a still a lady," she  continued trying to make herself sound only half as demanding as she  was feeling.</p>

<p>"I…" Cordelia started to say turning around to face Buffy.  "I will,"  she continued softly smiling at the Slayer before turning back around  and heading down the steps.  The cab had just pulled into the  driveway, and she wouldn't look back.</p>
