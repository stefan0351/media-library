<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 6 -->

<p><i>*NOTE* Brooke's POV</i></p>

<p>I blinked into the darkness of the room drowsy and disoriented, but  that only lasted for a moment.  Even though I hadn't heard the sound  again since waking up I knew wake it had been, it had been a nightly  ritual from the day I had come home.  Then, as I reached for the edge  of my blanket to pull it off I heard it, a small whimper being  carried through the open doors of our bathroom.  Sam.  I sighed  softly standing up, placing my weight on my good leg as I felt around  for my cane.  Once I felt it's cool surface against my hand I ran my  free hand through my hair and headed for the door.</p>

<p>I didn't even need to turn on a light because the route from my room  to Sam's had by then become instinctual.  I had made the trip in the  dark depths of the night so many times I no longer needed to think  about.  </p>

<p>The sounds grew louder as I entered the bathroom, and they sounded to  me as if they were coming for frequently.  I would have quickened my  steps at the sound of this, but I was going as fast as I safely  could.  It was just that hearing her like that killed me a little  every whimper; it was like being stabbed with tiny little knives.</p>

<p>As I entered her room, the plush softness of her carpet contrasting  distractingly with the coolness of the bathrooms tile, I saw her  tangled up in her sheets tossing and turning.  As I got closer I  could see a thin sheen of sweat covering her face and that her hair  was damp and matted.  I looked down at her, my heart contracting  painfully as I considered what to do.  Normally I wouldn't want to  wake her, but considering the fact that the demons she was fighting  seemed to be in her dreams, waking her seemed to be the most human  thing to do.</p>

<p>I reached down placing my hand on her shoulder squeezing it gently.</p>

<p>"Sam," I said, my voice a whisper even though I was supposed to be  waking her up.  "Sam," I repeated, but she was still asleep now  struggling in my grasp.</p>

<p>Carefully I placed one of my knees on the bed so that I could lean  over Sam and I placed my hands on both sides of her face, trying to  steady her.  "Sam," I said more firmly.  "Sam wake up."</p>

<p>This time she stopped struggling and I felt her body relax, her  breath steadying.  Slowly her eyes fluttered open.  "Oh Sam," I said  quietly brushing her hair out of her face.  "This isn't good."</p>

<p>"What?" she asked taking her eyes away from mine and letting them  roam around the darkness.   I sighed, and then shifted settling  myself so that I was steady.  </p>

<p>"I'm the one that got run over and you're the one that looks like  shit.  Something in this equation doesn't add up," I said cupping her  chin and bringing her eyes back to mine.</p>

<p>"Right," she said struggling into an upright position.  "And then you  went unconscious.  You didn't have to see the blood, or the angle  your leg was bent at, or see the seizures and hear the little wheezes  you were making as you struggled to breathe," she said staring me in  the eye.  "I did Brooke, I did," she said shaking her head and  lowering her gaze, her voice sounding hollow and broken.</p>

<p>I didn't know how to respond to that so I too merely dropped my gaze  leaving the room in silence.  She was right of course, I didn't see  the aftermath of the crash, I barely had time to process anything  before the car hit me, and after I woke up everything was neat and  clean, and bandaged, and I was being legally drugged up.  I had  gotten the clinical side of the accident and Sam got the bloody  mess.  I probably would have been having nightmares too.</p>

<p>"I keep on seeing it, reliving it.  I thought you were dead.   Everyone was yelling, saying you were dead," she said finally, her  head still turned away from mine.</p>

<p>"But you didn't let go," I responded a small smile coming over my  face as I turned to look at her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Sam asked turning around sharply to face me.</p>

<p>"You were holding my hand," I said softly.  "All the way to the  hospital until the doctors dragged you away," I continued peeking  over at her.  At first I had thought that it was a dream, a figment  of my imagination.  But later, after I had woken up I learned that it  was true.  That Sam had been there the whole time.</p>

<p>"You were conscious!?!" Sam gasped sounding absolutely horrified.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," I responded.  "It was more like a dream, like  floating in water.  I didn't hurt and I couldn't see but I could feel  this presence, you," I went on snorting as I shook my head  ruefully.  "I know it sounds cheesy, Joanna Kerns movie of the week  cheesy, but it's true."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say anything?" she asked in a rather confused voice  as soon as I finished.  I couldn't blame her really; we had become so  close after the accident, almost existing within our own little  world.  It just didn't make sense that I wouldn't have told her and  now she wanted to know why.</p>

<p>"I don't know, it's just not something that's easily lends itself to  conversation," I responded.  "What was I suppose to say, `gee thanks  for the cupcake, and by the way I could feel you while I was dying'?"</p>

<p>"I see your point," was her response accompanied by a brief little  smile.</p>

<p>"Look," I said focusing on her fully.  "Do you want me to stay?"</p>

<p>"I…" she started to say then stopped.  </p>

<p>I could see that she was struggling with something; I had learned to  read her rather well over the past few weeks, the subtle changes to  her face and body language.  I knew that she had to be feeling rather  horrible after weeks of restless sleep.  I knew that I was the  catalyst of all of the nightmares, and that in the hospital when we  slept together that she slept fitfully, and for no other reason that  her own well being I hoped that she took me up on the answer.  </p>

<p>"Would you?" she asked finally.</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said simply.</p>

<p>Her response to that was to simply slide over to the left making room  for me on the bed.</p>

<p>"Do you need help?" she asked watching as I rested my cane up against  her bedside table.</p>

<p>"Nah," I said turning around to face her.  "Really, I'm coming along  quite well," I continued as I slipped under the covers, dropping my  head onto Sam's pillow.  It smelled of her shampoo and I breathed in  deeply as I turned to face her.  "The doctors say it's probably due  to a high calcium diet and an overprotective step-sister," I  continued smiling.</p>

<p>"Very funny," she muttered staring up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I was only half joking," I said nudging her with my shoulder  playfully.  "Dr. Alvery says recovery is like half mental, and that  the patients with strong family support tend to get better faster," I  went on.  "And you've helped most of all."</p>

<p>"Me?" Sam asked blinking in genuine surprise.  "Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes really," I responded.  "Mom and Dad have been great, but you…I  don't have a word for what you've been.  All I can say is I don't  know what I would have done if you hadn't been around.  You've been  like this angel."</p>

<p>She stared at me for a long time after that, her eyes darting around  my face, studying me before she looked away and tugged at her ear  nervously.  I had always found that particular gesture to be  scandalously cute, but I found it even more adorable up close.</p>

<p>"Thanks for staying with me," I heard her say softly a few moments  after she looked away.</p>

<p>"It's alright," I replied.  "I kind of missed our sleepovers," I  continued truthfully.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" she responded smiling somewhat impishly, "me too." </p>
