<!-- Not So Bad Beer \ Part 2 -->

<p>The trip back from the washroom to their dorm room passed by uneventfully for the most part. There was the tiny matter of Buffy trying to take off the robe continually, but Willow caught her before she was able to open it up. At least she thought she had caught her before she was able to open it up.</p>
<p>After ushering Buffy into their room Willow relaxed notably. There was considerably less Buffy could do in the sanctity of their room that would be spread across the campus. Now all she had to do was find something to entertain Buffy for a few minutes while she changed. They weren't going to go through the 'naked, nude, unclothed bodies in close proximity to each other' thing again anytime soon. Not if Willow Rosenberg had anything to say about it.</p>
<p>&#34;Well, look at that,&#34; Willow said walking over to her snow globe. Buffy followed her. &#34;Here,&#34; Willow said handing the sphere over to her friend.  &#34;You tip it like this,&#34; Willow instructed while demonstrating how the globe worked.</p>
<p>&#34;Snow go up…snow go down,&#34; Buffy said turning the globe. &#34;Up…down…up…down…&#34; Willow smiled and headed over to her closet.</p>
<p>Pulling out her pajamas Willow quickly changed into them not wanting to get caught by Buffy again. She could still hear Buffy talking to her new friend, but she decided to play it safe. The cave slayer could be sneaky when she wanted to. Peaking out from around the door once she was dressed Willow saw that Buffy was now trying to use reverse psychology on the snow globe. She would say up then turn the globe down and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#34;That's so cute,&#34; Willow thought to herself. &#34;No wait,&#34; she continued to think turning her head away. &#34;That's not cute, not cute at all. Buffy is not cute…Buffy's sexy…..No wait, Buffy's not sexy, I repeat not sexy in the least, she gorgeous…No wait…she's…&#34; Willow stopped thinking and closed her eyes, she was starting to hyper ventilate. After taking a few deep breaths she spoke to herself softly. &#34;Okay,&#34; she started. &#34;You are calm and strong…like the mighty oak.&#34; Then she steeled herself and re-entered the room.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said in a tone that was way too chipper.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Buffy repeated in a similar tone as she turned her attention away from the snow globe and over to Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Why don't we get you out of that and…&#34; before Willow could finish the sentence Buffy had torn the robe from her body. &#34;…into something more comfortable,&#34; Willow said finishing the sentence softly. So much for avoiding the nude, there was now plenty of nude. There was nude all over the place and it was very well lit.</p>
<p>&#34;Comfortable,&#34; Buffy said stretching. Despite her best intentions Willow found herself watching the display attentively. She watched the way Buffy's muscles played under her skin, and the way the light reflected off of her perfectly tanned skin.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh my,&#34; Willow muttered to herself closing her eyes. This was not good.  This was not good at all. Bad, bad, hormones.</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Willow said finally pulling herself together. &#34;Forget the comfortable part, let's just concentrate on the something. Let's just get you into something,&#34; she continued moving over to Buffy's drawers to find some clothes for her.</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked moving over so that she was standing behind Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Because,&#34; Willow answered acutely aware of Buffy's presence behind her.  She could feel the other girls warmth wrapping around her like a blanket.  &#34;People wear clothes in today's society. There are laws about it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked again moving closer so that she could see over Willow's shoulder.</p>
<p>&#34;Because,&#34; Willow said her voice catching in her throat a bit. &#34;We can't just walk around naked.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked again.</p>
<p>&#34;Because…because it leads to fornication and…and orgies,&#34; Willow finally responded trying to concentrate on looking through the drawers.</p>
<p>&#34;So?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow paused in her searching. She hadn't thought about it that way.</p>
<p>&#34;So…so this is college…we don't do that here,&#34; Willow responded flustered.  She had to get them off of the topic of nudity and orgies. &#34;Buffy, please,&#34; Willow said softly turning around. &#34;Just put on some clothes…I'm begging over here,&#34; Willow continued trying to keep her eyes above Buffy's neck.</p>
<p>Buffy was silent for a moment. She just stood there watching Willow, studying her. Then she responded. &#34;Okay,&#34; she agreed sullenly as she looked down at the floor. She clearly didn't want to be putting on any clothes, but she didn't want to upset Willow either, she wanted Willow to be happy, so she agreed.</p>
<p>&#34;Really?&#34; Willow asked surprised. &#34;Good,&#34; she added quickly before Buffy could change her mind. &#34;Alright, let's see what we've got here,&#34; Willow said turning back to the drawers.</p>
<p>Even thought Buffy had agreed to put something on it took Willow quite some time still to find something that the girl was actually willing to put on.  The floor of the room was covered with the rejects Buffy had tossed away.  Finally, Willow was able to get Buffy to at least put on a pair of underwear and a tank top. It still didn't leave a lot to the imagination, and Willow would have preferred a complete ensemble, but, well it was better than nothing.</p>

<p>Willow was tired, she was very tired, and therein lay the problem because Buffy wasn't tired. She had tried everything to get Buffy to go to sleep, she really had. She offered to part with her snow globe and everything, but the answer was still a no. Finally, she just lay down on her bed staring at the ceiling hoping that Buffy would wear herself out soon.</p>
<p>Buffy watched Willow flop down on her bed and close her eyes. She watched her for moment from her bed, then she walked over to Willow's bed and sat down on the side brushing some stray strands of hair out of Willow's face.  Willow's eyes popped open at the touch and looked up meeting Buffy's gaze with her own.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, hello,&#34; was all Willow was able to get out, and that was a whisper.  She knew that she should look away, but she just couldn't, she was caught.  Caught in Buffy's gaze, and in her beauty. Even in this devolved state Buffy was startlingly beautiful, still had an aura about her that drew Willow in completely.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy stay here,&#34; Buffy said still not breaking their eye contact. Willow knew instinctively that Buffy meant that she wanted to stay there on the bed with her. No, Willow thought to herself, absolutely not. Completely unacceptable, I will not stand for that!</p>
<p>&#34;Okay,&#34; was what actually came out of her mouth however. It was nice to know that her mind and her mouth were operating together.</p>
<p>Willow shifted on the bed to make room for Buffy who then proceeded to lay down beside her. Once Buffy was settled she placed Willow's head on her shoulder and began to play with the hackers hair. Willow remained still and let Buffy play with her hair, but she didn't relax. She couldn't. She kept on thinking about how she shouldn't be allowing this to happen, how it was taking advantage of Buffy's situation. She knew that none of it would have been happening if Buffy was herself, and that's why she should stop it.  Because she was enjoying the attention and the touching way too much.</p>
<p>Just as Willow was in the final stages of drifting off to sleep she felt it. Soft lips being pressed against hers. It was gentle and sweet, like  kissing a cloud. After a moment more Willow opened her mouth and allowed the kiss to be deepened. Finally after minutes of gentle exploration the lips pulled away and Willow felt a hand on her cheek. Slowly she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Buffy was still lying beside her but her head was now directly about Willow's looking down.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said softly almost in amazement. She couldn't believe that this was happening.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't respond, she merely brought their lips back together passionately. When Willow didn't pull away Buffy moved her lips over Willow's bottom lip and sucked on it gently, stroking across the smooth softness with her tongue. Willow exhaled against her lips then pressed her lips against Buffy's as she slid her hand across Buffy's back. The passion rose between them, both of them drawing in breath deeply as it scorched them, with seconds they were kissing deeply once again, hungrily. Mouths open and tongues tangling they dueled. Willow pressed into Buffy's strong body eyes closed trying to absorb every sensation coursing through her body through osmosis.</p>
<p>Finally, Willow wrenched her mouth away from Buffy's placing her hands on Buffy's shoulders to hold her back. She had to but a stop to what they were doing. Every fiber in Willow's being wanted to continue, wanted take Buffy and kiss every inch of her body. She wanted it so much it hurt, but she just couldn't let that happen. The timing, the circumstances were all wrong, and to continue would be wrong too. Buffy was in a state of vulnerability and she would NOT abuse that, she wouldn't abuse Buffy in that way. And then there was Oz. She couldn't do this to him.</p>
<p>Buffy tried to lean forward to kiss Willow again, but Willow kept up the resistance. She was actually surprised that she was able to keep her hands out, every part of her body was on fire. She had never experienced anything like that before in her life. She loved Oz, and when they were together it was amazing, but nothing that she had ever experienced with him had prepared her for what she and Buffy had just shared.</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow said, her voice cracking. Buffy looked down at her with a confused expression. Willow understood the feeling. What she was doing was in complete contradiction to every signal that her body was sending out.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow, and Buffy,&#34; Buffy said. &#34;Together,&#34; she continued trying to lean down once again. Once more Willow stopped her.</p>
<p>&#34;We can't,&#34; Willow said softly. It was a struggle for her to just get the words out of her mouth. Her heart constricted every time she spoke.</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow could just detect the forming of tears in the corner of Buffy's eyes. &#34;Bu…I,&#34; she continued correcting herself.  &#34;Love…you. I love you,&#34; she said looking down at Willow pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, god…Buffy,&#34; Willow said breaking their eye contact. They couldn't…they just couldn't. &#34;We can't.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy leaned back, then once she was settled she stared at Willow for a moment not saying a word. Then she closed her eyes and remained like that for a few moments. When she opened them again Willow could see tears.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy bad,&#34; she said not bothering to try speaking in the first person anymore. &#34;Willow hate Buffy,&#34; she continued starting to get off of the bed.</p>
<p>&#34;No!&#34; Willow said firmly reaching out this time to bring Buffy back. &#34;I don't hate you, I couldn't never hate you,&#34; she continued. &#34;I love you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then why?&#34; Buffy asked. Her gaze wasn't accusatory or angry, she was just struggling to understand something Willow wasn't sure she could explain to her. Wasn't sure she could explain to herself.</p>
<p>&#34;It's not the right time,&#34; Willow said looking into Buffy's eyes trying to convey what she was feeling. &#34;I love you, but we can't right now. It's just not the right time.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy lowered her head, thinking about what Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;But, sometime?&#34; she asked looking back up at the red-head.</p>
<p>Willow stared at her. She didn't know how to answer that really. There was so much she didn't know, and that question encompassed all of it. She didn't know if Buffy would remember anything that had happened between them when she returned to herself. She didn't know what was happening between her and Oz and anymore and what that meant, if it meant anything at all, to what was happening between her and Buffy. She couldn't possibly know if there would ever be a sometime, even if she wanted there to be.</p>
<p>&#34;Sometime,&#34; she finally responded. She hadn't thought about the answer or what it meant, but it was out there now. Buffy smiled and Willow smiled back. &#34;We should go to sleep,&#34; Willow said finally. The night really had worn her out. Besides she wasn't sure that she could handle anymore deep revelations, or contemplation's.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy stay here?&#34; Buffy asked even though it really was more of a statement.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded. Once the words were out of her mouth Buffy moved so that she was lying behind Willow and then she wrapped her arms around the red-heads waist drawing them together.</p>
<p>When Buffy pulled them together Willow became acutely aware of the curves and plains of Buffy's body pressed up against her own. She also was re-introduced to the warmth and suddenly wondered if the sleeping arrangements were such a good idea after all.</p>
