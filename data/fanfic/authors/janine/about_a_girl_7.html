<!-- About a Girl \ Part 7 -->

<p><u><i>A week later</i></u></p>

<p>Katie pressed herself against Jessie in a dark corner of the porch  and leaned down, brushing her lips against Jessie's softly, before  smiling and pressing her lips to Jessie's forehead affectionately.</p>

<p>"I should go," she sighed a moment later not needing to look at her  watch to know that it was late.  They had just gotten back from some  god awful movie that she couldn't even remember anymore - sometimes  she loved the damage MTV had done to her long term, hell her short  term memory - and she didn't quite want to separate from Jessie yet.   The movie had been fun; the backs of theatres were simply divine.</p>

<p>"Come inside," Jessie whispered soaking up the feeling the Katie's  body so close to hers.  "If you don't at least pop in to say hi,  they're going to question me incessantly about everything we did  tonight."</p>

<p>"That could be fun," Katie replied.  "But not for you," she amended  catching the look Jessie sent her.  "Alright then, let's go."</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie called out as they entered the living room.  Everyone,  but Zoë who was probably in bed, was gathered around the TV watching  a loud movie.  Upon the sound of her voice the others looked up, her  dad smiled, Eli barely blinked, Grace smirked and Lily asked how the  movie was.</p>

<p>"Stupid," was Jessie's response to Lily's question as she plunked  herself on the floor by her dad's feet not wanting to get on the  couch with him and Lily.  Some things were better left undisturbed.   Katie took a step forward and followed Jessie's led plopping herself  down onto the floor on the other side of Rick's legs.</p>

<p>"I like you're hair," Lily said by way of conversation fingering  Katie's follicles for a second before Katie looked over at her with a  smile thanking her and quoting some hair commercial.</p>

<p>"What movie?" Jessie asked after smiling stupidly at Katie's response  to Lily's caressing.</p>

<p>"Not sure," Rick responded.  "But you see that guy that's covered in  blood?  His hand just tried to kill him," he continued.  "Things are  only going to get worse for him now."</p>

<p>"Neat. Family entertainment," Katie whispered looking over at Jessie  across Rick's knees.  Jessie met her eyes and they grinned at each  other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Looks like you've got a fan club," Eli commented standing up as the  credits rolled and turning to face his dad.  Lily and Grace followed  his gaze looking over to Rick, who now had two sleeping girls using  his legs as pillows.</p>

<p>"Aw," Lily said her hand rising to her mouth, clearly finding the  display to cute for words.  Grace looked over at her mother and  rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Wakey, wakey," Rick said placing her hands on their shoulders and  shaking slightly, his legs were starting to go numb.  Gratuitous  blinking followed this, and quick shifting in an attempt to make it  seem like they weren't really sleeping at all, but they soon stopped  realizing that nobody was buying their act.</p>

<p>"I better go," Katie mumbled still half asleep as she stood up and  nearly fell back over, much to Jessie's amusement until she nearly  did the same thing.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Lily replied dismissively.  "Why don't you just call your  mom and tell her you're spending the night.  We'll drop by your house  in the morning and you can get your things for school."</p>

<p>"Then it's a sleepover," Jessie responded looking over at Katie who  shrugged.  Jessie smiled and turned her attention back to Lily who  was handing the phone to Katie accidentally catching a look at Grace,  who was glaring at her like she'd just kicked her cat or something.   Jessie sighed, what now?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's so unfair," Grace grumbled at Jessie as they stood outside the  bathroom door.  Jessie was waiting of Katie who was in there changing  into some clothes she'd given her, but Grace was apparently just  hanging around to bug the shit out of her.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked tiredly.</p>

<p>"She never would have let Spencer sleepover," Grace complained.  "In  MY BED," she continued.  Oh, someone's grapes were sour.  Jessie  merely shrugged at first, before then shooting Grace a smile that  left no doubt it was her who ate the canary.</p>

<p>"So?" Grace asked suggestively a moment later, leaning towards Jessie  as if they were sharing a top-secret message.</p>

<p>"So what?" Jessie asked tilting her head back surprised to find  Grace's face so close to her own.</p>

<p>"So have you …" Grace began.  "Are you going to…" she continued  looking at Jessie expectantly.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked her voice squeaking slightly, Grace's tone and  demeanor setting her on guard.</p>

<p>"You know," Grace said grinning, her eyebrows rising salaciously.</p>

<p>"No!"  Jessie responded jumping back slightly, clearly surprised and  a bit agitated by Grace's suggestion.  "And no," she continued  staring at Grace like she'd suddenly grown a second head.</p>

<p>Grace smiled, a low chuckle coming out of her throat as she watched  Jessie's eyes suddenly grow as wide as saucers as the reality of her  situation and what Grace was implying settled in with her.</p>

<p>"What's so funny?" Katie asked coming out of the washroom.  Seeing  Grace so clearly amused and Jessie ashen-faced and nearly shaking she  was almost afraid to find out.  "Are you okay?" she asked Jessie  reaching out to touch her shoulder, slightly surprised to feel Jessie  twitch underneath her hand.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Jessie responded but she seemed to still be shaking faintly  and Katie didn't believe a word that was coming out of her mouth.   She turned a questioning and accusing look at Grace but before she  could say anything Jessie had grabbed her hand and was dragging her  up the attic, yelling `night' to Grace.</p>

<hr>

<p>Katie finally let her eyes drift open of sighed.  This was  ridiculous.  She was actually tired but there was absolutely no way  she was going to be able to go to sleep like this.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should sleep on the floor," she commented into the darkness  knowing that Jessie was still awake.  Almost as soon as they entered  the room they became hyper aware of each other, and once they got on  the bed, every breath the other took was like as loud as thunder.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie exclaimed, "why?" she continued still clutching at her  blanket.</p>

<p>"If you were any stiffer I think you'd have to be legally declared  dead," Katie replied with a sigh, noting that Jessie hadn't moved,  except for taking an occasional breath, for like fifteen  minutes.  "Besides, I'm gonna cramp up if I keep trying not to move."</p>

<p>"You can move," Jessie replied glancing over at her.</p>

<p>"Physically yes, I am capable of it," Katie responded meeting  Jessie's eyes before turning her gaze away again.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should sleep over the floor," Katie said again reaching for  the edge of the blanket.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie replied reaching over and slapping her hand away.</p>

<p>"You're obviously not going to be able to fall asleep with me beside  you," Katie responded trying to use reason to get her way.  The fact  that Jessie was pressed up against her back not making accessing her  reasoning center the easiest thing for her.</p>

<p>"I'm not the only one that's awake," Jessie pointed out slowly  removing herself from Katie's back and lying back down.</p>

<p>"Touché," Katie conceded with a sigh.  "It's just…I don't wanna do  anything."</p>

<p>"I wasn't saying that we should," Jessie replied a touch to quickly,  her conversation with Grace making her a bit jumpy about the  subject.  The thought of them doing stuff hadn't even entered her  mind when Lily suggested that Katie sleep over, but after Grace had  started talking about it, she had started thinking about, and now she  couldn't stop clutching her blanket.</p>

<p>"No, I mean like by accident," Katie responded sighing again,  choosing to ignore how quickly Jessie confirmed that she didn't want  to do anything.  "When I'm asleep I don't… I mean I sometimes, I have  dreams … as people are known to from time to time," she continued  shifting uncomfortably.  "Sometimes you're in them," she went on her  eyes plastered on the ceiling.  "And, sometimes I toss and turn," she  explained trying to keep her breathing even.  "I just don't want to  end up dreaming and toss and turn on you," she finished closing her  eyes with a dejected exhalation.  Well that was thoroughly mortifying.</p>

<p>"Oh," Jessie breathed out, trying not to think about how pleased she  was to hear that Katie dreamed about her sometimes.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  So I'll just…" Katie began trying to move again.</p>

<p>"You're not sleeping on the floor," Jessie said reaching out to stop  her again.  "I forbid it."</p>

<p>"But…" Katie started again, not quite able to her whine inaudible,  once again incredibly aware of the heat emanating from Jessie's body  as she leaned over her trying to stop her from moving</p>

<p>"I'll take the chance," Jessie replied softly.  "Besides," she  continued.  "If you did toss and turn, and ended up somewhere near  the vicinity of me … it'd hardly be the worse thing that could  happen," she continued, trying not to let on how much the idea of  sleeping in Katie's arms actually appealed to her.  It wasn't like  she wanted to do stuff, yet, but the lying together part didn't seem  so bad, in fact it seemed kind of perfect in theory.</p>

<p>"Really?"  Katie asked, trying not to let on how pleased she was by  the idea that Jessie wasn't totally opposed to the concept of long  term snuggling, show in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded simply.</p>

<p>"Alright, I'll stay," Katie acquiesced, sighing grandly.</p>

<p>"I'll know if you're actually asleep," Jessie added, once she felt  Katie shift and settle down again.</p>

<p>Katie laughed softly in response.  Then deciding to just go with the  flow asked, "would it really make a difference?"</p>

<p>"Probably not," Jessie admitted softly, and then she flipped around  with her back to Katie drawing the blanket around her before  muttering `goodnight'.</p>

<p>"Night," Katie replied a smile spreading across her face.  It was a  night that couldn't help but be good.</p>
