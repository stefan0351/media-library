<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 14 -->

<p><b>2004 - March</b></p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie said smiling into thin air as she
leaned back against the headboard of her bed at Northwestern.</p>

<p>"Oh god," her roommate declared dramatically,
motioning to the three other people who were lounging in her room. "It's the
girlfriend," she continued forebodingly, knowing who inevitably had to be on the
other end of the phone when Jessie said 'hey' like that and smiled like that.</p>

<p>"Later."</p>

<p>"Out."</p>

<p>"Call me."</p>

<p>The three others said upon hearing this, following
Jessie's roommate Kristy out of the room.</p>

<p>"I hate each and every one of you with a fiery
passion," Jessie called after them. Her behavior whenever Katie happened to be
mentioned was a running joke on the floor.</p>

<p>"Everyone run away again?" Katie asked smiling at
Jessie's outburst.</p>

<p>"Yes," Jessie replied crankily.
"Bastards."</p>

<p>"You know you love them," Katie said laughing.</p>

<p>"This is a surprise," Jessie continued
Katie's laugh drawing her thoughts away from her dumbass friends. "I wasn't
expecting to hear from you for another couple days."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie said her tone more somber now that
Jessie had brought them around to the real reason for her call. "You know that
professor I told you about? The art one with Sideshow Bob hair?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Know of him, yeah," Jessie said remembering
Katie's references to him.</p>

<p>"Well, I finally got around to showing him some of my
stuff two weeks ago," Katie replied. "He didn't say much at the time,"
she continued slowly, "but it turned out that he liked what he saw."</p>

<p>"Of course he did," Jessie responded smiling
proudly. "You're brilliant."</p>

<p>"Humph," Katie exhaled softly, "not quite.
But he does think I show promise," she continued feeling her heart start to beat
faster in chest as she approached the point of no return. "A couple days ago, he ah
stopped me after class," she went on taking a deep breath. "He ... he said he
knows these people, and after seeing my paintings he talked to them."</p>

<p>"People?" Jessie asked a feeling of trepidation
beginning to creep into her though she didn't know why. "Art people?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded. "Every summer
there's this apprenticeship program in Palermo, Italy, where each of the students
that takes part gets a show to present the work they've done before hand, and then
for the rest of the summer they work with the professional artists and come back a year
later for another show," she said softly. "It's an amazing
opportunity."</p>

<p>Jessie was quiet for a moment as the implications of
Katie's statement began to sink in with her.</p>

<p>"Are you asking me, or telling me?" she asked
finally, her voice revealing nothing.</p>

<p>"Telling you," Katie replied softly, after a
moment of silence. "I'm going."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," Jessie said closing
her eyes. She didn't see how Katie could not go, this program, it was what she always
wanted, it was a chance for her to breakthrough. At nineteen. It would have been insanity
for her not to accept the offer.</p>

<p>"Do you not want me to go?" Katie asked, not sure
what she had expected to hear from Jessie, just knowing that this wasn't it.</p>

<p>"I do," Jessie said softly, almost inaudibly.
"I want you to be happy," she continued in an equally soft tone. "I want
you to be able to do what you love."</p>

<p>"Then why did that sound like a eulogy?" Katie
asked her voice almost as soft as Jessie's.</p>

<p>Jessie was quiet for a moment following Katie's
question, one of her hands rubbing her eyes trying to hold back the tears stinging her
eyes as the other hand held the phone. Two years, if Katie joined this program it would
mean that they wouldn't see each other for any significant amount of time for two
years. Seven hundred and twenty eight days, probably more.</p>

<p>"I can't do this anymore," Jessie said
softly, her heart constricting painfully as the words left her lips. "I can't
take being with you and never seeing you. It's like a part of me is always missing
whenever you're not around," she continued the words coming to her unbidden now
and rushing out of her mouth. "I feel like a shadow, like an empty box. I ...
Katie..." she went on her voice trailing off as she got lost in thought, in
feeling.</p>

<p>"You're..." Katie said quietly almost
hollowly. "You're breaking up with me?" she asked her voice, small and
exposed.</p>

<p>"It's not that simple," Jessie said
beseechingly.</p>

<p>"What's not so simple?" Katie asked her
voice filled with hurt. "You don't want to be with me anymore. What's not
so simple about that?"</p>

<p>"I want to be with you," Jessie stated firmly.
"I always want to be with you. I just never am," she continued her voice
raising. "We're never together, and wanting you every moment of every day, and
never having you with me is killing me. It's..."</p>

<p>"What? You think that it's easy for me? Being
away from you all the time? Do you think that it's fun for me hear your voice and
want nothing more than to be able to hold your hand but know that I can't because
you're a billon fucking miles away?" Katie interjected, hot tears streaming down
her face. She couldn't believe this was happening. "What am I supposed to do
Jessie? Tell me what I'm suppose to do! My parents made me come here, but now that I
am here I can't not go. I mean, do you have any idea how rare an opportunity this
is?"</p>

<p>"No," Jessie said softly. "But I can
imagine. And that's the problem exactly. I can't tell you what to do, because
there's nothing that you can do. Or I can do. Or anyone can do," she continued
shaking her head. "Everything is pushing us apart, and we've been clinging
together until our fingers bled, but I can't do it anymore. It hurts," she went
on her voice cracking as the tears escaped her eyes and streamed down her face.
"Being with you hurts."</p>

<p>"I'll tell them no," Katie said, delirious
at the idea that she and Jessie could actually be breaking up. "I'll come back
for the summer."</p>

<p>"You can't," Jessie said sniffing and
rubbing at her eyes. "My god, I couldn't ask you to," she continued
thinking about the amazing opportunity Katie was being offered. "I wouldn't let
you," she went on knowing without a doubt that if Katie tried anything so idiotic
she'd hog tie her and send her back to Europe express mail.</p>

<p>"I don't want to lose you," Katie replied
her voice hoarse as she struggled to control her tears.</p>

<p>"You already have," Jessie responded softly, her
voice hollow as she stared at the ceiling unthinkingly. "You have to go, and I have
to let you," she continued squeezing her eyes shut tightly as she struggled to hold
on to the thin grasp she had on her emotions. "Go to Italy, paint ... live,"
she finished, the last word coming out choked.</p>

<p>"I never," Katie started her voice sounding as
strained as Jessie's. "I didn't ... this is..."</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie responded beginning to lose the
rest of her control.</p>

<p>"Billie," Katie whispered into the receiver
softly.</p>

<p>"Don't," Jessie said screwing her eyes shut
tightly, clamping down the urge to just break down that moment.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Katie said again, not having any idea
what she would afterwards but not able to let the other girl go just yet.</p>

<p>"Don't," Jessie repeated again.
"Please, I couldn't stand it."</p>

<p>"Can I see you?" Katie asked desperately,
clutching onto the phone like a lifeline.</p>

<p>"When?" Jessie asked laughing darkly. "I
mean that's the whole point isn't it?" she continued her voice somber once
more.</p>

<p>"I guess it is," Katie agreed. "Yeah."</p>
