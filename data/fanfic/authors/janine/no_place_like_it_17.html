<p>Katie shook her head smiling as she turned her head to look
out of the window, biting down on her bottom lip to stop from full out laughing.</p>

<p>"What?" Grace asked peevishly as she came to a
stop at a red light, turning around to give Katie the full force of her glare.</p>

<p>"It's just..." Katie started remembering
Jessie's 'hey, hey Kool-Aid' story and wondering if it would be wise to
continue.</p>

<p>"It's just what?" Grace asked having a good
idea what was coming.</p>

<p>"You are extremely pregnant," Katie said with a
touch of wonder in her voice looking over a Grace, her eyes focusing on her stomach. There
was life in there, tiny human life that would one day grow up to play soccer and dent its
parent's car.</p>

<p>"Just know," Grace started sighing, "that
when it's your turn I'm going to gawk and mock you viciously, because fair is
fair," she continued smiling a bit nonetheless. It still amazed her that there was an
actual life growing inside of her, so she couldn't really fault other people for
being in awe as well.</p>

<p>"I have a low threshold for pain," Katie replied
glancing up at Grace as they started to move again. "Jessie's gonna to have to
have the babies."</p>

<p>"Does Jessie know this?" Grace asked arching an
eyebrow. The truth was she was kind of surprised by the comment, she hadn't figured
that the two of them had gotten to a point again where they would be comfortable talking
about who'd have the baby.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Katie responded laughing softly.
"It'll be our little secret for now, okay?" she continued winking at Grace.
"So where are we going anyway? Are you going to badger me indoors? Over coffee? As we
casually stroll through a boutique?"</p>

<p>"Badger you?" Grace asked innocently though that
was exactly what she had been planning on doing since she had gotten over seeing Katie
naked.</p>

<p>"That's why we're on the this quaint little
road trip isn't it?" Katie asked her tone serious, though her words remained
light and breezy. "You want to find out what my intentions towards Jessie are."</p>

<p>"You know I always liked that about you," Grace
said, her gaze flickering to her rearview mirror before she focused in front of her again.
"The word coy has absolutely no meaning for you," she continued.
"You're right of course."</p>

<p>"Of course," Katie replied her gaze flickering
back over to Grace. "So?"</p>

<p>"So what are you intentions towards my dear, sweet,
stepsister?" Grace asked. The truth was she'd always liked Katie, even though
she'd always been a bit chatty for Graces tastes she was and had always been a kind
person. The truth was she still liked Katie, but she also remembered what Jessie had been
like after they broke up, she remembered Jessie's eyes always looking like they were
on the verge of breaking out into tears and she liked Katie a little less every time she
remembered. Jessie had never really gone into detail about why they had broken up, other
than saying that it had been too difficult to stay together over such a long distance, but
a part of her had always blamed Katie. Jessie had told her that she shouldn't, had
told all of them not to, but Jessie was family and whether it was reasonable or not you
always sided with family. So Katie, whom they had all loved and taken into their hearts
when she and Jessie were together, became somewhat vilified over the years, the dastardly
breaker of Jessie's heart. And, even though she was trying to be impartial, Grace
still carried a little bit of that around with her.</p>

<p>"Forever," Katie replied, her eyes still focused
forward.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Grace asked her eyes flickering
towards Katie briefly, their expression questioning.</p>

<p>"Forever," Katie repeated. "I'm going
to be completely honest with you, because I think you'd know if I wasn't and
would kick my ass for it," she went on smirking. "I love Jessie. I always have,
even when we weren't together I still loved her more than I've ever loved
anything in life. And back in the day, we fucked things up, I fucked things up ...
whatever, things got fucked and we both got screwed," she continued noting Grace roll
her eyes and smiling at the action. "I can't change what happened back then, all
I can do is concentrate on the future, and tell you that I want that future to be with
Jessie. So my intentions, my intensions Grace are this. To make her smile, to make her so
happy that when I propose in what promises to be an idiotic fashion she'll overlook
it and say yes anyway. To have babies with her, to buy that ranch she wants somewhere in
the middle of nowhere, and to learn to like horses. To have a porch with a swing, and to
grow old sitting out there looking at the stars with her in my arms. Those are my
intentions," she finished, blinking back tears, but smiling softly as she turned her
head to look out the passenger side window.</p>

<p>"Wow," Grace exclaimed looking over at Katie once
more. "I kind of want to marry you now."</p>

<p>Katie looked back over at her, and they held each other
gaze momentarily before Grace turned her head forward once again and they both laughed
softly.</p>

<p>"On a more serious note," Grace continued a
moment later, "I like those intentions, I really do. But, if you break her heart, I
promise you that I will hunt you down like a rabid dog and make you pay."</p>

<p>"Hmmm, a vague stipulation is nobodies friend I
suppose," Katie muttered in response. "Noted," she continued. "But I
promise you, you'll never have to know the horrors of plaid."</p>
