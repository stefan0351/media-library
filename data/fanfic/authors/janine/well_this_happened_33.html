<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 32: "Sam and Brooke's No Good, Very Bad Day" -->

<p>Sam sighed and adjusted her bag, she could feel her heart rate increasing
and knew that her palms were sweating, she could feel them all watching her.
  Dozens of pairs of eyes trained on her, thinking she didn't know what.  It
was like the walls themselves were watching her.  Tilting her head to the
side her gaze caught Jason Burgess's roving eyes.  Almost immediately a
dirty smile appeared on his face and he licked his lips and winked at her.
Sam immediately turned away and continued down the hall, a completely
disgusted frown marring her features.    She was still freaked and now she
felt like she needed a shower.  This was just the perfect day!  She sighed
to herself, things were getting ridiculous, it was ten times as bad as it
had been the day before, now people weren't even pretending like they
weren't talking about her, they would openly point!  She sighed again, that
was just rude.  She wondered if Brooke was getting the same thing.</p>

<p>As she entered the cafeteria there was once again a wave of people that
turned to look and look and look at her.  Catching Brooke's eyes she saw a
bewildered expression that matched her own.  Sam quickly made her way over
to where her friends were sitting and sat down, resting her arm on the table
obscuring the side of her face from any watchers.  Once safely tucked away
she noticed that Harrison was sitting with them, it was the first time since
she had told him about her and Brooke.  Of course they had talked the day
after her date with Brooke, and he had apologized for his behavior and said
that things would change, however this was the first time she had actually
noticed the change he promised.  For the first time that day Sam's mood
approached something resembling happiness.  Maybe everything would be all
right.</p>

<p>"Please tell me that you all noticed those children of the corn stares," Sam
said looking at each of them beseechingly.  In response the three other
people at the table exchanged conspirital looks with each other and shifted
in their chairs uncomfortably.  Sam got a sinking feeling upon witnessing
this.  "What's going on?" she asked somewhat apprehensively.</p>

<p>"You seriously haven't heard?" Harrison asked somewhat dubiously.  Sam was
usually on top of these things.  He was hoping that she had heard because he
didn't want to be the one to break it to her.  Honestly he wasn't sure, if
push came to shove, that he could break it to her.  Hell, he didn't even
want to break it to himself!</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded in a distressed tone.  He wasn't meeting her eyes.  This
was a bad sign.  Whatever was going on was big, it was big and it was about
her and she didn't even know what it was, she thought to herself working
herself into a big 'ol panic.  "I can't hear anything because when I
approach people cease with the talking."</p>

<p>The three of them exchanged another set of looks.</p>

<p>"Everyone's talking about you," Carm finally said, her voice only a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I figured that much out on my own," Sam responded somewhat bitchily.
Having the entire population of the school ogling her for days on end had
really started to fry her nerves.  "What are they talking about?"</p>

<p>"When I said you, I didn't mean you singularly, more like you as in you and
Brooke, you," Carmen replied in a rush, refusing to meet Sam's gaze.  "The
general consensus is that you two are doing the horizontal mamba … and that
lots of people wouldn't mind watching particular dance."</p>

<p>Sam stared at Carm for a minute, the only motion in her body being her chest
rising and falling at regular intervals.  She continued to stare like this
for quite some time before emitting a sound from the back of her throat that
could only be described as the most pitiful whimper ever in creation before
she dropped her head to the table and began whimpering some more.</p>

<p>"Look at the bright side, at least you won't be sent to an all girls school
… or boot-camp," Lily commented.  She immediately received a slap on the
shoulder from Carmen and the stink-eye from Harrison.  Sam merely moaned
again and trashed her head about.  This was officially a no good, very bad
day.</p>

<p>Brooke observed everyone at the table dubiously, but she paid special
attention to Mary Cherry.  They were all acting bizarrely, but Brooke was
finding Mary Cherry's repeated inquires as to whether or not she wanted to
squeeze her ripe, juicy melons particularly off-putting.  Sugar Daddy was an
interesting shade of red and despite her repeated attempts he didn't seem to
be able to look her in the eye.  Besides that Josh was shifting and shimming
in his chair like someone had poured itching powder down his pants, Popita
was wearing plaid for some reason, and there was a general feeling of
tension at the table.  She got the distinct impression that there was a
secret everyone was in on but her.</p>

<p>"Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on here?" Brooke
requested.  Immediately Mary Cherry raised her hand in the air and began to
bounce in her seat.  Seeing that the southerner was the only volunteer -
which made her worry even more - Brooke told her to go ahead.</p>

<p>Once Brooke had given her the okay, Mary Cherry took a moment to compose
herself then launched into her oratory with an amazing verve.  "It is nah
commin knowledge," she started dramatically,  "that you Brooke McQueen,
home-coming queen and mah personal model for all that it means to be blonde
and beautiful - next ta the goddess Gywneth of course - have," she paused
here with positively theatrical timing,  "tasted of the forbidden fruit,"
she intoned gravely, before breaking out into a wide grin.  "That is ta say
that like the great Tallulah Bankhead, you have vigorously embraced the love
that dare not speak its name."  She then leaned back in her chair proudly
and folded her arms.</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, then she turned to face Nicole.  "So they
know about Sam?" she asked her friend.  The shorthaired blonde simply
nodded.  Brooke nodded back at her then said, "Well, in that case there's
only one thing to do."</p>

<p>Upon hearing this Nicole's face immediately brightened.  This was going to
be very interesting, when Brooke got her bitch on, she could go with the
best of them.  Nicole had known that the school wide discovery of her
relationship with Spam had been on Brooke's mind since she had confronted
Nicole in the Novak weeks ago, however Nicole didn't know was how the Brooke
planned on dealing with the inevitable spread of the information.  After
their heartrending meeting it had became clear to Nicole that Brooke had had
a change of heart regarding how she viewed her own relationship, now Nicole
was just intensely curious to see how this newfound pride played itself out
in a more public arena.  It other words she was waiting on eggshells to see
if Brooke was going to be all, 'we're here, we're queer', or if she was
going to employ the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy.  Only time would tell,
and that time was upon them.</p>

<p>Brooke allowed her gaze to float around the cafeteria for a moment, taking
in all of the looks that were still being sent her way.  She bit her bottom
lip and let out a soft sigh.  Catching the eye of a girl at a table off to
her right Brooke stood up.  She had had enough of this; it was time to end
things one way or another.  This was war, and in war there were always
causalities.  This girl, this unfortunate soul, was to be the first.  To bad
so sad, c'est la vie.</p>

<p>"You.  Capri pants and fuchsia scarf," she said addressing the girl.  "First
of all, no," she said looking at the outfit and making a face and shaking
her finger chastisingly.  "Secondly, and this is the important part so pay
attention now…what are you looking at?"  Capri pants and fuchsia scarf
merely blinked at Brooke in a stunned silence.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"What's going on?" Carm asked looking over at Brooke who seemed to be
harassing Kristen Sheridan.  Carm didn't think that the outfit worked
particularly well either, but that was no reason to single her out.</p>

<p>"I sense a kaboom," Sam stated pushing her chair back.  "A big kaboom," she
added returning her full attention to the scene being played out in front of
them.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When Capri pants and fuchsia scarf neglected to reply Brooke turned her
attention to a girl off to her left who she had noticed looking at her
earlier.  "Any you.  Pleather and not quite DKNY," Brooke continued
addressing the girl with a raised eyebrow that was both  questioning and
disapproving.  "Care to share what's so interesting?"  Pleather and not
quite DKNY apparently did not care to share because she simply gaped at
Brooke like a hungry fish.  Brooke sighed this was getting her nowhere.
These people were suppose to respond to her, not just sit there like they
had the IQ of a box of hair.  She was going to have to be more direct.</p>

<p>Turning away from the gaping figure in front of her Brooke looked over to
the side towards where Sam was.  She spotted the brunette right away as she
was now standing up watching Brooke with a curious expression.  Brooke
stared at her for a second, then began to walk over to her.  She could see
Sam, and feel the whole cafeteria, watching her every move and it felt like
hours before she actually made it over to the brunette.  When she reached
Sam, she stopped just in front of her and greeted her with a small lopsided
smile.  Sam gave her a nervous smile back, and it was all Brooke could do
not to erupt into a full fledged smile.  Sam was so cute sometimes.</p>

<p>"Journey's end," Brooke whispered stepping so close to Sam that there was
hardly any space between them.</p>

<p>"And lovers meet," Sam whispered back in a barely audible voice still
watching Brooke intensely.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I'm going to do?"  Brooke asked stopping in that intimate
position, still watching Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam breathed out in a tone just as quite as Brooke's.  As she spoke
her lips twitched slightly, and Brooke knew that she was trying to contain a
smirk.  That was what she wanted to hear, what she wanted to see.  They had
to be in this together.  Then without further comment Brooke, in one grand
sweeping motion, brought her hand up to Sam's face and leaned in bringing
their lips together, in a brief but thorough kiss.</p>

<p>Up until their lips meet they had both been painfully aware of the eyes on
them, but afterwards, though they could both feel everyone gaping at them,
it wasn't quite as painful anymore, like a distant hum, an abstract
annoyance.  Brooke had kissed Sam in front of the entire cafeteria, Sam had
let her, and now there it was.</p>

<p>Separating herself from Sam, Brooke turned to survey the stupefied crowd
once more.  Silence greeted her and she knew that she was still ringmaster,
at least for the moment.  This was good.  If anyone had been up to
responding to her she didn't think she'd be able to handle it at the moment,
because despite her composed appearance she was a nervous wreck.</p>

<p>"Are you happy now?" she asked addressing anyone and everyone.  "Is that
what you wanted to see?" she continued, her voice a little tired.  She
should have been an actress.  "Can we all go back to lunch now or is there
something else I can do for you?  Anybody need a kidney?  A liver?  A stick
of juicy fruit maybe?" She paused there waiting to see if anyone would
indeed say something.  She didn't think anyone would and she was right.
"No?  Good," she stated.  "Carry on, carry on," she continued waving her
hand dismissively at them and turning back around to face Sam.</p>

<p>With that she whispered "Just sit back down, and don't look at any of them.
It'll be alright," then she herself turned around and headed back to her
table not taking her eyes off of Nicole's smirking face until she reached it
and sat down.  There she slumped imperceptivity and her hands shook faintly,
but nobody was watching her anymore.  Brooke then surveyed the table, taking
in their surprised (Josh, Sugar Daddy and Popita) and amused (Nicole and
Mary Cherry) expressions.  Her face fell, oh god what had she done?</p>

<p>As Sam sat back down, a mildly dazed look covering her features, Carm leaned
over and whispered, "that was excellent," to which Sam smiled, then started
to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, the same nervous, relieved,
terrified, amused laugh.  There is was, they all realized.  Spread out like
a two dollar buffet for everyone's consumption.  Eat up, eat up, it's on us,
Sam thought to herself,  pausing a split second after the thought ran
through her head.  When she fully realized the implications of what they had
just done she stopped, everything.  She was no longer laughing.  Oh god, she
thought, what have we done???</p>
