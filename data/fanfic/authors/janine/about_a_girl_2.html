<!-- About a Girl \ Part 2 -->

<p><u><i>Karen's House</i></u></p>

<p>"Oh my god," Katie exclaimed flinging herself on Jessie's bed as  Jessie closed the door to her room.  "I thought you were joking about  the packing and dusting and stuff!  I haven't worked that hard since  dad made us help build crazy uncle Cory's cottage slash whacked out  bomb shelter!"</p>

<p>"Bomb shelter?" Jessie asked raising an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"That's why we call him `crazy' uncle Cory," Katie responded flipping  around onto her back so that she could see Jessie.  "He once ate  nothing but baked beans for like eight months.  He wasn't allowed to  come over for holiday dinners during that period," she continued  sitting up as Jessie walked over to the bed.</p>

<p>"That's a lovely story," Jessie said making a face coming to stop  just in front of Katie.  "I'm surprised that it isn't told every  Christmas with people gathered around the fireplace holding hands and  stuff."</p>

<p>"Mock him if you will," Katie responded with a pseudo  sigh.  "Really.  Everyone else does," she continued grinning up at  Jessie cheekily, her smile slowly fading away to be replaced by  questioning head tilt as she realized just how close to her Jessie  was standing.  "Hey," she continued a moment later, swallowing  heavily as her eyes traveled up Jessie's torso, settling on her lips  for a moment before moving up further to her eyes, which were  watching her closely.</p>

<p>"I want…" Jessie began slowly, clearly annunciating every syllable.</p>

<p>"I know," Katie responded holding her gaze.  "It's okay," she  continued.  "It's always okay."</p>

<p>And before she could say anything else, she felt Jessie's lips on  hers, brushing against her own gently, then with an increasing  firmness as she got swept up in the tide, pulling away only when the  need for oxygen became too great to ignore.</p>

<p>"It's different when I'm taller than you," Jessie commented softly as  she looked down at Katie's seated figure.  A wickedly delicious smile  creeping across her features as the euphoria hit her.  "I like being  tall."</p>

<p>"Certainly it has its advantages," Katie responded hers lips turning  upwards at well, her reply both teasing and relieved.  "But there's  something to be said for the view from Midget Town too."</p>

<p>"Midget Town?" Jessie asked, her eyes narrowing menacingly.  So she  was going to start with the short jokes was she?  Not a good move.</p>

<p>"Is Dopey coming by today, he's got my copy of `It's a small world  after all'," Katie answered immediately, her smile growing wider at  Jessie's expression.  God, she was so cute, like when she did  anything.  All Jessie had to do was make an expression and it was  like the best thing she'd ever seen.</p>

<p>"You are in *so* much trouble," Jessie ground out staring a Katie for  a moment, before laughing as she flung herself at Katie, causing the  other girl to fall back against the bed, as Jessie landed on top of  her, rolling them over, causing her laugh even harder as Katie began  to tickle her.</p>

<hr>

<p>"What are you doing?" Jessie asked looking down as Katie picked up  her hand in hers.  They were sitting across from each other cross- legged on the floor.  At first they had been talking, about stupid  things, about anything, but then they'd just kind of stopped and  started looking at each other.  For a long time.  Then Katie had  reached out her hand and picked up Jessie's.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Katie responded as she cradled Jessie's hand in her  left one, and then began tracing the lines of Jessie's hand with one  of the fingers of her right hand slowly.  "Wait," Katie continued a  moment later.  "I know now."</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked, her breath coming out surprisingly short.  She  had stopped concentrating for a moment, and now it seemed as if she'd  forgotten how to breathe.</p>

<p>"Learning," Katie said softly, her head tilting up momentarily to  gaze at Jessie.  "You're hands are so soft…delicate," she whispered  softly, almost as if she were in a trance.  "Beautiful," she  continued her eyes dropping back down to Jessie's palm.  "Like you."</p>

<p>"You…you think I'm beautiful?" Jessie asked a moment later, her voice  halting with uncertainty as her eyes dropped down to their joined  hands.</p>

<p>"No," Katie responded gazing over at her without a moment's  hesitation.  Jessie looked up at her questioningly, confused, but  Katie continued going before she could say anything.  "I know it.   I'm pretty sure that it's written in stone somewhere," she continued  seriously.  "Like Gospel.  You're name is in italics."</p>

<p>Jessie was quiet for a second, then half exhaled, half laughed,  bowing her head down self-consciously as Katie's words washed over  her like cool fresh water over pebbles on a summer day.  It made her  feel tingly inside, like when they kissed; only it was different at  the same time.  Her mother had told her that she was beautiful  before, her dad too.  Even Eli had acquiesced that she'd `probably be  a looker' when she grew up.  But it had never really fazed her, when  she heard it with them, it had just rolled off of the surface and she  had never truly believed it.  But coming from Katie, it was  different; it began to sink into her.  And she believed it for  second, even if it was only in Katie's eyes.</p>

<p>"Hey, are you okay?" Katie asked concern filling her voice as she  looked at Jessie's still bowed head.  "I didn't mean to embarrass  you," she continued ducking her head down to try and get a better  look at Jessie's face.  "Sometimes I just talk to much.  I won't be  planning on saying anything, and then words just come tumbling out of  my mouth, and I suddenly wish that my mom would actually buy that  muzzle she's always threatening me with."</p>

<p>"You don't talk to much," Jessie said softly finally looking up, her  eyes still shimmering as she gazed at Katie.  "I mean, I like  listening to you talk," she said smirking at her own lameness.</p>

<p>"That works out well then, I think," Katie responded smiling self- depreciatingly seeming not to mind her lameness if there had been  any.  "You know, I meant it.  But I won't say it again if it makes  you uncomfortable," she continued, her finger still unconsciously  stroking Jessie's hand.</p>

<p>"It's not that, it's just…" Jessie started; momentarily distracted by  the feeling Katie's finger was producing in her hand, which then  promptly shot through the rest of her body like electricity.  "I  just, you know never heard that from anyone who's not related to me,"  she continued a moment later, her head dropping down once more.</p>

<p>"Not even from Tad?" Katie asked, a small smile etching it's way  across her features.</p>

<p>Jessie looked up at her then contemplatively.  Tad had told her  something like that.  And she had gotten it from strangers too she  supposed, she just hadn't believed them.  She hadn't believed anyone  who had told her before Katie, not even a little bit.  She still  wasn't sure, not really, she only knew that she believed Katie meant  it, and that was enough for her.</p>

<p>"I guess it just didn't mean anything coming from him," she said  softly, her brows drawing together thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"But it does…from me?" Katie asked studying Jessie's face.</p>

<p>Jessie merely nodded, and then turned her eyes up to look into  Katie's smiling face.</p>

<p>"We were going to …" Karen began opening Jessie's bedroom, pausing  momentarily as she got her first good look inside.  There were just  sitting on the floor, Katie giving Jessie what looked like a palm  reading while grinning at each other, but she felt like she was  interrupting something the moment she opened the door and couldn't  quite explain why.  "Order a pizza, when I realized that I didn't  know what Katie likes," she continued as Jessie scrambled to her  feet, walking over to the door to help steady her.  Eli had carried  her up the stairs, and she'd be fine with the walker for the next few  minutes, but Jessie always worried.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about me," Katie said getting to her feet as well,  rubbing her hands together uncertainly.  "Whatever's fine."  Man, she  thought to herself, did like every parent in the world have the  absolute worst timing ever?  Was there like a course that they got to  take or something?</p>

<p>Karen smiled at her before looking back over at Jessie.  "Pepperoni  and cheese it is," she said then, turning her head slightly as Eli's  voice wafted down to her from further down the hall.  "Yeah, yeah,  you'll get yours," she muttered under her breath, but loud enough for  Jessie to hear as she was standing beside her.</p>

<p>"I thought we were all suppose to behave," Jessie murmured as she  helped her mother maneuver out the door.</p>

<p>"You've got your father's sense of humor," Karen responded shaking  her head, causing Jessie to laugh a little.</p>

<p>"I think dad's funny," she responded as Karen started down the  hallway to her room.</p>

<p>"You would," she heard faintly followed by the soft sounds of  laughter, before she lost sight of her mother as she entered her room.</p>

<p>"I think he's funny," Jessie said again turning around to face Katie,  feeling somewhat unsteady - in a good way - now that she wasn't  holding her mother anymore and therefore able to use her as a  distraction from the emotions that had been coursing through her  before the interruption.</p>

<p>"I think you're funny," Katie offered conciliatorily before flopping  back down on her bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm highly amusing," Jessie, agreed walking over to sit on the  bed beside Katie.</p>

<p>"And beautiful," Katie added.</p>

<p>"Well, that goes without saying," Jessie responded seriously looking  over at Katie, who watched her for a moment before they both broke  out laughing, falling back down on the bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Jessie carefully opened the door to Karen's bedroom, scrunching up  her face with intensity as she tried to make a sound.  Then, having  successfully opened the door she crept inside carefully closing it  behind her before walking over to her mother's bed as stealthily as  humanly possible.  She was like a cat, she was sure of it.</p>

<p>"Hello," Karen said into the dark, having sensed her daughter as soon  as she opened the door.</p>

<p>"AH!" Jessie yelled jumping back a bit.  "How…" she began, starting  to replay her entrance in her head and knowing with absolute  certainty that she hadn't made a sound.</p>

<p>"A mother always knows," Karen responded cryptically looking in the  direction of Jessie's voice.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that a TV show back in the day," Jessie asked lifting up the  edge of the blanket and slipping into the bed, plastering herself to  her mother's side and resting her head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"That was `Father Knows Best'," Karen responded with a touch of  amusement before kissing Jessie on the top of her head.</p>

<p>"Ah," Jessie said softly, almost knowledgably, before asking, "I  wasn't alive then was I?"</p>

<p>"No," Karen responded laughing softly.  "I only saw reruns."</p>

<p>"Must have been a long time ago," Jessie mumbled her response, her  fingers running along the hard outer shell of the cast on her mothers  arm.</p>

<p>"I suppose it would seem like that to you," Karen replied looking  down at the top of Jessie's head.  "Are you settling down?" she asked  a moment later feeling her daughter's breaths coming less and less  frequently.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Jessie replied, not seeming notoriously concerned.</p>

<p>"So I guess you figured out what you wanted then," Karen commented  taking in Jessie's relaxed bearing.  It wasn't often that she saw her  like that, totally calm.  She realized that she herself had a  tendency to worry, and fret over things, and to her chagrin she had  noticed the same tendency in Jessie.  It caused them both to rather  high strung most of the time, so it was rare and very pleasant to see  Jessie this way, and feel similarly herself.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked looking up at her mother even though she could  barely make out her features in the dark.  Had she fallen asleep or  something?</p>

<p>"What we were talking about the other day at the hospital," Karen  answered, feeling Jessie's head drop back down onto her shoulder a  moment later.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie replied, fully awake again.  "Kind of," she continued  not really sure that she wanted to talk about at the moment, or ever.</p>

<p>"What did you decide?" Karen asked bringing her hand up to brush some  hair off of Jessie's face, but then stopping.  She actually like how  it looked, it was as if Jessie had her own personal halo or something.</p>

<p>Her question was followed by a deep sigh, and Jessie wriggling about  like she had ants in her pants for a few seconds, before she finally  began to speak.  "I guess I didn't really decide anything," she  started slowly.  "I just knew … I guess.  Already," she finished  awkwardly.</p>

<p>"So?" Karen prompted leadingly, "What did you realize?" She continued  earning another deep sigh and more shifting from Jessie.</p>

<p>"Mom," the girl whined, stretching the words out for as long as  humanly possible, before burying her head in the crook of Karen's  shoulder as if she was trying hide or find buried treasure.</p>

<p>"I badger because I care," Karen said with a sigh of her own, knowing  that she wasn't going to get anything else out of Jessie for the  moment.  She'd used that exact same tone with her mother more than  once and she knew what it meant.  Quit embarrassing me and leave me  alone.  It was a very adaptable whine.</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie replied softly.  "Can we go to sleep now, or do you  want to keep me up even later on a school night, so that I can't  concentrate in class, flunk out and end up selling pencils on street  corners for a living?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight, honey," was Karen's simple response.</p>

<p>"Night," Jessie mumbled.</p>

<p>"I love you," Karen added dragging the blanket up so that it covered  Jessie's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mom," Jessie said again, the pitch of her voice even higher than  before.</p>

<p>"Alright, alright," Karen replied smiling but trying not to sound  like she was.</p>
