<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 8 -->

<p>"Don't think that I've forgotten," Cordelia said coming to a stop  beside Buffy and reaching up to place the book in her hand back on  the shelf.</p>

<p>"How could I with the death rays you've been sending me all day,"  Buffy muttered in a rather petulant tone.  First she has deal with  the entire town suddenly going Disney, and then Spike becomes Mr.  Even Worse Attitude after admitting to spying on her and Cordelia  while they were in the backyard the other night – somehow making it  sound like he had suffered a great injustice – and kicked her out of  his crypt while singing that dumbass song, and now Cordelia was  giving her attitude.</p>

<p>"I think death rays is tad strong," Cordelia started with a  frown.  "Perhaps icy…uh….ah…Buffy," she trailed off clutching her  head as her eyes closed painfully.  "Buffy," she repeated one last  time before the images began to flood into her brain, slamming into  her and causing her to stumble backwards.</p>

<p>"Cordy!" Buffy yelled moving around the brunette just in time to  catch her before she hit the ground.  "Giles!  Giles…Cordelia,  something's wrong!"</p>

<p>"Dawn.  At the Bronze.  Crazy Tommy Tune like guy's holding her.   He's the one.  Buffy's dancing … for him?" Cordelia choked out her  eyes still closed even though the pain was lessening now.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Buffy asked worriedly as the brunette began to  struggle into an upright position.  "I mean, god … are they always  like that?" the Slayer continued wondering if Cordelia had been  putting up with whatever that was for over two years now.</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Cordelia said struggling onto her feet with Buffy's  help.  "It's okay.  Really.  The demon that's got Dawn, it's the same  one from my vision in L.A.," she continued.  "I…"</p>

<p>However, as Cordelia was about to continue the door to the Magic Box  came flying open and Spike walked in dragging what looked like a  super-sized Chucky doll behind him.  It was, to put it mildly,  exceptionally creepy.</p>

<p>"Lookie, lookie what I found," the vampire stated flinging the thing  inside of the shop.</p>

<p>"Is this the demon guy?" Tara asked eyeing the odd looking creature.   Somehow she thought that it really looked more comical that evil.   And he in no way resembled Tommy Tune.</p>

<p>"Tara," Willow said happily seeing the girl come up behind her.   She'd gotten the impression that Tara had been avoiding her, and as  the blonde ignored her she realized that she had been right on the  mark with her earlier assessment which meant that something was  seriously wrong.</p>

<p>"Works for him," Spike responded.  "Has a nice little story for the  Slayer, don't you?  Come on then," she continued giving Chucky a none  to gentle shove.  "Sing."</p>

<p>"My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she  summoned him and at midnight he's going to take her to the underworld  to be his queen," Chucky stated calmly.</p>

<p>Spike glanced at the Scoobies who seemed be perfectly contended with  the dolls answer irritably.  Not only was Buffy wrapped around the  bloody cheerleader like she was a candy bar, no one in the room  seemed to give a ruddy damn that they didn't know anything about what  the dancing bad wanted.  "And what does he bloody well want?" the  vampire asked jerking the doll around again.</p>

<p>"Ah Spike," Buffy interrupted as the vampire raised his hand to hit  the hostage.  "We kind of already know that."</p>

<p>"How?" </p>

<p>"Cordelia had a vision," Tara replied taking a step back when the  vampire's lips curved upwards in a snarl.</p>

<p>"Well Cordelia's just bloody well got all of the answers doesn't  she," he muttered tightening his hold on the doll.  "What's next,  turning water into wine?" he asked tossing the doll out of the door.</p>

<p>"Did somebody get caught cheating at kitten poker again?" Cordelia  asked in a suedo-sympathetic voice.  "Uh ah," the brunette continued  as the vampire wiped around to face her.  "You don't want to hurt  yourself."</p>

<p>"Um, if Cordelia and Spike are finished re-introducing us to  kindergarten, do you think that we could maybe move on," Buffy  interjected stopping the vampire from retorting.  "Like onto maybe  forming a plan."</p>

<p>"Plan, schman.  Let's mount up," Xander said taking a step forward.   He had a thing for the Summers girls.  He just liked them, and there  was NO way Dawn was getting married before him!</p>

<p>"No," Giles said glancing over at Buffy sadly.  He had hoped to see  her begin to show some kind of interest in her life, to see her  begin – even if slowly—to take charge once more.  But, here she was  again, simply waiting for orders, unable or unwillingly to think for  herself.</p>

<p>"Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature,"  Anya began at Giles statement.  "But ... I've seen some of these  underworld child bride deals and, and they never end well," she  continued.  "Well, maybe once."</p>

<p>"We're not just gonna stay here," Willow said adding onto Anya's  unique critique of Giles' noninterference policy.</p>

<p>"Yes we are," Giles responded looking intently at Buffy.  "Buffy's  going alone."</p>

<p>Spike left out briefly disgusted laugh at that.  "Gah! Don't be a  stupid git. There is no…" the vampire began.  Buffy may have been  messing around with Skipper for now, but she was still his girl  whether she knew it or not, and he'd look out for her until she  realized that they meant for each other.</p>

<p>"If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll..." Giles began before pausing  briefly to consider his words.  "I'll never want your opinion," he  concluded looking hard at the vampire.</p>

<p>Willow watched the proceedings with a growing unease.  "A little  confusion spell could…"</p>

<p>"No!" Tara interjected cutting Willow off.  A little anything spell  was the last thing any of them needed.  "I mean I don't think it'll  help."</p>

<p>"Look, forget them Slayer.  I've got your back," Spike said stepping  forward.  He liked the little bit and didn't want anything to happen  to her, plus it couldn't help but win him brownie points with Buffy.   It was really a win, win situation.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted me to stay away from you?" Buffy responded  rather militantly, unconsciously leaning towards the warmth of  Cordelia's body.  "Isn't that what you sang?"</p>

<p>"Spike sing a widdle song?" Xander asked smiling at the idea.</p>

<p>"Would you say it was a break away pop hit or more of a book number?"  Anya asked edging her way into the circle and the conversation.</p>

<p>"Let it go, sweetie," Xander responded shaking his head.  Sometimes  the woman just tore the ass out of subjects, she had to learn to let  bygones be bygones gee golly.</p>

<p>"Fine," the vampire responded angrily as she noticed the Slayer's  motions.  If she wanted the bitch she could have her.  The brunette  was going to leave, just like all the others and Buffy could rot away  alone and miserable for all he cared.  "I hope you dance till you  burn," he spat at her.  "You and the little bit," and with those  parting remarks he huffed his way out of the shop.</p>

<p>"You're really not coming?" Buffy asked turning her head to look at  her Watcher.  She couldn't believe what she was hearing.  They were  just going to abandon her now?  They couldn't be bothered anymore?   She hadn't asked for them to bring her back, but they had, so that  what? They could stay home at night and carve fertility statues?</p>

<p>"It's up to you," Giles responded walking over to Buffy.  He could  see the hurt in her eyes, but he knew that it was for the best.</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to do?" the Slayer asked clearly upset.</p>

<p>"Your best," the older man responded.</p>

<p>Buffy clenched her jaw.  Her best.  Whatever.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy shoved her hands into her pockets as she stalked down the  darkened streets of downtown Sunnydale.  She was overwhelmed, she was  hated, she was alone, and she was numb.  "I touch the fire and it  freezes me/ I look in to it and it's black," she began to sing, her  heart contracting painfully.  Had it ever been warm?  Was it that  along ago?  "Why can't I feel?/ My skin should crack and peel," she  continued passing by an open fire and feeling nothing.  "I want the  fire back!"</p>

<p>"Now through the smoke/ She calls to me./  To make my way across the  flame/ To save the day," she sang her move forming a sorry excuse for  a smile, "or maybe melt away/ I guess it's all the same," she  continued shoving her hands into her pockets.  It didn't matter  anyway, whatever she did it was never enough, there were always more  and always death.</p>

<p>"So I will walk through the fire," she continued making her way down  the street.  "'Cause where else can I turn?  I will walk through the  fire/ And let it…"</p>

<hr>

<p>"I hope you dance till you burn," Cordelia repeated.  Spike's words  swirling around in her mind like endless dark clouds.  Images from  her visions flashing in mind, disjointed but pieces that could be put  together.  "Buffy surrounded by smoke," she continued.  "I hope you  dance till you burn…oh god!" she said whipping around to face the  others in the room.</p>

<p>"Will this do a thing to change her?/ Am I leaving Dawn in danger?/  Is my Slayer to far gone to care?/" Giles sang looking thoughtfully  into the distance.</p>

<p>"What if Buffy can't defeat it?" Xander sang looking around the room.</p>

<p>"Beady eye's is right," Anya joined in.</p>

<p>"We're needed," Cordelia continued.</p>

<p>"Or we could just sit around and glare," the ex-demon went on staring  at Willow and Tara.</p>

<p>Immediately they all rose, striding purposefully towards the door.</p>

<p>"We'll see it through/ That's what we're always here to do," they  sang together as they strode down the street.  "So we will walk  through the fire…"</p>

<hr>

<p>"Showtime!" Buffy heard from in front of her as she kicked the door  to the Bronze down and walked inside.  "I love a good entrance," the  demon continued.</p>

<p>"How are you with death scenes?" the Slayer asked looking up onto the  stage to make sure her sister was alright.</p>

<p>"You got a name?" she continued ignoring the creatures amused  laughter.</p>

<p>"I've got a hundred," Sweet responded with a smile.</p>

<p>"I ought to know what to call you if you're going to be my brother in  law," the Slayer continued taking up a relaxed stance against one of  the room's pool tables.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I swear I didn't…" Dawn started wondering why she constantly  had to be the damsel in distress.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, you're not going anywhere," the Slayer said  interrupting her sister.  "I am."</p>

<p>"What?" Sweet asked leaning forward.  This was an unexpected, though  not totally unwelcome change.</p>

<p>"Deal's this," Buffy said meeting his gaze.  "I can't kill you…you  take me to Hellsville in her place," she continued her voice almost  as flat as she was feeling.</p>

<p>"What if I kill you?" Sweet asked intrigued by the Slayer's response  to the whole situation.</p>

<p>"Trust me.  Won't help," the blonde deadpanned meeting the demon's  gaze.</p>

<p>"That's gloomy," Sweet responded.</p>

<p>"That's life," Buffy replied checking her instinct to frown at the  feeling of déjà vu that came over her.</p>

<p>"Come on now, is that really how you feel?" Sweet asked.  "Isn't life  a miraculous thing?" he continued in a teasing tone.</p>

<p>"I think you already know," Buffy replied pushing off of the pool  table.  "Life's a show/ And we all play our parts/ And when the music  starts," she sang, opening up her jacket as she went along.  "We open  up our hearts," she went on moving forward as her jacket dropped to  the ground.  "It's alright/ If some things come out wrong/ We'll sing  a happy song/ And you can sing along," she continued grabbing a pool  cue and some of Sweet's minions approached her from the sides.</p>

<p>"Everywhere there's life," she sang hitting one of the minions with  the cue.  "There's hope/ Every day's," she continued elbowing one, "A  gift. Wishes can," kick, "come true/ Whistle while/ You work/ So  hard/ All day," she continued impaling the last of the minions.</p>

<p>"To be like other girls," she continued as the Scoobies arrived.  "To  fit in to this glittering world," she continued wistfully.  "Don't  give me songs/ Don't give me songs," she continued as Anya and Tara  began to dance behind her.</p>

<p>"Give me something to sing about…" she cried desperately.  Make it  enough; she needed it to be enough.</p>

<hr>

<p>"All the joy/ Life sends," Buffy continued working herself up into a  frenzy, wanting to stop but not knowing how.  "Family/ And friends/  All the twists/ And bends/ Knowing that/ It ends/ Well that/  Depends," she continued wishing that her mouth would shut yet at the  same time becoming oddly glad that it wouldn't.  "On if they let you  go/ On if they know enough to know/ That when you've bowed/ You leave  the crowd," she went on walking up onto the stage, her gaze shifting  between the others and Sweet.</p>

<p>"There was no pain/No fear, no doubt/ Till they pulled me out/ Of  Heaven," she continued noticing Giles and Xander's shocked  faces.  "So that's my refrain/I live in Hell/ `Cause I've been  expelled/From Heaven/ I think I was in Heaven," she went on  softly.  "So give me something to sing about…"</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia watched as Buffy looked out at them desperately before  flipping off of the stage.  She turned to look at the Scoobies who  were standing by in some sort of stupor as Buffy began to dance and  dance and dance.  Faster and faster she moved, spinning wildly until  smoke began to curl off of her.  </p>

<p>"Buffy!" she called out stepping forward, her shoulder colliding with  something.  Turning her head she spotted Spike beside her.  She  hadn't realized when he had shown up, but apparently he had the same  idea she did.  </p>

<p>They watched each other for the briefest of moments, then eyes  blaring with some emotion the brunette didn't have the time to  identify, the vampire stepped back allowing Cordelia access to the  Slayer.</p>

<p>"Life's not a play," Cordelia sang grasping Buffy's shoulders,  slowing the Slayer's motions down.  "It isn't bliss/ It's just this,"  she continued as Buffy stared at her.  "It's living," the brunette  went on.  "You'll find a way," she sang, brushes a stray strand of  the Slayer's hair away.  "Those feelings of pain/ Only you can  repair/ By living.  You have to go on living.  Believe in living,"  Cordelia continued as Buffy stared at her.</p>

<p>Buffy stared into the brunette's dark eyes, the shimmering, dark  orbits anchoring her as emotions churned inside of her like the sea  during a storm.  She didn't want to feel like this anymore.  She  couldn't take feeling like this anymore.</p>

<p>"The hardest thing in this world…is to live in it," she heard her  sister say from behind Cordelia.  Her voice quivering slightly as she  recalled the Slayer's words.  </p>

<p>And Buffy remembered then.  She remembered what love felt like.  She  remembered loving Dawn so much that she died for her, and how  beautiful and terrible an emotion it was.  She remembered how happy  she was to see Giles when he returned and how she was unable to  convey to him just how glad she was to see him.  She remembered the  endless comedy that was kitten poker, and she remembered Cordelia  trying to chase her down with the shopping cart at the grocery  store.  She remembered the way the brunette's lips felt against hers,  and how wonderful it felt to feel Cordelia's warm body sliding  against her own, warming her in places that had been so cold.  She  remembered that cartoon they always used to show after Care Bears  where the little boy shared his double scoop with his sister after  she dropped hers and how it always made her feel warm and fuzzy  inside.  She remembered how much fun it had been trying to teach  Willow to skate until the redhead had decided that sitting on the ice  was more her speed, and much more fun it had been meeting with Xander  for hot chocolate after.  She remembered that things could be good…if  you'd let them.</p>

<p>So, remembering this, Buffy leaned into the brunette's arms allowing  the other woman to pull her into a tender embrace.  And lying her  head against Cordelia's chest, her eyes closing as she sighed softly,  she let it feel good.</p>
